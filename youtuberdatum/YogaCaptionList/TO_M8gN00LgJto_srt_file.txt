- Hi everyone, 
welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and this 
is Benji and today we have
an awesome rebirth 
yoga practice for you.
So hop into something 
comfy and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Okay my darling friends, 
let's begin today's practice
in a cross-legged seat.
Feel free to 
sit up on something,
maybe a blanket or a 
block or a couple towels.
To find length in the spine,
lift your heart right away
and let's take a 
deep breath in here.
As you exhale, 
relax your shoulders down.
Just kind of come into your
seat, come into this moment.
Whatever you're coming on
the mat with, it's all good.
This session is
just a gentle hand 
to help you renew.
Feel good.
Invite, things to 
cycle through, right?
So the only constant is change,
and we're constantly changing
so that's why I love the 
mantra find what feels good
because how we 
show up on the mat
and really commit to 
discovery is everything.
I find it so valuable.
So just in case this 
is applicable for you,
just allow things 
to cycle through here.
Allow this practice 
to help you do that,
and if you're feeling great,
let's just tend to 
the breath in the body,
maybe a little 
preventative care.
Together let's bring the 
palms together at the heart.
And close your eyes.
Notice how this mudra,
this just palms 
together in prayer position
makes you feel if anything and
if nothing, that's cool too.
And then we'll take 
another deep breath in here.
And once again use the exhale
to actively relax 
the shoulders down.
Then gently bow 
your head to your hands,
start to get a nice, good
stretch in the back of the neck
and maybe set a 
little intention.
What do you choose 
for this next cycle
whatever it may be?
Whether it's just 
the day ahead or perhaps
you're practicing 
this around a birthday
or perhaps it's the end of a job
or the end of a project 
or the end of a relationship,
whatever it is.
Maybe you set a little intention
for what you 
choose moving ahead.
Just notice what 
came up, if anything.
And here we go, 
another deep, full,
conscious I love you breath in.
And as you exhale,
slowly release,
hands to the knees or thighs.
You can lift the head 
back up over the heart.
Take a second here to nod
the head a little yes and no.
Just waking up the neck.
You can draw circles 
with the nose one way
and then the other.
Maybe welcome 
a gentle smile, life is good.
Things are cyclical 
and I feel like, yeah,
the yoga practice is 
such a wonderful place to land
to just ground and be present
in that constant cycle.
Okay, bring the 
head back over the heart.
Let's keep the left heel
coming in towards the body here
and in your own time gently
extend the right leg out long.
If you are already starting to
feel a stretch here, amazing.
This is why we're here.
If not, move the fleshy 
part of the buttocks aside.
Take a deep breath in to reach
the arms up and overhead.
And first on the exhale you're
gonna take your right hand
over towards the 
top of your left thigh
and your left hand up and
over towards your right toes.
So don't worry about 
this specific shape here.
Focus on the 
sensation here instead.
Flex your right toes,
you can even
spread the right toes here.
Breathing deep, inhale in.
Exhale to come 
all the way back up.
Now bring your 
fingertips to the earth
and you're gonna lift 
your hip points up high.
Shift your center, 
your navel towards
your right toes and 
here we go, inhale in.
Exhale, bend your right knee
as generously as you need 
to as you drape your belly
and your heart over 
the top of your right leg.
In time we can work to bow the
head down towards the knee,
nose towards at the knee.
And in time we 
might be able to work
to straighten that leg,
head to knee pose here.
Breathing into the kidneys,
toward the kidneys, excuse me,
into the low back, 
relaxing the shoulders down,
keeping the right foot active.
Take a second here to listen
to the sound of your breath.
And then slowly begin 
to roll it up. Awesome.
We'll bring the right heel in
and send the left leg out long.
Inhale, when you're ready,
reach the fingertips up high.
Exhale, left hand to the right
knee and then here we go.
Think up with the 
right fingertips and over.
Towards the left foot.
And I used to just shove 
myself into these shapes,
kind of more traditional shapes
and I wanna 
encourage you not to do that.
Instead focus on the sensation.
So I'm feeling this stretch.
I'm using my 
breath to find depth.
Flexing the left 
foot towards your head,
take one more breath.
And then slowly release,
fingertips come to the earth.
We're gonna shift the 
hips now towards the left.
So now your center, 
your navel is pointing towards
your left toes.
Inhale in, lift up.
Reach for the sky, exhale,
bend your knees generously
as you need to and 
start to drape the belly
and the heart over 
the top of your left leg.
Now work here with your breath.
In time we can maybe 
get a little bit closer,
knee towards the, or excuse
me, nose towards the knee.
Finding your 
appropriate edge today
and breathing deep 
as you come again
into your private 
little love cave here.
Listen to the 
sound of your breath.
Relax the skin of your forehead.
Soften through the jaw.
Gorgeous, then take 
one more deep breath in.
Breathe into all 
four sides of your torso.
And then exhale 
to roll it up, awesome.
Bring the soles of the feet
together here, Cobbler's Pose.
If the knees are up here,
just let them be up here
where you are today, 
notice where you are in the hips
and be thankful that 
you're here making discoveries,
and in time 
with regular practice
or with your rebirth, 
rejuvenating your love for yoga
and your commitment 
to home practice,
you can work to slowly, slowly,
slowly, slowly open the hips.
You'd be surprised how 
fast the body can change
and transform 
with regular practice.
So layer in the breath here.
Wherever you are, lift up
through the heart, the chest.
You can check in with 
the head and the neck again.
Find a nice, tall posture.
Excellent and then 
take one more breath,
sit up a little taller, 
lengthen through the crown,
relax the shoulders down.
And then slowly release, 
bring the knees together.
They're gonna come together,
together, really together.
And arches of the feet are
gonna squeeze together as well.
Great, bring the 
hands to the backs
of the thighs now, 
lean back, way back.
I was gonna say with my 
mind on my money and my money
on my mind, okay, and 
then lift the shins up parallel
to the ceiling as you lean back.
You can stay on the 
backs of the thighs here
with the hands holding on
or we'll reach the 
fingertips forward, palms up.
Smile here as you breathe deep,
lighting a little tiny 
little fire in the belly.
Inhale in.
Exhale. Inhale, draw 
the hands to the heart.
Exhale, twisting to the lift,
tap your right toes down.
Inhale back to center,
everything.
Exhale, twist to the right,
tap your left toes down.
Inhale to center, 
keep your chest lifted.
Exhale, twist.
Inhale to center.
Exhale, twist.
One more time to each side,
you got this, nice and slow.
Inhale, lift.
Exhale, twist and tap.
Inhale, lift. 
Exhale, twist and tap.
Awesome, from here you're
gonna slowly cross the ankles,
come through to all 
fours nice and slow.
Find your Tabletop Position,
knees underneath the hip points,
wrists underneath the shoulders.
On your next 
inhale drop the belly,
breathe like you love yourself,
move like you love yourself,
open the heart forward.
Exhale, mindfully round through,
draw the navel 
up towards the sky,
press into the hands,
press into the 
tops of the feet firmly.
Again, inhale, 
drop the belly, smooth it out.
Exhale, rounding through.
Keep it going now
with your breath.
Creating soft, easy 
movement in the body,
focusing on the spine here.
Always, always, always 
syncing up with your breath.
Whenever possible, 
spiraling back to that conscious
attention towards your breath,
towards your spirit.
Towards you.
Alright, even it out,
find what feels good.
Let's meet back in a nice
Tabletop Position, 
neutral spine.
So the crown is 
really reaching forward
and the tail is 
lengthening back,
so the head's not dipping down.
Then press away 
from your yoga mat,
literally press 
away from the earth,
lift your shoulder 
blades left to right.
Hollow through the front body.
So we're hugging the low ribs in
and we're gonna test 
that by curling the toes under
and lifting the knee 
caps here for hovering table.
Breathe in deep, here we go.
Send your gaze down 
once you have the shape.
Upper arm bones rotate out,
you're feeling your abdominal
wall turn on once again,
lighting that 
sweet fire in the belly.
We're here for ten, 
mhmmm, nine, you got it.
Eight, seven, six, five,
four, three, two, on 
the one lower the knees.
Bring them together,
really together
and you're gonna 
send the hips back
for Balasana, yay, Child's Pose.
Send the fingertips towards
the back edge of your mat.
Melt your heart down, 
close your eyes and breathe.
Notice if you're 
gripping anywhere
around the shoulders 
or the elbows.
See if you can let the 
weight of your arms go.
Then with your eyes closed,
take one more cycle of 
breath here in and out.
And then slowly begin 
to wiggle the fingertips,
draw the hands and 
the arms all the way up,
carve a line with 
your nose to look forward
and slowly we'll come 
back up to all fours. Awesome.
Walk the hands out wide,
curl the toes under,
start to peel up 
towards Downward Facing Dog.
Take a deep breath in here.
Exhale, start to 
pedal it out, stretch.
Listen to the sound 
of your breath here,
and when you're ready, 
anchor through the left heel
and inhale, lift the right
leg up high, Three-Legged Dog.
Exhale, shift it 
forward all the way.
Step up the right foot, 
lower the back knee down
for a nice, low lunge.
Front knee over front ankle.
You can walk that left knee
back just a bit if you like.
Inhale to open 
the chest forward,
exhale to peel the 
right hip crease back.
Flex your right 
toes towards your face.
Slowly draw your nose 
towards your knees here.
Knee, sorry, nose 
towards your right knee here.
Got into it, and then rolling 
through the front foot
we're gonna come back up,
front knee over front ankle.
This time sweep 
the arms forward up
and back, Crescent Lunge.
Lift your heart, peel 
the right hip crease back,
lift up from the pelvic floor.
Find that inner support 
system here in this shape.
Soft fingers or bright fingers,
just nice conscious fingers,
inhale in.
Exhale, rain it down.
Okay, check it out, 
we're gonna lift the back knee,
come to a nice low lunge here.
Take your right hand 
over to meet the left.
You're gonna 
keep walking it around
as you straighten your legs,
coming into a nice, standing,
Wide-Legged Forward Fold.
Slight microbend 
in the knees here,
toes are slightly turned in.
We're breathing deep here.
If the fingertips or hands
don't make it to the ground,
you can bring the hands 
to the tops of the thighs
but with slight 
bend in the knee.
Breathing deep here.
If the hands do 
make it to the ground,
you can start to walk them back,
close to the arches of the
feet and maybe even one day
getting in line with the
arches of the feet and inviting
the crown of the 
head to come down.
If the crown of the 
head is coming down,
draw up from the 
arches and bring the elbows
so they're nice and square,
two 90 degree angles.
And everyone draw the navel
in and up, Uddiyana Bandha.
Just slowly come back out.
We're gonna keep turning 
now towards the left foot.
Come into a nice, low 
lunge on the left side.
Front knee over front ankle,
breathe deep here.
If you want, you can 
walk the right knee back now
for a deeper stretch.
Inhale, open the chest,
let your heart energy radiate
forward and then exhale,
peel the left hip crease back,
flex those left toes towards
your face and breathe deep
as you guide the nose 
towards your left knee.
Mhmmm, mhmmm, so awesome,
take one more breath.
Here and then rolling 
through the front foot,
we'll come back to 
that nice, low lunge.
When you're ready, inhale,
Crescent, reaching 
fingertips forward, up and back.
We're not just dumping all
of our energy into the earth,
we're using it, using the earth
to find that energy within
and you can literally find
that muscularly 
through the asana.
So lift up 
through the pelvic floor,
find your big beach 
ball up and over head,
peel the left hip 
crease back, inhale.
And exhale, 
slowly release it down.
Back knee lifts, 
we're gonna come right back
through that standing 
Wide-Legged Forward Fold.
Awesome.
Breathe deep here, 
take your variation.
Whatever works for you, but
make sure you're breathing.
And if you're folded down,
slowly walk your 
fingertips back out.
Come to a nice 
flat back position,
and together we'll 
continue the journey bending
the front knee, 
coming all the way back.
You're gonna 
plant the palms here
and we're just 
gonna kick it right back
to Downward Facing Dog.
Awesome.
Plant the palms.
Turn the two big toes in.
Send the hips up 
high and back.
Great, inhale, slide the left
up high, Three-Legged Dog.
Exhale, slowly send it forward
all the way into 
a nice, low lunge.
Inhale, Crescent.
Listen carefully, exhale.
Floating the fingertips down,
you're gonna plant the 
palms and we're gonna kick it
back up to that 
Three-Legged Dog.
Good, lower the left foot.
Anchor through 
the left heel, inhale,
lift the right leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward,
lower the back knee.
Crescent on the inhale,
reach it up.
Finding your flow with 
your breath, exhale, plant.
Kick it back, Three-Legged Dog.
Right leg lowers.
Inhale, left leg up high.
Exhale, step it forward.
Inhale, Crescent,
lift your heart.
Exhale to release.
Inhale, Three-Legged Dog.
And exhale, lower left leg down.
Okay, here we 
go with the breath.
Inhale, lift the 
right leg up high.
Exhale, step it forward.
Lower the back knee, 
inhale, Crescent.
Exhale, rain it down.
Inhale, Three-Legged Dog,
you got this.
Exhale, lower 
the right foot down.
Inhale, lift the 
left leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward.
Inhale, Crescent,
squeeze the inner
thighs to the midline.

Connect to your core,
hug the low ribs in.

Exhale, lower left foot down.
Inhale, lift the 
right leg up high.
Exhale, step it forward.
Lower the back knee.

Exhale, float it down.
One more round.

left leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward.
This time, option to 
keep the back knee lifted.
Inhale, reach it up.
Exhale, slowly lower down.
Inhale, kick it back.
Exhale, lower.
Last side, inhale, lift it up.
Exhale, step it up.
Inhale, option to 
keep the back knee lifted.
Reach up high.
Exhale, slowly send 
the hands down.
Last one, inhale, lift it up.
Exhale, lower the 
right foot to the ground.
Both feet on the ground,
press away from your yoga mat,
send the hips up high and back.
Inhale in, exhale, slow descend
to the knees to the earth.
Bring your knees together,
really together.
Paint your yoga mat,
flick the palms back
and melt your 
heart in Child's Pose.
Close your eyes.
Observe your breath, see if
you can feel your heartbeat.
Awesome work.
Take a couple 
quiet breaths here.
Just blanket yourself in love.
Feeling the rise and 
the fall of your breath.
Awesome, then start to 
wiggle your fingertips.
And when you're ready,
dragging the arms,
the hands forward, carving a
line with the nose to lift up
and coming through 
all the way to flat back.
So you can cross the 
ankles and come through.
You're gonna lay on your back,
snuggle the shoulder blades
underneath your 
heart space here.
And legs out long.
Take one final stretch,
inhale, reaching the 
arms up and overhead.
And exhale to gently 
bring the hands to your sides,
walk the heels out.
Allow the feet to relax 
and the hands to relax.
And you can close your 
eyes here, tucking the chin.
Finding that length 
in the back of the neck.
Allow for a moment 
of surrender here.
Surrendering to that 
which you cannot control.
Remembering that 
everything that we learn
and practice on the mat
potentially has 
value off the mat.
As you're ready, 
bring the palms together,
thumbs right up 
to the third eye.
Take one final big inhale in.
And as you exhale, slowly peel
one foot up, then the other.
And then when you're ready,
release the hands,
bring them to the shins, hug
your knees into your chest,
rock gently side to side.
Awesome work.
Cross the ankles,
we're gonna roll all 
the way up nice and easy.
You can rock a couple 
times if it feels awesome.
Come to a seat and bring the
palms together at your heart.
Remember your intention,
whatever came up
at the beginning 
of this practice
as you gently bow the 
head to the heart once again.
And we'll finish this practice
by taking three deep breaths,
so here we go.
Big inhale in 
through the nose and out.
Inhale in.
And empty it out.
And one more time, big inhale.
And final exhale.
I wish you the 
best on your journey.
Thank you for 
sharing your practice
and your valuable time with me
and with the 
Yoga With Adriene community.
We'll finish by 
bowing the head to the heart
and whispering
Namaste.
(upbeat music)
