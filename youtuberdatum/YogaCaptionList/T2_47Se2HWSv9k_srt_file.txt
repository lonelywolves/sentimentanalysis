- Hello everyone.
My name is Adriene
and this is Benji
and welcome to
your yoga PE today.
We're gonna focus on energizing
the body so please join me
standing up nice and
tall in Mountain Pose.
Ground through your feet,
get strong in your legs,
lift your chest up
like you're nice and proud
in your beautiful body.
Yes.
And then imagine, 
you can even take your hands
to the top of your head.
Imagine that the tip of your
head is the top or the peak,
if you will, of the mountain.
Awesome and then if your hands
are up go ahead and allow them
to come back down to your sides.
Your arms are the
sides of the mountain here.
We're standing up nice and tall.
We're gonna take a couple
of deep breaths in to start.
So here we go big
inhale in through your nose.
And out through your mouth.
Good, in through your nose.
And you can make a little
sound here as you breath out.
(sighs)
And then let's get nice
and loud on this third one.
Inhale in.
(sighs)
Awesome.
Beautiful Mountain Pose 
with deep breaths
to ground us in this moment.
Alright, we're gonna start
with some shoulder rotations.
Warming up through the shoulders
so keep those nice big breaths
going as you roll
the shoulders back.
Should feel really good.
Just a couple times here.
Awesome, now we're gonna swim
it forward to take the shoulders
in the opposite
direction one arm at a time.
Shoulder rotations
forwards, swim it out.
Awesome work.
Now zip the legs together,
stand up nice and tall again,
Mountain Pose and then we're
gonna bring our arms into a
T-shape so we're gonna 
come into a position
to get ready for our arm circles.
We're gonna go one way first.
Just establish
either back or forward.
You get to decide.
And now we're gonna reverse it.
Take it in the
opposite direction.
(mimics record reversing)
And then reverse it.
(mimics record reversing)
And reverse it one more time.
Awesome. Now come 
into your T-shape.
I'm from Texas so 
I call this a Texas T.
You're gonna really 
straighten your arms.
Really reach, reach, reach
and spread your 
fingertips like starfish.
Beautiful, now we're gonna
practice a balancing pose so
we're gonna slowly lift up on
to the toes so lift your heels,
up onto the toes.
See if you can balance
here as you squeeze the legs.
The arms will get tired but
we're building 
strength and stability.
Good and then lower the heels.
To give the arms a rest
we're gonna wrap them
around our shoulders.
Give yourself a big hug.
Take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
Good, one more time, Texas T.
Right into it, lift the heels.
See if you can balance.
And you can look at something
on the ground in front of you to
help you with your
balance pose here.
Beautiful, take
a deep breath in.
And then lower the heels
and give yourself a hug.
Awesome, release the arms
step your feet nice and wide.
Now we're gonna go into a
windmill so send your
fingertips up
for Star Pose here.
Again, spread the
fingers like starfish.
You're gonna take
your right hand,
inhale, exhale we're
gonna fold forward,
touch the left toes
with your right hand.
Now left hand goes all
the way up towards the sky.
Then we're gonna switch,
we're gonna come all the way up
through center and
take it to the other side.
Left hand reaches
towards the right foot.
Now keep it
going back and forth.
Building some heat in the body,
opening up through the backs of
the legs, the hamstrings.
Get a great stretch here.
The hips, back and forth.
Sending the opposite hand, the
one all the way up towards the
sky and reaching
towards your toes.
Now if you can't touch
your toes today, don't worry.
Just reach in that direction.
Awesome work, keep it goin'.
And release.
From here bring 
the hands at your heart,
take a deep breath in.
And exhale out through the
mouth just like we did before.
Now bend your knees,
hop the feet together,
zip the legs tight, tight, tight.
Awesome.
From here, we're gonna 
interlace the fingertips
press the palms forward.
Now bring the pinkies all
the way up towards the sky,
big stretch.
If you want to you can yawn here
as we move from side to side
stretching through 
the side body.
Excellent, then
come back to center.
Release the hands,
wiggle the fingertips,
rain it down and here we go.
We're gonna step
on the one foot.
And then we're gonna
lift the opposite leg,
kiss opposite elbow to
opposite knee like this.
Then switch.
So we're coming into a
little bit of a slow march here.
Elbow kissing knee.
Back and forth, left to right.
Once you feel like you 
get it you might start to
speed it up a little bit.
And if you feel pretty good here
and you want to take it a step
further, add a little hop.
So we're getting
our heart rate moving.
We can smile here.
We can laugh.
We can giggle.
We're breathing deep.
And we'll keep 
it going for three,
for two, and for one.
Now zip the legs up
come back to Mountain Pose.
Control your breath.
Take a deep breath in.
And exhale out
through the mouth.
Awesome work, alright,
now step the legs out wide.
About as wide as your wrists are
when you send your 
fingertips out in Texas T.
So think about that.
Take a second to find your
stance 'cause now we're gonna
do a still windmill,
a different version.
So legs are nice and wide.
We also call this Standing
Wide-Legged Forward Fold.
You're gonna take your Texas T,
you're gonna send your 
hips back, keep your Texas T,
we take it forward as if 
you were looking into a pond.
Maybe you see your reflection,
maybe you wink at yourself.
Say like, "What's up?"
And then after you
said what's up or hello,
we're gonna take 
one hand to the ground
and one hand to the sky.
And if you don't make it,
that's okay,
you can hover in space and
create more 
strength in your core.
Now find stillness here.
It's a challenge, breathe deep.
Then come all 
the way back up, Texas T.
Good, inhale in.
Exhale out.
Second side.
Hand to the ground,
hand to the sky.
Try to find stillness.
So good for the spine.
Big twist, strong legs.
Here we go, all the way 
back up to your Texas T.
Here we go, big breath in.
Big breath out, step or
hop the feet together.
Mountain Pose.
Alright, awesome
work, here we go.
Interlace the fingertips,
press them forward, up and back.
Side body stretch.
Again, we can yawn here.
Alright, so the next thing
is called squat and shoot.
Before we do that we're gonna
take a couple wrist circles.
Just get ready for our lay-up.
So just take the wrists one way.
We can do open hands or
fists and then the other.
And you can have a
little fun with it.
Alright and then shake it out.
And here we go,
we're gonna drop it low,
squat, you're gonna 
grab your ball
and then you're 
gonna jump and shoot.
And you can imagine a ball or
you can imagine picking
something creative off the
ground like, "Oh, an apple."
Maybe taking a bite
and then shooting it.
Here we go.
We're gonna squat and shoot.
Squat and shoot.
Squat then shoot.
Squat and shoot.
Squat and shoot, you got this.
Squat and shoot.
Three more.
Squat and shoot.
Squat and shoot.
Last one, squat and shoot.
Here we go, step it wide 
we're going right
into jumping jacks here.
Nice and easy,
nice and easy pace.
This is what we're
finishing up with today.
So breathe deep.
Keep it going.
Now to add a little 
flavor to your jacks
you can cross the 
legs in the middle.
You can smile.
You can make funny
shapes with your eyebrows.
Everyone breathe deep.
You're doing awesome.
So for the last 10 seconds,
you might move in a circle.
Good and then bring it back to
center, our final Mountain Pose.
Take a deep breath in.
Crown of the head is
the top of the mountain.
And as you exhale hands
rest gently at your side.
Take a second to just
notice how you feel.
Feel your heart pumping,
your blood flowing.
We finish this PE break by
taking a deep
breath in together.
And one final exhale together.
Thanks everyone.
Take good care.
(upbeat music)
