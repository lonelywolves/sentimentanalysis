- Hey everyone.
Welcome to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 7, Synchronize.
Let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Alrighty, my darling friend,
come on down to the ground.
Let's begin in a
nice seated position.
Maybe lifting the
hips up here again today.
And lifting the
heart here to start.
So we are
closing Week 1
with this practice.
Let's lift the heart a little,
relax the shoulders,
and close the eyes.
And as you begin to tune
into your breath today,
I wish (laughs) for 
you to feel the love
that you are and the
love that you deserve.
Showing up for yourself
and for a regular practice
can be a challenge.
And I just want to
remind you that
you are worthy,
and so am I, and it is a
total honor to be your guide
and your cheerleader here.
So as you get settled in here,
start to listen to
the sound of your breath
and just notice what
it's like here in this moment
as you arrive on the mat today.
Relax your shoulders.
Notice if you're clenching 
or holding in any area
of the body, perhaps in the jaw,
or anywhere around
the hips or the belly,
the legs, the ankles, the feet.
Then take a deep breath in.
And a long breath
out through the lips.
As if you were maybe blowing
out a candle in slow motion.
Again, inhale in
deeply through the nostrils.
And with pursed
lips here, exhale.
And one more just like that,
make it really slow
and long, deep inhale.
And exhale through the lips.
Beautiful, draw
your hands together.
Bow the head to the heart.
Start to feel that now nice
stretch in the back of the neck.
And let's choose 
in this moment to
let go of the day thus far.
Or maybe even
letting go of our experience
of the morning thus far
and really using this practice
as an opportunity to
embrace the present.
And it's a practice.
So I'll do it one
breath at a time.
Take a deep breath in again.
Exhale through the nose or
lips as you lift the head.
And we're gonna
cross the ankles here,
so if you're in
another variation of a seat,
go ahead and cross the
ankles and give yourself
a bit of space.
So not too tight here,
but really creating
like a triangle shape
here between the legs.
Excellent, then we're going
to bring the hands to the knees.
Sit up nice and tall,
so tuck the chin slightly,
lengthen through
the back of the neck,
then lift the chin,
parallel to the earth.
Again, opening the chest,
lifting the heart,
relaxing the shoulders down.
Then we're gonna
take the right hand,
bring it over to the left knee.
With your left hand here,
we're going to start
to synchronize
movement with breath.
And we're also going to
open up through the neck,
the shoulders, 
the trapezius, the scap.
Kind of opening up
so that we can breathe
fully into the lungs 
and the rib cage.
Here we go, inhale, reach the
right fingertips on a diagonal
all the way up.
All the way up, up, up like so.
And then exhale, 
continue on the diagonal
all the way back and down.
Nice and slow here to begin.
Inhale, fingertips
reach all the way up.
We're moving in a
diagonal axis here,
and then exhale all
the way down, back to one.
Inhale, reach it up.
On the diagonal, heart's lifted,
heart stays lifted.
As you exhale, take it all 
the way down on the diagonal.
There's energy in
the fingertips here.
Inhale, reach it up.
And exhale, bring it down.
Now inhale, reach it up.
Really lift, lift,
lift as if someone
were grabbing your
wrist or your fingertips
and pulling you up.
And exhale, 
down on the diagonal.
Inhale, we come up.
And exhale, down.
Now keep it going with
the sound of your breath.
This is so good. 
You spend so much time kind of
hunched over,
working on a phone, computer.
Maybe you lay on
your side when you sleep.
This is so good for
the neck, the shoulders,
again loosening up
that scap/lat area.
Keep it going here.
And now we're gonna
start to see if we can integrate
the neck a little
more by bringing our gaze
to the right thumb 
and following it
on that diagonal.
The right arm may 
get a little tired here.
But anchor in the
sound of the breath.
Inhaling to come up.
Exhaling to bring it down.
Let's do one more.
And when the right hand
comes down to the left.
You can go ahead and
slide it over to the right knee
and just take a second to
pause and notice how you feel.
Just notice if you feel a difference
between the right neck-
shoulder area and the
left neck-shoulder area.
And now we'll slide the
left palm over to the right knee
and same thing, here we go.
Big inhale to send the
fingertips all the way up.
And exhale all the way back.
Opening up
through that left pec.
Staying on that diagonal.
We inhale, reach it up.
And exhale, bring it down.
Alright, you know 
what to do here.
See if you can really
find a lift on the inhale.
Coming out of
that left side waist.
And when you're ready or
maybe you're already there,
send your gaze to
follow your left thumb.
Integrating the neck.
Inhaling to bring it up.
And exhaling to bring it down.
Excellent, do one more round.
Synchronizing the
breath to the movement,
the movement to the breath.
Then we'll bring the left
palm back to the left knee.
Close your eyes and
just notice the sensation
from the back of the head,
the jaw, the ear,
the neck, the shoulders.
And as you lift your heart,
lengthening through
the side body, side waist.
Great, then we'll drop
the chin to the chest.
Just take a gentle
circle one way with the nose
and then the other.
Nice and easy.
And then when you
feel satisfied here,
let's slowly come
forward onto all fours.
Nice and easy.
Know that have 
that blanket there,
you can always pad
the knees if you like.
Tabletop Position, inhale to
drop the belly, open the chest.
Look forward.
Benji's on watch
today and exhale,
rounding through chin to chest.
Drop the weight of the head.
Good, inhale, drop the belly.
Open your heart.
And exhale, chin to chest,
navel draws up, up, up.
One more round.
My hands and feet are engaged,
pressing down into the earth.
And then on your next inhale,
come to Tabletop Position,
walk the palms forward,
curl the toes under,
and send the hips up high
and back, Downward Facing Dog.
So today walk the toes back,
take a nice long dog.
So the heels may
not come to the ground
and that's all right.
We're spreading the fingertips.
The upper arm bones
are rotating externally,
so the elbow creases
are shining forward.
Now bend your knees here,
lift up from your hip creases.
So really exaggerate this
lift up through the hips.
Good, then bend the
knees a little more.
Lift up through
the hip creases again.
Then straighten the legs.
Drop the heels.
Take a deep breath in
and a long breath out.
Good, on your next inhale,
bend the knees, look forward.
Exhale, baby steps to the top.
So stretching
through the foot, the anklel.
Feet hip width
apart or flush together
at the top of the mat,
your choice.
And then relax the weight of
the head, neck, shoulders over.
Slight bend in the knees here.
Careful not to lock out.
Shake the head a
little yes, a little no.
Listen to the
sound of your breath.
Good, now when you're ready,
send your
awareness to your feet.
Ground down, root down
firmly to all four corners
and begin to slowly
roll up to Mountain Pose.
When you land, 
once again, lift your heart,
draw the
shoulder blades together
and then down the back body.
So we're really creating a
lots of length in the spine.
Standing tall here.
Then we're gonna create
a little flow with the hands
by inhaling, sending the
fingertips out, left to right.
So like a big Texas T here.
Pull back in the pinkies a bit.
It's almost as if your
Kate Winslet at the tip
of the Titanic.
Gotta slip that in there always.
It's a good image.
Lifting the heart,
grounding through the legs.
So we inhale to come here.
Exhale, we bring the
hands together with energy.
We know this.
Good, and then inhale,
drop your chin.
Reach behind the neck,
fingertips kiss,
and then palms
come together again.
And we inhale, reach all
the way up towards the sky.
And then exhale, hands come down
to the heart, nice and easy.
Let's give it a try.
Inhale, fingertips out,
left to right.
Wrists in line
with the shoulders.
Exhale, palms
together in prayer.
Drop the chin, inhale,
reach behind,
palms kiss as we reach
the hands all the way up
towards the sky.
And then exhale,
hands down to the heart.
Twice more, inhale,
send the fingertips out.
Spread the fingertips.
Good, exhale, palms
kiss together with energy.
Chin to chest,
reach behind, inhale,
full body experience,
reach for the sky.
And exhale, hands to heart.
Alright, one more time.
Let's slow it down
with the breath, inhale.
Send the hands out.
Exhale, palms kiss together.
Chin to chest, reach behind.
Inhale, full body stretch.
And exhale, hands to heart.
Beautiful, pause here,
close your eyes.
Take a cycle of
breath here to just observe.
Notice if you've shifted
your weight into the toes
or if you're back in the heels.
See if you can evenly
distribute your weight
between all 
four corners of the feet.
Just feel it out.
Nice, now drop the fingertips.
Interlace them behind you.
Knuckles are going to 
draw down and away
as we open up through the chest.
You might be a little sore
from our previous practices
so this should
feel good in the arms.
Soft bend in the knees,
we're not locked out here.
As you lift the heart,
keep lifting, lifting, lifting.
Then inhale, carve
a line with the nose,
forward, up and back.
Look up and back,
so slight back bend here
but we're not killing ourselves.
We're just nice and
steady here in our core.
Good, just play.
And then when you're ready,
slowly, we're gonna keep the bind
as we send our gaze
forward and down, heart follows.
And we're gonna come 
into a Forward Fold
with the bind,
reaching up towards the sky.
Keep pressing into all
four corners of the feet.
So remember to send
weight back into those heels.
We're here for one more breath.
Then as a friend
of mine likes to say,
resist the
slingshot effect here,
so with control, release the fingers,
the hands, the arms,
bring them all the way
down toward your feet.
Awesome, inhale, halfway lift,
follow your breath, sync it up.
Exhale to soften
and fold it back down.
Bend the knees, plant the palms.
Step one foot back,
then the other
so you're in a Plank Pose.
Inhale in here. 
Exhale, bend the elbows.
Keep them hugging
into the side body
as you lower all
the way to the belly.
Inhale with the breath,
we rise up, Cobra.
And exhale with the breath,
we float it down.
Curl the toes under,
inhale to all fours or Plank.
And then exhale,
hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Play with a nice long dog today.
So walk the toes out.
Once again, we'll bend the knees
and then lift the hip creases.
Really lift, lift, lift,
exaggerate that lift
from the hip creases 
up towards the sky.
Good, then you can
relax the heels down.
Take a deep breath in.
A long breath out.
On your next inhale,
lift the right leg up high.
Exhale, step it all the
way up into a nice lunge.
Inhale, lift your heart.
Get light on the
fingertips here.
Exhale, pivot on the back foot.
And we're gonna
open up to a Warrior I.
So big breath as you
come all the way up,
leading with the
left fingertips.
And then right
fingertips reaching forward,
front knee over front ankle.
Little Benji hair on my thigh.
The life, la vida.
Warrior II. 
Head over heart,
heart over pelvis here,
strong legs.
Pull the pinkies back.
Inhale, look forward.
Exhale, keep the
front knee bent.
We're gonna bring the
right elbow to the right thigh.
Left fingertips are gonna
go down and forward,
up and around.
Neck is nice and long.
Back inner thigh is charged.
Strong legs here.
Inhale to come forward
with the left fingertips.
And exhale to come
back and down and around.
And same thing here.
If you like, you can follow 
your left thumb with your gaze.
So we're syncing it all up here.
And this can be challenging,
so draw your navel in.
Strong legs, strong foundation
to help keep you stable.
Then we'll do one more.
And on the next time
you come down and around,
go ahead and come
all the way down.
Pivot on the back foot.
Left hand comes to the earth,
front knee over front ankle.
Inhale, right fingertips 
towards the sky.
Breathe into your
belly as we twist.
And then exhale,
right hand to the earth.
Step the right toes back.
Belly to Cobra or
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Move with your breath.
Inhaling to lift the heart.
And exhaling to make your
way to that Downward Facing Dog.
Nice long dog today.
Just playing with our patterns.
Just noticing and really
lifting up from the hip creases.
Good, on your next breath in,
inhale, lift the 
left leg up high.
Press into both palms evenly.
Good, exhale,
step it all the way up
into your nice low lunge.
Get light on the fingertips.
On your next inhale,
look forward.
Let your heart shine forward.
And then exhale,
plant the back foot,
right toes are turned in.
And here we go, leading
with the right fingertips,
inhale all the
way up to Warrior II.
Pull the pinkies back,
sink deep into that front leg.
Careful to not be
leaning forward here,
so draw the spine into a nice,
beautiful long line.
Stack it up.
Center yourself,
hug the low ribs in,
connect to that core.
Beautiful, inhale, 
look forward, nice and tall.
Exhale, right inner thigh 
is engaged as you press
into the outer
edge that right foot.
Inhale in again.
Exhale, bend the left elbow,
bring it to the
top of the left thigh.
Here we go, right fingertips,
go down, forward,
up and around.
Nice and slow.
Now synchronize with the breath,
inhaling as you come up.
Then exhaling as you
come around and down.
Maybe following your
right thumb with your gaze,
with your focus.
Strong long legs for balance.
Hug the low ribs in.
Draw the navel in 
and up for stability.
Engaging the core.
Alright, and the
next time you take it up
and back and down,
we'll pivot on the back foot.
Bring the right
hand to the earth.
And on your next inhale,
big twist,
left fingertips to the sky.
You're doing great,
big belly breath here.
And exhale, 
left hand comes down.
Step the left toes back.
This is our last
little vinyasa here.
So belly to Cobra or Chaturanga
to Upward Facing Dog,
you decide.
Move with your breath, way
to bring the breath by the way.
So cool.
We'll meet in one
last Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale in in Downward Dog.
And exhale out through the lips,
just like we did
in the beginning.
Once more like that.
Big inhale in through the nose.
And exhale through the lips.
And then slowly come
on to your knees here.
Swing the legs to
one side, any side.
Good thing I'm not
about to use this blanket
'cause Benji has just
claimed it for himself.
That's fine, 
you can have it, mi amor.
And here we go, 
a little seated Forward Fold.
So go ahead and take
your hands to the buttocks.
Move the cheeks aside. 
(laughs) So immature.
Bend the knees, it's fun to say.
It's a fun job, all right.
Inhale, reach the
fingertips up high.
Exhale, send them forward.
Try not to collapse
here in the upper back body,
but keep the heart lifted,
the chest open.
Kind of the way we've been doing
since the
beginning of this session.
Keep the heart lifted.
And then from here,
wherever the hands fall,
allow, right, embrace.
So hands can come 
to the knees, shins,
calves, ankles, feet.
Grab the toes,
maybe grab the big toe
with the middle finger,
index finger, and thumb.
Keep the chest open as we
work to straighten the leg,
they don't have 
to get straight today
or tomorrow or any day.
Just the intention
of lengthening here.
Now inhale with your breath.
Lift the chest a little more.
And now exhale,
slowly fold it down.
Knees can be bent as
generously as you like here.
So we are ending in a
seated Forward Fold today.
We'll close with a
Namaste of course,
but we're going to
spend a couple of deep, long
moments with the breath here.
So feel free to
bend those knees,
again, as generously 
as you need to.
Close your eyes.
And I just love Forward Folds,
really folding into yourself.
It's easier to listen to
the sound of your breath,
to let go
of our attachment
to things outside of us
or in front of us
or even behind us.
And really just fold 
kind of inward into
our being. (chuckles)
And the longer you stay here,
the more you may let go
of your resistance to
just kind of chewing on things
like folding
into your own being.
Just being with yourself
here for a couple of breaths
at the very least is
so good for the body.
Feeling the skin of
the back body stretch
as you breathe in.
Allowing the weight of the head
to relax a little
more as you breathe out.
And it's funny because
even if you're not necessarily
working on, "Okay, I'm
finding my true self here
in this Paschimottanasana,"
we're tending to the body,
which stores all kinds of,
right, energy and emotion.
So just by tending to
the body in these shapes we're
connecting to that inquiry.
It's all connected.
In my humble opinion.
Okay, take three
more quiet breaths here.
Count 'em out if you need to.
And after your third breath,
you can release 
the hands, the arms.
From the base of the spine,
start to lift some energy
awareness up through the belly,
the torso, the chest,
all the way up to the head
until you've rolled
all the way back up.
You can open the eyes.
Ah, it's a whole new world.
Cross the ankles,
let's come back to our seat.
I'll go butt to butt with Benji.
Not sure how this
will look in the frame,
but who cares, life is good.
Hands come together in prayer.
Week 1 in the books.
Our quest for
the breath continues
with a very yummy
practice tomorrow.
You do not want to miss Day 8.
It's a Yoga With
Adriene tradition to
have a very yummy Day 8
so I hope you will be
there for that in the meantime.
Take good care.
Follow your breath off the mat.
We'll close with an
inhale in together.
And then an exhale to
bow the head together.
And an invitation
here to whisper
Namaste.
(bright upbeat piano music)
