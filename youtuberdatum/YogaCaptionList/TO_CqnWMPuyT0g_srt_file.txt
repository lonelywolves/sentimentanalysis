- Hi everyone. 
Welcome to Yoga with Adriene.
I'm Adriene, this is Benji.
And today, 
we have a sweet little
meditation for self love.
So hop into something 
comfy and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Alrighty my friend,
we're going to begin in a
comfortable seat of your choice.
You can also do 
this video lying down.
I want you to feel comfortable.
And go to a position,
come into a 
position that feels good,
that feels supported.
So, I'm sitting up on a bolster
so that I can feel nice and
comfortable sitting up tall,
but you do you.
If you're sitting up, align
your head over your heart,
and your heart over your pelvis.
If you're lying down,
tuck you chin,
so that your 
neck is nice and long.
Then let's bring our 
left hand to our heart space
and our right 
hand to the low belly.
Gently allow your 
eyelids to get heavy,
close your eyes
and baby, let's take this time
to reset,
reconnect,
remember that
we are worthy,
worthy of love.
As we begin to tune in here,
trust that you 
made the right decision
selecting this video,
carving out just 
a little bit of time
and space to 
consider or reconsider
where you are right now.
And not only reconnect 
or remember with this fact,
in my mind this truth, 
that you are worthy of love.
But perhaps we open to 
taking it one step further,
and remembering or reconnecting
with the fact or the truth
that you are love.
Take a deep breath 
in wherever you are.
And a long breath
out wherever you are.
And now maybe 
with the eyes closed,
if they are not already, 
take another deep breath in.
Wherever you are,
just whatever's 
going on with you today.
And a long breath out.
So I'm definitely 
rolling out the red carpet here
for you to just come as you are,
with however you're feeling.
And then hopefully we 
can use this gentle process
either as preventative care
or a little rescue remedy
for you to know and feel 
that you are worthy of love,
and that you are in fact,
the love itself.
Inhale in.
Now on your next exhale,
just allow the hands to 
rest wherever it feels good.
Gently at your sides,
maybe palms on the 
knees or the thighs,
maybe fingertips 
resting gently on the ribs
if you're on your back.
Use the sound of my 
voice to guide you here,
so you can keep 
your eyes closed.
Relax your tongue 
down in your mouth.
Take a deep breath in.
Fill your belly with air.
And as you exhale, 
relax your shoulders.
Now starting at your feet,
send your 
awareness to your feet,
and just slowly 
taking a gentle body scan
noticing as you go 
up through the body,
all the way to your crown,
noticing if there 
are any tight places
or places that you 
might be holding or gripping.
See if you can detect 
any places in the body
physically or energetically,
where you might 
be able to soften,
blanket a little love.
Relax.
Inhale in deeply.
And exhale completely.
Continuing with the 
nice conscious breath.
Seeing if you can,
whatever this means to you,
breath like you love yourself.
Inhaling lots of love in.
And exhaling lots of love out.
Now if you stumbled 
across some areas,
either specifically physically,
maybe in the shoulders,
the low back, the hips,
or more energetically,
emotionally,
maybe in the heart space or
even in the head, the neck,
if you stumbled across a 
place that has felt tight
or is tight, congested,
use your breath,
this loving inhale
and this loving exhale,
to soften that area,
to smooth it out.
Send some love to that area.
Breathing in deep into 
the belly as you inhale.
Softening, blanketing 
the body in love
as you surrender on the exhale.
Continue to gently 
deepen your breath,
using it as a tool
to reside in 
the present moment.
Notice the 
thoughts that come up.
Acknowledge them 
and use the mantra
inhale lots of love in.
And exhale lots of love out.
Anchor the brain to refocus
on love.
You can use the mantra
inhale lots of love in.
Exhale lots of love out.
In repetition here.
And you can use it off the mat
when you wake up in the morning,
and before you 
go to bed at night.
Inhale lots of love in.
Exhale lots of love out.
Inhale lots of love in.
Exhale lots of love out.
Continue with your breath,
repeating the mantra 
a couple more times,
ingraining it, remembering it,
taking it as a tool
to reset and reconnect
with the truth that 
you are worthy of love,
and that in fact,
you are love.
If you're on your back,
tuck your chin again,
lengthen through 
the back of the neck.
If you're seated, 
use your next inhale
to lift your heart 
space a little bit more.
Inhale lots of love in.
Exhale lots of love out.
Inhale lots of love in.
Exhale lots of love out.
As you're ready,
gently bring the palms together,
Anjali Mudra at the heart.
Take a hot second, 
notice how you feel.
And as you're ready,
start to lift the corners 
of the mouth and smile,
even if it's a fake smile.
Allow your smile to 
grow a little bit bigger.
Take deep breath in.
A long breath out.
Flutter the eyelashes open.
Bring the thumbs up 
to the third eye,
quietly whisper,
I am worthy of love.
I am worthy of love.
Don't be shy.
Quietly whisper, affirm,
I am love.
I am love.
And then allow your 
head and your hands
to gently fold in, 
bowing towards your heart.
Thank you so much for 
sharing a little time with me
and with people 
all over the world.
You are not alone.
We're all in this together.
Let's take one more deep inhale.
Breathing in love.
Exhale, breathing out
yup, you guessed it, love.
Thanks everyone.
