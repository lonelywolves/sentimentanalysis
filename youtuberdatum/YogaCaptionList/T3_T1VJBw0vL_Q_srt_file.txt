- Hey everyone.
Welcome to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 22, Renew.
Let's get started.
(kisses Benji)
(bright upbeat piano music)
Alrighty, my friend,
let's begin standing today.
We have a short practice.
So in this shorty, we're
gonna get low, low, low, low,
just kidding,
we're not gonna get low.
We're going to get right to it.
And we're going
to use this practice
to contemplate on
what it means to renew.
Renew your
excitement for something,
renew a curiosity 
with your breath.
Maybe just remembering
your why, why you're here,
renewing your
commitment to this journey.
So stand up nice and tall,
anywhere on your mat.
Feel your awareness,
of course, spread
through all four corners
of your feet, but right away,
start to draw the energy up
that we've been working on.
So you find your integrity
in this shape right away.
And then when
you're ready, remember,
it's not what we
do but how we do it.
Focus on how you
bring the palms together.
Remembering all of
the wonderful vocabulary
that we have chewed on thus far.
Considering, maybe, 
how you move.
Perhaps noting that
how you move does matter.
And start to notice your breath.
Relax your shoulders. 
Just drop in.
Let's inhale in together.
When you're ready, 
big breath in through the nose,
here we go.
And out through the nose.
And we'll relax
the fingertips down.
Open the eyes, inhale, send the
fingertips out left to right.
Exhale, palms
together at the heart.
A little reverent,
bow in the head,
chin to chest, reach behind.
Inhale, reach all the
way up towards the sky,
slow and steady.
Trace your gaze all the way up.
Careful not to crutch
in the back of the neck,
and then exhale, float the
fingertips down nice and easy.
If you're feeling a
little unsteady here,
just step hip with apart.
Here we go again.
Inhale, send the
fingertips left to right.
Energy in your fingertips. 
Exhale, palms together.
Synchronizing, chin to chest.
Reach behind, inhale,
reach all the way up.
Carve a line with
the nose, all the way up.
And then exhale, press it down,
a little bit of energy
here as well, all the way down.
Marrying the
action to the breath,
the breath to the action.
Inhale, wrist and hands
in line with the shoulders.
Exhale, palms
together at the heart.
Chin to chest, reach behind.
You can retain the breath here,
Kumbhaka and then inhale,
reach for the sky, slow.
Good, exhale, float it down.
You can retain
the breath here too.
Inhale, halfway left to right.
Pause, exhale, pressing
palms together at the heart.
Chin to chest, 
retain the breath, reach behind.
Draw energy up from
the earth as you inhale,
reach for the sky.
And exhale,
flow with it down.
So we're working to create
a whole body experience here.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale, palms together.
Chin to chest, reach behind.
Inhale, lift it up, ground down.
And exhale, float it down.
Just three more times just
with the sound of your breath,
a moving meditation, inhale.
Exhale.
Inhale.
Exhale.
Slow it down, inhale.
Exhale.
Inhale.
And exhale.
Last one, inhale, halfway.
Exhale, Namaste.
Chin to chest,
reach behind, inhale.
Pause, hold, retain
the breath at the top.
And exhale float it down.
Mountain Pose, 
just observe your breath here.
Beautiful.
Walk the feet wide here.
Nice and wide, press into
the outer edges of the feet.
Toes are gonna point forward.
Inhale, send the
fingertips up, Star Pose.
Exhale, nice and slow.
We're gonna bend the knees,
send the hips back
and fingertips are gonna
reach just to the ground.
If you can touch, great,
if not, no worries.
Inhale, we reach for
the sky, lots of control.
And exhale, soft bend
the knees, hips back,
and we dip it down.
And we send it out, big inhale.
Exhale, down.
Big inhale, take up space.
With your breath, 
exhale, touch it down.
Three more, inhale,
open up, expansion.
Exhale, contraction,
navel draws in.
You have a lot
to play with here.
So inhale, stay curious,
renew that curiosity.
Exhale.
Don't get lazy. 
Inhale, you got it.
Don't decide
where it ends, exhale.
Reaching up, Star Pose, okay.
This time send
the left hand back,
right fingertips reach
towards the left toes.
If they touch, great,
if not, no worries.
We're all in
control with our center,
so it shouldn't really matter.
You got this, coming all
the way back up, inhale.
Exhale, twist to the other side.
Right fingertips back,
left fingertips
towards the right toes.
Here we go with the breath,
slow and steady, inhale.
Exhale, navel draws in.
Inhale, reach, take up space.
Exhale, twist.
Inhale, reach,
soft bend in the knees.
Lots of control here, exhale.
Inhale reach, and exhale.
Three more on each side,
inhale, and exhale.
Inhale, grounding through
the outer edges
of the feet. Exhale.
Inhale, spread the fingers.
Exhale.
Inhale, reach it up.
And exhale, twist.
Last one, inhale.
Exhale, twist.
Inhale.
Exhale, twist.
Good, inhale, Star Pose.
Exhale, bend the knees,
hop the feet together.
Palms come back to
heart center in prayer.
(sigh) Just notice 
how you feel.
Beautiful, then take the hands,
bring them to fist,
and we're just gonna
draw some circles one way
and then the other.
One way and then the other.
And I'll bring the
hands to the waist.
We're gonna lift
one heel, any heel.
We're gonna just rotate,
lift the toes and rotate.
Whoa, a symphony there,
a cacophony.
Rotate the ankle one
way and then the other.
And you know this, of course,
we can always use a piece of
furniture or wall to help you
when we're working on one leg.
'Til one day, you're like,
"Whoa, all of this is 
so integrated, I got this."
And then switch.
Nice, bring the feet together,
really together.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Right hand grabs the left wrist.
Think up and over, as you
bump the hips to the left.
Spiral your heart
up towards the sky.
Reach, reach, reach, inhale in.
Exhale, navel
draws in to center.
We come back, 
we reach both fingertips up,
and over to the other side.
Spiral the heart, keep breathing,
hug the lower ribs in.
Dig into the heels.
Inhale, big stretch.
Big breath, and then
exhale back to center.
Wiggle the fingertips,
rain it down,
and we're gonna step to
the top of our mat.
When you get there right away,
big inhale to reach up.
Exhale, soft fingers,
as we bend the knees
and slowly take it down.
Inhale lifts you up
halfway with your breath.
Follow the breath.
Exhale, cascading down.
Bend the knees, plant the palms.
Step one foot back,
then the other.
Inhale in for Plank Pose 
and then exhale
send the hip creases up high
and back for
Downward Facing Dog.
Feel free to pedal it
out here for a breath or two,
and then we'll find stillness
hugging our low ribs in,
feeling that connection, 
that containment.
Renew your commitment
to slow mindful breathing here.
Head is below the heart,
can easily change our breath
but we use our mindfulness,
our awareness to control.
Claw through your fingertips
and on your next inhale,
lift the right leg up high.
Exhale, bend your right knee.
And you're gonna stack your
right hip over your left hip,
kind of opening up
through the right side body.
So we've been squaring the hips
and now we can
stack it, open it up.
You might rotate the ankle again
one way and then the other.
Look underneath your 
right armpit chest, breathe in.
And then breathe out,
slowly bring the leg 
all the way through
and up to your lunge.
Pivot on the back foot,
Warrior I, here we come.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Big breath, big stretch.
Front knee is bent.
Good, and then
we'll rain it down here.
Interlace the
fingertips behind the back.
Draw the knuckles down
towards your left heel
and open up through the chest.
Hug the low ribs in, inhale in.
And then exhale,
peel the right hip crease back.
Begin to look forward,
send your heart forward.
Keep the spine
nice and long here.
We're pulling the
right hip crease back.
Inhale in, stay here or exhale,
you might go a little bit
further dropping
the head down in space.
Knuckles reaching up towards
the sky for Humble Warrior.
Right hamstring, turned on
here parallel with the mat.
Left inner thigh
engaged for support.
Take one more deep breath in.
Then exhale, use that power, 
the exhale, to rise back up.
Beautiful, we'll
straighten that front leg,
send the fingertips 
out left to right, inhale in.
And exhale, start to bring 
the right fingertips down
as you send the left
fingertips up towards the sky.
Inhale in deeply here.
Exhale to hug
the low ribs in
and spiral your heart
up towards the ceiling.
Triangle, good, inhale
in here, nice long neck.
Exhale, use the power of that
exhale to bring you back up.
Keep that front leg straight
as you reach the right
fingertips all the way back.
Good, inhale in. 
Exhale, bend the front knee,
cartwheel it all
the way back down.
Beautiful, find your twist here.
Right fingertips reach up,
back knee lowered or lifted,
your choice.
And then exhale,
right hand to the earth.
Step the right toes back,
lower on to the belly.
Inhale, baby Cobra,
keep it chill.
And then exhale to release.
Press back to 
all fours or Plank.
Meet me in 
Downward Facing Dog.
Alright, same little
sequence on the other side.
Renew your focus.
After this, we're gonna 
take it to the ground, relax.
Okay, inhale, 
left leg lifts up high.
Bend the left knee,
stack the hips.
Keep pressing into
your left palm here.
Inhale in again.
Exhale, gently step the 
left foot all the way up.
Take your time here.
Pivot on the back foot.
When you feel ready, inhale,
sweep the arms up 
and overhead, Warrior I.
Find that strong focus forward,
hug the low ribs in, 
find that connection
to your center,
that containment.
Then here we go,
inhale in, maybe look up.
Exhale, wiggle the fingertips,
bring them down.
Interlace behind
the back of the head.
Knuckles draw down
towards the right heel,
as we open up through the chest.
And nice and slow,
navel draws in.
We begin to lean forward.
Should feel really
strong in the back leg here.
So the root of this posture
is really in that back
leg strong and steady.
Opening up, 
nice flat back position.
Stay here or continue the
journey all the way down.
Crown on the head 
aiming towards the earth,
Humble Warrior.
Breathe.
Right inner thigh is engaged.
And then inhale in,
use the power of this
exhale to rise back up.
Beautiful,
straighten that front leg,
release the arms,
fingertips reach front and back,
inhale in, lift up
out of your waist.
So get long in the spine.
And then exhale, peel the 
left hip crease back
as you slowly tilt forward.
Neck is an
extension of the spine here.
Triangle Pose, 
left fingertips reach down
to the earth to the block.
Or I honestly have been guiding.
You have that center connection.
We're working on
the core strength,
but you have that
center connection
to maybe let the arm hang here.
Maybe just for a breath.
Right fingertips reaching 
up high towards the sky.
Neck is nice and long,
inhale in, spiral your heart all
the way up towards 
the ceiling as you exhale.
Inhale in again.
And then use the
power of that exhale
to slowly bring
you back up, gorgeous.
Front leg stays straight,
left fingertips
reach high towards the sky,
and then all the way back.
Big breath, big stretch.
Reverse Triangle,
and then exhale,
cartwheel it all the way back
down to the front of your mat.
Pivot on the back foot.
Here's our twist
right hand on the earth.
Left fingertips
reach up towards the sky.
Big breath in,
back knee lowered or lifted.
Good, and then exhale,
bring it back down, lovely.
Step it back, inhale in here.
Exhale all the way to the belly.
Inhale, baby Cobra.
And exhale to release.
Okay, we're gonna
come onto the elbows here
and we're gonna bend the
right knee like a little frog leg.
You're gonna bring 
your right knee up.
And we're just gonna
hang out here for a breath.
Inhale.
And exhale.
Yes, and then we're gonna take
the right hand to the earth.
Take the left hand,
thread the needle.
So it's gonna go in
and underneath the
bridge of the right arm.
And then we're gonna open
up the right arm to the sky
and out, and we're gonna flip
onto our backs and
boom we're in a twist.
You can use your left
hand to kind of guide
the outer edge of the right leg
a little further into the twist,
should feel good.
And then you can turn 
onto your right ear here,
grounding down
through the right shoulder
and breathe into your belly.
Feeling this yummy release
in the right hip, right glute.
The piriformis here,
the IT band, it's all good stuff.
You can find soft, easy 
movement here up and down
with the knee too if you like,
or you can just relax
the weight of your body
into the earth as you breathe.
And you can stay here breathing
or we're gonna
bend the left knee.
Listen carefully, take the
right hand, grab the right toes.
If available, if not,
if you're like ha ha ha,
not renewing that license,
then leave it alone.
If you took the
grip of the left toes,
go ahead and release that,
then everyone
straighten both legs,
rock back on to your belly.
Little Martha Graham move.
Reset, come to the elbows,
and we'll take it
to the other side.
So left hand on the earth,
right fingertips come in
and underneath the
bridge of the left arm.
We continue this motion,
opening up with the left hand,
all the way up to the sky.
You might have to shimmy
to center yourself on your mat.
Right leg is straight,
now left knee is bent.
I use my right palm to guide
myself into this yummy twist.
And then maybe turning
onto the left ear here,
breathing into the belly.
Start to relax.
Remember why you
started this journey.
Think about why you're here.
Why you thought, right?
Sometimes you think you know
why you show up for something
and then it turns out
to be another reason.
So staying open of course.
Bend the right knee,
we might reach to
grab the right toes here.
Just a little bind, or no,
breathing deep could feel good,
if it doesn't, don't do it.
And if you took the
bind of the right toes,
go ahead and release that.
Everyone release the legs.
This time you're
gonna stay on your back.
So shimmy your hips to center
or shimmy my shirt to center,
sorry about that, okay. (laughs)
Let's keep this G.
Or Yoga With Adriene is like PG-13.
Anyway, it's G.
Here we are on our backs.
Lengthen through
the back of the neck.
Relax your arms,
close your eyes, my dear.
And honestly, 
take a loving breath in,
and then just let everything go.
Let's take a second
to completely let go,
get heavy in the body.
You can let your
eyelids get heavy,
and just take a
moment to relax everything.
Just be
embodying this beautiful,
perfect vision of yourself,
of who you really are.
If you're holding or
clenching in any area,
the jaw, the fingers, ankles,
the glutes, the belly.
See if you can
soften and let go.
And just allow for
three more breaths here.
I love the mantra
for a moments like these
"Allow, release, and let go."
Then gently deepen your breath.
And let it be
like the ocean waves.
Just lifting up with the inhale,
and falling with the exhale.
And then slowly
kiss the palms together.
Palm to palm is
holy palmer's kiss.
Bring the thumbs
right up to the third eye.
You can give yourself a
little self massage here,
massaging between
the brows a little bit,
up and down, 
left to right, circular motion.
And then I'll invite you
to take one last
breath here with me.
Inhale in.
Nice conscious exhale 
to close our ritual.
I look forward to seeing 
you tomorrow. Thank you.
Namaste.
