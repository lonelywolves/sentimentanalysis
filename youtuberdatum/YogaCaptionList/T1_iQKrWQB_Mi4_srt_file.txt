- Hi, everyone, welcome to Home,
your 30-day yoga journey.
Today is Day 7,
the day in which
we take a break off the wrists
and we stretch it all.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alright pals, today 
we're gonna begin standing.
Your version.
Go ahead and come to the center
of your mat and depending on how
your mat's oriented to 
the screen that you're using,
you can kind of move it if you
need to now so you can see me.
Otherwise, as always, please,
thank you so 
much for trusting me.
Just use the sound of 
my voice to guide you.
And together we shall make
our way back home today starting
with a little love for 
the shoulders and the traps.
So you spend a lot of 
time on your wrists yesterday.
We're gonna spend some time off
the wrists today and tomorrow.
So I got you.
Thank you for showing up.
Here we go.
You're gonna take your right
hand to your left shoulder,
left neckline and you're going
to use your fingers to just kind
of press a little kneading
effect up and down
through the neck line here.
And obviously, this will be a
little different for everyone so
just feel around in there.
And today's 
practices called Stretch,
but I'd like to 
immediately ask you to just
kind of stretch your mind.
We're not just 
focusing on the body here.
This is our yoga practice
so we are uniting the mind and
the body with one other thing,
and that is this notion, if you
will, or this essence of spirit.
That part of you 
that is not your body,
it's not your brain, it's this 
part that is uniquely you.
And we'll just put 
it that way for now.
So consider that as we 
move through our practice,
we are going to 
give you a nice, sweet,
stretchy little ditty.
But I find the best way to
remember to connect to that
spirit or that soul or 
whatever you want to call it,
this essence that's 
not your your body
and not the story 
that your mind tells
but this other thing, 
if you will.
I think the best 
way to tap into that
'cause it can be 
kind of esoteric thing.
We're still massaging here,
get in there.
I think the best way 
to tap into that is
by treating your breath
with a little more respect.
So it's cool, 
this is a practical tool.
By paying 
attention to the breath,
by bringing more loving 
awareness to the breath,
I feel like we have a direct
line to connect to this
essence that feels, you know,
more true, more like us.
Alright, switch. Left hand
comes to the right shoulder.
So if you haven't already,
begin to gently 
deepen your breath.
Activating the 
breath as a means of yes,
improving the health and
well-being of the mind and body,
but also like 
stirring up this essence
that's, this part of you
that's not just 
your physical body,
not just those muscles that need
a good stretch or a mind that
needs to become calm,
more calm or still.
Just a little 
food for thought today,
stretching, you know,
our mind's eye,
our imagination, our awareness
a little further beyond
just maybe the physical body.
And if not, 
then let me tell you,
you're going to get 
a good stretch on today
and that's wonderful as well.
We're giving a little 
massage to the right neck line,
shoulder line, 
this big trap muscle.
And as you continue 
here on the right side,
we're also deepening the breath.
You can just notice if you're
locked out in the knees here.
Maybe that is a 
tendency and that's a-okay
but you can start to soften.
Maybe you notice you're carrying
a little bit of your weight in
the back of your feet 
or maybe in the front.
Or maybe we notice the pattern
of the toes turned out which is
no problem or 
the toes turned in,
all good but maybe we can
experiment with toes pointing
forward, soft bend in the knees,
finding that lift up through the
front, and as we release the
hands gently to our sides,
finding that grounding 
energy through the back.
And we're just
kind of turning on, right?
Lighting up, 
activating this awareness,
this body awareness
from the soles of the feet
all the way up to the crown.
I'm gonna leave it to you to
find that breath awareness.
Good and then on 
your next inhale
send the fingertips out 
left to right, big stretch.
And all the way 
up towards the sky.
Big breath.
And then as you exhale, go ahead
and float 'em all the way down.
Fingertips are going to
interlace behind your tailbone.
You can square 
off at the wrist here.
Should feel really good 
after yesterday's practice
or you can even work 
to bring the palms together
shoulder blades 
really drawing in.
So maybe you don't 
come here just yet.
Maybe we can work 
towards this bind.
In the meantime, you can work
nice and open here in the palms,
squaring the wrists.
Both really beneficial.
And then find that 
nice tall Mountain Pose,
reinvigorate your breath.
Inhale in.
Exhale, drop your chin to your
chest and actively draw your
knuckles down 
towards your heels.
Soften through the forehead,
soften your jaw.
Then inhale, lift the chin
back parallel to the floor,
release the fingertips 
and with a big breath in
reach up towards the sky.
Excellent, this time 
palms come together,
we interlace the fingertips up
and overhead and then you can
keep the index 
fingers extended here.
We call this steeple grip,
reaching up high.
Dig into all four 
corners of the feet,
especially the heels if 
you live in your toes a lot,
which a lot of people do, and
we're gonna take it nice and
easy over to the right side as
you bump the hips 
actively to your left.
So we're reaching to the right
as we bump the 
hips actively to the left.
Big, big, big stretch.
Inhale, lift the chin slightly.
Exhale from center.
Come all the way back through.
Good, inhale, 
stand a little taller.
Ground through the feet.
Exhale, tip it over to the left.
Actively reaching right 
hip bone towards the right.
Here we go, hug the 
low ribs in you got this.
Pull the thumbs back.
Inhale, lift your 
chin just slightly.
And then exhale from 
your core from center,
come all the 
way back up through.
Beautiful.
Inhale to reach for the sky.
Exhale, float 
the fingertips down.
We're gonna interlace 
behind the back again.
This time see if you can
take the opposite thumb on top.
So even if you don't remember,
just feel it out.
It's gonna be the one 
that feels a little funky.
A little weird, 
which weird is good.
In my humble opinion.
What do you think, Benji?
He said keep it weird, okay.
Opening up through the chest,
stretching through the forearms,
little wrist love here.
Little bit unique to everyone,
not a little bit,
very unique to everyone, so it's
hard to do kind of a one size
fits all I've realized 
in this experience with
Yoga With Adriene has really 
I think made me a better teacher
and taught me 
just how true this is.
So honor the natural
curvature of your spine but
there is a tendency maybe
here to let the pelvis tilt out.
So you might consider 
lengthening your tailbone down
and it might feel like your hip
points are going up high towards
the sky when you do that.
Just getting your 
center underneath you.
Okay, inhale in here.
Exhale, listen carefully.
You're going to bend your knees.
Now we'll take 
the hips way back.
You're going to draw a big line
with the knuckles all the way up
towards the ceiling as 
you come into a Forward Fold.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
You can bend your knees as
generously as you like here.
And then the shoulders are kind
of going to want to defy gravity
here as you reach the 
knuckles up towards the sky.
So we find a little lift up and
out of that ball and socket for
three, you're doing great.
Two, careful to not 
hold in the neck here.
Don't want to create 
any unnecessary tension.
And on the one, bend the knees,
dig into the heels,
roll it back up and simply
release back to your Mountain.
Excellent.
Pause, just observe the breath.
What if that were true?
What if we could 
consider the breath our spirit?
So instead of breathing deep
or mastering these pranayama
techniques, because that is
what we're told to do in yoga,
we peel back one 
more layer of the onion
and we see that there's
always a why behind the doing
and that it can 
be unique to us all
and we can also share meaning
but what if your 
breath were your spirit?
Day 7.
Okay.
We're gonna step
the feet nice and wide.
You guys get what I'm saying?
So it's not like, "Oh, Adriene
told me to breathe deep and
"breathing deep is good for me."
It's like, why?
What is that connection 
and what can it do for you?
If you were to just 
maybe stretch your mind,
open your mind a little 
bit beyond just the task.
Oh, yeah, we're going home.
We're going 
there this year, guys.
Turn your big toes in.
Really press into the 
outer edge of the feet.
If your mat's a 
little bit slippery,
this is common,
use what you got, baby.
There is this strong, powerful
tool of the midline to kind of
actually like it's almost like a
superhero vibe where
instead of just spilling 
into the earth, right,
we're creating this yielding.
We're lifting up.
This is also how we take a lot
of pressure out of the joints in
many of these postures.
Okay, speaking of the superhero,
go ahead and bring your 
hands to the waistline here.
Just pay attention.
What's going on in the hips,
in the pelvis?
Is it coming in?
Are we sitting here?
Ey!
Or can we kind of 
stack up through the spine?
Alright, inhale in.
Keep the hands on the hips.
I'm going to come to the back
edge here but you're probably
fine wherever you are.
Try to keep this 
open as we inhale in.
Use the image of leaning 
forward to look into a pond
to kind of keep this open.
Elbows are gonna draw back,
best you can.
Neck is gonna be nice and long,
just like we do in that halfway
lift in our Sun Salutations.
And we're finding that 
nice straight line here.
Now, you may come here before 
the spine starts to round
and so just stay here.
So I've been practicing long.
I can send my sits bones back.
I can hug my front body kind of
up defying gravity to meet my
back body and create 
this nice flat back position.
But just play and then notice
how your breath has 
kind of disappeared.
This conscious,
deep, full breath.
Bring it back in.
Excellent, now 
ground through the feet.
Draw energy up from the arches
of the feet through the inseam
of the legs and slowly 
begin to rise back up
with that flat back 
position in mind.
Yay! Excellent.
Alright, from here we're 
gonna bring the heels in
and keep the toes out.
You might bring your stance in
just a little bit more so that
your feet are just a little
bit wider than hip width apart.
Alright, hands are to 
come to the thighs here.
This should feel good after
yesterday's Ignite practice.
You're going to take your hands
to the tops of the thighs sink
deep down into this 
Goddess or God-like pose,
also known as Horse Pose.
And we're just gonna 
slowly get down real low.
Start to wake up
these beefy muscles, the quads.
And then inhale in,
lift your chest, your heart.
Exhale, you're gonna dip your
right shoulder down towards the
center, coming in through
center as you twist to the left.
So there's a little bit of a
tendency to collapse right ear
to right shoulder here.
I see it all the time.
But you guys have your awareness
from the crowd to the tail to
play with here and 
it's gonna help you
get a better twist 
in that mid back.
This is part of the back that
doesn't get a lot of
movement, in my opinion.
So we're here.
We're also 
stretching these beautiful,
yummy muscles 
in the front line that
we fired up yesterday.
Inhale to come back to center.
If you can, try to stay nice and
low if the legs are tired or if
you're waking up these muscles
for the first time in a long
time, you can 
straighten the legs.
It's not cheating.
It's listening to your body.
And we're going to 
take it to the other side.
Still with the shoulders.
Find the yumminess, that 
stretch in the upper back.
Try to keep the 
neck nice and long.
Hug low ribs in.
Again, we're trying 
to get a twist in
that thoracic spine as well.
If the knees are coming in here,
use your tools from 
all your Warriors.
Press in to the 
outer edges of your feet.
Take one more breath,
sink nice and low.
And then back to center,
feel free to straighten 
the legs here.
We're gonna take it 
one more time to each side
and just listen to
the sound of your breath.
Back to center if 
you haven't already,
taking it to the right.
Mhmmm, mhmmm
and then back 
to center, here we go.
We'll rise up strong, the 
toes are going to stay out.
You might widen your stance for
this one if you want to really
take up space, 
which I encourage.
Here we go, Star Pose.
Think of just the 
big X marks the spot.
Lengthen tailbone down.
Shoulder blades 
in together and down.
Upward current of 
energy through the front body.
If you feel comfortable here,
close your eyes.
Feel your breath lift you.
And feel the exhale, 
soften the shoulders.
Again, use the 
inhale to fuel an expansion.
And use your exhale to 
feel a softening, a surrender.
Do one more on your own.
You got this.
See what happens.
Beautiful, slowly 
float the hands down.
We'll take them 
back to the waistline.
Alright, so toes now 
I'm going to turn forward.
So we did out, 
we did in, now forward.
Reset through the 
spine nice and long.
Soft bend in the knees.
Here we go.
You're going to inhale, reach
the arms all the way up towards
the sky, big breath.
Exhale, nice and easy.
We're gonna 
take the left fingertips
all the way towards 
the right toes.
Keep your right 
arm reaching up high.
Great, inhale, come 
back all the way up,
fingertips reach 
towards the sky.
Exhale, right 
fingertips to left toes.
So most of us are like,
"Oh, I've done this 
in gym class before."
But can you bring all of the
vocabulary that we've learned
together thus far 
into this little dance?
Inhale, reach up high.
Exhale, slow and steady,
draw your navel in and up.
Shine your butt to the back.
Think of the body 
as one moving part here.
Just see what that does
and careful not to rush it.
So we're going back and forth.
Find your own rhythm.
I'm not going to cue it, but
you're going to inhale to center
and exhale to twist.
And moving with a nice, 
honorable breath helps here.
If for some 
reason today you are,
maybe you're on the 
road in a hotel room.
You're practicing.
Home is where the heart is.
Maybe you're not 
actually at your physical home.
If space is tight, you can
do this nice and underneath
yourself as well.
So keep it going.
If you can find a nice audible
breath here for this last round.
And just a little 
micro bend in the knees,
my friends, careful not to lock.
Okay, go ahead and even it out.
One more on each side.
And then I'll meet 
you back at the top.
Inhale, reach of the sky.
You're gonna heel-toe, heel-toe,
very ancient philosophical
yogic move.
Heel-toe, heel-toe your feet
so that your heels are right
underneath your hips.
Volcano Pose.
Palms face each other as 
if you're holding a sphere.
Thumbs back, pinkies forward.
Keep 'em up, you got this.
Hug the low ribs in.
Find that 
containment in your middle.
Good, inhale in.
Exhale, slow and steady,
just the right arm comes down.
And slow and steady 
left arm all the way down.
Mountain Pose, Tadasana.
Great work.
Okay, now we're gonna 
step to the top of the mat,
nice and slow.
Zip the legs together,
really together.
Feel the zip.
(chuckles)
There's a theater game, 
"Zip, Zap, Zop," if you know it.
I'm sorry, (laughs) 
no, just kidding.
If you know it 
tell us in the comments.
I love it.
Okay, shifting our 
weight to the right foot.
Peel the left heel up,
just the left heel.
Interlace the fingertips.
You're gonna lift 
your left knee up
as if it were on a
marionette string.
Use your core
and we're just gonna
squeeze that left 
knee up and in.
You should feel nice 
stretch in the left glute.
Squeeze, squeeze,
squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
Rotate the right ankle 
one way and then the other.
And then here stay where you are
or option to open it up to the
left just a little bit.
Digging into all four 
corners of that right foot.
We're here or 
opening up just a bit.
Great, and then slowly release.
Zip the legs together,
find your midline.
And then same 
thing on the other side.
Shifting weight,
spreading it evenly through
all four corners 
of your left foot.
Activate.
Activate and then 
lift your right heel first.
Then the marionette string.
I have my middle, 
my center involved.
Then squeeze and lift, rotate
the ankle if it feels right.
Then stay here tagging
a little weight down
in the shoulders or the elbows.
Option to open it up here, maybe
hooking right elbow to the right
knee or using your hand.
If you fall off balance way
to give it your best effort.
Way to have fun and way to
throw yourself off balance.
Alright, let that go.
Zip up the legs super tight.
Big inhale to reach for the sky.
Palms kiss together.
Jai Namaste and we 
take it all the way down,
Forward Fold.
Breathe here.
Bend your knees.
Feel that 
stretch in the low back.
Awesome.
Inhale, catch a wave,
halfway lift here.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Inhale, reach for the sky,
ground through the feet.
Big breath, big stretch.
Exhale, hands to heart.
Shift your weight 
to your right foot.
Peel your left heel up high.
This time we're gonna 
lift the the left toes up,
left heel and we might reach
behind to catch the left ankle
or the top of the left foot.
Then squeeze your left knee in,
get that great stretch 
through the quad,
lengthen tailbone down, 
as we discussed before,
to feel more
spaciousness and ultimately
more impactful stretch, perhaps.
A more sensational stretch.
One singular 
sensation (humming).
He takes it.
We're balancing, Adriene.
Here we go.
Go ahead and flip your 
hand to the left inner arch
or you can keep it 
there when gonna start
to kick this left foot 
back nice and slow.
Take your right hand forward
to balance, your choice.
Palms face up or palm face down.
Then we'll take 
the heart forward.
Just focus on the sensation,
the journey.
We'll visit this posture again
along this ride.
Just kicking left foot out,
opening up through the chest.
Use that inhale to really
expand, expand, expand.
And exhale to ground.
Good, and then 
slowly reel it back in.
Hug the left knee 
up into the chest.
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
And then release.
Right into the other side.
Zip the legs up tight.
Stand up tall, breathe in.
Breathe out.
Lift the right heel.
And here we go, 
lifting the right toes.
We're gonna grab the top of
the foot or the ankle first.
Get that big stretch in the
front of the right 
hip crease, the quad.
Shoulders stay relaxed,
heart lifted.
You might just work here today.
If we're working on a 
little balance and stability,
you might use a wall or a chair
or a piece of furniture to just
be here and work with 
some of this vocabulary.
So try not to get 
discouraged. Right?
Work with what you got and
stay present with yourself 
on this ride back home.
We got this.
Here we go.
Option to flip the hand 
to the right inner arch.
Squeeze that right knee in,
inhale in.
Find the lift.
Let your breath lift.
Exhale, we start to 
kick the right foot out.
Soft bend that standing leg.
You got this.
Here we go.
Experimenting on the other side,
using the breath to lift and
expand in and using 
the exhale out to ground.
Soften, balance it out.
Soften.
Beautiful.
One more breath here,
you got it, inhale.
And that exhale from center,
navel draws in.
That's what reels everything all
the way back in 
like a fishing line.
And we'll squeeze 
the right knee up and in.
Stack up through the 
spine and then ever so gently,
best you can, place 
that right foot down.
Awesome.
Here we go.
From here, send the 
fingertips out left to right.
Big inhale.
Capture some magic.
Bring it in.
Namaste, palms together.
Twice more like that.
Inhale, out.
Gather it up.
And bring it back in.
And now you know the action,
you can soften your gaze or
close your eyes 
for this last one.
Here we go.
Inhale, spread the fingertips.
Take up space.
Remember that Star Pose?
Reach all the way 
up towards the sky.
And then bring it back down
inward towards your heart.
Towards home.
Pause.
Observe.
Just notice.
Thank you for sharing your time
and your amazing energy with me
and all of the people who
showed up for practice today,
Day 7.
Take a deep breath in.
And as you exhale, 
bow your head to your heart.
Tomorrow is a wonderful day
(chuckles)
so please don't miss it, Day 8.
But in the meantime, thank you.
I wish you well.
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
