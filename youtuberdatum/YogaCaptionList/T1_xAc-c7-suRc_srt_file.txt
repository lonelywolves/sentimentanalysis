- Hi, everyone.
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 29. Intuit.
I'm into it.
Are you into it?
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alrighty, my friend, welcome.
Today we're gonna 
begin in one of three shapes,
I'll let you choose.
Lying down flat on your back.
Seated, 
cross-legged or kneeling.
So kneeling, 
sitting or lying down.
And that's how we're going
to start our intuit practice.
Kind of right away connecting
brain and body and remembering
in particular with the home
yoga practice that there is this
beautiful, beautiful 
relationship that you have with
yourself in making
decisions on the mat, right?
I think that we always have that
beautiful relationship going
but particularly 
with at-home yoga,
it's kind of magnified in
the most beautiful way.
So, that said, take it away.
Sitting, kneeling or lying down.
And if you feel indecisive,
just notice that.
That's what it's all about.
When you come 
into your position,
the one that you have chosen,
go ahead and allow your gaze to
soften or your eyes to close.
And together here Day 29,
my lucky number,
we celebrate this 
relationship to self.
This opportunity to listen.
Listen to that 
inner voice, right?
That higher self.
You might even think of 
it as your inner teacher.
I'm so honored 
to be here with you.
I'm honored to 
guide the practice.
But today, 
a loving invitation to really
hug up to that inner voice.
And practice
listening
to that inner teacher.
As my friend Kim and I say,
"Listen to your guts,"
and get in the habit of 
having a relationship,
right, to intuition.
If you have not already, begin
to gently deepen your breath.
Honoring the breath 
as this power tool for
getting close to 
that inner voice,
getting closer to home.
(chuckles) Riding 
the breath is like
taking the taxi home.
Taxi!
Take a deep breath in.
Wherever you are 
exhale out through the mouth.
Inhale in.
And out through the mouth.
And one more, 
big full breath in.
Sigh it out.
(sighs)
And if you're lying down,
begin to make your way back up.
If you're seated, 
let's come forward.
We're all gonna make our 
way to a nice Tabletop Position
where right away 
I want you to find a
little spinal flexion 
but you do you.
So listen to your body.
Maybe you work with 
the structure of Cat-Cow.
Maybe right away you start to
find a little freedom 
within the form.
(floor creaks)
Creaky old floor comin' out to
play just like 
the good ol' days.
Listen to the 
sound of your breath.
And if your body or your
energy is like saying get funky,
then get funky.
Move the hips in 
some big circles.
If your heart's feeling heavy,
maybe you come to
Extended Child's Pose 
here for a couple of breaths.
Any stagnant energy,
super tired,
not so sure you can make 
it through this practice
maybe you do big circles.
Finding your spinal flexion
as you create big circles.
Maybe the abdominals are sore so
you come all the 
way through to a Cobra.
Maybe the wrists needs some love
so you take a second here amidst
moving the spine and check in
with the forearms, the wrists.
So dabbling in a 
bit of freestyle,
but I'm I'm very careful 
with that word because
there is a mindfulness
and you have 
this incredible vocabulary,
this tool belt so far that we've
created together to work with.
So freestyle is fine.
Maybe it's not a free for all.
Okay, take a 
couple more breaths.
Keep exploring here.
Don't decide where it ends.
And then in your own time,
make your way 
to Downward Facing Dog.
And when you get there,
same thing.
Don't decide where it ends.
Embody it.
Listen.
Pay attention, respond.
And then we'll 
do the same thing,
we'll bend the knees 
and in your own time,
make your way to the top,
but really feel your 
way through this transition.
Then we'll meet in a Forward
Fold at the top of the mat.
Now bend your knees, so much
so that your belly comes to the
tops of the thighs or 
toward the tops of the thighs.
Then take your 
fingertips to the earth.
You're gonna 
bring your right fingertips
right below your face.
Take the left hand 
to the low back
and then pull your 
left hip crease up
as you straighten
through the left leg
but keep the right knee bent.
Big breath in.
Long breath out.
Bend your left knee.
Left hand replaces the right
fingertips or palm on the earth.
Right hand comes to 
the low back sacrum.
And then here we go, 
pulling the right hip crease up,
straightening 
through the right leg,
spiraling your 
heart towards the right.
Keep the shoulders relaxed.
Left knee is bent.
Right leg is straight.
Good, then slowly release.
Soft bend in both knees 
as you tuck the chin
and enjoy this move, 
this transition.
Really listen, listen, listen,
as you roll up, 
stacking through the spine.
Mountain Pose, Tadasana.
Take a deep breath in here,
stand up nice and tall.
As you exhale, of course,
use that breath out 
to relax the shoulders.
And then here's the deal,
take whatever you need here.
Soft, easy movement in the head,
the neck, the shoulders.
Feel free to 
fix your pantaloons,
move your shirt around but
let's try to get in the habit of
taking what we need
and then leaving behind 
what we don't need.
So we're really getting in the
habit of taking only what we
need and not more 
than what we need.
Metaphor for life.
Okay.
So we may not need all
these fidgety moments each time
we come to Mountain.
And if you do need it, take it.
That's my teaching style.
(laughs) Okay. I love you.
Here you go, inhale,
reach for the sky.
Exhale, listen carefully.
Interlace the fingertips,
keep the thumbs extended.
You're gonna bring the hands,
thumbs extended behind the head.
Elbows nice and wide.
So you have your 
neck hammock here,
your little neck cradle.
Good, then inhale 
to lift the sternum,
ground through all 
four corners of the feet.
Elbows draw back.
Exhale, you're gonna 
drop your right elbow down,
take your left 
elbow up towards the sky.
Put some weight in your heels.
Then inhale,
come all the way up, look up.

down towards the earth,
and when you're ready 
on your next inhale,
lift and lengthen, 
nice flat back position.

Inhale, spread the fingertips,
reach towards the sky.
And exhale floate it all the

And exhale to release.

slowly to the earth.

Inhale to 
look forward, shift forward.
Exhale all the way to the belly.
Can also do Chaturanga here.

through the left heel,

Inhale in.
Exhale, open, Warrior II.
Alright, keep 
the front knee bent.
Here we go, Peaceful Warrior.

And then on the exhale, 
straighten the front leg,
tip it forward, 
send your hips back,

Feel free to bring your left
hand to left waistline here.
Keep your gaze straight down.
Or begin to 
spiral your heart up,
maybe taking left fingertips
all the way up towards the sky.
Lengthening through 
the crown of the head.
You got this.
Hug those low ribs in.
Strong and steady.
Stay focused. 
Inhale in.
On your exhale, 
let's slowly begin to look down.
Bring the left fingertips
down to frame the right foot.
Bend your right knee and we're
gonna use soft bend in the knee
joint to step that 
back foot up, Pyramid Pose.
We got this. Keep pulling 
the right hip crease up.
Alright, now slowly walk 
your right fingertips forward
about six inches in front 
of your right pinky toe.
Then we're gonna 
lift up off the left heel
as if we were coming 
into standing splits.
But today we're gonna keep 
a soft bend in the right knee.
We're gonna inhale in, 
find center as you exhale.
So find that contraction and
we're gonna start to stack the
left hip over the 
right here for Half Moon.
You can use both 
fingertips on the earth
or we'll bring the 
left hand to the left waistline.
Alright, stay active 
in the left toes.
Imagine pressing your left
foot into an imaginary wall.
Beautiful, then stay here.
Or maybe you begin 
to open left fingertips
all the way up towards the sky.
Maybe right fingertips
begin to hover above the earth.
Keep the left 
inner thigh engaged.
Maybe you work to spiral 
your heart up towards the sky
taking your gaze straight out
or eventually all the 
way up towards the sky.
Half Moon.
Inhale in.
Exhale, slow and steady, you're
gonna bring it all the way back
into a Forward Fold 
at the top of your mat.
Then inhale, halfway lift.
And exhale to let it all go.

Strong legs.
Beautiful, when you're ready,
keep that front knee bent, 
here we go.

all the way up and back.
Take a deep breath in here,
Peaceful Warrior.
Beautiful, then 
straighten the front leg,
bump the hips back and we begin
to tilt forward into Triangle.
Nice and slow.
Right hand can come 
to the waistline here.
Back toes are turned in.
Beautiful, maybe we open our
gaze straight out or all the way
up towards the sky, reaching
the right fingertips up high.
Breathe deep.
Hug the low ribs in.
Keep the right 
inner thigh engaged.
Good, then slowly bring 
your gaze straight down.
Allow your right 
fingertips to come down to
frame that front foot, 
bend both knees
and we'll step the 
back foot up, Pyramid Posture.
Now use this moment to actively
pull the left hip 
crease up and back.
Then we'll shift forward.
Fingertips are gonna come about
six inches in front 
of the left pinky toe.
We'll lift the right heel.
And we'll play here, inhaling in.
Exhale, use that 
contraction, that (shushes),
that connection to slowly,
almost like a lever,
navel draws in and their 
right leg begins to lift up.
Great, dial the 
right toes in just a bit.
Press your foot 
into an imaginary wall.
Inner thighs are engaged here.
Maybe the right hand 
comes to the waistline.
All those beautiful halfway
lifts coming into play here.
Keeping the neck nice and long.
Lots of awareness 
from crown to tail.
Beautiful.
Find that center connection,
that core connection to maybe
reach the right 
arm up and overhead.
And even more so, maybe one day
to lift the left fingertips
off the ground.
Ardha Chandrasana, Half Moon.
Breathe deep wherever you are.
Use an inhale to lift 
your heart just a bit.
And then use an 
exhale to soften everything
back up to the top 
of your mat, Forward Fold.
Inhale to lift you up halfway.
Exhale to rinse it out.
Beautiful, root to rise here.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
And exhale hands to heart.
Namaste.
Just take a second here.
Capture your own magic.
And observe your breath.
Then gently release 
your fingertips down,
arms gently at your sides and
take whatever you need to here,
anything at all, and 
leave anything you don't.
Inhale in.
Exhale to relax the shoulders.
Inhale to reach of the sky.

Slowly inhale, halfway lift.
Slowly exhale, Forward Fold.
Fingertips come to the earth,

We're gonna keep 
the feet together here
as we come 
into a nice low squat.
Alright, now 
with center down low,
let's play with it.
You can use your hands to 
guide you into a seat here.
We're going to Boat Pose so you
can use your hands or we can try
sending the fingertips forward,
rolling through the foot,
stay connected to 
center and from here,
lift the shins 
parallel to the ceiling.
Inhale in.
Exhale, open the palms
externally rotate 
upper arm bones.
Beautiful, inhale in here.
Exhale, low Boat.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to lower.
Nice and slow.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to lower.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to lower.
Inhale to lift 
but make it fashion.
Exhale to lower.
Find something fun.
Inhale to lift.
I'm doing Wu Tang, 
you can do it as well.
Exhale to lower.
Come on, inhale to lift.
This time maybe an embrace.
Exhale to lower.
Inhale to lift.
Maybe fingertips up high.
Exhale, maybe you twist.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to lower.
Make it your own.
Inhale to lift.
I'm just kidding.
Exhale to lower.
Okay, let's do one more.
Inhale to lift.
And exhale to lower.
Inhale to lift.
Bring the feet to the ground.
Bring your head 
towards your knees.
Doesn't even 
matter if it comes close.
Just bow the head.
Nice, then use your 
hands on the earth
to center yourself on the mat.
We're gonna slowly 
roll all the way down.
Coming onto our backs here.
Snuggling the shoulder blades
underneath the heart space.
Once again, please bring 
your hands to your belly.
Close your eyes.
And observe.
Observe your breath.
Great, lift the right knee up.
Bring the right 
foot to the earth.
Lift the left knee up, bring
the left foot to the earth.
Bring the feet as wide as
your yoga mat and then allow the
knees to fall 
gently to your right.
Hands can stay on
the low ribs, the belly.
Then lift your right foot,
cross it over the 
top of your left thigh.
Breathe deep 
here in the stretch.
Part the lips.
Then gently release.
Nice little booty 
massage here, too.
We're gonna roll through,
take it to the left side.
Stay here or lift 
this left leg, left ankle,
excuse me, cross it over 
the top of the right thigh.
Start to cool it off,
calm it down.
Part the lips.
Awesome, gently release.
Bring the knees back.
Walk the hands 
back down at your sides.
We're gonna a walk 
the heels up, Bridge Pose.
Here we go.
Grounding through the feet,
inhale to lift.
Maybe you take the bind,
maybe not.
Maybe you come to 
robot arms here today.
Maybe you take the 
arms up and overhead.
Listen to your body.
Lift your chest to your chin, 
lift your chin to the sky,
shins forward, 
hip points up high.
Take a deep breath in.
And exhale to release.
Bring the soles 
of the feet together.
Knees go wide and then find what
feels good with your hands here.
Resting gently 
on your hip creases,
maybe the belly, 
the ribs, the chest,
or interlacing the 
fingertips behind the head,
finding extended thumbs here,
that neck hammock again,
just giving yourself 
a little massage.
Close your eyes.
Give thanks.
Listen to your breath.
Taking a last moment here too
to honor this time that you've
taken to listen and to 
really hone in on
just that, those listening skills.
So that we can be 
prepared off the mat.
Better prepared to 
make judgment calls.
To move in a 
way that is in alignment
with who we really are.
If we don't develop this
relationship to our intuition
it makes it quite difficult,
particularly in the 
world we live in today.
So snuggle up to 
that inner voice,
get hot for inner 
teacher and keep going.
I look forward to 
seeing you tomorrow.
It's a big day.
My, oh, my.
Let's bring the hands in,
thumbs to third eye.
You can keep the 
legs where they are.
You can start to extend them
out long if it feels right.
Really press thumbs 
into third eye here.
Just kind of 
massaging this point,
this place that
resembles our highest self,
the intuition, inner teacher.
Please come tomorrow 
with an open mind
and ready to feel the
love that you are so worthy of.
We'll see you then.
Peace out.
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
