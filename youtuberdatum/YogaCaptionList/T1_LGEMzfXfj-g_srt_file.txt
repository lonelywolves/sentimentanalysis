- Howdy everyone.
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 17 and today 
we synchronize our watches,
we synchronize our hearts,
we synchronize our brains all in
the name of self love and
self care and we synchronize the
movement with the breath.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alrighty, my darling friends,
let's begin in a nice, 
comfortable seat of your choice.
Come on down to 
the ground and, as always,
take your time 
getting there, right?
The yoga, it's already begun.
Right, it started the 
moment you made the decision
to show up for yourself today.
So take your time.
Enjoy coming into this first
shape and when you get there,
just sit up nice and tall,
you can find a soft, easy sway.
We're kind of 
re-patterning the rigid
beginning that some of us
may or may not have 
been used to in the past.
And using this at-home yoga to
really find that 
sense of self, of ease.
Yeah, Benji! Get it!
I don't know if 
my mic picked that up
but it was a nice long sigh.
Benji returning home.
So find some soft, easy movement
here once you get settled in.
And again, we're 
signaling the brain,
oh, we're not kind of 
coming into this shape,
checking off Sukhasana.
We're coming back inward, right?
Coming back home, 
coming back into our bodies.
And you might find right away
that you're noticing a busy mind
or some congestion perhaps in
the body energetically or even
physically or sore 
and so just remember,
this is part of our journey,
our exploration,
the commitment to really look
inside but then you have to be
willing to see what's there.
So whatever 
you're showing up with,
it's all good.
Pay attention.
As you're ready, 
begin to deepen your breath.
Using that inhale 
to find a gentle lift,
an expansion, and then 
remember what comes
after the lift 
and the expansion.
Naturally, a softening.
So play with that 
here as you get settled in.
Day 17.
If you feel comfortable,
close your eyes.
Allow the sound of 
my voice to guide you.
If that's not 
right for you today,
for whatever reason, just take
your gaze and gently drop it
down past your nose as we 
continue to inhale deeply.
And exhale nice and slow.
Days 17 where we work
to synchronize.
What's that you say?
Marrying the breath 
to the movement today,
the movement to the breath.
So taking some time 
to really sync the two
and explore what that 
process is or could be, right?
This is, in my opinion, very
necessary for us to continue
this journey and grow our
practice here together
so I hope you enjoy.
Starting nice and 
slow we'll ease in.
On your next breath in,
lift the shoulders up 
towards the ear lobes.
Squeeze and lift.
Breathe in, breathe in,
squeeze and lift,
squeeze and lift.
We've done this before.
You're gonna 
exaggerate it today.
Take the elbows back,
shoulders back.
Shoulder blades kiss 
together and as you exhale,
slide them down the back body.
Lots of space between 
the ears and shoulders.
Again, inhale, squeeze and lift.
Nice and easy lifting 
up out of the side body.
Squeeze and lift,
squeeze and lift.
Lift, lift, lift, squeeze.
Then send the 
shoulder blades together.
Imagine you're 
pinching that pencil.
And then on an exhale, 
they slide down the back body.
Starting to sit up 
a little taller here.
Big breath in.
Squeeze and lift, 
squeeze and lift.
And then taking it back 
and down on the exhale.
Again, inhale, squeeze and lift.
Really exaggerating 
this movement,
whatever that means to you.
Send it back and 
down as you breathe out.
Alright, once more, big inhale.
Big gesture in the shoulders.
Take it back and 
down as you exhale.
Awesome, drop the 
chin to the chest.
Palms are gonna come to rest
gently on the knees or thighs
if they are not already.
And then you 
decide what feels best.
Palm face up or palms face down.
So you're starting to just make
more decisions on the mat
based on how you feel.
Alright, then bow 
the chin to the chest.
We're just hanging 
out here for a second.
Notice if you've 
collapsed in the spine.
See if you can 
sit up nice and tall.
Good, take a deep breath in.
Exhale, drop the 
shoulders down just a bit more.
And then small circles 
with the nose one way.
And then the other way,
whenever you're ready.
Oh, yeah.
Okay, bring the 
head over the heart,
the heart over the pelvis.
Find that alignment 
and fingertips
are going to 
go out left to right.
Benji.
Alright, listen carefully, nice 
and slow, we're gonna inhale.
Keep the palms face down as you
send the fingertips 
out left to right.
Just like in our Warriors,
think beyond the 
physical body, right?
So there's energy 
moving out past the fingertips.
Pull the pinkies back,
open your heart,
lift your chest, feel that 
opening through the pecs.
Take a deep breath in here.
Feel that expansion through
all four sides of the torso.
Then nice and slow, 
you're gonna bend the elbows.
And on the exhale we're 
gonna bring the palms together
Anjuli Mudra at the heart.
We know this, beautiful.
Now drop your 
chin to your chest.
We're gonna bring the hands
behind the back of the neck.
And on your next big inhale,
send the fingertips all the way
up towards the sky.
Lengthening through all 
four sides of the torso.
Big breath in here.
And use your exhale,
palms face down.
Just slowly, 
slowly come back to one.
Alright, seeing if we can marry
the movement to the breath,
the breath with the movement.
So can the breath be 
the fuel for the movement?
Let's find out.
Here we go.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Palms face down.
Just come to this position.
Pull the pinkies back.
Lift up through the chest.
Beautiful.
Go ahead and take 
another big sip of air in here.
And sync up here.
Exhale, palms come together.
Nice and slow.
Good, chin to chest.
Reach behind. 
On your next inhale,
lift it all the way up.
Big breath in.
And on the exhale,
float it down.
Fingertips kiss the earth.
Alright, let's giddy up.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Fingertips out left to right.
Right away, exhale,
palms together,
Namaste.
Chin to chest, reach behind.
Inhale, lift it all the way up.
Exhale, press it down.
Good, now we're 
gonna slow down the breath.
See if you can 
enlongate your inhale,
elongate your exhale.
Ready?
Inhale, 
fingertips left to right.
Exhale, palms 
together at center.
Retain the breath here, hold it.
Chin to chest, reach behind.
Big inhale lifts 
you all the way up.
And exhale to float 
it down nice and slow,
don't rush it.
Alright, let's go, inhale.
Left to right.
Exhale, nice and slow,
empty it out,
palms together the heart.
Chin to chest, 
reach behind, you got this.
Slow it down.
Big inhale all the way up.
Exhale, press the palms down.
Now, maybe closing your 
eyes or softening your gaze,
using the sound of 
my voice to guide you.
Inhale fingertips,
left to right.
Exhale, hands to heart.
Chin the chest, reach behind.
Big inhale lifts 
you all the way up.
Exhale, pressing it down.
Energy in the fingertips.
Stick with it, stay focused.
Inhale, halfway, left to right.
Exhale, palms together, Namaste.
Good, chin to chest,
reach behind.
Inhale lifts you all the way up.
And exhale, floating it down.
Twice more, stick with it.
Nice and heavy in the hips,
inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale, hands to heart.
Chin to chest, reach behind.
Big inhale all the way up.
Exhale, float it down,
nice and slow.
Last one, inhale, spread
the fingertips left to right.
Exhale, hands to heart.
Pause, retain the breath.
Chin to chest.
Reach behind, 
palms kiss together.
Breathe into all four sides of
the torso as you lift it up.
Good, exhale,
caressing an imaginary 
cloud or pillow or
blanket in the air all the
way down as you breathe out,
breathe out, breathe out,
breathe out, breathe out.
Fingertips kiss the earth.
Close your eyes.
Pause, observe.
Notice how you feel.
Then bat the eyelashes open.
Oh, hello.
And let's come 
forward onto all fours.
Take your time.
Any soft, easy movement 
that you like here,
take it away.
Checking in with the wrists.
Curling the toes,
stretching through the 
fascia of the foot, the feet.
Petting your darling 
animal if you have one nearby.
Mine sounds like a 
little piggy today.
And then I'll meet you 
in some spinal flexion.
Let's do a couple Cat-Cows,
your version.
You can take it off 
the railroad tracks.
You can stick with 
a structured movement.
Bring your breath.
Remember, the 
breath always comes first.
So when and if in your practice
you feel inspired to freestyle
or if your guide inspires
you to find what feels good,
wink, wink, wink,
let it start with the breath.
Always a good idea to let the
breath inspire that movement.
So on that note, we're gonna
take it to Downward Facing Dog
but resists my cue. Right?
So resist the urge to just
kind of go there because I said
Downward Facing Dog.
See if you can find 
a fun way to get there.
We're in the second half 
of this journey now, it's time.
So take your time.
And if you're like,
"I don't know what 
to do, Adriene." It's all right.
You do know what to do 
and I'll just meet you there.
Downward Facing Dog.
Just two Downward Dogs here.
Oh, sorry, buddy.
Scared him (laughs).
Aw.
Hips up high eventually.
Hands lovingly 
glued to the earth.
We're going to 
pedal it out here.
We're just gonna 
continue that same little dance.
Letting the breath 
inspire the movement here.
Check in with your 
body here on Day 17.
I like when I wear baggy
shirt or like a sweatshirt to
practice, especially at home,
'cause you kinda just come into
your own little 
private love fort here.
Oh, it's the simple
things in life, you guys.
Alright, take 
baby steps to the top.
Nice and slow, crawl it forward.
Enjoy the journey 
from the back of the mat
to the front of the mat.
It's a humbling one.
It's a beautiful one.
So tap into that humility.
And we'll meet in Forward Fold.
Feet hip width 
apart or flush together.
Just nice conscious footing,
your choice.
Take a second to shake the head.
Soften through the neck.
Ground through the feet.
And when you're ready, we'll
bend the knees generously,
bringing the belly toward the
tops of the thighs and with a
little energy today, see if you
can roll up through the spine,
nice and slow.
So energy doesn't mean rush, but
just whatever that means to you.
Find a new connection.
Mountain Pose.
When you get there, 
take a deep breath in.
Enjoy.
And use the exhale to 
relax your shoulders down.
And this is a little
synchronization moment that
I take with me everywhere.
Seems so basic, right?
But we talk about 
this on the channel a lot.
You know, anywhere you are,
if you need a little vinyasa
moment, you can 
take a deep breath in.
Find a lift, wherever that is,
whatever that means for you.
And then use the exhale to
actively draw your 
shoulders back and down.
So shoulder blades 
kiss together and down.
And you can do 
this anytime, anywhere.
Big inhale to find the lift.
Using an active exhale 
to draw the shoulders down.
So many of you know 
this little ditty already.
It can just serve as a reminder
but maybe this is your first
time kind of 
unlocking that in your toolbox.
Just a simple inhale to 
lift up wherever you are.
Give it a try now.
And an exhale to draw the
shoulders back and then down.
And you can start to get really
nerdy with this tiny little
ditty and find other 
things to turn on and lift
as you drop the shoulders down.
For instance, 
shoulders drop down,
we find this lift up 
through the lower belly.
We're just 
inspiring this connection.
Right, so it happens.
We veer off, we get distracted
or we start scrolling or we get
swept up in an emotion 
such as anger or
frustration or disappointment.
And so it's nice to 
have these little tiny,
itty bitty tool or things 
in our toolbelt that
that really go a long way.
Alright, so keep that in mind.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Big stretch, big breath.
Go ahead and practice here.
Exhale, drop the shoulders down.
Beautiful.
Take a deep breath in again,
spread the fingertips.
And this time, as you exhale,
bend the knees,
send 'em back.
You're coming into a 
little Chair variation.
So we're gonna 
draw the low belly in.
We're just gonna 
wake up through the legs.
Spread the fingertips.
Palms are facing 
in towards each other.
Now send the shins back.
Send the bum back.
Stay grounded through 
all four corners of the feet.
Inhale in to look forward.
You got this.
Exhale, you're just gonna take
your left hand drag it across
your right arm as if you're
pulling back a bow and arrow and
then send your left fingertips
back as far as they go.
So they only go here, great.
We're working to open up space.
Don't worry about the 
traditional Chair Pose here.
Just keep those 
hips back, shins back,
all four corners 
of the feet grounded.
Inhale in again.
Exhale to drop 
the shoulders down.
Great, inhale, 
come back to center.
Bring everything to center,
palms facing in.
Gorgeous, exhale.
Sit back, way back.
You got this.
Good, inhale to look forward.
Exhale, right 
fingertips now come across.
We're starting to 
create a little heat.
Welcome some heat.
All the way across, all 
the way across the chest.
Take it back as far as it goes.
And again, if it's just 
here then that's all right.
We're opening up 
through the front body still.
Take your time.
Great, dig into the heels, 
dig into the ball joint
of the big toe, the ball 
joint of the pinky toe.
You got this.
Inhale in.
Exhale, relax 
your shoulders down.
Sink a little lower.
Great and then bring 
it all the way back.
Inhale to center.
Gorgeous, exhale, 
drop the shoulders.
We rise up strong,
dig into the heels, inhale.
Reach for the sky.
Palms kiss 
together up and overhead.
Draw your navel in and 
up as you melt the hands
back down to heart center.
Pause. Notice how you feel.
Wonderful.
Inhale in deeply here.
Big audible breath.
Exhale completely.
Nice audible breath, maybe
breathe out through the lips,
the mouth.
Excellent. Bring the 
hands to your waistline.
Open your eyes.
We're gonna slowly come 
to stand wide on the mat.
Bring the feet just a little bit
wider than shoulder width apart.
Toes pointing forward, 
grounded through the feet.
Think of that upward current
of energy lifting you up,
up, up through the front body
and then it does this beautiful
like Tokyo 2020 
Olympics flip in the air
and then down 
through the back body.
So we have this upward current
of energy through 
the front body.
Downward current of 
energy through the back body.
Little power pose here.
Take another moment here to
simply notice how you feel and
reestablish this relationship
with conscious breath.
Alright, here we go again.
Soft bend in the knees.
Inhale, take up space.
You're gonna send the 
fingertips out left to right.
Own it here, take up space.
You got it.
Pull the pinkies back.
Lift up through the front,
ground through the back.
Use this little 
ditty of inhaling to lift,
relaxing the 
shoulders on the exhale.
Good, take one 
more deep breath in.
As you do so, think about 
drawing energy up from the
arches of the feet here.
Mhmmm, nice.
Then exhale, bring the 
palms together at the heart.
Same thing as before.
Beautiful chin to chest.
But try to keep the 
torso nice and long.
Great, then reach behind.
Inhale, carve a 
line with the nose,
just like we've been doing, push
that little ball of yarn forward
as you reach all the 
way up towards the sky.
So we're pressing 
away from the earth.
We're reaching 
up towards the sky.
And then take a deep breath in 
here as you just find a little
stretch in the side body.
And on your exhale, 
be true to your exhale,
go ahead and 
release the fingertips down.
Good, take one
cycle of breath here, in.
And out.
Alright, let's go again.
Soft bend in the knees.
Inhale, send the 
fingertips out left to right.
Exhale, palms heart center.
Chin to chest, reach behind.
Follow with me here, 
big inhale, reach for the sky.
Draw energy up through
the arches of the feet.
Exhale, press the palms down,
all the way 
fingertips to your sides.
Good, picking up 
the pace of it, inhale.
Left to right.
Exhale to heart center.
Chin to chest, reach behind.
Inhale all the way up.
Reach, reach, 
reach, reach, reach,
reach, reach, 
reach, reach, reach.
Exhale, press it down.
Energy in the fingertips 
lengthen through the crowd.
See if you can find 
something new on this next one.
Here we go, inhale.
Left to right.
Exhale, Anjuli Mudra.
Chin to chest, strong 
legs here, reach behind.
Inhale, all the way up.
Exhale, fingertips 
float down nice and slow.
Again, find something new.
Is it with the feet?
Is with the legs?
Lifting the kneecaps?
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale hands to heart.
Chin to chest, reach behind.
Life is good.
All the way up.
Big breath in.
And exhale float it down.
Last one.
This time see if you 
can integrate the neck.
What would that mean?
Maybe using your nose 
to kind of follow the arms?
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale hands to heart.
Reach behind.
Last time, 
inhale all the way up.
And exhale, float 
it all the way down.
Fingertips are going to
interlace behind the back here.
Bring the palms as 
close together as they come.
You can always 
square at the wrists here,
getting a nice 
stretch in the forearm.
Draw that lower 
belly in just a bit.
Find that lift up 
through the front,
that grounding through the back.
Big breath in here.
Long breath out.
Listen carefully, we're gonna 
turn the left toes in,
turn the right toes out.
Inhale.
Lift your heart.
Exhale, pull the 
right hip crease back.
Beautiful.
Inhale in again.
Carve a line 
with the nose, look up.
Exhale, bend your front knee.
Great.
Does this feel familiar?
Draw the navel in and up.
Big breath in again.
With the exhale, peel the 
right hip crease back,
ground through the 
outer edge of that left foot
and begin to look forward.
Trying maybe to see your 
reflection here in the pond,
hugging the low ribs in.
Not coming all the way down into
Humble Warrior unless you're
just really craving it.
Keep this nice flat back.
Engage your left inner thigh.
Take a second here 
to lovingly refine.
Use your breath.
Great.
Keep the back leg strong.
The root of this, the back
leg as you slowly release the
fingertips down to come up,
big inhale, Warrior I.
Yes. Awesome.
Inhale to look up, 
spread the fingertips.
Exhale, Warrior II.
You can widen your 
stance if you need to.
Great, pull it back.
Lift your heart.
Nice. 
Inhale in.
Exhale, hands 
come to the waistline,
we straighten the right leg.
Beautiful.
Then back to 
this power pose here.
You can narrow your 
stance if you like or stay put.
Just nice strong legs.
Inhale in deeply here.
Exhale to release the fingers.
We're gonna interlace again.
This time opposite thumb on top
so the one that 
feels a little weird.
And you know, we 
celebrate the weird here.
So...
You're like, "I know. I'm a
subscriber to this channel."
(laughs)
This time really actively 
draw their knuckles down.
Just creating more space.
Inhale.
Upward current of 
energy through the front body.
Exhale, exaggerating that
downward current of 
energy through your back.
And then when you're ready,
turn the right toes in,
send the left toes out.
Great, check it out.
Inhale to lift the heart,
maybe look up.
Exhale to relax 
the shoulders down.
Inhale in again.
Exhale, bend your left knee.
Right?
Hug the low ribs in, 
lengthen the tailbone down.
Find that connection to
your middle, your center.
And then here we go, 
strong, rooted.
Should feel really 
connected in that back leg here.
Engage your right 
inner thigh if you don't.
Alright, peel the 
left hip crease back,
deep breath in.
Exhale, lean forward.
Strong Sushumna, 
this strong midline here.
Hugging the low ribs in.
Sending your gaze forward.
Give yourself that image,
this is that Zoolander moment.
Like, "Who am I?"
Looking in, 
lengthening through the crown,
strong legs, shoulder 
blades still drawing together.
There's a lot going on here.
Find your breath.
Excellent.
Then nice and steady,
fingertips drop down to come up.
Keep that front knee bent.
We inhale rise, 
lift the heart, Warrior I.
Press into the outer 
edge of your back foot strong.
I call this the lost Warrior.
I feel like not many people 
are teaching Warrior I
or practicing Warrior I.
But we are! We love you!
You're number one to us!
Okay, here we go. (laughs)
Lift your head, your gaze up.
Keep the neck integrated.
Inhale in.
Exhale, Warrior II.
You got this.
Widen your stance if you like.
Keep that front leg bent.
Your legs might be tired.
We got this.
You guys are doing great.
Day 17.
Talk about a Warrior.
So awesome.
Inhale in, you got this.
One more breath.
Exhale.
Hands come to the waistline.
(sighs)
Turn the left toes in.
Option today to do
the heel-toe, heel-toe.
Do-si-do, come
on, baby, let's go!
Just kidding.
Or maybe today you bend the
knees and we use this connection
to center that 
we've been working on,
this lift through the front,
ground through the back
to hop the feet together.
Ready? Give it a go.
Whatever decision 
you made there, (chuckles)
commit to it fully.
And then we'll 
release the fingertips down.
Take a deep breath in.
Squeeze the 
shoulders up to the ears.
And exhale, drop it out,
breathe out through your mouth.
Drop it down.
Inhale.
Exhale, let it go.
And once more, make it awesome.
Inhale, squeeze and lift.
Exhale, let it go.
Float the palms together.
Last time, 
Anjuli Mudra at the heart.
Bring the thumbs up to the third
eye and just take a second here.
Feet grounded.
Heart gently lifted.
Reverent bow 
here of head to heart.
Mind intelligence to 
the body intelligence.
Find your breath.
Listen to your song.
So a little commitment here.
A loving commitment.
To respect the breath and this
marriage of movement and breath.
From this day on to 
the end of this journey,
and then I'll let 
you decide if you want to
keep it going from there.
Alright, so we'll put it
into practice again tomorrow.
In the meantime, hopefully you
can find small ways or be open
to small ways in which this
practice shows up off your mat.
Thank you so 
much for being here.
Take one more deep breath in.
And we'll exhale to whisper
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
