- Hey everyone!
Welcome to Breath,
your 30 day yoga journey.
I'm Adriene and this is Benji 
and you found us, welcome!
This is the place.
You made it and
this is the right time.
This is a welcome video, okay?
There's no yoga today so just
in case you didn't know that,
I wanted to make sure that you
knew that today is about getting
connected and committing to
the next 30 days together.
So we'll begin tomorrow,
Day 1, with the yoga.
In the meantime, wherever
you're watching this video,
maybe on your couch,
in your bed,
on the ground, in a pillow
fort, just sit up nice and tall.
And we're gonna take a
couple of breaths together.
So wherever you are,
find length in your spine.
And nice and easy,
I'll invite us to take
a deep breath in together.
Here we go.
And out together.
And big inhale in together.
Nothin' fancy,
and exhale out together.
And one more time,
big inhale in.
And this time as you exhale,
relax your shoulders 
down, down, down.
And we're here.
So first thing's first, I want
to give you a couple little
things that you might
want to bring to class.
Ultimately, the Yoga With
Adriene at-home yoga invitation
and the experience
doesn't require much,
just your willingness
to be present and,
of course, you have to show up.
The hardest part is showing up.
I promise you the most difficult
and challenging thing of this
next 30 day journey is
going to be getting on that mat.
So as long as you get
yourself there, we will connect.
Benji will be our cheerleader.
And together we'll
uncover the rest.
So if you have a
yoga mat, bring it.
It'll be useful.
If you don't have a
yoga mat, that's okay.
Again, it's very much in the 
Yoga With Adriene wheelhouse
to work with what you have.
So you can work with
just a hard surface.
If it's carpet that's okay.
But if you have a mat,
bring it to class.
If you have a blanket
or a towel, bring it.
If you have a
yoga block, bring it.
We just want to have something,
a little something that
you can sit up on.
This can be a big bath
towel or a big beach towel.
You don't have to
have a yoga blanket.
This can be anything that you
may have at home that will help
cushion your seat and help lift
your hips a bit so that you can
come into this position that
we will be coming to a lot
as we focus on our breath.
Wear comfortable clothing.
Not so difficult, right?
Wear things that
you can move easy in.
And finally, forget what you
think you know about yoga.
When you come tomorrow,
come with an open mind.
Come with an open heart and just
be willing to see what happens.
I will do my best to guide
you and offer modifications.
We're casting a wide net.
Please know that you're never
gonna be alone with this practice.
There's always going to
be someone practicing live,
in real-time, with you,
which is pretty special.
And ultimately, if you just
come to the mat to breathe,
I think you're going to feel
the benefits of this practice.
So if you don't mind, let's
bring the palms together and
close with one
final deep breath in.
Here we go.
In through the nose.
And out through the nose.
You can close your eyes here
and just set a little intention
for the next 30 days.
Why are you here?
What do you think
pulled you here?
And if you don't know yet,
that's awesome, too.
That's exciting.
Alright, take a second,
sit up nice and tall.
Palms together in prayer.
And we'll inhale in again.
And exhale to bow the head to
the heart and we will whisper,
Namaste.
Thanks everyone. I can't wait.
I will see you tomorrow.
