- What's up, party people?
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 15.
Ah, the halfway point.
Today we take the opportunity
to celebrate that we're halfway
through the journey and 
we also take the opportunity
to hit the reset button.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alrighty, my friends, 
let's begin today standing
at the top of the mat.
Stand up nice and tall.
Just take a couple 
of seconds here to
tune into the 
sound of your breath.
And we're gonna start 
with some shoulders circles.
So just loop their shoulders
a little forward, up and back.
You can start to really feel
your feet on the ground here.
Maybe find that soft 
bend in the knees that
we're always talking about.
So here we are 
at the halfway mark,
the perfect opportunity to
reset with a
rejuvenating flow.
Are you ready?
Benji, are you ready?
I'm ready. Let's go.
Inhale, reach the 
arms all the way up.
Big breath, big stretch.
Exhale, float it down,
bend your knees.
Forward Fold.
On an inhale, halfway lift.
Keep it soft and easy.
Again, soft bend 
in the knees here.
No need to push or force.
And then exhale 
to soften and fold.
Great, inhale, 
reach for the sky,
root to rise here.
Big breath, big stretch.
Stand up nice and tall.
Exhale all the way back down,
Forward Fold.
Inhale lifts you up halfway.
Find length in the neck,
pull the shoulders back.
Exhale to soften and release.
Listen carefully, from here bend
your knees you're gonna just
crawl your toes all the 
way out and then hips up
to Downward Facing Dog.
Take a couple breaths 
here to find what feels good.
Clawing through the fingertips,
stretching through the feet.
See if you can find something
new here as we set out on the
second half of our 
journey here within the 30 days.
Then anchor through the right
heel and on your next inhale,
slide the right leg up high.
As you exhale, 
bend your right knee,
shift it forward, 
step your right foot up
into a nice low lunge.
Go ahead and 
lower the back knee.
Front knee over front 
ankle and just take some soft,
easy movement here, as always,
to create space 
and deepen your breath.
If you are seeking 
a little more here,
remember you can always 
walk to the left knee back,
creating a little more space.
Then inhale, 
come up off the fingertips,
light a little fire in your core
as you open the chest, lift up.
Then exhale, fingertips 
come back to the mat.
We're gonna drag them all the
way back as we peel the right
hip crease and flex the 
right toes towards the face
for your runners stretch.
Inhale in deeply here.
As you exhale, 
roll through the right foot.
Nice, we're gonna take the right
fingertips now over towards the
left and we're gonna keep
walking over towards 
the left side of the mat.
As we pivot on that back foot, 
we're gonna come into that
Standing Wide-
Legged Forward Fold.
Alright, toes turn in.
We find our version here.
If you can see if you can relax 
the weight of the head over.
Promoting a 
healthy blood flow here.
Inhaling deeply, 
exhaling completely.
Then inhale in again, 
find a soft bend in the knees.
Exhale, roll it up 
all the way to standing.
Stay grounded through the feet.
Inhale, Star Pose, 
spread the fingertips,
take up space.
Exhale, Warrior II.
Turn the right toes forward,
sink down nice and low,
widen your 
stance if you need to,
pull those pinkies back.
Head over heart, heart over
pelvis here, strong legs.
Today, keep that front 
knee bent as you send your
right fingertips up and back.
Peaceful Warrior.
Inhale in here.
Exhale to cartwheel all the
way back down to your lunge.
Big inhale to find your twist.
Right fingertips 
reach up towards the sky.
Wiggle the 
right fingertips here.
Good, and then exhale,
bring it all the way back down.
Now from here, 
step the back foot up halfway,
Pyramid Pose.
You've been here before.
Fingertips on the earth or
you can bring the 
hands of the waistline.
Inhale in.
Exhale, bend both knees 
kick your left foot back,
return to your nice low lunge.
Great, plant the palms.
Strong core here, step the
right toes back, Plank Pose.
Inhale in to look forward,

Baby Cobra.
Exhale, forehead 
releases towards the earth.
Inhale, curl the toes under.
Exhale, press up 
to all fours or Plank.
Inhale in again.
Exhale to Downward Dog.
Take a second here, 
notice how you feel.
Return to your breath.
Try to find something new.
Here we go, anchor 
through the right heel,
inhale, lift the 
left leg up high.
Claw through 
the fingertips here.
Exhale, shift it forward,
bend your left knee,
squeeze and lift and 
then step it all the way up,
nice, low lunge.
Back knee comes
to the earth softly, sweetly.
And again, 
a little bit of a sway.
You can walk that right knee
back if you want a little more.
Front knee over front ankle.
Just notice the 
patterns here in your left foot,
maybe turning out or turning in.
Toes point forward.
And here we go, lighting 
a little fire in the belly.
Loop the shoulders, 
inhale, open the chest,
fingertips come 
off the mat, we lift up.
And then exhale, 
fingertips back to the mat.
We'll drag it back with the left
hip crease, runners stretch.
Active through that left foot.
Good, inhale in here.
Empty it out.
So really articulate 
through this left foot here.
Rolling through that left foot.
And here we go, swinging 
the left fingertips around,
we'll lift the back knee.
We'll start to turn to the right
edge of the mat now for our
Standing Wide-
Legged Forward Fold.
Your version.
Strong legs.
Activate from the 
arches of the feet.
Draw up, lift the kneecaps.
If you can, 
let's experiment with relaxing
the weight of the head over.
Again, just promoting healthy
blood flow here, circulation.
Then take a deep breath in.
Use your exhale 
to bend your knees.
From your center, from the
middle let's rise up strong.
Feel that power in your 
feet as you ground down
to lift up, take up space here.
X marks the spot.
Wiggle the fingertips,
inhale in, lift your heart.
Exhale, Warrior II.
So in this Warrior, think about
like sending energy way
beyond your physical body.
So we send the left 
fingertips out in front.
We send the right fingertips out
in back and can you imagine that
this energy, this line of energy
is going way beyond the fingers.
Warrior II, stay nice 
and calm with your breath.
Nice, long inhale.
Nice, long exhale.
Keep this front knee bent.
We're building strength.
You got this.
Inhale, left fingertips 
reach up and back,
Peaceful Warrior.
Relax the shoulders down.
Tuck your chest slightly,
inhale in.
Exhale with control 
from center we cartwheel
all the way back down.
We pivot on the back foot.
Here we go.
Leaning into that right hand.
We're gonna inhale,
send the left fingertips 
up towards the sky.
Big twist.
Breathe into your belly.
Wiggle the left fingertips.
And then slowly bringing 
it back down to the lunge.
Here we go.
Stepping the back 
foot up just about halfway.
We find our Pyramid Pose.
The legs are straight, 
but knees are not locked.
Beautiful, take one more
breath here, your version.
You got it.
Anchoring the mind in 
the sound of your breath.
And then here we go, 
walking the fingertips forward,
bend both knees, 
shoot the right leg back.
Plant the palms, 
shoot the left leg back.
Plank Pose.
Mhmmm.
Listen carefully, we're gonna
dial the heart towards the left,
turn the toes towards the left.
You come on to the 
inner arch of your left foot
and the outer edge 
of your right foot.
Now press away from your
yoga mat with the right hand.
As you inhale, lift your left
fingertips up towards the sky.
Wiggle the fingertips.
You got this.
Careful not to 
collapse in the neck.
Use your vocabulary,
you have it.
And we're gonna 
bring it back to center.
Take a little break on 
the knees if you need to,
otherwise keep 'em lifted.
Here we go, pressing 
away from the yoga mat,
lifting the heart up,
then dialing our 
hearts towards the right.
We come to the outer 
edge of the left foot,
inner arch of the right foot
and send the 
right fingertips up high.
Side Plank variation.
Keep the neck nice and long.
You got this for three, two,
wiggle the right fingertips and
bring it back on the one.
Feel free to 
lower the knees here,
otherwise shift 
forward on the toes.
Squeeze the elbows 
into the side body,
lower all the way to the belly.
Yes. (laughs)
Inhale, we rise, Cobra.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Press up to all fours.
You can go straight 
to Downward Dog here
or you can join 
me in a Child's Pose.
Three breaths.
So you can choose 
your resting posture here
three cycles of breath.
In and out.
In and out.
In and out.
Downward Facing Dog, 
take your time getting there.
That's where we will 
all meet all together now.
When you get there, 
take a nice wide base.
So hands are wide.
We've talked about that before.
Same thing with the toes now.
Walk the toes out kind of wide.
So we have a wide Dog.
Then hug the low ribs in,
feel that hollow 
body through the front.
Press into your left palm.
Then we're gonna take the right
hand and bring it to the outer
edge of your left leg.
Anywhere. Even if it's 
just for a moment.
Down Dog Twist. What?!?
Come back to center.
Inhale in.
Use what you got.
Everything you've 
learned so far
see if you can 
integrate, implement.
Here we go, inhale.
On an exhale, 
hug the low ribs in.
We connect to the core.
And then we take the 
left hand to the outer edge.
Anywhere will work,
even if it's just for 
a moment to test it out.
Maybe bending that left elbow,
looking underneath the right
armpit chest, Down Dog Twist.
And then back to center.
You did amazing.
Bend the knees.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale to make your
way to the top, your version.
Inhale lifts you up halfway.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Root to rise here. 
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Big stretch.
Spread your fingertips.
And exhale, hands to heart.
Pause here.
Capture a bit of the magic.
Listen to your breath 
and notice how you feel.
Bend the knees, inhale, 
fingertips go down to come up.
Big breath as 
you stretch up high.
Exhale, bend the knees 
as you take it down low.
Inhale, halfway lift,
your version.
Long neck.

Downward Facing Dog.
Hips up high.
Good, inhale, 
lift the right leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward.
Step it all the way up.
Lower the back knee here.
When you're ready, inhale,
sweep the arms up and overhead.
Exhale, listen carefully, from
here you're gonna come all the
way into that runners stretch by
lifting the navel up and back,
straightening that front leg
and then bowing forward into it.
Beautiful, inhale, look forward.
Roll all the way 
through your right foot.
Here we go. Standing 
Wide-Legged Forward Fold.
Bring the right hand around.
Use your hands to walk it 
out towards the left edge.
Ground through the feet,
toes turning in.
Relax the weight 
of the head down.
If it's available to you,
maybe come on to 
the hands or the elbows.
If it's not, 
don't worry about it.
Embrace exactly who you 
are and where you are today,
it's awesome.
Inhale in.
Everyone, exhale,
bend your knees, roll it up.
Strong legs here.
Hands are gonna 
come to the waistline.
This is our superhero posture.
Beautiful, 
pause here, breathe in.
And empty it out.
Good, inhale, Star Pose.
Send the fingertips 
all the way out.
Exhale, palms come together
and back down to the heart.
You're gonna bring one heel in,
then the other.
And yeah, you guessed it.
We're here to hit the
reset button, stir the pot.
Meet your comfortable 
edge and surprise yourself.
Get down low.
Get down low.
That's what I sounded like.
Okay, lift your right heel.
We got this. Drop it.
And lift your left heel.
Drop it.
Optional to just stay here
or lift both heels for three,
two, get your center 
underneath you. And one.
Drop the heels,
inhale, reach up.
Take it to Warrior II.
Front knee stays bent, 
Peaceful Warrior.
Inhale, reach it back.
And exhale, 
cartwheel all the way forward
and through to your lunge.
Next big inhale lifts you up,
right fingertips to the sky.
And exhale back down, beautiful.
Plant the palms, step it back.
Belly to Cobra or 
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Use your breath.
Let it guide you.
We'll meet in 
Downward Facing Dog.
When you get there, take a
big full I love you breath in.
And a nice cleansing breath out.
Second side, let's go.
Inhale lift the 
left leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward.
Bend that knee, 
squeeze and lift.
Step it up.
Lower the back knee down.
Crescent Lunge.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Okay, so from here, 
navel draws in and up.
Reach a little higher 
from here, from your core,
from the middle start to 
straighten that leg and then
paint an imaginary 
wall with your hands.
Down, down, down.
Runners stretch.
Mhmmm.
Inhale.
Exhale, 
roll through the left foot.
Take your left hand,
bring it around.
We're gonna walk now 
across the right edge of the mat
coming into Prasarita.
Let the weight 
of the head soften.
Even if you're working 
with hands on the thighs.
Just try to let the 
weight of the head soften.
Working to get that 
head below the heart here.
Maybe, right?
Maybe not, maybe 
that's not for you.
Together let's 
take a deep breath in.
Use the exhale to 
ground through the feet,
lift the kneecaps,
tone the quads, roll it up.
You got this.
Hands come to the waistline.
Power pose here.
Whatever happened, reset here.
Use this moment to inhale in.
And exhale, land.
Step into your power.
Beautiful.
Inhale, spread the fingertips,
reach up high.
Take up space.
And palms come together 
and back down to the heart.
Bring one heel in,
bend that knee.
Then the other, bend your knees.
Get down low, here we go.
We got this.
Now lift the left heel up.
Just the left heel.
Drop it down.
Keep breathing, get down low.
Lift the right heel,
just the right heel.
Press into your pinky.
Good, now stay 
here nice and low.
Breathing, meeting 
your comfortable edge.
Do not give up.
Stick with it
or lift both heels for three.
Lift 'em up high.
Two, sink down low.
And on the one.
Yay! Drop the heels.
Reach up towards the sky.
Blossom into Virabhadrasana II,
here we go.
Can you find something new here?
Return to the 
sound of your breath.
Steady.
Try to keep 
this front knee bent.
If you're working 
on building strength,
it's gonna want to creep up
here so keep it nice and low.
Left fingertips reach 
forward, up and back.
Peaceful Warrior on an inhale.
Then on an exhale, 
hug the low ribs in.
Cartwheel, take up space.
Come all the way 
through and into your lunge.
Big breath sends the 
left fingertips up high.
And exhale to 
bring it back down.
Beautiful.
Plant the palms.
Last call for vinyasa here.
Feel free to skip it, 
go straight to Down Dog.
We'll come through to Plank.
You can do a 
Half Plank here working,
you know, where it 
feels right for you today.
So belly to Cobra, 
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
If you want to insert 
a couple of pushups here,
go for it.
And I'll meet you in 
that Downward Facing Dog.
Here we go. When you 
get there all together now,
a couple of cleansing breaths.
Let's hit the reset button.
Get ready for Lion's Breath.
Big inhale in 
through the nostrils.
Exhale, Lion's Breath.
Stick your tongue out.
Twice more, inhale.
Exhale, Lion's Breath,
tongue out.
Come on, surprise yourself.
One more, inhale in.
Melt the heart towards
the thighs, breathe out.
Good. Slow, controlled 
descend of the
knees down to kiss the earth.
Swing your legs 
to one side, any side,
and come through to 
lie flat on your back.
When you get there, (chuckles)
go ahead and hug 
the knees into your chest.
Then take the knees wide.
We're gonna reach 
the hands through,
grab of the inner arches or
the outer edges of your feet.
If we can't reach, 
no worries, you're not alone.
Then you can take your hands
just below the knees or you can
even use your pant leg or like
if your leg hair is super long
you can just like wrap 
it around your knuckles
and hold on your 
leg hair here. (laughs)
Happy Baby Pose.
Kicking the soles of 
the feet up towards the sky.
Dropping the shoulders down
in socket and then using this
little healthy push-pull to
find this yumminess in
the hip socket, hip joint.
If this is too much, 
one thing I like to suggest is
to work one leg at a time here.
So you have your opposite 
foot to kind of ground you.
And work.
If you are 
pretty open in the hips,
then this is for everyone but
I'd like for you to really focus
on the cue of lengthening your
tailbone actively towards the
front edge of your mat.
And then when 
you feel like you're
guided into it, explore.
Close your eyes, 
maybe soften your gaze.
Breathe deep.
If soft, easy movement 
feels good here,
you can extend one
leg and then the other, maybe.
Again, reaching the soles of
the feet up towards the sky and
dropping the weight 
of the shoulders down.
Blissful baby.
Awesome, take one 
more deep breath in here.
And then slowly go 
ahead and release that.
We'll bring the soles of the
feet to the earth and we're just
going to windshield 
wiper the legs back and forth,
back and forth until the legs
are extended all the way out.
Then you can center 
yourself on your mat.
Tick-tock the 
toes a little bit here.
Just shaking out
through the ankles, the legs.
Shimmy the shoulder blades
underneath your heart space and
then allow your arms to 
rest gently at your side.
Tuck the chin, 
lengthen through the neck,
take the deepest breath.
And as you exhale, allow the
weight of your body to release
completely and 
fully into the earth.
Be still.
Allow your breath to soften into
it's a natural rhythm,
whatever that may be today.
Relax your tongue in 
the base of the mouth here.
And just notice how you feel.
As you're ready,
inhale lots of love in.
Exhale lots of love out as you
slowly bring the palms together,
thumbs up towards the third eye.
Killing it.
Thank you for 
showing up here today.
Tomorrow, Day Sweet 16.
I look forward to seeing you.
In the meantime, 
continue to enjoy the ride.
Remember that the 
breath always comes first.
What an amazing tool for 
hitting the reset button.
Inhale in.
Exhale to whisper
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
