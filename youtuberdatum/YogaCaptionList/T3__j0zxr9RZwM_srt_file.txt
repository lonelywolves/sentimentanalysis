- What's up everyone?
Welcome to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 29,
Believe.
Let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Okay, today we're going
to begin lying on our backs.
So come on down to the ground.
Welcome back.
Wow, Day 29.
Can you believe it?
Benji? Can you
believe it? Oh, yes.
Come on down to the ground,
let's bring the left hand
to the heart space, 
the right hand to the belly,
press into your head.
Literally physically 
lift your chest up,
draw the shoulder blades
in and kind of underneath
your heart space and then
relax the weight of your head,
neck and
shoulders into the earth.
Close your eyes my sweet friend.
Feel the warmth of your
hands on these two wonderful,
beautiful listening
centers both the belly,
your center, your guts,
and your heart. Mmm.
Take a moment here to
just land in your practice.
And notice how you
feel showing up here today.
So, not just as in check
in with your body physically
but how do you feel about the
fact that you're here Day 29?
What if anything is
resonating with you
as you step
onto your mat today?
Do you feel
proud, excited,
closer to your truth, 
more like yourself,
more comfortable
in this experience
maybe than you 
were in the beginning?
Do you feel
more one with your
growth process, 
your healing process?
Maybe more united with
the fact that others are
going through their own growth
process, healing processes.
So often we come to the
mat and kind of check in
with our energy and our body,
but just take a second here.
As you gently 
deepen the breath to
notice how you feel about
showing up for yourself
like this, in this way.
Feel the rise of the inhale,
the gentle
falling of the exhale.
And the invitation is really
to me, both simple
and profound today.
It's really not
about believing in
the benefits of yoga,
(chuckles) although I do.
Continue to feel the rise
and the fall of your breath.
It's not about believing in
even any one thing 
about this practice or
Yoga With Adriene or even Benji.
What it's inviting us
to spend some time with today
is that this is an
opportunity for you to recognize
how time with conscious breath
and contemplation and
mindful movement can lead us
toward genuinely
believing in oneself,
trusting yourself.
Trusting the quality of
relationship that you continue
to cultivate with
yourself as you change
and transform and shed and grow.
Continuing to feel this wave
of the breath rise and fall.
We hear it all the time,
"The mat is a mirror."
So if you like set a
little intention here
for your practice today.
Repeat it quietly to yourself.
And then have faith.
Have faith in yourself.
Inhale lots of love in.
Exhale, lots of love out.
Start to bend the knees.
Bring one foot up, 
then the other.
We're gonna walk the
feet as wide as the yoga mat
and then bring
the knees into touch.
Inhale in deeply 
through the nose.
And exhale out 
through the mouth.
Inhale in deeply 
through the nose.
Nice cleansing breath
out through the mouth.
And now seal the lips, 
inhale in.
And exhale out.
Beautiful, we'll reach
the arms up and overhead.
Big breath, big stretch,
low back lifts.
We'll hook the thumbs here.
Beautiful, and then
slowly bring the knees up.
Wrap the arms around the shins
and rock gently side to side.
Feel supported
in your back body.
Inhale in deeply.
Exhale to rock to one side 
and press up to all fours.
Or we can start to 
rock and roll up and down
the length of the spine.
Eventually coming all
the way to all fours.
Take it away,
spinal flexion, inhale,
dropping the belly 
to open the chest
and looking up
towards the sky today.
And then exhale, 
rounding through chin to chest.
Really finding 
that lock in the throat.
Good, then inhale open
up through the throat.
Open up through the front line.
And then exhale,
find that chin lock.
Open up through the back line.
Now keep it going with
the sound of your breath.
Maybe even closing the eyes.
So in other words, my friends,
all of these wonderful little
intimate moments you create
for yourself and with
yourself on your mat,
I feel like they can lead you
towards having this
relationship with yourself
where you really can trust.
Trust your own intuition, right?
Trust your truth.
We're not really looking
for answers
outside or we're telling
or having other people 
tell us what to feel
or think but we're connected
to how we really feel and think.
Drop the elbows, when you're 
ready, we're gonna walk it
back to a Puppy Posture.
A confidence, a faith 
in oneself all supported
by a daily yoga practice.
I can really get behind that.
I speak from experience.
Puppy Posture, rock the
forehead a little side to side.
Tailbone really pointing 
up towards the heavens.
Big heart opener here.
Now find stillness, 
deep breath in.
Long breath out.
Stay here, inhale in.
And exhale out.
Keep the hands and the forearms
where they are as you now
slide your heart through,
come to Sphinx Pose.
Digging into the elbows
pressing into the pubic bone,
tops of the feet.
Shoulder blades draw together.
Slowly look past your 
right shoulder, inhale.
Exhale, come through center.
Slowly look past 
your left shoulder.
Beautiful, inhale,
exhale, come back to center.
Interlace the fingertips here
if you like or keep the hands
where they are.
Inhale in, curl the toes under.
Exhale, lift up, Forearm Plank.
Strong and steady
reaching the heels back.
Upper arm bones
rotating out so lots of space
between the ears
and the shoulders.
Your neck is nice and long.
Navel draws in and up.
Activate, activate,
you got this.
You might drop the
right knee down here.
Let it kiss the earth
and then lift it back up.
You might drop the left
knee down let it kiss the earth
and then lift it back up.
And one more time, right
knee kisses (kiss imitating)
and reaching the right heel back
and then left knee kisses
and reaching the left heel back.
Good, slowly lower 
all the way down.
Drag the hands in line with
the rib cage, squeeze the elbows
into the side body. 
Inhale, lift up Cobra.
And exhale slow
and steady release
all the way back down, good.
Curl the toes under, inhale in.
Exhale, Plank Pose.
Inhale in again.
And exhale, 
Downward Facing Dog.
Take your dog for
a little walk here.
Start to really
lean into the sound of
your breath and the sensation
in your body.
And when you're ready,
go ahead and take it
up to the top of the mat.
Nice and slow.
Feet hip width apart
or flush together.
Let's hang forward here,
grounding through the feet,
feeling that foot
to earth connection
and a little goes a long way.
Slowing down your breath.
Relaxing through the shoulders
and the neck, the head.
Again, slow down 
your breath here.
If you can make 
the breath a little bit longer,
if you wanna do
the box breath here
you can count inhaling in
for four, exhaling out for four.
So you have a lot of
vocabulary to play with
and to work with.
Trust the vocabulary, 
trust the integrity that
you've been
bringing to this practice.
And have faith.
When you're ready,
begin to slowly roll it up.
Now when you come
into your Mountain,
go ahead and right away,
reach the fingertips all
the way up and overhead.
Take a deep breath in,
look up.
And exhale, Forward
Fold all the way down.
Listen carefully from here,
slide your right foot behind
the left and over.
So you're criss-cross here
and then let the
weight of your head hang.
You can even find
that chin lock again here,
shifting into all
four corners of the foot.
Good and then slowly
micro-bend the knees,
come back to center.
And then walk the left foot
or slide the left foot behind.
Relax the weight 
of the head over.
And then all the
way back to center.
Feet together or 
hip width apart.
Inhale, lift up halfway.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Root to rise here, 
inhale, reach for the sky,
send the fingertips up high.
And exhale right
back down you go.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Nice, beautiful
long neck. Exhale, fold.
Stay present here, bring
the fingertips to the earth.
Step the left foot back,
pivot on the back foot.
Use your left
fingertips reaching forward
up and back to
come into Warrior II.
Pull the pinkies back,
front knee is bent.
Breathe here.
Head over heart, 
heart over pelvis.
Back toes are turned in.
And then straightening
through the front leg,
reach the right fingertips
all the way up and back.
Big breath, big stretch,
and cartwheeling
all the way through
bending that front
knee back to your lunge.
Here's our twist,
inhale reach for the sky.
Breathe into the belly.
Exhale, bring it back down.
Listen carefully, step the
back foot up, Pyramid Pose
or half Pyramid
with the heel lifted.
Inhale to find extension,
look forward. Long in the spine.
Exhale to draw the
chin into the chest.
Beautiful, bend both knees
kick the left foot 
back out to your lunge.
Then we'll step the
right foot back, Plank Pose.
Inhale in nice and slow.
With control,
exhale to the belly.
Inhale, rise up Cobra, 
follow your breath.
As you exhale,
cascade it down.
Curl the toes
under lift up to Plank.
And then send the hips up
and back, Downward Facing Dog.
Bend the knees,
inhale to look forward.
Exhale to make
your way to the top.
Have some fun with it.
Good, on your next inhale,
lift it up halfway.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Root to rise here, 
inhale, reach for the sky.
Big breath, big stretch.
And then exhale, Forward
Fold all the way back down.
Nice, we're gonna
slide the left foot.
Now, first behind the right.
Forward Fold, breathe here.
And then back to 
center and then sliding
the right foot behind the left.
Relax the weight of the head,
the shoulders.
Press into all 
four corners of the feet.
So, be mindful of where
you're distributing your weight.
And then slowly
bring it back to center.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale, soften and fold.
Fingertips come to the mat.
We step the right foot back,
pivot on the back foot
and leading with the
right fingertips forward,
up and back 
we rise strong, Warrior II.
Find a focus out
beyond your left fingertips.
And use your breath
to really anchor you
in the present moment here.
Press into the knife
edge and your back foot.
Drop your center.
The power of being 
with the breath.
And just thinking of the
power of being with your breath
in a pose called "Warrior."
Hmmm?
Alright, inhale in.
Exhale, straighten
through that front leg,
lift the left fingertips
all the way up and back.
Big breath, big stretch,
lots of awareness in the neck.
Beautiful, then slowly
cartwheel it all the way
back to your lunge.
Right hand to the earth,
inhale, left fingertips 
up towards the sky.
Big belly breath here.
And slow and steady with
your exhale, slow and steady,
bringing it back.
Good, we'll step the
back foot up halfway.
Aim to draw the
right heel down on the earth
but if it's still lifted here
breathe and be present
with where you are today.
Wherever you are
in that back foot,
everyone inhale, 
lift and lengthen.
Send your gaze forward.
And then exhale, 
find that chin lock, draw it.
Good, bend both knees
kick the right foot back.
Here we go, 
plant the palms,
step the left toes back, 
Plank Pose.
So get the toes in
line with the hips here.
Reach the heels back.
You can work on the
knees here, if you like.
We're gonna hug the low ribs in.
We're gonna slowly,
slowly resist.
So you're gonna try your
best to not move the hips.
You're gonna bring
your left hand and touch
your right shoulder,
try not to move the hips.
And then bring it back down.
And, right fingertips 
to left shoulder.
And bring it back down.
And left to right,
and back down and right to left.
And bring it back down.
I'm trying not to move my hips.
And one more time to each side.
And then release.
Belly to the earth.
Nice. Inhale, Cobra.
Stretch it out.
Exhale, release.
Curl the toes under press
up to all fours or Plank.
Quietly, whisper to yourself,
"I am a strong." I am strong.
And send the hips
up high and back.
Downward Facing Dog, beautiful.
Pedal it out.
Inhale, lots of love in.
Exhale lots of love out.
Nice, inhale to look forward.
Exhale, to make your way
to the top, have some fun.
Inhale, lifts you up halfway.
Gorgeous, exhale,
Forward Fold.
Inhale, spread the fingertips.
Root to rise here,
reach for the sky.
And exhale all
the way back down.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale, Forward Fold.
Inhale, step the left foot back,
pivot it on the back foot.
Let's rise up, Warrior II.
Beautiful, relax
the shoulders down.
Find your focus, fierce.
Good, keep the front knee
bent this time, right fingertips
reach up and back.
Peaceful Warrior, inhale in.
Exhale, cartwheel it 
all the way back down.
Into the twist, inhale, 
follow your breath.
Exhale, all the way back down.
This time, step the
back foot up halfway.
We can stay here in our
Pyramid or a Pyramid variation
or we're gonna find a
little bend in that front knee,
a generous bend
in the back knee.
And we may lift the
left leg off, Standing Split,
left toes pointing down.
Fingertips are on the earth,
we're pulling up through
the right hip crease.
We're maybe bringing the
toes back down when we need
to and then lifting back up.
Think about lifting
from the left inner thigh.
And then we might
just wrap the hands
around the back of the
ankle or the calf here.
Left foot is flexed or pointed.
I like flexed to
really feel that connection
between my sits
bone and my heel.
Left toes down, lifting
from the left inner thigh.
Maybe you play with
finding that chin lock here.
And everyone inhale in, 
bend both knees.
Exhale, step the left toes back.
Good, plant the palms,
step it back.
Belly to Cobra, nice and slow.
And exhale to release.
Press up to Plank or all fours.
And Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale in deeply.
And exhale completely.
Bend the knees, 
inhale again to look forward.
Exhale, to make your way
to the top, Forward Fold.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale to soften and bow.
Beautiful, from here,
fingertips to the earth.
Step the right foot back,
pivot on the right foot,
right arm lifts us forward, 
up and back, Warrior II.
Head over heart,
heart over pelvis.
Nice, active breath here,
slow and in control.
Keep the front knee bent,
press into all four corners
of your front foot.
And here we go,
left fingertips reach up
and back, Peaceful Warrior.
And then slowly
cartwheeling all the way back
and into your twist.
Here we go, 
right hand to the earth,
left fingertips to the sky.
Breathe in.
Breathe out. Bring the
left hand all the way back.
Good, here we go.
Step the back foot
up halfway, Pyramid.
Then nice and easy we
can stay here or we can play
with our Standing Splits.
Have faith, trust the process. 
Here we go.
You have everything
you need to play here.
Might not emulate me exactly,
but that's not the point anyway.
So bend the front knee a little,
bend the back knee a lot
and use your vocabulary,
your connection to center,
pressing away from 
that standing leg,
that standing foot.
So not collapsing in the hip.
Lifting the left hip crease up.
Give it a try.
Right toes point down.
Working with nice leveled hips
or working with that sensation.
Right inner thigh is
spiraling up towards the sky.
And maybe we wrap the
hands around the ankle
or the calf here, in time.
Maybe we play
with the chin lock.
Maybe the toes are
actually only hovering an inch
or two above the ground.
One breath at a time.
So try not to give up.
Wherever you are
embody that presence fully.
Be kind, have faith in yourself.
Now everyone, wherever you are,
take a deep breath in,
bend both knees and
step that right foot back.
Good, plant the palms.
Belly to Cobra or
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Move with your breath.
Downward Facing Dog, last one.
And then slowly lower
the knees, Child's Pose.
Knees together 
or wide your choice.
Melting your heart down
and resting your head.
Close your eyes
and feel your breath.
And if Child's Pose,
whatever variation you took
is not a great place to lean in
to your breath.
Go ahead and make an adjustment.
We'll be here for
three to five breaths.
Just listening.
And one more moment here just
to a bit of a reverent moment
for the relationship
you have with your breath.
Finding yourself.
Finding your breath.
And whatever kind of
energy you have going here,
my dear friend,
no need to look at the
screen if you can just kind
of keep it, keep a
little reverence here.
Maybe keep the eyes
closed or the gaze soft.
As you slowly
transitioned all the way up
and then back onto the earth.
Nice, flat back position 
with the knees bent,
feet as wide as the mat.
Left hand comes to the heart,
right hand to the belly again.
Knees fall together so that
you're not holding or clenching
or working in any
part of the body.
You can completely relax here.
Eye lids get heavy,
we'll inhale in deeply.
And exhale to relax the
weight of your body completely
and fully into the earth.
Stay with your breath 
and with this energy
this awareness.
And if you feel distracted
in this moment, no worries.
I'm sure you're not the
only one, it's all good.
Just use the tool of
your breath to come back
and stay open to experiencing
your own presence.
Your own beautiful presence,
your own divine presence.
Slowly, we'll walk
the feet together
and then open the knees wide
but again, relaxing fully,
so, you're not holding,
but a little bit
of a surrender here,
relaxing the weight of the body.
From the head to the toes.
And then take 
an active breath here,
perhaps the biggest, 
most loving breath
you've taken all day.
Inhale in.
Exhale to center
yourself on the mat,
extend the legs out long.
Arms gently
extended at your sides
and then just allow
your breath to return
to a nice, easy rhythm.
If it feels right for you, 
tap into to a little inner smile.
It's Day 29.
Tomorrow's our last day.
But of course in every
end is a new beginning.
So I look forward to
tomorrow.
Look forward to seeing
you tomorrow and until then,
may you open your
heart and your mind
to having a deeper
connection with your breath
after you step off the mat.
And may your heart 
and mind be open
to believing in yourself.
Slowly bring the palms together.
Thumbs up to the third eye.
Tapping into that
inner smile, we whisper,
Namaste.
(bright upbeat piano music)
