- Hi, everyone!
Welcome back to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 19, baby. 
(mimics kissing)
Strength. Let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Alright, come on
down to the ground.
Find a nice, comfortable seat.
Just gonna take a second
to tune in to the
sound of the breath.
Benji, want to
join me for this part?
Want to come join us, tune in?
Nope, okay, okay.
Oh, there we go.
Alright, so we're
just going to come
into a comfortable seat,
and close your
eyes wherever you are.
And we'll bring our awareness
inward toward the breath
because I want to make
sure we begin today's session
coming together on this idea
that we get strength
from having a relationship,
a conscious relationship rather,
with our breath.
So I may joke around
talking about building muscle,
and it's okay to want to build
that muscle tone and get strong.
But for me, there's this incredible
almost poetic strength
that comes from building
a loving relationship 
with your breath.
So just take a second here.
If you want to put
your hands on your heart,
or on a pet (chuckles) or even
hold hands with a loved one
just take three more
breaths here, just in quiet.
And then when you're ready,
we're gonna come
forward on to all fours.
Take your breath with you.
Nice, conscious breath.
I was going to make a loud
joke about cuing Jock Jams,
but let's just come to all
fours and keep breathing instead.
Okay, spread the fingertips.
Knees underneath the hips,
wrists underneath the shoulders.
Inhale, drop the belly.
Look forward.
Exhale, navel lifts
you up from center, right?
Chin to chest, Cat Pose.
Inhale to drop the belly.
Follow the breath.
Exhale, Cat Pose.
Three more times with
the sound of your breath.
Nice, and then
turning the fingertips in,
either one hand at a time or
both hands at the same time.
Hey bud, do you want to move,
just so I can
demo this properly?
Thank you.
Then small gentle 
circles one way
and then the other.
And then we'll
walk the hands out.
Curl the toes under,
take a deep breath in.
Exhale, hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Benji goes down too, alright.
All is right in the world.
Stretching here, going inward,
claw through the fingertips.
Feel it out.
Mm, okie doke.
Now lower the knees.
Walk them together and back,
and shift your heart forward,
so the shoulders
are over the hips.
Hands are nice and wide,
shoulders over the hips.
Sorry, shoulders
are over the wrists.
Hands are nice and wide.
And we're nice and
engage in the center here
and in the glutes.
You can cross the
ankles here, if you like,
otherwise just
squeezing the feet together.
Inhale, look forward.
Exhale, you're going to
keep the elbows hugging
into the side body, lower down
halfway or as low as you can,
and then press back up.
Breathe out, good.
Breathe in lower down halfway.
And exhale, lift up.
So if it's not halfway for you,
you just go down as far as
you can without losing control
and then use your
exhale to press back up.
Find a little rhythm here,
inhaling to lower,
exhaling to lift.
It doesn't have
to be a big move.
See if you can draw
the navel in and up.
Find your center.
Moving in your own time,
taking breaks, if you need to.
Inhaling to lower,
exhaling to lift.
Keep the neck nice and long.
Good, do one more
wherever you are.
You got this.
If you took a break,
come on back into the game.
Let's do it together.
Lowering as we breathe in,
exhaling, as we
lift up, awesome.
Release your mermaid 
tail to the ground, (laughs)
and come all the
way to the belly.
Nice, from here forehead's
going to come to the earth.
You can center
yourself on the mat.
Then we're gonna
interlace the fingertips
behind the back,
squeeze the feet together.
Knuckles draw towards the heels.
So you'll feel this lift up
through the front of
the shoulder, the chest.
Keep this low, 
don't overdo it, inhale in.
Exhale, just lift the
head and the chest.
Keep your gaze down.
Breathing here.
Squeezing the legs.
Drawing the shoulders 
away from the ears.
Tuck your chin so
you feel that length
in the back of the neck.
You're here for three,
breathe deep, two, on the one,
with control slowly release.
Press back up to all fours.
I'm not that mean,
so take a nice
Extended Child's Pose here.
Send the hips back, 
walk the fingertips forward.
A little counter love
for those half push-ups.
You're gonna
bring the palms together,
and then all the
way up and back.
As you walk the elbows, 
inch them forward.
Should feel a nice
stretch in the arms,
particularly the triceps here.
Draw the deltoids, draw the
tops of the shoulders down.
Feel nice stretch in
the shoulder girdle,
and you have a little shark fin.
Namaste shark fin up and
over your head here, breathe.
Listen.
You find the
strength to stay curious
to keep coming
back for self-inquiry
through the
relationship with our breath.
You find that ocean sound
and here's a great
place to remember,
and a reminder that
that sound is for you.
It's not for anyone else.
It's for you and
maybe a higher power
if you wish, right?
It's between you
and your angels.
How about that?
Okay, release the arms.
Come on up.
Now cue Jock Jams.
(imitates techno music)
(laughing) into Downward Dog.
Hips up high and back.
Inhale in here.
Exhale.
Alright, walk it all the way up,
baby steps to the top
of the mat, Forward Fold.
So you know your body best.
I'm gonna invite you to
bring the feet hip width apart.
Sorry, feet together.
Excuse me, but if you
need to go hip width apart,
you are the boss.
Bend the knees,
drop the hips down low.
Drape the front body
over the lower body here.
Nice loving stretch 
to the low back.
Then when you're ready,
ground your all
four corners of the feet
and let's roll it up to Mountain,
nice and slow.
When you get there,
stand up tall.
Find your center, 
lift the heart.
And then we'll reach behind,
interlace the fingertips again,
draw the knuckles down and away,
open up through the chest.
Inhale in here.
Exhale, you're gonna
lift the right knee again
as if it were on a
marionette string.
We've practiced this before,
and if you're not necessarily
balancing on one leg here,
it's okay to take a break,
come back and give it a try.
So this can be a process
is what I'm trying to say.
It doesn't have to be like,
boom, hit your mark. (chuckles)
So you just kind of
want to start to integrate
these muscles that
help us balance on one leg.
Find your breath.
So we're not just
kind of holding on
for a wing and a prayer,
we're really building the
strength from the inside out.
Cool, lower the right leg down.
Inhale, lift your heart again.
Exhale, Forward Fold,
diving down fingertips 
stay interlaced,
but you can square
off the wrists here.
So open up a little bit.
Peek at me, if you need to.
Good, then feet together,
really together.
We're gonna bend the knees,
send the hips back,
fingertips go back,
release the bind
then they go down,
and then forward as if you're
holding your big beach ball,
Utkatasana, Chair Pose.
Drop your center, get down low.
Lift the toes, press in
all four corners of the feet.
Low back is long here.
Sink a little lower, inhale in.
Exhale, send the
fingertips back,
airplane arms.
Good, inhale, send them forward.
You got this.
Exhale, send them back,
airplane arms.
Stay low, inhale, reach forward.
Last one, exhale, airplane arms.
Then fingertips
go down to come up.
We rise up,
straighten through the legs.
Reach for the sky, and
exhale fingertips resting gently
down at your side.
Second side, interlace
the fingertips behind.
This time the thumb that
feels a little bit funky,
put that one on top,
so the bind that feels a
little more interesting.
Knuckles draw down and away,
we open up through
the pecs, the chest.
Oh take in this moment, breathe.
Just coming out
of our shells here,
where we spend so
many hours on the phone
or scrolling or
working on the computer,
or even journaling our feelings,
because wow what a
time we are living in.
So open up through your heart.
Lift up from the pelvic floor.
Find your center, inhale in.
Exhale, use this grounding
down of the knuckles
and all four
corners of the right foot
to lift that left knee up,
standing one-legged Tadasana.
Again, it can be a process.
We're working, we're here
for practice, not perfection.
Said the perfectionist, 
so it's all good, we're human.
We're working here,
building strength.
Beautiful, inhale in.
Exhale, left leg to the ground.
Keep the bind.
We're gonna slowly
dive forward into the fold.
Keep the bind
square at the wrist.
Nice for the forearms here.
The shoulder, of course.
Now here we go, bend
your knees generously.
Try to keep the shins
perpendicular to the earth,
I know it's difficult.
Send the hips back.
Ground through all four corners.
Here we go,
knuckles go back and down.
We release the bind,
and forward.
Benji exits the frame,
and Utkatasana, here we go.
Energy in the fingertips.
Sit down low.
This is the only 
round of this so let's
find our appropriate edge.
Inhale in.
Exhale, send the fingertips back
drop your center, airplane arms.
Neck is nice and long,
low back is as well.
Inhale, reach forward.
Sit back low.
Use this reaching
forward to counterweight.
Send the hips back.
Good, and then fingertips
back for airplane arms.
Inhale, reach forward.
Exhale, send it back.
Beautiful fingertips,
go down to come up.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale, this time
palms come together
and slide back 
to your heart space.
Inhale in here.
Try to control the breath.
Exhale, thumbs to the chest,
lift your chest to the thumb.
See if you can
feel your heartbeat.
Beautiful.
Now turn to the side.
We're gonna keep the
palms together at the heart.
We're gonna walk the
feet just a little bit wider
than hip width apart.
Toes pointing out,
heels in of course.
Inhale, lift your
sternum to your thumbs.
Exhale, draw the
shoulder blades together,
and feel them
kind of grounding down
melting down the back body.
So again, we have this loop.
We have this
lift in this ground,
and in this Goddess Pose 
that we're headed into,
you can think of of
those two opposing energies
working together, finding
yourself in between the two.
Finding that effort and
marrying it with the ease,
building strength with grace.
Todo, all of it, okay,
here we go, inhale.
Exhale, drop that center down.
So this doesn't
happen at the knees.
This happens because
we send our center down.
So the knees bend so that
we can do that appropriately.
And we're pressing into
the outer edges of the feet
compared to this wide
legged stance we've done before.
This should feel
really manageable,
but if not use your tools.
Inhale in, exhale
sink a little bit lower.
And then slowly, we're going
to open the arms, cactus arms.
Try to get the elbow in
line with the shoulders
so you can peek, if you need to.
Elbow in line with the shoulder.
Palms are open,
fingertips are spread.
Inhale in. Exhale, bring
the palms and the elbows
in towards center to touch.
Good, inhale, open.
Exhale, close.
Head over heart,
heart over pelvis.
Inhale, open.
Exhale, close.
Stay down low.
Inhale, open.
Exhale, close,
drop your center.
Inhale, open, and exhale close.
Beautiful, interlace
the fingertips here.
Stay down low.
Keep the fingertips interlaced
as you press the palms forward.
Maybe you sink down even lower
and then straighten the legs
as you send the
palms all the way up.
Back down, hands in
line with the heart,
bend the knees,
drop it and lift.
Straighten the legs.
Drop, inhale, lift.
Exhale, drop.
Inhale, lift.
Changing to Steeple Grip here.
Drop it, keep the
fingertips interlaced.
But now index
fingers pointing forward.
Inhale, lift.
You got this. 
Exhale, drop.
Inhale, lift, you got it.
Exhale, drop.
Last one, inhale, lift.
Exhale, drop.
Now from here, hands
come to the waistline.
Lift your right heel,
you got it.
Drop it down,
lift your left heel.
You got this.
Drop both heels, here we go.
All the way up.
Hands can stay on the waistline
or they can come
together in prayer
or all the way up to the sky,
spread your fingertips,
imagine you're
holding a big beach ball,
up and overhead, lift the heels.
We're here for, whoa.
Three, two, one.
Drop the heels,
reach for the sky.
Everyone straighten the legs.
Star Pose, send
it nice and wide,
so you're gonna widen the feet.
Take up space on your mat,
spread the fingertips.
Inhale in, biggest breath
you've taken all day.
And exhale, floating the
fingertips back to prayer.
Shimmying the feet
back underneath you.
Or you can hop the feet
together underneath you.
Come back to
standing in Mountain Pose,
releasing the
fingertips and we'll return
to the top of the mat.
Take a second here, 
notice how you feel.
Feel those strong muscles
of your legs kind of burning,
whispering your name.
Mine are going, Adriene.
Yo, Adriene.
That's the first time I
think I've done that to myself.
Hey, there's a
first for everything.
Reach for the sky, inhale in.
Exhale, fold it down.
Bend your knees, come
into a nice low squat.
From here nice and easy.
Use your hands to come
all the way back to a seat.
Can center yourself on your mat.
Keep the knees
lifted feet on the ground.
Then bring those toes up
so the heels are digging in.
We're gonna bring the
palms together at the heart.
My knees are in line
with the hip points here,
and slowly I'm going
to inhale, lift my chest.
And exhale, just lean back.
I'm using my heels to dig down,
my core's obviously on.
Inhale in here, exhale, 
I'm going to twist to the left.
Inhale to center, and
exhale twist to the right.
Inhale to center.
Exhale, twist to the left.
Inhale to center,
exhale, twist to the right.
One more on each side.
Inhale, exhale.
Inhale, exhale, beautiful.
Extend the legs,
reach for the toes.
Don't have to touch them,
just reaching forward.
Now point the toes and
slowly keep reaching forward,
reaching forward.
We're going to
roll down with control,
slow as you can go.
Nice and slow,
keep reaching forward.
Eventually the 
heart and the head
come to the earth.
We'll hug the right knee in.
And then take it over to
the left for a little twist.
Right arm opens,
close your eyes, breathe.
And then slowly melt
it back towards center
and switch, 
hug the left knee in,
and then guide it over to
the right for a little twist.
Close your eyes, breathe.
And then back to center,
hug both knees into the chest.
Option to peel the nose,
lift the head up
towards the knees.
Doesn't matter
if they come close,
just lifting up best you can,
feeling that
pressure in the low back.
Nice and easy.
I should say compression
rather than pressure,
more accurate.
And then slowly
release the head,
bring the
shoulders to the earth,
bring the palms to the knees,
and then just let
the low back lift up
as you kick the knees out
and just soft ankles here.
Just neutralizing little bit
in the low back and the spine.
You can tick tock a
little bit side to side,
if it feels right.
Then bring the feet 
down to the earth.
Relax the legs out, inhale in.
Exhale, breathing
out through the mouth,
through the lips here.
And one more time like that,
inhale in through the nose.
Let's sigh it out.
Take a second, close your 
eyelids, get really still.
Strength in surrender.
Practice of surrendering to that
which is beyond your control.
And also this
very special strength
that comes from stillness.
It's not always harder, faster,
stronger, more,
check, check,
check all the boxes,
but knowing when to be still.
I find great strength in that.
Breathe easy here.
Love strength and stillness.
It's like if you're
brave and courageous,
sometimes you're
gonna cross the line,
or you're gonna lose your
footing or your consciousness.
And instead of getting
tripped up over your mistakes
or whatever it is,
you find strength 
in just pausing,
getting real still.
And then starting again
with your consciousness,
with your breath.
Well, that's resonating
with me, I don't know about you.
Bring the palms together.
(chuckles)
Yes or no, it's okay.
Thanks for being here,
for taking the time to be
with yourself and to be with me.
I appreciate you sharing
your valuable time and energy
with me and with the
Yoga With Adriene community.
Bring the thumbs
up to the third eye.
Trust that the
nutrients of your practice
have settled in,
that it's working.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Take good care.
Inhale in, and final
breath here for today,
together we whisper,
Namaste.
(bright upbeat piano music)
