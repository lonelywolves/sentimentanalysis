- What's up everyone.
Welcome to Yoga with Adriene,
I am Adriene, this is Benji,
and today we have 
Total Body Yoga Deep Core.
So hop into something comfy,
and let's get started.
(bright music)
Alright, my darling friends,
let's begin today's practice
lying down on the ground.
Ooh, come on down, feel 
that support of your yoga mat
on your back, you 
made an amazing choice.
We're gonna jump right in today.
Bend your knees, bring the
soles of the feet to the ground.
Bring your hands to your belly,
and let's start to tap 
into a nice conscious breath.
Just close your eyes, 
send some love and respect
to your belly, 
to the abdominals,
to your stomach.
We're gonna
jump in with 
some floor work today
and then we'll end with a
little flow, a little vinyasa,
to help you feel 
awesome from head to toe.
But let's take a 
second here to close the eyes.
Feel the warmth of 
your hands on your belly.
And again, as you 
start to breathe...
Deeper, more consciously,
(chuckles)
searching for that right word,
send some love and respect to
where your hands 
are placed, to the belly.
And that's gonna be our approach
as we build strength 
in the abdominal wall
in the deeper core muscles.
Love and respect,
and always, 
conscious breath first.
Alright, just take 
one more cycle
of breath here 
to drop in, to land.
Alright, and then 
we'll slowly open the eyes,
bring the hands to the earth,
walk your heels up 
towards your sits bones,
towards your glutes,
and with the hands
and feet firmly 
planted on the earth,
you can take your 
gaze up towards the sky
and use the sound of 
my voice to guide you.
We're gonna press 
into your foundation
and slowly lift the hip 
points up for a baby bridge.
Squeeze the glutes, breathe in,
and then exhale to lower down.
Twice more like that,
shins forward,
hip points up to the sky,
lift your chest to your chin,
and then your chin all the
way up towards the heavens,
squeeze the glutes, 
and then slowly release.
One more, inhale in, 
ground through the feet,
lift the hip points up high,
shins forward, breathe in.
And then exhale to slowly
lower, breathe out. Awesome.
Interlace the fingertips now,
bring the hands behind the head.
Extend your thumbs to 
help cradle your neck here.
So it's difficult 'cause 
I'm not in the room with you
but we're gonna work really hard
to create extra 
awareness in the neck today
so you don't feel 
like you have any tension
or stress in the 
neck for this practice.
We're culturally 
accustomed to a crunch,
and even when I say 
there's no crunches
in the practices that I share,
people still respond like,
"Oh, my neck really 
hurt on the crunches."
So, just wanna share, 
reiterate, no crunching.
Inhale in, hug the lower ribs
in and down so 
that your low back
becomes flush with the mat,
and then again, no crunching.
Inhale in again, use your
exhale to reinforce that hugging
into the lower 
ribs and lift your head
and your gaze straight up,
keep the elbows wide.
Again, no crunching.
Neck nice and long.
Keep breathing here, 
if this is enough for you,
stay here breathing, 
maintaining easing in.
For a little more, 
we'll lift the shins
so they're 
parallel to the ceiling
and if your low 
back starts to come up,
draw the knees in just a bit.
But in time, you wanna work
to where the 
knees are over the hips.
Alright, now we're 
lighting a little fire.
You can rotate the ankles
one way, and then the other.
Notice as you get tired,
you're gonna wanna 
return that to crunch.
Mm-mm, keep that long,
beautiful awareness in the neck
as you breathe here for three,
for two, hug the lower ribs in,
and then we'll release,
feet down on the one.
Head down, elbows down.
Take one cycle 
of breath in here.
And out.
And breathe in again.
And exhale to lift the head, 
the neck, the shoulders.
No crunching, 
neck nice and long.
And if you like 
lifting the shins
knees over the hip points,
low back flush with the mat.
Alright, reinforce, 
scoop the tailbone up,
hug the lower ribs down,
gaze is straight up,
and even slightly 
back to help nurture
that length in the spine.
Nice static hold here.
This is our last static hold,
so hang with it.
Upper abdominals, and deep
lower belly abdominals drawing
in towards the 
center of your being.
Navel draws down here for three,
for two,
and one, release everything.
Take a deep breath in.
Long breath out.
You can windshield 
wiper the legs
a little back and 
forth if you like.
Alright, here we go.
Lifting the knees now.
Lifting the head, the neck,
the shoulders up.
Inhale in, exhale, extend
the right leg all the way out
and down as much as you feel
comfortable in the low back.
And then right 
elbow's gonna reach
towards the front 
left corner of your mat.
Inhale in.
Exhale out.
Inhale to come back to center,
both knees bent,
and then we'll switch,
extend the left leg.
Left elbow reaches towards the
front right corner of the mat.
Inhale in.
Exhale out.
Inhale to come back to center.
Beautiful, now back 
and forth in your own time,
pausing in the middle,
here we go.

look up, exhale to twist.
Inhale to center, 
look up, exhale twist.
Inhale center, exhale twist.
Inhale center, stick with me,
exhale twist.
Inhale center, exhale twist.
Energy in the feet,

Center, exhale twist.
One more time on each side.
Inhale, exhale twist.
Inhale, look up, exhale twist.
Beautiful, 
bring everything down,
hands can come to the belly.
Can give your belly a little
massage, love and respect.
Beautiful, alright, here we go.
From here we're gonna
send the fingertips 
forward and nice and slow,
just so we can 
reconnect low back to the earth.
You're gonna lift the 
knees over the hips again.
Alright, when you have it here,
we're gonna inhale in, exhale.
Lift the head, the neck,
the shoulders.
Try to keep the 
neck nice and long.
Great, so we lift 
head, neck, shoulders.
From here, we're 
gonna straighten the legs.
Good, then from here, you're
gonna connect to your core,
rock all the way up,
sit up, reach up,
and then slow and steady roll
it all the way back down.
Back to one, knees 
above the hips, here we go.
Inhale to lift 
the head, the neck,
the shoulders, reach forward.
Beautiful, exhale 
to straighten the legs.
Inhale in again. 
And here we go,

Rolling it down nice and slow.

reach it up, lift it up.
Slow and steady, roll it down.

So awesome, so wonderful.
We're gonna cross the 
right ankle over the left.
Grab the outer edges of 
the feet or your big toes
and we're gonna rock and roll
up and down the 
length of the spine here.
You can rock once or twice,
Three times a lady.
Old joke, but hey, 
let's bring it back.
And then we're gonna 
meet in a Tabletop Position.
Alright, let's get
our flow on, guys.
Hopefully, you're 
feeling that gentle, loving,
respectful burn in 
the abdominal wall.
Let's stretch it out with a
little Cat-Cow, here we go.
Inhale, drop the belly.
Ooh, yeah, and then exhale,
round through.
Inhale, drop the belly.
Exhale, round, through, this
should be an amazing practice
that you can bookmark to 
repeat over and over again.
Continuing with your Cat-Cow,
and then when you're ready,
curling the toes under 
and peeling your tailbone
all the way up for 
Downward Facing Dog.
Take a second to 
really pedal it out
and find a nice 
connection through the hands.
Notice how that 
awareness of your foundation
always translates all the way up
throughout the 
structure of the whole body.
Yeah, then here we go, 
bend the knees, both knees,
belly comes towards 
the tops of the thighs.
We inhale then 
look forward and exhale,
step or hop to the top.
Uttanasana, Extended 
Standing Forward Fold,
let it all hang here,
let any stress
or tension you might have come
onto the mat with, 
choose to let it go here.
Maybe giving 
yourself an opportunity
to roll up to Mountain Pose with
a little less weight 
on your back, here we go.
When you're ready, tuck the
chin and roll up to stand.
And as you rise up into 
your beautiful tall Mountain,
notice if you're 
clenching or holding anywhere,
if you can soften as you 
ground through the feet,
lift through the heart, 
lengthen through the neck,
and let's flow, here we go.
With your breath, inhale,
reach for the sky,
spread your fingertips.
Exhale, Forward Fold

into your side body
as you come all the 
way down to the belly.
Inhale for Cobra,
open the chest.
And exhale to release,

and then make your way 
to Downward Facing Dog.
Take a deep 
breath in here.

Anchor the left heel,

Pause here, try to 
touch your right heel
to your right glute, 
finding that hollow body.
Beautiful, then slowly

left fingertips to the sky.
Breathe in, breathe out, find
that connection to your core
as you breathe out and 
then you're gonna reverse it,
sending it all the way up 
and back, Reverse Triangle.
And then Triangle nice and slow.
One more time, reverse it.
Legs stay strong.
And from center,

come into a nice high lunge.
Connect to your 
core here as you inhale,
reach for the sky,
and then exhale,
paint it all the 
way down nice and slow,
back to a nice low lunge,
beautiful.
From here, 
step the right toes back,
belly to Cobra, or 
now maybe Chaturanga
(chuckling) to 
Upward Facing Dog.
Moving with your breath.
We'll meet together in Downward
Facing Dog, take your time.
Moving with your breath.
Alright, back in Downward Dog,

lead with the right 
fingertips forward, up and back,

So try to stack the spine here,
breathing deep, 
control your breath.
Then from Virabhadrasana II,
we'll straighten that front leg,
lead with the left 
fingertips forward,
up and back, Reverse Triangle.
Now low belly and upper 
abdominals come together
for a feeling of stability
here as you take 
it into Triangle.
Beautiful, same thing 
from center, navel draws in.
We send it all the way back,
Reverse Triangle.

We'll meet back in 
Downward Facing Dog,

From your Downward Facing Dog
draw your navel in, 
let that be the inspiration
to roll back through to a Plank.
You're killin' it, 
you're doin' great.
From here, you're 
gonna hug the right knee in
towards your chest, 
then kick it back out.
Hug the left knee in,
and kick it back out.
Keep your gaze straight down,
neck nice and long.
We're ending this session with
Mindful Mountain Climbers.
If this is not 
good for your wrist,
you can flip onto 
the back and repeat
the Yogi Bicycles 
that we did before.
Alright, team, let's do this,
we're moving with the breath.
We're taking breaks 
if we need to.
But there is a beautiful,
loving, respectful invitation
to meet your edge today, 
meet your appropriate edge.
If you wanna pick up the pace
for a little extra warmth
to get your heart rate up,
go ahead and do it now.
We're breathing. 
Building strength mindfully.
And you're here for five,
pick back up
if you've taken a break, four,
ready, let's finish 
altogether, three.
Two, and on the one, 
gentle belly flop to the earth.
(softly sighs) You did it.
Inhale in.
Exhale out.
Inhale, Baby Cobra.
And exhale to release, awesome.
Press back up to all fours.
Go ahead and come 
through to a seat.
If you need to 
take a moment here
to rotate the wrists 
one way and then the other,
go ahead and do it now.
And then we'll 
just take a second
to bring the hands 
together and control the breath.
Take a second 
also to give thanks
for this amazing 
time that you've taken
for yourself, way to show up.
As you're ready, bring 
the thumbs to the third eye,
we'll take one 
more final breath in
and exhale to bow.
Namaste.
