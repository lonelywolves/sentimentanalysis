- Hi, everyone, welcome to Home,
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 9 (sighs)
and it's coming in 
just at the perfect time.
This is our inquiry practice.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alrighty, my friends,
let's begin in a nice,
comfortable seat.
Come on down to the ground.
Here we go.
Really getting into Week 2
of this journey here today by
spiraling back to this idea of
our practice as this beautiful
time to foster self study,
this self inquiry 
and really making
the practice about that.
So as we begin 
to add vocabulary,
which we are, I think it's
important maybe my job as your
friend and as your humble guide
here to remind you that this
time is really 
about examining yourself.
And through this practice,
hopefully we'll be able to
kind of close the 
gap between, you know,
what feels real and honest and
the way in which we're living in
and really see if we can bring
those two qualities 
together as one.
Okay, hopefully 
you're in a nice,
comfortable seat by now.
Let's just take a second 
to close the eyes or
soften the gaze, 
relax your shoulders and
just drop in here to the moment.
Whatever is going on in 
this moment here today,
Day 9.
Maybe you're feelin' fine.
Maybe you're feeling divine.
Or maybe you're not. (chuckles)
This practice, particularly
the Find What Feels Good yoga
I think, you know, 
is a constant invitation
to just show up as you are.
Come as you are so you can
drop any need or desire
to accomplish anything
or show up with 
a certain prerequisite.
There is none.
So just a friendly reminder.
Then bring your awareness, 
begin to transition
your attention to your breath.
And again, as we 
begin to layer on,
add some more vocabulary to this
dance we're doing here together.
Just remember, this is 
about you taking opportunity,
taking this time for yourself
to examine what feels good,
what feels honest, 
what it feels like you
and through the regular
practice, which just what is
so wonderful about 
this 30-day journey,
we begin to close the 
gap between how we feel
and how we want to feel.
Mhmmm, mhmmm.
Draw the hands together.
Take a deep breath in.
Let's have some fun today.
Exhale, bow the 
head towards the heart.
Feel that stretch in 
the back of the neck.
Drop your shoulders down.
Let your shoulder 
blades come together
and melt down the back body.
So take a second here 
to just examine this shape.
If you're distracted, 
no, no worries.
You're human.
But see if you can bring
your awareness to this shape.
And let it influence 
the way you feel.
The same thing with the breath,
let the breath
embody the 
pose best you can.
I know that was a lot of 
kind of buzz words there
but whatever that means to you.
And just keep 
noticing how you feel.
Lift the chin, bat the eyelashes
open and we're going to slowly,
gently, lovingly come 
forward onto all fours.
When you get there,
Tabletop Position,
just bump the hips a 
little left to right.
Spread the fingers wide.
Listen to your creaky old floor
if you have one like mine or
your creaky body, 
(laughs) I love your body.
(mimicks kissing)
And let's give it 
some love today.
Right, it was 
really focusing on
this idea of the 
practice as self study.
Are we going to get 
strong on this journey?
Yes.
Maybe your abs 
are a sore from Day 6?
Yes.
Are we gonna get stronger?
Could we trim, tone,
feel more alive in our center?
Absolutely.
But how you get
there is everything, right?
Totally affects how you 
feel in every circumstance.
So be kind, inquire.
Walk the hands forward,
bring the hips back to center.
Curl the toes up, 
peel the tailbone up high,
and then just keep that little
sway from one foot to the next.
One hip to the next.
You might even pick one foot up
and then place it down gently.
Pick the other foot up,
place it down gently.
If you're wearing a 
sweater here or a baggy shirt,
I love how like sometimes you
can go into your own little kind
of love cave here in the shirt.
You guys think 
I'm kidding but I'm not.
It's these little things, right,
that you just kind of embrace
in the at-home yoga practice.
There's a lot of room 
for some really just juicy,
loving, cool self study in the
at-home yoga practice because
it's yours and you're in control
of it, one hundred percent.
Alright, anchor 
the left heel down.
On your inhale, slide your right
leg up high Down Dog split.
No need to really reach 
the right heel up super high,
especially if you're 
new to the practice.
Focus on the quality of the
movement and the stability that
you can create for yourself.
So dial the right toes down.
Try to keep maybe 
the hips level here
or anchoring through 
the left heel.
We're clawing 
through the fingertips.
Inhale in.
Exhale, slow and easy you're
gonna step the right foot up.
Nice low lunge.
Just lower the back knee down.
Take a second here.
Just waking up.
You can find that 
sway again back and forth.
Good, use your inhale 
to lift you, look forward.
Exhale, plant the palms, 
just step it right back to
Downward Dog, nice and easy.
Alright, reconnect 
through the hands.
Reconnect with the 
breath and on your next inhale,
anchor through the right heel.
So this is the anchor, 
right heel down
and then left leg 
slides up slow.
Down Dog split 
or Three-Legged Dog.
Check it out.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
And then when you're ready,
slowly shifting forward,
stepping that left foot up,
nice low lunge.
Sink down low, 
right knee kisses the earth.
Find that sway here, 
a little left or right.
Good, let your inhale lift
your heart, look forward.
Let your exhale 
bring the palms down.
And here we go, back 
up to Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale in deeply here.
Bend the knees, melt your
belly towards your thighs
as you breathe out.
Good, drop the heels.
Take one cycle of breath here.
Just listen.
Great, bend your knees.
Inhale carve a line with 
the nose to look forward.
Nice and easy you're 
gonna step your way to the top,
nice and slow.
Feet hip width 
apart or flush together,
your choice, just nice,
conscious footing.
Forward Fold.
Bend your knees here to start.
Use your breath to 
invite a sense of calm.
A wash of soothing energy
to the nervous system
that can get quite stressed out.
Overworked.
Then ground through the feet.
Slowly begin to roll up,
take your time.
Right away, find a big 
inhale to reach the arms
all the way up to the sky.
Big breath here, big stretch.
And then exhale hands to heart.
Namaste.
Here we go, bend the knees.
You're gonna send the 
hips back way, way back.
Send the fingertips forward to
counterbalance this weight as
you press into your heels.
Keeping the ball joint of the
big toe mound and the ball joint
of the pinky toe mound firmly
planted on the earth as well.
Feet can be hip width apart here
or if they're flush together,
really squeeze and 
zip up through the legs.
Chair Pose.
Just notice your breath here.
Soften through 
the skin of the face.
Relax your shoulders,
take your thumbs up,
pinkies down here.
One more breath. Maybe 
you sink a little bit lower,
creating a little heat.
Now check it out,
on your next inhale open 
up to the right side.
Take your right fingertips
back, left fingertips forward.
Try to stay low.
Inhale fingertips 
come back to center.
Beautiful. 
Now open up to the left.
Stay low.
Good, inhale back to center.
Here we go.
Inhale in again.
Exhale all the way down.
Straighten the legs,
Forward Fold.
Good, inhale lifts you up
halfway, your version.
Exhale to bend the knees,
plant the palms,
step one foot back 
and then the other,
Plank Pose.
Downward Facing Dog, hips 
up high and back from here.
Take a deep breath in
and empty it out.
Inhale, lift your 
right leg up high.
Down Dog splits, 
Three-Legged Dog.
If this is too much for you 
can always practice these
with the left knee down.
Work here.
Inhale in.
Exhale, right knee comes all 
the way up and forward to
kiss the right elbow.
Again, we can do 
this on the knee.
Left knee down.
Inhale, kick it up,
Three-Legged Dog.
Exhale, shift forward,
nice and slow.
Slight bend in the elbows.
Right knee kisses left elbow.
Good, inhale, kick it up.
Now all the way up into 
your lunge with control,
nice and slow, 
step it all the way up.
Keep the back knee lifted here.
You know the option is 
there for you to lower it.
Inhale, we rise.
Big gesture, big breath.
Fingertips up towards the sky.
Now find that 
connection to center.
Find that midline.
Hands can always come 
to the waistline here.
Inhale, straighten both legs,
you got this.
Find that lift 
with the breath in.
Exhale, bend your knee.
We're gonna twist 
to the right here,
palms come together.
Look past your right shoulder.
Back knee can lower here 
for a little more stability.
We got this, inhale in.
Exhale, drop your 
left hand to the earth,
right fingertips 
up towards the sky.
Good, wiggle the 
right fingertips.
Reach, reach, reach.
Then slowly dial your 
heart back down to your lunge.
Beautiful, step 
the right toes back.
Plank Pose, 
take a deep breath in.
Strong and steady.
Exhale, hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Beautiful work.
Inhale in here.
Empty it out.
Anchor through the right heel.
Here we go, inhale, 
slide the left leg up high.
Nice and slow.
So find it.
Pay attention.
Stay curious.
Inhale in.
Exhale, slow shift forward,
left knee kisses left elbow.
So the upper body's 
in Plank here.
Good, inhale, 
kick it up with control.
Exhale, here we go.
Left knee kisses right elbow.
Nice and slow.
Good, inhale, kick it up.
All the way into your lunge,
here we go, nice and slow.
Great, remember, 
if that foot doesn't make it,
you can just use 
your hand or do a little,
you know, do-si-do
here to get it there.
It's all good.
Alright, nice and easy here.
Back knee can lower or we'll
keep it lifted as we rise up,
nice high lunge.
Hands on the 
waistline or big breath,
big gesture, fingertips 
all the way to the top.
Everyone hug 
those little ribs in.
Find that support 
for the back body.
Find your expression today.
You can experiment 
from day to day.
That's why we're here.
Good, and then 
on your next inhale,
straighten both legs.
Lift, lift, lift from 
the pelvic floor we lift
all the way up on the inhale.
Exhale, bend the front knee and
we twist to the left this time.
Palms come together,
right elbow to the
outer edge of the left thigh.
Breathe deep.
Look past left shoulder.
Nice, and then slow and steady,
right hand comes to the earth.
On an inhale, let's send 
the left fingertips up high.
Squeeze your left knee 
in towards the center line.
Wiggle the left fingertips, and
then slowly breathe out as you
bring it back down to
your lunge, nice work.
Plant the palms, 
step it back to Plank.
Inhale in here.
Fill it up.
Exhale, hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog, nice.
Inhale lots of love in here.
Exhale, lots of love out.
Beautiful, bend your knees.
Inhale to look forward.
You can hop or slow 
crawl your way to the top.
Feet together 
or hip width apart.
Hi Benji.
What a sweet little 
sleeping Downward Dog.
On an inhale halfway lift.
Go ahead and turn your head.
Look at Benji. (laughs)
Downward sleeping dog and
then let's go ahead and 
bring it back, Forward Fold.
Shake the head 
a little yes, a little no.
Beautiful.
Bend your knees, 
send your hips back.
Fingertips reach forward again
as we sink back into 
our Chair, Utkatasan.
Inhale in.
Exhale, drop the shoulders.
Sink a little lower.
Inhale in, 
spread the fingertips.
You got this.
Exhale, sink a little lower.
Last breath cycle, you got it.
Stick with it.
Squeeze the legs together.
Inhale in.
Exhale, sink a little lower.
And then yay, hallelu, 
inhale, straighten the legs,
reach up high, maybe 
slight back bend here.
Exhale, hands to heart.
Pause.
Capture thine own magic here.
Notice how you feel.
Feel that prana, that energy,
that flow moving,
coursing throughout your body.
It's there.
But sometimes it's just our
ability to notice it or our
willingness to pay attention to
it that might be 
a little bit lacking.
Great.
Open the eyes, bend the knees.
Here we go, inhale,
reach for the sky.
Exhale, Forward Fold.
Inhale halfway lift,
your version.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Good. Bend the knees.
Plant the palms.
Step one foot back,
then the other.
You can slowly lower to your
knees here and just go all the
way to the belly or 
shift forward on the toes,
squeeze the elbows in 
and with control we lower
all the way down to the belly.
Inhale, open your chest, 
a little baby Cobra here.
And exhale to 
soften and release.
Go ahead and come 
on to your elbows here.
Try to keep your elbows
right underneath your shoulders.
You can interlace the fingertips
or just come into a little
(chuckles)
mudra of agreement
with the hands together.
But what I'd like 
to invite you to do
is not collapse 
in the shoulders.
So it's like 
you're at a slumber party,
but you are still 
mindful of your shoulders.
Alright, okay.
So we're creating a little
strong base for us to work with
some froggy legs in the hips.
Don't panic.
Inhale in, you got this.
Press into your elbows.
On an exhale, I'd like for
you to hug the low ribs in,
this is gonna 
protect low back.
So hug the low ribs, feel your
abdominal wall kind of turn on.
(clicks tongue)
And then we're gonna 
start with the left knee.
We're gonna bend the left knee,
we're gonna pull 
it all the way up.
We're using the ground here
to help us with this opening,
this experiment, this inquiry.
You're gonna want to lean
towards the right side of the
body and that's a-okay but see
if we can use all this kind of
work we do in our Three-Legged
Dogs and even on all fours,
see if you can press 
into both elbows evenly here.
If your knee doesn't come up
this high 'cause the hips are
tight, that's to be expected.
So just keep it nice 
and low here to start.
And then in time 
you can work, ah,
find more mobility 
in that hip socket.
And I'm gonna 
help you with that.
So breathe deep here.
Softening on the exhale,
using that inhale to 
maybe to lift the heart.
Good, take one more breath.
Inhale in.
Exhale, maintain that connection
with the low ribs hugging in
just to protect, can 
never be too careful.
Protect the low back, you're
gonna bring it all the way back
to a kind of 
Sphinx variation here.
Reset and then 
when you're ready,
peel the right knee up.
And it's nice to have that
core connection because you can
really feel like I'm moving
from the middle even here.
Alright, notice how 
this side is different.
Again, there's gonna 
be a tendency to kind
of come out of it, 
lean to the left side.
I'm exaggerating, of course,
but you're gonna feel it 
so find the symmetry.
We don't always 
need symmetry in yoga.
More on that from me
in the Find What Feels 
Good Membership and
just all over but this is kind
of a nice moment to honor the
symmetry by pressing 
into both elbows evenly.
Staying connected to your core.
If you need to ease up, 
just bring the knee down.
If we want a little more, bring
the knee up and then try to find
a nice right angle.
We're breathing.
We're sending love 
into that low back.
Shoulders are relaxed.
We're talking 
full body awareness,
one more breath.
Yay! And then slowly 
bring it all the way back.
Great, hands are gonna 
come where the elbows are.
If you want more fire 
press into Plank otherwise
just press up to all fours.
Then curl the toes under.
This has to be slow.
Trust me.
Upper arm bones rotate out,
inhale in, slow peel.
Why does it have to be slow?
'Cause it feels 
good in the low back.
The way you move matters.
And you can discover just how
true that is the more you commit
to this idea of self inquiry or
this asana practice 
being about self study.
Alright, here we go, inhale.
Lift the right leg up high.
Exhale, you're gonna slowly
bring it all the way up and in.
Right knee all the way up
and then we're coming into a
One-Legged Pigeon here.
So we're gonna take the
right foot and crawl it out just
enough, just as much 
as we feel comfortable.
(chuckles) Pull my shirt down.
And then we're gonna 
look back at that left leg
and just root it down firmly.
Let this be the 
root of this posture.
And we're gonna grow this here
together so just taking it nice
and slow, we'll return to 
it throughout this journey.
But so no need
to slam into this, right?
Like, "Oh, Pigeon!
Got to get the most out of it."
Be here now, right?
You can stay up nice and tall.
If it feels good to 
come back down to the elbows,
clasp the hands, 
go ahead and do that.
And if it feels right
today to bow the head, let go.
Close your eyes.
Tune in, once again, 
to the sound of your breath.
Then let your 
breath cue this transition,
so take a deep breath in,
breathe into 
your belly, low back.
And then exhale, 
navel draws in and up,
that's your cue to 
slowly bring the hands back up,
unravel to all fours or Downward
Facing Dog, your choice.
Depending on your energy level.
Let's go, second side.
Inhale just to lift 
the left foot up high.
Exhale to bring it 
all the way up and in.
So you have to pay attention,
notice how the left and the
right side are different.
I know you know this, 
just a little reminder.
And then take a look 
back at this right leg.
You're gonna let this be 
the root of this posture.
And there's a tendency kind of
for the ankle to cycle here.
This is a little detail but
see if you can straighten out
through the toes, 
the bones of the foot and
the ankle and breathe.
Woo!
The attentiveness 
I find in the asana
is really what it's all about.
On to the forearms,
maybe forehead bows.
Just take a couple 
sweet breaths here.
I encourage you 
to close your eyes
if it feels comfortable for you.
Go inward here, tune 
into the sound of your breath.
Notice where your thoughts go.
It's all good.
Part of the practice.
Acknowledge them, then go ahead
and bring it back to the sound
of your breath here as 
we breathe in together.
Inhale.
Yes, and exhale.
Let that cue your lift up,
hands come to the earth.
Again, we'll slowly unravel
to all fours or 
Downward Dog, last one.
Take a deep breath in.
And as you exhale out 
just slowly lower the knees.
We're gonna come 
through to a seat.
You can also come to lie flat on
your back if your body's craving
that here for this practice.
Let's take a second 
to find stillness here.
Let the nutrients and the
benefits of today's session just
kind of fall into place.
Allow, allow.
And you don't 
have to do anything,
so I feel like particularly
with at-home yoga,
there's this constant 
sometimes nagging question:
Am I doing it right?
And the thing is, you know,
you know when 
you're doing it right.
But it's my great honor and
pleasure to be here to help
guide that, and I thank you so
much for sharing your valuable
time and energy with me.
Wherever you are let's 
bring the palms together.
Feel the warmth of 
your palms kissing together.
Feel the energy of your 
body wherever you are today.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale to relax your shoulders.
On your next inhale,
bring the thumbs 
right up to your forehead.
Ah, inner teacher, what's up?
Sometimes I like to say 
get hot for inner teacher.
(clicks tongue)
Thank you for going 
on the ride here today.
I look forward to 
seeing you tomorrow.
In the meantime, be well.
Honor that inner voice
and let's celebrate the 
learning process, right?
Never not learning.
I love you.
Take a deep breath in.
And exhale, we'll close 
it out by whispering
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
