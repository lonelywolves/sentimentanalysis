- What's up, everyone?
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
I'm Adriene, and this is Benji,
and today is Day 3: Awaken.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alrighty, my darling friends,
let's begin today's practice
on all fours in 
Tabletop Position.
As always, take 
your time getting there.
Come on down, 
take a deep breath in.
Place your wrists 
underneath your shoulders,
your knees directly 
underneath your hip points,
and let's start with some
spinal flexion today right away,
syncing up with the breath.
Inhale to drop the belly,
open the chest.
And exhale to round through,
drawing the 
navel up chin to chest.
Soften your gaze here
or close your eyes 
as you inhale, Cow Pose.
And exhale, Cat Pose.
Keep it going.
Nice and slow here to start.
Starting our Awaken practice
with this spinal flexion,
moving any stagnant energy
or inviting any
stagnant or stuck energy
to move throughout our practice.
On your next inhale,
go ahead and come 
to Tabletop Position.
And then look 
down at your hands.
Spread the 
fingertips super wide.
Then you're gonna 
draw a little awareness
in towards your center,
activating your core by hugging
the low ribs up just a bit.
Then slowly, nice and easy,
holding on to this 
connection to your midline,
kick your right leg out.
Dial your right toes down
so we're kind of lifting up
through the right inner thigh,
and you can stay here,
inhaling deeply,
exhaling completely,
or we're gonna add the 
element of the left arm
as Benji comes back to practice,
sending the left 
fingertips forward,
left thumb up towards the sky.
It's as if you were kind of
shaking someone's hand here.
Already starting to 
awaken the whole body,
not just parts of the body,
but the whole body.
Inhale in here.
Exhale, draw it all in.
Elbow comes in, knee comes in,
and we round through the 
spine just like Cat Pose.
Inhale to extend.
You're not doing a lot 
of these, stick with it.
Exhale, round through.
Last one, inhale, extend.
Exhale, round through.
Beautiful.
Bring your left hand, 
right knee back to the earth.
Re-center, regroup.
Find that Tabletop Position.
And then when you're ready,
hug the low ribs in.
Find that connection 
to your midline
and begin to kick 
your left foot out.
Dial the left toes down.
Left inner thigh 
shines up towards the sky.
We hold on to this connection
in our center, our core,
waking up a little 
bit of fire in the belly.
And then here we go, option,
you can stay on both hands,
or option to reach the 
right fingertips forward.
Right thumb towards the sky,
gaze straight down.
Here we go, big inhale.
Exhale, bring it in,
rounding through 
the spine nice and slow.
Inhale to extend, spread the
fingers, spread the toes.
And exhale, round it through,
navel draws up, up, up.
Inhale to extend, last one.
Exhale, bring it all in,
and return back to the table.
Awesome work.
Walk the hands 
out a little bit wide.
Rotate your upper 
arm bones externally,
so left upper 
arm bone to the left,
right upper arm 
bone to the right.
Curl the toes under, 
take a deep breath in.
And exhale, peel the hips up high,
then send them back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Claw through 
the fingertips here.
Make sure you're 
not holding the neck.
Continue to hug the low ribs in,
activating the abdominal wall.
And then nice and easy,
you're gonna slowly bend 
your right knee to center
and turn to look 
underneath your left arm.
Big breath here in and out.
Then drop the right heel,
bend the left 
knee as you bring it
into the center of your mat.
Peek at me if you need to.
And then, 
rotating in the spine here
as you press into 
both palms evenly,
turn to look 
underneath your right arm.
Excellent, come back to center.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale out through the mouth.
Nice work.
Bend the knees, inhale.
Carve a line with the nose.
Look forward and exhale,
make your way to the top.
You can step, hop,
take baby steps.
We'll meet at the Forward Fold.
Now take three 
cycles of breath here,
just letting the blood flow,
inviting the nervous system
to be calm.
Finding your foot-to-earth
connection here.
And then when you're ready,
bend the knees generously.
Belly comes toward 
the tops of the thighs.
Tuck your chin and roll it up.
Press evenly through 
all four corners of the feet
as you stack up 
through the spine.
As you're ready, 
find that natural lift
in the sternum, the heart.
Relax your shoulders down,
Mountain Pose.
Inhale in here.
Long exhale, 
awakening the breath.
And on your next inhale,
let's reach up.
Reach for the sky, 
big breath, big stretch.
Exhale, Forward Fold.
Inhale lifts you up halfway.
Your version, 
find that length in the neck.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Bend the knees, plant the palms,
step one foot back, 
then the other, Plank Pose.
Find that core connection,
you got this.
Inhale to look forward,
shift forward.
Exhale, lower all the way 
to your belly with control.
On an inhale, lift up, Cobra.
Can keep it nice 
and soft and easy.
Exhale to slowly release
forehead back down.
Curl the toes under, here we go.
Inhale in, exhale, 
to press up Half Plank
or power up full Plank.
Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale in here.
Exhale out through the mouth.
Good, bend the knees.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale to step 
or hop to the top.
You can take 
baby steps here, too.
I'm a fan.
From your Forward Fold,
let your inhale 
lift you up halfway.
Tailbone reaches back, crown
of the head reaches forward.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Root to rise, here.
Spread the fingertips, ground
through the feet, here we go.
Big inhale as you 
reach up towards the sky,
maybe a slight backbend 
here as you lift your heart.
And then exhale, hands 
come together and back down.
Observe the breath here.
Connecting this journey.
Each day we turn a page 
into the present moment,
taking the themes of recognizing
our focus on 
setting an intention,
and now integrating those things
into the practice 
of awakening the body,
awakening the breath.
And this idea that 
we have the opportunity
when we step on the mat
to potentially awaken 
anything that might have
been asleep, dormant,
something that's 
capable of being active
but that has been inactive.
Release your hands 
gently to your sides.
You're gonna 
step your feet wide,
about as wide as the mat.
I'm gonna turn this way.
So, my number 
one tip for awakening
that which has 
been lying dormant
is this next move.
If you've been in the community
for a while, you know it.
It's called 
Knocking at Heaven's Door.
You're gonna soften your knees.
Careful not to 
lock the knees here
so that we can protect them.
So, soft knees here to start,
and you're just gonna 
start with a gentle sway.
If this is new to you, 
it might feel a little weird,
but remember your 
commitment to yourself, right?
Show up with all you've got.
It's okay to smile and have fun.
You're gonna start to 
swing a little side to side
with the arms, 
soft bend in the knees.
And then start 
to really articulate
a movement left and then right,
and let your gaze and your
heart and your center of gravity
kind of move with you.
You can start to smack 
your booty a little bit.
Why not? (chuckles)
And again, soft in the knees.
And then traditionally, we
sync up with the breath here,
with a nice, sharp exhale.
But for now, Day 3,
I just want you to 
sync up with your breath
in a way that feels good.
It could be inhaling to one
side, exhaling to the other.
It could just be 
some full, deep breaths.
If you need to sigh it out,
trust me, you'll 
know if you need that,
then take it, baby.
This time is for you.
Moving back and forth,
now starting to 
pick up with speed.
This requires a 
little bit of discipline
and a willingness 
to stir the pot,
to move the furniture around
and wake up
that which has been sleeping.
Alright, keep it going for 10.
Keep it going, nine.
Pick up your pace, eight,
seven,
six, it's okay 
if you're laughing.
Five, four,
three, two, and on the one,
start to slow it down,
Knocking on Heaven's Door.
Alright, if you're 
practicing with someone
and you're kind of 
giggling here, it's okay,
but let's try to capture this
by bringing the feet together,
really together, 
palms together at the heart.
Gaze down past your 
nose or close your eyes
and just notice how you feel.
See if you can 
feel any sensation
that might have been stirred.
We're also inviting 
the brain and the body
to make this agreement 
that our daily practice
is not just about 
gross movements, you know,
these surface 
level muscle-building,
toning, trimming actions,
although those are 
awesome and important.
But there's this 
whole inner world
to prioritize,
to awaken,
and to pay attention to,
because if we are not actively
paying attention to it,
it can fall asleep.
And when it falls asleep,
it just reacts to 
your external world.
Just constant state of reaction.
Whoa, okay bat 
your eyelashes open.
If you're not already 
at the top of your mat,
go ahead and step there.
Big inhale, let's catch a wave.
Reach for the sky.
Exhale, rain it down,
Forward Fold.
Inhale halfway lift, 
your version.
Move with your breath.
Exhale to soften 
and fold it down.
Plant the palms, 
step the right foot back.
Step the left foot back.
Inhale to look forward,
shift forward,
squeeze the elbows 
into the side body.
Exhale, lower all 
the way to your belly.
Inhale to lift up, 
Bhujangasana, Cobra.
Exhale to soften and release.
Good, curl the toes under.
You're gonna press 
to all fours, here.
Inhale, kick the 
right leg out again.
Left arm forward.
Inhale in.
Exhale, you're gonna 
bend your right knee,
bend your left elbow.
Hug onto the midline.
Maybe we reach back, 
grab the top of the right foot.
Now slowly begin to 
kick your right foot out.
Open up through 
the left shoulder.
Big breath in as 
you look forward.
And then exhale to release.
Nice.
Inhale, kick the left foot out.
We can work on this 
with just the lower body,
opening the lower body, 
playing here, kicking up.
Otherwise, sending the 
right fingertips forward.
Bend your left knee, 
bend your right elbow.
Strong connection 
to your core here,
as you maybe reach back,
grab the top of your left foot.
Here we go.
Inhale, opening as 
you kick the left foot out
towards the back edge of 
your mat and open the chest,
heart energy radiates forward.
Nice, and then slowly release
with control best you can,
right into Downward Dog.
Plant the palms, 
curl the toes under,
lift the hips up 
high and back. Nice work.
Inhale in deeply here.
Exhale, empty it 
out through the mouth.
Nice.
Inhale, right leg lifts.
Three-Legged Dog.
Exhale, shift it forward.
Squeeze the right knee up
into the chest as you do this,
and then step it all the way up.
Beautiful.
Pivot on the 
back foot this time.
Take your time, front knee 
bent over front ankle.
Hands come to the waistline,
ground through the feet.
Tuck the chin,
roll up to Warrior I.
Front knee stays bent.
Yeah, do a little hair toss,
check it out.
Hug the low ribs in.
Back toes are turned in,
so we wanna 
actively turn them in
so that this left shin, 
knee, femur, hip socket,
all can snuggle in.
That's how we eventually 
get the hips moving forward.
Pull the right hip crease back.
Front knee is still 
over that front ankle.
Hands can stay on 
the waistline here
or we'll spread the fingertips,
inhale, rise up.
Warrior I, Virabhadrasana I.
Give yourself a 
lot of space here.
Open up through the shoulders,
so imagine that big beach 
ball up and overhead again.
Great, head over heart, heart
over pelvis here, best we can.
That's what we're working
towards from the inside out,
this sensation kind of 
guiding the way, right?
Awakening is a process.
It's not something 
like, check, I'm awake,
although, well, no.
Okay.
Warrior I for one more breath.
Maybe inhale, you look up.
Use your exhale to 
slowly bring it back down
into a nice, low lunge.
You're gonna slow and 
steady pivot on the back foot.
Bring your fingertips 
down to the earth.
Inhale, open the 
chest to look forward.
Exhale, plant the palms,
step it back.
Go straight to Downward Dog
or take a little flow here,
a little vinyasa.
It can be belly to Cobra,
Chaturanga
to Upward Facing Dog.
We'll meet all together 
now in that Downward Dog.
Find that nice, 
full breath here.
And when you're ready,
inhale, lift the left leg 
up high, Three-Legged Dog.
Exhale, shift it 
forward from center.
Squeeze the left knee up 
and in, and then step it up.
Find your breath.
When you're ready, 
pivot on the back foot.
Keep those right toes turned in.
Build it from the ground up.
Pull the left hip crease back.
Hands come to the waistline.
Tuck the chin, roll up,
keeping that front 
knee over the front ankle.
Strong legs.
Good, hug the low ribs in.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Keep the hands on 
the waistline, here,
or with a big inhale, 
spread the fingertips.
So, active in the fingertips,
reach up high towards the sky,
thumbs back, pinkies forward.
Big beach ball up and overhead.
Press into the outer 
edge of your right foot.
Sink a little deeper 
into that front knee,
front knee over front ankle.
We're working in that way,
working towards that.
Maybe for this last breath,
you draw some 
energy up from the earth.
Lift up from the pelvic floor,
and then maybe take your gaze
all the way up towards the sky.
Breathe in.
And then exhale,
rain it down nice and 
slow and with control,
pivoting on the back foot.
We say it all the 
time here in the community,
but how you move matters.
It's not just what you do,
but how you do it.
So, moving with control,
that's a great practice
to really honor that.
Inhale, open the chest,
look forward.
Big hip stretch, here.
Exhale, last time.
Plant the palms, belly to Cobra,
Chaturanga to Up Dog,
or you can go 
straight to Downward Dog.
Move with your breath.
Find what feels good.
We're gonna meet 
in that Downward Dog.
It's the last one, 
so make it awesome.
When you get there,
take the deepest 
breath you've taken all day.
Inhale.
And exhale.
Great, slowly 
lower to the knees.
Bring them together and 
then send the hips back,
dragging the 
fingertips along your sides
to fold into oneself here 
in Balasana, Child's Pose.
When you land here, close
your eyes and count them out,
three full breaths.
If this shape is 
not good for you,
then make an adjustment,
maybe coming to 
your back or seated.
Three full breaths.
Noticing how they can move you.
Maybe
feeling the 
skin of the back body
stretch as you breathe in.
Noticing the softening of
the torso as you breathe out.
After your three breaths,
slowly reach the arms back out
towards the 
front edge of your mat.
Use this 
hand-to-earth connection
and this awareness of 
your center of gravity
to draw you back up.
This time, we're gonna 
cross one ankle over the,
one ankle over the other, 
sorry, (chuckles)
and then come through mindfully
using your hands to a seat.
Then send your legs out long.
Reach the fingertips forward,
and here we go.
Slow and with control,
nice and easy,
you can point the toes.
Sometimes that's 
a little bit easier.
And just check 
in with your core.
Awaken the core nice and easy.
Be kind if your legs fly up.
Laugh, all good.
Life is good.
Nice and slow.
When your back 
finally kisses the mat,
remember that 
image of your yoga mat
kind of rising up to 
meet your back body.
You can center 
yourself on the mat.
Then we're gonna bring 
just the right knee up,
just the right knee.
Keep the left leg extended,
but start to activate 
through that left foot
as if you were pressing 
into an imaginary wall.
Then rotate the right ankle
one way, and then the other.
Take a deep breath in.
Send that breath 
down into your belly.
And then on an exhale,
you're gonna 
take your right knee
and guide it across your body
towards the left 
side of your mat,
coming into a Supine Twist.
Go ahead and open up 
through the right arm.
You can take it all 
the way out in extension
or maybe bend the 
elbow if that feels right.
And then last but not least,
take a deep breath in
and exhale to turn 
onto your right ear.
Close your eyes and breathe.
So much love for 
the spine here
with every conscious 
breath here in the twist.
There's so much we can do 
for the systems of the body
and the balance,
equilibrium of the inner world.
It's not always 
Chaturangas and core workouts,
although those are comin'!
Some people are like, "Yay,"
some people are like, "No!"
Trust me, trust yourself,
trust the process.
Here we go, coming all 
the way back to center.
Right leg extends, and 
we'll bring the left knee in.
Putting a little 
rotation with the ankle
one way and then the other.
Keep a nice, active breath here.
And inhale, breathe 
deep into your belly
and use your exhale to 
gently guide your left knee
across the body,
over towards the 
right side of the mat
into your Supine Twist here.
Again, left arm can 
extend in full extension,
or maybe you bend the elbow,
eventually coming on to
the left ear.
Now try to soften your jaw,
soften your gaze,
and breathe 
down into your belly.
So wonderful for 
the digestive organs.
Balancing all of 
that stomach chi.
So wonderful for the spine.
Try to keep your 
shoulders relaxed
and listen to the 
sound of your breath here
for one more cycle.
Great.
From center, so from 
a place of connection,
start to bring it 
all the way back in.
We're gonna hug both 
knees up into the chest, now.
And bring your hands, 
your palms, rather,
to your kneecaps,
and you're just gonna 
slowly straighten the arms,
draw your knees towards 
the front edge of your mat.
If you want to, you can kick
your feet a little bit here,
just creating a little
balance in the spine here.
And then slowly allow 
your feet to come to the earth.
Extend one leg 
and then the other.
Hands are gonna come 
gently to rest at your sides,
palms face up.
Close your eyes.

I'm gonna stop there so I
don't lose you on this journey.
Take a second to 
rest your sweet heart.
Awakening is a process.
Tomorrow, we'll talk about,
we'll talk about activating.
But today, may you 
provide yourself the opportunity
to just think about and meditate
on what it means to awaken,
and what might be 
calling or whispering your name
from within to be awakened,
and if nothing else, 
we got a great stretch.
We took care of our 
body today, physical body.
Life is good.
Let's bring the palms together,
thumbs up to the third eye,
that inner teacher.
Point of intuition.
I love you.
Thank you so much 
for sharing your time
and your energy with me
and all of the folks practicing.
Day 3 in the books.
Take a deep breath in.
And we finish with Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
