- Hello everyone.
My name is Adriene 
and this is Benji
and welcome to Yoga PE.
Today we have 
a practice for your mind.
So this is really great to
help bring some calming energy
to your day, or also really
wonderful to help you focus.
We're gonna start in a seated
position of your choice.
So you get to decide, 
come on down to the ground,
find a cross-legged 
position like me,
or maybe you wanna try kneeling.
Benji has found 
his shape as well.
Okay, wonderful.
And once you have found 
your seat, sit up nice and tall.
And imagine there 
is a string attached
to the tip top of your head,
and it's pulling you gently,
gently up towards the sky.
So your legs and your lower
body stay put on the ground,
nice and heavy, but there's
this imaginary string
kind of pulling you up to
sit up a little bit taller.
Then inhale in 
through the nose.
And as you exhale, 
give a little ha sound.
In fact, take one hand, 
bring it in front of your mouth,
deep breath in again,
and do it again 
and see if you can
feel your breath 
on your hand.
This is also a clever way to
smell if you have bad breath.
(sniffing)
You know what I'm talking about.
Alright, so we're 
gonna do that again.
Now put the hand down.
Inhale in deeply
and exhale, nice long, 
calming ocean breath.
Awesome work.
So from there we're gonna
drop the chin to the chest,
look down and then look up.
Warming up through the neck,
look down and look up,
and look down and look up
and look down and look up.
And here we go now, 
head to center.
We're gonna go 
the opposite direction.
We're going to take it 
to the side left to right.
So side and through 
center and side.
So the opposite 
plane here, side to side.
And side to side.
And side to side, great.
Come back to center.
Notice if you've 
kind of collapsed.
See if you can reinforce
that imaginary string,
sit up nice and tall.
And we're gonna do 
that same thing again,
just a little more quickly.
Here we go.
Nodding the head 
down and up, down and up,
down and up,
sitting up tall, down and up.
Now side to side, 
side to side, side to side,
side to side and side to side.
Beautiful.
Bring it back to center.
Send your fingertips all
the way up towards the sky.
We're gonna clap the
palms together on three.
Ready one, two, three.
(claps)
Bring the hands all the way down.
Take a deep breath in.
And ocean breath.
Awesome, from here
we're gonna come forward
onto all fours, Tabletop Position.
So for today we wanna
have strong tables,
right? Not weak tables.
So spread your fingertips wide
so the hands look like starfish
and come into a Tabletop
Position with a strong table,
so the back is nice and strong.
Beautiful.
Then we're gonna challenge
ourselves by curling the toes
under and inhaling in,
exhale, see if you can lift
your knees and let them
hover in Hovering Table.
And if that is not working
for your body today,
do not get angry, it's all
good, it's challenging.
You can work up towards that.
Hovering table 
for three, two, one.
Awesome, let that go.
Press into your hands,
press into the 
tops of your feet.
And we're gonna come into
Cow Pose, so drop your belly
to the ground, 
inhale to look forward.
Exhale, if you know the sound
that a cow makes, prove it.
And now from 
Cow Pose we're gonna go
in the opposite direction
with the spine to Cat Pose.
Now think friendly 
Halloween cat here.
So really arch your back.
And if you know the 
sound that a friendly
Halloween cat makes, prove it.
(hissing)
Or meow.
Now back and forth, 
Cow Pose, take a deep breath in,
drop your belly,
look forward.
Exhale, round the spine.
Draw your chin to your chest,
claw through your fingertips.
One more time, 
Cow Pose, drop the belly.
Look forward.
So good for your spine.
Exhale, round it through,
chin to chest, Cat Pose.
Awesome.
From here, we're gonna
walk the knees together.
We're gonna send the hips
back towards the heels
and we're gonna 
come into Rock Pose.
So you're gonna 
send your fingertips back.
You're gonna melt your
heart and your head down
and we're gonna come
into it a little ball.
This is also called Child's Pose.
So for today, imagine you're
a rock, a pebble, a stone,
maybe in a beautiful
babbling brook or river,
a creek of water.
You can close your eyes
and begin to breathe 
a little deeper here
and see if you can notice
when you breathe in
that your back 
kind of expands, lifts.
So you might even the
skin on your back stretch
as you breathe in.
And then everything 
relaxes and softens
as you breathe out.
Now decide what color rock
or pebble you wanna be today.
Quickly, go into yourself.
And once you have that,
we're gonna come 
all the way back up
to Tabletop Position.
Excellent.
Wag your tail.
Keep wagging your tail,
get loose through the hips,
loose through the hips,
curl your toes under
and send your tail 
up towards the sky.
This one's for you, Benji boy,
Downward Facing Dog.
So you're gonna take your
dog on a little walk here
by peddling it out 
through the legs.
We're stretching through
the feet, the ankles,
the legs, the hips.
We're building strength 
in our upper body
and we're also getting a
healthy flow of energy
running throughout 
the body, so nice,
beautiful pose to 
boost your energy.
Awesome. And if you know
the sound that a dog makes
and you wanna 
perform it now, go for it.
Yes, yes, yes.
Alright, from here 
we're gonna slowly
come onto the knees and
we're gonna cross the ankles.
Awesome, and then we're 
gonna come all the way through,
like magic, 
to cross-legged position.
Excellent.
In cross-legged position
we're gonna stir the pot.
We're gonna bring 
the palms to the knees
and nice and slow we're gonna
smooth the chest forward.
And then back and then forward,
and then back.
Nice, slow movement here.
And we'll reverse it.
Forward, take it in
the opposite direction,
the other direction.
Benji's very calm today.
He is just a 
model of relaxation.
Alright, bring it 
back to center.
We're gonna bring the feet
together now for butterfly.
So you're gonna take your hands,
we're gonna come into
like peace fingers here.
And then you're gonna take
these fingers that are up
and you're gonna 
bring them in between
your big toe 
and your middle toe.
Crazy, right?
Then sit up nice and tall, 
lift your heart.
Inhale in and exhale,
we're gonna come forward.
Bend the elbows, 
come all the way forward
almost as if you were kind
of coming into a chrysalis.
So a rounding in.
So we go from caterpillar
to chrysalis to, here we go,
nice and slow, 
blossoming into the butterfly.
You can decide what color of
butterfly you wanna be today.
Maybe whisper it now.
(whispering) Blue and purple.
Awesome work.
Alright, so from here,
we're gonna release the hands.
We're gonna come back to
a cross-legged position
and we're gonna finish
with a little bee breath.
What is bee breath?
Well, just like a bumblebee.
So you're gonna inhale in
and yep, you guessed it,
on the exhale 
we're gonna go (buzzing).
So we're finishing with
this calming breath
and you wanna see how long
you can get your buzz, right?
Let's see what happens.
You gotta take a deep breath in,
notice what it feels like
when you take a deep breath.
And (buzzing).
Good, relax your shoulders,
if you giggle 
a little it's okay.
But then come back to
your inhale and again,
notice what it feels like.
How do you feel when
you take deep breaths?
Here we go.
Inhale in deeply.
And, (buzzing).
Okay, so I could've 
gone on much longer,
I've been practicing breath
technique for a while.
So don't worry if you didn't,
if you didn't go super long.
Benji, you were awake
for this last breath.
Alright, let's do 
one more all together.
See if you can take the deepest
breath you've taken all day
so that you have lots
of breath stored away
for that nice, slow buzz.
That nice, slow exhale.
Are you ready?
Sit up nice and tall.
Here we go.
Big breath in.
(inhaling)
And (buzzing).
Empty it out.
Alright guys, 
awesome work.
So you can practice 
bee breath any time
and you can work on it
and then bring your skills
and your focus and 
your calm back to class.
Warning, if you have 
pets in the room,
they may not like bee breath.
Alright, love you guys.
See you next time.
Take good care.
(upbeat music)
