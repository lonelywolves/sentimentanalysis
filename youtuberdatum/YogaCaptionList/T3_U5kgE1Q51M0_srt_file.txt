- Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and
this is darling Benji
and we are so glad you
are here for this full class.
This is yoga for renewal.
So hop into something
comfy and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Alrighty, my darling friend,
come on down to the ground.
We're gonna begin
today's practice in a seat,
so you can come to
maybe cross legs here,
or if it's in your practice
maybe you've already
been moving a bit today
or it feels right in your body
to maybe start in
a kneeling position,
that's an option today as well.
If both are rather difficult,
know that you're not alone.
It might be a good option then
for you to sit up on a
big towel or a blanket,
maybe a block or a big book
if you have something
just to lift the hips.
Try not to think too hard,
I just spit, too hard.
Just make a
choice and let's begin.
Sit up nice and tall.
Relax your shoulders.
You made it. 
The hardest part is truly done.
Making that choice to begin,
finding your seat,
and here we are.
Go ahead and close the eyes.
If you're not quite comfortable
with closing your eyes yet,
just soften your gaze.
Look down past your nose.
Again, relax your shoulders.
Allow the hands to rest gently
on the knees or the thighs.
Let the elbows get heavy.
With a soft gaze
or your eyes closed,
bring your attention 
or your mind's eye,
your focus,
bring your attention,
your imagination even,
to the very bottom of the spine.
And just let your attention,
your focus,
again, even your imagination,
let it ruminate
down there. (chuckles)
It's off to a great start
for a bit, but hang with me.
Just kind of bring your attention
to the base of the spine.
The pelvis.
And the hips.
And as you bring your attention
to this area of the body,
just notice what comes up,
any fidgeting, any distractions.
Perhaps you've landed
in a really quiet space
and boom, it's serene, but 
chances are that's not the case.
And so don't feel 
like you have to be
in a perfect setting 
for this practice to really
work its magic.
The most important thing
is that you've taken the time
to bring your attention inward.
So we'll attempt to
become more still here.
But if it's not happening
right away for whatever reason,
it's all good.
This session, as with
all of my yoga practices,
really is an invitation
to practice being present.
Present with what is.
Slowly, gently begin
to deepen your breath.
Again, we're still just,
whatever this means to you,
just bringing your attention,
your awareness,
just allowing some
imagination, some energy
to swirl around the hips,
the bowl of the pelvis,
the base of the spine.
If you're familiar
with the root chakra,
then that's where
we are right now.
Finding our home, our base.
Setting the bar at a nice
place that feels centered,
that feels true.
Maybe it's time for you
to hit the reset button,
come back to basics.
Checking in with your foundation
so you can grow this season.
And start to, 
yep, you guessed it,
take this awareness, this focus,
on the base of the spine
and let it travel up 
the spinal column
slowly and steadily.
And if this little action,
this invitation to draw
focus up through the spine
from the bottom to the
top changes your posture
or the way you're carrying
yourself in this moment, let it.
Allow it.
It can be subtle,
it could be big.
You could've noticed you were
really crumpling in the spine.
Maybe you start to
breathe a little deeper here,
with more awareness,
putting some conscious energy,
some intention
behind your breath.
If you haven't already,
travel all the way up
to the crown of the head.
Find a gentle lift in the chest.
Drop the shoulders
down a little more,
a little heavier in the elbows.
Get long, long,
long in the spine.
Make sure you're not
holding or gripping in the toes,
the fingers, the jaw.
Soften the skin of the forehead.
Relax the brows.
And when you're ready,
so, so slow,
so sweetly bring
the palms together
at the chest, at the heart.
Now, if you haven't already,
or maybe you've opened the
eyes to just check in with me,
which is great, always do that.
That's why I'm here.
Go ahead and close the eyes now
just to really feel the
palms pressing together here.
You can even lift
your chest, your sternum,
up to your thumbs and
feel that connection as well.
Imagine your body's
really heavy from the waist down
and really light
from the waist up.
Now let's take a
deep breath in together.
Ready, inhaling
in through the nose.
And as you exhale slowly,
bow your head down to your heart
and just feel that
nice passive stretch,
or maybe it's a big stretch
for you in the back of the neck
all the way up into
the back of the head.
Connecting to the
muscles of the upper back.
Keep breathing here.
Take a quiet moment
to set an intention
for this renewal practice.
And if you found
something right away, trust it.
Maybe breathe
with it for a second.
If you're struggling here,
maybe finish the sentence,
"I choose..."
I choose...
And a big inhale in together.
Here we go, in through the nose.
And an exhale
out slowly together.
As we lift the head,
release the hands,
bat the eyelashes open.
Oh, hello there.
We're gonna take a nice,
easy twist to the right.
So if you're on your knees,
you can stay there.
Lift up from the pelvic
floor for support, everyone.
Let's take the right hand.
Excuse me, left hand 
to the right knee.
Right fingertips behind you.
Get nice and tall
through the side waist.
All four sides of the torso
nice and evenly lengthened here.
Benji's chillin'.
Tuck the chin slightly
to lengthen through
the back of the neck.
Inhale in deeply.
And exhale to slowly
bring it back through center.
Then we're gonna take
it to the other side.
Inhale, lifting up
from the pelvic floor.
We're not pushing,
we're not cranking here.
Nice and integrated 
from the start.
Tuck the chin slightly.
Get nice and long through
all four sides of the torso.
And let's release 
back to center.
Inhale, spread the
fingertips super wide.
Exhale, fist, squeeze,
squeeze, squeeze.
Inhale, spread the
fingertips super wide, stretch.
Exhale, squeeze,
squeeze, squeeze.
Navel draws slightly in.
Last one, inhale, stretch,
stretch, stretch.
Maybe this time you open
your mouth, open the jaw,
face nice and big.
And exhale, fists,
navel draws in.
Maybe scrunching the face,
pursing the lips.
Good. Inhale,
spread the fingertips.
We're gonna reach the arms
all the way up towards the sky.
Exhale, palms down at the heart.
Syncing up with your
breath. Really do it.
Inhale, spread the fingertips.
This time, softness here.
And exhale, 
hands together at the heart.
Last one, inhale,
get really long.
So really
stretching from the waist
all the way up to the wrist,
all the way to the
fingertips and beyond.
And then exhale,
hands to heart center.
Inhale in together.
Exhale out slowly together.
Beautiful. Inhale takes 
you gently to all fours,
Cat-Cow.
Make sure your wrists are
right underneath the shoulders,
knees directly
underneath the hip points.
So we're not too narrow
here and we're not too wide,
but we're creating
a nice foundation,
awareness of foundation.
Benji, you're doing great.
Inhale to the drop the belly.
Press into the tops of the feet.
As you do so, open
the chest, look forward.
Cow, grip through 
the fingertips.
Exhale, round through the spine.
Navel draws up,
chin to chest, Cat Pose.
Press into the tops of the feet.
Inhale, drop the
belly nice and slow.
Bye, Benji.
Exhale, rounding through.
Careful not to rush this.
Let's move unhurried.
Inhale, drop the belly.
Maybe draw a little
energy back with the palms here.
Press into the tops of the feet.
Open up through
the neck, the throat.
And exhale, chin to chest,
round through.
Press into the toes,
press into the fingers.
Good, one more with the sound
of your breath, nice and slow.
After you've gone both ways,
we'll come back to
a nice neutral spine.
Check it out.
You're gonna walk the
right knee over to the left,
then we're gonna
use our hands here
to slowly come on to our side,
so on the right hip here.
Right hand comes to the earth,
right elbow just
underneath the right shoulder.
There we go, excellent.
So for starters here, we're
gonna keep the knees together,
feet together,
ankles together here.
I don't want to collapse
into my right shoulder here.
I wanna keep
this nice and lifted.
So we're creating
a little stability
in the shoulder joint here.
I'm kind of already
engaged in my right oblique.
I'm just gonna
nice and easy open,
keep the right
leg heavy, and close.
Open and close.
Now, breathe.
Inhale open. And close.
Nice and easy in the neck.
Open and close.
Now, keep it going
with your breath here
and see if you can 
draw a little energy
to your core
by hugging the low ribs in.
So instead of splaying out here,
I'm really kind of finding
that containment here in the abs
to support this movement.
Left fingertips can
come onto the ground here
for a little more stability.
Alright, you're doing great.
Nice and slow,
let's do three more here.
Wherever you are, count 'em out.
Nice and slow.
After three, you're gonna relax
the right arm onto the ground.
You have two options here.
You can extend the right arm
and rest your head on
your right bicep here
or you can use your right hand
to cradle the right side
of the head, the right ear.
That's what I'm gonna do here.
Then, check it out, now we're
gonna open it up a little more.
So the left hand's gonna come
to the outer edge
of the left leg here.
I'm gonna open
it all the way up.
Peek at if you need to.
So, active feet.
My knees are bent kind of
in this right angle here.
And then all the way down.
And that's it, all the
way up and all the way down.
Now, you're gonna wanna
find your core again here,
but here's the kicker.
We're gonna do some really
nice work for the hips here
by creating a little
resistance with the top hand.
So you're gonna
open up and close.
Open up, pressing just a little
bit down with the left hand
and closing with control.
Give it a try.
Engage that low
belly for stability.
You don't wanna rush this,
so there's an undercurrent,
a theme here,
of kind of 
moving unhurried, right?
This is a season we're all
wanting to get back to it.
You know, we're
wanting to get back
to whatever normal life is.
You know, we're
trying to reach our goals.
We're trying to get it all done.
We want everything all at once.
Can we move slowly, mindfully,
paying attention to
what's going on on the inside?
Super great for the
glute here, too. (chuckles)
Alright, wherever you are,
let's count them out.
Do three more.
Don't forget to give yourself
that resistance
with the top hand.
And then release.
Awesome, we're
gonna press back up.
We're gonna come back
to Tabletop Position.
Beautiful. Inhale, drop
the belly, open the chest.
Exhale, round through
the spine, chin to chest.
From here, you're
gonna walk your left knee
over to your right knee
and come on to your left side.
Great, left elbow right
underneath that left shoulder,
so we're
stacking the bones here.
Keep the feet together,
right fingertips on
the earth for stability
and we're gonna open
nice and slow and close.
Open nice and slow and close.
So I'm engaging the muscles
of my core here for stability.
And you can
start to kind of feel
how everything's 
connected, right?
Those chains are
all working as one.
That's why I like to say,
think of your body as
one moving part a lot.
While, of course,
there are benefits
to isolating muscle groups,
we have to kind
of always remember
that things are
working in tandem
in a nice, beautiful chain.
And it's okay if
you actually don't know
or understand those chains,
your body knows.
So if you're just
listening in your yoga practice,
you'll be able to feel it out.
Like right now, 
I'm really feeling
low abdominals, oblique.
Nice and slow.
Another benefit to not
moving too fast, rushing, right?
You get to notice
what's really going on.
Stop and smell
the roses, they say.
Okay, three more. Count 'em out.
Yes, and then slide it down.
You get to decide, either arm
extended or cradling the head.
Bend those knees.
Right hand's gonna come to
the outer edge of the right leg
and we're gonna go,
we know what we're
doing now on this side,
so we're gonna go right into it.
We're gonna open and close.
Give yourself a little
resistance here on the way down,
lots of control on the way up.
So great for the hips.
For muscle, for tissue,
connecting at all.
If you haven't worked
these muscles in a while,
your glutes might be on fire,
but we're getting
a nice strong base
for our renewal practice.
Just notice if you have
kind of sped things up here,
see if you can slow it down.
Notice if you are
still breathing deeply,
putting some conscious
energy behind the breath here.
I mean, if anything,
that is what this time
is really great for, right?
Not to mention all
the physical benefits
you're gonna get
out of this practice,
but just putting your phone away
and being with your breath,
slowing it down.
Alright, count it out.
We're gonna do three more.
And after that
third one, press back up.
This time, we're
gonna come all the way
to a Downward Facing Dog.
Take your time.
Upper arm bones
rotate out externally.
Keep the pressure
on the index finger
and thumb as you do that.
So you have like a
bit of opposition there,
which is what this practice,
the hatha yoga practice,
is all about, working
with balancing
opposition,
opposing forces.
We don't know anything
about that in our society, do we?
So keep that in mind,
when practicing the asana,
you have all this great
opportunity to play with that.
Great, then find stillness.
Hug the low ribs in
so that you're not just
spilling all of your energy,
your powerful
energy of the belly out,
but you're drawing it in and up
to feel this lengthening
in the low back as well.
Don't worry about
what the shape looks like.
Build it from the sensation, 
from the inside out.
I'm giving you cues to play
with so you can really breathe
and listen to your body,
to the sensation.
Turn the toes in just a bit
so that your shins, 
knees, thigh bones,
up into that hip socket,
the femur to the hip socket,
that we were just working a
little bit, get really snugly.
We're here for three,
breathe deep,
two, and one.
Slow descend with care of
the knees all the way down.
Walk the knees together,
really together, feet together.
Send the hips back, Balasana.
You're gonna paint the yoga mat,
drag the hands all the
way back towards your toes.
Relax the shoulders
and breathe deep here.
If this Balasana
shape's not right for you,
you can do an
Extended Child's Pose.
Give yourself a little
more space with the knees wide,
or you can come to a nice,
comfortable seat.
We're gonna do
three deep breaths here.
Listen to the
sound of your breath.
As you sip air
in through the nose
and out through the nose.
Alright, from your
version of Child's Pose
or from your seat,
we're gonna come back
to Tabletop Position.
And this time, when we inhale,
we're gonna kick
the right foot out,
look forward and exhale,
round the spine,
draw the right knee in.
Inhale, kick it out,
look forward.
Exhale, round the spine,
draw it in.
Inhale, kick it out,
look forward.
Exhale, navel draws up.
Inhale, kick it out,
look forward, hang with me.
Exhale, bring it in. Beautiful.
This time, 
kick the right leg out.
You're gonna bring the
right toes to the ground,
then we're gonna bring
the right foot to the ground
and we're gonna
bring the left toes
over towards the
left side of the mat.
Peek at me if you need to.
We're coming into a
little Gate variation.
Alright, when you're there,
send the right fingertips
all the way back
towards the right foot,
and then all the
way up towards the sky
and up and overhead.
Little Gate variation here.
Breathing deep, press away 
from your yoga mat here
so you're not collapsing
into your left shoulder.
Now stay here,
pressing into the outer edge
of your right
foot for stability,
engaging your right inner thigh,
pressing into the
left foot for stability,
just like we did in Tabletop.
And then instead of letting
your belly spill, spill, spill,
like hug it in,
keep some for you.
Know who you are as you
connect navel to spine.
Feel that kind of
engagement in the core.
So again, 
stay here or inhale in,
exhale use that
engagement in the core
to maybe lift the right leg up.
Good, then place it down.
Inhale in, 
pull the right thumb back.
Exhale, maybe lift 
the right foot up.
And place it down.
And one more time with
the sound of your breath,
inhale in, exhale, lift.
Good, inhale,
release the right foot down,
right fingertips are gonna come
all the way down to the ground
and we'll bring it all back
to the center,
Tabletop Position.
Second side, inhale,
drop the belly.
Look forward,
kick the left leg out.
Exhale, nose to knee.
Inhale, open the chest,
kick the left foot out.
Nice and slow, exhale,
knee to nose.
Inhale, slow 
and steady, opening.
Exhale, chin to chest.
Inhale, open.
And exhale, navel draws up.
Good. Inhale, open.
This time, drop the
left toes to the ground.
Drop the left
foot to the ground.
Bring the right toes
all the way over towards
the right side of your mat.
Nice and steady.
I'm gonna center
myself on my mat.
When you're ready,
send the left fingertips
all the way towards
the back edge of your mat
and then all the
way up and overhead.
Press away from the
earth with your right hand
so you're not collapsed.
There's equidistant
between your ear lobes
and your shoulders, both sides,
so we're not collapsing here.
Find that containment, 
your power, here in your center.
Feel the glutes
turned on here, hey-oh.
Left thigh engaged,
left foot on the ground.
Breath flowing, 
being patient with yourself,
softening through your brow.
Alrighty, stay here 
or inhale in.
Exhale, lift the left leg.
Inhale, lower.
Exhale, lift.
Inhale, lower, last one.
Exhale, lift.
Good, inhale to lower.
Nice and easy, bringing
the left hand to the ground,
coming all the way back.
Take a second here to
turn the left fingertips
in towards the body,
right fingertips
in towards the body.
And then release, 
fingertips out,
Downward Facing Dog.
Take your time, nice and slow.
Alright, anchor the
right heel down here.
As you inhale, lift the left
leg up high, Three-Legged Dog.
Try to keep the hips even.
It's not so much they
have to be super duper even,
you just wanna make
sure that we're working
the left and the right
side of the body mindfully.
Okay, so you don't
really need a mirror.
Play with your inner mirror
is what I'm
trying to say, really.
Dial the left toes down.
Keep the right
heel anchored here.
Beautiful, inhale in.
We'll maybe lift the
left leg a little higher,
maintain the integrity,
and then exhale, knee to nose.
Inhale, lift it up.
Exhale, knee to nose.
Inhale, lift it up.
Exhale, shifting forward.
Beautiful. 
Step it all the way up.
Left foot comes up,
right foot down to the ground.
Great, get light on
the fingertips here.
We're gonna inhale,
look forward.
Exhale, you're
gonna send the hips back.
Really draw energy
back with your left foot,
but keep a nice
bend in your left knee.
So you're really starting to
open up through left hamstring.
Good, then inhale, 
come forward.
And exhale, send it back.
Again, really tugging
back with that left heel.
Inhale, come forward.
And exhale, back.
Now you're gonna
keep moving here.
You don't need to
come to like the max,
maximum gold star, whatever.
Like, listen to what
your body's telling you here
as you move with
this repetition.
Inhale to come forward.
Find that connection.
Exhale to come back.
How can my low belly and abs
play a role in
me feeling balance
between the left and
the right side here?
Inhale to come forward,
and exhale to come back.
Good, next time you're forward,
we're gonna take the
right hand to the earth
and left fingertips
all the way up to the sky
for a big twist.
Now hug your left knee in.
And if you want,
option here to lift the
back knee all the way up.
Breathe deep here.
Tug the shoulders
away from the ears.
Breathe into your belly.
Breathing, breathing,
breathing, stay.
Be patient.
Good. Inhale in,
wiggle the left fingertips.
Exhale, rain it down,
all the way down.
Plant the palms, step the
left toes back, Plank Pose.
Reach the heels back,
crown forward.
Engage those glutes
that you've been turning on.
Engage the core that
is there to support you
to guide you back to center.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale to lower all
the way to the belly.
Inhale to press into
the tops of the feet.
Squeeze the elbows in,
lift up, Cobra.
And exhale to soften
and release back down.
Pressing all the way up
through to Plank or all fours,
and then make your way to
Downward Facing Dog again.
Hips up high, 
claw through the fingertips
to take pressure
out of the wrist.
So breathing with intention,
let's take a nice cleansing,
nice, beautiful
breath of renewal
in through the nose deeply,
here we go.
And exhale out 
through the nose
or the mouth with intention.
Let's do one
more just like that.
Inhale in deeply.
And exhale, let it go.
Inhale, lift the 
right leg up high.
Three-Legged Dog here.
So we're wanting to
press into both palms evenly.
Again, this is tough stuff.
We're hanging out
here for just a second,
balancing the left and
the right side of the body.
Listening and responding,
you got it.
It's hard, engage
the core muscles,
anchor the left heel down.
Turn the right toes down.
Alright, now let's flow.
Inhale in, lift the
right leg a little higher.
Exhale, shift it forward,
knee to nose.
Inhale, lift it up
a little bit higher.
Exhale, knee to nose.
Last one, you got it.
Inhale, lift it up with control.
Welcome that heat.
Exhale, step it all the way up,
lower the back knee down.
Get light on the fingertips.
If you need to do
some wrist circles,
I'm right there with you.
Inhale to look forward.
Feel that big stretch
through the front of
the left hip, the psoas.
And then exhale, send it back,
actively draw
this right heel back.
Feel that connection
all the way into the hip.
Feel that connectivity in
that big belly of the hamstring
with the right knee bent.
Inhale, come forward.
And exhale, send it back.
And now you can move
as you like with your breath.
Getting everything moving again,
shining a little
light in the dark places.
And so we're not just working
on our flexibility, right?
Were also working to
get the organs of the body,
everything kind of moving,
functioning properly,
saying yes to one another,
just in case anything
has kind of gone
offline for whatever reason.
Alright, and the next time
you're forward, stay forward.
We're gonna bring the
left hand to the earth.
Big inhale,
right fingertips all the
way up to the sky, big twist.
Press away from
your yoga mat here,
lots of length in the neck.
I'm squeezing the right knee in.
Option to lift the back knee,
really reaching the
left heel back, back, back.
Opening up the chest,
maybe gaze up
towards the right thumb.
Breathing deep here.
Breathe into your belly,
at least one big full belly
breath like you love yourself.
Good, then inhale
in again to look up.
Wiggle the right fingertips
and use your
exhale to rain it down,
wiggling the right
fingertips all the way.
Good, plant the palms,
step the right toes back.
Strong Plank Pose here.
You feel free to lower
the knees if you like,
Half Plank, here we go.
We're breathing here for three.
Slow, two, and one,
all the way down, 
nice and slow.
Belly comes to the earth,
press into the tops of the feet.
Again, Cobra, inhale.
And exhale to release.
Alright, from here, we're
gonna press up to all fours.
So we're gonna do
a little combination
and then we'll
flip onto our backs
and call it a day.
Relax so that we
can begin again.
Step into whatever is new.
Alright, so to start,
we're gonna come to Tabletop.
We're gonna bring the
left foot all the way out,
just like we did Gate Pose,
but we're gonna do
it to the side here.
Turning the left toes in,
engaging the left inner thigh.
Now curl the right toes
here for a little stability.
You're gonna inhale, drop
the belly like you did in Cow.
Yes, feel that, just
hang there for a bit.
And then exhale, you're
gonna send the hips back.
You can adjust the
hands if you like,
as if you're in
Extended Child's Pose.
Relax the head.
Now, let's combine the two.
Inhale, shift forward,
drop the belly,
keep the left foot where it is.
Feel the connectivity
from the arch of the foot
all the way up
through the inseam.
And then exhale, send it back.
Alright, working the
fascia of the feet even here,
I'll start to move 
at my own pace
and invite you to do the same.
Unhurried, though, okay? 
Unrushed.
Alright, and the next time
you inhale to shift forward,
we're gonna
release nice and slow,
bring the left knee back,
shift our way back to center 
evenly, Tabletop Position,
and then take it
onto the other side.
We'll step the right foot out,
turn the right toes
in just like Gate Pose.
Maybe walk the hands out a bit.
Here we go, nice and slow.
Really mindful with intention,
press into the top of
the left foot firmly.
As you inhale, open the chest,
just like we do in Cow Pose.
Mhmmm, mhmmm, mhmmm.
And then exhale,
curl the left toes
and send it back, breathing out.
Inhale, drag the hands back
to open the chest, come forward.
And exhale back.
Inhale to come forward
and exhale to come back.
Try to keep the connection
of the outer edge
of your right foot
pretty strong with the earth.
Even if you can't,
if you lose it,
keep that intention going there.
Move nice and slow.
Again, see if you
can find connectivity.
Part of the renewal process
is really taking the time
and yes, and take some actions,
some mindful effort,
to really pay
attention to what's firing,
what's not firing,
what needs to be connected,
what needs to
have a conversation,
what needs to be understood.
What do I need to listen to
to get kind of where I
envision myself being?
Alright, and then
next time you're up,
go ahead and release.
Come back to Tabletop Position.
Swing the legs to
one side, any side,
and let's come on to our backs.
Right away, hug the
knees into the chest.
Gently feel the
support of the earth,
your yoga mat literally having
your back here in this time.
Way to show up.
When you're ready, bring the
left foot down to the earth.
Kick the right foot
up towards the sky.
Spread your right toes
and then cross your
right ankle over the left.
We're gonna
thread the needle here.
Try to get the low back
really flush with the mat.
If you can interlace 
the fingertips
behind the left thigh,
let's do that.
If not, you can use a strap
or you can even just
hold onto your pant here.
Or another option is to
use more core engagement
and keep the palms on the ground
and you can rock a
little side to side here.
So we have lots of options.
Make it work, designers,
find what feels good.
Keep some energy in the toes.
I can hear my floor creaking.
Oh no, now it's gone, of course.
Alright, find one more breath
here to get a little playful
whether that's maybe finding
a little kickstand on the
elbows as you go side to side
or kicking the left leg up high,
find your button
and then release.
Then we'll switch, right
hand comes to the ground.
Inhale, left leg up.
Spread the left toes here.
So we're already engaged,
finding that connection,
the chain,
and then we'll cross the
left ankle over the right.
Lift it up, thread the needle,
or find your version
of this beautiful posture,
this therapeutic 
movement, really.
There's that creaky, old floor.
Mhmmm and keep breathing here.
Our practice is
coming to an end soon,
so really
activate the breath here.
If you need to leave 
some stuff on the mat,
please do,
so that you can step up off
the mat feeling renewed,
open, open to the gifts
that are already 
coming your way.
Take one last
cycle of breath here.
Let it be playful.
Again, maybe
kickstands on the elbows
or sending the
right leg up high,
maybe even moving the
tongue around in the mouth.
And then we will release,
Bring the feet
to the outer edges,
so the wide edges of the mat.
Bring the knees in.
So now hip sockets feel snugly,
they're finding
that internal rotation.
Bring your right
hand to your belly,
your left hand to
your heart space.
Take the deepest
breath you've taken all day.
Inhale lots of love in.
And exhale lots of love out.
Close your eyes.
Begin to relax your body here.
Your knees are touching,
they're kissing together,
so you shouldn't have
to be actively holding
any part of your body up here.
And again, inhale lots of
love in, with the eyes closed.
And exhale lots of love out.
If you're ever in
need of a quick fix,
a little bit of renewal,
like when you've
kind of lost faith
and you're just
starting to feel anxious
or just so
overwhelmed with what's next
and kind of that unknowing,
a great way to come
back to your knowing
is by, for me, is by
just taking a second,
getting still like we are here,
and saying quietly to myself,
"Inhale lots of love in," 
following suit,
and exhaling lots of love out.
And it's funny, as I do this,
I hear sirens in the background
here in my neighborhood
and it's kind of, while I
always say a little blessing
when I hear sirens, it's
kind of a good metaphor.
It's like, whenever
the sirens are going off,
just remember
inhale lots of love in.
Exhale lots of love out.
Slowing down the breath,
do one cycle, do two cycles.
If you have time, do three,
but at least do the one
and find your way to
renewal,
that renewed sense of self.
Maybe a renewal in
your love for yourself 
or for someone.
A renewal in faith.
Whatever it is, it's on the way.
Just stay present. 
Be kind to yourself. Keep going.
We'll walk the feet in together
and you have an option here
to extend the
legs out for Shavasana
and you can chill here for
a bit after this video ends,
or if you're going to step up
off the mat here in a second,
you can turn on to one side
and press up to a
nice comfortable seat.
So you're either laying out
or you're coming
up to the same seat
that maybe we started in.
If you're on the
ground on your back
or in a seated position,
I'll invite you to bring
the palms together here.
We'll just take one
final breath together
to close the practice,
inhaling lots of loving in.
Closing the eyes, maybe
finding a reverent bow here,
as you breathe lots of love out.
Thank you so much
for sharing your time
and your energy with me and
all of the beautiful people
who are showing
up for themselves
via through this practice
and through the breath.
Take good care.
If you like, you
can whisper thank you,
I love you, or Namaste.
(upbeat music)
