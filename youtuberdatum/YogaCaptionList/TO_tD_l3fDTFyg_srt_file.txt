- Howdy, everyone. 
Welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I am Adriene and this is 
a very blissed out Benji.
And today we have a 
yoga to heal stress.
So I need it, 
you need it, he needs it,
and together 
we're going to get it.
So bring a pillow to 
class today if you have one.
If you don't have one,
don't worry.
If you want to be extra 
though and bring two pillows,
bring one for your neighbor,
just kidding.
It doesn't really work on a
digital platform, does it?
Or does it?
Hop into something 
comfy and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Alrighty, my darling friend,
let's begin
today's practice in 
Extended Child's Pose.
So if Extended Child's 
Pose is not awesome for you,
you can just 
start today's practice
in a nice comfortable 
seat of your choice.
Benji has selected this shape.
You can select your shape to
really just get comfortable
and find your 
breath and tune in,
because today's practice 
is of course an invitation
to really look at the ways in
which we might be stressed.
And understand and remember
that we always have an 
opportunity to tend to that,
to circle back 
to that awareness,
and eventually to heal from that
so that we 
don't get really sick.
Okay, let's not worry 
about all that for now.
Let's start with just 
tuning into the breath
in an effort to bring more
loving awareness to our life.
Shall we?
In your comfortable seat,
in your Benji pose
or if you want to join 
me in Extended Child's Pose,
take a second to get settled in.
And once you're there, right
away bring your awareness
or your 
attention to your breath.
And really, don't 
skimp out on yourself here.
Right away listen.
What's it like today?
Is the breath shallow?
Is it hard?
Remarkably sometimes 
it's hard to breath.
And let this 
invitation to focus inward
on your breath, 
let it do its thing.
Invite more 
presence into the body
by allowing one moment to 
simply bleed into the next.
So you start by noticing 
the quality of your breath.
But then that might 
inspire you to reach the arms
a little wider, to notice 
if you feel a bit tired,
to notice if you actually
wanted a fiery practice today
but you find yourself here,
maybe you can trust
that you might need this too.
Now gently begin 
to deepen the breath.
Notice the thoughts 
that come up here.
And you know what to do, 
but I'll just remind you.
As those thoughts come up,
because they will.
It's just a matter of if 
it's five times or 500 times
in our practice here today.
As the thoughts come up,
acknowledge them, notice them,
and then return 
back to your breath.
And that's the 
dance that we'll practice.
That's the dance that we aim
to get good at.
Continue to gently 
deepen your breath.
Notice how you feel.
Is there love 
in your heart today
or are you tender hearted?
And yes, of course, 
you can be both.
And if you're like, "I just want
to chill my nervous system,"
"Get a nice little stretch in,"
that's great too.
Wherever you are, 
take one more cycle
of breath to really land.
Then slowly we'll carve a line
with the nose to look forward.
And ever so slowly press in 
to the tops of the feet
and from your heart,
lift forward.
Walk the knees 
underneath the chest.
I said chest.
Walk the knees 
underneath the hips.
Sorry, I got distracted because
what I wanted to tell you
was after you walked the 
knees underneath your hips,
carve a line with your 
nose to look to the screen.
And look at 
Benji's paw on my hand.
Alright, now bring 
your gaze straight down.
Spread the fingertips evenly.
Walk your wrists 
underneath your shoulders.
Let's move with the breath,
so synchronize the breath
with the movement and the
movement with the breath here
as you inhale, drop the belly,
open the chest, look forward.
Broaden through 
the back of the neck,
so careful not to crunch.
Then exhale, round through 
the spine, chin to chest.
Really create a contraction
in the center of your being
as you broaden 
through the upper back body.
Let the neck kind of hang 
here and the head be heavy.
And then here we go.
On an inhale, drop the belly,
open the chest.
Let your heart open forward,
forward, forward.
And then exhale, tailbone 
goes down, chin to chest.
Breathe out.
Inhale, drop the belly.
Exhale, round.
Inhale, claw through the 
fingertips, open the chest.
Exhale, claw through the 
fingertips, navel draws up.
Inhale, last time,
drop the belly.
Exhale, chin to chest.
And now just take it 
off the railroad tracks
a little bit here, bumping the
hips a little left to right,
finding a soft or 
generous bend in your elbow.
Checking in with your hips,
your shoulders,
just kind of going freestyle 
a little bit here today.
And see if you 
can soften your gaze
and start to move with 
the sound of your breath.
You can curl the toes under
here, checking with the feet,
checking with the neck.
Get a little freaky here.
Find what feels good.
And then bring it 
back to Tabletop Position,
nice, neutral spine.
And we're going to 
slowly press the left foot
into the ground, 
curl the right toes under
and send the right toes out.
Right heel, really reaches,
extends back.
And you're going to work to
press into your right pinky toe
so that your 
right ball and socket
can really get snugly here.
Right thigh bone, femur,
down towards the ground.
Then rock front and rock back,
rock front and rock back.
And the next time you rock front
you're going to drop your elbows
exactly where your hands were.
Then interlace the 
fingertips out in front.
So now I'm on my forearms.
Good, you're going 
to lift the right toes now,
bend the right knee, press
into your left foot firmly.
Careful not to collapse 
into the shoulders here.
And then baby pulses here
with the right foot up towards
the sky, breathing deep.
Baby pulses.
Gaze is straight down, 
lifting the right knee.
Waking up the body so we're
building a little bit of heat
but nice and low to the 
ground mindfully here today.
Take a deep breath in.
Long breath out.
One more time.
Big breath in. Long breath out.
Release, knee comes 
underneath the hip.
We'll press back up 
to Tabletop Position.
Press into your right foot,
curl your left toes under,
and send your left leg out.
Rock front, rock back.
See if you can bring your 
lower belly in just a bit,
hug your low ribs in.
So finding that center.
Stretching through 
the fascia of the foot,
the Achilles, the calf.
Upper arm bones rotate out.
So creating space between
the ears and the shoulders,
working to create a 
whole body awareness.
Then the next 
time you rock front,
connect to your center.
Draw the low belly in,
drop your elbows 
where the hands were.
Interlace the fingertips,
this time opposite thumb on top,
the one that 
feels kind of funky.
Then you're going to press up
and out of your foundation here.
I'm pressing into 
both elbows evenly.
So there may be a tendency
to rock onto your right side.
See if you can hug the midline.
We'll lift the left toes,
bend the left knee,
and find baby pulses.
Yes, this is 
good for your booty.
Yes, this is good for your core.
But we're trying to create a
full body experience, right?
A 100% full body experience.
So tuck your chin, we're fine.
Press into both knees evenly.
Find your breath.
If you get thrown off balance,
return to the breath.
Welcoming that heat.
Breathe in, breathe out.
Breathe in, breathe out.
Good, release.
Hop back up to the hands.
Bump the hips to your left.
Turn to look past 
your right shoulder, yes.
Come back to center.
Bump the hips to the right,
turn and look past 
your left shoulder.
Sweet, come back to center.
Place the hands mindfully.
Spread the fingertips evenly.
Index fingers pointing towards
the front edge of the mat.
Claw through your knuckles.
Here we go, curl the toes under.
Deep breath in.
With your exhale, peel the
tailbone up towards the sky.
Downward Facing Dog.
Find what feels good here.
Breathe deep.
Close your eyes.
Let any stress, 
tension melt down the back
as you continue to 
firmly press through your hands,
working from the ground up here.
Inhale in.
On your next 
exhale find stillness.
And then slowly 
release to the ground.
Awesome, walk your 
knees up just a bit.
Cross one ankle over the other.
We're going to 
come through all the way
to a nice flat back position.
So come onto your back.
We'll join Benji here.
Excellent.
Then when you're ready 
we're going to plant the palms
and slowly lift the 
right leg up high to the sky.
Good.
Bend your right knee, 
squeeze it up towards the chest.
Breathe.
Then take your right hand.
You're going to grab 
either your right shin,
calf, right ankle,
or right big toe.
If you want to use 
a blanket or a strap,
even a dishtowel 
works great here, you can.
We're going to inhale, 
start to kick the right toes
out towards the right 
side of your yoga mat.
Use your left hand on the ground
or on your left ribcage
to slowly, slowly keep a
mindfulness in the left hip.
So we're opening up here.
You can use a strap,
you can use a towel,
you can clasp the 
big toe if you can.
If not, just make it your own.
We want to just 
play a little bit here.
Don't have to master the shape.
Again, keep a 
nice firm awareness
in the left thigh bone,
left hip.
Flex your left 
toes up towards the sky.
And then slowly 
bring it back over.
We're gonna 
squeeze the right knee
up towards the chest once again
and then cross it over 
the body, Supine Twist.
Breathe deep here.
Close your eyes.
Relax your jaw.
Then slowly come back to center.
Extend the right leg out.
Excuse me, 
extend both legs out.
Bring your hands 
back to the earth.
And then keep the 
right leg extended
as you bring the left leg up.
Hug the left knee 
into the chest, breathe.
And then here we go 
grabbing the left shin or calf,
the left ankle, 
maybe grabbing that big toe
or using a towel, 
a tie or a strap.
We'll start to extend 
left toes out, up and out.
Breathe deep here.
Try to keep your 
shoulders on the ground.
And then slowly reeling 
it all back into center.
Keep the right leg extended.
And here we go crossing 
the left leg across the body,
finding your Supine Twist here.
Breathe deep.
Inhale in.
Exhale to slowly 
melt it back to center.
From here you're going to
hug the knees into the chest,
cross the ankles, grab 
the outer edges of the feet,
and we're going to rock all
the way up to a seat again.
Send the legs out long,
Paschimottanasana.
So here's where you 
might want to grab your pillow.
Hike the edge of your pillow
all the way up 
to your hip creases.
Bend your knees generously.
And if you want to use 
more than one pillow you can.
Really bringing the earth up
to you to rest your forehead.
Alright, inhale in,
reach for the sky.
Exhale, draping forward,
Paschimottanasana.
Start with a nice bent knee.
Toes up toward the sky.
Heels in line 
with the hips to start.
If you want to work to 
bring the feet together,
that's up to you.
I'm going to go 
feet hip-width apart.
Inhale, everyone look forward.
Exhale to melt into the posture.
So there's going 
to come a point here
where you want to get out.
See if you can layer 
in a depth of breath here,
that you're in the breath 
instead of coming out
of the posture.
See what happens.
Pay attention to that moment
between the inhalation 
and the exhalation here.
Soften the skin of the forehead.
Lean in.
Check it out, take 
five more breaths here.
Count 'em out.
Relax your shoulders.
To come out of the pose,
move slow.
Keep the feet 
and the legs active.
Move down 
through your sits bones,
and with soft 
fingers tuck the chin
and slowly roll it back it up.
Bring the hands 
together at your heart,
Anjuli Mudra, and just notice
how you feel here in Dandasana.
Toes up towards the sky.
Inhale in.
Exhale, bring your fingertips
or your palms down to the earth.
And just a 
couple of seconds here
to find soft easy 
movement in the neck.
Cool, grab your pillah,
as we say in Texas.
Grab your pillow, 
you're going to come
onto one side, 
your favorite side.
If you have an extra 
pillow here, you can grab it
and use it for 
your head or your neck.
But your main pillow is going
to go between your legs.
Get comfy.
So set yourself 
up for support here
for our final posture,
a little relaxation.
When you're ready,
close your eyes.
Lift the corners 
of the mouth slightly.
And once again, bring 
your awareness to your breath.
Allow your breath to 
soften and just return
to its natural rhythm,
its natural flow here.
Notice if you might be holding
or clenching 
anywhere in the body.
See if you can 
soften and relax that too.
If it's bright in your space
and you want to 
bring your top arm over
to cover the eyes, 
you can do that here.
And just take a 
second here to chill.
And if you're already 
thinking about your next meal,
your next task, or 
your next to-do list item,
that's totally normal,
but that's what we kind 
of want to get at here today.
Just notice if that's happening.
Return back to your breath.
Choose to stick it out 
with me here on the video
and with Benji.
Commit to your practice.
If you're feeling good here
and you have nowhere to be next
you might pause the video
and stay here for 
a little bit longer.
If you're ready 
to rock and roll,
let's slowly 
take a deep breath in.
Use the top arm to 
press into the earth,
bottom arm to press our 
bodies all the way back up.
Move your pillow to the side.
Bring your hands 
together at the heart space.
Let's take one final loving
inhale in through the nose.
And exhale through the mouth.
Inhale to draw the 
thumbs up to the third eye.
And exhale to bow.
Thanks everyone.
Namaste.
