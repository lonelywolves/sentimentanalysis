- What's up party people?
Welcome to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 15, we've made
it to the halfway mark.
Hop into something
comfy and let's enter.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Okie doke my friends,
let's begin today's 
practice standing.
Come to the center of your
mat and just take a second,
to just loop the shoulders 
forward, up and back
a couple of times
here as you land, Day 15.
Wow. We're halfway through.
Today's practice,
an opportunity to enter.
See each inhale perhaps
as an opportunity, right,
to arrive, and now
here at the halfway mark,
Benji, Benji.
I think it's Wim Hof that says,
"The breath is a door," right?
We think of 
each inhale as an
opening of a door,
To go where? 
I don't know.
You tell me.
How about inside for now?
So let's bring the
hands to the belly.
Stand nice and tall.
Just take a second to
take a couple full inhalations
and exhalations. Landing here
again in the present moment.
Using that inhalation to
create space, expansion.
And using the exhale to soften
and then return.
Alright, then go ahead and
release the fingertips down.
So in celebration of the halfway mark,
we are going to begin
with a little
Knocking on Heaven's Door.
So walk the feet
as wide as the hips,
if not even a little wider,
and you're gonna
start to sway the arms,
the hands, 
a little left to right.
Soft bend in the knees and as
you can see if you peek at me
I'm creating like a bit
of a bend each time I go,
one way and then the
other in the opposite knee,
I want to be kind
of soft in my legs
so I'm not locking
out through the knee.
And so we enter the second
half of this journey together
with a bit of playfulness,
with the willingness to
maybe not decide where it ends.
And if you feel silly,
maybe you can use that mantra,
"Don't decide where it ends.
Just stick with it."
You can start to pick up
the pace a little bit here
and inhale as you
move one direction,
maybe to the right,
exhale to the left.
Inhale to the right,
exhale to the left.
Find a little groove or pattern
that feels right for you.
Using this practice, 
even if it feels a little silly
to hit the refresh
button as we enter
the second half of 
our quest for the breath.
Start to pick up
the pace a little more
if you're feeling brave.
Inhaling one way,
exhaling the other.
And see if you can find
a bit of an audible breath
to help anchor the mind.
Oh yeah, we're cool.
Keep it going
for ten,
nine,
eight,
seven.
Six,
five,
four. Let it go.
Three,
two.
And on the one, 
it slows down. Beautiful.
We come to Mountain Pose.
See if you can bring
the feet together
without looking down.
See feelingly.
And heart lifts here.
Beautiful, and if you're
not at the top of your mat
or near the top of your mat,
take whatever necessary
steps you need to get there,
maybe without looking, 'cause
you know the grounds there.
You have all this
amazing body awareness.
We're building that each
day we show up more and more.
Inhale, reach the fingertips 
up towards the sky.
Exhale, dive in, Forward Fold.
Inhale, halfway lift.
You know what you're doing
so just pay attention.
Enter the present moment
by really paying attention
to sensation, as you
exhale Forward Fold, good.
Plant the palms,
step it back, enter here.
Pretend like this
is the first time
you've ever been in Plank.
What can you find
that's new? (chuckles)
Inhale in deeply.
Exhale, hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Three to five breaths here. 
You got this.
Pedaling it out.
Taking pressure 
out of the wrists.
When you're ready, inhale, 
lift the right leg up high.
Exhale all the way up and
through to a nice low lunge.
Lower the back knee.
Inhale to look forward.
Let your heart really lift
and open towards
the front of your room.
Good, then exhale, plant
the palms, lift the back knee,
step the right toes back.
Inhale in here.
Exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
Three to five breaths,
work it out.
And on your next inhale,
lift the left leg up high.
Exhale, step it all
the way up and through.
Go ahead and lower onto
that right knee and inhale,
let your heart open forward.
Good and exhale.
Plant the palms, step the 
left toes back, Plank Pose.
Building strength, here we go.
Inhale, look forward,
shift forward on the toes.
Exhale all the way to the belly.
Inhale, we rise up,
Baby Cobra nice and small.
And exhale to release again.
Inhale we rise up Cobra,
maybe a little bit bigger.
And exhale to release.
And one more time inhale,
Bhujangasana, Cobra.
And exhale to release.
Curl the toes under,
press up to all fours
or Plank, your choice.
And Downward Facing Dog.
Breath out.
Bend the knees, inhale,
carve a line with the 
nose to look forward.
Exhale, step your 
way to the top.
Inhale, find a
little playfulness here,
find something new,
maybe airplane arms
come back into the picture.
Good and then exhale,
Forward Fold all the way down.
Root to rise here, inhale,
straighten the legs,
reach for the sky.
And exhale, hands back 
to the heart space.
Pause here, breathe in.
And breathe out.
Beautiful, interlace
the fingertips here,
press the palms forward.
From here you're
gonna just find
a little soft bend in the knees.
We're gonna take our
right heel and lift it,
and then you're going to trace
a line with your right toes
all the way back
and over towards
the left edge of your mat.
Peek at me if you need to.
So it's as if you're
ready to do a little curtsy.
Then slide your
hands all the way up
and take your hands
over towards the left,
as you feel this big
stretch in the right side body,
right hip crease, psoas.
Inhale in deeply.
Exhale to release,
come back to center.
You can release the
behind, Mountain Pose.
Good, second side.
Interlace the fingertips,
press them forward.
Soft bend in the knees
as you lift your left knee.
Excuse me, left heel,
bend your left knee.
And then here we go,
tracing a line back
and around and over
towards the right
side of your mat,
as if you're gonna
do a little curtsy here
and then we'll send
the pinkies up and over
towards the right
side here, breathing deep.
Feeling that awesome
stretch in the left side waist,
the front of the hip crease,
the shoulder,
the back, the psoas.
Maybe look up 
to your thumbs, inhale.
And exhale to release everything.
Come back to Mountain Pose.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale, Forward Fold.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale, plant the palms,
step or maybe
today you hop back,
Plank Pose. Be mindful.
Inhale to look forward,
shift forward.
Exhale to lower all
the way to your belly.
Inhale for Cobra.
Follow your exhale down.
Forehead to the earth.
Good, curl the toes under,
inhale to all fours 
or Plank Pose.
Exhale to Downward
Facing Dog, beautiful.
Inhale to lift
the right leg up high.
Exhale to step
it all the way up.
This time back leg stays
lifted as you reach the fingertips
forward, up and
back for a high lunge.
Now we know we can always keep
that left knee on the ground.
That's great, 
we have lots of options.
Inhale in here, big
beach ball up and overhead.
Check it out.
Exhale, left fingertips
are gonna go forward,
right fingertips
are gonna go back.
Again we can always lower
the left knee to the earth.
Beautiful, now stay here,
you're going to take
the right fingertips down,
maybe grab the outer edge
of the left thigh, maybe not.
Send the left
fingertips up, big stretch.
Good, left fingertips 
reach back now,
back, back, back as you inhale.
Exhale, navel draws in to
help stabilize this transition
as you open up to
the left, Warrior II.
Good, inhale, Peaceful Warrior,
right fingertips reach 
forward, up and back.
Keep that front knee bent.
And then exhale,
cartwheel all the way back
down to your lunge.
Inhale right fingertips 
to the sky, big twist.
Notice how it's changing,
it's evolving.
And exhale right
hand to the earth.
Step the right foot
back as you breathe in.
Lower down as you
breathe out nice and slow.
Inhale, Cobra.
Exhale to release.
Inhale to Plank or all fours.
Exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
Here we go, inhale left
leg up high, you got it.
Stick with me.
Exhale, step the
left foot all the way up.
Back knee stays lifted,
we know we can always drop
to the ground if we need to.
Big inhale to reach it up high.
Big beach ball up and overhead.
Nice, slow, deep breaths.
In control.
Inhale to find length.
Exhale nice and slow.
Head, heart and
center moving together.
Right fingertips forward,
left fingertips back.
So if the fingertips
don't go all the way back,
just go as far back
as allows today.
Beautiful. Now, right
fingertips are gonna go up,
left fingertips
are going to go back
and maybe we grab the
outer edge of the right thigh,
maybe not.
And then we'll continue.
Right fingertips reaching
back here, big breath here.
Lots of space.
Entering into 
some new territory.
Inhale.
Exhale, navel draws in.
Connection to core is
strong here as we transition
Warrior II, adjusting the feet.
Finding your center here,
taking up space.
Good. Keep the front knee bent.
Inhale, left fingertips reach up
and back, Peaceful Warrior.
And then slowly
cartwheeling all the way down.
Right hand to the earth.
Big inhale as you send left
fingertips up towards the sky.
Good, exhale.
Left hand to the mat.
Step the left toes back.
Inhale in.
Exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
Beautiful, nice
cleansing breath here.
Here we go, inhale
in through the nose.
And Lion's Breath, tongue out.
In through the nose.
Lion's Breath, tongue out.
Good, slowly
lower to your knees.
Walk the knees together,
feet together.
Send the hips back 
towards the heels
and drag the palms, 
past the knees, past the hips,
and then flick the fingertips
towards the edge of the mat
as you relax the weight of
the head and torso over
in Child's Pose, Balasana.
Alright, my darling.
Close your eyes here.
Feel the weight of
your shoulders drop.
And if this is not a
yummy posture for you
and you have not
made adjustments yet,
go ahead and make an
adjustment now, darling.
Come to Extended Child's Pose
or maybe a nice
comfortable seat.
And find a place of stillness
where you can close your eyes.
And hear the invitation to
enter.
So we've talked about letting go
of that which is no
longer serving, creating space.
Now today, the invitation is to
stay with it.
Stay with your breath.
And enter into the next wave,
the next stage or
whatever it may be.
Embodying the best and most
beautiful version of yourself.
Slowly make your way back up.
If you're seated right now,
we're coming to join you.
We'll walk the hands forward.
Swing legs to one side.
And then everyone extend
your legs out in front of you.
You can shake them out a
little bit, if you need to.
Then point your left
toes up towards the sky.
So flex your left foot,
press into your left heel
bend your right knee lift it up.
You're gonna hug your right heel
in towards your right sits bone
and give yourself
about a hand's worth,
handprint's worth of
space between your right foot
and your left inner thigh.
Sit up nice and tall, if you
need to grab a blankie here,
sit up tall on it.
That might be a good idea.
We're gonna hook the
left elbow around the right knee
send the right
fingertips behind.
Inhale to lift and
lengthen, feel it out.
Exhale to journey 
into the twist.
Left leg is super firm here.
Breathing.
Eventually, it
might take practice,
but we want to kind of take
the collapse out of the spine
here, this curvature, and
make it as straight as possible
so that we can create
that healthy flow of energy
to run up and down the spine.
Serving us so that we can enter
any and all beautiful
circumstance with ease.
Really present with the breath.
Alright, from here gently
release it. Check it out.
We're gonna take the right leg,
we're gonna lift 
the right foot up.
You're gonna grab your
right foot with your left hand.
And we're gonna
bring the left heel over
towards the
right side of the mat.
So from here, we're going to
rock a little back and forth
as if your right leg 
were a little baby (laughs).
Things just got very weird.
And we're rocking it.
And if you'd like, you can
take and see if you can bring
this right foot all
the way up to the elbow
and rock it here, 
a little side to side.
Good old leg baby.
And then rocking front and back.
Breathing deep here.
I just noticed my
sternum kind of collapsing here,
I'm gonna start to
lift it up a little bit.
And then releasing that,
letting it go.
Awesome.
Alright, left knee comes up.
Handprint of space in
between the right leg
and the left foot.
When you're ready, sit up tall,
hook the right
elbow on the left knee.
Squeeze the left
knee into center.
Left fingertips or
palm comes behind.
We flex through the right foot,
really press down
through the right thigh bone.
Inhale to lift and lengthen.
Head over heart,
heart of her pelvis.
And exhale to 
journey into your twist.
Keep squeezing,
hugging that left knee
in towards the midline.
Breathing here.
So good for the body.
Deep breaths down.
In through the nose,
out through the nose here.
And when you're ready,
we'll release.
We're gonna take the
left foot now, lift it up.
Grab it with the
right hand to start,
just check it out,
left side is probably going
to be different than the right.
We're gonna rock this leg baby
a little back and forth,
back and forth.
Maybe you take that foot
into the nook of the right elbow,
maybe not.
It is helpful to sit up
on a little somethin' here
if your spine is collapsing.
And we're gonna
rock the leg baby here.
If you know the
tune "Broadway Baby",
you might sing that now,
but with your leg baby.
Lots of opportunities, okay.
Benji, Benji.
Okay, now let's release,
here, buddy,
come here, come here
release the legs,
Benji's coming to the mat.
Perfect timing.
Extend legs out long.
Come to lie flat on your back.
Awesome, hug the
knees into the chest.
When you get there, bring
the palms to the kneecaps
and we're gonna
open the knees wide.
And just hang out here
for a second, soft feet.
Beautiful, now we're
gonna close the knees,
cross the right
leg over the left.
Try to keep the knees together,
as you grab onto your ankles,
maybe your pant leg
if you have it or the ankles
or maybe you grab onto the
outer edges of the feet here.
Then kick the toes out,
breathe deep here.
Lengthen tailbone actively
towards the front
edge of your mat,
or if you have a Benji
at the front of your mat
lengthen tailbone towards Benji.
Sweet, then we're
going to unravel the legs.
Palms come to 
the kneecaps, open 'em wide.
Soft feet.
Good, close the knees.
Cross the left
leg over the right.
Try to keep the
knees together here.
Grab the shins, the ankles
or we'll reach towards
the outer edges of the feet.
Kick both toes out.
Wooo! Breathe.
Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, 
hmmm, hmmm. Hello?
Hello hips, hello piriformis.
Hello whole body
that I love so much.
What are you saying hello to?
What are you
going to enter into
in the second
phase of our journey?
Yes or no, are you going to
enter embodying the best
and most beautiful
version of yourself?
Yes or no? Whisper it quietly.
Yes.
Unravel the legs.
Let the feet come to the ground.
Maybe with a thud, ah.
Extend one leg out 
then the other.
Allow your arms to
rest gently at your sides
as you maybe snuggle 
the shoulder blades
underneath your heart space.
Windshield wiper the
toes a little left to right.
Wiggle the fingers,
inhale in and then exhale.
Let everything go.
Come into an
exquisite stillness.
Inhale in deeply here. Feel it.
As if it were maybe a soft,
beautiful wave here.
And then exhale.
It crashes gently and falls.
Take a moment to
observe the breath here.
Blanket yourself in love.
Recommit to this daily practice.
You made a choice 
and we're here
both as individuals,
and also committed to
being here in this together.
So I look forward to seeing you
for tomorrow's
Sweet 16 practice.
Thank you for showing up.
Bring the palms together.
Inhale as you bring
thumbs to third eye.
And exhale to release.
Enter.
Namaste.
(bright upbeat piano music)
