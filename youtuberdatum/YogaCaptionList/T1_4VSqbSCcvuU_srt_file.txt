- Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 30 and today's 
session is called Journey,
which is what this 
thing is all about.
The journey home, 
the walk home,
the ride together on back home.
So it's a Day 30 tradition for
me to take off the microphone,
take a deep breath in,
don't panic,
because this is 
what it's all about.
You have the tools.
You always had 
everything that you need,
as do I, to uncover, 
to find what feels good,
to reveal what matters most.
So today I'm gonna take the
microphone off and you're gonna
use the vocabulary that we've
learned together thus far to
create your practice and 
to create your experience.
To me, this is such 
a beautiful day because
it really embodies the 
spirit of Yoga With Adriene,
which to me is this essence
or the spirit that says,
hey, I am taking care 
of myself here
in my little corner 
of the world,
but also I'm right 
here with you.
I got you.
So I'm gonna take 
off the microphone.
We're gonna work together.
You can use me.
As always, I'm here 
walking home alongside you.
You can use me as a reference, 
a guide at any time.
Try to keep an open mind.
Move slowly, 
mindfully and enjoy.
Find what feels good.
I love you so much.
Here we go.
