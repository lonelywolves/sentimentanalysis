- Hey everyone, 
welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and 
this is Benji, knucklehead,
and today we have a 
yoga for tension relief.
So it happens whether 
it's from emotional
or physical stress, 
we collection tension
and this is a really 
cool, calming practice
that's gonna help 
you relieve some of that
and find what feels good.
So hop into something 
comfy and let's get started.
(bright music)
Alrighty my friends, let's
begin in a comfortable seat.
Go ahead and use your towel
or blanket to sit on here
and just lift the hips up.
And a great way to gauge is if
you feel like your spine is
collapsing, totally normal, go
ahead and lift the hips up so
you can find length with a bit
more ease and what this lift
does is it gets the hips a
little bit higher than the femur
or the thigh bones and the knees
so that you can find that lift
with a little less struggle.
So I've spent a lot of time on
the ground by now and I'm able
to kind of open 
up through the hips.
Some people are just born
anatomically with more open hips
so I really can not stress
enough the importance of lifting
the hips up so you can sit
up nice and tall if you need.
Since we are addressing
tension and the way in which it
accumulates in the body due to
stress either physically or,
let's be honest, 
mentally or emotionally as well,
since we are addressing tension
today I think it's important
that we start in a nice
comfortable position and that we
already start to direct our
attention or our mind towards
what that feels like 
or even, you know,
observe or notice how hard it is
to get comfortable today, maybe.
So take your time, as always,
settling in but really taking
this first beat to 
notice where you are.
Maybe you're practicing 
along with Benji and I
for preventative care today.
Or maybe you have intentionally
selected this video to
welcome some 
much needed relief.
Wherever you are,
let's start to gently 
close the eyes or soften
the gaze and bring 
your attention inward.
When you're ready, 
start to notice your breath,
nice and easy.
So to me there's 
already so much value
in what you've already done.
Made the decision, 
selected the video,
pressed play, 
set yourself up to observe,
to find or work to find 
a nice comfortable seat.
So today's sequence 
is quite simple
but there's a lot 
of depth in this
opportunity that you've 
taken for yourself.
There's a lot there and as I
always like to say a little goes
a long way so just start
off nice and easy by allowing
yourself this time
to simply notice 
and observe the breath.
You don't have to do anything.
You don't have 
to force anything.
You certainly don't 
have to push any more.
But instead, 
with the eyes closed,
lengthening up 
through the crown of the head,
grounding down 
through the low body,
just notice your breath.
Great.
And try to stay present with
whatever's going 
on in the moment.
Again, some days 
it's a struggle to land.
And then some days 
you land, drop right in,
right into that 
comfortable seat,
into that Sukha.
That Sukhasana.
And then you may have observed
already that by just bringing
your awareness to the moment and
whatever is honestly going on in
the moment, things start 
to shift and change and
we see that with the breath.
So I have not really even guided
you into any technical pranayama
yet but you can
most likely already 
observe that by just
bringing your awareness 
to the present moment
your breath starts to change.
So if that's happening for
you, even if it's just like one
awesome deep breath, let it.
Allow it, allow it to happen.
And then whatever observations
you're making here and whatever
attention or listening
that's going on with the breath,
see if you can keep it going but
we'll just tuck the chin just a
hair and lengthen 
through the back of the neck.
And slowly draw the 
hands together at the heart.
But keep going, 
keep breathing, keep noticing,
allowing yourself 
to just be present
with whatever you've got.
Whatever you've 
brought to the table.
Gently deepening the breath.
Just inviting and/or welcoming
a sense of calm to the body.
So tension is a
many splendid thing, no.
Tension is interesting, right?
Because if it's not tended to
it can really 
accumulate fast, right?
And then the body 
starts to send us signals that,
you know, something isn't right
and that's that's when things
can go wrong and 
sometimes even terribly wrong.
So,
just allow yourself this
time and space here to breathe
and to notice and welcome
a state of calm 
back to the body.
And if it doesn't happen right
away or if it doesn't happen in
this practice just now 
that this time is valuable.
Signaling the brain 
and the body
saying it's okay 
to take a pause,
to be present with the
breath and to find stillness.
Then just notice where you might
be gripping or holding here.
Maybe in the skin of 
the forehead or the jaw.
The toes.
The shoulders.
Energetically even in the body.
Just doing a quick scan.
And then slowly keep breathing.
Keep all your beautiful
observations going
as you gently bow 
the head to the heart,
start to feel a deep stretch 
in the back of the neck.
Again, soften through the jaw.
Soften through the forehead.
And with the head bowing down,
see if you can lift up through
the center channel, 
so up through the plumb line,
maybe engaging the 
pelvic floor a bit.
Then lift up 
through the sternum a bit.
So you're just sitting up
a little bit taller 
within this shape.
It could be a big gesture.
It could be very subtle.
Then start to lift 
the corners of your mouth.
Take one more 
deep breath in here.
And as you exhale, 
slowly lift the head,
bring the hands to 
the thighs or the knees.
Head over heart, 
heart over pelvis here.
Great, inhale in.
Breathe into your belly.
This time as you exhale, see
if you can really listen to the
sound of your breath.
Maybe, perhaps, 
creating a little Ujjayi breath.
And see if you 
can keep that going.
Really anchoring the brain
and the breath together as one.
If you're not 
familiar with Ujjayi breath,
essentially we're taking 
the tip of the tongue
to the roof of the mouth,
creating this soft restriction
in the back of the throat.
We have a whole video on Ujjayi
breath so you can find that.
I will put it in the description
for you if you're interested.
And at the very least 
we're just seeing if we can
extend the inhale, 
extend the exhalation.
Starting to bring more pranayama
technique to the practice but
not losing that state of calm or
that willingness 
to welcome the calm.
See if you can get an 
audible breath going here.
You're doin' awesome.
And even if you can catch a
couple waves of this Ujjayi
breath, you're, I think, bound
to feel almost immediate
effects of this breath.
It's still so magnificent
to me how quickly pranayama,
focused pranayama, can 
really change the way we feel.
Take one more 
cycle of breath here.
And then we'll let that go.
We're gonna open the palms now,
spread the fingertips 
super wide open.
And then close 
into strong fists.
Here we go, big inhale to open.
Stretch.
And then close, strong fists.
Open.
And last time, close.
Super strong.
And then release, 
allow the fingertips to
now float to the fingertips.
Once again, gathering some
energy up through that center
plumb line, the midline.
You can kind of lift up,
little kegel from 
the pelvic floor if it helps.
Relax the shoulders 
down the back body,
lift your chest.
Inhale, lengthen 
through the crown.
Neck is nice and long.
Exhale slow and steady.
First just take 
the left elbow forward
and the right elbow back.
So we're not pushing and you
don't have your fingertips on
the ground or really force,
you've got to do 
the work from within.
Using your breath to 
find a twist in the spine.
Lower body's nice and heavy.
Crown is lifted.
And then all the 
way back through center,
right elbow forward,
left elbow back.
Keep the heart lifted.
Now we're gonna speed it up.
Back and forth.
You can find a nice rhythm of
breath here that suits you.
Smile.
Breathe.
Back and forth, nice and easy.
Head over heart, 
heart over pelvis,
so don't lean too far forward.
And not leaning 
way too far back.
Nice and stacked 
through all of the spine,
all of your chakras.
All those amazing, 
crazy points where all
your nerves come together.
Great, we're here for three.
Keep going.
Two, and on the one release.
Palms face up this time.
Fingertips float down.
Just take a deep breath in,
notice how you feel.
And a long breath out.
Excellent, let's come 
forward on to all fours.
Move nice and slow.
Move as if you're like 
moving through water
or nice beautiful air,
thick air. Fog, I mean.
Whatever.
Okay, here we go.
You can use your towel 
or your blanket to pad
the knees here if you like.
Excuse me, Benji.
Sorry, buddy.
Sorry, buddy.
Spread the palms, here we go.
Inhale to drop the belly,
open the chest.
Exhale to round 
through the spine,
chin to chest.
Inhale to open.
Exhale to contract.
Press into your fingerprints.
Press into the tops of the feet.
Slow and steady.
Inviting a softness 
into each gesture.
So not pushing.
Not forcing.
Biceps and elbow 
creases shining forward here.
Excellent. And then we'll bring 
it back to a nice neutral spine.
Bring your knees as 
wide as the yoga mat.
I'm gonna place my blanket to
the side but you can do whatever
you like with yours.
Big toes to touch and nice and
slow we're gonna melt the heart
into Extended Child's Pose.
Reach the fingertips forward.
Feel that opening through the
shoulders as your heart melts
towards your yoga mat.
You can get a little kiss of
the forehead on the ground here.
You can even rock the 
forehead gently side to side.
Here's where you close your eyes
and within the beautiful gentle
confines of your own 
private little love cave here,
choose to let go of 
any stress or tension
that is in your body
but honestly, in your life.
We don't even have to 
identify it here right now.
But sometimes we don't even
realize how strong we're holding
on to certain patterns 
that bring us stress.
That create tension.
Inhale lots of love in here.
Breathe into your back body.
Exhale lots of love out.
Beautiful.
Press into your foundation,
so connect with the ground,
connect with to the earth as
you slowly bring it back up.
Walk the knees underneath the
hips and we're gonna walk the
hands out again.
Eyes at elbows, so elbow 
creases towards the front.
Biceps towards the front.
We'll curl the toes under this
time and lift the hips up high,
Downward Facing Dog.
Excuse me little doggy.
Excuse me, dog.
Excuse me, dog.
No animals were harmed 
in the making of this video.
Okay, bend your knees,
pedal it out.
Start to find what feels good.
Start to find the 
places that are tight.
And then send your 
awareness and your love
and your attention 
towards those places.
So the more we start 
to do this on the mat,
particularly in 
the asana practice,
you can apply this 
to all of your asana,
the more we start 
to do this off the mat.
In our life situations, even in
something as simple as changing
your pillow, the one sleep 
on if you're lucky enough
to be able to do that.
Or, you know, letting go of
certain friendships that bring
tension or stress or bringing a
better communication to those
to relieve the stress or
the tension, et cetera.
Okay, we're here for three.
You're doing great.
I'm feeling some tightness 
and tension in my calves.
I'm pedaling it out.
Two, one, slowly 
lower back to all fours.
This time bring 
the knees together,
really together, and the 
arches of the feet together.
You're gonna come 
back into Hero Pose.
If this is not 
good for your knees,
just go back to that 
comfortable seated posture
that you were in before.
If you still want to give it a
try but the knees are giving you
a little bit of pain in 
the front or a little bit of
discomfort, take your blanky or
your towel and hike it up right
to the backs of the knees.
And you can even double roll it
and then come back and see if
that feels a little bit better.
Okey doke, so here we are.
Virasana variation.
Stacking through the spine,
lifting through the heart.
As you're ready just 
take a second to loop
the shoulders 
forward, up and back.
Just feel your shoulder 
blades coming together again.
As if you're, 
I like to say this,
pinching a pencil between 
your two shoulder blades.
For me, the image works.
Maybe it doesn't for you but
activating the upper body,
not just lifting up 
from the heart space.
So seeing the body
as one moving part, right?
360.
Okay, and from here we'll bring
the fingertips to the sides,
lift the corners of the mouth
slightly and on an inhale you're
gonna flip the palms up towards
the sky and reach all the way
up, up and overhead.
Big breath in.
And then exhale, float it down.
Inhale, palms up.
This is your vinyasa.
Exhale, palms down.
Move nice and slow.
Notice if you're rushing here.
Inhale, reach it up.
Exhale, float it down.
See if you can create 
a little resistance here.
Just even in the air,
this control.
Excellent, one more.
Inhale, reach it up.
Nice and slow, 
spread the fingertips.
Find your Ujjayi breath.
And exhale, press it down.
Excellent.
Fingertips reach down.
If they touch the earth, great.
If not, just lots of 
energy through the fingertips.
You're gonna take your right
ear over your right shoulder.
Breathe deep.
Inhale in.
Exhale, pressing your left
hand into an imaginary surface.
You're gonna flex the left
fingertips up towards the sky.
So you can play around here.
Pulling the pinky back or 
bringing the thumb forward.
You should feel incredible,
incredible sensation
and relief in 
the left trap here.
And you can play 
around with this,
breathing mindfully 
all the way along.
And then if you just got 
a have a little more here,
you can take your right hand,
gently rest it on 
top of your left ear.
Be really mindful.
Mmmmm.
Woo.
And if you're feeling brave,
lift your left fingertips up 
towards the ceiling.
Take a deep breath in.
Woo, and then exhale, release.
(sighs) Take a second.
Lot of energy in the fingertips.
And when you're ready, 
left ear over left shoulder.
So this might be 
your stopping point.
I definitely feel a nice opening
here from the back of the head,
the atlas, all the 
way to my low back.
Find the depth.
But then if you're ready 
to take it a step further,
start to press your right 
hand into an imaginary wall
and flex your 
right fingertips up.
So notice how I'm giving you
that image of really pressing
away versus just 
flexing the hand.
So this also gets into the
forearm and the wrist creating
strength in the wrists.
And then you can 
play around here.
Front, back.
Side to side.
Notice if you've started to hold
your breath when something tight
has come along.
When the tension gets magnified,
can you remember 
to breathe deep?
The audible breath is helpful.
And then take one more 
breath cycle here to maybe
bring the the left arm up.
Maybe play with reaching right
fingertips a little higher.
Woo, and then slowly release.
Awesome. Draw both 
shoulders up to the ears.
Big inhale.
Exhale, just drop it 
down with a sharp exhale.
(sighs) Twice more like that.
Inhale.
And exhale, sigh it out. (sighs)
And on this third one,
surprise yourself.
Let out a little sound.
If you have a pet 
or a friend around,
just freak them out on 
this last one a little bit.
Here we go.
Big breath in.
Squeeze, squeeze,
squeeze and exhale, let it go.
(audibly huffs)
Nothing.
Okay, if you're 
okay on your knees,
you can stay here otherwise
we're gonna shift right back to
the that comfortable seat.
Bring the palms together.
Close your eyes.
Tuck the chin.
Take a deep breath in.
And as you exhale, 
relax your shoulders.
Back to the breath, inhale.
Exhale.
Long inhale.
Long exhale.
So always, always, always
remembering the breath is there
for you to return to 
again and again and again.
If you're in Hero, 
go ahead and transition now.
We're gonna all come 
from our seated posture
to the ground, nice and slow.
Come to lie flat on your back.
Stretch the legs out long.
Take a deep breath in.
Feel supported by the earth.
Hands are gonna come down to
the ground and when you're ready
we'll bend one knee and then
the other bringing the heels up
towards the sits bones.
Toes are pointing 
forward not out or in.
Ground through all 
four corners of the feet.
Inhale in to 
lengthen through the neck.
And then exhale, you're gonna
really press into the palms and
press into the feet so use your
foundation to start to lift up
from the tailbone.
Feel this great stretch in the
quads and the front of the hip
creases as you lift 
up just into a nice,
easy Bridge Pose.
Nice and easy.
Strong legs here.
Palms are actively 
pressing into the ground.
We lift the chest to the chin
and then the chin 
up towards the sky.
Take a deep breath in.
Fill the belly with air.
And then exhale 
to slowly lower down.
Try to lower down nice 
and slow and with control.
Sweet, then walk 
the feet together.
Open the knees wide.
Bring one hand to the heart
and one hand to your belly.
Take the deepest 
breath you've taken all day.
Here we go, big inhale.
Exhale to relax everything.
Truly melt the weight of 
your body into the earth.
Relax every toe, every finger.
All the joints getting heavy.
All the muscles softening.
And your energetic body
takes a break.
Surrenders.
Part the lips gently.
Close your eyes.
Just take one 
final quiet moment here.
For yourself, with yourself.
And then slowly 
bring your attention
back to the breath.
Notice the rise and the fall.
And we will end today's practice
by remembering that
whenever we are in doubt
or whenever you 
feel stuck or tight,
full of tension 
and in need of relief,
whenever you feel like you're
gonna die or you're just not
gonna make it, remember
the breath is always there.
And the breath 
always comes first.
So if you feel like 
you're in an endpoint,
start again with the breath.
And on that note, 
let's bring the palms together.
You can stay here 
a little bit longer,
as long as you need by pausing
the video after this moment.
But we'll bring 
the palms together,
thumbs up to the third eye.
And just start to 
smile as you breathe here.
It's all good.
Everything is cyclical and
what's important is that you're
taking the time 
to care for yourself.
Not let that tension just 
keep building and building
but you're tending to it.
So way to go.
Remember the 
breath always comes first.
Take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
And you can keep 
the legs where they are.
You can slowly start to 
bring the knees together.
Walk the feet out as 
wide as the yoga mat.
Let the knees just fall together
and we'll sign off today's
practice by whispering,
Namaste.
(bright music)
