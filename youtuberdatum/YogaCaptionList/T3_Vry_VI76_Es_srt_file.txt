- What's up, everyone?
Welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene. This is Benji.
And we're super
glad you're here today.
We have Yoga for a Fresh Start.
So thank you for
choosing this practice.
Hop into something comfy,
and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Alrighty, my darling friend,
let's begin in a seat.
Come on down to the ground.
(clears throat) Ground. (laughs)
And if you have a
little pillow, blanket,
big beach towel,
something you can sit on,
let's use it
just to create 
a little padding
but also to lift the
hips a little bit or a lot.
Take your time just
getting settled in here.
And as you're ready,
see if you can 
slowly ease into this
place of stillness.
And it may be super simple.
You've been craving
this moment for awhile.
Or it may feel a
little difficult.
Perhaps you feel
a little fidgety
or it's just really hard
to ground in this moment.
So as you attempt
to become more still,
it's not actually
about nailing the stillness.
Although that can feel great.
Who are we kidding?
But the act, 
the actual process of
doing that is gonna give 
you a lot of information,
a lot of feedback on
how you are doing today.
I invite you to close
your eyes or soften your gaze
and just allow the sound
of my voice to guide you here
as we tune in to the
sound of the breath.
And same thing here.
Not about nailing that
perfect full, slow, deep breath
right away, but
it is the process
of first bringing
awareness to the breath,
noticing how you're breathing,
and then we can begin
to shift it and change it.
Why? So that we can
move with more ease,
so that we can breathe better,
with more efficiency.
So right now we're just
noticing how we're feeling.
Inviting a stillness in
and inviting an
awareness of the breath.
And as you bring more attention
and more curiosity
to your breath here,
noticing how you feel, what
your energetic state is like,
how your body's feeling.
As you bring more awareness,
more curiosity to the breath,
you'll begin to 
notice that it can
start to change.
You might start to
breathe a little deeper.
You might start to
notice places in your body
where you're kind of holding,
either in the
shoulders or the fingers,
the glutes, the jaw,
the feet, the toes.
Allow yourself to
really kind of come to the mat
with whatever you have today.
But also I am 
humbly inviting you,
lovingly asking you,
to be open to allowing
things to change, to shift.
Ya never know.
Draw the hands together,
and let's take a couple
slow and controlled breaths
in and out together.
Again, you can keep
your eyes closed here.
Gaze soft down, past your nose.
Tuck the chin just a little bit
so you feel length in
the back of the neck.
And begin to sit up
a little taller again,
more awareness being invited in,
more awareness of the spine.
Get really heavy
from the waist down.
Soft in the skin of the face.
Shoulders are relaxed.
And here we go.
Please inhale in
with me for a six count.
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
And exhale on 
a six, five, four,
three, two, one.
Let's try again. Big inhale.
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
Shoulders are relaxed.
Exhale for six, five, four,
three, two, one.
Last one. Inhale.
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
Pause, shoulders relaxed.
Exhale for six, five, four,
three, two, one.
Release the breath ratio.
Bring the hands to
the tops of the knees.
You can open your eyes here.
Inhale, drop the
shoulder blades down actively
and lift your chest.
Gaze up at the ceiling.
Exhale, round through the spine,
chin to chest,
shoulders forward,
nose towards your belly button.
Inhale, lift the chest.
Think Cow Pose here.
Drop the shoulders down.
Look up. Careful not to
crunch the back of the neck.
And exhale, chin to chest.
Think Cow, excuse me, Cat Pose.
Nose toward your belly.
Feel that stretch in
the upper back body.
And rotating in the pelvis,
one last time.
Here we go.
Lifting up.
Lifting up.
Think about lifting from
your armpit chest area this time.
Lift, lift, lift.
Open your throat.
And in front of the neck,
and then exhale, chin to chest.
Last one like this.
And we're gonna hang
here for a couple breaths.
Shoulders forward.
Allowing the weight of the
head to bow down, head to heart.
Alright. Take one more
cycle of breath here
just in case you didn't get
a nice, full deep
cycle of breath in here.
Take it now.
And then we'll slowly lift
the head and the heart back up,
relax the shoulders down,
and come into a 
nice long, tall spine here.
We're working on our posture.
The more regular we practice,
the easier this
sort of maintenance
in postures like this become.
Of course, if sitting
cross-legged is not your jam,
you can do this work seated
at the edge of a couch
or at the edge of a chair.
Maybe you lift
up a little higher.
Alright. Just a little 
love for the neck here.
We're gonna go left
ear over left shoulder.
Actively draw the
right shoulder down.
Breathe in. Lift your
heart. Lift your chest.
Breathe out. Relax your
shoulders down a little more.
Good. Inhale.
Breathe in and reach the right
fingertips towards the earth.
If they touch, great.
If not, you can just
reach towards the ground.
And exhale. Drop the shoulders.
And one more cycle of
breath here on your own.
Listen to the
inhale and the exhale.
Great. Bring it
back to center. Reset.
Right ear over the right
shoulder when you're ready.
Just feel it out.
Notice how this feels.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale to relax
the shoulders down.
Think of your shoulder blades
going down, down, down,
towards the earth.
Gentle lift in the chest. 
Breathe in.
And breathe out.
And on your next inhale,
reach the left
fingertips towards the earth.
Listening to a full
cycle of breath here.
Go.
And on the end of that exhale,
bring it back to center.
We're gonna draw small circles.
Draw, draw. Not drawl. Sorry.
Draw small circles with the nose.
And then feel it
out in your neck.
If it feels good,
if it feels right,
you can allow those circles
to get bigger and bigger.
And just notice if you're
holding your breath here.
And then reversing the circles.
Woo.
And then we're gonna
nod the head yes and no
by dropping the chin
to the chest, of course,
and then looking up.
Nice and slow.
Slow it down.
And now left to right.
Awesome. Let's bring it back to
center and move onto all fours.
You can use your
blanket or towel
if you have it to pad the knees.
If you like. If not, no worries.
Tabletop Position here.
Wrists underneath the shoulders,
knees directly
underneath the hips.
So upper arm bones rotate out.
Fingertips are spread wide.
We're gonna draw the belly
button up to meet the spine.
So you can peek at me
for a little demo here.
Here's my belly just
kinda hanging out. Beautiful.
And here's an active engagement
of drawing the belly in
and lengthening
through my low back.
Basically supporting my low
back with my core engagement.
Sweet, gaze straight down now.
Nice long, beautiful neck.
So not collapsed in the neck.
Crown of the head
is reaching forward,
tailbone's reaching back,
of course, aiming back.
Curl the toes under. Inhale in.
Exhale.
We're gonna find
that core engagement
as we lift the knees
and hover here for five.
You got it.
Four, three, two, one.
Lower the knees, 
press into the tops of the feet.
Inhale, drop the belly.
Exhale round through the spine.
Great, nice neutral spine. 
We're gonna repeat.
Curl the toes under. Inhale in.
Exhale, lift the knees,
Hovering Table for five,
four, three, two, one.
Lower the knees,
press into the tops of the feet.
Inhale, Cow Pose.
Exhale, Cat Pose.
Bring the breath.
Alright, last round.
Nice neutral spine.
Curl the toes under, 
gaze straight down.
Here we go, inhale in.
Exhale, lift the knees. 
Let them hover.
This time for ten,
nine, eight, seven.
Six, you got this.
Five, four, stick with it.
Three, two, and one.
Lower the knees.
Press into the tops of the feet.
Listen carefully. We're gonna 
bring the toes together.
Widen the knees a little bit,
wider than hip width apart.
Now inhale.
You're gonna bring the
right hand to the low back,
and then we're gonna open
up the chest to the right.
Take a deep breath in here.
Long breath out.
Deep breath in.
Long breath out.
So I'm not collapsing my left
ear to my left shoulder here.
I'm getting in the habit
of keeping nice integrity
in the neck, remembering
it's an extension of the spine.
Take one more breath.
And slowly back to center we go.
Right hand to the earth.
Other side, the left hand 
to the low back.
So we're inviting a gentle
twist in the mid back here
as we open up the
chest and breathe.
We're not collapsing into
the right hand, right shoulder.
I'm pressing away
from the yoga mat.
Deep inhale.
And long exhale.
Lots of awareness in the
neck for this final inhale.
And exhale.
Good. Release back to center.
Walk the knees back in
underneath the hips.
Walk the hands
forward just a bit.
Again, fingertips are spread,
upper arm bones
rotate out, left to right.
We'll curl the toes under
and peel the tailbone up and
back for Downward Facing Dog.
Take a couple
breaths here. Feel it out.
I'm gonna move my
blanket to the side,
but feel free to
keep yours there
if you think you
might like to use it.
And nice and easy.
We're gonna bend
both knees generously.
Carve a line 
with the nose, look forward.
Then step one foot
and then the other
as many times as you need to
up to the front of the mat.
So we're gonna start
with a nice wide stance here.
Feet hip width apart
or even a little wider
if you could use a
little more space.
Toes are pointing forward.
Then once you feel grounded
in all four corners of the feet,
begin to bend your knees
and allow the front
body to relax a little more.
This will look and feel a
little different for everyone.
Gone are the days of like,
teachers used to say
peanut butter and jelly,
like, try to bring
your front body
to your lower body.
You can just let it hang
with a nice strong
foundation grounding you.
A nice bend in the knees.
See if you can
begin to really relax
the weight of the shoulders,
the arms, the wrists,
the hands, and the neck 
and the head nice and heavy.
Now with strong,
conscious footing,
start to find a little sway.
We wanna start to stir
things up, move things around,
so that we can experience
a shift of any size
to help us start fresh.
Move it around.
Take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
And then we'll
come back to center
and bend the
knees a little more.
Legs are engaged.
We start to actively draw energy
up from the arches of the feet.
Imagine you're trying to
tear your yoga mat in half,
right down the middle.
That's how engaged the legs are,
turned on as you slowly begin
to roll it up, nice and slow.
Stand up nice and tall,
head over heart,
heart over pelvis,
here in Mountain Pose.
Reach the fingertips behind.
You're gonna interlace them here
behind the small of the back.
And then draw the knuckles down
as you lift the chest up here.
Soft bend in the knees.
You're gonna just
rotate to one side
and then the other
very gently, soft knees.
And then back to center.
Take a deep breath in.
Lift the chest. Lift the heart.
Send your gaze up
just a little bit.
Now lengthen tailbone down.
You're gonna
feel this connection,
drawing the energy that
we talked about earlier
up in the arches, strong legs,
as if you're tearing your
yoga mat right down the middle.
Good, then release the arms.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
And exhale.
Wiggle the fingertips
and rain it all the
way down to Forward Fold.
Hi, Benji. (chuckles)
Inhale, halfway lift.
Find length in the
spine. Soft knees.
And exhale, slow and
steady here to fold.
Good, root to rise.
Inhale, reach to the sky. 
Strong legs.
Spread the fingertips.
Reach, reach, reach,
reach, reach.
And this time
bring the palms together
as you slide the
thumbs to the heart space.
Legs are really strong here.
We're working to
find that sensation
of grounding in
the feet and the legs,
working our way
up to the center.
Here we go again.
Fingertips are gonna 
go down to come up.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Big breath. 
Big, big stretch here.
And then on your exhale,
bend the knees,
wiggle the fingertips,
send it all the way down,
Forward Fold.
Now keep your knees
bent in this Forward Fold.
You're gonna walk the fingertips
over towards the
left side of your mat.
You're gonna feel
stretch in the right side waist,
the low back here.
Again, bend your knees.
And notice if the toes
have kind of come
out of alignment here.
See if you can try,
or at least have the awareness
of what's happening in the feet,
to keep the toes
pointing forward.
And you don't have to come
close to touching the ground.
We can work here with
active fingertips, arms hanging.
Good, and then 
take it through center
and over towards the
right side of the mat.
Fingertips just
reaching towards the earth.
One day we'll get there, maybe.
Maybe seven years
from now. Maybe never.
And if the fingertips
are not on the ground,
you get to work
on really finding
this lift up through the
belly button, the navel.
We call this Uddiyana Bandha.
Center lock.
Cool, and then everyone
come back to center.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Find length in the spine.
And exhale to fold.
Again, root to rise.
So ground through the feet,
spread the fingertips.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Big breath. Big stretch.
And exhale, hands
to heart once again.
Think about
aligning now your head
and your heart and
your pelvis in one line.
If a big, big, big gust of wind
were to come through magically,
would you get blown away here?
Or can you ground and engage,
activate in such a
way that you feel solid?
Or just more solid
than you were a minute ago.
So just by bringing awareness,
we've already become more solid,
and then we can kind of
build on that from there, right?
Instead of continuing 
on a hamster wheel.
Which happens, right?
Okay. From here, we're gonna
keep the palms together
at the heart space.
If you wanna
interlace the fingertips
for slightly more stability,
you can.
I like to think of two
different versions of prayer.
You're gonna shift your
weight to your left foot.
And we're gonna just slow
and steady lift the right knee.
Excuse me.
Yes, right knee. But right heel.
And with the right
big toe on the ground,
we're gonna rotate 
the ankle one way
and then the other.
Now, option to lift that foot
in the air and rotate
one way and then the other.
So you just have two
different options here.
One has a little more stability.
And they're both great.
And then release that.
Shift over to
the right foot now,
lift the left heel,
and same thing.
Nice, slow,
steady circles one way
and then the other.
And you can lift the toes,
or you can keep
them on the ground.
Great. Both feet 
come to the ground.
Hands come to the waistline.
You're gonna slide the
right toes back like so.
Then we're gonna come on
to the tops of the toes,
the top of the foot really.
You can think about
lengthening your tailbone down,
lifting your navel.
Or let's think about hip points,
the better image.
Lifting the hip points,
imagine they had two lights here,
up towards your face.
So I'm tucking the pelvis,
essentially,
to get the most
out of this stretch.
Give it a try.
If you've not stretched
the top of your ankle or foot
ever or in a while, this could 
be intense so breathe.
Press into all four
corners of your left foot
for amazing stability.
It's there. You got it.
Let's test it out actually
by now slowly dragging the
right toes all the way through.
We're gonna lift
the right foot up.
Flex, flex, flex the foot.
And then back down. 
Mountain Pose.
Awesome.
Right foot on the earth. 
Find that stability.
And left toes go back.
Then onto the tops of the toes.
Tuck the pelvis.
Nice, engaged, lower body.
Center's turned on here.
In fact, you can take some
fingers maybe to the belly
and just see, is it
kind of all hanging here,
or can I find that containment,
that connection.
In strength training,
it's called a brace.
Fire that brace.
And then let's check
out the center work here.
Oops. Had to reestablish
connection with all four corners
of my right foot to just
test out a One-Legged Tadasana.
So I'm not doing this 
to challenge you or to, like,
see if you can get it, right?
It's about the process,
so letting things shift
and taking little steps to
move forward.
Alright. Put that down 
and let's flow.
Inhale, reach the
fingertips up towards the sky.
Nice and slow.
Exhale, wiggle the fingertips.
And slowly bring it down,
Forward Fold.
Inhale, lift up halfway.
Long neck here.
Shoulder blades draw together.
And then exhale, let it go.
Bend the knees. Plant the palms.
You're gonna step the
feet back to a Plank Pose.
Find that containment here
as you reach the heels back.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale to lower the
knees to the ground.
Inhale to look forward again.
And then exhale to lower
all the way to the belly.
Inhale for Cobra.
Follow your breath,
exhale to release.
Inhale, curl the toes under.
Exhale to all fours
or top of a pushup.
Inhale in again here, 
full breath.
And exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
Right away from
your Downward Dog,
anchor through the left heel
and inhale, lift the right
leg up high, Three-Legged Dog.
Try to press into
both palms evenly.
Dial your right
toes towards the ground.
Here we go.
Inhale in again.
Exhale, slowly shift forward,
step the right
foot all the way up.
Lower the left
knee to the ground.
Press into the top
of your left foot.
Inhale with
fingertips spread wide.
Sweep the fingertips 
forward, up and back.
Lifting the arms, the hands
all the way up to the sky.
Imagine you're holding a
big beach ball up and overhead.
Now lift up from the
pelvic floor to support the hips.
Take a deep breath in.
And on a breath out,
slow and steady,
bring the hands
back down to the ground.
Curl the right toes under.
Excuse me, left toes under.
Lift the left knee.
And then when you're ready,
step the right toes back.
Top of a pushup, Plank, or lower
the knees for a Half Plank.
Take a deep breath in.
Everyone look forward.
On an exhale, slow and with 
control, lower to the earth.
Inhale for Cobra.
Follow your breath.
And exhale to release.
Inhale in again here.
Feel that breath in your belly.
Curl the toes
under as you exhale
to all fours or
top of a pushup, Plank.
Good, inhale in again.
Reach the heels
back if you're in Plank.
And exhale, hips up high
and back, Downward Facing Dog.
Anchor the right heel.
Inhale, lift the
left leg up high.
Press into both palms evenly.
Dial your left toes down.
Hips nice and even.
Good, inhale in again.
Exhale, shift forward,
nice and slow, with control.
Step that left
foot all the way up.
Lower the right
knee to the ground.
Press into the top of
the right foot firmly.
Front knee over front ankle.
Let's find this scoop here.
Spreading the fingertips.
Inhale, reach the fingertips 
forward, up and back.
Squeeze the inner
thighs to the midline,
lift up from the pelvic floor.
Big beach ball up and overhead.
Good, inhale.
Lift the chin. Lift the chest.
And exhale,
wiggle the fingertips,
bring it down to the earth.
Curl the right toes under, 
lift the right knee.
Find your center then step that
left foot back for Plank Pose.
Inhale to look forward, 
shift forward.
Exhale to lower all
the way to the belly.
Inhale for Cobra.
Exhale, soften and release.
Take a big breath in here. 
Crocodile breath.
Feel your belly press against
the earth as you breathe in.
Exhale, curl the toes under.
Pressing up, half pushup 
or top of the pushup.
Take a deep breath in again.
And exhale to
Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale in deeply here.
And exhale completely.
One more time. Deep breath in.
Clawing through the
fingertips. You got this.
Slow exhale.
Inhale, lift the
right leg up high.
Exhale, step it all the way up.
We're gonna pivot
on the back foot,
and we're gonna lead with
the left fingertips here,
front knee's bent.
We're gonna slowly
reach the left fingertips
all the way up and over,
opening into a Warrior II.
Back toes are turned in.
Front knee over front ankle.
Spine nice and long.
So just see, can you
feel with that inner mirror
if you're shifting forward?
Can you pull back
to align head, heart,
center, the pelvis here?
Opening up through the chest.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale to relax the shoulders.
Now keep the front
knee bent as you inhale,
send the right
fingertips up towards the sky.
And then from here,
slow and steady,
you might pull the right
thumb back a little more,
Peaceful Warrior.
Inhale in here.
Exhale. Listen carefully.
Hug those low ribs
in for nice support.
We're gonna come back forward,
right elbow to the
top of the right thigh.
Great, left hand comes 
to the small of the back.
and we open up the chest here.
You can stay here,
Extended Side Angle.
Or if you'd like,
you can reach the
fingertips to the ground.
Maybe take the left
arm up and overhead
or all the way
towards the front of the mat.
So choose a variation
that works great for you here.
Opening the heart,
the chest to the sky.
Good, then inhale 
wherever you are.
Full breath. Nice, wide breath.
Exhale to bring it all the
way back down to your lunge.
Frame the right foot
with your fingertips.
Inhale to look forward.
Back knee's lifted.
Exhale to plant the palms.
And take a vinyasa,
belly to Cobra
or Chaturanga to
Upward Facing Dog.
Move with your breath.
And let's meet in
Downward Facing Dog.
When you get there,
let's take a nice
deep breath in together.
Inhale.
And exhale.
And one more time,
just in case you're
just now coming into it.
Inhale.
And exhale. I got you.
Anchor the right heel.
Inhale, lift the
left leg up high.
Exhale, shift it
forward. Step it up.
Pivot on the back foot.
Front knee over front ankle.
Right toes are turned in.
And here we go.
Leading with the
right fingertips.
Strong legs. Strong
connection to center.
Right fingertips
reach forward, up,
and then way
back for Warrior II.
So drop your center.
We're building
strength in the glutes.
Engage your right inner thigh.
Press in all four
corners of the feet.
So don't forget
about the outer edges
in these Warrior postures.
Spine is nice and tall.
Send your focus out past
your left fingertips here.
Breathe deep.
And on your next inhale,
nice and slow,
keep the legs where they are,
left fingertips are gonna 
reach up towards the sky.
And then maybe all the way back,
pulling back
with the left thumb.
Keep pressing into the
outer edge of your right foot,
outer right heel.
Good, and then 
hug the low ribs in.
From a nice, strong center,
we're gonna bring it forward.
Left elbow on top
of the left thigh.
Right hand comes to
the small of the back,
and we open up the chest.
Stay here or maybe 
we play with bringing
the left fingertips 
down to the earth,
right fingertips
up towards the sky
or maybe even all
the way up and overhead.
Take one more breath here.
Think at nice,
lateral wide breath.
Again, really great
for bringing your rotation
safely into that mid back.
So awesome.
On an exhale, slow and steady,
guide it back
down to your lunge.
Keep the back knee
lifted if you can.
Inhale to look forward.
And exhale to plant the palms
and move through a
little dance here.
Belly to Cobra,
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Maybe you sneak
in a couple pushups,
'cause wow, things
are moving around.
We'll meet in
Downward Facing Dog.
If you're feeling
challenged right now,
it's all good.
Way to show up and keep working.
We're gonna do one
more dance on each side.
Here we go.
Inhale, lift the
right leg up high.
Exhale, step it all the way up. 
Pivot on the back foot.
Here we go. Warrior II again.
Leading with the
left fingertips.
Take it all the way up and back.
Front knee has a
nice, generous bend.
Good, inhale, Peaceful Warrior.
Same as before.
Exhale, Extended Side Angle.
Good. Inhale. 
Open up the chest.
Exhale, bring it all the way
back down to the lunge.
This time, 
back knee stays lifted
or it can lower to
the ground, your choice.
Inhale, big twists here.
Right fingertips
up towards the sky.
Good. Breathe.
Draw the shoulders
away from the ears.
Wiggle the right fingertips,
and then bring it all the
way back down to the lunge.
Listen carefully here.
From here, you're gonna 
bend your left knee,
and we're gonna step
the left foot up halfway.
Halfway, Pyramid Posture.
Breathe here.
Allow the head to relax.
Fingertips can
stay on the ground,
or we might cup the calf here,
drawing the elbows in.
Inhale in.
Exhale, release fingertips 
back to the earth.
Kick the left foot
back for a nice lunge.
Inhale to look forward.
Let your heart energy
just radiate forward.
Open up. It's all good.
And here we go.
Planting the palms,
stepping the right toes back,
Belly to Cobra,
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog
or maybe you just go
straight to Downward Facing Dog.
That's where I will meet you.
Nice and slow and steady.
Reconnecting with your breath.
And when you're ready, inhale,
lift the left leg up high.
Exhale to shift it forward.
Step it up.
Pivot on the back foot.
Leading with the 
right fingertips, Warrior II.
Big inhale, we rise up.
Exhale, settle in.
Inhale, Peaceful Warrior.
Big breath. Big stretch.
And exhale, Extended 
Side Angle, your version.
Inhale to spiral the
chest up towards the sky.
Strong legs.
Exhale to dial it
back down to your lunge.
Pivot on the back foot.
Feel free to lower the
knee here if you need to.
Right hand to the earth.
Inhale, left fingertips 
to the sky.
Big twist, wring it out.
Good. Wiggle the
left fingertips.
Slow and steady, bring it down.
Here we go.
We're gonna bend both knees.
We're gonna step
the back foot up.
Just halfway. Pyramid Posture.
The feet are not on
the same tightrope line.
They're on two
parallel lines here, like skis.
Pull the left hip crease back.
Breathe deep.
Maybe hands come
to the calf here.
Not gripping hard in the toes.
Inhale in.
Just notice how you're doin'.
And exhale to release.
Kick the right foot back.
Inhale, open the chest. 
Look forward.
Exhale, last one.
Plant the palms, step it back.
Belly to Cobra or
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Follow your breath.
Let's meet in
Downward Facing Dog.
When you get there,
take the deepest
breath you've taken all day.
Inhale in.
And exhale to release.
And let's start fresh.
Inhale in deeply.
And exhale completely.
Bend both knees generously.
Carve a line with
your nose to look forward.
And then slowly step, step,
as many times as you need to,
up to the front of the mat.
Feet hip width apart.
Lots of space, or you might play
with bringing the feet
together now this time.
Inhale lifts you halfway,
your version.
Find that nice long neck.
And exhale to
soften and bring it down.
Bend the knees generously.
Send the hips back,
fingertips forward. Chair Pose.
We're just gonna
create a little fire.
Burning away that
which no longer serves
so that we can
start fresh, start anew.
Sink the hips back.
Lots of weight in the heels,
but we're pressing into
all four corners of the feet.
Spread the fingertips.
You're holding that
big beach ball here.
You're here for three.
You get a little lower.
Two, get a little lower.
And one, we rise up nice 
and slow and with control,
sending that big beach ball
all the way up and overhead.
And then exhale,
hands back to the heart.
And Mountain Pose.
Close your eyes and
just observe the breath.
Alright, lift the chin.
Send your gaze
out in front of you.
Without fidgeting or looking,
just release one hand
down and then the other,
standing in Mountain Pose.
Take a deep breath in.
And exhale out
through the mouth.
Nice cleansing breath.
And one more, just like that.
Inhale lots of love in.
And lots of love out.
So we have just two more
things to do here in the stance
before I send you off
into the rest of your day.
So the first thing is
we're gonna send the
fingertips out in front.
And you're gonna cross
the right arm over the left.
Right arm over the left.
Then we're gonna
bend at the elbows,
and we're gonna come
into these Eagle Arms here
by maybe wrapping the arms,
but if they don't wrap,
that's okay.
Whatever variation
you're in, lift the elbows up.
Find this strong
connection in the low body
that we've
established the whole practice.
And we'll lift up
from here. Eagle Arms.
So like the Eagle, Garuda,
see if you can find a focus now,
either out in front or maybe 
down gently past your nose
as you inhale in.
Exhale, drop your center.
The knees will bend
so you can do just that.
And then nice and easy,
we're gonna shift the
weight to the right foot.
Lift the left leg.
Maybe cross it over the right.
You can use your toes on the
ground as a little kickstand,
just like we did
with the ankle rolls.
You can keep that
big toe on the ground,
or you might wrap it
around the left calf.
The right calf, excuse me.
Now find your focus here.
And we can just do the
arms with strong standing legs.
Refocusing our awareness.
Refocusing our attention.
Building some heat.
Inhale in.
Exhale to slowly release the
legs and then release the arms.
Allow the arms to come gently
left to right, and just feel.
Observe your breath.
Alright, second side.
Send the fingertips forward.
Right arm underneath 
the left this time.
Find the arms first. 
Strong legs.
Strong standing legs,
find the arms first.
As you lift the elbows,
draw the shoulder blades down.
Keep the chest nice and open.
Skin of the face, soft.
Don't worry about the wrap.
If you can't give the wrap,
just work on the
shoulders and the chest.
Breathing deep here.
Then find your focus, your Drishti,
something to gaze upon.
Inhale in deeply.
Exhale, bend the 
knees generously.
Center goes down.
And this time we
lift the right heel,
maybe cross 
the right leg over.
Can you use the right
toes as a kickstand here?
Or maybe it wraps around,
Garudasana.
Lifting the elbows, dropping
the shoulders, knees bend.
They really, really bend.
Center is dropped in space.
And you find your
focus or your Drishti,
something new to gaze upon.
Listen to the
sound of your breath.
Anchor in that song.
And then when you're ready,
legs unravel.
We ground through the feet.
Arms release.
And we come to Mountain Pose.
Notice how you feel.
Alright. Take a 
couple of breaths here.
Loop shoulders one
way and then the other.
So the Eagle Pose,
allowing us the opportunity
to refocus our attention
but also to refocus and
realign our energy, right?
Sometimes we 
can distract ourselves,
our thoughts, right,
busy thoughts or toxic thoughts,
with other things.
But we're not really
actually getting to the root,
which is whether or not we
have a healthy flow of energy
in the body to
help us move forward.
To save ourselves. (chuckles)
Alright.
So just to make sure
we're checking with the energy
and to, maybe if you have
been in a serious place,
just to help you kind
of move that a little bit.
We're gonna end with
one of my favorite moves.
So you're gonna walk the feet
a little bit wider
than hip width apart,
soft bend in the knees.
And you're gonna start to sway
with the arms heavy,
a little, left to right.
So don't stop the video now.
Why?
Complete it. You got this.
You made a choice.
You're here for a reason.
Hardest part is showing up,
and we're almost
done with this practice.
So stick with it.
You can take a Shavasana after
this video comes to a close
if that's right for you,
if time allows.
But we're moving here.
So it's important to
keep a soft bend in the knees
and a little
malleability in the feet,
which we already warmed up.
I'm gonna start
to pick up the pace.
And we're gonna
start to add breath.
No, I'm not in
the room with you.
So I'm inviting you.
I'm cheerleading you.
I'm counting on you
to bring the breath.
Whatever that means to you.
Pick up the pace, and
align with your breath.
Maybe it's inhale to one side,
exhale to the other.
Maybe it's just nice,
full, deep breaths.
We call this move
Knocking on Heaven's Door.
Get a little booty slab.
We're creating a
healthy flow of energy
that runs up and down the spine,
letting go of that
which no longer serves.
Sprinkling a little love,
a little care.
A lot of trust.
Trust in the unknown.
Trust that things will work out.
Trust that if you get your
energy right or work to,
then you can contribute 
in a meaningful way.
Keep this going.
I'm gonna stop
talking for a good 10 count
and allow you to
rock and roll here.
Stick with it.
And then start to slow it down.
Nice and easy.
Nice and easy.
If you felt silly, trust me,
you're not the only one.
And slowly, slowly, slowly
come to a place of
exquisite stillness.
See if you can.
And just notice how you feel.
No need even compare it
to the beginning of class.
We're here now in
this present moment.
If it's helpful,
maybe you tap into a
little inner smile here.
If it's helpful,
maybe you use each exhale
as an opportunity to
relax your shoulders.
Releasing any
tension in the neck.
Then nice and slow,
like you love yourself,
almost as a sensual move,
bring the palms
together at your heart space
and walk the
feet underneath you.
It could be hip width apart
or together, really together.
Just nice and underneath you.
And you can close your eyes here
and just set a little
intention for yourself.
You can finish the
sentence "I choose."
I choose.
Moving forward, I choose...
Moving forward, I choose...
And take a deep breath in.
Consider it all already done.
Imagine it already so.
And as you exhale, bow your head
to your heart, to your hands.
And we'll whisper,
Namaste.
Thanks, everyone.
(upbeat music)
