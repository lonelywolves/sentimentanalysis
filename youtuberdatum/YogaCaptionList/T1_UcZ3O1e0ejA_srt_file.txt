- Howdy everyone,
welcome to Home,
your 30-day yoga journey.
I'm Adriene and this is Benji,
and today is day two: Intend.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alrighty, my darling friends.
Welcome back.
Let's begin in a nice,
comfortable seat.
As you're ready, 
sit up nice and tall
and right away,
tuck the chin,
lengthen through 
the back of the neck
and begin to notice your breath.
Settle in.
If you're comfortable,
close your eyes,
or maybe soften your gaze
gently down past your nose.
Relax your shoulders.
And as you're ready, 
slowly bring the hands together,
Anjuli Mudra.
This prayer position, 
if you will, of the heart.
Today's session is an 
important one, in my opinion.
Because it helps us
cultivate and create 
meaning behind the movement.
I also really 
love giving intention
or the invitation to intend
it's own day because to me,
it's so important
in helping us 
remember and recognize
that we have the 
power to cultivate
and amplify the things 
that we want to see through,
the things we want 
to see to fruition.
So take a deep breath in here,
and as you exhale, 
just drop your hands
a little bit down in front of
your figurative heart space
as you bow your head down.
And it's in this shape 
that at the very least,
you start to get a 
really awesome stretch
in the back of the neck.
But there's also 
an opportunity here
to really see if you can
set an intention.
Something positive 
that will serve you
in this process.
Is there something 
you want to cultivate?
Continue to 
gently deepen the breath
as you ask 
yourself this question.
What do you want to cultivate?
What do you want to amplify?
What would you 
like to see through?
Begin to 
elongate your inhalations
and extend your exhalation.
What you intend can be simple.
But what you 
intend is always potent.
For our thoughts 
and words matter.
They help shape our reality.
A couple more breaths here
to just see what you land on.
Trust that whatever comes up
is good.
Perhaps it's 
simply I choose to be
the best version of myself.
Sweet.
Then take a deep breath in.
As you exhale, confirm it,
consider it already done,
already so.
And then slowly 
bat the eyelashes open.
Lift your head up, 
stack up through the spine,
lift through the 
crown of the head,
fingertips come to your sides.
Here we go, press 
the left palm down,
inhale, reach the right 
fingertips up and overhead.
See if you can keep 
your intention with you
as you move 
through this practice,
whatever that means to you.
Alright, pull the 
right thumb back,
maybe gaze up towards the sky,
smell your armpit,
and then slowly 
come back to center
and switch to the other side.
Right hand down, 
inhale, left arm up.
Big side body stretch here.
I love this idea of really
focusing on intention,
because it definitely changes
the quality of your practice.
It influences the way you move.
Come back to center.
We're gonna bring 
the palms together,
Anjuli Mudra, and then 
take the fingertips down here.
Fingertips down, elbows wide.
See if you can lift 
up through the chest,
you might have 
begun to collapse here.
Totally normal, we're 
slowly building muscles
to support the 
spinal column here
in the seated position.
You've got this, for three,
two, on the one, 
draw the fingertips up,
interlace the fingers 
then press the palms forward,
then continue the 
journey all the way up.
Press your palms all 
the way up towards the sky,
big breath, big stretch 
as you lift your heart
and exhale to break free.
Wiggle the fingertips,
rain it down.
Beautiful, come forward onto
all fours, Tabletop Position.
Find your foundation 
and when you're ready,
dropping the belly,
opening the chest,
taking a big sip of air in.
Exhale, rounding 
through the spine,
chin to chest, 
really emptying it out.
Inhale, drop the belly,
open the chest.
And exhale, round through.
Now you are gonna take it away.
You're gonna take the reins
and begin to move 
through this Cat-Cow.
And if you'd like,
as you're ready,
you can already start to
veer off the railroad tracks
when it feels right,
so that means using the 
structure as a starting point
and then 
following your intention
using this idea of recognizing
and responding to 
influence your movement.
Checking your body.
Excellent, then bring it
back to a nice neutral spine.
Take a deep breath 
in and as you exhale,
drop the elbows 
where the hands are.
Puppy Posture, 
walk the knees back.
Heart-to-earth Pose.
Tailbone up towards the sky,
elbows really stay in line 
with the shoulder, remember,
as we melt the heart 
down towards the earth,
big shoulder opener here.
Claw through the fingertips,
take a deep breath in.
As you exhale, 
melt your heart down.
One more cycle of breath here.
Exhale.
Beautiful, from here, 
press into the tops of the feet,
carve a line with the nose
as you dig into the elbows,
you're gonna slide all 
the way through to your belly.
So nice and slow.
Beautiful, 
press into the elbows,
again, they're right 
underneath the shoulders here.
Hips come to the earth,
we press into the 
tops of the feet firmly,
as we start to open 
up through the chest.
Keep the back of the 
neck nice and long here.
So careful not to clench.
Tuck the chin, 
lengthen, Sphinx Pose.
Breathe deep here,
breathe into all 
four sides of your torso.
Really fill the lungs with air.
Excellent.
Then carve a 
line with your nose,
past your right shoulder.
And then back through center,
breathe, breathe, breathe,
and over past 
your left shoulder,
dig into your right elbow.
Good, bring it back to center.
Here we go, guys.
A little bit of core every day,
we got this.
Remember your 
intention is you breathe in,
exhale, curl the toes under,
hug the low ribs 
up and into start,
then keep that journey
as you lift the 
navel, up, up, up.
Reach the heels back, 
now we're in Forearm Plank.
You got this.
Gaze straight down.
Breathe deep here, 
you're here for five,
press away from your yoga mat.
Four,
three, you got this,
two and one.
Beautiful, slowly bring 
the knees back to the earth.
Lift back up onto the palms,
Tabletop Position.
Awesome work.
Inhale in.
Exhale, breathe out.
Good, curl the toes under,
walk the hands out,
inhale in again.
And exhale to lift up and back,

Inhale in deeply here.
Exhale out through 
the nose or mouth here
as you find soft, easy 
movement that feels good.
Excellent, bend the knees,
inhale to look forward.
Exhale to step 
or hop to the top.
Take your time.
Feet hip width apart or 
flush together, your choice.
Take a second here.
Standing Forward Fold.
A nice moment to just 
calm the nervous system.
Let go of the day thus far.
Invite yourself into
whatever's going on now,
into the present moment.
Your present state of being.
Great, then 
ground through the feet,
bend your knees a little more,
you've got this, tuck the chin
and slowly roll it up,
stacking through the spine.
Mountain Pose, 
stand up nice and tall.
Right away, big inhale 
to reach the fingertips
all the way up, big stretch.
Exhale, palms kiss together
and we're gonna slice 
right down the midline,
Forward Fold all 
the way back down.
Good, inhale,
find that flat back position,
your version.
Lengthen through the neck,
pull the shoulders back,
away from the ears,
and exhale to soften and fold.
From here, bend the knees,
plant your palms,
step one foot back first,
then the other.
Right away here, 
listen to your body.
Recognize, stay 
true to your intention.
Keep the knees 
lifted or lower them
for a little bit 
of Half Plank here.
We want to create a nice, strong
line of awareness 
from the crown to the tail.
We want to make 
sure the breath is full.
We're here for three,
two, slowly, on the one, hug
the elbows into the side body.
Lower all the way down 
to the belly with control.
Then squeeze the elbows in,

reach up towards the sky here
as you generously 
bend your knees.
Good, then drop 
the heels to the earth.
They don't have to touch.
They don't even 
have to come close.
Straighten through the legs,
drop the heels,
just let them become heavy.
And on your next breath in,
inhale with the right leg up
high, Three-Legged Dog, whoa.
Inhale in again here,
big breath.
Use your exhale to 
bend your right knee,
shift it forward, 
step it all the way up
into a nice low lunge.
Lower the back knee, 
just like we did yesterday.
Front knee over front ankle,
and just take a second here.
Find your breath.
Good, inhale to open the chest,
look forward.
Exhale to peel the 
right hip crease back,

so it sits up towards the sky.
Good, then straighten the
legs, let the heels get heavy.
Nice, inhale, slide your left
leg up an imaginary wall.
Three-Legged Dog.
Alright, take one more deep
breath in here, you got this.
On your exhale, use the exhale
to draw your navel up and in,
find your core,
step that left 
foot all the way up.
And if it doesn't 
make it at any time,
you could always 
just guide it up there.
It's all good, be kind.
Lower the right 
knee to the earth.
Front knee over front ankle,
that one is important.
Inhale, open the chest,
look forward.
Big stretch here in the hips.
And then exhale,
peel the left hip crease back,
flex your left 
toes towards your face,
slight bend in that left knee.
Good, then rolling 
through the left foot.
Come all the way back through.
Option here to keep the 
right knee on the ground
or power it up, lift it up,

Good, and then soften and fold
everything back in and down.
Root to rise here,
soft bend in the knees.
Here we go, inhale, 
big stretch all the way up
towards the sky, heart lifts.
Maybe you take 
your gaze all the way up.
And then exhale, 
capture something,
bring it back 
down to your heart.
Relax your shoulders,
observe your breath.
So it might seem 
a little bit foreign
or even a bit cheesy
to (laughs) keep 
reminding yourself
to come back to your intention.
But the more we kind of practice
why we're taking a whole day to
really study this idea,
the more we practice 
moving with intention,
a thoughtfulness,
the more likely we're 
gonna have these tools
when we need 
them the most, right?
On the mat, in a hard posture,
or on a day that we 
didn't really want to show up,
or off the mat.
Maybe you become angry or upset.
Do we have the 
practice under our belt
to be thoughtful?
To pay attention and recognize
that our thoughts and words
are important and our intentions
can cultivate or amplify
the things we want to manifest.
This versus just being in a
reactive state all the time.
Find a soft 
bend in your knees,
go ahead and drop the 
fingertips down to come up.
Here we go, inhale,
catch a wave,
reach for the sky, 
big breath, big stretch.
Exhale, palms kiss together,
we slice it right down 
the middle, Forward Fold.
Excellent, inhale, halfway lift,
your version, find length,
working to create a 
healthy flow of energy
that runs up and down the spine.
And then exhale, Forward Fold.
Excellent, plant the palms,
step or hop it back,
Plank Pose.
Inhale, then look forward,
shift forward,
squeeze the elbows in,
this time Belly to Cobra,
or maybe Chaturanga is 
in your practice already.
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
You do your version.
Find a heart 
opener as you breathe in.
And then use your exhale
to make your way back 
to Downward Facing Dog.
Good, in Downward Dog, let's
take a big breath in together.
Here we go, inhale, 
in through the nose.
Exhale out through the mouth.
Beautiful, inhale, 
lift your right leg up high,
Three-Legged Dog.
Exhale, step it forward,
all the way, nice, low lunge.
Lower the back knee.
Here we go, taking 
the arms all the way up
towards the sky this time.
Inhale, lift it up, big 
beach ball up and overhead.
Back toes can be 
curled or uncurled,
but you're gonna want a lot of
attention in that back foot.
Great, inhale in here,
just check it out.
Then exhale, rain it down.
Beautiful.
Curl your left toes under,
lift your back knee.
Step the right foot back,
Plank or Half Plank.
You're gonna go 
right to Downward Dog here,
hips up high and back.
Good, inhale in here.
Nice cleansing breath.
Exhale, empty it out.
Inhale, lift the 
left leg up high.
You're doing great.
Exhale, shift it all 
the way forward, step it up.
Lower the back knee, 
Crescent Lunge, here we go.
Nice and easy, 
just checking it out.
Inhale, sweep the arms up 
and overhead, big stretch,
big breath.
Good, lots of 
awareness in that back foot.
When you're ready, rain it down.
From here, lift the back knee,
plant the palms, step it back,
final Plank here.
We're getting strong.
Try to knit your low belly
and your upper abdominals 
in towards the center.
So this is lifting 
up through the navel.
You're here for three,
You're here for two,
you're awesome, one.
Slowly lower the 
knees to the ground.
Bring them as 
wide as your yoga mat.
Bring the big toes to touch,
send your hips back.
And yay, our first official
Extended Child's Pose together.
Forehead comes down.
You decide what 
feels best here on Day 2.
Active arms, 
reaching the fingertips
towards the 
front edge of your mat,
or maybe a bit of a surrender.
Can also take 
the palms together,
walk the elbows in just a bit,
and take the palms just up
and over the back of the neck.
We call this Namaste Shark Fin.
I don't know if 
that's your thing or not, but
it's my thing. (laughs)
Take a deep breath in.
Try to relax anything
that might be catching.
So this could be 
a physical gesture
or maybe you've 
been carrying around
some weight.
Maybe we can use this 
process here together to
choose to let go of 
some of that weight,
some of that stuff 
you've been carrying around
so that we can 
consciously make space
for the things 
we want to manifest,
for the things we intend 
to cultivate and amplify.
Inhale in deeply.
Exhale completely as 
you release the palms
back to the earth
if they're lifted.
Begin to rise back up,
carving a little 
line with the nose.
Again, this is the kitty cat
like pushing a ball of yarn.
Integrating the neck, 
we're gonna come back up,
walk the knees 
underneath the hips,
swing the feet to one side, 
any side, side saddle,
and you're gonna 
come all the way through
to lie on the back here.
When you get there,
go ahead and hug your 
knees into your chest.
Give yourself a big hug
and create some space
between the vertebrae 
by lifting the tailbone
all the way up towards the sky,
really lifting, 
lifting, lifting,
and then if it's 
okay in your body,
please experiment 
with bringing the nose
up towards the ceiling
and then towards your knee.
So they don't 
have to come close,
but it's just the intention
again, creating some space 
between the vertebrae here.
Try to keep your 
shoulders relaxed.
Tailbone's lifting.
Nose is lifting up
and then in towards the knees.
Deep breath in.
Long breath out.
Deep breath in, long breath out.
Beautiful.
Slowly lower back to the earth,
let your feet 
kiss the mat softly.
Heels up towards 
the sits bones here,
palms kiss the mat.
Alrighty, so today, 
after you find your foundation
of your hands and feet,
see if you can actively 
snuggle your shoulder blades
in and underneath 
your heart space.
Then from here, 
with a strong foundation,
our foundation 
being that which is
touching the earth 
here physically, here we go.
We're gonna ground,
start to lift through the tail,
lift the hip points up slowly.
Shins move forward.
You can imagine kind of 
squeezing an imaginary block.
That was redundant,
but it still works.
Imagine squeezing 
an imaginary block
between your inner thighs.
Keep your gaze up,
then chest lifts 
towards the chin,
allowing the hips to 
maybe rise a little higher
and then chin 
up towards the sky,
create a little space
for that throat chakra, 
perfect for today's theme.
Now breathe into all 
four sides of the torso.
You're doing great.
And if you want, you can 
interlace the fingertips now
underneath, maybe the 
walking the shoulder blades
a little bit 
more closer together.
Shins forward, hips up high.
Take one more 
full breath in here.
And then exhale, 
start with the fingertips,
releasing the bind,
resist the urge to 
just drop down here.
Take it nice and slow.
Working with intention,
this quality of movement
that is controlled.
Great, hips land nice and easy.
We'll walk the feet together,
open the knees wide.
Interlace the fingertips,
bring your hands 
now behind your head,
elbows wide so that 
the arms and the legs
are mirroring each other.
Extend the elbows, excuse me,
yeah, extend the 
elbows out left to right.
Extend your thumbs.
Give yourself a little massage
here on the back of the neck.
Soften through your belly,
close your eyes.
A little massage moment here.
Yes.
Good, then inhale in.
On the exhale, lift your head,
your neck, your shoulders.
You're gonna slowly 
look between the legs,
engaging your abdominal 
wall here but not crunching.
So keep a little space,
as if you were 
holding like a lemon
between your chin and 
your chest, a big lemon.
Nice and easy.
Should feel the 
abdominal wall turn on here.
And then keep lifted.
See if you can lift 
your shoulders a little more.
Release the bind,
fingertips are gonna reach
towards the 
front edge of the mat.
Beautiful.
Thumbs up, pinkies down,
reaching, reaching, reaching.
See if you can reach a little
higher, a little further.
Reach, reach, reach.
For three,
two,
little higher,
and release on the one.
Awesome, bring your fingertips
to the outer edges of the legs.
Kiss the knees together.
Hug the knees up into 
the chest one more time.
Inhale in here.
Exhale, you're gonna 
take the soles of the feet now
to the earth, but walk 
them as wide as your mat.
Allow the knees to 
kiss together and touch.
We're gonna end in this 
constructive rest posture,
so now the hip socket
is getting nice and snuggly.
We're finding this 
internal rotation here.
Bring your left 
hand to your heart,
right hand to your belly.
Inhale lots of love in,
close your eyes 
as you sigh it out.
Day 2 of 30.
Adding the layer of intention.
Why is it important?
Find stillness.
Just allow yourself 
to be here in the moment
for one more cycle of breath.
Thank you so much for 
sharing your valuable time
and energy with me
and all of the beautiful people
practicing around the world.
Gently bring the palms together.
Thumbs up, 
towards your forehead.
Inhale in deeply.
From my home to yours
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
