(bright upbeat piano music)
Welcome, let's begin in
a nice, comfortable seat.
It's okay to have fun.
I think we're in the
home stretch of this journey
and this is the perfect time to
tap into some love. (laughs)
Said that like a Texan,
some love.
Some love.
We'll do some love
for the lower back,
love for the neck and shoulders,
love for the hips,
but really let this
practice be an invitation
or a reminder
that when you
show up for yourself,
that's an act of love.
It's a huge,
humongous,
Whitney Houston
high-note-sized (chuckles)
act of love,
and it's beautiful
and it's courageous.
I very much believe that
half the battle is showing up,
and we're here now.
So I hope you begin to
feel the love that you deserve
now and throughout
this practice and beyond.
Bring the fingertips to
the shoulders, nice and easy.
Take a deep breath in.
As you exhale,
relax the shoulders.
Feel the shoulder
blades getting heavy,
melting down the back body.
Sit up nice and tall,
lengthening through all
four sides of the torso.
Acknowledging this
lift in the front body
and this grounding 
in the back body.
And furthermore,
acknowledging just opposition,
light and darkness,
sun and moon,
masculine and feminine.
And in your own time,
we'll start to inhale,
bringing the
elbows together to kiss,
and then taking them 
all the way up, around
and back as you breathe out.
And you can just follow
the rhythm of your breath here
as we start to move
very slowly and gently.
And then reversing
it one elbow at a time.
You're gonna swim one elbow
forward and then the other.
And then you're
gonna release that
by, listen carefully, 
tossing in a way.
So do it again.
One more time, one more time
toss away that
which no longer serves.
And then we're gonna come
to lie flat on our backs.
Nice and slow.
When you get there, 
take a nice full body stretch,
breathe in.
And breathe out.
Wiggle the fingers,
wiggle the toes
rotate the ankles 
and the wrists.
Feel the earth rising
up to meet your back body
close your eyes and
just notice what it feels
like for your mat to
kind of have your back here.
I know that
sounds a little cheesy
but truly this is
a sacred space that
we've been cultivating here.
So I'm inviting you
to acknowledge that.
Feel held by that, in that.
Bring the arms down.
We're gonna hug the
knees into the chest.
Take a deep breath in.
And then deep
breath out to lower
just the left
foot to the ground,
left knee stays bent.
Then we're gonna take
the right leg all the way up
and cross it over the
top of the left thigh.
So right ankle to the
top of the left thigh.
Then we'll lift up
off the left foot,
thread the needle here,
we've been here before.
Nice and easy.
No need to squeeze too hard.
Just let it all
kind of unravel here
as you deepen
your breath gently.
Maybe you rock a
little side to side.
With some energy
in the feet here,
imagine you're pressing
your left foot into a wall
as you gently draw your legs
up towards your
heart or your chest.
Now, on an inhale,
extend the left leg
up towards the sky,
point your left toes.
And then slowly release, 
everything unravel.
We'll bring it back down.
Hug both knees into the chest.
Breathe in.
Right foot comes to the ground
as you breathe out.
Inhale, send the left
leg up towards the sky.
Exhale, cross it over
the top of the right thigh.
When you're ready,
lift the legs,
thread the needle, and
maybe soft easy movement here.
Breathing deep.
Then inhale, extend the
right leg all the way up.
Point the toes, 
point, point, point.
And then exhale, unravel,
bring it all back down.
Hug the knees back in.
This time, palms
to the knee caps
then send the knees out,
open the knees wide.
Then bring them in
towards the chest.
Nice and slow here to start out.
Straighten the arms
around,
in,
and then continuing in your
own rhythm with your breath.
I encourage you
to move slow here,
at least to start
to really feel the sensation
in the hip socket,
and that connection
to the lower body.
Alright now, bring the
knees together, really together.
Slide the hands to
the backs of the thighs.
Try to move from center,
from this place of connect.
As we lift our heart up,
hi Benji,
and then rock it back.
Give it a try.
Lifting it up.
And back.
And if you don't make it,
you're not alone.
And you can use your elbows,
your hands to help lift you up.
I feel like this
is a great moment
for our humility practice too,
but we're rocking up and
down the length of the spine,
your version.
Getting a little massage
and then the next
time you rock up,
you'll cross the
right ankle over the left.
Come through to all fours.
Walk the knees back,
back the truck up,
so you're nice and
centered on your mat.
Wonderful. From here, 
we're gonna inhale.
Kick just the right leg out.
Kick it out.
Exhale, bring it all the way up
and into your nice low lunge.
Walk the left knee back,
walk it back.
And then here we go.
Left hand comes to the earth.
Inhale, right fingertips
all the way up towards the sky.
Exhale, send the right
fingertips all the way back
and then around and down.
Pull the right hip crease back,
flex your right toes 
towards your face.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale, roll through 
that right foot.
Left hand comes to the mat,
right hand comes
over to meet the left.
We're here in a nice low Lizard.
Back knee stays
on the ground here.
(Benji groans)
(Adriene chuckles)
Breathing deep.
Good, walk your right hand back.
Walk your right
foot into center.
So you're
framing your right foot.
Curl the back toes under 
and here we go, Plank Pose.
Lift your heart
up towards the sky,
heart center up towards the sky.
So upper back has
this nice doming position.
Inhale in, exhale,
lower all the way to the belly.
Inhale, Cobra.
Exhale to release.
Curl the toes under,
press it back up to all fours.
Beautiful.
Here we go.
Inhale, kick the left leg out.
Exhale, guide it all the way up.
Take your time.
Remember you can use
your hands to guide it up.
Stay connected to center.
Nice and easy,
right hand to the earth.
Inhale left fingertips 
up towards the sky.
So don't let that
left knee splay out here.
Left knee over left ankle.
Good. Now on an exhale,
guide the left
fingertips all the way back
towards the back edge of the mat
and then all the way back down.
Beautiful. Pull the 
left hip crease back.
Left toes flex
towards the face here.
Inhale, look forward.
Exhale, make your way
back to the nice low lunge.
Go ahead and walk
that right knee back
if you haven't already.
Just get a little deeper stretch.
And then take the left hand,
bring it over to meet the right.
we're breathing here.
We're pressing down through
the front of that right foot.
Good, inhale to look forward.
Exhale, bring it back,
framing the left
foot with the hands.
Curl the right toes under,
lift the back knee.
Here we go.
Step it back nice and strong,
Inhale in deeply here.
Exhale, belly to Cobra or 
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Inhale to open your heart.
And exhale to send it back,
Extended Child's Pose.
So you walk the knees back,
hips back towards the heels,
heart melts to the earth.
Take any variation you like
in the fingers and the arms,
maybe soft fingers,
or palms together, Namaste.
Maybe you keep nice active arms
if you have good
amount of energy today.
Inhale, lots of love in.
And exhale, lots of love out.
Inhale to lift the heart,
the head, chest back up.
Walk the knees
underneath the hip points.
Good, ground down here.
On an exhale, draw your navel up
so you have that strong
connection to your core.
On your next breath,
kick the right leg out.
Inhale.
Exhale, strong
connection to the core.
Next breath, 
left fingertips reach out.
And exhale, 
we're gonna reach behind.
Left hand reaches out
to grab the right toes.
We press into the earth
as we work to kick
the right toes back.
If this is not working for you,
you're gonna pulse
just the right leg.
Pulsing, pulsing, pulsing here.
So we're here pulsing
with both hands on the ground,
or we're working
in a little bow.
Breathing deep.
Lots of awareness in
the neck and shoulders.
Draw those shoulders 
away from the ears.
And then slowly
release wherever you are.
Let's all come
back to all fours.
Second side.
Inhale, extend the left leg out.
Dial the left toes down.
Find your core
connection on that exhale.
Inhale, reach the
right fingertips forward.
Exhale, bend the left knee.
Bend the right elbow.
Reach behind.
Grab the top of the foot.
Kick out. If we're not
doing the bind today,
both hands are on the
ground and we're pulsing here.
Pulsing, pulsing, pulsing.
Breathing deep,
everyone trying to breed.
Breathe, breed, whoa.
Freudian slip.
Just kidding, breathe wide,
so nice lateral breath.
Feel the rib cage expand.
Front body, 
side body, back body.
(laughs) Then slowly release.
Nice and steady.
Gorgeous. Walk the 
hands out in front.
Curl the toes under,
send the hips up and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale, lots of love in here.
And exhale lots of love out.
Again, lots of
love in, big breath.
Lots of love out.
It's okay if that
love for yourself
isn't already all there.
We're here to cultivate that.
We're here to uncover it,
to nurture it.
So you're doing great.
Inhale, lift the right leg high.
Exhale, step it all the way up.
Lower the back knee.
Again, inhale, right fingertips 
up towards the sky.
Option, right hand comes behind
and to the small of the back,
or it comes behind,
we bend the left knee
and we reach for the
top of the left foot.
So we're here,
or we're here.
And we're all opening
up through the chest here.
Breathing deep, obviously big
opening in the left side, quad,
left hip crease,
core connection is here.
Opening up through
the chest, lifting.
And then slowly releasing
whether you have the hand on
the low back or on the foot,
let's bring it all the way back.
We're gonna slowly drag the
right foot back to all fours,
curl the toes under,
send the hips up high and back.
Now I cannot believe
it's taken me this long
to share this with
you on this journey.
But we pick the
love day because this
is one of my most
favorite breath techniques.
The one I love the most,
it's called horsey lips.
It's very intelligent
astute technique.
You inhale in through the nose.
When you exhale out
through the lips like so.
(horse snorting)
Give it a try, inhale.
And exhale.
(horse snorting)
Good inhale, 
lift the left leg up high.
Slowly, exhale,
bring it all the way up.
Lower the right knee down.
Inhale, reach
left fingertips up.
So left knee squeezes in
and we have options here.
We can bring the left
hand to the low back,
or we can bend that right knee.
Reach behind.
Grab the top of the left toes
and play here.
Everyone, lift your chest.
Breathe wide.
Inhale, lots of love in.
And exhale lots of love out.
Take one more
cycle of breath here.
Think about spiraling
your heart up towards the sky.
Or imagine that honey on
the rib cage that we had
before spiraling
your chest up, up, up.
Then slow and with control,
slowly bring it
back to your lunge.
We're gonna plant both palms,
both knees come back,
all fours here.
Now from here, walk the
knees together, really together.
Then shift your weight
forward to this half push-up
that we've been in before.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale, slowly lower down
all the way to the belly.
Lower the tops of
the feet to the ground,
fingertips and palms
drag back just a bit
in line with the rib cage
as you squeeze the elbows in,
just refining a little,
and inhale, Cobra.
Exhale, soften and release.
Beautiful.
Slowly, press
back up to all fours.
Curl the toes under
and Downward Facing Dog.
Let's do it again.
Big inhale in through the nose.
And release little horsey
lips out through the mouth.
(horse snorting)
Inhale in.
Horsey lips on our love day.
(horse snorting)
One more time.
(horse snorting)
Good, slowly lower to the knees.
Swing the legs to one side.
Then bring the soles
of the feet together.
You can sit up on your
blanket here if you like,
Cobbler's Pose.
So every day is love day.
It's just so great
to remember to have fun
and that while it is
challenging to 
show up for yourself,
and courageous to love
yourself for who you really are,
it's not a chore.
We don't have to
see it as a chore.
That's why I call this a
journey and not a challenge.
Doesn't mean
it's not challenging.
Grab the ankles or
the toes, your choice.
You can sneak in a little
foot massage as I am doing here.
Sit up nice and tall,
deep breath in.
Exhale, begin to lean forward.
Maybe elbows bend left to right.
So actively draw the
tops of the thighs down.
Try not round
through the spine here,
but keep a nice
beautiful line of integrity
from the crown through the neck
all the way down
the torso to the tail.
And then here you are,
back at that pond looking down,
your reflection.
Delighted
by your own beauty.
Take a deep breath in here.
And then exhale,
draw the chin to 
the chest and roll it up.
Recognizing your beauty,
investing in a
relationship of loving yourself
truly and deeply and sincerely
so that you can love others
in that way and see
others for who they truly are.
Let's bring the hands to
the outer edges of the legs.
Let's bring the knees together.
Now send the legs out in front.
You can stay on
top of your blanket.
Benji reveal.
Ta-da.
Paschimottanasana.
We're gonna flex the feet.
Heels are gonna be in
line with the hip points.
So a little bit of space.
Inhale, reach for the sky,
sit up nice and tall.
Dandasana, we have this long,
beautiful line of integrity
from crown to tail.
And then bend your
knees if you need to.
We're gonna 
slowly shift forward.
Heart stays open towards
the front as long as possible.
Maybe we reached the shins,
the ankles, the toes,
the outer edges of the feet.
Take a deep breath in here.
Find a little more extension,
just play and then exhale,
round it through.
And you can bend the knees again
as generously as you like here.
Now, close your eyes.
As you breathe in,
feel the skin of
the back stretch.
And as you breathe out,
feel it soften.
Relax the weight of the head.
An intimate moment with
the sound of your breath.
Listen.
And then begin to slowly
roll it up, nice and slow.
Move like you love yourself.
Breathe like you love yourself.
We say it all the time in
this beautiful community.
We're gonna just, 
nice and easy,
take a little counter twist
to the left, nice and easy.
And to the right.
Hola Benji.
And then we're
gonna come our backs.
If you have a blanket,
you might unravel it and
wrap up like a burrito today.
Or you can bring it
underneath your head
or the legs, of course.
In an act of self love,
I'm gonna go burrito style.
Tucking myself in,
using this time in my practice
to learn how to
love myself, right?
It's like, sometimes you
feel like you need something.
You're like, "Oh babe,
do this for me."
Or, "Why isn't this happening?"
Or, "They didn't think of me,"
or when sometimes we can,
the nurturing we
seek is actually within,
the attention and the love
we seek is actually within.
Close your eyes.
Inhale, lots of love in.
Exhale, lots of love out.
Feel the earth rising
up to meet your back body
and know that your
practice has your back.
And so do I.
Thank you for
showing up here today.
Look forward to
seeing you again tomorrow.
Until then,
move like you love yourself.
Breathe like you love yourself.
Keep an open mind, stay open
to the idea that you are love.
Alright, slowly bring 
the palms together.
Palm to palm is
holy palmers' kiss.
You might even open your eyes
and look at your
beautiful hands today.
Let's do it.
Look at the backs of the hands.
Look at the palms.
And kiss them back together.
Thumbs to third eye.
Inhale lots of love in.
Thanks for hanging with me.
Exhale lots of love out.
Namaste.
(bright upbeat piano music)
