- Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 18, believe.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alright, let's begin 
today's practice on our backs.
Yes.
Take your time getting there.
Right away,
bend your knees,
bring your feet to the ground.
Come into our 
constructive rest pose.
So you can walk the 
feet as wide as the mat
so you don't have 
to hold your legs up.
And right away let's bring
the hands to the belly and just
chill out for a second.
So we're gonna move 
in today's practice.
Adding another 
layer of vocabulary,
but I'd like to invite you to
just take a second to see how
fast you can surrender.
Lately I've been calling 
this a flash of surrender.
How fast can you let go?
And this practice has 
been immensely helpful
for me in my recent journey
and I've been
implementing it into my home
practice and even 
post run recoveries.
So whatever's going 
on with you today just,
ah, arrive.
See how fast you can chill out.
And if you can't,
that's all right.
That's great 
information as well.
A flash of surrender.
Can you start to 
relax everything?
Close your eyes.
Really land here in the moment.
Honoring this time.
Maybe you take a 
deep breath in here.
And allow it to be a breath 
of gratitude first for yourself
for showing up, for really 
believing in yourself and
believing that this 
time could be valuable.
On your exhalation,
just allow the weight of the
body to relax here for a second.
Taking just but a moment to
really empty your cup here.
Chill out, surrender.
'Cause then you know,
we're gonna fill it.
So just take a couple 
breaths here on your own.
Mmmmm.
And then when you're read,
continue to gently deepen the
breath and we're gonna 
start to rock the head gently
side to side, ear to ear.
Getting that gentle 
massage in the back of the head.
Welcoming a gentle, passive-ish
stretch to the neck and even the
trap as you rock 
gently back and forth.
And then just notice your tempo.
Notice your tempo.
Cool, bring the 
head back to center.
We'll let the knees part, we're
gonna walk the feet now in line
with the hips, 
toes pointing forward.
So just keep 
noticing your patterns,
especially with the toes,
it's just a fun little,
I think, experiment, 
a little indicator of pattern.
No right or wrong, no judgment
of whatever it is
you're noticing.
Just notice your pattern.
See if you can bring 
your toes to point forward,
heels crawl up 
towards the sits bones.
Great, then 
interlace the fingers,
bring them behind the head,
elbows wide.
Extend your thumbs so you have
this nice little neck hammock.
Give yourself a little massage.
Yes.
Start to breathe a little deeper
using this shape to inspire
more depth of breath.
Whatever that means to you.
Really breathing 
maybe into the rib cage.
Feeling it expand.
And then just take a second to
notice the quality of air in the
room or whatever environment
you are playing in today.
Maybe take a second 
to notice the light.
The quality of light.
Just expanding our awareness.
And see if you can trust or
believe that wherever you are
today, maybe you're like
squeezing in this practice like
early or super late because
you didn't want to miss Day 18.
What if you could trust and
believe that everything
is as it should be?
You're exactly where 
you're supposed to be,
exactly the 
right time practicing,
what if that were true?
Just a little food for thought.
Okay, we're going to give 
a gentle pull on the back
of the neck, just 
creating a little gentle,
gentle, gentle, gentle traction.
Chin tucks into the chest,
elbows get nice and wide.
Inhale in, 
keep that gentle pull,
just that gentle traction.
As you exhale, 
lift the head, the neck,
the shoulders, 
the elbows up high.
Start to engage your 
abdominal wall and pause here.
Low belly and upper 
abdominal, abdominals.
(laughs) Articulate, Adriene,
are coming in to do a little
kiss in the center.
And we're here for three, two.
Look up towards the 
third eye and back on the one.
Good, and then 
slowly lower down.
Here we go, big inhale.
Exhale to lift.
Again, we're not 
crunching here in the neck.
We're keeping 
neck nice and long.
So you can imagine you're
holding like a juicy piece of
fruit between your 
chin and your chest.
Keep the thumbs extended to
cradle the neck if you're still
working on building 
strength here.
You shouldn't have 
any pain in the neck.
Not here, not I.
Gaze up and then back.
Nice long neck for three,
squeeze and lift 
a little higher for two.
Squeeze and lift a little higher
and then slowly 
lower on the one.
Alright, now let's 
synchronize with the breath.
Inhale in.
Sharp exhale to lift.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Lower back these flush 
with the mat the whole time.
Inhale to lower.
Sharp exhale to lift.
Inhale to lower.
Sharp exhale to lift, squeeze.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale, lift a little higher.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Last one, hang with me.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift, hold.
Reach your right 
fingertips forward.
Palms face up.
Left fingertips forward,
palms face up.
Great.
Then bring your thumbs,
you're gonna slowly 
draw a line all the way out.
Then all the way in.
Look up and back as you take the
thumbs all the way out in line
with the shoulders.
And all the way in.
And one more time you got this.
Soften your jaw.
Excellent, hands are gonna
come behind the thighs here.
Go ahead and lift the feet,
lift the toes,
hug the knees into the chest,
nose towards the knees.
Keep lifted here for three.
Squeeze and lift, two.
And on the one, slowly 
release the head back down,
it kisses for a moment,
flash of surrender, (sighs).
And then we're 
gonna rock and roll
up and down the 
length of the spine.
You know your body best 
so if this is not right for you
just make it 
a little adjustment.
And we're gonna come 
to meet all the way up
in a nice cross legged seat.
Sit up nice and tall.
Head over heart, 
heart over pelvis.
Close your eyes here.
Take a deep breath in.
Use your exhale to 
drop the shoulders down.
Again, inhale to 
sit up a little taller.
And exhale to 
relax the shoulders down.
And one more time, listen
to the sound of your breath.
Big inhale.
Long exhale.
Cool.
Come forward on to all fours.
Nice and easy and make your
way to Downward Facing Dog.
Make sure to spread the 
fingertips nice and wide.
Take a second here 
to find what feels good.
Maybe play with the length of
your stance today how long or
how short your dog could be.
Alright, ground 
through the fingertips,
ground through the knuckles.
Take a second 
here to find stillness.
Inhale in deeply.
And exhale completely.
Awesome.
Bend the knees.
On your next inhale,
carve a line with 
the nose to look forward.
On the exhale, make 
your way to the top.
You can step up ragdoll.
You can do the 
baby steps, slow crawl.
We'll meet in a Forward Fold
standing at the top of the mat.
Take a second here.
Ground through the feet.
If you came on to the mat
with any stress or any tension,
let's take a second here to
breathe deep in through the nose
and maybe out through the mouth.
Letting some of that go,
just maybe.
Then bend your knees generously,
tuck your chin and slowly begin
to roll up, Mountain Pose.
Stack up through the spine.
Lift your heart.
Inhale in.
Take a variation of the shape
that feels really good today,
whatever that means to you.
And then slowly shift 
your weight to your left foot.
Peel your right heel up,
just the right heel.
Just take a second here to find
that connection to your center,
to your midline.
Then you can keep the right toes
on the ground or we can test
that relationship, 
that connection to center,
the Sushumna, the midline 
by lifting the right knee up.
Just standing 
One-Legged Tadasana here.
You can flex the 
right foot if you like here,
right knee lifting up.
Beautiful.
Again, we can keep the 
right big toes on the ground.
We're just testing 
this connection to center,
not trying to prove anything.
We're here for three,
two, breathe deep.
Good, on the one, 
release and switch.
So find that gentle lift 
up from the pelvic floor.
Find that connection of 
center drawing in and up.
Lift your heart 
and when you're ready,
start with just the left heel.
So you can really feel that 
energy, that awareness spreading
through all four 
corners of the right foot.
We're lifting, lifting, lifting.
We're finding that that inner
work, that connection.
So if this pace feels
a little slow for you, good.
It's on purpose.
This isn't just like, oh,
for those who are 
working on balance.
This is for everyone,
wink, wink, I love you.
So just play here.
And really trying to find this
kind of like inner intrinsic
work so that really we can find
a different type of ease when we
start to balance, right, on the
arms and legs in different ways.
So it's about your 
relationship to center.
You can lift your left knee
up now if you haven't already,
flex that left foot.
And just see, are we kind of
leaning all the way into that
right foot or can 
we find that lift,
that ground, that push and pull,
that little dance of opposition?
Even here, breathing deep,
imagining that left's hip socket
going down, down, down.
Great, standing 
One-Legged Tadasana,
take one more 
deep breath in, inhale.
And then exhale slowly lower.
Right away, 
here we go, let's go.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Enjoy.
Exhale, enjoy this 
move all the way down.
Forward Fold.
Good, inhale halfway lift.
Bringin' it back.
Exhale, soften and fold.
Awesome work.
Bend the knees, 
plant your palms,
step one foot back,
then the other.
Here we go.
Return to Plank.
Return to Plank.
Not quite.
Shift your weight forward.
Gaze forward on the toes.
Soft bend in the elbows.
Squeeze and lift. Here we go.
Slow and with control lower
all the way down to the belly.
Inhale, Cobra.
Let it be small.
Exhale, soften and fold.
Your choice, curl the 
under press up to all fours
or press up to Plank.
Here we go.
Nice and strong.
Inhale in deeply.
Exhale, send the 
hips up and back
or peel the hips up and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
On your next inhale, 
lift the right leg up high.
Here's our Three-Legged Dog 
or Down Dog splits.
Claw through the fingertips,
take a deep breath in.
Exhale, bend your right knee,
shift it forward.
Come all the way through,
squeezing your right 
knee up to your heart.
Then send it back out, 
inhale, Three-Legged Dog.
Exhale, shift it forward.
Right knee kisses right elbow.
Gaze straight down.
Remember upper body's in Plank.
Inhale, Three-Legged Dog.
Last one don't rush it,
nice and slow.
Right knee kisses left elbow.
Gaze straight down, 
upper body's in Plank.
Good, inhale, kick it up.
Now exhale, step it 
all the way up and through.
Back knee stays lifted 
unless you like to lower it.
We know that's 
an available option.
Squeeze the inner 
thighs in the midline,
sweep the arms 
forward, up and back.
Nice high lunge here.
Bend that front knee.
Soft bend in that back knee to
get your center underneath you.
Find that loop of energy.
Lifting through the front body.
Grounding through the back body.
You got this.
Inhale in, maybe you look up.
Exhale, nice and slow,
come all the way down.
Plant the left palm.
Inhale, right fingertips 
up towards the sky.
Big breath, big stretch 
here for your twist.
Then exhale, right hand 
comes to the earth.
Beautiful, we step 
the right toes back.
Belly to Cobra or now maybe
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Move with your breath.
Use your inhale 
to open your heart.
Cobra or Up Dog.
Use the exhale to transition
back to Downward Facing Dog.
Alrighty, once 
you're in Downward Dog,
go ahead and anchor through
that right heel and on your next
breath in slide 
the left leg up high.
Three-Legged Dog.
Press into both palms evenly.
Here we go.
Inhale in again, lift 
from your left inner thigh.
Lift it a little higher.
Exhale, shift it forward.
Left knee squeezes in towards
your chest, gaze down.
Anchor through the right
heel, that brings you back up,
Three-Legged Dog.
Exhale, left knee comes up and
over to kiss the left elbow.
You got this.
Inhale, rise back up.
Cross it over, nice and slow.
Careful not to rush.
Slight bend in the elbows here
as we kiss 
left knee to right elbow.
Good, inhale, 
kick it all the way up.
Nice work.
With control, step it all 
the way up into your lunge.
Remember, you can 
always use your hand to
guide that foot all the way up.
Back knee lowers 
if you like otherwise,
let's keep it lifted.
See what happens as you squeeze
the inner thighs to the midline.
Wake up through that 
center channel and here we go,
reaching the fingertips 
forward, up and back.
Front knee over front ankle.
Bend your back knee to get
your center underneath you.
Great, energy 
through the fingertips.
Use the exhale to relax 
any tension in the shoulders.
Use the inhale to 
find a lift, expansion.
Wonderful.
Inhale in.
Maybe you carve a line 
with your nose to look up.
Then exhale, 
soften it all back down.
Right hand comes to the earth.
On your next breath in,
left fingertips reach 
up towards the sky.
Wiggle the left fingertips.
Big twist here.
And then slowly exhale,
bring it all the way back down.
Plant the left palm, 
step the left toes back.
Here we go, belly to Cobra or
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Move with your breath.
Synchronize breath to movement.
Movement to breath.
We'll meet in 
Downward Facing Dog.
Take your time.
So that's the 
thing too, believe,
believe me when 
I say make it your own.
Take your time.
If you go to a public class,
don't ever let anyone rush you.
Right? Meet your 
appropriate edge but,
believe in whatever it is,
whatever feedback 
you're getting back.
Right, your intuition.
Huge part of this 
at-home yoga journey.
Bend the knees, inhale,
look forward.
Exhale, make 
your way to the top.
On your next breath in,
lift up halfway.
Nice flat back position.
Long, beautiful neck.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Let everything go.
Root to rise here.
Inhale, reach of the sky.
Big breath, big stretch.
Open your heart.
Maybe slight back bend here.
And then exhale, 
we stack it all back.
Hands come back to the heart
space and go ahead and let your
fingertips come to your sides.
And again, the best and most
beautiful Mountain Pose here,
whatever that means to you.
Just notice how you feel.
On your next breath in,
spread the fingertips.
Let's reach for the sky.
Exhale, Forward Fold.
Soft bend in the knees.
Inhale, halfway lift,
your version.
Long through the neck.
Exhale to soften 
and fold back in.

Slight bend in the elbows.
Belly to Cobra or 
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Inhale to open the chest.
Moving with your breath.
Exhale to make your way back,
Downward Facing Dog.
From Downward Dog, inhale 
lift the right leg up high.
Exhale, bend that right knee.
Squeeze it all the way up into
the chest and then we're gonna
step it forward into our lunge.
Pivot on the back foot,
Lost Warrior, what's up?
Inhale, Warrior I.
Reach the fingertips 
forward, up and back.
Head over heart, 
heart over pelvis.
We're looking 
for that sensation.
Don't worry about what 
it actually looks like.
Just working from 
the inside out here.
Making adjustments 
based on the sensation.
Great, then inhale, look up.
Exhale, bend your elbows, come
through those cactus arms and
then we're gonna interlace
the fingertips behind the back.
Yay!
Alright.
Inhale to lift the chest.
Draw the 
shoulder blades together.
Exhale, peel the 
right hip crease back,
send your gaze forward.
And just look down
into the pond, strong legs.
Good, inhale in.
Listen carefully, 
navel draws in and up.
We're gonna lift the back
heel, just step it up halfway.
You're gonna straighten 
through the front leg.
Peek at me if you need to.
We got this.
All this beautiful 
work in the spine,
this length through the Dunda,
the stick or the staff from the
crown to the tail,
hold onto it here.
Welcome a little bit of heat.
Soft bend in your right knee.
Alright, we can stay 
on the left big toe here,
sending our gaze forward,
looking into the pond,
or we can inhale in.
Exhale, just start to slowly
lift from your left inner thigh
all the way up.
Kicking left toes back,
crown reaching forward.
We have everything we need here.
Hugging the low ribs in.
Nice open chest.
That upward lift 
through the front of the spine.
That grounding 
down through the back.
Maybe the left big 
toe stays on the ground.
Maybe we work to dial the left
pinky toe down as we lift the
left inner thigh up.
Just check it 
out and if you fall,
you know we'll catch 
you here. We got it.
Take one more 
breath wherever you are.
And then exhale, 
slowly bend your right knee.
Left toes come to the ground,
plant and we come 
back to Warrior I.
Ooh, hair toss.
Inhale.
Exhale, let it all go.
Come all the way back down.
We pivot on the back foot.
Left hand comes 
to the earth again,
and we reach right 
hand toward the sky.
Big twist.
Inhale, wiggle 
the right fingertips,
open up through the chest.
Exhale, plant the palms, take it
straight to Downward Facing Dog.
Maybe a little Child's Pose 
if that suits you best
or we move through vinyasa.
Belly to Cobra or 
Chaturanga Up Dog.
Listen to your body and respond.
Then we'll meet in Downward 
Facing Dog, take your time.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Alright, from Downward Facing 
Dog here we go, second side,
then we're almost done,
stay present.
This is the good stuff.
Anchor through the right heel.
Inhale, lift the 
left leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward.
Squeeze your left 
knee in towards your heart.
Pause.
And then step it all the
way up whenever you're ready.
Pivot on the back foot.
We rise up strong.
Front knee is bent, Warrior I.
Strong back leg.
Take a second here.
Find your center.
So it used to be like 
find the hips pointing forward,
find your center and everything
else will kind of come into
alignment from there. Right?
Working with your body,
your grace.
Inhale, look all the way up.
Strong legs.
Bend your front knee.
Exhale, bend the elbows.
Come through those cactus arms.
Yes. Interlace 
the fingertips behind.
Knuckles draw down and away.
Keep your front 
knee bent for now.
Open up through the chest.
Yes.
Inhale, look up.
Exhale, think up and over.
Remember as if you have a little
beach ball or something here.
Right in the top 
of the left thigh.
Think up and over.
We're gazing into the pond here,
keeping that back foot strong.
Good. Find your center.
Then from here, front 
knee's still over from ankle.
I'm gonna slowly lift the right
heel up and then from center
I'm gonna lift it and bring 
it halfway straightening
through the front leg.
Great, pause here.
I'm not collapsed 
in to my left hip.
I'm pressing up and out of it.
Strong and steady.
Open up through the chest.
You can start to 
dial your right hip down,
keep the right toes on 
the ground if you like here.
Gaze forward.
Building lots of strength.
Or we can inhale in, exhale,
hold on to center as you begin
to lift from the 
right inner thigh.
So we really want that right
inner thigh to get some sunshine
here as you slowly lift up.
Soft bend in 
that left knee here.
And just play 
lifting, lifting, lifting.
Pressing into all four 
corners of the left foot.
Gazing down.
Nice long neck here.
Not crunched.
Shoulder blades drawing
together and down the back body.
Remember your breath.
Good, wherever you are,
take one more breath.
Remember, if you fall, 
don't you worry about a thing.
We'll catch you, that's 
why we're all here together.
And then slowly bring 
the right toes back down,
bend your front knee and let's
come back to that Warrior I.
Pivot on the back foot.
Nice work.
Inhale to reach up.
Think of this as like a rinse.
Exhale, let it all go.
Right into your twist.
Pivot on the back foot.
Right hand comes down.
Inhale left fingertips reach up.
Breathe deep.
And exhale, come 
all the way back down.
Plant the palms if you want
one more vinyasa take it here.
Last call for vinyasa.
Feel free to leave it 
and meet us in Child's Pose.
Knees together,
hips back, heart melts.
And here we go, 
a flash of surrender.
You decide what feels good here,
you can keep the fingertips
reaching forward or 
maybe drag the palms
all the way back 
towards your toes
allowing the 
shoulders to let go.
Rounding forward here.
Take three 
cycles of breath here.
Count 'em out, my love.
In and out, 
in and out, in and out.
And then 
continue to keep a nice,
soft, easy breath here.
Allowing it to return to
whatever feels like a 
natural rhythm here now,
at this point in the practice.
Feel your breath moving you.
We're wrapping up here.
So if this is not a 
comfortable shape for you,
you can come to seated.
I'd like to invite 
you to close your eyes
and just consider what it means
to wake up each day,
and have a practice where you
can believe in yourself.
This is that practice.
Thank you so 
much for showing up.
Thank you for sharing your time
and your energy with me and with
all the glorious people 
practicing with us today.
As you're ready, 
bring the hands to the earth.
And slowly tuck 
your chin to roll up.
Can stay on the knees 
here or shift to a nice,
comfortable seat of your choice.
Bring the palms together.
And then thumbs 
up to the third eye.
And we'll seal 
this one with our kiss.
Take a deep breath in.
And exhale to whisper
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
