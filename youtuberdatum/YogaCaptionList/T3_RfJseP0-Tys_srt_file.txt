- Hey everyone.
Welcome to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey.
Today is one of
my favorite days.
It's Day 18,
Center.
So hop into something
comfy and let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Alright my sweet friend,
let's begin lying down.
Hooray! Come on 
down to the ground.
Give yourself a
moment here to just land.
Don't think that I don't
know what a heroic
feat it can be 
to arrive here today.
So
wonderful job.
Let's meet by taking
a deep breath in here.
And as you exhale,
close your eyes,
allow your hands to
rest gently on the ground.
And just take a second to
relax the weight of your body
into the earth as you tune in.
Begin to notice
the sound of your breath.
And the depth of your breath.
And begin to notice
how you're feeling today.
One of the best things I've
integrated into my daily life
is taking a moment
to check in each day,
really checking
in with intention.
And sometimes
that's all it takes
to help myself feel centered,
just to honest to 
God check in. (chuckles)
Being willing and
available to notice
how you're actually feeling
each day.
And if you haven't already,
begin to gently
deepen the breath.
Maybe inviting that ocean
sound into the practice again.
And maybe playing
with how short or how long
your inhales and
exhalations can be.
Take a moment here to
extend the inhalation.
Slowing everything down
and extending the exhale.
Inviting everything
to slow down just a bit.
Slowing down,
slowing down my heart rate,
slowing down 
my movement, my steps
so that I can find a
center and begin again.
Keep this little conversation
going with your breath
and we'll start to rock
the head gently side to side.
You can keep your eyes
closed here if it feels good.
Part the lips a
little bit for this move
just to ensure
you're relaxed in the jaw.
And just notice, you know,
no harm done if
you're moving quickly
but just notice if
when I invited you
to start rocking
the head side to side,
you started with a quick pace.
See if you can
slow it down a bit.
And I do think it's a good
idea to close the eyes here
just to start 
to really tune into
this subtle body gesture.
Gently stretching the neck,
gently massaging
the back of the head.
Awesome. Then bring
the head back to center.
We're gonna point
the toes towards the front
just to stretch the tops of
the feet, point, point, point.
And notice how when you point,
you feel your quads turn on.
(clicks tongue)
Wink wink.
And then flex the feet now
pressing the heels towards
the front edge of the mat.
Toes of course now aimed up
towards the ceiling or the sky.
And again, see if
you can connect that
maybe to your hamstrings,
the backs of the thighs,
just feeling that connection.
Sweet, point the toes.
Again, feeling that
connection up through the legs
and flex, pressing the heels.
Feeling that connection
in the backs of the thighs.
Even the glutes.
Now keep the toes
pointing up towards the sky
and we're gonna inhale,
reach the fingertips 
all the way up,
and then back as
if we were standing
in Volcano or Mountain Pose
with the arms up and overhead,
of course we're reclined.
Spread the fingertips,
spread the toes.
Inhale in here, feel this
expansion in the rib cage,
just playing here.
And as you exhale, see if
you can draw the low ribs,
peek at me if you need to,
this area right here
you can even
touch the lower ribs,
draw them in turning
the abdominal wall on
as you reach back.
So we're creating this
feeling of containment
in the center of our being here.
Good, then inhale,
lift the right leg
just to see if those abs
are turned on just a little bit
like an inch or two or three.
And then release the
right leg back to the earth.
And then inhale,
lift the left leg,
again, just checking in
with the abdominal wall.
Sweet. And then slowly, release
the left leg to the ground,
bring both hands down,
palms face down on the earth.
Good, inhale in again.
Exhale, see if
you can create that
feeling, that engagement, 
in your center
by hugging the lower ribs in,
pressing the
palms into the earth.
Good, then let it all go.
Open the palms, wiggle the toes,
maybe shake the legs a little.
Alright, so maybe you
were feeling it, maybe not.
We're going to give it one
more round just to play here.
So flex the feet,
inhale, reach the fingertips
all the way up and back.
For this round,
exaggerate lifting the low back
up from the earth.
So you can really
feel the difference.
So peek at me if you
need to, I could take my hand
and put it right
underneath my low back.
There's a little
space there.
I'm creating a bridge with my
spine for my hand to go under.
So exaggerate that,
I love the image of
long puppy belly here.
I actually saw a puppy recently
and saw the puppy belly.
It was the highlight of my year.
Thank you very much.
Inhale in when
you're ready, deep breath.
Exhale, navel draws down,
we try to bring the low back
really flush with the earth.
Feel the lower ribs get heavy,
feel that containment,
that centering, that engagement
of the abdominal wall.
Lift the right heel, check in.
Feel it in that low belly,
maybe scoop the tailbone up.
Yes and then lower the
right heel lift the left heel,
again, check in.
Can you feel it?
♪ Can you feel the
love in your belly ♪
Lower the left heel,
that was the first, okay.
One more big inhale in here.
Exhale, bring everything in,
hug the knees into the chest,
wrap the around the shins
and gently rock side to side.
Crawl the shoulder
blades down towards the hips.
The image here that I love 
is like a bear scratching
its back on a tree.
I got to go to 
Yosemite last year
before the pandemic
and it was so exciting to
think about sharing space
with the bears.
Da bears.
Okay, enough.
Extend the legs out long.
We're gonna walk the
heels now towards the left side,
the bottom left
corner of your mat
and then you're going
to do a little shimmy
with the head and shoulders
to the back left
corner of the mat.
So you're creating a
beautiful crescent moon
with your bod.
Inhale, reach up, grab the
right wrist with the left hand
and then we just kind of
exaggerate this lengthening
in the right side body here.
But try to also
hug down in the center
as we've been doing, keeping
the abdominal wall, (chuckles)
sorry, a little turned on.
(chuckles)
Alright.
Deep breath in here.
As you exhale option to cross
the right ankle over the left.
A lot of people
like this gesture,
but if it's not
for you just skip it.
So obviously I'm the guide today
and I'm honored
to be your guide.
So you're not going
to hear my ocean breathe
'cause I'm talking
but I encourage
you whenever you can
to listen to your ocean breath.
And I'll try to chime in
with mine whenever I can.
Using that sound to anchor
or center the mind, busy mind,
in the present moment.
Okay unravel,
bring it back to center.
We're going to
bring the arms down
and then walk the legs
over towards the bottom right.
Shimmy the head and
the shoulders over to
the back right
corner of your mat,
already feeling it
in the left side waist.
Inhale the reach up,
exhale, grab that left wrist
with your right hand
and breathing here,
creating the sensation
of that crescent moon shape
here in the left side body.
Then layering that
connection to center
hugging the low ribs in,
it's this feeling
for me of containment.
And I love working 
with center work
rather than just
wham-bam core work
because it really does connect
us to a sense of empowerment,
right?
This chakra here of kind of like
self-confidence,
empowerment.
This willingness to
really know who you are
and embody that person fully.
Okay, cross the left
ankle over the right
if you haven't already.
I'm always
checking in to notice,
you know, how different the left
and the right side
of the body may be,
particularly in the limbs,
in the joints.
Okay, and then
slowly let's unravel,
bring it back to center,
interlace the fingertips,
bring them behind the head,
extend the thumbs.
We're gonna bring
the knees up to the chest.
Benji's back, come on buddy.
Come be me my cheerleader for
this next centering practice.
Bring the knees up to the chest.
Aww, thanks.
Well, okay.
See you.
And then we're going to
just send the knees out
so that they're
over the hip points.
Shins parallel to the ceiling,
low back flush with the mat.
Now I want to take
a second to lovingly
just be a good friend here 
and be kind of transparent.
If you haven't been in touch
with center work for a while,
then it might be best
for you to keep the knees
a little bit forward
instead of over the hip points,
and this is so that you can
start to gain that core strength
back so that we can keep
the low back nice and flush
with the mat.
So in other words, if
you bring your knees out
and your low back comes up,
back up the truck a little,
hug the knees in
just a little bit
so you feel that low
back flush with the mat.
Alright, this might
seem like overkill,
but I don't want you to
have a sore back after this
and I want us to actually
start building some incredible
power and strength
from the inside out.
Okay, here we go, inhale in.
Find that kiss of the 
low back on the earth.
And exhale.
We're gonna send the
right leg all the way out,
flex the foot as you lift
right elbow up to the left knee,
peek at me if you need to.
Good, inhale,
come back to center.
Head comes all the way down.
Exhale, switch,
extend the left leg,
left elbow to right knee.
Good, inhale back to center.
Exhale right elbow to left knee.
Inhale to center,
left elbow to right knee.
Inhale to center nice and slow.
Exhale to the left.
Inhale to center.
Exhale to the right.
You have one more on
each side, you got this.
If you took a break,
come back now.
Over to left, 
twist, twist, twist.
And to center, and last one,
over to the right, twist.
Excellent, beautiful.
From here, release the hands,
bring them behind the thighs.
We're gonna rock up and
down the length of the spine
and my guess is this is
going to feel nice for you
but maybe not for everybody.
So if it ain't for you, skip it
and just meet me all the
way at the top of your mat
in a standing Forward Fold.
So you're gonna
rock all the way up,
bring the feet
together or hip width apart,
your
choice.
Then plant the palms, step it
back for Downward Facing Dog.
Yes, pedal it out,
ground through the feet,
find that rotation
in the upper arm bones.
Find your center here by
hugging the low ribs in.
And if Downward Dog is
a dreaded pose for you,
anchor in the
sound of your breath
and focus on this connection
in your core, your center,
draw the navel in and up a bit.
Just widening our
perspectives here a little bit
by keeping an open mind,
open to a new
experience each day,
using these postures
even when they're challenging
or maybe especially
when they're challenging
to center you in
the present moment.
Alright, baby steps
to the top of the mat,
nice and easy
stretching through the feet.
Maybe passing through a
little veil of humility
as you come back up
to your Forward Fold.
Again, the feet
together or hip width apart,
your choice.
This time really let the
weight of the head go here.
Ground through all
four corners of the feet,
don't forget those heels,
the back two corners.
Bend the knees slightly,
and we're just gonna take
the fingertips and walk them
over to the right,
dig into the left heel.
What's up left low back?
And then over to the left,
dig into the right heel.
And then back to center.
Inhale lots of love in, yes,
mean it, feel it, let's do it.
Why not?
And exhale lots of love out.
And inhale lots of love in.
And centering in that
love as you breathe out.
Then keep it
going if it felt good,
inhaling lots of love
in as you roll up slowly
and exhaling lots of love out.
Alright, today, when
you stand up nice and tall
in this Mountain Pose,
I'd like for you to
find a little something
that you can focus on
down past your nose or
maybe right out in front of you,
and we're gonna keep
the hands at our sides here
with energy, with feeling,
and we're gonna just play,
and it'll be a little bit
different for everyone here
but just with the feet, however
they are is totally good.
So either hip width
apart or flush together,
you're going to lift
up from the pelvic floor
and slowly lift the
heels up as high as you can.
And then lower down.
That's it, let's try
again a little bit slower
and with control.
Lifting up.
And bringing it down.
And one more time,
and this time,
this is a little wild
but just hang with me.
Imagine that this part
of your body, your center
is actually
what's lifting you up.
So not the heels or not
this maneuvering of the feet
but it's actually
this part of your body
that's lifting you up.
In fact, everyone take a fist,
bring it right here
to the belly or you know, to
the upper abs, solar plexus,
wherever feels right for you.
And then lift up from here,
lift, lift, lift.
Good and then once you
feel like you're up there
and if you fall like I just did,
just come right back, no biggie.
Release the arms down.
And then maybe we
start to reach the arms up.
And think about
lifting from the pelvic floor
and drawing the
navel in and up, up, up.
Beautiful. Then slowly drop 
your center down in space,
that brings the
heels to the ground,
we bend the knees,
and we send it all the way down,
fingertips towards the toes.
Good, inhale, nice
refreshing breath in here
as you bring it to a
nice flat back position.
Find length in the
neck and then exhale
to soften and
fold everything down.
Plant the palms, step one
foot back then the other
so you're in your Plank Pose.
We're getting our
conditioning in each day here.
Again, find your center,
hug those low ribs in and up.
If you're collapsing in
the shoulder blades here,
puff up through
the upper back body,
send those scaps left to right,
reach the heels back.
We're here for ten, you got it.
Nine, breathe, listen, eight.
Seven,
six,
five,
four,
three, on the one squeeze
the elbows into the side body
lower all the way to the earth.
Nice. Take a deep breath 
in here, press into the feet.
Long breath out as you
bring the hands in line
with the rib cage.
Again, squeeze the elbows in.
Inhale, we rise up,
Cobra.
Exhale to release.
Curl the toes under,
inhale, big breath,
all four sides of
the torso expand.
Exhale up to your strong Plank.
Let your center of gravity
be what lifts you up and back
this time,
Downward Facing Dog, nice.
Then anchor the left heel,
inhale lift the
right leg up high.
Exhale squeeze the right
knee all the way up and forward
then step it into
your nice low lunge.
Keep the back knee
lifted today if you can,
reach the left heel back and
slowly sweep the arms forward
and all the way
up towards the sky.
Now drop your center down low.
Bend that back knee
generously for a moment here
so you can really get
your center underneath you.
So it feels like
head and heart and pelvis
are all in alignment,
then you can start to
straighten that back leg
and maybe look up
in between your hands.
Fingertips have energy here,
inhale in deeply.
Exhale, open up, Warrior II.
Inhale, straight leg today
all the way up towards the sky,
right fingertips
reach up and back.
Big breath, big stretch.
Now hug the low ribs in,
round through as
you transition here,
peek at me if you need to.
So shoulders round forward,
soft fingertips as we come
all the way back and through,
bend that front knee
and come into the twist.
The right fingertips lift us up,
really today focusing
on spiraling the heart up
towards the sky.
Good, and then
bringing the right hand down,
stepping the right toes back,
inhale to look forward,
shift forward.
Exhale to lower all
the way to the belly.
Inhale, Cobra, your version.
And exhale all
the way back down.
Inhale, big breath in here.
Exhale to Plank.
Inhale in here.
Whole body
experience and exhale,
your center
brings you up and back
into your Downward Facing Dog.
Nice.
Anchor the right heel here.
Big breath, as you inhale,
lift the left leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward,
long breath.
Step it up.
Find your footing here,
high lunge.
But of course, feel free 
to lower that back knee
if you need.
Squeeze the inner thighs
together from center,
inhale, we rise up,
reach the fingertips 
towards the heavens.
Then let's bend
that back knee here,
really get our pelvis
kind of underneath us.
So this will be
different for everyone
but you want to
feel that containment
in the center that
we had on our backs.
Alright, maybe you
start to straighten
that back leg again when
you've played 
with that centering.
And maybe we look
up towards the sky.
Controlling the breath.
Opening up Warrior II 
nice and wide.
And right away
straightening the front leg now,
left fingertips up and back,
big breath, big stretch.
For this transition,
navel draws in.
So really draw the
navel in, we round through
bend that front knee,
soft fingertips here in the
transition as you come forward
for your lunge, inhale spiral
the heart up towards the sky.
Energy in the left fingertips.
Good and then slowly exhale,
bring it down.
Plant the palms,
spread the fingertips,
step the left toes back.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale to lower to the belly.
Inhale, your beautiful Cobra.
That's right, (chuckles)
and then exhale to release.
Curl the toes under, inhale in.
The exhale brings you up, navel
to spine like a rocket ship.
So from center, we're moving.
Hips up high and back, Down Dog.
Nice.
Bend the knees,
inhale to look forward.
Exhale to make
your way to the top.
Find your way, my darling.
Feet together this time.
So really together, let's play.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Bend the knees, check
it out, roll it up here.
So rag doll again, but
this time feet are together
and we're feeling the squeeze,
squeeze squeezing sensation
all the way up,
finding a sense of
stability, of center, of power
here as you squeeze the legs.
And you can feel these big
strong muscles of the legs
turn on (laughs).
The glutes turn on as well.
And here we go.
From center, if you liked this,
bring the fist back to
the abdominal wall
and let's lift up.
So this moves first here
and then the heels lift.
This time we're working
with legs squeezing together,
all of us.
We can stay here focused
on our point, our Drishti,
a point in which we gaze upon,
holding our balance, 
stability, finding center
in both mind and body.
Maybe we stay here
or maybe we reach
the arms all the way up.
If you're on the toes,
really on the toes,
try to press into all of
the toes, even that pinky.
Relax any tension in
the neck or the shoulders.
Good, inhale in.
Exhale, release everything
and take it all
the way back down.
Let's rinse it off a little,
inhale extension,
lengthen the crown of
the head, halfway lift.
Exhale, soften
and fold everything.
Good.
Shake the head a
little yes, a little no here
then slowly roll it
back up to standing.
Beautiful, hands
come to the waistline
and we're gonna turn to
step nice and wide on the mat.
Alright,
toes turn out here to start.
Nice wide stance.
You want to make
sure that your ankles
are at least as
wide as your wrists
if you were to
take your arms out.
So sometimes that's
a great way to check,
particularly if you're 
new to the practice.
Alright and then
hands back to the waistline
so that we can close
our eyes or soften our gaze
and imagine ourselves
just
embodying
all that beautiful
power that resides within.
It's definitely
a superhero pose.
Think of this lifting up 
through the front body,
this grounding
through the back body.
Inhale in.
And exhale,
we're gonna bend the knees,
just drop the center in space.
Now press into the
outer edges of your feet
'cause your knees are
going to want to roll in,
totally normal.
And we're gonna
press into the outer edges.
So we have a wider
stance than Goddess Pose.
So if you're
bringing your feet in now,
try to keep it a little bit wide.
Pressing into the
outer edges of the feet,
seeing if we can feel the
thigh bones, those femurs,
slowly hug in.
And if you're here,
know this is to be expected.
So we're just working, right?
I've been doing
this a lot, working,
working to find this
integration to work from center
to stack the bones
in an optimal way.
So if the knees are knocking in,
press into the
outer edges of the feet,
everyone draw energy
up from the inner arches,
engage the inner thigh.
Standing tall here, inhale in.
Exhale, straighten the legs.
Beautiful, now turn the
toes in, we've been here before.
Inhale, lift your 
heart to the sky.
And exhale, navel
draws in towards the spine
as we come forward.
Nice flat back position.
Looking down into our reflexion.
This time we're gonna
bring the left fingertips
to the earth, or if you're like,
"Adriene, not quite."
Fold up your blanket,
bring the earth up to you.
Maybe some books
or pillows, yoga blocks,
imagine that
if you have them.
DVDs, do you
guys still have DVDs?
You'd have to
stack a lot of DVDs.
But hey.
Alright, and if
you're feeling impatient
when I say things like that,
just remember we're
casting a wide net,
a lot of people are
practicing together
and it's like kind of the
magic of this. So be patient.
Think of it as like, "Oh,
I'm going to work out my breath
"while my fellow
humans get set up
"so that we can all
practice together."
Right fingertips
come to the left wrist
and we're gonna
slowly find a twist.
So soft bend in the knees here
as you slowly reach the right
fingertips up towards the sky.
You might check in,
notice how your twists
are kind of evolving here
with the breath as we
continue this journey.
If you're here,
that's normal too. 
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Inhale, maybe you send your
gaze up towards your right thumb.
And exhale we'll come back
through and we will switch.
Same thing on the other side,
right hand or right
fingertips replace the left hand
and we'll take the left hand
all the way up towards the sky.
Careful not to lock
out through the knees.
Breathe, use your breath, right?
Inhale to lift and
lengthen always in the twist
and exhale to go on the journey.
Maybe on your last
cycle of breath here
you look up at the left thumb.
Woo!
And then slowly
bring it back down.
Alright, from here, 
heel-toe, heel-toe the feet
all the way back to center.
So you're in a Forward Fold.
Inhale, halfway lift
wherever you are on your mat,
just give it a little length.
And exhale to release.
Fingertips come to
the earth or your DVDs,
and we're gonna lift the heels,
we're gonna drop the
center down in space,
come into to a nice low crouch.
Now we've played
around with this before.
Just take a second.
Find your breath.
Inhale in.
Exhale.
Nice and easy, we're
gonna turn on the mat
if you need to,
and we're gonna
open the knees wide,
we're gonna
keep the heels lifted.
Alright, hands out in front,
spread the fingertips.
We're gonna draw the
shoulder blades together,
shoulders away from the ears.
So we find on that
connection in the shoulder.
And then slowly, we're
going to think about the center,
your center of gravity 
is what lifts you up.
Knees come up towards the armpit
and don't worry
about Crow Pose yet,
we're just moving
our center in space.
Now, if I can introduce anything,
if this is new for you
it would be to A,
move from center
and not worry about the shape,
but B, keep your
gaze out, your focus,
that Drishti that we had before
because if you start
shifting your center forward
and the gaze is here,
it's going to
keep moving in space
and you're gonna
do a somersault.
So let's just play here,
a little Bakasana practice.
We lift the center up, 
we send the gaze out in front,
nice focal point out in front
as we rock forward and back
forward and back.
And we've been
working on a lot of things
that will set us up
for a nice healthy Crow.
So you might just work
on center forward and back,
but if you find as
you hug the elbows in
and get those knees 
all up in there, (chuckles)
fancy term, up towards 
your upper chest,
you feel this
connection in your center
so much that you feel
like you can lift one foot
maybe and lift the other.
And then maybe you 
rock forward, lift both feet.
Feeling that connection
in your center of gravity.
So we're not really digging
the knees into the arms here,
we're finding that
lift up through the navel.
Just give it a couple rounds,
make sure you're not
holding your breath.
And then when you feel
like you've had enough,
go ahead and come
on down to the ground.
Swing your legs to one side,
send the legs out in front.
Fingertips reach out in
line with the shoulders
and then we're gonna
take the fingertips down.
Good.
Stretch, stretch, stretch.
Take the right thumb to
the center of the left palm
and press it forward.
Breathe in.
And switch.
Left thumb to the
center of the right palm.
Breathing in.
And release.
Now come to lie
flat on the back,
hug the knees into the chest.
Inhale in deeply.
And exhale completely.
Awesome, send the arms
into those cactus arms,
roll both knees to the
right side, inhale in.
Exhale, turn onto your left ear.
Take a cycle of breath here in.
And out.
And then slowly
come back to center.
Take it to the left.
Breath in.
And turn on to your
right ear as you breathe out.
Full cycle of breath here, in.
And out.
And then slowly
come back to center
and into the Corpse Pose.
Extend the legs out long,
arms resting
gently at your sides.
You can close your eyes here,
you can always cover the eyes.
And if this isn't your jam,
you can sit up in a nice
comfortable seat to find
stillness in meditation.
Let's just take a
moment to congeal.
Maybe
a moment of contemplation,
I think for today's
theme is appropriate.
You know, 
"What does center feel like?"
is a good question to ask.
Why is center important?
Ultimately, this
is what my practice
and the practice I share
really is all about, 100%.
What is my
relationship to center?
What is that relationship like?
What does it look like?
What does it feel like it? 
What does it mean?
And if you're like, "Oh, these
all seem like good questions,
"they resonate, but I don't 
know how to answer them."
Don't you worry about a thing,
it's the awareness 
of the very thing that
will hold you 
in the present moment.
One present moment
leading to the next.
Wiggle your fingers,
wiggle your toes,
and slowly draw the
hands together at the heart
when you're ready.
Feel your thumbs on your chest.
And I invite you
to see if you can
play with moving from the center
as you get up off your mat
and even as you
roll it up or walk away.
Maybe getting in and out
of the bathtub or the car,
up and down off the toilet
or just moving through space.
Truly see what happens 
if you can remember,
"Oh, what is it?
"What is it like if
I move from center?
"How does that change
the quality of my movement?"
Sweet, thumbs up to the third eye,
I think that's enough for today,
I love you so much.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale.
The journey continues mañana,
I'll see you there.
Namaste.
