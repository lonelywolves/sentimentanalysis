- Hey everyone, welcome
to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and this is Benji.
And this is yoga for
when you feel dead inside.
(melancholy music)
So hop into something comfy,
and let's get started.
(spooky music)
Let's begin in a
comfortable seat.
Come on down to the ground.
Sit up nice and tall
and right away take
a deep breath in.
And as you exhale,
relax your shoulders
sigh it out and just kind of
land here in the moment.
Bring the palms together, 
inhale in, deep breath,
here we go.
And as you exhale, bow
your head to your heart,
you can close your
eyes if you like
and again, just sigh it out, 
let go, land here.
Whatever it is that
you're feeling right now
or maybe you're here because
there's a lack of feeling,
a bit of numbness,
dead energy, emptiness,
feeling sort of being lost
or worried, it's all good.
We're here to acknowledge 
all of those things
and be fully who we
are in this moment.
Dropping any expectations and
hopefully using this practice
and really our breath to
move the energy,
move your energy,
create a little movement,
find what feels good.
I love the theme
of this practice
because it's a 
great opportunity to
guide your focus and notice 
what makes you feel alive.
Let that capture your attention
and let it draw you closer in.
Take one more breath here,
nice big stretch in the
back of the neck hopefully.
And exhale, release the head.
You can open the eyes, 
lift the chin.
We're gonna take the
hands to the knees here
just to start with a
little spinal flection.
Inhale, lift the chest,
look up.
Exhale, round through,
drop your chin to your
chest and lean back.
Inhale, we lift up.
And exhale, we round through, 
chin to chest.
So we're rocking
forward and back
in the hips and the pelvis.
We're moving in opposite
directions with the breath,
inhale and exhale, creating
and stimulating a little bit
of energetic flow that
runs up and down the spine.
When the energy of the
body becomes stagnant
we can feel
pretty, pretty dead.
So we're gonna 
start nice and slow.
Now taking it into a circle.
you're gonna inhale, 
come forward.
Use the hands on the knees
to really get the most
out of this gesture.
Exhale, around and back.
Inhale, come forward.
And exhale, around and back.
Getting a little
massage in the glutes,
creating a little more
mobility, flexibility
in those hip sockets.
And then really 
moving from the belly.
This is great for
massaging the internal organs
which can also help to make
you feel a little more alive.
And reversing the circle.
Deepening your breath, 
maybe inhaling
as you smooth the
heart forward and exhaling
as you come around and back.
Alright, bring it 
back to center,
head over heart,
(clears throat)
excuse me, heart over pelvis.
Nice and easy, we're gonna
interlace the fingertips,
bring them behind the head.
You can keep the
thumbs extended
like so to kind of
cradle the neck here.
Then inhale, really
come out of the side waist,
so you're gonna just
kind of reach one elbow
up to the ceiling 
and then the other
coming out of the side waist.
You should feel the
skin stretch just a bit.
Beautiful, then take the
right elbow all the way
up towards the
ceiling or the sky
and take the 
left elbow down, breathe in.
Lift the chest.
And then bring it back to
center and opposite side.
Take the left elbow up
right elbow down, breathe in,
lean back, lift the chest.
And then come back to center.
Awesome, deep breath in, 
lift your heart.
Exhale, slowly release
the fingertips down
gently to your sides.
Great, from here we're gonna 
extend the legs out long,
kind of a V. It doesn't 
have to be super wide.
There's no flexibility
contest happening here.
So you can keep
them pretty narrow
or play with the width,
but it doesn't have
to be the splits.
We do want to try to
sit up nice and tall,
so it could be a
good option to sit
up on a blanket or a
towel or a pillow here.
Beautiful, then we're 
gonna inhale in,
lengthen through
the top of the head,
so really 
energetically just kind of
keep an awareness 
moving up here.
And as you exhale,
we're gonna bring the palms
out in front and
start to lean forward.
So little seated Wide-
Legged Forward Fold.
Super therapeutic.
You can also do this standing.
And it'll depend on how you're 
feeling today, of course.
Slight bend in the knees here
as you maybe come
on to the forearms
or you can even
stay really tall
on the fingertips
here, like a spider.
Now find a deep,
full breath here,
so really
extending the inhalation.
And extending the exhalation.
Great, and then on this
last cycle of breath,
see if you can draw
the chin to your chest.
Relaxing the
weight of the head down.
And then slowly
release come back up.
We're gonna slowly make
our way to all fours.
So take your time bring
your legs in, come forward.
And once again,
spinal flection.
Hi Benji. Hi Benji, are
you my little werewolf?
Are you my little wolf?
Once again, spinal flection.
So wrists underneath
the shoulders for this one.
Knees underneath the hips.
Inhale, drop the belly,
open the chest.
Really exaggerate 
tailbone to the sky here.
And then exhale like
a black Halloween cat.
Navel draws up. We really
arch through the spine,
press into the hands,
press into the feet.
Good inhale, drop the belly,
open the chest.
Exhale, round through.
And for this one, we're gonna 
move a little bit more quickly.
Just bringing some
energy to the body.
So finding a bit 
of a swift rhythm
but one that works for you.
And maybe speeding it
up just a bit more.
I often guide this type
of flection really slow
so this should be really fun
if you practice
with me regularly.
Good and then 
slowing it back down,
coming back to that
nice neutral spine.
We're gonna drop the elbows
now where the hands just were
and we're gonna
walk the knees out.
You can peek at me
if you need to here.
The hands and the
wrist and the forearms
are staying on the ground
as I send my chest back,
walking the knees back,
hips up high towards the sky
for a little half dog
or a Puppy Posture.
We also call this
Heart-to-Earth Pose.
So this is an inversion.
Head is below 
the heart here, albeit gentle.
You can tick-tok the hips 
a little left to right
opening up again through
the side waist and side body.
Inhale in deeply here.
And exhale completely.
One more time, 
inhale in deeply.
And exhale to 
let everything go.
Great, from here 
hug the low ribs in,
draw your navel 
up towards your spine.
From your center, 
from your core
begin to slowly shift
your heart, the chest forward
and come all the way
through into a Sphinx Posture.
From here, we'll press
into the tops of the feet,
press into the pubic bone,
draw the shoulders
away from the ears.
Nice and steady here
in the foundation.
So my forearms and wrists
and hands aren't coming in
but maintaining
those two parallel lines
that I established
in Puppy Posture.
Then tuck your chin, inhale,
open up through the chest.
So neck, back of the neck,
especially is nice and long.
We're breathing here,
we're pressing away
from the yoga mat.
So really lifting up
out of the foundation.
Alright, now we're
gonna start to spark
a little more energy. 
Be brave.
We got this. 
Use your breath, inhale.
Exhale. You're gonna
curl the toes under.
Keep the hands, wrists,
elbows, where they are
and we're gonna 
lift the hips up high.
Think hollow body, so really 
lifting the front body up.
You can even take
a second to look
at your toes to 
exaggerate that hollow body.
And then send your 
gaze right back down
straight down to the
mat in front of you.
We might start to shake here.
The abdominal
certainly toning, turning on
and we're here shaking,
noticing what it actually
feels like to be alive today.
You're here for five,
breathe deep.
Four, stick with it.
Reach the heels back, three.
Two and on the one slowly 
lower back to the belly, release.
Drag the hands 
in line with the rib cage.
Cobra, here we go,
inhale to lift the heart.
Catch a wave 
here with the breath.
And then exhale to release, 
forehead to the mat.
Curl the toes under,
press up to all fours.
And then when you're ready,
send the hips 
up high and back.
We'll join Benji 
here in a version
of Downward Facing Dog.
Now feel your hands on
the earth, the ground
my darling friend.
Pedal through the feet,
stretching through
the fascia of the foot
and really letting that curiosity 
travel all the way up
through the ankle, 
the backs of the legs, the hips.
Side body, 
side waist nice and long.
Head soft, neck not 
holding, gripping here.
Great.
Take a deep breath in, inhale.
Exhale, you're going to
slowly lower to the knees.
And then nice and
steady, nice and slow,
be kind in the transition.
You're gonna
step the right foot
just the right foot all the
way up into a nice low lunge.
You can stay nice and close
or you can walk the left
knee out for a deeper stretch.
Then nice and slow 
we'll sweep the arms
all the way up and overhead.
Right hand is gonna 
grab left wrist here.
Good, squeeze the inner thighs.
Find your center,
find that midline connection.
So for more
balance and stability
we wanna squeeze everything
into the middle of the mat.
So squeeze the inner
thighs in, lift your heart.
Good and then we're
gonna take that left wrist
with the right hand
and we're gonna gently
tilt to the right.
Should feel big stretch 
in the left side waist,
front of the
left hip crease.
Now lift your heart, think
Cobra or Sphinx pose here.
Yes, inhale in.
Exhale, slowly bring it 
back to center and then
we'll rain it down hands 
back to frame in the right foot.
Good, pull the
right hip crease back.
Just a little
counter stretch here.
Excuse me, Benji.
Inhale to look forward, 
find length.
And exhale,
forehead toward the knee,
doesn't even have to come
close, just the intention.
Gorgeous, now we're gonna roll
through the right foot here.
We're gonna come back to
all fours or Plank Pose.
So you can step the right
foot back to all fours
or if you want a
little more heat today
you're starting to
feel a little more alive
or want to create a
little more heat,
you can come to Plank.
And then from all 
fours or Plank Pose,
we'll lift it back up,
Downward Facing Dog.
When you get there,
take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
And a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
And once more inhale in.
And exhale to lower the knees.
Bye Benji, step the
left foot all the way up.
And again an option to
walk the right knee back.
Front knee over
front ankle, here we go.
We're gonna sweep the arms
all the way up and overhead.
And this time the left hand
will grab the right wrist
and we're gonna
lift it all the way up.
And then take it
over to the left side.
Left hip crease is
still pulling back here.
I'm finding that balance by
squeezing the inner thighs
towards the midline.
Then lift the 
chest as you tilt over.
Relax the shoulders 
down into socket.
Take one more 
breath here, inhale.
Exhale, come back to center
and then rain it 
down nice and slow.
Great, pull the
left hip crease back,
flex your left toes
towards your face.
Let's catch a little
wave with the breath here.
Inhale to look 
forward, lengthen.
And then exhale to
soften and fold inward.
Nice rolling 
through the left foot.
Same thing, option to 
go to Plank or take it all fours
So your choice.
Breathe.
And then
Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale in.
Empty it out.
Come on now, 
big breath in.
And letting something go.
One more time, big inhale.
Nice cleansing breath out
through the nose or mouth.
Lovely, slowly lower 
to the knees
and step the right foot up.
Walk the left knee
back just a bit.
Squeeze the inner
thighs in the midline.
Again, sweeping the arms 
forward, up and back.
Right wrist grabs, excuse me.
Right hand grabs
the left wrist.
Now this time, we'll
repeat what we did before.
Or you can start to levitate,
lift your left knee
all the way up here.
So back knee's on the 
earth as we did before
or back knee is lifted.
I'm tilting my 
head to the right.
I'm pulling my right hand.
Excuse me, pulling my left
wrist with my right hand,
I'm lifting the heart.
Good, inhale in, 
You got it.
Exhale, slowly come
back to center first.
Then if the back knee is
lifted, go ahead and lower it,
nicely, sweetly, no crashing.
And then we'll
come back down.
Good, quick counter
stretch here.
Pull the right hip crease
back, inhale, look forward.
Exhale, shift forward, 
roll it through.
Plant the palms,
step it back to all fours
or Plank Pose, 
again, your choice.
Downward Facing Dog.
Three breaths here on your own,
I'm not gonna cue them
this time, take three.
Count them out and listen to
the sound of your inhalation,
sound of your exhalation.
After three slowly
lower to the knees.
Step that left
foot all the way up.
Sweep the arms up and overhead.
Left hand grabs
the right wrist.
We think up and
over to the left.
Option to lift the back knee.
Breathe deep here.
Draw the 
shoulder blades together.
Creating a little heat, 
a little balance.
Inhale in. Lean, maybe a
little more to the left.
Squeeze your inner
thighs to the midline
as you breathe out.
And then inhaling 
back to center.
Exhaling, right knee kisses 
the earth if it was lifted
and we bring the 
fingertips back down. Great.
Send the left hip crease back.
Little runners stretch.
Inhale, look forward.
Exhale, rolling back into the 
left foot, back to your lunge.
Plant the palms, step it
back all fours or Plank.
and then Downward Facing Dog.
Alright, listen carefully.
This time inhale in,
exhale, connect to your core.
So your core
muscles kind of lift up
and that's where we're 
gonna lift the right foot from
all the way back
up into our lunge.
Now walk your right hand
over to meet your left here
for a little Lizard variation 
with the back knee lifted.
Always an option to lower 
the back knee here if you like.
Otherwise keep it lifted here,
Lizard variation, if you
want to stick your tongue out
you can like lizard.
Breathing deeply.
Option to come
onto the forearms here.
And then slowly releasing.
From here, same thing.
You can come back to 
all fours or to that Plank.
Building strength.
Moving the energy of the body.
We'll meet in
Downward Facing Dog.
Alright, Lizard on the second side.
Inhale in.
Exhale, step the left
foot all the way up.
Keep that back knee
lifted if you can
just to start and
then you can, you know
you can always lower it.
And then we'll bring the left 
hand over to meet the right.
Breathing deep here.
You gotta bring the breath.
Lizard Pose on the other side.
We might bring it 
down to the forearms.
Maybe, maybe not.
Again, reiterating
can always lower,
maybe you start with the
knee lifted then lower it
after a breath or two.
Lizard Pose.
Alright, and then slowly we'll 
make our way out of the posture.
We'll come back to
the lunge and last time
to all fours or to Plank.
And then to
Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale in deeply.
And exhale to 
empty it, let it go.
Shake the head 
a little yes, a little no.
Awesome, then slowly
lower to the knees.
Cross one ankle over the other
and you're gonna come through
from here all the way to
a nice cross legged seat.
Great, from here we're
gonna take the right hand
to the left knee,
left fingertips behind.
Inhale to sit up nice and tall.
And exhale to twist.
Maybe gently looking
past the left shoulder.
So I say gently because
you don't want to crank it.
just let it be kind of,
I hope I don't
regret saying this
but let it be kind of organic.
(chuckling)
Think of the inhale as
being an opportunity
to kind of lift and find space
and the exhale to kind
of get curious and twist.
You keep repeating
that little dance.
And then bringing
it back to center.
We'll do the same
thing on the other side.
Left hand now 
to the right knee.
Right fingertips behind.
Inhale to get long 
through the front body.
And exhale to
play with the twist.
Good, and then slowly 
melting it back to center.
We're gonna, from here,
we're gonna actually
come into a little
balancing posture.
So first you're
gonna lift your knees up,
feet on the ground.
Then you're gonna
take your hands
and just hang with me here.
You're gonna put them
in an underneath your
ankles or your calves.
So you're kind of 
grabbing the outer edges
of your shins, 
your calves, your ankles.
Would be a little different 
for everyone based on
the length of your arms,
your legs, shape of your body.
Just try to have 
a little fun here.
A little balancing Spider Pose.
We're going to, inhale in,
exhale, you might lift the shins
parallel to the ceiling, 
leaning back.
This is maybe just
a little version
of our Boat Pose,
Boat variation.
And then if you
want to keep playing,
you can spread the toes,
walk the backs of the knees.
I know, up a little bit closer
to catch them in elbow creases
and then we're gonna
spread the fingertips
and spread the toes
here as we balance.
You can imagine
you're holding two bowls,
one in each hand,
maybe a third one 
with your feet, that's extra.
So my chest is
starting to collapse here,
I'm gonna lift the chest up,
Same action that
I've been doing
in all the other Asana today
finding that lift
up through the heart.
Inhale in.
And exhale to slowly 
release and let it go.
Alright, Benji, do you 
want to come back?
Come here, come here buddy.
Come here buddy, come back.
So we're gonna come to lie down.
Benji is gonna join us.
Come on buddy.
Come on, you bring
light into my life.
You make me feel alive.
Once you're
down on the ground
snuggle your shoulder blades
underneath your heart space.
Excellente and then
you're gonna actually
send your toes up
towards the sky.
And it's okay if the 
knees are bent here.
Now reach your
fingertips all the way up
towards your toes or even
towards the outer edges
of your feet,
whatever feels good.
And here we go,
inhale in.
Exhale, you're gonna 
start to shake.
So give your
thinking mind a break.
You're gonna feel
like this is silly,
this isn't really beneficial
but I'm gonna lovingly
ask you to give it a try.
And shaking, shaking.
Try to have a little fun 
with it even if you feel silly.
And getting a little faster.
Yes, the image here is 
like a dead bug, (laughs).
Shaking, shaking, shaking.
And then there comes a
point where you tuck the chin
and you get long in the neck
and you start to kind of
take this a little seriously
like, "Alright, I got this.
"I'm getting a little bit
faster. A little bit faster."
And then you drop the focus, 
drop taking it seriously
and you just go 
crazy for three, two,
one, bring the 
feet to the ground.
Bring the hands to the belly,
extend one leg 
and then the other.
Breathe into your hands
like you love yourself.
Inhale, big breath
into the belly.
Exhale to relax the shoulders.
Inhale, breathe into the belly.
And exhale to relax the weight
of your body
fully into the earth.
Now close your eyes here
as we come to
embody the Corpse Pose.
Quite apropos for our
practice here today.
Relax the right hand, you're
gonna extend the right arm
all the way out to your side.
Right palm face up and 
then relax the left hand.
Take your left arm all
the way out to your side.
Left palm face up.
And as we come into stillness 
here in the Corpse Pose
we're just going to
take a moment to surrender
and feel our breath,
moving the body feel
this
sensation maybe of warmth
or just presence
just for a moment here.
Then before you start
moving your body again
just maybe a 
little invitation to
say thank you to yourself for
selecting this practice
and taking a little bit of time
to get to know yourself a
little more and stay present.
So there are certainly
moments, days, weeks
where we feel like
things are unraveling
and where we feel
like we want to give up.
But, I love these tools,
the tools of yoga 
and this practice
and even this 
community because
it reminds me that
there are things I can do
to tend to myself and to
get to know myself better
and care for myself so
that I can stay present
and stay with it, stay here.
Gently, bring the
palms together,
bring the thumbs up
to the third eye.
Again, don't skip out on 
that thank you to yourself.
Say thank you here,
if you haven't already.
And may this practice to inspire 
you to create more movement
and deeper breaths that
help you feel present.
And that remind you
that you are worthy
of this beautiful life.
Even when things
feel or look grim.
I love you guys,
I'm so grateful
for the love that you spread
too, by sharing the videos
with your loved ones and
with your communities.
Let's keep that
ripple effect going.
Take a deep breath,
let's breath in
together, altogether.
And we'll exhale 
here to whisper,
Namaste.
(melancholy music)
(spooky music)
