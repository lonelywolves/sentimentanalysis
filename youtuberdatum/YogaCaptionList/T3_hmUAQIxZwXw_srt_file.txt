- What's up, everyone?
Welcome to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 11. Flow.
Let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Alrighty, my darling friends,
we are going to begin
today's practice standing.
So come on to
the top of your mat.
I'll let you decide,
feet hip width
apart or flush together.
Feel this
foot-to-earth connection.
Stand up nice and tall.
And we're gonna bring
one hand over the other
and bring your hands right
to your heart here to begin.
Tuck the chin slightly,
just a little reverent bow.
And you can
close your eyes here.
Thank you for
allowing me to guide you.
Can just listen to the
sound of my voice here
as we tune in.
Bringing our awareness
to the sound of the breath.
Notice how you feel.
Whatever you're bringing
to the mat today is perfect.
It's all good.
I'm so glad that you're here.
We're gonna sync up
with the breath today
in the most loving way.
Get in the flow.
And as you're ready,
take a deep breath in.
And a long breath
out through the nose
or the mouth, your choice.
One more time, deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
Really grounding through
your feet on this last one.
Big inhale, lots of love in.
And exhale, lots of love out.
Release the fingertips down.
Imagine you're
tearing your mat in half.
So whether the feet are hip
width apart or flush together,

really feel this connection
almost as if you were
trying to move your legs apart.

into a Pigeon here.
So we're gonna
bring the right foot
over towards the
left side of the mat.
Walk the left toes behind you.
Keep a nice, active
energy in both feet.
You're gonna press into
the top of that left foot.
And you're gonna look back at it
and make sure it's
nice and straight.
And then slowly come on
down to the forearms here.
Palms can come
together in prayer
or fingertips can interlace.
And we'll bow the head.
Relaxing the shoulders,
softening through the jaw.
Beautiful.
Listen to the
sound of your breath
and keep a nice
active breath here.
Stay where you are,
or you can go a
little further now,
maybe bringing the forehead
to the earth or to a blanket.
And maybe not. 
Maybe you keep it nice and high.
And if you'd like, you can 
also wedge your blanket
between the earth and your
right hip for a little support.
Inhale in deeply.
Exhale completely.
Lean in, snuggle up.
Anchor in the breath.
Inhaling deeply.
Exhaling completely.
Inhale in.
And on this exhale,
slowly begin to press 
the hands into the earth.
And just keep it nice
and slow and easy and chill
from here on out 'til the end.
Of time, just kidding.
And we're gonna bring the
knees back underneath the hips.
Just take a
couple of moments here
to draw circles with the hips.
Maybe a figure-eight shape.
Might take a second
to get the hang of.
A little figure eight.
And then when you're ready,
draw the left
knee all the way up.
Right leg out. Take a
look at that right foot.
Root it down firmly.
And then we'll
come onto the forearms.
You can also stay nice
and lifted on the fingertips.
Wedge a block or blanket
between the left hip here.
Stay nice and
active in the toes.
Inhale in, and then exhale,
slowly bowing the head.
Coming into your version of a
little One-Legged Pigeon here.
We've done
One-Legged Pigeon on the back,
so you can always
flip onto your back
if you think that
might be a better variation.
We're not here long,
so close the eyes.
And lean in, snuggle up
to the sound of your breath.
Of course,
we know we store a lot of
energy, emotion in the body
and the hips don't lie.
So ending with a hip work
to bring us back
into a healthy flow.
Ultimately, we're wanting
a healthy flow of energy.
Right?
We might get stuck.
We will get stuck,
but we use the tools
of our practice to
help create a healthy flow.
If you wanna go
down a little bit lower,
maybe bringing the
forehead now to the arms,
or to the earth or
to blanket or to block.
Close your eyes and listen.
And then gently inhale in.
Use your exhale
to slowly press up.
And you're gonna actually
keep the left leg where it is.
We're gonna rock onto
the left hip, left glute,
and we're gonna swing
the right leg around.
Cross the ankles here.
Sit up nice and 
tall in Sukhasana.
Just take a second
to notice how you feel.
Deep breath in.
Long breath out.
And then slowly extend
the legs out in front.
Send the fingertips
forward. Point the toes.
And nice and slow,
we're gonna roll it down
as if we're holding a ball here
and we're trying to reach the
ball forward towards the toes.
Nice and slow, nice
and slow. nice and slow.
Until we relax
everything on the mat.
Tuck the chin.
Take a breath here.
Inhale.
Exhale.
Nice and easy,
slowly bringing the right
knee up towards the chest.
Take a deep breath in.
And exhale. Guide the 
right knee over towards
the left side of the mat.
Open up through the right arm.
Supine Twist. 
Close your eyes.
Start to relax.
Deep breath.
As you feel the lungs
expand, the rib cage expands.
Good and then slowly
bring it back to center.
Switch. Left knee comes up. 
Take a deep breath in.
And exhale, guide it over
towards the right side
as you open up to the left.
Take a nice, long breath.
Nice, wide breath here.
Like a lateral breath into
all four sides of the torso.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
And then exhale.
Let's do one more 
just like that. Inhale.
Down into the belly.
And exhale. So nice.
Come all the way back to center.
If there's any last
little bit of movement
that would feel good right now,
go ahead and take it.
I'll meet you in Shavasana.
Extending the legs out long.
Arms resting
gently at your sides.
You can use your pillow if
you have it or your blanket
to pad underneath the head
or bring underneath the knees.
And we'll take just
a moment here together
to find stillness.
Allowing your breath to
return to a nice, easy rhythm.
So when I show 
up for myself and
specifically show
up to practice daily,
I find that I can
live in that flow state,
if you will, with more ease.
I truly am able to 
go with the flow,
be really present,
when I'm diligent
about showing up to
listen and be with myself.
So I hope this will
serve as motivation for you
to return to the mat tomorrow.
Thank you for sharing your 
beautiful time and energy
with me and with Benji 
and with all of the other
beautiful souls who 
showed up to practice today.
Let's bring the hands together.
Thumbs all the way
up to the third eye,
this place of intuition.
We'll take one
final inhale in together.
And sending love to all
of you as we breathe out.
Thank you.
Namaste.
