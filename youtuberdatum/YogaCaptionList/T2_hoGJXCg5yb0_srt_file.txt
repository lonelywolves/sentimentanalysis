- Hello everyone.
Welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I am Adriene and today
we have an awesome
yoga for beginners practice
called the
"Foundations of Ease".
So this is a really digestible
practice that might be perfect
for someone who is super duper
brand-new to the practice or
if you're making your return,
say you took some yoga classes
back in the day and now
you're wanting to start an
at-home yoga practice.
I hope that the session can
be a reminder to all of us to
continue to marry ease with
all the effort we're putting in.
So bring a
blanket if you have one,
hop into something
comfy and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Alrighty, my friend, welcome.
We're gonna begin
today's practice seated.
If you like, I highly recommend
lifting your hips up with a
blanket or if you
have a yoga block,
great, but you don't
need anything fancy.
You can even use a thick towel
or maybe even a couch cushion.
Gonna sit up on top of 
something to get the hips a
little bit higher
than the femur,
the thigh bone,
the rest of your legs.
This is gonna allow us to find
a little bit more ease when it
comes to sitting
up nice and tall,
improving that posture and kind
of coming into our bodies in a
way that feels good,
that feels efficient.
Like we're carrying ourselves
around in a way that isn't
painful and that feels
like it's working for us,
right, rather than against us.
That said, if you're coming
into this shape and you're like
"Ooh, man. I feel like my
shoulders are rounding over.
"It's super hard to lift my
chest," don't worry, right?
That's why we're here.
To begin, to start with some
fundamentals of ease and really
just go over a nice like
holistic practice that's gonna
help you getting your 
groove again. Right?
Or if you're starting this
practice for the first time,
welcome.
So glad you're here.
So wherever you are,
hopefully by now,
we've come into a
seat of your choice.
We're going to just lengthen up
through the crown best you can.
Relax your shoulders
down as much as you can.
These little
adjustments right away.
Bringing more
ease into the shape.
And then as you
feel comfortable,
I'll invite you to close your
eyes here or you can soften your
gaze just gently
down past your nose.
Coming to a soft gaze.
So there's an opportunity here
to close the eyes or just soften
the eyelids so that we
can begin to tune in.
And go inside, if you will.
So letting the day,
the external world,
just kind of soften
for a bit here 
and giving yourself
permission to really
check in, go inward.
When we give ourselves this
opportunity to kind of tune in
before we start
moving on the mat,
it really influences the
way we move and the benefits,
kind of the nutrients
we receive from our practice.
So take a deep breath in here.
And that's really the first
fundamental is just allowing
yourself to go inward.
And it's gonna feel different,
look different everyday.
But starting your practice with
a tiny moment of just checking
in with your body, noticing...
Start to gently
deepen your breath here.
Again, just moving into
this role of the observer.
Versus landing here ready
to accomplish something.
Are you gonna kick some butt?
Probably.
Are you gonna
find what feels good?
Are we gonna stretch?
Are we gonna tone?
Are we gonna strengthen
each time we come on the mat?
Most likely you're gonna
find one of those things
if not all of them.
But the first fundamental of
ease is really taking a moment
to tune in and remembering to
check in and see where you are.
Because the practice that you
maybe think might be good for
you, isn't always the
one that might be the best.
So just another quiet
moment here with your breath
to notice how you feel.
Just see how you're doing today.
And the beauty of Yoga With
Adriene is that most likely
there is someone else
practicing in this exact moment,
even with you.
So let's just
kind of honor that.
This idea that we're taking
care of ourselves but we're also
connecting to be
the bigger picture.
Let's honor that by taking a
deep breath in here together.
I'll cue it.
Here we go, big inhale
in through the nose.
Breathe in.
And exhale,
all together, breathe out.
Wonderful, you can
open the eyes.
We're gonna come forward on to
all fours and if you brought a
blanket or a pillow or
a towel you can use it
to pad your knees.
Especially if you haven't been
on the ground here in a while,
it's nice to just set
yourself up for greatness.
I feel like there used to be a
little bit of a stigma around
props and goodies like
blankets and blocks and
things that help.
And man, I say bring it.
Bring it to class. Use it,
especially at home, right?
So set yourself up for greatness
here as we come to our first
Tabletop Position together.
For me this Tabletop Position
is like one of the basics but
I feel like there's so much
depth in this shape that that if
you kind of get in the habit of
a really checking in with your
action and
alignment in Tabletop,
it's gonna influence the rest
of your asana practice in a
really miraculous way.
So just take a second here.
And if this feels really slow
for you just see if you can
stick with it and
maybe find something new.
Maybe a more detailed 
or more nuanced
thing for you. Okay.
So we're gonna spread
the fingertips super wide.
Bring the wrist right
underneath the shoulders.
You don't need a mirror here.
Use your inner mirror.
So even me I often, you know I
see myself on video and I think
I'm doing one thing but 
it looks like the other.
So I can't stress this enough,
focus on what it feels like.
So I'm guiding you to stack
the shoulders over the wrists,
but don't worry
about what it looks like.
Try to move into a
sensation where it feels like,
"Mhmmm, these
bones are stacked."
Alright, that where
we're gonna work for now.
And then we're gonna turn the
pinkies out just a little bit
towards the outer edge of the
mat and your index finger is
gonna be pointing
towards the front edge.
Fingertips are spread wide.
Now, from here, just
playing with the palms.
I'm gonna press
into the fingerprints,
press into the knuckles and
try to take more pressure out of
the wrist by pressing into the
fleshy part of my hand that's
between index finger and thumb.
And if you're like, "Whoa,
this is a big stretch for me,"
me as well.
It's all good.
Take a deep breath in.
On an exhale, bend your elbows,
just bend your elbows and try
to keep him hugging in toward
your side body versus going out.
So bend your elbows in, in, in
towards the tops of your thighs.
Good, then press them up.
Take a break.
And then here we go,
bend the elbows again.
Send them just in
towards the thighs.
Start to kind of shake
maybe a little bit here.
Awesome and then
straighten the arms.
And one more time,
bend the elbows.
Maybe you go a
little lower this time.
Gaze is straight down.
And then back up, awesome.
Now this time careful
not to lock out the elbows,
but keep a slight micro-bend
in that same direction,
in that same line.
Awesome, now walk and the
knees underneath the hip points.
And again, you want the
sensation, the feeling
of the bone stacking.
So this hip socket
stacked over the knee joint.
Excellent, then
curl the toes under,
inhale in, exhale,
send the hips back.
So we're pulling
the hip crease back.
But when you get here,
see if you can find the
sensation that you're actively
pulling back rather than
just sitting back
into the heels.
So we're actively pulling the
hip creases back and that might
change what's
happening in the shoulders.
Awesome, then come back up.
Take a deep breath in.
And exhale, pull
the hip creases back.
Hip creases pull back.
We're gonna use this in our
lunge work here in a second.
So we're pulling back.
We're pushing away from
the yoga mat with the palms.
Great, then come back up.
Reset.
Soft bend in the elbows and
then send it back on more time.
This time try to press
into your pinky toes.
So we're waking up
through the whole foot.
Even if your pinky toe is not
anywhere close to the ground,
try to press
into that pinky toe.
Good, and then come back up.
Here we go.
We're gonna press into
the tops of the feet,
inhale, drop the belly,
open the chest, look forward.
Pause here.
Upper arm bones are
gonna rotate externally out.
So your biceps
are shining towards
the front edge of your mat.
Inhale in here.
Careful not to crunch
the back of the neck.
Keep a soft, easy, breezy
vibe through the shoulders,
the neck and the face.
So we're not clenching.
And then on your exhale,
maintain that ease in the face
as you soft and
easily draw the navel up.
So we're not jerking
ourselves around here.
We're moving in a way that
is kind of influencing the next
movement to be
soft and easy as well.
Okay, keep it going,
inhale, drop the belly.
Open the chest, look forward.
And exhale, round through
the spine, chin to chest.
Navel draws up, up, up.
Inhale, drop the belly.
Open your heart.
And exhale, round through.
Great, inhale come to
a nice neutral spine.
Beautiful, we're gonna
curl the right toes under,
just the right toes.
We're gonna send them
all the way out to a
nice straight leg position.
We're gonna come off the
wrists in just a second.
You're just gonna rock
a little front and back,
stretching through that ankle,
through that calf.
Waking up the core here,
navel draws up and in.
Good, then we'll switch.
Right knee comes in.
We'll curl the left toes under.
Kick it out, nice and easy.
Some floor work here to start.
Really just taking it slow.
Deepening the breath.
Waking up the body.
Good, rocking front and back.
Bring the low belly into it,
draw the navel up and in.
You got this.
And then slowly release.
Awesome, we're gonna
bring the knees as wide
as the yoga mat now.
Bring the big toes to touch.
Pull the hip creases back, reach
the fingertips forward first.
Then drop the elbows
bring the palms together.
Now from here, 
peek at me if you need to,
you're gonna draw
the chin to the chest.
We have a big
shoulder opener here,
heart opener so don't let
the elbows come too wide.
Try to keep them in
line with your shoulders.
We're gonna slowly
drawl the chin in.
Draw, I said "drawl", hello.
Draw the chin in.
And then the palms can come
all the way up and over to be
behind the neck or the head.
So we call this lil'
Namaste Shark Fin.
It's kind of silly but it
somehow has become a thing in
our community but we're starting
to open up through
the shoulders.
Feeling a nice
stretch through the triceps.
The chest.
Breathing deep.
So this warm-up is really an
invitation to start to feel the
body as one moving part
rather than a bunch 
of disjointed parts
or body parts that
we're working on.
We are working with all parts.
The whole shebang.
And, inhale in.
On an exhale, slowly float
the fingertips back down.
We're gonna rise up by drawing
the navel up and in and from
your core we'll kind of
rise back up to all fours.
We're gonna walk the
hands out now a little bit
wider than we
had them before.
Spread the fingertips,
pinkies are on the
edge of your yoga mat.
You're gonna curl
the toes under here.
Inhale in.
Exhale, keep the knees bent
as you peel the tailbone up
to Downward Facing Dog.
Great, start by
pedaling the feet here.
A little back and forth.
And then send your gaze over
to your hands and just check in.
Spread the fingers.
Find that hand-to-earth
connection just like
we had in Tabletop Position.
Biceps by the ears.
Elbow creases rotating forward
and then relax the head back
over as you come
into your shape.
Hug the low ribs in.
Remember peeling
the hip creases back.
Peel 'em up and back here.
Inhale in deeply.
Good, and then exhale come
all the way back to your knees.
Great work.
Walk the hands
underneath the wrists here.
And on your next breath in
we're gonna curl
the right toes under.
This time we're gonna
kick the right toes out and
lift the right heel up.
Good, take a deep breath in.
On an exhale, we're
gonna bend the right knee.
We're gonna step it or slide it
all the way up into the lunge.
And if it doesn't
make it right away,
go ahead and stay calm and just
use your hands to slowly get
that foot up there.
Take your time.
Good, then we're gonna check to
make sure that the front ankle
is over, excuse me is,
under the front knee.
So this is kind of,
not always a rule of thumb,
but this is a fundamental that
we can use for a good amount of
time in our practice,
particularly in the beginning.
So wanna keep front
knee over front ankle.
And you're gonna start to
really feel that in the groin
especially if this is new.
So if you're not
quite there yet,
just notice where you are
and in time we can breathe,
breathe, breathe, breathe,
breathe and work to find ease in
getting that front
knee over the front ankle.
If you're there and your
practicing the session and you
want to stick with it,
I'm gonna give you something
to work with too.
Go ahead and walk
that left knee back. Right?
Walk the left knee back.
Then, everyone, take a look
down and just notice what's
happening in your fingertips.
Are they turning
a different color?
Can you become a little bit
lighter on the fingertips and
what needs to happen
in order for you to become
light on the fingertips?
For me, I need to
check in with my core.
I need to find
length in my spine.
I need to squeeze the inner
thighs together towards the
mid-line so I can
really find that connection.
Alright?
And then, from here, we're
gonna curl the left toes under,
inhale in.
Exhale, lift the back knee.
Alright, continue
to breathe deep.
And now here comes
the question of the day.
The question to
ask yourself here is,
"Am I working harder
than I need to?"
So how do I balance
my effort with ease?
So I'm pulling the
right hip crease back here.
I'm trying to stay
light on the fingertips.
I'm waking up my legs.
That's waking up
my hips, my glutes,
all the way up
through the spine.
I'm keeping a nice, long neck
but then where can I find ease?
Where can I soften?
Alright, where can I marry a
little grace to the strength
that I'm building?
Take one more
deep breath in here.
You're doin' awesome.
Good and then exhale,
slow and steady,
lower that back
knee to the ground.
Awesome.
We'll come on to the hands.
We're gonna slowly come
back to that Tabletop Position.
Nice and just take a second here
to find soft, easy movement.
If you want to do a
Child's Pose here, you can.
Alright, and now Downward Dog
practice number two.
Walk the hands out.
Here we go.
Curl the toes under.
So find that hand to
earth connection first.
Externally rotate
through the shoulders.
When you're ready,
claw through the fingertips,
peel up from the hip creases.
Lift the hips up high and back.
Now make sure you're not holding
or gripping in the
head or the neck here.
Soft and easy
and for this round,
I'm gonna invite you to turn
your toes inward just bit so you
feel this inner rotation
of the ankle, the shin,
the kneecap,
the tops of the thighs
all the way to that hip socket.
Then draw your navel in and up.
And don't worry about your heels
touching the ground but think
about your heels reaching
towards the ground and notice
if that changes anything
in the shoulders, the torso.
Good, now come
back to your breath.
You're doing great.
Claw through the fingertips.
Inhale in.
Exhale out.
Inhale in one more breath.
And then exhale to
slowly lower to the knees.
Awesome work.
Great, from here reset,
curl the left toes back.
Excuse me, curl the left toes
under, kick that left foot back.
And then when
you're ready, lift it up.
Exhale, bend the left knee,
slow and steady bring it all the
way up into your lunge.
Again, you can use our theme
today of kind of finding ease
even in the transitions.
So if this is
a difficult transition,
make it work for you.
Try not to get 
too judgmental. Right?
Be kind to yourself.
We're here.
We're doin' it.
We're exploring.
And we will make progress in
some way if we keep showing up.
Alright?
So first thing's first,
just find some soft,
easy movement here and let's
find our action and alignment.
So we have this
action of pressing into
all four corners of the feet.
We want to stack the front
knee over the front ankle.
Gently pull the
left hip crease back.
Back knee is on the ground.
If we want a little more,
we can walk the right knee back.
If you're brand
new to the practice,
you don't need to worry
about that move, I think.
Just breathe 'cause
you're probably feeling a big,
big, big stretch in the
groin and in the hip creases.
Alright, now from here,
checking in with the breath.
Growing a little bit lighter
on the fingertips to wake up
the core, to kind of
stimulate this full body,
this whole body approach.
And then when you're ready,
curl the right toes under,
take a deep breath in.
And on an exhale, 
we'll lift the back knee up.
Really, really reach that right
heel towards the back edge.
Front knee stays over the front
ankle and the body might start
to go into a little panic 
mode, so what do we do?
We use the breath.
We lengthen through the spine.
We think of the body
as one moving part.
So what little minor
adjustments can we make
to find a little more ease?
Asking the question of the day:
"Am I working harder
than I need to?"
So we find that effort to
support ourselves and then we
marry it with a
little bit of ease.
So that you can feel good while
working through the relaxing
moments but you can also
feel good or feel like you're in
control as you're working
through the challenging moments.
Again, this idea of 
working with your body,
not on it.
Working for yourself,
not against.
Alright, one more
deep breath in.
You're doin' awesome.
Use an exhale to slowly lower
the right knee to the earth.
Phew, awesome work.
Come on to the palms.
We'll slowly bring the
left knee all the way back.
Take a second here.
Little breather.
If you want to come
off the wrists, you can.
Nice and easy.
Alright, our third Downward Dog.
Walk the palms forward,
curl the toes under,
lift the hips up high,
peel 'em back.
Excellent, so we have
the external rotation
in the shoulders.
We have this internal
rotation in the lower body
and in the
legs and the hips.
For this one now, send your
gaze towards your belly button.
Send your gaze
towards your belly button.
Then draw your belly button, see
if you can draw it up to your
spine to engage the
muscles of your core.
Hug the low ribs in.
Great, reach down
through the heels,
claw through the fingertips.
Return to the sound
of your breath here.
You got this, big inhale in.
And then long breath out.
Big inhale in.
And slowly lower to the
knees as you breathe out.
Awesome.
Inhale, kick the right
foot all the way out.
Exhale, step it all the
way up into your lunge.
Great, this time we're gonna
interlace the fingertips and
bring them to the
top of the thigh.
So we're building up.
Building from the ground up.
Even here, am I working
harder than I need to?
Am I kind of
huffing and puffing?
Can I start to
soften through the face,
use my breath and just
take it nice and slow, baby?
Working to get front
knee over the front ankle.
Always remembering to
build from the ground up.
So even that back foot
here I'm pressing down firmly.
Great, then you can
stay here or actually,
let's all do this bit first.
So take your hands
and we're gonna pull the
right hip crease
back in space.
And you can even peek
at me if you need to.
So here's just me kind
of dumping into my hip.
I'm gonna pull
that right femur back,
that right hip socket,
getting really snuggily.
And what that does is it also
allows me to find more length
in the front body here.
Alright?
So try to maintain that
and you can stay here,
hands on top of the thigh or
we can reach
the fingertips forward,
plug the shoulders back,
and then continue the
journey all the way up.
Palms facing together.
Beautiful, breathing deep here.
If you feel really
tight in the shoulders,
give yourself a
little more space up here.
Maybe coming to a V.
Awesome.
Breathing deep here, inhale in.
Exhale, everyone release.
Let's bring the fingertips
to the mat for stability.
Okay, building on.
From here with
fingertips on the mat,
not too much weight in the
fingertips so starting to
wake up the core even
in the smallest way,
I'm gonna take my back foot,
I'm gonna turn it to
the outer edge of the mat.
So I'm taking it to the
right side, right to the lip.
I'm rotating in the
left hip while keeping
this front knee stacked.
Good, then from here,
I'm gonna lift up.
Ground through that front leg.
Use what you got so press into
that front foot and I'm gonna
bring the right elbow to
the top of the right thigh.
Left hand's gonna come to the
waistline and I'm gonna breathe
here, just checking it out.
For some, you'll go right there.
For others it's like, "Wow,
I haven't felt this spiral in
"connection to my hips in
a long time if maybe ever."
Just breathing deep.
And if you have been here before
and you're feelin' pretty good,
then start again, start to
find the little nuances.
Play with that femur drawing in.
Maybe tailbone lengthening down.
Playing with some
of the details here.
Finding that Sukha or that ease.
Noticing what muscles are
turning on for you, okay.
That's plenty to work with.
Alright, so with the left
hand on the waistline here,
I'm just gonna notice the
sensation of my front body.
Do I feel like I'm kind
of splaying out here or
do I feel connected?
Can I hug the low ribs in?
Then everyone take your left
hand to your right rib cage and
you're just gonna 
drag your left hand
across the rib cage here.
You can almost maybe give
yourself of smearing some honey
across and just see if
that opens up the chest
a little more towards the sky.
Great, then notice if the 
front foot has started to turn
or the ankle started to sickle.
It's okay if it does.
Just notice.
Woo, yeah.
There's a lot going on here even
without the back leg lifting.
And then option to send the left
fingertips up towards the sky.
Big opening here
in the left pec.
Or all the way up
and overhead towards
the front edge of your mat.
So just to give you an
idea of where it's going,
you can peek at me and the full
posture the back leg is lifted,
the hips are
open and we're here.
So we're working
on the fundamentals.
Making sure we're checking in
with the sensation of each shape
before we get too
far ahead of ourselves.
Okay, inhale in here.
Exhale, bring the left
hand back to the waistline.
Great, slowly come up.
We're just gonna bring
the fingertips back
down to the earth.
Bring that left foot all
the way towards the back edge.
Everyone inhale, look forward.
And then exhale,
just counter pose here,
we're gonna peel the
right hip crease back,
flex the right
toes towards the face.
Good, bend your
right knee generously.
Relax the weight
of your head over.
You're doin' the
good work, inhale in.
Nice and then exhale, rolling
all the way back through.
Just plant the palms
nice and easy here.
Nothing too fancy.
You're gonna come
back to all fours.
Okey doke, walk the hands out,
curl the toes under, inhale in.
Exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
So putting all the
pieces together here.
Downward Dog.
Finding all the places
in which we can connect.
Thinking of the body
as one moving part
working together.
It's all connected.
Great, take a
deep breath in here.
You're doin' awesome.
And exhale, slow descend.
Try to create a soft landing
with the knees, so with control.
Excellent, inhale,
kick the left foot out.
Exhale, step it all the way up.
Take your time
getting it up there.
Beautiful,
fingertips come to the mat.
We hang here for a second.
Front knee over front ankle.
Find your breath, pull
the left hip crease back.
Then when you're ready
use your fingertips on
the ground to stabilize you.
You're gonna lift the right foot
and bring it over towards the
left edge of your mat.
So big hip openers here.
So pay attention, breathe deep.
Breathe into your belly,
particularly if you're feeling
any tightness in the low back.
Breathe into that belly.
It's gonna help move the hips.
Send that breath
downward (laughs).
Alright, and when you're
ready, here we go, lifting up.
Press into your foundation.
Left elbow to the
top of the left thigh.
Right fingertips to
the right waistline.
So I'm hugging this
left thigh bone up and in.
I'm pressing firmly down through
my right shin, right foot.
Then you can stay here or
maybe smearing the honey.
Right hand comes to
the left rib and we open,
open, open, open,
open up towards the sky.
Maybe hand stays on the
waistline here or we continue up
towards the Heavens,
reaching fingertips.
Should feel big
sensation in the right oblique,
the right side body,
the right pec.
Drawing the shoulder
blades in and together
for a little support.
Pressing into the earth.
Maybe taking the right
fingertips up and overhead here.
Nice long, beautiful neck.
There is a tendency for us
to collapse in the neck here.
Left ear to left shoulder
so keep the crown reaching.
Keep that length.
Good, inhale in.
Exhale, slowly bring the
right hand all the way
back to the waistline.
Navel draws in.
We're gonna slowly
dial it back to the lunge.
Fingertips come to the earth.
We bring the right
foot back around.
Here's our counter pose.
Inhale in, exhale, pull the
left hip crease back, way back.
Keep a nice bend in
your left knee here.
And just saying hello,
a loving hello to your body.
Waking it up again.
This will be just the perfect
fundamentals practice to kind of
get back to it or to start
a new at-home yoga practice.
And when you're ready,
rolling through.
Awesome work.
Bring the palms to the earth.
Step the left knee back.
Alright.
From here we're gonna
spread the palms super wide.
You're gonna walk the knees
together, really together.
We're coming into Half Plank
here before we cool it down.
So we're gonna come forward.
Shoulders are going to go over
the wrists here and if you're
already in a place today in your
body where you want to work in
full Plank,
you certainly can here.
Alright, so shoulders
over the wrists.
The fingertips are
spread super wide.
Upper arm bones rotate out.
If you're in the full Plank
really reach your heels
towards the back edge.
Reach the crown of the head
towards the front, everyone.
And see if you can think
of this straight line from
the crown to the tail.
So no dipping with 
the belly and the low back
and no arch with 
the booty sticking out.
So just play with
that here a little bit.
Tug the shoulders
away from the ears.
Maybe you're on the knees and
want to take a breath in full
Plank, lifting the knees up.
Just see what happens.
It's a great way to
turn on your center,
to turn on the abdominal wall.
We're breathing here.
For four.
Three.
Two.
And on the one, slowly
lower everything to the ground.
Nice and easy.
Great, drag your hands
in line with the ribcage.
Press into that which
is touching the earth.
So press your pubic
bone into the earth.
Press the tops of the
feet into the earth.
Tuck the chin and whatever you
do let's focus on keeping nice,
soft, easy, breezy
energy in the neck
so no crunching of the neck.
Squeeze the elbows
into the side body.
Inhale in.
Just lift up enough that you
feel the muscles of your back
turn on and we don't
crunch the back of the neck.
Good, a little Baby Cobra here.
Working steadily.
Alright, release.
Forehead kisses the earth.
Two more like that.
Inhale from your
foundation, engage.
And just lift up enough that
you feel the muscles of the back
and no fussiness in the neck.
Good, and exhale
forehead kisses the mat.
And once more, here we go.
Inhale, lift up, this time I'm
gonna give you a little friendly
challenge of lifting the hands,
turning the palms face up and
just notice, "Can I hold myself?
Is this sustainable?
"Or was I working a lot
harder than I need to?
"Can I back off a
little bit and come here?"
Building that strength,
mindfully marrying the
ease with the effort.
Good, palms come to the earth.
We'll release.
Go ahead and press back onto all
fours and take a Child's Pose.
Knees together or knees wide.
Fingertips reaching forward or
this time you can try reaching
the fingertips back all
the way towards the feet.
Awesome work.
Take a deep breath in.
And empty it out.
Then again, a deep breath in.
And empty it out.
Close your eyes.
One more time,
inhale lots of love in.
And exhale lots of love out.
Just take one more
moment here to relax, to rest.
Who knew?
Back to basics.
So much there.
I have so many friends and
colleagues that we're just
constantly talking about the
power of returning to the
basics, to the 
fundamentals of ease
and how often we're working a 
lot harder than we need to be.
And what if we could get good
at finding ease
in challenging moments?
Imagine what that could
do for us off the yoga mat
and in our everyday.
Gently drag the hands back up.
Come up to a nice,
comfortable seat of your choice.
If you want, you have
a little time today,
I invite you to lie
down on the ground just
for a couple
minutes or more.
So come back to this video
especially if you found some
difficulty today, come back to
this video and then maybe let it
be inspiration to continue on
to some other beginner videos or
foundational videos.
And just try to keep an
open mind and show up with a
willingness to learn
rather than master.
I hope to see you again soon.
Let's take a deep breath in.
Bring your palms together at
your heart and as you exhale,
close your eyes.
Just give thanks for your body,
for this opportunity to connect
mind and the body and
the breath or the spirit
so that you can feel good.
We want ya feelin' good.
Whenever possible.
Let's take one more
deep breath in together.
And exhale to close it and bow.
Namaste.
(upbeat music)
