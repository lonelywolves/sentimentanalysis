- Hi, everyone.
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 28.
Nourish.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alrighty, my beautiful darling,
wonderful, gorgeous friend.
Let's begin in a nice,
comfortable seat.
Way to show up today.
Woo!
Here we are together again.
Let's bring the 
hands to the belly.
And sit up tall.
And look,
just notice how you
feel when you hold your belly.
I tend to feel a 
lot of different things
depending on the day.
But in light of today's theme,
let's go there.
Let's hold our bellies.
Let's close the eyes.
Let's tuck the chin slightly,
just find a gentle, 
reverent bow.
And let's allow this time
to serve.
The journey home 
is about simplifying
and peeling back
the layers of the onion.
Those parts, those habits
that we have that take away.
And then we create space and
more awareness and even have
more energy to notice the habits
and the patterns that nourish.
Right? So the idea is that we
start or continue to build
sustainable practices, 
sustainable rituals that serve.
And that's not just 
your daily morning ritual.
It's in our thought patterns.
And literally in the 
way that we hold ourselves,
hold space for ourselves
but also here, a little bit of
metaphor for holding the belly.
If you haven't already, 
start to deepen your breath.
Send breath down 
into the diaphragm,
down into the belly.
Let it be loving,
let it be full.
And then use your exhale to
soften and relax your shoulders.
Then gently bat 
the eyelashes open.
We're gonna bring the fingertips
slowly now to the shoulders.
That's what that's called.
And here we go. Keep that 
directional breath going.
So breathe down into your belly
as you bring the 
elbows together to kiss.
And then reach 'em all the way
up and around and back down.
Continue.
Inhale to come forward.
Elbows kiss and go up,
around and down.
Woo! Yes.
Maybe those shoulders 
are a little crunchy today.
Inhale all the way up.
Around and down.
And one more time, 
inhale all the way up.
Around and down.
Stay here.
Inhale in, exhale, 
you're gonna twist to the left.
Inhale through center.
Exhale, twist to the right.
Now start to pick up the pace.
Find a sharp exhale.
Each time you twist.
Head, heart and 
belly all in alignment.
For three, two and one.
Release, come 
forward onto all fours.
Benji, excuse me, darling.
Pardon me, pardon me.
Spread the palms, knees 
come underneath the hips.
(chuckles) Benji's settled.
And here we go, we're 
gonna start with Cat Pose.
Rounding up through the spine.
Cat Pose for 
three to five breaths.
So think about hugging your
lower belly all the way up to
your spine here.
If you want, 
you can come onto fists.
Crown releases to the earth.
Navel up to the spine.
Breathe deep.
And then coming back to
a nice neutral spine, beautiful.
Bump the hips to the left,
turn your gaze to look 
past your right shoulder.
Hey, Benji.
And then all the 
way through center.
Bump the hips to the right,
turn your gaze to look
past your left shoulder.
Hey, buddy.
Back to center.
Drop the elbows 
where the hands once were.
Walk the knees back.
Really allow your tailbone, 
your coccyx to tilt up towards
the sky as you melt your 
heart to the earth here.
Forehead comes towards the mat.
Maybe it kisses the mat.
Anahatasan, Heart to Earth Pose.
You should feel big 
opening in the upper back body.
Elbows stay rooted, my friends.
Don't let 'em come out.
Forearms parallel 
like two railroad tracks.
Breathe deep here.
There's a lot going on.
Breathe into the rib cage,
feel it expand on the inhale.
And soften on the exhale.
Here we go, hug the low 
ribs in, navel draws up.
We're gonna carve 
a line with the nose
to come all the way forward.
Slide into home, eh?
Eh? Here we go, Sphinx Pose.
Lifting the chest forward.
Careful not to crunch in the 
back of the neck, nice and easy.
From here, inhale in.
Exhale, maybe 
grow a little taller.
Long through the neck.
Good, then we're gonna 
interlace to fingertips,
keep the elbows where they are.
Interlace the fingertips here,
curl the toes under,
inhale in.
Exhale like a 
rocket ship navel draws up.
Hollow front body as you 
come in to forearm Plank.
Strong and steady here.
You got this.
Building strength, full body 
strength here mindfully.
So elbows are right 
underneath the shoulders.
Okay, we're gonna just kiss the
right knee to the earth here,
just the right knee, 
and then lift it back up.
Kiss the left knee to the
earth and then lift it back up.
Right knee and then left.
Gaze straight down, 
right knee and then left.
Now, listen carefully, 
both knees kiss and back up.
Reach the heels back, way back,
both knees kiss
and then back up.
Reach the heels back.
Last one, you got it.
Both knees kiss and 
reach the heels back.
You're here for three, two and
slowly on the one bend the knees
bring them underneath you.
Good, curl the toes under,
sorry, and send 
the hips back. Ah.
You can come to a steeple
grip here if it feels right.
Index fingers pointing forward.
So what could it mean if someone
invited you to send breath to
the soles of your feet.
And you feel like, 
"That means nothing to me."
That's all right.
Everyone try to 
press into your pinky toes.
We're here for one more breath.
Beautiful.
From center 
navel draws up and in.
That's where we move from as
we come all the 
way back to all fours.
Walk the knees back 
and when you're ready,
peel the hips up high,
Downward Facing Dog.
Claw through the fingertips.
On your next inhale, 
lift the right leg up.
Exhale, bring it 
all the way through.
Back knee lowers.
You can walk it back 
for a deeper stretch.
And here we go, we're gonna
bring the palms together
and rise up here.
Nice low lunge 
with the palms together
Anjuli Mudra at the heart.
So, pay attention.
Are we just kind of dumping
all of the energy in here or
can we kind of create an all
systems go effect using our
training, our practice 
thus far to find support?
Alright, inhale to 
reach the fingertips up.
Exhale, think up and over as you
bring the outer edge of the left
elbow to the outer 
edge of the right knee.
Palms can come back together or
today you can take the bottom
hand to a fist and 
bring the right hand on top.
And that just creates a little
nice fulcrum for you to find a
push and a pull 
here in your twist.
Stay here. Breathing into your 
belly loving, loving breaths.
Or we can start to lift.
Pay attention, Adriene,
find your center.
We can start to 
lift the back knee.
Really reaching 
that left heel back.
Just like we did 
in forearm Plank.
Final option here today might
be to layer on opening up your
wingspan, bringing the 
left fingertips to the earth
and right fingertips 
up toward the sky.
Play, breathe deep.
Breathe into your belly.
And then float it all back down.
Take your time, 
come back to your lunge.
Take a deep breath 
in to look forward.
And then exhale 
right back to Downward Dog.
Great work.
Second side.
Stay focused.
Inhale, lift the 
left leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward.
Step it up.
Lower the right knee down.
Go ahead and walk 
it back just a bit.
Oh, yeah.
Mhmmm.
Then find your center,
find connection,
that support, right?
So we're not just 
swinging ourselves up.
Right?
We're using our integration.
We're using all of our 
training in the practice thus
far to move a certain way
so that the 
practice brings us the
nourishing benefits that
feel good versus taking away.
Like, have you ever gone to a
yoga class and then left like
feeling really loco, crazy?
I have.
Lift the sternum up.
Here we go.
More on that later.
So pressing firmly into all
four corners of your left foot.
Here we go.
Inhale, reach the 
fingertips up high.
Find length.
Think up and over.
Outer edge of 
the right arm comes
to the outer edge 
of the left thigh.
Maybe you take, say, maybe you
take the right hand to a fist,
left hand on top.
Lots of options here.
Breathing deep into the belly.
Breathing into that low back.
Then maybe we have 
everything kind of turned on,
(clicks tongue) hey-oh!
Maybe we use that connection to
experiment with lifting the back
knee, reaching right 
heel all the way back.
And maybe you work with
opening up the wingspan 
today and maybe not.
Breathing.
Meeting your comfortable edge.
You got this.
Meeting your appropriate edge.
Let's not say "comfortable."
Meeting your appropriate edge.
Yes.
Then when you're ready,
float it back down 
to the lunge, regroup.
Keep that back 
knee lifted if you can.
We got this.
Inhale, look forward.
Exhale to plant the palms.
Step it to Downward Facing Dog.
Yes.
Inhale in.
Exhale to let it go.
(sighs)
Awesome.
Tuck the chin, roll all 
the way through to Plank.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale to lower to the belly.
Inhale, press into 
the tops of the feet.
Find your foundation.
Rise up, Cobra.
And exhale to float back down.
Awesome, from here,
listen carefully,
you're gonna really find the
pubic bone to earth connection.
We're gonna point the toes,
engage the quads.
Nice. Then we're gonna 
come up onto the elbows
just like we did in Sphinx.
Bus stop one.
From here, we're 
gonna bend the left knee,
reach the left fingertips
back to grab the left ankle.
Then here we go, 
bend the right knee,
reach the right fingertips,
maybe grab the right ankle.
Then from here, draw the
shoulder blades together
down the back body.
Begin to flex the feet.
And as if you were pressing
the soles of your feet up to the
ceiling, inhale in, 
exhale, kick the legs out.
Send the soles of the 
feet up towards the ceiling.
Gaze is straight down.
Neck nice and long.
No need to crunch here.
Now, knees are gonna 
want to splay out here.
Try to keep them 
in line with the hips.
Inhale in.
Exhale, kick.
Inhale in.
Exhale, kick.
Great. Now you can point 
the toes here, if you like.
Inhale in, exhale, kick out.
And one more time.
Inhale in, exhale, kick out.
Nice.
Slowly release.
Allow your 
limbs to float slowly,
gently to the earth.
Take a second here.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Breathe in.
Rise up to all fours.
Exhale, walk your 
knees together and in.
Don't go to 
Child's Pose just yet.
With the toes 
curled under or not
we're gonna 
send the hips back.
You're gonna come to sit up
tall through the spine first.
Take a cycle of breath here.
Let the spine be long and tall.
And now, Balasana, Child's Pose.
So after the back bend, 
take a second to sit up tall
and then come 
into the Forward Fold.
Close your eyes, relax the
weight of your shoulders down
and let's start 
to cool off a little.
Listen to the 
sound of your breath.
Let it be audible here.
Truly.
Find that Ujjayi Breath, 
find that victorious breath,
that ocean breath even 
if it's just one big sigh.
Please, dear one, listen to
the sound of your breath here.
Then tuck the chin.
We're slowly rollin' up.
If being on the knees 
is not great for you here,
you can come to 
cross-legged seat right now.
We're gonna take 
a twist to the left
in the cross-legged 
seat or here.
A little counter 
twist to the left.
Notice how you feel.
And then twist to the right.
Same thing.
Notice how you feel.
And then back to center.
Can turn the palms face up.
Again, come to 
a cross-legged seat
if that feels better 
for you here.
Let's turn the palms face up
just in the effort 
to receive the benefits.
Of our practice, 
of our time here together.
Close your eyes.
And I invite you 
to just feel or ask,
rather, what if it were 
true that the practice or the
practices that 
you cultivate each day
are there to support you,
to nourish you, right?
To give back, not to take away.
And I think 
understanding or
considering that as true,
as being true, this is kind of 
part of the first step because
some of us don't even realize 
how we've put up roadblocks
(chuckles) to not even receive
the gifts of the things that,
that give back to us.
I love you so much.
I look forward to 
seeing you tomorrow.
As you're ready, 
bring the palms together.
Let's bring it right 
to the heart today.
Keeping open mind, open heart.
Ready to receive the 
gifts that come our way.
Things that nourish 
us and help us feel good.
When you feel nourished and good
then you're gonna be in the best
position to serve others.
Help them feel the same.
Take a deep breath in.
We'll close with a 
deep bow and whisper
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
