-What's up, everyone?
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 14 and 
today we focus on
the return.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alrighty, my darling friends,
let's begin today's 
practice on our backs.
Yay!
Come on down on the ground.
Bring the feet as wide as your
mat when you get there and allow
your knees to 
fall in towards center.
Want to come 
into a place where
you can really 
relax your body here.
We call this a 
constructive resting pose
and I feel like it's 
an appropriate pose to
begin our return practice.
When you get there 
tuck the chin slightly,
lengthen through the neck and
then go ahead 
and close your eyes.
Allow the sound of 
my voice to guide you.
Way to show up.
I admire you.
I honor you and your time.
And, you know, it's true,
the hardest part is showing up.
However,
now that we are here,
let's remember 
what this is all about.
If you set out to 
welcome transformation
or if your intention
included you making
changes in your body
or your lifestyle, 
even in your mind,
consider this.
In the philosophy of yoga, 
we're not actually trying to
ever work towards a goal 
of becoming someone
or something that 
we are not already.
We are already that thing.
That which we desire,
we already possess.
So if this is a new concept,
just let it kind of wash over
you as you breathe in here.
Maybe it's a remembrance today,
a reminder.
We are not trying to step out
and conform or change
or embody somebody else's 
version of ourselves
but we're walking home.
Back to the self 
that already exists.
A return
to home,
a return to what feels good,
what feels true.
I find this a beautiful 
message right before
we hit our halfway 
mark on this journey.
May it inspire you.
May it serve as
food for thought.
And may you enjoy this beautiful
practice devoted to 
yummy hip work. (chuckles)
Alright, go ahead 
and open your eyes.
Take a deep breath in.
And let it all hang out.
Breathe out, 
relax your shoulders.
Beautiful, as you're ready
you're gonna walk the heels in
line with the hips.
And we're gonna 
take just the right knee,
just the right knee in, 
squeeze it up into the chest.
Good, extend your 
left leg out long.
So you have one leg in,
one leg out.
Take a deep breath in.
And on an exhale, peel your
nose up towards your knee.
Good.
Inhale, lower the head down.
Exhale, peel your left knee up.
Plant your left 
foot on the ground.
You're gonna guide 
your right ankle over
to cross atop 
the left thigh. (laughs)
Great, thread the needle.
Right fingertips are 
gonna go in through this hole,
hey-oh, and we're 
gonna lift the left leg up
and create this 
beautiful Reclined Pigeon.
And I'd like to invite you to
first establish some energy in
your toes, in your feet.
And then once you've done that,
you're safe to play with soft,
easy movement here.
Listen to this 
sound of your breath.
And take one more inhale in.
Maybe you squeeze 
the legs a little
further up towards your heart.
And then slowly release.
Beautiful, unravel.
Bring the left knee up in
towards the chest squeeze and
when you're ready, 
extend the right leg out long.
Inhale in here, 
breathe into your belly.
Nice and easy exhale, 
navel draws down
and we peel the nose
up towards the left knee.
Try to keep your 
shoulders relaxed,
soft and easy in the face.
Great and then 
slowly we'll lower the head,
the neck, the shoulders down.
Lift your right knee up, plant
your right foot on the earth,
and we'll guide the left ankle
across the top 
of the right thigh.
And when you're ready lifting
up here, thread the needle.
Keep your feet bright.
That just means 
energized through the feet.
That way, when you get here,
you find your little bind,
you can find 
soft, easy movement
and keep the joints protected.
Breathe deep here.
If this is a new shape, you can
imagine pressing your right foot
into an imaginary wall.
And then squeezing the 
legs up in towards your heart.
Let's all take one 
more deep breath in here.
Inhale.
And exhale to release 
right foot to the earth,
unravel left to the earth.
Gorgeous.
Hands come to the earth here.
We're gonna walk the 
heels up for a Bridge Pose.
Inhale, ground through 
the feet, lift the hips.
This can be 
nice and small today.
You're gonna shimmy 
their shoulder blades together.
If you want to 
get up high, go for it.
But feel that compression 
in the upper back body,
grounding through all 
four corners of the feet.
And we're here for 
one more big inhale.
Feel the rise of the inhalation
and the fall as you lower the
hips with the exhale.
Great.
From here we're gonna 
lift the knees up to the chest,
you're gonna bring your hands
to the backs of the thighs,
and we're gonna slowly rock and
roll up and down 
the length of the spine.
You can do it once or twice,
three times a lady.
(laughs) So dumb.
I've done that 
joke way too many times.
Okay.
As many times as 
feels right for you.
Give it a little rock and roll.
And if you're like, 
"How about no times?"
Then just make your 
way up to all fours.
That's where I'll meet ya.
And from here, bring the
wrists underneath the shoulders.
Really returning to 
this idea of being really
attentive in the asana, right?
This attention to detail.
You know, God is in the details
or the devil's in the details.
I'll let you decide which one.
When you get here, 
press away from your yoga mat.
Lift your heart space up between
your shoulder blades so you kind
of feel your shoulder 
blades move left to right.
Excellent.
Then from here, 
inhale in, exhale,
you're going to lift the
right foot up towards the sky.
And we're just gonna draw big
circles with the right knee,
one way and then 
eventually the other way.
Take your time.
There's gonna be a tendency
to lean to the 
left side, of course.
Naturally, there will be a
little bit of that but see if
you can try to press 
into both palms evenly.
Alright, 
reverse the circle here.
Carving big lines through space.
Opening up through the hips but
we're also engaging the muscles,
the low belly, 
toning the abdominal wall,
building strength and stability
to support the spinal column.
Yes, okay, and here we go.
Then we'll lower 
the right knee down
and shift to the other side.
You can reestablish this lift
up through the upper back body
here, soft bend in the 
elbows and then here we go,
inhale, lift the 
left foot up high.
And then we'll 
start big circles one way.
Building strength, 
toning the arms here.
Engaging that left oblique.
Pressing firmly into 
the top of your right foot.
Go ahead and reverse the circle.
Return to your breath.
So as we really 
stir the pot here today,
you might anchor
your thoughts by 
choosing something specific
you want to return to.
Eating healthy?
Listening to your body?
Walking, jogging, running?
Quality time with someone or
something that's not your phone?
Love?
Alright, release it.
Bring the big toes together,
knees as wide as the yoga mat.
Inhale to drop the belly,
look forward,
tailbone goes 
up towards the sky.
You can give you a little wag,
a little wiggle if you like.
Hope somebody 
makes a gif of this.
Is it gif or jif?
I don't know.
Child's Pose, 
Extended Child's Pose,
send it back.
So forehead to the earth,
heart melts back.
Return to the 
sound of your breath.
Don't worry about the
gif or the jif, sorry about it.
What made me think of that those
I keep seeing them on Twitter.
But how about we return 
to the sound of the breath?
Me and you both, kid.
This is what yoga's all about.
It's like acknowledging the
thought and then coming back.
Acknowledging 
and then returning.
And it's quite a beautiful
practice because it says,
yeah, of course, you're going
to fall off the horse, babe.
But it's how quickly and how
gracefully we allow ourselves to
acknowledge that and return.
Game changer.
Inhale to look forward, 
carve a line with the nose.
Here we go.
We're gonna come 
all the way back up.
We're gonna walk the 
knees underneath the hip points,
press into your fingerprints,
press into your knuckles,
curl the toes under and lift
the hips up high and back.
Downward Facing Dog.
So take a second to 
decide what feels awesome here.
Maybe it's soft, easy movement.
Maybe it's some 
exquisite stillness today.
Nice, long, full 
deep breaths in and out.
Notice how you feel.
Now take a deep breath in here.
Let's tuck the chin and we're
gonna roll all the way forward.
We're gonna bend our right knee
and take it all the way up into
our nice low lunge.
So plant your right foot.
Then back knee's 
gonna come to the earth
and we're gonna take 
the right hand bring it over
towards the left 
side of the mat.
And then use that as your
stability to walk the right foot
out closer 
towards the right edge.
We're gonna allow the right toes
to turn out and the toes and the
knee they're pointing 
in the same direction here.
So we're in a nice no, 
that's a tongue twister.
We are in a nice 
low Lizard variation.
(clicks tongue)
And if you're 
wanting a little bit of heat,
a little fire today, 
then I got your back.
Just lift the back knee.
(chuckles)
Send your left heel 
towards the back edge.
Another option here is 
to come onto the forearms.
Keep those elbows 
underneath the shoulders.
So we have a couple
of variations here
and they all require
deep, loving, full breath.
So check it out.
And then slowly lower the back
knee to the earth if it's lifted
and let's all press 
back up to our hands.
Then you're gonna inhale,
take your right hand,
bring it right in front of you
as if it was on like a counter.
And then you're gonna bend the
right elbow and you're gonna
smooth your hand across this
counter and just take it all the
way towards the 
back edge of your mat.
Great, inhale, 
open up through the chest.
Exhale, slide it 
all the way back.
Beautiful.
We're gonna walk 
the right foot in,
frame the foot 
with the hands again,
lift the back knee 
and just press it right back
to Downward Facing Dog.
Oh, yes.
Deep breath in.
Long breath out.
So take a second to 
pay attention to the hands.
Return your awareness to that.
We really tend to be a little
bit too narrow I'm finding a lot
in just,
in almost everywhere
I practice and share practice.
So give yourself a 
nice wide base here.
Pinkies are really 
touching the edges of the mat,
upper arm bones 
are rotating out.
Inner thighs have 
the opposite spiral.
They're rotating in 
and out towards
the back edge of your mat.
Great, tuck the chin.
Let's roll it forward.
Left knee comes 
along for the ride.
We step the left 
foot all the way up.
Nice and slow, easing into it.
Dropping the right 
knee to the earth softly.
Then bringing that left
hand around to meet the right.
Use the hands here on 
the earth as your stability
to open up 
through that left hip.
Left foot opening, 
toes towards the left edge,
knee in the same alignment.
Take your time here,
particularly if you've 
been here before, actually.
Just take it nice and slow.
I find myself kind of catching,
just catching a hold 
of all my patterns.
I'll be in class 
and I'm like, well,
I know I can do this, 
so I'm going to do it.
But I kind of miss that,
that, just the process seems so
simple, but I miss that
magic moment of a process.
Slow it down 
essentially to summarize
and back knee 
can be lowered back.
Back knee can be lifted.
And the forearms can come down.
Just keeping attention mostly to
the pace at which you're moving.
This idea of returning to
Ms. Beginner's mind.
If the back knee is lifted,
go ahead and let it 
kiss the ground softly.
We'll come back 
up onto our hands.
Take a deep breath in.
Make sure you're not just
collapsing in your bones here
but lifting up and out.
And we'll take the left hand up,
bring it right in front of the
heart space, palm face down.
Inhale in.
Exhale, you're gonna smooth
across and all the way back.
There's an opportunity here to
maybe lift the 
sternum a little more.
Inhale, open the chest.
And then exhale, slide it back.
Great, walk the left 
foot back into center.
We'll frame the left foot
with both hands and when you're
ready, Downward Facing Dog
hips up and back once again.
Nice. Deep breath in.
And exhale, both 
knees kiss the earth.
Great, tuck the chin.
Start to roll it forward but
take your right knee with you as
we bring it all the 
way up and in for
a One-Legged Pigeon here now.
We're gonna walk the 
right heel all the way up and
then walk the left 
leg all the way back.
But here's the deal, same
thing, if you're kind of used to
working towards 
this right ankle,
angle, (chuckles)
Freudian slip, just kidding.
See what happens 
if you bring it in.
Pull the right hip crease back.
We are gonna take a 
look back at that left foot.
But today, let's look 
past our right shoulder.
So the root of this posture
really is in this back foot.
Dig, dig, dig.
Inhale, we rise up.
Maybe it's in 
your practice today,
maybe not to hug the low ribs
in and bring the palms together,
Anjuli Mudra at the heart.
Everyone keep your feet bright,
toes engaged.
And we might stay lifted or
we might start to melt 
forehead down to earth.
Maybe forearms come down, 
maybe fingertips reach out.
Make it your own here.
You do want to soften the jaw,
soften the skin of the forehead.
And let's make 
a commitment here,
three to five breaths.
Returning to your heart's song.
Listening to the inhalation.
And listening to the exhale.
Let your next inhale 
be your cue to
start finding 
soft, easy movement.
And then let the 
exhale be what brings you up.
Mhmmm.
Check it out.
We're gonna shift onto 
the right hip, right glute.
We're gonna slowly 
swing ol' left leg around.
Come on now.
And we're gonna plant 
the left foot on the ground
outside the right knee.
If the left foot doesn't come
all the way to the ground,
that's okay.
I'm here to guide
kind of the intention, right?
Not to really 
crack the whip anyway
so just do your best.
If it does come to the ground,
though however,
press into all four 
corners of the feet.
So we're gonna use that.
Good, then we'll 
interlace the fingertips.
Bring them just 
below the left knee,
sit up nice and tall.
Inhale in, if your hips 
are talking to you here,
just stay here.
Otherwise, we'll keep 
the left hand where it is,
reach the right 
fingertips all the way up
and find a little twist.
Outer edge of the
right elbow coming
to the outer edge
of the left knee.
Open up through the chest.
Keep it soft and easy.
No cranking, no pushing,
no jerking yourself
around here, alright?
Beautiful.
Then slowly we'll unravel,
nice and easy.
We're just gonna come out of it
just the same way we came into
it so we're gonna 
slowly bring the left leg back.
We'll come 
through to the Pigeon.
Plant the palms and 
come back to all fours.
Take a second here to bump 
the hips a little left or right,
if you like.
And here we go, second side.
Tucking the chin,
shifting forward,
bringing the left knee up.
Walking the right foot back.
Breathing deep as you 
get yourself set up here.
Fingertips or palms
on the earth, we'll inhale.
Exhale, turn to look 
past your left shoulder.
Big stretch here so
breathe, breathe, breathe.
And then back to center.
Maybe palms come together,
maybe this is just the check in,
you're like, 
"Whoa, no, not today."
And then folding inward.
Your version.
Listening to the 
sound of your breath,
keeping the feet active.
Lean in.
Three to five breaths here.
Listen.
Let your next inhale inspire
some, easy movement.
Begin to wake up.
And then use your 
exhale to press up.
Mhmmm, mhmmm, mhmmm.
Alright, slow and steady,
mindful, here we go.
Sending your weight 
to the left hip, left glute.
You're gonna swing 
ol' right leg around.
(laughs) Crack myself up.
And then press the 
right foot into the earth.
Again, if it doesn't make it,
that's okay.
If it does, though, 
really use that connection
to sit up nice and tall.
Interlace the fingertips.
We're below the right knee,
not on the knee.
Squeezing, 
lifting, lifting, lifting.
Stay here, breathing 
deeping deep or reach the left
fingertips up towards the sky.
Cross it over.
Outer edge of the left elbow
to the outer edge 
of the right knee.
Right fingertips may be behind.
Or you can even stay here,
the right hand on the shin.
Breathe, find your breath.
And then slowly 
coming out of it.
Again, just hitting the reverse.
We're gonna come 
all the way through.
Take the right leg 
back through that Pigeon.
(mimics triumphant trumpets)
And then the hands 
come to the earth.
We come to all fours.
(mimics triumphant trumpets)
And then we walk the knees wide.
And bring the big toes to touch
and we send the hips back
and we melt the heart down.
A total surrender.
This is the last shape 
of today so close your eyes,
melt your heart in it.
And if this is not a comfortable
resting posture for you,
come to a nice, comfortable seat
or just come to life flat 
on your back, darling.
What
does your heart say
when a friend asks you,
"What is it you 
want to return to?"
What does your heart 
say when a friend asks,
"Hey, what is it that you
"want to return to?
What's your desire?"
Listen carefully, 
take a deep breath in.
As you exhale, 
stay where you are,
just bring the palms together
and then they're gonna come all
the way up behind your head here
as you walk the elbows
forward and in just a bit.
Take a beat here.
Give thanks for your body, 
for your breath and for this
time that you've carved 
out to be with yourself.
For your willingness
to uncover and really look
and see what's there, 
what feels like home.
We're on our merry way.
Inhale in.
Exhale to slowly release
the hands to the ground.
We're gonna come 
all the way up through.
You can come to sit on your
knees or swing the legs around
to sit in a nice,
comfortable seat.
Draw your hands of your choice,
draw your hands together all the
way up to the third eye.
Thumbs really pressing in to
this area between the two brows.
This is a beautiful moment
at the end of the practice,
the ritual, a chance to return.
To this idea as well
that we are, we are one.
I love it and I love you.
Thank you for being here.
Inhale in.
Exhale to bow.
Thanks, everyone.
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
