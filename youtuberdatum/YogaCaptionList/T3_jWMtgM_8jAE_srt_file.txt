- Hello everyone.
Welcome to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey,
I'm Adriene.
This is Benji and today is Day 5.
High fives all around.
If you make it to Day 5,
you can do this whole journey.
So today we hunker
down and replenish.
Let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Alright today, we're
going to begin on all fours.
So come on down to the ground.
Feel free to
always pad those knees,
if you need to.
Spread the fingertips
and we're gonna take everything
we've introduced
thus far and kind of
bring it right into
this beginning moment here
as you begin to
anchor in your breath.
Listen to your body and
just notice how you feel.
Slip into the
role of the observer.
As you drop the belly,
open the chest,
inhale to look forward.
And exhale to
round through the spine.
Chin to chest, we're beginning
with a little
spinal flexion today.
Inhale to drop the belly. 
Look forward.
And then exhale to
round through the spine.
Now I'd like for you
to find a little rhythm
with your breath here,
and when you feel inspired
go ahead and veer off the
railroad tracks a little bit
meaning you have the structure.
Now you can find a
little bit of freedom
in the form as you tune in
to the sound of your breath
and just notice how
you're feeling today.
You can turn the
fingertips around
and bring the
circles back into play.
If you need a little stretch,
through the hands, 
the wrists, the forearms.
You can take
Extended Child's Pose.
Letting go of the day thus far.
Putting your to-do list on hold.
And embracing this time
that we have curved out
for ourselves together.
Eventually we'll make our
way all the way onto the belly.
Just kind of
following the feeling nice
and slow mindfully to the belly.
Then when you get there,
I'll invite you
to bring your elbows
underneath your shoulders.
Keep the wrists parallel.
As if there are
two railroad tracks,
spread the fingertips,
press into the tops of the feet
root down
through the pubic bone.
Then draw your
shoulder blades together
and then down the back
as you open up through the chest
and begin to lift the chin
a little bit without
crunching the back of the neck.
So keep the neck nice and long.
Now, try probably won't actually
get to do this but you
never know, you never know.
Try to press your
pinky toe under the ground
as you open up 
through the chest.
Little grace notes.
See if you can hug the 
low ribs in in just a bit here
as we take Sphinx Pose.
Now find your breath again.
Pressing into the elbow.
With your breath, inhale,
turn to look over 
your right shoulder.
I like to imagine someone
kissing me on the neck here.
Hey, why not? And
then come back to center.
Excuse me, and then
take it to the other side
as you inhale to the left.
Get yourself a sweet kiss
on the right side of the neck.
Thank you very much.
And then back to center,
big inhale in.
Exhale, tuck the chin,
curl the toes under,
lift the knees, forearm Plank.
Yep, deep breathing here.
Use your breath to support you.
Breathe into all four sides
of the torso or
not here for long.
Breathe nice, smooth,
deep breaths.
Don't hold your breath here.
You got this for three, two,
and on the one, lower the knees.
Keep the elbows and arms,
and hands,
fingertips where they are.
And you're gonna
send the hips high.
Keep the knees downlow,
and then walk
them back, back, back
'til your spine feels
like it's a slide here.
Hip creases up high,
we're opening up
through the sits bones here.
So butts up and
you can take a peak
maybe lift your gaze to look
and see if your
fingertips are coming in
or your elbows
have gone out wide.
Best you can work
to maintain these two
parallel lines lines between
the elbows and the wrists.
Heart to Earth Pose. 
Big shoulder opener here.
Big heart opener,
big chest opener.
Breathing deep.
Staying nice and rooted
through the hands.
Conscious of the feet,
pressing into the
ground best you can.
One more deep breath in here.
Nice, then exhale,
slowly lift the elbows up.
Hug the lower ribs,
lift your chest.
Come all the way back to
that nice Tabletop Position.
And then we'll curl
the toes under once again.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
Take a couple
breaths here, work it out.
Marrying movement and breath,
breath and movement.
Inviting the body,
the blood, the energy,
the energetic body
to all be replenished here.
Alright from here make your
way up to the top of the mat.
You can take baby steps
or you can hop.
Feet hip width apart 
or flushed together, your choice.
Toes pointing forward.
Just nice
conscious footing always.
Bend the knees,
let the upper body drape here.
Let the head get heavy.
And find a little sway today,
a little side to side.
Feeling your weight 
shift on the feet.
I'm starting to use the sound
of the breath to
anchor the busy mind.
And then when you're ready,
bend your knees.
Tuck your chin and slowly,
begin to roll it up to standing.
Take your time.
And when you arrive, 
Mountain Pose.
Take a deep breath in.
And we're gonna squeeze 
the shoulders up to the ears.
As you exhale, take them back
and around and down.
Again big inhale, squeeze
the shoulders up to the ears.
Stand tall.
Exhale, back, around and down.
And one more time just
with the sound of your breath.
Beautiful, from here,
we're gonna take
the fingertips forward.
Cross the right
arm over the left.
Now from here,
we're at a cross,
we're gonna bring
the fingertips up
and then keep the spiral.
Keep the cross to come
into what we call Eagle Arms
or Garudasan Arms.
And if you are confused again,
it's right over left.
Bring the fingertips up
and then just keep
wrapping the arms.
Now there's a high
chance that they won't wrap.
So we'll just do our best.
Then we're gonna
lift the chest up here.
Inhale, lift the elbows up.
Listen carefully, exhale,
bend the knees
bend the knees,
send the hips back.
And we're gonna
round into a little ball.
So as low as you can go.
Just do your best.
Really send your 
weight back into your hips,
dig into your heels.
Good, here we go. 
Press into the feet.
Inhale, stand tall,
lift the elbows.
Exhale, send the hips back.
Bend the knees, get down low,
drop your center.
Drop your weight
into your heels.
Push your weight 
back into your heels.
And then inhale, lift up.
Good. Again, bend the knees.
Weight back in those heels.
Send the hips back.
Round it through chin to chest.
Again, really send the
weight back into your heels.
If you fall back that's
alright, we'll catch you.
Good and then we rise up.
Little similar to yesterday, 
open the arms,
open the chest as if
you're waking up in the morning.
Nice big stretch here.
Second side, here we go.
Left arm crosses over the right.
Fingertips up, we'll
continue to wrap it around.
And then here we go, 
inhale, lift the elbows,
lift the chest,
draw your navel in.
So draw the low ribs
and the belly button in.
Find that containment.
And then here we go,
bend the knees,
send the hips back.
Send weight into the heels.
Round it through chin to chest,
navel draws up and in.
If you want, 
you can lift the toes here.
And then here we go,
inhale, stand up tall,
Lift the elbows.
Careful not to splay out 
through the ribs too much.
Keep that
connection to center
and then here we go back down.
Bend the knees,
send the hips back.
Lots of weight in the heels.
Push the envelope,
navel draws in and out.
Good and then inhale.
We lift. Stand up tall.
Draw energy up from 
the arches of the feet.
Good, last time chin to chest.
Here we go.
Bend in the knees,
sending the hips back, squeeze.
And all the way back up.
Nice.
Open it up, take a
deep breath in, stretch.
Deep breath out,
stand up tall Mountain.
Good, inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale, Forward Fold.
Inhale halfway lift,
find length in the neck.
Hug those low ribs in and up.
Good, then exhale, 
soften and fold everything.
Bend the knees, plant the palms.
Step one foot back then
step the other foot back
for Plank or Half Plank.
Root through the fingertips,
ground down
through the knuckles.
There's not a lot of
pressure in the wrists here,
believe it or not.
Now hug the low ribs in.
The way we also
take care of that
is by connecting the core, 
right? Engaging the core.
Reach the heels back, inhale in.
Exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
Beautiful. Inhale,
lift the right leg up high.
Nice and slow, no need to rush.
Good. Feel it out here.
Find your breath.
Inhale, lift the 
right heel a little higher.
Exhale, slowly shifting forward,
squeeze and lift.
And then step that
right foot all the way up.
Good pivot on the back foot.
Inhale, sweep the fingertips
forward, up and back. 
Warrior I.
Exhale, Warrior II,
open it up nice and wide.
Straighten the front leg.
Inhale, reach the fingertips
all the way up and back.
Big stretch.
And exhale, cartwheel 
it all the way down
bending in the front knee.
Pivoting on the back foot.
Coming into your lunge.
On an inhale, reach the
right fingertips up for a twist.
Big breath in. 
Big stretch.
Lots of the energy
in the fingertips.
Good, then exhale,
bring it back down.
Nice, plant the palms, 
step it back.
Plank Pose, inhale in.
Exhale to Downward Facing Dog.
Alright, inhale, lift the 
left leg up high, nice and slow.
Claw through the fingertips.
Breathe here, check it out.
Hug into that midline.
Pressing into both palms evenly.
Good. On your next breath in,
lift the left heel 
a little higher.
Then exhale, shift it
forward with control.
Nice and easy, step it up.
When you're ready
pivot on the back foot.
Front knee has
been we're anchored
through the outer
edge of that back foot.
Inhale, sweep the
fingertips forward,
up and back Warrior I.
Ah! Good, exhale, Warrior II.
Open it up to the right.
Pull the pinkies back.
Remember head over heart,
heart over pelvis here.
Nice bend in that front knee.
Now inhale,
straighten the front leg.
Lengthen through
the left side waist
as you reach back nice and
long in the back of the neck.
Good, then exhale. 
Have fun here!
Cartwheel it all the way down.
Back to your lunge.
Pivot on the back foot
and on your next
breath in with energy
in the left fingertips,
reach up towards the sky.
Big replenishing twist here.
Good. On an exhale,
bring it back down.
Plank Pose or Half Plank.
This time inhale,
look forward, shift forward.
Exhale all the way to the belly.
Inhale for Cobra, Bhujangasan.
And exhale to
soften and release.
Inhale to press up
to Plank or all fours.
And exhale to your
Downward Facing Dog.
For this Downward Dog,
turn your toes inward.
So we have like
a pigeon toed dog
and notice what that does.
You can use your eyeballs
here to see what that does
with the ankles, the shins,
the knees, the thighbone,
the femur,
and then those hip creases.
Beautiful.
Now we'll straighten it
out just a bit but maybe keep
a little bit of inner rotation.
So the toes are
turned in just a bit.
So that inner thigh, the thigh 
bone can internally rotate.
Alright, let's
get off the hands.
Bend the knees,
inhale to look forward.
Exhale, to make
your way to the top.
You can step, you can hop.
You can Do-Si-Do. Grape vine.
Inhale to lift up halfway.
When you get there,
follow your breath.
Exhale to soften and fold in.
Good, root to rise here.
Ground through the feet,
spread the fingertips.
Inhale, reach high towards the sky.
Big breath, big stretch.
And exhale, bring the palms together
and slowly slide
them down to your heart.
Relaxing your shoulders.
As you do so close your eyes
and just observe the breath.
Notice how you feel.
Try not to fidget here.
I know it's hard and
if you do, it's all good.
You know, you do you.
Take care of you,
but just, right, we just want
to bring, awareness to that.
Alright, inhale in.
Exhale, keep the hands 
where they are.
You're gonna bend the
knees and the hips back.
We've already been here before.
Feet are together,
really together this time.
So walk them together 
if they are not already.
Send the hips back and we're 
just gonna shift our weight
a little front and back
so that we can eventually
start to really feel
what it's like to send,
kind of can be scary at first,
to send a lot of
weight into the heels.
In fact, you might
challenge yourself,
by lifting your toes here.
Really keeping that connection,
to all four corners of the feet.
Samasthiti!
And then lowering the toes,
sinking down a
little lower if you got it.
Alright, check it out.
Inhale in. Exhale, draw
the shoulder blades together.
Inhale in again.
Exhale, take your 
right elbow over
towards your left knee.
Now work to anchor right elbow
on the outside
of your left thigh.
And then take your bottom hand.
Your right hand to a fist.
Use your top hand to
grow long through the spine.
Maybe sink a little lower.
Breathe into your belly.
You got this.
Squeeze the legs together.
Good, then slowly release.
Straighten the legs.
Careful not to lock the knees.
Let the head hang forward.
Standing Forward Fold, 
Uttanasana.
Take a deep breath in.
Long breath out.
Palms come together.
We reset by
bringing the hips back.
Just a little hair toss.
Uttanasan, palms together.
Second side, here we go.
For the twist, inhale,
draw the shoulders,
shoulder blades together.
Exhale sink, a little lower.
Good inhale send the
outer edge of the left arm
now to the outer
edge of the right knee.
Bottom hand becomes a fist.
Use the top hand and press here.
As you rotate the chest,
the heart, opening
up towards the right
maybe even up towards the sky.
Finding length in the spine,
dropping your bum,
holding onto your center.
Breathing deep here.
Inhale in.
And exhale,
let everything go.
Awesome. Inhale, halfway lift.
Nice long, beautiful neck.
And then exhale to soften.
Let it all go. Nice work.
Bend the knees, plant the palms.
Step one foot
back then the other.
Plank Pose.
Inhale in here.
Exhale, hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
So for this last bit of action,
we're gonna walk the feet
up to shorten the dog just a bit.
And the heels
can be super lifted.
No worries there.
Knees can be bent.
Then we'll press
into both palms evenly,
we're gonna hug the low ribs in
and we're gonna practice
just lifting our right hand.
And it's not about
doing it and mastering it,
it's about what needs to
happen to maintain balance
when we throw
ourselves insanely off balance
by lifting the right hand.
Good, and then place it back down.
Lift the left hand,
see what happens.
And you just kind
of go off the course
and then come back to center.
Your breath has to change.
We're building strength.
Looking at our patterns.
We're looking at who we are.
And then bring 
the left hand back.
One more time, this is it guys. 
Stick with me.
Right hand lifts. You can
stay here experimenting
or you can take
it to the outer edge
of the left thigh, left shin,
or maybe even to the left ankle.
And then we'll
press into the left palm
and turn to look underneath
our left armpit chest.
Breathing deep here
in this Down Dog twist.
And then releasing.
Taking it to the other side.
Take a little break in
between if you need to.
Grabbing the outer
edge of the right shin,
right calf, right ankle.
And then using
this just like we did
in that Uttanasana twist to
find length in
the spine and rotate.
Turning our gaze
to look underneath
the right armpit chest.
This is challenging, guys.
So just use this
opportunity to explore, to learn.
Breathe into your belly.
And then slowly release.
Awesome work.
We're gonna walk
the feet back out.
Draw the navel up and in.
Shift to a Plank Pose, inhale in.
And exhale, all the 
way to the ground.
And then we're gonna
walk the feet together.
Squeeze the legs together
as if they were now one leg.
Press the pubic bone
down into the earth,
press the tops of the
foot down into the earth.
And we're gonna
introduce the fingertips
behind the tail for a
little Locus variation.
So knuckles are gonna
draw down towards the heels
as you open up
through the chest.
Inhale, just keep 
it nice and low.
We don't need to
push or press here.
Breathe into your belly.
Draw the
shoulder blades together.
Open up through the chest.
And then maybe we lift
the chin just a little bit
pulling back a little bit
so that we're
not crunching here.
You can even
hear how this changes
my voice so it's definitely 
gonna change the flow
of breath and prana, energy.
Stay here or option
to inhale in.
Exhale. 
Inhale, lift the legs.
Exhale, maintain.
Breathing deep here.
Tuck the chin again.
Careful not to crunch
on the back of the neck.
One nice long line from the
crown of the head to the tail.
Breathing deep here.
Inhale in one last breath.
And then use your exhale,
follow that breath as
you bring it all the way down.
You're gonna bring
the palms together
and rest your head on the palms
as if they were a pillow.
Bring the not as if
they were a pillow.
Let that be your pillow. 
(laughs)
And then bring the
big toes together.
Let the heels splay out.
And take a rest.
Close your eyes.
And feel your breath.
Feel your belly on the earth.
Again, close your eyes,
soften your jaw.
Feel your breath.
And then turn to the 
other ear or the other side.
Relaxing a little bit more.
Remembering that, yes, 
big twists, good exercise,
eating healthy, nourishing foods
all these things so replenishing.
But also rest, right?
Nice rest to balance it out.
Alright, bring the
head back to center
for the rest of this.
I'm gonna guide us to 
move as if we were in water.
I know that's crazy,
but just hear me out.
So we're gonna
slowly slide the hands
underneath the shoulders.
Curl the toes under
as if you're moving
through water your
gonna press all the way up.
Walk the knees
underneath the hips,
swing the legs
to one side. Whoa!
Catch a wave, inhale.
Exhale, slowly make 
your way back to this seat
you may remember.
Close your eyes, 
sit up nice and tall.
And observe your breath.
And if it feels right,
lift the corners
of the mouth just a bit,
because you did it.
You showed up here today.
And I really do believe that
a little goes a long way
and that the daily
practice really pays off
and the daily living,
helping us replenish
that which needs
to be replenished
so that we can feel good,
so that we can know
or have a sense of who we are.
And so that we can
show up and serve.
Palms together.
Lift your heart 
to your thumbs.
Take a deep breath in.
That's it, folks.
Let's exhale, bow.
Head to heart and whisper,
Namaste.
(bright upbeat piano music)
