- Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 20.
Can you believe it?
And today we find stillness.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Hi, everyone.
We're gonna begin seated today.
Come on down to the ground and
we're gonna start with 
a little foot massage.
So come on down whenever you're
ready and just take your thumbs
to the arch of your right foot.
Let's start with the right foot.
And you're just going to 
start to work the arch here
just kind of peeling away.
And this could be the weirdest
thing you've done in a long time
or this could be the most
beautiful thing that you've done
in a long time, just 
whatever you're feeling,
it's okay.
Lean in. Start to breathe 
a little deeper here,
more consciously.
And we're gonna ease in to
today's practice so you can
start to just kind 
of focus inward and,
best you can, 
treat yourself to
this little massage.
Inhale big, buoyant, 
beautiful breaths in.
And then really 
extend those exhales.
You can start to move away 
from the arch of the foot
and start to just 
really get in there.
You can wash your 
hands after this practice,
so just don't bother.
Just enjoy.
Maybe get into the ankle 
and the heel a little bit.
As you gently deepen your breath
and bring your focus inward
just notice how this 
activity makes you feel.
Does it make you 
feel uncomfortable?
Does it bring up 
a bit of emotion?
On a practical note, 
we're wanting to really actually
massage the feet, 
just kind of move this around,
get some nice pressure.
Make sure to 
squeeze all of your toes.
And, you know, I should say if
you are not working with the
feet today, for whatever reason,
this is not available to you,
then let's go with 
hand massage. 'Kay?
If you're modifying, 
that's not working for you
let's do a hand massage.
Same thing and just notice.
Same stuff.
How does it feel basically?
Alright, let's switch from the
right foot to the left foot,
or if you were 
working on the right hand,
you can finish up 
there and as you're ready,
move to the left hand.
Start with the arch of 
the foot, just right in there,
just as if you were 
kneading some dough.
No prerequisite 
necessary for this massage,
just a willingness
to touch yourself
and notice how you feel.
(laughs)
Breathe deep.
And some good 
pressure in the heel.
Good pressure in the toes.
Little reflexology 
moment here to start.
But also for those who 
are new to the practice,
you know, it's definitely
to be expected 
for your feet to feel a
little bit sore 
after all this movement.
We're gaining a lot of 
flexibility in the feet that
maybe we did not have before.
Alright, finish up on 
the left foot or left hand.
And then we'll release that.
We're gonna bring 
the hands behind us.
Fingertips in towards your bod.
Press the palms into the earth,
and then you're gonna bring the
feet up to the ground, 
knees up towards the sky.
Hey.
Then walk the hands out.
You're gonna get a nice 
stretch in the forearms here.
Squeeze the elbows 
in towards each other
to lift up through 
the front body.
Inhale in.
Exhale, lean back and then
you're just going to pitter pat,
pitter pat with the feet.
Waking up the soles of the feet.
And you can go hard here
as long as you're 
a downstairs neighbor
'cause they're gonna get mad.
And if they do, 
don't you blame it on me.
Alright?
Okay. Here we go.
Kick it up.
Go a little harder.
Yep, the pets are gonna 
come running for this one.
And then let's release.
Cross one ankle over the other.
Doesn't matter which one.
Flip the palms up.
Let them rest gently on your
knees and come into stillness.
Close your eyes.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale, relax the 
shoulders down and be still.
Part the lips, soften 
the jaw and just notice.
Notice your breath.
Soften through the fingertips.
Notice where your thoughts go.
Acknowledge where the mind goes.
And then come back 
to head over heart.
Heart over pelvis.
Come back to your breath.
Inhale in.
Exhale, hands are 
gonna come behind you again.
Can open the eyes.
We're gonna come back here,
feet on the ground,
knees up towards the sky.
But this time 
we're gonna inhale,
extend the right 
leg out and then exhale,
cross the right ankle 
over the top of the left thigh.
Big hip stretch here.
Great, to deepen the posture
we're gonna lift the bum,
walk it a little bit 
closer to the left heel.
And if we find 
this is much too much,
of course, we'll just 
keep it nice and open.
So breathing deep here.
You can adjust the palms
however you like here actually.
Sitting up tall, 
lifting up through the crown.
We're breathing deep.
Then use this 
connection to your core,
so don't just kind 
of unravel to the earth,
use this connection to your core
to slowly kick the 
right foot back out.
Try to straighten it if you can.
Bent knee's fine too but 
just working towards that.
And then release it back down.
Awesome.
Here we go.
So if the fingertips 
aren't working inward for you,
go ahead and turn them out.
Spiral back to that.
Okay, here we go.
From center, inhale.
Exhale, kick the left leg out.
Just as long as you can.
As far as you can.
And then here we go, crossing
left ankle over the right thigh
here, breathing deep, 
checking it out on this side,
maybe walking the 
bum a little bit closer.
Keeping an energy 
in your left toes.
We've learned this, keeping
that brightness in the toes
to protect the knee.
Breathing deep here.
Keeping the 
chest lifted, crown lifted,
not collapsed in the shoulders.
Awesome.
Then here we go, inhale in.
Exhale, draw your navel in,
extend your left leg out.
Extend, extend, extend.
Just testing here, 
building up to other poses.
Here we go and then 
slowly bringing it back in.
Awesome. Bring the 
soles of feet together,
walk your hands all the way up.
Grab your ankles sit up 
nice and tall, Cobbler's Pose.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale to draw 
the shoulders down.
Tag weight in the elbows,
tag weight in these heavy quad
muscles and find stillness.
Soften the skin 
of the forehead.
Soften the jaw.
Lift up through the front body.
Ground through the back body.
So there is this active 
energy in the stillness.
Inhale.
Exhale to gently release, 
walk the feet to the earth,
knees up towards 
the sky once again.
This time hands are gonna come
behind the backs of the thighs.
We're gonna loop the shoulders,
inhale in to lift the chest.
Exhale to lift the heels,
lean back,
toes can stay on the ground or
we'll lift the shins parallel
to the ceiling, to the sky.
Inhale.
Exhale, mhmmm, low Boat.
Pause here.
Think hollow body.
To challenge yourself you might
reach the fingertips up and
behind you, or keep 
them reaching forward.
Find your breath.
Three, two, one.
Lift up, cross the ankles,
palms face up. Find Sukhasana.
Be still.
Inhale in.
Exhale to relax 
the shoulders down.
Beautiful, take a little counter
twist just once to the left.
Big breath in.
And once to the right.
Back to center and 
to Downward Facing Dog.
Here we go.
Plant the palms mindfully,
inhale in,
exhale to lift the 
hips up high and back.
Take a couple of breaths here
to take whatever you may need.
And then, yes, 
you guessed it, my darling,
finding stillness 
here in Adho Mukha.
So start from the ground up.
Work your way 
towards being still.
So find that alignment.
Find your action 
within that alignment.
And then we find our awareness
by inviting a 
stillness in today.
Lift the kneecaps,
tone your quads,
pull those hip 
creases up and back.
Claw through the fingertips.
Little to no 
pressure in the wrists.
You got this.
Breathe deep for three.
Hold still for two.
Slow, descend of the 
knees down on the one.
Listen carefully, we're gonna
drop the elbows where the hands
were or elbows 
underneath the shoulders.
Walk the toes out.
Mhmmm.
Here we go, forearm Plank.
Reach the heals back.
Send your gaze down.
Press into the palms.
Find that hollow body 
that you had in low Boat here.
Neck is nice and long.
Here we go.
Breathing deep.
For three, two, one.
Lower the belly to the earth.
Flip on the top of the feet.
Loop the shoulders.
Inhale, Sphinx Pose.
So take any little 
movement you like here
and then find stillness.
Find the alignment.
So make sure your elbows
are underneath the shoulders.
Forearms and wrists in two
straight lines, parallel lines.
Maybe walk your 
knees out towards
the back edge of your mat.
Create more space 
in the hip creases.
Press into the pubic bone.
Find the alignment and 
then the action within.
Hug the low ribs in.
Press into the pubic bone,
press in to your fingertips.
Soften through the face,
tuck your chin just slightly.
Draw the shoulder 
blades together
(sighs) and breathe here.
Be still.
Mindfully working 
with your breath.
So good for those 
who are seeking to
transform or even
using the idea, returning to
here a happier posture
within the body.
Good posture.
If this is a new shape for you,
the biceps might be a bit turned
on here, but trust me, through
regular practice this will
become more of a 
restorative shape.
Activate your breath for three.
Be still, two.
And one, slow release.
Just the chin tucks in,
gaze straight down,
open your eyes.
You can interlace the
fingertips here, if you like.
We're gonna curl the toes under
and we're gonna 
press into the earth.
So use your foundation 
to lift the hips up
high again for forearm Plank.
Inhale in.
Exhale, slowly 
shift to your right.
You're gonna drop 
just your right hip down,
kiss it to the earth.
Then bring it back up.
Then through left 
hip dip to the earth.
Inhale, bring it 
up through center,
right hip to the earth.
And up through center,
left hip to the earth.
Hello obliques.
All the way up to the right.
You got it, nice and slow.
And to the left.
And to the right.
Breathe.
And to the left.
Keep pressing into the elbows.
To the right.
And to the left.
And one more time to each side.
You got it.
To the right.
And to the left.
Good, slowly 
come back to center.
Lower onto the belly.
Drag your hands in 
line with the rib cage,
squeeze your 
elbows into the side body,
inhale to rise up, lift up.
And exhale to 
slowly bring it back down.
Alright, maintain this
connection pubic bone to earth.
Press the tops of the feet into
the earth and we're gonna start
to send the fingertips forward.
Palms facing one another.
Thumbs up, pinkies down.
You don't have to 
go super crazy here.
So lighting up the 
muscles of the back body.
We're maintaining our 
connection to the foundation.
Here we go, 
tuck the chin, inhale.
Exhale to lift the 
hands a little higher.
You're not here long.
Keep your gaze down.
This is your superhero pose.
Breathe deep.
Inhale to reach 
the fingertips forward.
Exhale, plug the 
shoulders back and in.
You're here for three, two.
Lift a little higher 
and one, release.
Plant the palms.
Forehead comes to 
the tops of the palms.
Rest your head and then 
bring your big toes together.
Splay the heels 
out left to right.
Peek at me if you need to.
So that you can 
relax everything's here,
shake the hips a 
little left to right.
And then find stillness.
Listen to the 
sound of your breath.
Feel your rib cage and the
lungs expand as you breathe in.
And then feel this gentle
softening into the earth
as you breathe out.
Inhale in.
Exhale to lift the chin.
Here we go.
Walk the toes out.
Press in to the 
tops of the feet.
You're gonna send 
the fingertips forward.
Big breath in.
Exhale to lift 'em up.
Thumbs up, pinkies down.
This time you can repeat what
we did before in 
your superhero pose,
super person pose
or we're gonna add the legs.
Inhale in.
Exhale, lifting 
from the inner thighs,
inner arches of the feet.
You're gonna add the legs.
Here we go.
A little Locust variation.
Keeping the gaze down, 
the neck nice and long
so we're not clenched here.
Alright?
So find the stillness here.
Breathing deep.
You got it.
Three more breaths.
Inhale.
And exhale.
Lifting the inner thighs 
up towards the sky, inhale.
And exhales.
Spread the fingertips, 
spread the toes
for this last 
cycle of breath, inhale.
And exhale.
Good, slowly release.
Create a little pillow for
your forehead with the palms,
bring the big toes together,
heels splay out left to right
and rest your head, darling.
Take a second here to restore.
Just repeat the mantra 
quietly to yourself:
"Allow. Release.
"And let go."
See if you can 
feel your heartbeat.
Be still my beating heart.
Inhale.
Exhale to rise up.
Check it out.
Look at this fancy move.
You're gonna take it from here,
we're gonna flip your burger or
your veggie burger 
all the way to your back.
Hug the knees up to the chest.
When you get there, 
give yourself a loving embrace.
Close your eyes.
Notice how your yoga 
mat has your back here.
Literally, rising 
up to meet your spine.
Take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out,
relax your shoulders.
Good, slowly bring 
your feet to the earth.
Some of you have 
practiced with me with the thud,
a little reflexology moment if
you want to bring that into play
here, you just, let's all do it.
Why not?
You just drop your feet 
to the earth with a thud.
Let your body move.
Do it a couple times.
Here we go.
Drop the feet to 
the earth with a thud.
Let your body move.
Let's do one more.
Here we go.
Don't be shy. Inhale.
Exhale.
Ha!
Yes.
Extend one leg 
and then the other.
Flip your palms up.
Snuggle your shoulder blades
underneath your heart space.
Walk your ankles out 
is wide as your yoga mat.
And here you go, tuck the chin.
Inhale in.
Exhale to close your 
eyes and let everything go.
Shavasana, Corpse Pose.
Find stillness here.
Let your body be heavy.
Permission here to do absolutely
nothing for just but a moment.
Let everything go.
And this is the 
hardest part sometimes.
So practice stillness.
Soften the skin to the forehead,
relax your jaw and just 
let your breath be easy.
Trust me, trust yourself,
trust the video.
We're here for 
just but a moment.
Then slowly, gently 
begin to deepen the breath.
Let it begin to move you.
Fingers, toes, wrists, ankles.
Can start to move the tongue 
around in your mouth. Why not?
Then we'll bend the knees.
Turn to one side, any side, hug
the knees up into the chest for
a little fetal posture.
Let your bottom bicep, your
bottom arm become your pillow or
as we say in Texas, pill-ah.
And just take a 
second here to be still.
Feel that nice, sweet 
curvature in the spine.
Rest your head.
Feel this loving, caring energy
that you've cultivated for
yourself on the mat, 
even if it's just a taste.
And then slowly, we'll 
press back up to a seat.
Bring your palms together.
Lift your heart to your thumbs
and let's bow 
the head to the heart.
The mind intelligence 
to the body intelligence.
Find a moment.
Just capture one final moment
here in this shape to be still
and notice how you feel.
So, it's wonderful 
to be here learning
and exploring new shapes.
But it doesn't always have
to be harder, faster, stronger.
Remember, dear one, 
to take time to be still.
Thank you for sharing this
time and energy with me today.
Thank you for sharing your
journey thus far with me and all
of the beautiful people around
the world practicing together,
remembering to take time 
to listen and tend to it.
I love you so much.
Let's take one more 
deep breath in here together.
I look forward to 
seeing you mañana.
Exhale to bow 
and we whisper
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
