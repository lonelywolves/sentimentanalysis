- Hey everyone.
Welcome to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 14, can you believe it?
And today, 
we're talkin' about Space.
Let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Alrighty my sweet friend,
come on down to the ground.
Sit up nice and tall and
let's begin with a deep breath
in through the nose,
and out through the nose.
Just getting settled in here.
Deep breath in through the nose.
And out through the nose.
And then wildcard,
breath in through the nose.
And out through the
nose or mouth, your choice.
Alright, drop the
chin to the chest.
And you're just gonna tilt
the head a little left to right
gently tick-tocking,
left ear to left shoulder,
left ear to right shoulder 
with the chin down.
And then, ooh yeah,
come back to center.
Lift the chin parallel 
to the earth and then
carve a line with your nose
gently up towards the sky,
but not directly up
so you're not crunching
in the back of the neck.
But just a lift to feel 
the throat open here.
Neck get nice and 
long in the front.
And then same thing,
tick-tocking.
Left ear to left shoulder,
right ear to right shoulder
and you're gonna feel
hopefully a nice good stretch
in the front of the neck here.
It's kinda like
you're pondering.
It's like you're those cherubs,
those angels thinking.
Okay, and then
bring the head back.
Head over heart, 
heart over pelvis.
Pay attention here
to this alignment.
So you might find
yourself shifting forward
or even hunched a little back.
Don't forget to
sit up on something
to help you sit
up nice and tall.
And we're gonna 
bring the fingertips
to the shoulders here.
Bring the elbows
forward to kiss.
As you inhale, they come 
up and around and back.
Creating space here.
As you inhale, they come 
forward, kiss together.
Exhale, around and back,
and you can soften your gaze
and close your eyes
here and start to feel,
feel it out,
moving with the breath.
Good, and then do one more.
And then we're
gonna take it forward,
but one elbow at a time.
So first the right,
then the left.
First, the right, then
the left like we're swimming,
with the elbows leading the way.
Great, then release that.
Send the palms
out just for a second
to stretch, stretch, stretch.
Cross the right arm
over the body towards
the left side of your mat.
Take the left hand and
press it along the arm here
to feel this stretch.
And then when you feel
like you've found this,
you're gonna drop
your right shoulder down.
So chances are it's lifting up,
you're gonna drop it down,
and turn to look
past your right shoulder.
Whoo, lots of space.
The neck, 
the traps, the shoulders.
Good, then release that.
We're gonna take
it to the other side.
We're gonna reach the left
arm over towards the right.
Excuse me, right
hand's gonna help guide
the arm all the way.
A lot of us know this
stretch from, you know,
maybe gym class or sports,
but we're gonna
drop the shoulder down
into socket here, and then
turn past the left shoulder.
Breathe.
Good, and then
slowly release, awesome.
Fingertips are gonna come back
to the tops of
the shoulders.
Good, we're gonna open 
up through the chest so,
feel this length up
through the side body.
So we're growing long through
all four sides of the torso.
The front, the sides, and
the back, lots of space here.
We're gonna do a
little pranayama here
to give us a little
energy to start moving.
So we're gonna inhale,
turn to the right.
We know to sit up nice and tall.
Head over heart,
heart over pelvis.
And then exhale, 
we rotate through center.
Head, heart and
pelvis over to the left.
And we're using the
elbows and the shoulders
to help guide the movement.
So inhale to right.
Exhale to the left.
Inhale to right.
Exhale to the left.
Now we're gonna speed it up.
And keep the skin
of the face calm.
Inhaling to the right.
Exhaling to the left.
Head, heart and pelvis,
staying in one line.
Creating space
throughout the spine,
the torso, massaging
the internal organs here.
Keep the low body 
nice and heavy.
Keep it going.
Alright, 10 more seconds.
See if you can find that upward
lift through the front body,
grounding through the back body.
And release,
relax the arms gently.
Inhale in through both nostrils.
Exhale through both nostrils.
Just notice how you feel,
soft fingertips.
Whoo, okay, here we go, coming
to all fours nice and slow.
If the arms are a little
sore from our previous practices,
we're working it out,
we're building strength,
can start to
work with fists here.
Inhaling to drop the belly.
Creating space
through the front body.
Exhaling to round 
through the spine.
Think about creating space 
here through the back body.
Good, inhale to drop the belly,
heart reaches forward.
Exhale, use your
foundation to create that space.
Just play.
Inhaling, drop the belly.
Exhale, round through the spine.
The next time you inhale,
go ahead and inhale
to Tabletop, nice
neutral spine here.
And you're gonna curl
the right toes under,
send the right toes back,
and then you're gonna slowly
walk or slide rather,
slide the right toes
all the way over towards
the left side of your mat,
and then turn to
look at your left heel.
Now use, this is a
great place to experiment,
to practice
using the foundation,
that which is
touching the earth,
to really ground
and press away from
so that you can
create more space
and see what areas you
find can create more space
by focusing or refocusing 
on your foundation
and your breath as well.
So for me, 
it's the fascia of the foot
as I reach the right heel back.
It's the arms as I claw 
through the fingertips,
take pressure out of the wrists.
As I turn to look
past my left shoulder,
I feel that length 
in my side body.
The right low back, even the
front of my right hip crease,
and the psoas.
So there's a lot there,
take a deep breath in.
Exhale to bring it on back.
Reset, draw the navel up and in.
So a little center connection,
and then left toes curl in,
we extend the left leg out.
Reach back
through that left heel,
and then nice and slow,
slide it over.
Keep pressing in
to your left palm.
And then send your gaze 
past your right shoulder,
look at your left heel,
and same thing.
What can you do,
what actions can you play with
to create more space,
and how can adding
a conscious breath invite
that spaciousness in as well?
And feel it out.
Notice where you feel that
expansion and that stretch.
That opening.
Glorious, one more
breath here, inhale.
Exhale.
And then slowly release.
Come back to all fours.
Walk the palms forward.
Then we're gonna slowly 
walk the knees back,
and just gently come on to
the belly all the way down,
all the way down,
all the way down.
Beautiful, walk the elbows 
underneath the shoulders.
So we've come to
Sphinx Pose before.
Again, make sure the forearms 
are nice and parallel,
the hands are
gonna wanna come in
to accommodate
for tight shoulders.
See if you can keep
them nice and parallel.
Now dig down through the elbows,
draw the
shoulder blades together,
open up through the chest 
as you look forward, inhale.
Exhale, slight tuck of the chin.
Beautiful.
Breathing here.
Alright from here, we're
gonna take the left elbow
a little bit wider and we're
gonna bring the right hand in.
So now we're 
bringing the forearm
of the right hand parallel 
with the front of the mat.
Peek at me if you need to.
Right elbow's still
underneath the right shoulder.
I'm gonna bend my left knee,
reach back, grab my left ankle,
and then kick back.
Opening up through the
left shoulder, left pec.
So I'm not trying to
grow a big pose here,
I'm focusing on
feeling the sensation.
Pressing down through the top
of the right foot for stability.
Pressing away from the yoga mat.
This is another great
example if you're collapsing,
you're not gonna
feel supported or safe.
But,
with that action,
you will feel more supported
and hopefully safe to play.
Let's go ahead and release,
try it on the other side.
So again, I'm gonna
bring my left form parallel
with the front of the mat.
And I'm still bringing left
elbow underneath the shoulder.
And then I'll
bend my right knee,
reach behind,
grab my right ankle,
kick back with the right foot
and you'll feel that opening
in your right armpit chest.
Breathing deep here.
With that inhale, 
breathing in to the belly.
Exhale, kicking, kicking out.
Good, and then slowly release.
Draw the hands in
line with the ribcage.
Inhale, baby Cobra,
just a baby one.
Strengthening that back.
And then exhale to release.
Press up to all fours, drop
the elbows where the hands are,
Puppy Posture as you
walk the knees back.
Again, keep the 
forearms parallel.
Don't let those hands come in,
so even if it means
you don't go back as much.
Let's start to open up,
create space in the whole
shoulder girdle.
You can walk the hips,
excuse me,
rock the hips a
little left to right here.
Melt the heart down,
Heart to Earth Pose here.
Inhaling deeply.
And exhaling.
Good.
Draw the navel in and up.
Slowly shift your heart forward.
Keep the elbows where
they are, forearm Plank.
As you curl the toes under,
we lift the knees.
From here, see if you can
keep the forearms parallel,
but if it feels more stable
to interlace the fingertips
and bring them together,
if that's how you're used
to practicing and 
you're craving it, go there.
'Cause we're here for ten.
Nine, press away
from the yoga mat.
Eight, seven, six,
five, four.
Three, two, one, blast
off to space, just kidding.
Lower the knees,
release the arms.
Let's bring the
hands back to the earth.
Curl the toes under, 
peel the hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Take a deep breath in
here as you pedal the feet,
bend the knees, work it out.
Exhale.
Inhale, carve a line with 
the nose to look forward.
Exhale, make your 
way to the top.
Feet flush together or 
hip width apart, (chuckles)
your choice.
Toes pointing forward.
Slight bend in the knees,
clasp opposite elbow
with opposite hand and then
let the weight of your head,
your shoulders,
the torso hang over
as you root through all
four corners of the feet
and find a gentle
sway side to side.
Mmm, creating all this 
yummy space in the low back
after all this awesome work
you've been
doing here on the mat.
Balancing it out.
You gotta bring the breath.
Good, and when you're ready,
release the arms,
and let's begin to
slowly roll it up.
Enjoy the ride.
Your best and most beautiful
Mountain Pose here, stand tall.
Feel your breath.
And then when you're ready,
stretch the hands,
so spread the fingertips really
wide here to exaggerate it,
create lots of space
between the fingers.
As you inhale,
reach all the way up.
Imagine you're holding
a big beach ball here.
Thumbs back, pinkies forward.
Then you're gonna take
that big ball up and overhead,
so careful not to have
too narrow of a grip here.
Nice and wide.
You're gonna take it up
and over towards the left here
as you bump the
hips to the right.
And then all the
way back to center,
up and over to the right
as you bump the
hips to the left.
Then all the way back to center,
inhale, look up.
Exhale slow and steady,
Forward Fold all the way down.
Inhale, lifts you up halfway.
Lots of space between 
the ears and the shoulders.
And then exhale
to soften and fold.
Bend the knees, plant the palms,
step one foot back,
then the other, Plank Pose.
Walk the toes
super wide, inhale in.
Exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
So, feet are nice and wide.
Now turn the toes in slightly.
Exaggerate this
external rotation
of the upper arm bones.
So we have the external
rotation of the upper arm bones
and then the inner
rotation of the thigh bone,
so two opposites again.
Take a deep breath in here.
Then exhale, slowly
lower to the knees.
Walk the hands in
line with the shoulders,
wrists underneath the shoulders,
excuse me.
And here we go,
we're gonna inhale,
kick the right foot
up towards the sky,
keep the right knee bent.
Open up the chest.
Inhale, look forward again.
Beautiful, exhale.
Draw your navel up to
your spine for stability
as you maybe reach
your left arm back
to grab the top
of the right foot.
And then we'll kick out
from here using the ground
as we have been
practicing to really root down
and lift out of to kick
the right foot back 
and heart forward.
Creating space
through the front body.
Inhale in.
And exhale to release, 
nice and slow with control.
Beautiful, same
thing on the other side.
Let's play, kick the left
foot up, breathe in.
Exhale. Use that contraction to
really draw the navel up and in.
Right hand reaches around.
Maybe grabs the top
of the left foot.
Can always just
work with the foot here.
Both hands on the ground.
Then use your
foundation to really root from,
so grow from those roots as
you inhale, open the chest.
Create space in the front body.
Inhale, front line's 
nice and open.
Exhale, connect to your center.
Inhale in again,
maybe kick a little more.
And then with control, 
exhale, release everything.
Alright, walk the hands forward,
curl the toes under,
send the hips up high and back.
Inhale in deeply.
As you exhale,
just let it all go.
Good, inhale,
lift the right leg up high.
Exhale, step it all
the way up into your lunge.
Pivot on the
back foot, Warrior I.
Big breath as you take your
big beach ball up and overhead.
So nice wide
grip on the ball, (laughs)
up over head,
not too small.
Give yourself some space.
Front knee over front ankle.
Legs are strong.
Lengthening the tailbone 
down as you lift the heart up.
Inhale in here.
Exhale, Warrior II, 
take up space.
So imagine energy really
kind of going
beyond the fingertips here
as you spread the
fingertips nice and wide,
drop the shoulders,
and lift the heart.
Look forward, inhale in.
Exhale, Reverse Warrior, 
straighten the front leg.
Reach up and back
with the right arm.
And then exhale, take up space
here in this transition today
as you cartwheel all the way
forward and into your twist.
Big inhale to reach 
the right fingertips up,
send the left heel back.
And exhale, right hand 
to the earth.
Step the right toes back,
belly to Cobra
or Chaturanga to
Upward Facing Dog.
Use your breath to open
the chest, to open the heart.
As you breathe in,
follow the breath
to send the hips
up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog
as you breathe out.
Alright, inhale, 
lift the left leg up high.
Exhale, step it all the way up.
Pivot on the
back foot, Warrior I.
With your big inhale,
fingertips reach up,
big beach ball up and overhead.
Thumbs back, pinkies forward.
Front knee is over front ankle.
I'm pressing into the 
outer edge of my back foot.
Legs are charged.
Face is calm.
Hang on to your focus as
you open it up, Warrior II.
Pull the pinkies back.
Head over heart, 
heart over pelvis.
Breathing.
Take up space but again,
imagine your fingertips being
pulled in opposite directions.
And then straighten
the front leg, inhale,
reach the left fingertips
all the way up first.
Create space in the left side
waist and then all the way back.
Nice and long in the neck,
lots of integrity there 
as you inhale in.
Exhale, take up as much
space as possible, baby,
as you cartwheel all
the way into your twist,
pivoting on the back foot.
Big inhale lifts
the left fingertips up,
squeeze the left knee in.
And then exhale, 
left hand to the ground.
Beautiful. Plant the palms, 
step it back.
Belly to Cobra or Chaturanga
to Upward Facing Dog.
Using that inhale
to open your heart.
And using the exhale
to meet me in Downward
Facing Dog, beautiful.
Deep breath in.
Long breath out.
One more time,
inhale lots of love in.
Claw through the fingertips.
Exhale lots of love out.
Good, bend the knees, inhale.
Carve a line with the
nose to look forward.
Exhale, make your 
way to the top.
Inhale, lift up halfway.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Bend the knees, 
send the hips back.
Chair Pose, send the 
fingertips forward.
Here we go, nice and low,
dig in to the heels.
Hip creases pull back.
Big beach ball here
so you have lots of space.
Inhale in.
Exhale, root to rise,
straighten the legs,
reach for the sky.
And hands are gonna
float down to the heart here.
When they do, take a
second to observe the breath.
Then we're gonna
turn over one shoulder
and we're gonna take
up some space by bringing
the legs nice
and wide on the mat.
And toes can point
forward to the edge of your mat.
We're gonna press
into the knife edge,
the outer edge of the feet.
Draw energy up from the arches.
And then inhale,
fingertips go down to come up,
we're gonna come in to
Star Pose, so it's a big X.
Talk about taking up space here.
So pull the backs and
the hands back just a bit.
Open up through this area
that we have been tending to.
Getting a healthy flow of lymph.
Also releasing buildup
of stress and
tension around the neck,
the shoulders, even the ribcage.
Close your eyes here and
just a little contemplation
for this practice
of taking up space.
If the arms get tired,
you're not alone.
Breathing here,
lifting the ribcage up, up, up.
Lifting your heart.
We're not here long.
You got this.
Length in the back of the neck.
Inhale in.
Exhale, hands to heart.
Good. Inhale in again.
Exhale, relax the 
shoulders down.
Inhale in, lift the heart,
the sternum up to the thumbs.
Feel that connection of your
thumbs on your heart center,
you might even
feel your heart beat.
Then soft bend in the knees,
you're gonna bring your heels
a little bit wider than 
your toes, so toes turn in.
And Standing Wide-Legged 
Forward Fold, so therapeutic.
Soft bend in the knees as
we send the hip creases back.
And today, we'll move
through that flat back position
so you can take a breath
at that flat back position,
and then find
your version today.
So you might use your blanket
to bring the earth up to you.
If you have blocks or books,
you might use them here.
Maybe fingertips
come into the earth.
Strong legs, full conscious
breath here guiding the way.
Maybe the hands
come all the way down.
And maybe even we are
able to walk the hands
with practice in line
with the arches of the feet.
Maintain an external
rotation in the upper arm bones
and maybe one day bring the
crown of the head to the earth.
We're working in your
variation today fully.
Breathing into all
four sides of the torso.
Creating space.
Owning it,
owning where we are today.
Take one more breath
wherever you are, nice and easy.
Then start with the feet.
Connect all four corners 
down to the earth.
We draw energy up 
through the arches,
through the inseam
until we get to the belly,
we connect with the core,
help the guide the way
as we bring the
hands back to heart center
and slowly rise back up.
Star Pose, inhale,
send the fingertips out.
Exhale, stay here.
Twice more, inhale.
Take up space and exhale.
You are more than
worthy of this space.
Own it, here we go,
one last breath.
Good, float the palms together.
You can hop the feet
together here if that's your jam
or slowly inch 
the heels and the toes
back to Mountain Pose.
That's where we'll meet.
Relax the hands
gently at your sides.
We'll walk to the
front of the mat here.
Hmm, good.
On an inhale,
reach for the sky.
On an exhale, fold it down.
Fingertips come to the
mat here, check it out.
We're gonna lift the heels
and drop your
center all the way down
into a crouched position.
That's right, 
a crouched position.
So heels are lifted, you can
keep the feet hip width apart
or if you wanna
challenge yourself,
if it feels right in your body,
it's not gonna feel
right for everyone,
I'll tell you that right now,
you can bring the 
feet together, really together.
Then lift the heels.
So we're focused on sensation
and creating
spaciousness in the body
so that when we get off
the mat we can move and groove
and live and learn
and serve with more ease.
So don't get too caught up in,
"Oh, I wanna get 
my feet together," you know?
Just, let's come
into this crouch position
and feel this spaciousness 
in the low back.
The whole back really.
And in the fascia of the foot.
And from there,
we're gonna draw some
energy up from the pelvic floor
and come on to the fingertips.
And then from there, we'll
revisit this maybe another day
if it's not right
for you, but from there,
you might lift one
hand up and then the other
into a little toe stand.
So we're either
staying in a crouch
or we're practicing
a little toe stand.
Just getting some
fun things to play with
as we create space.
But remembering that our
goal is to be in the sensation.
And then follow the sensation.
That keeps me in
a state of play.
Alright, let that go.
Use the hands to come all
the way back on to the bum.
Center your bum in
the center of your mat.
Then reach the fingertips forward
as you slowly, slowly, slowly,
one vertebrae at a time here,
roll it down.
Controlling the muscles
in the center of the body
until you come all 
the way down to the ground.
We'll take a big full 
body stretch here
reaching the arms all 
the way up and overhead.
Point and flex the feet,
rotate the ankles.
Rotate the wrists too 
if that feels good.
Then slowly
float the hands down,
palms on the earth.
We'll lift the knees back up,
soles of the feet on the mat.
So opening up through
the front line here again.
Finding space as we press into
all four corners of the feet.
Press into the hands,
and slowly begin
to lift the hip points 
up towards the sky.
Crawl the shoulder
blades underneath you.
Bridge pose, shins forward.
Hip points lifting.
Chest lifts to the chin
and the chin lifts to the sky.
It's almost as if you're
feeling as though you could tear
the center of your yoga mat.
So tearing the
mat into two pieces,
that's how strong the
connection is in the feet.
Can take the bind by
interlacing the fingertips.
Still creating space in the chest,
the shoulders.
Inhale in.
And exhale to slowly release.
Make your way all the
way back down to the earth.
Open the knees wide,
Reclined Cobbler's pose.
Let the hands rest
gently on the belly.
Feel your inhale,
the belly rises.
And feel out your exhale
as the belly slowly falls,
close your eyes.
Then bring the fingertips to
the outer edges of the legs.
Close the knees slowly.
Hug both legs up 
towards the chest.
You can rock around a little
bit here if it feels good.
Massaging the low back.
Maybe taking knees
one way in a circular motion
and then the other.
Palms on the kneecaps.
Then hug the right knee in,
send the left leg out long.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale, supine twist.
Guide the right knee
over towards the left side
of your yoga mat.
And open up
through your right wing.
Maybe turn on
towards your right ear.
Breathe deep into your belly.
And breathe out,
letting something go.
Inhale in again.
And in the twist,
have an opportunity here
always on the exhale to
let go of maybe something
that is just no
longer serving you.
Maybe it had a purpose once
before and you can honor that
and then use a nice 
exhale as an opportunity
to let it go, 
say thank you and let it go.
And come back to center.
Hug the left knee
all the way up and in.
Right leg extends, inhale.
Exhale to the twist.
Same thing, opening up
now through your left wing,
turning on your left shoulder.
Inhaling, feeling all four sides
of the torso
receive that breath.
And then exhaling
to let something go.
Inhale in.
And exhale, letting go
of that which no longer serves
so that you can create space
for the incoming gifts.
One more breath in.
Seriously, this exhale,
nice conscious exhale,
opportunity to get
rid of some old clothes,
old shoes, things that
no longer fit in your life
to make room for the
next bits and pieces
you wanna try on.
In other words, thank you, next.
Okay, here we go. (laughs)
Come back to center.
And if you want, let's
do a little Happy Baby here
before we extend
the legs out long.
So grab the outer
edges of the feet,
lengthen the tailbone towards
the front edge of the mat.
Deep breath in.
Long breath out.
And when you're ready,
extending the legs out long.
Allowing the arms 
to rest gently
at your side.
Maybe you take your blanket,
bring it underneath the head
or underneath the knees.
Coming in to relaxation.
Allowing the benefits,
the myriad of
benefits this practice,
working on so
many different levels,
allowing it all to
kind of come together
here in the Corpse Pose.
Receiving the benefits
and the nutrients of
this amazing practice.
Simply allowing here
in the final posture,
you don't have to do anything.
Take a deep breath in.
And use your next exhale
as one final full opportunity
to let everything go.
Relaxing the weight of
your body completely
and fully into the earth.
And just a couple of
more quiet moments here
to just be.
And as you're ready, gently
begin to deepen your breath.
Start to rub your
thumbprint on your index finger,
middle finger,
ring finger, pinky.
And just move back and forth
there as you invite some energy
back to the toes,
wiggling the toes as well.
Then we'll bring
the hands together.
Thumbs right up to the
forehead or that third eye.
We'll take a final
breath in here together.
Inhale, lots of love in.
Make space for all the love
that you're worthy of.
Get ready to receive incoming.
And of course, take it
upon yourself to exhale
lots of love out. Spread love.
And we'll keep it going.
Whoo hoo, almost
to the halfway mark.
I can't wait to
see you tomorrow.
Until then, take good care.
Namaste.
(bright upbeat piano music)
