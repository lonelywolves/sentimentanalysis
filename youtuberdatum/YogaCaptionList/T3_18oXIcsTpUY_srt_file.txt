- Hello, everyone.
Welcome to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 8.
Don't hate, meditate,
feel great and snuggle up
for a restorative practice.
So wear something
extra comfy today.
If you have an extra
blanket or towel, bring it.
And if you want to bring
a pillow, grab that too.
If you don't have 
any of these things,
just come as you are are.
It'll still be really 
yummy and snugly.
Let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Alright my sweet friend,
come on down to the ground.
This is a nice, slow
and low practice today.
Go ahead and sit on
your blanket or your pillow.
I've also laid a
nice blanket out for
you know who and I to
just kind of have a nice
cozy setting for
today's practice.
As you're ready, 
do sit up nice and tall,
relax your shoulders.
And I'll allow you to kind of
choose what feels good today.
Hands on the knees, thighs.
Or sometimes I like 
to bring one hand
on top of the other 
and rest them nice
and easy in my lap.
So find what feels good.
And we'll close the eyes here
coming into the present moment
by bringing our
awareness to the breath.
Or if I may today
begin to snuggle up
to the sensation
and the rhythm of your breath.
Just noticing how it 
feels today and noticing
the rhythm.
Is it easy kind of steady
breathing,
or does it seem a little difficult,
maybe short breaths?
We're practicing slipping
into the role of
the observer here.
So whatever it is is all good.
We're just noticing
and allowing the action
of bringing our
awareness to the thing,
which is our breath here,
to be non-judgemental.
Not doing anything or
forcing anything or even
trying to change anything.
Just noticing here,
although you'll find
by bringing your awareness,
your attention to something
it inevitably
shifts and changes.
So we'll just allow.
Go ahead and use this 
moment too if you like to
snuggle up
to this time that
you've carved out
for yourself and maybe
allow the dust to settle.
If you've been
having a difficult time
or it was a 
struggle to get here,
you can take a breath in here
and exhale and
maybe just let that go.
Allow the dust or the glitter,
you choose, to settle here.
As you come to reside in
the role of the observer.
Snuggling up to the
role of the observer has
changed my whole
life off the mat.
I'm able to pause, breathe.
Notice how I feel 
about something.
Notice my reaction.
Before I make a choice,
conscious or unconscious,
and how I want to 
act or react to that
emotion.
Then bow your head down.
Sit up nice and tall.
So you might need to lift
the heart a little bit here
relax your shoulders down.
Then bring your fingertips
gently to the 
earth at your sides.
And on a nice, slow inhale
start to reach the
fingertips up towards the sky.
You can allow
your gaze to follow.
Look up, fingertips
kiss up and overhead.
And then exhale, 
float them down,
gently ground your
fingertips into the earth.
Good. Twice more like that.
Big inhale, sit up 
nice and tall, big stretch.
And exhale, float it down.
And one more time.
Inhale in.
Exhale, float it down.
Left hand comes to the earth.
Inhale, reach the 
right fingertips up and over.
Side body stretch.
Try to spiral your heart
up towards the sky here.
Spread the right fingertips,
press away from the earth
with the left palm.
And then slowly come 
back through to center.
Ground the right hand, inhale,
spread the left fingertips.
As you reach left hand 
all the way up and over.
Stretching through that left side.
Spiral your heart, 
your chest up towards the sky.
And then slowly 
bring it back down.
Gorgeous. We're gonna 
bring the left heel
in towards the 
center of the body.
Uncross the ankles, bring the 
right foot in to follow.
So you have left
foot then right foot.
Then we're gonna
use the fingertips
on the ground to slowly
crawl forward onto the forearms.
Now breathe here.
You might start to feel
this in your right hip.
If you're not feeling a kind
of resonance in
that right hip yet
go ahead and keep
moving the heart forward.
Gaze forward,
reaching the fingertips
and straightening the arms
maybe to bring the
forehead to the ground.
So we're here on the forearms.
Or we're reaching
the fingertips forward.
Kind of like in
Downward Facing Dog.
Now everyone reach, actively
reach your hip creases back
try to glue your sits bones,
your bum to the ground.
So there's an action 
of reaching forward,
leaning forward and then there's
an action of pulling back.
Then bring a little bit
of energy to your toes
as you send awareness to
your right hip and breathe in.
And breathe out.
And again, breathe in.
And breathe out.
Now stay where you are.
We're just gonna walk the
hands or the forearms over
towards the right 
and same thing.
We breathe in lots of
space in the low back,
left side waist here.
And breathe out.
Lots of awareness in the
right hip as you breathe in.
And breathe out.
Good, walk the hands 
through center or
forearms through center.
Take it to the left now.
Same thing, relax the 
head over, breathe in.
And breathe out.
Then breathe in.
And breathe out.
Then walk it back to center.
Fingertips, guide the
way all the way back up
to seated and we'll
switch bringing the right heel
in towards the 
center of the body,
left foot to follow.
Fingertips help us crawl 
our way to forearms first.
Just check it out.
This side will be different.
Breathing.
And then maybe
taking it a little further.
Working to melt the
heart towards the earth
forehead towards the ground.
Bring energy to the toes 
and breathe in.
Reaching the hip creases 
back as you breathe out.
And breathe in.
And breathe out.
And breathe in.
And long breath out.
Keep the hips
heavy and pulling back
as you walk the hands or the
forearms over towards the left.
Bow, the head down 
and breathe in.
Close your eyes.
Breathe out.
Snuggling up to the sound of
the breath as you breathe in.
And breathe out.
Keep the focus inward
on the breath as
you walk the forearms
or the hands over
towards the right.
Bow the head and breathe in.
And breathe out.
Breathe in.
And breathe out.
Walk the hands back to center.
Palms or fingertips 
guide you back up.
Head over heart,
heart over pelvis here.
Just take a second to
sit up nice and tall.
Notice how you feel.
Lovely, then bring the
fingertips behind you.
We're gonna bring the
feet to the ground here
and we're just gonna
with fingertips on the earth
or maybe even the
palms for a stronger base,
we're gonna slowly send the
knees to one side any side.
So we have an
internal rotation with one leg
and an external rotation
with the other in the hip.
And then windshield wiper it
through and to the other side.
Good, back to center and over.
Back to center and over.
Okay, now close your eyes
or soften your gaze
and just start to
move a little back
and forth in your own
time with your breath.
Careful not to collapse too much
in the chest here. Try to
keep the heart a little lift,
just a gentle lift there.
Little lift.
Beautiful. Then bring 
it back to center.
From here we're gonna
draw the left heel in,
the right leg out.
We're gonna flex the
right toes up towards the sky.
And we're gonna use our hands,
bring your hands
to your left side waist,
your left rib cage.
And you're gonna use the hands,
the power of touch.
Am I right?
We're gonna bring it
all the way over through
as you hug the right femur.
So this right thighbone
draws back really into socket.
You're gonna guide your torso to
face your right toes.
So this might seem
like a lot, especially
if you've done this a lot,
but I love the power
of touch to really feel
how everything's integrated.
I draw my center in, 
I bring my rib cage around
and I hug my right
hip crease into socket.
Boom, set up for Janusirsasana.
Send the fingertips 
behind the ears,
Head to Knee Pose,
inhale, reach up.
Exhale, I'm gonna send my
heart over towards my knee.
Doesn't have to come close.
The intention is to traditionally,
to get the head
to kiss that knee,
but we're just gonna work
with the intention of that here.
If it gets down
there close, great.
Another great option is
if you did bring a
second blanket to class
you can use that to
lift the knee up towards
your forehead here.
And eventually we'll
let the hands rest gently
on our sides or maybe
grab the shin, the ankle,
or the foot.
When you land there, go ahead
and close your eyes and
snuggle up to that ocean sound.
Good, take one more
cycle of breath here.
And then slowly carve a line
with your nose to look forward.
So remember how
you move matters here.
So even as you
release out of something
and head into the next thing,
that's like the money for me.
Those are the money moments
to really connect the dots.
And we'll talk more
about that later but,
moving with ease and lovingly in
and out of the postures
makes a big difference.
A little counter stretch here.
We're gonna take the right
hand to the left knee
keep that right foot flexed,
press into your right heel
and spread your
right toes like crazy.
Then send your left fingertips
behind you for a little twist.
As you inhale, lift the heart.
And then exhale turn to 
look past your left shoulder.
Inhale, lift and lengthen.
And exhale to release.
We're gonna take
it to the other side.
So right heel comes in.
Left leg goes out,
flex your left foot.
If you want to use that blanket,
that extra blanket
bring it on over.
Come on over,
come on over baby
And then we'll take the
hands to the right rib cage.
And just as if we're
like smearing some honey,
we're gonna smear, smear, smear.
Navel draws in and up.
Find that Uddiyana
Bandha if you're familiar,
that lock here in center,
navel draws in an up.
And,
when you're already pulling
the left hip crease back.
Again, flexing
through the left toes.
We'll take the fingertips behind
the ears, inhale to reach up.
And then exhale, send the 
heart forward hands to rest
either on the earth,
the calves, the ankle
maybe even
grabbing the foot here.
As you're ready, begin to allow
the weight of the
head to come over.
Head to Knee Pose or
Head Toward the Knee Pose.
And you can use
your makeshift bolster
if you like to rest the head.
Listen to the
sound of your breath.
If you have a busy mind, hey,
trust that you
are not alone there.
So just notice the thoughts
and come back to the
sound of the breath.
That's the practice.
Take one more cycle of
breath here, milk it, enjoy it.
And then we'll slowly release.
Spiral the heart to center
and then over to the right.
Left hand to the right knee,
right fingertips behind,
inhale to lift and lengthen.
Keep that left leg super active,
spread the left toes
and then turn to look
past your right shoulder.
Breathe down into your belly.
Find that directional breath.
Lovely.
Come on back to center,
bring the soles
of the feet together,
Cobbler's Pose.
So you're gonna take
your thumbs to the arches
of the feet and just begin
to pull back from the arches
to the top of the foot.
So a little self massage here.
Make sure you're not
too tight, tight up here.
Give yourself a good
amount of space here.
Creating a little diamond shape.
So a little self massage.
If you're like, "Ew, I don't 
want run my feet."
You can wash your
hands after this class.
You should probably wash your
hands after this class anyway.
So maybe own this moment.
So we're taking our
thumbs to the arches,
to the center of
the foot, really,
and then pulling
through the arch.
And if you feel
comfortable with your feet,
or if you're just
feeling kind of open,
don't decide where it ends.
You might start to
massage your toes.
The tops of the feet.
The ankles.
The achilles.
And like the breath practice,
pranayama practice,
you know self
massage is a practice.
It takes kind of a coercing
of the brain and the heart
and the body to say, 
yes, okay, we're gonna do this
and it's going
to serve us, right?
Instead of just waiting
for some external remedy to
take away our anxiety
or massage our shoulders
make us feel better,
make us feel loved.
And, it's not I'm saying 
external remedies,
outside oneself
don't work or not valuable
and awesome because they are
but something
about connecting to
what you already have.
The source of healing and love
that already resides within.
Dude. Love it. Okay.
So from here,
we're going to, we're gonna take
it to a little balancing pose.
So we're gonna
lean back just a bit.
And we're gonna
bring the fingertips
in and underneath the
ankles or the calves.
Now walk the heels up,
come on to the toes.
You're gonna lean back way back.
And we're gonna balance
on the bum here,
lifting the shins
coming into a little
kind of lotus shape.
You can spread
the fingertips here.
We're gonna lift the heart,
lift the chest.
And if you want, 
you can spread the toes.
We're lifting the heart,
lifting the chest
just having a little fun.
This is the core work today.
So a little bit 
every day in some
aspect of centering.
We're breathing deep here.
Smooth, long, deep breaths.
And if you're like, "Man,
I want to do that one day
"but I can't do it yet."
Just do one leg at a time,
getting the core engaged
getting the
coordination too involved
and then you can
switch to the other leg.
And then one day, maybe both.
Beautiful.
Now let that go.
We're gonna come on to our 
backs before we use our props.
Just go ahead and
come on to flat back
so you can keep your
props onto the side.
Oh Benji's so relaxed already.
Good job, buddy.
Way to go.
Come on down,
flat back position.
Take a big full body stretch.
So inhale, reach the
fingertips all the way up
and overhead.
Spread the fingers,
spread the toes, inhale in.
Exhale out.
Inhale in again.
And exhale.
Hug the knees into the chest.
So bring everything in.
Snuggle the
shoulder blades down,
rock a little side to side.
Then just put
your left foot down.
Hold on to your right knee.
Then we're gonna
take the right hand
and we're gonna grab
the right inner arch,
where we were just massaging.
The left hand can
come to rest on the top
of the left hip crease
or even on the ground.
As we inhale, bring the
right foot up to the sky,
right knee stays bent.
So we're gonna find
a little action here
of pushing the right foot,
the sole of the right
foot up towards the sky
and then pulling it
down with the weight of the
right shoulder, the right arm.
So you have a push 
and a pull here.
Super yummy for the hip.
Obviously opening up
through this hamstring.
I have my left foot here
and maybe even my left hand
if I need it for stability.
This is a like a 
Stirrup Posture.
A half Stirrup Posture,
similar to a Happy Baby.
If you want to find soft,
easy movement here you can.
Return to your breath.
Getting snugly in
the hips for sure.
Okay, from here release that.
We're gonna switch.
Hugging the left knee in,
reaching the left
hand to the left arch.
Once you have your
strong base right foot
maybe even right hand.
I like to rest my right hand
on my right hip crease,
but we have options.
Lots of options.
Kick the sole of 
the left foot up.
Breathe deep. Feel that
connection in your low back.
Breathe into your belly.
And again,
it's one thing to just kind of
sling ourself into the shape but
see if you can
find that action here
of kicking the sole of
the foot up towards the sky
and then pulling down
with your left shoulder.
And if there's a little
shake there, that's alright.
Getting into those
good snugly places here.
The left hamstring
getting some sunshine.
Sweet. Then slowly release that.
Both feet touch the
ground for a moment.
Then we press them up
lifting the heels first,
toes, press the knees
up and off the ground.
Hug both knees into the chest.
Now we'll reach around.
Grab the outer
edges of the feet,
kick both soles up 
towards the sky
for Happy Baby Pose.
So lengthen the tail.
So the action here is
to really actively reach
the tail bone towards 
the front edge of the mat.
Not just to hang in space.
Draw the shoulders down,
kick the heels up.
If this is much
too much for your body
do one foot at a time
using that grounding foot
just like we did for
the Stirrup Posture.
And of course, of course, of
course find what feels good.
Now maybe finding 
soft, easy movement,
straightening one leg, 
then the other.
Can start to 
find a little freedom
within the shape,
within the form here
based on how 
you're feeling today.
Close your eyes.
Imagine you're
rolling around in your
favorite sunny spot.
Mine is on the hill at
Barton Springs in my hometown.
You could like transport back
to laying on your
favorite blanket or quilt
or you can pretend
you're a baby animal.
Even if it's a millisecond of
creating a sweet 
image for yourself,
give it a try.
And then we'll come back
to Happy Baby stillness.
And then we'll release.
Feet come to the earth.
Cross your left leg over 
your right like so.
Peek at me if you need to.
Then hug the
knees up to the chest
and take 'em over to the right.
Hands rest
gently on the low ribs
as you turn on your left ear.
Try to drop that
left shoulder down
but you don't need
to force it too hard.
Good, and then
come back to center,
unravel, cross the
right leg over the left.
Same thing on the other side.
Legs go to the left,
turn onto the right ear.
Hands resting
gently on the low ribs,
breathe in.
And breathe out.
And then slowly come back up.
We're gonna grab our props.
If you didn't bring any,
then you're gonna go old school.
You're gonna go traditional,
you're gonna be OG
and just come to
lie on your back. (laughs)
Walk the ankles
out nice and wide.
Let your arms rest
gently at your sides.
If you have a pillow,
go ahead and bring it
underneath your head
or behind your knees.
I'm gonna use the
pillow behind my head,
and then I'm gonna
roll my blanket up
to be behind the knees.
But if you're in a
chilly spot right now
you could roll
up like a burrito.
It's one of my favorite
things to do in yoga. (laughs)
One of my greatest motivations
is rolling up like a burrito
after practice, especially
when it's chilly on the floor.
Or you can just lay a blanket
over the hip creases
just for a little warmth,
a little comfort.
And wherever you find yourself,
take a deep breath in.
And pause the 
top of that breath.
And just hold the
breath for a moment here.
Retain as you feel
yourself suspended.
And then exhale, 
relax the weight of the body.
Let the breath go and 
feel yourself melting
into the earth.
Close your eyes.
Relax the toes and
the feet and the ankles.
See if you can get really still
here as you relax the shins
and the calves and the knees.
And the backs of
the knees and the thighs
and those hamstrings 
that are all nice
and long and strong now.
Let your breath
rest easy as you soften
and relax through 
the hip creases.
Through the bowl of the pelvis
and the glutes, your hips.
Make sure you're
not holding, letting go
of any tension in
the belly, sweet belly,
and the low back.
And the core and the mid back
that we're building all
of the strength within.
Relax there. Relaxing the
whole torso and the ribcage.
The front, the back, the sides,
the armpit chest
and your sweet heart.
Let it rest here.
Relax through the shoulders.
Let your arms and your elbows,
the wrists and the
hands and all of your fingers
get soft and heavy.
Breathe easy as you soften
and relax through the neck
the muscles of
the neck, the throat.
Part the lips as you
soften through your jaw,
relaxing the tongue
in the base of the mouth.
Feel the cool air as
you gently breathe in
through your nostrils,
relaxing through
the skin of the face.
Just imagine your
eyelids getting heavier
as you softened through 
skin of the forehead.
Unfurrowing the brow.
Relaxing the ears,
whatever that means and
relaxing all the way through
the body.
Allowing the head,
the skull to get
very heavy here.
As you snuggle up to stillness.
A total surrender.
An opportunity to
practice letting go.
Then slowly, as you're
ready you can stay nice
and heavy and relaxed here.
Just lean in or snuggle up
to this idea of garnering
or gaining more respect
for your relationship
with your breath here.
As we begin our
second week together.
I'm going up to the idea
of garnering more respect
for the relationship you have
with your breath as we move into
the second week of our journey.
Take a deep breath in.
As you exhale,
palms coming together
and thumbs gently
lift up to the third eye.
You can stay here for a bit
longer after the session is over
or if you have to get moving,
I understand that too.
Just move nice and easy.
See if you can connect the dots
as you stand up and
walk up and off the mat
and into the rest of your day.
Noticing all the ways in which
the practice can sometimes come
off the mat and into
your daily life.
Let's close with an inhale.
Breathing lots of love in.
And one final exhale,
breathing lots of love out.
Thanks for snuggling up
with this Day 8 session.
I love you guys so much,
take good care.
See you tomorrow.
Namaste.
