- Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 22 and 
today we stir it up.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alrighty, welcome back,
my darling friend.
Let's begin today's practice
in Extended Child's Pose.
Come on down on the ground.
If you know this 
shape's not right for you,
as always, choose a 
shape that feels good.
One in which you 
can close your eyes,
soften your heart and 
start to notice your breath.
Taking a moment 
here just to land.
Taking a moment to check 
in with the physical body,
just kind of scanning,
but also today,
as you are 
comfortable and willing,
just taking a second to
scan the rest.
Notice your thoughts.
And your emotional body.
How you feelin'?
Gently begin to 
deepen your breath.
Inhaling lots of love in.
Exhaling lots of love out.
I love regular daily at-home
yoga practice because I really
get this sense that every 
time I show up the practice
or the mat is catching me 
wherever I am that given day,
wherever I land
with whatever I'm bringing
the mat has my back.
And it's true.
So be kind.
Check in with your
physical body today
but if any thing comes up,
the heart space or 
the emotional body,
just notice it, breathe deep,
and remember this practice is
here to support you,
to have your back.
We're gonna slowly start to rock
the head gently side to side.
Massaging the brow bones.
Kind of massaging, 
(clears throat) excuse me,
stimulating this area
around your third eye center.
This is also
sometimes kind of nice
if you have a little
sinus pressure.
Continue to gently 
deepen your breath.
Noticing what it feels 
like to be alive today.
Then bring the head 
back to center stillness.
Reach the fingertips a 
little further out towards
the front edge of your mat.
Nice active arms here.
Inhale, carve a line 
with the nose to look forward.
Exhale to drag the hands back,
lift your heart all the way out.
Keep the knees wide.
We're gonna begin to 
move in a circle here,
inhaling to smooth 
the heart center forward.
And exhaling to come around,
hi buddy, (kisses)
and back through that 
Extended Child's Pose.
Continue, 
inhale to come forward.
Big breath.
Exhale, around and back.
Keep it going with your breath.
Using this time to really find
that hand-to-earth connection.
Checking in with the shoulders,
the side body, the torso.
Getting into the hips.
Nice and easy.
Synchronizing the 
breath with the movement
and the movement 
with the breath.
And then reversing your circle.
Inhaling as you come forward.
Exhaling around and back.
And if you find any spots here
that feel a little crunchy or
sticky (laughs), 
work it out, right?
Find what feels good.
Notice and respond.
Listen and respond.
You can decide what 
tempo feels right here,
moving really slow
or perhaps starting to 
pick up the tempo,
stirring the pot.
Great, and the next time 
you're all the way forward,
go ahead and walk the knees
underneath the hip points,
drag the wrists underneath the
shoulders and let's spread the
fingertips super wide.
Press into the 
tops of the feet here.
Upper arm bones rotate out.
We're gonna lift the heart space
up between the shoulder blades.
So you kind of feel this doming
effect in the upper back body.
Then curl the toes under,
drag the hands back in space,
inhale in.
Think of that contraction 
we did yesterday of
drawing the navel 
up to the spine.
You're gonna use that here as
you lift the knees and let them
hover here in a Hovering Table.
Gaze is straight down.
Again, upper arm bones turn out.
You have it.
Hug the low ribs in for three.
Strong and steady, two,
and slowly lower on the one.
Press into the tops of the feet.
Enjoy this.
Inhale, drop the belly,
open the heart,
the chest forward, Cow Pose.
Exhale, round through,
chin to chest, Cat Pose.
Again, inhale, 
dropping the belly.
And exhale, navel to spine.
Take one more on your own.
Follow your breath.
Then inhale to 
Tabletop Position.
Walk the hands out just a bit.
Maintain that external rotation
of the upper arm bones rotating
out as you curl the 
toes under, inhale in.
And exhale, peel the 
hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Pedal it out here.
Bend one knee 
and then the other.
Make sure you're 
not holding, gripping,
tight in the neck.
Nice, then anchor 
through your left heel,
inhale, lift your 
right leg up high.
Dial the right toes down.
Try to level out 
through the hips.
Press into both palms evenly.
You got this.
Hug the low ribs in.
Find your core connection.
Now bend your right knee,
you're gonna stack 
the right hip over the left.
Opening up, maybe you 
take your gaze underneath
your right armpit here,
breathing deep, inhale.
Exhale, bring your right 
knee all the way through.
Shift it forward, 
upper body's in Plank.
Squeeze your right 
knee up into your chest.
Excellent, then send it back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Take a break if you need to.
You can lower to the knees,
rotate the wrists.
Otherwise, three 
cycles of breath here,
Downward Facing Dog, in and out.
In and out.
Maybe you take a moment here
to find exquisite stillness.
Just for a second.
And if you're on your 
knees, rotating the wrists,
go ahead and join us 
in Downward Facing Dog.
Hips up high and back.
Ground through the fingertips.
So strong
hand-to-earth connection here.
Upper arm bones 
externally rotated.
Anchor through 
the right heel, big inhale,
lift the left leg up high,
Three-Legged Dog.
Dial the left toes down.
Left hip's, should feel like
your left glutes are in line
with each other here.
Claw through the fingertips,
breathe deep.
Good, then bend the left knee.
Here we go, stacking the hips.
Left hip over the right hip.
Right heel's still reaching
towards the ground and working
to press into both palms evenly.
And then maybe I turn my gaze
underneath my left armpit
chest here, breathing deep.
Inhale.
Exhale, carve a line with your
left knee all the way forward up
and in squeeze and lift,
squeeze and lift,
squeeze and lift and then send
it back to Downward Facing Dog.
Awesome, inhale in deeply here.
Exhale, bend your knees,
slowly make your 
way to the top of the mat.
Nice and slow.
We're gonna get 
off these wrists.
Forward Fold at 
the top of your mat.
Shake the head loose here.
Good, then bend the knees.
Let's walk the hands 
now underneath the feet.
So you're gonna bring your toes
right to the wristline here.
Peek at me if you need to.
One foot at a time, 
feet hip width apart or wider
so you have a nice wide stance.
And then again, relax 
the weight of the head over.
Can shake the head a little yes,
a little no and if you want,
you can shift forward towards
the ball joint of your big toe,
ball joint of your pinky toe
and even wiggle the toes
for a little massage here.
Keep breathing.
Hold on to your center.
And then slowly 
release one hand at a time.
Good, tuck the chin, bend the
knees and rise up to Mountain
nice and slow, enjoy this move.
Stack the head over the
heart, the heart over the spine.
And when you're ready,
let's bring the hands
to the waistline here.
Think about drawing your 
shoulder blades together.
Really elbows reaching 
back in towards one another.
And then here's the thing,
my friends,
keep your gaze, 
your eyes straight out,
your focus straight out.
You don't need 
to look down here.
Trust me.
Trust yourself.
Trust that the ground is there
to catch you and you're gonna
walk your feet as 
wide as your mat here,
a little bit wider 
than hip width apart.
And if you did look down,
that's all good.
That's why we're
practicing here, just noticing.
So just bringing a 
little bit of magic.
We've been working so 
beautifully on all of this
awareness and then 
it's funny because in,
you know, our yoga guide, our
yoga buddy will invite us to do
something and we 
have to look down.
So I'm just lovingly inviting
you to think about that.
You know the 
ground is there, so,
alright, more on that later.
Here we go.
We're gonna bend the knees,
soft bend in the knees.
And we're gonna slowly 
bump the hips to the left,
then take them all the way back.
Bump the hips to the right
and then take 
them all the way forward.
And then you're just 
gonna keep moving here,
soft bend in the knees.
Big circles one way.
And most of us at first 
are gonna feel a little foolish,
a little silly.
Some are like, "Ooh, yes.
"So glad this is in the 
practice today. Mmm, get it."
So wherever you're finding
yourself today here with
these hip circles, 
it's okay. It's great.
But I'm gonna ask you 
to lean in a little bit.
Bring your 
breath into the picture.
Maybe even close your eyes or
soften your gaze so you can
really start to 
notice the sensation,
if any, in the hip socket,
in that ball and socket.
Moving with your breath.
If you're practicing 
today with someone,
maybe you give them a little,
"Hey," or something.
Just have fun.
It's okay to have fun.
And then bump the 
hips the other way.
But I'd really, 
really, all fun aside,
like to invite you to pay
attention to the sensations in
that ball and socket joint.
So I find it is helpful to 
kind of soften the gaze
or close your eyes to do that.
Get in there if I can 
do this on YouTube
you can do this at home.
(laughs)
A little slow motion hula hoop.
Alright, then reverse 
the circle once again.
And now reverse it again.
Oh yeah.
And then stand up nice and tall.
Lift up from the pelvic floor.
Nice power pose here.
Same thing, my darling friends.
As Mr. Shakespeare 
once wrote, "See feelingly."
So put your eyeballs in 
the soles of your feet and
walk your feet together.
Try to keep your gaze out,
your focus out.
Bring the feet 
together without looking down.
Just an experiment.
Then when you're ready, inhale,
reach the fingertips up high.
Big stretch, big breath.
And exhale to float it all 
the way down, Forward Fold.
Inhale to lift and lengthen.
Halfway, nice 
flat back position.
Exhale to soften and fold in.
Great, reach for the sky.
Big inhale, big stretch.
Spread the fingertips.
Then back down you go.
Bend the knees, Forward Fold.
Big inhale lifts you 
up halfway, your version.
Lots of space between the
ears and the shoulders here.
Good, and exhale, 
soften and fold in.
Again, inhale, 
reach up towards the sky.
Big breath, big stretch.
Lift your heart.
Exhale, bend and 
fold all the way down.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Long neck.
Exhale, soften and fold inward.
Great, bend the knees.
Plant the palms.
Step the right foot back.
Bend the right knee.
Inhale, sweep 
the arms all way up.
Check it out, today, instead
of leaning into the Crescent,
press into that front foot.
You're gonna 
stack the spine here.
Right toes can stay curled or
you can uncurl for 
a little more stability.
You decide.
Squeeze the inner 
thighs to the midline.
Pull the thumbs back, inhale in.
Exhale, palms come together,
you're gonna bring the outer
edge of the right elbow to
the outer edge 
of the left knee here.
Alright, then we're 
gonna the continue the journey,
pulling the 
left hip crease back.
Beautiful.
Lifting up from 
the pelvic floor.
And we're working to bring the
thumbs in line with the sternum.
Just give you a 
little intention.
Front knee over front ankle.
Nice, long, beautiful neck.
So channel those halfway lifts,
that flat back here.
Now breathe into your belly.
Return to that balloon breath.
Excellent, one more breath here.
If you want to curl 
the back toes under,
lift the back knee,
that is available.
Otherwise, keep 
that back knee lowered.
Good, here we go.
Nice and slow and 
steady from center
come all the way back.
Frame your left 
foot with your hands.
We're gonna lift 
the back knee up.
We're gonna step 
all the way back and up
into Downward Facing Dog.
Good, nice cleansing 
breath here in through the nose.
And exhale out 
through the mouth.
Once more, inhale 
in through the nose.
Exhale out through the mouth.
Nice, bend the knees.
Inhale to carve a line
with the nose, look forward.
Exhale to make your
way to the top, your version.
Good, here we go 
with the breath in.
Lift up halfway, 
nice flat back position.
And exhale to 
soften and fold inward.
Nice, fingertips 
come to the earth.
Here we go.
Step the left foot back.
Left foot back.
Lower the left knee.
And here we go.
We're gonna lift up,
reaching fingertips 
forward, up and back.
Come all the way up out 
of that front hip to start.
Pull the right hip crease back.
Stack head over heart,
heart over pelvis.
Now find your strong connection
through that back foot.
Make a choice.
Inhale to lift up 
through the heart.
Exhale, palms kiss together.
We're gonna think up and over,
bringing the left elbow up and
over towards the outer 
edge of that right thigh.
Front knee stays 
over the front ankle
and we find our twist here.
Breathing deep into the belly.
Working to get those 
thumbs toward heart center.
Nice, long, beautiful neck here.
Think about lifting 
up from the pelvic floor.
Tuck the chin just slightly.
You're doing great.
Breathe deep.
Stay here, or if you lift the
back knee on the right leg maybe
you try it here on the left leg.
Nice work.
Inhale in.
Use your exhale 
to guide it back.
Frame the right 
foot with your hands.
And here we go, stepping it
back to Downward Facing Dog,
awesome.
Claw through the fingertips.
Let's do a Lion's Breath.
Big inhale in through the nose.
Exhale, tongue out.
Great, anchor 
through the left heel.
Listen carefully, inhale, 
lift the right leg up high.
This time, again, 
bend the right knee,
stack the right 
hip over the left.
Great. Inhale.
Exhale, carve a line with the
right knee all the way up and
over to kiss the right elbow.
Shift forward.
Upper body's in Plank.
Good, then kick it back up,
Three-Legged Dog.
Down Dog Splits.
Great. Lower the 
right foot down.
Switch, second side.
Inhale, Three-Legged Dog.
Bend your left knee.
As you're ready, keep 
breathing, stack the hips.
Great, inhale in.
Exhale, carve a line.
Think up and over with 
the left knee all the way
up, up, up, over an imaginary
hurdle to kiss the left elbow.
Gaze straight down.
Good, then kick it up,
Three-Legged Dog.
And slowly lower, 
Downward Facing Dog.
Awesome.
Bend the knees.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale to make 
your way to the top.
Inhale, halfway lift,
your version.
Find length in the neck.
And exhale, soften and fold.
Root to rise here.
Spread the fingertips.
Here we go. Big inhale, 
reach up towards the sky.
Big beach ball up and overhead.
On the exhale, 
drop to shoulders down,
keep the fingertips spreading.
Fingertips reaching 
high up towards the sky.
Ground through the feet.
Big inhale.
Big beach ball going overhead.
Think up and over as you exhale.
Take that beach ball 
over towards the left.
Bump your hips to the right.
Tuck the chin just slightly.
Big side body stretch here.
Inhale to spread 
the fingertips, reach.
Exhale to come back to center.
Inhale, send the 
fingertips up high.
And exhale over to the right.
Bump the hips to the left.
Keep those low ribs hugging in.
Hold on to your center.
Inhale.
Exhale, back to Volcano.
Stand up tall.
Inhale, look up.
Exhale, palms come together
and let's slice it right down
through, Forward Fold.
Bend your knees generously here.
Little love for the low back.
And then on your next inhale,
lift it up halfway, long neck.
Good, exhale, soften and fold.
Beautiful, beautiful.
We're gonna plant the palms,
step one foot back.
Step the other foot back,
Plank Pose.
Inhale to look forward,
shift forward.
Exhale, squeeze those elbows
into the side body and slowly
lower all the way down to your
belly or to your blue heeler.
Press in the tops of the feet.
Inhale, Cobra.
Be gentle.
And exhale to 
soften and fold in.
From here you're
gonna press up to all fours
or Downward Facing Dog, 
your choice.
We're headed 
towards One-Legged Pigeon.
Whether you're on all 
fours or in the Down Dog,
let's inhale, 
lift the right leg up.
Nice and easy, start to soften
out all the hard edges here.
We're gonna bring the right
knee all the way up and in.
We'll walk that
right ankle towards
the front left 
corner of the mat.
Maybe, or we'll keep the right
heel close in towards center.
You're here, or you're here or
you're somewhere in-between.
Keep the feet 
nice and energized.
Press into the 
top of the back foot
and when you're ready, 
find length.
Lift up through the chest.
Lengthen through the crown.
And then slow and 
steady we'll fold inward.
So you can create a little
pillow with the forearms
for the forehead.
You can reach the 
fingertips forward,
rest your head on the earth.
Maybe sometimes creating 
a little like bubble gum,
bubble gum in a dish,
mudra vibes.
Some people are like, "Yes!"
Most people are like, 
"What is she talking about?"
But just create a little 
pillow with the fist for
your forehead here, 
your third eye.
So we want to get to a place
here today where we can really
be here with nice, 
full conscious breath.
So you should not be in pain,
but we do want to be in a place
where we can observe sensation.
And you can make a 
little adjustments,
never feel like 
you're stuck, right?
It's something we're going to
be talking about in an upcoming
practice, you know.
Does it make me happy?
Does it feel good?
And if not, what can I change?
Spoiler alert.
Okay, take a deep 
breath in wherever you are.
And use your exhale to 
soften into the posture,
to relax your shoulders,
relax your jaw.
Relax your jaw.
Close your eyes,
my sweet friend.
And just observe, listen 
to the sound of your breath.
Move nice and slow here.
Inhale in.
Exhale, soft, easy movement.
You're gonna rock the 
hips gently left to right.
Barely moving.
Tiny, tiny, tiny movement.
Keep breathing, keep listening.
This practice is 
designed to support you.
Stay with it.
And soft and easy, almost as if
you were moving through water,
just hang with me, you're gonna
slowly start to rise back up.
Don't rush, 
don't rush, don't rush.
Keep your feet 
kind of bright, energized.
And here you go, you're
gonna come on to the right hip.
We're gonna guide the 
left knee all the way up.
Left leg all the 
way up, up, up, up,
up, up over there 
and we're gonna come into
Gomukhasan Legs or Cow Legs.
So we've been 
here before together.
So if this is about as far as
that leg goes, then go here.
Otherwise we're gonna continue,
keep the feet active.
We're gonna work 
to stack the knees
and we're gonna 
walk the feet out just a bit.
Just do your best.
Alright?
This is a great moment to maybe
recruit your 
blanket or your towel.
Sit up a little bit,
lift the hips.
Hands can come to the 
soles of the feet or the ankles
or you can use 
fingertips on the ground.
Not gonna be here long.
So breathe deep.
Use that directional breath.
Find stillness.
Lift up through the chest.
If you have really, 
you already have open hips,
you know, maybe just 
anatomically or you've been
practicing for a while, 
go ahead and take it forward.
But keep that left hip heavy.
And if you're new and 
you want to practice without,
you absolutely can.
Just keep the chest open.
Shoulder blades drawing together
as long as possible
as you lean forward.
Breathe.
So the hips don't lie.
Just keep noticing how you feel.
If you start to feel 
a little tender hearted,
I got your back.
Stirring it up.
Yoga, it's powerful 
mind-body work.
Okay, one more breath, inhale.
Use your exhale to find that
connection, that contraction.
This is gonna 
stabilize this transition.
So here we go.
Navel draws in and up.
We're just gonna go 
right back the way we came,
all the way back through.
Through the Pigeon.
And then to all fours or
Downward Facing Dog, 
your choice.
Make a choice.
In Tabletop or Down Dog,
take a deep breath in.
Empty it out through the mouth.
Good, here we go, second side.
Soft and easy, 
bend the left knee.
Slide it all the way up.
Left ankle towards the front
right corner of the mat
or keep it hugged in.
Strong back leg.
Notice what it 
feels like on this side.
Inhale to lift your heart.
And exhale to fold inward,
your version.
Take your time.
Pay attention, pay attention.
As you're ready,
close your eyes.
Snuggle up to whatever...
Whatever feedback 
this shape is giving you.
It's okay to 
make adjustments here.
Stay curious.
No judgment.
Whatever you find, 
greet it with a nice,
deep, loving, inhale in.
And a long, loving exhale out.
Notice where you might 
be clenching or holding.
See if you can soften
and as you're ready,
perhaps welcoming that 
gentle rock ever so slight
of the hips back 
and forth left to right.
Subtle body movement.
Inhale deeply.
And exhale to empty it out.
Catch a wave with this breath.
Here we go, big inhale.
And empty it out.
Nice and slow, as if you 
are moving through water,
use your hands to press back up.
Stay focused inward.
We're gonna bring the 
left hip to the ground,
keep the feet active.
Swing right leg around.
Maybe we just come 
right foot to the earth.
We've been here before or
we'll work to come to Cow Legs,
Gomukhsan Legs, 
bringing the knees together.
The ankles, the feet come out.
We keep nice active feet.
Sit up nice and tall.
Again, hips don't lie, you
don't have to do much here.
Don't feel like you 
have to come forward.
If that's available to you,
that's great.
But if not, 
just be here with it.
Be here with it.
Close your eyes.
You're doing great.
Active feet.
Breathe.
Take one more deep breath in.
And nice cleansing exhale,
begin to unravel.
Again, we're just gonna reverse.
Going back the way we came.
Coming through that Pigeon.
Your version.
And then back to 
Downward Facing Dog
or Tabletop Position 
just for one breath.
Here we go.
Inhale in through the nose.
Exhale out through the mouth.
Good.
Slow descend on the 
knees down if they're up,
swing the legs to one side
everyone and we're going to come
through to a nice 
cross-legged seat.
If you have a 
little extra time today,
you want to come to lay
flat on your back, please do.
Take a second.
Palms come 
together at the heart.
Anjuli Mudra, just 
notice how you feel.
Close your eyes.
Just but a moment more here
to reside in the 
role of the observer.
Way to stir it up today.
Way to be brave.
Way to keep showing up.
I love you guys.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale, bow all the way down.
Nice stretch in the low back.
Bow all the way to the earth.
And we whisper
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
