- What's up everyone? 
Welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and this is
Benji and today we have a sweet
practice that's gonna help
you reunite with your breath.
So hop into something 
comfy and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Alrighty my friends, 
let's begin today's practice
lying on our backs.
You can lay a blanket 
out if you want to today.
Get nice and cozy 'cause we're
gonna stay nice and low to the
ground, focusing on 
the power of thy breath.
Come on down, when you get
there we're gonna begin in this
constructive resting 
posture by bringing the feet
as wide as your mat.
Nice and wide.
And then allowing the knees to
fall in so they rest together.
Get nice and comfy here.
Snuggle the 
shoulder blades together
and bring your 
hands to your belly.
So you want to come into a
position where you can feel
comfortable and relaxed.
Once you get settled in here
tuck your chin slightly to
create slight length 
in the back of the neck
and then close your eyes, baby.
Thank you for selecting this
video and thank you for taking
some time out of your day
to reunite with your breath.
I believe in the power (laughs)
of reuniting with the breath and
I hope this little 
ditty here today serves you.
So with the hands on the belly,
the eyelids closed and heavy,
start to notice the 
parts of your body that
are touching the earth.
And as you bring your attention
or your awareness to those
parts, really 
notice the pressure,
the connection that
you feel in the feet,
the elbows, 
the muscles of the back,
the skull.
Kind of grounding 
down in this moment.
And then begin 
to bring your attention to
the rhythm of your breath.
And as we secure 
the body in stillness,
let the gross body, 
the big picture body
remain heavy and still
and see if you can allow
your breath to start
to move your subtle body.
And if you're like, 
"Cool, got it," great.
And if you're like, 
"What does that mean?"
Just explore what 
that could mean for you.
You don't always have to
know what exactly you're doing.
There's a little bit of a
tendency on the mat with asana
and with breath to 
want to get it right.
And so
it's my pleasure to
remind you that it's not about
getting it right, 
it's about exploring.
Getting curious.
Bringing more 
consciousness to your breath.
And to your life!
Hopefully by now 
you've started to
take a couple deep inhalations.
Catching the wave of the
breath even if it's only once.
Big full inhale in.
Long exhale out.
And then notice how a big full,
conscious breath makes you feel.
And then
with the eyes closed and 
the body nice and heavy here,
just start to lift the
corners of the mouth slightly
and send some love
out into the 
world knowing and
maybe just understanding,
accepting, enjoying, celebrating
that there are so many 
people practicing this very
practice with you right 
now and I think that's cool.
So as you are uniting or
reuniting with your 
breath here today,
wherever you are in the world,
you're also uniting or
reuniting with people
who are reuniting with 
their breath or their spirit.
Alright, go ahead and 
open the eyes nice and slow.
Bat the eyelashes open.
We're gonna walk the feet all
the way together now and just
take the knees in the opposite
direction so we're gonna open
the knees out wide.
Reclined Cobbler's Pose 
as we start to open the hips.
Let gravity do 
a bit of the work.
We're changing the shape so
we're gonna change the breath so
interlace the fingertips, 
bring them behind the head.
You can extend your 
thumbs to cradle the neck.
You'll start to feel a stretch
in the groin, the inner thigh.
Stretch in the armpit chest,
in the shoulder.
And then start to use your
breath to create more space.
So breath a nice, 
full lateral breath into
the side body here, to the ribs.
Here we go.
Deepening the breath.
You can use your 
thumbs to gently massage
the back of the 
head if you like.
And we're just 
slowing things down.
So it doesn't always 
have to be about
harder, faster, stronger.
The breath is the base,
the baseline.
Take one more 
deep inhale in here.
Breathe into all 
four sides of the torso.
Then as you exhale you're 
gonna slowly lift the head,
lift the heart, 
lift the shoulders,
lift the elbows and just connect
to the muscles of the abdominal
wall but see if you 
can continue with deep
conscious breath as you do so.
Breathing deep here.
Keeping the gaze up.
Lots of space between 
the chin and the chest.
We're not doing 
a full crunch here
but keeping the 
neck nice and long.
Challenging ourselves 
to breathe deep within
this contraction of the core.
Keeping the skin of the face
soft and easy, jaw relaxed.
Good, then take one 
more deep breath in here.
And exhale to slowly release.
You'll bring the hands to
the outer edges of the legs.
Close the knees together.
Then scoop the knees 
up towards the chest.
Get your low back nice 
and flush with the mat.
Should feel really good.
Give yourself a big hug and
now breathe deep 
into your belly here.
Nice, full conscious breaths.
So there's not a lot going on
here on purpose so that you can
reunite and focus on 
those deep inhalations
and those long exhalations.
So basically you 
have to bring the breath.
Take one more cycle 
of breath in and out.
And I love this idea of 
cycle of breath because
that's what's going on, right?
Constant cycle of breath, right?
If you catch yourself 
holding your breath,
eventually you're gonna breathe
again otherwise what happens?
You die so keep your breath,
that cycle of 
breath or spirit going.
And then let's bring the hands
to the back of the thighs now
for a little rock and roll move.
You're gonna rock up and
down the length of your spine.
If this is difficult,
no worries.
I love the humility that also
comes with a yoga practice,
especially an at-home practice
where you kind of let your guard
down and really allow
yourself to be yourself.
And eventually we'll 
meet all the way up
in a nice cross-legged seat.
You can take a second to move
the fleshy part of 
the buttocks aside.
Find length up 
through the crown of the head.
And then just 
allow your hands to rest
wherever they comfortably fall.
So on the knees or the thighs.
Maybe in the lap.
Excellent.
So we have many 
pranayama videos on the channel.
You can check them out.
We have breath of fire,
skull shining breath.
We have Ujjayi breath.
We have alternate 
nostril breathing.
So if you want to go a little
bit deeper learning breath
techniques I will 
post links to those videos
in the description down below.
Belly breath, all of these
wonderful pranayama techniques.
But today it's about just
returning to that relationship,
that connection with a 
big inhale and a long exhale.
So nice conscious breath.
So just come into 
a quiet seat here.
As you feel comfortable 
close your eyes again,
tuck your chin to lengthen
through the back of the neck and
try to find this lateral breath.
And, in fact, 
take your hands really fast
to your rib cage here so we can 
play with the lateral breath.
And what you 
want to is to find this
expansion of the ribs 
out as you breathe in.
And then a gentle
softening as you breathe out.
So let's give it a 
couple tries here on your own.
Feeling the ribs expand and lift
as you breathe in and soften and
gently retract 
as you breathe out.
And then you can keep the hands
there if you really like it or
allow the hands 
to rest gently and
just keep this nice full,
expansive inhale going and
this long, slow exhalation.
And then notice where your
thoughts go and remember
that's all part of the game.
Mind and body working together.
So just acknowledge 
the thoughts and remember
to reunite with your breath.
Return to the breath.
The breath always comes first.
And then slowly bat the 
eyelashes open once again.
So we're gonna end with a super
duper duper simple vinyasa and
if this practice inspires you to
pick up a more physical practice
after this, awesome, that's what
we want but what I really want
is to establish or re-establish,
reunite us with the importance
of the value of having a strong
relationship with the breath.
I mean honestly 
it has saved my life.
So I think it's 
worthy of our time.
It's not always
about chaturangas, right or...
So ending with a 
super simple vinyasa.
We're gonna bring the 
fingertips to the sides.
You're gonna pull the pinkies
back so you can open up through
the chest, the heart space and
really un-crumple 
through the torso.
Right, finding that 
length in the spine.
On the inhale you're 
gonna dial the thumbs back,
pinkies forward, and slowly
bring the palms all the way up.
Wrists over the shoulders.
On the exhale you're 
gonna take the palms,
excuse me, thumbs forward,
pinkies back and press the palms
down towards the earth,
fingertips kiss the ground.
So the thing is you 
want your full inhale
to fuel this gesture
and you want your full 
exhale to fuel this gesture.
And the kind of 
trick or challenge,
loving challenge today is I only
want you to reach the fingertips
up as high as your breath goes.
So you really kind of wire or
re-wire the brain to 
unite with the breath.
So for example just a
little demo in case you're like,
"Yeah, I got this dude.
It's super easy." Pay attention.
For example the inhale down in
my belly initiates the thumbs
going back and I'm 
only going to inhale,
or reach my fingertips 
up as far as my inhale goes.
So I inhale to my max 
capacity and my hands are here,
this is where I'm
stopping baby. 'Kay?
Same thing on the way down.
Exhale, I'm gonna try to
use that breath out to empty,
empty, empty, empty, empty,
empty all the way down
and if this is where 
I land and not here,
I'm gonna stop here.
So I'm going to try to be 
really true to the breath.
Marry the breath to the movement
and marry the 
movement to the breath.
Virtual high five.
Okay, here we go.
Pull the pinkies back.
Lift your heart.
Let's see what happens.
Inhale, open the thumbs,
reach it up high.
Only go as far as your inhale
and then when that breath stops
you've hit the max capacity
turn the thumbs down and in,
pinkies out, palms press down
and you use your exhale
to float the fingertips down.
Only go as far 
as your breath goes.
Empty, empty, empty.
And then inhale.
So keep it going.
I'm not gonna cue you so you can
really practice being 
true to your breath.
If you don't make it that high
on the inhale or make it all the
way down on 
the exhale, that's okay.
That's part of this experience.
Part of this learning process
and it's definitely something
I want you to experience.
So I'm gonna do my own practice
here and I'll let you do yours
and we'll see what we discover.
Wherever you are, keep it going.
Don't stop. 
For these last couple rounds,
the last couple cycles of breath
you might, if 
you're in a good place,
integrate the neck or the nose
and you can think about your
nose traveling in 
line with your fingertips.
Inhaling, sending the gaze up
and then exhaling gently
sending the gaze down.
Don't give up.
Do one more 
cycle wherever you are.
Now wherever your are let's all
together as one inhale reach the
fingertips all the way up.
This time let the palms 
come all the way together.
Namaste and then exhale
hands slowly melt 
down to your heart space.
Take a second to 
relax your shoulders.
Relax your jaw and 
just notice how you feel.
And allow whatever you 
discoveries you made
to just settle in here.
Reuniting with the breath.
Gently close your eyes, 
bow your head to your heart.
Remember the breath 
is always there for you.
And so am I.
Love you guys.
Thanks for sharing your 
time and energy with me
and the 
Yoga With Adriene community.
Let us know how this 
went for you down below.
In particular this section and
I hope you have an 
amazing rest of the day.
Namaste.
