Hi, everyone, welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 6, baby.
(mimicking lasers)
Ignite.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alright friends, let's 
come on down to the ground.
We're gonna begin 
lying flat on our backs.
As always, take your 
time and getting there.
Maybe you're a little 
excited for today's practice.
Maybe you are 
falling a little bit more
in the category of dread.
Do not worry.
Do not dread anything.
Remember you even just 
in this journey thus far,
you have the tools to 
approach everything with
both a discipline, 
a attention to the action,
but also you have no 
this idea of softness. Right?
Working for yourself 
rather than against.
So, you know, 
it's okay to have feelings,
but just pay attention and let's
try to integrate all of the
things that we have 
introduced thus far
in our iconic Day 6 practice.
Okay, here we go.
Knees are bent.
If you're not already here,
go ahead and bring the 
soles of the feet to the mat.
And let's just take a second,
let the hands come to the belly,
this deep place of listening and
you can even give 
your belly a little rub.
If you want to be extra, you can
do a little clockwise circle for
digestion just to 
kind of move the stomach
chi a bit there or 
you can find stillness.
And let's just take a second to
relax everything into the earth.
And start to feel your breath.
Perhaps a moment of gratitude
here for showing up as you are.
And all we can do 
when we show up
is be present with what is.
This is what the yoga practice
asks of us lovingly.
So do your best.
Each day we show up in attempt
to simply be present with what
is, and then 
one day you realize,
"Oh, I'm little stronger here.
"Oh, I'm moving from my middle,
from my center,
"a little more here."
Finding more ease, not 
getting caught or hung up
on the usual things.
So our patterns start to change.
But if you can today, 
as we work on core strength
try your best to 
not focus on the outcome
or where you should be, 
but you don't feel you are.
Just be present.
One present moment, 
a window to the next.
Let's take a deep breath in
and enjoy a long exhale out.
And two more just like that.
Inhale in.
And a long breath out.
And on this next one, think of
all of the people around the
world breathing 
together in this moment even.
Big inhale.
And exhaling as one.
I love it.
Alright, interlace the 
fingertips, open your eyes.
Bring the hands behind the head.
We're going to return to
this idea of the neck hammock.
In fact, let's 
implement a little self massage.
Can never not benefit 
from a little self massage.
Hey-oh, Okay.
Here we go.
Elbows nice and wide.
We're gonna 
scoop the tailbone up.
Bring the low back 
really flush with the mat.
You should feel your spinal
column kind of magnetically
being drawn down to the earth,
down to your yoga mat.
Great, inhale in here.
Stay grounded through 
all four corners of the feet.
Just notice some patterns here,
no right or wrong but notice if
your knees, excuse me, your toes
come out and then therefore your
knees or in and see if you can
get a get a feeling for them
kind of moving straight forward.
Alright, empty out your breath.
And here we go, inhale 
in together, elbows wide.
And then exhale, 
you're going to lift head,
neck, shoulders, elbows,
nice and wide all the way up.
We want to feel the low belly,
the low abdominals and the upper
abdominals draw in, 
cinch in towards the center.
This is that third chakra.
It's why I'm wearing 
the gold today. (chuckles)
Such a nerd.
All the way in 
towards that center.
This is this energetic center
that stimulates confidence,
the kind of I am affirmation.
This sense of 
knowing one's self.
This feeling of home.
The Huddah, right?
The center.
We're here for three.
If you're not feeling it, 
take your gaze up and back
and scoop your tailbone up.
Two, one.
Awesome, lower.
(chuckles) Sorry.
Inhale in.
Exhale again.
Lift the gaze up.
Really try to peel your
shoulder blades off the earth.
And if you're like,
"I'm trying."
Great, that's all I can ask for.
Scoop the tailbone up,
press into the ball 
joint of the big toe.
We're still creating a 
one hundred and ten percent
full body experience.
Thinking of the 
body as one moving part.
Not these isolated, 
you know, abdominals.
See if you can 
lift a little higher,
create more of a sensation 
in the center by drawing
the low belly in, 
hugging the low ribs in.
Oops, my elbows have 
come in to compensate,
so I'm going to 
open them wide again.
Yes, here you go for three.
Breathe deep, two.
One, lower.
Now we're going to 
move with the breath.
Inhale to lower, exhale to lift.
Ready, big breath 
in all together.
Exhale, lift.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Mindful controlled movement.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Lift high.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Need more?
You're gonna lift the
shins parallel to the ceiling.
We've been here 
before on our journey.
Inhale to lower, 
exhale to lift, take it away.
So feet can be on the ground.
Maybe even you just experiment
with lifting the heels or
if we need a little 
more fire, ignite it,
baby, by lifting the 
shins parallel to the ceiling.
Inhale the lower,
exhale the lift.
So remember your 
softening practice.
Are there areas that are working
a little bit too hard right now?
Can we be more efficient,
more mindful with 
the breath and the body?
You should feel a bit of fire.
Keep it going.
You got it.
Three more.
Awesome.
After the last one,
nice and easy,
you're in hug the 
knees up to the chest,
bring the palms to 
the kneecaps, inhale in.
Exhale, draw the 
knees out towards
the front edge of the mat.
Pause here.
Soften through 
the feet, the ankles.
You can wiggle them.
Kick, kick, kick.
Inhale lots of love in.
And exhale, lots of love out.
Excellent. Slide the hands 
to the backs of the thighs.
You're gonna rock 
all the way up to seated.
Take a nice easy 
twist to one side, any side.
Use your inhale to lift you.
And exhale to release.
Oh, sweet Benji.
Inhale to the other side.
Lift, lift, lift.
And exhale.
Beautiful.
Back to center.
Here we go.
We're going to come 
forward on all fours.
Continue to find active breath.
Inhale to drop the belly.
Pause here.
Feel that length.
Think long, Puppy belly.
Here's an example.
Long puppy belly.
Long puppy belly.
And then on your 
next exhalation, contract.
Navel draws up and in.
Cat Pose.
So inhale, drop the belly.
Expansion, open 
through the chest.
Inhale, expansion.
Exhale, contraction.
Cat Pose.
Alrighty, inhale nice neutral
spine, Tabletop Position.
Walk the hands forward.
You're gonna curl 
the right toes under,
send the right heel back, press
away from your yoga mat as you
curl the left toes under.
Send the left heel back.
Nice wide stance with the feet.
Wrists are 
underneath the shoulders.
Palms spread wide, Plank Pose.
If you get here 
and it's too much,
come to the knees 
and maintain this
nice long line 
from crown to tail.
Core engaged.
Alright, now find a soft,
easy motion here,
left to right.
Breathe deep.
And now front and back.
Kind of a sawing effect.
Front and back.
Front and back.
And here we go.
Left to right again.
Soft and easy.
Left to right.
Yes, beautiful.
And now front and back.
You got this, front and back.
Stick with it.
Front and back.
Excellent, lower the knees.
Then slowly ease all 
the way to the belly.
Beautiful.
Drag the hands in line with
the top of the rib cage here.
Bottom of the rib cage,
excuse me.
And then here we go, 
pressing into the pubic bone.
Inhale, tuck the chin, 
roll it up, Cobra.
Meet your edge here.
Crest and fall.
Bring it down.
Two more just like that.
Inhale to rise.
And exhale to fall.
So here's the thing, 
if I'm new to the practice,
I'm probably here.
Do a little baby Bhujangasana,
strengthening the back to
support the core and 
then we'll build the core,
right, to support the back.
So find nice low 
Bujanasana, if you like.
Okay, here we go.
Curling the toes under.
Inhale in.
Exhale, press up, power up.
Plank, you got this.
Strong base.
Here we go.
Left to right with the hips.
Left to right.
And front to back.
Good left to right.
You got this.
Breathe deep.
And front to back.
And one more.
You got this.
Here we go.
Left to right.
Ay, and then front to back.
Excellent, 
slowly lower the knees.
Gently come onto the belly.
Set the hands in 
line with the rib cage,
squeeze the elbows in.
Inhale, Cobra.
Exhale forehead to the mat.
Benji's paws smell like Frito's.
This kind of thing.
Inhale, rise up.
And exhale.
One more.
Follow your breath.
Beautiful.
Here we go.
Curl the toes under.
Inhale in.
Exhale, contract.
Navel draws up 
just like in Cat Pose
as you lift up to your Plank.
Here we go, left to right.
Maybe this time a 
little bit more of a hip dip.
Maybe not.
Maybe you keep it small.
Back and forth.
I know. I know.
And here we go.
Front to back.
Front to back.
Front to back.
Front to back.
Now, side to side.
Maybe dip.
Maybe dip (chuckles)
and front to back.
Here we go.
Front to back.
One more time.
You got this side to side.
You can keep it small.
Keep it small.
And front to back.
Here we go.
Front to back, front to back.
And lower the knees.
Come all the 
way on to the belly.
Nice.
Inhale, rise up.
Find a softness.
Exhale, crest and fall.
Keep those elbows are being in.
Inhale, rise up.
Catch a wave.
And exhale, release.
Think liquid spine.
Your's can be really baby, too.
Baby liquid spine.
Inhale, rise.
Exhale, fall.
Here we go, curl the toes under.
Inhale in.
Exhale, press up, power up.
Look down.
Quietly whisper to yourself,
"I am strong."
I am strong.
Then send the 
hips up high and back.
Downward Facing Dog.
Breathe in, breathe out.
Breathe in.
Empty it out.
Big inhale.
Empty it out.
Let something go.
Yes. Alright, here we go.
Baby steps to 
the top of the mat.
Take your time. 
Baby steps. Baby steps.
When you get to 
the top of the mat,
you're gonna widen the feet and
then we're gonna just nice and
easy, ease down into it.
So slow soft 
movement with control,
we're going to come down
into a little bit of a squat.
Woo, breathe.
And then from here, we're
gonna use our hands behind us to
support us as we 
come through to a seat.
You can center 
yourself on the mat.
Take a deep breath in.
Relax your 
shoulders as you breathe out.
Alright, then here we go.
We're gonna lean back.
Hands are gonna come to the
backs of the 
thighs here to start.
And nice and easy 
we're gonna use
all of these tools that 
we've been building
working on together. This lift 
up through the front body,
this grounding 
through the back body.
Come in to Boat.
So come into this version first,
even if you can come here,
let's start here.
Working with the 
energetic body here,
making sure that it's 
along for our smooth sailing
before we kind of 
just jerk ourselves
into the pose, you know?
So just come here and 
you're just like a sweet Boat.
You can even rock a little side
decided a little booty massage
floating down stream.
Another option here at this
stage is maybe to bring the
hands behind you.
So we're engaging the 
abdominal wall a little more,
but we still have 
the support of the earth.
And then third option would
be to take the fingertips out.
Let's open the palms here.
Lift the chest, breathe deep.
Alright, keep breathing.
Relax your shoulders.
Anytime you need 
to take a break, take it.
It's all good but see if you 
can today on Day 6, Ignite.
See if you can meet 
your appropriate edge.
Maybe taking one more 
cycle of breath right
when you want to give up.
When your mind is like (huffs).
Okay?
We're going to lower and lift.
Okay, we got this.
Inhale to lower.
Low Boat.
Exhale to lift.
Feel free to grab your legs.
I love it.
Inhale to lower, open chest.
Exhale to lift.
In fact, everyone 
give yourself a squeeze.
Maybe even a kiss on the knee.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Change your 
mind about it. Right?
That's why I like 
this silly stuff.
Why not?
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
We can use the 
hands behind us too.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.

Exhale to lift.
You have three more.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Squeeze it in, reset.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Last one.
If you've taken a break,
maybe you come in 
for this last one here.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Awesome, bring the 
soles of feet to the ground.
Hook your elbows on your knees.
If you practiced with me before
you know this is one of my
favorite yoga poses.
You can clasp opposite 
wrists with opposite hand.
Take a deep breath in.
And go inward.
Go home.
Relax the weight 
of your head over.
Relax everything 
and just notice.
Notice your breath.
Feel that length in the neck.
Soften any tension in 
the face or in the shoulders,
the fingers, the toes.
Inhale in.
Exhale to lift the 
head and rise back up.
Don't think.
Here we go.
Do you trust me?
Boat Pose.
Lean back, lift your heart.
(laughs)
Another Titanic reference?
Wow, I've outdone myself.
So we have choices.
Hands on the ground.
Hands here, here,
we can also work,
you know, maybe,
just maybe creating our
own little modification. Right?
You got this.
We got this.
Inhale to lower.
Here we go.
Big breath in lower, low Boat.
Exhale to lift.
Stay focused.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Inhale the lower.
Hollow body, look up.
Exhale.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Okay, on the next one,
inhale to lower.
Take it to the left.
Lean over to 
your left butt cheek.
Exhale to lift.
Inhale to lower, right side.
Exhale to lift.
Inhale to lower.
I like I said butt cheek 
instead of glute.
(laughs) Exhale to lift.
Inhale on to your 
right glute, lower.
Exhale to lift.
Inhale lower left butt cheek.
Exhale to lift.
Inhale to lower #rightbuttcheek.
Exhale to lift.
Keep it going.
Be mindful of your neck here.
Inhale, lower, left side.
Exhale, lift.
Inhale, lower.
Do you feel that warmth?
Exhale, lift.
Not just the fire 
in your belly. Keep going.
But maybe this 
warmth in your back.
This precious warmth 
in the back of your neck
and behind your ears.
Pay attention.
Alright, here we go.
Back to center.
Squeeze your knees in.
Wherever you are, meet me here.
Three more.
Inhale just right in the center.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
It's getting harder, I know.
Inhale to lower.
Exhale to lift.
Squeeze and lift.
Here we go, one more time.
Let's do it all together now.
Let's do it. Here we go.
Inhale to lower, look up.
Exhale to lift.
Squeeze, toes touch the earth,
heels touch the earth,
hook the elbows 
on the knees and bow.
That's it.
You did great.
It's not easy.
And there's so many 
things we encounter,
right, off the 
mat that are not easy.
But we use this time,
the asana practice,
this breath work
almost like as a 
precursor training
so that we are more 
prepared to handle the
difficult things in 
a way that feels good,
that feels like home.
It feels like us.
Where we have control.
Not just a victim 
to our environment
but we can respond with 
grace and with strength.
Lift your head gently.
You killed it.
And even if you struggle,
you killed it because 
it is kind of the point.
Come on down on the ground.
Let's do some love,
some more love,
different kind of love.
Hug the knees into the chest.
You're gonna take the 
palms to the kneecaps,
draw circles one 
way and then the other.
Take some big 
cleansing breaths here, will ya?
Seeing if you can 
extend your inhalation,
make it really 
long and really full.
And then extend your exhalation.
Make it really long.
Empty, empty, empty.
Great, drop the heels
back where we started, knees up.
This time palms on the ground.
Bridge Pose, 
toes pointing forward.
Snuggle the shoulder 
blades in and together.
Big inhale to find that long
puppy belly again as you lift
the hips up high, sits bones
reach towards the backs of the
heels, shins reach forward.
Low ribs kind of hug in even
though we're lifting the hip
points actively 
up, up, up and forward.
You can take your 
hands to your ribs here,
breathe into your sweet belly.
Let's all make a 
commitment to be kinder
and more loving to ourselves.
But in particular, 
this area of the body,
the belly, our power center
that we suck in 
and hide and kind of
treat a little poorly.
I promise to do 
better if you do as well.
We owe it to ourselves.
Big inhale.
Exhale, let it all go.
Bring the feet together,
knees wide.
Let your hands rest 
gently on the belly.
Feel the rise and 
fall of the breath here.
Just taking a moment to
relax. (chuckles)
Allow your breath to 
return to a comfortable rhythm.
And take one knee, any knee,
and you're gonna bring it in and
you're just gonna turn 
onto one side, any side
come into a fetal position.
I'd like to invite you to really
hike your knees up so that you
get a nice 
curve in the low back.
You can use your 
bottom bicep as a pillow
and just take a second here.
There all these little moments 
for me in the at-home yoga
practice where 
we have a chance to
really feel the love 
and practice that self-love.
It's a popular topic, but can
we get in the habit of really
taking these tiny 
moments to feel it?
Yes.
Use your top 
arm to press you up.
Then, bottom arm 
will come all the way up.
You're my hero.
Thank you for being here, Day 6.
If you can get through Day 6
you can do this whole journey.
Okay? I promise.
If you fall, we'll catch you.
Please share your experience.
Please share this video with
people who you think might
benefit from it.
And I look forward to 
seeing you tomorrow for Day 7.
Draw the palms together.
Thumbs up to the third eye.
Let's take one final breath in.
Here we go, big inhale.
And exhale to bow.
Thanks, everyone.
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
