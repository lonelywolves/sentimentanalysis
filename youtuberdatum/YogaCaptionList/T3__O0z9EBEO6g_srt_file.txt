- Howdy everyone.
Welcome to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 13, Feel.
Let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Alrighty my darling friend,
come on down to the ground.
Sit up on your
blanket or your block,
your towel if you have one.
Find a gentle lift in the heart.
Allow your hands to rest gently
wherever feels
comfortable today.
Close your eyes
and drop the shoulders
as you start to tune in to
the quality of 
your breath today.
Notice how you feel.
No judgment.
No worries.
Whatever level of energy
you're bringing to
the practice today.
What matters most
is you showed up.
You've arrived here and in
fact the hardest part is over
so now we just
get to feel our way
through this thing together.
Deepening our practice
by focusing on 
the way things feel.
So I love,
just kind of connecting a
little bit of the meditation
from yesterday to
this practice today,
I love the idea of showing 
up with no expectation
and really forgetting 
in a lot of ways
what you think
you know about yoga,
these preconceived notions,
so that you can
begin to drop the doing
and the kind of mastering a bit,
even if it's just a little bit 
and snuggle up or lean in.
Focus more, even if
it's just as an experiment,
on how things feel
for you, for your body,
for your energy state today,
for where you're at
on your soul's journey.
When we start to
experiment like this
within the four
corners of our mat or
within the time we have allotted
and carved out for
ourselves to practice,
we might be getting closer to
feeling more like ourselves
and less like we're trying to
adhere to someone else's idea
of who we are or who
we're supposed to be.
Simply put, feel your
way through your practice.
Find what feels good today.
Be honest with yourself
and boy, you will have
very rich yoga practice,
a very rich practice of
not just physical asana
but of soulful breath,
contemplation, love.
I'm feelin' it.
Alright, draw the
hands together at the heart.
Let's take a breath in together.
Inhale in deeply.
And exhale to relax the
shoulders a little more perhaps.
Exhale completely.
Beautiful, then you can
open your eyes, lift the chin.
We're gonna take the
left hand to the right knee,
right fingertips behind and
start with a gentle twist here.
As you inhale,
lift and lengthen.
As you exhale, 
draw the navel in and up
and start to
twist a little more.
But we're not pushing,
we're not forcing,
we're not trying to hit a mark.
We're really feeling
our way through the twist.
So the name of the game
here is really inhale to lift
and lengthen to create space
and exhale to feel
your way into the twist.
And there's a lot
you can grow there.
And many people are like,
"Okay, well, 
bring on the Chaturangas.
"Bring on the
"one arm balancing posture."
Well, those are fun
but if you can't feel
your way through a twist,
in my opinion,
I don't know if you should 
be spending a lot of time
on an arm balance.
Booyah, just said it.
Okay, here we go. (chuckles)
Back to center and
take it to the other side.
Inhaling to lift and lengthen
and then feel your
way through this twist.
All jokes aside,
this is a great way,
feeling your way
through practice.
While it's important to
know action in alignment
to stay safe and 
have the structures
to play in and grow in.
Really coming back to the health
and the wealth of 
the spine is worth it.
So whether you
agree with me or not,
this is good for your spine.
Gonna get you ready
for those one arm balance.
How about that?
And you will do
some arm balances
in this series, in this journey.
So I got you all covered.
Inhale to lift the
heart one more time.
Exhale to feel your
way through the twist.
Lovely, come back to center.
Left hand to the earth,
right hand reaches up and over.
Side body stretch.
Now, check it out.
Navel is gonna come back
as if you were
going into a Cat Pose.
You're gonna sweep
your right fingertips
through center in front of you.
Left fingertips follow, 
it's like a dance.
And then right hand
comes to the ground
and left fingertips up and over,
side body stretch.
You can feel it out here.
Find a little gentle movement,
maybe some pulsing.
And then the same thing, 
back the other way.
Navel draws in so we're
really feeling that low back
stretch as we draw the navel in
and we come through
sweeping the fingertips
in front of the legs
and all the way back up.
Right hand extending,
left hand on the earth.
Careful not to be
too far out here.
I invite you to bring that
elbow in, see what happens.
Yes, and then through 
center one more time.
Over to the right.
And then let your left
hand lift you all the way up
and back to center.
Gorgeous, let's come
forward onto all fours.
Drop the belly for
an inhale, Cow Pose.
Press into the tops of the feet,
spread the fingertips wide.
Exhale round through
the spine, chin to chest.
Now follow your
breath and feel your way
through this spinal flexion.
You can find soft,
easy movement here.
You can stretch 
areas of the body,
your body, 
that might feel sore
from this past week.
You can turn the fingertips in,
take gentle circles.
You might curl the toes
under and send the hips back
for a nice stretch of the feet,
the soles of the feet.
Maybe you're feeling a
little emotional today,
you can take a
little Child's Pose
or maybe a little
smile or wipe a tear.
So just take a
couple seconds here to
veer off the railroad tracks.
And you know, you always
have the structure of Cat-Cow
to resign with the breath in.
So feel it out.
You know what?
Maybe you come all
the way to the belly.
And if this is
difficult for you,
it's a lot easier
to be told what to do.
I totally understand 
in this scenario.
So it's difficult for you.
Know you're not alone.
But just don't
decide where it ends.
That's my advice or that's
my invitation rather to you.
Don't decide where it ends.
But it's this little dance 
that you're improvising
that you're
choreographing here now
that's gonna take you
to Downward Facing Dog.
So you're going
to feel your way.
You're not gonna
just take my cue,
but you're gonna feel you way
eventually all the way up
to that Downward Dog.
And when you get there,
notice if you just kind of
stop in the shape of the pose,
like, "Whew, we made it
through that goofy warmup,
but now I'm here," 
keep it going.
Feel it out.
You've been
showing up, working hard.
So notice the sensation.
Feel it out in your body.
Different parts,
uniting as one whole part.
(sighs) The body's amazing.
We're taking care of it.
Learning or relearning to
love our bodies. Take good care.
Alright, keep it going all
the way up to the top-tippy-top
of the mat, Forward Fold.
Same thing.
Yep, you guessed it.
When you get there,
no static holds here
unless you're really craving it.
Find what feels good.
Feel it out, shake the head.
Listen and respond mindfully
with conscious breath.
Alright, now listen carefully.
From here, we're actually
gonna plant the palms,
step the right foot back,
step the left foot
back to Plank pose.
Beautiful, then drop the knees.
Squeeze the elbows
into the side body
and slowly lower
down to the belly.
Good, drag the hands in
line with the rib cage.
Inhale, tuck the chin,
roll up to Cobra this way,
unraveling the neck
and then exhale,
forehead releases down.
Again, tuck the chin.
Slowly rise up.
And exhale, release.
One more time.
Chin tucks first.
Then it unravels
and then we cascade all
the way down, beautiful.
From here, 
pressing up to all fours.
Knees nice and wide.
Big toes to touch.
Left hand is gonna come
to the center of the mat.
And we're gonna take the right
fingertips to the left wrist,
press into the tops of the feet,
and as if you were
pulling back a bow and arrow,
you're gonna press
away from the yoga mat.
So actually peek
at me, everyone.
So right here, I'm kinda
collapsed into the shoulder.
When I say "press
away from the yoga mat,"
I mean press down in the earth
create space in the joint here
by lifting the rest of
the body up and out, right?
So here I am collapsed
and here I am pressing
up and out of the earth.
Give it a try.
Okay, reset.
Right fingertips to the
left wrist, here we go.
I'm gonna draw a line
all the way up the left arm.
All the way up past
that left shoulder.
All the way across the chest,
past the right shoulder
and then up towards the sky.
Whoo! Lean back, 
press into the tops of the feet.
Inhale in here, breathe into
all four sides of the torso.
Feel that breath, stretch
the back, let it get long, maybe.
And then exhale
through out the needle.
Right fingertips
in and underneath
the bridge of the left arm.
We're gonna come to
rest on your right ear here.
Left hand presses into the
earth with the left elbow up
so you can get 
a nice big stretch.
Or maybe right fingers,
excuse me, left fingertips,
reach all the way up
towards the front
edge of your mat.
Find what feels good here.
Soften your gaze and breathe
into all four
sides of the torso.
So nice little lateral breath.
Remembering how we
dropped the breath yesterday?
See if you can find
that here in this shape.
So good for the upper back body.
If you ever feel any
fussiness in the neck,
the shoulders, the traps,
this is your jam.
Breathe deep.
And then slowly release.
Follow your breath.
Bring the right
hand down to the ground.
Right into the second side.
Left fingertips 
come to the left wrist.
We push away
from the earth first.
So create length.
And then slowly left fingertips
trace across the
chest all the way up.
We're pressing into
the tops of the feet,
opening up through the chest.
And if I have to say,
if your arm isn't
coming up here like mine,
if it's coming here,
I know what that feels like.
So in time we'll be
able to open, open, open.
Alright, beautiful twist 
here in the whole spine.
Pressing into the 
tops of the feet, inhale in.
Open up through 
the chest, the pec.
And then exhale, 
thread thy needle.
It was creepy.
Come onto the 
left shoulder, left ear.
And I'm really
coming to the outer edge
of that left shoulder.
If this is a new shape for you
it might take
some deep breathing
and little
patience to get there.
Use the right
hand to stabilize you.
Either with the elbow bent
or straight and reaching out.
So many of us have
been in the shape a lot.
Bring your breath
as my mom would say,
like nobody's business.
So see if you can
really breathe wide and down,
getting into the low lung area.
That'll change your life.
Okay, then slowly
follow your breath.
Whatever that means to you,
all the way back to all fours.
Good, reset by bringing
the knees underneath the hips,
curl the toes under.
So that action of
pressing away from the earth
that we just did,
we're gonna put
it into play here
again like nobody's business.
Love you, Mom.
Okay, here we go.
Lifting the knees, 
Hovering Table.
So if I'm collapsed in the
shoulders here, I'm in trouble.
So we're gonna press
away from the yoga mat.
Elbows are straight, not locked.
I lift the knees.
Neck is nice and long.
I'm creating a table
with a little challenge
of lifting the knees.
So draw the low
belly in towards center.
So we're creating a
little zipper effect,
that containment in the
center building core strength
one breath cycle at a time.
You're amazing.
If you want, 
you can lift the right heel
for three, two, one.
Lower it down.
Lift the left heel
for three, two, one.
Stay here pressing into
both palms evenly.
Inhale in.
Press away from
the yoga mat even more.
And then exhale to
lower the knees, beautiful.
If you need to send the hips 
back, that's not if you need to,
let's all send the hips back
for a little wrist rotation here.
Big or small.
Maybe shake it out.
Maybe say 
a little prayer. (laughs)
Okie-doke, then we'll
take it all the way forward.
Curl the toes under, 
send the hips up high and back.
Good.
Bend the knees, carve a line
with the nose to look forward.
Inhale in.
Exhale, make your 
way to the top.
Standing Forward Fold.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale to soften
and fold it down.
Beautiful.
Fingertips come to the mat.
We're gonna walk the feet
as wide as a yoga mat here,
toes still off just a bit.
Let's see what 
it's like today, inhale in.
Exhale, drop your center.
Feel it out, press into
all four corners of the feet.
If the heels wanna come up,
go ahead and let them.
And we'll use a fingertips
as a little bit of extra stability,
extra support here.
So there's no need to rush
bringing the palms together.
But you can play sometimes even
bringing one hand, one thumb
to the heart is a
great place to be.
And then in time you
can bring both hands.
So heels are lifted or grounded
and we're playing
with this lift of energy
through the front body.
And this grounding
through the back body.
And that's what I really
want you to try to feel today
is if I'm collapsing forward,
all my energy is going down.
Can I feel that
lift through the front
and notice how
that can support me
in any variation
of this posture?
And can I feel or
visualize that anchoring,
that grounding through the
back and how does that change
the way I exist in my
variation of this posture?
So we're not hanging
on a wing and a prayer.
We're paying
attention to sensation.
We're activating not
just with smart alignment,
but energy too.
Engaging with the 
energy of a posture.
Okay, whatever variation
that you're in right now
take the deepest
breath you've taken all day.
Feel it travel down.
Feel it travel up.
Beautiful.
Then bring your
awareness to your feet.
Keep awareness in the feet.
As you keep the knees wide,
bring the fingertips,
walk them around behind you.
Keep the feet nice and active
as you slowly
lower to the ground.
If you crash a
little bit, smile.
One of the things 
I love about yoga too,
if you can kind
of position yourself
in a loving way is all
the wonderful opportunity
opportunities to
practice humility, you know?
Instead of feeling bad or shame,
you're like, "I can't float,"
how about, "Oh, thank you.
Thank you, angels.
"Thank you for
giving me this chance
"to know what humility feels
like and to be good at that too."
So if you crashed on your butt,
it's a win in my book.
Okay, come on to a seat,
knees up here.
Lift up through the front body,
lift the shoulders 
up to the ears
then take them
back around and down.
We're prepping for
a little Boat play
and Benji's
gonna go to Shavasana
but we're going to
do a little Navasana
because I want you to,
you have your
action and alignment.
See if you can feel this
lift up through the front body,
feel this grounding through
the back body as you lean back.
So give your thinking 
mind a break, right?
Yesterday we talked
about dropping expectations.
So we're gonna keep active
and we're gonna be
smart listening to our bodies
but we're really gonna see
if feeling this
upward current of energy,
this lift up
from the pelvic floor
can help us feel a little
more supported in this posture.
So just play,
maybe the toes hover here.
You can hold on to
your legs for dear life.
There's no cheating
in my book in yoga.
You're here, that's A+.
YWA-plus.
Shins maybe lift
parallel to the sky.
Hands, maybe reach forward.
So I'm not
collapsing the front body
because I'm lifting up,
feeling that
upward current of energy.
I'm grounding down
through the shoulder blades
feeling them really ground
down through the back body.
Inhale in.
Exhale, I might straighten legs.
Lifting through the front body,
grounding through the back body.
Good, then take a break.
Come to one of my
favorite yoga poses.
You grab opposite
hand with opposite wrists.
Elbows rest on the knees
and we hang the head here.
Oh, feels so good.
Take a nice breath.
And then let's reset.
Bring the hands behind the legs.
Loop the shoulders.
Feel that upward
current through the front body,
downward through the back.
Lift the shins maybe, toes
can stay on the ground too.
Inhale in.
Maybe, exhale, 
reach forward, maybe not.
Inhale in again.
Maybe, exhale, extend the legs.
Maybe open the arms wide.
Breathe.
Lift the chest to the sky, 
lift the chin to the sky.
And then take a break.
Come to my favorite place
to call home.
Close your eyes, drop your chin.
Inhale in deeply.
And exhale completely.
Alright, one more time.
Here we go.
Find your way there.
Find your breath.
Feel the lift through the front,
the grounding through the back.
Inhale in. 
Exhale, straighten the legs.
Straighten the arms.
You're here.
For one second even,
you're here,
lifting the heart,
lifting the chest.
We're here for ten, nine, eight.
You got it. Draw the
shoulder blades together.
Six, five, four.
Three, two and on 
the one we return.
We relax the head over
maybe clasp the
opposite wrist this time.
The one that feels kind of funky
and drop your head down
low and feel your breath.
As you breathe
down into your belly,
feel it at the side bodies,
feel it in the low back.
Notice what it feels
like to be alive today here.
You might just smile
or laugh a little here.
If you need to cry,
just let it out.
I'll invite everyone to
take one more deep breath in
and sigh it out here.
Let's do one more just in
case you missed that wave.
Seriously, don't think.
Here we go. Inhale.
And sigh out with 
a little sound here.
Good, now seal the lips.
Breathe through your nose,
tuck the chin.
And let's roll up to a
little meditation pose here.
Or if you wanna come flat
on your back, now's the time.
My darling, now's the time.
So we're back to one,
back to where we started
or maybe you're lying
down on the ground right now.
Getting geared up
for burrito pose.
Wherever you are,
let's take a moment 
here to find stillness.
To relax.
Notice how you feel in mind.
And in body.
And in heart.
Let your breath simply return.
Nice, easy, natural rhythm,
natural flow.
Soften the skin of the face.
Soften through your jaw.
If the eyes are not closed,
go ahead and close them
just for a quiet moment
here of stillness,
of being.
May this practice inspire you
to feel your way
through the rest of your day.
When I move like
this off the mat,
I notice I just naturally
welcome more contemplation
into my daily life.
So not just on the mat or
focused in a moment of prayer,
but I find beauty 
in the little things,
the mundane,
when I'm really present 
kind of feeling my way
through the day.
Draw the hands together.
Thank you for sharing
your practice with me
and with Benji and with all
the beautiful people and pets
that are practicing
together around the world here.
Take one more final inhale in.
Lots of love inward
so that we can share, exhale,
lots of love outward.
Thanks everyone.
Namaste.
(bright upbeat piano music)
