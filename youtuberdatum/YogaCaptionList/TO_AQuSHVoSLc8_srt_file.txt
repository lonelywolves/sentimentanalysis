- Hello, my darling friends,
welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I am Adriene, 
and this is sweet Benji,
and today we have a 
yoga for transitions.
So hop into something comfy,
and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Hi, pals.
Let's begin today's practice
in a nice comfortable seat.
Come on down to the ground,
take your time getting there,
start to breathe in now, 
deeper,
more full breaths.
And when you land in 
your comfortable seat,
let's bring the palms together,
(clearing throat)
at the heart.
Gently close your 
eyes or soften your gaze,
and tuck the 
chin to bow the head
just slightly to the hands.
Wherever this 
practice finds you today,
let it meet you and greet 
you with a sense of wonder,
the excitement of the unknown,
but also let it meet 
you and greet you with love,
pure love, 100%.
Acceptance for who you are,
and where you are today.
Not who you were or 
where you were yesterday.
And no worries about tomorrow.
May today's quick 
practice be a reminder
of just how powerful 
it can be to reside
in the present 
moment with the breath.
To keep that sense of wonder
and trust in the process,
and of course, move 
and see with eyes of love.
Alright, take 
a deep breath in.
Exhale all the way 
out, empty, empty, empty.
Lift your gaze, your chin,
can open your eyes here,
and the palms are gonna 
come gently to the knees.
On an inhale, lift 
your heart towards the sky.
On an exhale, 
round the spine, chin to chest.
On an inhale, lift your 
heart up towards the sky.
Exhale, chin to chest,
navel draws back.
Inhale, lift, last one.
Elbows draw down actively.
Exhale, rounding 
through chin to chest,
pause here, really catch your
knees here with your palms.
Lean back, way back.
And then calm, all the 
way up and through the center.
We're gonna come all 
the way to all fours here.
Wrists underneath the shoulders,
knees directly 
underneath the hips.
On your next inhale, 
kick the right leg out,
so take your time 
getting there, no need to rush,
but when you're ready, 
kick your right leg out,
and we're gonna dial the right
toes down towards the ground,
leveling the hips here,
best you can, and then just
lifting from the right 
inner thigh so strong leg.
Whole body 
begins to turn on here,
we send the left 
fingertips forward,
thumb face up as if 
you're shaking someone's hand.
Take a deep breath 
in here, expand.
Exhale, contract, navel draws
up, everything rounds in.
Inhale, extend.

This time, left hand 
comes to the right shin,

press up out of your foundation
that which is 
touching the ground, hold,
and then release everything,
awesome.
Switch to the other side,
welcome that heat, here we go.
As you're ready, big breath in.
What's up creaky, old floor?
Left toes dialed down,
we level the hips,
just check out 
what's going on here.
Nice wide base in the hands,
spreading the fingers evenly,
index fingers forward.
Lift your left inner 
thigh up towards the sky,

Doming through 
the upper back body.
Good, and then slowly release,

Bring the big toes to touch,
knees as wide as your yoga mat.
Beautiful, drop your elbows
down where the hands were,
bring the palms together.
Check it out, 
send the hips back,
send your thumbs 
over towards your head,
you should get a big 
stretch in the triceps here,
the shoulders, heart melts down,
forehead towards the earth.
Let your hips get really 
heavy here as you pull back,
press into the tops of the
feet, breathe, breathe, breathe.
Choose to give the 
thinking mind a break here
and reside in the breath,
best you can.
From center, 
hug the low ribs in,
engage the abdominal wall,
begin to release the hands
and come all the way back up.
Walk the knees 
underneath the hip points,
curl the toes under,
send it up and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
On your next inhale, 
lift the right leg up high.
Exhale, step it all the way
forward into a nice low lunge,
lower the back knee.
Make sure your front 
knee is over the front ankle.
For a little more stretch,
walk that left knee back.
Awesome, swing your right
hand around to meet your left,
we're gonna walk 
the hands off the mat,
imagine your hands 
were in Downward Dog here,
you're gonna keep pulling 
your right hip crease back,
bow the head over,
breathe deep here.
Strong breaths, strong 
foundation, you've got this.
Then slowly walk it back,
hands are gonna stay on 
the left side of the mat here
for a little Lizard variation.
You're gonna walk 
your right foot out,
right toes turned towards 
the right edge of your mat,
and just keep it nice and low
here for now, breathing deep.
Slowly walk the 
right foot back to center,
bring your right hand around
to frame your right foot,
we're gonna pull the 
right hip crease back,
keep the left hip 
stacked over the left knee
for a runner's stretch, 
inhale to look forward,
flex your right 
toes towards your face.
Exhale, bow, 
forehead towards the knee.
Rolling through the right foot,
Crescent Lunge, inhale, sweep
the arms up and over head,
big stretch, big breath,
squeeze your inner thighs
to the midline, 
lift up from the pelvic floor,
and then exhale 
all the way back down.
Curl the back toes under,
lift the back knees,
step it back, Plank Pose.
Inhale in here, you've got this.
Exhale, breathing out, out, out,
empty, empty, empty.
Inhale in again.
Exhale, empty out.
Good, tap into 
that powerful breath.
One more time, inhale in.
Exhale, 
Downward Facing Dog, nice work.
On your next breath in, inhale,

Exhale, step it 
all the way forward,

Check your foundation,

Then bring the left hand around,
I'm gonna walk my hands all
the way out to Benji here,
aww, reaching out.
Melting your heart down.
Keep the front knee 
over the front ankle,
pull your left 
hip crease back, breathe.
And then slowly 
walking it back up,

the right side of the mat

inch the left toes,
left foot out towards 
the outer edge of your mat.
Again, keep the knee on the
ground here, breathe deep.
Walk the left 
foot back to center.
Frame your left 
foot with your hands,
and when you're ready, 
peel the left hip crease back.
Flex the left 
toes towards your face.
Big breaths here, 
inhale to look forward,
find extension, exhale, 
forehead toward the knee.
So how you move matters,
we say it here on 
the channel all the time,
paying attention to, 
not only what you're doing,
but how you're doing it,
the way in which you 
move in and out of things.
So pay attention as you roll
through your left foot here,
pay attention to the 
transitions, they're valuable.
Sweep the arms up and overhead,
squeeze the inner 
thighs to the midline,
press into all four 
corners of your front foot.
Inhale in, lift the heart.
Exhale to rain it down.
Curl the back toes under,

Option to lower the knees here
Half Plank, just an option.
Everyone, look forward, 
breathe, breathe, breathe,
here we go, half push up,
elbows stay close to the side
body here, just go halfway,
big exhale to press up.
Look forward, inhale half way.
Big exhale to press up, 
last one, only three, inhale.
Exhale, squeeze the
elbows into the side body,
exhale to press up, 
release the toes to the ground
if they are not already, 
send it up high and back,
Downward Dog, hips to the sky.
Beautiful.
So bend your 
knees and really let
your hip creases lift you up,
see if you can get a little more
rotation in the pelvis there,
and then you can let 
the heels get heavy again.
Awesome work.
Inhale, lift the 
right leg up high.
Exhale, step it 
all the way forward.
This time, option to 
keep the back knee lifted,
just an option, as you 
bring the right hand around,
left hand out, 
working off the mat here
towards the left side,
bow the head.
Think of the hands being 
in Downward Facing Dog here.
Again, option to lower the
back knee or keep it lifted,
if it's lifted though, 
really reach your left heel
towards the back edge.
Good, take one more 
breath here, inhale.
Exhale, walk it to Lizard,
back knee lifted,
always an option, 
walk your right toes
towards the 
outer edge of your mat.
Inhale to look forward,
this time, maybe exhale come
to the forearms, maybe, maybe.
Call me maybe, and 
then slowly back up,
bring your right foot in,

On your next breath in, 
lift the left leg up high,
we got this.
Exhale, 
shift forward, step it up.
Back knee lifted this time,
here we go,
walking the left hand around,
you can always lower it if
that's not right in your body.
Planting the palms, sending
them out towards the right,
bowing the head, 
strong legs here.
Really reach 
your right heel back.
Keep pressing into 
your right pinky toe,
just like we did on all fours,
lift up from your 
right inner thigh.
Good, take one more 
breath here, you got it.
Exhale, slowly walk 
the hands back and in,
Lizard variation, 
take the left toes out.
Option to stay 
here nice and lifted,
you can lower the knee, or
maybe we come to forearms here.
Breathe, relax your jaw, 
soften the skin of the face,
give your thinking mind a break,
connect to your intuitive self,
connect to your bodily
intelligence here, you got this.
Inhale in, exhale.
Inhale to bring it back up.
We'll frame the foot 
again with the hands,
lower the back knee, ahh,
and send the 
left hip crease back.
Flex your left 
toes towards your face,
so active in the foot here.
Good, inhale in.
Exhale to roll through,
sweep the arms up and overhead,

big breath, big stretch.
Exhale to rain it down,
awesome work.
Plant the palms, step it back,

Exhale, Chaturanga to Upward
Facing Dog, or belly to Cobra.
Inhale in.
Exhale to Plank.
Inhale in again, you got this.
Exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
Deep breath in.
Long breath out.
Slowly bend the knees, let
them kiss the ground with care.
Walk the knees together,
the feet together,
and send your 
hips back, Balasana.
So you can keep the 
fingers reaching forward,
or paint your yoga mat,
send the fingertips towards 
the back edge, and relax.
Close your eyes.
And take a second here 
to just observe everything,
where the thoughts go, how is
the quality of your breath.
Can you feel your heart?
Feel the warmth in 
your forehead, your neck.
Sometimes things 
get uncomfortable
before they transition.
Before a blossoming,
before a change.
Can we remember 
to trust the process,
to trust the struggle?
And remember the 
tools of our practice
are here to 
support us in just that.
Inhale. 
Exhale.
Inhale to rise back up,
fingertips come forward,
and we're gonna walk the 
knees as wide as the hips,
once again, curl the toes under.
Listen carefully, 
send the hips back,
you're gonna come into a 
little yogi, yogic squat.
Heels can stay lifted here,
otherwise let's see what happens
if we work to get 
the heels on the ground.
If it doesn't happen,
it's all good.
Palms come together
or fingertips can 
stay on the ground.
We're pressing into all 
four corners of the feet
if the heels are on the ground,
if not, press into 
every single toe.
We're here or here.
And if you are comfortable
in this Malasana variation,
then I'm gonna invite you
to really create 
a little resistance,
press your arms 
actively into your legs,
and squeeze your legs 
actively into your arms.
Now, find a soft 
focus down in front,
or close your eyes, feel your
breath as you breathe in,
nice lateral breath into 
all four sides of the torso.
Tuck your chin, 
lengthen through the neck.
Inhale, lift the 
sternum to the thumbs.
Exhale to release.
Walk the toes together, 
knees together.
You got this.
Walk the hands to one side,
let's all go to the right,
walk the hands 
to your right side.
Press in to both palms evenly.
Squeeze your elbows in,
just like you did 
in that half push up,
draw the hands 
close to your body.
Send your gaze 
out and keep it out
as you inhale in, exhale, 
draw your navel in and up,
maybe lift the hips,
maybe come forward,
creating a little shelf 
for your hips and your legs.
Then come back. 
Inhale in.
Exhale, find that contraction,
that center,
maybe lift off here,
coming into a 
little side Crow variation.
If there's another arm 
balance in your practice,
maybe you take it, let's 
do one more, try inhale in.
Exhale, nice and easy.
So there are 
different variations of this,
one, you're just 
balancing on one arm.
A nice beginner 
balance is to take it
on the shelf of both arms,
then you can grow from there.
Shake it out, come 
back to center, all good.
And then take it 
to the other side.
So you wanna 
spread the palms evenly,
drag them close to your body,
find that lift up 
through the pelvic floor
and keep your gaze out.
Inhale in, exhale,
find contraction,
lift, maybe you shift over.
Start by just 
rocking back and forth,
no need to get the 
feet up off the ground.
So the inner body, 
the muscles have to all
be lifted and 
engaged here for takeoff,
we don't wanna collapse all
the weight onto our wrists,
so just do it a couple of times,
playing on the other side.
And if none of 
this is suiting you,
let's do a little 
yoga for the feet,
lifting up from 
the pelvic floor here,
and a nice little squat,
heels lifted.
Then, wherever you are,
everyone come back to center,
let's shake it off.
Let's slowly come to a seat,
extend the legs 
out long in front.
Inhale in, sweeping the arms
up and overhead with energy.
Exhale, bend your knees 
and reach for your toes.
Straighten the legs out as
it feels right in your body,
take an inhale in.
And as you exhale,
just find a little bit 
of gratitude for your body,
for this life, 
for everything that we have
and that we share.
And then, take a 
moment just for you,
all the unique qualities 
that you bring to the table,
honor them, trust them, 
and let them guide the way.
Alright, as you 
transition to your back,
get comfy, 
feel your back supported,
and know that this 
video is actually coming out
at the end of a year,
just about the beginning 
of a brand new year,
and I know that 
we'll be practicing this
whenever we 
need a little support
during a time of 
change or transition,
but for those 
practicing around the time
that this video's coming out,
just think about all the things
that you're grateful for,
and we'll end by 
setting a little intention
for what's to come.
So bring your feet 
as wide as the yoga mat,
come into a little 
constructive resting posture
with the knees together.
If you're warm, 
you can come to cactus arms,
otherwise just let the hands
rest gently on the belly.
Inhale in.
Exhale, relax everything.
Close your eyes and 
just a little invitation here
as we close the practice 
to finish this sentence,
"I choose..."
Finish this sentence, 
just see what comes up,
"I choose..."
And it can simply be to,
"I choose to be the 
best version of myself."
Slowly part the knees,
walk the feet in,
hug the knees up to your chest,
give yourself a big embrace,
"I choose..."
Gently rock side to side,
find what feels good.
Then, cross one 
ankle over the other,
grab the outer edges 
of the feet or the toes,
and rock all the 
way up to a seat.
It's an honor to share 
this practice with you.
This community, 
whether you're an active member
of the Yoga With 
Adriene community,
or the Find What Feels 
Good community, same thing,
or you're new, 
you're always welcome here.
This yoga is so cool 
because it reminds me constantly
that we are more 
alike than we are different,
and we can learn to honor and
celebrate our differences.
More.
Palms coming together,
thumbs to third eye,
we take care of 
ourselves so we can
take care of each other,
the planet.
We take time to be 
present so we can honor
the next present moment,
and onto the next,
and onto the next.
I love you guys so much,
we'll take a deep breath in,
one final breath together,
and we'll exhale to bow.
Happy trails to you, Namaste.
