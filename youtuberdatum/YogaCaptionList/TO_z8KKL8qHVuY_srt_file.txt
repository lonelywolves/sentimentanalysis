- Hi everyone and
welcome to Dedicate,
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 7.
You're doing awesome.
Welcome back.
Today we're going to
focus on surya or the sun.
Hop to something
comfy and let's get started.
(bright music)
Okey doke, my darling friends.
Let's begin today's practice
standing at the top of the mat.
Go ahead and begin with
your feet hip width apart,
toes pointing forward and right
away we're going to inhale reach
the fingertips all
the way up to the sky.
And then exhale
just release them down
with a nice big exhale.
And again, big
inhale to reach for the sky.
Just kind of
landing in the moment here.
Exhale, release the fingertips
down as you breathe out.
One more time,
big inhale, reach
 and exhale letting go.
Come into your quiet Mountain
and let's begin to tune
in for today's practice.
Soften your gaze or
trust me, trust yourself,
trust the video
and close your eyes.
Find a little soft
bend in the knees
as you gently lift your heart.
And begin to bring your
attention to your breath.
Thank you for showing up today.
For choosing to dedicate
some conscious time
and conscious breath 
to you.
For when we take
time for self care,
when we take time to look inside
and notice how we're feeling,
when we take time to practice
on the mat then we find that
whatever discoveries we make,
whatever things we pick up or
learn on the mat they
translate to life off the mat.
As you're ready, begin to
take your thumb and move your
thumbprint across
your other fingers.
Or option just
wiggle the fingers here.
Feeling it out.
Noticing the sensation.
Instead of putting
on a hard shell for a
surya namaskar today we're going
to go at it with a gentle ease.
You will sweat
but taking a moment
here to feel it out.
Sensitize.
Good, then when
you're ready, inhale,
draw the hands
together at the heart.
Take a deep breath in.
Lift your chest to your thumbs
and as you exhale bow the head
to the heart here.
Feel that broadening
in the upper back body.
That stretch in
the back of the neck.
And today I'd like to invite you
to set a little intention
for today's practice.
Something positive that will
serve you in the present moment.
Perhaps helping you
to move with more ease.
Or to open your mind
or your heart space
to find clarity or insight.
This idea that
through our practice
we can perceive
things more clearly.
Just by simply taking the time.
Cool.
If you've landed
on an intention here,
go ahead and repeat
it quietly to yourself.
Confirming it.
Considering it
already done, right?
Imagine it already so.
Okey doke, then we'll release
the fingertips to the ground.
You can flutter the eyelashes
open and let's have some fun.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale, bend your knees
generously Forward Fold
all the way down.
Inhale, halfway lift,
your version.
Just checking in and then
exhale to soften and fold.
Great, from here you're gonna
bring the fingertips
to the earth.
You're gonna step
just the right foot back,
lower the right knee.
Then we'll loop the shoulders.
Inhale, lift the fingertips up.
Open the chest, your heart up
towards the sun or the sky.
Beautiful then slowly release.
We'll bring the
back knee up here.
Nice low lunge and then with
this connection to your core,
your center you're gonna bring
the back foot all the way up.
Back to the Forward Fold.
Awesome, inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale, fold.
Root to rise here.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale, hands to heart.
Beautiful, again soft knees,
fingertips go down to come up.
Inhale, reach to the sun.
Exhale, bend the knees.
Let something go, Forward Fold.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Find length in the neck.
Exhale to soften and bow.
Fingertips kiss the earth
and we kick the left
foot back with control.
Slowly lower the left knee to
the earth and with a big inhale,
reach for the sun.
All the way up.
Heart lifts all the way up.
Big breath here.
Exhale to soften and release.
Lift the back knee,
connect to your center,
your core as you find a little
rock and when you're ready
back foot all the way up.
Forward Fold at
the top of the mat.
Go ahead and let
your head go here.
You can clasp opposite elbow
for a couple breaths here.
Find what feels good.
And when you're
ready release the arms.
Inhale, halfway lift,
your version.
Find length.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Root to rise here.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale hands to heart.
Beautiful.
Now we're gonna
release the fingertips,
swim them around to
interlace behind your tailbone,
behind your back.
Knuckles draw down
and away here as you begin
to open up through the chest.
And if this is new for you,
you're gonna feel quite an
opening here so
breathe deep and be kind.
You don't need to
muscle too much here.
Just feel it out.
And if you feel pretty good here
you can start to dig into the
heels, lift up from the pelvic
floor and really send your heart
up towards the sun or the sky.
In time palms can come together
but it's okay to keep the
wrists nice and square.
Take one more deep breath in.
Exhale, draw your navel in as
you softly bend your knees.
Dive forward with control.
Knuckles reach up
towards the sky
and then over past your head.
(chuckles)
The front of your mat.
Breathe.
So I'm active in the arms here.
My knuckles are
reaching up towards the sky.
I'm breathing into my belly.
I'm rooted firmly
through my feet.
Then resist the slingshot effect
here as a friend of mine says so
watch or be
mindful of this release.
Watch it as you slowly
try to release with control.
Release the chains.
Anything that's
been holding you back.
Here we go, inhale,
halfway lift.
Exhale, fold.
Beautiful. From here
fingertips come to the mat,

Observe your breath.
Feel it out.
When we take time
to observe the breath,
keep spiraling back to
the sound of the breath,
we are taking time to listen and
nurture the wisdom of the heart,
right, versus the brain.
Killing it.
