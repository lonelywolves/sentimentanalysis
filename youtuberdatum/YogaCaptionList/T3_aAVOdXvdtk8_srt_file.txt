- What's up everyone,
welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene, 
this is Benji, and it's Day 6.
(mimics fireworks)
Burn.
Do not be afraid. (chuckles)
Let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Okey-doke, we're going
to begin today's practice
with the pranayama,
with a breath technique
called Breath of Fire.
So, watch out, (laughs)
just kidding.
We're gonna sit up on a
little blanket or block,
or a towel if you have it.
If not, no worries.
Let's all come in to a seat.
Lengthen up through the spine.
And draw one hand to the belly,
place the other 
one right on top.
Just take a moment if you can,
I can even feel myself 
moving around a lot.
Just my energy here today.
Just try to come into a
place of stillness to begin.
And I'll let you to close
the eyes to see if that helps.
Relax the shoulders 
and just land
with a deep breath in,
and a long, long breath out.
And you might feel a bit tired.
If that's the case for you
and you have no
problem being still right now,
then I have your back with
the next breath technique.
We'll bring some
energy to the body.
And if you're feeling like
it's hard to be still right now,
you know what to do, anchor
in the sound of your breath.
Slow down your inhale.
Slow down your exhale.
Maybe we all find a
slight gentle reverent bow,
just tucking the chin a little.
Going inward.
Let's have a
moment of gratitude here
just for yourself
for showing up for yourself.
For when we take
the time to condition,
and to practice
sustaining the 
effort of being curious
about our own
selves on our own paths,
and that helps inform our
relationships with others
and the way we 
move and walk through
the world.
Take one more moment here.
Inhale.
And then exhale,
lift the chin,
gently open the eyes, and then
we will begin Breath of Fire.
So a quick tutorial.
Inhale, breathe into your hands.
Feel the breath expand.
We've already been here,
we've set up the
foundations of this,
and then exhale,
draw the navel in.
Squeeze it in, in, in.
So there's an expansion 
as you breathe in, give it a try.
And then a contraction, as
you breathe out, give it a try.
And we're just
gonna speed that up.
So we inhale, belly expands,
we've talked about
that directional breath
going down, it expands.
And on the exhale,
it's a sharp quick inhale in,
or excuse me, exhale
in with the contraction.
So inhale. expansion.
Exhale, contraction.
Inhale, expansion.
This is just practice.
It's all practice,
and then exhale, draw it in.
Now we're gonna speed that up.
Inhale.
Exhale.
(repeated breathing)
Great, then let it go.
So that is our
Kapalabhati Breath, some layers.
The inhale becomes passive
once you find your rhythm,
and you focus on
that short, sharp exhale,
that contraction
drawing the navel.
Think about the image of drawing
the navel back in
towards the spine.
So there's a string
that expands out on inhale
and then it gets
pulled back in on the exhale.
Another layer is once
you feel like you don't need
to look at me or once we begin,
send your gaze down
gently past your nose.
Soft gaze, just bringing 
your concentration,
your focus inward on the breath.
You might start to
get off the rhythm,
you might fall off path, right?
What's new?
That's life, all good.
Come back to the breath,
the rhythm,
and you'll find
your groove again.
Fall off, come back, and
get into the groove again.
Alright, Breath of
Fire's so wonderful
for kind of burning (laughs)
any toxic energy.
This is known to be really
good for preventing illness,
disease, and ultimately today
just to be a matter of fact,
this is gonna
help give us energy
for a bit of core conditioning
that hopefully centers
you and is a lot of fun.
Okay.
Alright, so hands come 
back to the belly, let's begin.
First, just one big inhale.
And a long exhale.
And inhale to
begin Breath of Fire.
(repeated breathing)
Alright keep it going.
Try to keep the
shoulders relaxed,
isolating just the
navel to the spine.
Creating that pump,
that energizing rhythm.
10 more seconds.
And let it go, big inhale 
in through the nose.
Exhale, let it out,
and close your eyes.
Release the hands to
the knees or the thighs
and just notice how you feel.
And the hands return to
the belly for round two.
Only two rounds of this,
so here we go.
Inhale in.
Exhale to release.
And inhale to
begin Breath of Fire.
10 more seconds.
And inhale in.
Exhale out 
through the nostrils.
Release the hands to
the knees or thighs,
close your eyes and observe.
Alright, just a little taste.
Notice how you feel and
let's take it on to all fours.
Tabletop Position, feel free
to pad the knees if you like.
Benji you didn't come
to me for Kapalabhati.
Usually the pets
really like Breath of Fire,
so if that happened to you,
know you're not alone,
hopefully it brought 
you some smiles.
From Tabletop Position,
drop the belly, open the chest,
lift your heart, breathe in.
Exhale, round through
the spine, chin to chest,
press into your foundation.
Good, inhale, 
drop the belly, breathe in.
Exhale, round through 
the spine, breathe out.
One more, nice and slow, inhale.
Drop the belly, breathe in.
And exhale, round through
nice and slow, breathe out.
Good, inhale, Tabletop Position.
We're gonna curl
the right toes under,
slide the right
leg all the way out
so your right heel's
really reaching out.
Then hold onto
your center your core as
you inhale, send the left
fingertips forward, thumb up.
Good now inhale, slide the right
leg up, lift the right leg.
Right toes dial down.
Exhale, bring it all in.
Knee to nose,
round through the spine
just like we did in Cat.
Try to lift your
heel to your glute.
Good, inhale, extend,
look forward,
spread the fingers,
spread the toes.
Press away from the earth,
and then exhale,
keep pressing 
away from the earth
as you round it in, contract.
So inhale, we expand,
radiating energy 
through the fingers and toes.
And then exhale, round through.
Keep it going.
Inhale, extend.
Exhale, round through.
Careful not to lock
through your right elbow.
Slight bend there. 
Inhale, extend.
Exhale, round through.
Inhale, extend.
Exhale, round through.
One more, you've got this,
stick with it.
Inhale, expand.
Exhale, round through.
Bring your left
hand to your right shin,
squeeze and lift,
squeeze and lift it in,
and then let it all go.
Alright, other side.
Curl the left toes under.
Send the left heal back.
Now before you lift anything,
connect to the torso, right?
Bring in the abdominals.
That's right, and then send
the right fingertips forward,
right thumb up.
Pull the right
shoulder back, and inhale,
slide the left leg.
Alright, inhale again to
expand whenever you're ready.
And with the exhale, reel it in.
Inhale, reach.
Exhale, bring it in.
Nice and slow, 
follow your breath.
Inhale, reach.
Exhale, bring it in.
Inhale, extend.
Exhale, bring it in.
Working on the 
muscles of the arms.
The legs, the glutes,
and the core.
Building a strong back body.
Inhale to extend.
Exhale, bring it in, last one.
If you took a break, come
on back for this last one,
inhale to spread the
fingertips and toes.
And exhale to bring it in.
Hold here, take your
right hand to your left shin,
squeeze and lift it in,
squeeze and lift.
Press into your right
foot for stability.
Whoo, and then release,
awesome work.
Walk the palms forward, keep
the knees underneath the hips.
You're gonna walk
the palms forward
so that they're not directly
underneath your shoulders.
So just a little bit as if
we were headed to Downward Dog,
except we're gonna inhale,
drop the belly here.
And then exhale,
send the hips back.
Good, come through, 
pull all the heart through,
drop the belly.
So think long Puppy 
belly here, really stretching
through the muscles of the abs,
and then exhale, send it back.
And then one more time,
slide it through,
drop the belly.
And exhale, send the
hips towards the feet.
Awesome work.
Alright, come on back,
you can keep the
hands where they are.
Curl the right toes under,
lift the right knee,
curl the right toes under,
lift the left knee,
Plank Pose, really
reaching the heels back,
crown forward.
Draw the shoulders 
away from the ears
and find your center by
lifting the navel in and up.
You got this.
Stay here breathing,
find that Ujjayi breath,
or check it out.
Lift the right heel,
let it hover.
Option here to lift the
left fingertips forward.
You can work your
way towards that.
Maybe not even this year,
maybe next year,
or five years from now.
So we're in Plank, we're
in Half Plank with the knees.
We're in Plank or
we're lifting the right leg
or we're lifting the left arm
with it for three,
two on the one,
lower, try to stay
lifted in your Plank,
and here we go.
Other side, lift the left leg,
just a little
hover here, we got this.
Maybe the right
arm reaches forward,
maybe not.
We're using this
opportunity to breathe deep,
build strength, feel that heat,
definitely a burn.
Beautiful, if the
arm is lifted, lower it.
If the leg is lifted, lower it.
Everyone lower to your knees,
bring the feet together,
knees together.
Send the hips back and
then send the fingertips
all the way back too
as you bow the head,
relax the shoulders 
down in Balasana.
Take a deep breath in.
Sigh it out with a little sound.
Again, deep breath in.
And lean into it, sigh it out.
One more time, inhale.
And let it go.
Gorgeous, slowly come back up.
Back to all fours,
swing the legs to one side,
any side, and let's come
to a seat, legs out in front.
Great, hands are gonna
come behind the thighs.
Lift those knees up
just a bit so the heels
are on the ground,
toes are pointing face up.
Now loop the shoulders 
forward, up and back,
lift the chest.
Inhale in.
Exhale, navel
draws into the spine,
so I'm connected, I'm gonna 
use that as I lean back.
Drag the heels towards the body
a little bit more and lean back.
Holding on with the arms here.
Lots of beautiful upward energy
through the front body, lots
of beautiful downward energy
through the back body.
So you may just stay here,
especially if you're
already feeling that energy,
that shake.
Or you might begin to
lift the shins parallel
to the ceiling or to the sky.
And then maybe you might
reach the fingertips forward,
draw the legs together,
just maybe.
Wherever you are,
we're here fully arriving
with each inhale.
Heels on the ground,
shins lifted,
maybe fingertips
reaching forward.
Then wherever you are,
inhale in,
exhale, and you're gonna slowly,
so even if the
heels are on the ground,
you're gonna slowly
lower all the way down,
straighten the legs,
low Boat Pose.
And then gather yourself,
come back up.
Heels can totally come 
to the ground or here.
Again, low Boat, inhale.
Use that contraction, come back 
up to wherever you were.
Let's keep it going.
Inhale, low Boat.
Exhale to lift.
Inhale, low Boat.
Exhale to lift.
Stick with it, you got it.
Inhale, low Boat.
Exhale to lift.
Inhale, low Boat.
Exhale to lift.
Now check it out.
(laughs)
Hands are gonna go
over to the left side
as we low Boat to
the left, come back up.
And now to the right,
low Boat to the right.
Come back up.
Low Boat to the left.
And back to center.
And to the right.
Back to center.
Inhale, low Boat to the left,
this time you're gonna
try to walk on to your left
butt cheek, and then
back to center, squeeze.
And you can take a full
stop here in the center moment.
And inhale to the right,
right glute,
reaching to the right
and back to the center.
Do a nice slow pace here.
Slow burn.
Left, center.
Inhale, right.
Use the exhale,
that sharp contraction,
to bring you up.
So we're using the breath,
breath's still leading the way.
Inhale, low Boat to the left.
Exhale, center.
Low Boat to the right.
Center. 
One more on each side.
If you took a break, awesome.
Come on back for this
last round, here we go.
To the left. Center.
To the right, inhale.
Exhale, center.
Beautiful.
Open the knee, soles of
the feet come together.
Inhale, loop the shoulders 
forward, up and back.
Lift your chest nice and proud.
Feel the heat in
the back of your neck
and maybe your chest and
your armpits and your legs.
Notice what it feels
like to be alive today.
Take a deep breath in.
And then exhale, 
send your heart forward,
head forward.
Maybe you grab the toes,
bend the elbows
left to right here.
And melt the heart down.
The weight of the
head can fall over.
Today for this variation,
just let it go.
Breathing.
That's hard work, way to go.
Inhale, lift the heart.
Bring the legs back to center,
and we're gonna
come onto our backs.
Alright, knees are up,
feet are on the ground,
toes pointing forward.
Interlace the fingertips,
bring them behind the head,
but go ahead and
keep the thumbs extended.
I love to extend the thumbs
to create a little
neck hammock for myself.
Elbows are gonna stay wide,
we scoop the tailbone up
so the low back's nice
and flush with the mat.
Let the breath guide you,
inhale in here.
Exhale to lift up, but
instead of crunching like so,
keep your gaze
up towards the sky.
Imagine you're
holding a piece of fruit
between your
chin and your chest.
Keep the elbows nice and wide,
and take it upon
yourself to really engage,
stay here, hang out for a second
until you feel a
little bit of a burn,
a little connection 
in the abdominals.
Now with the breath,
inhale, lower.
Exhale, contract,
and lift again.
Inhale, lower.
Exhale, lift.
You got this.
No need to think too hard.
Just follow your breath.
Let your breath lead the way.
Exhale, lift.
Inhale, lower.
Exhale, lift.
Inhale, lower.
Exhale, lift.
Keep it going.
Good. Inhale, lower. 
Exhale, lift.
The next time 
you're lifted, stay lifted.
You're gonna reach the fingertips
towards the heels here.
Stay lifted, lifted, lifted.
We're not crunching.
We're keeping the
shoulders nice and relaxed.
Now reach your left fingertips
towards your left toes.
Then come back to center.
Right fingertips
towards right toes.
Back to center.
Now keep it going.
Gazing up at the sky.
Hugging the low ribs in.
Breathing deep here.
Beautiful, 
now interlace the fingertips,
come back to your
neck hammock for support.
Head stays lifted,
elbows nice and wide.
Alright, lift the 
right shin now,
lift the left shin,
and here we go,
breathing nice and evenly,
we're gonna drop
the right toes down.
Bring it back up, and then
the left toes down.
Bring it back up.
Right toes down. 
Left toes down.
Right toes down. 
Left toes down.
Low back stays nice
and flush, you got this.
Right toes down. 
Left toes down.
Now send both legs
up towards the sky.
Take your hands, 
reach them over towards
the left side of your mat.
And this is like the old
school Yoga With Adriene image
that is like holding
Simba over the cliff.
So you're reaching,
you're really engaging your abs,
no laziness here.
Good, then bring
Simba up and over.
Take him to the right.
Up and over to the left.
Up and over to the right.
Now check it out, 
up and over to the left,
this time drop your
right leg, let it hover.
Back up to center,
legs and arms,
over to the right with Simba
and leg, left leg down to hover.
Okay back to center.
To the left,
dropping the right heel.
And to the right,
dropping the left heel.
Back and forth, you got this.
Exhaling when you
come back to center.
Alright, even it out,
one more on each side.
If you took a break, come
back all in now, here you go.
And then slowly release the head,
just the head, the neck,
the shoulders, keep the legs up.
Awesome, you're doing great.
Bring the palms down to
the earth, legs stay up here.
Last bit, we're gonna
press the palms into the earth
and we're gonna lift
the soles of the feet
all the way up towards the sky.
So here we go, inhale in.
And exhale to lift.
Inhale, lower. 
Exhale, lift.
Inhale, lower. 
Exhale, lift.
Inhale, lower. 
Exhale, lift.
Really working to
find that engagement
in the low belly here.
Doesn't have to be a
big move to do that.
You can use your palms,
in fact, do use your palms
to press into the earth.
Pressing into the earth
as you lift, and lift,
and lifting on the exhale.
Alright, if you took a break,
come on back in.
We're gonna do five
more together, here we go.
One, two, three.
And five, and release.
Beautiful.
Bring the feet to the ground,
keep the knees up.
Let's go right
into a Bridge Pose.
So toes pointing forward,
palms on the ground.
Squeeze your imaginary
block between your thighs
as you lift the hips.
Feel that stretch 
through the abdominal.
Should feel good.
You're gonna walk the shoulder
blades down and together.
You might interlace
the fingertips finding
a little bind here.
Shins forward, 
hip points lifting.
Chest to chin, chin to sky.
Take a deep breath in.
Feel the skin of 
the belly stretch.
Yes, and then slowly release.
Bring it down,
now supine Cobbler.
So, we'll open the knees,
soles of the feet come together.
This is where
we're gonna end today,
so bring your left
hand to your heart,
your right hand to your belly.
Take the deepest
breath you've taken all day.
And as you exhale, relax the
weight of your body completely
and fully into the earth.
Close your sweet
eyelids and relax your jaw.
So if today was
difficult for you,
please know you're not alone.
If you liked finding the fire,
both in pranayama 
and the breath,
and with the asana,
the movements,
then you can return 
to this practice
for some mindful conditioning.
But remember
what we're on a quest
for here is to 
have the breath really
lead the way again.
When we're babies, 
when we're children,
it happens naturally
and somewhere along the way
we kind of lose that connection.
So I'm all for
conditioning practices.
But here is to remembering
how to create those practices
in a way where they are
in a marriage with
the breath, alright.
Let's take a quiet moment here.
Notice how you feel.
And use an inhale to
fill the belly with air.
Use an exhale to draw
your navel to your spine
and from that core connection,
bring your knees together,
legs together.
Walk the feet now as
wide as the yoga mat.
Hands stay where they are
and then the knees fall inward.
Knocking in towards each other,
resting together.
So that now you can relax again
the low body
fully and completely
so you're not holding the
knees up in the air, but relaxing.
And again, just a
quiet moment here
before we close to
just notice how you feel.
And we'll end with a
cleansing breath here.
Inhale in through the nostrils.
Exhale out through the mouth.
Again, in through the nose.
And exhale, letting go of
that which no longer serves.
Sweet, inhale,
bring the palms together.
Thumbs up to the third eye.
And exhale.
And I look forward to seeing
you tomorrow for Day 7,
a little slice of heaven.
Until then, take good care.
Namaste.
