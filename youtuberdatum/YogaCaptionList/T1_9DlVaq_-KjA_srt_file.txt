- Howdy everyone. 
Welcome to Home,
your 30-day yoga journey.
Today is Day 13. 
Can you believe it?
And today we use our practice
to harness our power to grow.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alrighty, my friends,
let's begin our practice today
in a nice, comfortable 
seat of your choice.
Tuning into the 
breath right away.
As we get settled in here,
relax your shoulders.
Take this time 
to be with yourself.
We're gonna make 
some space today.
So that we can
fill it with new discovery.
Perhaps new joy.
Fresh breath.
Making room to grow.
Take a deep breath in.
And enjoy a nice, long exhale.
Twice more like that,
big inhale.
And exhale out 
through the mouth.
And one more, big inhale.
Feel the rise of the breath in.
And enjoy that gentle 
fall with your exhale.
Breathe out.
Excellent. We're gonna 
slowly crawl now to all fours.
Move nice and slow, move
like you love yourself, right?
Find what it feels good here.
You're gonna come 
to your Tabletop Position
and just check in 
with your body.
So you have some some 
vocabulary here already.
You can come in to Cat-Cow.
You can enjoy some 
gentle side to side motions.
Maybe some wiggling of the
hips, curling the toes under,
stretching through the back,
back of the legs 
and the soles of the feet.
We can take a second 
to rotate the wrists.
So I'd like to start to 
introduce a little bit of
freestyle here, right?
This kind of 
listening and responding.
So we're growing 
our practice here,
the vocabulary, but it's not
just in kind of the shapes.
It's also the way we 
approach and the way we listen.
So if you need the 
structure of Cat-Cow,
it's always there for you
but just veer off the railroad
tracks a little bit here.
Find soft, easy movement 
that feels good for your body
here today, unlucky Day 13.
Excellent.
And then take that same
commitment to listening,
just whatever dance 
you've choreographed here,
take that with you 
up into Downward Dog.
So resist the urge to just 
(snaps) follow my cue and
get up there. 
Take your time.
And when you get there,
keep going.
Stretching any areas of 
the body here in Down Dog
that might be tight.
Committing or recommitting to
this hand to earth connection.
Taking any undue 
pressure out of the wrists.
In general today there's a 
sweet invitation to just keep
checking in, making sure 
you're not working any harder
than you need to be here.
Mhmmm.
And then we'll bend the knees,
inhale to look forward.
And exhale, 
make your way to the top.
You can take baby steps.
You can do a slow crawl.
We can start to hop.
We meet feet hip width apart
so give yourself a nice
wide base here to start today.
Then relax the weight of 
the head over, Forward Fold.
Take a deep breath in here.
And a long breath out.
Great, tuck your chin 
and ground through the feet.
Start to roll up.
Really feel the power of
your legs here as you
stack up through the spine.
Stand up nice and tall here and
on your next big breath in go
ahead and reach the fingertips
all the way up towards the sky.
Right hand grabs the left wrist.
We think up an over, 
ground through all
four corners of the feet.
As you tilt to the right, 
bump the hips to the left.
Then press into the feet 
to come all the way back up.
Switch left hand 
grabs the right wrist.
Big breath in this stretch.
Think up and over as 
you lean to the left,
bump the hips to the right.
Good, come back to center.
Release the blind.
Inhale, reach up.
Exhale, float it 
down soft and easy.
Fingertips moving 
towards the earth.
Good, inhale, halfway lift.
I'll let you decide, 
maybe you play with some
airplane arms here.
Looking forward.
Maybe hands on 
the thighs, the shins
or fingertips on the earth.
And using your exhale 
to follow it back down
into your Forward Fold.
Great, fingertips 
come to the earth.
Bend your knees.
We're gonna step 
the left foot back.
Lower the left knee down
and inhale, 
open up through the chest.
Exhale, plant the palms,
lift that back knee up,
step your right foot back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Sorry, Benji, scared him.
Good, take a 
deep breath in here.
Claw through the 
fingertips and long breath out.
Great, from here, step the 
left foot up all the way back
to the lunge, and now 
lower your right knee.
Just opening up 
through the hips.
Welcoming some space.
Open up through the chest.
Breathe in, look forward.
Excellent.
Exhale, plant the palms,
step the left toes back.
Back to that 
Downward Facing Dog.
Great.
Inhale in deeply here.
And exhale out 
through the mouth.
Empty it out.
Great. Making some space.
Creating some room 
to grow, right?
Here we go. Inhale, 
lift the right leg up high.
Ooh, exhale, 
bend your right knee.
Shift it all the way forward.
Once again, lower the 
left knee to the earth.
Inhale, open up 
through the chest.
Draw your 
shoulder blades together.
Good. From here 
we're gonna pull it back
to our runners stretch.
Right toes actively 
reaching towards your face here.
Back toes can be 
curled or uncurled,
just nice conscious footing.
Pulling the right hip crease
back here for one more breath.
Awesome. Then we're gonna 
roll through that right foot.
We're gonna lift the 
back knee, listen carefully.
We're gonna bring the right hand
over to meet the left and we're
gonna continue this journey all
the way towards the left side of
the mat as we come into a
Standing Wide-Legged
Forward Fold.
From here turn 
your toes in just a bit.
If the hands 
don't come to the earth,
you can work with the palms on
the thighs and you're going to
need to activate your core.
Whatever variation, a little
core awareness goes a long way.
In time you can work to find
maybe forearms on the ground
and maybe a 
relaxation through the neck
so you're not 
holding or gripping.
But try to meet yourself 
exactly where you are today.
Bring the breath into the fold.
Inhale in.
Exhale, ground through the
feet, soft bend in the knees.
Find your center 
as we slowly roll up.
Rise up, 
take the fingertips out.
This big star pose,
reach for the sky.
Wiggle the fingertips,
take up space.
And then here we go, Warrior II.
You're gonna turn 
the right toes forward.
Left to stay turned in.
And here we go, 
pressing the palms down
into an imaginary pillow.
Why not?
Stacking up through the spine.
Remember a little bit of a
tendency to lean here
so pull it back.
You got this.
Beautiful.
Then inhale, you're gonna
send the right fingertips all
the way up towards the sky.
Straighten that front leg and
then right fingertips continue
the journey all the way back.
And nice, slow, 
steady movement here,
cartwheeling it all the 
way back down to your lunge.
Beautiful, left hand 
comes to the earth,
right fingertips 
reach up towards the sky.
Big twist.
Wiggle the 
right fingertips, inhale.
And exhale,
bring it back to your lunge.
Nice work.
Here we go, 
Downward Facing Dog,
plant the palms, 
step the right foot back.
Pedal it out here.
Big inhale in through the nose.
And long exhale 
out through the mouth.
You're doing great.
Let's keep going.
Inhale, lift the 
left leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward.
Bring that left knee 
up and in with control.
Step it up.
Once again, right knee 
kisses the earth softly.
Inhale, open up 
through the chest.
Good.
Pull it back, breathe out,
flex your left toes towards your
face, actively pulling 
that left hip crease back,
big stretch here.
You gotta bring the breath.
And then here we go, 
growing the vocabulary,
we're gonna roll 
through the left foot.
Find that lift up from 
the pelvic floor, activate.
You got it.
We're gonna take the left
fingertips over to the right.
You're gonna turn your left
toes in as you walk your hands
towards the outer edge of 
the right side of your mat.
And here we go again,
Standing Wide-Legged 
Forward Fold, your version.
So you can use the toes turning
in here to really accentuate
this grip through the 
outer edges of your feet.
Draw up through 
the inner arches.
Engage the inner thighs.
Yeah, you got it.
And then we can 
always bring the hands
to the tops of 
the thighs here.
Actually requires a 
little more core strength.
Or in time we can work 
to bring the elbows down,
maybe relax the 
weight of the head over.
Such a therapeutic posture.
Take one more deep 
inhale in, wherever you are.
And then exhale, 
soft bend in the knees.
Here we go, 
slowly rolling up, rising up,
send the fingertips 
out left to right.
Own it. Take up space.
Big breath in.
Long breath out.
Good, inhale in, 
wiggle the fingertips.
Exhale, Warrior II.
We're gonna turn 
the left toes forward,
bend that left knee.
Sink it down into 
Virabhadrasana II.
Dig into your left heel.
Press into the ball 
joint of the that left big toe.
You got this.
Hug the low ribs in.
Find your focus.
Then inhale, straighten 
through that front leg,
send the left 
fingertips up first.
So we're really 
lifting up out of the hip.
Finding that extension all
the way through the shoulder,
the arm and then take it back.
So think up and over,
all the way back,
eventually left 
fingertips reach.
Big inhale.
Mindful through the neck.
Exhale, from center 
bend that front knee,
slow and steady 
wins the race here,
cartwheel it all the 
way back down to your lunge.
Lean into your right hand.
We'll continue the journey.
Opening the heart to the left.
Finding our twist, 
left fingertips to the sky.
Wiggle the left fingertips.
Breathe in.
And exhale to bring it 
back down to your lunge.
Beautiful, plant the palms,
step it back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Really claw through 
the fingertips.
Little to no pressure in 
the wrists once we start
getting the hang
of this hand lock. Okay?
Inhale lots of love in.
Exhale lots of love out.
Bend your knees.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale, to make 
your way to the top.
Feet hip width apart or now
let's bring them flush together
if that's available to you,
zipper up through the legs.
On your next breath in 
find that nice flat back,
your version.
And exhale to soften and fold.
Root to rise here.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Big breath. Big stretch.
Listen carefully, exhale, 
float the fingertips all the way
back down, bend your knees.
Inhale, halfway lift, 
your version once again.
Hi, Benji, sweet boy.
Exhale to fold.
Bow the head.
Alright, from here, 
we're gonna walk the feet
as wide as the yoga mat.
Toes are gonna spill off.
Use your fingertips here 
on the earth to guide you.
Inhale in.
Exhale, sink nice and low.
So amp up the breath here.
Lift up off the heels as needed.
If the heels are reaching 
down towards the earth,
really, really commit to all
four corners of 
the feet grounding.
Then everyone, 
wherever you are,
find a little lift 
from the pelvic floor.
Grow nice and 
tall through the spine.
Crown of the head 
lifts, lifts, lifts.
Wherever you are, we're
here for three, breathe deep.
Two, on the one, bring your
hands back to support you.
You're gonna come 
through to a seat.
Go ahead and center 
yourself on the mat.
Soles of the feet 
come to the earth first,
hands are gonna come together,
Anjuli Mudra at the heart
and we're just going 
to start to lean back.
Keeping this length 
up through the spine.
Sternum lifting, lifting,
lifting up to the thumbs.
So you can come
just like half an inch 
to even engage the core
or in time you'll find okay, 
I'm gonna come all the way back
here to engage my 
full abdominal wall.
So you get to grow the practice
and that's kind of the wonderful
thing about the regularity of
showing up is you really would
be surprised how fast things
evolve when you take time to
show up on a regular basis.
So in other words, 
this is not meant
to torture you, this next ditty.
This is gonna be a 
nice little goal posts,
little signpost.
Here we go, lean back,
if you're not already.
If you are, you're like,
"I'm shaking here, Adriene.
Shut up!" (laughs)
Okay, keep the toes on 
the ground if you like,
just lift the heels or 
lift the feet all the way up,
shins parallel to the ceiling.
Inhale in to reestablish this
lift up through the front body.
Exhale, extend 
just the right leg.
You can flex the foot or point
the toes and you're gonna turn
to dial your heart and 
your hands towards the left.
Inhale, 
regroup and center, lift.
Exhale, twist to the right,
extend the left leg.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to twist.
Slow and steady.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to twist.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to twist.
Feel that heat.
Again, big toes can 
be on the ground here.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to twist.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to twist.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to twist.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to twist.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to twist.
One more time on each side. 
You got it.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to twist.
Inhale to lift.
Last one!
Exhale to twist.
Beautiful, come back to center.
Use your hands to 
lift your heart up.
Walk the feet as 
wide as the hips.
Go ahead and hook the elbows on
the knees and allow the weight
of your head to melt down.
Bow your head to your heart.
Take a second here to 
simply notice how you feel.
Inhale in.
As you exhale, 
slowly lift the head,
cross the ankles, 
come back to a nice,
comfortable seat.
We'll take a little 
gentle twist to the right.
And a little gentle 
twist to the left.
Now dip, baby, dip.
Come on, let's dip, baby, dip.
And back to center, 
bring the palms together
one last time here today.
Close your eyes.
I admire you for 
taking this time
and space to 
be with yourself
to provide yourself 
this time and space,
this opportunity to grow.
Great work today.
Go ahead and inhale, lift the
thumbs up to the third eye.
And exhale big curve in 
the spine as you bow forward.
And we whisper
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
