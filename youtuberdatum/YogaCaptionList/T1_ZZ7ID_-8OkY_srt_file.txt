- Hello, my sweet friends.
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 25.
Bring a pillow and a 
blanket to class today,
if you have it.
If not, it's okay.
Today we unwind.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alright, my sweet friend,
let's begin seated.
If you have a blanket, 
let's sit on it here today.
Benji, ready?
Sit up on the blanket.
Lift the hips just a little.
Then allow your hands to rest
gently on your lap 
or on your knees.
And we have a quick, 
lovely little ditty here today
to help you unwind,
stretch and just take it easy.
Mucho take it easy.
Sit up tall, inhale in.
Exhale, close your eyes,
relax your shoulders.
Come into stillness here
and continue to gently 
deepen your breath.
Best you can 
slow down your breath.
Begin to soften 
any areas of the body
that might feel like 
they're tight or clenched.
And then begin to simply 
notice, notice how you feel.
Notice the thoughts that arrive.
Acknowledge those thoughts,
whatever they may be.
And then slowly 
allow them to pass.
Come back to the 
sound of your breath.
Inviting stillness.
A sense of calm.
Even a sense of relaxation here.
Then nice and slow, 
dropping the chin to the chest,
bowing the head to the heart,
feeling that deep stretch in the
back of the neck as 
you bow your head down.
Breathing nice, 
smooth, deep breaths.
And again, noticing any 
thoughts that come up here.
Whatever they may be.
And then just like 
the passing clouds,
acknowledge them, see them
and then allow them to move.
Come back to the 
sound of your breath.
Gently bring your left 
ear over your left shoulder.
Breathe in.
Breathe out.
Then slowly reach 
your right fingertips out
to kiss the earth, breathe in.
And breathe out.
Then flex your right palm.
Reaching the right fingertips 
up towards the sky, breathe in.
Breathe out.
And as if you were smoothing
your right hand up a wall,
you're gonna slowly 
continue with your deep breaths.
Just reach the 
fingertips all the way up
in line with the right shoulder.
Might feel pretty intense here.
And then nice and slow,
maybe on an exhale,
slide it back down.
You can just move up and down
here gently in your own time.
Unwinding any tension 
here in the trapezius
and on through the neck.
The forearms.
Okey doke, last but not least,
with the right 
hand pressing out,
we might take the left hand
and gently rest the 
left palm on the right ear.
We're not actually pressing,
we're just allowing the weight,
soft weight of this 
hand to just do the last
bit of work here.
Inhale in.
And then exhale to release.
Hands back to the 
knees or the thighs.
We'll bring it 
back up to center.
Drop the chin to the chest.
And then right ear 
over right shoulder.
Inhale in.
Exhale to relax 
the shoulders down.
Just take a 
couple of breaths here.
Close your eyes.
Just keep 
acknowledging those thoughts.
And then coming 
back to your breath.
As you're ready, bring your
left fingertips to the earth.
Breathe.
Maybe part the lips here.
Soften through the jaw.
Today really getting
a chance to go, aha.
Focus on sensation.
As you're ready, 
lifting the left fingertips
up towards the sky.
You can play here
gently in this range of lifting
the left palm up and down.
Then adding this 
last layer, if you like,
of the right hand gently 
placed over the left ear.
Breathe deep here.
Ooh, yes. (chuckles)
Inhale in.
Exhale to release.
Ooh, yes.
Bring it all the way back.
Head over heart, 
heart over pelvis.
On your next inhale, 
go ahead and squeeze
the shoulders all 
the way up to the ears.
Squeeze, squeeze,
squeeze and lift.
And then exhale, drop 'em down.
Twice more like that.
Inhale, squeeze and lift.
Exhale to release.
And last one, inhale,
squeeze and lift.
And exhale, drop it down.
Awesome. From here 
we're gonna come
all the way onto our backs,
go ahead and leave your 
blanket here out to the side.
However, if you want to grab
your pillow and use it for the
head and neck, go for it.
Come on to the back.
We're gonna extend 
the left leg out long.
We're gonna hike the right knee
all the way up into the chest
and just take a second here
to draw a little 
line back and forth.
You can actually keep 
that left leg soft here for now.
We're gonna draw 
a line back and forth.
Think about drawing a line from
your right shoulder, so really
opening up through your 
right shoulder and then drawing
your right knee in 
towards your heart.
So left to right here.
Excellent. Now we're gonna 
reach the right hand into grab
the right inner arch for a little 
One-Legged Stirrup posture.
Take your left hand, 
place it firmly on the top
of your left hip crease.
And now we'll start to
activate through that left foot.
Great, then on your next inhale,
send the sole of your right foot
up towards the sky.
If this is a much too much,
you can bend your left knee
and bring your 
left foot to the ground
for a little 
extra stability here.
Kick your right foot up towards
the sky and anchor your right
shoulder down, just like 
we do in our Eagle Poses.
So my right hamstring's 
getting sunshine here.
I'm breathing deep.
Again, we can 
always bend that left knee,
bring the left 
foot to the ground.
Alright, inhale in.
Long exhale out.
Inhale in again.
Exhale to release,
nice and slow.
You're gonna 
bring the right knee in,
interlace the fingertips 
behind the hamstring
and then kick your right foot 
all the way up towards the sky.
If the right knee is bent here,
that's all good.
In time, you can work to 
lengthen those muscles and
straighten the leg.
So it's all good 
if the knees bent.
If the leg is straight,
really flex those right toes
towards your face.
Stay here or option to slide
the hands to the calf, perhaps.
Calf.
Or we can take the index finger,
the middle finger and thumb and
we can grab the big toe here.
Nice and easy with the breath.
In control.
Inhale in.
Exhale to release.
Send the right leg out long.
Take a deep breath in here,
both legs extended.
And exhale to relax everything.
Awesome. Hug the left
knee all the way up and in.
Moving from the left 
shoulder to the heart center.
Nice and slow.
You can keep the right 
leg soft here to start.
Close your eyes.
Massage the front of 
that left hip crease.
Move that ball 
and socket around.
Keep the shoulders relaxed.
Then start to 
engage your right leg.
Bring the left 
knee back to center.
We're gonna reach through.
Left hand grabs 
the left inner arch,
right hand comes to 
the top of the right thigh.
And when you're ready, inhale,
kick the sole 
of the left foot up.
Remember, you can 
bend this right knee,
bring the left 
foot to the earth here.
So the action is kicking the
left foot up towards the sky as
you're drawing 
the left shoulder down
so you find
your opposition here.
That push and pull.
And then return to your breath.
Mmmm.
Lovely.
Inhale in.
Exhale out.
Inhale in again.
Exhale to release.
Bring the knee back to center,
interlace the fingertips
behind the hamstring.
Right leg is nice and strong and
we'll kick that left 
foot all the way up.
And then just check 
it out on this side.
Maybe you stay here
at the hamstring.
Maybe come up to the left calf.
Or maybe we find the 
bind here with the big toe.
And returning to the breath.
Shoulders relaxed.
Inhale in.
Deep breath.
Exhale to slowly release.
Send both legs out long.
Rest your hands gently on
the front of the hip creases,
just relax everything.
Big inhale.
Long exhale.
Awesome. Bend the knees, 
bring the feet to the mat.
Happy Baby, we're gonna
reach through, grab both arches.
So you can do the arches here
for a little double stirrup or
you can grab the 
outer edges of the feet.
We're gonna kick both 
feet up towards the sky.
Drop the shoulders 
down to the earth.
Think about reaching your
tailbone towards the front edge
of the mat so you feel this
nice connection in the low back,
the sacrum and the earth.
Then you can find any soft, easy
movement here that feels good.
Like a Happy Baby 
laying on your favorite quilt.
Or you can enjoy the stillness.
Inhale in.
Exhale to release.
From here, we're gonna grab the
blanket and you have an option,
you can take the blanket,
bring it to rest on 
the hip creases here.
Or you can roll it up 
and put it behind the knees.
Particularly if you're feeling
any fuzziness in the low back.
Benji's relaxed.
We're well on our way.
Here we go.
Snuggle the shoulder blades
underneath your heart space.
I love the image of like a bear
massaging its back on a tree.
Crawl the shoulder blades down.
Let your arms rest 
gently at your sides.
Inhale in.
Deepest breath 
you've taken all day.
As you exhale, 
close your eyes, Shavasana.
Relax the weight of 
your body completely
and fully into the earth.
Now bring your attention,
your mind's eye to 
the soles of your feet.
With so much love 
and respect and care,
dear one, bring your awareness
from the soles of your feet,
scan the body, bring it all the
way up to the top of your head.
Take your time.
Just a loving scan.
Drawing your awareness 
from the soles of your feet.
Eventually all 
the way to the crown.
Softening and relaxing 
any areas of the body
that might feel tense or tight.
Allow the body to be heavy.
Allow your heart to be soft.
Just a few more 
quiet breaths here.
Enjoy.
Now slowly draw your 
index finger and thumb together.
Rub your index finger 
and thumb together.
And then the 
middle finger and thumb.
Your ring finger and thumb.
And your pinky and your thumb.
Begin to wiggle the toes.
Open and close the palms.
And as you're ready, inhale,
sweep the arms all the way up
towards the sky and then 
all the way up behind you,
full body stretch.
Inhale in.
And exhale out.
Once more, inhale in.
And empty it out.
Draw the palms together.
Slide your thumbs 
down to your third eye.
The awesome in me
recognizes the awesome in you.
Way to show up today.
Inhale in.
And exhale to whisper
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
