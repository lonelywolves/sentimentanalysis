- Hello, my darling friends.
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
Today is Day 12.
Today I'm gonna invite you to
bring a blanket to class if you
have one, if not, no worries,
because today we 
focus on nurturing.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alright, let's begin 
today's session in
a comfortable 
seat of your choice.
Come on down to the ground.
You can lay your blanket out
like I have here or just keep it
off to the side for now.
We're gonna sit up really tall.
And take a deep breath in.
And as you exhale, just 
allow your shoulders to drop,
really come into 
the present moment here.
Whatever you're bringing to 
the mat remember, it's all good.
Today's practice is low to
the ground and super yummy.
We're gonna just kind of nurture
the body and the spirit even if
you've had kind of a monkey
brain or if you're feeling a
little stressed, this is gonna
be an efficient practice
to just kind of 
smooth it all out and
nurture whatever 
is going on today.
So this is what our 
practice is all about.
Let's take 
another deep breath in.
And exhale, 
relax your shoulders.
It's not about kind of sweeping
what's going on under the rug so
you can get your workout in.
No, the yoga practice is
unique in that way.
Close your eyes 
or soften your gaze.
Take one more full 
breath in and as you exhale,
use that to relax 
your shoulders down
and just land in the moment.
Land here in 
your practice, own it.
Excellent, then we'll 
bring the palms together,
bow the head to the heart, 
start to feel that stretch
through the back of the neck.
Thank you so 
much for showing up.
You guys are just so incredible.
I can't believe we are
actually doing this together,
going on this journey.
I never take it for 
granted so awesome work.
Enjoy today's session.
Inhale in.
Exhale, lift the head.
We're gonna come into a shape
here where you're gonna want to
draw your left heel in towards
your body and then you're gonna
shift your weight so that you
can take your right heel behind
you and towards 
your right glute.
And if the hips are tight,
which they likely are,
we might have a little trouble
dropping this hip down in socket
but in time we will get there.
So you can always take 
your blanket and put it right
underneath this 
glute to support you here.
So I've been kind 
of playing around here,
showing up for the at-home 
yoga practice for a while
so mine's starting to drop here.
We have this shape that's 
like I'm posing with Benji
for like my volleyball photo.
So find the shape and it should
feel pretty snugly 
in that right hip.
Alright, then 
we're gonna inhale,
reach up towards 
the sky, big breath.
Exhale, you're going to draw
your navel in and up and
you're going to 
twist to the left.
Right hand comes to the 
outer edge of the left knee.
Left fingertips come 
to support you behind.
And then you're gonna play
here with that right hip socket.
You gonna move a 
little in and out.
Sit up nice and 
tall as you breathe in.
And then use your 
exhale to release.
We're gonna do a counter-
twist now, be very gentle.
Left hand comes now to the
outer edge of the right thigh,
right fingertips behind.
You're gonna 
collapse a little bit here.
So we'll use the inhale 
to lift the heart as always.
Find a lift with the breath in
and exhale twist maybe looking
past your right shoulder.
Wonderful, from here inhale in.
Exhale to slowly release.
Keep your right heel 
coming in towards center.
We're gonna slowly, mindfully
keep right toes active 
as you move here.
We're gonna extend that right
leg and then we're gonna shift
our hips so that we 
can face our right toes.
Head to knee pose, 
Janusirsansan or your version,
let's see what 
happens here today.
As we inhale, we're going to
reach the fingertips up high.
And I'd like to invite you to
bend your right knee 
as you lift up.
Then think up and over.
So low belly draws up and in
as you drape or work towards
bringing your belly 
towards the top of the thigh.
That was redundant,
but you got it.
Belly towards 
the top of the thigh.
And then from here you can
work to straighten the leg.
This should feel nurturing.
You're wanting to be active and
attentive but this should feel
kind of yummy so you don't need
to slam your nose to the knee.
We're not taking, um, 
I'm not gonna say that.
Okay. So I'll stop talking.
Allow you to listen to 
the sound of your breath here.
Right knee can be as 
generously as you need.
You can interlace the 
fingertips around the heel
or keep them close 
to your center.
Relax. Wiggle your head, 
listen to your breath.
Take one more 
cycle of breath here, in.
Use your exhale to roll 
up and out of the shape.
Take a second here to 
just notice how you feel.
Soften through your right foot.
And then let's switch.
Right heel comes in.
I think it's a good little tip,
I think it is a good idea,
particularly if you're 
new to the practice,
just keep your feet kind of
active and bright when you're
moving through different shapes.
Helps protect the joint.
It seems like 
such a small thing,
but trust me, it's good.
It's a good idea.
So keep those toes 
active as you bring
your left heel 
towards your left glue.
We're here. Benji, ready 
for our volleyball photo?
Just giving everyone a 
second to get in the shape.
And then just notice the 
sensation on the left side.
What is different there,
if anything?
Okay. Here we go.
Inhale, reaching all the way 
up toward the sky, big breath.
Lifting from the hip creases all
the way up through the side body
and then gentle twist.
Here we go, left hand to the
outer edge of the right knee.
Right fingertips behind.
Inhale to lift 
and lengthen here.
Exhale to twist.
Moving the energy here that
runs up and down the spine.
You got to bring the breath.
Big inhale.
Lengthen.
Mhmmm.
Exhale, slow release.
Counter-twist.
Paying attention 
to that left hip.
Right hand comes to the outer
edge of the left thigh or to
your dog's head if 
you have one there.
And then here we go.
If you feel like you're 
collapsed in the spine,
lift up from the sternum,
lengthen through the crown and
then use your tools.
Find that upward current of
energy through the front body
and that downward current of
energy through the back body and
see if that changes 
your shape at all.
So we're working from 
the inside out a nurturing,
holistic practice here.
Inhale in.
Use your exhale 
to slowly release.
Alright, head to knee 
pose on the other side.
You're gonna keep 
your right heel in.
Here we go.
Let's see how can
I navigate this.
Darling angel, excuse me.
You mind if I come here?
Extend your left leg out long.
That'll do.
Excellent, and you're 
gonna turn your center
and your heart to 
face your left foot.
Flex your left toes 
towards your face. (giggles)
And here we go.
Inhale, reach 
up towards the sky.
Exhale, oh see 
know I'm not, okay,
let me be a better guide here.
Inhale, reach 
up towards the sky.
Thank you for hanging with me,
bend your left knee.
So especially if you've been
practicing for a long time,
you're going to want
to just like come here, boom.
But let's bend the left knee.
Start with it lifted 
and then drape over.
And then from here is where
we can find the extension.
This is just a little bit,
in my opinion, healthier.
So we start to stretch through
like the belly of the muscles,
for example, 
the hamstring versus just
where the muscles attach.
Mhmmm, and then come on down
to your version of the shape.
Come into this
kind of private 
little love cave here
and listen to the 
sound of your breath.
Feel the skin of the back 
stretch as you breathe in.
And the belly, 
soften as you breathe out.
Soften the skin of the forehead,
relax tongue in your mouth,
soften the jaw.
This posture, this asana
providing the nurturing effect
to the nervous system.
But you have to 
bring the breath.
You got it.
Inhale in.
Exhale, slowly 
begin to roll it back up.
Pause. Soften through that foot.
Let everything go 
here for a second.
Just notice how you feel.
And then we'll release that.
I'm gonna come now to 
Cobbler's Pose, Baddha Konasan.
So now both heels 
are gonna come in.
This is a great shape to
consider lifting the hips so we
can roll up the blanket,
fold up a blanket,
excuse me, sit up tall.
Just give yourself 
a little more space
to find length up 
through the spine.
Then we'll start by grabbing the
ankles and drawing the shoulder
blades in together 
and down the back body.
We've been doing 
this whole journey,
so apply, apply here.
Tops of the 
thighs get really heavy.
And we find this 
lift up through the front.
And then kind of lean back
here as you find this grounding
energy through the back body.
Great, inhale in.
Exhale, bend the elbows, pull
them back as if you're like in
Chaturanga here and 
we're gonna slowly look
forward looking 
into our reflection.
I always joke this is 
like that Zoolander moment.
Like, "Who am I?"
And then we can move 
the hands now to the toes.
If you're practicing 
in a chilly environment,
maybe you can 
warm your toes up here.
Bend your elbows 
now left to right.
And then play here, 
inhaling to find extension,
maybe exhaling to 
fold in toward home,
in towards yourself,
your center.
Listen to the 
sound of your breath.
And trust, trust the practice.
Trust that it's working.
Trust that you are 
being led to the right place.
Bring your breath.
Now, you're gonna 
want to come out here.
I'd lovingly invite you to stay.
Stay awhile.
Three more cycles of breath.
Count 'em out.
Move from your middle,
draw your navel in.
Find center and 
then roll up from there.
Baddha Konasana, Cobbler's 
Pose, sit up nice and tall.
Inhale in.
And exhale to release.
Awesome work.
So check it out, before we 
get into their cozy wozies,
I don't know if I've 
ever said that in my life,
okay, great.
Say it in front of millions of
people, Adriene. (chuckles)
I want to bring 
you into a Boat Pose.
What? This is 
supposed to be nurturing.
But can we find, we're 
not gonna do High Boat,
Low Boat, but can we 
find a little core connecting?
Can we bring this 
kind of yummy layer
of our theme into it?
So you can even claps opposite
wrist with the hand here as you
lean back and 
let it be supportive?
Or if you're like, 
"Perfect. I liked this practice,
"but I just need a
little fire in my belly,"
great, take it here.
Last option would 
be to grab the shins,
extend one leg.
Then bend and extend the other.
Maybe you extend both, find that
sense of calm in this Navasan,
this Boat shape.
Or work to find it, right?
It could be here.
"No problem, Adriene, I got it."
Or here.
Then find your 
breath wherever you are.
And see if you can take
three cycles of breath here.
And then slowly release.
Grab your blanket.
Alright little, little Benji.
You're going to 
take your blanket.
Oh, wow. I know.
We can share it and we're gonna
bring the blanket to either
cover your whole body or you can
bring it to just wrap your feet.
You're just gonna get 
into a little burrito pose.
The kids love burrito pose
or like the kid in all of us.
So wrap up like 
a little burrito.
Looks like I have a breathing
bolster here to lay my head on.
If you don't have 
a breathing bolster,
highly recommended,
but you have to 
take care of them.
Okay. (chuckles)
Here I go.
Okay, excellent.
Come on down to the ground.
And we want to get comfy here.
You can interlace 
the fingertips.
Bring the hands 
behind the head, elbows wide.
Maybe cactus arms.
Maybe fingertips 
softly interlace on
the belly or if you want 
to come into a traditional,
sorry I got so relaxed
(laughs), traditional Shavasan,
just allow your hands to 
rest gently at your sides.
And then close your eyes.
And think about the 
things you would like to
be held in.
Think about
the things,
if anything,
that you would 
like to be blanketed in.
Support.
Creativity.
Love.
Sense of 
camaraderie or community.
Think of the things that you
would like to nurture and be
nurtured in.
And let's use this time 
on the mat to once again
close the gap between 
the things that we want,
that we want to attract and
what we are experiencing
in our everyday quality of life.
If any of that resonates,
wonderful.
If not, don't you 
worry about a thing.
Just take a deep breath in.
And everyone use an exhale to
relax the weight of your body
completely and 
fully into the earth.
Please do not underestimate the
power of just a few moments of
stillness here 
consciously breathing.
Talk about a 
moment of self care.
There's so many 
of you out there
I know are caretakers.
Some of you really 
intense and beautiful,
almost heroic caretakers.
So take just a 
moment here longer
to blanket yourself
in love and 
support and care.
Fill your cup.
You don't have to do anything.
Just receive.
Just allow.
Bring your 
awareness to your breath.
As you're ready, begin to
wiggle the fingers, the toes.
You know you can 
always pause this video,
just reach, hit the button and
then come back into the shape
if you want to be here longer.
We're gonna 
slowly bend the knees,
turn to one side, any side,
and we're gonna 
press up to seated.
And you can take your blanket
and bring it around you.
And if you don't 
have a blanket, don't worry,
you can just use,
take the metaphor, right?
And run with it, baby.
(chuckles)
Of blanketing
yourself in love and support.
Let's bring the palms together.
You're gonna start to 
move the palms back and forth,
creating a little friction,
a little heat, a little energy.
Then get a little faster.
Close your eyes and 
get a little faster,
a little faster, a little faster
and even faster and then we'll
bring the hands 
right to the chest,
right to the heart and just feel
the warmth of your palms there.
Close your eyes again.
If you haven't already,
tuck the chin just slightly.
So some days we're 
gonna be asked to sweat here,
to work hard,
but may today's 
practice remind you
that each time we 
show up on the mat,
particularly with at-home yoga,
we have an opportunity to
welcome in this 
sense of being nurtured,
of being met,
of being supported, held,
blanketed in love, divine.
That's a shout out to the 
Carter Family tune called,
"Anchored In Love Devine".
Alright, bring 
the palms together,
thumbs up towards the third eye.
You guys are doing awesome.
Such an honor and a pleasure
to be on this ride with you.
I look forward to 
seeing you tomorrow.
Let's inhale in deeply.
And exhale, deep bow today,
all the way to the earth.
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
