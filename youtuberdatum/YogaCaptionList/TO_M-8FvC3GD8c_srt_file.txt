- Hello everyone. 
Welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene, this is Benji
and today we 
have office break yoga.
So you asked for it. 
This is a huge request.
This is a quick little ditty
that you can do on a break in
your place of work or even just
at home when you don't feel like
you have quite enough time to
change your outfit 
and roll out the mat.
You don't need a yoga mat and
you don't need stretchy pants
for today's practice 
so let's get started.
(bright music)
Okey doke, let's begin standing.
If you aren't able to kick off
your shoes and socks or just
your shoes then I'm gonna go
ahead and support that but if
you can't don't worry about it.
You can still do this 
practice in your footwear.
Alright, this practice is all
standing so if you're working at
a desk right now, you can check
out the yoga at your desk video.
I made it several 
years ago and it's super fun.
It has music and no talking,
just subtitles so if you like
this video or you want to check
out more give that one a try.
I'll link it in the description
down below but for now let's
bring the feet a little bit
wider than hip width apart.
If you're wearing an outfit
today that doesn't really allow
you to get much space you can 
do this with the feet together
or feet hip width apart.
Otherwise, take up just a little
bit of space and let's bring the
hands together at the heart
because you don't need a
90 minute sweat 
session to practice yoga.
Yoga is about
carving out 
any amount of time
for yourself to unite
the mind and 
the body with the breath.
So I always say a little goes
a long way and especially if
you're backing it up 
with nice conscious breaths.
So let's take a 
deep breath in together.
Stand up nice and tall.
And as you exhale just 
relax your shoulders down.
And one more just like that.
Big inhale, 
ground through your feet,
stand up nice and tall.
And exhale, 
relax the shoulders down.
Beautiful, release the 
fingertips down and nice and
easy we're gonna take 
the gaze up towards the sky.
Lift the chin and then exhale,
drop the chin to the chest.
Inhale, look up.
Exhale, chin to chest.
One more time, inhale, look up.
Exhale, chin to chest.
Beautiful, align 
your head over your heart,
your heart over your pelvis.
You're gonna interlace 
the fingertips behind you.
Now don't worry about getting
the palms together unless that
feels really good today.
You can keep the 
wrists nice and square,
wrists nice and square which
would be really great for the
wrists and the forearms 
and the hands particularly
if you use your hands at work.
Alright, start to 
open up through the chest.
Lift the heart.
Kind of come out 
of our shells, right?
Whether you do 
this at work or not,
we all tend to live in cultures
in which we spend a lot of time
with the shoulders rounding
forward so let's counteract that
today by, again, 
squaring the wrists,
lifting the chest.
Take a deep breath in.
Stand up nice and tall.
A little power pose here.
And then very slowly you're
gonna draw a line with your
nose past your right shoulder.
Work to find a beautiful stretch
in the left side of your neck.
Ground through the heels.
Great, then bring 
it back to center
and just take it 
to the other side.
Feeling beautiful big stretch
through the right 
side of the neck.
Awesome, from here 
come back to center.
You're gonna 
turn the left toes in,
turn the right toes out and 
if you have the ability to
just take a slightly wider stance,
you'll inch your foot
forward just a bit.
Alright, pull the right hip
crease in towards your center.
So just really finding 
that connection to the earth.
Pulling right hip crease back.
And then a little 
modified Pyramid Pose here.
So you're gonna send your 
hips back, look forward.
You don't have to go into the
full gesture here but it's gonna
be really good for your back.
and it's gonna feel really good 
in the back of your leg here
the further you lean 
your heart forward.
We're working on stability.
We're opening the chest.
We're drawing the 
shoulder blades together.
Back foot is firmly grounded.
Improving posture one 
breath at a time here
as you hug the low ribs in.
Yes, and then 
slowly come back to center.
Try to keep your 
fingertips interlaced.
You're gonna turn 
the right toes in.
Turn the left toes out.
And then again just a gentle
awareness of the left hip crease
kind of pulling up and in and
then we'll inhale to reinforce
this opening in the chest.
And then exhale, 
I like the image of kind of
looking in a pond here.
So don't worry about creating
this huge yoga pose, the shape.
(laughs) Thank you, Benji.
Keep the spine nice and long.
You're hugging the low ribs in.
This is challenging.
We're here for three, two 
and on the one come on up.
Alright, bring the toes to point
forward again and here we go,
release the arms.
Ah, feel that awareness and that
sensation in the hands and then
let's celebrate the fact that
we're alive and able to sneak in
this little yoga break with one
of my favorite little gestures
called Knocking 
on Heaven's Door.
You can call it 
whatever you want.
It's a great little dance to get 
the blood flowing again and
to get some energy 
back in your body.
It can help you if you're
feeling like your head's gonna
burst from workload or 
boredom or frustration.
Just movin' it around.
And if you've never done 
this before in you're like,
"What the heck am I doing?"
Just try to let 
loose a little bit here.
Smile, you can definitely
use a little sense of humor.
Keep it going here.
You might start to pick up the
speed and my only real loving
note is to keep the knees
bent so that you don't end up
bringing any fussiness 
into your knee joint.
Alright, keep it going.
Here we go.
For three, two.
On the one come back 
to your Mountain Pose.
Again, feet still a little bit
wider than hip width apart
if that's where you started.
When you're ready we're
gonna spread the fingertips and
inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale, float 
the fingertips down.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale, float it down.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
This time palms come 
together up and overhead.
And then you're gonna 
interlace the fingertips,
keep the index 
finger pointed forward.
We call the steeple grip.
Think of this upward current of
energy really whooshing up your
front body here and then
ground through your back body.
Keep the feet 
exactly where they are.
Inhale in and exhale slowly lean
towards one side, any side.
Great, then come back.
Inhale in, exhale, slowly 
lean to the opposite side.
Good, beautiful, 
come back to center.
We're gonna release, 
bend the elbows here.
They're gonna come to 
like a cactus arms or,
I'm in Texas, we call 'em 
football goal post arms but
let's do cactus today.
And from here you're 
gonna bring the backs
of the hands all the way back.
Don't go too crazy here.
Just enough to where you feel a
nice stretch in the front body,
breathing deep.
Inhale in, exhale, close it.
Palms kiss together.
Inhale to open.
Exhale to close.
Feet stay grounded.
Inhale to open.
Exhale to close.
One more, inhale to 
open and exhale to close.
Beautiful, release 
the fingertips down.
Take a deep, deep breath in.
And a long cleansing breath out.
Gorgeous, we're gonna draw
little circles now with the nose
one way and then the other.
And then allow that little
circle to get bigger and
bigger and bigger.
And then reverse your circle.
Oh yeah.
If you don't have time for a
yoga break necessarily a little
bit of neck hygiene every day,
daily neck and should hygiene
goes a long way.
Okay, from here we're all
gonna bring the feet together,
really together.
And we're gonna return 
back to those cactus arms.
Take a deep breath in.
And as you exhale, you're gonna
bring the right arm underneath
the left for Eagle Arms.
So you can just come 
to kind of a karate (chuckles)
little karate chop move here
or maybe the 
palm wraps around.
Don't worry too much 
about what's happening here.
More so we want to lift the
chest and feel this broadening
through the upper back body.
Then maybe we just 
work the front body,
excuse me, the upper body today
or if it's available to you in
your space and in your 
body or your outfit today,
your footwear 
you'll bend the knees.
And maybe, just maybe 
lift the right heel up,
finding a little balance.
If you're in a position where
you can go a little further
today, we'll lift the right 
knee up, cross it over.
Imagine you're 
sitting now in the chair,
imaginary chair so 
get down nice and low.
And if you can and want 
to wrap that foot around
for full Eagle Pose, you can.
Don't worry, do your best.
Breathing deep, 
working with what you've got.
Stirring the pot.
Refocusing your mind on what
matters most and replenishing
the body because 
you love your body.
Inhale, lift the elbows high.
Exhale to unravel everything
come back to Mountain.
Inhale, squeeze the 
shoulders up to the ears.
Exhale, to let everything go.
Drop the shoulders down.
Awesome, back to cactus arms.
Inhale. Exhale.
This time elbows come in and
left arm goes under the right.
Find your 
variation on this side.
And again you can just work with
feet grounded in Mountain or if
it's available bend your knees,
send your hips back.
Connect to your core.
And then maybe 
lifting the left heel.
And maybe in time if not today
maybe another day even
wrapping your left foot around.
Just check it out.
Hold on to a focal point here.
This is the most pretzel-y
we'll do so you're doing great.
Hang with it, breathe deep.
Try to control your 
breath no matter what
your body's doing here.
Great and then wherever 
you are, my darling friend,
inhale lift your elbows up
and then exhale to unravel.
One more time, 
interlace the fingertips behind.
Feet hip width 
apart or flush together.
We'll lift the chest to take a
deep breath in and then bend
your knees a lot as you 
send your heart forward.
Knuckles, hands reach up and
we come into a Forward Fold.
Ooh yeah.
So bend your knees 
as much as you need.
We're not gonna be here
super long so get into that good
loving, I love you 
spa-like breath.
So you might be strapped for
time or in the middle of a
workday but it's amazing how we
can just bring our awareness to
our breath and kind 
of change our whole vibe.
And I know you know this so
thank you for allowing me to
just remind you 
and myself today.
Okay, without hitting anything
so try to control this move as
we release the fingertips down.
You're gonna grab opposite 
elbow with opposite hand.
And our last little ditty here
we're gonna rock back and forth.
Oh yeah! Bringing some 
love to the low back.
Some more love I should 
say to the low back.
Bend your knees.
Alright, one more cycle of
breath here before we roll it up
so make it a good breath.
Here we go.
Inhaling in.
Exhaling out.
Root to rise here, 
release your hands.
Slowly roll up to Mountain.
Go a lot slower than you think.
Surprise yourself.
(sighs) Mountain Pose.
Our last pose for today.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale, if you're feeling
adventurous and you trust the
people around you, 
(laughs) close your eyes.
Just kidding, close your 
eyes for just one moment.
And find just one 
last little moment
of stillness of inner peace.
Just kind of reclaiming your
power to move through your day
with ease and with grace.
Alright, open the eyes, 
bring the palms together.
Awesome! I love this.
Thank you so much for 
sharing your time with me.
Tell us how it went in the
comment section down below.

other office yoga,

Namaste.
