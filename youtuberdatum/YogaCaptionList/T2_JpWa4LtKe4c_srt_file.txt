- Hello everyone.
I'm Adriene and this is Benji
and we are so very excited to
announce our upcoming 
30-day yoga journey
and you are invited.

It is my honor and pleasure
to invite you to join us for
30 days of conscious breath
this coming January 2021.
Everyone's invited.
This is our seventh year to
go on a 30 day yoga journey as a
community and I am always just
completely honored and tickled
that I get to be
the humble yoga guide
for this incredible project.
A lot of heart and
soul has gone into the
making of this project.
And each year it's a
little different responding to,
you know, what I feel
like we need as a culture,
as a society and as a community.
So this year we're gonna
be focusing on the breath.
And I think there'll be a
little something for everyone.
One of my favorite parts of
the project is that there is an
element that brings more
context to the physical practice and
that is through a daily
email from yours truly.
So if you sign up here, 
YogaWithAdriene.com/Breath,
you'll receive a
daily email that coincides
with your practice.
Of course, everything is more
fun with friends and family and
we want to spread the love
and create this beautiful ripple
effect so invite
someone to join you.
This is a great way to have 
gentle, loving accountability.
Unless your friends
are really competitive,
that's your business.
But invite your
friends and family.
Once you sign up you'll also
get an opportunity to share a
graphic to lure
people to the mat and
share this experience with you.
Okay, last thing I want to
mention is our yoga actually
starts on January 2nd.
On January 1st you
have a welcome day.
Think of this as like your
orientation day where we can
take a couple of
group breaths, wink wink,
and set an intention
for the journey ahead.
So I look forward to
going on this ride with you.
30 days of conscious breath.
I'm really proud
of this project.
It's a bit different 
than years past.
It reads like a good book.
It's a bit of a slow burn.
So I look forward to
seeing you on the mat soon.
'Til then, take good care and
Namaste.
