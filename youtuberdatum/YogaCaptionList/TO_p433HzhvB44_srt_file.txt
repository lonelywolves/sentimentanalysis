- Hi everyone, 
welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and this is Benji
and today we have an 
awesome yoga for gut health,
so hop into something 
comfy and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Alright, my sweet friends,
let's begin seated in a nice,
cross-legged pose.
We call this the 
easy pose, Sukhasana,
but it's not necessarily 
to mean that it's easy,
so just come on 
down to the ground.
If you need to lift the hips up
or give yourself a little
pillow or something to sit on
to help you sit up 
tall versus rounding
and collapsed in the spine.
When we sit collapsed, 
our internal organs get
kind of smushed together, so
pause the video if you need to
and find something to sit on
so you can sit up nice and tall.
Find a little lift from within.
And then throughout regular
practice we'll find more ease
in the shape, alright?
Thanks for being here,
let's jump right in.
Sit up nice and tall.
Let your hands just gently rest
on the knees or thighs, 
wherever they fall naturally.
If you feel comfortable,
close your eyes here
as we just take a 
second to tune in.
Really utilizing and,
I'm gonna say it,
maximizing this time that
you've carved out for yourself.
So, with targeted practices 
we have to also remember
that with yoga we're 
working with an understanding
of a whole body and 
that's what we're trying to grow
is this whole body awareness,
that it's all connected 
and when we're talking
or considering gut health,
I think that's an 
important reminder.
Alright, if you haven't already,
begin to bring your 
attention to your breath.
Notice if you're 
holding in your belly.
See if you can soften there
and if you're 
holding any other place,
the jaw, the toes, even in
the hands or the shoulders,
start to soften and relax,
come into the present moment.
Right, it's all connected.
Then, together,
I'll invite us to 
take the deepest breath
you've taken all day.
Here we go, ready?
Big inhale.
And as you exhale, go 
ahead and release it out
through the mouth 
with a little ha sound.
Good, big inhale again.
Exhale, ha sound.
Relaxing the shoulders as you
breathe out, one more time.
Here we go, big inhale.
Lift your heart, 
sit up nice and tall.
And exhale, relax the 
shoulders as you breathe out.
Good, now bring 
your hands to your belly.
Inhale, breathe in.
This time as you breathe in,
think of this 
directional breath,
what we call directional breath.
Your inhale goes down,
you can feel your hands
actually move as you breathe in.
And exhale, soften, 
hands gently draw in,
slight retraction 
as you breathe out.
Twice more like that,
here we go. Big inhale.
Feel the belly expand,
heart lifts.
Exhale, navel gently 
retracts back to the spine.
And one more time, inhale.
And exhale.
Excellent.
Bring your 
fingertips to your sides,
plant the left 
palm to the earth.
Inhale, reach the 
right arm all the way up.
Big side body stretch.
If you feel collapsed 
in the belly, again,
maybe lift the hips.
We'll work to find 
that Upward Facing Dog
or Cobra sensation in the heart.
This lift through 
the chest up so we can
minimize the 
collapse in the belly
and then, when you're ready,
we're gonna take it 
all the way up and over
just past the 
front of your left knee.
So you're feeling a big stretch
in your lower right 
side of your back, sorry.
And we're feeling a massage
or a little compression 
in the left low belly.
If the fingertips come 
to the ground, let them.
If not, just 
reach, reach, reach.
Great, inhale in.
For your next exhale, 
draw the chin to the chest.
Good, inhale, just reverse,
come all the way back up.
And exhale, right 
fingertips to the earth.
Great, second side.
Right hand to the earth.
Inhale, first, come 
out of the left sideways
by reaching all the way up.
Left fingertips to the sky.
Inhale in. Exhale,
slowly take it up
and over just 
past your right knee,
so going on a diagonal line.
Creating space in 
the left low back.
Creating a little compression
in the right low belly 
and right oblique.
Maybe you stay reaching here,
maybe the fingertips 
come to the ground.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Alright, listen carefully.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale, chin to chest,
navel draws in, 
hug the low ribs in.
Sweet.
Slowly reverse it, 
come all the way back up,
left hand reaches all 
the way up towards the sky
and we come back down, 
fingertips to the earth.
Alright, we're gonna 
uncross the ankles here.
Just bring one foot 
in front of the other.
Let's unify, let's 
bring the left heel in
and then the right foot 
in front just for starters.
Then, here we go, 
big inhale, palms face up,
sweep up towards the sky,
lift from your waistline.
So creating a long sensation 
through the front body,
just kind of grounding
sensation through the back body.
Again, coming up 
out of our organs a bit,
finding that left 
from the pelvic floor.
Inhale in. Exhale, 
dial your heart space
towards your left knee.
So, twist to the left
and then we're gonna take it
down just like we did before.
But this time both fingertips
coming towards the ground.
Inhale to look forward, smile.
Exhale, chin to chest,
round through.
See if you can create a 
little hollow body here.
Navel draws in.
Cool.
Walk it through center,
get as low as you can.
No need to go as low as me,
but if you can get 
forearms to the ground, great.
Otherwise stay lifted.
You can even come 
forehead to the earth.
And then walk it all 
the way to the right.
Inhale to look forward, smile.
Exhale, chin to chest.
Inhale to bring it 
all the way back up.
Reach for the sky.
And exhale, fingertips float
down gently at your sides.
Good, let's switch.
Right heel comes in,
left leg out.
Here we go, big inhale,
reach for the sky.
Beautiful, exhale from center.
So, slowly twisting 
to the right from here.
Good, inhale in again.
Exhale over to your 
right nice and easy.
And just check it out,
breathing deep.
So really focusing on the
sensations today 
versus the shape.
Really, always in yoga, but
really today so we can start
to create more awareness.
Well, a deeper 
relationship with your guts.
So many metaphors there.
Okay, inhale, look forward.
Exhale, chin to chest.
Good, and then here we go,
walking through.
Coming through center, 
forearms, fingertips,
forehead to the mat, 
nice hip stretch here.
So breathe deep, 
breathe into your belly.
And then keep this train moving.
Let's go all the way 
over to the left, aw yeah.
Inhale, look forward,
open the chest.
Find extension.
Exhale, contract,
navel draws in, chin tucks.
Sweet, and then release 
by bringing fingertips all
the way up towards 
the sky, big breath in.
Exhale, fingertips float down.
Awesome work.
Alright, from here, we're
gonna slowly come to a seat.
So lean back on your bum.
Bring your 
knees up into the sky,
bring your hands 
behind your thighs.
Loop the shoulders,
lift your heart.
Inhale in, exhale, don't think, 
just breathe, lean back.
Toes can stay on the ground.
Inhale in.
Exhale, lift your heart.
Shoulders drop and one 
more time, big breath in.
Send that breath down 
into the belly, inhale.
Exhale, maybe the shins lift.
Good, try to keep 
your elbows hugging in.
So your shoulder blades 
can wrap down and around.
Down and around, yes.
Inhale in again.
Exhale, maybe you release the 
fingertips, palms face up.
Inhale in again.
You never know, exhale, maybe
you straighten the legs.
Lift your heart.
Armpit chest lifting here,
heart's lifting.
Elbow creases towards 
the sky for three, two.
On the one, slowly release.
Come through to all fours.
Knees underneath the hips,
wrists underneath the shoulders.
Just one Cat-Cow here, so drop
the belly, open the chest.
Exhale, round through 
the spine, chin to chest.
Good, cross one 
ankle over the other.
You're gonna paint 
your yoga mat with your mat
as you come back all 
the way through to a seat
and then all the 
way to your back.
And when you land on your back,
go ahead and center yourself
on your yoga 
mat if you have one.
And then I'll invite us all to
hug the knees into the chest.
So I'll meet you here.
You can take a 
couple breaths here
to rock gently side to side.
Little low back love here as
you scoop the tailbone up.
Keep your shoulders 
relaxed, elbows.
Lots of awareness and the elbows
drawing down perhaps here.
Little awareness in the feet.
Inhale in. Exhale, draw 
your nose towards your knees.
Doesn't matter if 
your nose comes close
to your knees at all.
Just find that intention,
so really squeezing, 
squeezing and squeezing.
Option to grab the outer edges
of the feet, 
keep breathing here.
And then when 
you're ready, slowly release.
Hold onto your right shin,
kick your left 
leg all the way out.
Inhale in deeply here.
Exhale, peel your nose 
up towards your right knee.
Keep breathing, strong 
left leg, flex your left toes.
Good, and then slowly release.
We're gonna switch, 
send the right leg out,
bring the left knee up,
inhale in.
Exhale, nose toward the knee.
Breathe here, strong right leg.
Shoulders relaxed, 
skin in the face soft.
Good, slowly release.
Switch, right leg comes back up.
Inhale in. Exhale, 
right knee crosses over
the left side of the body.
You can even shift 
your hips to the right side
of your mat as you 
come into this Supine Twist.
Send your right arm out long,
use the palm of your left hand
to gently comb the 
outer edge of your right thigh
that IT band all the way down.
The power of touch.
And maybe gently 
turn onto your right ear,
find that directional breath
here breathing 
down to the belly.
You gotta bring the breath,
you got this.
The more depth of breath you
can find in this practice,
the more benefits I think 
you're going to experience.
So think of it that way,
my darling.
When you're ready,
let's come back 
through to center and switch.
Take it to the other side,
extending the right leg out,
lifting the left 
knee up and taking it over
into your Supine Twist.
Again, option to 
bring the hips over towards
the left side of the mat.
Then we'll extend 
through the left arm.
Maybe you come onto 
your left ear, breathe deep.
Oh, my mid-back 
is a bit tight today.
And then use your right hand
to gently comb the outer
edge of your left thigh down.
Nice, deep, loving 
breaths here, you got this.
Notice how the 
breath, in particular,
the depth of breath,
notice how that can 
change your experience
and the way you 
feel in this shape.
Even just three deep breaths
can change it, change it all.
I can even hear my 
stomach talking in this shape.
It's working!
Okay, one more breath.
Come back to center,
hug both knees up
into the chest once again.
This time we're gonna 
take them wide, nice and wide.
Knees wide, squeezing, lifting,
breathing into the belly.
If you wanna take a 
Happy Baby here, you can.
Grab the outer edges of 
the feet or the inner arches,
kick the soles of the 
feet up towards the sky.
Deep breath in, long 
breath out as you reach
your tailbone towards 
the front edge of your mat.
Nice, and then slowly bring
the soles of the feet down
to the ground, 
hands come to the earth
to walk your heels up 
towards your sits bones.
Feet are nice and hip-width
apart, toes pointing forward.
Inhale to lift the 
hip points up high.
Breathe into the belly, crawl
the shoulder blades down
towards your heels and 
exhale slowly to lower.
Good.
From here, we're 
gonna walk the feet
as wide as the yoga mat,
knees come into touch,
soften through 
the bowl of the pelvis
and bring your 
hands to your belly.
Slow and steady clockwise
circles rubbing the belly nice
and slow, breathing deep.
If you have not caught a nice,
deep breath yet,
do it for yourself now.
And then stop, pause, 
relax everything here.
Knees are kissing 
towards each other,
elbows are relaxed on the
ground, shoulders are relaxed.
Close your eyes and just
listen, listen to your breath.
Learn to take more time
to listen to your guts,
your intuition.
It's all connected.
And then just pay attention,
notice what came up here.
There's no right or wrong.
We're gonna open the knees wide,
lift the heels, lift the feet.
Cross one ankle over the other,
grab the outer edges of 
the feet or your big toes.
We're gonna rock and 
roll up and down the length
of the spine here.
Should feel really good.
Come back up to that nice,
comfortable seat.
Voice cracked.
Hands on the knees,
we're gonna finish 
with a coffee grinder.
Here we go, inhale, 
smoothing the heart forward.
Exhale, round the spine,
send it back.
Inhale, forward.
Exhale, round the back,
getting the juices flowing here.
So, some of you 
may not know (laughs)
what those old-fashion 
coffee grinders look like,
but they look like this.
And you turn the 
handle and you grind
the coffee down below and then
you open the little drawer
and your coffee's there for you.
If you do know 
what I'm talking about,
awesome, if not, 
you can imagine it.
Reverse your circle.
Sync up with your breath.
Alright, let your 
circle get smaller
and smaller and smaller here.
Smaller and smaller and
smaller and smaller and smaller
and smaller until eventually
you are stacked head 
over heart, heart over pelvis.
Sweet, bring the palms together,
Anjuli Mudra at the heart.
Sit up nice and tall once again.
Inhale in deeply.
Nice, cleansing 
breath out through the mouth
as you relax the shoulders down.
Thank you so much 
for sharing your time
and your energy with me 
and with Benji here today.
I hope this 
practice serves you well.
Bookmark it, favorite it,
make a mental note.
Practice this regularly 
so we can keep you healthy
and happy and feeling good.
Love you guys, take good care.
Namaste.
(upbeat music)
