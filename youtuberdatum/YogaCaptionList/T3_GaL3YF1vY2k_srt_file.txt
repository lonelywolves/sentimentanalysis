- Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Breath,
your 30 day yoga journey.
I'm Adriene, this is
Benji and it's Day 2,
Arrive.
Let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Alrighty my friend,
welcome back.
Come into a nice,
comfortable seat.
Maybe lift the
hips up just a bit.
Come on down to the ground.
Take your time,
always, as we settle
into these practices.
It's a really good idea to focus
on your arrival from the get go.
So the practice
has already begun.
It doesn't begin in Downward Dog
or with your first ocean breath.
The invitation today is to
really see each time you come
to the mat as a new beginning,
and then within our practice
to really celebrate
and embrace this idea that
with each breath, we have
an opportunity to begin again,
to arrive in the present moment.
So, just a little
food for thought.
As we get settled in here,
let's bring our left hand
to the heart space and
right hand to the belly.
And if you like, 
close your eyes here or
gently bring your gaze down
diagonally past your nose.
Just kind of
softening your focus.
All of us arriving here today
to bring our attention inward.
So there may be a lot going on
outside of you and this mat,
the room or the area of the
earth that you're practicing in,
but within this practice 
and with the breath
we have this 
opportunity to go inward
and to create an 
abundance of awareness
for, or with rather, the
inner world versus 
the outer world.
So that's not necessarily
something that happens magically
the minute you
hop on your yoga mat.
So feel the warmth of
your hands on your chest
and your belly.
Close your eyes, 
soften your gaze.
And if you like, you can gently
tuck the chin into the chest
just lengthening through
the back of the neck a bit.
Creating a little reverent bow.
We're cuing the brain.
We're just kind
of slowing things down
as we arrive here today.
As you're ready, draw your
attention to your next breath.
And see if you can
make it a little longer.
Breathing in
through the nose and
out through the nose here,
observing the breath.
Spine is nice and tall.
Shoulders are relaxed.
As you continue to
gently deepen your breath,
I invite you to mark each breath
as a brand new arrival.
Each time you cycle
through to a new breath,
see if you can treat
it as a new arrival,
whatever that means for you.
You may notice
that it's difficult
to focus on your breath today.
You may
feel that you can just drop
in to a really yummy, 
conscious breath right away.
Know that each time 
you arrive it'll be different.
So we are 
continuing with a bit of
preparation and foundation
by simply honoring
the arrival with
each new breath.
And if this sounds kind of
crazy to you, just hang with me.
I have a feeling that this idea,
if it doesn't have a
place in your heart right now,
it might find a place here
throughout the practice 
or along the way.
Let's take a deep
breath in together now.
Inhaling in through the nose.
And exhaling out
through the nose.
And then slowly open
the eyes, release the palms
to rest gently on the tops
of the thighs or the knees.
And just take a second
to notice how you feel.
So we're gonna get moving here,
but I'll leave it to you 
to keep kind of chewing
on this idea of
marking each new inhale,
each new breath,
as a new arrival.
So it's going to feel different.
And through training
and through practice
we'll be able to follow the
breath through the whole cycle,
making it a full
conscious cycle of breath.
Okay, but we'll
unravel that together.
So nice and easy
dropping the chin to the chest.
And then taking the nose for
a couple of circles all the way
up and around and down.
Up and around and down.
So we're not doing big
eighties neck rolls here
unless you like, but
then you're responsible.
But rather thinking of the neck
as an extension of the spine.
And I like to use the
visual of the nose a lot,
go ahead and
reverse your circle,
because it helps me 
keep the neck integrated
in my postures.
So you'll hear me say,
"Push a little ball of yarn,"
or "Carve a line with the
nose forward and up and back."
Same thing here, drawing a
line one way and then the other.
And if you find a little
catch or a little place where
you feel like you want to work
it out, find what feels good.
Good, then we'll just
shake the head a little no.
Nice and slow.
Don't be saying 
no, no, no, no, no.
When it's really.
Now we'll nod the head yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Alright. And finally resting the
left ear over the left shoulder.
Just allow the weight
of your head to tilt here.
We'll take the right fingertips,
right hand over
towards the side,
fingertips are
gonna kiss the earth.
Inhale in.
Exhale, press your pinky down.
Good, then we'll lift the fingertips,
flex the right hand
as if you were pressing
your right hand into a wall.
And then we're gonna slowly
slide the right fingertips up
in line with the shoulder,
hoo, hoo, hoo,
and then all the way back
down in line with the hip.
That's a lot.
Keep breathing.
Inhale, slide the fingertips up.
And exhale in line with the hip.
Good, then let's let that go.
Shake it out if you need to.
And other side, 
right ear over right shoulder.
Breathing.
Left fingertips to the ground,
Press the left
pinky into the ground.
Just kind of opening up
through the armpit chest.
And then here we go.
Flexing the left hand.
And breathing,
breathing, breathing.
As we begin to
slide the left hand up
in line with the
left shoulder, woo.
Breathe and then
slowly lowering it down.
Getting into the
good stuff here.
Sliding it out.
And lowering it down.
And one more time.
Keep the fingers really
spread here on the left hand.
And lowering it down.
Excellent.
Bring the head over the heart,
heart over the pelvis.
Bring the palms to the knees.
Take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
Good, we'll take the hands,
we're gonna create
kind of an L-shape in both
hands here with the index finger
and thumb and we're
gonna bring that L-shape
to the rib cage here.
And then if you want, 
you can extend
your fingers so you can
kind of hold your rib cage here.
Now, careful, if there's a
lot of tension in the shoulders
you might already be stuck here.
So watch out for that.
We're gonna drop the shoulders.
Try to create a 
little bit of space here
in the neck and shoulders.
Alright, now with the hands 
here, use the hands here as
a guide as you inhale, find
that nice wide lateral breath.
So we're inhaling, feeling,
literally feeling 
the rib cage expand.
And exhale to 
soften and feel it
draw inward. Good.
Inhale, it draws out. 
It expands. Just play here.
And exhale, it softens in.
And one more time.
This is a workshop for you
so get in there.
Here we go.
Inhale, workshop
this wide lateral breath.
All four sides of
the torso, expanding,
getting big, big, big.
And then exhale, softening.
Beautiful.
Let's keep playing.
Let's keep exploring.
Let's come forward.
Arrive on all fours.
Each time we come into
a new beat, a new shape
of the physical
practice too, we have
an opportunity to
begin again, to greet it
and meet it and
find something new.
So here we go.
Spinal flexion, drop the belly,
inhale nice and slow.
Cow Pose.
And exhale, Cat Pose.
Rounding through chin to chest,
claw through the fingertips,
breathe out.
Good, inhale, drop the belly.
Lots of space between
the ears and shoulders.
press into the tops of the feet.
And exhale, smooth and steady
clawing through the fingertips.
Pressing through the toes.
Navel draws up, up, up.
One more time. Inhale.
Cow Pose.
Opening up through 
the front of the neck.
And exhale, really
exaggerate this one.
Claw through the fingertips,
draw the chin into the chest.
Press into the tops of the feet.
Lovely, inhale,
Tabletop Position, check it out.
You're gonna press
into both palms evenly.
We're gonna hug
the lower ribs in
so you have a slight
connection to your core.
Stay really
connected to your left foot.
We're gonna inhale,
curl the right toes under,
send it out, 
extend through that right leg.
And then without
dumping all of your weight
into the left side of the body,
lift your right heel,
your right leg up towards
the sky, keep your right toes,
especially that
pinky toe, dialed down.
Good, now open the toes
all the way to the right
so the arch of the foot
is facing towards the ground.
And then dial them back in.
And two more like that.
Peek at me, always,
if you need to.
We're gonna turn
the right toes out.
And then dial 'em back down.
And instead of just
focusing on the toes,
once you know kind
of what you're doing,
bring your attention 
to that hip socket,
that right hip socket opening.
And then rolling inward.
And this time
when you're rolling
inward go ahead and stay here.
We're waking up through the 
muscles of the legs, the glutes.
Building the glute muscle up here.
Soft bend in the elbows.
You're here for three, two.
On the one, lift your 
right heel a little bit higher.
And then exhale, bring 
everything in, nose to knee.
Rounding through the spine.
Squeeze and lift.
And then relax the right
knee back down and reset.
Arrive again,
nice neutral spine.
Alright, same thing 
on the other side.
So establish all fours, right?
Nice and steady.
Then try to maintain that.
Careful not to dump all
your weight into the right side
as you curl the left toes under,
send that left leg out.
Good, neck is
nice and long here.
Again, you can
peek at me anytime,
but we're not
dropping in the neck here.
We're keeping
that nice, beautiful
awareness from crown to tail.
Okay, inhale in as you're ready.
Exhale, hug onto the midline.
So stay centered here.
Pressing into your left palm 
as much as you are your right.
As we lift the left heel up,
dial the left toes
towards the ground.
Excellent, just
check it out here.
This is so important for
all of these standing poses.
Even the Warriors, man.
Not just balancing on one foot.
Finding your rib cage
and drawing it up and in.
Here we go, turning the toes now
towards the left, opening up.
And then dialing them back down.
And now opening it up. 
Nice and slow.
And dialing it back down.
We are building
strength everywhere here.
Opening it up, last one.
And dialing it back down.
Stay here.
Lift the left inner
thigh towards the sky.
Nice and steady here.
Working to level the hips.
Inhale in, lift the
left heel a little higher.
You're doing great!
Then exhale, slow and steady.
Bring it all in, knee to nose,
arching through the spine.
And then releasing it,
left knee to the ground.
Let's get you
off the wrists here.
Let's curl the toes,
under walk the hands back.
Sit back on the heels.
Slowly come all the way up.
Head over heart,
heart over pelvis.
You can interlace
the fingertips here
and then take it
for a little infinity.
So a little figure eight.
Good for the brain too.
Alright, release that.
A couple of circles
more if you need them.
And then we're gonna
come to Downward Facing Dog.
So take your time.
Spread the fingertips,
curl the toes under.
Follow your breath.
Inhale in.
Follow it through to the exhale.
Let that be what 
brings the hips up high
and back, head down.
Heart above the head here.
So you got to bring
the breath to really
bring the benefits of
this work is so amazing when
we allow our practice
to be led by the breath.
Wow, so healing.
And after you've taken
a couple of breaths here
in Downward Facing Dog,
go ahead and walk it
all the way up to
the front of the mat.
Nice and slow, nice and slow.
Feet hip width apart in
a standing Forward Fold.
Just take a couple breaths here
to notice how you feel today.
Maybe shake the head again,
a little yes, a little no.
Rock a little side to side.
And if you're coming 
with any stress (laughs)
or any tension, 
any worry, anxiety,
take a second here to hang
and maybe choose to allow
the weight that you're carrying
on your shoulders to
slip off just a bit here
and allow your next inhale truly
to be an arrival in
the present moment.
Then notice what that did.
For me, it was like 
I just released all
of this tightness 
in my low back.
Let's take one more breath here.
Sweet, then when you feel ready
to go ahead and roll it up,
nice and slow.
We'll meet in Mountain Pose.
And now here again, my darling,
you have an opportunity 
in Mountain Pose
with a new breath to
mark this a new arrival.
Notice how you feel.
Lift your heart.
Ground through your heels.
And let's move.
Inhale, reaching the
fingertips up towards the sky.
Exhale, bend the knees.
Float it down, soft fingers.
How about it?
Inhale, halfway lift,
follow your breath.
And then exhale,
soften and fold.
From here, bend the knees,
plant the palms,
step one foot back, 
then the other.
Benji's like
"Plank Pose, I'm out." (laughs)
"I'm up and out."
In Plank Pose, we're going 
to reach the heels back,
crown forward,
claw through the fingertips.
Feel free to drop the
knees here, but keep your core
engaged by hugging
the lower ribs in.
Everyone keep that
neck nice and long.
Inhale in here.
Exhale, slowly lower
all the way to the belly.
Follow your breath.
Inhale, lift it up.
Just a small Cobra here.
Exhale to release.
Inhale to all fours 
or Plank Pose.
Nice and strong.
And then exhale, empty it
all out, Downward Facing Dog.
Good. Press into
both palms evenly.
Anchor through the left heel.
Hug your low ribs in.
Inhale deeply as you
slowly slide the right leg
all the way up, right heel
up and dial the toes down.
So just once here, go
ahead and open to one side
so you can kind of
feel the hip stacking
and then dial it back down
so you can bring that right hip
and the right glute in line
with your left hip, left glute.
We're building strength.
You're doing great.
Inhale, lift the
right heel a little higher.
Exhale, bring it
all the way through.
Keep reaching the left
heel back, nose to knee here.
Upper body's in Plank. Awesome!
Then step the right
foot all the way up.
Lower the left knee down.
And on your next inhale,
sweep the arms
all the way forward,
up and back.
Big breath, big stretch.
Good, then exhale, 
paint a wall with the palms.
Just a little relief for
the wrists all the way down.
Good, pull the
right hip crease back.
Inhale to look forward.
Flex your right foot.
And then exhale,
bow the chin in towards
the chest, bow the head.
Then roll it
through nice and easy.
Plant the left palm.
We're gonna lift the
back knee, as we inhale,
reach the right
fingertips all the way up.
The new arrival here.
And then exhale 
all the way back down.
Plant the palms, 
step the right toes back,
Plank Pose or Half Plank.
Inhale in to shift forward, 
look forward.
This time nice and slow, exhale,
squeeze the elbows
into the side body
as long as possible as
you slowly lower down.
Good, inhale, Cobra.
Follow your breath.
Exhale, slowly bring 
the forehead down.
Inhale to all fours
or Plank, your choice.
And exhale, hips up high and
back in Downward Facing Dog.
So we're working to
take the pressure out
of the wrists here by really
rooting through the knuckles,
clawing through the
fingertips and then connecting
with that midline,
that core line,
that plumb line here,
even in a Downward Facing Dog.
Okay, anchor through
the right heel.
Inhale, lift the left leg
up nice and high.
Take a second here to open up,
stack the hips just
so you can feel that.
And then dial the
left toes back in,
working to level the hips.
This may be very
challenging and takes a lot
of integrity at first, but
through practice you'll find it.
And this
recognition of core and midline,
balancing the body,
will create a more
stable practice
for you to grow on.
Alright, here we go.
Inhale, lift the left heel.
Exhale, shift it forward.
Building strength, squeeze.
Right heel's reaching back.
Nose to knee here.
Lift, lift, lift.
And then step up
left foot all the way up.
Awesome work. 
Lower the right knee down.
On your next breath in,
follow the inhale.
Sweep the arms 
forward, up and back.
Front knee over front ankle.
Beautiful. 
Big breath, big stretch.
Lift your heart.
Open up and then exhale.
Paint a wall
here with your palms.
A little relief for the wrists
as you slowly
come all the way back.
Gorgeous.
Pull the left hip crease back.
Flex the left toes,
towards the face.
Inhale, catch a 
little wave with the breath.
Look forward.
Exhale, bow inward.
Good, roll through the
left heel nice and slow.
Then we're gonna try to
do these two things at once.
Right hand on the earth
as we lift the left knee,
the left fingertips go all
the way up towards the sky.
Big twist. Inhale in.
Breathe into all 
four sides of the torso.
So good for you.
And exhale, 
slowly bring it back down.
Plant the palms.
Step the left toes back.
Inhale in here in Plank.
And so with each inhale,
we mark a new arrival.
Give your thinking mind a
break and use that inhale
as an opportunity to
enter the present moment.
Just one present
moment after the other.
We're building strength here.
We're gonna be here
for 30 more seconds
and then we're gonna come
onto our backs and relax.
So you can stay here or
for this last 15 seconds
we might do some
mindful Mountain climbers.
So just nice, slow pace here.
Of course, you can
always speed it up
if you're craving
fire on any given day.
Nice, slow climbing.
Hugging the knee into the chest
but we're not bringing
the nose to knee on these.
We're keeping the
neck nice and long.
Keep it going.
Could just be in a Half Plank
with the knees on the ground
or nice steady Plank
taking breaks when you need to.
You're doing great.
Alright, even it out.
And release,
bring the knees down.
Swing the legs
to one side, any side.
Come all the way
through to a seat.
Alright, we're gonna
set our legs out in front.
If you want to grab
your blanket to lift
the hips up here,
this would be a good time.
Feet are hip width apart.
Flex the feet,
bend the knees slightly.
Inhale, reach the
fingertips behind the ears
and then all the
way up towards the sky.
And then exhale,
think up and over.
So draw your navel in and up.
We call this Uddiyana Bandha.
In and up as you 
slowly reach towards
the shins, the ankles
or maybe the feet or toes.
Then inhale to look 
forward wherever you are.
And exhale to fold in.
Maybe work to straighten 
the legs in time. Maybe not.
Close your eyes and 
yep, you guessed it.
Arrive with a new breath.
Take three cycles of
breath here and see again
if you can mark each cycle anew.
So you follow,
you're training your brain
to follow through with
the breath consciously.
To the next breath
and to the next breath.
Relaxing the
weight of the head over.
And then slowly releasing,
drawing the chin
to the chest and
rolling back up.
Awesome work.
So following the breath through,
it seems so simple,
but can actually be quite
difficult to follow through.
So we'll be introducing
some like breath ratio
later on that will
help you practice that.
But just to get an idea,
treat each new
breath as a new arrival.
It reminds me of that beautiful
poem by Rumi, "The Guest House".
Okay, so here we go.
Let's come onto our backs.
Right away, hug the
knees into the chest.
Rock a little side to side.
And then continuing
with a little balancing
of left and right
side of the body,
let's extend the left
leg out as you maintain
the hugging in of 
the right knee. (chuckles)
I just had to center
myself a little bit on my mat.
And then inhale in. 
Exhale, contract the navel
in towards the spine as
you slowly peel the head up.
Now the nose can come toward
the knee, but it's really,
it's not about kind
of reaching that goal.
It's about giving the
spine that love here,
the space, engaging the core.
If you want to
challenge yourself, you can lift
the left heel, 
let it hover just a bit.
Shoulders are relaxed.
Skin of the face is relaxed.
My feet are engaged.
Ooh yeah, waking up those
little intercostals, especially
in the low belly as 
I lift my left heel.
Scooping, finding that 
kind of hollow front body.
And inhaling in here and
then exhaling to release.
Listen carefully, I'm gonna 
take this right knee
and I'm gonna cross
this baby all the way over
towards the left side,
move my hips to the right side
so I can accentuate that,
and then hallelu,
I'm gonna send
my right fingertips
all the way out and
maybe turn on my right ear
so that I can take
my next brand new,
beautiful breath here in
this supine twist.
Nice Reclined Twist.
Breathe into your belly.
Take one more enjoyable breath.
Big stretch here in 
the right armpit chest.
And the right pec.
And then slowly
follow your exhale.
Bring it back.
Center yourself on the mat,
hug both knees into the chest.
And then maintain the
squeezing in of the left knee
as you extend the
right leg out along.
Keep the shoulders relaxed.
Inhale in. Exhale,
sharp exhale to really feel
that connection maybe
of the navel drawing in.
We'll work on this more later,
but just connecting 
that contraction,
and that's what brings the
nose up towards the left knee.
Again, it doesn't have to touch.
Just creating more 
length in the spine.
Thoracic spine and 
the upper back as well.
Breathing here,
shoulders relaxed.
Option to lift the
right heel, let it hover.
When you do, 
find that hollow body.
Feel the low belly
get engaged here.
We're breathing steadily.
Nice. And then slowly release
right heel to the ground.
Head comes down and we're
gonna guide the right knee now
over towards the right.
I might shift my hips over
towards the left and
find my twist on either side,
extending the
left fingertips out.
And maybe turning
onto the left ear here.
Close your eyes.
Soften through your jaw.
And breathe, breathe, breathe.
Noticing the sensation 
with each inhale.
And each exhale.
So much opportunity.
So much opportunity 
with each inhalation,
with each exhalation. 
You start to
get really fascinated and curious
about all that you
can discover within
the cycle of a breath
in your yoga practice.
Take one more delicious,
yummy breath in. (chuckles)
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.
Certainly evokes a feeling,
and then exhale.
Let it guide you back.
Alright, check it out.
Center yourself on the mat.
And then you're gonna hug
the knees up to the chest
but you're gonna bring
the palms to the kneecaps.
And then we're
gonna open them wide.
And then we're gonna
bring them in and around
and then squeeze 'em in.
Open 'em wide
and around and in.
And then reverse the circle out.
Just neutralizing the spine
a little bit. Around and in.
Careful not to
clench the jaw here.
Out, around and in.
And one more time.
Awesome. Then flex the feet.
Point the toes and 
then relax the feet.
And allow them to
drop down to the earth.
Good, extend one leg.
And then the other.
You can use your
blanket or your towel here.
I don't think I mentioned
this yesterday, but you can
always use your blanket
underneath the knees here.
Kind of nice for the low back.
Give you a little
prop for relaxation.
And we're gonna allow
the hands to rest gently,
palms face up here as we
close out today's practice.
Take a second 
to notice how you feel.
And close your eyes.
And just let the breath
return to its natural rhythm.
So you can remain
aware of the rhythm,
but there's this allowing, 
just kind of allowing,
the breath to
flow here naturally.
Relaxing the weight
of your body completely
and fully into the
earth and giving thanks
for this time that you've 
carved out for yourself to
connect with your body.
Honoring your breath.
And embrace this idea that
with each new breath we arrive.
Take one more moment
here to rest your heart.
And then inhale deeply with me.
And as you exhale, 
sigh it out, just a little ahh.
Again, inhale deeply all of
us together around the world.
What's up?
The exhale to sigh it out, ahh.
Good, lift one knee.
Then the other.
We'll turn into 
one side and really
come into a fetal position.
Really hike those knees 
up towards your heart.
Rest your head.
And take a second
to just contemplate,
meditate, today's theme.
I hope that you can
take this invitation,
and today's focus with
you off the mat into the rest
of your day or night, and
we'll definitely bring it back
into play for
tomorrow's practice.
Knowing that the
hardest part is showing up.
So really celebrating,
committing to the arrival.
Feels good.
Press into one palm 
and then the other.
We'll rise back up.
We'll bring the palms together
at the heart space to
close out the practice.
So each practice
will be very different.
No doubt, almost
every time you consider
showing up on the mat,
you might have a moment
where you think
you may not show up.
So remember that that is
sometimes the hardest part.
And we can remember all we have
to do is breathe
in these practices.
So arrive,
show up and
then see what happens.
The rest will just unfold
but you have to arrive 
with each new breath.
Thank you so much for
sharing your time and energy
with me and with
everyone who's practicing
BREATH.
Inhale in deeply.
And exhale to bow the head.
We'll finish by whispering
Namaste.
(bright upbeat piano music)
