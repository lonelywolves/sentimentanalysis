- Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 27.
Integrate.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Okie doke, my friends,
let's begin in either a nice,
comfortable seat of your choice
or Extended Child's Pose.
Come on down to the ground.
Benji, you pick your number one
position to start in as well.
And together we will begin.
I love daily yoga practice
because it's just such a
wonderful little ritual
to begin again.
So as you get settled in here,
allow yourself
to let go of the day thus far
and politely put whatever you 
have to do after this practice
politely put it on hold.
Place it on the shelf.
Then use this time.
Really take it
to integrate a 
little more awareness
into your life.
That's it, right?
You don't have to do anything.
You don't have to 
make anything happen.
Just a willingness to 
integrate more awareness.
And then, of course 
there's a ripple effect.
But for now, just a 
willingness to begin again
and integrate more awareness.
As you're ready, gently 
begin to deepen the breath.
Maybe you have 
already started this process.
And then if you're seated,
you might find a 
gentle sway back and forth.
And if you're an 
Extended Child's Pose,
you might begin to 
rock the forehead gently
side to side on the mat.
Today's session 
invites you to consider
what it means to move well.
Showing up on the 
mat regularly offering,
of course, us this insanely
wonderful opportunity to
learn about our bodies, 
integrate the breath
and essentially move better.
To become a good mover.
To move well.
Bring the head back 
to center stillness.
Find stillness wherever you
are, take a deep breath in.
And use your exhale 
to slowly open the eyes.
We're gonna come up to 
a nice Tabletop Position.
Then when you're ready, 
claw through the fingertips,
curl the toes under, inhale in.
Exhale, lift the knees 
and let them hover.
Breathing deep, finding a 
little calm here as you draw
the navel up towards the spine.
Low back is long, 
so not dipping down.
Long, long, long.
Low belly's drawing up and in.
Gonna be here a little
longer today, you got it.
For ten, what?
Nine, breathe deep.
Eight, seven, six,
five, four, three,
two, one.
Lower the knees down.
Press into the tops of the feet.
Inhale, drop the belly.
Exhale, round through the spine.
Inhale, drop the belly.
And exhale, round 
through the spine.
Now take a couple rounds just on
your own and think of the body
as one complete moving part
versus a bunch of units here.
See if that changes the
quality of your movement here.
Does for me.
It kind of slows me down.
Excellent, then walk your 
hands all the way forward.
Walk your knees back.
Inhale in, peek 
at me if you need to.
You're just 
going to slowly ease,
ease, ease the hips down.
Cobra.
Inhale in here again.
Exhale, lower all 
the way to the belly.
Heart to earth.
Alright, we're gonna 
bend the left knee.
Send your left fingertips
behind to grab the left ankle.
Inhale in here.
Exhale, draw your left heel in.
Release.
Reach the right hand 
to grab the right ankle.
Inhale in.
Exhale, squeeze the 
right heel towards your bum.
Release, palms come 
underneath the shoulders,
inhale in, exhale, 
press back up to all fours.
Tabletop Position.
Good, curl the 
toes under once again.
Here we go, 
Hovering Table, deep breath.
Exhale, lift the knees,
let them hover.
So imagine 
placing a little teacup
on the back of the neck here.
So the neck is nice and long.
We're pressing 
into the knuckles.
Upper arm bones rotating out.
We feel that low belly 
drawing up and in for ten,
nine, eight, breathe deep.
Seven, six, five,
four, three, two
and on the one, lower the knees.
Awesome, walk the knees back.
Walk the hands forward.
Come on to the tops of 
the feet and nice and easy,
ease your way back down.
Hips to the earth, 
belly to the earth.
We come to Cobra.
Inhale.
Soft and easy.
Exhale, forehead to the mat.
Great. From here, 
we're gonna walk the
fingertips off 
the mat just a bit.
And think about 
not just the shape
but the sensation 
that you create
as you move in 
and out of the shapes.
So we're gonna move through 
a little King Cobra here,
press into the tops of the feet.
Inhale in, press into
the fingertips, rise up.
Remember how you 
move matters here.
And then exhale,
soften forehead 
toward the earth.
Inhale, we rise.
Just play.
And exhale, soften.
And one more.
These can be really small, guys.
Inhale, rise up.
And soften.
Draw the hands 
underneath the shoulders,
curl the toes under.
Your choice, inhale in, 
exhale, press up to all fours
or now maybe Plank Pose.
Good.
When you're ready, send 
the hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Take a couple breaths 
here to move your body.
Bump the hips left to right.
Press into the palms evenly.
Shake the head loose.
Then from center, 
navel draws in and up,
anchor your left heel down
and this is the cue to 
lift the right leg up high.
Again, one moving part.
Bend your right knee.
Stack your right 
hip over the left.
Big breath in.
Exhale, right knee to
right elbow, shift forward.
Inhale, kick it up,
Three-Legged Dog.
Level in the hips.
Exhale, right 
knee to left elbow.
Shift forward.
Inhale, kick it up.
Exhale, right through center,
squeeze and lift.
Right knee all the 
way up to the heart space.
And then Downward Facing Dog.
Right away, inhale, 
left leg lifts up high.
You got this.
Exhale, bend the left knee,
stack the left hip 
over the right.
Beautiful.
Inhale in.
Exhale, connect.
Integrate center here as you
bring left knee all the way up
and over to kiss the left elbow.
Upper body's in Plank.
Good, inhale, kick it up,
Three-Legged Dog.
Hips are level.
Exhale, cross it over.
Left elbow kisses right knee.
Good, inhale, claw 
through the fingertips,
kick it back up.
Exhale's right through center.
Squeeze and lift.
Good, inhale, kick it up.
Exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
Stay here or 
slowly lower to the knees.
Take a rest, Child's Pose.
We'll be here for three breaths.
In and out, 
in and out, in and out.
So you choose the 
resting posture here,
either Downward Dog
or Child's Pose.
And then if 
you're an Child's Pose,
make your way to 
Downward Facing Dog.
And then together 
we'll bend the knees,
inhale to look forward and
exhale to step or hop 
your way to the top.
Take a second here 
to let everything go.
Let go of any stress, tension.
When you're ready,
bend the knees,
tuck the chin and 
slowly roll it up.
Tadasana, Mountain Pose.
So many wonderful things to
practice integrating here.
Go for it.
Let's see what you come up with.
Nice.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale, drop the shoulders down.
Pressing into all four corners
of the feet we're gonna grab the
left wrist with the right hand,

Move from middle.
Good, hang on to your center.
As you inhale, 
lift the right leg up high.
Exhale, squeeze that right knee
all the way up and in and then
step it up to a nice, low lunge.
Here we go, high lunge.
Inhale, reaching for the sky.
Front knee stays bent.
You can bend that back knee to
get your center underneath you.
Squeeze the inner thighs 
to the midline for stability.
Again, just a little reminder,
we can always lower 
that back to the ground.
We've been here before.
The ground is there for us.
Here we go.
Inhale to straighten both legs.
Exhale, bend that front knee,
twist to the right.
Inhale all the way back up,
straighten both legs.
Exhale, open up, Warrior II.
Good, inhale, 
straighten both legs.
Reach the right fingertips back.
Exhale, cartwheel 
all the way back down.
We're gonna pivot, plant the
left palm and reach the right
fingertips all the 
way up towards the sky
for your big twist.
Inhale in here.
Exhale, right fingertips down.
Here we go.
Step the right foot back.
Belly to Cobra or 
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Moving with your breath.
Mirroring the 
breath to the movement,
the movement to the breath.
I'll meet you in 
Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale in here.
And exhale to empty it out.
Good, inhale lift 
the left leg up high.
Claw through the fingertips.

Open it out, Warrior II.
Strong footing.
Strong legs.
Now inhale, reach it 
forward, straighten both legs.
Reach it all 
the way up and back.
Big stretch, big breath.
Then exhale, 
bend that front knee.
Cartwheel it all way down.
Take up space.
Right hand 
comes to the earth
and when you're ready, 
big twist.
Left fingertips all 
the way up to the sky.
Nice. Slowly bring it back 
down to frame the left foot.
When you're ready,
plant the palms,
step it back and 
move through a vinyasa.
So move with intention that
can be straight to Downward Dog.
Could be through a 
little Child's Pose.
When you're back in 
Downward Facing Dog,
take a deep breath in.
And a Lion's Breath, tongue out.
Let go of some heat.
Good, bend the knees.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale to step 
or hop to the top.

Nice flat back position,
your version.
Try to find something 
new each time.
Then exhale to soften and fold.
Great, root to rise here,
inhale, reach for the sky.
Big breath, big stretch.
And then exhale, 
hands come together
and right back 
down to the heart.
Pause. Capture a bit of 
your own magic here, breathe.
Notice.
Awesome, soft bend in the knees.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
This time exhale, 
we're gonna slowly,
slowly, slowly grab the
right wrist with the left hand.
Soft bend in the knees.
You're gonna bend your right
knee and you're going to trace
your right toes 
all the way behind you,
a small semicircle towards 
the left edge of your mat.
Then stay grounded 
through your right toes.
You can even ground to the right
heel as we find this side body
stretch here on the right side.
Big breath in.
Peek at me if you need to.
Long breath out.
Good, inhale to come 
all the way back to center.
Fingertips reaching all the
way up and we'll switch it,
take it to the other side.
Right hand grabs the left wrist.
We lift the left heel, 
soft bend in the knees,
and then drawing a 
semicircle behind you,
tracing your 
left toes in the sand.
You can keep your right heel
lifted here or ground through,
sorry, you can keep 
your left heel lifted here,
or you can ground 
through your left foot.
Inhale in.
Exhale, relax your shoulders.
Inhale to come back to center.
And exhale to release the bind.
Awesome. One more big breath 
in as you reach for the sky.
Maybe you come up 
onto the toes here.
What? And then exhale, 
cascade it all the way down,
Forward Fold.
Let it go. Let it go.
Cool, inhale, halfway lift here.
Find length in the neck, tug the
shoulders away from the ears.
Good, exhale, soften and bow.
This time bend the knees,
plant the palms step or 
maybe you hop it back today.
Hopping it back to Plank.
Lowering belly to Cobra 
or Chaturanga to Up Dog.
Building strength mindfully.
Make your way to 
Downward Facing Dog.
You're doing great.
Inhale, lift the 
right leg up high.
Exhale, shift forward.
Step it all the way up.
Listen carefully. We're 
gonna pivot on the back foot.
You're gonna take your
right hand to your right heel
and we're gonna take the left
fingertips and cross 'em all the
way across the body coming
into Triangle from the ground up
today, from the ground up.
Just check it out.
Back toes are turned in.
We spiral the 
heart up towards the sky.
You might take your left hand
to your right rib cage and just
imagine smearing a little bit of
honey across the ribs here all
the way opening up to the sky.
Inhale in.
Exhale, send your gaze down.
Bring your left fingertips down.
We're gonna move 
into a Pyramid posture
by stepping the back foot up.
Great, inhale in, 
stick with your breath.
Remember, the 
breath always comes first.
And then inhale 
in again, exhale,
use that contraction 
navel to spine to
maybe lift the left leg up,
standing splits again today.
Just a test.
Just checking in.
Not gonna be here long.
Just checking in.
You got it.
Inhale in deeply.
Exhale to let it all go.
You're gonna kick 
the left foot back,
come to a nice 
low lunge, regroup.
Good, here we go.
Inhale to open the chest.
Maybe the palms come up today, 
Anjuli Mudra, look forward.
And exhale to plant.
Go straight to Downward Dog here
or move through a little flow.
You got it.
In Downward Dog, here we go,
big cleansing breath.
Take a nice inhale 
in through the nostrils.
And exhale, stick your
tongue out, Lion's Breath.
Hey, you never know, 
little Lion's Breath
could change everything.
Inhale, lift the 
left leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward,
strong and centered.
Step it all the way up.
Here we go. Pivoting on 
the back foot, from here,
straighten the front leg.
Take your time here, no rush.
Left fingertips come 
around to the left heel.
And once you feel like you have
your foundation right fingertips
trace across the left arm,
across the chest and all the way
up towards the sky,
Triangle Pose.
Take the right 
hand of the low ribs,
if you liked that on the 
right side let's do it here.
Smearing this honey from the
bottom rib all 
the way to the top.
Opening your heart 
up towards the sky.
Strong legs.
Inhale in.
Exhale, send your gaze down.
Slowly, right 
fingertips will come down.
We're gonna move 
through that Pyramid posture,
so step your right 
foot in just a bit.
Breathe deep.
Stay focused.
You have the tools.
It's challenging for a reason.
Stay connected.
Here we go.
Lifting up maybe 
just the right heel.
Maybe the big toe 
stays on the ground.
Maybe the right leg 
begins to come all the way up.
Maybe right toes dialing down.
So you can think about lifting
from your right inner thigh.
Just playing here.
Checking in day by day.
Small loving 
integration each day
to make big, big change.
Inhale in.
Wherever you are, exhale, 
kick that right foot back.
Regroup, find 
your nice low lunge.
And here we go, 
inhale, get light.
Palms maybe come together here
as you look forward, lift up.
And exhale to release.
Last call for vinyasa.
Take it or leave it.
Step it back, belly to Cobra,
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
One final Downward Dog.
When you get there, 
inhale lots of love in.
Exhale, Lion's Breath,
tongue out.
(laughs) Benji was
stirred by that Lion's Breath.
Slow descent of 
the knees to the earth.
Then gently 
walk your knees back.
Slowly walk your hands forward
and you can find a little sway
in the hips here as you slowly
lower the hips to the earth.
We're gonna come into a 
Cobra once again, nice and easy.
Bend your elbows.
You got this.
Find soft sway.
And then slowly 
releasing forehead to the earth.
Okay, reach the 
fingertips forward.
Both hands (chuckles).
And we're gonna 
have a little fun here.
We're gonna zip the legs up.
So walk inner thighs together,
and then you choose,
left or right side, 
but you're gonna do
like a little 
Martha Graham move here.
You're just gonna turn to one
side and then you're going to
keep turning over to 
come on to your back.
And you're gonna have to
recenter yourself on the mat.
And then just use the sound
of my voice to guide you here.
Once you're 
centered on the mat,
hug your knees 
up into the chest.
Give yourself a nice big hug.
Feel that low back get long.
You can close your eyes here.
Claw, not claw, 
crawl your shoulder blades
in together and down again.
I love that image of a bear
massaging its back on a tree.
Then hold onto your right knee,
send your left leg out but let
your left heel hover just above
the earth and feel your center
turn on, that integration.
That little fire in the belly,
that connection.
And then just switch left,
knee comes in,
right leg goes out 
and right heel hovers.
Feel it.
And then switch.
And then switch.
And then switch.
Last time, switch.
Good, extend both legs out.
You can tick-tock the 
toes in and out a little bit.
Shake it out through the legs.
Claw the shoulder blades down,
excuse me, Benji.
And let your hands rest gently
at your sides 
or you can hold your
dog's hand if he lets you.
Alright, you can 
close your eyes here.
We're gonna just take a
moment here to find stillness.
Let the nutrients of our
practice really integrate,
settle in
the body.
Not the body but 
your body, my body,
our bodies are so magnificent.
So just allowing.
Even if it's just for a
moment, a bit of stillness for
everything to come together.
Do its thing.
Take a deep breath in.
Use this exhale to relax the
weight of your body completely
and fully into the earth.
Let your breath 
be soft and easy.
And then, as you're willing
just welcome a bit of gratitude
for this practice
and your willingness 
to show up and
integrate, connect.
Draw a line between
the mind,
the body
and your heart.
For me, 
it's about telling a story.
And those are the 
characters so we show up
and write each 
chapter or each page
or each sentence 
each day by integrating
those three things.
Mind, body, heart.
You can also think of 
it as mind, body and breath.
Maybe that's more 
practical tool for you.
As you're ready, slowly 
bring the palms together.
Thumbs up to third eye 
and we'll seal this practice
with one final 
breath in together, inhale.
Great job today, everyone.
Exhale (sighs).
And whisper
Namaste.
Look forward to 
seeing you tomorrow.
(upbeat gentle music)
