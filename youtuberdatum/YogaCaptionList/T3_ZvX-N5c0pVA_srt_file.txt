- Hello everyone.
Welcome to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 28,
Trust.
Do you trust me?
Let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Let's begin today's practice
in a nice, comfortable seat.
Thank you so
much for being here.
Benji's gonna
find his seat as well.
Alright.
Take a second. 
Get settled in.
Relax your shoulders.
Get comfortable.
And when you're ready,
bring the hands together.
Anjali Mudra.
Prayer position.
Hands at the heart.
You can close your eyes here.
Gently tuck the chin, 
find a gentle reverent bow here
as you start to drop in
to this moment.
And bring your
awareness to your breath.
And as we bring our
awareness to the breath,
of course, we probably have
noticed throughout this journey
along the way that simply
by bringing our attention
and our awareness
to it, it shifts.
So you may start to
elongate your inhalations.
Lengthen your exhalation.
Taking this time 
to gently deepen
the breath.
And ultimately,
sweeten and
deepen your relationship
with your conscious breath.
Take one more moment
here, just listening.
And responding.
Listening and responding.
Now slowly release the
hands to the tops of the thighs
and drop the head down a
little more, chin to chest.
So full bow of the head
as you draw the
shoulder blades together.
Then just start to slowly
rock the head from side to side,
a little gentle tick-tock.
Elbows heavy here as 
you stretch through the
trapezius.
And then bring the
head up, open the eyes.
Take a deep breath
in through the nose.
And out through the mouth.
In through the nose.
And out through the mouth.
And this time sealing lips. 
In through the nose.
Long, exhale out
through the nose.
Beautiful, slow and
steady coming to all fours.
Using the breath in
the transitions here
and moving into Cat-Cow
whenever you're ready.
Using that inhale to
really open the chest,
press into the tops of the feet.
And exhale to
round through the spine.
Now, take it away here.
Find what feels good.
Don't decide where it
ends and trust yourself.
Trust your intuition.
So we create this practice
of listening and responding,
but ultimately, 
what are we listening to?
Cues from Adriene, 
or cues from the teacher,
or is there another layer
of the onion we can peel back?
Snuggling up, 
getting a little bit closer to
our hidden truth.
Now that's interesting.
Come to a nice
Tabletop Position
and make your
way to Downward Dog.
Listen to your body.
You can trust your intuition.
Stretch it out.
Any thoughts that
are coming through,
things that like distractions,
items on the to-do list.
Give yourself permission to
be here now in the present.
Use the anchor of
your breath, of course,
to keep returning to the moment.
One present moment is
kind of a window to the next,
and we get to
practice that on the mat.
Love it so much.
I'm so grateful
for this practice.
Let's walk to the
top nice and slow.
Feet hip width apart
or flushed together.
Forward fold.
Couple breaths here. Listen.
You can take the
hands underneath the feet
as we've introduced.
We can clasp opposite
elbow with opposite hand
and rock a little side to side.
We can find
exquisite stillness here
allowing the breath
to be what moves us.
Trust that whatever you're
coming to the mat with today
is A-okay.
Maybe embracing the mantra,
"Everything is as it should be."
Everything is as it should be.
And what if that were true?
Shake the head a
little yes gently,
and no gently.
And then when you're ready,
bend those knees,
ground through the feet,
and let's slowly
roll up to standing.
As you arrive in Mountain today,
go through a
little full body scan,
starting at the feet.
And just give
yourself an opportunity
to see what you can find,
something new maybe.
And just trust that process.
You don't have to like
necessarily do anything big.
It can be a subtle connection
or a subtle discovery,
small discovery.
Gently lifting up
through the heart space.
Practicing that
balance that dance between
softening and engaging,
Surrendering and staying active,
this strength and grace,
effort and ease.
And we'll keep
this practice going.
As we inhale
reach the fingertips
all the way up and overhead.
Exhale, bend the elbows,
lift the chest.
Inhale, reach to the sky again.
Exhale, Forward Fold 
all the way down.
Follow your breath.
Inhale, we lift up halfway,
gaze straight down
or slightly ahead.
Lots of length in
the back of the neck.
And exhale, soften and bow.
Good, root to rise.
Bring it back up.
Inhale to reach for the sky.
And exhale, hands to heart.
Close your eyes.
Take a deep breath in.
Strong connection to
the breath and body here
as you breathe out.
And then fingertips
go down to come up.
Big breath, big stretch,
reach for the sky.
Draw the
shoulder blades together,
bend the elbows as you exhale,
thumbs back, pinkies forward,
lift your heart.
Good, inhale, reach it back up.
And exhale, Forward Fold all
the way down, nice and easy.
Inhale, lift up halfway,
long neck.

Good, inhale rise back up.
Fingertips reach.
And exhale, slow and steady,
come back to
your nice low lunge.
From here lift the back knee.
Step the right foot back.
Inhale to look forward,
shift forward.
Exhale all the way
down to your belly.
Plant the hands.
So you can draw the hands
in line with the rib cage.
Maybe you play with bringing
the fingertips off the mat.
Follow your breath.
Inhale, rise up, Cobra.
Take it easy to start.
And then exhale,
soften and fold back down.
Curl the toes under, inhale in.
Exhale, Plank Pose.
So navel draws up to
the spine as you rise up.
Inhale in again.
Exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
Take a couple breaths here.
Claw through the fingertips.
Soften through
the skin of the face.
Alright, from here,
nice and easy,
step the left foot all
the way up into your lunge,
lower the right knee down.
On your next breath in,
sweep the fingertips
forward, up and back.
Exhale, bend the elbows,
navel draws in and up.
Thumbs back, pinkies forward.
Good, inhale,
reach for the sky again.
And exhale, slow and steady,
bring it back down to the earth.
Lift the back knee.
Step the left
toes back, Plank Pose.
Inhale in deeply.
Exhale, slowly
lower to the belly.
Inhale, lift up Cobra.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Curl the toes under,
press up to all fours or Plank.
And then send it up and
back Downward Facing Dog.
So nice
refreshing breaths in here.
Start to lean in.
Focus on the
sound of your breath.
Trust that you are exactly
where you were supposed to be.
If you need to take
breaks at any time, own it.
Right, use it.
Keep breathing.
When you're ready,
bend the knees generously.
Send the hip creases
up towards the sky.
Really reach 'em up.
Then carve a line with the nose 
and look forward, inhale.
Exhale, make your 
way to the top.
Big inhale lifts you up halfway.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Root to rise here.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
And exhale, hands to heart.
Close your eyes.
Observe the breath.
Notice how you feel.
Then soft bend in the knees here.
Fingertips, go down.
Here we go, inhale, reach it up.
Big breath, big gesture,
big stretch.
Good, exhale, 
Forward Fold all the way down.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Step the left foot back.
This time back knee
lowered or lifted, your choice.
We inhale, fingertips sweep
all the way up towards the sky.
Good, exhale,
bend the elbows again.
Lift the chest, heart up 
towards the heavens.
Good, inhale reach,
head over heart,
heart over pelvis again.
Then exhale, we come
all the way back down.
On your next inhale,
we twist right fingertips 
up towards the sky.
And exhale, bring it back down.
Beautiful.
Plant the palms, 
step the right foot back.
Inhale, shift forward,
look forward.
Exhale, belly to Cobra or
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Use your inhale
to open your heart.
And use your exhale, 
that contraction of the navel,
to slowly make your way
back to Downward Facing Dog.
Good, on your next inhale
gently step the left
foot all the way up.
Back knee lowered 
or lifted, your choice.
Inhale, sweep the fingertips
all the way up
towards the heavens.
Exhale, bend the elbows
as you lift your
sternum up towards the sky.
Good, inhale, 
tuck the chin slightly.
Reach back up, Crescent
Lunge or High Lunge rather.
And then exhale, slow and
steady all the way back down
into your twist.
Inhale, left fingertips
up towards the sky, stretch.
And exhale, slow and
steady left hand to the earth.
Step the left toes back here.
Plank Pose.
Find a softness here if you can.
Just trust a little
improvised movement here
as you maybe shift the
hips a little left to right.
So we're not doing
those hip dips again.
This is something else.
Just see what happens.
And if you find that
it's in your repertoire today
to maybe turn
onto the outer edges,
inner arch of the
foot like we did before,
you might give it a try.
And if you've already
collapsed to your belly,
we're gonna meet you there now.
So nice and easy belly
all the way to the earth.
Good, inhale, Cobra.
And exhale to
soften and release.
Curl the toes under.
Press up to Plank or all fours.
And Downward Facing Dog.
Upper arm bones are
externally rotating.
Inner thighs are
internally rotating.
Breathing nice wide
lateral breaths here.
Good. Bend the knees generously.
Lift the hip creases up high.
Inhale, carve a line
with the nose, look forward.
And exhale, 
make your way to the top.
Good, inhale, halfway lift.
This time with airplane arms 
open the chest, look forward.
And exhale, Forward Fold 
all the way back down.
Root to rise here.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Big breath, big stretch,
catch something,
a little magic overhead,
a little star,
and then bring it back down,
palms pressing
together at the heart space.
Close your eyes.
Pause, observe.
Listen to your breath.
Alright, check it out.
For this next
beat of our practice,
I'd like to, let's bring
the hands to the waistline
for a little stability.
I'd like to invite you
to keep your focus out
or even looking at me,
but don't look down,
my darlings,
unless you absolutely have to.
Trust that the ground is
there behind you, right?
We know that it's there.
We've stepped back so
many times into these lunges.
So trust. We're building this
360 awareness of our exterior,
but we're doing it
from the inside out, right?
So just a little practice,
a little training.
Lift the heart.
Find your Mountain Pose
with the hands on the waistline.
Deep breath in.
Exhale. No need to look back
unless you absolutely have to.
Nice and easy, 
trust the ground is there.
We're gonna lift the left
knee up on our marionette string
as we've been doing,
and then we're
gonna slowly step it
all the way back into a lunge.
If we get here and we find that
squeezing the thighs together
is not enough to feel stable,
then we can lower
onto this back knee.
Super awesome.
Otherwise, we're here.
Good.
If you have the back knee lifted,
bend it for a second.
Get your center underneath you.
Feel that power, 
that strength in the legs.
And then here we go again
reaching the fingertips 
forward, up, and back.
Careful that you're
not too narrow here.
Lots of space in the shoulders.
Thumbs back, pinkies forward.
Great, inhale in again.
Imagine someone's just
gently pulling your fingers
or your wrists up.
So we have lots of
space between the waistline
and the shoulder girdle.
And then we'll bend 
the elbows, lift the chest.
Slowly squeezing the
shoulder blades together.
Now pause here and breathe.
Neck is nice and long.
We've done a lot
of beautiful work
not crunching the
back of the neck,
but keeping the neck
in beautiful extension
of the rest of the spine.
Squeeze the inner
thighs to the midline.
Breathe wide here.
You got it. 
This is challenging.
Find that breath
in the back body.
What? Okay, inhale,
reach for the sky.
Stay here.
Exhale, left fingertips forward,
right fingertips back.
Again, it's okay to gently
come onto the left knee here.
You got this.
Right fingertips down.
Left fingertips up.
Big stretch, inhale in.
Then exhale,
we're gonna cartwheel
all the way back
down to our lunge.
Beautiful. Step the 
back foot up to meet the front.
Inhale, halfway lift 
to rinse it out.
Exhale, soften and fold.
Root to rise here.
Inhale, reach for the sky. 
Maybe hook the thumbs.
And then exhale, hands to heart.
Take a second. Observe.
Trust that you are exactly
where you are supposed to be.
No one said it was gonna be easy
showing up for
this type of work.
But when we really
trust the process,
trust that it's valuable,
trust that the mere fact
that we're coming to the mat
with intention
to be with our breath,
slow down our heart rate,
to uncover our hidden truth,
dude, so good.
Okay, here we go.
Hands the waistline again.
Trust that that ground is there.
You got this. Mountain Pose.
Stand up nice and tall.
Inhale in, lift the right knee
up on your marionette string.
And then slowly step
it back nice and easy
into your high lunge.
You can always bring
that back knee down.
Great. If the knee is lifted,
bend it just a bit.
Get your center underneath you.
Find that connection,
that lift through 
the front body,
that grounding
through the back body.
Pull the elbows back
a bit here. Breathe.
Start to straighten
the back leg again.
As you inhale, reach the
fingertips all the way up.
So in the static hold, 
it's really never static, right?
Because the breath is
actually getting a chance
to be the star of the show,
the prima ballerina.
So we're here,
and when you're ready,
we're gonna bend the elbows.
Draw the
shoulder blades together,
lifting the heart,
a backbend here.
Wow.
Grounding through all four
corners of the front foot,
and we breathe.
We practice nice
wide lateral breath,
breathing down as you inhale.
Keeping a nice long
neck as you exhale.
You got this, squeeze the inner 
thighs towards the midline.
Hug those low ribs in.
Spread the fingertips.
Notice what it feels
like to be alive today.
Sweet, and then inhale,
reach all the way up.
And exhale, here we go.
Left fingertips back,
right fingertips forward.
Pull that left hip crease back.
Think of all those beautiful 
twists you've been doing.
Such a wonderful 
gift for the spine.
Draw your navel in and up.
You got this. 
Left fingertips go down.
Right fingertips reach up.
Big breath, big stretch here.
And then slowly cartwheeling
all the way back down.
Rock the back foot
up to meet the front.
Forward Fold.
Now inhale, halfway lift,
your version.
Exhale to soften and
fold everything back in.
Lovely.
Fingertips come on the mat here.
We're gonna bend
the knees so much
so that we come
down into a low crouch.
Walk the fingertips forward.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale to bow the head.
Breathing deep here.
Try to press
into your pinky toe.
Nice, then drop the heels.
Lift the hips up high,
Forward Fold.
Root to rise here.
Big breath in as you
ground through the feet.
Squeeze the legs,
send the fingertips
all the way up towards the sky.
Catch a star and bring
it all the way back down
toward your heart.
Close your eyes
or soften your gaze.
And listen.
Alright, fingertips are
gonna come down left to right.
You might take a little
step back, but don't look down.
You can even bring 
a little attitude to it.
I will demo this again.
You can just step
back without looking.
And I'll just do
it one more time.
When you just step back,
and you're like, 
"I have all of my awareness
"or my willingness to
have self-awareness."
And it really does bring a
little magic to your energy.
Right? It's like when
someone walks in a room
with kind of awareness,
you're like, ooh.
So here we go. (laughs)
Let's do it one more time.
Step back up.
And then here you go.
Just step back
without looking down.
And if you're
not able to do this,
you're gonna do
your version of that.
And you're just
gonna embody it fully
and trust that you're exactly
where you are supposed to be.
Mountain Pose.
Shift your weight
to the right foot.
Slow marionette string
lifts the left foot up.
We're gonna interlace the
fingertips around the shin here.
Beautiful.
Now we're gonna bring the
right thumb back to the sternum,
a little half prayer.
And then we're gonna slide
the left hand down to the ankle.
We've been here before.
Nice quad stretch.
We're gonna flip it back.
Squeeze the left knee
in towards the midline,
and we're hugging
everything in towards center,
not collapsing
into the right hip.
Now you might just stay here.
We can even use 
a piece of furniture
or a wall to work here,
or we might 
flip the left hand
around to the left arch.
Keep squeezing the knee in.
And then take that right
hand that's on the furniture
or maybe on the heart,
and we might just play
with extending it outward,
palm face up.
And you can always
return to your base.
And then we'll start to kick out
perhaps through that left foot,
finding that lift up
through the center line,
lift up through
the pelvic floor.
So we'll kick out.
We're opening up through
the left chest of course.
Neck is nice and long.
Soft bend in that standing leg.
Breathing deep.
Now find your focal point.
Find your Drishti as
you come into a Dancer Pose
or a Standing Bow.
If you fall,
just come back to it,
hugging those low ribs in.
And then wherever
you are, inhale in,
embody it fully, and
then exhale, slowly release.
Check it out.
Right arm over the left as
you stand lower body in Mountain,
upper body
giving yourself a hug,
an embrace like, 
"Dude, you tried.
"It was awesome." (laughs)
Balancing postures do not lie.
Trust that you're exactly
where you're supposed to be.
Okay, left side, and then we'll
bring it down to the ground,
chill it out, and call it a day.
Whenever you're ready.
Marionette string
lifts the right knee up.
Stay focused here.
Nice and easy,
control your breath
as we interlace the fingertips
and squeeze the right
knee all the way up and in.
Press away from the
earth with that standing leg.
So find your foundation here.
And then bring the
left thumb to the sternum,
slide the right hand
to that right ankle,
kick the foot back and squeeze
the right knee into center.
So press out of 
that standing leg.
Ground.
And then when you feel ready,
you might flip the
right to the right arch.
Keep squeezing
the right knee in.
Inhale in.
Exhale, maybe you send that
left arm out, palm face up,
and maybe we slowly start
to kick the right foot out.
Nice and easy.
Working from the ground up here.
Soft bend in that standing leg.
Shoulders relaxing
away from the ears.
A full body experience.
And if you fall out of it,
just come right back to it.
All good.
Trusting where you
are in the process,
where you are on the path.
Careful not to hold your breath.
Don't forget the name
of this (laughs) journey.
And then let's all take one
more deep breath in together.
Fully embody the
posture wherever you are.
And then slow and
best you can with control,
bring it back.
Lower body's in Mountain.
Upper body is gonna
come into an embrace.
So left arm over
the right this time.
Give yourself a big hug.
Dig down into the heels.
Lengthen down
through the tailbone.
Should feel
yummy in the low back.
Then release.
Without looking down,
step to the top of your mat.
And inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale, Forward Fold.
Last time, inhale halfway lift.
Airplane arms optional.
Exhale to let everything go.
Walk the feet as
wide as your yoga mat.
Toes spill off the edge,
fingertips on the earth,
and slow and steady,
we're gonna drop our
center down in space.
Come into a squat.
Alright, if the heels come
up here, go ahead and let them.
We're working with
the opposition here,
lifting up
through the front body,
grounding through the back body.
So take a second.
Find your foundation,
adjusting the feet 
if you need to,
and then we'll keep the
fingertips on the ground,
or we'll bring the
palms together at the heart.
Now press the
elbows into the legs.
Squeeze the legs
into the elbows.
Find that connection.
Then stay here
or you might start
to shift your weight
forward onto the hands.
Lifting the heels, walking
the toes in towards center,
just a little Crow practice.
Under the umbrella of trust,
just trusting the process.
Don't worry about
hitting that shape.
So reminder, 
our gaze is forward.
We're moving from center.
Shoulder blades
drawing in and together.
We have this external
rotation in the upper arm bone,
and then maybe
one toe lifts off,
and then the other.
Maybe not today.
Just trusting that you are
exactly where you're
supposed to be in this process.
Listening to your breath.
And after you play for a
minute or two, or zero. (laughs)
You're like, "No, thanks. 
Not today." That's great.
We're gonna slowly
come out of the squat.
So if your feet aren't together
in the center of your mat,
walk them to the center,
and then use 
your hands, your paws,
to slowly come to a seat.
From here, we'll inhale,
reach for the sky,
and exhale, 
send the heart forward,
reaching for the toes.
Now, don't get too bummed out
if your hands don't
come near your toes.
Do you know how
crazy that is anyway?
So honor your body.
Trust that you're exactly
where you're supposed to be,
and wherever your hands land,
enjoy the present moment.
Maybe tomorrow
they'll go a little further.
Maybe if you keep
your home practice up,
which is really
what this is all about,
an invitation to do just that,
maybe one day
you grab the ankles.
One day you grab the big toes.
Maybe one day you grab
the outer edges of the feet.
There's this acceptance
in the celebration, right,
of just trusting
that you're exactly
where you're supposed to be.
And when I keep showing
up to connect to myself
and stay curious
about my hidden truth,
I actually started
to really believe that.
Like I am exactly
where I'm supposed to be.
Alright, take
another moment here.
Make sure to relax the
weight of the head over.
And then from the
base of the spine,
find that little connection.
Maybe even you lift up.
It's a little
kegel action there.
And we slowly,
from the root chakra,
we travel all the way
up this super highway,
all the way up the spine.
You can soften through the
feet here now and the toes,
and we rise up.
Gorgeous.
Come to flat back
from here nice and easy.
(humming)
Great, we're gonna hug
the knees up to the chest.
and then rock them
over to the right side.
Cactus arms here.
Breathe.
Maybe turning onto the
left ear if it feels right.
And then slowly through center,
take it to the other side.
Coming onto the right
ear if it feels good.
Inhale in.
Exhale, come back
through to center.
Then slowly extend the
legs out one at a time.
We're gonna
interlace the fingertips,
and then bring the
palms behind the head.
Don't worry, we're not going 
into any core work. (laughs)
We're just relaxing.
I want you to open the legs wide
so they have lots of space
so we're not too bound up here.
Give yourself some
space. Walk the ankles out.
You can extend the thumbs here.
We're gonna give
ourself a little massage
with the thumbs
right into the head, the neck.
You can close your eyes.
Finishing today's practice
with a little self massage.
Again, using the thumbs
to press into the back
of the head, the neck.
Relaxing the jaw.
Starting to allow
your breath to just be
an easy, natural flow.
No technique.
Just nice and
easy organic rhythm.
And then releasing that,
bringing the arms to
rest gently at your sides.
A flash of surrender, 
big, big moment of trust.
Letting go, finding stillness,
the courage to rest.
Just take a moment here
to give yourself permission
to do absolutely nothing.
Trusting that the
benefits of your practice
are there already,
formulating,
talking,
serving.
Relax the weight of
your body completely
and fully into the earth.
Way to show up today.
Way to trust yourself.
Trust your intuition.
Thank you for
trusting me and this practice.
Let's bring the palms together,
thumbs all the way
up to the third eye.
This point of intuition,
the teacher within,
the guide within.
And we'll take a
deep breath in together.
And a nice refreshing
exhale to close the practice.
And we'll whisper
Namaste.
(bright upbeat piano music)
