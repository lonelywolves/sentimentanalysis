- What's up, everyone?
Welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and this is Benji
and today per your request,
we have a core 
conditioning practice.
This one's a quickie so
hop into something comfy
and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Alright, let's begin 
on our backs.
So take your time
getting down there,
we don't need to
rush anything here.
Move mindfully.
A little goes a long way,
we really wanna pay
attention to the how,
so we're gonna
focus on the breath today
while we get our
core conditioning in.
So to start, you're just gonna
bring the hands to the belly,
feet on the ground,
knees up towards the sky,
close your eyes,
relax your shoulders.
Take a deep breath in,
fill the belly with air.
And then exhale, 
it softens and releases.
And again, big inhale.
Fill the belly with air.
And exhale, 
it softens and releases.
And last time, this time 
really inhale lots of love in.
And lots of love out.
Beautiful.
Alright, from here, we're
gonna extend the legs out long.
Then we're gonna
start nice and easy.
Hug the right knee into
the chest and then switch,
hug the left
knee into the chest.
Hug the right knee into
the chest and then the left.
Now we're gonna add a
lift of nose toward the knee.
You're lifting the head,
the neck and the shoulders.
If this doesn't work for you
in the head, the neck,
the shoulders,
you can bring the head
back down and work here.
We are targeting
the lower belly here,
scooping the tailbone up.
Keep the shoulders
relaxed in either variation.
Breathing deep.
Now just when you feel
like you wanna give up,
that's actually when we're
going to now straighten the legs
and work in little scissors.
So you can keep a
little bend in your knee,
but we're extending 
the legs out long,
just challenging yourself here.
And we're gonna be
here for three, two,
and even it out on the one.
Great, hug both
knees into the chest.
Bring the palms into the knees.
You're gonna draw
the knees out wide,
so the, excuse me, out in front,
so the arms are extended.
Peek at me if you need to.
Good, then take
the knees out wide
and then draw them
in towards center.
Good, take 'em out towards 
the front edge of your mat
around and in towards center.
And one more time, out,
around and in towards center.
Beautiful.
Interlace the fingertips,
send the hands behind the
head here, nice and easy.
We're gonna lift the shins
so that they're parallel
to the sky or to the ceiling.
So you're gonna feel
that tailbone scoop up,
the low belly draws down.
Belly is engaged,
abdominal wall is engaged.
We're just gonna 
do light taps here.
Right toes, left toes.
Nice and easy.
Now we're wanting 
to make sure that this
knee over the hip
stack doesn't get too rocked.
So you're not wanting to
bring your knees in too much,
but as best you can try 
to keep the knee over
the hip so that 
femur is aligned.
You're gonna feel
it in your low belly,
you're gonna wanna keep
your low back nice and safe,
nice and flush with the mat.
Alright, just when
you wanna give up here,
we're gonna lift the head,
the neck, the shoulders,
keep the elbows wide to
challenge ourselves here.
Tapping the toes
with the head lifted here.
In this nice, little 
neck hammock here,
you can extend the thumbs
so you have a
little bit of support.
We're here for three,
gaze up towards the sky, two.
And evening it out on the one.
Beautiful.
Release, hug the
knees into the chest,
take a deep breath in.
And then exhale,
extend the legs out long.
Alright, from here,
listen carefully.
You can start by using
your hands on the ground,
we're gonna inhale,
sit up all the way tall,
send the fingertips
up towards the sky
and then exhale, Forward Fold.
Navel draws back, nice and
articulate through the spine,
we roll it back down to one.
Use the hands if you need to,
otherwise we'll inhale,
reach the arms all
the way up as you sit up.
Then exhale, fold.
And then slow and steady
navel draws to the spine,
we lower down with control.
Here we go, inhale to lift.
Exhale to fold.
Slow and steady
with control all 
the way back down
and you can move in your
own pace, nice and slow.
Again, feel free to use
the hands on the earth,
or fingertips on the earth
to get through that first move,
and in time, you won't 
need them anymore.
Alright, so you can start to
do this now at your own pace.
Don't feel like you
have to rush, right?
This is not
about number of reps,
but about the
quality of movement
and your connectivity 
and your engagement.
So we're slowly
building heat up here.
Again, if you need to use the
hands or the elbows to sit up,
go for it.
Don't be hard on yourself,
just take it nice and slow.
Really articulating
through the spine 
on the way down.
Beautiful.
We're gonna do two more,
wherever you are, you got this.
If you took a break,
pick back up, here we go.
And after that final one,
you'll come onto your back.
And you can center yourself
on the mat, recenter rather.
Then we're gonna 
bring the hands
right underneath the bum here.
Beautiful.
Alright, with the
legs extended out,
let's lift now, big breath,
big move here,
we're gonna lift both
legs up towards the sky,
bend just the right leg down
and we begin to
scissor move here.
Many of you know this,
but stay with your
breath here nice and slow.
Hugging the low ribs in.
Chin is nice and tucked.
Oops.
Keep it going, nice and steady.
And then if you want,
we can add a little lift,
a little hover,
lifting the
head all the way up.
Keeping that
image of like a orange
or a mango, grapefruit
between the chin
and the chest here.
And for the last 10 seconds,
we're gonna speed it up here.
Scissoring the legs,
Breathing deep.
Scooping the tailbone up,
pressing the
hands into the earth.
Three, two and one.
Great, slowly release the hands,
hug the knees into the chest.
Rock gently side to side.
Observe your breath.
Beautiful.
From here, we're gonna extend
the legs out one more time.
This time as we inhale,
we're gonna sit up,
we're gonna lift up,
we're gonna bend the right knee,
we're gonna grab,
excuse me, the left knee,
we're gonna grab the
left ankle or the left foot.
Good, then slowly
lower down. Alternate.
Lifting up, grabbing the
right foot or right ankle.
Or maybe even right knee. 
And slowly releasing.
Again, this is not
about the number of reps,
this is about slow, beautiful
movement with connectivity.
Engage, working the
whole abdominal wall.
I'm gonna stop talking
so I can do this with you.
Finding a nice pace
with your breath.
This is about connectivity
and engaging your muscles,
not about reps or quantity.
Inhaling to lower.
Exhaling to lift.
Beautiful.
Then even it out and
we'll release, nice and easy.
Bend the knees,
feet come to the ground.
Interlace the fingertips,
bring them behind the head.
Okay, last little bit.
Shins come parallel
to the ceiling again.
We're gonna extend
the right leg out,
right elbow to left knee.
Inhale to center,
exhale left leg out,
left elbow to right knee.
You got this, inhale
to center and switch.
Alternating here,
finding that center moment
to really draw the navel down.
Beautiful.
Moving with your breath,
nice and easy.
Bicycles.
Beautiful.
Now, if you want, you can 
pick up the pace here,
go at a double-time speed.
Nice and easy for ten,
nine, eight, seven,
six, five.
Keep breathing, four,
three, two and one, release it.
Beautiful, hug the knees
into the chest (chuckles),
you're like, "Nice and easy?"
When I say nice and easy,
I mean like nice
and easy in the face,
like not working any
harder than we need to.
Alright, from here take the
knees over to the right side.
Just a little twist here 
can let the arms open up
into little cactus arms.
Close your eyes and relax,
breathe into your belly.
Beautiful and then bringing
it back through the center,
taking the legs
to the other side,
and just taking a second here.
Feel that nice twist,
that massage in the belly.
Close your eyes,
relax everything, breathe in.
And breathe out.
Awesome, come
back to the center,
hug the knees into the chest.
One last time, slide the 
hands behind the thighs
and then you can rock up
to a nice comfortable seat.
Alright, high five, everyone,
thank you so much for joining me
for this conditioning practice.
I will see you next time,
take good care.
