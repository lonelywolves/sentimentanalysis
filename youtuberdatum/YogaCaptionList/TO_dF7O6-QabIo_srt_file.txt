- What's up, everyone?
Welcome to Yoga with Adriene.
I'm Adriene and this is Benji
and today we have rainbow yoga,
the perfect practice 
to brighten your day,
to help turn 
darkness into light.
So hop into something 
comfy and let's get started.
(bright music)
Okay, my darling friends,
let's begin in a nice, 
comfortable seat of your choice.
So you get to decide 
how you wanna sit today.
You can start kneeling, 
you can start cross-legged,
you can start this first part
on the edge of your couch.
So find what feels good
and come into your seat,
and when you're 
ready take a deep breath in
and lift your 
shoulders all the way
up to your ears here to start
and as you exhale 
drop the shoulders down.
Two more like that, inhale.
Squeeze and lift, squeeze,
squeeze, squeeze, squeeze,
and exhale, let's let go 
of any stress or tension.
And one more time.
Big inhale, squeeze and lift.
Really breathing into 
your full capacity here,
holding your breath at the top,
and then exhale to let go.
So we're letting 
go of any bad juju,
any haterade,
any energy that's
just not serving us, right?
Whether it's just a small
tantrum or a little frustration.
Maybe we were 
bored or exhausted.
Whatever it is, 
I'm so glad you chose
this bright, 
beautiful yoga practice.
Let's find what feels good.
You're gonna bring 
your left fingertips
down to your 
couch or to the earth,
and you're gonna 
paint a big rainbow
with the right 
fingertips all the way
up and over as your create
length in your right side body.
Now really, really reach.
When you get to 
your max capacity,
wiggle the right fingertips.
Let your fingertips 
just kinda twinkle here,
and then slowly 
bring it all the way
up and take it 
to the other side.
Right fingertips down,
and from there,
paint a big rainbow 
with your fingertips
all the way up 
and over, feeling that
awesome stretch in 
the left side body.
Then when you get there,
reach a little further,
twinkle the left fingertips.
Big stretch.
Yes, and then come 
all the way back, awesome.
From here, you're gonna move
from whatever seat 
you chose to the ground,
and then we're gonna bring the
left heel in, so one heel in,
and then one heel behind,
so you're gonna
create this shape in your body,
and if you find 
that it's really hard
to sit up nice and tall, 
know that you're not alone,
but one helpful 
thing is to just lift
the hips up on a 
little couch cushion
or a rolled up towel or blanket.
Alright, and you're gonna 
bring your right fingertips
right in front of you 
and your left fingertips
to the outer 
edge of your left leg,
and then very slowly we're gonna
bring the right 
knee all the way up,
and then bring it all the down.
And then bring 
it all the way up,
and then all way down.
And keep this action going.
We're bringing a little space
and movement into the right hip,
creating a little 
half rainbow shape,
or almost like 
a windshield wiper
with the right knee,
back and forth.
Excellent, and then next 
time your right knee's up,
go ahead and keep it there.
Your right foot may or not come
all the way to the ground,
and then from here, you're gonna
bring your left hand to the
earth, and same little ditty,
right fingertips reach forward,
up and over to the left.
Great, and then slowly 
bring it all the way back in.
And we'll switch 
to the other side.
Right heel comes in.
Left heel goes behind.
You're just opposite leg
then the ones you did before.
Just find your set up first.
And then left 
fingertips go in front of you,
right fingertips go behind you,
just for a little stability,
and then you can 
use your hands here
to help guide the left knee up.
Breathing the whole way long.
Nice and slow
and instead of just 
working to get your knee up,
really pay attention to 
how this is all connected,
the whole body is connected.
So sometimes when we're tight
in one area of the body,
it's helpful
to move the whole body 
with breath to tend to it
rather than just 
targeting that one spot.
Alright, the next 
time your left knee's up,
plant that left 
foot into the ground.
Use your hands to sit up nice
and tall, breathe deep here.
And then here we go, 
right hand comes to the earth,
left fingertips 
reach all the way out,
and up, and over, 
creating a big stretch
on the left side body,
inhale in,
and then exhale, 
bring it all the way back.
Alright, bring the soles 
of the feet together here.
We're gonna grab the ankles,
and nice and slow,
bring the knees up and in,
feet come to the ground,
and then bring 
the feet together,
takes the knees down and out.
Keep it going 
all the way up and in
and all the way down and out.
And no matter what age you are,
you might take a 
second here to close your eyes
and just think about a 
beautiful, colorful butterfly.
Maybe if you are a kid,
or a kid at heart,
you might take this moment here
to ask what color 
butterfly would you be,
if you were a butterfly?
What color or what 
colors would you be
if you were a butterfly?
And then I dare you guys,
if you're adults,
to tell us what color 
butterfly you would be
in the comment section down
below after this practice.
Okay, you're doing awesome.
The next time the knees come up,
go ahead and bring 
them in, in, in,
and again, don't try to 
copycat my shape and my body,
be true to your body,
so if you can't
get here, make it your own,
maybe creating a 
little more space.
So that's one of 
the beautiful things
about at-home yoga, 
is we come to remember
and remind 
ourselves and each other
that yoga's about 
getting to the true you,
not copying or 
emulating somebody else's
version of yoga or the 
shapes or the experience,
it's totally yours.
So as you gently bow 
your head to your heart,
and start to wake up 
through the back body
and get a great lovely big
stretch to the back of the neck,
you can just meditate on that
and send some love to
all parts of yourself.
Inhale lots of love it.
Exhale lots of love out. Cool.
Slowly lift the head, 
come back up.
We're gonna grab the 
hamstrings, backs of the thighs,
as you lift the toes up for a
little balancing posture here.
Great, breathing deep.
You might take 
the fingertips out
if you want a 
little more challenge.
Lifting the heart, 
waking up the core.
Great, and if you want, 
you can straighten one leg.
Just see what happens if 
you straighten just one leg,
don't think too hard,
breathe deep.
And then bend that knee, and
then straighten the other leg.
Just see what happens, keep
your heart lifted, open mind,
and then bend, and then 
maybe let's see what happens
if we send both 
toes up towards the sky.
We're here for three, two, on
the one, cross your ankles,
come all the way 
through to all fours.
Excellent, from 
here you're gonna
come to Tabletop Position,
shoulders over the wrists,
hips over the knees.
Cat Pose and Cow Pose 
moving together.
Start with Cat, you're 
gonna draw the navel up,
press away from your yoga mat
and arch your body 
like a black Halloween cat.
Create space in the back body,
claw through the fingertips.
Now Cow Pose, drop the belly,
open the chest, 
let your heart shine forward
and lift the corners 
of your mouth slightly
if you're wondering, "Why did I
pick this rainbow yoga video?"
Just trust.
Maybe this is a good one for you
right now and you 
don't even know it.
Rounding through 
the spine, Cat Pose.
Spinal flexion.
Dropping the belly,
staying connected
to your foundation. Cow.
One more time, Cat Pose,
rounding through, breathe out.
And then dropping the belly,
opening the chest, breathe in.
Yay, alright, from here,
we're gonna walk 
the knees in just a bit.
Kick the right foot out, and
then sweep the right foot
all the way up 
into a nice low lunge.
You can walk 
the knee back if you
need a deeper stretch here.
Find your breath again,
inhaling in,
and using your exhale to really
relax your shoulders down.
Alright, then 
take your left toes,
and you're gonna 
bring them over round
towards the 
right side of your mat,
then you're gonna 
bring your right hand
to the right inner 
arch of your right foot.
Alright, here we go.
You're gonna put a big 
paintbrush in your left hand
and you're gonna 
take that paintbrush
all the way towards 
the front edge of your mat.
You can lift up 
on your right hand
as you reach all the way up.
You're painting a 
big rainbow all the way
up and overhead, stay connected
through that front foot
as you bring it all 
the way down to the ground.
Fingertips or left 
palm to the ground here
as we reach the 
right fingertips up,
then you're gonna slowly,
take your time,
straighten your right leg,
turn your right toes in,
and find this 
Gate Pose variation.
Alright, then we're gonna 
play a little guitar here,
so you're gonna take 
your right fingertips forward,
and then through, and 
then around, and then back,
and then you're gonna 
keep this circular motion
going in your 
right hand as you wake up
through the shoulder, 
through the side body.
Core is lit up here.
Foundation is strong.
Now just find a softness 
and easiness in your face
as you strum the guitar here.
(strumming noise)
Once more, awesome.
And then we're 
gonna go all the way back
the way we came in,
so you're gonna
anchor through 
your center, your core,
you're gonna 
come all the way up.
Reverse with your paintbrush,
turn the right toes out,
nice and slow, 
hold on to your balance,
move slow and steady, 
and bring it all the way
back to your nice, low lunge.
Excellent, here you go.
Lift your heart 
up towards the sky,
sweep the fingertips forward
up and back, big stretch.
And then exhale, 
bring it all the way down.
Plant the palms, bring your
right knee back to the earth,
and we're gonna kick 
the left leg out long.
Take a deep breath in.
Exhale, sweep the left 
foot all the way up.
Send your right 
knee back just a bit,
find that nice, yummy stretch,
keep breathing.
And then when you're ready,
sweep the right toes
toward the left 
side of your mat.
Bring your left hand now just
next to the left inner arch,
and then you really 
wanna pull back
with your left crease here,
breathing deep,
before we take our paintbrush,
so strong foundation,
front knee over front ankle,
and reach it forward, 
up, around, and back.
Excellent.
When you feel like you've found
the earth with your 
right fingertips or right palm,
then you can 
hug the low ribs in,
start to straighten 
through your left leg,
and turn those left toes in.
Then left fingertips reach up,
we breathe deep
using this shape, this 
opportunity to go inward.
Self care, self love,
and then here we go,
bringing the left 
fingertips down and around.
You're gonna move 
in a circular motion here,
really feeling the 
skin of the body stretch
as you go through your dance.
Try to keep your foundation,
that which
is touching the 
earth nice and strong.
Alright.
When you're ready,
let's reverse it,
so here we go, 
really hug the low ribs in.
Connect to your core, 
your center as you reverse it.
You're gonna 
take your paintbrush
all the way up and over,
you're gonna
turn the left toes back towards
the front edge of your mat,
right leg comes to follow as we
come back to our nice low
lunge, framing the left foot.
Here we go, big breath as you
sweep the fingertips forward,
up and back, lift your 
heart up towards the sky
and then exhale, melt it down.
Plant the palms.
Come back to all fours.
You can just shake 
your tail a little bit here
one way, and then the other.
Awesome, now we're 
gonna walk the knees back,
come on to the belly.
Drag the hands in 
line with the ribcage,
squeeze the elbows 
into the side body.
Tuck the chin into the chest,
and Cobra Pose, here we come.
Inhale, lift the heart.
Gaze forward.
Exhale, release.
Awesome, let's do one more.
Inhale, lift the heart.
Gaze forward.
And exhale to release, awesome.
Pressing back up to all fours,
walk the knees together.
You're gonna paint,
just imagine,
now each fingertip is a
paintbrush, a different color,
and you're gonna paint 
two beautiful rainbow lines
all the way down your mat,
flick it away,
and then melt 
gently forward into
Child's Pose, Balasana.
This is our last 
yoga pose for today,
so find what feels good here.
If you need to modify 
or change this up
to come into a relaxation
pose that feels okay for you,
go ahead and do that now.
And then I'll invite 
everyone to close their eyes,
relax your shoulders,
and give thanks for yourself, 
to yourself, rather,
for showing up here today,
for keeping an open mind.
And when we practice
having and experiencing 
an open mind on the yoga mat,
then we know what it feels like
to maintain that or have that
or create that 
experience off the yoga mat.
So in other words, if we wish
to stay open minded 
instead of close minded,
yoga practice is 
(stammers) a great way
to do that.
Who would have thought?
I swear.
Okay, here we go, slow 
and steady, come back up.
Imagine you're a 
little seedling growing
into a beautiful flower here,
and you keep 
growing really tall,
and you're gonna end 
just the way we started,
in a seated 
posture of your choice.
So you can get creative here,
you can add some style elements
to your seated posture,
or you can go traditional.
Wherever you are, 
sit up nice and tall now.
Lift your heart.
We'll close today's practice
by bringing the palms together
and honoring the 
love and the light
and just the 
awesomeness in ourselves
while also 
celebrating and recognizing
and seeing that in everyone
else, and everything else.
When you're ready, 
take a deep breath in,
and we'll seal 
today's rainbow yoga practice
by bowing head to heart,
and shouting,
saying, declaring, or whispering
Namaste.
Thanks everyone.
Benji and I send you our love.
Let us know how you're feeling
in the comments 
section down below.
Take care.
