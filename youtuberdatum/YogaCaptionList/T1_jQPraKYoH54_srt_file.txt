- Hello, everyone.
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 24, uplift.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alright, my darling friends,
let's begin in a nice,
comfortable seat of your choice.
Today I'm gonna invite you to
bring your left palm out in
front when you find your seat
and then bring your right hand
on top and just let your hands
rest gently in your lap here
in a cross-legged seat or 
maybe on the knees today.
Close your eyes or soften your
gaze gently down past your nose.
And begin to notice your breath.
The hard part is done.
You're here.
You pressed play.
Begin to gently 
deepen your breath.
And even if it was difficult
to arrive here 
on the mat today,
or maybe, especially 
if it was difficult to
arrive here on the mat today,
can you allow 
today's uplifting flow
to be a gift that 
you give yourself?
Enjoy your gift.
