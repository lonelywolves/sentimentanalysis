- Hello, everyone,
and welcome to Home,
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 26. Keep.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alrighty, my friends
welcome back.
Let's start in a nice,
comfortable seat of your choice.
Thank you so 
much for being here.
Let's take a deep 
breath in right away.
As always, remembering to 
use that exhale to soften,
relax the shoulders down.
Close your eyes, 
if you like here.
Just taking a moment 
for yourself to
slow down.
As you're ready just find a
soft sway here in the spine.
Again, remembering 
to use your tools,
use that inhale to find a gentle
lift wherever it feels right.
And use your exhale 
to find a softening,
a relaxing the shoulders down.
Just becoming more 
aware of those areas
in which you 
feel tight or tense.
Alright, and then left hand's 
gonna come to the earth.
We're gonna send the right
fingertips all the way up and
then take a nice 
side body stretch here,
continuing to 
gently deepen the breath.
And then come all the 
way back through center
and take it to the other side.
Continuing to deepen the breath.
And then back to center.
We're gonna come to all fours
and just continue this 
soft, easy movement.
Breathing deep.
Can sway the hips a 
little left to right.
(floor creaks) 
What's up creeky old floor?
And then you can also (laughs)
start to find your spinal
flexion moving through Cat-Cow.
But continuing to explore any
other movement that might feel
good within the structure.
So growing that practice.
Getting in the habit of keeping
the things that work for you.
And gaining the awareness to
notice the things that are not
working for you, maybe 
choosing to let them go.
So why do we hold 
on to certain things,
certain habits, practices,
ways of being that 
don't really serve us?
So today considering that.
Keep what makes you happy and
consider moving along that
which doesn't serve.
Alrighty, from Tabletop Position
find a nice, 
long, beautiful spine.
So really reaching the 
crown of the head forward.
Tail back.
When you're ready, inhale,
extend the right leg out long.
Right toes can be on the earth.
If you want to light up 
a little fire in the belly,
we'll start to lift off.
Can keep the right toes 
on the earth here to start
or we'll lift off.
Dialing the 
right pinky toe down.
Press in to both palms evenly.
Inhale in here.
Lift your heart space between
your shoulder blades so just
nice lift up through 
the upper back body.
And then exhale, bring that
right foot all the way up and
through, walk 
the left knee back.
Here we are in 
our nice low lunge.
Just take a second 
here to feel it out.
Maybe you widen 
your stance a bit.
Maybe we start to find 
the inner support system,
lifting up through 
the pelvic floor.
As you're ready, 
interlace your fingertips,
bring them to the 
top of the right thigh.
We're gonna pull the right
hip crease back to lift us up.
Inhale in here.
Nice and tall, head over heart,
heart of her pelvis.
Exhale, sink in.
Beautiful, inhale in again.
Exhale to release the 
fingertips to the earth.
You're gonna come to 
the left side of the mat.
Alright, listen carefully.
From here, right foot's 
gonna stay planted.
We're gonna take the left toes
and bring them over towards
the right side of the mat.
Shift your center 
back a bit here.
We're gonna walk the fingertips
all the way along the left side
of the mat and all the way to
the back here as we turn the
right toes in as if 
you were in Warrior II.
Little Gate variation here.
Left hand 
presses into the earth,
right fingertips are gonna cross
all the way across the chest and
reach up towards the sky.
Inhale in here.
Deep breath.
Exhale long, long, long.
Inhale fully.
And elongating the exhale.
Great, inhale to 
reach a little higher.
Wiggle the right fingertips.
Exhale to bring it 
all the way back down.
And you're just gonna 
trace your steps
back all the way 
to that nice low lunge.
Nice and slow.
Great, when you get 
there curl the left toes under.
Inhale, lift the left knee,
look forward.
Then exhale, plant the palms,
step it to Plank.
You got this.
Strong Plank.
Great, reach the heels back.
Crown forward.
Find that sits bone 
to heel connection.
So the legs are 
strong here, engaged.
Then just ask yourself, are
there areas in which you're
working harder 
than you need to do?
Do you need to keep that?
Low belly draws in.
We got this for three.
Stick with it for two 
and lower the knees
Tabletop Position on the one.
Awesome work.
Here we go.
Kicking the left toes out.
Extending through that left leg.
You can keep the left toes on
the ground or 
we can start to lift off.
Return to your breath.
Inhale, lift the 
left leg a little higher
maybe if it's lifted off the
ground and then everyone exhale,
bring it all the 
way up and through.
Step the left 
foot all the way up.
Walk the right knee back.
Coming into our nice low lunge.
Breathe deep here.
Just check it out.
There's no need to rush.
Then interlace the fingertips,
bring 'em to the top of the left
thigh, pull the left hip 
crease back to lift you up.
Head over heart, heart 
over pelvis here to start.
Big breath in.
Keep that inner support system,
that lift up from 
the pelvic floor.
That support that 
awareness through the midline.
And when you're ready,
you can exhale,
sink into that front leg, 
front hip a little deeper.
Great, take the hands bring 'em
to the right side of the mat.
Keep the front foot planted as
you take the right toes over
towards the 
left side of the mat.
And we're gonna 
slowly continue this journey,
walking the 
hands all the way back,
all the way, all the way back.
Got excited.
Turn the left toes in.
Right hand comes to the earth.
Left hand all the 
way across the body,
across the chest 
and up towards the sky.
So, again, back leg is
turned in just like Warrior II.
We're pressing into the outer
edge of that back foot to keep
this left leg super strong.
Neck is nice and long.
You can gaze straight 
ahead or all the way up.
Take a deep breath in.
Fill the lungs.
And a long breath out.
Really empty, empty, empty.
One more.
You got this. Big inhale.
Extend your exhale.
Good, inhale.
Reach a little higher.
Wiggle the left fingertips.
And with a little bit of grace,
nice and easy,
bring it back 
down as you exhale.
Just trace your steps all the
way back to that nice low lunge.
Frame your left foot.
And when you're ready, 
curl the right toes under,
lift the right knee, 
inhale to look forward.
Exhale to plant the palms
and step that left foot back.
Plank Pose or Half Plank.
You can lower 
on to the knees here.
Alright, inhale to 
look forward, shift forward.
Exhale to lower all the way
to the belly with control.
Press into the pubic bone,
press into the tops of the feet.
Drag your hands in 
line with the rib cage.
Squeeze those elbows in.
Here we go.
Inhale, lift up Cobra.
Exhale to soften and bow.
Again, inhale, lift up, Cobra.
And exhale to soften and bow.
Do one more.
With your breath, 
find that heart opener.
And again, are we working harder
in this shape 
than we need to be?
Keep what works.
Let go of what doesn't serve.
As you're ready, release 
slowly again with control.
We'll curl the toes under.
Press up to all fours
or Plank Pose, your choice.
Deep breath in.
Exhale to Downward Facing Dog.
Take a couple moments 
here to find what feels good,
to really pedal it out.
Again, nice, full inhalations,
long exhalations today.
See if you can really extend
the length of your breath
in and out.
Then bend the knees, inhale to
look forward and exhale to make
your way to the top,
nice and easy.
Take a moment here to breathe
deep in standing Forward Fold.
And then when you're ready,
bend the knees,
tuck your chin 
and slowly roll it up.
Stand up nice and tall.
Today own it.
Whatever that means to you.

Nice and slow.
Sink down low.

all the way back up.
Straighten the legs 
back through center.

opening to the left, Warrior II.
Good, sink low.
Drop your center.
Back toes turned in.
Relax your shoulders,
keep breathing.
Good, on your next inhale,
straighten both legs.
Reach the right fingertips 
all the way up and back.
Big stretch.
And then listen carefully.
Keep the legs strong,

We're gonna slowly 
begin to tip like a teapot,
sending the hips back, 
right fingertips forward.
Triangle Pose.
Send the right fingertips down.
Use your training.
All of this work 
we've done with the center,
draw the low belly in,
hug the low ribs in.
Strong spine here.
Lots of awareness 
from crown to tail
as we send the left
fingertips up high.
So from center, stay 
connected to that midline.
Inhale in.
Exhale, slowly float 
the left fingertips down.
Bend generously 
through that right knee.
Come all the way back 
to frame your right foot.
Then from center, you got this.
You're gonna rock 
the legs a little bit.
Step that back foot up halfway.
Here's our Pyramid Pose.
Take a deep breath 
in here, you got it.
On an exhale, 
lift the back heel.
Maybe lift the back toes.
Lifting the back 
foot all the way up,
standings splits.
So you can keep the big toes
on the ground working here,
just lifting the heel.
Maybe you just 
lift it up for a second.
Lift it up for a second.
Maybe in time we work to stand
fully on all four corners of
that right foot and maybe in
time you work to bring the hands
behind the right calf.
Just giving options, calf.
Right calf.
Inhale in here wherever you are.
Exhale to come back 
to your nice low lunge.
Inhale in, 
again to look forward.
Get light on the fingertips.
And exhale, plant the palms,
step the right toes back and
move through of a vinyasa.
Belly to Cobra,
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Keep what makes you happy.
Let go of what doesn't serve.
We'll meet in 
Downward Facing Dog.
When you get there, take a
nice, I love your breath in.
Big, big, full loving breath in.
And exhale, long, 
loving breath out.
When I say 
"I love you breath,"
I just mean put 
some feeling into it.
Yeah?
Alright, here we go.
On the next inhale, 
lift the left leg up high.
Claw through the fingertips.
Exhale, shift it forward
all the way, step it up.
Inhale, reach the 
fingertips towards the sky.
Straighten both legs.
We're lifting the back heel.
Lift, lift, lift.
And then exhale, 
bend the front knee.
Slow, gentle twist to the left.
What's up?
Beautiful, 
inhale back to center,
straighten both legs.
Lift up from the pelvic floor.
Strong legs.
Here we go.
Slowly opening to 
the right, Warrior II.
Strong legs.
Pull the pinkies back, sink
deep into that front knee.
Beautiful. Press into the outer 
edge of that back foot strong.
Engage your right inner thigh.
Then here you go, reaching 
left fingertips forward,
up and back I'm gonna straighten
through the front leg, 
Reverse Triangle.
Send left fingertips 
all the way back.
Create space, then try to
maintain this length in the left
side body as we tip it forward.
Hips bump back.
We reach the left fingertips
forward, eventually down.
Strong legs here 
as they work to reach.
Right fingertips 
up towards the sky.
Maybe it's better for me today
to keep the right 
hand on the waistline.
So you can play.
Triangle Pose.
Keep that lift up 
from the pelvic floor.
Keep that navel 
drawing in and up.
Uddiyana Bandha.
You got this.
Nice, conscious, 
beautiful neck here.
Inhale in.
Exhale, float the 
right fingertips down.
Soften through that front leg.
Fingertips frame the left foot.
We pivot on the back foot.
When you're ready, 
find that gentle rock here
and step the right foot 
about halfway up.
Find your Pyramid Pose.
Then when you're ready, lift 
up from the left hip crease,
start to shift forward.
And we're just gonna play here.
Maybe that back heel 
lifts just a little bit.
Maybe the whole leg lifts a lot.
Playing in standing splits.
Maybe the hands come 
behind the calf one day.
Again, we can work with 
the big toe on the ground.
And I hope, I think you are
based on everything we've done
thus far, but we're really
paying attention to actually
this standing leg, 
not this lifting leg.
Really using our practice,
our training to 
find strong foundation
to learn and grow.
Keeping what works and letting
go of what doesn't serve.
Inhale in wherever you are.
Let's take an exhale to 
step it all the way back.
Woo.
Then inhale to look forward.
We're alive on the fingertips.
And exhale to plant 
the palms, step it back,
belly to Cobra or this time
maybe Chaturanga 
to Upward Facing Dog.
Using your inhale 
to open your heart.
And using your exhale to
send it up and back, Down Dog.
Great, inhale in here.
Exhale to empty it out.
Inhale to look forward
and exhale to make 
your way to the top.
Inhale to lengthen.
Nice, flat back position.
And exhale to let it all go.
Great, from here 
fingertips come to the mat.
We're gonna walk the 
feet is wide as the yoga mat.
And soft and easy,
just drop your center 
down, down, down.
Coming into nice yogic squat.
Now activate your breath here.
If the heels don't 
come down, no worries.
Let's make this work for you.
Breathe deep.
Not gonna be here long.
Keep the fingertips of the palms
on the earth for stability or
bring the palms together
and use your elbows to press,
actively press the legs out,
the knees out,
and then squeeze the 
legs into the elbows.
Building that 
strength from within.
This incredible awareness
that runs up and down the spine.
Where all the intrinsic muscles
and everything start to work as
one moving part, 
one complete self
versus all these
separate parts. Right?
All these separate units.
Take one more 
deep breath in here.
You're doing great.
And then exhale, release the
hands or slide the fingertips
behind you, wherever you are.
And nice and slow, 
we're gonna come to our backs.
Nice and slow.
Nice and slow.
If you want to engage the core
to roll down nice and slow maybe
that's something you 
keep on the agenda today.
If not, if you're just like
(hums negatively)
then let it go.
Go ahead and extend 
the legs out long
when you get there 
and take a big stretch.
Should feel really good.
Inhale, reaching the 
arms up and overhead.
Check in with your amazing body.
Spread the fingertips.
Inhale, lots of love in.
Wiggle the toes.
Exhale, lots of love out.
So can we like hang on? (laughs)
Can we keep paying attention to
what's working and what's not?
What feels good 
and what does not?
Keep showing up so that we can
provide ourself the ample time
to simply pay 
attention and notice.
Go ahead and flip the hands
down if you haven't already.
If there's any movement here,
you want to take,
a little gentle twist 
or hugging of the knees in,
maybe a Happy Baby, maybe 
a shoulder stand or a Plow,
go ahead and take it now.
Otherwise, join me in a 
little bit of stillness here,
relaxing the weight of 
the body into the earth.
Often the first thing 
on the agenda to go
is this time for yourself.
The
small but important moments
you carve out for self care.
It's through this journey, Home,
and this commitment that we've
made together that 
I really feel the importance.
I'm reminded of just how
beautiful and important it is
for us to keep this 
appointment with ourself.
Daily.
When you're ready, inhale, 
bring the palms together
and let's bring the thumbs 
right up to that third eye.
We end this ritual by 
taking a deep breath in.
And honoring that we both
kept this appointment today.
Let's whisper
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
