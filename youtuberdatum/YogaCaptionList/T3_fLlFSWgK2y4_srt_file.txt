- Hello everyone.
Welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and this is Benji
and we're so glad you are here.
Today, we have a
practice for uncertainty.
Hop into something
comfy and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Hello everyone.
Alright, let's start in
a nice comfortable seat.
You can use your blanket
or a towel to sit up on here
and we're gonna
just jump right in
by coming into a position
where you can sit up tall,
find length in the spine.
Begin to relax your shoulders.
You can close your eyes here
or soften your gaze down,
maybe gently past the nose.
Tucking the chin slightly,
feeling a lengthening
through the back of the neck.
Take a moment to get settled in,
softening through the fingers.
Noticing if you're holding 
or clenching and the jaw,
maybe a little bit
of a furrowed brow.
Just start to notice really,
and then respond.
Maybe you're
gripping in the toes,
or the ankles, or the glutes.
So I just want
to remind you that
this practice is designed to
meet you wherever you are today
in a major way.
So whatever you're 
coming to the mat with,
it's all good.
So glad you're here.
Thank you for sharing your
time and your energy with me.
Hands are resting
gently on the knees here,
or the tops of the thighs.
Just taking another moment
here to notice where you are,
how you're feeling in your body.
Again, notice if
anything is kind of clenching,
or feels like it's being 
held tight, clenched.
And just begin to
notice and maybe soften.
Then as you're ready,
maybe you've already begun to
notice your breath, to become 
a little more attentive
to the quality of your
breathing today in this moment,
knowing that, 
of course, it can change
and likely will change
throughout this practice.
And then nice and easy,
we're gonna bring the
right hand to the low belly
and the left hand right
to the center of the chest,
the heart space.
Now see if you can
gently deepen your breath.
Deeper, longer, 
slower inhalations, practice.
And a nice long,
full and slow exhale.
Whether you are fresh
off a 30 day yoga journey,
or returning to
practice after a hiatus,
or maybe this is new for you,
think of the invitation 
to deepen your breath
and get curious
about your breath here,
think of it as meeting or
reuniting with an old friend.
So it's this relationship
that is always there,
it's always been there.
And we're just reconnecting
to the quality of
that relationship.
Nurturing it by
slowing down our inhalations,
slowing down the exhalations.
Now we're gonna get
moving here in a second,
but just give yourself 
a couple more beats,
maybe three more
cycles of breath.
You can count
them out if you like.
Where you close your eyes
and see if you can
breathe a little deeper
down into the
belly on the inhale.
And a nice, slow controlled
release as you exhale.
Breathing practice
is such a wonderful way
of acknowledging
how you're feeling.
(chuckles)
Acknowledging where you are.
And this can be incredibly
valuable in uncertain times.
Times where our
relationship to the future
can affect how we're
feeling in the present.
Now draw your hands together.
Anjali Mudra at
the heart space here
and begin to really
press the palms together,
elbows move left to right
and you're gonna try
to do this while keeping
your shoulder blades,
your scaps drawing down.
And we're gonna
start to lift the chest,
maybe get a little bit
longer in the side waist.
Lifting up through 
the front body,
grounding through the back body.
Then all together now,
we're gonna take a deep
breath in through the nose,
Here we go, inhale.
And exhale out
through the mouth.
Again, in through the nose.
And out through the mouth,
nice active arms here.
And one more time,
this time we'll seal
the lips on the exhale.
Inhale in through the nose.
And exhale through 
the nose slowly.
Beautiful, release
the hands, palms face up,
just take a second
to notice how you feel.
Again, a lot of this
practice is just remembering
to acknowledge how you feel,
how you really feel.
Practice is such a wonderful thing,
regular practice, to have
in irregular times.
Having a nice, regular routine,
so let's keep it up.
Alright, so we're
gonna actually come
off the blanket or towel here,
put it to the side for later
and we're gonna
come to lie on our backs.
And when you do, right away,
hug the knees up to
the chest, nice and slow,
and feel your spine
supported on the earth.
There's no rush here.
Deepen your breath.
Maybe close your eyes again
and listen to
your body, of course,
but see what feels best here
as you gently draw the
knees in towards the chest.
So at your comfort level.
Breathing deep.
And we'll slide the palms to
the knees and nice and slow,
we're gonna take
the knees all the way out,
so the arms are extended,
peek at me if you need to here.
And then we're 
gonna take the knees wide
and then draw them
back in to the chest.
And then out, wide,
and in.
And moving like this,
as you synchronize,
maybe with a
little inhale and exhale.
And then reversing the circle.
And then draw the
knees in towards the chest,
keep the hands on the knees
and we're going to
take a deep breath in
and then on the exhale,
we're going to let something go.
You don't even
have to identify it,
just be open to
letting something go.
Ready? Here we go, 
deep breath in.
And exhale.
As you let it go,
release the hands,
bring the feet to the earth,
hands come to the belly
and relax the shoulders.
Nice, so from here,
we're gonna extend
the left leg out long
and you're gonna
take your right foot
all the way up towards
the ceiling or the sky
and that right knee may
need to stay nice and bent.
If you can straighten
that leg, then great.
Hands are still on the belly
and you might feel your
abdominals turn on, hello.
We're gonna
flex through both feet,
so you're really
pressing through the heels.
Again, feel free to
bend that right knee
as much as you like.
Resist the
temptation here at the start
to grab your leg and hold.
We're gonna try to
just connect to center here,
breathing.
Good, and then
bend the right knee,
right foot comes to the earth.
Bend the left
knee and we switch.
Extending the right leg out long
and right foot up toward,
excuse me,
left foot up towards the sky.
Again, you can keep
that left knee bent.
Drawing down through
the left hip crease,
flexing through the feet,
so feel the low
back get kind of long
as your abdominals engage.
You can feel your center here.
Notice if the shoulders
have started to clench and lift.
People always ask me to do like,
can you do more advanced,
more complicated things?
I'm like, this is
pretty complicated,
if you're really 
working at a certain level
in my opinion.
Take one more breath.
Exhale, bend the left knee,
bring the left
foot to the ground.
Bend both knees,
both feet on the earth.
Now extend the left leg,
right leg to the sky.
This time we will
interlace the fingertips
behind the back 
of the right thigh,
right hamstring here.
Let the right hip
crease get heavy.
Close your eyes.
Nice active feet here.
If you want to point the
toes here, you can, of course.
Breathing deep.
Then release the hands first,
reach your right fingertips
towards the, excuse me,
reach both fingertips
towards the right toes,
keep your core engaged as
you send the left leg up,
both feet are up,
both fingertip,
both hands are
reaching towards the toes
and then we'll
send the right leg out.
And interlacing the fingertips
behind the left thigh,
breathe deep here,
nice therapeutic posture with
core engagement.
Let this be a
grounding time for you.
Acknowledging how
you're really feeling
and using the breath
to move, move it around.
And release the bind.
Send your hands, 
fingertips spread,
towards the lift toes.
Here we go again,
core is engaged,
we're gonna lift 
the right foot up.
Beautiful, beautiful. 
Nice and easy, inhale in.
Exhale, baby pulses 
here towards the toes.
So head, neck, shoulders lift.
Keep the skin of
the face nice and soft,
just a little stimulation.
Strengthening for the core.
Nice and easy.
We'll keep it going for ten
nine,
eight,
seven.
Stick with it, six.
Five,
four,
three,
two,
and one, nice.
Hug the knees into the chest,
take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
Great, slide the hands
to the backs of the thighs.
We're gonna rock and roll now
up and down the
length of the spine.
If it feels awesome,
maybe you do a couple.
If it feels scary,
maybe you do a couple.
And we'll meet all the way up
in a nice cross-legged seat.
Head over heart,
heart over pelvis.
Nice, easy twist to the left.
You're gonna take the
right hand to the left knee,
left fingertips behind.
Inhale in deeply.
Exhale completely,
relax the shoulders.
Then over to the right,
left hand to the right knee,
right fingertips behind.
Sit up nice and tall,
inhale deeply.
And exhale completely.
Nice, easy twist here.
Alright, come back to center.
Let's keep the
momentum going forward.
So from here, we're
gonna rock onto all fours,
walk the knees
underneath the hips,
wrists underneath the shoulders.
If you need to center yourself
on the mat a little bit here,
go ahead and back it up.
And then dropping
the belly to inhale,
open the chest, look forward.
Exhale, rounding
through chin to chest,
warming up the spine.
Inhale, drop the belly,
open the heart.
And exhale,
tucking the tailbone,
pressing into the fingertips,
lifting the chest up to the sky.
And one more time.
Inhale, drop the belly.
And exhale, rounding through.
Nice, from here, come
to Tabletop Position.
We're gonna kick the
right foot out, inhale in.
Exhale, nose to knee,
round it through.
Inhale, kick it out,
neck is nice and long.
Exhale, round it through.
Nice and slow.
Inhale, extend,
spread the right toes,
neck is nice and long.
Exhale, reel it in.
One more, pressing into
both palms evenly, inhale.
And exhale,
finding that contraction
through the center, abdominals.
Sweet, and then release.
Right away, second side.
Left foot extends, inhale.
Exhale, round it through.
Inhale, extend.
And exhale, round it through,
inhale, extend, pressing into
both palms evenly.
And exhale.
Last one, inhale to extend.
And exhale to contract.
Beautiful, both knees
come down to the ground.
We're gonna walk them
as wide as the yoga mat,
the big toes to touch,
send the hips back,
fingertips forward,
Extended Child's Pose.
If this is giving you fussiness
in the front body or in the neck,
shoulders, the upper back,
you can use your prop,
whatever you brought
as a blanket, towel,
anything that's handy to
lift the earth up to you here
so that you may
rest your forehead.
Or, of course, the
forehead is on the ground
and together, we will 
all close the eyes
and return to this 
interest in our friend,
the breath.
Listen to the
sound of your breath.
See if you can slow
down the inhalation
and slow down the exhalation.
Feel the weight of
your body on the earth.
Imagine your yoga mat,
or whatever surface
you're practicing on,
imagine it rising up
to meet your hands,
to meet your head,
to meet your heart,
supporting you in this moment.
Inhale in deeply.
Exhale to lift the head.
You can open the eyes and
take a look at your hands,
you're gonna lift just
the center of the palms up,
so we're lifting the wrists,
we're pressing into
the fingertips firmly.
And keep the
legs where they are,
you're gonna walk the fingertips
all the way over
to the right side.
You're gonna feel
this hopefully awesome,
or generous at least
stretch in the left side waist.
And then you might stay here
lifted and engaged in the core,
or you might
begin to bow the head,
dropping the weight of
the head, chin to chest here.
Think about pulling back
through your left hip crease.
Breathing into the left
low back, side waist,
left armpit chest.
Nice, press into the tops
of the feet for stability.
Draw your navel in and up
for a nice core engagement
as you come back to center
and then you're going to walk it 
all the way to the other side.
Breathing
and you might keep
the head lifted here,
pulling the
right hip crease back,
or you might bow the
weight of the head down.
Gently pulling back
through that right hip crease.
Alrighty and then 
from center, bring it back,
hands flat on
the mat, here we go.
Lifting the
heart all the way up,
walking the knees
underneath the hips,
curling the toes under
and when you're ready,
gently lifting the
hips up high and back
for Downward Facing Dog.
Begin to pedal it out.
Continue to deepen 
your breath so
as much as you can stay
in control of your breath here.
Stay curious with your breath.
Let's find a little
flexibility through the foot,
through the ankle, by bending
one knee and then the other.
And then when you're ready,
we'll just continue 
to bend the knees,
walking all the way up
to the front of the mat.
We'll land in a Forward Fold,
feet hip width apart,
or Flush together,
I'll let you decide
and we're gonna take
a second here to really
become so obsessed with
what's going on in the feet,
so spread awareness
through all four corners.
So you can think about
really anchoring through
the ball joint of the
big toe and the pinky toe
and then the back two
corners of the heels.
So just a little
awareness goes a long way.
Just think about really rooting
through all four
corners of your foot
and then you'll start
to draw a little energy
up from the arches.
Make sure you're not
holding in the head and neck,
so just shake a
little yes and no.
And then when you're ready,
bend the knees generously,
send the hips back, back, back.
Find that
connection to your core
that we've already established
and use that to
roll up nice and slow.
Mountain Pose, here we are.
Stand up nice and tall
and really feel that
connection with your feet.
I know it's like, well,
what do you mean?
It's really just
about the awareness
and how you respond
may surprise you.
One great action is
drawing energy from the arches.
Lifting up through the chest,
feeling weight in the heels.
And if you are moving a
lot here, just notice that
and see if you can
capture a moment of stillness
as we breathe in.
And out.
And on your next inhale,
we'll reach the
hands up towards the sky.
And nice exhale to come all
the way back down into the fold.
Inhale, lift up halfway,
bring your hands to
your waistline here,
draw the
shoulder blades together,
don't lock out the knees here,
so keep them slightly bent
and then peek at
me if you need to,
if the elbows are
dropping down here,
start to open up through
the chest and just notice
if the chest is feeling
tight here, you're not alone.
Good, then release that,
Forward Fold,
fingertips come to the earth
and we're gonna just
step the right toes back,
just the right toes.
Then lower the
right knee to the earth.
Left knee is stacked
over that left ankle.
Benji's back, 
he's looking like a little deer.
Alright, from here, we're
gonna bring the left elbow
to the top of the left thigh
and then the right hand's 
going to come behind
to the small of the back,
the back of your right palm
right here on the
small of the back.
Good, and then 
just notice if you're
collapsing in the
left shoulder here,
give yourself some space.
Breathing in and
then open the chest,
send your gaze forward.
Now listen carefully, squeeze
the inner thighs together,
feel this lift up from
the pelvic floor here.
We call this Mula Bandha.
Activating those muscles,
the pelvic floor,
we're also stimulating
like the, the root chakra,
this energy
center of security.
Makes us feel safe and held,
even in the tough times,
the uncertainty.
Alright, should feel
like you're working here,
so if you're not, just
notice if you're collapsing,
see if you can kind of press
up and out of your foundation.
Again, lifting
from the pelvic floor.
You can think about
kind of a scissor effect
lifting you up
from the pelvic floor.
You might feel it
in your right quad.
Alright, inhale in here.
Exhale to release that.
We're gonna bring
the right hand to the earth
and left fingertips to the sky.
Big twist here, 
option to lift that right knee,
so it's just an option.
You can stay here.
So squeeze the
legs together again.
So if the left
knee's coming out,
bring it back in
over that ankle,
send the right heel
all the way to the back
if that knee is lifted.
And again, start to notice
sensation in the left pec,
the chest, as we
begin to open it up.
Inhale in, nice long neck.
Exhale, bring it down,
hand to earth.
Step the left toes back,
so we're either on our
knees or knees are lifted here,
so we're Half Plank, or full,
top of a pushup or half pushup.
You got this.
Reach the heels back
if the knees are lifted,
everyone draw the
navel up towards the spine.
Hug the low ribs in,
press away from the yoga mat,
shift forward, 
look forward, breathe in.
And then exhale all the
way to the belly with control,
best you can.
Drag the hands in
line with the rib cage.
Squeeze the elbows
into the side body.
Root down through
your foundation here,
tops of the feet, pelvic floor,
or excuse me, pubic bone.
Same thing, (laughs) 
just kidding.
And here we go, 
inhale, baby Cobra,
nice and easy, nice and low.
Find the integrity 
of your practice.
Build it nice and
slow with your breath.
Release, forehead to the earth.
Let's go again.
Inhale, lift it up,
Cobra.
And exhale to release.
And once more, inhale, Cobra.
This time to just
kind of test it out,
we're going to lift the hands,
palms face up to the sky.
And you should be
able to still breathe here.
And release.
From here, forehead comes down,
we'll curl the toes under,
inhale in deeply.
Exhale to press up to
top of a pushup, Plank Pose.
Quietly whisper to yourself,
I am strong.
And you are, you can do hard
things even in uncertain times.
Hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog,
roll with me,
inhale in deeply.
Exhale completely.
Baby steps to the top
of the mat, nice and easy.
Make your way there.
Shake the head yes and no.
Inhale, lift the spine halfway,
hands come in line
with the, excuse me,
hands come to the waistline,
shoulder blades draw together,
elbows nice and wide.
We're not locked
out in the knees,
crown of the head
reaching forward,
hip creases reaching back.
Inhale in here.
And exhale to let it all go.
Forward Fold.
Fingertips come to the earth.
Step the left toes back, lower
the left knee to the ground.
Check your alignment,
front knee over front ankle.
This is gonna want to
come out, so that's why we,
we really pay
attention to the foot first.
Right, grounding 
through the feet.
And then from there, we can
stack the knee over the ankle.
Not just for beginners,
I see it all the time,
kind of a wonky foundation
in these fun and
interesting poses,
so great way to ground
yourself is by 
anchoring the mind
in the details of
your asana practice, right?
Action, alignment.
Remembering the
breath comes first.
Here we go.
Right elbow to top
of the right thigh.
Find this lift from the
pelvic floor, breathe in.
As you breathe out,
take the left hand now
to the small of the back.
The back of the left hand
comes to the sacral area here.
And you'll know,
you'll know, right?
I designed this practice so I know,
but you'll know, right,
if you're kind of collapsing,
you're dumping,
maybe you're very
flexible here in the hips,
or maybe the shoulder's here,
it's really about awareness
and it's about when
you're down and crumpled
and uncomfortable, do we
have the awareness to notice A,
and B, can we find the energy,
that self-care
to create more
efficiency in our shapes,
to bring more ease to the body,
to pay better attention
to our breath, et cetera.
So we're lifting up
from the pelvic floor here.
We're finding that scissor.
There's a lot of work.
This isn't like show-y work,
this is inner work
and I think it is what we
are being asked to do right now,
so way to stick
with it, breathe.
You're also
strengthening the legs,
you're strengthening that glute,
we're opening the hips.
Beautiful.
Take one more breath,
you got it.
Maybe looking forward.
And then slow and steady,
don't lose this
connection in the pelvic floor,
that nice root chakra.
We're gonna release,
keep that lifted.
Pull the right hip crease back.
Left hand to the earth,
right fingertips to the sky
for your twist.
Back knee can stay on the
ground or we can lift it up,
really reaching the left heel
towards the back
edge of the mat.
Open up through the chest,
open your heart.
I know it's hard.
We've been letting our heart
soften when things get tough.
It happens naturally,
so we're gonna
counterbalance that
by opening up the chest
briefly here, inhale in.
And exhale to bring it down,
both hands on the mat.
Step the right toes back.
Plank or Half Plank,
if you haven't given
the full pushup a try yet,
go ahead and do it now,
you can do hard things.
Lift the knees,
reach the heels back.
We're only here for one breath.
Inhale, look forward.
And exhale to
slowly down to the belly.
Drag the hands in
line with the rib cage,
press firmly into
the tops of the feet.
Inhale, baby Cobra.
Exhale to release.
Inhale in again, Cobra,
maybe it grows a little.
And exhale to release.
And now this one, just
follow the wave of your breath,
listen to the sound.
Then from here we'll curl the
toes under, inhale in deeply.
Feel your belly on the earth
as you breathe in and exhale,
top of a pushup, heels back,
shoulder blades
move left to right.
You're creating a doming effect
kind of in the upper back body.
Should feel that
connection to your core,
soften the skin of the face.
Close your eyes
if you need to here
to whisper to yourself,
I am strong.
Hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog, nice work.
Find stillness here in your dog.
Take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
Bend both knees, 
carve a line with your nose.
Inhale, look forward.
Exhale to walk, step, 
hop to the top of the mat.
This time, feet together,
really together if you can,
give it a try.
Nice, and then we're
gonna take the hands now
to the backs of the back
of the calf, or the ankle
and draw the elbows in
and bend your knees as
generously as you need to
as we come into this standing
Forward Fold, Uttanasana.
So we're folding in.
Legs might shake a little here.
Find that nice connection
through all four
corners of the feet
to ground you, 
to root you, hang on.
Now slide the
hands to the waistline.
Draw the 
shoulder blades together,
elbows nice and wide.
Inhale in, 
ground through the feet.
As you exhale, root to rise, 
stand up, open the chest.
Lift your heart, Mountain Pose.
Fingertips are gonna
go down to come up
as you inhale,
reach for the sky.
Soft bend in the knees as
we continue to lift the heart,
bend the elbows,
lean back just a bit.
You can always bring the
hands to the small of the back,
just like we did
before for more support,
otherwise nice
football goalpost arms here,
cactus arms, 
as we lift the chest.
So brave to open your heart,
keep an open mind.
Then dig into the heels,
reach the fingertips high up,
nice and tall Mountain Pose,
or Volcano Pose here.
And then slow and steady,
bring the palms together
and exhale as you
Forward Fold all the way down.
Good, from here,
plant the palms,
step one foot back,
then the other, Plank Pose.
Turn onto the outer
edge of your right foot,
inner arch of your left foot.
And then bring your left
hand to the waistline here,
side Plank.
Lift the hips up.
You have options here.
You can take the left
hand behind as we did before.
You can take the left
fingertips up towards the sky.
You can stack the feet, maybe
take another variation here.
Breathe deep.
You can also bend that top knee,
left knee is a
little kickstand here.
Everyone lift your
right hip up from the earth
a little more,
maybe an inch more.
And then release,
come back to center,
let's take it to the other side.
Left hand roots us,
we turn onto the outer
edge of the left foot,
inner arch of the right foot.
Right hand comes
to the waistline.
We lift the hips up,
engage those obliques.
Breathe deep.
From here, we can 
take the right hand
to the small of the back.
Maybe up towards the sky.
Maybe we stack the feet.
Maybe we take the
arm up and overhead.
Find a variation that
rocks your world today.
Meet your appropriate edge.
And then slow and steady,
we'll come all the
way back to center.
Inhale to look forward,
shift forward,
exhale to lower all
the way to the belly.
Inhale to open the chest
for Cobra or Upward Facing Dog.
And exhale to make
your way into Child's Pose.
This time, knees together.
Breathe it out.
Whatever that means to you.
Close your eyes
if you need to here,
soften your jaw.
Can keep the
arms reaching forward,
or if it's calling to you
to bring the fingertips 
back towards the toes
and allow the weight of the
shoulders to round and fall,
then go ahead and
make it happen.
Inhale in deeply here.
See if you can feel the
skin of your back stretch
as you breathe in.
And soften as you breathe out.
So we'll continue to
slow down the breath.
Taking fewer breaths 
here to slow our pace.
Nice, conscious breathing
with control.
And that same Mula Bandha,
that pelvic floor lift,
from there, you're
gonna actually begin
to keep the feet on 
the ground but lift the hips.
And as you do that,
you're gonna bring
the fingertips to interlace,
so we're keeping 
the knees together,
feet on the ground.
You're gonna rock onto
the crown of your head.
If this feels all right for you,
you're gonna draw the
shoulder blades together.
Start to open up the
chest for Bunny Posture.
We send the
knuckles up towards the sky.
I'm not crashing all of
my weight into my head.
I'm very much pressing
into the tops of the feet.
Lifting up from
the pelvic floor,
drawing my navel up and in,
just like we did in
those contractions earlier.
Think Cat Pose, drawing the
navel up towards the spine.
Take a couple
breaths here, Bunny Posture.
And if you can't find
that slow controlled breath,
then you'll need to
maybe just take a step back
out of the full posture
and come into a variation
where maybe the
heart is melting down,
but we're just
reaching the knuckles
towards the back
edge of the mat.
Can peek at me
now if you need to.
If you're in Bunny Posture,
take one more
cycle of breath here.
You're doing great.
Everyone, lift the pelvic floor.
You're doing 
wonderful, everyone.
Way to stick with your breath.
Now with control, everyone,
nice and slow,
release the fingertips,
come back down through
Extended Child's Pose,
or rather with the fingertips
extended in Child's Pose
and a nice and easy
lift up from your center.
The heart lifts forward.
You're gonna swing the
legs to one side, any side
and very slow, in slow motion,
come through to a seat,
extending the legs
out in front of you.
Bring your hands to your center,
your abdominal wall,
just to kind of engages
the core, lift up from there
lifting the chest.
And then fingertips or
palms to the earth, Dundasana.
Stick Pose or Staff Pose.
Head over heart,
heart over pelvis here.
If we are working
on our flexibility,
which we all are,
definitely don't have
to be flexible to do yoga,
bend those knees.
Deep breath in.
Long breath out.
Bring the hands to
the backs of the thighs.
You're gonna come
to your back now here,
you can choose
how you get there.
We're gonna snuggle 
the shoulder blades
underneath the heart space here.
Walk the heels up,
knees up towards the sky,
feet flat on the ground,
find that four corner connection.
(laughs)
And here we go for Bridge Pose.
Pressing the palms into
the earth nice and slow.
Try to be as articulate
in the spine as possible.
Just get curious 
about the journey that is
going on here as you 
lift the hip points up high,
Shins forward.
And slowly we lift, 
lift, lift, lift.
Sits bones reaching
towards the backs of the knees,
shins forward, lift your chest
to your chin, chin to the sky
and you might
interlace the fingertips here.
Drawing the
shoulder blades together.
Breathing wide
into all four corners,
excuse me, all four
sides of the torso.
Pressing into all
four corners of the feet.
And then inhaling in here,
engaging the glutes and
using your exhale to slowly
and with control, again,
stay curious just
about this little ride,
this journey from
point A to point B
as you slowly release and
bring it back down to the earth.
Let's do it one more time.
Press the palms into the earth.
All four corners of the
feet into the earth, here we go.
Following the
sound of your breath.
And this time maybe
you bend the elbows,
send the fingertips
up towards the sky.
Maybe you take the
thumbs behind the hips here.
Taking the bind.
Maybe you challenge yourself
by lifting one leg up to
the sky and then the other.
So make it your own here.
We're here for three to
five breaths, you got it.
Chest to chin, chin to sky.
Nice, strong muscles of
the low body turned on here.
And then when you're ready,
slowly and with control,
releasing back
down to the earth.
Walk the feet together,
open the knees wide,
let your hands rest
lovingly on your belly.
Knees come wide here in
a reclined Cobbler's Pose.
Take a deep breath in.
It's time to relax.
Exhale, let it go.
Close your eyes.
And just relax here
in this passive stretch.
If this is too intense for you,
you can go one leg at a time,
lifting one knee to center.
You can also bring
blankets or towels
to the outer edge of your legs
for a little
supportive posture here.
Return to your breath.
And then nice and slow,
we'll bring the knees together,
hug the knees up into the chest.
And extend the left leg out,
hug the right knee in.
Take a deep breath in.
And exhale,
guiding the right knee
over towards the
left side of the mat,
or opening up
through the right arm
for a nice supine twist.
Twist.
Okay, breathe into the rib cage.
Nice, wide, lateral breath here.
You know what to do.
Give the thinking mind a break,
stay focused on 
this beautiful, slow
breath.
And then nice and easy,
guide it back to center.
Hug both knees into the chest.
And then extend
the right leg out long.
And when you're ready, left
knee over towards the right.
We open up through 
the left arm, left chest
and we breathe.
We breathe fully, deeply,
with nice awareness,
Sending that inhale 
down into the belly.
Nice and slow, filling the lungs
and the nice and with control,
exhaling.
It's all about the breath.
Alright, bring it
back to center.
Creaky old floor.
How's it going?
Hug both knees into the chest.
Take a deep breath in.
Long breath out.
Happy Baby Posture,
so you're gonna grab
the outer edges of the feet,
or the inner arches, 
kick the soles of the feet up,
send the tailbone towards
the front edge of your mat.
If this is too much, you
can just do one leg at a time,
a little Stirrup Posture here.
Find what feels good here.
Way to show up for yourself.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Release the feet.
You can windshield
wiper the knees if you like.
We're gonna extend
the legs out long.
We're gonna grab
the blanket or the towel
and we're gonna
either use it as a pillow,
or for little grounding comfort.
I'm going to place
it over the pelvis.
In honor of today's theme
and we're gonna allow the arms
to rest gently at your sides.
Come into Shavasana,
tuck your chin into your chest.
Take a deep breath
in and as you exhale,
relax the weight of your body
completely and
fully into the earth.
Now you can let go of
the controlled breathing
and just breathe, nice and easy,
honoring whatever
natural rhythm comes here.
Relax your shoulders.
This practice is
about to wrap up,
so just give yourself
one more moment or two
to really acknowledge 
how you're feeling.
Notice the sensations 
in your body.
Acknowledging any
thoughts that come here.
And finally, finding
comfort in your breath
always being there.
Thank you for taking
the time to practice today,
for sharing it with me
and all the beautiful people
practicing together
around the world today.
I do believe we
are better together,
so thank you for
connecting to yourself
and to others in this way.
Now gently draw
the palms together.
You can bring the thumbs
right up to the forehead here.
To the teacher within.
Honoring that intuition.
Way to show up for yourself.
And by showing up for yourself,
you're most certainly
influencing the way
you show up for others,
so I thank you from
the bottom of my heart.
Take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out
to close the practice.
With an invitation to whisper,
Namaste.
(uplifting music)
