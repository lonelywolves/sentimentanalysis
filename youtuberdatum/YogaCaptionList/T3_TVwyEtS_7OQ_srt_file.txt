- Hello everyone.
Welcome to BREATH, 
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 30.
We made it.
Today's practice is 
an acknowledgment
that the breath is 
always there for you
when you need to start again.
And if you're 
unsure of how to begin,
always start with a new breath.
So it's a Day 30 
Yoga With Adriene tradition
that I actually take my mic off
and I'm gonna 
practice with you.
Don't panic. 
You have the vocabulary.
You have the connection 
to allow one breath
to lead you to the next. Right?
One present moment 
leading you to the next.
If all you do is lay down 
on your mat and breathe
for the duration 
of the practice,
I think that's great.
But I think that you'll find 
that you have the curiosity
and the energy, the interest 
and the trust in yourself
to find what feels good 
and create a whole practice
with a nice clean and fulfilling
beginning, middle and end.
It's our final day 
of the journey
but in every ending 
is a new beginning
and we can always 
start with the breath.
I'm getting emotional because
I just think this is 
such an incredible thing
for all of us to say yes to
and I hope that it inspires 
you well beyond today
to keep returning 
to your breath,
returning to your practice,
and returning to yourself.
So hop into something comfy
and let's get started.
