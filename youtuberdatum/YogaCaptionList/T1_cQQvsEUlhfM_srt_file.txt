- Hi, everyone.
Welcome to Home, 
your 30-day yoga journey.
It's Day 19.
Drum roll, please.
(drumming)
Balance.
Let's get started.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alrighty, my friends,
let's begin in a
nice, comfortable seat.
Welcome back.
As your ready, 
sit up nice and tall.
Close your eyes and just
take a moment here to tune in.
Notice how you feelin' today.
Go ahead and use this moment
to acknowledge whatever it took
(chuckles) to get here.
Some days a bit easier.
Some days a bit more difficult.
But perhaps it is true that
the hardest part is now over.
You're here, 
you've pressed play,
you've landed
and you can allow
the practice to do its thing,
simply be present
as best you can along the way.
We'll, of course, use our breath
as a tool to anchor
one present moment 
leading to the next.
Take a deep breath in here.
Inhale, big, big, big, big, big.
And exhale nice and slow,
long breath out.
Inhale, big, big, big, big, big.
Lift your heart, lift your head.
And exhale long,
slow breath out.
And one more cycle,
this time just notice where 
you might be clenching.
Just kind of a 
pattern or habitual thing,
or maybe it's really
a bit of tension 
in the body today.
Big breath in if 
you haven't already.
And then use your exhale to
really soften any areas that you
might feel like you 
are holding or clenching.
Cool. Then we'll 
slowly open the eyes.
We're gonna bring the 
fingertips to our sides.
We're going to bring back
this little synchronization.
Pull the pinkies back 
and when you're ready,
inhale, here we go, 
lifting the arms up halfway.
So wrists are in 
line with the shoulders.
Exhale, palms come together.
Today as you bring the palms
together think about lifting
your sternum up 
to meet your thumbs.
So we're reinforcing that lift.
Chin to chest keep 
the sternum lifted,
even though 
you're bowing the head.
And then inhale, reach 
fingertips all the way up.
Think about reaching 
from your side waist.
Side waist to the shoulders,
shoulder to the elbow,
elbow to the wrist, wrist 
to the fingers and beyond.
And then exhale, 
press it down with energy,
here we go.
All the way to the earth.
Inhale.
Fingertips reach out.
Exhale, hands come together.
Namaste.
Chin to chest.
Reach behind.
Inhale, long puppy belly.
Think long 
belly as you reach up.
Exhale, float it down.
Inhale.
Fingertips left to right.
Exhale, palms 
together in prayer.
Chin to chest, reach behind.
Inhale, all the way up.
And exhale float it down.
Marrying the 
action to the breath,
the breath of the action.
Reach it out, breathe in.
On your exhale 
palms come together.
Chin to chest.
Keep the heart lifted.
Inhale all the way up,
listen carefully,
reach, reach, reach.
Exhale, we're gonna 
take a twist to the left.
Right hand to the left knee,
left fingertips behind.
Try to keep the 
heart lifted here.
Tuck the chin slightly.
Inhale to sit 
up a little taller.
Exhale to draw the navel in.
Maybe gently look 
past your left shoulder.
Inhale in again, 
lift your sternum.
And exhale, slowly release,
come back to center.
Fingertips on the earth,
at your sides.
Here we go, inhale.
Send them out left to right.
Exhale, palms come together.
Namaste.
Chin to chest.
Reach behind.
Big inhale.
Long belly reach, reach, reach.
On the exhale, twist to
your right, nice and slow.
Ooh, my shoulder.
Inhale to lift the heart.
Exhale, little bit of 
a journey into the twist.
I'm gonna keep reminding you
there's never really any need,
I just don't see it to crank 
or push in these twists
so keep it nice and easy.
Work from the inside out.
Take your time.
Keep finding that grace.
Alright, inhale.
Use your exhale 
to bring it back.
Awesome, bring 
the palms together.
Let's bow the head to the heart.
Inhale in deeply here.
Exhale, empty it out.
Pause here.
Notice how you feel.
So sometimes a path to balance
is not in the doing all the
things that we're told
to do for our 
well-being but in the
listening or the undoing even.
So taking these moments
to really pay attention.
Again, notice where 
you might be gripping
or holding anything at all.
And then inhale, drop that
breath down into your belly.
Exhale to release 
and come forward,
Downward Facing Dog.
Take your time.
If you want to sneak in some
little Cat-Cows before you head
up that way,
you know I'm all for that.
Take your time.
Start to amp up the breath.
Make that inhale 
a little bit longer.
See if you can 
extend the exhale as well.
If you're working in some 
spinal flexion in Cat-Cow,
go ahead and make 
your way to Downward Dog.
Start to ground 
through the fingertips.
Remember, upper arm bones rotate
out and then we'll balance that
external rotation with the
inner rotation of the femurs,
the thigh bones, 
knowing of course,
that starts at the feet,
the ankles,
the shins, the knees, the hips.
Here we go.
Inhale in deeply.
Exhale, melt your heart
towards the tops of your thighs.
It's okay to bend the 
knees generously here.
Good, make sure you're not
holding in the head or the neck.
So it's one thing if 
you want to peek at me,
I got you, but then make sure
you take a couple 
solid breaths here.
Each practice in 
Downward Dog, do check in.
Make sure we're not 
gripping or holding in the neck,
cutting off that flow 
of energy to the crown.
You're here for one more breath.
You're doing great.
Excellent, tuck the chin.
Slowly shift forward into Plank.
You got this.
Walk the toes out.
Take a nice wide stance.
Make sure you're 
not too narrow here.
Hips, excuse me, toes are as
wide as the hips or wider.
Wrists underneath the shoulders.
We're gonna puff up 
through the upper back body.
We're gonna send 
the heels out, way out,
crown of the head 
reaching way forward.
Inhale in deeply here.
And exhale, bending the elbows,
lowering all the way to 
the belly with control.
Great. Press into 
the tops of the feet.
Drag the hands in 
line with the rib cage.
Squeeze those 
elbows into the side body.
Tuck the chin, inhale,
press into the pubic 
bone and roll up, Cobra.
Keep it nice and low.
And exhale, 
forehead kisses the mat.
Tuck the chin, think 
about uncurling here.
Press the pubic 
bone into the earth.
We rise up, breathe in.
Maybe Cobra 
grows a little taller.
And exhale 
forehead kisses the mat.
Keep squeezing those elbows in.
Claw through the 
fingertips and again,
inhale, we rise up,
Bhujangasana.
On the exhale it 
crests and falls.
Forehead kisses the mat.
Beautiful.
Nice and easy here, you're
gonna press up to all fours.
Inhale in, exhale,
Tabletop Position.
Walk the knees 
underneath the hip points.
Wrists still 
underneath the shoulders.
Oh, what's up creaky old floor?
Are you there?
Nope. No, okay.
(floor creaks) Oh, there we go.
Alright, that's for like O.G.
Yoga with Adriene community.
Alright, here we go.
Front body lifts up.
(floor creaks)
(laughs) Now it's 
really coming into play.
Front body lifts up to meet
the back body and peek at me if
you're confused 
about what that means.
So here I go of my beautiful
natural curvature of the spine
doing its thing with gravity.
I'm gonna draw my navel up, hug
the little ribs so that my lower
back can lengthen and it's this
feeling of kind of sucking up my
front body to meet my back body.
It's a bit of 
an odd image when
you're not like in 
the room together.
So, here we go.
Tabletop Position.
Inhale, kick the right foot out.
Keep the right toes on 
the ground here to start.
In fact, let's do a little
sawing motion front and back
just to reinforce 
this connection to Dunda.
Start to strengthen 
through the wrists.
Great, then 
we'll find stillness.
You're gonna inhale.
Exhale, lift the right heel up.
Think about keeping 
your right pinky toes dialed
down towards the ground.
Adding the left arm, inhale,
left thumb up towards 
the sky, pinky down.
Reach forward as if 
you're shaking someone's hand.
And exhale, bring it all in.
Rounding through the spine.
Good, inhale.
Extend, expand.
Exhale, draw it in.
Pressing into the top of
your left foot for stability.
Inhale, extend.
Exhale, navel 
draws up to the spine.
Beautiful.
Inhale, extend.
And exhale, draw it in.
One more, you got it.
Inhale, extend.
And exhale, draw it in.
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
Try to touch your right 
heel to your right glute.
Good and then release.
Take a second here if you need
to rotate the wrists, you can.
Okay, don't give 
up on those wrists.
You know, maybe you're not used
to being on your hands so we
can't expect it to just be 
like, oh, sensation free.
We're gonna build some 
strength and stability there.
Alright, resetting, 
finding that Tabletop.
When you're ready, inhale in.
Exhale, navel 
draws up to the spine,
neck nice and long.
Inhale, kick the left foot out.
Let's keep the left toes 
on the ground here to start.
We'll find that rocking
sensation front and back here.
This is a great time to just
check in with your hands too.
Also make sure that the upper
arm bones are rotating out.
You want your elbow creases
shining towards the front of the
room rather than being here.
Just nice, mindful of placement.
Then press into the 
top of your right foot.
Here we go.
Inhale in.
Exhale, lift up.
Left heel, left toes dialing
down towards the ground so that
hip can stay somewhat level.
Lots of awareness here.
We're not leaning into 
the right side of the body.
We're pressing 
into both palms evenly.
And then we can stay 
here working just the leg
or let's add that right 
arm if you're ready.
Inhale, extending forward.
Try to keep that 
right shoulder plugged in.
Hug the low ribs up and in.
You're doing great.
Inhale.
Exhale, bring it all in.
No need to rush here.
Inhale, extend.
Exhale, bring it in.
Inhale, extend.
Press into the top 
of your right foot.
And exhale navel draws up.
Inhale, extend.
Exhale, draw it in.
Inhale, extend.
Exhale, draw it in.
One more, finish strong.
You got it.
Inhale.
Exhale, squeeze and lift,
squeeze and lift.
Definitely defying gravity here.
Squeeze and lift.
Try to reach your left 
heel towards your left glute.
Strengthening that hamstring.
Yeah, baby.
Come back down.
Awesome. Here we go.
Bring the big toes together.
Knees as wide as the yoga mat.
Send the hips back.
Reach the fingertips forward.
We're gonna tent pole the palms.
That just is a phrase that means
put a little pole in the center
of your palm, 
lift your wrists up.
Keep your fingertips 
on the ground though.
It's almost as if 
you're clawing into the earth.
And then from here, we're gonna
draw the chin into the chest,
but keep the wrist lifted.
Should feel really good.
Press into your pinkys.
Even if the forehand doesn't
come towards the earth, 
that's alright.
Just allow the weight 
of your head to go here.
Breathe into the low back.
Breathe into the belly.
So active arms.
Beautiful, press in 
to the tops of the feet.
Plant the palms, 
slowly rise back up.
Walk the knees 
underneath the hip points,
curl the toes under 
and as you're ready,
follow your breath, 
hips up high and back.
Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale in deeply here.
Exhale, nice cleansing breath
out through the nose or mouth.
Good. Bend your knees.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale to make 
your way to the top.
You can crawl, 
baby step, hop,
float, ragdoll.
Feet together today,
really together.
You're gonna zip 
up through the legs,
feel this connection from the
arches of your feet all the way
up through your inseam.
Then bend your 
knees just slightly.
Listen carefully, think about
lifting your hip creases up
towards the sky so you feel a
little more spaciousness in
the backs of the legs.
Then clasp opposite elbow with
opposite hand and take a second
here with the legs zipped up
so you have to 
hold on to your balance.
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
Take it to one side and
then the other, nice and slow.
Keep thinking of lifting your
hip creases up high towards the
sky, zipping the legs together.
Protip, slow it down.
Alright.
Back to center.
Go ahead and release it.
Bend the knees generously.
Tuck the chin and 
slowly roll it up.
Enjoy.
Squeeze the legs together.
Open the palms forward.
Lengthen through the crown.
Take a deep breath in.
And use that exhale to
relax your shoulders 
down, down, down.
Great, lead with a thumbs here.
Inhale, palms facing each other
as if you were holding a big
beach ball up and overhead.
Volcano pose.
Zip through the legs.
Thumbs back,
pinkies forward.
Go ahead and open up here once
you land so you can create more
spaciousness in the shoulders.
Now zip up through 
the legs, inhale in.
Exhale, nice and 
slow palms kiss together.
We're gonna slice 
right down the midline today,
returning to 
this so nice and slow.
Inhale halfway 
lift your version.
Pull back with the hip creases,
reach forward with the crown.
Exhale, soften and fold.
Step the right foot back.
Just the right foot.
Back knee lowered or lifted.
Inhale, we rise up.
Palms facing each other.
Reach for the sky.
And then exhale, check it out,
we're gonna send the
fingertips to the ground.
Pull the left hip crease so
both legs are straight here.
Then bend your 
right knee, step it up,
come into that Pyramid Pose.
Inhale to find extension.
Lengthen the spine,
gaze forward.
Exhale to soften and fold in.
Take one breath here.
If this is a little too much,
you can return to this runner's
stretch that we know so well.
Alright, big inhale in and out.
Then we'll use the fingertips
on the earth and a connection to
center to come right 
back down to a nice low lunge.
Inhale, open the chest,
look forward.
Exhale to plant the palms,
step it back to Plank.
Inhale to look forward, 
come forward on the toes.
Again, remember, you can 
always lower the knees here,
but nice and 
strong in your core.
Deep breath in.
Exhale to lower all 
the way down to the belly.
Inhale, Cobra, let it grow.
And exhale to soften and fold
back down towards the earth.
Curl the toes under inhale in,
keep your gaze down.
As you exhale, 
press up to Plank.
Super strong.
Deep breath in.
Listen carefully, exhale,
lower all the way back down.
Inhale in, stay here.
Toes curled under.
Exhale, press up to Plank.
Inhale in.
Exhale, lower down to the belly.
Last one, you got this.
You are strong.
Inhale in.
Exhale, power up to 
Plank and Downward Facing Dog.
Nice work.
Shake the head.
Smell your armpit.
Stay present.
Alright, bend the knees.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale to make 
your way to the top.
Feet together, really together.
Zip up tight.
Inhale halfway lift,
your version.
Nice, long, beautiful neck.
And then exhale 
to soften and fold.
Fingertips come to the earth.
We step the left foot back.
Back knee lowered or lifted.
Inhale to rise up 
strong with your breath.
Big inhale.
Exhale, float it down.
Fingertips to the earth.
Peel back with 
the right hip crease,
straighten the front leg.
Take your time here.
When you're ready, 
step the back foot up and in,
Pyramid Pose.
Again, other option here would
be in your runner's stretch.
Nice and grounded 
through their feet.
Inhale, look forward,
find extension,
a little bit of length.
Open up through the chest.
Exhale to fold in.
Nose toward the knee.
That's just like the intention.
Don't worry if it gets there.
Cycle of breath here,
in and out.
Stay grounded through the feet.
Then find a bend 
in that front leg,
fingertips come to the earth.
We kick the left foot back 
into that nice low lunge.
Keep your core lit 
here as we open up,
inhale, look forward.
Exhale, plant the palms,
step it back.
Shifting forward,
belly to Cobra.
Nice and slow.
Use an inhale to
open your heart, lift up.
And using the 
exhale to slowly lower.
Okay, here we go.
You can do this on your knees.
Curl the toes under.
Inhale in.
Exhale, navel drives up 
to the spine as you press up,
Plank.
Top of a push-up.
Great, inhale in.
Exhale, slowly 
lower with control.
Inhale in.
Exhale, press it up.
Inhale it at the top.
Exhale, slowly 
lower with control.
Inhale in.
Exhale, press up, power up.
This time quietly 
whisper to yourself,
"I am strong."
I am strong.
Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale lots of love in here.
Exhale lots of love out.
On your next inhale 
lift the right leg up high.
Exhale, step it all the way up.
Pivot on the back foot.
Warrior II.
Leading with the left 
fingertips forward, up and back.
Sink into that front leg.
Take up space here.
Find your breath.
Then inhale, reach the right
fingertips forward, up and back.
Keep that front knee bent.
You got this.
Strong and steady.
Peaceful Warrior.
Listen carefully, 
hug the low ribs in.
Right elbow's gonna come to
the top of the right thigh,
left fingertips to the 
sky whenever you're ready.
Big breaths,
strong legs, reach it up.
Good, option to 
take their right fingertips
to the inner arch 
of the right foot.
Option to take the left
fingertips all the way forward.
Nice bright line 
from the outer edge
of the left foot 
to the left fingertips.
Breathe deep wherever you are.
Inhale, wiggle 
the left fingertips.
Exhale to bring it 
all the way back down.
Find your twist by taking the
right fingertips up towards the
sky as you breathe in.
And then use your exhale to
bring it back to the lunge.
Plant, step the right foot back.
Straight to Downward Facing
Dog or moving belly to Cobra,
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
We'll meet in 
Downward Facing Dog.
Hips up high and back.
You can also take Benji's
version of Downward 
Facing Dog right now.
(chuckles)
On your next inhale,
let's take the left leg up high.
Exhale to shift it forward,
come all the way up.
Pivot on the back foot.
Lead with right 
fingertips reaching forward.
Front knee stays bent, 
up and back, Warrior II.
Strong.
Back toes are turned in.
We're working on this connection
from the base of the spine to
the top being in a 
straight vertical line.
So if you're 
leaning forward here,
pull it back, my darlin'.
Press into the outer 
edge of your back foot.
So strong foundation.
Now that we have 
the strong foundation,
send the left 
fingertips forward,
up and back, Peaceful Warrior.
Tuck the chin slightly,
hug the low ribs in.
Then navel draws in from center.
We bring the left elbow 
to the top of the left thigh.
Right fingertips 
up towards the sky.
Extended Side Angle,
your version.
You can stay here or maybe
bring the left fingertips down.
Maybe right 
fingertips all the way up.
Creating a nice line from the
outer edge of the right foot all
the way through the side body
and out the right fingertips to
infinity and beyond.
Take a deep breath in.
You got this.
Wiggle the right fingertips.
Use your exhale to dial it all
the way back to the lunge
right in to your twist.
Right hand to the earth.
Left fingertips towards the sky.
Big breath in.
Open your heart.
And then exhale all the way out.
Plant the palms, 
step the left toes back.
Big breath in here.
Exhale with control, 
lower all the way down.
Squeeze your elbows in.
Here we go.
On the breath, 
inhale, rise up, Cobra.
And on the exhale,
it crests and
falls with control.
Awesome.
Slowly press up to all fours.
You're gonna 
walk your knees wide,
walk on the toes together,
and then curl them under.
Then walk the hands in and we're
gonna slowly lift up knees wide,
toes together.
Cool?
Alright, so we 
have options here.
First option 
everyone should take,
which is just 
to lift the corners
of the mouth just a hair.
Take a deep breath in.
Long breath out.
Notice if you're dumping 
all of your weight into your
fingertips, start to 
light up this energy that
we've been cultivating 
through this whole journey.
You got it.
So the first thing you can do is
just to start to light up that
energy and stay with like one
or two fingers on the ground.
You might get to a place where
you bring your palms together,
squeeze the heels together,
lift up from the pelvic floor,
and we come here to a toe stand.
Check it out.
So we're here 
just working, working.
Here working, working.
Squeezing, squeezing, squeezing.
Remember the 
squeezing of the legs right
from that first Mountain?
Find that here, that lift.
You can even lift your center
a hair and that might actually
help, even though it 
seems counterintuitive,
seems harder.
Okay.
And then we can 
take the palms forward.
Third option and work in
an arm balance, Bakasana.
So nice wide 
stance with the hands,
upper arm bones rotate out.
We're gonna send 
the gaze forward.
All this work we've been 
doing of Dunda lengthening,
lengthening, see ya, Benji!
Love you.
We want to keep the gaze out.
If you keep the gaze in then
you're gonna do a somersault.
So we're breathing here.
We're gonna work 
wherever we feel good today.
And I'll guide you through 
the practice of Bakasana
if we want to 
get a little taste.
So upper arm bones 
rotate out, gaze forward.
We lift the center, 
we walk the knees close
into the armpit chest.
All the work we do in the feet
so good for these asanas, right?
It's not just your 
core and your arms.
Alright, so wherever you are,
keep breathing.
Nice, long, smooth,
deep breaths.
If you want to give Crow a try
let's walk the knees 
up towards the armpit.
Keep the toes together and just
keep your gaze forward as you
find this sawing 
motion front and back.
Front and back.
And maybe this is 
all we work with today.
Working up a bit 
of tapas, a little heat.
And then maybe you find, maybe
one foot comes off the ground.
And then maybe the other.
Keep breathing.
You got it.
Just notice where you 
are today and then maybe,
maybe we lift the toes up.
Play around just for a bit.
And if you need to take 
a break, that's alright.
Deepen your breath.
And then if you're 
working in the Crow,
Bakasana, go ahead 
and come back out.
If you're in the toe stand,
let's meet everyone with the
hands back on the earth.
Then walk them out, out, out.
Feel the stretch 
in the low back.
We're gonna slowly bring the
knees back into the center,
press into your toes.
Protect the knees.
Here we go, knees kiss, soft
landing and then we're gonna
swing the legs to 
one side, any side,
and send the legs 
out long and in front.
Good, take the palms 
to the tops of the thighs,
sit up nice and tall 
as you loop the shoulders,
excuse me, forward, up and back.
Deep breath in as you 
flex your toes with your face.
And then exhale, point the toes,
slide your hands all the way
down and bow inward.
So we're not really going for
like the peanut butter 
and jelly move.
That's like O.G. yoga.
Just going for 
a bit of a reverent bow
and a gentle 
curvature in the spine.
You can totally grab a hold,
go for the gold,
but find what 
feels good, for sure, here.
Okay, a few 
closing breaths here.
If you have a little extra
time after today's practice,
you might try 
ending with Nadi Shodhana,
alternate nostril breathing.
Particularly if it's 
towards the end of the day
or if you're just 
feeling a bit anxious.
I will link to it.
Take one more deep breath in.
Use your exhale
to slowly roll up, rise up.
You can either come to lie flat
back position or cross at the
ankles and sit up nice and tall.
Take a second to scan the body.
Notice how you feel.
Then slowly 
bringing the palms together.
Thumbs up to the third eye.
Inhale lots of love in.
And exhale lots of love out.
I love this idea or just I love
when I remember on any given day
that balance is 
my natural state.
So this idea of 
coming home really to me,
it just makes a lot of sense.
I'm not trying to 
achieve my balance.
I'm trying to return back.
Back to it.
Balance is my natural state.
Let's take one 
final breath in together.
Here we go, big inhale.
And exhale to bow.
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
