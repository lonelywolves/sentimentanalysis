- What's up everyone?
Welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and this is Benji
and today we have an awesome
practice to help guide you to
awakening the artist within.
So hop into something comfy 
and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Alright, welcome.
Let's begin today's 
practice on the ground
in Extended Child's Pose.
So come on down, 
take your time getting here.
And obviously right away, I
invite you to allow the sound of
my voice to guide you here since
we're gonna come into a shape
where you'll 
want to bow the head.
Knees are gonna come 
as wide as your yoga mat.
Big toes to touch, fingertips
reaching all the way forward and
as you're ready, 
slowly come on down
melting your 
heart towards the earth.
Right away you might start 
to feel some sensations
in the spine, in the back body, 
in the shoulders, in the hips.
Meet them with a gentle breath.
In.
Then nice and easy breath out.
If this is not a comfortable
shape for you to begin in,
let's adapt.
Let's
use a little 
creative energy to
find something that feels good.
Maybe it's a nice comfortable
cross-legged seat or kneeling,
you can even begin lying down.
Start to notice 
sensations of the body.
Big ones, small ones.
Ones the size of your head.
Just kidding.
And then meet those sensations,
whatever you're noticing with a
gentle breath in
and nice and easy breath out.
If you can close your 
eyes here for a moment,
relax your jaw and 
just start to settle in.
It's a swift practice today.
One that eases in,
designed to help get 
energy moving in the body.
I would say very lovingly so but
if you want to really make the
most of this practice, 
you got to bring the breath.
So let's take a deep breath in
together in through the nose.
And exhale out through 
the nose or mouth here.
Even bigger inhale.
And nice long exhale.
Start to rock the 
forehead nice and easy,
side to side as again 
you breathe in deeply.
And exhale completely.
Awesome work.
Press into the tops of the feet,
claw through the fingertips
slowly, and nice and slow as if
you're moving 
in slow motion, rise up.
We're gonna come 
to all fours here.
Draw the wrists 
underneath the shoulders,
knees directly 
underneath the hips.
And again, 
let's bring the breath.
Ready? Here we go.
Inhale, dropping the belly.
Upper arm bones rotate out.
We look forward, we soften
through the skin of the face.
And then on an exhale,
take the navel up,
round through the spine,
chin to chest.
Really finding a nice big,
round spine.
Good, then 
dropping it to breathe in.
And lifting it to breathe out,
navel draws up.
Inhale, drop the belly,
open the chest.
Tailbone to the sky.
And exhale, tucking the tail in,
crown of the head to the earth.
Really press into 
your foundation here.
One more with the 
sound of your breath.
Nice, then inhale 
to Tabletop Position.
Claw through the fingertips,
take pressure up 
out of the wrist.
Draw your navel up so just
kind of hug the low belly in.
Hug the low ribs up and in
so just kind of creating that
connection to center.
And you're gonna 
kick your right foot out.
Dial all of the right 
toes down towards the earth.
Hair toss.
And then send your left 
fingertips forward as if you
were shaking someone's hand.
So again, you have 
to kind of find that,
that knitting of the ribs,
the abdominal wall turning on.
Hey-o, here we go, inhale.
Exhale, rounding 
through the spine,
just like Cat Pose, hug the
elbow and the knee all the way
up and in, tuck the 
chin in to the chest.
Inhale to extend, look forward.
And exhale rounding up and in.
Inhale to extend,
press into the top of 
that left foot for stability.
And exhale round,
squeeze and lift.
Inhale, all the way out.
Expansion.
Exhale, contract.
One more, inhale, expand.
And exhale, contract.
Pause here, squeeze and lift.
Try to lift your right 
here to your right glute.
I know for three, two
and release on the one, awesome.
If you need to 
take a short break
off the wrist you can here.
Reset, find your foundation.
Hug the low rips up, so I'm just
kind of drawing my low ribs up,
I'm feeling that 
connection in my core here.
I'm not dipping 
through the low back.
Peek at me if you need to.
Not dipping through the low back
but I'm lengthening the tailbone
out and drawing the navel up.
Alright, once you 
set yourself up for play,
for greatness, 
let's rock and roll.
Kicking the left foot out,
dialing the left toes down.
Hugging the midline here as
I reach the right 
fingertips forward.
We're gonna 
move with the breath.
Spread the toes, 
spread the fingertips, inhale.
Exhale, reel it 
in nice and slow.
Squeeze and lift.
Good. Inhale, extend.
Exhale, squeeze and lift.
Try to move 
from the middle here.
Navel draws up.
Good. Inhale, extend.
Exhale, with your breath,
bring it in.
Press into the 
top of the right foot,
inhale to expand.
Exhale to contract.
Slight bend in that left elbow,
not locked.
Inhale, extend.
Careful not to rush it here.
Exhale, squeeze and lift.
Inhale to extend.
Exhale, squeeze and 
lift, lift, lift, lift.
Okay, one more 
time, inhale, extend.
Spread the fingertip,
spread the toes.
Exhale, reel it in, pause here,
squeeze and lift.
You're in Cat Pose.
Try to lift your left 
heel to your left glute.
We're strengthening that 
hamstring for three, two.
Awesome, and on the one,
we release.
Listen carefully, we're 
gonna walk the hands forward.
We're gonna curl the toes under.
Inhale to drop the belly here,
look forward.
Exhale, hug the low ribs in,
lift the hips up high,
drop the heels, Down Dog.
Back to the knees, inhale.
Slow descend of the knees down.
Drop the belly, upper arm bones
rotate out here so your elbow
creases are shining forward.
And then exhale, navel draws
to the spine and we send it up,
Downward Dog.
Keep it going, inhale.
Slow descend in the knees down.
Elbow creases forward, so biceps
towards the front of your mat.
Exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale, lower the knees,
drop the belly,
open the chest.
Exhale, navel to spine.
Maybe this time you send your
gaze to your belly button here.
Good, inhale, drop the knees.
Drop the belly, open the chest.
Exhale, claw 
through the fingertips,
lift the knees, 
heavy in the heels.
Good, one more.
Inhale, drop the knee,
drop the belly, open the chest.
And exhale, lift the knees,
hips up high,
heavy in the heels, 
Downward Facing Dog.
Now pause here.
Upper arm bones are 
still externally rotated.
Turn your big toes in or turn
your toes in just a little bit
to feel that inner rotation
in the hips.
Find your breath.
Beautiful, then 
you're gonna slowly
walk the feet in toes to touch.
And then we're gonna inhale,
lift the heels.
Exhale, drop the heels.
Inhale, lift the heels.
Exhale, drop the heels.
Inhale, lift the heels.
Exhale, drop the heels and
really press away from your yoga
mat, trying to lift up from the
hip creases a little bit higher.
Good, careful to not 
hold or clench in the neck.
Good, then we're 
gonna nice and easy,
keep breathing, cross 
the right foot over the left,
and then the left 
foot over the right.
Criss-crossing all the 
way up to the top of the mat.
Take your time.
Eventually coming 
on to the fingertips.
Be kind to yourself,
no judgment,
there's many moments of 
humility in the yoga practice
and we can embrace
them instead of judge them.
I'll meet you in a Forward
Fold at the top of the mat.
Feet hip width 
apart or flush together.
If you want, you can take the
tops of the hands to the earth,
bend your knees just 
for a little wrist relief.
Shake the head yes,
shake the head no.
Keep listening to the 
sound of your breath here.
Using that nice audible breath,
maybe Ujjayi Breath.
To really bring 
your attention, your mind,
to the present.
To help move 
any stagnant energy.
Awakening the artists within.
Getting closer to 
that feeling of presence.
And that sense
of self.
That intuition, 
that intuitive state.
Alright, let's play.
Bend the knees a little more,
send the hips back.
Belly comes towards 
the tops of the thighs,
and nice and easy, 
let your fingertips
just be soft and easy.
We're gonna as 
slow as you can roll,
come to standing.
Rolling up through 
the spine nice and slow.
Try to really 
enjoy this transition.
And in general, 
in this practice today
you can think 
about the transitions.
Rising up to Mountain.
Whatever this means to you,
embodying this pose.
Fully standing up tall, 
letting go of something,
maybe, that's 
been bothering you.
Just really becoming present
with this simple shape that can
have so much depth.
Tadasana.
Spreading your awareness through
all four corners of the feet.
Reconnect with the 
sound of your breath.
So not just focusing on
the landings today,
the places where we land,
but try to focus on the 
moments in-between, right?
The moments in-between 
point A and point B.
I'll guide you but just a
little food for thought, right?
The process, 
the creative process,
the process of kind of 
following your intuition.
Letting one thing 
bleed into the next.
Trusting that.
Okay, here we go, inhale.
Spread the fingertips,
nice and easy,
reach for the sky.
Good, exhale, bend 
your knees generously.
Float it all the way down.
Soft fingers.
If you have a little pet around,
maybe you reach to 
give them some love.
If not, I'll share 
mine with you.
Alright, then let's all 
drop our heads back down.
Inhale, halfway lift, you're
gonna send the fingertips behind
you like airplane arms.
Slowly bringing some 
awareness to the heart center.
Support your low back by drawing
your navel in and up here.
We're pausing here,
we're breathing.
Reach your fingertips back,
imagine a little angel or you
can imagine your pal Adriene
coming by and just grabbing your
fingers and pulling them back a
little bit so you can create a
little more traction here.
Finding that length in the neck.
The traps, excuse me, 
yeah, the traps
actually keep your 
traps soft but your triceps
start to maybe get 
a little tired here.
We're breathing, 
we're breathing for three,
two spread the fingertips and
on the one go ahead and relax
everything down, Forward Fold.
Nice, from here, we're gonna
send just the right toes back,
just the right toes.
Lower the right 
knee to the earth.
Then you're gonna take your
right hand to the earth and
inhale, reach your left
fingertips up towards the sky.
Big breath in as you 
lengthen through the crown.
Exhale, bring it back,
frame your left 
foot with your fingers.
Good, inhale to look forward.
Exhale, shift the hips back,
pull the left hip crease back,
flex your left 
toes towards your face.
Then inhale to look forward.
Exhale to bow the 
forehead towards your left knee.
Doesn't even have to 
even come close, just towards.
Good, inhale to 
look forward again.
Exhale to roll all the 
way through that left foot.
Lift the right knee up.
We're gonna 
plant the palms here,
step the left foot back,
Plank Pose.
Good, from here, find 
that hollow front body again.
Hug the low ribs in.
Draw the navel in and up.
Even low belly kind of draws in
towards the center line here so
you feel that 
connection in your core.
We're shaking perhaps, we're
definitely creating some heat,
we're moving things 
around here for three.
Two, way to stick with it.
Look forward on the one, rock
forward on the toes squeeze the
elbows in and with control claw
through your fingertips as you
slowly lower all the 
way down to the earth.
Good, then from here, 
press into the tops of the feet.
Squeeze the elbows 
into the side body.
Inhale, lift up to Cobra,
your version.
Shouldn't feel any pain here,
tuck the chin.
Good and then exhale,
slowly lower down,
forehead to the earth.
Good, from here, 
curl the toes under,
inhale in.
Exhale, press up to Plank Pose.
Good, inhale in again here.
Strong and steady.
And then exhale, 
Downward Facing Dog.
Nice.
Walk the feet together,
really together.
Claw through the fingertips.
Press down 
through your knuckles.
Inhale, lift the heels, 
zip up through the legs.
Exhale to drop the heels.
Inhale to lift the heels,
hug the low ribs in,
connect to your core.
Exhale to drop the heels.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to lower.
Nice audible breath.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to lower.
Press into the fleshy 
part of your hand between
your index finger and thumb.
Inhale to lift.
Exhale to lower, keep it going.
Excellent.
Then drop the heels, cross
the left foot over the right.
Continue all the way 
up to the top of the mat.
Crossing one leg over the other.
Criss-cross steps all the way to
the top eventually coming on to
the fingertips and
into Forward Fold 
at the top of the mat.
Let everything go.
Good. Inhale, halfway lift.
Lengthen the crown 
straight towards the front,
tail straight towards the back.
Send the fingertips 
out airplane arms.
Slight bend in the knees.
Draw the 
shoulder blades together.
Peek at me if you need to here.
So working to create the 
sensation of a nice straight
line from the tail to the crown.
Hugging the 
front body kind of up,
kind of defying 
gravity and hugging it up,
creating a little 
tone in the abdominal wall.
Reaching fingertips back, 
pressing palms down into an
imaginary surface here.
Again, you might start to
feel your triceps turn on here.
Hey-o.
Great, we're here for three,
breathe deep.
Two, and on the 
one let everything go.
Nice. Benji did 
that sigh with me.
Alright, fingertips 
come to the earth.
This time we're gonna 
slide the left toes back.
Lower the left 
knee to the earth.
Then press left hand 
all the way into your mat.
And here we go, big twist.
Inhale, pull the right hip
crease back and let that be what
brings your right fingertips
all the way up towards the sky.
So nice twist in the spine here.
Breathe nice, 
full lateral breath.
So feel your lungs expand.
Your ribcage 
expands as you breathe in.
Good, and then 
slowly bring it back down,
frame your right 
foot as you breathe out.
Good, pull the 
right hip crease back.
Flex your right toes 
towards your face this time.
Nice runner's stretch.
Keep a slight or generous 
bend in your right knee.
And here we go, 
inhale to look forward.
Find extension.
Exhale to slowly 
bow the forehead
towards your right knee.
Keep the right hip 
crease pulling back.
Good, inhale to 
look forward again.
And exhale to roll 
through that right foot.
Awesome, lift the back knee,
plant the palms, here we go,
stepping the right foot back,
Plank Pose.
Big inhale in here, strong.
Exhale to look forward,
hug the elbows in
and slowly lower 
belly to the earth.
Inhale, Cobra, 
open your heart, lift it up.
And then exhale, 
soften and release.
All the way down.
Inhale in here.
Exhale, press up, 
power up, Plank Pose.
Inhale in again 
here, big, full breath.
And then exhale, 
Downward Facing Dog.
Awesome work.
Really, really nice.
Bend the knees, 
pedal it out here,
take a couple moments, to cycle
through your breath in and out,
in and out and just explore
what's going on in your body.
So if you really need a break,
you can come on to the knees
here, take a Child's Pose.
Maybe you start to stretch
through the fascia of the foot.
Maybe you lift one 
leg and then the other.
So little creative expression
here in Downward Facing Dog.
If you want to 
flip your Dog you can,
if you, if that's 
in your practice.
If you want to do 
it Down Dog Twist,
maybe work there.
Maybe you just embrace 
some exquisite stillness here
and let your breath move you.
Couple cycles of breath to
explore here in 
Downward Facing Dog.
Then even it out.
If you're in Child's Pose,
come back to your Dog.
And from Downward Facing 
Dog we'll bend the knees,
inhale to look forward.
And on an exhale, 
make your way to the top.
Your version.
Then inhale, halfway lift,
airplane arms.
Again, pressing into 
an imaginary surface.
Nice long, beautiful neck.
Inhale in again here, get long.
And exhale to let everything go.
Good, from here bring the 
thumbs to the hip creases.
Pull them back, shift 
weight into your heels,
bend the knees, 
send the hips back,
keep the knees bent, then
release the fingertips down to
come up, Utkatasana, Chair Pose.
So hug those low 
ribs in even here,
low back nice and long.
So careful not to really 
create tension in the traps,
in the neck and shoulders 
by going too narrow here.
You can keep it nice and open.
Really sending 
weight into the heels.
Finding length in the neck.
Notice when you want to give up,
notice where your mind goes
when things get hard.
Can you stay in the process?
Sit into it.
Lean in.
Sit back.
Observe.
Be a witness to 
what is going on.
We're here for three, 
two, listen carefully,
on the one pull 
back with the fingers.
Come back to 
those airplane arms.
You got it.
Beautiful.
Inhale to look forward.
Exhale to let everything go,
Forward Fold.
(chuckles) Benji just 
sighed out with me again.
Good, inhale in again here.
Exhale to plant the palms, step
or hop it back to Plank Pose.
Inhale to look forward,
shift forward.
Exhale, belly to Cobra or
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog,
your version.
You can play a little bit here,
we're gonna meet 
in Downward Facing Dog.
If Downward Dog's 
too much for you today,
all of these Dogs, you can 
come to little Puppy Posture.
Peek at me with the 
knees on the ground,
elbows on the ground.
Same benefits just 
a little more cooling.
And then a couple of 
cycles of breath here to play.
Really
stirring things up with a
nice long audible inhale
and a nice long audible exhale.
Alright, and then here we go.
Anchoring through 
the left heel, inhale.
Lift the right leg up high,
Three-Legged Dog.
On an exhale, step it 
all the way through up
into a nice lunge.
Keep the back knee lifted.
When you're ready,
strong legs here,
strong core, inhale,
scoop the palms 
forward, up and back.
We're coming into a 
nice high lunge here.
Pull the right hip crease back,
get down low,
bend your back knee to get your
center right underneath you.
So we want to create a nice
long line where the head and the
heart and the pelvis are stacked
and bending that back knee is
gonna really help you 
work toward that, right?
Work in that direction.
Great, we're here.
Palms are facing each other.
Thumbs back, pinkies forward.
Lots of space for 
the shoulders here,
for the neck and the 
traps to soften and relax.
Inhale, look up.
Listen carefully, exhale,
you're gonna slowly 
twist to your right.
Take the right fingertips
back, left fingertips forward.
Good, then inhale, 
straighten both legs.
Scoop the arms all the way up.
Big beach ball up and overhead.
And then exhale, 
open to the left,
Warrior II, back toes turn in.
Front knee bent.
And same thing here, 
there's gonna be a tendency
to kind of lean forward.
Think about stacking 
the head, the heart
and the pelvis all in one line.
Great.
Pulling the right 
hip crease back still.
Strong arms.
Here we go.
Inhale in.
Keep that front knee bent.
You got this.
Right fingertips reach 
forward and up
and then all the way back.
Peaceful Warrior, inhale in.
Have fun with this.
Exhale, 
cartwheel all the way down.
You're gonna go right 
into that twist we did earlier,
but this time with 
the back knee lifted.
Right fingertips reach up.
Big breath in.
Big breath out brings 
you all the way back down.
Beautiful, plant the palms,
step the right toes back.
Inhale to shift forward.
Exhale, belly to Cobra or
Chaturanga to Upward Facing Dog.
Move with your breath.
Listen to your body.
We'll meet in 
Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale in deeply here.
Take a Lion's Breath.
Nice cleansing 
breath as you breathe out.
Don't be shy.
From here, anchor 
through the right heel.
Inhale, lift the 
left leg up high,
Three-Legged Dog.
Here we go, exhale, 
step it all the way up.
Nice lunge here, 
back knee stays lifted.
We got this.
Front knee over front ankle.
Alright, connect to your core,
your center.
Here we go, pay 
attention to the transitions.
How you move matters.
Inhale, scoop the arms 
forward, up and back.
We rise up, reestablish 
that bend in that front knee.
Left hip crease pulls back.
We find our 
inner support system.
So we know the structure.
We play within the 
structure to make it work to
create our experience, right?
Co-create with your breath here.
Breathe in, feel that lift.
Breathe out, ground.
Maybe bend that back knee.
Get your center 
right underneath you.
Awesome, you're doing great.
Here we go.
Big inhale to maybe look up.
Careful not to 
crunch the back of the neck.
Exhale, keep the 
front knee bent. You got this.
Slow and steady, 
open twist to the left.
Pull that left hip crease back
just like we did in 
the runner's stretch.
Great, now we're 
gonna straighten both legs,
come back to 
center with the inhale.
So inhale, we rise up.
Fingertips reach up, we 
straighten both legs and then
exhale, dialing to 
the right, Warrior II.
Front knee over front ankle.
Back toes are turned in.
Strong legs.
Stretch, Benji.
And then here we go, 
keep that front knee bent.
We're building strength.
Meeting your appropriate
edge, reach the left fingertips
forward then up.
Create length, 
space and then back.
Peaceful Warrior, 
neck is nice and long.
Hug the low ribs 
in here, inhale.
Exhale, have some fun, cartwheel
all the way through and down.
Right hand comes to the earth,
we pivot on the back foot.
And when you're ready, inhale,
left fingertips to the sky.
Big twist.
Big breath.
Strong legs.
Inhale, lengthen 
through the crown.
Nice, long neck.
Exhale to bring it 
all the way back down.
Awesome work.
Plant the palms, 
step the left toes back.
Move through a 
little vinyasa here.
Something that feels good.
You can add on, 
you can take a break.
Make it your own.
And we're gonna meet in 
that Downward Facing Dog.
When you get there,
take the deepest breath 
you've taken all day long.
Exhale, Lion's Breath,
tongue out.
Don't be shy.
One more, just like that.
Deep breath in.
Exhale to empty it out,
let it go.
Nice, slow descend to 
the knees to kiss the earth.
Child's Pose, your version,
knees together or wide.
Or maybe you just come 
to a nice comfortable seat.
Come to a place where you
can rest and begin to relax.
Close your eyes.
And really land here, 
whatever that means to you.
Can you just kind 
of land in this moment?
Then slowly begin to surrender.
Relaxing anything that might
be holding or gripping here.
Continuing with 
your nice conscious,
full inhalations.
And these really 
awesome, even
exhalations just 
long and strong.
(chuckles)
Allow the breath 
to move you here for
just a couple quiet moments.
And then slowly we'll 
begin to open the eyes.
Claw through the fingertips and
easy breezy again pay attention
to the transitions here as
we rise back up to all fours.
We're gonna walk the knees out,
you can curl the toes under,
and just send the hips 
back and forth a couple times.
And then we can uncurl the toes
and we can just draw a couple
circles or even 
figure eights with the hips
one way and then the other.
Get a little freaky.
And then find 
your Tabletop Position.
Press in to the 
top of your left foot.
You're gonna lift 
the right knee up.
You're gonna 
send your right foot
all the way up towards the sky.
So right knee stays bent and
sole of the right 
foot towards the sky.
Careful not to lean 
on to your left side,
really hug in to that midline.
Toning the core here,
nice and easy,
and now for the right glute
we're gonna begin to pulse,
just nice and easy.
Sole of the right 
foot up towards the sky.
Now try to keep the 
shoulders nice and even here.
Pressing into both palms evenly.
Gaze straight down.
We're pulsing.
We're breathing here.
Nice and calm in the face.
Moving that energy, 
that Kundalini
throughout the body here.
Keep it going.
Pulsing.
Feeling that right glute engage.
Feeling the low belly,
draw up and in.
You're here for five,
you got this.
Four, three, stick with it.
Two, on the one, check it out,
extend the right leg,
then bend the right knee, 
bring it all the way up and in
for a One-Legged Pigeon.
Alright, flip onto 
the top of that back foot.
You're gonna bring the left
inner thigh up towards the sky.
You can keep the right heel
close in or you can work to
bring the right shin out.
But careful that 
you're not kind of putting
the cart before the horse.
Just stick with the sensation
over the shape here and you can
grow this pose in a 
way that feels good
for you and your body.
Alright, keep 
active in both feet.
So the root of this posture
is gonna be that back foot
actually, nice and strong.
Benji's chasing 
something in his dreams here.
We're gonna sit 
up nice and tall.
We're gonna keep 
the right foot active
as we slowly 
begin to melt forward.
Maybe we come 
on to the forearms.
(laughs) He's dreaming.
He's chasing a squirrel.
And then maybe we 
come on to the forehead.
We can even kind of 
bubble gum, bubble gum.
(chuckles) He's 
really having a...
'Kay, Pigeon Pose.
Can really find a place 
to rest your head is where
I'm going with that.
So, breathe deep.
Ah, the joys and sometimes the
perils of 
practicing with your pet.
Just kidding, only joy.
Peril, it can be peril,
not perils.
Anyway.
Close your eyes.
Breathe deep.
And now nice and easy,
so super slow and steady,
you're gonna 
stay here for a bit,
but see if you can find 
a soft, soft, easy rocking
that's initiated
from that right hip socket.
So rocking gently left to right.
it can be very, 
very, very subtle.
Continue to breathe.
Then press the 
palms into the earth.
Draw your navel to your spine,
tuck the chin and slowly begin
to roll it back up.
Inhale in, exhale, 
press into the palms,
come back to all fours.
If you want to do a 
Downward Dog here you can.
And we'll reset 
for the other side.
(chuckles) Take a peek at the
video here and look at Benji.
He's running.
Running, runnin', runnin'.
Okay, here we go.
From a nice strong foundation.
(laughs) Here we go, pressing
into the top of the right foot.
We're gonna kick 
the left foot up high.
Sole of the 
left foot to the sky.
I'm gonna be just aware of where
my weight is shifting here.
Trying to press 
into both palms evenly.
When you're ready, 
let's begin that pulse.
Find your breath.
Hugging on to that midline.
hugging those low ribs in.
And if you're kind of, if
this is a new thing for you,
move slow so you can really feel
what muscles you're activating
and make sure that you're not
letting any tension creep up
into the shoulders or the neck.
Gaze straight down unless you're
looking at Benji who's still
running after 
something in his dreams.
Otherwise gaze straight 
down and keep it going here.
Press into the top of 
the right foot for stability.
Feel that left 
glute start to turn on,
low belly start to 
draw up and in to support.
You're doing great.
Keep it going.
You're doing awesome for five.
Breathe deep for four.
Three, two.
And on the one, extend 
the left leg out all the way.
Then bend and draw 
it all the way up in to
One-Legged Pigeon 
on the other side.
(chuckles) Okay.
Take a look back 
at your right foot.
Ground it down.
Right inner thigh 
spirals up towards the sky.
This is the root of the posture.
Back foot strong.
Then from here, 
check your left toes,
keep them nice and active.
Inhale, think 
Cobra or Up Dog here,
find that length first.
And then you can start to play.
Maybe coming onto the forearms.
Maybe stacking the fists.
Maybe you keep it lifted or
maybe you start 
to find a soft bow.
A nice active breath here,
my dears.
Stay in it.
Bring your attention back
to the sound of your breath.
As you ready, 
invite that slow, gentle rock.
And just play with it.
Notice how this 
side is different.
And then nice and easy, we'll
bring the hands to the earth.
We'll stay nice and 
energized through the feet
and we'll rise up.
Lift the heart, 
listen carefully,
you're gonna sink on 
over to your left hip,
and you're gonna 
bring the right foot around.
Benji wakes up from his dream.
We're gonna bring the 
soles of the feet together,
Cobbler's Pose 
or Baddha Konasana.
Sit up nice and tall.
You can grab the ankles or you
can take the thumbs and start to
use the pressure of the thumbs
to just give yourself a little
foot massage, little 
reflexology moment here.
Alright, then inhale in here,
lift your chest.
Exhale, bend the 
elbows left to right.
Begin to look forward as if you
are looking down into a pond.
I always say this is 
like my Zoolander moment.
It's like, "Who am I?"
I'm looking, getting 
a reflection back.
So take a second here.
Keep a nice, long, 
beautiful neck here
so not collapsed.
Just, yeah, looking down,
creating length,
seeing your reflection.
Inhale in.
And then exhale, 
draw everything down.
Let the weight of your head drop
nice and slow and with control.
Inhale, feel the skin 
of your back body stretch.
Exhale.
Slowly begin to 
relax the shoulders
and we'll release 
and come back up.
Take your fingertips, bring them
to the outer edges of your legs.
Slowly close this chapter.
Knees kiss together, 
we're gonna lean back here,
way back nice and easy.
Good.
Then we're gonna 
slowly lift the legs,
cross one leg over.
And you're just 
gonna take whatever shape
you want with your arms.
I know.
It can be like whatever,
it can be just basic.
Can be Eagle arms.
Can be just like, (scares).
(laughs) Make someone scared.
It can be jazz hands.
Be prayer position.
Cool, then come back to center.
Cross the opposite leg over.
And then just take a 
shape with your arms.
Come on, second, second side.
Don't be shy.
Bring it back to center.
Opposite leg on top.
Here you go, get 
another chance on this side,
take a shape.
This is like the most creative
core work I've ever done.
(laughs)
Great, come back to 
center and last time,
opposite leg on top.
Take a shape.
Change it.
Great, then come back to center.
Inhale in, exhale 
forehead towards the knees.
Take the biggest I love you
breath you've taken all day.
This is it, your 
practice is coming to an end.
In every end is a new beginning.
And from my heart to yours, 
I wish you a beautiful continued
awakening of the artist within.
It's so beautiful when we are
able to recognize our creative
energy and to use it
in the way that serves.
Go ahead and lift the head,
cross the legs,
let's bring the hands 
together at the heart.
Just create a 
little energy here
by bringing the palms together.
Create a little movement here.
A little heat.
And then slowly bring the 
thumbs up to the third eye.
Inhale in.
Exhale to relax the shoulders.
Inhale in again.
And we'll exhale to 
close the practice with a bow.
Take good care everyone.
Namaste.
(upbeat music)
