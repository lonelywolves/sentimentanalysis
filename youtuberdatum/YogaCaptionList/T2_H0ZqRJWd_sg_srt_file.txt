- Hello everyone, I'm
Adriene and that is Benji.
And welcome to your Yoga PE.
Today, we're gonna focus on the heart.
So, stand up nice and tall.
And when you're ready, bring
your hands to your heart.
You can just place them right
here on your heart center
or over on your actual heart.
(soft music)
And then take a second to close your eyes
if you feel comfortable or brave,
you can close your eyes just for a second.
And bring your attention to your heart.
Notice how it feels to bring
attention to your heart space.
So, the heart space in yoga
kind of helps us connect
to our emotions or our mood.
And if you're not feeling really great
or you're in a bad mood,
that's totally okay,
but the cool thing is there
are certain things we can do
to help transform that,
to change that mood
or sometimes when we're not
feeling well, there are things
and sometimes there are very
little things that we can do
to help ourselves feel better.
So, we're gonna keep that in mind today.
Take a deep breath in with
your hands on your heart
and then when you exhale,
go ahead and breathe out
through the mouth like this.
And we call this the ocean breath
because the exhale kind
of sounds like the waves
in the ocean.
Or if you've ever listened to a seashell,
it kind of sounds like that.
So, let's try it again.
Big inhale in through the nose
and ocean breath.
Good, now release the
hands from the heart.
Just bring your fingertips
to your shoulders here.
We're gonna inhale, bring the
elbows forward in together,
and then as you exhale, ocean breath,
take the elbows to your side
and back and down.
Let's put it together.
Inhale forward, up
and exhale back, down.
Inhale forward,
exhale back and down.
Inhale forward,
and exhale back and down.
Already starting to
change my mood over here.
Inhale forward,
and exhale back and down.
Now, release your hands to your side.
Come into Mountain pose, beautiful.
From here, we're gonna
imagine the top of our head
is the tip of the mountain
and the legs are really strong, excellent.
From here, you're gonna take
the sides of the mountain,
your arms and you're going
to bring them behind you.
See if you can interlace your
fingertips behind your back,
just see if you can do it.
Excellent, then inhale, look
all the way up towards the sky
and exhale, bend your knees
and see if you can keep
your fingers interlaced.
It's okay, if you can't,
you can just reach up
towards the sky like this,
but see if you can keep
your fingers interlaced
as you fold in towards your knees.
Now shake the head, yes
and nod the head, no.
And you can say it with me, yes,
and nodding the head, no.
Awesome work.
Now, listen carefully.
We're gonna squeeze the legs together.
Drop your bum, your hips back
and then release your hands
so you're flying like an airplane.
Excellent, then if you
have some space around you
or on your yoga mat,
you can stay nice and low and
move your airplane around.
You can do a pattern if
you know what that is,
you can go for a little
maybe figure eight pattern.
Maybe you go fast, super fast.
Maybe you go slow, super slow.
Awesome, then come back to
center and you shake it off.
All right, so we're gonna take
the feet nice and wide here.
And we're going to squat again.
And we're gonna bring our
hands into a round shape as if
we were holding a big basket.
Excellent, then we're gonna take one hand,
we're gonna reach all
the way up to one side.
Imagine you're picking
some fruit off of a tree,
as you reach all the way up,
you're gonna straighten the
legs and then bring it back
to center to put it in your basket.
Then you're gonna go
to the other side here,
reach it all the way up
and put it in your basket.
You can also reach way beyond
the trees and reach all the
way up into the sky grab
a little piece of cloud,
put it in or reach all
the way up to the sky,
grab a little sunshine,
a little light and put it in your basket.
Here we go.
Nice and slow here to start.
And then once you feel
like you have this down,
you can start to speed it up.
Grabbing an apple, putting in the basket.
Maybe you grab a little bit
of a rainbow up in the sky,
bring it into your basket.
See if you can go a little faster
and a little faster
and one more time, a little faster.
And then here we go,
go ahead and release
your basket and come back
to mountain pose, take a deep breath in
and ocean breath.
Awesome, from here,
we're gonna slowly come
into a downward facing dog.
So you'll bend your knees,
come through your forward fold
and we're gonna walk
the hands out in front.
So the hips are up high.
Knees are bent here and in
fact you can bend one knee
and then the other going
a little back and forth.
Now think about a dog, the tail,
your tail now is up in the air.
And think about a dog,
what kind of sound does the dog make?
Maybe you make that sound
now to fully embody your
downward facing dog.
Excellent, and you're
going to bend your knees
and you're gonna wag your
tail from left to right.
We're getting our hearts
above our heads here,
this is called an inversion.
So good for the body.
Alright, wag your tail for three,
wag your tail for two,
you're doing awesome,
wag your tail for one.
Then slowly walk your feet back to center,
squeeze legs together and roll
back up into your mountain.
Now notice how you feel when
you go from downward facing dog
to standing up tall in mountain.
Bring your hands back to your heart
and see if you can notice
anything different.
See if you can feel your heartbeat.
Sometimes it helps me to close my eyes
to really try to find my own heartbeat.
(upbeat music)
Awesome, release the hands.
Step the feet nice and wide.
Benji woke up from his nap,
what's up, dude? Welcome.
All right, so this is one
of my favorite things to do
in yoga, it totally helps
me get out of a bad mood
and into a more pleasant state.
So we're gonna bring the feet wide,
you're gonna lift your heart
and we're going to start
with soft knees here, we're
gonna start by just sending the
arms to one side
and then the other, that's it.
One side, and then the other.
Soft bend in the knees,
we start to pick it up.
Now, I'm just gonna keep
it real with you guys,
there's a little bit of a
booty smack in this move,
so you can smack your own
booty, move your hips a little,
have some fun with it,
if it makes you laugh,
that's all good.
Smile, in fact it's encouraged.
Giggle, laugh it up.
Here we go, picking up speed here.
And maybe getting a little
faster and a little faster
and a little faster.
And then here we go for three,
keep it going for two
and for one, now,
if you had a lot of fun, they're awesome.
But now see how fast you can
come back to mountain pose.
Bring your hands to your
heart and control your breath.
Deep breath in.
Long breathe out.
All right, our final
pose is called tree pose,
some of you might know it.
You're gonna stand on your
left leg and you're gonna
turn your right leg out
right on your ankle here.
Keep your hands at your heart.
Or you can even bring
them into this shape here
for more stability, hands at the heart.
And one leg is turned out and
one leg is straight, strong.
Some of you may know,
you can bring the foot up a little higher.
You can even grab that ankle
and bring it all the way up
towards your center.
But any variation is fine.
Wherever you are hold onto your balance,
focus on something with
your eyes in front of you
and then grow your branches.
Nice and slow.
Growing your branches,
growing your branches,
reach, reach, reach, reach, reach,
and then allow your leaves
to fall nice and slow.
Release that leg that was up.
Switch it out and take
it to the other side.
So we're gonna stand nice and
tall in that opposite leg,
open through the other
side, stand up tall here.
Hands at the heart,
find your focus,
and grow your branches.
This is the last bit,
so focus, focus, focus,
lift your heart up towards the sky here.
And if you fall, do not worry
that is part of the process here.
And luckily the ground is
always there to catch you.
I actually really like a falling tree,
I feel like it's really
creative, personally.
Once you feel like you've
grown your branches
to the max capacity, then release,
imagine your leaves falling,
falling, falling, falling.
Awesome, come back to mountain pose,
which is where we will close out today.
Take a deep breath in
and a long breath out.
Thank you so much for
joining me and Benji today.
We will see you next time.
(upbeat music)
