- What's up party people?
Welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and
that's Benji over there.
And today we have a super fun
practice called "Yoga Party."
So I get a lot of requests
for practices that people can do
together or maybe you want
to do it on a special day.
Or maybe you're just
feeling a little restless.
Maybe it's raining outside or
you want to do something that
is good for you but
hang with your people.
This is gonna be an
awesome practice for that.
Also, I just want 
to point out
this is gonna be a
super fun practice
if you just don't feel like
going out but you want to do
something, you know, have a
party with yourself, right?
So hop into something
comfy and let's get started.
(light music)
Hello, my sweet friends.
Let's begin today's session
in a nice comfortable seat.
Take your time.
Come on down to the ground.
If you are practicing alone,
just take a second to maybe just
say thank you to yourself for
showing up and spending some
time with yourself and
practicing with yourself.
Nurturing your most
important friendship.
And if you're practicing
this with other people,
go ahead and take a second right
now to just look at them and
smile, say hi, high five
like, "We're doing this."
You can giggle.
Just a connection, right?
So Benji, what's up?
Benji, (snaps) right here.
Okay.
And then
we'll let that go,
bring the hands together
at heart center.
Sit up nice and tall.
Wherever you are,
take a deep breath in.
Awesome and as
you close your eyes,
you can relax the shoulders,
breathe out here.
Just land here in the moment.
And again, deep breath in.
Big, big, big full breath.
And using your exhale
to relax your shoulders.
You can keep the eyes
closed here or soften your gaze.
And one more time, the biggest
breath you've taken all day.
Here we go, big inhale.
And exhale to
relax the shoulders.
(Benji growls)
Good.
Just take a couple
more moments here
to listen to the
sound of your breath.
If you're coming onto the
mat feeling a little tired or a
little low energy or if you've
been managing a bit of anxiety
or stress lately, really
let this practice be a gift.
(clears throat)
Excuse me.
A gift that you give yourself.
Move in a way that
feels good for you today.
I'm honored to be your guide.
Alright, let's begin.
Benji's up and out.
Let's follow his movement.
We'll open the eyes.
We're gonna bring
the palms to the knees.
And when you're ready, inhale,
we're gonna start
moving in a circle.
So just moving your heart
forward as you breathe in.
And then rounding
the spine as you come
chin to chest, breathing out.
Inhale, come forward.
And exhale, around and back.
And keep it nice and slow here.
Try to really
deepen your breath.
Wake up through the spine.
And then when you're ready go
ahead and reverse your circle.
Let's make this a
party right away.
Checking in with the side body,
the shoulders, the neck.
You can start to
get a little freaky.
Just find what feels good.
Checking in with
your body today.
We're gonna have you walking
up and off the mat feeling good.
More connected to your breath.
More connected to your body.
Hopefully a little 
more balanced out
in the brain and the body.
Okay, come back to center.
Align your head over your heart,
your heart over your pelvis
and we're gonna take the left
hand down to the earth and
inhale reach the right
fingertips all the way up and
then all the way over for
a nice side body stretch.
Get really heavy
in your right hip.
Feel that connection right glute
to earth as it reach the right
fingertips a little more.
Good, then come all the way
back through to center and
we'll switch to the other side.
Right hand to the earth, inhale,
left fingertips reach up first.
Feel that lengthening
in the side body.
And then over.
Nice side body stretch.
Pull the left thumb back.
Get heavy in the left hip.
Take one more deep 
breath in here. Really reach.
And then come back to center.
Awesome work.
We're gonna come forward on to
all fours now. Take your time.
Move like you love yourself.
You can smile.
Deepen your breath
here with a big inhale.
And really finding your
foundation as you exhale.
Wrists underneath the shoulders,
knees directly
underneath the hips.
Cool, here we go,
inhale, drop the belly,
open your chest, look forward.
Exhale, spinal flexion.
Draw the naval up for
Cat Pose, chin to chest.
Breathe out.
Good, inhale, drop the
belly, open your heart.
Look forward.
Exhale, tuck the tailbone,
round through the low back,
mid back, upper back, cervical
spine until the crown of the
head is facing the ground.
Cool, inhale, drop the belly.
Open the chest.
Feel that long puppy belly here.
So really stretch
through the front body.
And then exhale,
rounding through.
Feel that stretch
in the back body.
Good, one more on your own
with the sound of your breath.
And then we'll meet
back in Tabletop Position.
Walk the hands out just
a little bit wider now.
Curl the toes under.
When you're ready,
take a deep breath in.
Maybe lift the corners of the
mouth if it's right for you
today and then exhale,
lift the hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Pedal it out here.
Bend the knees one
and then the other.
Claw through the fingertips to
keep some pressure
out of the wrists.
And keep it light here today.
Nice and fun just
one breath at a time.
One present moment
opening a window into the next.
It's all good.
Don't have to do it right.
Don't have to nail it.
Just feel your way through.
Awesome, bend the knees, 
let them come to the earth,
bring the two 
big toes together,
knees come as wide 
as the yoga mat.
Send the hips back,
fingertips forward,
Extended Child's Pose but
try to keep active arms here.
So really inch your fingers
toward the front end of the mat.
Let the weight of
your heart melt down.
Forehead comes to the earth
and you might rock the forehead
softly getting a little
massage on the brow bone.
Soften through the jaw.
Maybe pull that creases
back just a bit in space.
Mmmm, nice.
Then keep the
legs where they are.
In fact, press into the tops of
the feet as you lift your heart
and your center back up.
Then bring your left hand to the
center of your mat and on your
next inhale draw a line with
your right fingertips all the
way up your left arm, all the
way across your chest and all
the way up towards the sky.
Good, breathe
into your belly here.
Inhale.
Exhale, thread the needle,
right fingertips come in and
underneath the
bridge of the left arm.
You can send the left arm, left
fingertips all the way forward.
You can bend your left elbow.
Maybe you take a bind taking the
left fingertips all the way to
the front hip
crease of your right hip.
Maybe left hand
on the small back.
So make a choice here.
And then return to the
sound of your breath.
Awesome, close your eyes for
one more cycle of breath or just
soften your gaze a bit.
Just going inward.
Nice and then we'll slowly
unravel using your hands to
help you come
back up to center.
Right hand comes to the earth,
left fingertips are gonna trace
a line all the way
across the right arm,
all the way across the chest
and all the way up to the sky.
Breathe in here.
And then exhale,
thread the needle,
left fingertips in and
underneath the
bridge of right arm.
Again, you have a couple options
here to explore what to do
with the right arm.
Find what feels good.
Breathing deep, sending
that breath to your belly.
Nice, full diaphragmatic 
breaths here.
So good for the body.
So nourishing in a twist.
Massaging your internal organs.
Moving stagnant energy.
Good, close your eyes or just
soften your gaze a little bit
here for this last
cycle breath in your twist.
Awesome, and then
slowly unraveling.
So good, especially if you're
carrying any added tension
in the shoulders, in the neck.
Alright, walk the hands forward.
Walk the knees just
underneath the hip points.
Curl the toes under, inhale in.
Let's follow Benji here.
(chuckles)
Jenji, Benji by coming
into Downward Facing Dog.
When you're ready, peel it up.
Inhale in when you get there
and exhale long 
breath out as you
find some soft easy movement.
Awesome, then bend
the knees, inhale,
look forward and we're gonna
just criss-cross the feet
stepping one at a time, baby
steps to the top of the mat.
When you get there, ground
the feet hip width apart,
toes pointing forward, bend
your knees generously and then
allow the weight of
your head to just hang.
Again, really digging
into all four corners.
So some of us tend to roll in or
out on the foot, front or back.
See if you can kind of spread
awareness evenly through all
four corners of the feet.
Clasp opposite elbow
now with opposite hand and
just take a second here to
gently rock back and forth.
Connecting with the
sound of your breath.
Lovely, then release that.
Bend the knees even more.
Nice strong legs,
tuck the chin to the chest and
slowly roll it up,
Mountain Pose.
Take your time.
Ground down actively through
the feet as you rise up strong.
Heart lifts here,
fingertips have energy here
gently at your side.
So just take a second
to breathe in deep here.
And use your exhale to relax
any stress or tension that might
have been accumulating
in your shoulder.
So you can use your exhale
throughout this practice to
soften and relax the
shoulders the whole time.
Alright, on your next inhale,
reach the fingertips all the way
up towards the sky.
From here, we're gonna take this
imaginary ball out that were
holding up and over head and
just slowly bring it over
towards the left.
Dig into your right heel.
Turn to send your gaze up
towards your right elbow and
feel that length in the
right oblique, right side body.
Keep digging into your heels.
Good, inhale to
bring it back to center.
Exhale, think up and over
as you tilt to the right.
Same thing here,
dig into your left heel.
Feel that length in the
left side body, left oblique.
And then send your gaze
over towards your left elbow.
Good, inhale,
come back to center.
Exhale to bend the knees, wiggle
the fingertips and rain it all
the way down to a
Forward Fold once again.
From here on your next inhale,
come to a nice
flat back position.
You're gonna lengthen the
crown towards the front,
the tail towards the back.
(chuckles)
Soft bend in the knees here,
elbows hugging in.
Good, then on your next exhale
let everything go, Forward Fold.
Let's do that again.
Big inhale, halfway lift.
Inhale lifts you up.
And then the
exhale takes you down.
And one more time,
big inhale lifts you up.
Find that flat back position.
This time really trying to bring
the front body up
to meet the spine.
Beautiful and then
exhale slowly release.
Ground down through the feet,
inhale to reach for the sky.
Big breath, big stretch.
Capture a little magic up and
overhead and as you exhale
palms float down back
to the heart space.
Great, you can keep the feet
now hip width apart or walk the
feet together arch to arch.
Here we go, inhale,
fingertips go down to come up,
big breath in.
Exhale, tilt to the left,
side body stretch on the right.
Inhale, rise up.
Exhale, tilt to the right,
side body stretch on the left.
Inhale, reach up.
Exhale, rain it down, 
all the way.
Just one of these this time.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Gaze straight down
slightly in front.
Exhale, Forward Fold.
Great, bend the knees, step one
foot back and then the other,
Plank Pose. Spread the 
fingertips, don't panic.
Hug the low ribs in.
Draw your navel in and up.
Reach the heel back, way back.
From here you can always lower
on to the knees for Half Plank
otherwise keep it lifted finding
that hollow body as you press
away from your
yoga mat for five.
You got it, breathe deep.
Four.
Three. Two.
On the one shift
forward on the toes,
look forward,
squeeze the elbows in and
slowly lower down with control.
Belly flops, welcome.
Breathe in as you
slowly lift up, Baby Cobra.
Breathe out as
you slowly release.
Good, curl the toes under.
Press up to all fours.
Tabletop Position.
Beautiful, let's reset and
then curl the toes under,
lift from the hip creases
and send it up and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Lovely, anchor the left heel.
On your next inhale,
lift the right leg up high.
Nice and easy.
Turn all of the right toes down.
Try and level the hips here.
Good, then inhale in again.
(clears throat)
Claw through the
fingertips, excuse me.
Exhale, bend your right
knee, bring it forward.
Think of Cat Pose
here in the spine.
So hugging that right
knee up into the chest.
Good, then step it
all the way up and in.
We're gonna pivot
on the back foot and
we're gonna open 
up to Warrior II here.
So opening all the
way up to Warrior II.
Front knee is bent,
right fingertips forward,
left fingertips back.
So there's a tendency to
lean forward a little bit here.
Remember that alignment
of head over heart,
heart over pelvis
so pull it back.
So we're wanting to create a
healthy flow of energy that runs
up and down the spine.
Alright, here we go, inhale in.
Exhale, right elbow comes to
the top of the right thigh.
We are making sure our
left toes are turned in here.
And then nice and easy you're
gonna send the left fingertips
forward, up and then around
and back and then keep it going.
Forward,
up and around and back.
And forward, up,
around and back.
Now we're gonna
reverse the circle.
Here we go all the
way to the back first.
And then up and
then swim it forward.
Awesome.
All the way back,
up and swim it forward.
Big, strum, and one more time.
Rock 'n roll.
Inhale, reach up.
Back and this time let your
left fingertips take you
all the way back down.
Back knee can lower or stay
lifted as you reach the right
fingertips all the way up,
big breath in.
Awesome, on your exhale
bring it all the way back.
Plant the palms.
Listen carefully.
Here you can step it to Plank,
you can lower the knees to
Half Plank or you can keep 
the right foot lifted for
a one-legged vinyasa,
eka pada vinyasa.
So we're moving into
Cobra again, inhale.
Or if you want to do a
Chaturanga to Up Dog you can.
We're gonna meet in
Downward Facing Dog.
You can come to that Tabletop
Position first and then peel up
however you want to get there.
When you arrive,
take a deep breath in.
And a nice cleansing
breath, breathe out.
Good, claw through
the fingertips.
On your next inhale
lift the left leg up high.
Turn the left toes down,
you'll feel the glute engage,
keep the left
hip nice and level.
Press into both palms evenly.
Inhale in again.
And exhale, slow and
steady, shift forward.
Hug the left knee
up towards the chest.
Try to touch your left
heel to your left glute.
Think Cat Pose in the spine,
press away from your yoga mat,
you're doing great.
Nice and then step it all
the way up into your lunge.
Good, pivot on the back foot, 
nice and easy, Warrior II.
Take your time.
We rise up.
Left fingertips forward,
right fingertips back.
Again, just check
in with your spine.
Are we leaning forward?
Leaning back?
Can I hug my low ribs in?
Back toes are turned in,
front knee over front ankle.
Warrior II.
Find your breath again.
Catch a wave.
Nice, then from here we're
gonna bend the left elbow.
Bring it to the top
of the left thigh.
Here we go, nice and
easy, moving in a circle.
Fingertips are gonna go down,
inhale, forward and
all the way up and back.
Big circle.
And all the way down.
Strong legs.
Forward.
Breathing deep, up and back.
And one more time nice and slow.
Down and forward.
And up and back
and then here we go,
we're gonna reverse the circle.
Strong legs.
All the way back.
Inhale as you reach up,
and swim it forward.
And all the way back.
And reach up.
And swim it forward.
And last one, here we go.
Back and up.
Energy in the fingertips.
Swim it forward and let
that bring you all the way
back down to your mat.
Pivot on the back foot, inhale
left fingertips towards the sky.
Big twist.
Excellent.
Slowly bringing the
left hand back down
to frame your left foot.
When you're ready, step it back.
Maybe you keep the back foot
lifted for a one-legged vinyasa.
Move in a way that
feels good for you.
Move with your breath.
Marrying the
action and the breath.
We'll meet in
Downward Facing Dog.
From Down Dog take
a deep breath in.
And exhale out
through the mouth.
Nice cleansing breath.
Awesome, bend the knees,
inhale to look forward.
Exhale to make your way
to the top of the mat.
Feet together or
hip width apart.
Inhale lifts you up halfway.
Follow your breath.
Exhale to soften
and fold back in.
Root to rise here,
inhale, reach for the sky.
Big breath,
big stretch all the way up.
And exhale, palms come together
and float slowly back down to
your heart space.
Close your eyes here, capture
a little bit of that magic.
Take a deep breath in.
And relax your shoulders
down as you breathe out.
And just take a moment here to
observe your breath,
your energy.
Notice how you feel.
Gently bat your eyelashes open.
We're gonna shift the
weight to the left foot,
just the left foot.
Nice and easy you're gonna keep
your left thumb on your heart
space and you're gonna actually
lift your sternum up to your
left thumb here.
Then I'm gonna
take my right hand,
I'm gonna lift my right knee
up and I'm gonna try to
kick my right foot back to
maybe capture my right ankle.
When I do I'm gonna
squeeze everything in,
press up out of that standing
foot to try to find my balance.
And it helps to find a
small focal point out in front.
I'm getting a big
quad stretch here.
I'm working to get my
center underneath me.
Similarly to that Warrior II,
head over heart,
heart over pelvis.
Not leaning forward, just yet.
Just keeping it
nice and stacked.
Energy in the right foot.
Breathing deep here.
Great, then I can stay here
or sternum still 
lifting to thumb,
I might take my hand
bring it to the inner arch of
my right foot or maybe
to the right ankle and
I'm gonna begin to
slowly lean forward.
Hinging at the hips, looking
forward as if I was looking
into a pond to come
into a Dancer Pose or
a Standing Bow Pose.
So just take your time.
I'll start to kick it out,
kick it out, kick it out.
From here, maybe if I feel good,
I'll start to take my left arm
forward, palm face up 
or palm face down,
whatever feels good for today.
Some variations here would be
to work at the wall or to work
with a buddy (chuckles).
Or to just keep the
toes on the ground,
hinge at the hip and
work in a more aerobesque.
Still working on the core.
And then you can play with
lifting the leg from here.
Wherever you are take
one more deep breath in.
And then use your exhale
to just slowly come back to
a nice easy Mountain Pose.
Shake it off, high five
your neighbor if you like,
it's all good.
And we're gonna go
to the other side.
So shifting your weight
to your right foot now.
Bring both palms together.
Anjuli Mudra at the heart.
Then keep your right thumb
right here so sternum's really
pressing up into the the thumb.
It's gonna help us keep
this lift that we'll need
moving into the posture.
I'm gonna lift my left knee,
maybe capture left ankle.
Squeeze that left knee in.
So feel that zipper effect.
Zipping everything up and in.
Find your focal point.
And breathe.
Just getting that quad stretch.
Again, you can work 
with a little chair
or couch edge or
wall or post here.
And don't be shy to
walk away from the video,
go find something to hold on to.
Right? Own it.
Own your process.
Maybe we work to flip
the hand around to the
arch of the ankle here.
And grow the shape
by leaning forward,
hinging at the hips, keeping
this lift in the sternum and
kicking the foot out.
Soft micro-bend in
the standing leg.
I'm pressing up out
of the earth here.
Maybe the right fingertips come
forward on this one, maybe not.
Palm face up or palm face down.
I'm kicking my left foot out.
I'm drawing my navel up and in.
Just playing.
And wherever you are,
take a deep breath in.
And then exhale slow and steady,
bring it back to Mountain.
That's where we will all
meet and we will shake it off.
Alright, ain't no party like
a yoga party and ain't no yoga
party without a little
Knocking On Heaven's Door.
And if you don't know
what I'm talking about
I will guide you now.
So we're gonna walk 
the feet out a little bit.
Make sure you 
have a little space
if you're practicing
with someone.
If you're practicing alone,
you're about to have the party
of a lifetime
because no one's watching.
Okay?
So first we're just gonna
find some softness in the knees.
So it's very important that you
don't lock the knees out here.
So just find a little sway.
And if you feel silly,
trust me, you're supposed to.
It's all good.
And then you're just gonna
see what happens from that.
So if I can do this and 
put myself on YouTube
you can do it
wherever you are.
Bring your hands to
the waistline here,
now we're just gonna
get the hips involved.
So we're just
finding a little sway.
Remembering to be soft
and easy in the feet
and in the knee joint.
Cool and then from here we're
gonna slowly start to release
the arms and we're
gonna move back and forth.
Feet are soft and moveable.
Knees are soft and bent.
So we're not locking there.
And we're gonna go
back and forth and
we're gonna start
to pick up the speed.
And we might even get
some booty slaps in.
Yes, it's that kinda party.
And if you can, we're gonna
start to synch up with the
breath but you're
gonna decide how.
So maybe it's an inhale to
one side, exhale to the other.
Maybe starts to
pick up a little more.
And do not decide
where this ends.
Keep it going.
Follow my lead.
It's okay if you laugh a
little here and giggle.
If you really want to make the
most of the booty slap, get it.
Get it, my friend.
Life's too short.
Okay, moving energy in the body.
Right when you want to quit
and give up, stick with it.
Stick with me.
Breathing deep,
keep your chin lifted.
Gaze soft here.
Nice and easy, breathing deep.
Moving the energy of the body
so you feel awesome afterwards.
We're here for ten.
Keep it going.
Nine, eight, seven.
Six, five, let everything go.
Four, three, two.
And on the one it 
starts to slow down
and slow down and slow down
and slow down
and come back to center.
And don't move your feet.
Just stand here for one moment.
Maybe you close your eyes
and notice how you feel.
Yes.
And on your next breath in
draw your palms together.
Use your exhale to
relax the shoulders down.
Then you can slowly
heel-toe, heel-toe,
do-si-do come on baby,
let's go, boot scoot!
That's how we party here
in Texas still, yes. (laughs)
So heel-toe, heel-toe, feet
together or if you want to hop
the feet together, you can.
Or if you just stopped the video
because I started singing that
song, I understand.
Although if you stopped the
video you wouldn't be able to
hear me say that so here 
we are all together now
standing in our 
final Mountain Pose.
See if you can feel this
upward current of energy
through the front body.
It's this lift.
It's this uplifting,
this elevating of oneself.
And then see if you can balance
out with a little awareness of
grounding energy
wherever you can find it.
Maybe in the back body,
shoulder blades melting down.
And again,
it's just this
awareness of lift and ground.
And expansion and fall.
And may our awareness of 
both energies keep us centered
for the rest of the 
day or for the evening.
If you're practicing
this on a special day,
everyday's special,
but you know what I mean,
then I want to give
you a little shoutout.
Wherever this
yoga party finds you,
I hope that it 
leaves you feeling
loved and connected
or a little more loved
and a little more connected
'cause you deserve it.
Let's take one
more deep breath in.
Lift the thumbs up
to the third eye.
And we'll finish by
exhaling all together.
Bowing the head to the
heart and whispering Namaste.
(light music)
