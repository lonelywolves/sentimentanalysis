- What's up, everyone?
Welcome to Home,
your 30-day yoga journey.
Today is Day 11 and today,
crack, we dig in.
(upbeat gentle music)
Alright pals, welcome back.
Let's begin today's practice in
(mimicks triumphant trumpets)
Downward Facing Dog.
So don't rush, alright?
Take your time.
First, come on 
down to the ground.
Benji's gonna 
help us with this one.
You gonna come 
to all fours likely
and then peel up from there.
Start to check in
with your breath
as you lift the hips up high.
And you're doing this.
We are doing this.
We are already here
so today's practice 
invites us to dig in.
Whatever that means to you.
Crawl through the fingertips.
Try to give it your thinking
mind a break in this session.
I know it's easier 
said than done.
But use the sound of your breath
to kind of anchor any busy
thoughts or busy mind.
And let's get right into the
sensation here as you pedal it
out through the feet, stretching
through the fascia of the foot,
the ankles, the Achilles,
the backs of the legs.
You can sway the hips 
a little side to side.
Just wiggle around here.
And then take a deep breath in.
Big, big inhale in 
through the nose.
And as you exhale, bend
your knees and melt your heart
towards the tops of the thighs.
Breathe out.
Good, inhale.
Drop the heels, 
hug the low ribs in,
find stillness.
Letting the blood flow
here to the head, so good.
Here we go, bend the knees,
belly comes towards 
the tops of the thighs.
This time we carve a line 
with the nose to look forward
and you're going to crawl 
your way up to the top,
nice and slow.
We'll meet in a Forward Fold.
Feet hip width apart or
flush together, your choice.
Just nice conscious footing.
Take a second or two here.
Again, really seeing if you can
allow the thinking mind to
take a bit of a break 
and let's invite our body,
our bodily intelligence 
to kind of have
a head seat 
at the table today.
So what that could mean 
is really focusing on the
sensation, this idea of (sighs)
getting your hands dirty.
(clicks tongue) Hey-o.
Digging in.
Alright, on that note,
dig into the heels.
Press into the ball joint
of the big toe mound,
ball joint of 
the pinky toe mound.
When you're ready, 
bend the knees generously.
Think of keeping your 
knees stacked over your ankles.
If they don't quite 
make it to that shape,
that's all right but just keep
that awareness as you send your
hips back and right in,
let's sit back,
dig in, fingertips forward,
hips back, Utkatasana.
Thumbs up, pinkies down.
In fact, let's just do 
a little hang loose here
to help you with that.
Great, if you're like, "I have
no idea what that is," we will
talk about it maybe (chuckles)
in the comments section.
Here we go, on your next
inhale press into the feet.
Rise up, reach 
up towards the sky.
Listen carefully, as 
you exhale, bend the elbows,
keep your chest lifted.
Slight back bend here if 
it's right for your body.
Squeezing the 
shoulder blades together.
Beautiful, inhale to reach
for the sky, stand up tall.
Let's dive right in, dig in.
Forward Fold, 
rain the fingertips down.
On your next inhale,
lift up halfway.
Today we're going to invite some
airplane arms into this shape.
So send their fingertips out,
palms face down.
Building that mindfulness 
in the upper back body,
supporting the low back body
by drawing the navel up and in.
Good, take a 
deep breath in here,
let it lift you just a bit.
Then exhale, crest and fall,
come all the way back down,
Forward Fold.
Good, plant the palm 
step just the right foot back.
Just the right foot.
Inhale, we rise up.
Back knee lowered or lifted.
We send the fingertips up high.
Beautiful.
Today, open twist.
So you're gonna send 
the left fingertips back,
right fingertips forward.
Keep that front knee bent.
You don't have to crank it here.
Keep it nice and easy.
Good, then inhale, we rise up.
Reach the fingertips up high.
Then open up to 
the right, Warrior II.
Pull the pinkies back.
Remember a little 
tendency to lean forward here.
All good, let's bring the spine
into a nice stacked alignment.
Inhale in here.
Lengthen through the crown.
Press into the outer 
edge of your right foot.
Exhale, relax 
your shoulders down.
Excellent.
Keep the front knee bent.
Building strength.
Reach the left fingertips 
up as you breathe in.
And then back, big stretch,
Peaceful Warrior.
Good from here cartwheeling 
all the way back down
to a nice low lunge.
Right into a twist, 
right hand to the earth.
Inhale, left fingertips 
up towards the sky.
Beautiful, wiggle 
the left fingertips.
And then bring it all the
way back down to your lunge.
You're gonna rock 
a couple times here,
bringing that back foot up to
meet the front, Forward Fold.
Feet together 
or hip width apart.
Inhale, halfway 
lift with airplane arms.
So pull the fingers back.
Right as I'm doing 
this I can hear
an airplane (jet engine)
outside my window.
Magic.
Take a deep breath in here,
let it lift you.
And then exhale, Forward Fold.
Beautiful, step 
the left toes back.
Back knee lowered or lifted.
On the inhale, we rise up.
Send the fingertips up high.
Beautiful, big breath in here.
Use your exhale to 
relax the shoulders down.
Find your footing.
Squeeze into the midline.
Nice open twist.
Inhale to reach 
up a little higher.
Exhale, open 
twist to your right.
Keep the ball 
joint of that left,
excuse me, right big toe mound
firmly planted on the earth.
You have everything 
you need here so dig in,
take your time.
Excellent, inhale, 
come back to center.
Big breath in, stretch.
Exhale, open to the left,
Warrior II.
Pull the pinkies back.
Move mindfully through your
checklist as you breathe deep.
Good, then let's flip it.
Inhale, reach the 
right fingertips up high.
Then continue that 
journey up and over,
creating space, 
Peaceful Warrior.
Nice, and then all the 
way back down to your lunge,
slow cartwheel.
We pivot on the back foot, 
left hand comes to the ground
and big inhale 
lifts you back up.
Right fingertips to the sky.
Big twist so big belly
breath here, you got it.
And then slowly 
back down to your lunge.
Awesome, walk the back 
foot up to meet the front.
Here we go, Forward Fold 
at the top of the mat.
Here we go, inhale in.
Airplane arms.
Imagine two little angels
pulling your fingertips back.
So we're really creating space
between the shoulders and
the ear lobes as you 
look down and forward.
Good, inhale.
Let it lift you just a bit.
There's a rise and a fall to 
the breath here, Forward Fold.
Ground through the feet, 
inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale, bend the elbows, squeeze
the shoulder blades together.
Good, dig in through the heels.
Inhale, lift up towards the sky.
Exhale, wiggle the fingertips,
rain it all the way down.
Inhale, halfway lift,
airplane arms,
palms pressed down,
fingertips reach.
And exhale to fold.
Great, step the right foot back.
This time pivot 
on the back foot.
We're coming up to Warrior I.
Nice and slow reaching
the fingertips 
forward, up and back.
Strong legs, you've got this.
Virabhadrasana I.
Thumbs back, 
(chuckles) pinkies forward.
Press into the outer 
edge of your back foot.
Good, inhale in here.
Reach a little higher,
strong legs.
Exhale, bend the elbows,
squeeze them behind you,
thumbs back, pinky forward.
Inhale, tuck the chin,
reach for the sky.
Exhale, bend the elbows.
Lift your chest.
One more.
Spread the fingertips,
reach the sky.
And exhale, bend the elbows,
lift your heart.
Now keep your heart lifted
here, send your fingertips down.
You're gonna interlace 
them behind your back.
You got this.
Strong footing, so you have
that connection through all four
corners of your front foot.
Then we'll lift the 
chest here. Inhale.
Open, open, open.
Exhale, pull the 
left hip crease back,
keep the front knee bent.
Strong back leg, 
ground through that back foot.
You're gonna lean forward,
look forward.
Coming into a 
little Humble Warrior.
So you can stay 
nice and lifted here.
Spine long and strong.
Or we can work to continue the
journey all the way down maybe
one day bringing the crown of
the head down towards the earth.
Now use everything 
we've learned so far.
Be attentive.
Press into the outer 
edge of that back foot.
Engage your right inner thigh.
One more breath here,
you got this.
Use your exhale to 
connect to your center,
your core and come all
the way back up, Warrior I.
Here we go, big inhale.
Nice and then exhale, palms are
gonna come together and we're
gonna pivot on the back foot and
we're going to come all the way
back down to 
that nice low lunge.
Beautiful work here.
Rock the back foot 
up to meet the front.
Take your time.
Inhale, halfway lift,
airplane arms.
Look forward.
Nice, long, beautiful neck.
And exhale to soften 
and fold everything in.
Bend the knees, 
fingertips come to the mat,
we step the left toes back.
Pivot on the back foot,
bend your front knee,
front knee over front ankle.
Strong and steady, you got this.
Fingertips reach forward,
up and back, Warrior I.
Feel that sensation 
in the hip here.
Remember nice wide base 
so you can find stability.
And let's flow with the breath,
inhale to reach of the sky.
Exhale, bend the elbows,
lift the chest.
Inhale, tuck the chin,
reach for the sky.
Exhale, bend the elbows.
As you reach up, can you
reinforce that connection
from the outer edge 
of your back foot?
Yes, exhale, bend the elbows.
Inhale, reach up.
And exhale, bend the elbows.
Great. This time 
keep your heart lifted.
Strong legs.
We'll reach behind, interlace.
Maybe opposite thumb on
top this time, maybe not.
And here we go, 
inhale in, lift your heart.
Exhale, strong legs as you
pull the right hip crease back.
Front knee stays bent.
And we begin to look forward
searching for our reflection
here in the water, 
nice and slow.
Strong spine.
Maybe we pause here,
nice flat back.
Working, working, working.
Breathing or maybe we 
continue the journey down,
crown of the head 
coming towards the earth.
If not today, maybe 
another day, maybe another year.
Lift your left kneecap.
Engage the left inner thigh,
breathe deep.
Humble Warrior.
Good, inhale in.
Use your exhale to find 
that slight contraction,
navel draws in in your 
core center and from there,
we rise back up.
You got this.
Stay strong.
Keep that front knee bent.
As you inhale,
reach for the sky, Warrior I.
So Warrior.
Inhale in.
Exhale, palms slide 
back down to the heart.
We pivot on the back foot 
and we come back down
to our nice low lunge.
Beautiful work.
Rock the back foot 
up to meet the front.
Inhale lifts you up halfway.
Airplane arms here.
Beautiful length 
in the neck here.
And then check it out, 
bring the palms together,
interlace and you're just gonna
bring the knuckles all the way
up and over as you fold back in.
Shake the head yes, no.
Inhale in.
As you exhale,
let something go.
Good, nice and slow.
As a friend of mine says,
try to resist the slingshot
effect here of your arm.
So nice and slow with control,
release the arms.
You're gonna walk the feet as
wide as your yoga mat here.
Let your toes turn out 
just a bit left to right.
And we're gonna nice 
and easy get down low,
dig in, coming 
down into a low squat.
Alright, so we might be
visited by some 
aches and pains here.
We might be confronted with
something here, maybe not.
So just pay attention 
and be mindful.
Find some soft, easy movement.
You can lift the heels totally.
If you find that the 
heels are able to come down,
maybe you find a Prayer Position
here and use your arms to
actively press, press,
press the legs out.
And then here we go, 
advanced layer (clicks tongue)
squeeze the legs into the arms.
So we're creating a 
little push and pull here.
So just work 
where you are today.
Make sure you're breathing deep.
Then we're gonna stay 
in this squat variation.
Heels down or maybe in a 
little time moving froggy.
Or we're gonna transition 
to a little Crow practice.
Crow practice, this is 
not the mastery of Bakasana.
This is not that school.
Not today.
So we'll spread the 
palms wide if you're down.
Otherwise, keep breathing.
Digging in where 
it's right for you today.
You want to make sure 
you have a nice wide base.
We're gonna keep all of this
work we've been doing of looking
forward, kind of 
into our reflection,
that length in the neck.
We call this the Dunda.
This image of the staff or
the stick from 
the crown to the tail.
You're gonna keep that here.
We're gonna draw 
the upper arm bones out,
just like we do in 
Downward Facing Dog.
And we'll inhale, 
walk the toes together,
bring the knees up 
towards the armpit chest.
Exhale, connect to your 
core as you look forward,
maybe leaning forward 
into the fingerprints.
And you can just play here.
Rocking back and forth,
experimenting with your center
and your strong foundation.
And then maybe you 
get to a point where you
keep your gaze 
forward and lift one toe.
And then maybe the other.
And then you might just find
that you work here with your
breath to lift both legs up,
excuse me, both feet up.
Eventually working here,
drawing the navel up.
Finding your breath.
Digging in.
After a couple 
of moments of play,
wherever you are...
we're gonna let it go.
And we're gonna come through
a seat and onto our backs.
Take your time.
Awesome work.
Come on down to the ground.
We're gonna bring the 
feet as wide as the yoga mat.
So, super wide.
And then you're just gonna
windshield wiper your legs to
one side, any side and 
just let it pause there.
Should feel good.
You can let 
the hands rest gently
on your low ribs or your belly.
Start to relax your shoulders.
Start to melt the weight 
of your body into the earth.
Alright, switch, 
come through center.
Windshield wiper 
to the opposite side.
And if you need 
a little more here,
you can actually 
take the bottom leg,
cross that ankle over the
top leg for a deeper stretch.
We'll do it again on the
other side if you want to do it.
Alright. Take it through center.
One more time to each side.
Again, you can 
take that bottom leg,
cross it over the 
top for a deeper stretch.
Start to relax 
through the torso.
Come back through center.
Final side, relax 
through the shoulders.
Soften through the jaw.
Let your head get heavy.
And then we'll bring it 
all the way through center.
Hug the knees into the chest.
You can grab the outer edges of
the feet if that's available.
Maybe just grabbing part of your
pant leg or palms on the shins
or just below the knee.
We're going to 
squeeze everything up and in.
Squeeze, squeeze, squeeze.
Lift your head, your neck,
your shoulders.
Feel the curvature in the spine
as you breathe in 
for three, two, one.
And exhale for 
three, two, one.
One more time, 
breathe in for three,
two, one.
And exhale for three, two
and release 
everything on the one.
Yes, extend one leg out,
then the other.
Inhale, reach your fingertips
all the way up and overhead.
Big, full body stretch here.
Ready? Take up space.
Inhale, spread the fingertips,
spread the toes.
And exhale, Shavasana, hands
come down gently at your sides.
We're not gonna 
be here long today.
Of course you can always 
pause the video and stay here
as long as 
you like, my darlings.
But wow, this 
notion of digging in,
allowing yourself to dig in.
You'd be surprised.
There are moments where
we're gifted with 
something really special.
And they're all 
these things that say
ah, this is so special.
Thank you, universe.
And then we forget we have
the tools to really dig in.
So sometimes we miss the moment.
Maybe we have some 
fear or vulnerability there,
so we turn and 
walk away before even
giving it a chance. (chuckles)
I know speaking very broadly,
I love you guys.
Here we go, 
take a deep breath in.
Exhale, relax the shoulders.
Digging practice, 
whatever that means to you.
Being present and knowing 
that we are worthy enough
to be in the moment, 
to seize the day, if you will.
Don't let it pass you by, right?
Take one more cycle of
breath here to just embody this
stillness, surrender everything.
Allow, release, let go.
Give yourself permission to
do absolutely nothing here
for but just one moment.
Then gently begin 
to deepen your breath.
Wiggle your fingers,
wiggle your toes.
And when you're ready,
kiss the palms together.
Palm to palm, 
this holy palmer's kiss.
Bringing those thumbs 
right up to the third eye.
Give yourself a 
little massage here.
Right on the forehead, why not?
Lean in, my darlings.
I shall as well.
Thank you for 
showing up here today.
I look forward to 
seeing you mañana.
Take a deep breath in.
And exhale to whisper
Namaste.
(upbeat gentle music)
