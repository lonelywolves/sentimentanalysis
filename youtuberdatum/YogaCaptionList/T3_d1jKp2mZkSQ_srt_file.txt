- Hello, everyone.
Welcome to BREATH,
your 30 day yoga journey.
It's Day 24, Rejuvenate.
Let's get started.
(bright upbeat piano music)
Alright, let's begin in a nice,
comfortable seat of your choice.
Sit up on a little
something if you like.
Bring the hands to the belly.
And we're gonna jump 
right in as we are kicking off
our final week of BREATH,
a 30 day yoga journey.
Benji's on watch here.
Start to lift up
through the heart,
the chest kind of
lifting towards the chin.
Chin gently lifting to the sky.
Shoulder blades melting down.
Tag a little
weight in the elbows.
So to rejuvenate.
The practice won't always
leave you feeling rejuvenated.
Right?
But I love this idea of
coming into close contact with
what it feels like and kind
of understanding and knowing
what it feels like
and what it means to
bring new energy to
something or bring something,
excuse me, bring
energy to something at all.
So often we're kind
of energizing things
that are not
serving us. (laughs)
Whether it's through
our thoughts, actions,
our daily rituals,
our habits, of course.
So just a little
food for thought here
as we move through
the practice today.
We're gonna begin
with breath of fire,
Kapalabhati, to stir the pot.
Energetically give you a
little juice for today's flow.
Inhale in through the nose.
Exhale out through the nose.
Inhale in through the nose.
Exhale out through the nose.
Place one hand
on top of the other
so you have a nice little
marker for where you're moving.
You can even bring fists here.
And just a reminder, 
on the exhale where we are,
excuse me, drawing
the navel in sharply.
Inhale is passive,
exhale is sharp.
Sit up nice and tall.
We'll try to lose this cool move
and really
isolate it to the belly.
And this is a practice
so just do your best.
If you fall off the tracks
just come back
whenever you're ready.
Alright, here we go.
Breath of fire,
Kapalabhati breath.
Just inhale and exhale.
Evenly for nothing 
and then we'll begin.
Ready?
Inhale in through the nose.
And exhale out completely.
And we begin.
Keep it going.
Soften your gaze. 
Close your eyes.
Find your rhythm.
If you fall out of the rhythm,
you'll come right back to it.
Keep the shoulders relaxed,
skin of the face relaxed.
Then inhale in through the nose.
Hands rest on
the knees or thighs
as you slowly exhale
out through the nose.
Pause, remain still.
Just take one second
here to notice how you feel.
And then bat the eyelashes open.
Sway your head, your neck,
your shoulders a little one way
and then the other.
Alright, we have a
week more together,
and then hopefully many more
as this journey is
designed to inspire you
to keep showing up for
regular home practice.
We're swaying.
Benji's up and so are we.
Let's join him.
We're gonna use
that swaying motion
to come forward onto all fours.
You can push 
your pillow or blanket
or block or towel aside
and we're gonna find
Tabletop Position here,
but we're gonna sway the
hips a little left to right.
Knees underneath the hip points.
Wrists underneath the shoulders.
From here we're gonna
take this swaying motion,
and we're gonna start to
move the rib cage in a circle.
So we've been doing Cat-Cow.
You're gonna think
about dropping the rib cage
and then lifting it up.
Dropping the rib cage 
and lifting it up.
And see what that
does to the lumbar.
Feel that sensation as you move
the lower back,
the lower spine.
And then pay attention to
any sensation in the mid back
as well.
Alright, reverse the
direction you're moving in.
Gettin' funky in the final week.
Moving at a nice pace
with your breath here.
Alright, then bring
the big toes to touch.
Walk the knees as
wide as your mat.
Keep the left hand where it is.
Press into the tops of
the feet and slowly inhale,
reach the right fingertips
all the way up towards the sky.
Big twist here, inhale in.
Exhale, thread the needle.
Right fingertips come in
and underneath the
bridge of the left arm.
You come to rest on.
I'm eating my braid hair.
Sorry, my ponytail.
Come to rest on your right ear,
right shoulder, excuse me.
Left fingertips are gonna reach
all the way towards
the front of the mat.
And then we're gonna
pull the right hip crease
towards the right
side of your mat.
Breathe deep here.
And then slowly
press yourself back up.
Right hand comes to the earth.
Inhale, left fingertips 
up towards the sky.
Big breath, big stretch.
Exhale, thread the needle.
Right fingertips reach forward.
Should feel this nice,
beautiful stretch
and opening in the
left upper back body.
That scap area, we're twisting.
We're breathing.
We're pulling
the left waistline,
the left hip crease
towards the left here.
Should feel nice love
in the left low back.
Good, and then slow and
steady as you're ready,
make your way back up.
Spread the fingertips.
Walk the knees back
underneath the hips.
Curl the toes under.
Hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Pedal it out here
for a couple of breaths.
Keep pressing into the
knuckles and the fingerprints.
So there's hardly any
pressure in the wrists here.
Benji.
Alright.
Now find stillness.
Turn your toes inward so
you feel that inner rotation
of the shin, the knee,
the thighbone.
The hip.
Good, then you're gonna
bend just your right knee,
just your right knee,
and slowly turn to look
under your left armpit chest.
Good. Then drop the right heel.
Bend just the left knee,
and move slowly, 
turn to look
underneath your
right armpit chest.
Good, then slowly
come back to center.
Bend both knees,
inhale, look forward.
And exhale to make
your way to the top.
Uttanasana, Standing Forward
Fold at the top of your mat,
feet hip width apart 
or flush together.
You know what to
do here, breathe.
Good. Spread awareness through
all four corners of the feet.
Bend your knees.
And then there's
an option here today
to walk the hands
underneath the feet.
Now, I'll walk you through it.
So you're gonna take your hands,
toes meet at the wrist line,
and you can do one at a
time or both at the same time.
If you feel pretty stable here,
or you've been here before,
make sure to relax the
weight of your head over,
and you can wiggle your
toes here to massage the wrists,
base of the palm.
Maybe shifting a
little forward and back.
Getting intimate with the
sound of your breath here.
Bringing a new
energy to the practice
to your commitment
for this final week.
Okay, release the
hands nice and slow
and start to
roll it up to standing.
Take a second to
check in with the head,
the neck, the shoulders.
Maybe looping the shoulders
one way and then the other.
Then step your feet a little
bit wider than hip width apart.
Hands come to the waistline,
and we're gonna move the
hips in a circular motion one way
and then the other.
So think about what
it means to rejuvenate,
like bring new energy.
Can you kind of
get out of your head?
♪ And into my car ♪
Just Kidding.
Get out of your head
and kind of into your body in
a new way for this final week.
Can we just be open to that?
Take it the other way.
And then one more time
switching the directions
like you're hula-hooping here.
Alright, then
without looking down,
you know the ground is there.
Again, see feelingly as
you bring the feet together
really together and inhale,
reach for the sky.
Good, exhale, Forward Fold 
all the way down.
Inhale, halfway lift 
with airplane arms.
Now, pause here. 
Keep breathing.
So the front body is
hugging up to meet the back body
so that the low back
is nice and long here.
I just caught myself
locking out my knees.
So soft bend in the knees,
airplane arms.
Imagine you're
pressing the palms face down
into a hard surface.
It's imaginary obviously,
but pressing here.
So there's energy.
And then lengthen a little
more through the neck if you can
as you draw the
shoulder blades together.
It's a lot.
Good, inhale in here again.
And exhale to let it all go.
Shake the head loose.
Wiggle the fingertips.
Fingertips come to the earth.
We're gonna slide
the left toes back.
Slide the left toes back.
And a nice and easy, 
left hand comes to the ground.
Right fingertips up to
the sky as you breathe in.
Exhale, right hand down,
right foot back, Plank Pose.
Big breath in here.
Exhale, Downward Facing Dog.
Beautiful. Inhale in again.
Exhale, you're just
gonna slide the left foot up
nice and easy.
Right hand to the earth.
Inhale, left fingertips up high. 
Big breath, big twist here.
And exhale nice and easy.
Left hand comes down,
stepping the left foot back.
We're warming up
here nice and slow.
I'm gonna invite
you to rock front
and then back in the toes.
Front and back, front and back,
front, and then the
next time you go back,
send the hips up high and
back, Downward Facing Dog.
Beautiful. 
Drop the left heel, inhale,
lift the right leg up high.
Bend the right knee.
Stack the hips here.
So you're gonna bring the
right hip over the left here.
I'm gonna try to press
into both palms evenly
and drop my right shoulder.
Great, inhale in here.
Exhale, step your
right foot all the way up
and through again.
Pivot on the back foot.
Inhale, fingertips 
reach up, Warrior I.
Front knee stays bent.
As you exhale, open up 
to the left, Warrior II.
Pull the pinkies back.
Front knee stays bent,
strong legs.
Right fingertips all
the way up and over.
Peaceful Warrior, inhale in.
And exhale,
cartwheel all the way back.
Allow the hands
to frame the foot.
Come up on the fingertips.
Then we're gonna step
that back foot in halfway
for a little Pyramid
or modified Pyramid.
So you can keep the heel lifted
if the legs are
feeling really tight,
or we can drop that back heel
and start to work
for that Pyramid Pose.
So it just depends on how
long your muscles are today.
Breathe deep, everyone.
Pull the right hip crease back.
Alright, option to bring 
the palms together here
at the heart.
Inhale, halfway lift.
And then exhale, fingertips,
hands back to the mat.
We'll kick the left foot back,
come back to our lunge.
Beautiful. Plant the palms here.
Step the right toes back
and sending it all the way 
to the belly with control.
Good. Inhale, Cobra.
Breathe in, press into 
the tops of the feet.
Exhale, slowly release.
Inhale, back up to Plank.
Quietly whisper to yourself,
"I am strong."
I am strong.
And then send the
hips up high and back.
If you missed the
whisper that time,
you'll have another chance.
Anchor the right heel.
Inhale, Three-Legged Dog.
We lift the left leg up high.
So feel here, this even 
distribution of weight
between both palms.
Shoulders are in the same plane.
And then we'll bend the
left knee, stack the hips,
try to maintain
that connection though,
even distribution of
weight in the hands,
shoulders in the same plane.
Breathe.
And then slowly,
guiding that left knee
all the way up and through,
stepping it
lightly all the way up.
Reminder, you can
always use your left hand
to guide that
foot all the way up.
And when you're ready,
pivot on the back foot.
Strong legs.
Sweep the fingertips forward,
up and back, Warrior I.
Press into the 
outer edge of your right foot.
And exhale, here we go, 
Warrior II, open it up wide.
Front knee stays bent.
Inhale, left fingertips reach
forward, up and back, way back.
And then exhale,
cartwheel it all the way down.
Frame the left foot
with your fingertips.
Step the back foot
up halfway for Pyramid
or modified Pyramid 
with the heel up.
So there's a tiny micro
bend in that front knee,
and we're all actively pulling
the left hip crease back.
We're not letting the rib
cage splay down and forward
but hugging it in,
finding that containment,
finding our center.
Beautiful. Breathe here.
Option to inhale, halfway lift
palms together at the heart.
Long, beautiful neck.
Lots of core connection.
And then exhale, release.
Everyone, kick that
right foot all the way back
into your lunge.
Plant the palms.
Step the left toes back.
Okay, listen carefully.
From here, we're gonna turn onto
the outer edge
of the right foot,
inner arch of the left foot.
Peek at me if you need to.
Now press away from your
yoga mat with the right hand.
Take your left hand
to your right rib cage.
You got this.
Then with your left hand,
imagine you're smearing 
honey on your rib cage
as you open left fingertips
all the way up towards the sky.
You can stack the feet here.
If this is much too much,
bend your top knee,
left foot comes to the
ground for a nice kickstand.
Everyone lift your hips,
lengthen through
the crown of the head.
Neck is nice and long.
You got this.
Smile if you can. Lift the 
corners of the mouth.
You're awesome.
Make adjustments if you need to.
And then slowly release.
Beautiful, we're taking
it right to the other side.
Outer edge of the left foot,
inner arch of the right foot,
press away from your
yoga mat with your left hand.
Right hand comes
to the left rib cage,
and we smear that
honey all the way across.
Right fingertips
up towards the sky.
We might stack the feet here,
or we might bend the right knee.
Bring the right foot to the
ground for a nice kickstand.
Everyone lift your hips.
Turn on those obliques.
You got this.
Maybe looking up past
your right fingertips.
Breathing.
And then slow and with control
bring it all the way back down.
Inhale to look forward,
shift forward.
Exhale, lower to the belly.
Inhale for Cobra, your version.
And exhale to
soften and release.
Listen up, we got this.
Curl the toes under, inhale.
Exhale, press up,
power up, Plank.
Quietly, whisper to
yourself here, "I am strong."
I am strong. Affirm.
And then send the
hips up high and back.
Inhale in deeply.
And exhale completely.
Listen carefully.
Walk the feet to the middle
of your mat, hip width apart,
and slowly inhale, halfway lift.
Slowly Forward Fold.
Hands come to the waistline.
And nice and slow here,
root to rise,
ground through the feet,
lift from your heart,
come all the way to standing.
Pull the elbows back.
Start to open up
through the pecs, the chest.
Boom, superhero pose.
Mhmm, mhmm.
Alright, from here,
lift your center.
Think up and over as you
shift to that right foot.
We're not collapsing here. 
We know this.
Alright, all the
way up and over.
Hands are on the waist.
I'm gonna take my left toes out.
Again, not collapsing 
in that right foot
but feeling the muscles 
of this right leg turn on.
The glute's nice and strong.
Holding onto that
midline connection here.
I'm gonna send my right
fingertips up on a diagonal,
and left fingertips out
as if I was in Warrior II.
Inhale in here, expand.
Exhale, nice and slow,
I'm gonna work to bring my
right elbow to my left knee,
rounding through the
spine as if I were in Cat Pose.
Good, inhale to
expand and extend.
Exhale, bring it in.
And left arm is
nice and steady here.
Inhale to expand.
Exhale, contract.
Now, to challenge yourself,
you can keep the left
toes lifted as you expand.
Inhale and exhale.
Or left toes on the
ground to hold steady.
Three more with your breath.
Really contracting, feeling
that low belly as you come in.
Last one.
And release.
Mountain Pose.
Take a deep breath in.
Squeeze the 
shoulders up to the ears.
And exhale, drop it with an 
exhale out through the mouth.
Good, again like that.
Squeeze and lift.
And exhale, sigh it out.
Good. Shifting over 
to the left foot.
Hand start on the waistline.
Right toes point out.
Lift through the front body,
grounding through the back body.
So I'm not here.
I'm working with opposition.
I'm marrying this
strength with the grace, right?
The effort and the ease 
weaving together. (chuckles)
Left fingertips all
the way up on a diagonal.
Right fingertips
out to hold you steady.
Inhale, expand, blossom.
Exhale, here we go.
Left elbow to
right knee, squeeze.
Inhale to expand.
Strong standing leg.
Exhale to contract.
Inhale.
Exhale.
Inhale.
And exhale.
Just taking stock. 
You got this. Inhale.
Exhale, you might start to
keep that right foot lifted,
and you might not.
No worries.
Pressing into all four
corners of the right foot.
Don't forget about the
back two corners of the heel.
Three more. We got this.
And slowly release.
Mountain Pose.
This time, inhale, send the
fingertips out left to right,
then all the way up 
towards the sky.
And exhale, hands
back down to the heart.
Good, again, inhale.
Send it out, reach it up,
gather it, and bring it back in.
Then again, 
send it down and out.
Gather it and bring it back in.
Walk the feet together.
No need to look down. 
You know that earth is there.
Your awareness
is so awesome now.
You're like, got it.
There's magic, right?
Fingertips go down to come up.
Inhale, gather it,
bring it back in.
Send the fingertips out wide.
Catch a falling star,
put it in your pocket.
Save it for a rainy day.
Palms together at the heart.
(chuckles)
And take a second to notice.
What does this moment
feel like, the present?
What is your relationship
or your regard to your own
very beautiful,
if I might slip in that word,
your own very
beautiful presence?
I feel like people who
are aware of their presence
are so precious, right?
So I hope that this
practice is rejuvenating
for you, bringing a new
energy to your awareness,
maybe even your interests
of your own precious presence.
Alright, I look forward
to seeing you tomorrow.
Bring the thumbs
right up to the forehead.
Take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
Drop the thumbs
right to the lips.
Take a deep breath in.
Long sweet breath out.
And one last breath cycle as you
draw the hands to the heart.
Inhale, lots of love in.
Relax your shoulders 
as you bow the head
and breathe lots of love out.
Thank you.
Namaste.
(bright upbeat piano music)
