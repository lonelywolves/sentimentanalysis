- What's up everyone? 
Welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and today 
we have an awesome
yoga for change and drain.
So this practice is 
gonna be really great if you're
experiencing some sort of change
and it's 
manifesting in the body.
This is what happens.
Our body is incredibly smart and
whether it's just a change in
schedule or something a 
little bigger in your life,
change that might be affecting
the way you're moving or just
your energy level this yoga
practice is here to support you.
So hop into something 
comfy and let's get started.
(gentle music)
Okay pals, welcome.
Let's begin in a 
nice cross-legged seat.
Come on down to the ground.
Move the fleshy part 
of the buttocks aside.
Whatever it is you're 
coming to the mat with today
just come with it fully.
If you're just in 
need of a little movement,
a little stimulus or 
if you're totally drained,
totally tired let's see 
if we can investigate
and allow the
power tools of yoga and 
pranayama to move us in a
direction where we feel good.
Sit up nice and tall.
And we're going to 
begin with the hands together,
Anjuli Mudra at the heart.
So just take your 
time getting there.
And just keep the 
elbows soft here for now.
Let's ease in.
Just kind of allowing, again,
ourself to come as we are,
show up with whatever 
we have even if it's very,
very little energy.
I got your back.
Close your eyes.
Make a wish, just kidding.
Close your eyes and just allow
your mind and body to
land here in the moment.
And when you're ready, gently
draw the chin to the chest,
bow your head toward your heart.
Just feel that nice release in
the back of the neck, the traps.
And make a commitment to stick
with your practice 
here to the end.
See what happens.
Hardest part is showing up
and you've done that 
so let's rock and roll.
Here we go. Open the eyes, 
take a deep breath in,
begin to lift the 
chin parallel to the earth.
Fingertips are gonna 
come down to the ground.
We're gonna start by opening
up the chest a little bit.
You're going to 
walk the fingertips back
as far as you can go.
And this is a 
great just check into.
Like if you only 
make it here, great.
Then we'll just know okay, 
I need to open up through
the pecs and the chest 
in weeks to come.
In time you can 
work the fingertips back.
We'll just start with 
a gentle heart opener.
Lifting up through 
the armpit chest.
Lifting up through the sternum.
You're gonna get a little
lymph massage movement today
so breathe deep.
Let's make the most of 
our time here together.
Take a deep breath in.
Send your gaze 
up towards the sky.
We're not crunching in 
the back of the neck at all.
We're just carving a line 
with the nose up towards
the ceiling or the clouds.
And then on an exhale
draw your navel in
and draw your 
chin to your chest.
Press into your 
fingertips wherever they are.
Inhale, sliding the 
nose all the way up.
And exhale, drawing 
the chin all the way down.
So try to find some nuances
here as you maybe press into the
pinky as you lift the nose up.
And ground through the thumbs
as you draw the chin down.
Do one more on your own.
Find your breath.
And chin to chest.
Fabulous.
Slowly release the hands.
Right arm's gonna 
go over the left here.
Give yourself a big hug.
You're gonna really try to inch
your fingertips in towards the
center of your back body
and again just use this as a
opportunity to check in.
Maybe the upper 
back's pretty tight.
And if so, you're not alone.
Inhale in, lift the chin.
Exhale. Chin to chest.
Keep the hands where they are.
So same movement as before.
Inhale, lift the heart.
Think Cat-Cow here.
So this is the Cow Pose.
Belly nice and long and 
then exhale chin to chest.
Contact through 
the front body, back body,
spine nice and long.
Great, do one more, inhale.
And exhale, chin to chest.
Awesome, release.
Send the fingertips out.
You're just gonna go to the
opposite side but this time
instead of a hug 
we're gonna to Eagle Arms,
left arm on top.
Inhale to reach the elbows up.
Exhale, chin to chest.
We're stretching all around the
shoulder girdle as we inhale,
lift the elbows up.
Long Puppy Belly
and then exhale, contract.
Navel in.
Do one more on your own.
And then exhale, chin to chest.
Oh yeah.
Great, slowly release.
Fingertips kiss the earth.
Then flip the palms up and
inhale big stretch as you reach
fingertips all the way up.
And then exhale, palms down.
Float fingertips to the earth.
Nice and easy, 
inhale, reach it up.
And exhale, palms down.
Press into something.
Give some energy to 
the fingers, the palms.
And one more time,
with the breath.
Beautiful.
Come forward on 
to all fours now.
Take your time.
Tabletop Position.
I have a little blanky here
today padding my knees just
because when I feel 
kind of tired or achy or like
I don't really want 
to get on the mat,
I add one element that helps 
me feel a little extra comfy.
So if you have a blanket or a
towel you might use it today.
And then we'll 
ground through the hands.
So finding a little 
grounding to the earth here
as we spread the fingertips.
And I invite you to slowly keep
the right knee bent as you lift
the right foot, sole of the
right foot up towards the sky.
Then nice and slow 
we're gonna draw big circles
with the right knee.
And best you can, try to keep
your weight evenly distributed
through both palms.
So we're finding that 
hand to earth connection.
That Hasta Banda, that hand to
earth lock here as you draw big
circles with the right knee.
This is so great especially
if you marry the breath to it
because we start 
to open up the hip,
the low back while also
connecting to the muscles 
of the abdominal wall.
Creating stability and strength
in the shoulders and the arms.
And creating healthy flow of
energy by making sure we're not
clenching in the neck either
way or dropping in the neck but
keeping it nice and long.
Alright, yoga for change.
Notice which direction 
you've established
and then let's change it up.
Take it the other way.
And you're gonna start 
to get a little tired here.
That's normal so reconnect to
your foundation and know that
you're building a nice, 
strong core here as well.
Great, let's do two more rounds.
Mmm and my glutes 
are turning on too.
Hey-o!
Okay, and then release.
From here you're gonna bring the
right foot all the 
way up and through.
Walk the left knee back.
Very helpful if you have a
little padding today to walk it
back and then front knee over
front ankle here as we stay nice
and low in a nice low lunge.
Keep it nice and 
low to the ground.
You might as I am find soft,
easy movement 
here that feels good.
Benji's totally
Zen'ed out today. Sleepy.
And then nice and easy, left
hand's gonna come to the ground.
We're gonna take the right thumb
to the right hip crease and pull
it back and as you do that turn
your right toes out just a bit
and let your heart begin to
open and shine maybe towards
the front right 
corner of your yoga mat.
Excellent.
For our last breath,
let's inhale,
reach right fingertips up.
And then exhale, wiggle the
right fingertips as you walk
everything back to 
your nice low lunge.
Great, inhale to look forward.
Exhale to send the 
right hip crease back.
Again, you can imagine your
right thumb in your right hip
crease pulling it back here as
you flex your right toes
towards your face.
Breathe in.
Breathe out and slowly 
bring it all the way back
to your nice low lunge.
Plant the palms, 
connect to your core.
Oops, sorry buddy. To bring it 
all the way back to all fours.
Reset, nice neutral spine.
Inhale in.
Exhale to press away from your
yoga mat and as you're ready
begin to lift the left knee up.
So left knee stays bent.
You can even start to 
feel this in the lower belly,
those deep core muscles.
Sole of the left 
foot to the ground.
Careful not to 
stack the hips here.
We want to turn on the core and
stay connected to the hands by
keeping the hips 
as level as possible.
And then here we go, 
big circles with the left knee.
The more you can sync up with
your breath here the better.
The more I think you'll 
get out of the practice.
Once you feel like you 
know what you're doing,
you might soften your gaze,
take it down, or even
close your eyes 
for a couple rounds.
Just really focusing 
on the sensation.
What's going on 
in that left hip?
How is it connected 
to the whole body?
Make sure you're keeping a
nice soft bend in the elbows.
And then acknowledge whatever
way you've established here and
then let's change it up.
Inevitably moving 
in the other direction.
Stay firm in your foundation.
Fingertips clawing to earth.
Top of the right 
foot firmly rooting down.
Okay, stick with it.
Do two more rounds.
You got it.
Round.
Ooh.
And then all the way through
and up into your nice low lunge.
My left hip was a 
little stickier than my right.
Hopefully you noticed what's
going on in your hips too.
Right knee 
comes back just a bit.
We feel this deep stretch.
Root chakra grounding down.
Heart chakra moving forward.
We got this.
Breathing deep.
Maybe soft, easy movement
here as you notice how you feel.
Okay, and then right hand's 
gonna come to the earth.
Left thumb is gonna come to the
left hip crease and you're gonna
use that left thumb as you
pull back to open up left toes.
Oh yeah.
Towards the 
left side of the mat.
Breathe here.
Let your heart begin to open.
Chest spirals up.
Perhaps shining heart center or
your sternum towards the front
left corner of your mat.
And then for our final breath
cycle here we're gonna inhale,
reach the left fingertips up.
Ooh, and then on an 
exhale bring it back down.
We'll bring everything 
back to that nice low lunge.
Inhale in, full refreshing
breath in and on an exhale
pull the left hip crease back.
Keep your left 
foot nice and active,
flexing towards your face.
Big cycle of breath here.
Inhaling in.
And exhaling out.
Begin to take 
your center forward.
Come back to 
that nice low lunge.
Plant the palms 
and we'll come back to,
ooh, all fours.
Fabulous.
From here you're gonna 
bring the big toes to touch,
the knees as wide 
as your yoga mat
and you're gonna 
send the hips back.
Melt your heart down, 
forehead toward the earth,
take a rest.
Close your eyes again
and just enjoy a 
quiet moment here
low to the ground.
Keep a nice active breath here.
So the body is still 
but the breath keeps moving.
Okie doke then 
slowly come on through.
Bring the knees back 
underneath the hip points.
We're gonna bring the hands
underneath the wrists first and
then bring the elbows 
right where the hands are.
So your elbows are right 
underneath your shoulders.
Spread the hands wide.
Fingers wide, excuse me.
And nice and easy you're 
gonna curl the toes under
and send one leg back.
What? She tricked us
and then the other,
Forearm Plank.
Aw man, but don't get mad.
This is yoga for change.
How do we react 
to things like this?
When we're challenged, when
we're seemingly asked to do
something we don't want 
to do, what's your vibe?
How can you hang?
And if you're like, "Well really
truly I get the lesson but my
"body can't do that," then let's
do Half Forearm Plank for you
with the knees down 
and the toes up.
If you're breathing 
then you're doing it right.
Keep breathing.
You've got it.
Three, two, everyone slowly
lower to the belly on the one.
Okay, keep the 
elbows where they are.
Draw the shoulders away 
from the ears, Spinx Pose.
So you're gonna press 
pubic bone into earth.
Press the tops of the feet down
and inhale, open the chest.
Grounding, grounding, grounding.
Neck nice and long.
We're not crunching here or
dropping the head but a nice
balance, a nice 
awareness in the neck.
Nice and long.
Breathing, breathing, breathing.
Mmmm, gorgeous 
and then here we go.
One more curl the toes under.
Inhale in, exhale, 
hug the low ribs in,
draw your navel to your spine,
reach the heels back 
for Forearm Plank.
Breathing deep, you got it.
Alright, here we go,
check it out.
You're gonna turn on to the
outer edge of your left foot,
inner arch of your right foot.
Inhale, reach right fingertips
all the way up towards the sky.
And then exhale,
come on through.
Forearm Plank.
Only doing this once on 
each side, you got it.
Then turning to the
opposite side, here we go.
Right elbow's right 
underneath my right shoulder.
I got this as I inhale, 
reach up and then exhale,
come all the way back down.
Amazing work.
Bring the knees to the ground,
keep the elbows where they are.
Anahatasan, Puppy Posture.
We're chillin' out from here
on to the end of this practice.
You're doing great.
Hips up high.
Forehead toward the earth.
Heart melts down as we open the
shoulders and get a good wash.
So breathe deep.
Massaging the 
internal organs here.
Keeping firmly rooted 
through your hands
and just noticing how you feel.
If you need a little more today,
you can now transition from
Puppy Posture to Downward Dog.
But if you're still 
feeling a little drained,
a little tired stay in
Anahatasan, Puppy Posture.
I'll stay here with you.
We'll do three to 
five more breaths.
When you're ready, slowly
begin to make your way back up.
Take your time.
Nice and slow.
Nice and slow.
We're gonna come to a 
seat in Cobbler's Pose.
So you can use your blanket to
sit up on a little 
bit if you like.
And as you bring your head over
your heart and your heart over
your pelvis here just feel
this kind of flush of energy.
Hopefully a good sensation kind
of melt from the ears down the
neckline to the 
traps and the shoulders.
And I like to sit 
up on the blanket
or towel from time to time.
Sorry, I'm working around my
dog today which is part of the
at-home yoga experience 
as many of you know.
But I love to lift 
the hips so I can just find
a little more in the posture.
It may not always 
feel necessary but again,
particularly on days where you
just need a little extra love,
a little push out of sedentary,
it's nice to bring some props.
And it's also nice to 
do a little self massage.
So as you come into 
your Cobbler's Pose,
bring the heels out wide enough
so that you can take your thumbs
to the arches of your feet 
and that's where we're gonna
begin a little massage.
You can send your gaze down
at your feet and just pull,
pull, pull back from 
the arches a little bit.
And then I'm gonna quiet down 
a little bit but I would like
for you to take the next 
couple cycles of breath
to explore your feet.
Whatever that means to you.
Give yourself a little massage.
You can stay on your arches or
you can start to work towards
the heels, the toes, the ankles.
And again, I'm just 
gonna stay out of
your business for a second.
Let you send your attention 
down towards your feet.
Breathing lots of love in.
And lots of love out.
Don't decide where it ends.
Alright, keep going.
Getting a nice 
opening in the hips as well.
Alright and then 
last little bit here,
little, um,
wacky but a fun little wake up.
A little stimulus 
to help you get along
on your merry way and
not only rock and roll with
the waves of change but find the
energy you need to hopefully
make positive change
in your life. (chuckles)
You're gonna 
bring the knees together.
Get my blanket back.
And you're gonna 
come to a seat with
your feet right out in front.
So bring the legs together.
Come on back.
You can use your 
hands behind you.
This is a little ditty that I
used to do in kids yoga but I've
definitely done it at least 50
adult yoga classes now so this
is one for all the ages.
You're gonna 
lift your front body,
ground down 
through the shoulders,
take a deep breath in.
Lift your legs and then as
you exhale we're gonna start to
bring the soles of the feet to
the ground and just create a
little slapping 
effect on the ground.
And you can do it as 
light or as hard as you like.
It's fun when we do 
this with a group of people.
It sounds like the 
sound of rain pitter-patting.
And we're just waking up.
Sorry buddy.
We're waking up 
the soles of the feet.
All that energy is translating
up through the ankles.
Keep going.
Up through the shins, the knees.
Sorry Benji. (chuckles)
The thighs.
Waking up all the 
pets in the house too.
Keep it going.
Anything that's not serving you
maybe we just stamp it out now.
We don't need it.
Keep it going 
for three, two, one.
Cross the ankles, sit up tall.
Flip the palms up, Sukhasana.
Back to that cross-legged seat.
Take a deep breath in.
As you exhale, 
relax your shoulders
and notice how you feel.
Nice work.
Let's bring the palms 
together back at Anjuli Mudra,
at the heart.
And just take a little moment
here to give thanks for yourself
for choosing this practice.
For listening to 
your inner wisdom
when it whispered move.
Find what feels good.
Love you so much.
Thanks for sharing your practice
with me and all of the amazing
people practicing 
right now around the world.
Let us know how you're feeling
in the comment section down
below and I'll 
see you next time.
Namaste.
(gentle music)
