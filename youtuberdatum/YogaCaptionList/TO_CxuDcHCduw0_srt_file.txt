- Hi everyone.
Welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and
today we're 
reuniting with the body
and it feels so good.
So hop into something comfy,
and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Alrighty my darling friends,
let's begin today's 
practice at the top of the mat,
in Mountain Pose.
Carefully place your feet,
stand up nice and tall,
lift your heart, 
and bring your palms together,
Anjuli Mudra, 
let's start this practice
by closing the eyes.
And taking a deep breath in.
Use your exhale to actively 
relax the shoulders down.
Let go of any stress or tension
that might've built up there.
And today's session 
is all about reuniting
with what matters most.
And we know that 
when we get disconnected
from the things 
that matter most,
time with ourself, our breath,
disconnection to center,
whatever it is,
then it starts to 
manifest in the body,
and we can get a little stiff,
or we can even get sick.
So today, we're just 
gonna tend to the body
with the beautiful flow.
We're gonna jump right in,
so you bring the breath,
and bring a little 
gratitude for this time
that's so valuable.
Thank you for 
sharing it with me.
When you're ready,
bend your knees.
Drop your fingertips down,
spread the fingertips wide.
As you inhale, 
reach up towards the sky,
big breath, 
so big stretch here.
And then exhale to bend the
knees, send your fingertips
down towards the ground,
Forward Fold.
Three cycles of breath here
as you get the 
head below the heart.
You can bend your knees as
generously as you like here.
You can shake the head 
a little yes, a little no.
Even clasp opposite elbow
and rock gently side to side.
Start to find 
what feels good here.
Again, letting 
any stress or tension
that may have accumulated 
in any area of the body,
allowing this 
practice with the breath
to help release 
that, relieve you
of any tightness that 
has accumulated in the body.
(softly chuckles) 
Benji's relaxing here.
In your next inhale, 
let's lengthen the crown
of the head forward, lift 
the spine up about halfway.
You wanna create 
length in the neck
as you breathe in.
And then use your exhale
to slowly fold it back down.
Alright, from here, fingertips
are gonna come to the mat,
we're gonna kick the 
right foot all the way back,
lower the right 
knee to the ground.
Front knee stays 
over front ankle
and we start to stretch 
it out here, breathing deep.
Inhale, open your chest,
look forward.
Exhale, peel the 
left hip crease back.
Flex your left toes towards
your face, big stretch here.
Inhale to find 
length in the neck,
maybe look forward again.
And then exhale, 
roll through that left foot.
We're gonna lift the back knee.
Get light on the fingertips,
big stretch here.
Inhale, draw the 
shoulder blades together.
Let your heart 
energy radiate forward.
Then exhale, plant the palms,
step the left toes 
back to Plank or Half Plank.
Take a deep breath in as you
puff up through your back body,
hollow through the front body,
Big breath in.
Long breath out.
And then inhale 
then look forward.
Shift forward on the toes.
Exhale to keep elbows 
hugging into the side body
as you lower all the 
way down to the floor,
or your dog's paw.
Then inhale, press 
into the tops of the feet,
lift your chest up, 
Bhujangasana, Cobra,
nice and low here 
to start. Hey, bud.
And then exhale, release.
Curl the toes under,

to all fours here, 
or power up to Plank.
From all fours or Plank Pose,
send the hips up and back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Inhale, lots of love in 
here as you pedal it out,
stretching through 
the side body.
And exhale, reconnecting to
the fingerprints, the knuckles,
your foundation.
Awesome, here we go, 
inhale in here, exhale.
Find stillness in Downward Dog.
Keep breathing.
And then when you're ready,
bend the knees, carve a 
line with your nose, look up.
You're gonna step just right
foot, just the right foot,
all the way up, 
lower the left knee down.
Great, nice low lunge 
here on the other side,
front knee over front ankle.
Breathe deep, stretch.
Great, inhale to open 
your chest, look forward.
Exhale to slowly 
take the hips back.
So notice how my left 
hip is over my left knee.

Inhale to open the chest,

and exhale to roll 
through your right foot.
Get light on the fingertips.
You're gonna 
lift the back knee,
strong back leg here.
Reach your left 
heel towards the back.
As you inhale, tug the 
shoulders away from the ears,
open the chest, 
think about drawing
your shoulder blades 
in towards each other here
and melting them 
down the back body.
Great, awesome work, 
inhale in.
Exhale to plant the palms.
Step it back to 
Plank or Half Plank.
Hug the elbows 
into the side body.
Look forward, shift forward.
Keep breathing as you 
lower down all the to the belly
or to your dog's chest, 
then inhale, rise up,
maybe a little bit higher this
time, Bhujangasana, Cobra.
And use your exhale to 
slowly lower it down.
Press up to Plank or all fours,

take deep breath in.
And then exhale, 
hips up high and back,
Downward Facing Dog,

Beautiful, ground 
through the left heel now.
Inhale, lift the

From here, you're 
gonna again make sure

knee to kiss the earth
and take your right 
hand over to meet the left.
So we're here in a 
bit of a Lizard variation.
Awesome, from here 
you're gonna walk the palms
out off the mat, 
creating what feels
like a Downward Dog 
shape in the front body.
And then option to keep the
back knee down on the earth
or we'll lift it up,

Nice work. 
In your Downward Dog,
anchor through the 
right heel this time.
Inhale, lift the 
left leg up high.
Exhale, shift it 
forward nice and easy.
Try to step that 
left foot up lightly.
Then when you're ready, check
front knee over front ankle,
ground down through all four
corners of the front foot
as you lower your 
right knee to the earth.
Great, swing 
your left arm around
and we'll walk it out 
this time, off the mat,
towards the front 
right corner of your mat
or towards your dog's face.
And breathing deep here.
Option to lift the back knee.
Really strong in

from the pelvic floor.
You're breathing into all
four sides of the torso here.
Soften through the jaw,
soften through the skin
of the forehead, take 
one more big breath in.
Good, and then slowly,

Move with your breath here,
no need to rush.
We'll meet in 
Downward Facing Dog.
Hips up high,
heart melting towards 
the tops of the thighs.
Try to find that 
external rotation
in Downward Dog in 
the upper arm bone.
So your biceps are 
shining in towards your ears,
elbow creases towards 
the front edge of your mat.
Awesome work, inhale in.
Exhale, slowly bend your knees,
carve a line with 
your nose to look forward
and then slowly 
make your way to the top.
Keep breathing, you can hop,
you can step.
You can crisscross, and 
then when you get there,
use your next inhale to find
that flat back 
position once again,
lengthen through 
the crown of the neck.
And exhale to soften,
fold everything down.
Root to rise here, inhale,
reach for the skies,
spread the fingertips, big
beach ball up and overhead.
And then exhale, palms 
kiss together overhead
and slide back down into home.

right leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward.
Step it all the way up.
This time, 
pivot on the back foot
and rise up strong, Warrior I.
Reach the fingertips up high,
pull your right hip crease back.
Back foot is strong, 
left toes turning in,
and sometimes people will ask me
what the knife 
edge of the foot means
when I say press 
in the knife edge.
It means that sharp outer edge
of your foot is grounding down
so you kind of feel this
lift through your inner arch.
Find Virabhadrasana I here,
Warrior I,
lift your chest, inhale in.
Exhale to rain it all the way
down, pivot on the back foot.
Plant the palms, 
step the right toes back.
You can go straight

Moving with your breath.
We'll meet in Downward Dog.
When you get there, again,

get into your body.
Give your thinking mind a break.
Anchor the right heel,
when you're ready, inhale,
lift the left leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward,
strong core.
Step it up lightly, 
we'll pivot on the back foot,
back toes turned in, 
and when you're ready,
we rise up strong, 
Virabhadrasana I, Warrior I.
Strong legs, pressing into the
outer edge of that back foot,
hug the low ribs in, 
breathe deep, inhale.
And then exhale, 
raining it down.
Come back to your lunge,

Inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale, Forward Fold 
all the way down.
Inhale, halfway lift 
with the breath, exhale fold.
Beautiful, from here,
plant the palms,

Exhale to empty it out.
Inhale, lift the right 
leg up here, Three-Legged Dog.
Exhale to shift it forward.
Step it all the way up.
This time keep 
the back heel lifted,
you could always 
lower the back knee,
and we're gonna inhale, 
sweep the fingertips forward,
up and back, high lunge.
Front knee over front ankle,
strong and steady here,
connecting to the core,
draw your navel
in and up just a bit, 
find that inner support system.
Then from here we're 
gonna bring the palms together,
up and overhead, slowly take
the fingertips to the right.
Feel this stretch 
in the left-side body,
front of the left hip crease,
as you do a deep twist 
over towards the right,
bringing the outer 
edge of the left elbow
to the outer edge 
of the right knee.
Again, you could always 
lower the back knee here,
breathing deep. Breathing,
breathing, breathing.
Finding that 
length in the crown.
Find that belly breath.
Reach the back heel way back
if your left knee is lifted,
and then slowly 
bringing it back to center.
Frame your right foot,
plant the palms,
step it back, 
straight to Down Dog,
or moving with your 
breath through a vinyasa.
Reuniting breath and body.
Meet me in Downward Facing Dog.
And when you're ready, 
anchor the right heel first,
and then inhale, 
lift the left leg up high,
Three-Legged Dog.
Exhale, shift it forward,
strong core.
Step it up nice and easy,
squeezing your thighs
to the midline as you 
swoop the fingertips forward,
up and back, 
find your high lunge.
Beautiful, stick with it,
stay calm,
control your breath, inhale in.
Exhale, palms kissed 
together up and overhead.
Slow tilt to the left,
strong foundation here
as you feel that 
stretch in the right side body,
and as you're ready, 
diving into your twist here.
Back knee can come to 
the ground at any time,
spiraling your 
heart up towards the sky.
Strong back leg if you 
have the right knee lifted.
Now everyone, 
return to the breath.
Breathe into your belly,
massage those internal organs.
Lengthen through the crown.
You got this, one more inhale
and then use the exhale to
guide you back to the lunge.
(softly mimics swoosh)
Alright, last vinyasa here,
plant the palms,
step it back, 
take it or leave it,
moving with your 
breath nice and slow.
Meet me in 
Downward Facing Dog.
Nice.
In Downward Dog, 
take three deep breaths,
in and out, in and out,
in and out.
Then bend your knees 
after your three breaths.
Make your way to the top 
of your mat nice and slow.
Forward Fold.
And then bending the knees,
tucking the chin,
and go slow here, 
rolling up through the spine.
Observing your breath
noticing the quality 
of air in the room,
the quality of your breath,
and noticing how 
you feel in your body.
As you rise back up
to where we started,
Mountain Pose.
Close your eyes, 
let everything go here.
And just take one 
last final beat to be
in your body.
Let the breath just 
return to its natural rhythm,
natural flow here.
And then slowly 
drawing the palms together
at the heart space, once again,
giving thanks for this time
to just reconnect, reunite.
Find what feels good.
Take one last breath in
then exhale to bow the head
to the hands toward the heart.
Namaste.
(upbeat music)
