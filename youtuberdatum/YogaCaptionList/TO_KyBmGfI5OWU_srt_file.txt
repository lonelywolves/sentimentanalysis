- Hi everyone! 
Welcome to Yoga with Adriene.
I'm Adriene, that's Benji, and
today we have an awesome video
that is gonna guide 
you to work with your arms
and your abdominal wall.
But above and beyond all
that we're gonna focus on our
attitude today, wrapping it up
into one big beautiful yoga bow
so that you feel really good
when you step up off your mat
and into the rest of your day.
Hop into something 
comfy and let's get started.
(bright music)
Alright pals, let's begin
today's awesome practice
on our backs. Yay.
Come on down to the ground.
Thanks for selecting this video.
Thanks for sharing your time
and your energy and your journey
with me and Benji and with all
the beautiful people practicing
with us around the globe.
When you come on down to the
ground take a deep breath in and
as you exhale go ahead and hug
your knees into your chest and
kind of scoop the tailbone up
actively so you can start to
feel your low back get 
nice and flush with the mat.
So in my mind I agreed 
to do this video
and really focus not
just on creating strength in the
abdominal wall and sculpting the
arms, because there's 
nothing wrong with that,
I think that's awesome.
But I wanted to make sure we
also bring an awareness to just
the attitude that exists around
working with the body and notice
I say "with the body" 
and not "on the body."
And yoga provides us just such
an awesome opportunity to go
inward and kind of work inward
as we're getting our workout.
So just a little food 
for thought as we work today.
I am gonna kind of kick your
butt a little so let's start
with a nice easy breezy warm up.
You're gonna hug the 
knees into the chest.
Don't fret.
Take a deep breath in.
As you exhale go ahead and let
your neck get nice and long here
and you can close your eyes and
just allow the sound of my voice
to guide you 
here in the beginning.
Take a deep breath in again 
and this time as you exhale
relax your shoulders down.
And then nice and slow drag your
hands to your kneecaps and we're
just going to take 
the knees around
in some gentle circles.
So create a nice 
circular motion here.
Again, eyes can be closed,
shoulders relaxed.
And we're gonna start 
to breathe a little deeper.
Oh creaky old floor 
here coming out to say hello.
And again, this is an
opportunity for you to yes build
strength in your core.
And yes, we'll tone some 
of the muscles of the arms
but it's yoga so it's 
an opportunity to unite
and hug up to your inner self.
Outer and inner 
holding hands working together.
If you haven't already, reverse
your circle of the knees and if
you find a place that feels
really good to just rock back
and forth go ahead and do that.
Again, using this moment 
to connect with your breath.
And, you know, allow anything
that I'm saying to resonate if
does and if it doesn't,
don't worry.
You're not doing anything wrong.
Just embracing the 
physical practice is fine too.
Just notice and remember 
you have a chance here to
just gain awareness
of the approach,
your attitude.
Because I like to say you know
what's the point of having a
great body if you're still
looking in the mirror and
you don't know 
who you're seeing
or you don't love 
who you're looking at.
Okay, I think I said 
everything I need to say now
let's rock and roll literally.
You're gonna slide your hands
to the backs of your thighs.
And we're going to rock and roll
up and down 
the length of the spine.
You can go easy.
Nice and slow on yourself
here in the beginning.
Be kind.
You can have a sense of humor if
you're not quite getting all the
way up and need 
to use your hands,
use your hands.
So we're massaging up and down
the length of the spine here.
We're also using this as an
opportunity to continue to
deepen the breath.
Sorry buddy.
And then check it out.
The next time you rock up you're
going to rock all the way up
into a little ball position.
So give it a try.
If you don't get there 
in the first try, no prob.
And say you're in a little
squat at the top of your mat.
You're gonna slowly tuck your
chin and we're going to roll up
to this little toe stand here
right away engaging our core.
So the fingertips 
may stay on the earth.
You might have two blocks here
where you might begin to work to
bring the hands 
together at the heart.
Amazing.
Okay, beautiful.
If you are not 
finding it today, trust me,
with practice you'll 
be able to grow this.
We're lifting up 
from the pelvic floor.
We're stretching 
through the fascia of the feet.
We're relaxing 
the shoulders down.
And we're remembering
the third A today, attitude.
How valuable and how important
is your attitude when things get
tough or seem impossible?
Take a deep breath 
in wherever you are.
Okay, and then let it go.
If you have a 
dog in front of you,
go ahead and pet them.
Just seems wrong not to and
if not you can pet 
an imaginary dog.
(chuckles) Okay, here we go.
Forward Fold.
Grounding down 
through the heels.
Take your time.
Start to peddle it out.
Wake up through 
the backs of the legs.
Just letting the blood flow to
the head here as you relax the
weight of the 
head and the neck down.
Okay, then we're 
gonna go back down
into the squat nice and slow.
Beautiful.
Ah, Benji's so cute.
Then use your fingertips to
slowly come onto your bum.
And then you're just going to
keep your feet on the ground
here as you slide your 
bum to the center of the mat.
Great, hands can come 
behind the thighs here.
Loop the 
shoulders lift your heart.
Nice and slow we'll begin to
lift the shins parallel to the
ceiling as you 
lean back just a bit.
Beautiful.
If you can maybe 
fingertips reach forward
but it's okay to work in stages.
Right, be in the now, be present
with where you are today.
Hands can stay behind the thighs
or reaching the
fingertips forward.
Great, inhale in,
lift the chest.
Exhale, send the right toes,
right foot out long as you
straighten 
through the right leg.
We're starting to wake up 
through the abdominal wall
here's so you might 
feel a little shaking.
Keep in mind how powerful 
your attitude here can be.
Smile, lift your heart 
a little more, inhale in.
Exhale, bend the right knee.
Reset with a big breath.
And then on the next 
exhale left toes point,
left leg straightens out.
We breathe here keeping the
chest lifted chin slightly
lifted perhaps breathing 
in and out. One more time.
Breathe in and out.
Great, bend the left knee,
check it out.
Inhale in.
Exhale, we're gonna 
rock all the way
through to our 
nice squat again.
You can use your hands,
it's all good.
Gorgeous. Then we're 
gonna slowly tuck the chin.
Keep the fingertips on 
the earth if you need to.
Otherwise in time we 
bring the palms together.
Namaste at the heart.
A little toe stand here.
I'm working to 
engage my center here.
And then I'm also just noticing
if you're not quite getting
here, if you're getting
frustrated how can we soften our
approach the way 
we look at it, the lens,
the attitude to just 
stay curious and playful.
Okay, one more breath.
Awesome stretch for the foot,
of course, here.
Gonna be so good for your
Downward Dogs and your Planks.
Let's release.
(sighs) When you're ready,
drop the heels.
Uttanasana, Forward Fold.
If you're not at the 
top of your mat here,
go ahead and step to the top.
And just take a 
couple more breaths,
feet together 
or hip width apart.
You can shake the
head a little yes, a little no.
Get a nice long 
stretch in the back body.
Continue to wake up 
the muscles of the legs.
And relax any stress or tension
in the shoulders and the neck.
Okay, one more time pet Benji.
And here we go.
We're gonna roll 
up nice and slow.
Let this be like 
a moving meditation,
this roll up to Mountain.
Here we go.
Then actively press down into
the earth with all four corners
of the feet and find that
lift up through the front body.
Balance it out with that
grounding through the back body
as you come up into 
your beautiful Mountain Pose,
Tadasana.
So we're always trying 
to kind of balance
the Sun and the 
Moon energy in yoga
and I could go off on 
that of course but just
whatever that 
makes you think of,
keep that in mind 
throughout this practice.
So when things get challenging,
how can you find that kind
of soft Moon energy?
Whether it's like 
softening your brow
or changing your approach, 
your attitude.
And then same thing in these
kind of more simpler shapes.
How can you bring 
more action, more activity,
engaging in these 
more subtle postures?
Bringing that Solar energy
to this kind of Moon posture.
Anyway, okay, you get the gist.
So find the balance.
Then we'll really walk 
off the mat feeling good.
And whenever you're ready 
we'll inhale reach the fingertips
all the way up towards the sky.
You can start nice and 
slow spreading the fingertips,
continuing to ground 
down through the feet.
And then up here we're going to
interlace the fingertips to like
a steeple grip so your
index finger's pointing forward.
Alright, check 
in with your body.
For my body I have to really
work to lengthen my tailbone
down and hug my low ribs in.
Then I imagine really 
bringing my low belly,
the lower abdominal wall 
and the upper abs
in towards center.
So there's this kind of action
that we're going to play with of
drawing everything in towards
that like third chakra which is
awesome because it's 
like you're Beyonc√© chakra.
So it's a win-win here.
And talk about 
(chuckles) attitude.
Inhale.
On your next exhale, 
let's practice drawing it in by
sending the hands 
in line with the heart.
You're also 
getting a great stretch
through the upper 
back body here.
Elbow creases are 
up towards the sky
and I'm working to 
engage my core here.
I'm not creating tension.
I'm not clenching my 
buttocks but I'm working to,
again, just bring some energy
in towards that third chakra.
That's the place of confidence
to self-love that kind of
"I am, I can" vibe.
Okay, inhale 
reach for the skies.
Take your steeple grip up.
If the shoulders are tight,
actively relax shoulder blades
down the back body.
And then on the exhale hands
come in and we create a little
connection in the stomach.
Hands in line with the heart.
Now on the last 
one we've got the arms,
we've got the abs like 
what kind of attitude
do you want to bring to it?
What kind of focus 
do you want to take
out past your fingertips?
So here we go.
Inhale, reach up.
And exhale,
hands in line with heart.
Good, inhale to 
reach up towards the sky.
Exhale, give the arms 
a break as you release.
Rain it down all the 
way into a Forward Fold.
Fabulous, inhale, 
halfway lift, your version.
Find length.
Exhale, plant the palms,
step the feet back, Plank Pose.
Now you're gonna walk the wrists
right underneath the shoulders
and then take the 
hands a little bit wide.
And then align your toes with
your hip points here as you
reach, reach, 
reach the heels back.
Start to turn on 
through the quads.
Of course, core is 
turned on here
and then we'll bend 
the elbows and lift up.
As you straighten them, 
lift your heart space up
between your shoulder blades.
We're here for three.
We're here for two and then
we're going to lower 
the knees on the one.
So now we're in a half plank.
Breathing deep.
Creating length in the neck.
And we're here for three.
We're here for two.
And we're here for one.
Now press back up to Plank,
you got this.
We're here for three.
We're here for two.
Welcoming that heat.
We're here for one.
Then lower the knees,
Half Plank for three, two, one.
Come all the way 
down to your belly.
Hi buddy.
Drag the hands in 
line with the rib cage.
Start to stretch 
out through the pecs,
the chest as you squeeze the
elbows into the side body.
Then use your foundation,
press into the earth to rise up,
lift your heart, Bhujangasana.
Big inhale, feel 
that stretch in the belly.
And then exhale 
to release, soften.
Curl the toes under, inhale in.
Exhale, press up to Plank, a
strong one and then take it
to Downward Facing Dog,
hips high and back.
Bend the knees.
Start to really pedal it out.
Try to find a stretch 
to your side body here.
Nice and long.
Great. Then inhale, 
lift the right leg up high.
Exhale, squeeze it forward.
Upper body's in Plank, 
where we just were.
Right knee really 
hugs up towards the chest.
Right heel really hugs 
up towards the right glute.
We're here for three.
Breathe deep, two.
On the one, take it back up,
Downward Facing Dog.
Gorgeous, slowly 
lower the right foot down.
Take it to the second side.
Claw through the fingertips.
No pressure in the wrists.
Inhale, left leg up high.
Exhale.
Cinching in through center.
Squeeze and lift.
Left knee up towards the heart.
Left heel up towards the glute.
We're here for three.
You're doing awesome.
Press away from your yoga mat.
Two, one, kick it back.
Three-Legged Dog.
Lift the left leg up high 
and then very gently
lower it down with control.
Good, bend the knees.
Bring your belly 
towards the tops of your thighs.
Nice stretch here as you
tick-tock the hips 
a little left to right.
And then inhale, 
come back to center.
Carve a line with 
your nose to look forward.
And on an exhale, make your
way to the top of the mat.
You can baby step,
you can ragdoll,
you can hop, float.
Then when you're ready inhale,
halfway lift, your version.
Create length in the neck.
Exhale to soften and 
fold everything down.
Inhale, spread the fingertips.
Root to rise here.
Reach for the sky.
Big stretch so big, big breath.
Big beach ball up and overhead.
And then exhale, 
hands come together and
right back down to the heart.
Take a nice 
cleansing breath here in.
And empty it out.
(audibly exhales)
Beautiful.
Interlace the fingertips, find
that steeple grip once again.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Big stretch.
This time, check it out, we're
gonna softly bend the knees.
On the exhale, hands come in
line with the heart as we lift
the left foot and step 
it all the way back
into a nice high lunge.
So work with your body.
If this is too much 
in the high lunge today,
just lower the left knee 
to the earth and work here.
It's awesome.
Okie doke. So we're squeezing
the inner thighs to the midline.
We're turning on the core.
We're keeping 
the shoulders down.
So biceps up towards the sky.
Beautiful.
Breathing deep here.
All stretched out through that
foot so you're pressing through
your left pinky toe.
Front knee over front ankle.
Try to really focus on the
sensation versus the shape.
So we want to get our alignment
right but we want to work with
the muscles where they are now.
Again, just trying 
to find that balance.
Here we go, inhale.
You're gonna straighten,
really straighten the back leg.
Reach the fingertips,
steeple grip,
up towards the sky.
Exhale, bend your back knee find
that same connection to your
center as you bring the 
hands in line with the heart.
Peek at me if you 
need to on these first few.
Inhale, we reach up 
straighten the back leg.
Exhale, draw it in.
Long exhale here, I'm talking
so I can't really demo but it
should feel like a real good
emptying out of the breath.
Inhale, reach up.
Exhale hug the 
low ribs back and in.
Turn on the abdominal wall,
bend your back knee.
Inhale, reach it up.
Exhale, hug it in.
Good, one more time,
inhale reach it.
Exhale hug it in.
From here back knee's bent.
You're gonna use 
it to step forward.
Here we go.
One, two, nice and 
easy back to Mountain Pose.
We're gonna go right in 
to the second side so inhale,
reach the fingertips up high.
Exhale, hug the low ribs in,
hands come in line with the
heart as you 
lift the right foot.
With control step it 
back nice high lunge.
Find your foundation here first.
Squeeze the 
inner thighs together.
Find that balance of energy.
Upward body lifting up.
Back body grounding down.
Arms are getting 
tired here so breathe.
Soften.
And then here we go, inhale.
Reach for the sky, 
straighten the back leg.
Exhale, hug the low ribs in.
Bend the back knee.
Round it through, really connect
through that low belly too.
Inhale, reach it up.
Exhale, empty it out.
Inhale, reach it up.
Exhale, hands in 
line with the heart.
You can always keep the back
leg straight if it's too much to
bend the knee here today.
Keep it going.
Welcoming that heat.
Creating a full body experience.
Awesome, do one more and the
next time your hands are in line
with the heart, pause there.
Back knee's bent.
Find that connection, 
lift up from the pelvic floor
and from your center, 
hop that back foot all the
way up to meet the front.
Excuse me, buddy.
Excuse me.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Hallelujah, exhale.
Bend the elbows, 
release the arms.
Yay. Take it all the way down.
Take a restful breath here.
You've got it. Inhale in.
Empty it out, 
nice cleansing exhale.
Inhale to halfway lift.
Exhale to soften and fold.
Alright, hang with me.
Plant the palms,
step your feet back, Plank Pose.
So now from here on 
you can work in Half Plank.
I think it's good to work in
Half Plank so you can really
start to turn on the muscles
in your abdominal wall
and not overdo it.
It's good to work in stages.
So it's okay to lower the knees.
We're here. 
We're doing a nice static hold.
We're breathing and there's
gonna come a point where you
want to give up and your
attitude's gonna want to really
kick into another gear 
so just decide what
gear that's gonna be.
I'll count us down.
We're here for ten.
Oh my gosh, Adriene, nine.
Eight, reach the heels back.
Seven, six,
baratta through the neck, five.
Four, three, 
Downward Dog on the one.
Yes, you did it.
Awesome. Bend the knees.
You're doing great.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
Alright, from your Downward Dog
we're gonna draw 
the low belly in.
We're going to hug the navel to
the spine and we're slowly gonna
roll through the spine 
all the way back to Plank.
I know.
Then take it back up and send
it all the way to Downward Dog.
Now find a little flow here.
Catch a wave with your breath.
Getting really 
articulate through the spine.
Clawing through the fingertips.
Building strength in the arms.
And the whole torso.
Strong back.
Strong core.
So you can work 
nice and slow here
or you can start 
to pick up the pace.
You got it.
When you roll forward 
remember those shoulders
are right over the wrists.
Meet your appropriate edge here.
You're doing great.
Awesome. 
Then we'll do one more.
The next time you're in Downward
Facing Dog take a deep breath in
here and exhale, bend the knees.
Look forward, 
make your way to the top.
Awesome.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale to soften and fold.
You're gonna walk your hands
underneath your feet here,
your toes just to give a little
relief for their wrists here.
And you can bring your hands all
the way underneath your foot.
Bring your toes to your 
wrists and wiggle your toes.
Just take a restful breath here.
Mhmmm. Very nice.
And then slowly release.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale, fold.
Root to rise here.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Big stretch, big breath.
Exhale, hands to heart.
Inhale lots of love in.
Relax your shoulders 
as you breathe out.
Maybe you let it go 
through the mouth.
Let it go out 
through the mouth, yeah.
Okay, soft knees.
Here we go, steeple grip.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale, hands to heart 
step the right foot back.
Inhale, reach for the sky here.
Check it out, exhale.
You're gonna slowly send 
your steeple grip forward.
Keep your back foot 
on the ground for now.
Hugging the low ribs.
Arms are engaged.
I'm really lifting my 
triceps up towards my ears.
Now you can stay here.
Inhale in or exhale, we begin
to lift off the back leg. What?
Hold onto your focus, 
your Drishti.
Dial your left pinky 
toes down to the ground.
Soft bend in the standing leg.
I'm actively reaching up 
through my right hip crease.
Inhale in, exhale, slow and
steady with control bring the
left toes back to the ground.
Inhale, lift your 
heart up towards the sky.
Exhale, hands in 
line with the heart.
Bend your back knee and we'll
hop it back up to the front.
Good, inhale reach for the sky.

your center as you bring your
hands in line with the heart
and we step the right toes back.
Big inhale to lift 
the index fingers up high.
Big stretch.
Full body experience.
Exhale. You're gonna slowly
take it forward, tilt forward.
Back toes stay on 
the earth here to start.
Lean into it.
You got it. Breathe deep.

If this is too much for your
shoulders you can release the
steeple grip now and 
take the fingertips forward.

hug the lower ribs in.
Inhale in.

Downward Facing 
Dog or Child's Pose.
You did a great job.
Take a deep breath in.
Way to hang with it.
Give you your 
thinking mind a break.
Let your body kind of
get the love and 
meet the challenge.
Basically no toxic thoughts.
Be sweet.
Be curious. Be kind.
Alright, if you're in Child's
Pose go ahead and meet us in
Downward Facing Dog.
Okay, last bit.
You got this.
Claw through the fingertips.
We're going to 
tick-tock the hips to the right.
You're gonna come onto the
outer edge of your right foot.
Inner arch of your left foot.
From here we're gonna press away
from the yoga mat with the right
hand and lift the left 
fingertips up towards the sky.
Side plank.
If you have it in ya, you can
take the left arch of the left
foot stack it over the right
foot or maybe lift it up high.
You can also take a full
Vasisthasana by lifting the hips
creating a little rainbow in
the spine and bringing the left
fingertips all the way forward.
Breathe deep here.
Meet your appropriate edge.
This is it.
Inhale in.
Lift the hips 
up a little higher.
And then exhale, back to Plank.
If you need to take a 
little break in-between,
it's all good.
Actually why not?
Let's all take a little break.
Come onto the knees.
Bring the hands together 
and then dial your fingers,
that's what those are called,
down just for a sec here.
Get a little 
stretch for the wrists.
Okay, last bit.
We got this.
Here we go.
Back to Plank.
Downward Facing Dog.
Find your foundation first.
Reconnect with your breath.
We're almost done here.
You're doing awesome.
Alright, cue Kesha, 
tick-tock to the left.
You're gonna bring the outer
edge of the left foot to the
earth, inner arch of 
the right foot to the earth.
Then as you start 
to straighten out,
remember we're working with
good alignment here so shoulder,
elbow and left wrist all in a
nice straight line as I slowly
send my right 
fingertips up towards the sky.
Lift the hips up you can stay
here or we can stack the feet.
Or we can lift the top leg.
Maybe option in time to take the
right fingertips all the way up
and overhead, lifting the hips.
Breathing, breathing, breathing.
Awesome, with control 
slowly come out of the pose.
Come to Plank.
We're gonna go all 
the way down to the belly.
We're gonna inhale,

breath as you press up.
Final Plank.
Nice work.

Last Downward Dog.
Nice work.
Keep breathing here.
When you're ready,
bend your knees,
carve a line with your 
nose to look forward
and then make 
your way to the top.
Feet together, really together.
Then we're going to 
slowly bend the knees.
Come right back into that
ball that we've been in here.
You can modify as needed here,
of course, always.
And then for those who want,
it's optional,
of course, always optional.
This is your body, your life,
your practice so ultimately
you're the one in charge for
your own responsible and in
charge of your own happiness.
Maybe we try one last time
our toe stand.
Engaging the 
full abdominal wall.
Using all of the tools we know
about our energetic practice
lifting and grounding.
Balancing that 
Sun and Moon energy.
Awesome and then 
we'll slowly release.
We're going to 
bring the bum back down.
We're going to repeat basically,
come back to that
seated position.
Hands come behind the thighs.
Loop the shoulders.
Lean back, way back.
Lift the shins.
Inhale in.
Exhale, maybe you 
send the fingertips out.
Maybe you 
straighten the right leg.
Maybe straighten the left leg.
Maybe straighten both legs, lift
the arms up towards the sky.
Let's see what happens.
Inhale in.
Exhale and then slowly release.
Come on down to your back.
Straighten the legs.
If you want you can do a nice
slow roll with 
that steeple grip.
Alright, awesome work.
Let's cool it down.
So when you get here
in your own time you can 
get centered on the mat,
hug your knees up 
to your chest.
We're just gonna rinse it out
by taking the legs to one side,
any side and then (stutters)
looking in the
opposite direction.
So a little reclined twist.
Breathing deep.
And then when you're ready,
rock through center.
Get that nice yummy 
massage on the low back.
And we'll take it 
to the other side.
Taking your gaze in the
opposite direction of your legs.
And then we'll 
come back to center.
And you can either rock and roll
up and down the length of your
spine to sit in a little
meditation or hang out or you
can extend the leg that 
long for a little Shavasana.
Do take a second to 
just be with your breath.
Let the nutrients of your 
practice kind of settle in.
And remember how valuable it
is to check your attitude when
you're working
with your body. Right?
Let's work with our bodies,
not on them.
Let's honor them and love them.
And accept them and 
all their beautiful glory.
