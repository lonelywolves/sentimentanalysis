- Hi everyone and
welcome to Dedicate,
your 30 day yoga journey.
I'm Adriene and this
is Benji and welcome back.
It's Day 2 and today
we're focusing on Foundation.
So hop into something
comfy and let's get started.
(bright music)
Alrighty my friends,
welcome back.
Let's begin in a
nice comfortable seat.
Take your time
getting down to the ground.
When you land
sit up nice and tall.
Remembering that you can always
lift the hips if you need a
little boost to help you
find length in the spine.
And right away we're
going to align head over heart,
heart over pelvis today and
allow the hands to just rest
gently on the
thighs or the knees,
whatever feels good.
And then I'd like for you to
just notice where your heels are
if they're really crunching
close in to your body or if you
perhaps would benefit
from a little more space.
So to each his own, just wanting
you to pay attention because
today Day 2 we are remembering
that or learning that
after the breath,
foundation first.
So always, always, always,
as we introduced in yesterday's
session breath comes first so
you can always be playing with
that expansion of the inhale.
Really imagining it moving out
through all four sides of the
torso so we tend
to kind of breathe here
a lot without just
consciousness.
Totally normal. 
And in our
yoga practice we have a great
opportunity to drop the breath
down and you can even hear my
voice change when I bring
the breath down here,
that awareness into my diaphragm
and feel that expansion and then
yes, of course, the relaxing
of the shoulders down
as you breathe out.
So after that little dance which
you can do at any point during
this journey if you need
to take a break you can just
return back to your breath.
After that we always want
to come to the foundation.
And if you've been practicing
yoga for 20 years I think this
session is still going to
be amazing for you because
I always find myself kind of
exploring off on a trail which
is great and then having this
moment where I remember
(sighs) how's my foundation?
How is the soil?
How is that which
I'm building upon?
Is it steady?
Is it cracked?
Am I ignoring it entirely?
Is it like a fire and
does it need tending to?
That fire about to go out so
there are a lot of rich metaphor
there of course but ultimately
this is really important because
it's going to keep you safe
and it's going to set you up for
greatness in the asana practice.
So, right away just notice does
it feel better to have my heels
in here or would I benefit
from giving myself more space?
By now I hope
that you've settled in.
And if you're having
trouble kind of feeling out
head over heart,
heart over pelvis,
go ahead and close your eyes
and let's all actually just
place a little awareness
at the base of the spine.
The pelvic floor.
And if you're
a creative intelligence type,
if you are a visual person you
might even place a little
soft light right
there at the bottom
of your spine,
the base of the pelvis.
And then try to keep an open
mind as we slowly travel all the
way up from the
base of the pelvis,
just with your mind's eye,
to your center.
And you're going to identify
with your center
different every day
and everybody you have to
also remember this journey is
designed for so many types of
people, so many different moods
energy levels so try to keep
that in mind as you find your
center and know that it's going
to be different for everyone and
it's gonna be
different every day.
Sometimes your center
is going to be up here.
Sometimes it's
going to be right here.
Sometimes it's
gonna be right here.
So place a little soft
light or just awareness
now in your center.
Maybe it's just
above the navel today.
Maybe it's right
there in the belly
and then continue all
the way up to your heart.
And see if you can align
those three things you might be
leaning forward a bit.
You might be maybe hanging back.
I always like to
call this the Mr. Burns.
This kind of you know, so
energetically we're drawing up
from the base of the spine
through the center and then the
heart center and now all the way
up to the crown of your head,
So foundation isn't always
physical though we're gonna be
focusing a lot on
the physical today.
It's also how you regard
your energetic state.
And a lot of times I find you
don't really have
to do anything.
You just have to kind of bring
awareness to your energy and it
will start to support you
rather than work against you.
And then it's so great because
in yoga when we use asana
practice and then the energetic
hygiene of regular daily
practice together we start to
really move in a way off the mat
where we feel like
okay, yeah, things are
moving with more ease.
You feel like you're working
for yourself instead of against.
When you're ready bring the
hands together at the heart
so we have this awareness.
Just to reiterate, pulling up
little energy from the base of
the pelvis all the way up
through the center it continues
all the way up through the
midline to the heart and all the
way up to your crown.
And so this is your inspiration
to sit up nice and tall.
Not really muscling or forcing
yourself right because that's
not sustainable and
it's not going to feel good.
Okay and any of
this that resonates,
great, and any of it
that doesn't no worries.
Remember we are practicing with
people all over the world
and take what you need
and leave what you don't.
Take a deep breath in and on
your exhale bow your head to
your heart mind intelligence
to the body intelligence.
Take a moment and
just connect the two.
Uniting.
Mind and body as we set
out on our journey today.
Great, then inhale in.
Exhale to release the
fingertips to the earth.
Flutter your eyelashes open.
Lift the corners of your
mouth and let's rock and roll.
We're gonna inhale, send the
fingertips out left to right.
Big stretch.
Draw the
shoulder blades together.
Lift your heart
space up, up, up.
Great, then on your next
exhale bring the palms together,
Anjuli Mudra at the heart.
A little prayer position.
Beautiful now chin to chest,
reach behind
palms kiss together.
And then on
your next inhale,
reach all the way
up towards the sky.
Big stretch, feel that
length in the side body.
Exhale, float the fingertips
down wiggle the fingertips.
Notice what it feels
like to be alive today.
So really present.
Here we go, inhale halfway.
With the breath,
exhale palms together.
Great, chin to chest.
Slowly reach behind.
Inhale, lift all the way up.
Now lift through
the front and backside.
Reach, reach, reach.
Exhale, empty out the breath as
you float the fingertips down.
We're gonna do this one more
time and we're gonna really try
to sync up the
breath with the movement.
Here we go, inhale halfway.
Exhale, hands to heart.
Chin to chest reach behind.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale float it
all the way down.
You got it.
Beautiful, left
hand to the earth.
Inhale reach up with the
right hand and then over.
Big side body stretch.
Then from your navel,
from your center, draw in.
You're gonna take your
right fingertips to the ground.
Keep the hips heavy here
and you're gonna slowly
sweep the fingertips
all the way around.
Should feel good
in the back body.
And then come all the
way up through center.
Take your left
fingertips up and then over.
Breathe, feel the stretch.
Nice and then
left fingertips come all
the way down to the earth.
We sweep all the way through.
And come all the way back up.
Right fingertips
reach up to the sky.
And then take it over.
Side body stretch and then
right fingertips to the ground.
Sweep it all the way through.
Around, around,
around and over to the right.
And then take your
left arm all the way up,
right arm all the way up.
Imagine you're holding a big
beach ball up and overhead.
You're gonna
pull the thumbs back,
keep the pinkies forward
and then just check in
with the shoulders here.
Use the tools that we've
already learned together.
Inhale, fill all four
sides of the torso up.
Find expansion and then exhale.
You know what to do,
exhale drop the shoulders down.
Once more like that, inhale.
Exhale, drop the
shoulders down, create space.
Beautiful, inhale
palms kiss up and overhead.
And exhale hands
to heart, Namaste.
Okay, diving
forward onto all fours.
Come to that Tabletop Position.
So finding your
foundation right away here
spread the
fingertips super wide.
Wrists underneath the shoulders,
knees directly
underneath the hip points.
Inhale, drop the belly
open the chest Cow Pose.
Exhale, round through,
chin to chest.
Close your eyes, visualize.
Really stretching through
the skin of the back body.
Now on your own
moving with your breath,
see if you can synchronize the
movement to the breath
and the breath to the movement.
And as you're ready you're
going to begin to veer off the
railroad tracks just a
bit while still keeping this
awareness of your foundation.
So you might bump the
hips a little left to right.
You might check
in with the neck.
You might notice you're
collapsing in the shoulders.
Find that pressing away
that yielding from the earth.
Great, then come
back to Tabletop Position.
Hold on to your foundation
here and nice and easy,
you're going to find that hollow
body by hugging the low ribs in,
drawing the navel up and in.
We call this Uddiyana Bandha and
then once again checking in with
the length of your neck.
Giving awareness in your neck.
Alright, here we go, hold onto
this awareness of the midline.
This is so important
when remembering foundation,
building foundation, returning
to the power of your foundation.
It's not just about that which
is touching the earth but again
your awareness of
your energetic body.
So bring your awareness
to this center channel,
we call this this is
the Shashona or the midline.
And you're going
to try to hold on to that
as you kick the right leg out.
So if you're not holding onto it
you're just gonna shift all the
way over into your left side.
But if you work to maintain
that awareness of the midline,
the Shashona, as soon as you
dial your right toes down.
You're gonna
feel your abs turn on.
You're going to feel your
energetic center
just start to brighten 
and you're gonna start
to breathe a little deeper.
A more supportive
and conscious breath.
Okay, check it out,
you're gonna inhale in here.
Exhale, slowly
bring the knee in.
Nose toward the knee
rounding through just like Cat.
Then inhale, send
the right leg out
and look towards
the front of your mat.
Careful not to
crunch back of the neck.
So like a one legged Cat-Cow.
Here we go, exhale bring it in.
Claw through the fingertips.
Inhale, send it out.
One more time, exhale bring it
in and really draw the navel
up and in, up and in, up and in.
And then release.
Great, switch it to
the other side right away.
Find that connection.
Lift the front body
up to meet the back body.
Maybe lifting the
lower ribs up and in.
Finding that hollow body.
Claw through the fingertips.
Shoulders are
still working here.
Externally rotating so your
elbow creases are
towards the front of your mat.
So we're working to build
stability in the shoulders here
and then when you feel like
you have that connection to your
midline, to your center,
send that left leg out long.
Dial the left toes down.
And just pay attention.
These practices build on one
another so taking your theme of
yesterday and building on it
today with your foundation.
Take one more
breath here to really lift
from your left inner thigh.
If you start shaking
here that's to be expected.
We're working with
so much integrity here.
So beautiful,
here we go, inhale.
Exhale, bring the knee in,
nose toward the knee.
Inhale just look to
the front edge of your mat.
Don't crunch the neck.
Kick it out.
And exhale, reel it in.
Cat.
Inhale, send it out.
With your breath, exhale,
reel it in.
Last one, inhale nice and slow.
Don't rush.
And exhale, reel it in.
Awesome, from here you can
release the left knee to the
earth bring the toes together
knees as wide as the mat.
You're going to
send her hips back.
Walk the fingertips
forward as much as you can.
Breathe, breathe, breathe and
melt your heart to the earth and
slowly take the
palms together up and
over behind the
back of your head.
This is incredible
ancient yoga posture
called Namaste Shark Fin.
It's a very old
traditional Mudra.
No, just kidding but you can
imagine the shark fin up right
behind you, palms
pressing together.
Fingertips pressing together
and then from here
we walk the elbows just a bit.
Feeling that nice stretch
through the shoulder girdle.
Triceps.
Keep breathing.
And if you need to here, you
can bring the fingertips in to
knuckles and rotate the wrists
one way and then the other.
And take one more
loving breath here.
And then slowly release
the palms back to the earth.
Carve a line with your nose to
look forward and bring it on up.
Lead with your heart.
Remember how you move matters
the transitions here matter as
you walk the knees in.
Curl the toes under.
Take a deep breath in and on
an exhale Downward Facing Dog.
Take your time.
So here we want to make sure
that the hands are not too
narrowed but
that you really take up
a lot of space on your mat.
This is gonna help us bring
that external rotation
in the shoulder.
And then you can play with how
wide or how short your dog is
and I encourage you to
change it up from time to time.
Then make sure you're breathing.
Claw through the fingertips.
And then slow and steady,
bend the knees.
Belly comes towards
the tops of the thighs.
Carve a line with your nose to
look forward and we're gonna
step one foot up then the other.
You can do as
many steps as you like.
Maybe you do a ragdoll one step
and then the other or maybe it's
baby steps to
the top of your mat.
Take that
Forward Fold at the top.
Now immediately today,
ground through all
four corners of the feet.
Tuck your chin and slowly from
the ground begin to rise up.
And slowly once again
stacking head over heart,
heart over pelvis.
Take a second here.
Feet fully grounded.
Energy drawing up from the earth
to just find what feels good.
So it could be looping the
shoulders a couple of times.
It could be noticing that maybe
your clenching or
holding in the jaw.
Maybe you're just furrowed in
the brow and it's time to soften
and remember ah, yes this is
time that I've dedicated for me.
And then we'll bend the knees.
And when you're ready spread the
fingertips wide you're going to
lead with the thumbs ground
through the feet as you reach
the fingertips all the way up,
big Beach ball up and overhead.
Then hold that big
beach ball up and overhead,
again thumbs back,
pinkies forward.
And then hold onto your center
of gravity as you slowly take
that beach ball all the way over
towards the left side body as
far as you can go with
maintaining integrity
in the neck.
Then in front you're going to
feel this firmly
in the low body.
Use that connection to your
center as well to bring you all
the way back up
and then slowly
over to the right.
So you will know here even
though this seems like such a
simple gesture you will know if
you're muscling or like kind of
hanging on by a thread.
So ground through all
four corners of the feet.
Lengthen down through the
tailbone turn on through your
abdominals and then
slowly bring it back to center.
Awesome, inhale,
reach for the sky.
Wiggle the fingertips just
to create a little energy
and exhale rain
it down all the way.
Inhale, halfway lift your
version so you can bring palms
to the thighs now, palms to the
shins or fingertips to the earth
just use an
inhale to find length.
You can mix and
match these as well.
I encourage it.
And exhale to fold.
Okay rewind
ground through the feet.
Reach back up towards
the sky as you breathe in.
Big breath, big stretch.
Capture something
up and overhead,
strong legs as you bring
the hands back to the heart.
Awesome work, here we go.
Soft knees.
Fingertips are going to go
down to come up so inhale
big beach ball up and overhead.
Exhale, take it over
to the left, strong legs.
Inhale, rise up.
Exhale, over to the right.
Inhale, rise up.
Wiggle the fingertips, exhale,
rain it all the way down.
Inhale to find length.
Exhale to soften
and Forward Fold.
Beautiful, plant
the palms from here,
step the right foot back.
Just the right foot.
Then loop the shoulders and
slowly begin to open up the
chest towards the
front of your mat.
Bring your front knee
over your front ankle.
So all four corners of
the foot are rooted here.
And then you're gonna take
your left thumb to your left hip
crease and just pull it back.
Just a bit.
Whoa, now squeeze the inner
thighs towards the midline.
Reconnect as you inhale,
radiate your heart forward.
Big stretch, you can
always lower the back knee here.
Listen to your body.
And then on an exhale, plant the
palms we're gonna step in back
to Plank or Half Plank.
You're doing great.
Find that hollow body here.
Again, you can lower the knees.
Find that length
through the neck
all the way
up through the crown.
And if your knees are lifted go
ahead and widen your toes about
hip width apart.
So you have a
nice strong base here.
So you're always
wanting to create a strong base.
Thinking about stacking the
bones so that your muscle can
hug to the bone
and not be strained.
Cool. Soft bend in the knees.
Now you're just going
to step the right foot up.
Front knee over front ankle.
Slowly grow the pose.
Loop the shoulders back, begin
to open up through the chest.
Let your heart energy radiate
forward again going beyond just
the physical thinking about
your powerful energetic body.
And if you need to lower
that back knee, please do.
Maybe everyone
might check it out.
Now as we begin to
layer on your breath's going
to want to disappear.
That nice beautiful,
conscious breath
so keep remembering
to bring it back.
Bring it on home.
Inhale, lift the chin,
send your heart forward.
Exhale, plant the palms.
We're already connecting to the
abdominals here to your center
as you send the right foot back.
Okay, so the attitude you
bring to this is everything.
You can lower the knees,
you're going to find
that hollow body here.
Your shoulder blades are going
to move left to right instead of
collapsing into the center.
You're reaching the heels back.
You have a nice
strong wide base.
You're here for
three, two, one,
Downward Dog.
Awesome work.
Send the hips up high,
melt your heart back.
Start to go
through your checklist.
Upper arm bones rotate out.
Inner thighs rotate in.
And if Downward Dog is too much,
you can always insert the
Puppy Posture that we
learned yesterday instead.
It's a beautiful modification,
you get the same benefits.
It's just a little less
weight bearing
and a little less heating.
Shake their head loose in your
Downward Dog and when you're
ready, you're going to anchor
through the left heel and slowly
inhale, lift the
right leg up high.
Keep the right toes dialed down
just like we did on all fours in
that One-Legged Cat-Cow.
And then here we go,
you're gonna shift forward,
roll through your left foot as
you squeeze your right knee all
the way up and in and
then gently place it up.
And if it doesn't come up all
the way you'll just do whatever
you need to with love to
mindfully move that
foot all the way up.
Great, then back
knee lowered or lifted,
yogi's choice, inhale.
Open the chest.
Let your heart radiate forward.
And then exhale.
You're going to soften
through that back knee,
pivot on that back foot
and slowly roll up
keeping that
front knee bent.
Roll up just like
we do in Mountain.
Rolling all the way up.
Beautiful.
Okay, here we go.
Thumbs back pinkies forward.
I'm gonna inhale,
take that big beach ball
all the way
forward, up and back.
Front knee is bent.
Back leg is straight.
I'm engaging, I'm lifting up
from the arches of my feet.
Breathing deep,
finding that expansive breath.
Beautiful, beautiful.
Strong legs.
Front knee over front ankle.
Warrior I.
Inhale, carve a
line with the nose, look up.
Exhale, open it
out to Warrior II.
You might widen your stance.
The main thing here is remember
to turn those back toes in
because this
translates to the shin bone,
the knee, the thigh
bone all the way up,
femur to the hip so if this is
turned out it's gonna be really
hard to get your
hip to square forward.
So you want to turn
it in from foundation
and then work your
way up from there.
Make sure you're not on
a tight rope so you can widen
the feet a little bit here.
Take one, oh we're here, sorry.
One more breath, Warrior II.
Pull the pinkies back.
Got tied up in my
foundation and then here we go,
we're gonna flip the script.
You're going to take
your right fingertips forward,
draw a line all
the way up and back,
Reverse Warrior
or Peaceful Warrior.
Take a deep breath in.
Then from center,
from your core cartwheel it
all the way back to
your nice low lunge.
Take your time.
Awesome, beautiful work.
Inhale in here.
Exhale to reset.
Find your foundation.
Squeeze inner
thighs in the midline.
Then left hand
presses into the earth
and nice and easy big
open twist to your right.
You're gonna reach your
right fingertips up high.
Back knee can
lower here, totally.
Inhale in.
Exhale bring it
all the way down.
Beautiful, plant the palms,
step the right toes back.
Plank Pose or Half Plank.
Breathe here.
Lower belly and
upper abdominals coming in
to kiss towards the middle.
You're here for three.
You're doing awesome.
Find your breath, two.
And Downward
Facing Dog on the one,
here we come.
Bend your knees.
Start to lean in.
Feel that warmth.
Send awareness to your hands.
How we come back
to that narrow stance
or can we get a
nice wide base going?
Can we claw
through the fingertips?
Fingers spread wide.
Then when you're ready anchor
through the right heel and
inhale lift the
left leg up high.
Dial the left toes down.
Breathe.
Here we go. Inhale in,
exhale, squeeze as you
roll through your right foot.
Left knee up
towards your chest,
squeeze, squeeze, squeeze
and then step it all up.
Come into a
nice slow lunge here.
Just breathe.
Checking out what's
going on with the hips.
You can always
lower that back knee.
Nice, and then
here we go inhale in.
Exhale, you're gonna
soften the back knee,
pivot on the back
foot and nice and slow.
Keep that front
knee bent as you roll up
stacking through the spine.
Good, find that strong
connection to your back leg by
turning the right toes in and
pressing into the
knife edge of that foot.
And here we go,
big beach ball up in overhead.
Lots of space.
Strong legs.
Breathing deep.
Carve a line with
your nose forward,
up and back, integrating
the neck as you look up.
Inhale, exhale Warrior II.
So left fingertips forward,
right fingertips back.
Pull the pinkies back and
lift up through the chest.
And just take stock here.
Breathing deep.
Head over heart,
heart over pelvis.
Back toes turned in.
You're doing great.
Let's flip the script by sending
the left fingertips forward
then reaching up and back,
Peaceful Warrior.
Lots of integrity
in the neck here.
Breathe, breathe,
breathe, inhale.
Then from center draw your navel
in cartwheel all the way down.
Have some fun.
Back to your nice slow lunge.
Back knee lowered
or lifted, inhale,
open up through the chest.
And exhale, plant your
right palm to the earth.
Big inhale, nice open twist
all the way towards your left.
Opening up, breathing,
breathing into your belly.
And then using your exhale
to take it all the way down.
Awesome work.
Way to move with intention.
Plant the palms.
Step the left toes back.
Here we go, Plank Pose.
Nice wide base
or knees together.
Neck nice and long.
Slow building of core
throughout this journey.
You won't regret it.
Stick with it,
find your breath for three,
two, and on the one
we're going to gaze forward,
shift forward on the toes.
Squeeze the elbows
into the side body.
Find that nice hollow front body
as you lower all the way down
your belly and belly flops
are totally welcome, right?
Press into the tops of the feet.
Drag your hands in
line with the rib cage.
Suck the elbows into your side
body and then here we go find a
softness and an ease
as you slowly inhale,
Baby Cobra, just a baby.
Nice, low Baby Cobra.
Find your breath here.
Listen.
And then release
forehead kisses the mat.
Twice more, inhale, lift it up.
Just a nice easy Baby Cobra.
Waking up muscles of the back
body that maybe haven't been
woken up in a while
and releasing down.
Then one more time,
with your breath.
And then forehead
comes back to the mat.
We'll curl the toes under,
lift the kneecaps,
tone the quads,
and yogi's choice,
you can come to all
fours or through Plank.
Here we go with the breath.
We'll inhale in.
On an exhale
make your transition.
All fours or Plank and then
straight to Downward Facing Dog.
Shake the head lose.
Check in with
your foundation here.
Awesome work.
Here we go, bend
the knees generously,
belly comes towards
the tops of the thighs.
Carve a line with
your nose and look forward.
Inhale in and then exhale,
make your way to the top.
You can baby step,
you can ragdoll
or you can hop or float.
Forward Fold at
the top of the mat.
Here we go.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale, soften and bow.
Bend your knees.
Plant your palms.
Step your right foot back,
step your left foot back.
Here we go, inhale in.
Exhale lower the
knees to the earth.
You're going to swing
your legs to one side.
Move mindfully any side and
come all the way through
to a seat, legs out in front.
So for Foundation day,
Dundasana.
Dunda, Sanskrit
for stick or staff.
So you can imagine the stick
(clicks tongue) as the spine.
And if you're rounding here
you might grab a blanket or
something help lift the hips up.
Or if you don't have that
available and you want to just
find that length,
bend your knees.
Bend your knees
and lift the heart.
So and traditionally too it's
kind of fun you can take the
fleshy part of your buttocks
aside just kind of feel those
sits bones really
root to the ground
like two little push pins.
And then you have to do
the work you have to
find that lift.
Lifting, lifting, lifting
energetically from
the pelvic floor.
All the way up
through your center line,
all the way up through the crown
and then fingertips can either
come to the earth
or palms to the earth.
This is truly depending on
just the length of your arms,
just anatomy.
So honor your body.
Find a place for your
hands so that you can
lift, lift, lift and
then flex the feet,
toes towards the face,
engaging the legs.
Breathing deep here.
Your heels might even hover
off the earth just a bit here.
You're breathing into your belly
and you're trying to draw your
elbows together shoulder blades
together as you lengthen through
the crown for three,
two, find your breath.
And one.
Beautiful, release.
You're going to
bend the right knee.
Lift that right
leg all the way up.
Give it a nice little snuggle,
a little hug.
You can kiss it if you want.
Or not.
And then here we go,
we're going to inhale,
reach the right arm up first.
Exhale bend the right elbow,
just bring it down.
So shoulder
blades kind of coming up,
around and into socket.
And then I keep the lift
as I turn to my right side.
Great, now hold onto your base.
Hold onto your foundation.
So this left leg is important.
Everything's important.
You're going to work from
the ground up as you hug
your right knee in
with the left elbow.
And then from the base of
the spine begin to turn slowly
traveling all the way
up through the low back.
The lumbar, through the midline.
The thoracic and then all
the way slowly up drawing the
shoulders down as
you lift your heart,
your chest and then in time
you can work with the neck,
the cervical spine.
Breathing deep holding onto that
nice strong foundation
in the left leg.
Breathe into your belly.
Massage your internal organs,
you're doing awesome.
And then slowly release.
Thank you right leg.
Go ahead and extend it out and
we'll bring the left knee in.
Give it a little hug.
You know, obviously I'm being
silly when I say kiss the knee
but when I'm
trying to get you to do,
get us to do, me too,
is connect to the body.
Not just kind of
take the orders, right?
Check off the guidelines.
And when we do these sort of
things we kind of connect our
brain and our heart as well.
So here we go.
(chuckles) Inhale send
the left fingertips up.
Find that length here.
Think head over heart, heart
over pelvis as you slowly bend
the left elbow, squeeze
that left scap all the way in.
Pay attention.
Just notice what's
happening and then
best you can you're
going to find your position of
your left fingertips
without collapsing.
Although this
looks pretty cool. Okay?
So finding that lift and
lengthen through the heart.
Squeezing into the midline here.
Maintaining foundation
in the right leg.
And then we're
going to hook them here.
Hook the right
elbow on the left knee.
And begin at the base of
the spine slowly turning.
Breathing all the while.
Mindfully finding a
lift as you breathe in.
And then continuing to travel
up the spine as you breathe out.
Soften your jaw.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
You're gonna feel awesome
after this practice. Breathing.
Hold on to your base.
Remember foundation first.
And then notice how
my right hand is soft.
I'm not gripping or
pressing or pushing.
Soft and easy so we're really,
really cultivating the energetic
foundation too that's going to
help us sustain a regular home
practice in a way
that feels awesome.
Alright, take one more breath.
And then slowly melt it back.
Thank your left leg.
Send it out.
Then we're gonna bend the knees.
Bring the feet to the ground.
Hands are gonna come to the
backs of the thighs today.
And when you're
ready we're going
to roll it all the way down.
Nice and slow.
Send your legs out
long if you have the space.
Inhale, reach the
arms all the way up
and overhead big beach ball.
Take a big breath in
and a long breath out
as you relax the feet.
And inhale in.
Exhale, hug both knees
into the chest, nice and slow.
Just one final little hug here.
You can lift
your head up or not.
Just an option.
Breathing all the while,
slow loving breaths.
Close your eyes feel
your yoga mat rising up
to meet your back body here.
If the head's lifted
go ahead and lower it now.
Beautiful.
And then we'll
release the feet to the earth.
Extend one leg, then the other.
And today allowing
everything to relax.
Fingers, toes, breath.
Even faster than you
could have ever imagined.
So this unraveling takes time
but what if you were to just
give yourself
permission here to let go?
To surrender?
And for 30 seconds
practice exquisite stillness.
Take a deep breath in.
And exhale.
Notice where you might
be gripping or holding here.
And see if you can soften.
I love the image of
a parent or
a caregiver holding a baby
and that surrender,
that trust that the baby
participates in to just let go
and be held.
This is an important
part of the foundation
 of yoga to me.
So thank you so
much for participating.
As you're ready, we'll slowly
bring the hands together
and the thumbs
up towards a third eye.
Day two in the books.
You're incredible.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
And we close the
practice by saying
Namaste.
(bright music)
