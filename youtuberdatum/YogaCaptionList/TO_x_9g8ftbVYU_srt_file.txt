- Hi everyone, 
welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and 
this is Benji and we have
an awesome yoga 
for risk takers today.
So hop into something 
comfy and let's get started.
(bright music)
Alright my friends, hi.
Let's begin standing today.
Bring your feet together,
really together.
And go ahead 
and take your gaze
and look right 
down at your feet.
And we're going to start
with just a little grounding,
a little four 
part equal standing.
So you're going to 
bring your feet together.
Hopefully you're there by now.
And then we're gonna lift
all the toes and we're gonna
actively ground down through
the ball joint the big toe.
And then ground down through the
ball joint of the pinky toe and
then release the toes down.
It might feel a little weird if
you're new to this and just feel
this connection through 
all four corners of the feet.
Now for today's practice don't
really worry about getting this
super right or wrong, 
like just bring your awareness
to your feet and you're good.
And then we're just gonna keep
drawing awareness up from the
feet pressing down as if we were
doing like a footprint in the
mud and we're gonna 
just slowly draw energy up
through the arches, 
through the legs,
up through the front 
of your hip creases
and then as you bring
your fingertips to rest gently
at your side, bring a lot
of awareness into the hands.
So they can be however you want.
Just lots of 
awareness in the hands.
And then continue the 
journey up through the spine.
Remember the neck is 
an extension of the spine.
And then finally 
nice and tall up
through the crown of the head.
So we're already in, 
already in our first yoga pose.
Standing tall alert 
with awareness in Mountain.
Excellent.
So from Mountain I'll invite you
to gently deepen your breath and
take whatever 
breaths you need today.
So it's gonna be different for
everyone so rather than guiding
pranayama here in the beginning,
I'd like you to just check in.
Notice how your breathing
normally and then breathe in a
way that feels good.
Maybe it's smooth and steady.
Maybe you need some 
great big cleansing breaths.
So depending on where you are
today both in mind and body.
Start to breathe 
with more consciousness.
Awesome.
And then soften your 
gaze down past your nose.
As you continue to breathe,
squeeze the legs together.
Draw energy up from the pelvic
floor engaging this root chakra.
This kind of base the pelvis and
the energetic body and the kind
of nerves that 
the area that
really guides us
to a place of security.
This root chakra is
a place of like "I am, home."
And we're going to kind of
stimulate and work with this
area today particularly in our
standing poses to bring courage
and balance to both mind 
and body so that we can have
everything we 
need to take risks.
Trust. Go for the gold.
It's hard to go for the gold
if you're feeling out of whack.
If you're feeling a
little bit ungrounded, lost.
So we'll see what happens.
Synchronizing 
breath with movement,
movement with breath
you're going to slowly send the 
fingertips out left to right.
Take a deep breath in 
and a long breath out.
And then continue the journey
all the way up as you take a
deep breath in.
And then when you 
land there, exhale out.
Good, inhale in.
Exhale, arms go back out.
Halfway, Texas T.
Inhale in again here.
And exhale hands 
slide gently to your sides.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale, empty it all out here.
Squeeze the legs together,
ground through the feet.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
Fingertips maybe kiss up and
overhead and then exhale relax
the shoulders down here.
Good, inhale.
Stretch and lift 
up from the side body.
Exhale.
Good, inhale halfway.
Pause here, empty it out.
Inhale, float 
the fingertips down.
Exhale, Mountain Pose.
Ooh, feeling it in 
my fingers already.
Inhale, halfway lift.
Exhale, drop the shoulders.
Inhale to reach for the sky.
Root to rise here. 
Big breath, big stretch.
Exhale to relax 
the shoulders down.
Inhale in here, stay.
Exhale out.
Good, inhale, halfway.
Float the fingertips down,
Texas T.
Beautiful, exhale stay.
Maybe pull the pinkies back.
Good, inhale, drop it down.
Exhale, Mountain Pose.
Great, let that go.
Allow your breath to 
return to its natural rhythm.
Nice and easy.
And then I'll invite you
once again to just bring your
awareness to the 
base of the spine,
the root and see if 
you can lift up a little bit
from the pelvic floor.
We call this Mula Bandha.
Just kind of 
engaging those muscles.
It's like a hammock there and we
have a good video on that if you
want to learn a 
little more about that.
For now, just do your best.
Just bringing your 
awareness to it is perfect.
Okay, from here without losing
that connection to the pelvic
floor in your center you're
going to walk the feet a little
bit wider than hip width.
We're going to create a soft
bend in the knees and we're
gonna create a little 
movement that I like to
call knocking on heaven's door.
So you're going to start to
gently keep soft bend in the
knees, rock left to right.
And I'd like for you to sync up
with your breath in a way that
feels really good for you today.
So just listen to the sound
of your breath and then try to
bring a little bit of awareness
to this lift in the chest.
Shoulder blades kind of 
melting down the back body.
And you can start to slap your
own booty a little bit here,
why not?
Benji's going to stretch it out.
And if you're looking for a
little energetic boost today
with your risk taking, 
pick up the pace a little bit.
Keep the neck nice and long.
And let your gaze 
move with your nose
and let your heart 
move with your nose.
Sorry I got sidetracked because
I got in the zone so try to keep
basically your head 
and heart moving as
one here back and forth.
Notice where you might be
holding clenching in the toes.
Even tightness around the
shoulders, the elbows.
Or maybe you feel like kind
of a fool and you're like,
"What is this 
chick having me do here?"
So see if you can 
get a little free here.
And it's not easy, trust me.
But if you've been practicing
with me and with this community
for a while chances 
are you're here now.
(laughs)
Having fun but you know it's
tricky how we can get in our own
way and we 
don't even realize it.
We think that we have all these
obstacles and then come to find
out it was you.
You are keeping 
yourself from making that leap.
So of course it's not a one size
fits all but just a little food
for thought as we 
continue for three,
two and on the one 
start to slow it down.
Don't come to an abrupt stop.
See if you can slow 
it down nice and steady.
Easy does it.
Excellent, walk 
the feedback together.
Reset, Tadasana.
Inhale in.
And just notice how
you feel as you breathe out.
Woo!
Yes.
Okay, shifting the weight 
over towards the left foot.
We're going to 
interlace the fingertips.
You're gonna keep them open
though so you're going to shift
your weight to your left foot
and slowly lift your right knee
and you're gonna 
catch your right shin,
and squeeze and lift.
Rotate the right ankle one way
and then the other and keep your
chest proud and lifted.
Keep all the beautiful awareness
that we already built in the
feet right there in that left
foot so we're not rolling in
or rolling out, we're 
keeping awareness spread
through all four corners.
And then you can stay here or
if you need a little help with
balance today just 
find a piece of furniture,
a piece of architecture in which
you can lean on just a bit.
Lean on me,
when you're not strong and
I'll be your friend. Okay.
Tree Pose, Vriksasana.
So find something to lean on if
you like otherwise maybe stay in
the center of the room 
working on that Mula Bandha.
And we'll take the 
right foot to the ankle
or above the knee for our Tree.
And everyone, even if you're
at a piece of architecture,
squeeze and lift in 
towards the center line.
Find that connection from your
root and that's gonna be what
actually helps you hold 
your balance here in time.
And then Yogi's choice you
can take hands to the heart.
You can take the 
fingertips all the way up.
If you want to take a 
Mudra today you can do that.
Maybe open up through the chest
by releasing the fingertips
behind the back.
So giving lots of options, one,
because lots of different people
doing practice but mostly
because I want you to also make
decisions for yourself 
and get the brain
and the body connected today.
If your foot's above the knee
really try to press into the
outer edge of your right foot
to open up through that hip a
little more, go a little 
deeper into your posture.
Great. Take one more
cycle of breath here.
Really listen to the 
sound of your breath.
And then we're gonna come out
of it just the way we went in.
So you'll slowly bring that
right knee back squeeze and lift
with the hands all the way up.
Come out of your standing leg
and then exhale with control
lower that right foot down and
we'll switch to the other side
nice and easy.
Keep up with the nice 
beautiful breath here.
When you're ready, 
nice conscious footing.
We'll squeeze the left 
knee up in towards the heart.
Keep the chest lifted.
Proud, aware.
Rotate the ankle.
And you know right now we're
having to do this sort of thing,
this kind of, it's more than
just balancing in the posture,
it's about balancing your 
attention and where you're
focusing your attention.
So a good thing is you 
usually start at the base,
start at the foot 
and work your way up.
And obviously that's 
a great metaphor
for off the mat I think.
Okay, if it's 
in your body today,
let's go to Tree Pose or maybe
you work to create your own
version of Tree Pose today.
Maybe toes even staying 
on the ground as you
open up through the left hip.
Spread awareness 
through the right foot.
Again, feel free to 
use architecture here.
Let the heart lift in 
whatever shape you choose here,
Vriksasana.
And you're going to want 
to really pull everything
into the midline here.
So finding that 
root chakra connection.
Squeezing that right 
inner thigh in to meet the left.
Finding your 
balance and your focus.
And letting the 
breath really fuel
your search for that focus
and that balance.
Make it your own here.
If you need a challenge 
on the side maybe take
your gaze all the way up.
There's nothing like a balancing
posture to really reveal just
where you are today so be honest
about wherever you are and don't
get frustrated if 
you're falling continuously.
It's all good.
That's where you are.
Great to know it.
Great to know 
where you are today.
Take one more cycle of 
breath on your own here,
really listen to the wisdom
of the heart, your breath.
And then best you can with
control you're gonna squeeze
everything into the midline.
This is really coming from the
root chakra and we're going to
slowly come back to squeezing
the left knee up and in and then
with control like 
magic totally slowly,
beautifully lower it down.
Alright, come into Mountain.
Try not to fidget here.
You don't need all 
the extra movement.
I don't think you do 
anyway in my opinion.
So if you do need it, take it.
Come back to mountain,
find stillness.
Really, really still here.
Good. Take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
Awesome work.
Rock and roll.
Now we're going to 
step the feet super wide.
If you're feeling brave and I
already know you're beautiful
but if you're feeling brave
see if you can step the feet out
wide without looking down.
So we don't 
always need to do this.
Maybe you do, like maybe 
you have a dog or a child or
something around you, toys then
go ahead and look down but see
if you can step your feet
out wide without looking down.
And then we're gonna 
bring the feet parallel here.
I just looked down but it's okay,
it's just about this idea of
kind of playing 
with your brain too
on the mat not just
the gross body but this 
subtle body connection as well.
So get the feet parallel and
we're going to turn 
the left toes in.
And from that parallel 
point you're just going
to dial your right heel in.
So left toes are in,
right toes are out.
Then when you're ready inhale,
send the fingertips 
out Texas T again.
Pull the pinkies back to just
enhance this lift of your heart
and then breathe in, 
lengthen through the crown,
exhale bump the hips back
towards your left foot and we're
going to reach the 
right fingertips forward,
forward, forward, forward,
forward until we finally begin
to allow a tilt with awareness
coming into Triangle Pose,
Trikonasana.
Breathing deep here 
holding onto my core.
Lighting up that 
third chakra area here.
Lengthening through the crown.
Keep the neck, the muscles 
of the neck nice and soft,
throat chakra.
Take a deep breath in.
Then exhale, from the left wrist
imagine a little angel
pulling you up.
Being like, "I got your back.
Take those risks.
"Have fun. Life is good."
We'll come back.
We'll take the right heel
bring it out back to parallel.
Big power pose here.
Inhale, pull the pinkies back.
Exhale, here we go.
Turn the left heel in.
Turn the right toes in.
So the placement of the feet
are really important because it
helps decide how 
everything else is going to go.
So if you're working on a
project or if you're trying to
dream up something new just
start with the foundation.
What does the foundation need
to look like for me to build
whatever it is I'm 
thinking of or I'm dreaming of?
And same thing 
here in the asana.
If my feet are out of whack then
my hips are not going to be able
to do the functional thing
that they need to do
to help me maintain this pose.
Reaching forward, if you're
not already, take your time.
Trikonasana, Triangle.
We keep a nice long beautiful
line from crown to tail here.
We work in time to spiral
the heart up towards the sky.
Strong legs, strong breath.
Take one more beautiful inhale.
Find expansion.
It takes bravery to expand.
And then exhale, 
slow and steady back up.
Nice Texas T with the arms.
We'll turn both 
feet back to parallel.
Here we go,
pull the pinkies back.
Big chest opener here,
big heart opener.
And then exhale to release.
Bring the hands to the heart.
Great, you can hop the 
feet together here or you can
heel-toe,
heel-toe feet together.
Back to your Mountain.
Take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
Beautiful, inhale 
to reach for the sky.
Big stretch up and overhead.
Exhale to Forward Fold, 
bend your knees generously.
This should feel really good
after all of those
standing postures.
Let your head hang.
Let your heart soften.
Oh sweet puppy dog.
I think you should go ahead and
take a peek at 
the video right now.
Even though you're in your
Forward Fold just to get some
love from Benji, 
a little dog therapy.
We got your back.
We're all for you.
All for yoga.
Alright,
and again if you are
working with straight legs in
this Forward Fold today that's
fine but I'm going to invite you
just one last time to bend your
knees just to get a nice stretch
and a little restorative 
opening in the low back
after the poses we just did.
You can clasp the 
elbows if it feels good.
Find any soft easy movement
that really just hits the spot.
So we're putting you in 
the driver's seat basically.
Mhmmm, mhmmm, mhmmm.
Careful you're not 
gripping through your toes here.
Take one more cycle of 
breath here in and out.
And then we'll slowly release
the hands to the earth and
you're gonna, really slow,
you're gonna turn the toes out,
bend the knees, bring the heels
in and ready to come
into a little froggy pose.
Yeah there?
Alright, sorry buddy.
So from here you can stay
here just opening up
through the hips.
Just getting some of 
the juices flowing there.
Nice and easy.
Another option would be to maybe
bring the hands together into a
little balancing 
posture here, woo,
or we're gonna 
go into a Bakasana.
So before we do Bakasana,
I want to encourage 
you to really hug
the low ribs in, lift 
up from the pelvic floor.
Find that, that connection.
And with the 
knees nice and wide,
we're gonna, before we go 
to Bakasana we're going to
interlaced the fingertips and
we're gonna press the palms out.
Breathing deep, feeling that
stretch through the forearms.
So in this shape the 
upper arm bones are rotating in.
There's an internal rotation.
For our Crow, we're going 
to take it to the opposite.
So external rotation.
So just take note 
here as you stretch,
internal rotation.
And then let's release that and
again if Bakasana is not for you
today you can 
rock out and Froggy.
If you're doing this with
your kids you can give them,
you can give them some hops.
You can give your Froggy 
a couple of hops in the air.
Maybe hop around the room.
And if you're down to clown
and you want to do Bakasana,
we'll again, let's 
find that external rotation.
So we're going to 
take the palms forward.
And so the opposite of 
where we were in that stretch,
we're going to rotate out.
Rotate out as if you're opening
a pickle jar with your left hand
to the left and with 
your right hand to the right.
Then slowly we'll drag 
that closer to the center.
We're going to inhale,
look forward.
Exhale, lift your knees up 
close to your armpit chest
and nice and steady 
you want to keep
your gaze out 
looking ahead, right?
If we're gonna take risk we
can't look behind us because
we're just gonna 
somersault and fall.
We gotta keep eye on the prize.
Eyes out in front and then keep
your breath and your connection
to your center 
really underneath you,
really present in the now.
There's like tons of 
metaphors there but you're like,
"Okay, I'm gonna 
do my Crow now."
Or maybe you're hopping 
around the room like a froggy.
Life is good.
Okay, here we go.
Moving nice and slow, 
keeping the gaze forward though.
Can't stress that enough.
Connecting with your center
maybe you lift one toe up.
Maybe you start 
to lift both toes up
finding that squeeze and lift.
Breathing deep.
Maybe you use a little block
or couple of books to bring the
earth up to you 
as a little perch.
And you can go 
into this and come out.
If you need to massage 
the wrists, you can.
This is where we're ending 
today so have a little fun
either in froggy, in balance.
And if you're a 
little bit frustrated like,
"I don't know what to do here."
This is kind of the point.
You get to decide.
You can find a Boat Pose.
Maybe you want to 
do some half pushups.
Maybe it's straight 
to the meditation seat
where we're gonna end.
But give it a couple 
moments here to play.
And if you get 
frustrated just notice.
And then just 
make a decision like,
"Okay Adriene, 
I'm gonna decide.
"I'm gonna do one thing" or
"I'm gonna try to do one thing."
"I'm gonna give it my best shot."
"And I'm gonna breathe and I'm
gonna know that just by trying
"I'm doing great."
And it's this playtime that
becomes really valuable
not the doing or the end goal.
Becomes like, start 
to realize oh my gorsh,
the process is actually 
where I became awesome
and I learned about myself.
Okay, so from here we're gonna
come to a nice comfortable seat.
If you're still playing, if
you're hopping around the room,
take your time but we're gonna
come to end in a nice seat.
And if you find along 
the way that you need to
windshield wiper the legs or 
do anything like that,
listen to that yearning.
(chuckles)
Listen to that longing.
Ay! Okay.
Sit up nice and tall.
We're gonna close this out with
a little group of pranayama.
And I know that's silly for me
to say group but I'm just taking
a risk and I'm 
embracing the fact that
there's so much beauty in
this idea that we're all
together each time we practice
here even though 
we're alone at home
or maybe you're feeling a
little lonely or like you
don't have the support you need.
So this is a great chance 
if I may just for you to
connect to the big picture.
And as I invite you to draw the
hands together at your heart,
see if you can sit 
up a little taller.
Start to breathe a 
little deeper here.
Nice, active breath 
in the last moments here.
And close your eyes 
and just imagine
thousands and 
thousands of people
doing this in this 
exact moment with you.
Reflecting the same shape 
or a similar shape as you.
And remember you're not alone.
We are all in this together.
And it takes real 
bravery these days
and even risk
to be ourselves.
Perhaps to stand up for
what we feel is good and right.
What we believe in.
But I think even more so it does
take so much risk to even
be honest and be ourselves.
So we're going to end 
with three group breaths.
And just again, see if whatever
it means to you and it could be
nothing just feel 
with your eyes closed,
feel that connection or be open
to feeling that connection as we
breathe to people 
all over the world
practicing with you.
Be open to that connection.
Okay, I'll count us off.
Thank you for letting me lead
today and thanks for sharing
your time and 
energy with the community.
Here we go.
Big inhale.
Exhale, sigh it out.
Don't be shy.
(sighs audibly)
I was a little shy on that one.
Second out of three.
Here we go, big inhale.
Sigh it out.
Find a little sound.
Don't be shy.
(loudly sighs)
And last one.
Freak out your dog or the people
in your house or your neighbors.
Here we go, big inhale.
Take a risk.
Sigh it out long and strong.
(loudly sighs)
Then when you're ready,
gently bow the head.
Give thanks for this moment,
for your practice.
A little certainly 
goes a long way.
Way to show up.
Stay present.
Be kind yourself.
Do the same with others.
Love you guys.
Take good care.
Namaste.
(bright music)
