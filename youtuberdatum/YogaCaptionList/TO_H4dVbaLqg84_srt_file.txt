- Hello my darling friends and
welcome to Yoga With Adriene.
I'm Adriene and this is Benji
and today we have a 
yoga to fill your cup.
Peace Benji.
So this is gonna 
be a great practice
when you're 
feeling low on energy
but you know you wanna do
something good for yourself.
We're gonna start 
low and take it high.
Hop into something 
comfy and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Alrighty my friends,
let's begin today's 
practice on our backs.
Yay.
Come on down to the ground.
Extend the legs out 
long and when you're ready
on an inhale reach the arms all
the way up and overhead
for a nice full body stretch.
Take a couple 
deep breaths here to
rotate the wrists, the ankles.
I'm smiling because my 
ankles are popping (laughs).
Maybe yours are too.
Maybe open and close the palms.
Move the fingers, 
move the toes and make sure
you take a couple deep 
breaths here in this shape.
Start to really land 
here in your practice taking
this time to fill your cup,
to find what feels good.
And then nice and 
easy we're gonna hug
the knees into the chest.
Nice and slow 
you're gonna wrap the arms
around the shins and 
take a couple deep breaths
here nice and easy,
nothing fancy.
Just nice full deep breaths.
Maybe rocking side to side.
You can peel the 
nose up towards the knees.
And today I'm gonna 
invite you to
breathe like 
you love yourself.
Breathe like this 
practice and this time
with your body matters.
Make the most of it and of
course enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.
You're gonna bring the hands
to the backs of the thighs.
We're gonna rock all 
the way up to seated.
If it feels 
awesome or it feels good
to rock a couple 
more times go ahead and do
that, massaging up and 
down the length of your spine.
Maybe tapping into a 
little inner smile as you do so.
And we'll come up to a nice
cross-legged seat together.
Bring the palms together,
Anjali Mudra at the heart.
Nice active connection here.
So send your 
elbows left to right.
Lift the sternum 
up to your thumbs,
lengthen through 
the crown of the head.
Take a deep breath in.
And on an exhale bow 
your head to your heart.
Continue to breathe deeply here.
Again, breathe 
like you love yourself.
Feel this deep stretch 
in the back of the neck.
Opportunity here to 
set a little intention
for your practice
or for your life.
Just taking one 
quiet moment here
before we really get moving.
And then just 
notice what came up
and if nothing 
came up that's okay.
You're still breathing.
You're still bringing attention
inward and you're getting
a nice great stretch 
in the back of the neck.
Alright, together, let's take a 
deep breath in through the nose.
And as you 
exhale go ahead and let
it out softly through the mouth.
Lift the head, 
open the eyes and we're
gonna take the 
palms to the knees.
Slowly bring your navel back.
Start to round 
through the spine,
shoulders come forward,
chin to chest.
Now get really 
heavy from the waist down
and we're gonna 
move nice and slow here.
As you inhale smooth 
the chest, the heart forward.
Think Cow Pose and then exhale.
Draw the naval back,
chin to chest,
rounding it back, 
shoulders forward.
Think Cat Pose.
Keep it going in 
a nice circle here.
Inhale, coming forward.
And exhale, rounding back.
So try not to rush this here.
We wanna really get some good
spinal flection going on.
So, think about the spine as
you create this circular motion.
You might even close your eyes
once you have the hang of it
to really visualize 
the spine, each vertebra.
And then reverse your circle.
Synchronize with your breath.
Awesome. Then bring 
the head and the heart
and the pelvis back 
to one straight line
and we'll take the fingertips
down gently at your sides.
Great. Walk the left palm out.
Press it firmly into the earth
so you have lots of space here.
Then take the 
right fingertips
all the way up 
towards the sky first.
Feel this length 
in the side body
as you reach up 
all the way towards
the ceiling or 
the sky and then take
it over and find 
your side body stretch.
Synchronize with 
the breath here.
Soft, easy movement.
And then bring it all the 
way back up through center.
Fingertips back 
on the earth and when
you're ready walk 
the right palm out.
Give yourself a lot of 
space from the hips here.
Press the palm into 
the earth and inhale,
reach the left 
fingertips all the way
straight up 
towards the sky first.
Feel that connection 
from the left hip
all the way up 
through the left fingertips.
Take another deep 
breath in and then on
an exhale take it up and over
into a nice side body stretch.
Find what feels good here.
Explore, create space.
Breathe deep.
Great, then bring it 
all the way back to center.
We'll bring the 
palms together once again.
Interlace the 
fingertips this time.
Press the palms 
forward here.
Getting a nice stretch through
the wrists, 
through the forearms.
See if you can 
draw your shoulders back
into socket a bit here 
as you lift the sternum,
the heart up even higher.
Inhale in.
Exhale out.
One more deep inhale in here.
And exhale to release the bind
and come forward onto all fours.
When you arrive walk 
the palms nice and wide,
pinkies towards the 
outer edges of your mat.
Upper arm bones 
rotate out externally.
And as you're ready 
we'll curl the toes under,
take a deep breath in.
And on your exhale 
keep the knees bent
as you slowly 
peel the tailbone up.
Bring the belly 
towards the tops of the thighs.
Stay here for 
one cycle of breath.
Building strength.
Waking up the 
muscles of the body.
And then as you're 
ready drop the heels,
let them get really heavy and if
you wanna pedal 
it out here please do.
Stretching through the 
calves and the hamstrings.
Find a deep breath here.
And when you're ready actively
anchor through the left heel.
As you inhale lift the right
knee in towards your heart.
Check it out.
I'm in Downward Dog 
but I'm squeezing
the right knee up in 
towards my heart space.
Feel the low belly come in.
Hug the low ribs in.
Breathe here for three, two.
Kick it up on the one, 
Three-Legged Dog.
Spiral the right pinky toe down.
Inhale in.
Exhale, bend your right knee,
open it up stacking the 
right hip over the left.
Try to keep your right shoulder
in the same plane 
as your left shoulder.
So, shoulders nice and square
here while working towards that.
Take a deep breath in, inhale.
(Benji barking)
Exhale. Hi Benji.
Step the right 
foot all the way up.
Nice low lunge.
Lower the back 
knee to the earth.
Do a hair toss 
with your ponytail.
I'm just kidding.
Slowly lift the chest,
look forward.
Front knee is 
over front ankle here,
you can keep the back knee low
on the ground or 
you can lift it here
just depending on 
how you're feeling today.
Big stretch.
So, bring a nice deep breath.
Awesome.
Then plant the palms.
Step the right toes back.
We're coming into a Plank Pose.
So you can lift both 
knees or you can come to
a Half Plank keeping 
both knees, kissing the earth.
Upper arm bones 
still rotating out here.
I'm connecting to the core 
by drawing my low belly in,
by hugging the low ribs in, 
connecting to center.
We're here for three, two.
Go ahead and lower all 
the way to the belly on one.
Then press into 
the tops of the feet.
Squeeze the elbows into your
side body and inhale, lift up.
Bhujangasana, Cobra.
On your exhale slowly release.
Press back up to all fours.
Reestablish great 
connection with the hands
finding that 
hand to earth press.
Upper arm bones 
rotate out and once
again we will 
curl the toes under.
Articulate Adriene, sorry.
And nice and slow,
check it out,
lifting the hips creases first
keeping the knees bent, 
keeping the belly leaning
towards the tops 
of the thighs here.
Waking up the muscles.
Take a deep breath in
and then exhale, 
straighten the legs.
Let the heels get heavy here.
Keep that hand 
to earth connection.
Pedal it out if 
you like or enjoy
a moment of stillness 
letting the breath move you.
And now actively 
anchoring the right heel down
you're gonna lift the left
knee up in towards the heart.
Try to create a contraction,
a connection to 
your core muscles,
the abdominal 
wall waking up here
as you breathe deep for 
three, two and then kicking
the left foot out,
Three-Legged Dog
keeping those hips squared.
Breathing deep, crawling 
into the fingertips here.
And then bending the left knee,
slowly stacking the hips,
keeping the shoulder 
square or working towards
that as you breathe 
deep here. Big stretch.
Right heel is heavy.
Awesome. And then 
slow and steady
bringing it all the way through,
stepping the left 
foot all the way up,
lowering the back knee down
and finding your low lunge.
So back knee can be 
lowered or lifted here.
Or maybe a little bit of 
both as you breathe deep.
Open the chest.
Always working to 
integrate the neck.
Keep that awareness.
Thinking of the neck, right?
Always as an extension of the
spine in your Asana practice.
Okie doke, here we go.
Planting the palms, 
stepping it back, Plank Pose.
Inhale to shift forward.
Look forward.
Try to keep those 
elbows hugging into
the side body as you 
slowly lower down to the belly.
Good. Inhale, Cobra.
Lift it up.
Exhale to soften 
and release everything.
Press back up to all fours.
Curl the toes under right away,
and then lifting the 
hips up high and back.
Downward Dog.
Awesome. From here bend 
the knees generously bringing
the belly towards 
the tops of the thighs,
creating space in 
the shoulders melting
your heart towards your knees
and then nice and slow baby
steps to the top of the mat.
So, really stretching through
the ankle here or the achilles,
the calf as you 
walk all the way to
a nice Forward Fold 
at the top of your mat.
Bend your knees as 
generously as you need to here.
Shake the head a little yes.
And a little no.
Find those I love you 
breaths again.
Inhaling deeply in 
through the nose.
And exhaling completely out
through the nose or the mouth.
Then bend your 
knees a little more.
Drop your hips back in space.
Nice and easy you're gonna start
to roll it up, 
straightening through the legs.
Enjoy this move.
Come into a 
beautiful Mountain Pose
grounding through the feet.
Lengthening through the crown.
And on your 
next big inhale reach
the arms all 
the way up overhead.
Spread the fingertips.
Take the thumbs back, 
pinkies forward and imagine
your shoulder blades 
coming in to kiss each other
and then dropping 
down the back body.
So give yourself a 
lotta space and in case
you're here give 
yourself more space.
Imagine you're holding a big
beach ball up and overhead.
Then connect to 
your core by drawing
your navel in just a 
bit and maybe lifting
up through the pelvic floor.
Strong legs here.
Lifting gently up 
from the kneecaps.
Inhale in, exhale, 
palms kiss together
and slowly melt 
down towards the heart.
From here you're gonna turn
your left fingertips forward,
your right fingertips in
and then we're gonna 
catch the hands here.
Catching the fingers, 
bringing them into fists.
Great. Tug the 
elbows left to right here.
Lift your heart.
Again, feel that 
connection in your feet.
Kneecaps lifting, 
pelvic floor lifting.
So, the whole body's 
nice and awake here.
Inhale in, exhale.
You're gonna slowly 
take your right elbow up,
your left elbow down.
Keep the heels 
nice and grounded here
as you bring the 
hands behind your head,
feel this stretch 
in your left side body,
left low back as you 
really lift actively,
right elbow up 
feeling that opening
in the front of 
the right hip crease,
the right abdominal wall.
Take one more deep breath in.
And then exhale slowly.
Bring it back to center.
Hug the low ribs in.
You'll switch the bind here.
So just switching the fingers.
Right elbow up, excuse me,
right thumb up this time.
Left thumb down.
Both elbows 
extending left to right here.
Reestablish your Mountain Pose.
Inhale in, then exhale.
Here we go taking the right
elbow down, left elbow up.
Breathing in.
You can lean your head back,
lift your heart up.
Big stretch here.
Use your breath 
to create more space.
Dig into the heels.
Keep the tailbone 
lengthening down.
One more breath.
And then slowly 
bring it back to center.
Awesome, release the bind.
Fingertips are gonna go down
to come up as you inhale.
Once again reach the arms all
the way up toward the sky.
This time exhale, 
send your hips back.
Fingertips rain down.
Heart stays open.
Gaze forward as 
you bend the knees,
send the hips back coming 
into a little ski position.
So I'm wanting to 
really send my shins back
digging into the heels,
pressing into all four corners
of the feet 
firmly for stability.
You can even lift the 
toes here to test that out.
Let the low back get 
long by slowly lengthening,
tailbone down towards the earth.
Hugging the low ribs in.
Then sink a little deeper.
And a little deeper.
And now let's 
flow a couple times.
So inhale.
Dig into the earth, 
straighten the legs.
Send the fingertips up high.
Volcano Pose.
Big beach ball up and overhead.
Exhale.
Slowly raining the fingertips
down keeping the chest open,
sending the hips back coming
into your modified Chair.
Inhale, reach it up.
Dig into the heels.
Build strength.
Exhale, slow and steady.
Heart stays open, 
core stays engaged
as you send the hips back.
Fingertips reach way back.
Airplane arms.
Inhale to reach it up.
Exhale, bend the knees.
Activating the upper back body
here drawing the 
shoulder blades together.
Great, one more time.
Inhale, reach it up.
This time as you 
exhale send the hips way back,
bend the knees, 
fingertips way back.
You might lift the heels.
Stretching through the foot,
opening through the chest.
Breathing deep here.
Excellent, then drop 
the heels, inhale.
Reach it all the way up 
and exhale, hands to heart.
Go ahead and turn now to step
the feet super wide on your mat.
So you can use the sound 
of my voice to guide you.
You don't have to 
move your mat here.
We're gonna bring the feet wide.
Arms way out and 
you can kind of gauge
where the feet should 
be by maybe bringing
them underneath the 
hands or the wrists.
Awesome.
Then let the 
feet be parallel here
so you can feel that 
stretch in the outer ankle.
Draw energy up 
through the inner arch,
inner ankle and 
you should be able
to feel that in the inner thigh.
Lift up through the front body,
ground through the back body,
then turn the 
thumbs up and start
to reach your fingertips 
up high for a big star pose.
Holding space for yourself here.
Breathing into all 
four sides of the torso.
Close your eyes.
Again, use the sound of 
my voice to guide you here.
Pressing firmly, actively into
the outer edge of the foot,
drawing energy up 
through the inner arch,
inner ankle, inner thigh.
Lift your heart, 
tuck your chin slightly
to lengthen more in 
the back of the neck,
and listen to the sound 
of your breath here
for three cycles in and out, 
in and out, in and out,
holding space, taking up space,
filling your cup.
You got it.
Stick with it.
Awesome and then 
slow and with control
bring the palms together.
Inhale to lift up 
from the base of the spine,
sternum lifts to the thumbs,
crown of the head reaches high.
Then we're gonna bend the
knees, take a deep breath in.
And on an exhale 
you're gonna hop
the feet together 
back to Mountain.
Here we go.
Try to catch it here.
Lift the corners 
of the mouth slightly.
Take one more 
final deep breath in.
And exhale to bow the head.
Take a second 
here to just observe.
Notice how you feel.
And give thanks for 
your practice and this time,
that you have cultivated,
created for yourself.
You rock.
Thank you so much for sharing
your valuable time 
and energy with me.
I tip my hat to 
you for taking time
to fill your cup 
knowing that it will serve
not only you but 
all of your loved ones
and all of the 
people you work with
and even complete 
and total strangers.
So love you guys.
Let me know how it went for
you in the comments section
down below and 
I'll see you next time.
Namaste.
