hey what's up
mkbhd here and welcome to your first
look and hands on with
the galaxy s 21 ultra
so right off the top of the year
samsung's coming out swinging now i also
have a video about the s21 and s21 plus
dropping at the same time here so
that'll be the first link below the like
button check it out if you're interested
but this is the big dog so we kind of
know what to expect at this point from
samsung's
new ultra high end phones right so s21
ultra
will start at 1200 bucks so it should be
the best of what they can offer
but just to look back for a second at
s20 ultra
this phone last year was kind of a whiff
i mean it still did have a lot of the
high end ultra
numbers that you look for but because of
the focus issues with the camera it was
just never something
you quite recommended it got passed on a
lot for the money
so the s21 ultra looks to get them back
to
the best of everything world with a lot
of next-gen parts and pieces now right
off the bat
first thing you notice is the biggest
change which is they've packed
everything in this new design so we
might as well just start with that
so i got to handle these in the matte
black and this sort of silver color
so it looks just like the leaks and the
rumors we're expecting
and i think i like it now i don't know
if i love it
i'm still on the train that sort of a
horizontal camera bump like nexus 6p
was actually kind of peak but the more i
look at this contour cut design
the more futuristic it looks to me it
kind of looks like someone was making
a thicker phone with the huge cameras
and then
just melted it down to a thinner body
for the rest of the phone it's kind of
hard to explain it basically it looks
like
harvey dent like two face but on the
smaller models it actually has a cool
color contrast model with the side rails
but i'll talk more about that
in that video on the ultra it's all
matte across the entire back which i
love and then shiny
on the sides so speaking of those
cameras we've got four here on the back
of the ultra
it's a new second gen 108 megapixel main
camera
with ois at f 1.8 very curious to see
how that'll shoot then you've got a 12
megapixel ultrawide which should be
pretty sweet at 120 degrees
and then two telephoto cameras you've
got two
a 3x telephoto and a 10x
periscope lens so this is an interesting
zoom situation i was playing with the
phone trying to imagine
why they would do it like this i i think
samsung's probably done the math on
well most people either zoom in a little
bit or like
all the way and so i guess if they're
just getting a 3x
and then the 10x will facilitate the
space zoom that goes really far
my curiosity is how will it do in
between 3x and 10x
we'll have to see but if you go in the
camera app it looks very familiar it's
the samsung stuff
all these zoom buttons are still here
but now you can see you can go all the
way from that 3x
to 10x and it's doing digital zoom in
between those two numbers
then from 10x on it's coming from the
periscope lens and space zoom is still
here so you can go all the way to 100
on the ultra and it's right off the bat
actually looking much
more stable than the last gen which is
actually pretty nice
there's also some improvements to the
higher end modes like a director's view
for more control over live switching
between the cameras and recording from
multiple cameras at once and there's
also multi-device recording from both
the phone's mics
and your headphone mics at the same time
and then improved single take mode so
cool stuff here we all know the ultra
and samsung's lineup is supposed to have
the top of the line cameras
and this is the best they can offer and
you can you can even see the laser
autofocus here so
i'm almost surprised i didn't toss in a
macro camera to sort of fill up the
space and make an even grid
but hey it's a periscope lens taking up
that space instead
begging to be tested so yeah lots of new
camera parts it'll be interesting to see
how these perform
definitely make sure you subscribe to
the channel if you haven't already
to be among the first to see the review
when it comes out we can test these
things
but enough about the back of the phone
let's talk about the front so it's a big
phone of course
it's the ultra and that allows for a
huge 6.8 inch
quad hd oled display and this time
it's quad hd at 120 hertz
so you can see here in the settings it's
at the 1440p resolution
and motion smoothness is also set to
adaptive up to 120 hertz so that's sweet
but also this new adaptive refresh rate
on the ultra is new
and it'll automatically constantly be
switching all the way up and down
between 10 hertz and 120 hertz so that
should help save
a lot of battery in this adaptive mode
it'll be really interesting to test to
see how responsive it is
and to see how much battery it saves so
you imagine when you're not really doing
anything on the display nothing's moving
it throttles all the way down to 10
hertz i'm curious if that can
bring it to the same battery life or
close to the regular 60 hertz mode
i'm not too worried about overall
battery life the phone does still have a
5 000 milliamp hour battery
so uh not concerned about being bad i'm
just more curious if it can be
amazing i also love that the display is
nearly flat
it is slightly rounded at the very edges
but not nearly as much as i've seen it
in other phones which makes me happy
and there is the small cutout at the top
for the ridiculous
40 megapixel selfie camera and they also
dropped qualcomm's new
much larger and hopefully faster in
display fingerprint sensor back there
it's 1.77 times larger than the last gen
and i'm hoping less finicky too and
the display's max brightness is now up
to 25 percent brighter up to 1500 nits
and there's a new ai based blue light
shield option for better viewing comfort
if you're into that but yeah everything
else you're looking at here
is right in line with what you'd expect
from the 2021
samsung flagship great build quality
it's ip68 water resistant
the newest internals of course with the
five nanometer snapdragon triple eight
in this region it'll be the five
nanometer exynos chip in other regions
which will be interesting again to test
to see how it fares with battery 15 watt
wireless charging there's reverse
wireless charging too
great buttons tiny bezels the whole
thing one interesting spec though that
is
missing there is no expandable storage
anymore so the micro sd card is
basically going extinct now samsung was
some of the last ones to do in their
flagships
so there are only three specs for total
storage on this phone 128
256 or 512 gigs and then so unlike the
smaller s21 and s21 plus
there's different amounts of ram on
these versions so those all will have
eight gigs of ram
on the ultra you start at 12 gigs of ram
for the 128 and 256
and if you go with the tip top half a
terabyte max spec
that'll have 16 gigs of ram so your
trading
your expandable storage for a lot of ram
i guess also speaking of things that are
gone no headphones or charger in the box
confirmed
like i've warned you this is gonna start
happening very quickly across the
industry iphone 12 was a huge domino to
fall
so now don't expect a power brick and a
flagship phone from here on out
but last thing let's talk about the s
pen
it was added to the s21 ultra s pen
support now okay a lot of people
saw this in the rumors leading up to
this and thought oh that probably means
the galaxy note
is on its way out maybe they'll kill it
soon i don't think
so i when i this is just coming from my
like hour of playing with the phone
the stylus on the s21 ultra feels like a
very optional add-on
accessory where on the galaxy note
well it's still an integral part of the
note experience
and it's just they're in very different
worlds so first of all like i said it's
an optional
40 accessory so if you want to buy an s
pen for your s21 ultra it'll cost you
and then it's actually compatible with
other s pens of the past so if you have
one already you can
carry that too but the whole experience
is passive
so the whole low latency writing and
drawing experience is all the same
but there's no bluetooth or gesture
controls
like you would have on the note and then
of course there's a whole how do you
carry it
question since there's no silo built
into the phone
so that's another optional accessory so
you can get a stylus and a case
for now 70 extra dollars and the phone
sort of just clicks into this
rubber slot in the side of the case
which is fine i guess
but it's it's definitely a very optional
accessory and so if you're gonna go
through
all of that and spend extra money to
to have a stylus on your high-end
samsung phone i feel like the obvious
choice is to buy a note where it
slots in perfectly and neatly every time
charges has the active experience has
more features and of course there will
be a note
21 ultra i guess it's not an of course
thing i'm predicting
there will be a note 21 ultra that
people wanting a stylish
consider later this year so i don't
think the note's going anywhere but
that's basically it for the
new s21 ultra what do you think is this
enough of a redemption
i mean you get the huge numbers again
you get a lot of next-gen pieces it
seems to be going in the right direction
there is of course the s21 and s21 plus
launching alongside it on january 29th
but if you're gonna spend the big bucks
this is what you're gonna get and
they've also launched smart tags
and galaxy buds pro so samsung's clearly
popping off right at the beginning of
the year but
let me know what you think is this the
one you guys would pick or would you go
for one of the other
s21 models let me know thanks for
watching i'll catch you guys in the next
one

peace
