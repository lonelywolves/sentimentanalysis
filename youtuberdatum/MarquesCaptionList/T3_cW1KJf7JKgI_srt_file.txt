battery's low
yeah plug it in fair
[Music]
yep
i just wish it was faster yeah
plug it in
[Music]
hey hey what's up mkbhd here and this
lenovo
legion dual 2 is already
the fastest most powerful phone i've
ever used
but there's so much more to a phone than
just pure speed and you know you know
those people who like every couple weeks
sort of make their way around headlines
and youtube comments
saying phones are getting boring again
and everything looks the same
and there's no innovation anymore this
one's for you so this
is one of the weirdest phones i've ever
seen
and it tries a bunch of new things and
they're not necessarily always
fantastic ideas but sometimes you got to
try a bunch of weird stuff
to land on a great idea so i'm just here
to point the camera at the thing
and show you what they've tried so as
you can probably tell from the name and
the general aesthetic
it's a gaming phone and they are not shy
about it so you know how some of the
gaming phones lately
started off pretty aggressive but then
have slowly started to get
a little softer at least aesthetically
not this one
not this one this one barely really even
looks like a phone at all it honestly
looks
more just kind of like a mobile game
console that
happens to make phone calls and send
texts take pictures
so the whole thing is laid out
horizontally
like this because you know any real
games
on your phone are going to be the
horizontal ones and so all the
components
inside are laid out horizontally now
when i tell you this phone has
a 5500 milliamp hour battery you might
be wondering where
could you fit that in a phone this shape
but that battery
is split between the left side and the
right side of the phone literally so
2 750 milliamp hours on the right and
27.50 on the left and actually think
this is a great idea
it has multiple benefits first of all
the sides of the phone where your
fingers usually are
actually stay cooler to the touch
because of all the hot components that
require cooling
all being lined up in the middle the
weight distribution is also now
perfectly even
and that lets them focus all the cooling
on just that smaller portion just the
middle of the phone
and that's exactly what they do so you
can see they gave it a whole turbine fan
that happens to actually light up if you
want it to
you know gamery stuff is next to the rgb
logo on the back
and there's a vent on each side to
exhaust the hot air from the cpu
gpu motherboard ram etc there also
doesn't have to be a separate camera
bump
because the cameras are in the middle
too
i'm telling you nothing about this phone
is conventional so you might remember
pretty recently the whole dual battery
turbo charging thing
in some other phones like vook charging
and all that oneplus did it
and that would be literally because
they'd have a split battery inside the
phone so phones with this tech could
charge at
50 watts for example because both
batteries would charge in parallel
at 25 watts each this phone
kind of takes it to a hilarious extreme
there are two usbc ports on the phone
and it comes with this 90 watt charging
brick
with two usbc ports
on the brick and if you plug in the two
included usb cables from the box
into both of those usbc ports and plug
in
both of the usb ports on the phone one
on the bottom
one on the side you can charge this
thing at 90 watts which is crazy fast
you can get 50
charge from dead in 13 minutes or
literally go zero to a hundred and half
an hour which is very impressive for a
battery this big
but it's also kind of hilarious seeing
your phone plugged in twice and it might
be a little bit of a hassle to carry
this heavy brick
and two charging cables everywhere you
go but
the satisfaction of plugging in both
ports on the phone and seeing the
animation light up and the battery
percentage just starting to
jump up yeah i'd say that's worth it
plus this is a phone with a lot of other
well thought out battery options
so they offer bypass charging so you can
just power it from a cable instead of
just the battery to avoid heat like we
saw with the rog phone five
also there's all kinds of charging
limiters to preserve long-term battery
health
it's a nice trend to see the stuff more
baked in you can of course also always
just plug in with one
port like any other lame phone with only
one charging port
but of course you're only going to get
45 watts that way you know
but hey being able to plug in from the
side is way more comfortable
if you're gaming so that's why the
gaming phones do that love it
but man this phone has the works as far
as hardware goes as you'd expect
dual front-facing speakers in this sort
of aggressive
triangular shape that gets very loud a
huge
6.92 inch 144 hertz 1080p oled display
up front
with a ridiculous 720 hertz
touch sampling rate and 1300 nits peak
brightness
there's a ton of touch sensitive
remappable buttons
on the sides and the back of this thing
so for gaming it's got everything you
need
and to drive all this you've got the
snapdragon triple eight up to half a
terabyte of fast storage
and up to 18 gigs of ram
so this is the most maxed out phone on
paper again and
it definitely translates to
responsiveness there's no question about
that it's the snappiest phone i've ever
laid hands on
even when you're not gaming just
flipping around the ui multitasking
etc but you know what that's that's
maybe the least important thing
about a phone like this right it's a
gaming phone
we want to know how it games okay now
let's be real for a second when it comes
to mobile gaming i would consider myself
a bit of a casual i think that's a fair
a fair description like i've reviewed
gaming phones before but
i don't play the most intensive games
it's kind of like reviewing a supercar
without taking it to the track like you
get a better idea of what it's like to
live with
sure but it leaves out a pretty big
reason why you'd get a car like that
so i could tell you from my extremely
casual gaming use that this phone
absolutely crushes everything as you'd
expect it's actually overkill usually
i don't get any functional advantage
from a 720hz touch refresh rate
when i'm playing among us like it's
really more than enough
but even when you're playing a heavier
game like asphalt 9 you can start to
feel the combined advantages of
everything this phone does start to come
to life the high refresh rate
and the screen look incredible and super
sharp and immersive of course
the super high touch sample rate is
great for making quick cuts and moves in
the car
but also the customizable triggers on
the shoulder of the phone come in handy
because
now you're touching the same spot on the
screen over and over again for nitro
and drifting so you can just map those
to the shoulder triggers so that's
really nice to never have to block the
screen with my fingers
and there's way more than i'd ever need
this phone has
four ultrasonic shoulder keys with a
hertz touch sample refresh each
and two more rear capacitive touch
points
plus you've got two more force touch
spots on either side of the display so
obviously the games i played don't need
all that but if you do
you've got all these extra keys as an
option now if you're playing a game like
asphalt 9
after a while pretty much any phone is
going to start to get pretty warm now
the outside of this phone
actually legit stayed a little bit
cooler on the outsides where my fingers
are
versus the middle which got warmer and
spun up the fan
and kept performance high that is an
actual real measurable benefit that i
felt
not just a gimmick and then something
you also quickly notice and i'll just
have to describe it to you because it's
kind of hard to show it on video
this phone has two haptic motors
one linear haptic motor on each side of
the phone
and they combine to make a really strong
thumpy punchy vibration motor it is
is really impressive i'm gonna i'm gonna
say it's the most strong
and impressive vibration i felt in any
phone i don't think any other phone has
two
uh and so it's awesome one gaming any
sort of like
light interaction footsteps scraping by
something every gunfire
really feels strong on this phone
i keep calling it a phone but on this
mobile gaming console
but also when you do just use it like a
phone like typing on the keyboard
an alarm clock like everything you'd
expect to to vibrate
it is very strong but hey like i said
i'm just a casual
so i handed this phone to andrew
resident
gaming enthusiasts here at the studio
but also a long time pub g player
handed him this phone with pub g mobile
on it and not exaggerating
his first game he methodically sort of
learns the mechanics through the first
few minutes
he's getting some kills picking up ammo
and supplies
the circle starts shrinking other people
start dying and he starts getting a few
more kills
the fans start spinning up as the phone
starts to hum along and keep those
frames up
and sure enough seven kills later he
wins the game his first game
chicken dinner made it look easy now i'm
not saying this phone
is the reason why he won
but that is pretty impressive now when
you're in a game and you just want to
toggle a setting or something like that
real quick
you can just swipe down from the top and
then you have a bunch of quickly
accessible settings mostly to do with
gaming
your volume brightness signal strength
and your ping
is sitting there and then your cpu and
gpu clock speed
just for kicks but also with a rampage
button
to literally max out the clock speeds to
keep those frames up
at all costs and there's also the bypass
charge toggle if you want to turn that
on and you're plugged in
and there's also something here you can
see called stream mode all right you
ready for this this is
one last gimmick i promise this is a
last crazy thing
the selfie camera is uh
is inside the power button
of course so that's a 44 megapixel
motorized
live stream ready selfie camera that's
literally oriented horizontally all the
time because its primary purpose
is to be your webcam if you want to
stream your games
directly to twitch or youtube that's
right
the phone is not only ready to max out
your games but it's ready to broadcast
your games with that extremely average
quality selfie camera
i'd expect nothing less also it's really
loud to open and close
anyway uh this is amazing there's
honestly no other phone i've ever used
that's quite like this
and it's so weird to keep saying that
it's a phone just because it feels like
the phone functionality
in this is such an afterthought it
happens to do other things like
do you even care about the camera
quality in a phone like this there
happens to be
a 64 megapixel primary camera on the
back that's literally blocked when you
open up the camera app because the way
you normally hold a phone puts your
fingers right over it
but it happens to pair that with 123
degree ultra wide
and collectively they both take
reasonable
acceptable photos and good light this
thing happens to also
send text messages and make phone calls
if you really want it to
it can also use the internet and browse
through other apps and it can be an
amazing
alarm clock with those huge haptics and
gigantic speakers but all of that feels
like it just
happens to be true at this point this is
just
it's the ultimate all-in on the gaming
phone again
it's it's not trying to hide it or be
shy about it
and do things like wireless charging or
water resistance
it kind of doesn't matter at this level
it's just a mobile
gaming handheld with cellular so even if
it's not for me
i'm glad they made it i'm glad this
exists and i would i would happily
recommend it to other people i know
who are much more into mobile gaming
but speaking of that that's the question
i want to ask you that's that's what i
want to leave you with
for this video do any of you watching
this video
actually consider buying a gaming phone
like do any of you play a game on your
phone
so much that you would specifically get
a phone tailored to being better at that
and if so what game are you playing let
me know in the comment section below if
you if you know that guy if you are that
guy
either way that's been it thanks for
watching
catch you guys in the next one peace
you
