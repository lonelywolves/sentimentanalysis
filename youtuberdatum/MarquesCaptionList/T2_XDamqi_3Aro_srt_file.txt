hey what's up
mkbhd here first of all welcome to
techtober
and i've been wearing this red apple
watch series 6
every day since the impressions video
now so been living with it i've worked
out with it i've slept with it on
pretty much everything so this is the
full review oh by the way if you're
wondering like hey
what about the video about this other
thing or where's your video on x
or insert review here there's a lot
going on
right now in the tech world that's why
we named them october and september
so we're catching up to a lot of it
expect a lot of videos in october but
okay so
summary with this watch is there's
really not a whole ton of
massively new stuff as you already knew
like okay some slightly brighter always
on display
cool slightly faster charging cool
and also a slightly new sensor with the
blood oxygen but
a lot of the stuff that makes the apple
watch the apple watch and so good
is of course in the software watchos
that's going to make its way
to other apple watches but i think one
of the biggest mistakes
we make in the tech world so often in
these mature
categories is comparing the new thing to
last year's thing
when most people buying the new thing
aren't upgrading from last year's thing
that's actually a pretty rare use case
most people have three
four year old plus versions that are
aging by the time they upgrade to this
one so yeah surprise
if you already have an apple watch
series 4 or 5
you don't need to upgrade but if you
don't have an apple watch yet
well this is the most complete
ecosystem bait yet so let's just start
with
the headlighting new feature which is
actually the blood oxygen sensor
uh it's not actually the first smart
watch to add this but they did add it
now to the apple watch
and well it probably shouldn't be your
reason to buy this watch now i mean for
what it's worth i've been getting pretty
decent
accurate measurements as far as i can
tell you get it pretty snug
slide it down your wrist near your hand
and sit still
for a few seconds anything in the upper
90s is normal
and i've gotten like 98 to 100 every
time
i try it sitting down great but if for
some reason i
stood up or moved around a little bit or
for whatever reason i didn't get 98 and
i got
88 for some reason which would be a
concerning actual measurement
i wouldn't really be freaking out at all
because lots of people have gotten
very inaccurate measurements or just had
problems getting a good reliable measure
at all but for a little background a
dedicated
blood oxygen sensor is normally worn
on your fingertip just like that i
actually learned this while i was
working with david blaine on the
ascension project
uh he needed one to be really accurate
to actually tell if he was hypoxic or
not which would be dangerous
but you clamp it to your finger and it
just measures the blood oxygen
saturation
by shining a light through your
fingertip and then
reading it on the other side so it's
going through your finger now the apple
watch is attempting to get the same
reading but obviously in a non-ideal
place
on the back of your wrist so it's
shining into your wrist but obviously
can't read from the other side so it's
trying to read from the reflections
and most blood oxygen sensors don't read
this way for a reason it's just much
more difficult to get an
accurate reliable reading from this spot
on your body
now actually as dave 2d points out in
his video you can actually take the
apple watch off and put it on your
fingertip
to get much more consistent readings but
yeah if you're doing all that and you
care
that much about accurate blood oxygen
readings
you should just grab a 25 pulse oximeter
from amazon
and it will be way more accurate than
any smart watch so yeah this is much
more just like a casual
extra sensor to give you some new
readings in the health app if you want
to gamify it and track it
uh so if you go for hikes and stuff then
cool you get to see oh my blood oxygen's
94 instead of 100
but you shouldn't be taking it to the
doctor um speaking of
extra readings in the health app sleep
mode so there's sleep tracking built
into the apple watch now
it is actually a watch os 7 feature
again so it's not like it's exclusive to
the series six but
hey i tested it like i said i've been
wearing it every day i've been sleeping
in the apple watch
because i guess that's the apple effect
getting people to try things
so when you're about to go to sleep you
swipe up control center hit that little
bedtime icon and the screen goes black
and it starts sleep tracking and really
what i found is it doesn't track
that much hardcore information like
basically it's whether it thinks you're
asleep or not
heart rate once in a while trends up and
down
things like that pretty casual but
nothing really groundbreaking and people
who already have been using
third-party apple watch apps to track
sleep already know way more about their
sleep
than this will tell you but like i said
it's just one more thing that's plugging
into the health app and giving you a
pretty good basic look
at what's going on here so okay it works
and that's great and everything but you
know what the best part is
you know the best part of wearing an
apple watch to sleep
actually is it's the alarm 100
it's the alarm it just taps you awake
just with a little haptic motor no sound
or anything
and that's been massively underrated i
really don't like wearing a thing like
this to sleep
but the fact that it just taps me awake
and i never have an actual alarm
sound has been uh pretty sweet but also
apple i noticed
it adds standing hours while i'm asleep
so i wake up every day with like two to
four
standing hours which is kind of odd
because
i don't know about you but i sleep lying
down but the charging question
the charging question is interesting now
because if you wear the watch
all day and then you wear to sleep when
do you charge the thing it does have
slightly faster
90 minute zero to 100 charging but when
do you actually get it on the charger
for me i found two times during the day
and neither of them are a full charge
but the first one is like
right when i like go shower at night but
after a workout or something i'll pop it
on the charger and that'll juice it up
enough to last through the night
and then when i wake up in the morning
so it taps me awake
and i just take it off and put it on the
charger and go through my morning
routine so it's just sitting on the
charger juicing up for the day
so it never actually gets to 100 i'm
just kind of always bouncing between
20 and 85 percent which is actually
better for battery health on the watch
and yeah i never got it to die in a day
again so battery life on the watch is
still good it's still about what it's
been for series four and five
and i also do have the always on display
going to me the real
best feature of the apple watch series 6
is just the new s6 chip inside like
that's what's giving you
the great efficiency to last all day
that's what's giving you the brighter
always on display
uh if you disable the oezon display
you'll probably get even better battery
life
and then it's enabling the faster
charging that chip is giving you the
great performance through watchos 7
which now has faster snappier animations
throughout the whole thing
which is great oh and also the hand
washing detection in watchos 7
is kind of hilarious like it'll pick up
that
yes i am washing my hands through the
microphone and the the movement it's
sensing
and then it'll start some countdown
timer based on when it thinks you
started and if you get to the end of the
20 seconds
great little soapy thumbs up thing but
if you don't get to the end of the 20
seconds it just kind of
quietly disappears like reminding you to
do it better next time the shame but
yeah all this stuff
pretty minor i think the biggest
literally the biggest change most people
notice with this new watch
is the colors which by the way i'm going
to be switching back to
my black series 5 because it does look
cool sometimes but i don't need a red
watch every single day but also the
other new thing they made alongside the
new watch is
the new solo loop bands and they are
a great idea i love the simplicity of
just stretching a band to put it on
no velcro or magnets or buckles or
anything you just
put it on get your size right which can
be a little finicky but
get it snug and it's super clean the
only weird thing is they seem to fit the
watch a little bit worse than
all the other bands like see how it
doesn't go quite all the way
to the edge of the watch and you can
kind of see some of the metal inside
instead of it sitting flush
with the red of this watch kind of weird
if you find that important
i personally don't but it's worth noting
so you can see it here
but you know these are 50 to 100 watch
bands order them if you dare so there
you have it
pretty short list again the thing to
keep in mind is they're make they're not
making this for people
with an apple watch series 5 or even
series 4.
i think people with a series 3 or older
will just have
this as the new version to upgrade to
around the holiday season
conveniently but the truth is most
people don't even need this newest
version with all the
bells and whistles and extra sensors
there's also the new apple watch se
which has the new s6
chip but hey there's no
electrocardiogram and there's no blood
oxygen sensor
and there's no always on display but it
is a much lower price
and that's fine for most people getting
their first apple watch so if it ain't
broke
don't fix it and apple absolutely did
not fix
anything that wasn't broken they didn't
change the shape or offer a circular
version
or anything like that they didn't add qi
charging
they didn't you know open up a watch
face store for third-party watch faces
they didn't change anything drastic
that wasn't broken with the apple watch
so it's series six
for 2020 conveniently available for the
holidays
well played apple and that's pretty much
it for the review
like i said i'm going back to series 5.
either way
that's been it thanks for watching and
techtober
rolls on catch you guys very soon in the
next one
peace
