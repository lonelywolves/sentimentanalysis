all right what's up mkbhd here
and this is the new iphone 12.
it's the purple one so this was probably
the quickest announcement at apple's
spring-loaded event this april but
yeah here it is it's the same box as the
normal iphone
but purple and then inside it's the same
accessories
or lack of accessories and it's an
iphone 12
but purple
[Music]
so there's been a lot of colorful
products coming out lately so apple just
unveiled at the same event
their colorful new imacs they've got the
m1 chips and they've got seven different
colors now
they've got colorful keyboards and
colorful mice and colorful track pads so
now there's a purple iphone in the
middle of the cycle again so the classic
six to eight months post release new
iphone color to get it back in the news
cycle to get people talking about it
again
and it works so typically this was a
product red iphone they've had a couple
red colorways
drop six to eight months after the
newest model and product red stuff was
always this very deep
vibrant red and they were done in
collaboration with the red charity and
helped create donations supporting hiv
and aids treatment programs
around the world so why purple this time
well i can put a couple of clues
together first of all there already was
a product red iphone at launch time
second this might seem random but i was
told
that purple was steve jobs favorite
color
and actually i had to google it and
turns out if you google it
it still comes up that purple is steve
jobs favorite color and this actually
marks the 10th year
since he passed in 2011. so this could
be
some sort of tribute or a nice gesture
for that seems nice now there are a lot
of pastels in the smartphone world right
now it seems pretty popular
there's even a couple other light purple
phones
this iphone is kind of like a medium
purple it's definitely not
super deep it's not a bold purple at all
it's more of a
lilac more subtle reminds me very much
of the xiaomi mi 11 which had a totally
different texture
but same idea medium purple you know
what
here you wanna know the exact purple
color i'll give you a hex code
this is the exact color google that
pull it up on your screen give or take
how well your screen is calibrated
that is the new color of this new april
2021 purple iphone and holding it in
person it very much looks like this
the aluminum rails on the sides though
are slightly darker
just slightly but overall it's a pretty
subtle look
other than that i mean it's an iphone
12. there's there's also a purple iphone
12 mini so they'll both look
just like this no 12 pro or 12 pro max
but
everything else about this phone is the
same same cameras same hardware
same phone just purple so i can see the
comments already
oh most people put a case on their
phones so who really cares about a new
color
but they're on top of this already
everybody's on top of this so apple also
made
a new magsafe purple case it is uh
way darker way more purple but it's
launching alongside this iphone so you
can grab the purple case
for your current phone and it'll
actually look pretty nice i think it
turns out the purple case here
on the red iphone 12 has this kind of
cool
double layered look on the outside i
think that's kind of nice
but at the end of the day if you're
after this purple pastel look on any
phone you can always just skin your
phone so channel sponsor dbrand has you
covered and honestly they're very close
in color minus the reflections so i'll
link it below if this purple
really does speak to you videos like
this are pretty short
and simple some the question might
really be was this worth the whole video
and some would probably argue no most i
might even argue no
but at the end of the day when it comes
down to it people
care about new apple hardware and
specifically new colors of iphones more
than i ever thought
when you look at the view count of this
video
i mean you're watching it now you got
this far people actually care about this
stuff so
at the end of the day this video
probably helps to pay for
another better future free video
so that's a win this type of mid-cycle
refresh happens
like clockwork and if you're wondering
why i've already made
an entire video on this specific topic
i'll link it below
just about why companies do this six
months later
one new color of the same phone thing
and i did that video about three years
ago
when oneplus came out with a new red
version
of the oneplus 6. so this is not like
some new phenomenon so
purple purple is new and cool but new
color six months later
we've seen it before so i'll link that
video below like button if you want to
check it out so that's it it's a short
one so you can go enjoy the rest of your
friday
but even better we have a great sponsor
for this one all right now we got a
shout out to the sponsor of this video
skylum they make this pretty incredible
app called luminar ai and it's an image
editor
based heavily on ai artificial
intelligence
and that might sound pretty crazy at
first because it kind of is on the
surface but what that means practically
speaking
is a whole lot of really huge time
savers
and incredible functions just kind of
built right in with a single button
press so i've been messing around with
it a lot personally for instagram edits
recently it's kind of amazing for that
check out this photo at first glance it
looks pretty solid
right but the original photo unedited
shot on my iphone
is this and this is a very different
photo
and all the stuff the sky replacement
the re-lighting the color adjustment all
of this
took me a couple of clicks and maybe 60
seconds so there's all kinds of tools
you're probably used to seeing in an
image editor color temperature
exposure sliders all that fun stuff then
there's things like sky ai
which automatically detects where the
sky is if there's a sky in your shot
does all the masking work for you as
complicated as it is
and lets you drop in any of the skies
you want which you can then mess around
with with the sliders to make relighting
and filling in the gaps work perfectly i
happen to think sunset one looks pretty
good so that's what i had in my photo
and i think it came out pretty good
look it even added the part of the
matching clouds to the window of the car
like that is a sick before and after for
a quick
minute or two instagram edit and there's
a bunch more creative ai-based tools
that use 3d
mapping technology analyzing everything
in your scene in your photo to do as
much work for you as possible so look at
how these sun rays i'm adding
not only match the light of the scene
but reacts to the objects in the
foreground versus the background or in
this photo
the atmosphere ai lets me add fog and
sort of
mess with the depth of how it rolls down
the mountain all the way to the lake in
the foreground here let's play let's
play a little game right
i'ma show you a photo that i edited in
under 30 seconds and you tell me
what you think about that photo is
edited versus original so this photo
from hawaii
yeah that wasn't the sky at all it
looked a lot more dramatic in my edit
than the original photo
or how about this photo from matterhorn
yeah pretty much everything absolutely
massive white balance adjustment
corrections since the pixel that took
this photo kind of turned everything
blue
the sky the clouds i added over the
mountain plus a little film grain for
taste so that is
really cool that is super sick i'm glad
i found it i'm glad they reached out to
sponsors this video because i'm going to
continue to use this app for the future
uh instagram edits that i want to just
get done pretty quick like that
i'll have a link below if you want to
check it out if you use code mkbhd at
checkout you'll save 15 bucks
you're welcome all right thanks for
watching catch you guys the next one
peace
