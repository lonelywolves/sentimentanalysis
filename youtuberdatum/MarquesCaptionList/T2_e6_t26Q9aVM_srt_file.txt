all right
welcome to probably my favorite video to
do every year
welcome to the smartphone awards 2020.
so 2020 was of course a very different
year a lot of crazy stuff happened but
you know what
tech didn't really stop even events
didn't really stop we kept having
these virtual events and there was
constant new product announcements
there's more videos more reviews than
ever this year
and there's more shapes and sizes than
ever before on this table of 2020
smartphones
in front of me so that's why at the end
of the year we like to look back over
everything and give out some awards for
some of the best some of the most
interesting some of the most influential
stuff
that came out during the year it's
always like
late late during the year there's even
been other youtubers
putting on jackets sitting in front of
tables full of stuff and giving out
trophies to their favorite products
which
is actually kind of flattering i love
that that's actually a thing
that's happening now but this is it this
is the one you've been waiting for
let's say this is the smartphone awards
2020. so for those who are new here the
way we do this is
we've got a bunch of categories and for
each category there's going to be
a winner and then if there's any worthy
maybe a runner-up
and some honorable mentions but really
we'll focus on that winner
all the categories are time stamped
below if you want to skip around but
maybe just grab the popcorn sit back
relax
and enjoy the show so let's get right
into it
with the first category which is the
best
big smartphone so most phones are pretty
big
already nowadays but i like to reward
what i would call the best use of space
so if you're going to carry like a
genuinely huge phone you want it to have
the best use
of that extra space you've got to have a
big screen it's got to have a big
battery
and a lot of big features taking
advantage of that space
and there's a lot of competitors in that
category this year a lot of really big
phones but the winner overall for the
best big phone
of 2020 is gonna go to this guy
right here this is the xiaomi me 10
ultra so congrats to xiaomi on their
first smartphone award ever
they made an absolute monster phone this
year this was like the 120 phone
it had a 120x zoom on that camera
a 120 hertz display on the front and
120 watt fast charging included in the
box
that's the fastest i've ever seen in a
phone that's supposed to get you 40
battery in five minutes of being plugged
in which is ridiculous
and it's also got a bunch of other
high-end top-end features like
50 watt wireless charging it's got a 4
500 milliamp hour battery
half a terabyte of storage and pretty
much every other high end spec
you could imagine now they also made a
nice little
one of one mkbhd edition i don't know if
you can see that
that is pretty cool but also this phone
is only sold in china
so there's a little asterisk on that if
you have to import it to get it
that's maybe what you're into but there
are some runner-ups
that should definitely be recognized now
i think a no-brainer for this category
is also samsung galaxy note 20 ultra
another
huge phone with a lot of really big
features they fit the stylus on the side
of the phone again
4 500 milliamp hour battery huge camera
system
huge display and a notorious competitor
in the big phone category i'm also going
to give a shout out
a little mention to the asus where is it
on the table
the rog phone 3 oh no
i can't find it there's so many phones
here yeah here it is okay rg phone three
we already know this phone's got a
gigantic battery
it's also got a huge front-facing
speaker system which you really don't
see often in most phones this year
and so you have to give it props for
that if it's using the extra space
the way big phones should that's worth
recognizing
all right on to the next category all
right so next up
is the best compact phone of the year
this is kind of like the opposite so
most phones are big
it's actually kind of rare to see a
great compact
small flagship level smartphone
and so because there's still a market
for it we like to reward
when that's done well this one i think
is actually a little closer than you
might expect
but the winner for best compact
smartphone of 2020
is the iphone 12 mini so i feel like
this is the no brainer pick right
it's the same as all the rest of the
other iphones
but smaller so same cameras same display
tech
same chip same ram same software
same pretty much everything materials
just a smaller phone
so it's a flagship but smaller and
that's what this is all about
to some way it kind of represents a sort
of a little mini rebirth of this
category of compact flagships and
hopefully others will follow
there's people with small hands and
small pockets out there
give them a great phone they deserve to
have a small great phone now why was
this closer than you might expect
well there's actually a flagship
phone that came out this year on this
table in front of me
that's smaller than the iphone 12 mini
quick pop quiz you might be looking
around like what is he talking about how
is that possible
and that's the runner up which is the
samsung
galaxy z flip 2. this little guy right
here folded up
is obviously a much smaller phone than
when it's open but it is a compact phone
and it's so it's the big phone in a
small body theory it's kind of the whole
point of a folding phone and this
alternate form factor movement is
enabling things like this and the z-flip
2 was one of the most well-liked folding
phones
ever it has a normal aspect ratio when
it's open and it opens up to be a pretty
big phone actually
6.7 inches but when it folds down and
fits in your pocket or your bag it is
smaller than anything else
i love that and i'm really looking
forward to seeing other future
versions of this that'll inevitably have
even better specs
higher fresh rate display better
durability all that fun stuff so
gotta mention that z-flip two all
alright so cameras
we like cameras here so if you're
talking cameras
you want the best overall smartphone
camera
turns out there's actually a lot of
really good smartphone cameras on this
table here to the point where
the difference between them could come
down to preference
as we showed with the blind smartphone
camera test
but if you had to ask me if i'm going on
a trip
remember those if you're going on a trip
and you can only take one smartphone
camera for all of your photos and videos
there really is still just one winner
here
and that is the iphone 12 pro max
that is the winner for best smartphone
camera 2020. so look a lot of people
care about camera
the best smartphone camera of the year
this year just from its prowess across
the board with photos and videos and
versatility
goes to this highest end iphone and
they've reclaimed their crown it's just
hard to beat overall and i will say and
i've definitely said in the past i do
like some photos from some other phones
almost just as much and sometimes even
more than the iphone shots
but the iphone takes great editable
photos
consistently in the addition of pro raw
in the last few weeks with a software
update took it to another level as far
as image manipulation
and then in the video world the iphone
leveled up again they've always had the
best
video quality in any smartphone and now
there's more hdr options
better stabilization and a bigger sensor
in the 12 pro max so it's a no brainer
this is the best overall smartphone
camera package my runner-up shout outs
are going to be
first of all you might see this coming
as i've mentioned
the pixel 5 still often takes photos
that i prefer over the iphone's photos
and if i had to only take one for stills
photos
i would take pixel 5. so i definitely
want to mention that and i want to give
a shout out to the blind smartphone
camera test
winner for 2020 which was the asus
zenfone 7 pro if you watched that video
it was a bit of a surprise winner but
not so surprised
it's got a new triple camera system on
the back that just so happens to swivel
over
and become i think the best selfie
camera system
in any phone so shout out to those two
runner ups but we definitely have
a clear winner for the cameras which is
that iphone
all right best battery this should be a
pretty easy
objective award to give basically the
phone that nets you the best overall
battery life
is gonna win although this year there's
a little more to it there's some fast
charging to consider
there's charging technologies but
basically the winner here is going to be
the one that combines
the best battery with the best software
the best features and the winner is in
fact the thick boy himself
without even needing wireless charging
it's the asus
rog phone 3. this phone just
won't die so it's one of two phones i
tested this year with the biggest
battery i've ever held in a phone
6 000 milliamp hours and then the
software optimization was
on point i had no problem using it at
high frame rate mode 144 hertz
and getting two days of battery but then
of course you could clock it down to 120
get a little more you could clock it
down to 90 hertz
get a little more you could clock all
the way down to 60 hertz
and i never felt the need to do that but
if i did i would not be shocked if this
was a three-day phone
so major props to that sort of
modularity and the battery experience
but i'll also give a shout out to the
other phone i tested this year
with a surprisingly thin body and still
a six thousand milliamp hour battery
which is that poco m3 again fantastic
battery life
and you know not the same charging tech
as the fast charging in the rog phone
but then also another quick honorable
mention shout out to the samsung
m51 i didn't get my hands on it this
year it was released exclusively in
india but that phone dropped with a
7 000 milliamp hour battery and it was
somewhere under 500 bucks so
i haven't tested it but i'm pretty sure
that one would also be a battery chain
good looks all right the design award
so this is an interesting one we've
gotten a lot of interesting designs of
course
in 2020 and this is probably the most
subjective
highly competitive award on one hand
most phones
kind of look somewhat the same but on
the other hand they're all
very different in all kinds of color and
finish and material ways
this used to be just like the best build
quality straight up but then it went to
being my favorite overall design which
includes build quality
so for 2020 i don't know it was tough
i couldn't pick a phone that had a
mirror finish
i mean you've seen a lot of fingerprints
in this video already so i
i just wanted something that had a matte
option i couldn't pick a phone
that curved the screen too far over the
sides that's been something i'm not a
fan
of and i couldn't pick a phone that had
a really
ugly camera bump to my eye
but they kind of all have crazy camera
bumps so
anyway my design award for 2020
is gonna go to the samsung galaxy note
20 ultra so yeah this was easily the
most subjective award this year and i
think i could be
swayed to any number of the runner-ups
that i'm about to mention but
i was just a really big overall fan of
the hardware choices
that went into this phone this year
obviously the sweet satin finish on the
back
and this gold color i like it's pretty
sweet but also galaxy note has always
been pretty boxy which is my preference
they also flattened out the display on
the front so it doesn't curve over the
edges so much like previous samsung
phones
and of course it's now 120 hertz and
then with the cameras on the back
they added laser autofocus to fix the
issues with the s20 ultra
and it's a top-notch camera system of
course you might not like the bump but i
honestly didn't like
almost any camera bump this year so this
one hardly stuck out
from the others and at least it's stuck
in line with the boxy theme so yeah i
ended up landing on this
as my design award winner for 2020. i
was just drawn
a lot to the hardware of this phone even
though i'm not the biggest fan of
samsung
software i would just keep coming back
to wanting to use
this note 20 ultra so that's a great
design uh
but there's a couple honorable mentions
first of all i
have to give a shout out to my favorite
back of a phone
i think of all time which is pretty high
praise
but huawei p40 pro every time i pick up
this phone
it's got this nice soft touch back it's
this like iridescent
silver look to it uh i love the back of
this phone i wish
every phone had some sort of version of
this material
uh yeah it's great couldn't not mention
it and i also want to give a little
mini award there's no trophy for it but
a little mini award
to a new recognition for 2020
which is best hinge because hinges are
so important in all these alternate form
factors we had
swiveling we had vertical hinges we had
backwards hinges forwards hinges there's
a lot of hinges
happening on this table uh but my
favorite
hinge of 2020 is the one
found in microsoft surface duo
with the magnets and this thin form
factor this body
this it's for all the things this phone
didn't get quite right
the one thing they absolutely ace nailed
was the hinge and the weight of it and
this folding experience and
just for that reason alone i'm really
looking forward to the next version of
this thing
and then favorite crazy design just kind
of
you kind of have to give it the
recognition i don't even have it on this
table it didn't ship
it wasn't even a real phone but i'm
going to mention it anyway xiaomi mi mix
alpha
that thing kind of took it to the next
level this is the one with the crazy
wrap around display
like all right you want to start curving
the display around the sides of the
phone
let's just fast forward a couple years
and see what it looks like
with the screen wrapping all the way
around the back we got to actually see
what that was like this year and we
learned a lot from it so yeah lots of
great designs this year
like i said it was pretty subjective
could easily go to any others
that are maybe a little more subjective
to your taste
but i gave it to the one that i think
made the best most overall correct
decisions
all right best budget phone
of 2020 this category heated up
a lot i mean there's a lot of phones on
this desk here that really earn their
spot because of their price to
performance ratio
and you know everyone has a different
definition of budget for some it's a
certain price range
for me i want to reward a winner that
really brings a good amount of stuff
from the high-end expensive experience
down to a phone that's lower in price
that's what makes a good
budget phone for me it's got to be an
overall good experience for the buyer at
the end of the day
so the winner for best budget phone
of 2020 that's gonna be
the google pixel 4a this was
a killer phone it was kind of a surprise
hit actually that google found
with this a line starting with a 3a from
last year now you get the 4a
at 349 and it gets you that world-class
camera
the a1 google software experience for
android and
overall decently well-built phone for
literally less than half of the price
of a lot of comparables out there plus a
headphone jack it's really good
this turned out to be easily one of the
best phones to recommend anywhere under
400 bucks so that's quality my runner-up
is also a phone that was a budget
version
of an expensive line so again you're
seeing high-end stuff brought down in
price
and uh i'm gonna give a shout out to the
iphone
se solid runner up here so this was 400
bucks
and it was rocking the same world-class
chip the same spec as the flagship
iphones at the time
and the same familiar iphone software
experience but again decently well built
the design is a bit dated of course as
they move away from phones with
fingerprint readers but
you do get metal and glass here but they
did get rid of
the headphone jack and i feel like i
can't give
a winner of best budget phone to a phone
that got rid of the headphone jack out
of principle
but i do also want to give a quick shout
out to a runner-up
in the best budget space and that's
going to be oneplus nord
this phone was a little less of like
trying to bring something bleeding edge
from the top
down in price but more of being a
quality overall
budget experience so i think they made a
great set of choices
to keep price low but deliver a
consistently really nice phone
so a lot of people are going to like the
nord for that reason no headphone jack
on this phone either
but again solid bang for the buck but
like i said off the top it's really hard
to go wrong
in this category heat it up a lot you've
got the the moto g series the samsung a
series we've got the poco phones
there's a lot going on cheap phones are
getting good like i've said
let's keep that up okay so
biggest bust of the year the trophy
you hate to have to give but i don't
know there's always
something every year that feels like
you're rewarding
the ones that do good things and this is
sort of a slap on the wrist of
the bad stuff i mean you already know if
your phone's bad when it comes out but
we've had some
notable losers in the past winners
losers we had htc ultra you had red
hydrogen
you had pixel four this year
it goes to a phone that actually wasn't
that
bad of a phone it just had a horrific
launch strategy
and a terrible price you probably know
where i'm going with this
this is a samsung galaxy
note 20. this is the bust of the year
for sure now samsung is usually pretty
good at putting together a compelling
package for a smartphone at each price
point
but the note 20 launching at a thousand
bucks
seemed very out of character basically
launching it alongside the note 20 ultra
to kind of justify its higher price
but note 20 with its plastic back with
its 1080p
60hz display with its non-expandable
storage
like this phone was absolutely never
worth a thousand bucks
and it deserves the nope 20 title
couldn't recommend it now today you can
go on amazon and get this phone for
7.99 which is closer to about right
but yeah when this guy launched it was
definitely a miss
pretty uncharacteristic from samsung but
that's why it's uh the bust of the year
just never really landed also honorable
mention to the escobar
fold 2 which i also don't have on this
desk because it is in the possession of
the fbi someday i'll be able to tell
that story all right
most improved award mip 2020
and there's really only one phone if i'm
being real
that actually deserves this one see
phones typically
we get a little bit of an improvement
each year maybe a faster chip
maybe a little bit of a better camera
maybe it's got a little
refreshing the design you see some some
cool stuff year over year
but sometimes this most improved award
goes to
the biggest jump from a terrible phone
the year before
this is none of those things this is
just a straight up significantly better
phone than last year
let's just get to it most improved phone
of 2020
is definitely samsung galaxy z fold 2.
this is the epitome of 2nd gen games
generation 2 of a new form factor is
when you expect to see the most
improvement and samsung
definitely delivered that here huge
improvement on the front display going
from a candy bar
bezel afterthought to a real usable full
screen phone
and huge improvements on the inside
display going from a notched
slightly ugly setup to this thinner
bezeled notchless
120hz display that's just a joy to use
it's one of my favorite phones of the
year for sure
and it's a clear runaway favorite for
the 2020
most improved award but i do want to
give an honorable mention though
to a a phone that didn't really actually
get
better but you could argue delivered a
better experience
pixel 5 right so last year was pixel 4's
bust of the year pixel 5 turns around
comes back
gets you a same camera a
worse processor arguably and removes
some features
like project solely and the image
processing chip
but for some reason pixel 5 landed at a
sweet spot in price
and was just a more understood package
it didn't have to compete against the
crazy high-end ultra stuff
in the same way and for that reason i'll
give it a little recognition the phone
isn't necessarily
dramatically better than last year it's
actually worse
but it was much better marketed and it
landed the right way
good work so that brings us to our final
award
of the night the biggest award it's the
mvp
the big one uh this is drifting back
into
subjective award territory instead of
objective you know this could be
my favorite overall phone doesn't
necessarily have to be the one that puts
up the
biggest best numbers but it's the phone
that maybe had the biggest impact on
what happened this year it's the phone
that maybe was
the best overall combination of things
maybe it's the phone that was in my
pocket
but it's the mvp and it deserves to be
recognized to sort of represent the year
in phones
and so with that my mvp for
2020 smartphone of the year is going to
the samsung galaxy s20
fe the fan edition this is an award for
its impact on this new premium mid-range
tier that really broke out this year and
for
absolutely nailing it so when you look
back at this phone the way it launched
and the way it was reviewed it was
pretty quiet you know not super flashy
it's a samsung flagship launching
somewhere in the middle of their range
with a pretty nice feature set
right but now that we've sort of
collectively realized that this
awesome price category has gotten so
good this this premium mid-range like
700
thing happening you know iphone 12 drops
right in there
pixel five slots right in there one plus
eight eight pro
slot right in there there's a lot of
action at this new price
this phone with its spec sheet and its
features
is virtually indistinguishable from a
flagship
it nailed it this phone's 6.99 and it
has 120 hertz oled display
flagship spec and it's flat which is
great the phone has
a high-end triple camera system which is
great it has a snapdragon 865
a flagship chip and six or eight gigs of
ram that's awesome
and the phone has a 4500 milliamp hour
battery toss in
ip68 water resistance toss in 5g
toss in fast charging toss in wireless
charging
i mean it's complete really the only
thing you could complain about is this
back it's a plastic back
but it is a matte finish it's less
likely to shatter i think a lot of
people love to complain about plastic
but this had a couple new colors and
was actually a pretty nice
implementation of it this phone's launch
made the galaxy note 20
look stupid like this was an actual an
actual flagship killer more of a
flagship killer than
a lot of the other stuff that's claimed
to be over the years this was the
shining light
of this new premium mid-tier breakout
category of the year
and uh pretty much nailed everything
about it galaxy s20
fe well done i guess that's what you get
when you're
you have a samsung you know in this
whole
category they throw a bunch of stuff at
the wall to see what sticks
some of it really sticks in the form of
an mvp
some of it really doesn't stick in the
form of
the bust of the year but they have a
most improved they have all kinds of
stuff going on
but i don't know i think it all kind of
comes down to a lot is still happening
in the smartphone world and next year is
shaping up to be
well maybe even more interesting than
this year we get a lot of generation
twos next year we get a lot of potential
most improves next year
and uh with any luck we'll see a bunch
more matte phones too of course i do
like to give my honorable mentions
to the mvp category so i will mention
the phone that i have kept in my pocket
the longest this year which is the
oneplus 8 pro since it came out early in
the year this has been
sort of my steady phone that i returned
to
great camera system great battery the
only thing i really don't like about it
is this screen curving over the edges
but software experience
battery life wireless charging they
finally made a flagship
and it turned out great love that and my
iphone 12 pro
has been in the other pocket but yeah
that's
that's the smartphone awards for 2020.
so with that it's been an honor to be
your host for this year
enjoy the rest of your evening good
