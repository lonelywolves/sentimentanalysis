"For any brides who want to save money on a wedding but don’t want to compromise a lot of what you want, have a wedding in the off-season (November-March). My wedding is in January and We got half price photographer, discount on the venue and flexibility in times, discount on catering, free engagement photos, discount on video, and a free photo booth. All would have been pricey in the spring/summer! It was all very nice and some of it we wouldn’t have been able to afford in season. Because of all the savings, it is in our budget to afford more food and an open bar. I also recommend looking to see if any high end boutiques have off the rack dresses. I bought a beautiful long sleeved, hand beaded Justin Alexander dress that retails for $3,000...I bought it for $1250 because it was past season and missing some beading. It was in the size it would have been ordered for me and every dress needs alterations anyway. It was more unique and honestly prettier than every $5000-6000 dress I saw in the boutique.",Kassandra _,2020-08-03T15:43:56Z,1

This is so crazy. I was Youtubing wedding content as I am 11 months away from my wedding and this video was on a playlist. I remember Patrick from the Central Minnesota skateboard/Youth Shelter skate shop scene many years ago. Loved all your wedding and travel content that I have been binge watching all day today and immediately subscribed! Always happy to see fellow mid-westerners successful and happy! &lt;3,Brittany Habiger,2020-07-09T20:26:50Z,0

My brother got married at Frankie’s restaurant in Brooklyn in the backyard. It was very small but the staff managed to quickly change the ceremony area into an eating/reception area. There was not room for a buffet style dinner but they had sharing plates on each table like family style so it wasn’t like personal ordering nor buffet style. It was in the middle. I was surprised at how lowkey it was for a new york city wedding!! So There definitely is more affordable options if you live in the city!,jasmine,2019-10-15T15:54:46Z,0

"No shade, just a different opinion, but my husband and I didn’t spend a lot of money on photos, and they are still beautiful and provide great memories. We’ve been married for 4 years and have looked only some at them a handful of times, so I’m glad we didn’t spend a lot of money.

"My fiance and I are prioritizing venue, photography and food. Decor is also up there for me but I am a creative type so I know I can do that. I saved a TON of money by deciding to have my wedding on a weekday (we talked to pretty much everyone we&#39;re inviting beforehand and everyone was cool with it) and I&#39;ve learned that most vendors will give you a discount for a weekday wedding. I&#39;ve only gotten a few things but so far the photography has been the most expensive thing. These tips helped a lot! I&#39;ve been on the fence about having a sitting area and about a photobooth. I think I&#39;ll prioritize the seating area over the photobooth!",Amelia,2019-09-22T01:17:48Z,0

I did cake balls instead of a cake! My husband and I aren&#39;t really into sweets so a cake seemed too expensive and kind of inconvenient to cut up and serve. There was a local bakery across the street from our venue and we spent maybe $300 for 5 different flavors (which was nice for everyone&#39;s different taste) and a couple 100 cake balls. My husband was a granite installer at the time too so he made serving trays from the scrap granite at his shop. Definitely a fun alternative than a traditional cake :),DeeAnne Freeman,2019-09-21T15:24:19Z,0

But so looking forward to seeing our wedding video and all our photos! I will say that I saved a ton of money on florals... I spent less than $1,500 on all bouquets, boutonnieres, centerpieces etc.. bridesmaids had babies breath and that&#39;s it.. my bouquet was babies breath, greenery and some Silverstone roses..it&#39;s possible to save money and still have it look pretty!! xo",Jess Kopin,2019-09-20T19:52:14Z,0

"my wedding day was May 18th and the weather was PERFECT and sunny all week also, and even my wedding day was so sunny and beautiful AT FIRST, while we were all getting ready. We get to the venue, and it starts to sprinkle and our wedding is outdoors lol, so my ceremony had to be undercover instead of in the trees where I originally wanted it, then after all the photos and entering into the reception, it begins to STORM like CRAZY. everything was blowing all over the place, our glasses for the toast broke into pieces, and it was soooo bad. All of our guests left and we ended up having like 30 people left with us which was just family and the wedding party. Worst nightmare of mine seriously happened. I can&#39;t wrap my head around the fact I prayed so much for a sunny day and got a huge thunder storm instead haha soooo yeah thats my story with that!",Mikaela Gonzales,2019-09-20T18:32:07Z,0

The fact that you said you won’t use your YouTuber status to get your video faster is the reason why I have continued to follow you for the past like 6-8years. You are a real person who is kind and treats everyone with the respect they deserve. I’m a wedding photographer and I can’t say enough how many times someone has tried to use there status or justified getting my services for free simply because they are an influencer. I have infinite gratitude for the light and just shined on it ♥️♥️♥️ love you and congrats!,Jessi Lauren,2019-09-20T13:54:52Z,4

Yaye congratulations!! Can&#39;t wait to watch your wedding video. Weddings are so expensive. We saved a lot of money by not having limos and floral table center pieces. We used the bridesmaids bouquets to decorate the head table and also for the flower toss (this way I got to keep my bridal bouquet).

Photos were the most important thing to me. We found someone we thought was amazing. Ya we were kinda let down. They aren’t awful but meh. I also had emergency surgery 4 days before the wedding so all my pictures I’m sitting down and our photographer was rushing us to ‘be on time’ and I couldn’t move fast so I have barely any pictures 😑,Sam Cten,2019-09-20T04:50:27Z,0

Photo/videographers should be the HIGHEST priority (besides the venue) because it is the only thing that lasts way after the ceremony. That was my number one mistake I had before because we bought the basic package from the shadiest photo/videographers and I still don’t have evidence from the latter (and more important) half of the ceremony. 😅,lovely,2019-09-20T03:43:03Z,0

"I haven&#39;t watched the official wedding video yet but I&#39;m already crying with all the pics and the cuteness. Tess you&#39;re my favorite youtuber ever since the day one, and I&#39;m so happy for you and Patrick. You are truly meant for each other! It&#39;s weird how happy I can be for someone that I don&#39;t even know, but for me it&#39;s like we&#39;re friends and we&#39;ve been hanging out once a week for years. I&#39;m so proud of you and I truly appreciate all the effort you put into your videos and social media. I only wish you uploaded more often (maybe one vlog and one sit down video a week?) Haha but I understand how hard and how time consuming it is. So thank you for doing always you&#39;re best and staying so positive and not giving up on this. I hope you and Patrick the best, I&#39;m sure your love will last a lifetime (or even more). And I really hope to meet you some day.

I&#39;m a small YouTuber. I just started my channel. I was wondering if you could show some love and support for my small channel. We will be uploading a video every week as a starter. Your love and support would mean so much to  US. Tank you an advance. ❤️😍😀,J&K Adventure Vlog,2019-09-20T01:09:36Z,0
