"cow 🐄 print is innnnn. I have seen it everywhere, mainly magazines. I’m diggin it on small pieces, but I live in the south so it’s hard bc I see actual cow stuff that’s not meant to be trendy lolllll but if your not in the south I think it’s dope. Just like camo. I hate camo bc of the south.",Sarah Morse,2019-11-20T04:55:16Z,4

“the reformation coat is expensive” <br />me: <b>checks out the reformation sweater instead</b><br />me: oh,Maud Trenité,2019-11-19T00:03:44Z,315
I actually feel like the price for the jacket makes more sense than the price for the sweater since nicer jackets tend to be a couple hundred dollars anyway bur yeah i thought the sweater would be like $100 LOL,Faustine Yan,2019-11-19T15:59:41Z,11
"Maud Trenité Their stuff is made to last and the line of production is a lot more ethical than other fashion companies. (People get paid actual living wages to make the clothes, it is sourced from places that don&#39;t pollute the earth) I highly recommend watching the documentary &quot;The True Cost!&quot;",Mia Knoll,2019-11-19T01:44:03Z,47
