A nice warm Coco or milk like Ur armond milk before bed and pure  lavander oil .. just a tiny little dab either on Ur pillow in the four corners or on Ur temples rubbed in ... Pretty sure it&#39;s pregnancy safe but just double check but yeah should help U sleep alot better coz lavander relaxes the body and reveaves stress xxx,Fiona Doran,2021-03-18T17:47:05Z,0

I have the Nuna stroller and my daughter is 2.5 and she still gets use out of it but it was a god send when she was an infant/small toddler. I’d lay it flat and take her for a quick walk and she’d fall asleep so quick 😂 I’d leave her in it so I could clean or eat or work out etc hahaha such a good pick you guys!,DevilsAdvocate227,2021-03-01T02:08:49Z,0
Where’s the outfit from? 😍,Vitalina,2021-03-01T01:58:56Z,6
If it’s over 12 lbs you’re screwed with any stroller. Maclaren and a few other brands are truly the only way to go with New York train users. My mother has been a nanny for 20 years. Her bosses who’s children I baby sat is how I was first introduced to the brand. when I became pregnant in my 20’s I remembered it’s functionality especially for the train and its weight ... let me tell you best $230 I ever spent my daughter is almost 4 and we are still using the same one. Up and down those New York stairs 😭 thank god she walks now,An Afternoon With April,2021-03-01T01:53:40Z,135
"@Abbie Delores it’s not easy!!! If your baby is 10-20lbs you have to add the stroller weight if I struggled with a 12lb Maclaren I can’t imagine anything heavier. (Roughly 30lbs before baby can start walking &amp; Mind you I’m not petite and it was a struggle.)<br /><br />UPDATE: HOLY SHIT I JUST LOOKED UP THE WEIGHT OF THIS STROLLER it’s 26.8 lbs that’s damn near 30lbs once baby hits 15 -20 lbs no way she’ll be able to ever get on the train with that stroller and baby alone. That’s 50lbs you have to carry. I hope people keep liking my comment so they can see it, seems like they are going to rely on the train and they’ll need to get a much lighter option for when they do.",An Afternoon With April,2021-03-02T00:31:52Z,15
my first thought when I moved to NYC was &#39;how do those mamas do this&#39;. I was in shock seeing so many moms carry their strollers up the stairs by themselves. so much respect,Abbie Delores,2021-03-01T16:48:11Z,11
