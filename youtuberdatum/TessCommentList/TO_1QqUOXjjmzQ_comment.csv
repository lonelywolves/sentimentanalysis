They were my first concert in 2008 when I was turning 8 years old! I won the tickets off the radio station by singing when you look me in the eyes on the radio. And they were also giving backstage passes so I also met them😁 I’m now 18 almost 19 and it’s been 10-11 years since the concert and I’m wearing a shirt with the picture of me meeting them on it.

"Girl I LOVE Hanson, I&#39;m a little older then you, 30. My friend and I were obsessed with Hanson from 8 years old. They come to Toronto for concerts and we go to every one (usually once a year), last year she couldn&#39;t go so I took my husband and he enjoyed it!

"Ok I don&#39;t know what it is but you&#39;ve been especially funny in your videos lately. You&#39;re always funny but maybe it&#39;s because the whole Jonas Brothers fangirl thing is so relatable, I was laughing so much during this hahahah",Taylor Konop,2019-06-18T01:08:51Z,564

I saw them when they were just a local jersey band in 2006 when I was 14 and that will be the last time I’ll ever get as close as you guys did! And I’m seeing them in MSG too the day before I turn 27. My old YouTube is @JBhellobeautiful to see me 13 years ago freak out to the first time they ever performed hello beautiful ever,LittleAnnieA,2019-06-18T01:03:21Z,0
I was and still am obsessed with Jonas Brothers. I just went to the LA premiere for their documentary like two weeks ago. I was suddenly 16 again. Freaked out.,jacquelinelugo,2019-06-18T01:02:35Z,1
I was kind of a tween when Jonas brothers were in their prime. I was obsessed with disney channel and listened to their music a lot. I was still pretty young so i get what you mean by thinking they&#39;re cute vs. being convinced you&#39;ll marry them. That came later for me when I was 14 and convinced I would marry Louis Tomlinson from One Direction. On another note I love how down to earth and real this video is. Much love Tess!,Jocelyn Morrison,2019-06-18T01:02:11Z,2
my face hurts from smiling so much! literally grew up in love w them so I would&#39;ve passed out the moment they walked on stage being that close B Y E,alyssa michele,2019-06-18T01:02:05Z,45

"I feel like this year is an absolute throwback to 2008 and I’m LOVING it. The Jonas Brothers are timeless. Not some cringe phase we went through, but a phase we went through and are proud of to this day! 😂 Also, I’ve been following you since 2010! Isn’t it sometimes crazy for you to think that some of your followers have been watching you go through everything? (Vampire diaries phase, the time you went to England, one direction phase, then you got with Pat, now you’re engaged) 🙌🏻",Li Lo,2019-06-18T00:40:52Z,2
