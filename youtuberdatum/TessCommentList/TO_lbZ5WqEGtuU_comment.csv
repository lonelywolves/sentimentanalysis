Such a cool video but also kinda weird. Here in Germany it´s pretty common for the maid of honor and the other girls invited to the bachelorette to plan all the activities and to actually pay for almost everything including the activities for the bride &#39;:D it wouldn&#39;t be quite as bougie though,Serena Seninah,2019-05-30T07:31:25Z,0
