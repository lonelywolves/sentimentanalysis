"Fabletics in France have bad reputation!!!!. On the website it shows a lot of reduction for shoes ect, once you buy it they take money from your account each month around 50 euros. It happened to me, my niece and a lot op people.  They refused to pay me back and luckily i was refunded by my insurance... The method of Kate Hudson making money is not really clear to me.
