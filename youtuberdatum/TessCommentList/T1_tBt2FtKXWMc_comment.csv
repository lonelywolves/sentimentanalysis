"I’m happy you guys are appreciative of my transparency with prices. It’s what I would want to know before I moved here and from what I’ve seen, it’s the norm for the places and neighborhoods I was looking at. I guess you now know why I’m not one of those youtubers buying designer stuff all the time.... I’d rather live here. We are all crazy, but we all live here for a reason. It won’t be forever, but for now it’s all worth it :)",Tess Christine,2020-02-15T02:25:45Z,1453
@Tess Christine Totally get what you mean! Currently living in the most expensive city in my country but it&#39;s really worth it. I don&#39;t want to like in a small town right now maybe when I&#39;m older.,Yonghwa Jonghyun,2020-02-21T16:27:35Z,2

Can I ask what you pay for your current place? Thanks ♥️,Michele C,2020-02-16T04:02:20Z,0
I don’t think anyone wonders why you don’t buy designer stuff all the time. You and pat travel all the time and that obviously costs money. Plus it sounds like your are working on a new project(fingers crossed it’s a fashion line) and I know that costs money too. You and Pat like to put money back into your business and into your experiences. Nothing wrong with that!,Morgan Hill,2020-02-15T16:10:44Z,31
This video was amazingly helpful. Love that you included the actual rent prices. I&#39;m looking forward to hearing about your challenges with your current apartment.

"I’m gonna keep it real for anybody watching this video and thinking NY is anywhere near $4400 for a nice apartment... I’m not shitting on Tess or telling her she’s wrong, this is a good, informative video and I love her! But please be aware that if you look on Craigslist or Zillow or even Redfin, you can find places that are just as nice as these for much, much less. Without a broker and without the broker fees. I’m talking $3000 for the same exact apartment in a different neighborhood 20 blocks away. Even $3000 for rent can get you a whole lot in Brooklyn. Don’t get me wrong, NY is incredibly expensive. But you can get 3 bedrooms, 2 baths with laundry, a nice kitchen, a patio and all that for much less than what Tess shares in this video. Please be aware that she went through a broker and is looking in some of the most expensive neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Don’t let this deter you from moving or considering NY. Again, not cutting on Tess. She does well for herself and I’m sure this is super exciting, plus those apartments are beautiful! Just know that her method and explanation for apartment hunting reflects her spending power. And that’s great for her! But you can be just as happy in an apartment just as nice for a massive amount less. Like, thousands less. It’s doable! :)",Taylor Sellers,2020-02-24T02:02:14Z,2

"Tess&#39; video IS very transparent, but as a native Brooklynite, I must say that you CAN find cheaper two-bedroom apartments in different neighborhoods. Places with dishwasher and laundry included. It depends where in Brooklyn you happen to look and how many &quot;amenities&quot; you&#39;re looking for. Central and southern Brooklyn is less up-and-coming/filled with more natives than the areas she&#39;s looking at, and you can find 2 bedroom apartments for about half the cost of her range if you&#39;re willing to extend your train commute 10-20 minutes. Our market is definitely more costly in NYC than other cities, but there&#39;s a wide market available for different needs. Not taking away from any information she provided, just leaving this heads up for those people who aren&#39;t from NYC and think we all pay $4k for a one-bedroom.",damn3dxlov3,2020-02-16T22:24:57Z,0

"Thanks for the transparency Tess!<br />I always love these kinds of videos because it&#39;s so interesting to see how apartments vary in different countries. <br /><br />I&#39;m from Central Europe, where you usually own your own washing machine and bring it with you wherever you move, because every apartment has its own water supply / connection for washing machines (usually in old buildings as well - there are exceptions but it would lower the rent significantly). In big apartment buildings you also have an additional washer and dryer room in the basement. <br /><br />But we don&#39;t have built in closet space. You might get a walk-in closet in bigger and more upscale apartments  (and in newer built single family homes), but closets in the hallway and built in closets in bedrooms, we sadly don&#39;t have that for whatever reason. You just bring your own cupboard that has to be put in the room / hallway somewhere and takes away space. <br /><br />Gyms in the building are also non-existent basically. Doormen we don&#39;t have at all.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for showing us some NY apartments, I hope you find the right one for you guys :)",Kaitlyn,2020-02-15T10:08:11Z,0

OMG the prices!!! You could seriously get a huge house with a pool and a little bit of land for the price you&#39;re paying in rent. Crazy!!! I love NYC and get why you all love it. I do love to Airbnb in Brooklyn. Some super cute and fun spots. So glad you&#39;re back and ready for moving vlogs!,Camo Pug,2020-02-15T04:23:37Z,6
Move to Boston and you can get a 3 bedroom by the beach for those prices 😉 but excited to see which you and Pat choose!!,sophia liu,2020-02-15T04:03:28Z,2
"WOW!! I thought Austin was expensive - for these prices you could afford an apartment in the most expensive building in downtown Austin. I knew NY was expensive but was never actually told real numbers, thanks for sharing!",Sarah Reeder,2020-02-15T03:21:38Z,21
"Sarah Reeder that’s actually Brooklyn, imagine New York City (Manhattan)! For this prices it would be a “one bedroom” tiny ass kitchen, no washer and dryer. NYC is absolutely insane",Naomi,2020-02-23T02:01:13Z,0

"THAT BROWNSTONE is to die for, the dark issue i understand but there seems to be a good amount of light coming from the garden, the bug issue could be dealt with using a variety of products. <br />i want to move to new york one day it’s a dream of mine, i would be an ICU nurse somewhere so hopefully that salary would allow me to live there with a roommate",g Mon,2020-02-15T03:06:13Z,1

"Hi, why don’t you move to Westchester county or Long Island? You can whether get an apartment for literally half the price and bigger size or you can buy a house and your mortgage would be around 4K a month which makes more sense since you’d like to start a family. You’d have an easy commute to the city if needed. I live in lower Westchester and I love it! There are many apartments and houses that are older with ton of character which seems like you both love. I think it’s something to consider. Good luck! 😊",Michaela Block,2020-02-15T01:02:36Z,2

"I am so beyond appreciative of this video. I loved that you included the different neighborhoods that ppl could look up which is the hardest part imo, and I really really appreciate you including the price. I know ppl are always so &quot;secretive&quot; about price on youtube ( and I get it no one wants to be judged), but seeing the different costs helps create realistic price points and expectations for ppl.",camizzle222,2020-02-15T00:55:51Z,502

I don’t even want to imagine paying that much... omg. For that you can live in one of the more expensive areas of Austin. I really hope it never gets that expensive here 😭❤️ My home is changing so much though.",Lydianna Cirilo,2020-02-14T23:54:00Z,165

"farley 555 I know it’s been a few days but just seeing this comment! I agree, it’s a waste of money and a bad investment or lack there of. However, I think they just really want to live in New York and unless you have a ton of money or huge down payment, the price of the homes for sale in New York are too expensive to own for middle class Americans. Depends on which part of New York of course but it’s one of the most expensive places to live in the U.S. It seems they are making a sacrifice to live there and not own. Which is unfortunate as they talk of wanting to start a family. Least that was the case for me when I was younger and lived there and wasn’t thinking of the future. People also might rent if they have bad credit and can’t get a mortgage but I doubt that’s the case for Tess and Patrick. Hope you find this helpful! Sorry this response was lengthly. I could be wrong but it’s just my experience :)",Alexandra Riley,2020-02-28T16:27:00Z,0
