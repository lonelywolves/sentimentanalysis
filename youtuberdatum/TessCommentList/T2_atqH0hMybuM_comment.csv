"For whoever needs to hear this... it is super racist when white people treat cities as a playground in their 20’s, and then leave to actually own property and pay taxes in the suburbs. This is called white flight. You can’t be okay gentrifying Brooklyn and then skip out bc it’s too expensive to own property there now. The reason it’s too expensive to own property there is bc of 20 yr old white people who drove the actual community out to build their hipster paradise.

Also, 1 1/2 bathrooms, two coat closets and a walking closet + that entry space is just too dreamy! I wouldn’t move out unless I’d have a kid and would actually need the space!

"Seriously! I absolutely HAVE to know. It looks amazing and so comfy! It reminds me so much of the ever so popular, &quot;Cloud Couch&quot; from Restoration Hardware that every other youtuber has. If I&#39;m not mistaken RH doesnt sell exclusively just the sectional size that everyone usually has, I do believe they sell this same 2 seater size just like the size of Tess&#39;s couch. I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m positive her couch is from RH but I am saying it could most definitely pass as a doupe for it though. So if she doesn&#39;t end up disclosing where she got her couch specifically then you can always check out the one I listed for you. Although... I will not lie, it&#39;s not the cheap option, it&#39;s definitely an investment piece that&#39;s for sure lol <br />☁️♡♡🌿♡☁️",madison kempkes,2020-07-31T19:18:21Z,1

Dorothy Nunes well yeah . But here for example there can be a 3 bedroom apt which is very beautiful for about $3k-$4k in east Flatbush which not many people would move in to because its considered not the safest neighborhood.

"s_ienna well I live New York and the prices aren’t so bad. Really depending what type of neighborhood, crime rates, what’s around like if it’s next to the beach and trains / buses are nearby it will be more expensive. If it’s further where you have to walk like 15 min it will cost less. Renting a studio would be around $1000 more or less, one bedroom can be up to $2000, etc etc",Alina Malik,2020-08-19T06:34:00Z,1
