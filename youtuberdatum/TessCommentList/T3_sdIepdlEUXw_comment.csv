"Tess, for what it’s worth (and not much, because it’s totally your personal decision!) I could not agree more with your thoughts around what you choose to share and not with your little one, Patrick and your future family in mind. Each to their own. Huge, huge respect.

Suggestion for your nursery - get an air purifier. They run for around $200-$300 on Amazon and they&#39;re completely a game changer for baby!! Helps with breathing and cleans the air which is especially important now that we have covid!! Much love &lt;3,Ellie Elle,2021-02-16T14:57:09Z,0

I’m so happy about the baby video boundaries you’re setting! It always makes me a bit uncomfy when influencers profit solely off of their children (unless it’s super helpful).

"I’m not even an influencer or anything and i kept my entire pregnancy private between like my close family and friends (and obviously everyone at my job LOL) but other than that no one knew until i actually had my baby, also i rarely update pictures of my daughter even now and she’s 2 next month, i have a group chat and a private instagram account with my close family and friends that i post pictures. like the second i found out i was pregnant i knew i wanted it to be kind of just between me and the people i care about",Justyce Thibault,2021-01-24T07:39:15Z,0

I love your stance on the topic you adressed in the beginnig. I‘m also not hating on the one‘s that decide to do it that way. I also sometimes on occasion like the videos. <br />But i sometimes feel like it turned toxic and a bit ... hm i don‘t know the word 🤔. Sometimes it feels like the demand on the child isn‘t taken seriously &amp; the pregnancy is „used“ for views etc...,Ella,2021-01-23T09:26:00Z,0

"I love the way you are planning to share your pregnancy but want to keep some things private and still keep doing the kind of content that you like 😊 I think it&#39;s a great way to do this and I totally respect the fact that you want to keep some things just between you and Patrick or your family! <br /><br />I would love to keep seeing your styling videos but with maternity clothes! I just gave birth in the beginning of January so they are not gonna actually help me but I&#39;d still love to see! And if you choose to and manage to breastfeed, I&#39;d love to see some clothing tips for that aswell in the future (I really really hope this doesn&#39;t offend you or anyone, it&#39;s your choice completely how you want to feed your baby and either way is just as good but just something I&#39;d personally find really useful ❤️).",Sonja Havukainen,2021-01-21T13:15:04Z,0
Im so excited for you but even more pumped that you are deciding to keep your identity as you TESS!

Shouldn&#39;t you disclose that your links are all referrals that you are getting commissions out of all the clicks and sales?<br /><br />That&#39;s the thing with influencers.

"I respect your decision and am personally a bit relieved! I&#39;ve enjoyed your videos since your college days and I was a bit worried there would be mostly baby content and nothing of &quot;Tess and Patrick&quot;. I find too much baby content makes me feel weird about the child&#39;s privacy and personally choose not to watch much of it. Also as a childless person, I feel a bit disconnected, and I miss seeing their personalities as an individual. I&#39;m happy there&#39;ll still be funny content from your wonderful friends too!!",Forever77Young,2021-01-20T03:23:34Z,2

No one has the right to be intrusive in such a beautiful and private time in your lives whether you’re an influencer or not.This whole generation of needing to post absolutely everything for views and comments is so mentally exhausting for everyone involved.

Not gonna lie, at first, I was like “but wait, whyyy?!” 😫 I wanted the water works, the cool guy breaking down, or hyperventilating.

"Im pregnant myself (first time) and as someone who&#39;s very private I understand you wanting to keep some things for you and your family. Baby videos are fun to watch but it&#39;s not upto us to decide, you guys are the parents and as first time parents there will be a lot going on and it will be life changing obviously so no one has a right to demand stuff, you do it on your own way. Soon you&#39;ll be a cute family of 3 and as a mother you have all the right to keep your work and family seperate.",Demiii,2021-01-18T23:59:29Z,0

You know how to keep your space for yourself, calm and unproblematic and in the same time-sharing and involving us in it.

Random Mommy tip!  In the beginning you&#39;re teaching the baby the difference between day and night for good sleeping habits so as tempting as it is to black out the room for naps it might be beneficial to keep it bright for naps just because you might have better luck getting them to sleep through the night earlier!!

I love you view on this topic. I wish you a healthy pregnancy and baby ❤️",jona,2021-01-18T14:24:20Z,4
"Thank you so much for sharing your opinion on the whole pregnancy content thing! I LOVE that you respect you baby&#39;s privacy and yours, it&#39;s so refreshing and kind and just... I admire you for this. I can&#39;t help but feel bad for those babies that have 100 videos of them made by the age of 1. With their first step, first poop, first burp, first word etc. I feel like some youtubers are profiting over their children and that&#39;s just so wrong.",Olesya Sachenko,2021-01-18T14:13:55Z,0

I really respect your choice about not turning into a baby channel. I find it so weird/scary when people post mostly about their kids who are minors and cannot consent. Some here and there? Sure. But not using them as your platform,Kristiana Noel,2021-01-18T14:01:45Z,0

"Honestly so happy with your comment about the trend when the pregnancy comes, because, at least for me, it looks so.. superficial? when youtubers share everything of the baby but in small videos, makes them empty, like the only reason for making them is purely to make content, which idk... doesnt feel natural to me. Idk... personal opinion only.",Estefanía R,2021-01-18T13:51:58Z,0

"Your commentary on the beginning, I totally agree! That&#39;s why I enjoy your content so much because I feel like throughout everything you always stayed true to yourself and what you wanna share, not what maybe brings the most views. I&#39;m more excited for pregnancy fashion videos or in generall helpful videos than having 10 videos on how everyone reacted where I probably wouldn&#39;t know half of those people anyway. I totally respect your decision and would act the same! Also I&#39;m excited for the backyard roses spring launches!!!!",byhanna,2021-01-18T13:45:52Z,0

I’m from Kentucky and when I was pregnant with my daughter i only got 2 ultrasounds throughout my whole pregnancy.. the first one to confirm you’re pregnant at like 8 weeks and then another to confirm the gender.. that was all they had me do because I wasn’t a high risk pregnancy.

By the way, this is my personal opinion but I’m glad you’re not entirely transforming your channel and exclusively talking about your baby. I’m so happy for you and Patrick, and I feel so privileged that I will be able to follow you through your pregnancy, but I love your usual content so much (vlogs, haul, home decor) that I would be sad if it disappeared 😉 I’ve been following you for so many years I can’t even recall !!

"Open shelfs are to be easy accesible for the child, to alow them to explore their interests. <a href=""http://def.do/"">Def.do</a> add couple more lower.<br />Babies recognize colors at stages so at first stick to Black and white/high contrasting design books. <br />Regarding light, at first use the lamp, not above the crib, or add the  &quot;baldachin&quot; or &quot;himmel&quot;, which will help with decor too. <br />The comfortable chair is a must, alhough you will need something to elevate your feet.<br />I would highly recomend exploring the Montessori way.<br /><br />Congrats to you both, to all family and friends too!",Ivana Erenda,2021-01-18T11:18:54Z,0
Here in Germany they released a rule in the beginning of the year that you only get three ultrasound pictures. Our health insurance pays for them - it was normal to buy a package with 20/30 ultrasound pictures for your pregnancy if you wanted but now we don‘t have this option anymore. Only if your pregnancy is at risk you will get more ultrasounds of course!,zwergen.wunsch,2021-01-18T11:17:11Z,0

I don&#39;t know how this will sound but I 100% agree with you with not showing everything or too much or every step of the pregnancy journey. I follow other influencers and as soon as they become pregnant their content changes and videos change and that&#39;s fine but it&#39;s not what I initially subscribed to them for. So I absolutely love that you will keep things private and still be yourself and create the content you always create just with a few drops of baby related videos which I think is such a great idea and refreshing and not overwhelming for both you and the viewer.,Sinem Salih,2021-01-18T10:20:21Z,7

"Honestly I understand and appreciate that you are making a conscience decision to monitor what is shared of your baby and pregnancy.  Congratulations on your new addition by the way. But my opinion is this is a deeply personal subject and you should do what you want and what feels right for your family. And not worry about what you think you SHOULD do. But I do want to suggest an  update on the usefulness of the changing table.  Maybe its a personal preference of my family immediate and extended, but the consensus is just change them on the floor, bed, or wherever you can wrangle them. So maybe its good you got one that is also a dresser. Just a thought on what might be useful to other moms in future videos.",Jennifer,2021-01-18T08:21:32Z,0

It’s sad that she even had to make a comment regarding what she will and won’t post that’s completely up to her what she wants and doesn’t want to share. 🤍 so much love for you guys!,Maria,2021-01-18T05:03:51Z,4
You look glowing and beautiful! And your little bump is so cute!,Amy Staahs,2021-01-18T04:42:04Z,0
AMEN! I LOVE that you’re not wanting to share everything with everybody. That is such a nice change of pace and I love that you’re willing to give this baby (and you two of course) as much privacy as you want and need. It’s a shame that you have to have this little “disclaimer” and that people can be pushy but it’s awesome that you’re doing your own thing. Kudos to you! Just thought I’d add my little comment among the sea lol.,SuttontheButton17,2021-01-18T04:40:55Z,1

"I loved what you said for not allowing yourself to show the baby if you don’t want to and YouTube I was watching a couple days ago Samantha Marie if she was saying that my daughter is not your property to demand any kind of content from in general so you can what you get and if I show something, I show something but she’s not your property to ask that from her or from me. So I really like that you said that and that you have already said that before she was even born or he’s a big born.",A GYPSY GOLDEN,2021-01-18T04:32:27Z,0

Don&#39;t overthink it or put too much pressure on yourself worrying about others expectations, you have every right to your privacy and keeping special moments personal and everyone who is watching for the right reasons understands that. This is such a big exciting new chapter and were lucky to follow along and get whatever entertainment and tips you offer along the way.

"It’s so exciting to watch you two grow! I’ve been watching your videos for years. Even before we were trying, incessantly, for our first baby. It took 2 years to finally get pregnant with him and he’s now just about 9 months old. I also have a baby girl on the way now. Becoming parents is the best experience ever! Enjoy every moment. Even the hard ones... when you’re exhausted, stressed, and crying with your baby. You’ll miss those days, ironically. Congratulations!",Cheryl,2021-01-18T04:00:16Z,0

"Wow Tess. Hats off to you for acknowledging that pregnancy isnt rainbows and sunshine for everyone. I had a stillbirth and I was lucky enough to go onto having a beautiful daughter, but the second pregnancy was completely hidden. Only a few people knew. It was terrifying and a very isolating experience. I appreciate that you arent going to do 1000 pregnancy videos, as that may be the tipping point for some of your viewers. You are such a good soul xx",Nav Taggar,2021-01-18T03:35:48Z,1

I totally respect your decision to share your pregnancy your own way. I think people wanted to see Patricks reaction because he is very expressionistic (if that is even a word LOL) and fun and I can only imagine his face and his excitement. Congratulations on expecting your little one. Keep doing your channel your way. You are a wonderful couple and soon to be family of 3. Enjoy every moment!,Sara Onsen,2021-01-18T03:14:19Z,0

There’s moms that don’t use gliders! I have 2 kids and and I still use it daily even though they are no longer babies. It’s where we read books or they snuggle up and play quietly. It was my best purchase hands down.,Shannon Anne,2021-01-18T02:53:31Z,0
"Curious if you and Patrick plan on raise your child long term in the city? I know you both grew up in the midwest and I wonder if you will want your child to live in a place they can have neighborhood friends, play outside...I understand these things are possible to some extent in a city. But the ability for kids to run free, play in their own yard, ect.",Becky Riesinger,2021-01-18T02:53:09Z,1

Even women who are not you tubers feel like they have to share so many things about their baby on social media and with friends and family. You just have the best head on your shoulders.

"I never comment on videos but I have to say you have such class, Tess. You and Patrick both actually. Incredible. I have so much respect for the two of you.<br />I don&#39;t really follow influencers (or people in general) unless I personally know them but for some reason I started following you when we were both babies basically (we pretty much are the same age) and I feel like you have stayed so humble and have become classier year after year. I adore your view on the pregnancy and completely support you and Patrick in this. It&#39;s exactly what I would do in your position. <br />I don&#39;t know you, yet I feel I can really say you&#39;re gonna be amazing parents. I&#39;m so happy for you guys, you deserve all the happiness in the world.<br />Also Backyard Roses is exactly my taste and I&#39;m so in love with it, you&#39;re an amazing entrepreneur among all the other things. Incredible woman 👑",Silvia P,2021-01-18T02:41:51Z,14

"this is why you are and have always been my favourite influencer on Instagram/YouTube. This pregnancy is so exciting, but it’s so amazing to hear you say there’s already a lot of expectations on this baby and they’re not even here and that you don’t take this for granted. <br /><br />I think it’s really important you’re setting boundaries and expectations early on.. Not only do you want to cherish special moments with you and Pat but you’re one of the few influencers I’ve watched who has ever even MENTIONED the privacy of your child and what they might or might not want shared to thousands of people. <br /><br />As a viewer who is far off from having kids, it’s great to see that your channel won’t be littered with pregnancy and baby stuff all the time, even if it is a part of your life!   You are not just a soon to be mom -  you’re still a woman,  a partner, a kick ass businesswoman, a friend, a fashion ICON. Now you’re a mom too. You’re still you and I’m so glad your channel will reflect that because it’s the reason so many of us have been here since the start.   Sending so much love! Can’t wait to see the little one xx",Abby Tait,2021-01-18T01:41:15Z,22
What you said about not following this template people have on YouTube is SO REFRESHING! NO hate to those who do it but I genuinely love seeing you just do you ❤️ not showing Patrick’s reaction shouldn’t be such a big deal. I know my husband as well and he’s such an intimate personal person that he wouldn’t want his reaction out for the world to see ❤️<br />P.s. I’m a silent follower but thought I would write this just because ♡ been following you since college and I’m excited for you and Patrick! Congrats again on your little one 🥰,Meghan & Alex,2021-01-18T01:40:22Z,469

"I actually really respect YouTubers who refrain from showing their kid&#39;s face or even sharing their name on their platforms. not saying this to judge you if you do share your baby on your social media! but I do think that it is amazing that you are already taking their online presence into account before they are born. I think sharing certain aspects of pregnancy and motherhood is super helpful for other momma&#39;s out there, but it can definitely be done without oversharing your little one&#39;s personal information/attributes/milestones. I&#39;d imagine it would be difficult to refrain from fully showing your sweet little babe, but I think it could save a lot of potential hurt that may come down the line if parents with a large following limited the amount of information and video/photo footage that they share about their baby&#39;s life, especially when they are too young to decide for themselves.

Its understandable on why you want to share certain things. Parents just want to protect their little ones. No one should be getting mad. Wishing you a safe pregnancy tess. ❤,Jeanette Tinoco,2021-01-18T01:05:03Z,25

"Your vision for your baby’s nursery is so beautiful! I’m excited to see it all come together! 😍 <br /><br />And regarding your decision to pick and choose what to share about your baby, I totally understand and respect you for that. I hope other people will respect that boundary as well. Wishing you a healthy and happy pregnancy journey! ❤️",Mymy Tran,2021-01-18T01:03:51Z,0
THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY😭🤎,Jessica Lauren,2021-01-18T01:00:34Z,2
"Also, I totally respect what you were saying about posting content with and about your baby. It&#39;s important for you all to have some privacy! I (and a lot of other viewers) appreciate whatever your choose to share.",Lauren,2021-01-18T00:58:57Z,183
"As long as you’re happy and healthy, do you girl! Your videos are awesome &amp; people who think they can boss around a creator when it’s their channel- are trash. All the love &amp; good vibes to you and pat!!!",Rai Petty,2021-01-18T00:58:16Z,2
"when I say you are glowing, YOU ARE GLOWING! I know that every pregnancy is different and it can be very hard (I have yet to experience it) but it’s such an incredible beautiful thing that our bodies can do! I’m so excited for this video, and to follow this journey! I work in a nursing home and it’s very stressful and sad with cases rising and coworkers and residents getting sick. So it great to come here and watch this video for 20 min to escape! Thank you! You’re beautiful girl!🤍🤍 love you!",RaeAnne Mummert,2021-01-18T00:57:53Z,0
Your a strong good momma already!,Joanna Malak,2021-01-18T00:57:22Z,0
I love your stand point on sharing. Not saying its better than how other people choose to share. Its definitely something you want to put thought into when sharing one of the most important things in your life.,Maddison Cotter,2021-01-18T00:57:17Z,0

"I hate how entitled some influencers viewers act, and feel like just because they click on their videos that they deserve to be invited into private moments in their life. I thought it was really classy how you explained your reasons for wanting to keep some things private, and it makes me sad that people would even come at you for that.",Kat Flores,2021-01-18T00:56:57Z,1385
"Agree 💯 %!! <br />I love the fact Tess is honest with us and has explained what she wants to share but honestly a part of me thinks why should she have to do so, like you said it’s her pregnancy and it’s up to her and Patrick so for some viewers to demand otherwise is really unreasonable and entitled.",Sarah Says,2021-01-18T13:02:35Z,3
You really said that well! Exactly how i feel about that!,M. A.,2021-01-18T12:51:29Z,3
Couldn’t be happier for your little family to be growing 💛 I have loved following along with you through the years and wish you nothing but the best! ✨,Haley,2021-01-18T00:56:36Z,4
"I totally agree with everything you said about the privacy of your baby and the content of your channel, I think it&#39;s way more authentic to you and better for everyone!! Your life is such an inspiration for me, I can&#39;t wait to see how the nursery turns out :)",Alison Kyle,2021-01-18T00:54:31Z,8
"I&#39;m excited about your approach for minimal baby content. Some channels completely shift to that and that&#39;s not really what people subbed for. Obviously people grow up and expand, but I&#39;ve admired what some YT mom&#39;s have done with just including baby-related stuff in vlogs, but not having it be everything. I think you&#39;ll balance it well!",Jordy Reviews It,2021-01-18T00:53:26Z,198
I absolutely love your baby content approach! 😍,Martha,2021-01-18T00:53:23Z,1
"These are so fun, real, and I hope everyone can respect you when it comes to what you will be sharing. It&#39;s your channel and your pregnancy and do whatever you have to do to keep it 100% you!!",Kerri Conti,2021-01-18T00:52:00Z,72
I think the comments on the number of scans may have been due to the fact that in some countries like in UK for example you only have 3 scans during the whole pregnancy unless there&#39;s something wrong with mom and/or baby then they may add couple more,silverbeb4e,2021-01-18T00:51:52Z,5

"(1) I really feel like you guys are having a boy, idk why. <br /><br />(2) Did you guys move before or after finding out you were pregnant?",Skylar Pye,2021-01-18T00:48:31Z,9
I think she said in a precious vlog or on Instagram that the prompt to move was finding they were expecting but don’t quote me on that,Chloe Smith,2021-01-19T08:01:22Z,0
