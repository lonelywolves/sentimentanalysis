im wondering why... if the demand is CLEARLY so overwhelmingly high... there can&#39;t be just a full restock? i&#39;m so bummed i didnt get to order anything..  is it because all the pieces are meant to be super limited edition? I guess lesson learned that i need  to set an alarm for the next launch lol,Alexa Cardenas,2020-09-08T16:56:37Z,1

"I&#39;ve been a fan of Tess for YEARS. I&#39;ve been watching her channel since she used to film her videos on her parents&#39; backyard. However, I can&#39;t help but notice that her IG page for Backyard Roses lacks diversity. There is literally only one POC girl featured on her IG page while the rest are a bunch of white girls. Even the girls she sent PR packages too are white. This baffles me considering the fact that she&#39;s been so advocate for racial equality yet her clothing line mostly features white girls. SOOOO disappointed. You cant preach about racial equality while simultaneously creating a brand that mainly targets/showcases white girls. I am aware that the model on BR website is POC, but that still does not change the fact that her brand LACKS DIVERSITY. Put your money where your mouth is and stop with the performative activism.",Saoni,2020-09-07T02:04:39Z,2
