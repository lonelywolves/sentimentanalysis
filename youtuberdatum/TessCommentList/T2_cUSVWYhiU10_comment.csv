"Thanks for watching! As shown in the video, I know what it&#39;s like to have annoying breakouts and feel your pain if you are struggling with it. I have been doing this nighttime skincare routine for over a year now and wouldn&#39;t be mentioning these products if they haven&#39;t been consistently working for me. I hope this helps you in some way! Sending love!!",Tess Christine,2020-07-29T19:23:06Z,196

Did you by chance get on any type of birth control during this process or change your birth control? I ask because birth control plays a huge part. I had bad cystic acne and got the birth control implant Nexplanon and it completely took away all of my acne.,CindyRose,2020-07-30T20:57:26Z,1

"You should really try using natural/organic skincare. Not only is it better for the environment, but it&#39;s better for your health in the long term. There are a lot of misconceptions about natural brands and products because of the lack of real information that is being presented to the public. Natural ingredients are incredible and can be extremely powerful and effective if used correctly and safely. There&#39;s a reason why they&#39;ve existed for centuries in alternative medicine etc. The problem with using synthetically made products (which accounts for the majority of products in the industry), is that in the short term they may be safe to use, but there is scientific evidence that in the long term a lot of the ingredients can be carcinogenic (having the potential to cause cancer). The reason why labs make synthetic versions of natural ingredients is because the molecules in the natural ingredient is often too large to penetrate the skin to a deeper level, hence it may not be as effective. And most people are looking for a quick fix. So in order to compensate for this, they create a synthetic version where the molecules are much smaller. However, because they are smaller it means that they are so small they actually enter the bloodstream. Now imagine spending 50 years putting these synthetic chemicals on your face and it being absorbed into your blood... I know that ever since I started using natural skincare, the thought of that freaks me out. <br /><br />*I can speak about these things because my mum is a qualified natural skincare formulator and has spent the past 2 years researching natural ingredients and the science behind how the skin works etc.<br />**I would also avoid using Malin &amp; Goetz because some of their products are extremely unstable and unsafe. My mum used one of their products and now has a permanent scar on her face. There were a tonne of negative reviews about this particular product that they &#39;conveniently&#39; neglected to show on their website and the product was never recalled. It&#39;s disgusting how far a company will go just to make more money, even if it&#39;s putting people&#39;s health at risk. <br />***Try and avoid using products that have fragrance or alcohol in them (quite a few of the products you&#39;re using) because alcohol can really dry out your skin and synthetic fragrance is an irritant. The reason your skin is going red when you use the toner is probably because some of the ingredients in it are irritating your skin. <br /><br />Hope this informed someone x If you want to know more, let me know! I&#39;m happy to share the information.",DAHLIA,2020-07-30T07:53:01Z,1

Thanks for sharing! I&#39;m currently using tretinoin to help with my scarring from past acne issues. Have you tried The Body Shop&#39;s Chamomile Cleansing Butter? It&#39;s similar to Clinique&#39;s Take the Day Off,Flor De la Mora,2020-07-29T19:45:27Z,1

yoooooo I am so glad I am not the only person who wondered this too!,Annie Oliver,2020-07-30T14:14:43Z,8
The Body Shop has a cleansing butter that is similar to clinique&#39;s and it&#39;s cruelty free :)!,Anna Zoe,2020-07-29T19:41:26Z,136
BeautyCounter makes one that is cruelty free and fragrance free! I switched to it from Clinique and it’s way better!,Kassandra _,2020-08-05T01:31:55Z,4

I’ve been watching you since you were in your college house! It’s so nice to see how much you’ve grown but also stayed so grounded + humble 💖,puppers mcfluffers,2020-07-29T19:38:56Z,9
The thing that helps you the most are probably those pads with salicylic and glycolic acid that unclog your pores and exfoliate your skin.,solange,2020-07-29T19:38:52Z,25
Mollie it’s probably a combo of the two since exfoliation is essential to anyone’s routine to clear skin and the pads are professional strength.,Kassandra _,2020-08-10T15:21:21Z,1
"No it’s definitely the curology, considering they are prescription products and much more effective",Mollie,2020-07-30T04:53:18Z,1
