"Tess, I have been a long time follower of yours and I just have to say the equal balance of love and support between you and pat is something I have adored. When you explained feeling recharged &amp; getting to take your skills out of a “work-place” sort of feeling you explained how it was great getting to see pat use his skills differently, seeing him challenge himself in a different environment for a different purpose. It wasn’t about you just going somewhere new for youtube content. It was a trip that allowed for beauty &amp; opportunity but was stressed on needing footage for youtube per-say. his support of you &amp; your career is incredible too, but I just wanted to say it’s refreshing to see the “youtuber” understand that these moments exist beyond needing content for the internet. You didn’t have to make this video but you did for yourself, your memories, and for us to see some beauty we might not have before but you didn’t force anything. thank you, to you &amp; pat for always being so down to earth to watch.",star fallow,2019-04-29T02:47:08Z,0
