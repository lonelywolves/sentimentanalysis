I wish you would talk more about money in your travel videos. Obviously you live a very nice life but it would still be helpful for budgeting. <br /><br />I’m sorry to hear you dealt with a lot of stuff in 2019. I had a rough 2019 as well. I had a stroke in August and it was a lot to deal with. I’m so happy it’s finally a new year(and decade!). Hopefully we both have a great 2020.,Morgan Hill,2020-01-07T03:49:35Z,2

"Omg Tess so glad your back!! Glad you enjoyed your time away though too :) If I could give any encouragement for you and your channel this year, it would just be to go for it - any videos you&#39;ve considered not doing for whatever reason, just go ahead and post them if they make you happy and YOU like the content. For me personally, even if a video might be a bit different from what I&#39;m used to, if the creator of the video likes it and is truly enjoying themselves, it makes it SO much better because you can tell they put a lot into it, rather than just doing something simple that may be more fitted to viewers&#39; tastes but doesn&#39;t make you as the creator, happy or proud of what you made. I can also say that personally, I just love your personality so more often than not, it doesn&#39;t matter what the video of yours I&#39;m watching is about, I just watch it because you&#39;re in it :))",Lily Waddell,2020-01-06T22:34:21Z,0

"only halfway through the video but i had to comment, i cant wait for your announcement this year im so excited!! i have loved your channel for years and am obsessed, so whatever you produce i will love! maybe some ideas for your channel could be more advice videos with the ladyspeedsticks! that video was so helpful and entertaining at the same time. i also love your style so any NY look books are my fave type of videos! &amp; i appreciate you not being involved in the drama, it is mature and so so refreshing.
