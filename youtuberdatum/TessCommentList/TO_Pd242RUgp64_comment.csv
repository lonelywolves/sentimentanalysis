I had the same issues growing up. It&#39;s left me scarred because it&#39;s led me to having a love/hate relationship with both food and my body. What I&#39;ve realized is that you&#39;ll never measure up to people&#39;s expectations. All you can do is do things for you and love yourself in the process.

"I think online creators really have a hard time with their careers, because in a normal job setting sometimes you can move on up, but how do you move on up in your own environment without branching out to Movies, TV, YouTube Red(not good content tbh), Nickelodeon, AwesomenessTV, without leaving their YouTube Channel like Liza Koshy left her subscribers for mtv. But like the rest of us if something doesn’t go right we leave the job and may go back to the job that will always has open arms for us and OG you tubers go back to their channel, but kind of sad they can’t move on as serious creators and the content shows.

I see where they say you don’t like making them and I’m not agreeing but I have followed you since the start and I miss seeing you more. By far your videos are in my top 3. But the other thing that people aren’t seeing is if you make a video that doesn’t work for you just to put one up that doesn’t work either.

"I soooooo agree with the couples fighting segment! One time while my husband was streaming in twitch and forgot to mute his mic during a HUGE fight. His viewers made a lot of comments about how we should break up, but one of his more frequent viewers was like &quot;you&#39;ve never been in a real relationship if you haven&#39;t fought like this&quot;. We&#39;ve been together for over 8 years so we mostly bicker because we&#39;ve learned to work through it, but fighting is so necessary for successful relationships! Very mature life lesson girl :)",DeeAnne Freeman,2019-02-06T22:08:16Z,0
"I don’t think that’s totally true, not that there is anything wrong with fighting. I‘ve been in a serious relationship for several years and we’ve never had s huge fight. In fact I don’t think we’ve ever had a real fight and we live together. I think she and I just communicate really well and with us both being women, we like talking about our feelings. It’s not that we never disagree, but we can both sit down and talk about what bothers us without blowing up. We’re getting married and our relationship has never been stronger. I’ve been in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships and the relationship dynamics are the same in some ways, but different in many ways. Just goes to show that you should never judge a relationship from the outside. Some couples fight a lot, some never do. People always have an opinion one way or the other.",Kassandra _,2019-02-07T06:26:39Z,1

"I remember exactly how I stumbled on Tess&#39;s channel. I was looking up different &quot;how to curl your hair&quot; videos and I just remember really enjoying it. Not even because I wanted to imitate it,  but because she looked so dang relatable! I remember there was an open closet in the background, and if it wasn&#39;t a closet, it was a bunch of random things. I just remember the background being busy.<br />Love you Tess !",tina lina,2019-02-06T04:12:08Z,0

"Your response to that body image assumption was so on point to how I felt in high school. I never had guys say those things about me, but I just looked at all the girls that my guy friends were into and realized I was totally not that. I&#39;m a 4&#39;10 extremely petite girl (now 22 years old). I mean I have curves for my frame, but I&#39;m def part of the itty bitty titty committee and don&#39;t have a big butt or anything. And it just kinda felt like a big blow not feeling physically appealing and I still am not always body positive when it comes to myself, but I&#39;m a lot closer now! Just thanks for being real with that experience. It just makes you that much more authentic and honestly relatable",Mimee,2019-02-06T03:29:16Z,0

"I really don&#39;t understand how guys&#39; opinions of you could bother you in any way. If you are doing well in other aspects, having good grades, a successful career, friends who care about you, you should be very proud of yourself. I really dont get the point of why so many girls have body image issues just because some guys told them bad things. Well, screw them.",Tiff Wong,2019-02-06T00:46:07Z,3
"@Kassandra _ Sorry, but I have never had any experience in my life where others&#39; opinions reduced my confidence or asked me to question myself, not as a teen, not as a 20 sth that I am right now, so do not assume I had the same experience. You speak for yourself, but not me. &quot;We all do it&quot; ,“ Or even yourself&quot; Do not make that assumption. My point is from my point of view, people&#39;s confidence does not depend on others unless they themselves want to make it to be like this. There is no point of lowering our self esteem by the our own actions. Focus on other things in the life. There are plenty of more important things to do besides constantly worrying about winkles, body sizes, facial structure, etc. There are plenty of other values in a person. People should learn to see through their physical appearance and recognize the inner traits. This is all my personal opinion.",Tiff Wong,2019-02-09T02:20:05Z,0
"Tina Wong I think it’s easy as an adult with maturity and life experience to Monday morning quarterback teens or even yourself as a teen or 20-something. We all do it, but in high school what others think can seem like the biggest deal in the world because you are forced to be around them all the time. Plus, it’s hard to understand how short high school and college really are in the grand scheme of things. I was really gawky and insecure in high school, I was even in chess club! The popular guys used to call me ugly all the time and it made me really insecure. Flash forward 12 years since I graduated high school and I’ve grown into my looks, done some modeling, and am more confident. One of those guys even ran I to me at a bar and hit on me a few years ago (totally rejected him btw)! I wish I had been more confident back then, but I didn’t know then what I know now...and yes, sometimes I still look in the mirror from time to time and feel like that 15 year old crying in the bathroom because of what some dumb high school boys said and I’m almost 30.",Kassandra _,2019-02-07T17:02:13Z,2

I just find it funny your freshman year story because when I was in 9th-grade boys made fun of me for having bigger boobs and I hated being more &#39;developed&#39; compared to other girls and had severe body image issues in my teens because of it!

Good things come to those who wait. Sometimes one most have some down falls to find our place in life. As for boys being mean to you for your body you should have told them to go fuck off it’s crazy how a little boy can body shame a female because of her outer curves and a females body is more obvious but they shouldn’t just because their parts are not visible don’t mean they’re perfect.,beautyspeakswithin23,2019-02-05T21:43:14Z,1

"It’s so interesting to me to hear how other’s insecurity in their youth developed because of what a bunch of teen guys said. Similar situations. I was the opposite of you, developed boobs earlier than a lot of my peers. Then my freshman year of high school was also denied by boys and told it was because I was “too mature” looking. They’d refer to me as “the Katy with the boobs”. It made me want to be so thin for so long until like you I developed more confidence in my body later in life. It truly shows why you should never listen to people telling you you aren’t good enough when apparently nothing is “good enough”",ktlane,2019-02-05T17:29:15Z,29

I love that green on you!! ❤️ And the story about freshman year and being so tiny was extremely relatable. I had a similar experience and still to this day I struggle with being petite as now I’m in college so the wide range of women can sometimes still give me some self esteem issues but it also has helped me gain more confidence and got me into going to the gym and fitness :),Lindsey Jones,2019-02-05T16:12:33Z,249
I loved the look for less videos!! Do more please,Jess Baker,2019-02-05T16:11:59Z,12

How have you been able to become friends with so many people being so shy? That’s something I struggle with. I’m the same way being way more outgoing when I’m comfortable with people and I struggle to get past the initial part of making new friends,Kirsty,2019-02-05T16:04:35Z,359
"It&#39;s all about time., as u grow up you are gonna find some people jus like u or kinda hav a connection with u.. Ur gonna slowly come out of ur comfort zone ..,and hey.,! Having a boyfriend is a turning point !<br />Super shy kid here!✋🏻",MARIYAMMATH RASHIDA,2019-03-14T11:38:27Z,0

"So TRUE! I have a few friends but I mostly found them through my boyfriend (so sad, I know) and some are still around from school. I don&#39;t even have a best friend..",Mind.of.Lilly,2019-02-07T19:00:46Z,2
"For me I just decided in college that I was sick of not having that many friends due to shyness so I put myself out there with people in my classes. I figured I could not ask and be alone, or ask and maybe get rejected but at least have the chance at not being rejected. Sure you may get rejected, but if you don’t even try it’s the same result anyway so you have nothing to lose.",Kassandra _,2019-02-07T17:07:35Z,18
