"first Tess, I love your content and I have been a following since 2015. I honestly have no intention in bringing down the worth of your creative content, but it really upsets me when the west gets so hyped about TikTok these day.<br /><br />If you are not aware of, TikTok is a platform created by the Chinese company Bytedance. Quoting from the Independent UK, &#39;TikTok has been accused of secretly gathering &quot;vast quantities&quot; of user data and sending it to servers in China. A class action lawsuit in the US claims the popular video-sharing app comes pre-installed with &quot;Chinese surveillance software&quot; that violates privacy, data and consumer protection laws.&#39;<br /><br />There have been too many cases of internet insecurity with streaming platforms related or owned by Chinese companies. Tiktok has also banned users speaking Cantonese, which is the native language to people in Hong Kong and the Guangdong region. This propaganda machine not only spy on international users like you all, but also murder other culture. Please think twice about popularising TikTok.",Candy Tsang,2020-04-05T09:42:17Z,6

"I loved this Tess! Thanks for filming this, totally cheered me up. Being a teacher, it&#39;s super hard not being able to see my kiddos during this time. This video of you, Pat, and the girls just made me smile. I just recently got engaged and have been using your wedding series to help me plan. I loved how you did a fun engagement shoot..we&#39;re thinking of doing that inspired by you and Pat! I&#39;ve been watching you for I think almost 7 years and have shared your YT and insta with all my friends and we just love you! <br>I also just made a TikTok for the hell of it while being indoors...totally feel you though, I feel so old doing this..but hey it&#39;s fun! :) TikTok: @lupitacis",lupita.,2020-04-04T23:58:21Z,55
