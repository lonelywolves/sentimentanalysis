Those jeans are probably also perfect for postpartum because the bump doesn&#39;t usually go away straight away. I wore that style of maternity jeans for a couple of weeks after birth 😊,Sonja Havukainen,2021-04-05T18:04:17Z,0

Can I just say I love that you are still making content that anyone can relate to I.e. outfits you can wear pregnant or not pregnant because I am 22 and in college and hopefully no where near being pregnant soon but a lot of my favorite YouTubers have been having babies and then only doing hauls and content related to that and I obviously can&#39;t relate as much so its nice that you&#39;re doing so well at combining the two!,Roxanne Bingham,2021-02-05T23:54:48Z,0

"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God&#39;s one and only Son. (John 3:16-18)<br />Whoever is reading this, Jesus loves you. Yes you. He loves you with all your faults and all your brokenness. He wants a relationship with you. He wants to heal you and redeem you. He wants to save you. He not only loves you, but died for you and took your punishment and mine upon himself. He bore our sin and shame. A death he didn’t deserve but we did. If you have not given your life to him and accepted him into your heart and repent/turn away of your sins, I sincerely hope you make the decision to do so soon. We are not promised tomorrow. “Come close to God, and God will come close to you.” (James 4:8) God bless. ♥️",Deyani,2021-02-05T03:11:52Z,0

"I absolutely love how you incorporate regular videos rather than just posting baby videos. There were a couple of Youtubers that I have honestly stopped watching because all they post are baby videos. Like I get it but i feel like some of those videos should be private and they would mean so much more, and also people don’t care THAT much about other people’s babies 😂 and then their channel isn’t even “them” anymore. With that being said, I can’t wait for you and pat to be parents!! 💗",Sam Carosella,2021-02-01T00:43:48Z,389
