"Hi greetings from Indonesia. <br />Love to see both of you. I really like your jet ski shot, but it was too short, wish you could give it longer.<br />I love your videos. Please if you ever come to Indonesia, please visit Labuan Bajo. You will see amazing beaches and islands, pristine crystal clear waters. Check our my vacation videos in Labuan Bajo.",Mata Air Dan Matahari,2020-10-13T18:05:32Z,0

"Charlee D. Do you realize this is a sponsorship and part of their job? Going, filming and posting to advertise this cruise is literally their job.

But don’t act as if they are doing us this huge favor by posting a video. Doing YouTube/Instagram and sponsor brands is their job.",Pony,2019-12-17T16:38:24Z,0

A passenger’s carbon footprint on a cruise ship is three times more than that of a person on land. Not to mention cruise ships have been caught disposing trash and sewage directly into the ocean.

The “only” plastic? I think it was enough plastic for me.... they could work on having reusable cups for the crew. For the amount of money you pay to get on a cruise I think they can afford on getting reusable cups for each person. That’s my humble opinion.,Jazmin Jurevich,2019-12-08T01:26:56Z,1
