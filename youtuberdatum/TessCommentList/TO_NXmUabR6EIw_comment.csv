I’ve struggled with finding a solid friendship since moving on from highschool and growing apart from those friends. Your relationships with your friends have always made me so jealous because they’re so genuine and something I really strive for but can never seem to find! Was thinking maybe a video on how you’ve been able to make/keep such great friendships would be so interesting and i think a lot of your other followers would agree 💛 you Tess!,Kirsty,2019-10-03T18:34:00Z,195
"The most relatable thing ever. I&#39;m Australian so I went to an all girls school (super common here) and I miss that sisterhood every day. I went from being in a group of 10 girls (not even counting guys or floater friends) and we did EVERYTHING together for 5 years. We taught each other to drive, we lived with each other when our parents traveled, we had pot-luck lunches. My best friend really struggled in high school (she went to a different one) but now at uni she has this massive group and its like we flipped. I would give anything to find that again. I think it&#39;s timing as an adult though because making a strong friendship group work requires most of the group to be single. For both guys and girls, because then you&#39;re free like all the time. But that never happens because everyone gets into a relationship from being so lonely missing their high-school group.",Sophie Auld,2020-01-15T06:49:52Z,0
