What is Tess talking about content being hard ? You literally didn’t post regularly for months before quarantine and now every video is literally an AD. I would like to see daily vlogs at least,Anais Elias,2020-05-17T18:27:36Z,2
Ali Shellabarger no argument there but I took a birds eye view ( check consistency and quality over the last year ) also skip in a 13 minute video ? I like Tess and I’m her consumer so it’s not a diss it’s a consumer complaint and yes I’ll sadly unsubscribe if it doesn’t improve .,Anais Elias,2020-05-19T22:59:42Z,0
"Some people have the preference of quality over quantity. I think it would be so easy to get burnt out doing daily vlogs if that isn’t your thing! Also, it was just a few minutes, just skip it if you don’t like ads, no big!",Ali Shellabarger,2020-05-17T19:08:24Z,2

"Hi everyone! I doubt my comment will be seen but these videos and community give me so much happiness and I could really really use some positivity right now. I finally had the courage to leave my abusive marriage, the night I called the cops and my husband was in jail I packed everything into a Uhaul and stayed at a hotel until I found a apartment, I used up all my savings and found somewhere safe, a week later my boss was let go, I got sick with suspected COVID and I was let go, now my bank account is -$581 and rent is due in 2 weeks and I’m so scared, I also found out I need a emergency root canal because I cannot open my jaw and the infection spread to it but I have absolutely no money to even get on a payment plan, I know everything will turn out how it’s supposed to but I feel like I’m drowning and could really use some grace and light right now. So can you all give me some of your best vibes 💛✨ love you all",Brianna Isabella,2020-05-17T17:37:57Z,79
