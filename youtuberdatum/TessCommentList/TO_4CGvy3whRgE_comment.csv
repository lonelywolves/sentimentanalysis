Tess Christine Hi Tess! I have been loving this series. I have been watching them non stop. I wanted to know if you have an advice on engagement ring shops in NYC. I live on Long Island. I love the style of your ring and styles similar to it. But I can’t find a trustworthy store. Thank you! Xoxo,mychala conti,2019-05-14T04:26:43Z,0
