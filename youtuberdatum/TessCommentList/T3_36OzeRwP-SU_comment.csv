"Thank you for always keeping it real Tess. Pregnancy, child birth, taking care of a kid/kids is no joke. People need to be more informed on what they are getting into. People tend to sugar coat or feel bad for &#39;complaining&#39; (which you are not, you are talking about your experience). Never feel bad for sharing how you feel, we support you!",Oxana Gielzynska,2021-04-18T19:25:27Z,23
The girls look AMAZING in the new collection!!! and so do you mama !,Manon,2021-04-18T19:18:00Z,2
Please keep it real! So we are prepared instead of living in the perfect pregnancy fantasy that doesn’t serve anyone. Take care and stay strong 💕,Kélia DJOSSOUVI,2021-04-18T19:00:51Z,41

I remember CRYING so many times right before I had my baby because to think about it never being just the TWO of us (my husband and I) ever again 😭😭 but it is the best thing ever to have a family of three! Such a different life but it adds life ❤️,Kayle B Lewis,2021-04-18T18:37:29Z,43

"I can’t believe that little bub will be here so soon! I’ve grown up with you, watching your teeth whitening, clothing hauls, and Vampire Diaries look book videos.

"Sharing what&#39;s hard isn&#39;t the same as being ungrateful for what you have. Pregnancy can be real rough, and saying that doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t love your baby. &quot;You don&#39;t have to love pregnancy all the time in order to love your baby.&quot; Paraphrasing a quote I read while pregnant. So, yeah, hard things a hard, man. And pregnancy is one of those sometimes.",Hannah Urh,2021-04-18T17:41:48Z,173
Yea I couldn’t agree more!,Ivy Hindman,2021-04-21T03:40:07Z,0
agree! you can hate the pregnancy but still love the kid. pregnancy is hard and she can feel it/say it. it is not her fault someone else can not have kids and she can feel how she wants,Dominika Mihoková,2021-04-19T16:58:25Z,0
Such a kind comment! I completely agree with you :),Sophie Hart,2021-04-18T18:11:36Z,3
maybe combine the 2 names that y’all like! like rené and esme (iykyk),vayda,2021-04-18T17:39:17Z,4
"Tess - keep. It. REAL! 👍🏻😘 pregnancy is such a blessing, AND, there’s a lot of toxic positivity out there on childbearing peoples shoulders to mask the very real symptoms and discomforts of growing a baby (or two in my case). Your gratitude radiates, but it’s also helpful to know the real truth that the body goes through in carrying a baby.",Josephine Jackson,2021-04-18T17:37:44Z,1
"I&#39;ve been following you for YEARS, basically through my teenage years and i feel like I grew up with you, so i still can&#39;t believe you&#39;re pregnant! you&#39;re so prettyyy, take care of yourself and the lil one ❤️",Marie,2021-04-18T17:33:00Z,56
Make sure to trim and file those nails short!! There’s no time to be cute while changing poopy diapers 😂,B X,2021-04-18T17:29:14Z,1

my moms craving for all four kids was always cuties and now we all can go through a bag of them in a day 😂,Natalie Fanning,2021-04-18T17:15:22Z,62
"That&#39;s funny because one of my teachers in high school told us that when she was pregnant, she ate spaghetti a lot of days out of the week, and when her daughter was starting to eat solid food, they tried to feed her some, and she simply rejected it lol. I guess she had enough of it in the womb",Mariah Hernandez,2021-04-20T00:35:49Z,2
"@Rae Navin definitely true!!! My mom with me craved like mexican, asian food and cookies and myself that&#39;s all I eat, my brother it was always fruit and he loves fruit and my sister it&#39;s peanut butter 🤣🤣 so there&#39;s definitely some fact behind it",gabby newman,2021-04-19T01:48:39Z,1
Gotta be true!  My mom said she ate so much pizza while pregnant with me and now it is my favorite food. Could probably eat it everyday lol!!,Ava Amaya,2021-04-18T18:00:59Z,1
I&#39;ve heard that whatever mom eats a lot of during pregnancy is what the kid craves later in life but idk if that&#39;s true lol,Rae Navin,2021-04-18T17:34:06Z,1

"So excited for you! I love my little boy sooo much. Third trimester is really hard. Definitely spend time with Patrick as your relationship changes (in some ways improves though, not all bad). I hope you go at 38 weeks! My son made me wait until 42 weeks and I needed to be induced to get him out (I&#39;m always jealous of moms that have babies before their due date and don&#39;t have the stress of being overdue).",Laura Maynard,2021-04-18T17:11:20Z,1
