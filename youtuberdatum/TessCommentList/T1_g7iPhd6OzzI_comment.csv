We feverishly whisked by hand 3X - different batches etc. with no success! This was an utter and complete disaster for us....

"From your previous video it was evident that Patrick has a pretty good collection of books. So from a fellow book lover I would like to suggest you to put some floating shelves in your living area walls, so that they won&#39;t take much of a space and it would give Patrick to show off some if his favourite books. Every book lover loves to show off their prize possession i.e books. But if Patrick is cool with books being neatly tucked in baskets or in entryway table then it&#39;s completely okay !

"The coffee is called dalgona coffee. Its a korean thing that went viral. Youre right it does taste like coffee milk (sells in korea).

"White leggings from fabletics are super see through, i hope they improve their white fabrics. everything else I love. &lt;3",Lupita Borjas,2020-04-12T19:38:51Z,114
Irena Phan yes! They all do but my favorite pair is the high waisted power hold. My favorite legging ever! Over gym shark and lulu lemon,ALEXIS MUNOZ,2020-04-21T15:52:45Z,1
Do you own any other pairs? I was wondering if they stay up,Irena Phan,2020-04-21T15:16:24Z,1
"I feel like they have amazing quality. I have like 25 pairs from them and not one is see through. You might need one size up, they might be stretching too much.",ALEXIS MUNOZ,2020-04-14T15:42:53Z,1
Lupita Borjas i don’t know the brand too much but if any form of legging Is see through maybe try a size up? I work at a Pilates/ yoga store and this is what I learned.,Keira Elizabeth,2020-04-13T00:23:57Z,4

"The coffee thing is so so cool but just do this sparingly because instant coffee has a higher amount of acrylamide in it which is a carcinogen. I would stick to darker roasts of brewed coffee or espresso to avoid it. Also the serving size for instant coffee is 1 tsp, so if you have anxiety probs definitely be careful with the amount of coffee you use.",Jyoti Bodas,2020-04-12T19:32:45Z,4
