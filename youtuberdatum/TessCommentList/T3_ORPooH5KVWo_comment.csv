For the ring to work you have to tap your belly with the ring three times and then it would usually spin or rock back and forth. Another way is to get a pointed necklace and tap three times on the palm of your hand (any). Tried this version with my mom and aunts and it’s been scarily accurate.,lovelysws,2021-03-18T06:44:33Z,0
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a girl and Omg how exciting,AODT,2021-03-18T06:44:09Z,0
"The ring thing didn&#39;t work because you need to use it over your right hand, not your belly, and I think a necklace would work better since it&#39;s a more lightweight object ❤❤",stranger capricorn,2021-03-18T06:44:01Z,0

Try the ring over your hand! That&#39;s how I did it with my friends and it was pretty accurate for the ones with kids. I still think it&#39;s a boy it&#39;s just the vibe you and Patrick give off 💙,gabby newman,2021-03-18T05:18:36Z,0

I think you were supposed to use your wedding band. I’m not sure if the diamond might have been the reason it didn’t swing( because all the weight is pulling it straight down).  Cute video though and my prediction is girl,Nancy Vasquez,2021-03-18T03:24:23Z,0

The ring test didn&#39;t work because you have to use a ring without anything on it!! Otherwise it won&#39;t move because it&#39;s too heavy. I hope you try it again hahaha ❤️❤️,Rocio Contreras,2021-03-18T03:18:33Z,59

i notice that the ring test doesn&#39;t really work over the belly but usually works if you do it over the top of your hand for some reason. that&#39;s another way to do it. i&#39;ve tried it on my mom and it goes girl then boy (me and then my brother) and then suddenly stops. it&#39;s so crazy!,Alyssa Martinez,2021-03-18T02:13:46Z,5
