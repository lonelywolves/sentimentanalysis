@Ellen Thompson yess that would be so great! Cause I really don&#39;t know how transfer her type of style into a fit for my body type. I think her styling her friends would be such a good video idea :),Rowan Bergen,2019-05-15T19:32:53Z,0
I love this idea. I have more of a chest and seeing other cute options would be awesome. She could style her friends for a week or something?,Ellen Thompson,2019-05-15T19:23:06Z,0
You have such a unique and nice style- love you so much! Just wishing that these videos of you would be longer because I‘m enjoying them so much :(,Lisa Höhenberger,2019-05-15T19:13:11Z,0
"Every time you make a outfit kind of video (spring outfits, what I wore in a week) I try to recreate the outfits everyday for work. It makes me wear things I haven&#39;t in a while but also influences me to buy something new to go with what I already have. It spices up what I wear to work. 💙 You.",Ellen Thompson,2019-05-15T19:12:27Z,0
