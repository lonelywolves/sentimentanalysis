"Hey Tess! Loved this video and it actually made me think of a fun fact. I’ve been a fan of your channel for about 4 years now and it all started with a post on a famous brazilian teen magazine with a headline sort of like this: “this youtuber’s boyfriend looks just like Harry Stiles” I’m not a Harry fan, but I ended up reading the article, watching the videos and I loved your Get the Look videos. Been a viewer since then.",Quase Primavera,2020-06-16T06:03:14Z,0
