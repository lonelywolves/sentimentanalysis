Hey Tess!  Or anybody else who might have some input! <br /><br />I have this idea to start a travel vlog for my family.  We are a US military family moving to Europe... I enjoy watching your travels and thought hmm... I might have an interesting perspective here.  <br /><br />I figure if nobody watches it I&#39;ll at least have all the memories documented in cool videos! <br /><br />Anyways... I&#39;d love tips on how to get started... or if anyone has any links on videos or blog posts.  I do have some experience as I took a course on digital media in undergrad and made a few movies... but that was years ago. <br /><br />No clue if anybody will even see this as i know millions of people watch these but i figured it was worth a shot 😂😂😂<br /><br />Thank you for your time!  - Cori,Cori Arbuckle,2019-03-11T11:10:41Z,0

"Hi! I have some Q...how much did you spend on that trip? I am only asking this bc I might go this year to England, London and since you have seen kind of a lot of touristy sites i do wonder how much i need for about 5 days at London. And when you went out to eat, did they have any gluten free option food? How much does or at least it costs to go, without the plane ticket. I am living in Slovenia so the plane ticket costs about 70 euros. And do you have any recommendations for London, for food, sites seeing, the hotel, taxi etc? Thank you, if you will answer it :) Great vlog :D",Kaja Stubicar,2019-02-28T09:59:24Z,1

I stopped in London on my Honeymoon. It was super awesome until a pigeon pooped on my face - yes face - outside Westminster where there is literally NO public bathrooms nearby. My life 😂😂,Jordy Reviews It,2019-02-27T18:58:00Z,3
"yes, the thing about London is there are no public bathrooms or maybe it was just where I went, and if there is a wc it’s inside a mcdonalds or something and tou gotta buy stuff (maybe just water) to use the bathroom it was a bit weird for me.<br>And also there was a huuge line in front of it so don’t wait till things get urgent haha",E Bb,2021-03-18T07:58:39Z,0
