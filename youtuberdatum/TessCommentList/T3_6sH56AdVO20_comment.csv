"First to congratulate you and wish you full term &amp; easy birth!<br />Avent bottle vent can be used in small bottles too, and works with formula. Bottle warmer is great for heating baby food.<br />The pacifier-prefence also depends on the shape on bottle (you have regular  other brands have slanted, &#39;orthodontic&#39; shape). Ours likes to chew all over pacifiers while teething so we got her Havea ones (natural kauchuk degrades within 5yrs for those who prefer lower impact on enviroment).<br />Pumping def.can increase the milk production, hopefully this one works for you, as all hands free ones are time and hand savers. Here in Europe Avent and medela brands are considered more gentle, however the avent one is more recomended on smaller sizes. I tried electric one, found it painfull so I used hand one. Breatfeeding or pumping, just make shure to lightly masage the chest, over milk glands.<br />Colics can be also just bc of latch, however the case, speek to Lactalis specialist or pediatrician on posebne use of formula (Aptamil Comfort can be used  over longer span of time).<br />One baby item we saw the biggest impact with  was the bouncer chair (we used BabyByorn bc of linen materijal and vompact design, but more afordable one work too - main thing is to keep them upright after meal)",Ivana Erenda,2021-03-16T08:53:14Z,0

"don’t use a pacifier when baby first comes!!! i’ve been on the mother baby unit and a lot of parents use it to sleep and have a break from the baby but it causes nipple confusion in most cases, it’s very emotional for mom when this happens because moms want to breastfeed and when baby doesn’t want to anymore, they need to take from bottle which is less convenient at first! also, pacifier confuses baby on suckling and sometimes can’t latch or will bite moms nipple (very uncomfortable) <br /><br />So excited for this journey of yours!! congratulations!",g Mon,2021-03-15T11:00:12Z,0

For example: pacifiers have newborn stage, 0-3 months stage and so on. And once they have teeth some pacifier are not recommended, which are stated in instructions. Most importantly most baby products including bottles have to be replace every few weeks. Read all product manuals.",DIA07chola,2021-03-15T02:42:59Z,10

"Can I ask something regarding Covid? Did you get the vaccine at all before getting pregnant ? So I’m very torn. I’m scared about getting the vaccine because I’m going to try to get pregnant soon. But if you don’t have the vaccine, do you feel safe being pregnant without the vaccine ? Sorry for the weird question, I just like hearing women’s opinions on this subject (anyone can chime in if they would like)",Angie Nic,2021-03-15T00:43:14Z,2
Our doctors do not recommended it if trying to become pregnant. To early to know what it can do to something growing inside you. Might want to fight off new growing cells...,Kelsey Kay,2021-03-21T04:19:21Z,0

"I think you should get vaccinated before getting pregnant . The truth is there isn’t a lot of solid info on the effects for pregnant women. You will feel much more comfortable during your pregnancy if you are fully vaccinated by the time you get pregnant! Also, watch dr mikes video on this topic. I think it’s called “the truth about pregnancy and COVID 19 vaccine” ? lots of good info. Good luck!! :)<br /><br />PS. I’m fully vaccinated and I feel so much more comfortable knowing my body will fight it if need be. Less stress and less anxiety!!",Grape Jelly,2021-03-15T04:03:24Z,4
"Honestly I think the only way our society will go back to normal is if everyone gets the vaccine! They wouldn’t give out a vaccine they would cause infertility, it’s so important for everyone to get vaccinated so we can put this virus behind us",M O,2021-03-15T02:42:16Z,1
"I am not a doctor but I would not get it if I planned on getting pregnant soon. I would just take as many precautions as I can and social distance. We do not know the long term effects yet, the vaccine is so new.",andrea summers,2021-03-15T02:11:51Z,1

"That bar cupboard is one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen! I love the vibe of your interior, so gorgeous 🥰<br />Btw the fact that you’ve chosen olive dresser makes me thing you’re having a boy 😂",Katarzyna Grzejda,2021-03-15T00:22:35Z,167
@Taylor V Yes! They were sure it’s a boy and the doctor confirmed it many times and then it turned out to be a girl 😂 I don’t know but I really hope they did a neutral toned nursery 😂,Katarzyna Grzejda,2021-03-16T15:53:16Z,2
@Katarzyna Grzejda I realized my initial comment said girl. I meant boy!<br /><br />That’s crazy! They didn’t know until they actually gave birth?,Taylor V,2021-03-16T01:17:36Z,0
@Taylor V it does but I think in general with babies it’s all unpredictable! I know a couple who got confirmed during ultrasounds that the baby is a boy and then during birth turned out to be a girl 😂,Katarzyna Grzejda,2021-03-16T01:04:23Z,1
"I’m guessing boy because of how early she knew. My sister in law is pregnant and also due in June, and she wasn’t able to find out until after Tess did. She said they can sometimes tell earlier if it’s a boy, but everyone looks like a girl at first. <br /><br />Idk if that made sense hahaha.",Taylor V,2021-03-15T20:05:08Z,1
