"what julia said about quality being more important than quantity is so spot on. i went to a tiny high school that on top of that, was overpacked, so it was easy to &quot;know&quot; everyone, but not everyone is your friend and i think as teenagers and maybe even younger adults, it&#39;s easy to want to have as many friends as possible because let&#39;s face it, life, and those years in particular, can get pretty lonely. but the phrase, &quot;4 quarters are worth more than 100 pennies.&quot; is so true. loneliness and a need for friendship isn&#39;t quenched with a thousand friends. in fact, the more you have, the lonelier it gets, from my experience. you honestly could even just have one or two really really great friends and be totally satisfied.",m.,2019-12-03T07:49:21Z,0

"@rando I think everybody has different experiences with opposite sex friendships. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#39;t. But in the end it also doesn&#39;t really matter what we think bc it&#39;s their friendship and they know what is true. But I also  think that you can love somebody but not actually feel sexually attracted to them, as it often is with same sex friendships. But that&#39;s just my opinion :)",.deborah.,2019-11-26T10:41:37Z,1
.deborah. Exactly. I think there are a lot of younger people in her audience now. I‘m personally a 90s gal and have been a subscriber to her channel since day one. So from a end-20s-married with two kids perspective there is nothing new here. But still enjoy seeing everyone and listen to their stories. 😊,snj prl,2019-11-25T13:56:45Z,12
