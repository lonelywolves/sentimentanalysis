The crease those trousers get around your crotch is not good. I think nothing ruins an outfit more than ill-fitting clothing. The first outfit with the obscenely chunky dad sneakers mixed with those height-stunting jeans make you look stubby and not put together. Us French women place a lot of emphasis on the fit of clothing. It should look chic and tailored to your body.,Melody Schnapp,2019-03-08T15:41:22Z,0

i’d honestly invest in a re/done tee. you can register the serial number and get free replacements and repairs for life (plus they’re ethical and sustainable!!),inalykowski,2019-03-12T23:25:38Z,2
I highly recommend the ribbed white tee from everlane. They have a couple other good styles,nicolelizabeth,2019-03-10T19:44:25Z,1
I purchased a pack of men&#39;s basic white tees a whiiiile back from Wal-Mart and they have been awesome! They&#39;re not as fitted as a ladies top and the material is thicker- a lot of men&#39;s tees are designed for breathability as well because they often go under other layers so that&#39;s a plus!,Steph Katrina,2019-03-08T05:40:52Z,2
