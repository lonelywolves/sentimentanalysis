what cruise line did you use?,chelsey lucio,2019-01-07T17:21:51Z,0
"Hey Tess, nice video as usual, however: would you take a few minutes and inform yourself about how bad cruises are for the ocean, the environment in general (air) and local tourism? <br /><br />It&#39;s actually way worse than flying (which isn&#39;t good either but still better than cruises, waste is getting dumped directly into the ocean and the amount of CO2-emissions is 3 times as high as on a plane. Local tourism suffers because people sleep on the ship and not in the hotels/apartments and sometimes don&#39;t even eat in the location they&#39;re visiting. Just a few thoughts (that you can confirm online easily). I don&#39;t mean to make you feel bad, but it&#39;s just something many people don&#39;t think about and maybe it could be avoided in the future. Otherwise I loved the video and you in general, so please don&#39;t take it personally. Cheers :)",Kaitlyn,2019-01-07T17:20:31Z,3

I started following you from the beginning (hey, pretty little liars makeup tutorials) because your accent made me remember home (Wisconsin) after I had moved to Colorado.

I don’t think no one is perfect but you guys seem like a very awesome couple so chill<br />Don’t want to sound nosy but I was wondering if you guys would be interested in making a video on your guys relationship and how you guys make it work and do you guys have disagreements and how you guys compromise and how you both deal with jealousy <br />And of course only if it’s ok,beautyspeakswithin23,2019-01-06T19:43:03Z,0

Is it only particular places like the one you were in that allow smoking indoors, or is it allowed everywhere?
