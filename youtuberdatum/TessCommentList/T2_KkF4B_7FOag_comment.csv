Like you said, you have always cared about fashion and made that the forefront of your channel.

"Although I am very happy for you from a business and personal standpoint, I can’t help but feel disappointment at the lack of size inclusivity. You have millions of followers, some of those followers are women who don’t fit standard sizes. I really believed that you would be inclusive of more bodies. When you said that you would include more sizes “IF” the demand arises, it felt like people in larger bodies are just an afterthought in your clothing line. As someone who has been a loyal subscriber since the beginning of your channel I am really sad that I can’t purchase items from your collection because it’s not an option due to my size not being available. I hope I’m not offending you. I am just truly disappointed.",Esty L,2020-08-24T20:57:45Z,1

It was a very gloomy evening, trying to figure out my life and I found your „How I wear crop tops” video even though it was November and I didn’t even own any crop tops 😂 That evening I watched every single video on both your channels, I was so excited to discover you were in Poland and then I introduced you to my Mum and my boyfriend as my new style icon and role model. You quickly became „white-teeth Tess” (my husband LOL 😅) and sorry to say - we are stuck together for EVER! Thank you for being my ray of sunshine. I wish you all the best and I’m jumping to your website to shop now ❤️",Katarzyna Grzejda,2020-08-24T14:52:17Z,0

I truly feel like I grew up with you, when I started watching you, I was like 13 years old, barely speaking English and about to go to high school. Now I&#39;m in uni about to start my second year of law school. Seeing you grow and achieving big things makes me so happy :&#39;) Even though I&#39;m not active on Twitter or Instagram anymore, I want to let you know that I still watch all your videos and wish you the best of luck on this new chapter.

I worked for them for 3 years, so trust me I am experienced in their patterns and cuts of fabric. I know you are a fan of the brand, but I can see details on some pieces ripped straight from their designs. Not that I am defending them, because they&#39;re a shitty brand, but its very VERY similar to a lot of pieces. Just thought you should know.",Eva Hynes,2020-08-24T13:50:25Z,0

I AM SO PROUD OF YOU! I remember exactly the time I subscribed to you - back in 2012. I was looking for a Katherine Pierce makeup/outfit inspiration and I came across your channel. TESS - you were the very first beauty/style guru here on YT I have subscribed to. You were the reason why I started to learn how to do makeup and hair and why I have been hooked on it since then. This video made me emotional because it feels like my older sister&#39;s dream just came true. I cannot wait to get my hands on this clothing line! LOVE YOU! xx,Adriana Luptak,2020-08-24T09:43:24Z,1

You have always been my favorite YouTuber and I have been rooting for you to have a clothing line since the minute I discovered you years and years ago.  You have always been a style inspiration for me, someone that could take trends and prove to me that they were wearable and not scary. I think most of us have gravitated to your channel because your style is our style, and we trust your recommendations and opinions. Whenever a friend would ask what’s your style or dream style, I will always pull up your page. That’s why I will definitely be buying from the beautiful line you have curated. Big, big, big congratulations to you. <br /><br />P.s. backyard roses sounds so cozy like you said and I loved your explanation. Wishing you soooo much success with this new endeavor.",Jenna Del Pozzo,2020-08-24T06:45:12Z,0

"Tess, i’ve been watching you since your original get the look videos. You have been my style icon for years. You’ve helped me learn to curl my hair, style myself and just gain that independence i needed as a teen. You introduced me to Carrie who became such an integral part to my growth and watching both yours and her vlogs are somewhat of a security blanket for me(sounds dramatic but it’s true lol) and i am just so so beyond proud of you and so HAPPY that you are finally getting to see your dreams flourish. I can already tell the quality is amazing and I am so excited to have some of these pieces in my wardrobe and know i’m supporting such a kind and hard working woman who helped me learn so much along the way! ❤️🌹 i can’t wait to see what’s next!",Emily Jane,2020-08-24T03:44:50Z,0

I’m sad that there isn’t extended sizing though, because I am usually in between regular sizing and plus depending on the item. I understand with a new clothing business the opportunity to make extended sizes isn’t always available due to the newness of the company. But I hope that with the success I know you’ll have with this line, extended sizes that are inclusive towards everyone will be available! All the love, congrats! 💕",Grace M,2020-08-24T02:08:09Z,16
