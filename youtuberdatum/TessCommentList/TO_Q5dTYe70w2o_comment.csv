"Hi Tess long time sub and I love you style! I a had a idea for a video..... I’d really love to see you do a video or multiple videos on how you would style and dress other body types in your style... maybe get your friends in ... I’m 5/7 and have the same body type as your friend Carrie for example and I often see your outfit pics and love them on you but just can’t picture it on me or feel that it wouldn’t be flattering on my body. Problem is don’t really know how to simply alter your style to suit me better, So I tend to always end up in a thrifted tshirt and denim lol which is cute but it’s nice to mix it up.",Sarai C,2019-04-04T23:36:21Z,0
