When you guys plan to have kids maybe move to New Jersey!! It’s really close to the city and there are beautiful suburban areas and great schools for kids!! It’s the perfect combination.,Bella Porraro,2019-05-09T00:50:31Z,38
I grew up in Point Pleasant. It was seriously THE BEST childhood ever. I wish everyone could have experienced growing up on the real Jersey shore.,Tanya Karazan,2019-05-10T22:35:37Z,1

So funny about the sparklers exit. All the weddings I worked when I assisted with a wedding planner the couples and guests left after the sparklers exit. Sometimes the bride and groom stayed to make sure clean up and personal items were taken care of.,Libby Audrey,2019-05-09T00:14:04Z,19

"That’s so interesting that your worst year was the first year you were in New York. My husband and I had a similar bad year the first year we lived in Missouri having moved from Chicago. It’s a huge adjustment moving somewhere out of your norm. Glad you guys were able to work through it. We’ve lived in Missouri 5 years now (military family) and now have 2 kids, 1 dog, and overcoming that huge change has made us stronger.",Vanessa Chico,2019-05-08T22:53:07Z,2

"This video was perfect! My boyfriend and I moved from Wisconsin to Ohio (I know not far) but we moved here last August. I’ve always lived in Wisconsin and have been five minutes from my parents and friends so it was a huge adjustment for me because like you guys we didn’t know anyone but a few of his coworkers, so it’s been tough to meet people. Also, I love the wedding videos because again with us living here we’re trying to decide if we will go back home or have it in Ohio and then how to plan a wedding in a different state! Love you guys!! Thanks for always being real! ❤️",Brianna C,2019-05-08T22:30:09Z,2
