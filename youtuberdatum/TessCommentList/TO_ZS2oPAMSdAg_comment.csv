SO off topic but what do you do for teeth whitening?,Sincerely Miss Sarah,2020-08-13T01:32:46Z,0
"Great video with amazing value. Connecting with the right makeup artist for you is so important prior to your wedding day. However, a great alternative would be to actually do the makeup yourself! Now I know this is not a popular idea, however it can make for a fun experience and something to look back on in the future. Similar to a bride making her own dress. Just a small detail you personally added to the day. If this is something you are considering or are curious about check out this video I made with a few tips to help make that process a bit easier and not so overwhelming. Really hope it helps or inspires someone to try it out :) - <a href=""https://youtu.be/OO_1GhhjhvE"">https://youtu.be/OO_1GhhjhvE</a>",Beyond The Literal,2020-06-20T00:47:52Z,0

Your mua did a beautiful job! As a pro mua myself I kinda cringe though when I see muas use beauty blenders on clients (unless it’s the clients own) because sponges are not hygentic unless they are disposable,Livi170,2019-09-13T11:30:39Z,0
