"I&#39;m at the point in which I&#39;ve deleted instagram, broke up with my ex boyfriend (now since half a year), cut off some toxic friends and now I&#39;m left with only myself trying to figure out who I am and what feels right.

I love your intro and how you talk to us. I&#39;ve been quarantined with my boyfriend for the past four months and It can be really hard and boring sometimes. Mental health is very important right now.

"Love vlogs! I understand you a little bit, I&#39;m not in the same situation with the pandemic (still quarantine).  But I had to make so many changes because I was getting too much anxiety and at some point I even felt depressed in April because it was my last semester and didn&#39;t know if I would graduate (I did).  But exercise, meditation, and cooking has helped me so much.  I&#39;m more clear now that I established a routine and love it.  Even started an online program which I&#39;m enjoying greatly and already made some new friends.  For me it&#39;s been about getting out of my comfort zone and trying new things. Hopefully it would end soon!",grace riv,2020-08-23T19:03:24Z,0

"Honestly, and I mean this in the best way possible, your quarantine content made me want to watch you so much more &amp; fall more in love with your channel! I&#39;ve been subscribed since before your big New York move (so I&#39;ve been around for a looong time lol) and I feel like you opened up a little more w your life &amp; emotions in your quarantine content!

2020 is the craziest rollercoaster I’ve never wanted to be on but I do think I got to know myself more which I’m grateful for. Appreciate the little things became v real this year hahahah,Keira Forster,2020-08-20T08:59:39Z,0
Aww I am doing alright I guess but unfortunately I am in a long-distance binational relationship so I have not been able to see my boyfriend for the past 5 months. He is in TX and I am in CZ. I think not being able to travel and just be stuck in my country and all the crazy restrictions - all of that I think is pretty doable to go through (it is not fun by any means but you just kinda have to make the best of it as you said) but the fact I have not been able to see my amazing boyfriend for this long and not knowing when I will see him again has been seriously probably the hardest thing I have experienced in life up to this point. It is hard to not hate 2020 :-D Just really really wish this would pass already!<br /><br />But I am SO HAPPY for you and it is so awesome you get to have your own clothing line! And do not feel bad you had lack of inspiration for your videos! It makes total sense. I just watched your old videos haha! ;-),Kristýna Čižinská,2020-08-20T08:59:16Z,0
