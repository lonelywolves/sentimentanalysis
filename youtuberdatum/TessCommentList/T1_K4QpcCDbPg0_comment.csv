"I don’t ever comment anything negative on tess’s videos (or anyone’s). She was, for a long time, the only content creator I could stand. But her recent IG post, more specifically her response, really bothered me. She had originally captioned her post that she was going to “self isolate” out of town with her friends and vlog, as if it is a vacation and not an international health crisis. Many people commented that doing that goes against CDC recommendations and is really quite reckless and is furthering the problem. People don’t get that you may spread or get this this by touching anything, talking to a cashier, touching and putting back grocery items, etc which is why people are being asked to go out for essentials only to minimize risk to everyone. You don’t know if your cashier (or their spouse) has CF or is old or has asthma and can’t just stay home from work. Instead of addressing comments, trying to understand everyone’s concerns, or deleting the post she just closed the comments and reworded the post to make it look like she was staying home. This was misleading and very irritating. She clearly doesn’t want people to see the original post and everyone’s comments on it because it gave away what was in the original post which got negative feedback. I have unfollowed and am disappointed that someone I’ve respected so long would do that just for likes (which equal money for an influencer). Even if she totally disagreed and kept the post up and with original wording I would understand and that would have shown integrity. But to shut off comments and mislead people intentionally is disappointing. I thought people should know.",Kassandra _,2020-03-18T16:33:19Z,10

I like how every time I see a fashion vid from u over the years it’s very wearable if that makes sense. As YT’s grown so many influencers’ outfits look like they’re going to an event everyday lol (even though they’re still awesome) but it’s nice to see u always look realistic and put together and still super fashionable! Some people I know just don’t have an eye for fashion and so they on these types of videos are needed but in a more realistic context. Trends and glamour are great sometimes but to be more streamlined with clothes just makes sense! If anything you’ll stand the test of time on platforms. gosh I hope that doesn’t sound judgy or mean 💗,Nhajah,2020-03-16T08:18:34Z,15
