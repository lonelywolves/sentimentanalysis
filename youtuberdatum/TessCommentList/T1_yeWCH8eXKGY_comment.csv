"Some show recommendations:<br />• Wynonna Earp - supernatural modern outtake on Wyatt Earp&#39;s legacy<br />• Motherland: Forth Salem - only a couple eps out, it&#39;s a fantasy show about witches who are fighting in wars<br />• TVDverse spin-ofs (The Originals, Legacies) - just because I know you&#39;re a tvd fan<br />• The Magicians - I am only two seasons into it but it is really good<br />• One Day at a Time - it&#39;s a sitcom about a cuban family that deals with a lot of issues (race, religion, immigration, sexuality, anxiety and depression etc.)<br />• Chilling Adventures of Sabrina - darker outtake on the traditional concept<br /><br />And then some classics if you haven&#39;t watched them yet - Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed, Nikita, Doctor Who, etc.<br /><br />Beep me if you need any more recommendations 😉",TheSerialLove,2020-04-28T21:40:38Z,0

Hey Tess! Idk if you like korean shows but on Netflix there is an amazing drama called Itaewon Class. I think you and Pat would love it a lot. It’s about the struggles of a character in life after a tragic incident that happened to him. I don’t want to give away too much but it has subtitles and it’s really good. I rate it 10/10.,Megan R,2020-04-28T03:47:01Z,0

When quarantines over you should do a video with Kara about cooking! You know since she’s an actual chef. You could call it “Cooking with Kara” Lol Also a really good show is The Last Ship! Probably not ideal to watch rn but it’s so good!,Lexi S,2020-04-27T23:59:34Z,97
