"I’m very excited about what you are doing - no hate, but there is no such thing as vegan leather. “Vegan leather” is simply the result of decades of evolution of the pleather (plasticized synthetic leather). Plastic polymers polyurethane (PU) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are the most commonly used to produce faux leather fabrics. The term “vegan leather” was created by fast fashion as a cheaper and more public appealing alternative to real leather. Things need to be named for what they really are. Especially in fashion, transparency is the key.",Annietes,2020-10-05T10:57:19Z,8

ok I’m loving this entire collection! Fall is my favorite season and it always makes me excited to dress for it!🥰,Odalis Neira,2020-10-05T03:12:02Z,1
I don’t blame you for not knowing but black leather trench coats are a huge fashion faux pas 😬 they were popularized and first worn by the Nazis (specifically the Gestapo) during WWII and it’s really unfortunate that so many brands are pumping out this trend without knowing its dark history. Yours does have a bit of a difference from the traditional trench (no storm flap or double breasting) .......but it’s just something to consider next time,B X,2020-10-05T03:08:43Z,2
LOOVEE! Will these pieces be limited for this season? Or do you plan to keep some of the basics (such as the leather ones) as staples for all year round?,Stephanie Castellanos,2020-10-05T03:07:28Z,1

I love her clothing brands style but it’s ridiculously overpriced and not realistic for people who don’t have a lot of spending money. Who pays 65 dollars for a skirt?,Anaiese,2020-10-05T03:02:16Z,1
"Thankfully she&#39;s not a fast fashion brand where pieces are made with cheap materials and underpaid workers. She is trying to be more environmentally friendly and an ethical brand, and that cost more :) Plus I&#39;m sure the quality will last awhile because of these reasons",Stephanie Castellanos,2020-10-05T03:25:17Z,7
"Eeep! Thank you for mentioning that there is the potential for petite and tall sizes in the future!!! I LOVE these pieces, I’m excited for your line to grow 😍",Anna Kivi,2020-10-05T03:02:07Z,6
