"Hi!! I see all of your comments! Thank you for being so caring and thoughtful 🥺 I am a bit sad. We have gone through it this year and not seeing my family or going to my best friends wedding really hit me this week. I know a lot of people are having a tough time and I’m with you. I’m currently editing the Catskills video and it’s clear I needed some time out of the city with my NY family. I feel so much better. Thank you for caring, I love you and I hope you are all ok too. Ily.",Tess Christine,2020-09-21T00:24:25Z,456

I know how you&#39;re feeling.. here in Italy the situation isn&#39;t that good and it has been very awful in the past months.. my cousin was supposed to marry her fiancé  back in May but she couldn&#39;t and now their wedding is going to be in October but we&#39;re not going because it is a different city and it is dangerous especially for my grandparents ! also my mother broke her wrist and arm in august.. 2020&#39;s shit :(,Chiara Vitale,2020-09-22T19:54:59Z,0

"guys I think we should all stop shopping constantly from amazon, it&#39;s the most unethical and unecological thing to do. More in general this consumerism that make us think we are always in need of something new and material is literally killing us planet. American more than others should reflect seriously on the <br />consequences of their actions in terms of shopping, trying to make specific choices is our duty. We need to get informed and start acting, we can&#39;t be so cruel and egoistic .<br />Tess you&#39;re so sweet and I&#39;ve always watched your videos, and this thoughts are adressed to everybody and lot of youtubers but all theese content, this showing new stuff all the time that isn&#39;t really eco-friendly (especially all fashion items--&gt; fast fashion is the worst, so damaging) it&#39;s kinda dangerous. it&#39;s not your job obviously but you could really  contribute to the sensitize the people.",theuga98,2020-09-21T11:08:30Z,1

"@Lisa Hooks yes totally agree. it seems like her trip she took recently to upstate NY helped as she said in the comments.

"Hope the trip to Catskills cheered you up! I’m a European subscriber so I am not completely aware of how the US testing is working/in what capacity it is possibly to actually get tested, BUT are you able to just get tested? depending on the test results, let’s say it’s negative then couldn’t you actually go and visit your families? all these restrictions are made so we do not spread the virus - and if you do not have it - ofc take precautions nonetheless masks, sanitize etc -traveling to see friends and family should not be a problem? I know testing probably is hella expensive(?) in the US - and pardon for maybe coming of as ignorantly privileged, but I am so fortune to live in a country where there is universal healthcare and the whole testing situation is so convenient and frictionless",SW G,2020-09-21T07:37:51Z,0

"God bless you, Tess, for following the rules and showing that that&#39;s what we all need to do in order to get through and over this pandemic. It&#39;s been really frustrating me to see YouTubers and influencers all over Instagram who are bending the rules and flying and going to weddings, etc. I&#39;m seeing so many people get together with friends in other states or saying they have to travel for work. You are just proving that they don&#39;t and they are choosing to break the rules. It&#39;s good to see someone who has influence following them. I know it&#39;s hard. We are all with you. Sending you love.",Neely O'Connor,2020-09-21T20:49:02Z,1
I wonder what it looks like in other countries because in Poland everything is like before the virus except wearing masks in public places. Most people travel on vacation as usual. We don&#39;t believe it that much because they don&#39;t give us real information and numbers on TV. The people who died had other diseases as well.,I remember,2020-09-21T12:10:54Z,1
