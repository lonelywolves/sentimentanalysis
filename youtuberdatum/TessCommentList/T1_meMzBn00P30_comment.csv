There’s nothing wrong with telling someone something that they can improve from, as long as that is made with love, empathy and their best interest in mind and that’s what I did. If it was me I would love that people brought my attention to it so that I could be aware and maybe try not to do it so much. Not all critics are bad, there are some that makes us better individuals &amp; professionals, we are not perfect and we can all improve at some things.

"For the books I would recommend that you keep them as away from heat, sunlight, moister and food as it is possible. Near the kitchen space they can get highly damaged. I don’t know if you have the space or budget but it would be great if you could get some sort of bookshelf, tall or short. You could get some sort of those tables that go in front of the couch where the tv goes. Just some tips to prevent the books from getting tored apart or stained",Delfina Moyano,2020-03-08T20:19:13Z,0

"I totally get your feelings on wanting to have a newer, safer apartment when you’re entering the phase of life of thinking about a family. My husband and I are in a similar situation as you and Pat; we just got married last year and I recently also lowkey freaked out imagining starting a family in our current old apartment. Although it’s a beautiful old flat in a converted Victorian house from the 1890’s with lots of character, it also has crumbling paint and dodgy pipes and all of that...<br />It totally makes sense to want to have the best possible situation for your new phase of life! Thanks for sharing this journey 💛",Genevieve,2020-03-08T18:57:36Z,249
