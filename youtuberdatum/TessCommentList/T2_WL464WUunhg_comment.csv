"Hey I know you mean well and don&#39;t want to put any pressure on Tess but we can never know what her personal and private feelings about pregnancy are. Even just hopeful expressions regarding pregnancy can be hurtful for a lot of people (for example if someone is trying to get pregnant but can&#39;t). Once again, I don&#39;t think you had bad intentions!

Just a thought, bc a lot of ytbers are and say they don&#39;t wanna show the windows in case. But I&#39;m really glad if that is a safe and good place you feel secure in enough that you can show the view ! It looks STUNNING !

Honestly I love your style and aesthetic. Someone that might be cool to do for more storage would be to go to like Home Depot or your local  hardware store and make your own table and put it over one of I’m assuming the heater boxes (idk maybe ac) lol anyways make a little table to go over it so that you have a some more places to put pictures or decor or anything you really want to kinda hide on of them since they are a little bulky. Also maybe you could (when not in use) put a nice table cloth (which you can get any fabric you want) so that it hides the box. Idk if this makes sense but idk could be cool.,Janaya Ortiz,2020-12-04T03:05:42Z,0
