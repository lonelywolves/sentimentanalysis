Do these food delivery services actually make life that easier? Surely it’s not that hard to buy your own groceries right?,Eliza Nguyen,2019-10-29T16:26:41Z,2
As a flight attendant who has crazy hours and is so exhuasted the last thing you want to do after a 14 hour day is go to a grocery store. Everyone&#39;s life is different.,Oxana Gielzynska,2019-10-29T17:33:44Z,0
"It&#39;s definitely not hard to buy your own groceries and we definitely do that, but I&#39;m a creature of habit so it&#39;s nice to not always default to the same meals. These force us to try new things :) I&#39;ve talked about meal services in other vlogs a few times. We really do love them.",Tess Christine,2019-10-29T16:37:50Z,3
