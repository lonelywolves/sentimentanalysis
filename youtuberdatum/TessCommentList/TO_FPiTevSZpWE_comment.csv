"Anna Simonsen a bachelorette party is to celebrate the end of her &quot;single&quot; life and the start of her marriage. the girls essentially party. and it&#39;s usually held at night, depending on the bride. the bridal shower is held during the day and it&#39;s like a baby shower. friends and family gift them things they might need for their first home together. blenders, toasters, microwaves, basically home appliances. but because tess and pat have been sharing a home for quite some time now, the bridal shower seemed like more of a formality and like she said, an excuse to be around friends and family. again, it depends on the bride/couple&#39;s situation. but yeah, that&#39;s basically the difference.",m.,2019-07-01T00:01:37Z,99
