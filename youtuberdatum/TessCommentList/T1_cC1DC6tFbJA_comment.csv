"Thanks for the video Tess!  Wanted to share my self-care Sunday:<br />- Wake up and Breathe because I learned that’s a good start.<br />- Three cups of coffee.  I always add in the third cup not because I need it but because I enjoy having my Mom pay for extra stuff.<br />- Think about what to eat for lunch.  No breakfast here kids!  And also I find thinking is good and when you combine thinking with food it’s twice as good.<br />- Use the potty and freshen up<br />- Go on YouTube to enhance iterations of past clicks, thoughts and desires.  I enjoy computers and computers telling me what I can see.  Don’t judge!<br />- Think about what’s for dinner and if I need to cook before I eat.<br />- Sporadically throughout the day pace roughly three miles in the house and stare out the front and rear window.  Sometimes I’ll bark at passing cars or moving organisms.  I’m curious about the outside.<br />- Eat dinner.  Usually food in nugget form.  It’s just easier.<br />- Watch videos and post random thoughts online until bed and it starts all over again.",Bill Stiggy,2020-11-03T02:11:28Z,0

THANK YOU I thought I was an unproductive human bc everyone who has they’re shit together has like a 2h morning routine and at first when I had a 9-5 I thought it was just unrealistic then but now I’m self employed work from home and still the ONLY consistent thing is I brush my teeth nothing else stays the same,Sparrow,2020-05-06T09:24:20Z,0

Esha Cindy she’s glowing!
