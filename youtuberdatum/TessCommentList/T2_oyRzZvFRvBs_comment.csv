I did exactly the same amount of decor as you and that’s good for me lol. I don’t like a huge amount of cheesy decor I think it’s sweet to keep it true to who you are. Also my husband also has the same lamp you got Patrick from Etsy. We got it at an estate sale. It’s a lawyer’s lamp and we love it :D,prachi pratyusha,2020-12-18T19:09:07Z,0
