meditation to finish it up so
i'm really excited to spend the next 30
minutes or so with all of you
and we're going to begin with our
warm-up
all right let's do this
so to begin because you may be sitting
all day i want to help you
open up that upper body meet you right
here with big
shoulder rolls to the back good

of movement of your day

the time with this

second but shoulders are relaxed

obviously the workouts that we program

emotionally
and mentally release stress

this is difficult for you and it might
mean if you need it the most
[Music]
we're going to breathe here for the next
10 seconds
[Music]
and i'm going to read you a short quote
like i always do to finish out your
class
and it is called be kind to yourself
there is never a better time to be kind
to remind yourself of how far you've
come
not bringing up how far you still need
to go
to care for yourself in a way that only
you can without relying on the words and
actions of others
to fall in love with taking care of
yourself without feeling
obligated or guilty for it it's time to
create an unbreakable love for yourself
that cannot be broken by the unkind
words and
actions of others go ahead and open your
eyes if they were closed
and here's to being kind to ourselves
for 30 minutes today and hopefully many
more
inhale reach the arms up to the top and
exhale
let it go great job today kiki crew
