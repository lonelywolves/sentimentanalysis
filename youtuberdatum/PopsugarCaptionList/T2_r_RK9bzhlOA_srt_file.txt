find your space so we will be coming
down to the floor
near the end of this 30 minutes so if
you have
just something that can cushion you for
your low back it might be a mat it might
be carpet it could be a towel
just have it available inhale your arms
up feel your abdomen extend
exhale your hands down breathe in deeply
and remember one of the reasons that we
do these lives
is to remind each other that we're all
awake and alive
all of us in our own spaces around the
world two more times
big breath so collectively we feel that
energy
one more big breath into your stomach
and come back down turn your feet
parallel and rot
so from here there's a slight hinge
forward at your hip not around
your heart beams imagine a light coming
out of it eight more counts

we create heat

exhale your hands back down tip your
feet a little wider drop your chin to
your chest
open back look to the side
other side now circle around
take your moment your cervical spine do
it one more
time is your neck

there's mobility there
so we start this experience getting rid
of tension
bring your arm forward if you have
tightness in your shoulder soften your
elbow four more times

under your shoulders awakening your
breath and your stomach circle your hips
around
and around two more times that direction
your hips are meant to move in spirals
not just forward and back other way

pelvic floor
the strength in your abdomen then from
there bring your legs tight together
inhale up and drop your shoulders hold
to your wrist and bend to the side
tuck your tailbone under and take a long
breath see if it can kind of unstick the
side of your ribs so we can take
bigger oxygenated breaths in the side of
your lungs
tuck under let yourself open up
this 30 minutes is about connecting with
your body with each other
bring both arms back now here's a
modification your hands can go on your
low back and your chin can stay tucked
or allow yourself to vulnerably open up
find the heart in your chest and beam it
to the sky
take one more breath exhale round down
step your feet out slightly wider again
then one knee and then the other knee
so we're working through a fluid
progression inhale your back flat
i'm going to speak to you a lot so that
you can verbally hear what's happening
as you work in your space maybe if
you're not always seeing the screen
you're holding in a forward fold four
counts push your knees straight
wherever you are bend your knees and
round up
as you round up let your arms just reach
overhead
we're gonna do rolling hangovers they
look like this drop
drops you can watch me one or two times

notice i added a little jump that's an
option
that's not um that's not required it's
not better

two more just like that exhale as you
round down

cardiovascular work
exhale on the up push your sit bones

abdominal muscles
and your hips and when we do that

burning mode

lower
you have the option to bring your hands
to prayer make sure you feel your arms

if you're feeling it in your knees at
all push your pinky dough's
toes rather down a little more and even
if you have shoes on

specific sculptural way with these
weights

position with breath
your abdomen activates bring your arms
up and back
re-tuck your tail bring your right arm
down
in front of or behind your thigh what

shoulder bones
it's all facing forward in parallel
lines
and your deep stomach tissue wrapping in
change sides

word seven from there
both arms come back tuck your hips eight
times
and four five six
seven stay low bring your arms forward
but keep your back engaged
lower down bring your hip and punch
other side

waistline in pulsing last sixteen then
we hit the floor
three four drop your shoulders
but lift your heart lasting your hands
can be lower on hips
you're at three four lower with your six
bones
seven stand up round forward
then from here rotate over
to one toe bring your arm up
exhale through center other side
we recognize the power of stretch
then from here bring your hip bones down
take a moment breathe in deeply
exhale surrender sit bones back up
heel toe your feet in round up
let's hit the floor so come on down
into our more traditional abdominal
crunchwork
so we are now more connected to your
lowest stomach muscles
deepest ones so as you come back
find a space where you can reconnect
with breath to the muscles inside your
body so the pelvic floor put your legs
tight together squeeze and grip your
glutes
eight more times keep your shoulders
down
your hands are in this position whether
you have weights or not
now go side other side
you are on your six bones keep going if
you're feeling really connected
i'm just going to address a couple
things that may feel
like you need some support so if you're
too far low you're going to feel it in
your next you want to come up a little
higher
if you're too high up there's no
connectivity against gravity to your
abdomen there's a sweet spot in between
keep twisting option add your arms so
just an option and if you add the arm
go over your knee not wider than that's
on purpose
we're maintaining the connectivity to
your internal obliques
so those narrow v muscles
here's another option your legs can be a
little bit longer
everybody's hips are different get to
know your hips
find spaces to adjust so you can get
back to the muscles that matter
right now it's your stomach stretch or
your feet
are on the floor four more than a change
we're at two
that's three and four
now arms up out to second position
forward and exhale
arms face each other palms up to the
ceiling
scooping forward with soft elbows and
hold
two more slow arms up arms out
scoop forward and hold one more
arms up arms out
scoot forward option bring your legs up
then from there little pulls in last 16
counts then we stretch
we're at one two three
here's another option five six
seven here's another option last eight
one
two three four
five six seven release
put your weights to the side so the cool
thing
about having these virtual opportunities
to work out together
especially when they're saved like this
one with pop sugar is that
exhale options mean
you can come back on a different day and
check it out
so you tried arms one way today and the
next time maybe you try them another way
and this is how we grow and develop then
from here
roll down to your back bring your right
ankle over your opposite mid thigh
rotate your hip open option come to a
figure four
option straighten your leg take another
big breath
and release down other side
other leg up rotate flexion through your
foot
from your hip bone bend your knee come
on down
draw your leg in take a moment
option straight leg but keep your foot
active and flexed
then from there back down legs to your
chest
tuck your chin and roll up face me
take your right hip down to the floor
and your right shin bone
up towards your collarbone bring your
other leg out and lengthen
stack so your first priority is stacking
the joints
not getting lower it's stacking inhale
open hearted
exhale you can bring your chest forward
a little bit or a lot
take another breath send violet light to
the space it feels resistant and
recognize
that resistance is just the way the body
speaks and says i need a little more
attention
other side so we honor that
it's kind of like if you tried to tell
somebody something and every time you
tried to tell them something that was
real important
or you felt was really important they
just shut you down before you could even
finish your sentence
and sometimes when our body speaks to us
we'll have a tendency to shut it down
before it can finish its sentence and
eventually
it stops trying to talk to us we want to
keep that communication
open so where is your body talking to
you right now
wherever that is breathe towards it
soften
into it and just listen
let it spin roll back up
bring your legs out to a wide straddle
posture flex your feet once more
that create support for your knees and
heal your arm up and over
take a deep breath and let that breath
fill your lungs all the way down into
your hips
exhale up other side up and over take a
long
deep breath it's okay
and then come back up crush your legs
roll your shoulders back a couple times
we're gonna leave each other with energy
so as you inhale bring your arms out and
up
as you exhale bring your hands down to
prayer
and in this moment in this moment where
you're connected
and you're getting ready to walk back
out into this beautiful world
do you have a vision or a goal for the
day bring your hands to your heart to
feel
if it doesn't immediately come up if
your heart doesn't immediately speak
that's okay maybe it'll talk a little
later
inhale open up
and remember the jump is so frightening
between where i
am and where i want to be but because of
all i may become
i will close my eyes and leap
spread your wings leap towards that goal
that dream that purpose that moment
inhale
deeply exhale your hands to the earth
always let her catch you when you fall
open your eyes to the sun
and be in the light i'm gonna come say
