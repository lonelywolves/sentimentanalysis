hey guys welcome to the new classified
sugar my name is charlie atkins and i
have a 20 minute hit class that is going
to make you strong
and sweatier than ever this session is
sponsored by under armour
you don't need any equipment for this
workout so let's head right into the
warm-up
let's go ahead and get started with some
bounces so all i want you to do is stay
in place
and you're just bouncing on the balls of
your feet if you have a cranky neighbor
you don't have to leave the ground but
if you can add a little bit more
movement
i highly recommend it if you want to
start to chug your shoulders just
warming the body up so this is going to
be good for our ankles a great warm-up
to do
if you plan on doing a hit workout
that's going to involve
some movement so if you want to take the
bounces a little bit quicker
just staying right here in place
good from here we're going to move into
an upper body warm up what i like to
call
a t-pole so you're just going to stay
right here in place and then all i want
you to do is pull twice with your elbows
bent
and then open up the arms wide with a
straight arm so all i'm doing is
opening up my chest reaching
you can take these at whatever temple
feels comfortable for you one thing i do
want you to notice
is that you're not really popping open
the chest like this you want to take it
nice and controlled
think about pulling the shoulder blades
together behind you as opposed to really
spreading the chest
now go ahead and stay in this position
where the feet are about hip distance
apart
and then all we're going to do is reach
forward and backwards as you start to
rotate through the upper
spine or the thoracic spine if you want
to have some fun with it you can kind of
wind the arms or if you feel comfortable
you're just reaching forwards
and backwards just alternating sides
keep the feet where they are
if you do want to add the rotations just
for a little bit more shoulder mobility
you can
but keep the knees slightly bent so you
want the knees kind of loose
allowing you to rotate through the upper
spine so through the
like we said that thoracic fine area
from here we're going to be heading into
a hip mobility drill so it's a leg
cradle
so all you're going to do is grab same
side shin reach across the body
and pull the bottom part of the shin
across the body if it's helpful
sometimes
it's nice to walk while you do it so if
you want to turn sideways on your mat
you can
or if you want to stay in place just go
ahead and alternate legs
trying to stay upright as you pull the
shin into the chest
and then a little bit of rotation by
pulling the ankle towards the opposite
side
[Music]
good from here we're going to come into
our inchworm
plus a spider so a lot of movement
interim hips stay high
walk walk walk once you're in push-up
plank position just bring knee
towards elbow and then walk right back
up
so kind of a full body movement that we
have happening here
you don't need to do these fast you can
do them nice and slow and controlled
trust me the rest of the class is going
to be pretty quick tempo so you might as
well enjoy
going slow and controlled for this
moment right here
in that push-up plank position make sure
that the shoulders are over the wrist
and one thing i want you to be aware of
is if you're walking don't let your
fingertips point sideways
allow the fingertips to point forward if
you do notice your fingertips are
pointing sideways just bend your knees a
little bit more
as you start to do that walk out let's
do one more
good coming right back up
so i want you just to stay in place
right here bring opposite knee opposite
arm up
but really focus on staying straight
driving that leg down into the ground so
i'm trying to stay upright
like i'm doing a very active march if
you want a little bit more movement
because this is a hit class then i want
you to move with me
and turn it into a skip so all these
exercises we're going to do
twice through i call this the dynamic
warm-up which means i want you to start
to feel the body kind of kick up as far
as intensity goes
10 more seconds see if you can really
hop or push
yourself off the ground good
pick up three two one reverse lunges
so go ahead and take the first few slow
and controlled
and then remember the working leg is the
front leg so i'm not pushing off the
back leg
i'm pushing through the ground with that
front leg to kind of give me
as much motion through the hips as i can
and i'm just alternating one side
and then the other reaching back
trying to get that back knee to kiss the
ground so i really want to make sure
that i have
full mobility to bring the knee all the
way down
you're bringing the knee down is
challenging for right now that's
definitely something that i recommend
working towards
some hit for going videos will help you
get there but touching the knee all the
way down to the ground
is going to show you that you have nice
healthy hips
that can handle anything let's go ahead
and come
into down dog leg lifts so coming here
into
playing position bend the knees push the
tailbone
to the sky and then you're just gonna
lift one heel up to the sky
and then the other
so push push the hands into the ground
almost like you're sliding
into home plate reaching the heel up to
the sky
and trying to put your toe let's do flex
foot
that's going to give us more glue
activation or more booty activation
good 10 more seconds and we're going to
take this into another core
exercise on the mat so in our dynamic
warm ups
we want to be hitting all of the muscle
groups that we'll be using for the
actual
workout let's go ahead and lie down on
the ground we're gonna be doing bicycles
one thing i want you to do is opposite
elbow opposite knee use the opposite
elbow
as a kickstand now in my bicycles i
think that it's more challenging
and better for control to lay flat
and then have the core strength to pull
me all the way up
so i want you to try the same thing
using that opposite elbow as a kickstand
keeping the chest open meaning i don't
want your elbows
to come in like this good let's go ahead
and come on up to standing
so active march or if you're in for the
hit
you're turning it into a skip if skips
are boring for you
you want to add more to it
all you got to do is move side to side
so we call this a lateral skip
requires a little bit of hand eye
coordination
you're just moving side to side and
we're going to do those
reverse lunges again
[Applause]
[Music]
two one remember you're really trying to
get that back knee to kiss the ground
reason being is because we want to make
sure that our joints are healthy
so if i have the ability and the
strength to get that back knee all the
way down to the ground
i know that all these lunges and squats
are paying off because i got hip
mobility
as well as hip strength letting that
back knee kiss the ground
standing upright by punching the ground
through that front heel
so the back leg is just a kickstand
good stick with me we're almost there
we've got about 10 seconds left
of our alternating reverse lunge and
then we're going to head into those down
dog
leg lifts before we come into our down
dog leg lifts i want you to
fully exhale take a new breath in and
then head down
make sure that we're breathing in these
workouts so bend the knees push the
table into the sky
push push the hands into the earth like
you're sliding into home plate
and then lift one heel up to the sky and
then the other
[Music]
you can have a micro bend in the knees
if the hamstrings are tight
but what i don't want in a downward
facing dog because i don't want an arch
back so that you can have straight legs
i'd rather you have bent legs
and a straight back
[Music]
we've got bicycles coming in hot after
this
good almost there
give me one more on each leg and then
let's go ahead and
come down onto the mat flipping over
onto your back
using that opposite elbow
as it kicks down if you notice my toe is
also pulled towards my shin as i lift up
just feels better on the hip flexors
than if i had a pointed toe
you want to try both just to notice the
difference i think that you might find
that the toe puller pulled towards the
shin just feels a lot better
and a lot stronger throughout this
exercise keep the elbows open
keep using your opposite elbow as it
kicks down
good let's go ahead and come on up to
standing and we're going to head into
our next round of exercises
so we're just going to do a squat with a
knee up the goal is to have the ability
to balance on one leg
while you're also doing a squat hands go
behind the head you're just going to
come down
bring opposite elbow towards the
opposite knee so similar to the bicycle
crunch but now
we're just adding a squat so whenever
you do bring that opposite elbow towards
opposite knee they don't need to touch i
just want you to have the ability
to balance on one leg whenever you do
have the hands behind the back or behind
the head
make sure that the chest and the heart
is staying up
these don't need to be rushed these
don't need to be fast you can do them
nice and slow and controlled trying to
see if you can improve
the depth of your squat as you lower
down
so main cue in a squat is the knees
drive away from each other
as you lower down and as you come up
good give me one more on each side and
then let's go ahead and move into our
butt kicks
so you're just essentially dragging in
place but you're giving your heel
the target of your booty so that we can
stretch out the front side of our hips
now you can pump your arms if you'd like
or you can put your hands behind your
hips giving your heels a target
but the goal is to bring the heart rate
up any hit class on a scale of one to
ten
i want you to feel like you are at a
seven or eight
six seven or eight are all good levels
to be that would be 60 70 80 percent of
your max
exertion good let's go ahead and start
to come down to the mat take a breath
out
holding yourself in push-up plank
position the wider your feet are the
more balanced you're going to have
and then all i want you to do is bring
elbow to the sky
wrist to the rib without rotating the
body so what i don't want you to do
is i don't want you to twist okay keep
the shoulders and the hips facing the
mat the entire time
straight line from my head all the way
to my hips and from my hips all the way
to my heels
good trying to keep the energy and the
intensity up
we're going to come right back up to
standing one more on each side
coming up into jumping tracks
reminding you again on a scale of one to
ten
i want you feeling like you're a six
seven or an eight
if you're anything below that pick up
the intensity
as soon as we finish with these jumping
jacks we're going to come right into a
knee driver
so balancing on my left leg i'm just
going to drive
this right knee into chest keeping a
straight line from my head to my
tailbone
balancing on one leg feeling my booty
fire up and i'm just driving that right
knee into my chest
in about 10 seconds ish we're gonna head
right back into jumping jacks give me
five more seconds keep driving the knee
in
and then go ahead and come into your
jumping jacks and we'll do the exact
same thing
on the left side
now if you don't want to do jumping
jacks or you have grumpy neighbors you
can always tap one foot and then the
other
but keep a super active arm
keep moving with me we're almost there
right into those knee drivers okay
let's do three two and one
set it up knee drives in
if you want more reach for the sky
pull those arms down over that knee it's
quick but you got this
keep going all the way to the end do
three more with me three
two one keep your heart up keep your
chest up lowering down
balancing on one leg bringing two limbs
together
while still having the ability to
balance on one leg right
[Music]
i like to use exhales as i bring
everything together in the center
and then seeing if i can get deeper in
my squats without letting
my body crash down so that's the main
thing my heart has to stay up
driving my knees away from each other
good nice
stay breathing one more on each side
good
and then you're headed right into those
butt kicks
[Music]
so you can put your hands behind your
booty targeting the heels you can pump
the arms like you're running in place
scale of 1-10 i'm going to say i'm going
to constantly keep reminding you
of where you're at in intensity so that
we can make sure that you leave this
workout feeling stronger
and sweatier almost there
now we're gonna be heading down to the
mat after this for those plank rows
plank rows target our core
and our arms good deep breath in
side up come on down to the mat now if
you find that you're tipping the body
too much just go wider stance take your
feet further
away from each other spread the chest on
each pull
keep the shoulder out of the ears try
not to rock the body
the wider my feet are the more stability
i'll have
so if i want to challenge myself i'm
going to bring my feet in
a little bit more narrow
all right these exercises that we're
doing they're the meat and potatoes
that's what i like to call them
they're meat and potatoes of the workout
they're supposed to be challenging
we're trying to make ourselves push and
fight
right back into your jumping jacks
these exercises they're only seconds
seconds less than a minute all of them
and we're just moving from one
right into the next
[Music]
getting ready to head into those knee
drivers i gave you two options
you can what i like to call lassoing the
cloud you're reaching up towards the
cloud and you're pulling it
over your knee or you're just driving
your knee in your chest
with some upper body movement right
almost there
good right into your jumping jacks going
to do the left side
modification for jumping jack remember
you don't have to hop the feet in and
out you can step
but i want active arms
scalable to ten checking in with
yourself
making sure it's a challenge for you
almost there
we're gonna head right into those knee
drivers you're going to love it
here we go so make sure you're planted
on that leg
you can do hands at chest just driving
the knee and you want a bigger bang for
your buck
one rep right after the other
keep going give me five more seconds
three two one
ah so bad that's the heart rate pumping
all right new set of exercises same
thing two times through
we are just thinning a lot of exercises
in 20 minutes
so that we can be good to go for the day
first exercise drop squat go ahead and
join in with me now if you'd like
now all i'm doing is hopping my feet in
and out reaching for the ground
if reaching for the ground is a
challenge just reach right in between
the calves i'd rather you have a nice
stable
bottom meaning having the ability to
hinge by pushing my tablet back
keeping my heart up then trying to touch
the ground
and really going like that so you're
making it active
making it look good
almost there three two
one come down to the mat but first take
a breath
good come on down now from here super
classic hip raise
lifting hips up pausing at the top
letting the lower back kiss the mat
i want you to connect and exhale with
each exercise or with each rep
breathe all the way out before you bring
the hips down
that should help you feel this in your
booty which is where we want it
keep going
[Music]
you got less than 10 seconds
still breathing good all right
coming on up into push-up plank position
we're going to be doing an upper body
exercise
start down on the mat reach pull push
reach pull push now if you feel like you
want to do them from your knees
i want to challenge you to use as much
strength as you can to do them from your
feet
training yourself how to do these proper
push-ups off your feet
versus always doing them from the knees
building up the upper body strength it's
a short amount of time
good set this up
[Music]
and then all i want you to do is reach
one arm out and then the other try not
to let the body rock
so when i say don't let the body rock i
mean don't dip
and reach dip and reach you want to keep
a stable
solid foundation
keep going three two
and one all right final round of
exercises
you've already done them you're gonna do
them again
reaching the tailbone back and hinging
if i can't touch the ground without
rounding my upper back then i'd rather
just reach in between my legs for what
i'm able to
pushing the tailbone back making sure
that this exercise looks strong
as opposed to owie right
keep going scale of one to ten check in
where you're at
go ahead almost there
coming down to the mat take a breath
before you go down there now come down
remember full exhales
to get me to the top of that hip brace
really blowing the air out i like to
call it the birthday candle breath
you pretend you're blowing birthday
candles out
trying to get as much air out of you as
you can focusing
on building the booty also think about
keeping your toes pressed into the mouth
up good
perfect flip it over push up reaches
thumbs should be in the armpits elbows
are at a 45 degree angle
i like to start down first reach pull
push
reach pull push
when i lower down my elbows are pointing
back at a 45 degree angle
what i don't want is a t or an eye i
want them at a 45 degree i'll think of
an a
with your elbows
[Music]
keep the core and the glutes engaged as
you push yourself up that's going to
help you get into that
good all right final exercise of the set
we're gonna do those plank reaches
targeting the core targeting the balance
here we go
finishing up nice and strong the wider
my feet are
the more balance and stability i have if
my booty is up in the air it's not
challenging my core
so i'm going to make sure that i have a
straight line for my head
all the way to my heels
oh yeah keep it going almost there
10 seconds away stay with me to the end
good let's do four three
two and one
there's 20 minutes let me take you
through a quick stretch that you're
feeling like you could use one
let's start with down dog it's a nice
stretching active stretch pose
give me five breaths inhale
so push the hands into the ground almost
like you're sliding into home
plate reaching the heart for the shoe
laces
relax the jaw good
now make sure your hands are settled
you're just gonna reach the right leg up
bend the right knee
take the right knee through three
circles forwards
[Music]
and three circles back
good go ahead and come to a kneeling
position but that right leg is going to
come forward
and then all i'm going to do is extend
the left left leg back
and you're in this low lunge and we're
just going to spin open so that the
heart is facing that front thigh
if you want to drop the back knee you
can but if you feel like you're getting
more of an active stretch by having the
back leg elevated go ahead and stay
there
okay go ahead and drop the back knee
down you're going to place both hands
down we're gonna come back to a downward
facing dog
[Music]
bend the left leg three circles forwards
[Music]
three circles backwards
good come down to your knees
pull that left leg forward straighten
that back leg you've got that
active low runner stretch low lunge
spinning towards it or if you feel more
comfortable dropping the back knee down
whatever makes more sense for you
[Music]
but from this we're going to end up
pivoting our toes forwards
so we come into this wide-legged
straddle forward fold
if you feel like you're having trouble
reaching the ground i just want you to
press on your thighs
so that you have a nice flat back you
can press on your shins
but don't worry about touching the
ground if it's a little difficult to
touch today as long as you have a nice
flat back
[Music]
now from there you're going to toe heel
the feet together
so you're in a wide stance and then if
you can we're just going to come down to
a
low squat yogi squat
pressing the elbows into the knees if
your booty is up here
you can take a wide stance and then i
just want you to kind of rotate
side to side if you're in yogi squat you
can reach one arm up to the sky
and then the other just getting a little
bit more
rotation otherwise whatever stretch
you're in start to toe heel the feet
back together
bend the knees and then you're gonna
roll yourself all
the way up roll the shoulders back at
the top
if you can spread open the chest clasp
the hands behind you opening up the
heart
you can't clasp the hands just reach the
arms behind you really think about
spreading the chest pulling the
shoulders
away from the ears
[Music]
i hope you're feeling stronger and
sweatier than ever thank you so much for
working out with me in under armour and
i'll see you at the next classified
sugar workout
soon
