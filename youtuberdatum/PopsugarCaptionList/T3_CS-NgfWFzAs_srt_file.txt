hi welcome to our 30 minute
youtube popsugar bar class
so not necessarily in that order welcome
i've been reading your comments
i really i recognize so many of you
kevin kevin
f hi oh it's steph oh i got you okay
great
um i'm loving reading your comments and
for those of you that i don't know or
that haven't
um done this workout with me yet my name
is marny elton i'm the founder of mbody
by marnie alton
and the workout today is going to be a
low impact bar workout so the only
equipment you're going to need
is going to be a stable surface or a
ballet bar so
what that can be for you is the back of
the couch
or a chair back or a countertop
i love something that can be stable so
if you do pick a chair make sure it's
one that's quite heavy
and if not just finding something close
to your waist height
and that's going to happen for probably
about half the class we're not even
going to hit the floor for knees or
anything
so if you don't have a mat you don't
even need that and shoes are also
optional so the way that we train
is typically barefoot unless your
sensitivity changes that for you
so the reason that we train barefoot is
so that we recognize that life does not
end
at our ankles and that there is some
stretch and strengthening happening
through your foot as well so that's what
a dancer does and we're going to do that
we'll warm up your feet
and we'll move through i'll give you
options i'll start all of the exercises
showing the no
impact option and then i'll add on some
low impact options so nothing's going to
be
too intense no giant jumps but we're
definitely going to do small sautes and
jet days
just to keep the feet and your body
active to activate through your core so
we get some standing core work as well
but mindful that that mild impact is
only optional and i'll be really clear
about it as well
also this workout will be saved to pop
sugar's youtube channel so
if you're loving some of the
choreography and we're moving through it
and you're like i want to revive or like
revisit that check that out
feel free to do it you can go back and
redo the workout over and over
um anything that you want also if you
need to find me or if you need more
information you can find me
at embody by marny alton that's on
instagram
marnyelton on instagram and you can find
me at mbody online we have a seven day
free trial right now
so if you love this workout come get
your free trial alrighty
let's do this so what you want to do
is really just find yourself in the room
and what that means is
notice your floor notice how far your
walls are from you notice you can reach
up you have some space here
and then tune into your body so you
start feeling that all that tightness
and tension in your shoulders has an
opportunity to just sort of release down
we hold on to things quite tightly right
we hold on to patterns and habits
sometimes old relationships
old ideas sometimes we just kind of hold
on for dear life
let's shake that out and then once
you've got the shoulders and hands soft
with the jaw
start thinking about relax start
thinking about relaxing your hips
and really letting a rotation of your
inner thigh
turn your knee out as you bounce from
foot to foot very lightly
take two big breaths one more big breath
so we're oxygenating and opening up your
low abdominal cavity
turn your feet parallel hinge at your
hips
now you want to pull your heart forward
and your sit bones back
eight counts one two speed that run up
it is this vibration that creates the
heat
that is going to get you strong and your
legs tight together
bring your feet all the way to touch
inhale your arms skyward
keep your heart up bring your hands down
behind you square your hips and
shoulders
bring your right foot forward flex your
foot oh catch yourself
point your foot one more time that's the
beauty of this single leg balance
your body will still calibrate it'll
start activating
in the spaces that may still be asleep
so wake up
circle your foot one way circle it the
other way
touch your feet to the floor inhale your
arms skyward drop your shoulders hold to
your right wrist
you want to stretch to the side of your
body so we can be dynamic
tuck under more really bend into it
surrender to the side
other arm so you hold to your wrist to
feel that you're lifting out of your hip
and then bend to the side tuck under if
you're just joining us
welcome you've never met me before my
name is marny elton we're doing a low
impact 30 minute bar workout today
opening your throat so this can feel
a little vulnerable emotionally
sometimes think of this
center right where your heart and your
lungs live where your throat is
these are all vulnerable but powerful
areas we need to open them up
so this is one option what i'm doing
with my hand saying that if that's good
for you
choose option to bring your hands to
your low back pull your elbows in
or reach your hands to the floor if it's
better for your neck to tuck your chin
keep it tucked
otherwise open up together let's
surrender four counts one
so we stayed a little longer in this
today to really get the mobility
reach forward and down bend one knee and
the other
shake and nod your head can you feel a
release of tension between your shoulder
blades
inhale your back flat push your sit
bones out prioritize keeping your knees
straight
and your spine long maybe your hands to
your thighs bend your
chest forward tuck your chin so your
forehead comes closer towards your legs
bend your knees keeping that round shape
roll up until you're straight bring your
arms overhead
oxygenate with a big gulp of air then
breathe out as you drop
so if this is your first time doing a
rolling hangover with me this is one of
our
embody signature moves that jump that i
just did
that is only optional so this class will
have
an option to be done fully low impact
and even no impact
but i'll give you little soft landings
as an option throughout
one of four so i'm showing you both
alternating that's two
you're at three one more
bring your arms out to second position
and touch your heels to first
then from there roll to your right
toenails and bring your right arm up
stretch from your toe to your hand and
other side
so we're really acknowledging the
importance of your foot
and that denser stretch through the
joints of your toes the metatarsals
in the bones of your feet open up right
leg out touch your heels eight times
two so you're warming up the hinge of
your ankle five
as you keep both knees straight and use
your stomach to maintain the alignment
of your hips
bring your arms down bra ba other side
catch your heels eight times
three press your shoulders down from
your ears this is where we acknowledge
the inner denser
plie then from there bring your arms to
fifth
shift your feet parallel lift your heels
up and down
so these calf raises strengthen your
calf
but they're also stretching up the back
of your leg and activating your glutes
and your core
if it feels too sensitive to have your
arms what's called fifth position
bring them down to prayer and press your
shoulders away from your ears eight more
here's a fun fact your calf is actually
the muscle responsible
for pumping blood from your low body to
your heart so hold and feel your calf
spread your toes can you feel air
between the webbing
really expanding the roots of your body
eight counts one
two three four we're gonna dance in a
second
six step your feet out a little bit
wider drop down
first priority really important is that
your toes
your shoulders your hips and your knees
are faced forward
second feel that all four corners of
your foot
are really gripping the floor big toe
pinky toe
inner heel outer heel that's how we're
going to stay safe around the knee
as we get a little deeper next thing to
check out keep your heart up drop
lower so your hands can go to your legs
you're hinging at your hips without
rounding your back
you can bring your hands all the way
forward and back that's the dance is an
option
here's a leg option go down right leg up
so now we're warming up from the medial
to the lateral line
through your hips four more keep your
knee bent
we're at two that's three
now pull your right leg back then left
so here's no impact
you're just kicking up to length in the
front of your thigh activate your glutes
or add a little bounce that's just an
option eight times one
two word four
six seven bring your right knee up
up now breathe out as that happens
option add a little jump
four times one two three
switch sides sending me a soft
or a little jump eight two
bring your knees slightly higher we're
at six
then from there one than the other arm
up so that's the option with no impact
sensitive shoulders no impact or
straight up
that's a little more bounce for the
fascia
fat sensitive shoulders with impact
eight more
four we're gonna start at the top
feet wide in parallel drop low
so prioritize those points of reference
we spoke of
option had your leg four times one
high up word three
knees back back option no impact
exhale on the back right knee up
four counts one two change sides
so going a little quicker through it
this in the next time
and then either out and in or single
arms
or cross ain't more than our last round
here
two we want to feel the red you always
use light therapy at the end body
move down it's to acknowledge
the energy around us this is red light
energy option as your legs
that's courage that's fire
that's auctioning in your blood now pull
back for
eight three of eight choose no impact
but that's better
right leg up four two
and switch four
now arms out and up just press
or choose your option last 16 counts
one two now
if your arm's going up or to the side
keep your shoulders pulling back
two of eight three four five
six seven step out
turn your knees out bend your knees
opening your throat first thing to check
is that we're in
alignment in second position so lift
your right heel now
you feel like you're sliding out which
may translate into some tension on your
inner upper hip insertion
with your heel relative you should have
your knees still wide as your ankle
okay so not more narrow try it on the
other side
then from there alternate and then as
you work your feet
and you check that your turnout is
aligned to your second or third toe
the next thing we want to recognize is
that you don't drop the crown
you keep it skyward and we don't harden
or hide your heart the heart stays open
thinking about that how we arrive center
stage
strong elegant open and connected
four more now keep both heels down keep
the pulse
arms back there's flicking your wrist
behind you
really pushing into the four corners of
your foot again eight more
two word four
bend your elbows then straighten them
eight times one
that's two a little activation of the
bicep and triceps
continual wrapping of your rib cage in
continual exhale from the power of your
stomach
now from their hold how far can you
stretch your fingers
so you find yourself opening up bring
your right arm overhead
back to that stretch center
push your knees back further eight more
two we're at three
four more like that fives
six that's seven
now from there bend your elbows pull
your knees
behind you pull your elbows back 16
times
so we're about to move to the valet bar
get close to it if you're not there yet
eight more we're preparing your postural
body
for the dance we're about to do so your
back stays active and strong
bring your inner hand to the ballet bar
outer arm up
sink into your power so we get low
then we come to passe low
arabic behind you down
up both knees bend
bar legs straightens two more slow
so what we've done thus far in this
workout is
created a pattern and we've built on a
foundation
and this way your body is learning so
this lasts beyond this moment
option down up now if this speed up
sped up pace isn't of service to you
and it either frustrates you or it takes
you out of the moment
go slow again and then come back to the
workout
and try it quick perhaps on a different
day
here's another option releve on your
passette releve
arabesque one of four big gelatic
stretch
two feeling that red
from your feet to your hands three
hold here hold lengthening your chest
then from there feels that you have a
string elevating your heart
your foot point is lift up 16 times
a little lift up of your leg
so we're also creating flexibility such
important flexibility
for your spine eight more you can use
this outer hand to press your hip down
five six you're at seven
hold it up re-tuck your tail that's a
bar
term and really think about it like okay
that a tail took it under my legs
that's that sensation it releases
tension in your low back
creates duality for your glutes hold
four counts
two three flex your foot pull your heel
into your seat
stretch it out pull up
if you don't have a ballet bar you can
be doing this with a chair
you can be doing this with the back of
the couch you can do this with a counter
so you all of those choices you can also
if you really have nothing like
i've done this in rooms where i don't
like hotel rooms when traveling
so this work can be done continue this
motion
against a wall so what we're seeking is
simply something to provide
a sense of stability for more like that
the other option is to play around with
no
ballet bar that's playful
two more like that keep your hip bones
squared
one more just like that now point your
foot
tap your foot to the floor then up up
so what you're feeling or what we're
looking to feel is a small
turn out of your knee but a forward face
meaning of your hip because the rotation
happens in a hip socket which is a ball
and socket joint
which it's naturally meant to do 16 more
one
two three four five
six seven just eight more just like that
it's one
two three four five
six seven bring your leg behind you
in a deep curtsy lunge lift your chest
pull your back knee up
now this time you want to stay real low
in that front leg
pull this hip behind you so you're not
reaching forward over your toes
last 16 count one two
this pull of your elbow is pumping blood
through your heart and getting your
oblique last eight this bend of your
knee
is building bone density and creating
strong lean legs
seven step out change your ballet bar to
the other side
or simply flip around i just want to do
balance on the other side
start out in second position open
through your throat
down hold there find the four corners of
your feet
alternate heel less so now we've already
spent time
getting the stretch and the posture
eight more
one so we get it more quickly on this
side
and once we've got that we can add on
then from there
leg back center other leg back
that's the dance try that eight more
times
one and two
now if you want more challenge if you
want brighter red get lower five
six two more one more like that
put your knees and arms back as you
breathe out
option as you pull your arms and legs
back we add that bicep extension
one two three eight four of eight
five six seven
now just press back here are your three
options before we hit the ballet bar for
our final series
dancing through the other side so you
want to find another peak
if this is your peak stay in it stay in
control
your peak is on releve perhaps using the
valet bar stay in it
if impact is good for your body then you
have the option final 16 crosses we go
out in two of h so you choose what's
right for your body
that's the cool thing about working that
at home
you just got yourself it's you against
you and you
always win six seven
lend hold feel that heat that mobility
down low pass a
find the control arabesque
three more slow passay up
and then down arabesque
two more slow down pass it up
down our best
one more slow pass a
lower stay slow or dance it out
down up and arabesque
your priority is maintaining
that dancer's energy that lift of your
crown option rel of a
up on your passe
and lifting your chest but not your
shoulders four more
that's one
we're at two can you get a little lower
because that gets
an active dynamic stretch as well so
we're always sculpting sweating
and stretching every class with me
we spray your hips lift your leg up and
down sixteen times
keep your standing knees soft feel the
energy of red pulling up on your inner
thighs you're not collapsing
eight more in that hole
keep your foot pointed then from there
hold here
re-drop your hip pull your belly back in
hold that as without unleashing that
push your knee back until you feel it
catching your glutes that's your glute
flexor foot straighten good aim
flexed foot affects the musculature of
your legs to hips to abs to shoulders
differently than a pointed foot we need
bugs
i love working barefoot pull point your
foot little eyes
up can you tap the floor and like a top
back up sixteen times
now thinking about how long
you can make the space from your low rib
out your toe
and then if your arm is up how long you
can make your space from your rib to
your hand
pull that deep bend flap to fourth
position
bend your standings where both knees are
bent bring your outer arm up here's our
finale
up exhale staying nice and low
and the detail is that weight is in your
front right toe sixteen times
two three four
remember heart stays open last eight one
two three four five
six seven step out
play down bring your right shoulder down
enjoy that sensation
bring your other shoulder down just
stretch
expand then from here
open through your throat open through
your chest
we're gonna start the cool down but
still have energy
hips to the side then the other
so we're starting a little bit of a cool
down we'll have one more moment of flush
but we're coming out of the red one than
the other
eight more like that one so this
internal rotation
has been empowered by the ballet bar
four more five we're at six
that's seven hold here
if you need to return to your bar for
some stability go for it
otherwise just tuck your hips tuck
option pull your elbows back
eight times so now these tucks
that heat that we made they're helping
to elongate this hip
pull down down hold one of four
down down hold to a four
so we're still using the contraction of
the musculature
to pump through your low body stay low
lift your front heel and lower one of
four
there's only four we're trying to change
the patterns to keep your mind engaged
with your body
get your heel up see if that feels good
re-tuck your hips so you get that
stretch
lower down and up just 16 more like this
one here's sensitive shoulder
modification for modification
low heel or to the valet bar eight more
one
two three four five
six seven rotate down or four times
internal rotation
three four change sides pause
so it's just a little lace tuck your
hips
so you just lace to the other side if
you had a little pop
if you missed it you didn't miss
anything a more one
you can catch it the next time three
four
five reminding your upper back to be
strong
option arm up lift remember option to
find your ballet bar or wall
we want the small muscles to work but
not be burdened
pulse pulse hold one of four
down down hold to a four
on the hold imagine a golden cloak
wrapping you
through your ribs low stomach and
between your shoulders
just down and up to finish and it is
that wrap
that really ignites that elegant posture
lasts 16 counts
so the upper body is blue while the
lower body refines its fire
eight more counts one two
three this is the end before your
stretch five
six seven rotate out
and then from here bend your knees
just take a moment and with your knees
bent
opening your throat exhale you can bring
your hands up as well
really feeling that stretch across your
chest
hold four more counts one two
three and then from here lengthen your
right leg out
pause in that position option to draw
your other knee back behind you
now playful we're hanging out here for
about 10 more seconds
because of the necessity to stretch this
hamstring muscle that lives right from
the knee up to your head
so playing around here's another option
if you have like a stool
or a chair press down on that to lift
your chest
then if you're really quite easily in
this posture playfully
so not like forcefully but playfully see
what a bind
looks or feels like and then turn
towards the bent knee
so now you're in parallel stretch your
back leg so that there's an energy of
light out the sole of your foot or
roll to the base of your thigh muscle
quadricep muscle so not the knee bone
but tucked forward we used those tucks
those dancers tuck they serve us here as
well
from either knee to the earth or knee
lifted bring your arms overhead
with your hands facing forward pull your
elbows down and open your throat
re-tuck your hips hold for four one two
three take a deep inhale as you breathe
out bring your hands forward and down
then shift back now here's another cool
way to use a ballet bar or school
or a bench your hands can come to it
and that may lift you pause here
if that's where you feel the most
stretch without sacrificing by bending
so once your
joints bend you lose the stretch of the
musculature and ligaments you want to
keep them all
option just an option
never a half dough always a maybe
always uh my wonder take another big
breath option arms up
exhale reach forward and down hold one
of four
two of four so we held that stretch
for about 45 seconds with a hamstring we
needed that
curl your toes under roll your elbows in
stick your tailbone up inhale as though
there is something drawing your hips
skyward exhale into the stretch
inhale your right leg up point your foot
exhale come on in
now let's remember that long muscles are
strong muscles
and so we really need to reprogram if
the mindset is in any way
speaking to the idea that stretching
is not working out hard enough
stretching is working out
smart it's necessary it's how the
muscles are rebuilt
it's why we don't have to take three
days off because we're sore because the
muscles are trying to do
in three days what could be done in
three minutes of stretch so it's more
efficient
bring your hands back behind you come to
your knees
round up step out to wide second plie
down so we're just moving through the
levels
and now to the other side if you liked
this workout
i have so many more almost 100 videos
that i'm body online
started just a year ago we have a
beautiful community of people a lot of
whom are here
playing around on this side so we have
everything from 10 minute videos to 60
minute videos with equipment no
equipment
intense impact no impact but all based
around
this philosophy of sculpting sweating
and stretching
dancing our way through this life of
facing challenges together
and then from here bring your arms up
pull your elbows back
take a deep breath becoming our best
selves from the inside out and doing the
work that it takes to get
there bring your hands back down
inhale your back flat choose your
surface or not
take another long breath and then choose
where you want to land
i gotta say one more time where you want
to land what feels right for you
so this probably feels really tense and
uncomfortable in which case
you can choose the option to modify or
if you're just holding yourself back and
in fact your body
wants to open up maybe it's allowing it
it's mentally giving it permission then
four more counts one
option if you are in full split to
descend
glide back bring your leg around behind
you
press to your downward facing dog this
inversion is going to bring you much
wellness for the day
inhale your left leg up how high can you
get that beautiful leg as you breathe in
on your exhale come to pigeon
and flex your foot rotate the toenails
of your back foot down
and then explore where the hip opens
so her hips are a very complex part of
the body there are gluteal muscles and
core muscles and leg muscles that all
come together
so we need to ensure that blood flows
there and that we've mobilized
that space and then strengthened around
that space so we can stay dynamic
and then bring your hands underneath
your shoulders press back
come to both knees expand your legs out
into wide straddle
lifting your throat inhale bring your
right arm up bend to the side
we learn to bend so when the winds shift
you don't gotta break sit up tall
inhale up and feel yourself
roll your shoulders back take a deep
breath
healing both your roots that connect you
to the floor
that freedom of movement but control in
your center
and the lift from your heart to the top
of your head
just let your shoulders drop we want to
recognize duality in the body your core
can be strong while your shoulders are
soft
your hips can be open while your back is
lengthened
inhale your arms up bring your hands
down to prayer
rest your prayer on your heart close
your eyes and take a moment of stillness
where you simply recognize again
where you're at you have more surrender
you are more deeply connected and if
nothing else your body has been
energized through oxygen and movement
and as you move through today and maybe
any day
continue to remind yourself that it
doesn't matter
how fast you're going if you're going in
the wrong direction
and it doesn't matter how long it takes
if you're going in the right one
so as you inhale perhaps setting an
intention for the day
what direction ignore the speed
what direction do you want to be moving
today
inhale open your arms up
allow that in deep breath
giving the speed permission to be
whatever it needs to be so long
you're going the right way hands to the
earth let her catch you when you fall
open your eyes to the sun and be in the
light thank you so much for joining me
