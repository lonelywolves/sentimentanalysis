today we're gonna give our legs a rest
and put our arms and abs to the test
not only will you develop strong arms
shoulders and core muscles in this
workout
but your posture will look as solid as
an athlete grab a pair of light free
weights
a medium-sized weight and your bath
towel and let's get to work
all righty you guys ready to work those
arms and those abs we've got
avia over here showing some
modifications and raven is gonna be
working it out with you so we're gonna
start
with some big shoulder circles to warm
up
and get a nice big stretch all the way
through that shoulder girdle think about
really
opening up the chest i love starting
with this one
i like get up in the morning i'm just
like hey
shoulders circle it up good switch
directions go back
the other way take some nice deep
breaths in really start to get the air
flowing through your body
ah yes good big circles
we're gonna start taking it to small
circles now so bring your
arms kind of open here nice and long and
just start to
circle circle little little circles get
the tension going
start to get the blood flowing good
nice big deep breaths
and then switch directions other way
that's it
kind of get your mind focused on what
you got to do today
get your body working a little bit
you're only here for a little moment of
the day
right so really get here be present
you showed up for yourself now fully be
here now we're going to go
arms overhead and let's just do a couple
little circles here
inside like we're washing the ceiling
wash the ceiling little circles
good keep that forward head though so
that you're not looking up and straining
your neck okay
your shoulders should start to be
burning let's go the other way
yes i know this can be like oh is so
easy at first and then you're like
hello hello shoulder i feel you
good job a couple more i think i do baby
talk way more often with since i have a
baby so it's like
yeah sorry guys you get a little baby
talk from anna every once in a while
and relax now we're going to go into
some arms for
a runner arm just like this we're going
to kind of start to pump from the
shoulders
now at first i don't want you to hold on
to any weights but
as you continue to do this warm up you
might start to add
like a two or three pound dumbbell in
the hand to add a little bit more
resistance but right now i just want you
to focus on the movement
right so you're really getting it right
from the shoulder a lot of people end up
doing this
right they're getting a like elbow
workout no not today we're gonna get
shoulders moving as if you're a runner
so drive your elbows back
drive your elbow back good now speed it
up a little bit guys
good yes oh i see raven work it okay
obvious got it
i was a sprinter in high school so i
really feel like i'm back in the day
right now
bring it back yes good and relax
nice now i'm gonna have you grab your
bath towel for this last one
and i want you to grab it at the very
end so as
long as you can get it because this one
is going to be challenging for most
people in the beginning
so if you have a band it might be even
easier but you're taking it from the end
you're going to go in front of your body
you're going to pull that towel apart
and you're going to try to bring it
all the way to the back right go slow at
first because this can feel challenging
sometimes
you know in the beginning so if you do
have a band sometimes it's easier
because the band has a little more
elasticity
good nice i see that good so if you're
feeling like oh i almost don't get there
i almost don't get there
it's okay in the beginning okay so you
can modify it
by going without a towel in the
beginning or you can simply go wider if
you have a longer towel
or maybe a sheet you can use that good
and then we're going to go with a little
bit of a rotation so i want you to come
up over with your left hand around the
back
and come forward with your right arm
good so again your left comes around
you're trying to keep that towel long so
i'm still pulling that towel
apart okay so keep the towel long as if
it was a pvc pipe or something
let's go the other way so let's go the
right arm up and over
good and then the left comes behind and
forward good nice work couple more
let's go one more with the left with the
right coming over the top
all the way back you're gonna have some
healthy shoulders my friends if you
start mastering that
all right go ahead and drop it down
we're gonna start with our first circuit
and what i want you to do for this first
one is grab your light free weights
all right everybody's got a pair of
light free weights anywhere from two to
five pounds is going to be perfect
you're gonna go into a little sumo squat
position to work your legs get your core
involved
and you're just gonna start here by
punching forward so you're doing a nice
reach extending the arm right it doesn't
have to be too high i don't want you
punching upward
i want you punching straight out so i
can see your face
your abs are tight your shoulders are
working here
really warming up now if you wanted to
increase the intensity here
you could go both at the same time
extend
bring it in extend pinch it back yeah
fill this oh yeah and i really want you
to when you pull it
pinch press pitch press
pinch good all right so those shoulders
will get warm really quick
yes how are you feeling obvious if you
want to go lower in that squat you can
feel it through the legs a little bit
more
but today you can also give your legs a
break and you can come up a little
higher
good couple more seconds three
two last one one and relax
now march it out you're on both feet and
you're to do
a travolta all right so arms are up here
at 90 degrees we're staying alive we're
going to bring
one arm across to the hip
and bring it back up to 90 degrees
alternate to the other side
down and up so your elbows stay up at 90
degrees
you're turning your palm down and up and
you're pulling from the back of your
shoulder
now a lot of times i'll challenge myself
by balancing on one foot
this advances the moves because it
really requires a lot more core
balance strength in my shoulders because
now
i'm being pulled as i bring that weight
up and i've got to fight it
fight the resistance and make sure you
switch legs
to get both sides good you guys feel the
burn
yeah back of the shoulders the rotator
cuff
i feel it i'm always challenging my
balance
any chance i get good down up good
get one more seconds two last one
and relax okay now i want you to grab
your heavier weight
set your light weights down we're gonna
go around the world
so you're gonna take that weight with
both hands your feet are about shoulder
width apart
you're gonna bring that weight around
the world draw on a big circle bend the
knees a little bit
so you keep your back nice and straight
and i want you to just slowly rotate
that weight so you're getting all the
angles of the shoulders here
your abs have to work and stabilize you
breathe good you guys look great
nice big circle so the heavier the
weight the harder this is going to be
so if it feels really light right now
maybe grab an eight
pounder if you had a five pounder in
your hand right
you can always increase let's go the
other way
here we go around the world
nice work my shoulders are on fire i am
holding
eight pounds and it feels like 20.
good job you guys you're doing great
breathe it out
shh
[Music]
notice how we're bending the knees we're
letting our back stay nice and straight
last one and relax okay
let's bring it back into that sumo squat
add those punches
i know shoulders are on fire drop it low
here we go punch punch this is your move
to start
if you want to increase the intensity
it's boom and back
punch and squeeze punch and squeeze
oh my gosh my shoulders are crying
you guys are doing great now remember
too with all these moves
you can always drop the weight so if
right now you're like
oh my gosh anna my shoulders are too on
fire i can't keep going
even your arm weight is gonna feel like
a challenge
so you do what you can do here try to
keep it up
breathing it out you can always modify
and go boom one and two
pinching the shoulder back press and
pull
press and pull and relax come on up
travolta time elbows at 90. let's go
knee up bring that arm across
you're just touching that thumb to the
hip and bringing it up
pull from the back of the shoulder and
pinch
down and up down
and up good good keep that breath
flowing i liked hearing that breath from
avia over there
good so what you want to do keep it
flowing
a couple more seconds here and switch
legs if you haven't already
you guys are almost done keep it going
you always want to kind of balance it
off i know
i tend to balance on my left first every
time you might notice
but that's because it's more challenging
on my right got to give it some love
over there
good abs are working because i got my
knee pulled up towards my chest
right so my core is engaged all the time
and relax grab your medium size weight
let's go around the world my friends
last one here
let's go big circle up
down rotate now remember you control
that momentum
so as that weight comes down don't just
let it drop
right it's like oh my gosh thank god
right i want you to go
slow you control the weight you control
the tempo
by keeping that control you're working
your shoulders and your core
let's switch up directions other way
down and up down and up
good
i feel like the down phase is the
hardest because that's where you're
really fighting gravity
trying to avoid letting that weight take
control
and relax all right
one more set of the sumo squat punches
and then we're moving on my friends
you thought you were almost done with
the sumos didn't you i love you this
much okay
we're here we got one more you can do it
breathe breathe
that's it back and forth you might
notice that we're punching
that's because my shoulders are like
done
they're done right now right so it's
like
you got to modify the way that you need
to and if you were doing this workout
over and over again you might be like
here the whole time
i'm going to add a few of those right
now out and
in out and in that's it come on
couple seconds you can do it i feel the
burn yeah
come on two and one
all right good job you guys so now
you're going to come down on one knee if
you need a pillow
or a towel underneath your knee because
they're sensitive grab it now
you're going to take the weight
medium-sized free weight across the body
across the knee that's up and you're
going to come across the chest
i'm going to keep looking towards you
because that's where i want your
eyesight to be here
and then here down and then
up so when i come across my body i'm
stopping the weight at a certain point i
don't want to rotate too far
down and up down
and my arms aren't fully bent right
they're kind of long because i want to
feel that that lever
of that weight pulling me so i'm working
my whole core
and torso here up and down
up and down let's switch legs go on the
other side
lots of stability here the heavier you
go the harder this
is to stabilize
and up and up
good that's it keep your eye line
towards me
try not to keep yourself rotated or
you'll be like whoa i just fell
and if you do you can really feel that
resistance that you have to be fighting
with that weight
as you bring the weight up nice and high
up nice and high
towards the sky towards the floor
towards the sky
towards the floor that's it
almost three two one and relax
awesome job you guys now set that down
and grab one of your light free weights
but if you're modifying i want you to go
without weight to start this one
we're going to start in a modified side
plank going from the knee
and the elbow and right here you can
already feel the work happening in your
shoulder
and in your obliques now with this
weight you're going to start with your
arms straight on your body
bend the elbow to 90 degrees and then
open up the palm
and lower it down so i want you to lift
and lower pulling from the back of the
shoulder now you can do this without any
weight right
so you're working on the side plank
you're working on the range of motion
and mobility and through that shoulder
but once you feel ready you can add a
three
to five pound dumbbell and this is going
to feel really heavy
for just about anyone good breathing it
out
exhaling and let's switch sides all
right so planking on the other side how
are you guys feeling on that
oh good i know i feel i wanted my
shoulders too
yes exactly lifting up you got your arms
straight
bend it 90 degrees you're gonna pull up
and down
keeping the elbow in as tight as
possible a lot of times your elbow wants
to come up here
but that's because you don't have as
much range of motion so you're trying
to work on your range of motion through
the back
and the shoulder so it's hard but it's
really important
that you focus on pulling it down and
back
down and back good couple more
seconds remember you can always drop the
weight you can lift the hips come on
keep the hips up i know it's hard
everybody wants to fall to the floor and
relax
awesome job it's not an easy one all
right so
keep your weight to the side and we're
going to go into a plank and reach
and from here i want you on your knees
with your knees almost as wide as your
mat
and from here you're going to kind of
lean into your right side
and reach with your left arm come back
down
reach with your right arm leaning to the
left
so you're leaning and reaching you're
leaning
and reaching normally i say you know
don't worry about
rotating your hips i say try to keep
your hips square to the floor
but for here we're almost doing a little
bit of a rotation
through the trunk you can add the
intensity here
by going onto the toes all right and
opening up this way
so do what feels good for you right now
or you can always say
anna i'm just going to hold the plank
how about that and i
am good with that too so lots of
variation here
and lots of different ways to work
through it and relax
beautiful job you guys are awesome grab
your heavy or your medium sized free
weight let's go back
into our chop okay so you're kneeling
one side
let's chop across the knee and up over
the body
down and up i always feel like my range
of motion here is less
than the other side i feel like uh when
i go up high
it's just not as easy and that's okay
guys there's always going to be that
little bit of
discrepancy between the left and the
right just keep working through it
might feel a little more awkward on one
side it's totally normal
up and switch other side i know my arms
my shoulders
hold on to your weight don't let it go i
also like this one too using a medicine
ball sometimes
because it makes me feel super athletic
you know
whatever you got in the house really use
a book your baby you can use your baby
that would be heavy oh maybe when
they're really really little
good up and down
four abs are tight i know three
two and one now grab that light free
weight
or none remember you can modify this one
without weight
you're going into that side plank
lifting
start with that straight arm bend the
elbow at 90
and open and close keep the hips as high
from the floor as you can
the tendency is to let yourself fall if
you have to rest
obviously rest and then come right back
up into that side plank
you could also modify this one too by
laying all the way down
and doing that extra rotation which
you've seen before
all right this one can work as well but
we're trying to work a little extra
in the obliques go ahead and switch
sides i know
my right side is much easier than my
left side yup
we're always going to be stronger on our
dominant let's lift
and squeeze you got it down and up
breathe it out you guys are doing great
now even just having this little bit of
weight
in this side plank position is adding so
much
to the whole side of your body here and
so if you're going without weight
you're still working the obliques and
the shoulders
and you're getting the rotation and
working on that mobility
so don't worry about starting right here
that's awesome three good two
and last one burn
okay you guys ready plank and reach
let's go with it so you can go from the
knees or the toes it's up to you
all right going down make sure your
knees are wide if you're going from the
knees
because you want to have a wider base of
support so that your back
doesn't feel compromised right it's okay
if you go even as wide as your mat
i'm okay with that that's actually going
to create less pressure on your low back
all right you're taking the weight off
of your foot the full body
if you're going all the way on your toes
you're really going to feel
it because now you're supporting your
entire body in this position
and this is a great challenge for those
of you that are ready
and relax oh walk it in now i want
one more of those really uh
really effective chops but we're only
gonna do a speed round here okay
take a deep breath did you just see me
give a deep breath there yes i did
here we go it's down and up let's go up
and down
come across down good control it on the
way down
pause and rock
and rock you got it that's it speed
round you can do it
you're working hard you've got this
one more let's go up and switch
other side and down let's go
chop and down
and down good breathe
come on shoulders you're doing great abs
are tight whew
that stability you need it from your
core come on you can do it
three two
yep and one awesome all right grab a sip
of water
we got our last little circuit here and
we're gonna start by holding on to
that medium-sized freeway
you can do this one without weight as
well but we're all going to show you
what this looks like with a little
weight in the hand and you're going to
be seated with your heels towards the
floor toes up towards the sky
holding on to that freeway you're just
leaning back a little bit remember you
can go without weight to start if you
want to
you're going to lean back a little bit
we're going to rotate side
to side okay so we're just giving
ourselves a little twist
back and forth now if the weight is
closer to your chest it's easier
all right if the weight comes down
towards the floor it's going to be a lot
harder so you got to feel where you can
do it
without compromising your back and
feeling that you have control
that's why sometimes it's good to start
this one without any weight
so you can just feel kind of where
you're at with the strength of this
back and forth getting all the muscles
of your entire core
breathe it out last couple seconds two
one and relax awesome job you guys now
set that weight down and we're gonna go
into a narrow grip push-up
a couple variations here for you guys
okay but the important thing is
is that your elbows are going to glide
right along your rib cage
i want you to be on your knees in a nice
plank position
no butts up in the air this is not the
position right
sink your hips down so your body's in a
straight line
elbows are going to come straight back
gliding along the body
you can come all the way to the floor
and then you want to push up as
one unit coming all the way to the top
now you can do this by bending the
elbows gently
and pressing up so if you don't want to
go all the way to the floor
you can work on just working on the
elbows coming back a little bit
and then pressing out coming all the way
to the floor is a
big challenge right because you're
coming down
and then you've got a lot to push
through all right so you find where it's
comfortable for you
elbows just important that they don't
pop out everyone wants the elbows to pop
out
but i want them to come straight back
down
and up and relax you guys feeling good
that one is really challenging so good
job with that
now grab your light free weights here
and come up to your feet
you're going to be as if you're a skier
on the mountain you're going to have
your feet about hip width apart
your knees are bent you're bending
forward you've got your ski poles in
your hands those are your light free
weights
now you're going to pull those ski poles
back hold for a count and then come
straight forward
so you're here pull back squeeze you're
working the triceps
you're working your shoulders you're
just coming back and forth here
now if you want to add a little
intensity you can pick one foot
one ski off of the ground
and you can do this one really
challenging a little bit of the glue in
the core
to balance and stabilize but really
focus mostly on the arms
good you can switch legs keep going
you're almost there pull it up pause at
the top
remember to pause at the top that's
where you're getting so much strength
belly's pulled in tight and relax
awesome okay
setting it down grab that medium-sized
free weight let's go into that seated
sidewinder
okay lean it back bring it side to side
now your first round here you were in a
position where you're testing out the
weight that you want to use maybe no
weight maybe a light weight
now if you're feeling good you can
always pick up the feet
and you can feel yourself challenge to
hold the weight of your lower body off
the floor
as well as the upper body holding that
straight back
position side to side good if you wanted
to
you could also say i want to try to pick
my legs up but the weight feels too
heavy
so then maybe you would drop the weight
as you advance this move with your feet
off the ground
and that's another way to change it up
back and forth you guys are looking good
side to side back
forth and relax oh my gosh
doing great let's go back into those
narrow grip push-ups you only got one
more set of those
so really focus on your form here think
about marrying those
elbows right along the rib cage start
with your hands underneath your
shoulders
drop the elbows straight back that means
your hands are even with your chest when
you get to the floor
and then press up good all the way down
good and press up how are these ladies
looking
oh yeah looking good i love the elbow
staying in tight you're doing great
all your yogi friends will be so proud
of you
[Music]
good that's it breathe it out
and here remember too you can go halfway
and press up
halfway press up you're just working on
elbows coming
straight back last one
and relax grab your light free weights
come back up onto your feet
we're going skiing all right i'm not a
skier either i'm a border so
i'm just trying to make stuff up here we
go knees are slightly bent
pull back and squeeze maybe you want to
get
fancy because you are a skier and you're
working on getting ready for the slopes
so you want to work on those arms those
glutes
and you're on one leg balancing it out
oh raven's going to try the balance
all right good you can switch legs if
you want to here
really focus on your form your back is
nice and straight
you're pulling those arms up towards the
sky giving it a one count at the top
so that you're really fighting gravity
breathe
two one and
relax awesome one more thing you did
sidewinders
my friends you're doing amazing
don't quit on us now we got your back
let's go
find where you're comfortable let's
start twisting it out
back and forth leaning back but keeping
a straight back
right so not a hunching here right now
to hunching
you want to keep your back nice and long
let your abs do the work
to support the spine
lots of variations for you to choose
from here
that's it breathe it out you can do it
shhh
grand finale we're gonna stretch it out
in just a second you're doing great
you're working your abs your obliques
your shoulders
you got it three two
one and relax

now
hold it there and we're gonna be in the
seated position to stretch out the
shoulders
and the chest so i want the hands to
rotate opening up
you're just going to open up your chest
in the seated position
all right so the closer you bring those
hands behind your back
the closer you bring them together the
more you're going to feel that stretch
so maybe they're wide right now where
you're like oh i feel the stretch right
now
you're getting it through your biceps
your shoulder your chest or maybe you
can walk those hands a little closer
together
pop the chest open
and let those shoulder blades roll back
that looks great you guys feel that
how you feeling back there good how you
guys doing
great job great job
good good then i want you to come into a
cross-legged seated position
and i want you to bring one arm across
the body to stretch out the shoulder
this is really going to pull a shoulder
blade that shoulder girdle
across the chest you want to lengthen
all these muscles so drop the shoulder
remember
don't be up here your shoulders
shouldn't touch your ear

giving it a hug give it a hug
breathe so proud of you
for getting through this one this is an
isolated
shoulders arms and abs workout and you

and core
breathe it out nice job
good and the last one i want to finish
with is a tricep
so if i'm here i want you to see one arm
is going to come
up and i'm going to reach towards the
middle of my back
and i'm going to grab that elbow
so here i'm getting a nice stretch
through my tricep and my lat we worked
that on the skier there we worked that
on the
push-ups and oh i'm going to side bend a
little bit so i'm going to
shift away from that side of my body and
get a little side
bend as well as a tricep stretch
you guys like that one yes
my triceps i just feel like all these
stretches release all the muscles
i am feeling right now from that workout
go ahead and switch
so bring that arm up long reach in
between the shoulder blades as much as
possible
