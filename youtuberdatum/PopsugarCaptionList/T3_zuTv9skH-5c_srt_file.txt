hey guys welcome to the new class fit
sugar my name is charlie atkins and i'll
be taking you through a
30 minute cardio hit class that is going
to leave you feeling empowered
this session is sponsored by under
armour
you're not going to need any equipment
so let's go ahead and jump right into
our warm up
so i'm going to turn sideways all i want
you to do is reach in both directions
soften the knees fire up the glutes
and then all you're going to do is twist
and just keep alternating sides
if you want a little bit more out of
this warm-up stretch you can wind the
arms
but you're really thinking about opening
up the thoracic spine spreading the arms
reaching in both directions
adding in some breath don't forget the
soft knees
keeping the glutes engaged and then all
you're doing is you're really just
rotating
through the thoracic spine or where the
ribs insert into the spine
good now from here i want you to come to
the back of your mat
and then we're just going to do leg
cradle so grabbing on to shin
and then ankle as you reach
you might lose your balance like i did a
little bit so grabbing onto shin reach
for the ankle
and then kind of rotate your knee away
from the torso
if you want to add walks which is what i
was doing in the beginning you can kind
of walk
forward if you have room in
your workout space to do this or if
you're like wow
really losing my balance just focus on
lifting one knee up
pulling the ankle in balance is a day by
day thing by the way
one day you have really good balance
other days it's a little rocky
such as today for me but it's okay this
should start to feel really good on the
outsides of the hips
good let's start back at the edge of our
mat
hips stay high you can bend the knees if
you have tight hamstrings walk with
fingertips forward
you're going to come to a plank position
and then come right back up
so all we're doing is warming up the
hamstrings by doing a forward fold walk
walk walk warming up the core
the upper body standing up and then just
repeating
this inchworm now one thing
i really want to stress the importance
of is often times when i see people
doing inchworms their fingertips are
pointed out
i really encourage you to bring
fingertips forward i want you to support
your shoulders
and having those fingertips forward is
just going to put your arm in a better
position
as you walk yourself out
all right now on your next intro i just
want you to meet me in that high plank
position
from high plank go ahead and bend the
knees push the tailbone up towards the
sky you're in a downward facing dog
and then from here we're going to move
back to push up plank position so you're
going from downward facing dog
to push-up plank if you're ready for a
little bit more you can always
go into an up dog spreading open the
chest
if you notice my arms stay straight the
entire time
[Music]
so pushing into the mat to get yourself
into that downward facing dog spreading
open the chest
[Music]
taking these nice and slow and
controlled
[Music]
now we're not racing against the clock
we're just trying to get
solid reps in with the amount of time
that we have
good and then i want you to come down
onto
your back for some leg lowers so this is
a lower ab exercise but it's actually a
hip mobility exercise plug the elbows
into the ground let your head
rest on the mat and then you're going to
lower one heel down
and then the other without letting the
heel touch the ground
to the best of your ability you want to
try to have a straight leg
if that means your feet need to go a
little bit past your hips
that's okay but it is going to be a lot
of work but it's going to be good
mobility work for you
we've got less than 10 seconds
[Music]
good keep going nice try to give me one
more on each leg
there it is good now come on up to
standing
we're gonna move into our first round of
exercises i call this the dynamic
warm-up the whole goal
is to just warm the muscles in the body
up as we start to head into that
empowering hit part so feet or hip
distance apart i just want you to press
the tailbone towards the back wall hands
are going to go behind the head
and we're just doing a good morning so a
good morning is the same motion
as a deadlift so the sideways view i'm
just pressing the hips back
and then driving my feet down into the
ground to let myself come all the way up
to standing i want you to try not to let
any of your toes come
up off the ground so you're really just
pushing the feet as hard as you can down
into the ground
as you lift yourself up
and then from here we're going to come
into seal jacks so it's a variation of a
jumping jack except
instead of reaching your arms up
overhead you're just going to open up
the chest so it's a great way to target
the back muscles
as well as open up the chest
now if you don't want to hop in your
steel jacks you can always tap one foot
and then the other
now throughout this entire workout i'm
going to be referencing
a scale of one to ten any time you're
doing a hit class
you want to be at about 70 which on our
scale is going to be a seven
we'll talk a little bit more about that
in just a second
as i bring into the next exercise we're
gonna be doing a squat kick so lower
body
plus the kick regular squat stand and
balance on one leg and then just kick
right in front of you scale up one to
ten
seventy percent means a seven if a seven
is a little bit too much for you today
then you can always hover around a six
or if a seven is too easy for you then i
challenge you
to stay at an eight so the whole goal is
to stay in this high intensity
interval training right kicking one heel
and then the other then after this we're
gonna head right back
we're gonna head right back to those
good mornings
this is just part of our warm-up
something else you can do for these good
mornings
is you can place the hands on the front
of the thighs press as hard as you can
into the front of your legs
as you lower down that's going to train
you that proper hinge position
now if you notice my back stays flat
straight line from my head to my
tailbone
as i lower down and as i come up
if hands are behind your head make sure
the elbows are pulled backwards
really opening up the chest good give me
one more
and then come back to those steel jacks
so by now you should start to feel your
body warming up
which is exactly what we're going to
happen because
the next round of exercises we are going
to be taking it up
a notch or two or three
so here you are in your seal jacks just
opening up your chest
or picturing yourself if you're pulling
open a big barn door
big old heavy doors either hopping the
feet in and out
or if you want to tap the feet and do
that but we got less than 10 seconds so
i need you to
finish with me in five four three
two one good right back to the squat
kick so you should be feeling good now
feeling nice and warm balance on one leg
kick the heel in front of you keep the
chest up
control yourself as you lower down and
really drive through the heel not the
toe
as you balance on one leg kick the foot
in front of you
two
we got about 10 seconds left all the way
through
keep going
[Applause]
stand up straight at the end of your
squat as you keep your foot in front of
you give me one more on each leg
nice all right set
number two so we're doing a pendulum
lunge
one leg and then the other right leg is
going to do a forward lunge
followed by a reverse lunge okay just go
ahead and keep moving
forward and backwards now i know that
lunges are a sensitive topic because
they're a little uncomfortable for some
of us so if you do not want to do the
front lunge
then you can just stick with the reverse
lunge okay
these exercises they work the exact same
muscle group
the only thing that's muscle groups i
should say plural
the only thing that changes is the
direction in which you're going
and how the leg is slowing you down to
get you into that position
[Music]
now keep the chest upright the whole
time there can be a slight torso lean
[Music]
and then we're going to switch sides
these always get me let's go ahead and
switch legs
so reverse lunge to a forward lunge just
a reverse lunge if you don't want to do
the forward lunge i'm totally okay with
that
but i want you to keep your gaze up
where the eyes go the body go flows or
is that what it is
if i was to be looking down at the
ground
it might not give me the best form so i
really just want to keep the body and
the head
in line with each other
now what i didn't warn you is that this
round of exercises
gets pretty well you'll see
very soon not quite yet but almost there
you'll see what i'm talking about
scale of one to ten check in where
you're at can you pick up the intensity
good from here we're gonna come down to
the map for our plank jacks
push-up plank position playing jacks or
hopping feet in and out
playing taps are tapping feet in and out
plank tap tap jack jack
is something right in between so i want
you to choose one
whichever one you decide to do perfect
what i don't want you to do is i don't
want your booty to be up in the air
i need your shoulders and your hips to
be in line with each other
you'll feel it so much more in your core
which is where we want this exercise to
be
keep going all right come down low
almost like you're taking a group photo
you're gonna do one arm one arm
got that now if you don't want to do the
hop
then you can go ahead and stay right
here
just having one foot and then the other
but that extra hop
is what's going to challenge you
land soft and go right into the next
exercise or the next
rep i should say keep going
we got this ten seconds
stay with me remember scale wanted
[Music]
three two one
all right active recovery buckets good
news is we only have to do those
one more time great news is
we only have to do those over them or
the great news is
we get to do those one more time
jogging in place check in with yourself
where you at are you challenging
yourself can you take it up a notch
if the answer is yes or yes kick a
little bit
kick a little bit quicker all right
ready for those pendulum lunges i always
like to take like
a deep breath in side out
before i begin moving again
trick of the trade we are doing body
weight but say you do this video again
you want to try it again because you
love it so much which
i highly recommend try doing it with
some dumbbells
that's how you take these workouts to
the next level
just sticking with one side
really trying to get that knee down to
the ground
both sides
keeping the gaze up using the breath
remember if the forward lunge is too
much for you
just stick with the reverse lunge okay
i'm okay with that
options add value let's go ahead and
switch sides
take that big breath slide out
here we go again
land soft bring yourself right back up
now one thing that i see a lot in lunges
is people actually step
too far away it's actually not that far
and then there's this whole controversy
about knees
going over toes you do not want your
knees to go over your toe
in the sense that your heel should be
planted on the ground
but if your heel is planted on the
ground
and you feel strong and safe you're
going to notice that it's not a direct
perpendicular line to the ground that's
okay
as long as it feels safe and good keep
going
all right down to those plank jacks now
on this plank jack i really want you to
think about
blocking the lats in so you're pulling
the armpits down
here we go another way to think about
pulling your armpits down is you're
pulling your shoulders
away from your ears now if you have a
mirror
i want you to check your form is your
booty up in the air if it is
pull it down and then i want you to take
a micro bend in the elbows come on we
got this
you can do tap tap or jack jack or all
jacks
oh keep one perfect oh here's the
exercise
i know you love start low
hop land soft
good land soft
perfect it just takes a few reps
to get it now if you can't do all
hopping remember you can stick right
here
just building up the strength to bring
you up to that full
star jack keep on you got this
we're so close feeling so strong
give me one more just for good measure
here it is
active recovery butt kicks
that's a great time now to check in with
yourself
you know i'm going to ask it scale 1-10
where yeah we're going to get a quick
recovery so if you want to very quickly
grab a quick sip of water now is the
time to do it
and we're going to be heading into a
cardio set
so i hope you are ready to go now in
this cardio set
we have four exercises that we're gonna
do three times through
now these exercises are a doozy so
let's get moving so the first exercise
is a sprawl
essentially a burpee minus the push-up
but a sprawl is actually
what a burpee was before the burpee
included
a push-up so all i'm doing is bringing
hands down to the mat
snapping my feet back and right as the
feet touch
kicking them forward try gripping the
ground with your fingertips
now we're going to be moving this entire
time
if these sprawls are a little bit
challenging for you they are a
challenging exercise you can step step
step step okay go ahead and give me one
more
perfect next exercise we're going to be
doing lateral bounce so i want you to
ease into it
these also are what people like to call
skaters
but you are bounding side to side
pause at the end push yourself from one
side of the mat to the other
what i don't want to happen is i don't
want you to twist
by reaching down to the ground you need
to balance on one leg
and then very quickly take yourself to
the other side of that but
there is that brief pause right in
between keep going
push so you're pushing down in the
ground getting yourself
from one side of the mat together this
is the ultimate inner thigh outer thigh
exercise
good give me one more each direction
perfect
now from here just jump rope in place
plug the elbows into your ribs
very small circles below the rib line
bouncing on both feet now depending on
where you're doing this workout and if
you have neighbors below
that can hear that bounce you don't have
to leave the ground say okay
super active arms pull the shoulders out
of the ears
it's almost like you're drawing little
circles with markers on the wall
keep going okay
next exercise we're going to be taking
it down to the ground crab reach spread
open the chest
point the fingers outwards but down
and then all you're going to do is
you're going to reach and you're going
to tap the knee
if you want more extend the leg okay
[Music]
keep the heart open you're just
alternating
one side to the other the entire time
the chest has got to be open if you
notice my arms are straight
the whole time so modification tapping
the knee
full exercise full extension give me
one more in each leg and then let's go
ahead and come on up
round two of three here we go hands come
down
quick feet kick back it's like a
reaction exercise
[Music]
[Applause]
now if you notice my feet land on the
edges of the mat
when i jump back my feet are together
lifting up stand all the way up
[Music]
keep going
okay one more you got this
right into your skaters so
go easy into them and then once you feel
comfortable with the motion
then really drive yourself from one side
of the mat
to you to the other you want one of the
best inner thigh exercises
this is it this is it right here it
takes power
to kick me from one side of the mat to
the other
i need to be able to absorb my landing
on one foot and control
and power myself to get to the other
side of that
however if you need to use that inside
foot to stop you
i'm okay with that but you want to build
yourself up single leg exercise
here we go jump rope
goal is to keep the heart rate up blow
the air out
there you go keep going pull the
shoulders out of the ears
[Music]
meaning i'm pulling down
so i've been asked about upper body
keeping my arms steady
as i draw circles on a wall like i have
two little markers
in my hands all right are you ready for
those crab reaches
so again open up the chest here we go
come on down i gave you two options
whichever one makes the most sense for
you spread the chest lift
up full extension or
tap the knee okay so
tapping the knee is a challenge for me
the good news is
is that one day i'm going to be able to
go full extension
if you're able to fully extend pause at
the top
[Music]
so there's ways to make the same old
exercises
more challenging by pausing
you got this two nice
all right this is the third round here
we go sprawls
stand up now one thing as i
grip the ground with my fingertips
that'll help support your wrist and i
want you
to stand all the way up quick feet
okay you're using the feet kicking back
as a launch pad
keep going
[Applause]
[Music]
all right lateral down start slow
once you feel comfortable with the
motion add power
land before moving on to the next side
i can use my inside foot to help slow me
down but eventually
i want to be able to pause and push
[Music]
push hard keep going come on
[Music]
oh it's getting challenging give me
three
two come on one
two exercises left this is our cardio
portion you're feeling it i know you are
i'm feeling it
pull the shoulders down open up the
chest
jump rope
active recovery check in
scale of 1-10 where are you if you are
at a 7 perfect if you can push yourself
a little bit harder try it if you're at
a seven and it's a little bit too
intense
just take it down to a six it's okay
keep going though keep moving with me
we got those final round of crap reaches
and then we're gonna head into your new
favorite core workout here we go
final exercise remember i gave you three
options
go with what makes most sense for you is
it the knee tap
is it the reach maybe it's the pause
[Applause]
so by going faster workouts it's
actually
not more challenging it's the ability to
pause
keep the heart open keep the chest open
keep the arms straight
all right we got about 10 seconds left
really keeping the arm straight
either pausing or just tapping whatever
makes more sense for you
and there we go all right so coming into
our ab set this is what i would like to
call
as your new favorite core routine we're
gonna hit
all parts of the abs so let's get
started
in the side plank make sure that the
shoulder's over the elbow the fist is
pointed forward
toes are pulled towards the shin and
then all you're gonna do is you're gonna
lift
the hips up now keep in mind if a
cycling is challenging for you a great
modification is to simply bend the knees
but i really want you to press the hips
forward make sure the shoulders are in
line with each other
reaching up towards the sky or you can
rest your hand right on your hip
but right here we're targeting the
obliques the side of the body or the
side of the torso so really lift the
hips up
keep the toes pulled towards the shin
that's going to help you keep a straight
line
and then fire up the glute good
now from there we're going to go ahead
and switch over onto the opposite side
now we're doing all these exercises
three times through
shoulders over the elbow make sure that
the fist is pointed forward
feet are stacked toes are pulling
towards the shin fire up the glutes
reach the arm up towards the sky
if you need to take the modification by
bending the knees totally okay but
really think about keeping the hips
lifted
away from the mat also make sure there's
space between your shoulder and your ear
breathing out good using those exhales
to help keep the core nice and tight
nice and strong
good now from here we're going to target
to the front side
so grab opposite elbows bring the elbows
down onto the mat
reach the hands right in front of the
elbows and then from your plank position
all you're going to do is reach and
pause
so when i reach and pause i don't want
my body
to move from one side or the other so
i'm trying to keep the core nice and
stable
as i reach out in front of me pause
oh reset and repeat keep the glutes
engaged just like
in our side planks good
now from there we're going to come on to
our back we're going to hit the lower
abs now remember
this was an exercise that we did in the
beginning so i want you to see if you
notice a difference
plugging the elbows down into the mat
toes pulled towards the shin
and then lowering one heel down pausing
right whenever the heel gets just above
the ground
and then lifting right back up so the
whole time my lower back should be
pressed into the mat
i find it helpful to bend the elbows
pressing them down into the mat keeps my
entire back engaged
which keeps everything nice and flat to
the mat
good reaching up
we've got about five seconds left
perfect now from there we're going to
head right back to the side planks
so you can do bent knees or you can do a
straight legs whichever makes more sense
for you
shoulders over the elbow toes are pulled
towards the shin lift yourself up
and then reaching up working on our
obliques so really contracting by
pressing
the feet and the elbow down into the mat
to keep everything on the side
nice and strong keep the shoulders out
of the ears
good you got this almost there less than
10 seconds
we're going to switch over onto the
opposite side here we go
so lining shoulder and elbow up i keep
reminding that because that's
one of the errors that i see a lot in
side planks is that shoulder and elbow
are not in line with each other so you
really want to make sure you have that
straight line
since most of your body weight is
pushing down on the arm you want to make
sure that that
shoulder is nice and supported toes
pulled towards the shin fire up the
glutes
straight line for my head all the way to
my heels
[Music]
using the exhales good
[Music]
and then from there we're going to go
ahead and come back to our plank reach
so grab opposite elbows
placing the elbows down stepping back
now
as you do these plank reaches if you
really feel yourself swaying
something you can do is you can actually
widen the feet so if i take my feet a
little bit wider
then i have more stability and bounce if
i want to challenge myself though i'm
just going to bring my feet
a little bit closer together remember
you're not letting the body rock from
one side to the other
[Music]
reaching out pausing try taking a breath
good you got this almost there perfect
heading into those lower abs lying down
on your back
so legs go straight up into the air plug
the elbows into the ground
and then lower one heel down and then
the other
another trick is you can use the exhale
to help bring that foot up
but i'm not looking at my feet i'm
actually looking straight up at the
ceiling
and then after this you know we're gonna
be heading into our final round of core
exercises
so keep moving keep pushing we're almost
through this together
good give me one more on each leg
almost there and then go ahead and come
on up last side plank on one side
shoulders over the elbow fist is pointed
forward now
up stack the feet lift the hips up fire
up the glutes
straight line from the head to the heels
now if your knees are bent
straight line from your head to your
knees so what i'm really trying to
emphasize
in the side plank is to press the hips
forward by firing up the glute
[Music]
good almost onto that second to last
or i guess the last side plank here we
go let's go ahead and switch sides
shoulders over the elbow toes pull
towards the shin lift the hips up
reaching up towards the sky and remember
ankles stay active
now if i want to make this more
challenging for myself i'm just going to
dig my feet down into the mat
as well as press my elbow or my forearm
down into the ground
as long as my shoulder feels supported
keep breathing you got this we've got
two ab exercises left after this and
then we are gonna head into the most
fantastic cooldown
give me five more seconds keep going
keep breathing it's about two breaths
and then come on down final plank reach
remember
grab opposite elbows set it up so that
you know you're in good form hands are
down on the mat
step back once you're ready to go reach
and pause
bring the elbow back slowly before
switching sides
[Music]
now if you feel like your booty is up in
the air fire up the glutes
hips should be right in line with the
shoulders
keep going we're almost through this
we've got one ab exercise left after
this
[Music]
good and then oh here we go final
exercise
coming down to our backs lower ab
lower abs toes pull towards the chin
plug the elbows down into the mat
and then here we go so never letting
that heel drop down
reaching the heel away from the body
[Music]
[Applause]
oh we got this you've got 10 seconds
left to go
really controlling the lowering of the
leg as well as controlling the lifting
of it
go ahead and give me one more on each
side oh man
and then as you finish up go ahead and
hug both knees in
to your chest and here we are let's go
ahead and hug the right knee into the
chest extend the left leg out we're
going to go through a
quick cool down all right i don't know
how you're feeling but i am feeling
strong
i'm feeling empowered i am feeling like
we did some work today
[Music]
go ahead and switch sides left knee is
going to pull into the chest
grab right onto the shin and if you
actually pull the knee a little bit
towards the armpit you'll feel that
you'll get
a little bit more of an opening take a
few deep breaths
[Music]
good oh
sit yourself up go ahead and flip on
over we're going to come into a puppy
pose
toes tuck under i just want you to reach
reach
keep the tailbone pointing up towards
the sky and then just pull the heart
down towards the mat
[Music]
so you can reach your forehead you can
reach your nose or you can reach your
chin
whichever one makes the most sense for
[Music]
you
good and then as you exhale go ahead and
walk the hands back you're just going to
come into a child's pose
[Music]
and then walk the hands up go ahead and
bring your right
leg forward tuck the left toe back
you're going to come to a low lunge
active low lunge
and then all i want you to do three
times is you're just going to open up
and then you're going to try and bring
this inside elbow on the inside of the
foot so it's a low runner's lunge with a
rotation
just three times nice and slow and
controlled keep the feet where they are
[Music]
trying to bring the elbow down to the
ground for some of us it's going to be
really challenging for someone
for others of you it's gonna be really
easy to bring the elbow down
just know that that's one of those
exercises that is kind of different for
everybody
go ahead and switch sides so starting
with our low lunge
reaching up high and then whenever
you're ready you can do three rotations
really pushing through that plant hand
that's planted down on the ground
good and then as you finish up with the
third one
whatever's going to take you towards the
front i'm going to walk my hands towards
you and we're in a
a little forward fold toes are pointed
forward slightly in so this wide legged
forward fold you can put the hands on
the ankles
you can put them down right in front of
you but take a deep breath in
sigh it out you can shake the head yes
you can shake the head no
and then go ahead and slowly start to
toe heel the feet in to where the feet
are just on the outside of the hips
and then for my yogis up there we're
going to be doing a malasana or a deep
squat so just drop the hips down
try to plug the elbows in to the insides
of the thighs
if you are having a difficulty coming
down and your heels are popping up
you can always just stay elevated and
you're just going to press one hand into
the other
so it's just a wide squat deep squat
trying to get the inside of the thighs
or the abductors the inner thighs you
can
rotate side to side good
hands come down to the mat let the hips
come up go ahead and
let the upper body hang and then rolling
up vertebrae by vertebra
as you come up top roll the shoulders
back open up the chest
and there you have it thank you for
joining me and under armour for this
workout i hope that you are feeling
strong and empowered
i'll see you at the next class fit sugar
workout soon
