plank walkouts
so i want you to stand at the top of
your mat and i want you to walk out
into a high plank and then walk your

hold the plank and then walk your hands
back
and reach overhead and breathe

[Music]
good open your eyes and now we're gonna
do
a nice groin stretch in our inner thighs
have really nice
wide stance and i want you to
bend and lean into your stretch
so very similar to like a lateral lunge
i want you to get the inside of your
your thigh which is going to be your
groin so you can rest
your forearm on your knee and stretch
good now we're going to switch over and
push into the other side
you can also place your hand on the
ground
to brace yourself or
you can do this with the straight leg
and bend over onto one side
and the other giving you some options
just in case maybe your legs are
way too tired or you may not be
as flexible or have as much mobility
giving you your options go ahead and
switch over to the other side
[Music]
good now we're going to take it down to
the ground
we're going to do a hip flexor stretch
so one knee down
one leg up i want you to tilt your
pelvis so there's one
straight line and your energy is facing
forward okay right now we're going to be
stretching
out hip flexor and our quad right here
continue to take deep breaths in and out
to lower your heart rate
[Music]
good one last breath
exhale let's go ahead and
kick that toe to the sky and get a nice
stretch
in our hamstrings now
you may not be able to straighten your
leg out all the way that's fine if you
bend and you still feel a stretch you
hit it
come on stretching is personal
you do what you can you stretch to your
ability
one last breath here
beautiful now we're going to go to the
other leg
and stretch out our hip flexor remember
all the energy is facing forward you're
going to tilt your pelvis
inwards and have a nice straight line
energy faces forward so you have nice
stretch in your hip flexor
and your quad okay good
couple of deep breaths here take back
control of this heart rate
in and exhale
[Music]
beautiful inhale
and exhale
one more inhale
and exhale go ahead and kick that toe up
drive that heel into the ground let's
get a good stretch in our hamstrings
sometimes one side is more flexible than
the other
so don't get discouraged if you get to
the other side and it may be way more
flexible or less flexible
it's fine stretch it to its capacity to
its limit
don't overdo it
[Music]
deep breaths here
one more
[Music]
good now we're gonna go back
into child's pose the ultimate finisher
