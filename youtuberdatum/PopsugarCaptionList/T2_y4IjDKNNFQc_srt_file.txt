let's get into some breath work based on
my stress score
i've been incorporating more breathing
exercises into my life
and i can't wait to share this breath
work technique with you
jimmy and i love to do 478 breathing in
the morning together
or in the afternoon when we've had a
super busy day to set a positive
peaceful tone in our home begin by
sitting
or lying down in a comfortable position
close your eyes
softly inhale through your nose for four
counts
then hold your breath for seven counts
and finish the repetition by opening
your mouth
to exhale very slowly so that it takes a
total of eight counts
to return to the bottom of your breath
we will repeat this
for full breaths together all through
this two-minute segment
i'm gonna start an eda scan alongside
this mindfulness session
and i'm placing my palm on my fitbit
sense
screen let's begin now

calm

gets and the better able you
are to manage your stress thank you so
