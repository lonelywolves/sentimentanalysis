hi welcome to the new class fit sugar
i'm charlie atkins and i'm going to show
you
all my favorite bodyweight core
exercises in this 20 minute workout
this session is sponsored by under
armour
you don't need any equipment for this
workout so let's go ahead and get
started with our warm up
all right let's come down onto the mat
we're going to start with adductor rock
so you're just going to reach one leg
out to the side
toe pulls towards the shin nice flat
back and you're just pressing your hips
forward and backwards this is a great
way to warm up the muscles of the inner
thigh
but i don't want your shoe on the mat i
want the bottom of your foot lifted up
so you have a nice
active ankle toes are pulling towards
the shin
go ahead and give me three more rocks on
this side
and they'll do the exact same thing on
the opposite leg
straight line from the head all the way
to the tailbone pressing the hips
forward and backwards if you want a
little bit more out of the stretch
all you have to do is dig the inside of
your foot down into the mat you're going
to feel the entire inner thigh start to
light up in the best way possible good
coming into the next exercise we're
going to be doing a down dog with a leg
lift
so bend the knees push the tailbone to
the sky straight line from the head to
the tailbone
and then all you're going to do is lift
one heel up and then the other
if you have tight hamstrings you can
always keep the knee slightly bent
but you do want a straight line from
your head all the way to your
think about sliding into home plate
really pressing your hands into the mat
[Music]
we've got about 15 seconds left here
just like in our other exercises i want
you to keep an active angle
toe pulls towards the shin heel lifts up
towards the sky
as your heel lifts up you want a
straight line from your head all the way
to that lifted heel give me
one more on each leg
[Music]
and then we're going to go ahead and
come down onto the mat going to come
into our first core set so starting with
one of my favorite ab exercises a dead
bug
lying here down on your back you're
going to plug your elbow
to your thigh or your hand to your knee
whichever makes more sense for you
and then all i want you to do is inhale
reach
exhale bring everything back to center
[Music]
good really thinking about those
lines straight line from my fingertip
all the way to that extended heel
and then i'm really plugging my elbow
and my knee together or my hand and my
knee whichever makes more sense for you
now if lifting your head up is too
challenging you can always let your head
rest on the mat
but if you are up for the challenge try
to keep your shoulder blades off
the mat good going to take a quick
breath we're going to switch sides so
same thing you can either plug elbow
and knee together or hand and knee
whichever makes more sense
if you want a little bit more of a
challenge lift the shoulder blades off
the mat
inhale reach keeping that active ankle
toe pulls towards the chin
using the exhale to bring everything
back to center
[Music]
if you do start to feel your neck tense
up i would rather you leave your head on
the mat
so whichever feels the most supported
you want to have a nice controlled
core exercise inhale reach exhale bring
everything back to center
really trying to keep your lower back
pressed into the mat
good from there we're going to flip over
onto our elbows we're going to be doing
a plank reach so grab
opposite elbows place them down on the
mat hands come down on the mat
step your feet back and then all i want
you to do is reach out in front of you
without
rotating the body so the goal is to keep
hips
and shoulders square towards the mat as
you reach out
[Music]
good job let's see if we can get about
two or three more on
each arm again trying not to let your
body rotate
and then we're going to come back to
those dead bugs so lying on your back
your choice hand or elbow onto your
thigh or your knee whichever makes more
sense
and then here we go inhale reach exhale
everything back to center if you're
doing these dead bugs correctly
your core should be totally on fire
inhale reach use the full exhale so i
want you to blow the air out
like you're blowing out a birthday
candle
good job we got about 10 seconds left on
this side
remember you don't need to do fast reps
i want you to do controlled reps if that
means you have to be a little bit slower
i'm okay with that take a quick recovery
and then we're gonna switch over
to the opposite side same thing either
elbow or hand your choice
and then here we go inhale reach
exhale bring everything back in if you
do start to feel your neck tensing up
just leave the head down on the mat and
you can always use your hand
pressing into your thigh but you want to
maintain as much tension as possible
between those two
good oh wow really starting to feel the
core try not to let your lower back
leave the mat
good see if you can give me two or three
more reps
last one for me right here and then
we're gonna flip over for that
plank reach so i always start my planks
by grabbing opposite elbows that just
sets me up
for a nice successful plank position in
my plank position straight line from my
head to my heels
and then reaching out in front of me
without letting the rest of my body
rotate
so as you extend out really press into
that forearm that's pressing down into
the mat
we got about 10 seconds right here
finish nice and strong with me
don't let the booty come up into the air
straight line from the head all the way
to the heels
one more reach on each side and then
we're gonna go ahead and come on up to
standing for our next
set of exercises so we're gonna be doing
squats curtsy lunges as well as another
plank variation this is just to get
more muscles involved more body parts
moving
let's go ahead and get started with our
squat kick so you're just going to come
down into your basic body weight squat
and then you're going to keep the heel
out in front of you now the theme
of a lot of my workouts is making sure
that we have a flexed hook meaning the
toe pulls towards the shin
so as you're kicking out in front of you
i don't want you to point the toe i want
you to flex
the foot driving through the heel like
you're trying to kick down the door
keep the heart and the chest up let your
breath help you out
and again you are balancing on one leg
as you kick out in front of you
good see if we can do two more squats
two more quick kicks one on each leg and
then we're going to go ahead and come
into
a curtsy lunge so in this curtsy lunge
we're just going to stick with the right
side
one foot steps behind you back knee
kisses the ground tap the foot
and then if you are holding on to a
basketball or a medicine ball you're
going to spill that ball
over the knee good
really pushing yourself up to standing
through that front leg
and then holding onto that ball just
spilling it
over the knee now one thing i want you
to do make sure that you're doing is
tack the foot in between the curtsy
lunge
and the knee drive the reason why is you
want to reset the hips
[Music]
and then use the core to bring that leg
up as opposed to using
momentum let's go ahead and switch sides
same thing
back knee kisses the mat spilling
something over that opposite knee
with the same knee tapping the foot
in between holding onto your ball or
another way that you can think of it
is if you had a bucket of water and
you're just spilling that bucket of
water
over your knee in a curtsy lunge or a
curtsy squat you want to make sure that
the shoulders
shoulders and the head are in line with
the hips
this is a great way to hit all of the
muscle groups
in the entire body i'm going to give you
one more
and then we're going to come down onto
the mat for a plank walk
so use that same trick i taught you grab
opposite elbows
place them down on the mat you're going
to start in your elbow plank position
replace elbow with hands a hand with
elbow
and then alternate now what i see a lot
in these plank walks also known as
commandos
also known as up up down downs is people
really sway their hips
keep your hips stable the entire time
it's almost like you're an elevator
lowering yourself down lifting yourself
up
nice let's go ahead and come back up the
ceiling
for those squat kicks so we're trying to
move quick here not staying too long
in one exercise that way we can get the
biggest bang for our sweaty buck as we
do this workout
don't forget to kick through the heel
not the toe
so you're kicking down a door good
heart and chest stay up in your squat
the knees drive away from each other
not caving in you do not want the knees
to cave in
[Music]
let's do two more squats two more kicks
and then we're gonna come into those
curtsy lunges
here we go step one foot behind you back
into
the mat tap spilling it over the knee
[Music]
now something with curtsy lunges
is the knee is just barely peeking out
in front of or behind the heel i should
say so you don't want to step
too far back you don't want too much
rotation of the body
you just want to step behind you drive
up to standing through that front leg
tap take your ball or your bucket and
spill it over the knee
okay go and give me two more on this
side
and then we'll switch over to the
opposite leg whenever you're ready
go ahead and fire it up back knee kisses
the ground i say kisses because you want
it to be a super light tap
and you want the front leg to do all of
the work so you want to think of
the back leg like a kickstand
in order to get the biggest bang for a
curtsy lunge you want the front leg to
do
a majority of the work so back leg is
just a kickstand
don't forget to tap in between tap
spilling over the knee good
heart and chest stay up this is like a
little cardio fish
oh lost my balance a little let's do one
more together
spilling over the knee come into those
plank walks grab opposite elbows
come down onto the mat set yourself up
for success
not rocking the body lowering down
lifting up so replacing elbow with hand
hand with elbow halfway through
if you can remember we are moving quick
halfway through if you can remember
switch your lead arm think of your body
like an elevator
going down one level to the next
you've got less than 10 seconds keep
going
almost there maybe one more and then
let's go ahead and come on
up to standing for our next round of
exercises
so we are going to do a little bit more
cardio we're going to be moving our body
a little bit more
we're just going to be doing a skip now
if you have neighbors that don't want
you to skip
you can march in place or if you don't
know how to get into a skip you can
start by marching in place
and then you can add a little bit of a
hop
[Applause]
now if you're already skipping and
you're already getting bored you can
start to move laterally side to side
and remember this whole workout is about
core so i want you to think about the
core staying nice and strong
nice and controlled as you move through
your skips
good about 10 seconds left keep going
keep the heart up don't let yourself
crash forward
and three two good now from here let's
come down onto the mat
we're going to be doing a hip raise
but we're going to be alternating so you
do three and three
one knee comes up you're gonna do three
single leg hip raises
and then you're just gonna switch legs
just like in all of our other exercises
no pointed toes only flex feet so toes
pull towards the shin driving through
that foot that's down on
the mat to get your hips up
thinking about how the core stays
involved in this exercise since we are
doing a core workout
good see if you can give me three more
nice now from here we're gonna be doing
a triple triple
so you're gonna bring the feet up again
toes pull position
all it is is three classic crunches
lifting the heart up towards the sky
hands come down and then you're gonna do
three reverse crunches
now if reverse crunches don't feel
comfortable to you here's a
alternative you can do three crunches
followed by four
heel drops so both the reverse crunch
and a heel drop are going to target the
lower abs
so we're getting the top abs if you will
for this classic crunch
and then we're getting the bottom abs
if you will for the reverse crunch
two three you can either do the heel
drop
or you can do that reverse crunch
now from there go ahead and flip over
with me into push-up plank position or
high plank position
shoulders are over the wrist in your
high plank position
you're just going to bring knee bring
knee towards armpit and you're going to
switch sides
just like in all of our plank exercises
that we've done
plank reach plank walk you do not want
the body to rotate so shoulders and hips
stake where it's square towards the mat
as you're alternating feet
[Music]
give me one more on each leg and then go
ahead and come on up to scan it
and we're gonna head right back to those
skips so if you have neighbors that
don't want you skipping you can always
march
if you feel comfortable adding a little
bit of movement
you can turn it into a skip if you're
looking for a little bit more movement
than a skip go ahead and move
lateral with me side to side
[Music]
using your breath keeping the heart and
the chest up
and just moving from left to right right
flat
you've got about 10 seconds left here
the goal is to bring the heart rate up
[Music]
and don't forget we're going to be
coming down to the matas
for our alternating single leg hip
raises so lying on your back
plug the elbows into the mat lift one
leg up it's three
on one side before alternating
legs
keeping an active angle toe pulls
towards the shin try pulling your knee a
little bit closer towards your chest
and alternating sides
good you've got about 15 seconds left
here don't rush it i'd rather you have
smart
controlled
reps than trying to kind of speed
through this workout
from here let's head into that triple
triple i gave you two
options starts with three classic
crunches lifting the heart up to the sky
followed by three reverse crunches or
i'll show you the
alt the option three
classic crunches followed by four just
to balance it out
heel drops whichever makes more sense
for you
heart lifts to the sky for your classic
crunches the ankles are always active
and you're either doing a reverse crunch
just getting the tailbone off the mat
or you're doing that heel drop
[Music]
trying to keep your lower back pressed
into the mat
[Music]
you've got about five seconds left
finishing nice and strong
good and then from there we're gonna
head into those plank spiders
so high plate position shoulders are
over the wrist straight line from the
head all the way to that heel
not rotating the body bringing the knee
up and over the fire hydrant
and switching sides try gripping the
ground with the fingertips i like to
call it tenting
the fingertips and you've got about 10
seconds left
don't let your booty go up in the air
you want to keep that straight line
from the head all the way down to the
hips feels really pushing yourself away
from the mat go ahead and give me one
more on each side
and then we're going to come into our
final round of four exercises starting
with another one of my favorites we're
going to be doing a quarter get it
the knee that's up is the arm that's up
i'll say that again the knee that's up
is the arm that's up
the other limbs are extended all you're
going to do is use your core to roll you
up onto your elbow
slowly lower right back down and come
right back up
i do want your head kissing the mat in
between reps
so i don't want you to stress out your
neck by always trying to pull your chin
up towards the sky
let your head relax before you come
right back up into another rep
using this elbow as a kickstand so as i
roll myself up i
push into the elbow spreading my chest
lower right back down
and repeat you've got less than 10
seconds left on this side
we're gonna do the exact same thing on
the opposite leg
or the opposite side i should say good
let's go ahead and switch so the knee
that's up is the arm that's up
opposite limbs are extended if it's
helpful for you you want to think about
keeping
your leg at about a 45 degree angle from
the body
and just like in all of our other
exercises keeping an active ankle
toe pulls towards the shift rolling up
pressing the elbow into the ground
and slowly coming right back down good
reaching up towards the sky looking up
towards the sky the entire time
good see if you can give me about two to
three more reps
i'm coming in for my final two my last
one and then we're gonna go ahead and
flip over and we're going to be doing
another plank
so grab opposite elbows bring them down
onto the mat palms come down
step your feet back now keep in mind the
wider your feet are the more stability
you'll have so if you really want to
challenge your core
try bringing the feet together the heels
together and then push yourself away
from the mat straight line from the head
to the heels
if you want to make this even more
challenging i want you to think about
pulling
the elbows towards the toes you've got
about 10 seconds left
trying to create a bubble in the middle
of your mouth by pulling your
elbows towards your toes give me three
two
one and then flipping right back over
for our quarter get ups
the knee that's up is the arm that's up
and then all you're doing is rolling up
onto the elbow reaching up towards the
sky
letting your head kiss the mat in
between reps
good i call this to get out of bed
exercise
because these the muscles that roll you
out of bed in the morning
and get you started on the day give me
one or two more reps however many you
have left in the tank on this side
and then let's go ahead and switch knee
that's up is the arm that's up
ankle stays active toes pulling towards
the shin
pressing the elbow into the mat to lift
yourself up
letting the head kiss the ground
in between reps use an exhale to bring
you up
and lower right back down
really allowing the forearm or the elbow
on the ground to press into the ground
to try and spread the chest
shooting for three more reps that's
three
this is two one
and then coming into our final exercise
of the set we're going to be doing this
plank hold so grab opposite elbows set
yourself up try zipping the heels
together straight line from the head
all the way to the heels
now in this final plank i want you to
think about blowing the
your birthday candles out that's going
to help you keep the core nice and
engaged so it's an inhale through the
nose
really blowing your birthday candles out
you've got 10 seconds left i need you to
hold it all the way
nice strong core we've got three
two and one go ahead and come into a
child's pose
[Music]
short and sweet or short and sweat
let's go ahead and come into a low lunge
so my right leg is four and my left leg
goes back
and then all i'm doing is holding the
slow lunge if you have trouble reaching
the ground you can always drop the back
knee and then just prop
your chest up by pressing into your top
thigh or your front leg
however if you are able to hold this low
lunge you can go ahead and just stay
here
taking a few breaths
and then give me one more deep breath in
and then as you exhale we're just going
to go ahead and switch sides so however
you want to get there
one leg forward one leg back you can
either be in this
elevated low lunge or you can drop the
back and you're lifting yourself up
whichever makes more sense for you
[Music]
taking about three to five breaths
you should start to feel the hips open
up
good and then if you can place both
hands down on the mat we're actually
going to step back to a
down dog bend the knees push the
tailbone to the sky
straight line from the head all the way
to the tailbone and then push into the
mat like you're sliding into home plate
if you can start to reach the heels down
towards the mat that should feel good on
the hamstrings however
if straightening the legs causes your
upper back to round then i'd rather you
have
bent knees with a nice long spine
[Music]
lifting your right leg up we're going to
come into a pigeon stretch but go ahead
and roll your ankle
in both directions three times
and then all you're going to do is bring
your knee towards your same side wrist
bring your foot towards the opposite
side of the mat and then instead of just
falling down i want you to actually
lift yourself up take a deep breath
in and then as you exhale you can start
to walk
yourself out
[Music]
if you do want to get a little bit more
out of your pigeon stretch what you can
do is think about pressing your shin
down towards the mat that's going to
help you square the hips off
but if you do press your shin into the
mat make sure that you relax for a
second
to settle into your new range of motion
or your new mobility
[Music]
and then go ahead and walk the hands up
we're just going to step this right leg
back
[Applause]
[Music]
and we'll go over onto the left side so
left leg lifts you're going to roll the
ankle
three in both direction
and then as you're bringing your left
knee through left knee goes towards the
left wrist
left foot goes towards the right side of
the mat inch your back leg back shoelace
is down
lift yourself up and then walk yourself
out and then the trick of the trade in
the pigeon
is if you actually think about pressing
your shin down into the mat that's going
to help you square off the hips
[Music]
taking it inhale through the nose and
then exhale out the mouth
one last breath and go ahead and walk
yourself
up we'll come back to that downward
facing dog
except for i want you to start to walk
your feet towards your hands
and then you're going to bend the knees
grab opposite elbows and you're just
going to rag doll yourself up
i hope you gave it your all and your
core is feeling strong
thank you for joining me and under
armour and i will see the next plastic
sugar workout
soon
[Music]
