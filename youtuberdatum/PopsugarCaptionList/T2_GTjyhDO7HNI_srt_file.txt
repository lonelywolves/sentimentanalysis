saturday
is that we did this massive event called
i've got grit

screen
120 degree view i mean it was
unbelievable
right lights cameras when i shared with
them

and you're gonna take into some squats
for me right here he said did you know
that nobody else has the same eyes as
you
nobody else has the same fingerprint
guess what
no one else even has the same heartbeat
as you
so you are unique and individual and
amazing just
as you are you don't have to try to be
somebody else
you just have to compare yourself to who
you were yesterday
and if you are committed to becoming one
percent better
than you were yesterday put another
while in the chat
feel like you know what some days it's
hard some days it's difficult but
i know that with this community i'm
gonna get better
every single day just one percent
because i'm gonna do the work
