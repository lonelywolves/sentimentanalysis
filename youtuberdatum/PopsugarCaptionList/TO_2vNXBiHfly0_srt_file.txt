let your arms hang let your upper body
relax to the right nice work
arms up reach high for the sky all the
way up exhale release reach for the toes
walk the toes and heels in just having
that left leg back to a nice long lunge
press that hip down we hold four three
two one drop that knee and if you can
reach for the back foot get a good quad
stretch here four three two release back
up to your lunge
straighten up both legs hips to the sky
and set that foot in other side step
back into a lunge you're here for three
two one drop that back knee and reach
for that back foot today make the
commitment to stop doubting yourself you
tried this workout and with something
new for you and I guarantee you can do
anything you put your mind to release
the back foot dressing up both legs
straight set that foot in let the body
hang forward slightly bend the knees low
roll up here we go
feet out nice and wide take one arm
across the body just stretch it out here
we did a lot of work with our arms
use our back there switch size keep the
hips rocking side to side one arm up and
over behind the head good
last arm stretch here reach the
fingertips up and switch arms and add a
little smile to your sweaty body the
best accessory I think bring the feet in
nice and tight two fists high to the sky
one fist to your hearts one fist to your
gut
always trust those two things they will
never lead you astray and remember the
power is in your heart not in your hands
great job today guys great job today
