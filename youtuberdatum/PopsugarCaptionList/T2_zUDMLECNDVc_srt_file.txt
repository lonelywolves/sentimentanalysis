the only way that we can consistently
challenge the body
to keep getting stronger and more fit is
by adding the proper recovery
this restorative routine will help you
feel fresh and ready to crush your next
workout
you'll need your foam roller and bath
towel for this session let's get ready
to relax
and restore this episode of class with
sugar
is presented by voltaire feel the joy of
movement
all right my friends are you ready to
restore that body we've got jenny
and raven here to join you we're gonna
start here on the foam roller
all right you're just going to sit on
the foam roller and bring in your hands
behind your back to give you some
support and you're going to first
lean into the side of your body you're
going to start to feel a little
pressure through the glute and hip here
and you can just kind of keep that here
and support yourself either with two
hands or if you want to really lean
into that hip you can take your hand off
and really
really press with most of your body
weight on the side
now a way to advance this one and to get
into the hip even deeper
would be to cross your ankle up and over
the knee and so that's going to increase
the stretch in the hip
and the pressure it opens it up a little
bit you guys feel that i really feel it
yeah
it's burning in a good way it's a
beautiful burn
today is about really regaining and
restoring your body so think about the
whole time that you're here today
is taking deep breaths in through the
nose
and out through the mouth and really
giving yourself that time to open up
we're spending a little bit of time here
because this releases the tension in
your muscles it's like giving yourself a
self massage
and not everybody has the money to buy
500
self massagers or go to the massage
parlor every month
but this is going to be a way for you to
get it every single week
okay all right so let's switch sides all
right we're just going to rotate so you
guys can still see us here
all right i'm just gonna be seated on
the roller i'm leaning
into my hip to start feeling that nice
pressure
opening it up and then i like to add
that little cross
over my ankle because i can feel my hip
get a little more stretch there
and then i get to feel that pressure
here's the key when you guys are foam
rolling
you want to go slow you want to find
that point where you're like
oh what's that i feel that pressure get
off there get off there
you want to hold it there so when you're
rolling you don't have to roll
you're on a roller and that pressure is
what is really releasing the tension so
if you find a tight
area in your body hold it there
as long as you can and that is going to
be how you really treat that pressure
and give it that time to release
beautiful all right the next one we're
going to do is we're going to do the
upper back
so you're just going to come off that
roller and you're going to come onto it
in the middle of your back here
supporting your head and neck you can
bring your hips
up and off the floor a little bit and
then you're just going to roll
gently on the middle of the back oh that
feels amazing
doesn't that feel good yes you want to
think about
kind of curling forward so that you
don't arch backwards that you really put
that pressure
into the foam roller
and you're breathing okay you're kind of
taking those deep breaths
in through the nose out through the
mouth the closer you bring your feet
to your hips the more support you'll
have all right so if you want to walk
your feet in a little bit so that you
got a little bit more support
and you're kind of curling that spine
getting that nice
pressure remember you don't have to go
fast you don't have to go
far you just got to find where it feels
tight
and just give it that nice easy pressure
relief yeah found a really good knot
back here yeah you can find them
you can find them for sure beautiful
you guys are awesome couple more seconds
even if you had your hips down here
you'd be able to feel a little bit of
that pressure
be able to kind of like leave it there
oh
all right now we're going to come down
to the calves this can be painful for
those of you that have never done this
so i want you to first start with this
one
all right and i want you to just put
both of your calves
on the roller you got your hands here to
support you and
i want you to see if you feel any
tenderness you're not even lifting your
hips up yet you're just kind of like
moving your body rocking a little bit
forward and back now you can start to
get a little bit more pressure if you
cross one leg over the other
i don't even need to lift my body
weights right now
to feel the pressure of this leg and
the roller my leg in between feel that
you feel that right
i feel it yeah yeah right on a knot yeah
you find
the knot oh that's it i got the knot
right there i just roll over so find
your knot
and just let the pressure sink into it
right so you're holding it there
if you're crossing your legs cross the
other side so you get the other side and
you find the other knot
right and if you do this obviously more
than once a month you're
really going to start to release the
tension in your body and in those
muscles
that's why i want you to be doing this
at least once a week
so you can really start to train your
muscles to release
and you can stop having those chronic
knots in your body
beautiful remember deep breaths because
the more you're breathing that oxygen
in the more those muscles are getting
restored
beautiful nice
oh yes
nice work you guys awesome
all right so we're going to move into
this last one which is going to be for
the quads right front of the legs
so you're going to plank over the foam
roller you're supported
by the lower body on the roller and the
upper body
by the elbows and so here's where you
might have to say oh okay
i want to go a little bit lower or i
want to go higher
and i want you to find whatever tender
area
you can in those quads so the front of
those thighs are getting worked a lot
during this program you're feeling
yourself using those legs
and this is getting blood flow through
those muscles
releasing all the tension and the
connective tissue that surrounds your
muscles
and that's really why most of us are
having that pain
and we're not able to lengthen and
recover as quickly as possible
all right so just nice and easy deep
breaths in through the nose
deep breaths
let yourself recover i think that this
can
kind of be meditative because you're
only focusing on how painful it is
you're only focusing on how
uncomfortable you feel so you're not
thinking about all the other garbage in
your life right you're not thinking
about other things stressing you out or
anything like that
that's what meditation is about
meditation is about being present in the
moment
and in this kind of activity you can't
help but be right here
so you're welcome little section of
meditation never hurt anyone
and that's how i hope you treat this
session is is a little bit of time to
just focus on your body
right a little bit of time just focus on
relaxing
all right beautiful awesome all right
now let's come up
onto the mat with a little bit of
stretch
sequences that are my favorites i think
they're going to truly give your body
the recovery that it needs
some of these you might have done and
some others might be new to you okay so
you're going to start on your back
bringing one knee into the chest and you
can keep one
foot flat if that feels good or if you
feel like you can add an extra extension
of that leg
then press that bottom heel down and
away
while keeping one knee in towards your
chest
okay so you're just feeling a nice
stretch through the hips the glutes the
low back
and you're just holding it i want you to
take a deep breath in through the nose
[Music]
out through the mouth
just one more
[Music]
beautiful and then switch sides so you
can bring
one foot down other knee comes in if you
feel like your low back is comfortable
in that space just stay there right just
breathe it out get you a nice stretch
if you can extend the opposite leg then
you're getting even more of a stretch
through that
hip flexor and so you can press that
heel down and away and really open up
the hips here
it's a little bit more of the advanced
version you do what feels good
right but make sure that your low back
doesn't feel like it's getting arched it
doesn't feel like it's being strained at
all
it's really going to help you kind of
keep yourself in balance
beautiful couple deep breaths in
breathe it out
[Music]
this entire stretch and restore
is going to truly replenish you so keep
focusing on your breath
good now i want you to bring both feet
down and together so your knees are
going to come together
your feet are together pull your feet in
a little bit you know so that
they're kind of tight to your body bring
your arms open to 90 degrees or
straight out wide and you're going to
let your knees roll and rock
all the way over to the floor as far as
they'll go
now if you need to extend your legs a
little bit that will make it a little
bit easier
the closer they are to your body the
more of a stretch it's going to feel so
if you got to move your feet away from
your body a little bit that's okay
you're just getting a nice little twist
here right
so you're letting your hips rotate your
back is getting a stretch
when you take a deep breath breathe it
into the side of your body
[Music]
exhale all that tension
some of you might your knees might not
touch right
your feet might touch but not your knees
and that's okay right that's okay
whatever feels comfortable you're just
letting your knees roll to the side
bring it back in okay so feet back
together
here all right you can have your feet
longer
further away you're just gonna let
yourself twist
oh i said to the girls
we're gonna hear a lot of moaning and
groaning kind of achy
and shaky
this is the stuff that you wish you did
more of right
totally yes
[Music]
beautiful one more deep breath into the
nose
[Music]
i love it now we're going to come back
here into this neutral position
your knees are bent you're going to
bring one ankle over the knee so let's
bring your right ankle over your left
knee
now in this same exact position i want
you to keep everything just as it is
except
let your hips rotate bringing the foot
to the floor so you're going to bring
your right foot
down to the floor and you're getting
that nice little
twist through the hips but now a stretch
through the hip
as well because you're in that figure
four position now your
goal is to keep that knee pressed away
from your body you don't want it to cave
in that's my how it that might be how it
looks right now
but your goal is to be pressing it away
from your body
the goal is that so just do your best
right it's not going to look
perfect it's not going to feel perfect
but as long as you're breathing and
you're letting yourself try to ease into
these stretches you're going to get
better and better at these and it's
going to make your body feel healthier
and more mobile each and every time you
do it
good one more deep breath in through the
nose
[Music]
out through the mouth
and let's go back to neutral so now your
both feet are going to come
to the floor going to cross your left
ankle over the right knee
open up the knee so you got a nice
stretch and now
rotate your hips bringing your foot down
to the floor keep your knee as open as
possible
as you rotate good
and just holding it there this is an
entire routine that you know you should
really think about doing pretty much any
day of the week but
especially going through this entire
routine
at least once a week to give your body
every necessary stretch
to really keep it open feeling restored
relaxed
these are things you always want to give
to you know your parents or
people that are like oh my gosh i
haven't stretched in years
and they just need to start gaining some
mobility in their body
this is exactly the where they need to
start
all right now i want you to come back to
neutral we're going to come all the way
up to a seated position all right now i
want you for this one to have your legs
straight out in front of your body
almost as if you're reaching towards
those toes you're feeling a nice
hamstring stretch here
but we're going to release the neck and
traps okay so your hands
are going to come down to your side so
that your arms are nice and long
and i want you to press the heel of your
hand
into the floor and tilt your head away
from that arm
and that shoulder so you're going to be
actively pressing the heel of that hand
in towards the floor as you lengthen and
just tilt the neck
and this hand is just kind of like
supporting you right so you don't like
push yourself over
all right so you're just here and you're
lengthening you might tilt your head a
little bit
forward or you might keep it to the side
but you should absolutely feel that you
guys feel that
stretch all the way through the neck and
traps i love this one
and at the same time you're getting a
nice stretch through those hamstrings
let's switch sides
so you're pressing the heel of that hand
tilting the head away
taking deep breaths in
it's crazy because this side of my neck
my left side
is so tight and then this side i'm like
i don't feel it
but you're still getting it so that is
the key
to really extend take those deep breaths
wherever you're tighter you're always
going to feel it more
one more deep breath
oh beautiful oh my gosh i absolutely
love that one now
the next one we're gonna do we're gonna
grab our bath towels here so they're
long so that we have a lot of room here
to wrap it around one foot so you're
gonna bring one foot in
and you're gonna wrap that towel right
around the base of the ball of the foot
all right so your hips are square you're
gonna grab that towel
sitting nice and upright as you exhale
you're gonna pull yourself
in and assist yourself on that seated
stretch a little bit
so now i'm forcing you to keep your foot
flexed which is really hard and it's
really going to dig into that calf a lot
more
a lot of people sometimes have a kind of
a pointed toe here
flexing that foot is really going to
force you to extend
good you can come out of that stretch a
little bit maybe you're like okay i need
a little moment in a little moment
and come out of that stretch for a
second and then pull yourself back in
really give yourself a nice assisted
pull
breathe into it you got it
[Music]
focusing on you focusing on your breath
trying to be present
and let's switch sides good so you got
both legs straight
hips are square pull one knee in
bring the towel right around pull it
down
good and pull yourself in ah this one's
tighter than me
yes you can feel that difference in your
body you want to start to see that
balance out after a while you're going
to start to
feel good release if you need to and
come back into it
you're going to feel yourself regain a
little bit of that balance in your body
and you're going to feel
more mobile and more flexible during
everyday activities
[Music]
all right now we're going to go into a
twisted move where we're gonna allow our
spine to get that like
you get that ring of your spine and new
blood flow goes through it
so you're gonna set your towel down to
the side we're gonna cross
your left ankle over your right leg
you're gonna
hug that left knee into your chest
right and i want you to take that right
arm come behind your body if you can
and you're just going to assist yourself
in a little twist
right so i'm hugging and i'm giving
myself a little bit of an assistance
from my backhand
to give my nice little spinal twist here
and you don't have to go
far whatever feels comfortable you could
also stay right here
because a lot of times your hips right
here might be super tight
and you might not be able to even get a
twist in so this hand might just be
supporting you
in a nice upright position but if you
can start to slowly creep that hand back
give yourself a little look behind
you're gonna work your way up to that
nice spinal rotation
[Music]
breathing
and then we'll switch up all right so
come out of that nice and slow
gonna bring one ankle over the other so
you're bringing that
right leg over the left leg hug that
right knee
good give yourself that twist bring that
arm up and over
oh yes
think about straightening out your spine
right now right so if you're
you're hunching at all really try to
open up your chest
lift tall as if somebody's got a string
attached to your ponytail
and they're raising it up towards the
sky
it's going to elongate you make you feel
a little taller
right
[Music]
give me one more big inhale through the
nose breathe it all in
now we're going to come over onto our
hands and knees and we're going to do a
little stretch
so now we're going to really arch the
spine we're going to pull those shoulder
blades apart
get a nice extension between the
shoulder blades
arching it up like a cat stretching in
the morning
dropping the chin towards the chest and
then drop the belly
the head up a little bit the muscles in
the front of the spine get a nice
extension
let's just repeat that a few times so
you can
inhale or exhale whenever you feel like
you want to you know i
personally feel like everyone's
different with this one
you might not have a rhythm of your
breath just make sure that you're giving
some nice deep breaths in
up and down feels so good think about
like yeah i feel like you're like
think about your massaging all the
muscles
that align your spine
giving them a little bit of a
lengthening
bringing flesh fresh blood flow
and we're going to go into a down dog
walk
so we're here we're going to go into a
downward dog
tuck the toes lift the knees press the
hips up towards the sky
and your legs are going to be gently
bent at first right because you know
you're a little tight you're a little
elongated we're going to go one at a
time pressing one
heel towards the floor bending the
opposite knee
and we're just gonna kind of walk that
dog lengthen out one leg
feeling a calf stretch here really get a
good
calf stretch hamstring stretch going
back and forth
nice and long if a down dog felt too
difficult you could do this against the
wall kind of just like
leaning against the wall and pressing
your heels back into a calf stretch
right you don't have to be down dog
version
but really lengthen out the calves here
that's the most important thing
our calves get so tight during all those
balance moves and
squat moves and lunges and shuffles and
all that
stuff jumping jacks
good and relaxed coming down from that
down dog you guys feeling good
yes all right we're going to come into a
kneeling hip flexor stretch so you've
done this one before
but now i want you to do a little
passive version where you got one foot
up you're going to have your hands just
a little bit in front of that knee
or a little bit in front of that toe and
you're going to keep your back knee down
and just allow your hips to sink towards
the floor
okay breathe into your hips here take a
nice deep breath think about your hips
just relaxing
sinking further and further towards the
floor
let your hips really relax we can add a
little bit of
of a twist here if we want opening the
chest up
towards the sky but if you don't feel
like giving it that twist just stay
right where you are
that just tends to open up the hip even
a little bit more
[Music]
bring it in
always thinking about too where you feel
most tight where you feel
most you know like
tension and that way next time you do it
you can see if there's a difference good
let's switch up sides
oh i needed that one i know i'm like oh
crickety crickety crick
good hands come down knee is down
good we're just holding that nice
extension let the hips sink towards the
floor
breathing it out
you can add a twist if you want to feel
a nice stretch
sometimes my body really resists these
twisting motions
he says what are you doing to me messing
my body
your hands back down yeah and you can
finish off with this passive stretch
just opening it up
breathing
love it beautiful you guys are doing
great now
we're going to come on to our side and
we're going to do a line quad stretch
so i want you to lay all the way down on
your side as if you're getting ready for
a nap
all right you're going to cradle your
head here and you're going to grab
the the foot bringing the heel up
towards the glute
now i've got both knees bent so that i'm
not going to like
fall backwards or anything like that so
you can keep this knee a little bit in
front and keep
this leg trying to think of creating a
straight line all the way
from your your hip all the way down to
your knee
and if you can get that heel close to
your glute great
right so normally we do this one
stretching uh i mean standing
but today i just want you to kind of
relax into this one
allow yourself to get a little bit of
that
release some people also they like to
add a little bit of the it band
so they might bring that knee or that
ankle
up over that knee and depress the leg
and that's not necessarily something you
need to do but it's an option
right so just breathe it out
enjoy that stretch
good and relax now you can probably just
roll over
i'm going to switch sides so that you
can still see me and hear me
rolling it all the way down caress that
head feel nice and relaxed
if you're not doing this stretch just
watching tv then why not right
you can do this when watching television
you do this one just to feel like you
need that little bit of release
through the front of the legs you don't
always have to be doing it
trying to balance on your feet take nice
deep breaths in think about breathing
into that front of the leg
front of the body
[Music]
and your goal really it should be to get
that heel
all the way to the glute you know
working towards that type of flexibility
[Music]
beautiful now these last couple
stretches we're going to do
with the towel all right so go ahead and
release that leg
oh my gosh that feels good and i want
you to come all the way up onto your
feet grab your
long towel we're going to do a chest
opener here
so upper body needs just as much love as
the lower body
okay so you're going to take a wide grip
with this
but not so wide as to letting yourself
go all the way behind
your back you want to be able to bring
your hands a little bit behind the head
so you can see my arms are just a little
past my head
but not all the way if i if i lose it
all the way i might go all the way down
and i want to
actually hold the stretch where i feel
the tension
you want to feel the tension like oh i
can't go any further
because then you're getting a real big
chest and shoulder opener yeah feel it
yeah all right you can have a nice soft
bend or you can have the arm straight
whatever you want if you have your arm
straight you're like whoa shoulders like
give me that
you bend your elbows a little bit you
might feel a little bit even more
through your chest
breathe it out
now for here i'm gonna have you drop
your left arm
and bring your right up over behind the
back
now i'm gonna come underneath with my
left
and i'm gonna walk my hands as close as
i can
using that towel
right because we're just gonna kind of
hold it here
one arm is getting a big stretch upward
and the other one
upside down you guys feel that yeah now
if you wanted to you could kind of
pull with the up upward you could kind
of pull this shoulder into a little bit
more
stretch and then you could pull down
with the bottom arm
and so you can go up and down
or you can just hold it right you can
just hold it here
beautiful all right let's go right back
up so you're going to go back into that
shoulder stretch
so that we can repeat it on the other
side and we can work the arms in the
opposite direction so you're here you're
getting that nice shoulder
opener remember you're just beyond
the head so you're not too far back you
want to be
safe with those shoulders then you're
going to drop it
one arm and then come underneath with
the opposite arm
and you're going to walk it closer now
you might not get as close
on one side which is totally normal
but try to keep your upright posture try
not to start hunching forward because
that tends to happen
right when you're tight this whole
shoulder girdle is getting a big stretch
lots of muscles you probably didn't know
you had because usually you're like wait
wait ah this is tough but that's why you
have a towel so that you can go further
apart
and you can slowly start to crawl those
hands closer together
[Music]
breathing it out oh and relax
that should feel like kind of numbing
kind of tingly
because your muscles are just saying
thank you
all right now you're going to go up and
over the head and your legs are going to
be wide
we're going to do a side bend so i'm
going to have you
open up to one side and you're going to
kind of shift your hips
to the same side that you that you
rotate bringing the
towel across the top of the body and
you're getting the big stretch
through the side that you're stretching
away from okay so the towel is there to
just kind of
make you pull a little bit you don't
want to go too far
and then switch sides open the other
side i kind of shift my hips just to
create a balance so that
i don't feel like i'm going to fall over
because you don't want to feel like
you're going to fall over you kind of
give your hips
a little bit of support here because
you're getting a big stretch through
your lats
and through obliques and through your
sides and when you're doing a lot of
this plank work go ahead and switch one
more time each side
when you're doing a lot of plank work
you're doing a lot of shoulder work
you want to make sure that you're
getting the lateral stretches you
deserve because
you're working a lot of lateral muscle
groups
good and now i'm going to have you take
three deep breaths with
us okay this is going to be where you
repeat a mantra that empowers you
to keep going to keep giving yourself
this treatment of strength and
conditioning and health
ready so inhale
exhale repeat that mantra
one more
my mantra was love because that's what i
feel
every time i press play every time i
show up for myself
i hope you have a strong mantra for
yourself this week we'll see you next
workout
