this calming soothing meditation

now once you've found a comfortable seat
or you're laying down
i want you to just take a moment take a
deep breath
and close your eyes
place your palms on your thighs or down
by your knees
facing up and begin to inhale through
the nose for four counts
hold at the top for four counts release
to exhale
for four counts and then hold at the
bottom
of your breath for four counts let's try
a couple breaths together
[Music]
begin to imagine your stress so small
that it can fit in the palm of your
hands
imagine that you are so much bigger than
your stress
because you are now
picture yourself giving wings to your
stress
imagine your stress as a bird ready to
take flight
[Music]
allow your stress to fly away
let go of it as it travels off into the
distance
where it no longer has any power over
you
as the stress gets further away and you
can barely even see it or feel its
presence
anymore i want you to now imagine your
passion your strength your love
your peace all replacing that bird
that has carried away your stress
you get to choose passion strength
love peace and all of the other good
feelings you deserve
[Music]
as you go about your day continue to
embrace the good
and know that you have the power
start to wiggle your fingers and your
toes
as you come back into the space take one
more
deep inhale and exhale
sigh it out and slowly blink your eyes
open
thank you so much for joining me today
and taking this time to energize your
body
and say peace out to bad vibes this
practice is inspired by ollie goodbye

restored
