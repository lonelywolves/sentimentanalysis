and reach so down to plank on our knees
we're just going to reach forward tap
the ground in front of us and put our
hand back
now when we're doing this we want to
make sure we don't sway too much keep
that core on

possible

into that shoulder tap and rocking chair
now if you feel like you're more
advanced you can stay up in a high plank
position
and do the rocking chair from here it's
totally up to you
keep going one more
and down into that plank and reach so

squats starting now so push your hips
back like you're sitting into a chair
come back up like you did in the glute

so that's what i want you to think about
keep that back nice and straight that
chest
nice and open when you're doing a squat
keep going
20 seconds to go i want you to focus on
those knees coming out or your knees
over your toes now not
over your toes like that we just mean in
line with your toes
good 10 seconds to go
you can go as fast or as low as you want
to go down into mountain climber
in five four three
two one now same thing your wrists and
your shoulders in line and you're going
side to side with those knees so not a
traditional mouth climber when you're
going to the front you're going
side touching your opposite knee to
elbow or in that direction
if you need drop down you shake out your
wrists a little bit
and come back in
it's not about how fast you can go it's
about form and control
keeping that bum down nice and straight
with your back
breathing
three two one
and standing up again and back into
those squats
thirty seconds remember what he said so
if your knees are coming
in like that try and push them out so
they're in line with your toes

down and pick the other one up
we're gonna hold it above our head our
knees are coming up

ten seconds nine eight

three two one and done
and rest before we get into some
stretches to cool down
right so the first stretch while you're
sitting there
and grabbing a drink is we're just going
to put our hands behind our back
and we're going to stretch out our chest
from doing those chest breaths
and high planks things like that so
nice deep breaths everyone get into it
hands behind your back chest up nice
and you know you can stand up you can be
down underneath whatever it's up to you
nice deep breaths you can bring your
hands up when you feel up to it
this is definitely something that i need
to work on for sure
good and from there we're going to move
into stretching out our hip flexors
and our quads so coming up what i want
you to do is i want you to get into what
looks like a lunge position and then i
want you to bring your foot a little bit
more forward so
like this and we're going to move from
here
forward but then we're also gonna put
our hands on the ground like this if you
need
we're just gonna hold our foot
pull it towards us and then come back
stretch out all these things
if you can you can even lift your back
foot up
stretching out that quad if you need
balance if you have a couch or a chair
you can have your hand on the couch or
the chair
let's just stretch out our legs swapping
legs now
same thing oh my weights are in the way
forward and back for a few
and if you can holding your back leg
holding something for balance if you
need
[Music]
if you can't do that that's totally fine
just sink a little bit more into that
hip flexor
next something that we all need to work
on especially me we're going to stretch
out our glutes now you can do this a few
ways whichever way is feel comfortable
for you so if you know a glute stretch
that feels good for you you can
for me i'm just going to lay down on the
ground like this
to place i'll move a little bit this you
can see it my leg like this
holding underneath i'm going to bring it
towards me
all right with this elbow i sort of push
this leg out a little bit
so i get that nice deep stretch and then
we're going to swap
sides
definitely something i need to work on
as well guys
from here we're going to stretch out our
abs now you can definitely rewind this
video rewind this cool down and do this
for longer if you need this is a great
one to do before bed
as well those muscles get really tight
during the day
and we're just going to stretch out our
abs here
