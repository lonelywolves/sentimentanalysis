today is your core focus workout with a
touch of self-massage
you will tighten and tone your body but
finish with some foam rolling
to release tension in the muscles grab a
pair of light free weights and a foam
roller and let's do this
this episode of class foot sugar is
presented by voltaire
feel the joy of movement today we've got
danny to show you all the modifications
abia's over here it's going to be
rocking and rolling with you as well
today we're going to start down on the
mat with a little bit of a warm up for
that body
get the blood flowing starting in a
kneeling
hip flexor pulse so you want one foot up
you want the other knee down on the
floor to start hands to the inside of
that foot
and i'm gonna have you just pulsing
bending the elbows gently allowing your
hips to sink
further and further towards the floor so
right away i'm going to get you into a
little bit of hip mobility
and depending on your flexibility you
might not be able to go very low
you also might feel like you know what i
want to pick that back knee up
i'm ready for a little bit more of an
intense stretch and that's okay too
wherever you feel like you are right now
is where you should kind of stick with
it and then drop the knee if you're
already up
and switch legs so we're getting a good
extension here through the hips
hands come to the inside you're gonna
pulse
letting the hips sink further and
further towards the floor
good opening up you know use your hip
flexors a lot during core exercises so i
really wanted to open them up
if you want to increase the intensity
you can pick the back knee up off the
floor
you do where you feel is the best
intensity for you as you're getting
started because you don't want to push
it too hard
you're just getting warmed up oh yeah
good and relax bring that back knee all
the way back and go into all fours for a
cat and dog stretch
so when you're working your core you
always want to warm up the spine you're
going to arch up pull the shoulder
blades apart
and then drop the belly lift the head
alright so you're just giving a nice
stretch through the spine
pulling all the back muscles giving them
a lengthen
and then drop the belly lift the head
alright because you have muscles that
align your spine on the front and the
back and this is where you really get to
elongate all of them warm them up
bring the blood flow you're going to be
working those core muscles today
awesome now here we're going to go into
a down dog stretch but if you want to
follow danny for a child's pose so tuck
the toes
and lift the hips up towards the sky and
i want you to really press your hips up
towards the sky
and the heels down towards the floor
so you're feeling a big stretch through
the hamstrings
now i love child's pose here because it
still stretches out the back and the
shoulders
and you're getting a nice extension of
the body here is a little more intense
the back of the hamstrings
and the calves and you're working your
shoulders a little bit and
come on down nice it's not easy right
let's come on
to your feet all right get you warmed up
we're going to go with a side bend get a
nice stretch to the side of the body
have your feet wide and you're going to
reach up and over
you can kind of bend into that knee a
little bit right but i want you to think
about stretching up towards the sky
opening up your side body taking a
couple deep breaths
in two more seconds here
breathe it out good now we're gonna go
into a march we're gonna really start to
get
a nice little flexion in the side of the
body the obliques we're gonna try to
bring that knee
up towards the same side elbow and
you're going to start to open up your
hips here
you really kind of feel that stretch
right ladies it's like ah
get that leg up there and you're working
on the obliques
as you're driving that knee up to meet
that elbow
if it doesn't get there it's awesome
it's fine but your goal
is to say can i get my knee a little
higher
each time i do this workout right and
you're going to get that flexibility
through the hips
as you're moving through a lot of the
mobility exercises
and getting yourself going last one
and relax now we're going to do a leg
swing here
starting with runner arms you're going
to take a step you're going to kick
and step back so it's a little dance
move kind of yeah
you step kick and now you're using your
abs here to get the leg lift
and what you're doing is also getting a
good stretch throughout that hamstring
now if you want to advance this
you would not step back and you would
try to be swinging that leg
oh look at you yeah that's it so you can
always add this advanced version
good back and forth and then switch up
legs okay so just start
with the first kick and i like having
the runner arms i think that's really
good
you're kind of getting your arms moving
you're working on some coordination
abs are fired up as you kick that leg
straight then if you want to advance
go ahead and try to balance and swing
so really think about tightening the
core
good using the abs to pull that leg up
get that good kick
yeah good all right nice grab your light
free weights or no weights if you're
modifying with danny okay because
this one can be intense at first we're
going to start by
going into a little sumo squat we're
going to be working on
an overhead reach to work the obliques
so
go as low as you feel pretty comfortable
you want your weights up here at 90
degrees
and i'm gonna have you reach up just
across the top of your head
you're not going much further than that
so you're not going very far
you're staying low in those legs so you
have to stabilize
and then you're giving it a big reach so
that you have to stabilize
with the side of your body
working on that core good staying low
you're doing great
breathe it out side to
oh my legs are burning oh yes my abs are
on fire
good obviously the heavier you heavier
you go
the more work it's going to require but
start light
you know we're going with three pounds
here and i can feel the work
all through my obliques last one and
come up
all right give the legs just a second
because we're gonna go into a sumo squat
and twist
so this next one you're gonna go down
low again all right sit into it
you've got the weights here now you can
either do a twist like danny right here
back and forth if you have weight great
if you don't
that's it that you can keep this going
or you can join abby and i
we're gonna punch punch we're gonna add
a little extension
now when i extend my arm it is so much
harder on my abs
okay i have to really tighten i have to
really control
all right so start with just a little
twist
all right and then you can move up to a
little bit more movement
and then if you want to add the
extension you can do that
back and forth you're looking great and
relax
coming on up all right now marching it
out i want you to work the shoulders a
little bit here
because every time you do that requires
a little more stability from your core
you're going to bring the knee up across
the body
and touch opposite elbow to knee so
standing ab move here you're getting
that twist
exhale as you bring that knee up towards
the elbow
so you feel yourself exert and pull that
belly button in towards your spine
really think about pull the belly button
in
good exhale the breath i hear it back
there
good ladies i feel it wind coming up
through my neck right now
good job you got it breathing it out
elbows are high
back and forth two and one all right now
let's bring the weights down come on to
the floor and we're gonna go into a side
plank
with a reach and a little lift leg if we
want to advance the move
so coming down into a side plank i want
you to lift up
all right you're down on the knee
supported by the elbow
and i want you to reach up over the top
of your head you want to know why it
makes it a little heavier for you
to hold that plank now if you want to
advance this move
i'm going to have you lift and lower
your top leg just a little
all right because we're working on the
glutes we're feeling it
breathe it out you're holding that side
plank if you've got to come down and
rest every once in a while that's fine
all right otherwise lift and then find
yourself
giving that little pulse because you're
working all the muscles here on the
outside
of the legged glute you're feeling your
abs stabilize and
relax all right coming on to the other
side you guys doing good
feeling all right back over you're in
that side plank
lift now this alone is a huge
challenge for your core so this is okay
to stay here
and occasionally if you need to drop and
give yourself a rest that's okay
otherwise add this little pulse with
that top leg
feel yourself squeeze the core
abs are nice and tight keep your hips up
tall
i know it's hard it's like i want to
drop
i want to drop but you can do this
you're looking great
every time that leg comes up your hips
are going to want to drop right
so it's fighting gravity here fighting
dropping down
good and relax okay back up on your feet
ladies
it's like yeah your arms are tingling
grab your weight we're gonna go through
one more round your body is warm now
so i think you'll have a little more
mobility through the legs come down into
your sumo squat
and let's go with the reach so let's
raise that hand
up and over get nice and low
good pull the belly button in towards
the spine so you're thinking about
really keeping a nice tight center
breathing each time you reach
staying nice and low
[Music]
that's it nice job you guys
exhale my shoulders get worked
too right good
last couple seconds here you're doing
great
i know the legs are burning abs are
stabilizing come on up
and we're gonna go into that twist right
so again
working on the core but working on the
legs
and when you're doing both you're
feeling the stability you have to fire
up
so we're here or we're gonna add that
punch so right now you can add it
or stay with danny right she's got it
awesome extending
oh baby my legs my arms my hands
they're doing great you guys keep
breathing a lot of internal you can do
this yeah
that's it you got to keep your mind
intact you got to keep yourself focused
on the breath good
and come up nice job all right marches
so elbow's up at 90.
let's do this going opposite knee to
elbow
and you're trying to control this one a
lot of times it's easy for that leg to
just go
oh you know drop it but i want you to
think about trying to
keep that knee up for like a pulse right
a
count and keep those abs tight as you
pull up
and i'm adding the twist through my
trunk
there's so much going on right now for
your core
good job nice job looking good avia
looking good danny
thank you awesome breathing it out
doing great three two
and one all right back down onto the
floor we got our side plank
with our leg raise for the advanced
version so come on down
stabilize here all right you got one hip
you're really fighting to stay up reach
up over the head
keep a nice strong posture here only
then
if you feel good add the pulse
lifting the leg you're doing great good
breathe it out that's it
a couple more seconds you're doing great
it's all about tightening and toning
that midsection today
which includes the glutes the obliques
all the abdominal muscles
right so we're really feeling all those
areas getting tight good
switch it up other side don't worry your
massage is coming
yeah she's coming i wish it was
a nice massage but it's one of those
massages that hurts so good
right feel it in the after that's
it you'll love it after good lifting
those hips come on keep it high
i feel like this side is so much weaker
so my hips just want to fall to the
floor right
yeah you feel that so if you don't do
the lift
you can stay up much higher and that's
fine i might not
you know be able to do as many leg lifts
on this side
or i might just feel like oh man i gotta
fight through the burn i gotta feel this
you're creating a balance through your
body breathe
it out all about that balance that's it
good three
two and relax you guys
awesome job with that circuit you guys
are amazing way to rock it
now we're gonna come down onto our back
for this next one aren't you psyched
we're not on our feet for this next one
all you're gonna do is start by pulling
that knee to the chest
extending the opposite leg up towards
the sky
now the lower that leg goes the more
you're using your abs
but i want you to press your low back
down into the floor
and you're going to switch legs you're
going to hug one knee
extend the other leg and switch now the
lower that leg goes towards the floor
the harder it's going to be to keep your
low back press
towards the ground so really think about
pulling your low back down towards the
floor
and you're giving yourself a nice little
hug if you want to advance this one
you might lift your shoulder blades lift
your head
up and off the mat yes so it's going to
be a little harder
it's going to engage the abs a little
bit more you got to do what feels right
for you and i don't want you to strain
your neck
so if this is straining the neck just
allow yourself
to stay down but keep your low back
pressed
now we're going to switch and go into no
hands so you're going to bring your
hands behind your head
start by keeping your hands and
shoulders on the ground and start
kicking back and forth one knee comes
into the chest
the other extends long i'm gonna go low
to the floor because i've been doing
this ever since
i started this program four months ago
and i am able to now lengthen long
and if you want to advance you can pick
those shoulder blades up
and you can extend from there all right
but don't strain the neck
really keep the low back press towards
the floor
kick that heel out remember kicking up
towards the sky makes it a little easier
because you got less weight on the abs
you're doing amazing
keep it going awesome job breathe
and relax
all right now danny you're gonna stay
down here to show them the modified
bridge
as you come up and lift i want you to
come up
squeeze and lift now i want you to come
up to your hands
if you can abby and i are going to show
you a bridge from the hands
and we're going to lift and bridge up
and then down and now this move
can come all the way to a reach so if
you can lift one hand
off the floor and reach come back down
to the floor and switch sides
that's going to be the next phase the
next challenge
but right now you see three variations
the progression
of how to get right here to this
overhead reach in a reverse
bridge working the back working the
glutes working the obliques
good job you guys shoulders everything
right you feel that through your
shoulders too right avia
whoo nice job you guys couple more
seconds
breathing it out i love that reach
because it really works
my last it works my glutes my obliques
shoulders and everything good
i always have to remind myself to
squeeze the booty at the top squeeze the
booty at the top
press through the heels and relax okay
now the butterfly boat you're gonna lay
flat on your back again
and you're gonna have the the feet
together and the knees open in butterfly
position
i want you to support the head with your
hands behind your head
and the first move of this you're gonna
lift just your shoulders
up towards the sky you're gonna lift
your chest and shoulders off
of the mat okay holding for about a
count
of five so you're breathing press the
low back into the floor
really think about pressing that low
back into the floor
now drop the head and shoulders and i
want you to lift the feet
now you'll notice danny's going to lift
her feet a little higher with their
knees together
because that's going to create less
weight on your low back if your legs are
lower and wide
it's way harder then drop your legs and
lift your chest again
that's it so we're alternating from the
upper body
to the lower body good and then drop it
down
and lift the legs but each time you're
lifting the chest
or the legs you're pressing your low
back to the floor so you want to imagine
you had a towel under your middle back
and somebody was trying to pull it out
and you're fighting them you're not
letting them
and then drop those feet lift the chest
and shoulders
good come on don't let anyone pull that
towel out from underneath your back
don't let them pull it and then drop
that lift the feet
hold it squeeze those abs press the low
back to the floor
breathe drop it now both are gonna lift
for this last one
lift the chest and the legs remember if
the knees come higher
it's easier if they're lower it's harder
you've got to find where you feel the
strength is right
and not going to injure the back because
you got it flat on the floor
and relax all right my friend
now we're going to go through it one
more time so you're going to start here
with the knee to chest
and you're kicking the opposite leg out
nice and long and you're alternating
legs now remember here you can
immediately pick up the shoulders
if you want to off the floor keep the
low back
press into the ground good exhale
remember you can kick your legs up
further towards the sky for less
weight so that you can modify that way a
couple more seconds here
[Music]
good and relax we're gonna go no hands
so you're starting here hands behind the
head
start kicking one leg out knee in
towards the chest
alternating sides all right extending
keeping the low back
press down towards the floor you want to
add that intensity
lift the shoulders you can always do
that anytime
right anytime or if you're like oh my
gosh my low back is coming off the floor
then maybe you've got to let yourself
come down
right and give yourself just a little
bit of that release in the neck
and make sure the abs are still working
to keep that back safe
exhaling breathing awesome job you guys
are looking great
that's it three two
one and relax all right so we're going
up into the bridge
here lifting and squeezing and coming
back down towards the floor
all right you can come up to the hands
if you're ready to progress
i know that we've been working on this
getting our shoulders to open
up working on the glutes coming up
and we've been working on adding that
reach
right so that we can really get the back
engaged
the obliques of fire up and over
you're looking good i know this one is
not easy
good ladies looking great squeeze the
glutes at the top
make sure to press through your heels as
you're lifting those hips
that's where you're really gonna fire up
your glute
gonna get that muscle to wake up say
hello
hello welcome to life here's some blood
and oxygen good couple of seconds left
two one and relax
butterfly bow i know you love it
or maybe not but you'll love it later
when your abs are sore and you're
feeling stronger
so starting in butterfly position
immediately before you start this i want
you to press your low back into the
floor
i want you to think about pulling your
belly button towards the floor
and your low back should come flat now
you have that towel underneath your low
back right nobody can get it out from
underneath you
now lift your shoulders and chest up
towards the sky
hold that three two
one drop it lift the legs up
breathe two three
four five drop the legs
lift the chest up two
three four five
drop the shoulders lift the legs up one
two breathe quiet
keep your low back press down tight good
drop it
lift the shoulders up two breathe
drop the shoulders lift the legs come on
boom
we're gonna finish with a grand finale
of both up at the
same time drop the legs ready lift
chest and legs go up that's it
breathe big exhales press your low back
down
if you've got to pick your knees up a
little bit that's okay
bring them closer to your elbows all
right you can do this keep your knees
open if you want that challenge keep it
lower to the floor if you want that
challenge
and relax awesome
job you guys are gonna get better and
better at that every
single week okay so we're gonna start
with that self massage next all right
we're gonna grab our foam rollers and
we're gonna bring it the long ways
on our mat okay so what you wanna do is
have it nice and long here
so that you can sit all the way at the
very bottom
right because you want it to be long
enough to support you
all the way to the top of your head so
you're going to roll back
so that your head and your hips are
supported by the roller
now we're going to do a snow angel here
so your palms are up towards the sky
you're letting the back of your hands
rest on the floor
and you want to keep them on the floor
as if you're painting
a big line on the floor as you raise
your
arms up over the head now right here
is as far as i can go keeping my hands
on the ground so if that's you
wherever your hands start to come off
the ground that's where you stop
and you come all the way back the goal
is to get the hands all the way up over
the head but it doesn't always happen
in the beginning like for me right now
i'm really tight
i haven't done this yet today it's the
first one
i'm not feeling it oh i just went a
little higher that time right
so i'm gonna come all the way back down
so it's a snow angel and you want to
make sure you're actually making a mark
in the ground your hands aren't just
gliding along the top
you're letting them stretch so some
people might only get to here
they might get even and they're like oh
i can't go any further
they'll come right back down and you're
gonna notice that you get further and
further
and this is opening up your chest
opening up your shoulders
getting a good stretch oh i went even
further then
me too good avi you're feeling a benefit
right you're feeling a difference good
job
now this next one you're gonna clasp
your hands together
up over your body and you're gonna come
over the belly button here
and then all the way over the top of the
head
trying to bring the hands to the floor
but keep your palms together right so
you're really grasping
the palms and you're keeping those hands
together and you're just letting your
arms
your lats your shoulders everything is
getting a great stretch
all right breathe and just let yourself
go through your own pace here
all right this can feel a little
uncomfortable if it's your very first
time stretching the upper body and
giving yourself some of this mobility on
the foam roller
right but this is the stuff that really
makes a difference in your fitness
because you
avoid getting injured you start feeling
healthier
during all the exercises because you
don't feel these
aches and pains in your shoulders and
all that stuff happening
all right and relax now we're going to
come off of this foam roller
and i like to just kind of come off to
the side just like you got on it but you
just kind of roll off to the side
and you're going to bring the roller for
a back bend so you're going to bring it
the long ways
and you're going to roll onto it with
the shoulders
just underneath the roller and your
elbow should be just behind
it all right you feel that good now
support your head and neck here
in this position and allow yourself to
do a little back bend over the top
of the roller so feel yourself get a
little extension don't go
too far just start to feel where you're
at and then come forward
pull your abs in tight you're doing a
little mini crunch here
right and so most people have never done
a back bend
because it's way too aggressive and most
of us aren't gymnasts
but we can do a little mini backbend
here to avoid that
hunch that happens when we don't have
any mobility through the middle back
this is releasing tension all along the
spine and those muscle groups
that really opens up your posture you go
to where you feel comfortable
and you know mildly uncomfortable but
not pain feel it yeah
yeah it feels good feels so good it
feels great
beautiful oh great job you guys now
you're going to bring that roller
underneath your back as if it's your
pillow
we're going to pillow it up with the
foam hole yeah this one
comes right underneath the neck yeah
we're going to take a little nap
yeah all right so here it's right
underneath your neck
and you're gonna roll your head to the
left or right
and slowly okay slowly roll
so that you feel the muscles along the
base of the skull
get a little pressure and then you're
going to roll to the other side so that
you're rolling slow
and you're feeling the pressure of each
individual muscle that's attaching to
the base of that skull
just allow your torso to relax and just
go at your own pace
rolling your neck side to side feeling a
nice little pressure release
i feel like when i get all the way over
to the left and right
is where i have the most tension
oh doing this back and forth about three
or four
times is going to make you feel like a
new person
and when you're opening up the blood
flow and the tension here
you get so much more to the brain where
you function better you
think more clearly you're more patient
you have more focus
and you're more productive yes so much
happening for you in this moment
so take a nice deep breath and enjoy
breathe it out
nice job beautiful
okay now we can stay here forever and
you can stay there longer if you want to
pause and stay
but we're going to come up and show you
the it band
and the shins because these are two very
very important moves that you should be
doing
during this program okay keep you
healthy keep your knees healthy
you're gonna bring the roller underneath
the side of your thigh
where your it band is you're gonna come
onto your elbow so it's supported
and your top leg is here to support your
body weight
otherwise you're very heavy on the
roller at first and i want you to find a
tender spot
on the side of your thigh it might be
like right now you feel it you're like
ah
i got the spot i feel it found it if
it's there you're not moving very far
over it you're just
on that spot of tension and you're just
doing a gentle
small movement over it so the goal in
foam rolling is to keep pressure
on the tight areas that's when it
releases
so you want to give it some love give
each tender spot
a little bit of love don't leave it very
soon
keep it there embrace it i know it's
painful
use the top leg here to lift your body
weight
up off the roller at first if it feels
too tender
all right that's how you can release
some of that tension
i know right now the first time if it's
your first time
come on down let's switch sides it feels
like there's a rock
in your leg right it feels as though
there's a
sharpness going on but that will loosen
up over time
and you'll have less and less tension
in your body which means now your knees
are happier
your hips your low back that is so
important when you're getting your
fitness back
to keep these muscles loose and tension
free
and the best way to do it is the foam
roller and we're only here for a couple
minutes right
i know it feels like a lifetime in the
moment
but it's not a lifetime it's a couple
minutes of
uncomfortable feelings in your body that
will get better
and easier each time you do it
good yeah i'm like oh
yeah our faces are probably
they feel so good when you finish though
it does yeah like we have new legs
all right and come on down so you gave
some love to one spot now next time you
do it
give it to another spot right now shins
are last
and what we're gonna do is first we come
down
and we bring the foam roller underneath
the knees
okay and i'm on my toes here now
i'm going to lean forward on my hands
and i'm just going to roll
onto the middle of my shins keeping my
toes on the floor
and i can feel the pressure of my upper
thighs
pushing my my shins into the roller i
don't really need to do much more than
this
it's kind of fun too yeah yeah so
if you're a runner if you walk if you do
hills if you
hike if you do anything using your lower
body
over time that repetition gets really
really tender
it gets tight in the shin areas and a
lot of people
aren't paying attention to that and then
they get the shin splints
and then they get sore knees and ankles
get tight
so you want to make sure that you do
these types of
you know tension releasing exercises
just to give yourself that release keep
your body healthy
and relax you guys amazing job i know
that's new for so many of you
but keep with it you're amazing and
we'll see you next time
