hey beautiful people I have my awesome
friend Stacy Beeman here ready to lead
us through a plyo gym workout Thank You
JJ I'm so excited to bring you dance
powered by plyometrics you are going to
crank the music and dance like you have
never danced before oh yeah let's jump
it out all right guys today we are doing
a piyo gym workout that means we're

to be doing some jump training however
if you are not ready for jump training
you're gonna follow my girl Christina
over here she is gonna be showing you
the modified moves and then my girl
Dasia over here is going to be filleting
and then I'll be kind of somewhere in
the middle okay so you choose the level
you want to be at but what I want to
encourage you is to always make sure
that you land properly when you do a
jump squat or any other kind of jumping
okay so remember when you come down and
then you explode into the air you want
to land softly with bent knees it is so
important never lay on straight leg oh
my gosh that would be so bad so make
sure your safe landing gently and you'll
be good to go
are you guys ready to go let's get going
whoo all right we're gonna start with
some shoulder rolls here we go take it
