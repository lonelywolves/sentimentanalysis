hey susie how's everybody doing good
morning guys
all right welcome to your 30 minute
extend bar full body workout so guys
if you are new to bar no worries you
need no dance background
you don't have to be flexible you can be
uncoordinated you can have two left feet
and you will still
benefit and get results from this
workout i'm so excited actually you've
never tried bar i'm so excited for you
to try it today
so guys all you need today is just you
i'm going to be using a ballet bar here
for stability but if you don't have a
bar at home which probably most of you
don't
just grab onto a bar stool you can use a
countertop
you can even use like a window to put
your hand against anything that's going
to help you to have stability and
balance to do the bar portion
um and that's it that's all you need and
if you want to amp it up
you can grab onto a set of hand weights
i'm going to be demonstrating everything
without hand weights and i'm going to be
showing you some modifications
throughout
but i'll give you little prompts where
you can add in those weights to add a
little bit extra
upper body because we're gonna be
focusing mostly on the lower body today
and the core
all right guys i'm gonna turn on the
music and we're gonna get started hey
kristen
