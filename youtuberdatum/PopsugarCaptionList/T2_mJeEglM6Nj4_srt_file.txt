i'm here with tara on my right who will
be doing modifications in ellie on my
left
that will be sticking with me throughout
the entire leg workout get
ready to burn girl okay now we're gonna
start with some dynamic warm-up
we're gonna kick these legs get the
blood flowing full body
i want you to really reach to that
opposite leg
that's kicking up high so you can get a
good hamstring stretch
and a good stretch to the outside of the
leg now if you can't kick it up as high
as me
well that's most people okay that's why
i'm rainier
and i'm in charge of the workout okay i
always say you can take this job when
you can
kick higher than i can so
exhale kick it up try to keep those legs
nice and long
flex that quad get as much of a
hamstring stretch as you can
we've got less than 15 more seconds here
this is getting that blood flowing full
body
that rotation through the upper body
through that thoracic
spine is going to help warm you up for
all the hinging
exercises all the squats because trust
me there's a lot of them today
last kick here and speaking of hinging
let's get right into that the main thing
i want you to focus on is keeping your
upper body nice and neutral
so abs in neutral spine push your hips
back
and lift them high as you reach towards
the ground
now you don't have to touch the ground
you can just go what i like to say
pass the knees with those hands and
squeeze so just a couple inches
past the knees is what hair is showing
you over there
but i and ellie are trying our best
to touch the floor just a little tap and
a booty squeeze i don't even have to
think stand up
i just think squeeze so lift it
and squeeze it to bring it high and just
focus on
warming up those hamstrings and yes i
would say
one of the biggest things people ask me
can i avoid bending my knees here can i
keep it
nice straight legs and if you have that
kind of a flexibility available to you
feel free to get into that i still like
workouts we're really going after
working this booty
to keep a little bit of a knee bend and
it actually
helps get a little bit more glute
activation and
helps that lower back feel a little bit
more supported
so now we're going to touch the ground
pause there and then
drop the booty hands to prayer sit low
weight is still pushing through my heels
squeeze and stand tall
so we're coming down low touch still
focusing on that nice neutral spine
how low can we sit and stand up tall
so i love that tara's just dropping her
hips
to the height of her knees i'm trying to
lower this booty all the way to the
floor
let's see what that range of motion can
do
sitting low i'd squeeze if you can't get
as low as i can well maybe you're
setting a new goal for yourself
that's what makes life worth living
finding a goal
and pursuing it okay now
last but certainly not least no more
standing up we're going to tap the
ground
and sit and return right back to that
hinge
if you feel that you need a little break
and you need to stand up between any of
these
that's no problem this is your workout
you do what feels right
for your body but if you can let's just
go from that hinge
to this squat and finish out
this warm-up we got 15 seconds remaining
so between both of these movements my
heels
have the majority of my weight at least
a good 60
the next time you sit low stand up high
and consider yourself warm guy
now i said we're only working these legs
and that's why you only see a pair of
heavy weights out in front of me
because that's what we're doing with
these big old powerful muscle groups
operation
destruction so i love putting it up in
front of my clavicle
front loaded because it really counter
balances your hips
so we can sit down low push that butt
back weight on the heel stand tall and i
want a nice calf raise
now with that calf raise i want you
to really focus in on squeezing that
butt
when your heels come up and finish the
motion stand all the way up
give me my calf raise drop your heels
then get into that squat
so bring it up nice and high and what i
love
about front loaded squats it helps you
stay tall in your upper body
so although i keep saying we're just
working these legs y'all
the truth of the matter is you're
getting a great core exercise
and you can stay on those toes as long
as you like because you're not wasting
time you're squeezing that butt
okay less than 20 seconds remaining
if you want to go at a faster pace feel
free
that may tell me something about those
weights and how you feel about them
though
okay because if the weights are low
light you're able to move faster but if
they're
heavier and you're getting into like
some really good strength training
you're going to want to really control
that pacing
and not rush it last one here
and rest so we're going to get into more
of an aerobic movement right now
so that's why i would prefer you do
heavy weights
and keep your faster movements for these
aerobic movements that we have planned
so i want you to sit low and then we're
gonna jump the feet together squeeze
that butt
and have a moment locking out these
knees tear is
going side to side and that's also an
option
how low can you sit squeeze that button
come up
so this is a longer interval i want to
go a good
40 seconds maybe a little bit longer i'm
the instructor i can do it alone
but i want you to know that if you're
getting fatigued
you can pause here and you can pause
here
those are the two options you're not
allowed to just stand up and stare at me
though you gotta be
in some kind of flex position you
understand me we have 15 seconds
remaining
and we're going to make it through drop
it low let's squeeze it hey
those abs do work whenever you're in any
position of balance
that entire body needs to be in on the
fun
last moments here come on up squeeze it
let's get back down
and rested very nice now we're going to
go right back to these
weights so now feet together
i want you to abduct place it down
controlled
give me a nice symmetrical squat and
then step towards that weight
so abduct sit low
and bring it in so we're going side to
side good lateral movement
not only are we getting into lateral
movement we're just getting into one
more element
of control so you're opening that leg
and i want you to make sure you're not
lunging here you're not putting a
disproportionate amount of weight
to the leg that moved out open
put it down sit those hips right in
between
okay oh now
the funny part about this is both legs
are working
when you raise that leg the leg that
stays behind is pushing into the ground
and so that glute is on the leg that
you're lifting that glute
is being abducted so i want you to just
stay
focused be patient with yourself if you
feel any issues with balance
because the heavier your weights are the
harder the balance component
is going to be final one i feel like i
extended this interval because i'm
dreading the idea of jumping again
okay dumbbells down so
we're getting those same jumps or
walking side to side
but i want you to pulse for a good two
or three seconds so that means
i get to make this interval longer yep
you gotta give it again
so we pulse two one
squeeze that button we pulse two
one and squeeze it okay so
no time wasted low bounce in those hips
abs are in so you can feel nice and
supported in the center of your body
and again if you want to stay on those
toes even longer
nobody's mad at you but i want to remind
you
or at least say to you for the first
time that we will be on the ground after
this so
let's fight through and let it burn you
know what i mean we're gonna be on our
back
not specifically relaxing or anything
but hey i'm giving you something
less than 20 seconds remaining bouncing
that butt
i promise you we do twerk a little bit
later i know you're attempting
to do that right now i got two amazing
dances behind me
i gotta you know take advantage y'all
so we will be getting into some work but
now
we just squeeze oh last one here last
one here
and rest well done let's get right down
i want to just keep it flowing grab
these weights we're going to get into
some good old-fashioned hip thrusters
really focusing in on those glutes so i
put the weights on my hip bones but go
anywhere
on the center body where you feel
comfortable and we're just gonna push
through the heels predominantly i'm
tapping my butt on the ground
i'm not resting it my booty does not
ever get to have a quick nap
of all of this resting okay it's like my
butt
and the ground on a first date and i
just give
i gave the ground little peck on the
cheek that's it just like a little mwah
that's
it that's it that's all i'd give on a
first date because i'm a lady thank you
so squeeze it up high and it's not just
your heels that you can push through
here you can also push through like the
center of your feet
it gives you a little bit more hamstring
as well and now no more touching the
ground
that's right no more light kisses you
just get a halfway down
squeeze all the way up halfway down
squeeze all the way up oh my goodness
why wow
you can always tell when i feel it
because i start singing and rest
come on down we can move these weights
just to the side
because we will be grabbing them um in
just a moment
and now we're going to keep our hips up
high and this has a little bit of core
work in it as well put your feet close
together
and we're going to move our feet out out
and in
so i'll start with my right foot so
right left
right left then the left leg left
right left right how gentle can you do
it
right left right left
and then left right left right trying to
keep those hips high the whole time now
to step up the ante you can take your
hand
away from the side of your body so it
takes away some of your base of support
left right left right oh those hips stay
high
they stay high and the glutes stay
burning that's what's up
and you can feel those elements of core
training especially as you bring your
feet
back in towards each other just a couple
more moments here
less than 10 seconds let's finish it
keep the hips high
keep the hips high and rest
very good now i'm going to go to what i
like to call
[Music]
butterfly glute bridge and i know some
people
look at this they're a little weary
about how it might feel on their ankles
i say try it but if you don't feel
it's for you i know that i there's gonna
stick
for regular glute bridge but i'm pushing
my heels into each other
and the outsides of my feet are against
the ground
and i'm just squeezing same deal it's
going to be a much smaller range of
motion
than a normal glute bridge but i still
want that same
kiss philosophy okay your butt's not
having a full makeout session with the
ground
it is just a little a low case
okay a little high and by
[Music]
it's very friendly is the relationship
is what i'm trying to say
[Music]
high and ease is down low and also
notice
i'm not throwing my hips up i'm
squeezing my butt
gently rising and coming back down if
your lower back is feeling too much
sensation feel free to remove a little
bit of weight maybe go down to one
weight
keep a body weight if you need to no
more touching the ground halfway down
all the way up oh
wow okay so this is the workout part
this is the part
where you're fighting and it's um this
is a workout okay
yeah rest it rest oh my goodness
so the little cherry on top of the glue
bridge section
is going to be instead of going out out
in
in we'll be in our glute bridge we're
going to step forward forward
and then back back to the neutral so
hips up high
i'm going to start with right left right
left
and then left right left right now
there are times that people do this is
more of an aerobic activity really fast
but here i want this to be more strength
training so have a pause
and bring it back here you'll see that
tara isn't stepping as far out
to modify the activity although
i might be surprised to watch this video
and find out that i'm modifying it too
so now i'm challenging myself to step
out a little bit more
the further out i step the more the
hamstrings
and that lower back are gonna feel this
as well
as the glutes so again if you want to
step up the ante
camps can go back take away some basic
support
[Music]
last moments here let's finish it keep
those hips high let's fight
let's fight let's fight let's squeeze
and let's ease it down very nice so
we're going to come up
we can have a fun little rounding of the
back knees in towards the chest
see if that makes you feel better round
that back flex those abs for the moment
oh and then we can have a fun way of
getting up here
if you like you rock you roll
you stick your landing was it beautiful
was it beautiful
thank you okay so now we're only going
to be using one dumbbell all the time
so we're going to grab that weight
and we're going to do a little threading
of the needle so for our first one
where we go through a curtsy the hand
that has the weight
is the leg that's gonna move back so my
right leg
goes to the left side of my left foot i
bend that right knee
as low to the ground as i can and that's
when i put the weight underneath and
thread
so left foot goes to the right i thread
and notice i'm not getting that dumbbell
under my leg by bending over
i'm getting it under my leg by bending
my knees so make that lower body do the
work
okay and i know that sometimes when we
get into a curtsy formation it doesn't
always feel great
on some people's knees so tara's
exampling
um just going into a regular reverse
lunge is always a slight modification
very similar exercise
but and very efficient so there's no
shame in that game
ellie how are you feeling on these
curves good you shouldn't stay up
that's part of it in life most of the
time i'm just trying to stay up you know
so stay high and you feel
poised and proud and your chest is up
and open
you know you're meeting the queen of
england
this is i'm practicing for my big day
when i finally meet her
i could see her and i say milady and
they're like that's not what you're
saying i'm like well
they didn't teach me this in america
okay
and rest okay
so you know it's time to get their heart
rate up just a bit
going to one of the drills that i'm
known for we're doing three sprinters
and three skaters so my right foot is
back i'm starting on the left side of my
space
left hand back let's go one time slow
just
near the movement so left hand and right
knee three
two one three skaters i'm jumping
and i know that tears are stepping side
to side and staying low
stop on your third and three two
one stay low stay low
stay low let's have some fun three two
one
push it push it push it okay i want you
to jump over
that little river of water okay
you're wearing your brand new white
sneakers
you don't want to scoff your sneakers
bruh
you're on scottish sneakers jump over
that green grass sometimes i like to
feel like a dancer yeah
you know trying to show out in front of
these professional dancers behind me you
know
and rest good job yeah you can say that
again i need it i need a moment you can
see that woo again
okay we're going to more threading of
the needle
so what we're going to do is this time
a diagonal lunge so you're always
stepping
across your body since the dumbbells in
my left hand
my right leg goes towards the left
i bend the knee i thread have a pause
gather my power push get back in one
step
right hand under the left leg notice my
back foot
turns and is in going the same direction
as i am
so although i'm facing forward right now
when i step across my back foot
turns with me and push if you understand
and you got it
feel free to get into it and keep it
moving but chest up
how low are you going to put that back
knee this is one of those opportunities
where i can literally tap my back knee
to the ground
nice and gently if it's not gentle
i don't want you touching the ground if
you can hear it
if you feel it if it hits the ground and
it sends a shock to your body
no no absolutely not okay
but if it's very gently placed there
like
you want to pretend it's just hard
concrete
if it well it might actually be very
hard concrete so
make sure that you are caring for your
body
not letting your mind wander be focused
on keeping it slow and controlled
and poised okay less than 12 seconds
here
side to side we go side to side
we go where we stop well it's wherever
we are in three
two let's finish even let's get one more
to the side
and put it on down now
now because you have those sprinters
already memorized let's just take it up
to the next level instead of three
sprints
we're gonna have three skips and tara's
gonna show you a nice example where you
just come up tall
and tap that toe back so we'll mirror it
it's three
it's two it's one you land
and you push three two
one and it's three and it's two
and it's one and although this is cardio
just think of
those skips as powerful so three get it
up
two get it up one don't rush them just
give me power
here you have the option of doing
shorter jumps
and speeding them up if you like side to
side or a big powerful jump side to side
both of them will be getting that booty
i promise okay
get the outside of these hips honey get
that glute medius baby
let's get back we're kids again we're
skipping
we're skipping we're young and we're
free
and we believe and we have hope in our
eyes
it's so beautiful come on
to remind you of a better day come on yo
keep it alive keep hope alive skip it up
skip it up
skip it up this is fun we're having fun
you hear me we're having fun
come on finish it santa
just give me my skaters move done give
me my skaters
rest nice job
now one more set of threading the needle
it's a side lunge so with this
you're moving your body weight just
placing it side to side
and when i go to the left my hip
dumbbell is in the right hand
i go to the left i even lift the outside
of my right foot more weight
is on my left leg thread
stand tall power one unit so to the
right
i thread again the outside of my leg is
lifted
and boom you want to push as much weight
that leg that's right underneath your
body as possible in the side lunge
and a lot of this is about actually not
taking
too big of a step notice that my knee
and my feet stay underneath my body
directly they're not
outside of my body so yes i could with
these
long legs step all the way off this mat
but i'll have more control if this
weight is right underneath me
so side to side and also notice i'm
letting my chest
lean over my knee so
although we're dropping that booty
there's still elements of a slight hinge
so don't feel like you have to stay
straight up and down
and stare right at the tv yes you can
take your eyes off me for a moment i
know it's hard
i know i've seen me okay i get it
so let's put it down so you already
understand these skips
i would like to add one more element
pure balance
we're gonna have that foot back and give
me a nice skip and push straight back
the leg in the air is doing a lot of
work i'm almost kicking back
up and kicking back tears showing you an
example of how you can tap your toe
rather than keep that leg in the air the
whole time three
two and one ellie i loved those skaters
i saw your dancer
i saw that dance i don't even know if
that's called a pliers i don't know
right some kind of
complex knowledge okay let's really get
into this power y'all
three two one boom boom boom boom boom
boom
and power it up push back it's like i'm
kicking a wall
that's behind me every time the more
energy you put into that back leg
you're getting more glute work but it
will help your balance i promise
okay throw it throw that leg and push
off the outside of your leg
so push it come
the on is a leg press and you
are pushing against it people on the
other side of the world are like oh my
god
who's pushing the world this way because
you're that powerful
you can change the world you hear me
rainier believes in you i hope you
believe in you too
come on push it up drive it high we're
more than halfway there
you got it push it out if i told you
that this was our last set of skit
and skater what would you do
would you work harder would you want
more from yourself
well i'm hoping that's the case finish
it
okay okay one more on each side one more
at each side
it's too much fun not to run over time a
little bit come on
come on come on push it
push it push it real good
final skaters finish it
good show good show yeah you can get a
hand
you get a high five on that i won't
leave you out yeah okay
now we're getting into more deadlifts
we're increasing the difficulty
by going into pure balance
so we're starting off just one dumbbell
we're going to start off with an
ipsilateral deadlift
meaning the leg that's working and
staying down
is the same as the hand that has the
weight so
again bend that knee and give a lot of
energy to the leg that's in the air so
my left leg is going to go back
push it high i'm leading with my hip not
with this dumbbell
squeeze your butt stand tall and around
if you're not ready for full balance
go into a kickstand um dead left which
is
just what tara's doing over there just
put your toe back
rather than lifting your leg in the air
but again
it's almost like my back leg is what's
really leading the charge and i'm giving
you a lot of time on this because
i want control on your way down power on
your way up
so don't rush these unless you're
feeling very comfortable with them
if your form is staying together that
back is staying long then you can go as
fast as you like to go
but getting low all i need is past the
knee
and squeeze you see how flexible ellie
is basically about to touch the ground i
can get it
boom you didn't know that about me did
you you didn't know that about me what
does he have it on the left leg
hallelujah yes you do okay let's lift
the glute
see how my left heel is really lifting
high
and stand tall right and that little
half satellite around the butt
actually is from core work so get a
little extra credit there
okay dumbbells down now your quads are
feeling good we just
focus on the hamstrings so we're gonna
stay down and we're gonna pulse okay
put the legs wide sit down low hands at
prayer to help you keep those hips up
high
and let's think lots of happy thoughts
think about how much work we did to get
to this moment here
we're like two minutes away from the
workout being done
we're enjoying staying low
we're better friends now i think you
know more about me i think i know a
little bit more about you
we're more than halfway through this set
my legs are starting to burn
we're in this together we're bonding
this is great human interaction this is
what we
want enjoy it it's starting to really
hurt
we've less than 15 seconds so we're
gonna stay in this
okay finish less than 10 seconds we're
loving
we're appreciating we're staying in the
moment
three two one celebration now
celebration though ah what you are
what you want hey side to side okay let
me come up
oh good that was good honestly thank you
but that's work was hard after oh my god
that was hard after holding down like
that
we have one more set of the dead list
now we're going with what we call
contralateral so you
the opposite leg stays down as the hand
that's holding the weight
so since my right hand has it my right
leg comes
up so again lead with the leg that's
lifting give it a lot of energy
push it to the back there and stand tall
squeeze around
and let's switch inhale as you're coming
down
exhale stand up tall just like that so
again
whenever you're working one side of the
body at a time
you're getting a good amount of core
training in there but especially on
these contralateral deadlifts
that is very much getting into that core
and not just these hamstrings and glutes
so
why not kill more than one bird with one
stone
oh poor bird i never really thought
about that thing
who's going around throwing stones at
birds
like birds okay lift high
lift high exhale stand up with authority
i always think of when you're standing
up
you should almost feel like you're in
the military right you just come up like
attention
okay so stay determined allow yourself
to look at the ground
because that means your neck is more
comfortable and staying in alignment
with your spine
and that is how you're gonna have the
best balance i guarantee it
so a lot of times when people in my
class are trying to stare at me the
whole time and they're falling
i'm like you're not focusing enough on
yourself and you're not allowing
yourself to look at the ground
last one here and let's stand on
okay we got one more pulse and i'd love
to encourage you and challenge you to do
it with the weight in your hand
so remember how much you burned last
time expect a little more sensation now
come on down now let's make it fun you
can try to bounce side to side
you know you got to entertain yourself
and i always make this point it's like
yes we know this is going to burn
so why not enjoy the part where it
doesn't burn
okay yes the burn is the workout
the part where it doesn't burn is the
fun out it's gonna happen
i'm gonna make fun out happen i swear
somebody is gonna
tweet me like fun out is a thing i fun
out every day
i fun out like twice a day now it's been
so good
oh see i almost forgot we were posting
see i just i was like wait a minute
where am i what am i oh my pop sugar i'm
working this booty oh okay
i almost forgot getting these legs
worked four
three two and you thought we weren't
going to twerk again but we are though
but we are them but we are now hey who
you
i'm gonna teach you but i have to charge
okay okay y'all let's go down
you've done well the workout is over and
guess what
you're about to get yourself a nice big
old stretch
yeah so we're gonna start off with the
legs wide wide wide wide wide
as wide as you feel comfortable and i
want you to reach your hands up to the
sky
nice deep breath reach it up
exhale forward and again
i'm always trying to tell people the
biggest
um proponent of a good stretch is deep
breaths
so right here take a deep breath to
where you feel the tightest
but imagine it's that low back hamstring
and
exhale try to crawl a little bit further
forward
[Music]
and we're gonna do one more deep breath
but this time i want you to try to lift
your chest high
almost arch that back let yourself push
to almost like you're in cow
and then exhale round forward reach
reach reach reach
i even am allowing my toes to try to go
towards the back of the room
as i reach forward and then let's take
it over to the left
and first i want you to look forward
reach your right hand as far as you can
towards the left side of the room over
your left foot
inhale reach even further
exhale look low turn your belly button
towards your left thigh but try to keep
it away from your left thigh
as you get low so i'm pulling my belly
button in which is allowing
my back to round a bit so i'm getting
more stretch through that back body
and for extra credit try to take that
right toe
towards the back of the room as you're
over this left leg
one more deep breath
[Music]
and then come across on the exhale
and then again over to the right
open your body to the front of the room
reach your left hand
to the right so let's inhale
reach to the right even further and
fill your body with that breath exhale
look down
and again drawing that belly button away
from your right thigh but try to get it
to hover
over that thigh and that left toe
can try to go towards the back of the
room with some external
rotation open up that hip let's get one
more deep breath here
exhale and back to center
and this time let's bring the right foot
forward
the left leg is going to cross over and
i want you to hold on tight tight tight
tight tight
now this may be as far as you're gonna
go
and you feel that stretch up through
that low back a little bit into the
glute
but if you can go into a twist with me
i'm gonna keep it in place with my left
hand
right hand comes up turn to the left
and i'm threading my hand through you do
not need to do that
left hand is pushing the ground away
but if you did thread your hand through
and you can reach around and grab it
feel free to show off that level of
flexibility
holler it took me all year to get this
somebody's going to see this
okay go see how it goes now while you're
here i want you to inhale sit tall
exhale look forward so now we're getting
a little stretch to the neck i'm trying
to get my
chin over my right shoulder
and look forward just a couple breaths
here
inhale sit tall
exhale drive your right knee in your
left ankle stays over
that right knee and the closer you can
sit your booty
to that right heel the more you're going
to feel that stretch to that left side
of piriformis
so i'm not only sitting as close to my
right heel as i can
i'm keeping my chest tall and getting my
chest towards my left shin
bringing a little ankle circle action
here
oh here's some snap crackles and pops
going on in my ankles
yeah it's called being in your 30s it's
going to be great everybody
it's been wonderful at least i have a
savings account now
switch directions ankle circles
and then let's get that right side so
left foot goes forward
right leg is crossed over hold tight
tight tight and again if this is where
you're going to stop
feel free to stop here or hold it in
place with your right hand
left arm up rotate i thread
through again doesn't have to happen
right hand is in back and i i want you
to use that right hand to stay tall
or grab that hand that thread through
and stay tall with your breath and your
posture
inhale sit tall exhale look forward over
that left shoulder
this position always makes me feel like
i'm in a beyonce video like i just feel
so fierce
you look dude oh thank you i also think
it looks like i'm taking like a high
school yearbook photo do you see it
you know when you're like looking up
into the nothingness whoever thought of
that pose because it's horrible
and i've never seen anyone look good in
it okay one more deep breath
[Music]
exhale bring your left knee in
your right ankles cross over that left
knee how close can you sit your hips
towards your
left heel and let's get some ankle
circles
oh good no loud cracks on this side i
like it
okay if it happens naturally there's no
big issue
it doesn't hurt i'm talking about when
your body snap crackles and pops
just lets out that tension naturally
it's all good switch directions
trying to stay tall this is my tighter
side i'm very aware of that
so i'm just putting a little bit more
breath work in there
and for the next exercise we're going to
do
a full front body stretch that i'm
hoping will open up your hips a little
bit and your qua
set your quads i know tara's gonna show
another
um form of the exercise by just standing
up and getting a quad stretch
um if you're wondering how i just laid
on my back
i mean on my stomach and did it so
perfectly you can re-watch the video i
know
it was it was worth watching again so
left hand grabs your left ankle right
hand
grabs your right ankle and we're going
to go up just piece by piece
so first i like to think of it as
flexing my back
to lift my upper body so i'm flexing my
upper back to lift my chest
i squeeze my butt and flex my hamstrings
to lift my knees
and then i go section by section again a
little bit more
on the chest coming up a little bit more
on my thighs coming up
chest up more thighs up more chest up
more
thighs up more and let's see
if we can get ourselves a nice 10 second
hold
when we get to our highest spot so come
up high high high
and then hold here for ten nine
eight you got any higher seven six come
on
five four three
two and ease down
go back to a child's pose you'll have a
little moment here
just one or two breaths
knees to the side of the body push up on
your feet let yourself
hang once again
relax that head slight bend in the knees
stacking that spine one vertebrae at a
time
leave that head and the neck for last
hands clasp together bend the knees
squeeze the butt reach back
exhale forward round it
and a nice round of applause for
yourself
great job
yeah does anybody um have a wheelchair
[Music]
