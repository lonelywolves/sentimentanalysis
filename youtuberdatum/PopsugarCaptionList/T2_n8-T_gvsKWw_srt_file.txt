um if you can see me if we've got it all
going on
welcome we're back together again the
joy thank you for
giving me a couple of minutes the joy of
live stream is that we all get
to be together in real time and the joy
of life and stream is
every now and then technology makes us
wait a couple minutes so thank you for
waiting
we're all here um i see i was reading
your comments while we were waiting for
wi-fi to come back
so i've got italy i know i was dming
with paris
um today uh also with italy i so you are
if you're in the house hello welcome i
saw edinboro and taiwan
so we're morning night afternoon working
out together
today we're going to do a 30 minute full
body workout
um again with me what i love to do my
philosophy is to
if you're going to commit to doing a
workout i want it to be comprehensive so
you're going to sculpt
lean muscle mass right that's going to
give you bone density
power a metabolic lift we're also going
to have sweat sessions
so this will all be done in a fluid
interval that'll feel hopefully kind of
like a dance together
and then there will be stretch as well
because those are the three components
of physical wellness
that really should live in anything
anything we do and any workout that we
do so that's what we're gonna do
it'll be bar inspired so if you haven't
worked out with me before
i work out barefoot i believe very much
in the power of the foot
that being said if shoes are better for
you to work out in because we will be
doing a lot of standing
work and some impact options as well so
if shoes are better for you please wear
shoes
i chose once again to do absolutely no
equipment
i do that because you can then do this
anytime anywhere there's nothing that
stands in your way
again that being said i will have a
section it's going to be just a three
minutes long
where you will have an opportunity to
use weights if you have them so if you
do have have them close by i'm not going
to use them just so you can see that it
can be done
without waste that's kind of a like a
dancer philosophy as well the con the
connection to the muscle right the
holding your bones up against gravity
creating that beautiful power that body
weight experience
so if you do have weights that are like
between two to five pounds feel free to
take them now
and we will be able to use them so uh
yes i am started we are here oh good i
see that you see me we're all good
beautiful and uk and england i love it
think you've got new york
hello minnesota tyler i could just keep
looking you guys this makes my
heart so happy that we're all we're all
together no matter
what our circumstances are right now
with what's going on in the world we can
be together here so
i'm going to get us started
start with a shake off shake off in your
hands and your feet
shake off in your shoulders and your jaw
so when we start from a place of tension
sometimes habitual patterns that don't
necessarily serve us or whatever
so here we want to make sure that we
start from a place of release and joy
take a big breath in and this can be
done with less bounce if that's better
for you so we can just sort of be like a
little hip hop
or if impact's good really feel yourself
vibrating from the floor up two more big
breaths
and back down one more one globe of
breath
back down now turn your feet parallel
which means like the number 11.
and this is a beautiful way every time
anytime you just need to get a little
warmth
or you feel a little stagnant this
vibration
this run it warms up your shoulders with
the way you're moving your arms
warms up your abs with that pivot and
lengthens your sacral spine for eight
two three and if you feel a little tight
in your jaw or neck
feel free to let it go vocally inhale up
exhale down now from there chin to your
chest
lift throat open look right
and look left we want to get your
cervical spine warm
one big circle nice and slow these
circles
kind of takes willpower to keep them
slow circle the other way
so you're also creating the type of
massage in the glands that regulate
hormones that live in your throat
now right arm forward four you can keep
your elbow bent
circle back forward so your shoulder
that beautiful mobile joint
that's how we hug it's how we lift
and arm goes back for four now opening
your chest and igniting your back arms
out
cross out cross you can add a little hip
eight counts
one two three four
really feeling that you're starting to
get more range of motion let your arms
just dangle circle your hips around
keep your ribs still so you're working
from the muscles
in your abdomen circle the other way so
your pelvis is supposed to be able to
make these spirals
so you really want to lean into that
take your little right foot and do a
little circle through your ankle
can you feel the tops of your feet even
in shoes
all those bones there other way so we've
circled twice one direction change
direction
remember that this workout will be safe
so we can come back together and do it
anytime
inhale your arms up drop your shoulders
hold to your right wrist
tuck under you need to open the side of
your body where your side ribs live
and then other side up and over keep
your back leg squeezed
tight together and that's going to give
the pelvis support
bring both arms back i'm just going to
show you from the side so the front of
your chest
especially today nowaday is really
closed
so this opener can sometimes feel a
little vulnerable
here's some more support also choice to
keep your chin tucked
think of the center of your chest as
beaming up brace with breath so that
your ribs
are expanded take another inhale your
throat is allowed to open
you also have the option to add your
arms and as you exhale
pull your belly button back round
forward step your feet a little wider
and shake and nod your head
getting to know your beautiful body
think about lifting from the end of your
tail up
and then press your tailbone back and
lift your chest
up just making shapes option if you need
to bring your hands higher
to your shins and press or to the floor
your priority is straight knees
take one more big breath opening up the
back of your thighs with that warm
inhale
exhale bow your head so i use light
therapy as well
bend your knees this violet light is
affecting you
inhale your arms up big breath exhale
down
so violet is a mixture of red and blue
it's the center line of the color
spectrum so it
means brings heat into where it meets
the cool it's a balance
right now we're looking to warm up into
the heat you have the option to add a
jump
that's that sweat portion that i was
talking about you want to get your blood
moving through your body your blood is
how we heal
how we stay energized two more
one more the jumps are always optional
then from there bring your arms out to a
second position
touch your heel so first position just
looks like a v
cord a bra feel that strength and
elegance in your arms
come to your right toenails right and
left
and you may be mirroring this or it may
be sort of projecting on a device
so just make sure you're leading with
the right side pour the bra down again
re-tuck under bring your right leg out
touch your heels for eight
two your goal is to keep your knees real
straight four five your heart high
so you're channeling your inner denser
here portobra to reset
activating the mobility in your
shoulders eight hondues
just means pointing and then flexing
your foot
two more as you feel your inner thighs
warm up plie

heels slowly descend
let your arms open feel that we're
stretching and we can almost like
touch fingers with each other around the
world pull back

heels
up up exhale as you lift
now if you have sensitive shoulders and
arms overhead is too much
bring your hands down to prayer eight
more lifts four
warming up your feet warming up your
calves and your knees hold for eight
two really concentrate on pushing your
toes down
lifting your seat up now step wide let's

knee pulls one of four
down can you surrender to the drop

and up punch punch up
you can add a little jump four more one
so that crisscross of the arms is
working your abdomen

your back

[Music]
one more round of this drop three rounds
this can be your best one option
kickbacks
four times start right pull can you
playfully try to touch your heel to your
seat
and pull your whole leg behind your hip
drop low cross
up four more
one every exhale
happens with a motion and then jack
eight
or your choice eight you're at five
other side up cross cross
option remember you can add that extra
pull four more one
two don't let your heart drop put your
crown on your head
and keep it there this whole 30 minutes
ouch
punch out punch one more each side
then jacks last sixteen
three allow your body to be in this
fluid leak
a bit more ease jumping jacks also
dynamically stretch you
four five six
land low tick toes again
and then bend at your hips open your
chest
bring your hands forward and encounter
balance
pull your hips back bounce
bounce hold so now we're igniting
that metabolic sort of lifting muscle
group in your lower body
the fat burning group of your quads down
the detoxifying exhale option add a row
and take the bounce out
now you're gonna have an option only to
do jumps
sixteen jumps one just an option
three four you're jumping
take a point in your feet as you lift
one
two use your arms to propel that upward
motion
five six seven
hold right leg back right arm up
other arm out square your hips
plie down so start
by finding your dance then from there
you can start to playfully add on step
to the side
and just like we did in that cardio
dance series
the more you go down and up without
dropping your chest
without dropping your crown the more
your legs both elongate
and sculpt this arm motion
is honoring your heart option pull your
knee up
up cause you bring your knee up can you
feel
that stretch on your opposite hip
down or at a jump again
please hear this you are in your own
space this is your body and you're
having a conversation with
it so you want to make sure that if you
can jump you do
if it's not right for you you don't four
more one
we're two that's three
now just stay low hold bring your arms
up or always
shoulder option circle your hips
circle around those spirals
getting all the smaller muscles of your
abs standing ab work
bring your elbows back tuck your hips
forward
so the top kick going i'm gonna show you
from the side the top
is a rotation of the low spine eight
more
chip three four five
six seven bring your arms back up pulse
pulse hold on four and
hold think of squeezing this back cheek
chill
i'm really keeping these two bony line
marks with your hips and shoulders
forward one more like that
down down hold
now from here keep your stomach in
lower down this weight is powerfully in
your front leg
knee up so notice the stillness now
the elegant stillness or arm out to the
side for more balance or
down for shoulder sensitivity 16 more
three
four if you feel it in your standing
knee at all turn your standing toe a
little more forward
last eight here one two three
then more deeply five six seven
from there close through first step your
feet out take your weights now if you
have them
bring your arms out pull your elbows
back
back so now we've readjusted to parallel
and the sequencing is on purpose what
we're doing is we're creating
more balanced subconscious motions so
that your legs don't always stay in
perpetual
forward or perpetual turned out they
learn
those positions are supported in
different ways
hold bring your arms up just to about
halfway between your ribs and hips
right arm up then out up this other hand
is still
so this is where if you have weights
from one to five pounds
feel free to use them four more or do
this with me without weights
two we're at three
now just press straight up add a hip hop
two of eight three make it bigger if it
feels good five
six seven other arm up first
then out here's the practice as your arm
reaches up your shoulder stays down
so it can be habit for muscles to pump
and work together when they don't need
to
for more meaning your neck doesn't need
to work to lift your arm
your shoulder doesn't it's still this is
your bicep
you're a deltoid press up eight and your
pop
you're at five add your spirit seven
both arms press out now turn your hands
forward to me
and again really follow through on this
extension
eight more what i mean by follow through
is that your arms don't go from bent to
soft they go from bent
to straight to straight add a pullback
eight more one
two three all of these chest muscles
lengthening we need it now more than
ever hold there
palms back pinkies up lift exhale
breathe out as this happens from your
low stomach
eight more here one keep your ribs still
knit your rib cage closed so that
there's more resistance
circle forward for four two three
speed it up eight counts one two three
four
five six circle back for four two
three speed it up eight one two three
four five six reach to the right for
eight
two three really stretching yourself
a dancer recognizes that long muscles
can be leaner
than short muscles stronger four of
eight
five six seven from there
bend your elbows pull your waist in pull
in
and out in and out
four more like that one
you want to show the shoulder all of its
beautiful ranges of motion remind it
of all its mobility pause bring your
arms down bring your heels together

that curtsy lunge series on the other
side
six seven option rela eight more one
two three four five
six seven lower your heels other leg
back take a moment
reclaim that elegance then drop and lift
good remember two you got a rewind
button and a pause button
so if you need to you change for a
moment
pause for a moment find your center
or rewind and figure out how this is
living in your body today
and then come back to it option pull
your knee up
and this workout you could do every day
it's balanced
so it's not over burdening one
particular muscle group
and down up it's sustainable
and effective four more we're at one
let your arms help lift you like they
did on those first parallel jumps
now land hold bring your arms up circle
two a four
your glute muscles your seat muscles
squeeze
bring your elbows down and tuck tuck
so you're elongating this muscle the
middle of the thigh is getting strong
and lean
and your hip is opening if you have a
tight back this will help
and then from there just hold lengthen
long and drop deeper
pull up up up or arm to the side
or arm to your waist what i encourage
you to do
is get a lot deeper in your standing

now gently pull your arms back as well
pull your elbows back as well so your
arms for eight more
are helping to open the tightness of
your inner hips
as your gluteus medius contract down
down hold option bring your hands to
your low back
and this is going to create that space
that we're really focusing on today
making it in the front of your chest so
your heart
has face to beat you feel your lungs
have space to breathe and energize your
chest
is open not tight two more
and hold one more we're gonna look for a
burn here together
stay low don't go back up push your
pinky toe down

your body because
of the series we did before so we get to
go deeper

so we've done if we take those four
moments to go to your deepest
grand play then press up last four sets
of eight
this is where you bring the heat keep

bring your feet a little wider than your
hips
option to come to your knees uncrossed
feet that's important
then re-tuck your tail option slow bend

sculpting
your inner legs and your waistline
one more
now from there bring your legs tight
together step your right foot up

knee that's the super important part
press your other leg back
change sides so you first now you're
okay that's where i'm going
if it's that slow perfect or can you
speed it up on the beat
so you do one leg and then the other
take a big step

your arm tissue is such an effective way

last sixteen one three
five six last eight one two three
four five six seven drop
pull back take a breath in the back of
your lungs
breathe in the round come up
bring your hands back behind you open
your chest
and think about these little fibrous
muscles
that connect your pectorals to your arms
and shoulders
take a breath there violet breaths are
strong
but they're soft they're mobile they're
red
they're blue they're violet
bring your hands together and circle we
come together
to make ultraviolet not separate
together then from here
come to your right foot your other knee
can either be on the earth now here's
something i'd love you to check out
don't rest on the bone of your kneecap
instead
walk forward so once more your knee is a
little beyond your
ankle but not your toes that's the front
position this is activated muscularly
and then you're on the base of your quad
muscle
not your kneecap pull your back toe
under
then from here lift your chest stay with
us through this
this is the completion of the circle
raise your arms
up and then pull your elbows down we get
stronger through stretching because
in these moments we unleash pathways for
blood and oxygen
to flow to the cells that create muscle
fibers
we don't want to shut those pathways off
breathe in
the oxygen is part of the energy bring
your hands down
bring your arm up circle other way
switch your heel back switch your arm up
and open to the sky
lower down lower your back knee in that
same way
shift back bring your hand to your thigh
here's another option
you know the stable surface you may have
used for your planks
you can bring your hands up to it so
imagine i had a ballet bar type thing
that can be the back of a couch or a
counter it can be a chair perhaps a
bench
and that can guide you through the
progression of your discovery
of your flexibility if it's right for
you and this feels like ease
and craving you can go deeper flex your
front foot more
that will protect your knee point your
front foot about your head
feel the back of your knee open up from
whatever position you in you're in
you're exactly where you want to be
you're exactly where you need to be
glide your leg back bring it around
behind you
press to a downward facing dog inhale
your right leg up
exhale through to your outer elbow
rotate from your hip to pigeon flex your
foot
lift your chest lead from your open
heart down
take another breath push the toenails of
your back left foot into the floor
to activate your breath to activate your
stretch
inhale into anywhere that feels tight in
your hip exhale step back
come to both knees round up other side
same consciousness on the kneecap or
elevate press out through your back heel
bend your front knee to activate this
muscle group inhale your arms up pull
your elbows back
open your chest is there someone you
love out there in the world
take a big breath exhale your heart
towards them
connect reach your hands down
arm up circle one way and the other way
is there something you're reaching for
stretch up
it's right there you got it
come on down stretch back flex your foot
make your choice
option full expression
and then descend and instead of fighting
for the stretch soften for the stretch
surrender to the strength glide your leg
back
go to downward facing dog press your
hips up
and your chest between your biceps so
it's stretching your shoulders
and then we'll stretch in your hip
rotate
press your right toe nails down option
descend
give your head a place to rest think of
how much work your beautiful
neck does holding your head up all day
let it have a moment of reprise
take a breath to any space that you feel
is still resistant
and then from there glide back come on
to your knees and
cross your legs take another big breath
in
stretch your fingers wide exhale your
right ear to your right shoulder
and then from there you can bring your
arm up and walk the other hand away
gently
not tugging exploring
drop your chin a little bit more
exhale back other side
[Music]
walk away take a breath into all of
those fibers that come from your jaw
in that space and release inhale both
arms up to the sky
and bring your hands down to prayer
bring your prayer and rest it on your
heart
and right now we're in fall and fall is
about
leaves falling from trees and returning
to the earth
it's about a cycle or reset and so in
the now
is there something a burden a habit of
fear
that you could let literally fall off
your shoulders
as you inhale see it
as you exhale let it float to the ground
as you inhale open your arms feel the
space that you've created
exhale bring your hands to the earth
if you stumble if you fall if you make a
mistake it's okay
she'll catch you open your eyes to the
sun
