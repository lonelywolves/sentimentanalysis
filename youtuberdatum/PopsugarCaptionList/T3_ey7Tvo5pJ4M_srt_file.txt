today is about empowering you with
functional strength in your entire body
grab a pair of light and medium free
weights and let's get strong
all right we're gonna start with some
standing knee hugs so i want you to pull
that knee
up towards the chest you guys are in
luck today you are joined by avia over
here
who's going to show you some of the
modifications and we got brittany
on the other side of me who's going to
be showing more advanced moves
because she is strong and we are going
to work our strength today
all right so first here you're giving
your leg a little stretch you guys feel
that through your
glute a little bit use your arms here so
you're not
laying on the floor but you're standing
and still using your arms using your
core
pulling that knee up to your chest
however high it goes right now
that's going to increase over time now
we're going to take this into a little
skip
so right now you might just stay on the
ball of your foot here
driving your knee up to your chest use
your arms and pump those arms and get
real
serious about this strength you're about
to get get on right so
then you start bouncing off the ball of
your foot like brittany is
kind of advance the skip all right you
can start driving that knee up
but you guys got to get that blood
flowing right now because we're going to
be doing some circuits that challenge
your muscles
and get you working but there's lots of
different levels so don't feel
overwhelmed
now this next one is going to be a quad
stretch so you might
grab that toe and hold on to something
and just hold it here
all right you can start to switch and
alternate sides
if you feel good with your balance which
i'm challenged all the time
right so you can either hold the stretch
and then
switch i would switch right now if you
haven't yet
but you're going back and forth if you
have the balance to really pull that
front leg get the front of the body
stretched out
because then we're going to go into a
little butt kicker so i want you on the
ball of the foot here
and i want you pumping those arms again
and this is the way you're modifying
or you're running it out like brittany i
could already hear the pin or pattern of
her feet
right and so this is a more advanced
version where now i gotta kind of pull
my core in
even tighter to keep my balance and keep
my energy high
and get my breath going right good
but you're looking good over there love
you
that's it keep going three two one
and relax good now wide stance i want
you to go real wide with your legs
like you're already getting a stretch
through your groin i want you to sit
back
bending into your left or right knee
doesn't matter which side with the
opposite
is straight and then come up tall so sit
back
bend into that knee and come up tall now
you want to keep that knee and toe
straight towards me
and you're just sitting back you're
sitting that booty back getting that
stretch if your legs go too wide bring
them in
because sometimes you can feel that good
now you want to advance this one
you can immediately start to push off
that leg
and come together yes and then step out
sit
in and come together so this requires
more balance
more coordination more strength but you
work your way up to this by gaining the
flexibility
and the strength in the hips nice job
ladies you're looking good ah
love it oh yeah looking good avia whew
nice there that's it last one and relax
all right i'm out of breath already
now we're gonna go up over the head i
want you to clasp the hands together
and hug your ears yes hug your ears so
you feel your head between your biceps
now i want you to stretch side to side
so you're feeling a big stretch through
your side
but you're not going too far because you
really can't all right your arms are
limiting you by that
mobility so you're here you're
stretching
up and over the body feeling a nice
extension
can really get this extension through
the side of the body
i want you to feel those arms extend
reaching up towards the sky
good last one
and down now big shoulder circles all
right and i want you to march
so drive the knee up towards the chest
get your arms circulating
and my arms are already burning you feel
your arms burning already
so if your arms are burning it's totally
normal i am like
on fire right now let's go the other
direction so big forward circles
pull your belly in tight bring your knee
up as high as you can
all right if your knee is just marching
low that's awesome but by the end
you're going to be pulling that knee up
to your chest and really getting your
abs to fire during this one
so this is a core and shoulder warm-up
okay my friends
all right you're doing great keep
working breathe it out
ladies how you doing i know i know
i'm feeling it good three two
and one all right you guys should be
warmed up and ready to go brady you feel
good
yes probably feel good now grab your
light free weights or no weights for
those of you who are modified
all right so we're gonna start in a nice
little
squat and we're going to go up into an
overhead
jack if you've got the weights oh you're
going to feel it
and you're just stepping side to side
you can advance this move by adding the
jump show them what's up brittany
show them that little hop good so you're
either here
side to side or you're jumping and that
little bit of
plyo all right but you can see obvi is
still working her shoulders
she's still working her legs she's
getting nice and low
right keeping her chest high feeling
good
breathe it out you guys are awesome
looking great
awesome job oh my gosh this gets the
heart spiking
right so go without weights in the
beginning if you feel like you need to
modify this one a little bit or you
don't need to go as low
you can do a modified squat three
two one nice work now keep your light
free weights if you can
otherwise try this one without weights
to start we're gonna go into a split
lunge
where we got our feet wide we're gonna
drop down you don't have to go super low
arms up at 90 degrees and i want to go
in a scarecrow
so palms down palms up
this works the rotator cuff so you're
gaining all that strength through your
shoulders
right and your rotator cuff muscles yeah
and your legs
right yes so you're dropping into that
lunge you can feel it
you don't have to go super low like
watch abia she's got a nice little high
lunge going
and she's still working that leg let's
switch sides other way
back drop it in and rotate
so this one here working a lot of muscle
groups the lower you go in that lunge
the harder it's going to be
right and those arms and elbows stay
high at 90 degrees
i know it's hard a lot of times you want
to drop the elbows you're like oh god
i can't i can't which is totally fine go
with no weight to start
and work on your range of motion all
right come on up
now grab your medium size free weights
okay
and we're gonna go into single leg and
curl and press
so you're on one leg you gently touch
one foot
and you're gonna curl hammer curl hammer
press
so your palms face in alright your palms
are facing your body
your palms are facing your chest your
head
in your knuckles out if you want to
advance
you can test your balance you can pick
that knee up
pull the belly button in squeeze the
core
right so this is testing those
lower leg muscles the ab muscles
arms and shoulders everything is engaged
you guys are looking good ladies how you
feeling feeling it i can't look away
i cannot look away because i will lose
my mouth
let's switch sides so see how the
balance is first start by lightly
touching
right so lightly touch the floor gain
that balance you're not putting any
weight on that foot
it's just there for some balance okay
then if you're feeling good
you can start to raise that foot off the
ground
then when you're feeling really good
you're picking that knee up
so that it's almost touching your chest
because your abs are gonna work harder
to get that knee high so you have
multiple levels to work to here
and if you lose balance guess what
that's okay you just touch the floor
regain it and keep going you're doing
great
three two good
and one amazing okay let's set those
weights down
we're gonna go into that next round of
squat jacks so
i don't know about you but my heart is
racing so you don't need weights for
this one if you're just starting out
all right you're going to go down into
that squat you're either hopping like
britney
or you're stepping like abya this is
good back and forth
if you've got that explosiveness but
remember as your legs get tired too
i don't want to see you start hunching i
don't want you to be like oh my gosh
i can't do it with the jump that's when
i want you to drop your weights
and start squatting okay it's more
important
to do it right than to do it wrong and
you want to be healthy and strong from
this
not injured and like cramping all over
the place
come on you got it come on you got it
three
two away and
one i love it now keep those weights in
hand we're gonna go into that split
lunge
with that scarecrow so nice wide stance
bring the arms up at 90.
drop it into that lunge and let's rotate
you also can modify by coming up a
little bit
breathe it out you're looking good
awesome job
you guys feel this through your
shoulders as well like in my butt here
is like
on fire so you guys have to really
decide
how hard you can push today if it's not
that hard
do the modified version let's switch
sides
other way and bring it up
but it's these moves that are going to
make you functionally strong
right so it's like you might be running
around in the yard and then
picking some kid off the playground or
off the swing and you have to have
strength
in lots of different muscles of your
body that you don't normally just
isolate
right they all work together
breathe it out last couple seconds two
yeah
grab your heavier weights so the
medium-sized free weights are something
that
you can press overhead safely
that's why i want you to make sure you
don't go too heavy
now let's go with a curl and press
right so you can go anywhere from three
to tens
depending on your fitness level and your
strength and how long you've been doing
these kinds of moves
right so it's all about pacing yourself
and building up the intensity and
working on your balance
and your strength whoo did you see me do
a one-handed press
i was like let's switch sides good you
guys are looking
awesome curl and press come on drive
that knee up
you can do it if you lose your balance
just gently touch the floor
but don't put weight on that other foot
really try to isolate your leg
really try to balance on one side you're
going to feel
so much stronger later on after this
workout where
you might trip and catch yourself
because you just trained
yourself to be more balanced and
coordinated
breathe it out that's the way last two
good i'm sweating buckets one
good job you guys all right grab your
light weights
all right we're gonna pick those up for
our squat jack last round
you guys got this all right so legs wide
you're going to squat it down
and jack it up now there's so many
varieties to this
move you know you can start by just
doing the squat
then you can finish with your hands up
overhead
but you have so much to look at here and
follow
like you can go as low as brittany and
basically touch your butt to the floor
and that's a great advance file move all
right you might be here with me
or you're following abya and she's got
their nice modification
for you guys to follow along you're
doing amazing
best thing is you're here you showed up
you press play you're getting strong so
proud of you
that's it last two
last one and relax all right split lunge
you're ready let's burn those shoulders
out make those legs work
drop it down as low as you can and let's
go let's rotate
elbows up high palms and then
knots palm knuckling
that's it elbows stay up i know it's not
easy
go without weights if you got to drop
them so even right now you might be like
okay
i'm done i'm done just go with no weight
right
and that's okay too switch sides other
leg
so remember form over
i guess the ego all right it's not about
the ego in here we're about getting
strong
any way we can start to finish you can
do it
you got it in you wherever you got to
start
you're always going to finish stronger
that's it almost there
ah i'm like okay can i drop my waist up
can i drop them you're doing great three
two legs are on fire and one grab
your medium size weights for those curls
breathing it out that's it it's high
tempo you know
but you guys are fantastic all right
here we go knee up
get it up there you can do it
breathe it out remember exhaling the
most on your
real exertion so it's usually a sh
and then you're breathing you're
breathing i'm like big exhale
big exhale down down right
but whatever breathing pattern feels
right for you because i know like
sometimes
in yoga i'm like i can't breathe that
slow i can't breathe that slow
and so breathe at your own tempo but
remember that when you exert
energy switch sides when you exert
energy
that's when you want to let the air out
that's right good pull those abs in
tighten those ass pull that belly button
towards the spine because when you do
that
you are isometrically working your core
just standing in line
and that's what you want to start
thinking about how can i get stronger
each and every second of the day
and relax you guys are amazing all right
grab a sip of water
you need it you deserve it our second
circuit
is another three moves that is going to
build that functional strength of your
body
we're going to come down to the floor
[Music]
and when we do i want you to get into a
modified plank
position so you're on your hands
and you're on your knees in a straight
plank position
all right plank it out you guys got it
let's plank it out all right so walk
your legs
hands forward a little bit abby i want
those abs working there they are
those abs are working now we're gonna
drop to the floor
all one unit drop pull the hands off the
floor pinch the shoulder blades
and then press your body up okay repeat
it
so here you have to think pinch squeeze
the back of the
muscles in your back and then press
and you want to make sure that when you
come off that floor
you exhale and you pull your belly off
that floor
exactly when your chest leaves the floor
i'm trying to help you gain that
strength in your core
and in your tummy and in your chest and
shoulders at the same time
all right but i don't want you to be the
worm i don't want you to be here
pinching
and then rolling doing a body roll back
to really try
to think about your body coming up
together and that is hard to do
but that's your goal that's your goal
pinch
press and relax whoa
awesome job now we're going to come into
a light chest fly in tricep extension
so grab your light weights to start okay
everybody's got a nice light pair of
weights on their
hands and we're gonna roll on to the
back
i want you to bring your knees bent with
your feet flat on the floor to start
low back presses into the floor you're
gonna slightly bend those elbows to keep
the elbows and shoulders safe
so you're gonna bring your arms open
like you're giving this guy a big bear
hug
you're gonna kiss the floor with your
elbows and then bring it back together
right so you're getting a big stretch
through the chest and shoulders
but you're not keeping those arms locked
you're giving them a nice bend in the
elbows
so you feel the stretch and you're nice
and safe now you can pick your knees up
at 90.
if you want to make this a little harder
but if your low back just went like this
off the floor i don't want your knees up
so you've got to keep
your low back pressed to the floor to
keep the abs engaged in your back safe
now keep your arms straight up towards
the sky you're going to do a tricep
extension
bending the elbows bringing the weights
towards the ears and then extend
straight up towards the sky you're
really squeezing those triceps when you
extend those arms okay
so really think about squeezing those
triceps bend those elbows
and extend those arms good bend
and extend awesome job abs are working
arms are working you guys are doing
great keep going feel it in my core yes
me too
i love it you really can you guys
whatever you're focusing on
is really gonna feel the work a couple
more seconds you're doing great
keep breathing
[Music]
last one extend and relax
all right you guys come on up keep your
weights in hand
and we're going to come up through a
sumo squat
and side bend oh baby if you're
modifying keep the weights out of the
hand for this one
going to go into a nice wide squat
position
arms are going to be up at 90 degrees
drop down into your squat
you're going to add a little side bend
to work your obliques
and work your back so here you're
working a lot of muscle groups the lower
you can go
the harder it is on your legs all right
but i want you to keep an upright
posture
a lot of people tend to lean forward
here if it's too heavy or if they don't
have the flexibility in their hips
but you can notice us all open chest is
wide
and you're doing a nice little side bend
back and forth you guys feel that
i feel it it's like the legs
hello love handles i feel you and this
was one of my favorite ones when i was
pregnant and even after the baby
because i'm standing engaging and
working so many muscles go ahead and
relax
you feel me okay let's come back down to
the floor
we're going back to those push-ups we're
working it
you can hear me breathing heavy because
these are all those moves that are so
important
for your body you guys all right these
are so functional
let's go belly's in tight from the knees
bend the knees
and drop down pinch the chest
pinch the back and press up
down shoulder blades
come together and press
really try to come off the floor is one
unit
pinch press
how many push-ups do you think you guys
can get
i mean it depends on how slow you're
going and i truly want you to go slow
so for me i don't think it's about
numbers but i feel like you will
pick up the pace the stronger you get
stress especially in the upstate huh you
can always go to the toes
and this is really hard pinch and press
but see i can only probably get a few of
those so i might go
down pinch and then go for my knees
and press i might come up here and down
all the way pinch from the knees in my
press
so lots of variation okay come on up all
right we're going to grab
those light or medium-sized freeways
whatever you feel like you want to grab
right now
all right keep it consistent or give
yourself that challenge
so we're going to drop on the back all
right press the low back into the floor
abs are tight
pick your knees up at 90 if you want the
challenge for the core open
all the way kiss the floor with those
elbows
and bring it together bending the elbows
gently
and then bringing it together you're
looking good
awesome feel that nice stretch through
the chest
all right going to feel it a little bit
through your biceps as well but keep a
nice slight bend in the elbow so you
don't strain the elbows
you'll strain the shoulders or the pecs
you want to keep everything
nice and strong a couple more seconds
you're doing great
good one more and we're going to go into
those triceps good come on abs keep them
tight keep that back on the floor
keep pulling that back floor try some
extensions
bend those elbows extend up towards the
sky and squeeze
[Music]
i said even if your weights might be a
little too heavy for you you could
almost alternate
arms here because you know sometimes it
feels just a little bit easier to
alternate
and have both weights going at the same
time it's up to you
but if you've only got one set of
weights then you might do that
or if you've got one heavy weight and
you're just like i got only one heavy
weight
you could take that as well and do this
tricep extension
and relax drop the feet you're doing
great i'm so proud of you guys
keep those weights in hand come on up to
your feet
we're going into that sumo squat you
ready all right
so hands up at 90. go into that wide
plie squat
get as low as you can go and let's go
side to side
keep that chest open
that's the way i like how you can do
this one when you're going for a little
walk and you're
kind of taking a little break in a stop
light everybody in their cars will look
at you and say what is that person doing
and i like getting those looks because i
know that then they're thinking about me
all day long thinking oh man
i should have been working out today or
oh man i want to be able to do that move
you know
it's all right make somebody's day i
them ask themselves
what am i doing am i strong like that
inspire someone else good back and forth
oh and relax last round you guys
feeling it i'm like oh my god good job
all right let's come on down you guys
last round
this is it you got to give it your
everything okay you got to empty out the
tanks for me right now
we're going down into that push-up let's
do this go
pinch and press i'm going to go a couple
all the way
down pinch and press
down pinch and press
when you're just getting started this
can feel so intimidating
but you start right here ear down
and you're pressing and you're gaining
all that strength
each and every time good
pinch and press amazing you guys
awesome job now i want you to grab your
light or medium-sized free weights
whichever ones that you feel most
comfortable
with okay and you're going to come on
down
all right lower yourself all the way
down to your back remember knees can be
up at 90 degrees or on the floor
press your back to the floor you're
going to open up those arms just kiss
those elbows to the floor
and then pull them together good so if
you felt like you could go up and wait a
little bit great
if you didn't want to go with weight the
first time that's fine getting the
mobility down is okay too
right so you're just opening closing
giving yourself
a nice stretch through the chest biceps
beautiful i know right like oh my gosh i
feel it more and more
good and now let's go to triceps so
you're keeping those elbows up towards
the sky
bring those weights towards the ears and
extend it straight up
good yeah you guys the third round is
always the hardest right
so maybe you didn't want to go up in
weight maybe you wanted to go down in
weight
and that's okay too breathe it out
exhale nice job good
[Music]
you know what they say you guys you're
never going to be great your first time
so if this is your first workout then
nobody's great their first time
but you gotta start to be great and
that's why i'm so proud of you for being
here
and kick starting your journey with me
and us
bend it down extend and relax
good all right now coming back up onto
your feet
grab the lighter weights or drop them if
you're modifying
and i want you to come up into that sumo
squat i want you to get as low as you
can this time
keep that open chest drop those hips
open it up
side to side get a nice bend here
try to get down to the elbows to the
knees and the thighs if you can
i know it's hard to go low try to give
yourself a little extra challenge here
and finish off strong
keep your chest open breathe it out
my legs are shaking i'm like oh my gosh
they're they're feeling it
good last couple
breathe awesome and
relax you guys set those weights down
give your friends a high five yeah
they're in the room
yes all right awesome job you guys are
amazing now we're gonna cool down here
and what i want to do is take some time
to open up the hips and the quads
because we work them a lot so we're
going to start let's start on our feet
let's start with a little quad stretch
here
and let's pull the foot up to the butt
think about holding on to something if
you need it for balance
your your couch or a friend if you guys
are both unstable then maybe a couch or
a wall
that would be probably better but here
you're thinking about pulling your heel
up to your butt as close as you can and
squeezing your glute
on that side so it's really going to
open up the front side of the body and
pull that belly in nice and tight
go ahead and switch other side so you're
giving yourself that hold of like 30
to 60 seconds because guess what if you
do a workout
tomorrow which i hope you're going to
show up for
you're going to want these muscles to
have that time to elongate and get fresh
blood flow through them
that's what the stretch and the
cooldowns for it's for you to feel fresh
tomorrow
so stick with it you're doing awesome
let the heart rate come down and relax
now come on down to the floor
we're going to go into a kneeling hip
flexor stretch
with a reach over the top of the body so
have one foot forward if you need to put
a towel
under your knee you can do that and i
want you to kind of sit hip forward
letting your hips sink forward but your
belly to stay in tight so that you're
not arching this isn't the move right
here
but it's here and you got your belly in
strong you're gonna reach up over top
so you're stretching out the whole side
of your body right there
beautiful breathe it out
nice job
is one of my favorite ones it feels nice
after all that hard work
go ahead and switch other side bring it
up
thinking forward remember hips sink
forward but your chest stays up and your
belly stays in tight now reach up
good if you can sink forward even more
that's great but don't let it compromise
your low back
i see a lot of people doing this and
it's like that's going to kill you
tomorrow so think about more of the
stretch happening here
right through the front hips and you're
reaching letting that whole body
open up good job nice work
all right good now coming up to the feet
again we're going to go with a tricep
stretch so i want you to
reach behind your back here reach in
between your shoulder blades
and then pull that elbow up towards the
sky so you're getting a nice stretch
through
your tricep and then if you give it a
little side bend
you can also get your lat a little bit a
little bit of oblique that's why this
kind of serves a lot of purposes
doesn't that feel good yeah oh this is
like my favorite
this is what i do in the morning every
morning
it gets the blood flowing to my brain
no we all need blood flow to the brain
especially in the morning
especially if you got kids right you
want to be kind to your family
stretch your arms because you'll all of
a sudden have blood flow
to the brain and you won't be snapping
at everybody as you fumble out of
the bedroom in the morning good now i
want you to grab your hands behind your
back
and you're going to pull your shoulder
blades back rolling back
pointing towards the floor all right so
you're thinking about getting a nice
shoulder stretch
here if you've got an advanced move here
like show them the advanced move
brittany yeah all right if you want to
bend forward and stretch
but if not if you don't have that
flexibility your arms aren't going to go
up that way
stay right here right you could also
bend the knees a little bit if you
wanted to
and open it up this way lots of
different ways to do this one or it's
just right here
and that's it you guys are amazing these
are my girls right here
working on the strength working on the
endurance working on the balance
you guys are amazing i'll see you next
workout
