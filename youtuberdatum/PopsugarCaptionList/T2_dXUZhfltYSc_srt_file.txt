good morning everyone
hi happy birthday you guys i'm katie of
love sweat fitness and i'm so excited to
be taking us through
a 30 minute full body sculpting workout
um this is going to be really fun if you
have
slider discs these are my new lsf dual
sided sliders
um if you have a set of these grab them
if you don't
grab a little towel or rag something
that you can slide on
and somehow you don't have a towel or
rag i will cue you throughout this
workout
how to do the different exercises that
we are using these for
without any equipment at all so my goal
is to always make
all of my workouts accessible for
absolutely anyone no matter
what type of equipment you have where
you are as long as you have a small
space your body can fit in
we these dual side ones are both for
hard and
soft surfaces so on a hardwood floor
they work great
and then if you have carpet the smooth
side on the opposite side works as well
so
really the best of both worlds um so
we're going to be using these today
again i'm going to give you guys a
second if you need to grab a towel
for the floor before your workout grab
it now get a different line
for your face you have to towel off at
any point um we're gonna do kind of
like a slower sculpting but this is
going to
burn every single inch and we're going
to have so much fun doing
it all right you guys ready we ready to
go for this again i'm katie of love

[Music]

all right let's go
[Applause]
three
[Applause]
i feel it i know you feel it
oh my goodness all right we're gonna
pull it down
if you haven't grabbed your lsf
sculpting sliders go get them
i'll link them here for you guys again
dual sided hard and soft surfaces
they up level so much i'm adding tons
and tons
of new workouts with these in the love
sweatpants app which has my personal
training program
at your own pace strength and
conditioning days
and a full on demand video library
i got my foam roller i'll do that at the
end i don't know
let's go ahead and stretch side lunge
all right we're going to be stretching
into those same areas we've worked so
hard over the last 30 minutes
stretch out
stretching and low rolling are probably
the most important part it's also
important
but one of the most important parts of
your workouts
because truly find that low lunge
without taking time to stretch while you
are warm
at the end of your workout it can lead
to injury
it can lead to immobility to pain muscle
soreness and tightness beyond
just the norm from your workout right so
adding in that time to stretch
especially adding the time to foam roll
is going to help improve your
flexibility your mobility
decrease muscle soreness and allow you
to get back at it the next day
plus what i love about foam rollers
especially like my left foot goodness
two in one is that hard outer surface
on the outer foam roller has all the
little knobs for deep tissue massage but
not only
is it like an amazing myofascial
massage in there but it also
which legs can help reduce your
cellulite
and it just feels so good so you want to
stretch
right after your workouts 100 that's the
best kind of foam roll also
later at night just trying to do like a
little bit of a warm-up so i'll use
the softer inner core roller to help
warm my muscles up before i get into
that deep one
whatever you're doing the key is to take
care of your body listen to your body be
gentle that's why i try to cue
modifications
throughout the workouts yes they're
designed to
work you sculpt you strengthen you push
you
challenge you but only you know what
that looks like for you
on any given day and it changes and
that's okay
having some grace first help little
patients
realizing one day we might be able to
pick up the heaviest weights
and sculpt and like do these insane hip
workouts
and crush it and the next day that might
not be what our body needs or what it's
asking for
yourself a hug
so listening to your body doing what
feels best for you but just keep
moving whatever you're doing i had so
much fun
doing this whole thing slider workout
