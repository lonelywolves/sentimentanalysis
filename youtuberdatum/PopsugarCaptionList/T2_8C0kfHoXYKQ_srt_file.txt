everyone's always asking for that
flatter stomach but it's not about doing
more crunches
it's about developing a strong back side
so that you stand taller
and you reverse the natural effects of
sitting and hunching forward all the
time
these are the moves that are going to
help you stand tall and project that
confidence
let's get your sexy back alright my
friends let's get this started
we're getting a strong backside we've
got jenny over here showing some
advanced moves
and raven is going to show the modifieds
for you today if you need that
all right we're going to start with some
walking marches and we're going to pick
our knees up a little bit and shoulder
circle it out so we get
a little bit of a multi-purpose warm-up
today right
yeah we only got a little time together
so i want to make sure we maximize that
time
if you're just doing a short little kind
of shallow march that's okay
let's switch directions but really think
about opening up your shoulders
picking those knees up pulling those abs
in
so you're warming up that entire body
get the blood flowing my friends all
right
ah a nice deep breath in through the
nose out through the mouth
you want to get that nice little hit of
oxygen in your body before we start
right yes good now we're going to calm
it down we're going to reach towards the
toe with a straight leg toe touch
so heel towards the floor you're going
to bend one knee
lengthen the other and you're reaching
towards that toe
come back up and switch legs so it's a
nice long
leg as you reach and come up you want to
have a flat back for this
really flat back so that you stick your
booty back and you get a nice extension
through that calf
and hamstring that feels amazing does it
feel good yeah
[Music]
a little bit you can go opposite hand to
foot
that's gonna elongate that body a little
bit more
for me when i'm just getting warmed up
i'm like okay i'm gonna just try to get
to my toe
and then i'm going to add maybe that
extra little reach
across my body to start feeling even
more of a stretch and as you advance you
might get there
right but just warm up slow really feel
yourself
open up the back side of the body
because that's what we're working today
my friends all right beautiful okay now
go
wide stance here we're going to go into
a gate swing but just start here
with a nice big gait squat so you're
pushing those knees open
you're getting a nice squat to open up
the inner thighs
and get the quads and the you know all
the leg muscles the glutes warmed up
if you want to start adding a little hop
you can start adding that little hop
in and out okay you could also
step in and out if you wanted to right
so
raven might add that little step after
she feels a little warmed up
jenny she's getting a little explosive
now right she's
wrong she's got her legs warmed up
getting my heart rate up
that's it it does get that heart rate up
so either way
it's up to you go at your own tempo this
is just getting your body feeling warm
getting that circulation going beautiful
i know right yeah okay wait what
happened here
that's it last one and relax now start
from the side of your mat you only need
a little bit of distance here
about the length of your mat we're gonna
shuffle we're gonna take a little
shuffle with our knees slightly bent
i'm going to reach towards my knee or
the floor to start
so you're going towards knee or shin if
you want to get a little lower you can
start going
all the way down to the ground but i
want you to stay low on your shuffle
right as if you're like march madness
and i'm playing basketball
right going side to side you want to
feel the tension in your legs a little
bit
oh yeah starting to warm up those quads
yeah my thighs are feeling this
yes and your shins and your calves
everything is working to really get your
body awake
good back and forth good breathe it out
last couple nice and light on the feet
so your neighbors don't hear you right
you want to be like boom boom boom boom
try to stay light even if you're
stepping right you're light
back last one good
now let's work the core a little bit
come down to the floor and this is going
to be
a pike in place so start here first
in a modified plank position all right
so you're from your knees
but you're planking so that you feel
your abs engaged
right there now stay here if you're
modifying
or come to the toes bring yourself into
a full plank
and you're here you want to pull your
belly button in toward your spine and
lift your hips
just a little bit don't move your feet
then come back down to neutral right
if at any time you need to drop to the
knees do it
right so here i'm activating
my core and i'm just engaging my belly
really picking my hips up with the
strength of my abs
my shoulders are getting warm too right
yeah you feel it for sure
yep up and then slowly back down if at
any
time you need to just drop here do it
just hold that modified plank
three two and
one nice job you guys all right so you
feel warm
you're ready to work that back side
we're going to start in a similar
position with a plank press
so we're going to work the back of the
shoulders start again
right here in that modified position
plank position
and i just want you to drop your chest
towards the floor
and then press it away so through the
forearms and elbows
you're pressing into the ground and
pressing your chest up and away from the
floor
now go from the toes if you want to add
a little
challenge to this like jenny's going to
show you
she's going to go up and down and you're
going to
feel the fire in your shoulders
and in your back okay your abs are still
working because you're in that plank
so this is challenging even for my knees
totally you know i feel this a lot
if you wanted to eventually go all the
way to your hands
you could do that and then eventually do
that
from your toes okay so lots of variation
and relax
oh that one just gives my whole upper
body and back warmed up totally burns
so we're going to go on to our belly
into a swimmer so for this
i want you to think about looking
towards the floor but lifting
your chest i want you to lift your hands
they're down by your hips you're going
to raise one arm
up over the body and then back down
other arm goes up so you're cut you're
kind of trying to keep your chest off
the ground just ever so slightly your
feet are on the floor
and you're looking down towards the
floor really focusing on your back now
if you want to advance this
you can go two arms up and over
right and that is even harder because
you feel that there's just like twice as
much weight
that you have to hold up versus falling
towards the floor
and so start with one and keep on
working that until you feel like
all right anna my back isn't burning
anymore and then
go to two up and back
and relax good sit back on the heels
yeah you feel that raven yeah
right now you're on all fours and you're
gonna do a little bird dog so
you're gonna go opposite arm and leg are
gonna raise up
extend one heel back and away one thumb
up towards the sky
and then back to the floor same side
don't switch
go up squeeze and back down now if you
want to advance this and test your
balance
extend opposite arm and leg and then
touch the knee to elbow
this is more advanced okay in
and out now if you're even more advanced
than this you might grab a free weight
like a two or three pounder
in your hand let's switch sides all
right so opposite arm and leg extend
remember heel presses down and away
thumb points up towards the sky you're
becoming a nice
long straight arrow working the entire
back side
and if you've got a two or three pound
weight in your hand it's going to add
even more intensity
so start with no weight and if you can't
balance right away that's okay too
and relax good now both hands on the
floor
and what i want you to do is a big hip
circle with one knee
okay just draw a circle with your knee
try not to let your hips open up and
shift all over the place
right so this is a way you can really
get the blood flowing through the hips
let's go the other direction and these
are all those little small
muscle groups that stabilize your hips
when you're doing other exercises
that are really important to strengthen
and they're also
they need blood right so they get blood
here switch sides
big circle my favorite exercise
it really opens up the head it does and
it feels
like a little burn but then the more you
do it
you can start to advance this and i'll
show you that in the next couple sets
so right now it's just a little warm up
getting the blood flowing
opening up the hips nice work you guys
are doing awesome
and relax good stretch it out sit back
even nice little squishy in the hips
good we're going two more rounds so come
right back onto those elbows
and i want you to find your perfect
little plank press
position so down and press
so drop the chest almost as if it's
going to touch the floor
and then press it away from the ground
so you're going from the knees to start
if you start going from the toes it's
going to be a little bit harder
obviously right because then you got
more weight
up and down it's such a small move but
it's so difficult
that's a punch so difficult and you know
like your kids are learning this when
they're like
infants right they're trying to go from
their belly up to their hands up to
their elbows
good back and forth good and if you ever
have to drop like
my shoulders are starting to really burn
and i'm like almost going to lose form
so then i'm going to drop to my knees to
keep going right
so you got to make sure you have a
variation and relax
good let's go right to the belly
okay so you're on your belly i want you
to lift that chest bring your hands down
by your thighs
and you're going alternating arms or
you're going to
yeah jenny she's got that advanced
version
now some people will even hold a free
weight here
right they'll even hold maybe like one
pound free weights
in their hands you got to be really
strong i'm not even there yet
right so you want to work on first one
and then the other
breathing it out awesome job and then
you're going for two
maybe you want to add two at certain
times so you're like okay i'm going one
and then the other let me try two
okay that's a lot more intense let me go
back to
one at a time and then you can feel
yourself really progress
good come on back to your hands and
knees you guys are awesome looking good
ladies
looking good out there let's go hands
and knees okay
so bird dog elbow to knee create that
long extension
and then bring it back in now remember
you can touch the floor in between
each one so that you regain your balance
or you can start to really try
here to keep the balance keep your abs
engaged
keep the stability right as you keep
that knee
off the floor breathing it out excellent
job
good and let's switch sides my shoulders
even get a burn here during this
yeah good inhale
exhale and this is your whole back
working so make sure your shoulder is
not all up in your ear
right you want to relax your shoulder
that's why your thumb should point
straight up towards the sky because when
you do you rotate your shoulder
into a position that puts it at less
risk of
feeling tight and cramped up you're
externally rotating it so you're really
feeling yourself
relax the shoulder as you elongate the
arm breathe in and get out here great
and relax good now hip circles again
let's go with a forward circle to start
right
now i told you you can advance this one
too maybe you want to pick up your
opposite
arm off of the floor oh yeah this is way
harder right so there's ways to advance
this move
but you want to be like okay i'm not
falling all over the place i'm not going
down and up
so if you need the stability switch
directions going backwards
if you need the stability keep it there
if you want the challenge raise that arm
up
try to keep the shoulders up and square
and switch sides
other way big circle you got it
picking that hand up for that extra
challenge
trying to keep the hips neutral my hips
are burning
good and direction switch it backwards
good you're really starting to get the
blood flowing in these hips you guys
totally oh yeah yeah i feel like poor is
working so much more with this handout i
know
jenny so much harder balance
that's it exactly and the bigger that
circle the harder it's going to get and
relax
sit back on those hips let's go one more
time through you guys up for the
challenge let's do it
let's do it okay i know the shoulders
are burning you're doing amazing
all right here we go bring it up on the
toes
pinch and press pinch and press
remember knees to start those of you
that are new to this
right then you're here going up and down
then you might be here going up and down
then you might be here going up and down
so there's lots of levels to how to do
this one
but i like this one to start because
then you're really isolating
shoulders you're really getting the
muscles there
to fire up good last couple seconds
over here i know two and
one awesome okay coming onto your belly
now we've got the shoulders in the back
working chest up
arms are down you're looking towards the
mat bring those arms up and over the
head
and back down you're fighting gravity so
as your arms go forward
you have to think lift lift lift lift
lift
to really keep yourself from falling
forward
good that's the challenge here
i love hearing your breath over there
jenny nice job i need it
that's it keep that neck neutral
keep looking down towards the floor
you're trying to lift lift
lift lift lift keep your feet down on
the ground
you guys are looking amazing you're
doing great i know this isn't an easy
one
and when you're on your third round
you're really working out on that back
good job last two
one and relax sit back
get a nice little stretch it feels good
oh baby all right now we're coming back
into all fours
here we go opposite knee to elbow extend
good extend nice straight line
so everything from the fingertip down to
that heel
is nice and long and flexing
good job that's it exhale and
breathing thank you for the reminder
exactly
this is all reversing the effects of
gravity you guys go ahead and switch
sides
right we're working the back we're
making sure that we're not doing all the
hunching and
sitting forward but we're strengthening
the muscles that help us fight gravity
during the day during everyday
activities
that cause us to do that flexion which
is
inevitable we have to right that's the
way that we're kind of set up
but now you can strengthen the back and
relax
good all right hip circles last one do
your version
big circle forward all right bigger the
circle
the more you're going to work the hip
but you want to avoid
opening up your body so you don't want
to you don't want to rock your hips
side to side you want to keep them
pretty neutral and you can pick up the
hand
go ahead and reverse directions you can
pick up the hand at any time just to
test it
right just to test it give it a shot and
then if you're like no no not yet
then you put your hand right back down
you feel yourself getting stronger each
time
to try it differently good let's switch
up sides
other leg bring you forward nice big
circle pull the belly button in
tummy is nice and tight you're looking
great
breathe it out nice reverse directions
open up that knee feel that blood flow
come on
i know when that burn sets in you really
got to push yourself through it
nice job about those hips getting so
much love right now
burn it out and relax good grab a little
sip of water ladies
all right grab your little sip don't
drink too much you don't want it
flushing around in the body
don't want it like moving around
everywhere
we're going to go into a single legged
bridge starting this next circuit
okay you have a lot of variation here as
well so you might come onto your back
and you might just start with two legs
okay
or you're going gonna join jenny and i
we're gonna lift up the hips
we're gonna have one heel reaching
towards the sky if it's a little lower
because you're just starting out
that's okay right the goal is to get it
up there and you're pressing through the
heel and lifting
the hips squeezing the booty right
getting a nice extension
through the hips belly's in tight
and you're squeezing or you're going two
legs pressing through the heels like
raven
good and getting those hips up from the
floor good jenny let's switch sides
all right other side other leg is
reaching so i'm feeling a huge stretch
through my hamstring here too
yes i don't know if you guys are but
like definitely my shoes are always
tight
so i'm like good so you're gonna feel
that work through the glutes all right
focusing on the strength in the back
side your glutes are your powerhouse
muscle
right so you really want to make sure
you give them love you're working this
back side
last one lift and relax
amazing ladies all right let's bring it
up onto our feet
and we're going to go into a squat and
reach my favorite to work the entire
back side
and the shoulders okay so with this one
if you want to grab light weights go
ahead or follow raven
first without weight you're going to
have your feet about hip width shoulder
width apart a little wider than hip
width actually
you're going to go down for a squat and
raise the arms
up towards the sky so here you're
working the whole back side
and you're getting the shoulders working
as well when you go down and you raise
those arms
all that weight wants to pull you
forward so your back
is like so strong as you avoid that
and you fight gravity on the on the
downward face here
so it's all about keeping an upright
posture
as you lower and if you're getting tired
and you're like my god i'm setting those
babies down
i highly recommend it so that you don't
start going like this
with here with the weights oh yeah all
right that's going to create
strain on your low back not
strength okay so keep that up good relax
beautiful
now keep your weights if you want to add
the advanced version or go no weights
here
and we're going to go into a little bit
of a reverse fly
and step so i've got my knees slightly
bent
and i'm pulling the weight back towards
the wall and a little up towards the sky
but i'm bending from the waist a little
here right but i've got a nice straight
back
so here's where you want to think about
using your butt use your butt that's
your stabilizer right there
and you're pinching pulling and you're
giving that little step because that's
harder
on one leg to stabilize when you fly
with those weights you're going to
really feel the difference
yeah jenny she looks good good job raven
showing that move couple more seconds
breathe
[Music]
back and forth i just almost lost my
balance too i was like
so you can tell that gets challenging
relax good job let's bring it back down
to the floor
we're going round two bridge yes all
right so
jenny show them the single legging on
your back show them two leg is on your
back
i'm going to show you now an advanced
one from the hands so you're here
and you're going to lift all the way and
lower
so now i'm further away from the ground
makes it a lot harder on my leg and my
glute
and hamstring to get off the floor so i
gotta really fight here
fighting gravity lifting squeezing
and bringing it up nice work good job
you guys so we got lots of variation for
everyone who wherever you're at in your
fitness journey
all right to be able to do this move and
to progress and switch
other leg nice and long let's go press
through that heel squeeze the glute at
the top
[Music]
breathing it out you got it this is one
of my favorites
especially when i know how strong
all my glutes and my stability muscles
are going to be in the back side
because that makes squats easier that
makes the lunges easier it makes walks
easier it makes hikes easier
and everything easier
breathe and one more
boom and relax all right back up onto
your feet you got your squat in reach
all right so i'm going to show you no
wait for now because i'm going to give
myself just a second here to catch my
breath
good we're going down reach it up now
listen when you do this move
right and you're not holding weights
i want to show you how much lower i can
go right so i'm going so much lower
because i don't have this weight in
front that's going to pull me forward
i've got
my arms are my weight and that's a lot
so i can go lower in my squat
focus on depth of the squat with your
reach
then grab weight and then use that
resistance
because your squat's going to be a
little bit less
in depth you've got weight in your hand
unless you're jenny and you can go to
the floor
right and that's the progression
breathing it out you got it
and relax now go reverse fly and step
now raven you can add
a side step here if you want all right
so watch raven
she's going to do a reverse fly and a
side
step as she walks she's adding a little
dynamic mobility there
working her legs and she's still got
that forward bend
you can see that she's really pinching
those shoulder blades
she's working the shoulders in that
middle back
i know that for me holding my little
baby
has really been a lot easier because
i've built
a lot of strength in my upper back right
so i'm not having as much pain
all those stability muscles are stronger
last two last one
awesome one more round let's do this on
him i got this
yeah you got it come on guys get in that
sexy
back side let's do it come on lift it up
and bridge exhale as you lift
and lower lift and lower
that's it actually i like having
variation and showing you guys
the variation because i know for me i
always like variety
in my workouts so if today you want to
lay on your back
go ahead and switch do it if tomorrow or
the next workout that you do
and you've got a bridge go from the
hands if you want to try it
or if you're like man i'm so sore my
legs are killing me
do the modified with two legs so that
you can still
work your body get the blood flowing but
you have a variation that works for your
body that day
good exhale breathe it out
oh baby it's burning it's burning so
good
you can do this you gotta think strong
in my backside and relax
awesome let's come up to the feet one
more round all right
okay let's do it in reach
you guys are the best okay let's go
drop it down raise those arms and back
up exhale
i always like to think about exhaling
during the hardest part of my
exercise movement so when i gotta raise
those weights up and fight gravity
that's where i want to kind of breathe
it out and give myself
permission to exert a little extra
energy
myself getting through it looking great
oh baby it is burning oh yeah
if you don't feel this in your back then
you are like
strong as he-man you need
and you need to get heavier free weights
in your hands
you're doing great let's go last one
breathe it out and relax
okay reverse fly remember start here
nice bend in the knees forward hinge
hands are open
palms are open you're gonna reverse fly
pinch
and step nice and slow pinch
and step when you're stepping back it's
a light touch
right so you're not like whoa
you're not stepping you are
touching you're just lengthening
for a second there all the weight is
still on this front
foot and that front glute it's getting
all the work
oh yeah yes i know
you don't have to love me now you can
love me later don't worry
about it i still love you
[Music]
last two
one oh and shoulders yes
yes everything is working now don't go
anywhere i got some love for your body
okay
this is the love you give to your body
right now starts with
a nice little cross the arm over the
front
grab it here drop that shoulder towards
the floor
and give it a hug you're giving your arm
a hug
you feel that yeah love it feel the love
and think about
you gotta drop your shoulder so it's not
up here if your ear is touching your
shoulder
then you want to think about let me drop
my shoulders and that's hard to do for
some people
because they're so tight in their neck
so if it's okay
if you're looking in the mirror and
you're like this that's okay
but always be focusing on getting to
hear where you can drop your shoulder
and the more you do
these stretches and the more you're
working on your mobility through this
program
the more you're gonna feel that easily
come to your body that function okay
breathe and relax
beautiful now the rotator cuff stretch
ladies hands on the hip like you're
sassy
okay and you're gonna grab your elbow
now not everyone can grab their elbow
so some people might need to use a hand
towel all right your sweat towel
and that's okay because if you do you
grab
that sweat towel around your elbow and
you give it a little pull forward
right so if you can't reach you got to
have a little extender
that's all right yeah but if you can't
do this stretch
this is why you're having shoulder and
neck issues okay
so really work on this one and switch
other side so wrist on your hip
grab your elbow and pull it forward
you're gonna see me do the stretch with
you in a lot of different workouts
when you're cooling down because it's so
important
i do it after every workout you're lucky
i'm not making you do it after every
workout
just several that are working on the
back side like a lineman
and when we're working our back side and
our shoulders that's when you're going
to be doing this stretch it's most
important during that time
okay all right now we're going to come
down to the floor and finish with my
absolute favorite and that is child's
pose
so you worked your back you worked your
back you got all the muscles here
really reach your fingertips forward
drop your forehead
all the way down to the floor
and i want you to imagine walking your
fingertips away from your body
just feel like your arms just like
stretch armstrong right
all right just really be like wow can i
get one inch
longer right now and then i want you to
take it over to the right
i want you to really bring both your
arms over just off your mat
keep your forehead on the ground
feel that side body get a big stretch
you deserve it breathe in
take a deep breath in through your nose
in through that side body and out
then go over to that left side so as
you're stretching you're breathing into
the muscles that just gave you all that
energy
just gave you all that strength
breathing through the nose
exhale through the mouth
think about one word one word that
describes
how awesome you are
because you are awesome

proud of you guys jenny
