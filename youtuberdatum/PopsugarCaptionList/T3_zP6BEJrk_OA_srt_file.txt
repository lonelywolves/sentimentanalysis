and uh i love all of you punching
kicking come back to this fear i've been
feeling a little stressed or a little
overwhelmed
it's so therapeutic it's so cathartic
and you know working out should be fun
last time i checked
hello this was your first time
ellie ah wait i didn't get to read the
rest of it
practice makes progress so that's
another really important thing before i
completely sign off is that um
keep showing up keep pushing play the
combos like i said are advanced and if
you're new to boxing your kickboxing can
seem overwhelming but that's
that's what i love about it so much is
that it's a skill
i promise you and i always like to say
it's a judgment-free zone don't judge
yourself just have fun let your body
move don't get too in your head
it's uh obviously like the the
aesthetics you know like boxing is so
good it's total body toning
but don't let it overwhelm you practice
makes progress
absolutely no such thing as uh
perfection
