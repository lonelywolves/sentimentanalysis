about repetition
as dancers we must recognize the
importance of rehearsal
in the mass dancer on fox the
celebrities practice
a variety of dances before they perform
in front of a panel
including ken zhong paula abdul ashley
tisdale
and bryant austin green the more you
practice perfecting the art of dance
the closer you will be to unmasking the
gift of dance that
lives inside of you
one of the first styles of dance i ever
learned was jazz
a style that derived from early african
american vernacular dances in the 1900s
just one of the many styles of dance
that you'll see the costume celebrities
perform
in the mass dancer starting off with a
little
step clap in place now we're going to
learn a jazz square
so we have step cross step
back step cross take it slow
take your time you got it just square
