hi
i'm sweat instructor brittany williams
and i'm here with pop sugar today
to go through a 30 minute full body bar
exercise
this workout was built for both
beginners and intermediates so feel free
to take us at your pace
and i'll provide tips for beginners as
we go through
the equipment you'll need for today's
class a light set of dumbbells
as well as a chair that can support you
so a table top
a chair um back of the couch something
of that sort
i also recommend some water since we
will be here for 30 minutes
the way today's workout is going to go
we'll have a quick warm-up to get the
heart rate
going and really warm up the body
then we'll have an arms and abs sequence
that's eight minutes long
followed by a 12 minute legs and arms
sequence so that means
lots of arms today um but it's gonna be
great
don't worry then we'll finish off with
the glutes and abs
to finish and that's it just like that
all right
let's get started so you're going to
bring your feet hip width apart
and you're going to start by lifting the
knees into the air as you lift the arm
so it's lift lower lift
lower our only goal here is to really
provide energy
into the body and really connect with
the breath
pay attention to anything that just
doesn't feel 100 yet today
and maybe you take note of that here so
that you can modify as you need to
later on all right we're going to keep
this going
and we're going to add a lunge so it's
up lunge
up down other side up
lunge up down
up lunge up
down take this at your pace if you need
to take out the lunge
that's okay
connect to the breath
now come up right step both feet wide
your heels are going to lift then lower
heels
lift lower legs stay straight in this
calf raise
and breathe
feel the energy the heat building
through the body connect
with the core good
we're going to add on to this one in a
second as well
but you can always stay here if it
doesn't feel good
all right now up down squat
down up heels lift
lower squat down up
now as you squat if you find yourself
hinging
i want you to bring your arms to prayer
in front of you
sometimes when the arms are up overhead
as you squat
you lean forward too much we don't want
that
think about glutes down
good you're doing great now keep your
feet
wide you're going to lunge to the left
so lunge left
stand lunge stand
it's a lateral lunge you're shifting
your weight into your left foot
shifting back then lifting up find this
work
in the glutes and really press through
your foot
to stabilize just staying on the one
side here
we'll switch in a second good
now let's add some oblique work so hands
behind the head
you're gonna squat lift left knee left
elbow excuse me
to right knee squat lift
squat lift if this is too much i want
you to just do the squat
squat twist squat
twist you should really feel that left
foot planted
turn on by now good you're doing great
down up now
we're going to start the series on the
right side with the lateral lunge
so lunge lift lunge
lift every change in today's class
every one of these moves is 30 seconds
just for your reference nothing for too
too long nothing too crazy
today's class is entirely a low impact
as well
which is great love that about bar
down up last change here in our warm up
hands behind the head
squat lift the left knee squat
lift so you're finding power in the
right leg
so really drive through the right foot
as you lift up
down twist recruiting your obliques
as you twist
good just a few more down
up squat twist drive
for three two one
warm-up's done let's move to arms and
abs so go ahead and grab your weights
so you're going to come down to a
modified side plank
but you're upright so instead of your
arm being down like a side plank
you're coming all the way upright now
you're gonna bring both
weights into your right hand left leg is
long
um if you need to just use one weight
that's okay
so both weights in your right hand your
left hand becomes behind your head
you're gonna oblique crunch to bicep
curl
crunch curl
so here think about extending to the
left side
then crunching and it's a hammer curl
actually
so your palms face in heads of the
waiter
up again if you need to do this with
just one weight that's fine you also can
do no weights
this is for your biceps and your
obliques
now hold it up right one weight in each
hand
we're gonna reach to the side
as we pull this time so now we're
inviting a little bit more work into the
back
into the lats and really working that
oblique
we're gonna do this two times through
these two moves
oh yes find that squeeze
all right both weights in your right
hand hand behind the head
down curl down
curl make sure your abs are tight and
again if you find yourself leaning
forward or back
too much work without any weight and
build from there
i'd rather you keep these movements
whole and lower the weight
then be um you know too
not have a good experience the amount of
weight you hold is not
not the focus here good
one weight in each hand have that reach
and pull
oh yes really draw the elbow in
and then really reach as long as you can
we come off of this right knee in a
second
good few more reach
pull reach pull
all right now we're going to move into a
chest press so
left foot comes forward lift the back
knee so you're in a lunge position
both arms come to 90. open close
open close squeeze
the elbows together um as you bring them
together i'll show you from the sides
so perfect lunge position you're opening
to 90
and then drawing everything together
right in front of the face palms facing
good now
hold it in hinge forward extend your
arms back
tiny pulses i'll show you from the side
again so you're hinged forward
in this crescent lunge focusing on the
triceps
abs are tight but really think about
straightening the arm
and pulsing good
we'll also do these two two times
through as well breathe
you're doing great
now come back to your lunge chest press
you're just opening and closing squeeze
to the corners of your
chest as you open and think about
drawing the shoulder blades together
excuse me squeeze the corners of the
chest as you close
then think about pressing the shoulder
blades together
as you open oh these light weights start
to feel quite heavy
real quick good work keep going
keep moving
good now hinge forward arm straight
palms face up this time time to lift up
lift lift i'll show you from the side
that's it abs tight lift lift
oh back of the arms are burning
we're gonna repeat this whole series on
the other side
breathe
that's a few more lift and lift
four three two one all right this time
come down to your left knee
right leg is long both arms both weights
in your left arm hand behind the head
oblique crunch to a bicep curl
really think about finding the squeeze
here
in the right obliques and then make sure
your elbow stays still
so you have to isolate the work in the
bicep the front of the arm
yes oh
i'm out of breath already all right good
one weight in each hand add that pull
reach pull reach
pull as you reach you're gonna find your
back
turn on and as you pull down you're
going to have to squeeze through the
obliques
remember if you want to do this movement
without weight that's okay
you're still oh goodness going to get
that great work
that's it
all right one more time hand behind the
head
abs tight relax the shoulders down your
back
you want to make sure your shoulders
aren't creeping up towards your ears
oh if you're using heavy weights here
good
luck because this is not easy
good work
all right one weight in each hand for
the last time
pull reach pull
reach pull one movement is not more
important than the other
you want to maximize the reach and the
pull
that chest press is up next
okay come on all right
now right foot forward this time left
foot lifts up into your lunge
chest press open and close with the arms
if this is uncomfortable in the lunge
you can come completely to standing
that's totally fine nothing wrong with
that
sink low if you're in the lunge though
back is flat core is engaged
squeeze the corner of the chest squeeze
through the back
those kick backs pulses are next
hinge forward back leg is straight tiny
lifts palms face down this time
so i'm flipping the palms in different
directions
to really activate through different
parts of the tricep
you got it only two moves here left in
arms and abs
but like i said we are doing arms and
legs so
full body today in every sense of the
word
good work all right carefully come back
up to the beginning
into your lunge open close
open close catch your breath here
exhale as you close inhale exhale make
it sharp
that's it breathe core tight sink a
little lower
yeah find that burn in the lower body
even though we're focusing on the arms
these compound movements that's where
you get the full body work
one change left
good hinge forward this time palms face
in
tiny lips up lift and lift again i'll
show you from the side
back leg is straight you're hinged
forward this is it core tight
breathe we get a little break after this
break is a relative term
because we're moving quick today with 30
minutes
come on lift lift
breathe we're almost out
can you lift a little higher for three
two
one carefully release good work
set your weights aside for a second grab
a sip of water
and find your chair your support
whatever you're gonna use
you're doing great so you're going to
bring
the the support in a little closer
whatever you're using
and then you're going to make sure that
your side your left side will start with
it on the left side
is to the support it is optional to use
a dumbbell here
you do not have to you only need one if
you get through halfway and you're like
this dumbbell doesn't suit me
just drop it to the side that's fine i
would try to mimic whatever you do on
the first side
on the second side when we do it just to
stay even but you're still going to get
a great work
without the dumbbell so this is a six
minute series
since we have two legs we're doing it
twice 6 times 2 is 12.
so i'll see you on the other side of 12
minutes let's get started
so you are going to start with your
heels together and your feet apart
so your heels together your toes apart
in a v-shape your left hand can come to
your support
you're going to reach your arm in front
of you palm faces in
the weight is in your right hand you're
going to lift
and lower the right leg as you hammer
curl
so think about having a turnout with
your leg
that means the kneecap faces to the
right versus straight up and down it's
to the right
and your inner thigh face is up this is
to work those inner thighs
good now hold it up extend
bend extend bend i really want you to
think about the extension
reaching as long as you can to the leg
and think about the arm as you bend
keep a soft bend left knee the standing
leg and your shoulders are over your
hips so you're not leaning forward or
back
oh goodness i already burn good
that's it extend bend extend
bend all right now
you're gonna step wide second lift up
wide second lift up it's more
comfortable to bring the hands to the
hip
you can i think that's what i'm going to
do today i want you to move
slow so you feel the work
in that inner thigh and in the standing
glute as you lift
you're also going to feel this in the
chest
because of the arm oh goodness and make
sure
you are completely upright with the
chest
good now hold it in wide second feet are
wide toes turn out
tiny pulses think about pressing your
knees back
so that you're opening through the hips
so good for the hips here tiny pulses
pulse
and pulls you're pulsing down with the
thighs up with the arm
don't drop that weight if you don't have
to come on pulse
pulse we're gonna do big range of motion
again
i love alternating between these small
bar movements and big range of motion
all right now we're gonna go wide second
a curtsy lunge
wide second curtsy lunge
keep your chest up so a lot of times we
want to like hinge
down and look down be proud chest
upright
gazes up you're stepping on the back
diagonal
with the right leg
good great work
last one hold it in your curtsy lunge
you're gonna go down and up with a
curtsy lunge
with a front raise so as you're go as
you go down with the thighs
your arm comes up that's for the
shoulder
the thighs the glutes like i said full
body a little bit of everything
down lift lower down lift
down the thighs lift with the arm down
lift
all right that was one set we're gonna
do this one time through
on this side again before we switch you
ready
heels together armor in front of you
lift as you curl
catch your breath here remember turn out
your right knee cap faces out so the
inner thigh face is up
keep your back flat shoulders over your
hips and your shoulders relaxed
if you cannot do this set with your
weight drop it
it's fine i'm not going to judge you no
one's going to judge you so you
certainly shouldn't judge yourself if
you need to drop the weight that's okay
hold everything up extend straight bend
extend bend reach
through the bicep and the thigh reach
pull reach pull make sure you're not
leaning back
core is on that's it
we got a big range of motion coming in a
second
oh yes shoulders relaxed
relax your jaw all right here we go
lift out lift sometimes people laugh
when i say relax or jaw sometimes i'll
say
relax your eyebrows i've got pretty big
eyebrows so that's a good
cue for me but i think that sometimes we
hold so much stress in our face
there's no need relax
you've got this you are in control no
one else
so no time just rest the face here today
good now holding wide second tiny pulses
pulse
pulse guys i really want to drop the
weight i know exactly how you feel
don't do it don't do it i'm not going to
do it so you don't do it come on
pulse pulse find that burn through the
shoulder lengthen a little straighter
pull through the thighs open to the
inner and outer thighs
i know breathe lift lift
pulse pulse lower lower
good wide second to curtsy lunge
remember chest stays up
you keep pressing back through both
knees as you move
what that means is that your feet excuse
me
your hips are open you're pressing back
to open through the hips and activate
the thighs
this is it you're doing great only one
change left on this side
last one hold it in your curtsy
down up down
up so your back leg is slightly behind
into the left of the front leg so you're
in the staggered stance
i want you to pull all the way down
don't come to completely straight legs
keep a little bend in the knee so you're
finding your working point
you're like brittany i found it i i'm at
my working point i know
this is that last change on this side
here's five
four three two
one yes great work
set the weight aside for a second grab a
sip of water
and either move your support or come to
the other side
of it wonderful work
we get a 30 second break in between
these movements
so take advantage
all right grab your weight
same thing other side heels together
right side into the
to the chair this time hammer curls you
lift
lift lower lift lower keep a little bit
of a bend in the standing leg
abs are in tight back is flat
oh yes i don't know if i'm ready for the
second set but we're doing it
you can't let the mind take over you
just got to keep pushing
i think that's the key to most things in
life hold everything up
extend bend i want you to think about
reaching
through the back side of the leg so
reach everything
long through the back side
and bend reach bend remember that turn
out
strong point of the toe and shoulders
relaxed
and you're drawing your eyebrows like i
said last time the full face is relaxed
that's it we come to the wide second
next here it is step wide
lift wide lift
and then think about the chest with your
arm
so it's like a one-armed chest fly
almost
if you need to drop the weight the
dumbbell
go for it again no one's going to judge
you for it
i get it but try to do what you did on
the first side
oh yes down lift
hold it low tiny pulses pulse
pulse you also if this is too much you
can hold the weight here
for a little bit just for a little break
then get back into it
if you want even a little bit more you
can hold it straight arms that works too
but if you can try to keep it in one arm
so we're fatiguing the shoulder
on the left side
just proud you've got this sink a little
lower
all right wide second curtsy lunge
wide second curtsy lunge
as you step wide pulse down
and your lunge pulls down so that pulse
is where the work is
so really sink low sink
low it's about staying low
less about coming completely upright
you should feel that burn that heart
rate lifted
you're doing great
hold it in your curtsy lunge chest
upright take it down
up down up
this is too much for the shoulder hand
can come to the hip for now
and down up you also can do
both arms again i get it
but try just one arm if you can
isolating the work in the left shoulder
and in the legs you guys this burns
come on all right come up right heels
together
scent from the top you're like yeah
of course it burns it's bar put it
together i should know that
oh but it always sneaks up on you the
burn comes out of nowhere
and then you gotta fight through
mentally that's really what drove me to
bar
at first i love the mental push
pushing your body past the limits you
thought you had come on
all right hold it up extensions extend
bend extend bend
but i think in every workout no matter
how hard or easy it is
you have that moment where you want to
stop maybe because you're mentally
tired you're fatigued you're not in it
maybe because your phone is ringing your
kid's yelling at you
but it feels so good to push through to
find your best self in that workout
that's what we're gonna do right here so
if you haven't found it yet
keep pushing keep pushing she's here
all right hold it along wide second
lift wide second lift
and like i said you can keep your hand
to your hip the whole time if you'd like
i'm bringing mine back to the chair
because i need a little bit of support
with the balance today
not every day is going to be the same
some days balance is great
in other days i have problems balancing
on two feet so
it's all right today is not that day
all right last one hold it long
tiny pulses my shoulders on fire
officially come on
pulse lift pulse lift remember toes turn
out
back is flat if you need to arms in
front of you
still pulsing or here in front of the
chest but do not cheat yourself
only take the modification if you truly
need it and only you know
oh pulse pulse two changes left
that's it one minute one minute that's
all i'm asking for you right here
all right curtsy wide
curtsy wide second get low remember
it's all about pulsing low pulse
pulse pulse oh yes pulse let it burn
pulse pulse
this is too much slow it down you do not
have to keep my pace
to get a good workout i promise
all right last one here holding your
curtsy lunge
down up as the arm goes up
down make sure you're only stopping the
arm at shoulder height
so it doesn't come up here i want you to
have control
it comes straight to shoulder height
then lower
and remember keep a bend in both knees
the whole time
that's it good i probably have a very
pain
look on my face and it's because this
burns good
down up come on down
up for three two
one yes high five
great work we're done with weights right

bridge so arms are long

slowly lift

better
