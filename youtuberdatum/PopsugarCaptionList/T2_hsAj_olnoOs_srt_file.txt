name of rafi i've tagged him
on my story but i also will tag him on
my page after this post with this
awesome outfit so you can find out
where to follow him but this was an
amazing piece
that is a one of a kind and i'm the only
one that has it
i love it how often do i work out a week
well
that has been changing in quarantine
i've actually been working out more
because i find that it refuels me it
re-energizes me
and it keeps me excited about life so
actually yesterday
i hate to say this but it's true so i
have to tell you guys the truth
yesterday i did 12 workouts now two of
them were stretch workouts
but the other 10 were at least 20
minutes if not 40 minute workouts
and i was working out all day long
shooting some incredible videos
so um yeah if you guys want to follow me
my instagram is at dejareilly my twitter
is at dejareilly
and you can follow me here youtube.com
popsugarfitness or youtube.comriley
yes yes i'm gonna answer just a few more
questions
and then i am out for the day
oh yeah you finally got to do a live
workout with me i'm so excited
so happy that you were here today you
love my boombox well
it is from bump box so the company is
spelled
b-u-m-p-b-o-x-x and you can follow them
on instagram too
they sent me that amazing lovely gift
keeping all my tunes pumping it gets
pretty loud
so in the mornings i don't want to wake
up my neighbors so i just like play it
for my little speakers here
but i love love love that boombox
any tips for oh thank you so much
any tips for new kickboxers yes so
i always say practice doesn't
necessarily
make perfect but practice makes polished
so everything that i do even when i'm
practicing my shadow boxing which i do
almost every
day i work on the technique i do it slow
nice and slow
then i bring it back into guard punching
slow super slow
and bringing it back into guard i slow
everything down before i speed it up
because i don't want to sacrifice my
form
so the same thing goes for kickboxing
for me i've been kicking for a long time
since i'm a dancer
but i had to practice the technique of
kickboxing and i'm still practicing
i'm still getting better every single
day so i just do everything nice and
slow
ease into it slow and it's not about the
leg getting super super high you'll get
there but you have to work with yourself
so at first your legs might seem like
they're a little low to the ground
but don't worry you're building and
you're doing the best you can
so trust yourself you'll earn a higher
kick in no time
yes i was a trained dancer so i started
dancing at the age of three and trained
in ballet jazz tap lyrical flamenco
hip-hop a plethora of other styles
and then i moved out to california at
the age of 19
to pursue dance as a career and then i
was a professional dancer for almost a
decade
i danced for artists such as beyonce
lady gaga
um katy perry nicki minaj
trey songz i toured with him for years
he was one of my favorite artists to
work with
and i was so blessed to have an amazing
dance career and then transition into
fitness
oh wow you're an ex jazz dancer that's
amazing jazz was one of my
favorite styles of dance and i still
love it to this day
all right guys just 30 more seconds with
me i see the questions popping up so i
want to make sure
that i give you guys my time and then
i'm gonna head on
out okay a lot of people are asking me
about eating
so this will be my last answer i always
say to everyone because i'm not a
nutritionist and i'm not a dietitian but
i do consult with them i have a lot of
friends that are in that field
and they always tell me not everything
works for everyone so i would recommend
to you before i tell you what i like to
eat
to go find a certified dietitian
or nutritionist that can help you carve
out the best diet for you
now for me i like to eat a lot of carbs
because i need a lot of energy
but i also like to put healthy things
into my body so i eat a ton of greens
i eat some protein i've started to
eliminate meat because i'm
going plant-based so little by little
i've been weaning off the meat and
finding other ways to get my protein
whether
it's in a protein shake or i have to you
know eat something else that has those
nutrients in it
um i'm always doing my best to carve out
healthy eating habits and you should too
because nutrition
goes hand in hand with fitness so you
got to make it
one single lifestyle together all right
