with me doing this today
let's cool it down as promised big wide
stance
fold forward hands on your thighs just
relax your head
shift it over to the right side left leg

just think about what you just

slowly come on up hands on your tailbone

pumped
that i got to work out with you today
live oh
anyone else just sweating insanely
all right let's pull that left heel to
the glute and as you start to cool down
down a bit as you start to cool down i
want you to think about
what you just accomplished switch legs
okay
not thinking about oh man i had to
modify this this was really hard
i had to limit myself on this because
maybe i'm sore here
whatever it is big deep breath in
whatever it is you and i showed up today
and we gave 100 of what we had
okay whether that was full of energy
completely motivated
or if it was uh maybe not so much maybe
i'm sore maybe i'm tired maybe i've got
so many things on my plate
what you did today was you showed up and
you gave it all you had
that's all i ever and i'm going to ask
for okay
that's all we can ever expect of
ourselves too so why not
celebrate the athlete that you are the
hard-working person that you are
instead of focusing on the shortcomings
focusing on what you just crushed
okay it's not selfish to be proud of
yourself and we've got to remember that
okay so grab some water
if you have any questions you can go
ahead and stick them here i'm going to
grab water myself
all right shall we chat for a second
maybe 10 minutes i don't know if you
guys have ever met dustin but
dusty want to come say hi this is the
videographer of all of my workouts
slash my fiance so
let's chat okay let me see your
questions here
my heart is pumping thank you as well
i know this is kind of a little bit
shadowy so i'll try to scoot back here
all right thank you thank you for
the encouraging words what is one of
your most favorite
proudest moments um christina good
question i would say
one of my most favorite proudest moments
kind of closed down
and we got to do meet and greets so we
got you we got to meet the people that
are using our workouts on our channel
and we got to celebrate what they had
accomplished
with me because it it may seem like this
is a very interactive place but truly
it's just
me dustin and age every day so it's
really hard for
for us to see you guys with this being a
digital platform so
meeting you guys definitely one of my
proudest moments
thank you so much for the workouts
you're so welcome
would you recommend hit to help build
muscle
i would recommend a combination of hit
and really challenging resistance
training and i know that might be tough
for some people right now because maybe
you don't have access to dumbbells
but resistance training is going to
challenge
your muscles you're going to create
micro tears in your muscles
that have to repair and heal and grow
stronger
and if you're just doing a lot of high
volume exercises
a lot of just low intensity exercises
your muscles aren't going to be
challenged and broken down kind of
creating those
mini injuries or micro tears to build
stronger
okay with that i also recommend a
calorie
surplus so eating more calories per day
than you burn
so that your muscles can actually have
the fuel to build
okay so i i don't recommend one specific
style of training not just hit or not
just strength training or power lifting
but i do recommend in every workout that
you challenge yourself
in terms of progressive overload so do
you have weights that you can
step it up a little bit more do you have
a way to hold more time
under tension do you have a way to add a
little pause at the bottom so that your
acceleration
in the eccentric and concentric phases
of your lift are challenging you
okay so building muscle is going to
require calorie surplus
good resistance training to a very
challenging standpoint not just a lot of
reps not just body weight
and then a combination of that and high
intensity interval cardio
so that you can also have the
respiratory capabilities
to withstand your strength training okay
if you have no cardio training
you're not going to be able to breathe
through a full heavy lifting workout
right so they've got to go hand in hand
but nutrition
is also something that people don't take
into account also
over training can really harm you so
making sure you're not training more
than your body can keep up with in terms
of recovery
sleep hydration okay it's it's a big
picture it's not just one straight
answer and it's going to be different
for everyone as well but those are some
things to think about
okay thank you guys
my comment is somehow lost but i'll ask
you and i do your workouts twice a day
but
i'm not losing weight okay so a couple
things to think about there
there's again with everything it's going
to be a it depends answer
okay if you're doing workouts twice a
day and your nutrition is not adding up
to put you in a calorie deficit you will
not lose weight
okay without a calorie deficit meaning
you are burning more calories than you
are expect or then you're consuming
per day no matter what kind of training
you're doing
you will not lose weight okay so the
first thing to check in is
what is basal metabolic rate what amount
of calories am i burning
in a day just naturally with my body and
then how active am i
in a day okay that's gonna give you your
calories for
maintenance right then you're gonna need
to subtract
three to five hundred calories from
there to achieve a calorie deficit
now you can also add more activity and
if you're a pretty stagnant lifestyle
and you don't have a ton of activity in
your job
you can challenge yourself to add in
more activity okay
but it's not a i'm doing two workouts
today why am i not losing weight or
i'm doing one workout a day and i'm
running later if you
truly want to achieve weight loss and
hopefully fat loss
right toning up and looking nice and
lean and strong you have to have a
calorie deficit
okay so if your nutrition is outweighing
the amount of calories that you're
burning
you won't lose weight so check in on
that check in to make sure also
on the flip side you're not over
training okay you're not doing something
to where
you're exhausted all the time your body
can't keep up it slows down you tend to
burn less calories throughout the day
because you're so tired from those two
workouts
okay your total daily energy expenditure
is what you need to focus on not just
number of workouts number of minutes
worked out but
how much are you burning throughout the
day meaning how active are you
how much are you getting up and and
starting to walk or doing something
active
and then making sure that your calorie
deficit is achieved
okay but great question thanks for
asking that
can you do a split in a back bed yes
um all right
i'm looking for questions you guys have
great questions how did you manage two
workouts today
so we'll be filming after this one for
my own channel so i'll take a break i'll
eat some lunch we'll catch up on emails
meet with the team a little bit i'll
give myself a chance to recover
because as you can see i went hard and
then
i'll do my workout for my channel in a
little bit
okay let me do just a couple more
questions
great questions
um someone's asking they only have a
pair of five kg dumbbells is it bad
um well number one i would say it's not
you're not ever limited by
equipment you're not ever limited in
terms of fitness you can always
always make it work now this also
depends on your goals when you say am i
limited
i don't know what your goal is i don't
know if you are trying to pack on muscle
if that is the case it might be a bit
challenging for you to
add a lot of muscle to your body or add
any lean body mass with just
one specific weight but it's not
impossible it also depends on your
starting point if you are
very new to fitness you have a pretty
good advantage of being able to add a
good amount of lean body mass
to your body in the beginning stages of
your resistance training
so those are things to take into account
just first what is your goal and where
are you starting
number three is your nutrition and this
goes back to what is your goal
if you are trying to lose weight say
you're trying to lose weight and you
have these five kilogram dumbbells
and you're doing one workout a day and
you're pretty stagnant for the rest of
the day because of maybe your job
and then you're eating in maintenance
calories or a calorie surplus
that's going to be limiting to a weight
loss goal okay
but if you're just trying to get
stronger get a little bit more fit it's
not necessarily a weight loss or
muscle gain objective you can absolutely
do this there are so many ways to
achieve progressive overload with
without changing your dumbbell weight
okay so you can
add more speed in the concentric part of
your lift i always talk about
eccentric being the opening or the
lengthening of the muscle
concentric being when you're shortening
the muscle so challenging yourself to
add a little bit more emphasis
on a good concentric contraction
challenging yourself to achieve more
reps in the time that you're given
challenging yourself to add more sets of
the workout of the
the intense sets or reps that you're
doing
um taking less rest adding a little
pause halfway up
and then finishing there are so many
ways to achieve
a progressive overload that is not
indicative or is not dependent on your
dumbbell weight
okay you just have to get more uh a
little bit more creative maybe
and then the last thing i'll say is you
are worth the investment if i can
challenge you to invest in
anything maybe save a dollar a week
maybe save two or three dollars a week
ten dollars a month whatever it is you
are worth the investment
of adding to your personal health
journey okay
i challenge people all the time if
you're on a journey and you are just
crushing it why not reward yourself with
something that will continue to add to
your journey instead of saying i'm going
to reward myself with
something that makes my belly hurt like
pizza or something that
you know makes me nauseous like drinking
too much why don't you add something to
your journey like a new pair of socks
a new pair of training shoes a new set
of dumbbells
something that's going to keep you
moving forward on the journey that
you're trying to achieve and that you're
working so hard in
okay instead of saying two steps forward
one or two steps back because you don't
feel good then you don't train well then
you don't sleep well
and you kind of set yourself back a
little bit do something that adds to the
journey
okay new sneakers gonna get you excited
for a workout tomorrow a new set of
dumbbells you're gonna challenge
yourself in a new way with resistance
training okay
so you're always always worth the
investment um outside of that
just continue to challenge yourself in
whatever way you can right now i'm
my biggest mission in life is to make
fitness accessible to everyone
everywhere no matter what your bank
