first round of exercises here we go you
can see right on the screen we have a
warm-up and a dynamic warm-up
timer is going to be right here you'll
be able to hear beeps as we move so
let's go ahead and come down to elbows
and knees we're getting started if you
have a fitness tracker i am using my
apple watch today i'm going to set it
on hit now i just want you to take your
right knee through a giant circle while
we're getting your
tracker set up if you are using the
fitness tracker
here we go i can't even figure out my
tracker
pull the heel in close towards the booty
try to spread the toes and then all i
want you to do is reverse the direction
of your circle everything that we do in
the right leg we're going to do on the
left
if you're on your hands come down to
your elbows that way you can give your
lower back a little bit more support
push and go and then let's go ahead and
switch over onto the opposite leg
so pull the heel in close towards the
booty
you're just taking your knee up and over
a fire hydrant pressing your elbows into
the mat
if you are on your hands come down to
your elbows it will help support your
lower back even more
that way you don't lose your spine by
coming onto the hands go ahead and
reverse the direction of your circle
after this we're going to be coming onto
our backs for some single leg
leg lowers which is a hamstring and a
hip warm up
if you do not warm up before your
workouts you are definitely not setting
yourself up for success and we are all
about success over here
go ahead and come over onto your back i
want you to keep your left leg as
straight as possible if that means it's
right here
because you can't lift it up here
without keeping it straight then so be
it
from here you can go ahead and bend your
elbows press the elbows into the ground
toes pull towards the chin and all we're
doing is just lifting and lowering the
right leg
use an exhale to get your foot back up
again if your left leg is not straight
and you have a bent knee i need you to
straighten your leg and put it wherever
it goes in space
that allows you to have a locked knee of
the extended leg
everything we do on the right we're
going to do on the left so let's go
ahead and switch sides
so lift your right leg up until you
start to feel the knee once and then
once you find that spot that's where
you're going to lift and lower the left
leg so this is working on the lower abs
this is opening up the hips
this is warming up the hamstrings
after this we're going to be heading on
to into
our downward facing dog and we're going
to be doing some leg kicks
another hip opener but also is going to
warm the upper body up
press press the elbows into the ground
if you notice my elbows are bent
my elbows are in the shape of an a good
now go ahead and come into her downward
facing dog
i like to flip the top of my mat because
it gives my hands a little bit more grip
bend the knees push the tailbone to the
sky pull the chest towards the shoelaces
take a deep breath in
and then as you exhale you're gonna be
balancing on one leg and the other and
you're just lifting
one leg up to the sky and then the other
pull the belly button towards the spine
push into the hands
pull the shoulders away from the ears
and then i want you to picture yourself
sliding into home base that is a
baseball reference
if you are familiar with baseball you're
going to slide into homemade that means
your arms are up overhead
after our single leg leg lowers we're
going to be heading into some thoracic
rotations it's another way to warm up
the body
for some movement so all i'm going to do
is bring my right leg forward
left leg stays back and then i'm going
to open up
and close down so opening up
bringing my elbow on the inside of my
right foot if i can bring my elbow down
towards the ground awesome if i can't
also awesome but just goes to show you
have some tight hips and you might want
to work on
implementing some hip ability into your
workout routine
reaching up lowering down looks like we
still have about 12 seconds everything
we do
on the right we do on the left
really reaching up creating a t position
with the hands
now from there we're just going to go
ahead and switch over to the left side
so i have my low lunge right hand is on
the ground
lifting up and then slowly adding some
rotation throughout my upper
spine the thoracic spine if you will
hence it's called a thoracic rotation
trying to get the left elbow on the
inside of the left foot
after this we're going to be heading
into our dynamic warm-up as you can tell
on the screen
each one of those exercises are going to
be done when we're going to do the
entire round two times through
six more seconds left here
good now go ahead and come on up to
standing we've got about eight seconds
i'm just gonna make sure
that we're solid here and we're gonna be
starting with our
bounces so what i want you to do is i
want you to pull the toes to the top of
the shoes we're gonna be warming up your
ankles and then all you're doing
is just hopping up and down
so i'm coming to you live from new york
city
i don't know where you guys are turning
in from you can leave me a comment
though but pull the toes towards the top
of the shoes put the hands and fists
warming up the ankles people mostly
always forget about their ankles
and that is one of the joints that is
taking the load of the entire body
so we got to warm that up from here
we're going to be doing knee drivers
so i want you to do is drive the right
knee into the chest and then as soon as
that buzzer hits again in 20 seconds
we're going to be doing
jumping jacks if you have downstairs
neighbors that don't like when you move
i'm going to give you an option straight
line from the head to the tailbone
spread the chest put the hands out in
front of you so another way of thinking
about spreading the chest is pull the
shoulders away from the ears
keep going in five seconds you're gonna
head right into jumping jacks
two one so you're going into full-on
jumping jacks if you have grumpy
downstairs neighbors
you can do no hopping jumping jacks but
if you came for a workout you better be
hopping it out
in about 10 seconds we're going to
switch over to the left side
knee drivers
so remember this is a part of our
dynamic warm-up so pulling the left knee
in towards the chest
right leg is planted you want to pull
the shoulders away from the ears spread
the chest or pull the shoulder blades
together behind you
you're pulling left knee in towards your
chest
[Music]
you've got 10 seconds left so this is
where we're trying to elevate our heart
rates if you have a fitness tracker you
can see
is my heart rate elevating i'm at about
a 145 bpm
which is where i want to be i want my
heart rate to come up now remember that
our heart rates aren't going to be the
same but sometimes it's nice to hear
numbers
so you can kind of understand where the
body is
after this we're going to be heading
into inchworms
followed by swimmers
five four three
two one inchworms names of the game is
to warm up the hamstrings
so i hinge at the hips i keep my legs as
straight as possible as i walk out the
push-up plank position
and then i walk my feet up feet back
hands back all the way up walk out
feet up feet back
hands back stand up
[Music]
15 seconds left to go
get in the booty up in the air we should
fill it in the core
walk back good if you are walking
yourself out go ahead and stay
in push-up plank position
you're gonna lower down onto your belly
reach the arms out in front of you and
then all we're doing is swimmers
so warming up our lower backs
another reference baseball reference
sliding into home base opposite arm
opposite leg or lifting as soon as this
buzzer goes off
we're gonna do all those exercises from
the top starting with our bounces
so we're just swimming swimming swimming
you might feel your shoulders start to
turn on you've got five seconds left do
not stop now keep going three
two one from the top so in your bounces
i want you to pull the toes to the top
of the shoes
put the hands by the fist and you're
warming up your ankles
if you want to add a little bit more
oomph you can try to get a little bit
more height
but what you're really trying to do is
you're trying to let the ankles absorb
the movement of the body in a warm-up
fashion
eight seconds left to go from here we're
gonna head right into our knee drivers
but i want us to start on the left side
so this would be my
left knee driving in right here so
right leg is planted left knee's driving
in the shoulders away from the ears
spread the chest
but leave the arms where they are so
when i tell you to spread your chest
what i'm trying to get you not to do
is hunch over pull the shoulders away
from the ear spread the chest
left knee drives into the chest
keep the gaze in front of you as soon as
that buzzer hits
we're going into our jumping jacks here
we go
[Music]
so as we start to wind up our dynamic
warm-up we're gonna be heading into our
first round of tabata
if you guys aren't familiar what tabata
is it's supposed to be a form of high
intensity interval training
where you're pushing yourself 70 and
beyond which means on a scale of 1 to 10
for the uh next part of class
i need you to constantly feel like you
are at 70
so from here we're gonna drive the right
knee into the chest
right now we should be scale of one to
ten
you wanna be like at a five six
making your way up to seven i'm going to
say that again
when we are doing tabata you want to be
working
at 70 and above on a scale of 1 to 10
you want to constantly feel like you're
at
seven or higher if you are not then
you're not pushing yourself
okay and we came to push ourselves
it's only 25 minutes if you are doing
hit correctly then you are always riding
that wave
of staying on a scale of one to ten
at a seven and higher so
if you really want that hardcore intense
workout today
we're doing our inchworms now remember
scale of one to ten
seven and above
so an inch room really challenges your
core strength challenges your hamstring
mobility
challenges your arm strength as you head
into
what is actually a handstand drill so if
you're a yogi
one of our handstand drills is we
actually walk up into this pike
before bringing ourselves either all the
way up in the air
you got 10 seconds left to go
if you're walking yourself out one thing
i also don't want you to do
is if your hands are walking out here
you're doing it incorrectly
hands are facing forward from here
coming down to your belly
slide into home base baseball reference
and swim your way
towards the final 23 seconds
of our dynamic warm-up blow the air out
swim swim swim shoulders are going to
probably start to burn
this is only temporary 10 seconds left
to go so we're warming up our lower back
we're strengthening our lower back we're
turning on our glutes
three two one all right
let me show you guys what we have in
store for tabata round number one
oh wow all right so here's what we're
gonna do see all of those exercises
you're gonna do them 20 seconds on 10
seconds off
and we're just going to flip flop
through them so we're going to be doing
alternating reverse lunge for 20 seconds
we're going to do a 10 second transition
into skaters
we start in 10 seconds there's eight
rounds total each exercise will be done
four times we're gonna do exercise one
exercise two exercise one exercise two
exercise one exercise two you get the
hang of it
if you have weights at home
or if you want to bump up the intensity
because remember on a scale of one to
ten where should you be
seven and above you could hold on to a
dumbbell
if you don't have weights your back knee
needs to kiss the ground
if your back knee is unable to kiss the
ground from here we're doing skaters if
your back knee is not able to kiss the
ground
you really got to work on that hip
mobility skaters
i'm going side to side
land soft take off
keep going
[Music]
three two one so
again i have a dumbbell right here this
is body weight but if you want to bump
up the intensity
of your workout because remember on a
scale of one to ten where are we trying
to be
seven and above alternating reverse
lunge
if you're holding on to a dumbbell which
is optional
shoulders stay stacked over the hips
back knee kisses the ground
so this is round two we have four rounds
total three
two one heading into our skaters
so if you're ready to keep moving
because you're not at that seven
just come right into this exercise
otherwise 20 seconds on
go now
if you have trouble landing you can tap
your inside foot down okay
so you should be filling the outer edges
of your booty turn on
three two one round three alternating
reverse lunge
if you want to hold on to that dumbbell
go ahead and grab it otherwise you're
starting in three
two go what is your core doing
every time you come up to standing blow
the air out
make sure that your knee stays behind
the toe
[Music]
three two we have 10 seconds
as soon as the beefy goes again we go
right into our skaters
go ahead and get started right now
remember on a scale of 1 to 10
you need to be at a seven and above that
means if you're at a seven can you push
to an
eight you wanna constantly
be keeping yourself in what we consider
the red since this is supposed to be a
hit class
it's supposed to be challenging that's
why it's short
alternating reverse lunge what is this
round four
you got three two one
so keep the sternum up i'm trying to get
my back knee to kiss the ground
i use my opposite arm in front of me
to kind of help balance out what's
happening the body
speed skaters or if you're not at a
seven
and you need to bump it up head into the
exercise right now
otherwise this is our final round of
speed skaters you never have to do these
again with me today

three two one
final round if you're watching this
video at a later time
and you want to bump up the intensity
here's what you do you add dumbbells

stand and repeat
these are 10 pound dumbbells by the way
another trick in the trade you can
elevate the heels of your hands

scale of one to ten where are you if
it's not above a seven i need you to
pick up the intensity
soften the elbows pull the shoulders
away from the ears
shift the weight forward and blow the
air out
one all right final round how you guys
feeling
here we go mat work
so we're doing push-up releases followed
by leg lowers
15 seconds until we go
heart rate's up it's a good thing
push-up releases
at the bottom of your push-up your
elbows are in the shape of an a your
thumbs are in your armpit
lower down reach pull push
straight line from the head to the heels
as you push yourself
up and lower down i want you to clinch
your booty together
if you're doing your push-ups from your
knees
this is a good exercise that's going to
train you how to do push-up properly
i always ask my clients how long do you
plan on doing push-ups from the knees
if you want to elevate yourself plug the
elbows into the ground toes pull towards
the shin
lower one leg down and then the other if
you've been doing push-ups from your
knees for a long time
when do you plan on doing push-ups from
your feet
if it's in the near future then i want
you to try
push-up releases i would rather you get
one or two
push-up releases not on your knees
on your feet then four or five push-up
releases on your knees
and not ever trying so here we go
straight line from the head to the heels
lower down reach pull push up
it's not easy but like i said when do
you plan on
training yourself to learn a true
push-up
three two one flipping over
if you want to still make your workout
more challenging
grab a dumbbell push it over
your sternum or your chest plate
lowering one heel down and then the
other
goal is to keep a straight leg
now i'm not looking at my feet i'm
looking straight overhead
toes pull towards the shin heel never
touches the ground three
two one
push-up releases so the bottom of my
push-up my thumbs are in my armpit my
elbows are at a 45-degree angle it's not
a t it's not an i it's an a
here we go round three four
keep going
three two one
flipping over same thing if you want it
to be more intense and you have
weights available at home otherwise
you can keep doing it as body weight
use an exhale to get your foot back up
toe pulls towards the shin
pull the shoulders away from the ears
don't look at the feet or the dumbbell
look straight overhead three
two one all right we're in our final
round
if you have push-ups not on your knees
you can do full push-ups without the
release a straight line from that to the
heel
feet are together lowering down lifting
up
if you find your max on your push-ups
you can do your push-up releases again
we train to help ourselves get stronger
so if you're always doing push-ups from
your knees
when do you learn to do them on your
feet
final exercise of the set and then we're
going to stretch and that would have
been our
45 or 25 minute body weight hit

my friends
so that was our 25 minute body weight
hit class
remember the weights were optional if
you don't have weights there are options
to do workouts without weights
um we really only added the weights in
if you wanted to bump the intensity up
however if you're not landing the form
for some of your exercises
it's best to start with body weight
before you start adding weights this is
one of those workouts that you can do
throughout the week multiple times i
would say you could do a workout like
this maybe two
maybe three times a week if that's what
you're interested in
25 minutes short so you can fit it in
where you can
in and out the door make sure you're
hydrating see if you guys had any
