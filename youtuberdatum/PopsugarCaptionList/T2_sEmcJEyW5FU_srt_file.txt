slip slip shuffle knees are soft abs are
tight
extend those punches you want to snap
them out
always want to hit eye level because
that's how we're going to sculpt those
shoulders
now i know the tendency for the slips
you want to lean back naturally
but that's not going to do anything for
your core so it may feel weird visualize
a small windshield wiper
and you just want to make that little
movement
it's a little fast hands are up one two
slip slip
ninjas are we ready to add on let's do

uppercuts and a hook in three two one
let's go
one two slip slip up up hook
all about above the belt that's what
we're sculpting
that's what we're working and of course
we're getting in your core
boxing is all about the core all the
time that's the added bonus
one two slip flip up up hook now we have
two more target zones
let's talk about them uppercuts
underneath the chin hooks
side of the chin think about it
visualize it snap your punches back to
your face like you have a magnet in your
chin
and you want to bring them back protect
your face here we go
one two slip slip thirty seconds how are
you feeling
so good so good killing it i know
right we're sculpting their shoulders or
sculpting that core
now if you have like hand weights at
home and you wanna just add a little
layer of intensity
pick them up we're wearing our b b quick
wrap so you can find on my glow shot
page
and they just kind of give you ninja
powers we love them
all right keep it up two more one two
slip a little more power power use your
legs
this is it and done
beautiful work now i'm obsessed with
push-ups
sorry sorry sorry but they're good for
you
they're so great for your upper body
they're actually full body you're going
to get a lot of core as well
we're going to do wide grip push-ups so
it's going to focus on our chest and our
back
we'll take it from the side now they're
traveling tip is going to show you a few
different modifications
so take it to your high plank position
your feet or hip distance apart
shoulders stacked underneath your wrist
now you're going to walk your hand out
and your foot
we're getting into a wide grip position
chest connects to the ground
exhalation at the top bring it back into
that high plank tips dropping it to our
knees
and now we're going to pick up the piece
just slightly what you can do also for
another modification
you can hold a high plank and you're
also more than welcome
to hold a low point your body's under
tension
you're still sculpting you're still
burning calories you're still working
please do not feel bad about
modifications
and you can work up to it the more you
press play
the easier it gets right now we're going
we don't have to go so fast
right this is hard enough and we're
completely engaged the entire time by
staying in that high point
you need to drop it to your knees drop
it let's do one more
push up bring it back in and let's pick
it up now we need to balance this out
let's get ready to work the other side
show me your neutral stance
show me that guard three minutes on the
clock and let's go
you are headed orthodox we are headed
south paul get ready work in three
two one nice and slow you have your jab
cross slip right slip left
boxer shuffle you know we're gonna add
on here we go
one two lean into your slips think about
it
visualize it target zone right for the
front of the base pick
those punches up sculpt above the belt
last one and we're gonna get ready to
work here we go one
two slip slip in four
three two show me go one two
slip slip shuffle breathe
sometimes you can you can if that helps
you
tighten up the core one two slip slip

idea how
beneficial boxing is not for the whole
body but oh my gosh

we're going to add on
we're going to add those power punches
last one all right take it from the top
slow here we go one two
slip slip lead up rear up
hook try it again target zone's face
lean into it then underneath the chin
side of the face last one one two
slip slip get ready in four three
two show me go one two slip
flip up up hook now
i know we're focusing on above the belt
however
boxing is all about generating that
power through your legs
so make sure you're lifting up your
heels for those power punches
these are soft abs are tight it's easier
to throw the punches
when you're grounded versus having laid
your legs straight right
keep working keep going one two slip
slip
now as you're starting to feel it those
shoulders are getting a little fatigued
right
that's when we want you to give us a
little more power
think about it be present what are you
working what are you feeling
power punches let's go
one two slip slip elbow for that's
a hook 90 degree angle i know it can
feel a little bit weird get it up
and you're going to feel that bicep
right one two three seconds on the clock
up up hook whoa
sometimes the boxing drill yeah girl
aggressive right
yep keep it up 20 seconds nice work
you're doing amazing and guess what the
more you push play the easier it gets
i promise keep it up
we have about 10 seconds left so let's
get in this is it
last one last one up up hook amazing
great job all right we have to go back
to your push-ups
push-ups are so good for you we can do
it you can do it
we're doing it you're doing it we're in
this with you and we're
sweating along with you for sure all
right
so i want you to have a good healthy
relationship with the push-ups a lot of
people kind of cringe when you hear the
word push-up or burpee
but they are so good and you get so
strong
so let's set it up i guess we'll go this
way first
feet hip just apart shoulders stacked
underneath your wrist let's walk it
focus on that chest and that back
exhalation at the top whether you're
doing it modified or not
remember a tip has tons of ways she can
modify
drop her to her knees high plank low
plank
you do you because why you are a badass
no matter what modified or not i love
saying that because it's true
you're you're still here right you're
still working out
yep sometimes we have great days
sometimes we're
we're we're not feeling it maybe but
think about how you're going to feel
afterwards push-ups are so good you love
them trick yourself
thank you do you love push-ups

that they are hard
okay big breath and big breath out 30
seconds for a little breather if you
need to towel off a little bit
or take a sip of water so on deck we
have another boxing drill

in and working the brain a little bit
right so
that's technically above the belt see

one two up up hook i had to get your
brain involved
i had to and this traveling bob and
weave does the trick
a lot of times we like to stay in place
because it feels comfortable
well i want you to get uncomfortable and
the better you get at it i want you to
move
a little bit more all right keep it up
one two up power show it here we go
back is tall abs are tight now the bob

two up up hook power under
hands up eyes on your opponent we're in
the ring
there we go and the looser you get in
your shoulders
the better your punches are going to be
i promise
you tend to get a little stiff and tight
but once you get the hang of it
you'll be a pro last one last one stay
with us
here we go final four three two
one done amazing now we're bringing it
down to the ground
it feels like nothing but let me assure
you after 60 seconds
it will feel like everything so we do
tricep dips
hey if you have a bench or a chair
grab it you're more than welcome to use
that all right we wanted to keep it
equipment free
your palms are faced or your hands are
facing you pop it up
tip is going to stay seated and she'll
still she'll still be working triceps so
bring it down and up
pull your abs into your spine your back
is tall i know it's the smallest
movement
especially when you're doing it on the
ground
but let me tell you your triceps are
going to be burning off
very quickly very quickly
i always i always like to stay away from
this especially if i didn't have
a bench or a chair because i always
think
it just doesn't seem like anything and
then i brought it into a video and i was
like
holy crap right
don't take much on this i know seriously
it's the smallest movement you want to
keep those elbows pointed to the back of
the room your fingers are pointed
towards you
holy triceps burn oh my gosh
now just keep in mind i'm going to add a
progression to this on your next round
you're welcome

working both stances it does engage your
brain
so much more and then of course we want
to avoid any
muscle imbalances it's just a nice
challenge
