push-ups are so great for a full body
okay let's bring it up
squat and knee strike this is crazy
we're going to start with this leg get
ready to work in three
two one give me a squat hands up
overhead
strike squat strike
you know i had to bring in a little
kickboxing for you hello
it's boxing and bubbles it's
you really feel it with the tension
right
yeah so you play with range of motion
you can play with tempo for those
modifications
listen to your body do what feels good
for you
that band when you take the squat make
sure you have plenty of tension on it
right so you get a little extra burn oh
my gosh
back is tall i want you to shoot those
hips to the back
there we go oh boy yes
oh my god i was like oh this is a quick
ko you know
this is a super fast easy effective
the band adds so much to it
keep it going five seconds on the clock
beautiful work give me one more just one
more this
is it amazing we're gonna do four ollie
shuffles and
four climbers are we ready and take note
that amanda is not using a band on this
round which is

go
four light on your feet three hands up
two abs tight
one let's bring it down four climbers
these are single
four drive those knees up to the chest
light on those feet here we go
now make sure you have plenty of tension
on the band when you do this typically
an ollie shuffle
your feet would be a little closer
together
and here we go here's four three
two let's bring it down i am loving this
dry three two one you feel it
so these workouts are great if you don't
have a lot of time and you still want to
get the heart rate up you want to get a
burn
or you can use this as the last one
you can use this as a burner to your
other workouts right so
if you say you did a full body knockout
this is it
this is it you can tack this on right
okay i can't believe i'm talking and
breathing at the same time okay we're
gonna finish off with a 30 second
forearm plank jack are we ready this is

using her band this time that's a
lighter resistance
you can find so many amazing bands right
these are our fabric like i said if you
have the rubber band that's perfect

more resistance
all right here we go and four three

up four
a little faster six seven
eight nine oh my gosh okay
we have to challenge ourselves we have
to challenge ourselves okay
let's go squat knee strike let's set it
up
here we go wait leg's a little wider
than his business part and squat
hands up strike power
if you can i know it's a little more
challenging with the bands which is
really fun
so the important thing about amanda
showing you
you can do it without the band maybe you
play with tempo like
for instance here maybe you can pick up
the pace
right so because this is low impact
so there's all certain ways that you can
do it perfect keep it going
sit back on those heels strike oh my
gosh
these are the saddest knee strikes i've
ever done in my life
20 seconds that's okay
i'm not judging this is a judgment free
zone right here
right i want you to do you
and enjoy yourself keep it going strike
it five seconds on the clock
yes two more give me one more this is it
last one right
oh yeah okay this is it we're done this
is why it's called a quick ko
that flew by right flew by okay so now
we're back to your four ollie shuffles
and your four climbers i like this one
yeah it
has my little boxing element okay some
tension on the band
show me that guard let's go you have
four three
two let's bring it down high plank you
have your four climbers
four three two one reset
and let's go for all these shovels hands
and guard
light on those feet bring it down climb
it
drive those knees up now i know we're
starting to feel fatigued
this is the perfect time for you to
check in
on your form and check in on your
technique
safety is much better than speed
so this is great make sure your toes are
pointed forward make sure your shoulders
are underneath your wrist make sure your
back is tall your abs are tight
i know it's a lot going on we're also
working wet your brain right
bring it down here's four three two
one oh my gosh i just remembered that we
still have a burnout
i just got really i'm gonna say i got
sad
i should say i got excited this is it
this is it
finish line here's the finish line this
is you you're right here
okay that's that's where we're at 30
seconds
for arm plank jack are you ready we got
this we got this let's go
all right let's set up on those elbows
you know how to modify
let's burn it out in three two one go
okay abs are pulled in head's neutral
with your spine
this is it you push play you should feel
so damn
good it's showing up right sometimes
you're showing up is the hardest part
then you get into it like oh my god you
feel so much better right
that's it and the more you show up i'm
telling you the easier these exercises
get
practice makes what it's perfect perfect
and progress
ready two and one oh my gosh
oh my gosh okay that was fantastic
you were amazing don't have bands
no problem if you don't have time push
play
this is a perfect way like we're
sweating our faces off
so you can do this on its own or tack it
on as a burnout to your other workouts
and i'll see you at your next sweat sesh
cheers
