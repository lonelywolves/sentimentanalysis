hi there thank you so much for joining
me my name is jessica
and i'm super excited to take you
through a 30-minute moving meditation
this session is brought to you by
athleta and the class itself was
inspired by the elation tights by
athleta which i'm wearing here right now
i love how smooth and buttery the fabric
texture is on my skin
and these leggings are really designed
to move with your body and they really
do
they hold you in like a warm hug without
being too compressive which makes them
really perfect for yoga practice like
today
what you can expect from this class
today is a gentle approach to some basic
yoga postures with an emphasis on
mindfulness
so we're going to get started in our
moving meditation
in a seat here today if you're
comfortable in a cross-legged seat go
ahead and find that but any seat that's
comfortable for you
is absolutely perfect and before we
begin moving we're just going to take a
minute
or two to kind of check in with our body
and
connect with our breath and get our body
and brain
on the same page for the movement for
the next half hour here
so find a comfortable seat sitting up
nice and tall
and we'll start to close the eyes here
or soften the gaze
if you prefer allowing the arms to rest
however they like maybe on your lap
and just take a moment here drawing your
awareness
inward noticing how the breath is moving
through you
without making any changes
and then let's notice how your muscles
are feeling how are the different parts
of the body feeling here
checking in noticing if there's anything
that we need to move with extra care
today
[Music]
and if it feels good to you here start
to deepen
the breath start to extend the
inhalation
try to extend that exhalation for as
long as you can just
gently extending the breath to make it a
little smoother
a little longer
and as you breathe as you expand the
inhalation soften the bellies off in the
body
really allow the body to open up to
receive that breath so extend the belly
out on the inhale
and on the exhale almost think of
drawing the navel in towards the spine
feel your body kind of sink back down
into the ground
few more breaths like this almost
finding a rhythm
or a cycle with that breath
and as we move today i want you to think
of this breath
as the backbone of your practice as long
as that breath is moving
freely within you you are practicing
perfectly
and i also want to take a moment here to
remind you that i am just a guide
i am illuminating a pathway for you
if there are any moves any postures that
we come into today that don't feel right
in your body
please please please do not feel
like you can't modify or take some
different options this is your practice
i'm just kind of showing you the way and
you can make this your own
so we'll come back into a couple more
deep breaths here before we move along
[Music]
very nice and let's take one last deep
breath together
with an audible exhale maybe bring the
hands onto the body
big inhale here
and exhale side out
very good releasing the hands down here
let's roll out the neck a little bit
let's just make some little circles here
maybe draw one ear down to one shoulder
and then the other side
and then we're going to start by
bringing the right hand down to the mat
and just extend the fingertips down to
the mat here and then we're going to
start to walk the fingertips
over and maybe this opposite hip is
going to want to float up
when you feel that happening right
before you feel that happening plant the
hand down
and we're going to reach up and over
with the opposite arm
so here i want you to think of keeping
that left hip or knee
press down into the ground rooted down
and we're going to press
out with the right hand so we're kind of
creating some resistance here in the
side body
reaching up and around and then let's
find a circle here
so finding some movement in the arm in
one direction and the other
very good come back to center walk your
hand back to center here and we'll find
that same
pose on the other side so left hand
starts to walk out here
find that spot where you feel like the
right hip or knee wants to start to lift
up
plant the hand down press the ground
away here
and we'll lift up and over gaze can come
up or down
staying connected to that breath and
maybe find some movement here
spiraling the arms one way and then the
other
and then inhale let's float both hands
up to center
reaching for the sky
exhale hands at heart center so palms
together
slide the hands down
very good
one last breath here we're going to
transition to hands and knees from here
so i'll meet you in a tabletop position
taking your time
and from this position we want to make
sure that our hips are stacked up over
our knees
and our shoulders are over
the wrists so we have some space in the
middle of the torso
upper body is working but not too much
tops of the feet are planted down into
the ground
and we're going to come into a dynamic
movement here
so we're coming into a modified plank
pose so we'll stay on the knees
and from there we're going to transition
into an extended child's pose
so coming into this we'll start with an
inhale
shifting the weight forward maybe coming
to the tops of the knees
engaging the core
and then on the exhale we're going to
press the body all the way back
sending the hips back towards the heel
extending through the arms
palms hugging down into the earth inhale
shift that weight forward
arms are strong wrap the elbows back
a little plank action here exhale shift
back
[Music]
inhale round through the spine shift
forward
tapping into that inner strength warming
up the body a little bit
exhale hips back to the heels
relax the forehead down
moving at your own pace we'll find two
more
keep that breath moving if you find
yours holding your breath you can always
come to a child's pose
and sit out the next pose if that feels
right you want to make sure you're
breathing and everything's working well
inhale shift forward and
exhale
hips back towards the heels forehead
coming down
let's take one more breath here
and we'll meet in tabletop position so
take your time
coming back to center drop the head and
the neck a little bit
and we're going to find our very first
downward facing dog here
so curl the toes under here
lifting the heels up curl the toes under
we're going to press our weight
into the hands again kind of like that
high plank but then we're going to
come up onto the balls of the feet and
send the weight back towards the heels
so on the inhale shift the weight
forward curl the toes under and we're
gonna
lift the knees up and shift that weight
back towards the heels
pressing the ground away and pressing
everything back
maybe you look back at your feet and
align the heels behind the toes
maybe you find some movement here so
bending one knee
and then the other
[Music]
staying connected with that breath
round breath
and inhale bend through the knees
step the feet wide and out and we're
going to find our way into a forward
fold nice and slow
from here let's come all the way up to
upward salute
step the feet in together inhale we arms
up
exhale we're going to come into a fold
bend through the knees
head chest come down
[Music]
halfway lift on the inhale so the spine
is nice and long
shoulders move away from the ears exhale
fold
inhale lift all the way up so swoop the
arms back
ah bend into the knees lift all the way
up here
[Music]
and exhale hands to heart center
close the eyes here
and we'll take a step towards the front
of the mat if you're not already there
and let's let's just take a few moments
here tuning into that breath
feeling the body so we've moved just a
little bit but we've woken up
the legs the spine a little bit beside
body
the arms you should be feeling your uh
triceps and biceps here
so in all of that movement
even though it was minimal you feel you
feel yourself
warming up a little bit opening up to
the practice
really close your eyes here and just
tune in to the sensations in your body
what is the first thing that you feel do
you feel
your calves you feel the triceps of the
biceps
just connecting with that sensation
and recognize that as strength and
power your body is amazing just the way
it is
right now so just kind of like taking a
moment to feel that
to feel that truth to make it your truth
if you don't feel it yet
breathing into that energy for just a
moment
and we'll drop our arms to our sides
blink the eyes open
and let's get into our standing sequence
so stepping a little bit closer towards
the front of the mat
we're gonna step into a warrior two
so taking your time right footsteps back
nice big step back and we want the knife
edge of that back foot to be parallel
with the short edge of the mat that
front knee is going to bend
it doesn't have to bend a whole lot just
so that you can feel it in the thigh
here
and we're going to open the arms up to a
t so spreading
the palms away from each other
fingertips are active
really sitting into that front thigh
back knee is lifted you are a strong
fierce warrior gays comes over the
middle finger
in the front
[Music]
one more breath here
exhale hold it and on the inhale we're
going to lengthen through that front leg
flip the palms up touch the hands at the
top here legs are strong
exhale warrior two flip the palms out
sit back into that warrior two let's
find that sequence a few more times
so inhale pressing into that front heel
fingertips reach
up exhale finding your warrior two again
flipping the palms
out inhale reaching up
and exhale settling a little bit deeper
into your warrior two
one more time inhale reaching up
and exhale fierce
warrior energy look over that middle
finger
[Music]
hands come to the waist here relaxing
the arms a little bit
and we're going to find this on the
other side by pivoting to the opposite
side of the mat
so front foot becomes the back foot
pivot on the heel
back foot becomes the front foot find
your warrior two
bend into that knee bring the arms out
when you're ready
we'll take three breaths here
really rooting down through that front
foot back leg is strong
on the next inhale we'll straighten
through that front leg and reach up
exhale warrior two
inhale reach up
exhale warrior two if you feel the
muscles in your legs
moving or quivering or dancing
that is perfect you
are amazing and your body is working on
your behalf
we honor every sensation through this
practice
even the ones that are difficult
one more here
holding that warrior that gaze comes out
over the middle finger
hands to the waist let's pivot the feet
back to center
and we're going to step in shake out the
legs a little bit here
[Music]
closing the eyes hands to heart center
taking a few breaths here just kind of
connecting again with the body
checking in and taking a moment here
just to notice
if you have any intrusive thoughts
coming through your mind here
taking a moment to kind of recognize
them
and choosing
to disengage from those negative
thoughts our power
is not in what we can control
it's what we choose to breathe life into
what thoughts
we choose to engage and today we're
focusing on
loving the person we showed up as today
finding
something that we're grateful for and
really celebrating ourselves because
today as we are
we're perfect we're exactly as we're
meant to be
in this very moment and we're absolutely
worthy
of being honored and celebrated
[Music]
dropping the hands here blinking the
eyes back open
we're gonna find that warrior two again
when you're ready
mix that back with that right foot
finding that warrior two again so
bringing the arms out
relaxing the shoulders down and really
spreading the hands away from each other
so taking a breath here
and on the exhale we're gonna find
extended side angle so this front arm is
gonna come to rest on the top of the
front thigh here
and we're gonna flip the back palm up
and
reach all the way up and if you're
feeling like a rock star
you can reach all the way forward and
we're using the core here we're keeping
everything kind of lifted
out of the knee it's there for support
but we're not leaning into it too much
because we are amazingly strong and
capable here
and now back to warrior two pressing
through that front heel
and exhale reverse warrior so front palm
flips up
back hand comes to back thigh or you can
just kind of
bend the arm behind the low back and
we're reaching back
we're staying committed to the bend in
the front knee
and we're finding warrior two again here
yes
let's find that one more time inhale
extended side angle
exhale warrior two
reverse
back to warrior two here and we're gonna
find it on the other side so again hands
to the waist
switch perspectives here find that
warrior two
arms come open here
gaze comes over the front middle finger
drop the shoulders away from the face
yeah inhale extended side angle
[Music]
exhale warrior two
inhale reverse
front knee stays bended inhale warrior
two
exhale extended side angle you've got
this
you can do it and how are you too
exhale reaching up
and inhale warrior two here holding this
for just a few more breaths
staying bent in that front knee
hands to the waist pivot the toes
forward and we'll step to the front of
the mat
one or two steps shake out the legs here
shake out the shoulders
[Music]
drop the head close the eyes we'll take
another quick moment here
hands at heart center
[Music]
checking in with the breath checking in
with the body
and noticing again how your thoughts are
fluctuating
we talked earlier about your power
really being in what you choose to
breathe life into
which thoughts you engage and that kind
of goes
across the board not just with you know
self-love
and self-acceptance but in regards to
any thoughts that cross your mind so if
you're having a hard time staying
focused here
if you notice that something is
preoccupying your mind
maybe it's something you have to do
later on today
or something that already happened just
pretend you're sitting in a park and
you're looking at this blue sky
and each one of these thoughts that
comes through
trying to grab your attention trying to
pull you away from the present moment is
a bright balloon and you can either
try reaching for that balloon maybe
you'll grab it maybe you won't
or you can just watch it float away
until it disappears
and we can think of our thoughts that
way too
especially negative ones we don't want
to engage them
we can just notice that they come
through our mind
and that almost as quickly as they came
through
they're gone so that is my tip for you
when practicing mindfulness so take
another breath just kind of
thinking about that thought for just a
moment
before we move on here
release the hands down to your side if
you haven't already
and we're going to draw our arms up for
upward salute
so bend through the knees lift up here
arms are active
fingertips are reaching for the sky
exhale fold bend through the knees again
hinging at the hips draw the arms down
maybe the hands come to the ground
maybe they're on the shins or the knees
drop the head down maybe
roll it from side to side taking a few
more breaths here
bringing your hands to the backs of the
legs wherever they
reach naturally and while staying in
this fold i just want to
tune in to the sheer strength and the
power of the body the things that
sometimes we take for granted
just kind of gently squeeze the calves
maybe grab the ankles or you know notice
the hamstrings you want to feel those
muscles
how hard they're working and find some
awareness of how magical your body is
all of these things that it's doing for
you to support you
to support your joy to support your
movement
just finding little ways to recognize
how amazing you are
as you are today
halfway lift on the next inhale so
pull that chest long spine as long gaze
is down
crown is pointing straight ahead exhale
slide the hands down the legs
plant the hands down onto the mat we'll
find downward facing dog
so a little bend in the knees here and
then step one foot back and then the
other
shifting the weight back towards the
heels
drop that head down
[Music]
and really you can find whatever
movement feels good here
so if you want to lift one leg and roll
out the ankle
you can find that if you want to be
completely still or just come down onto
the knees here
you can find that remember there's no
wrong way to practice
you're moving meditation as long as you
are breathing
and from here we're going to gently come
on to our knees
so slowly make your way down
and we're going to come on to our back
from here so take your time
coming on to your back
and we'll find bit knees here
so taking up the space that you need
allowing the shoulders to really relax
down into the ground
soles of the feet are firmly planted
down
about hip width distance apart and we're
gonna find
just having windshield wiper leg here
just to kind of stretch out
the quads a little bit from the warrior
series
so feet again hip width distance apart
bring the arms out palms of the hands
down
now we're just gonna drop the knees from
one side to the other
and if you don't feel a whole lot in
your quads here as you drop your knees
think of drawing the heels a little bit
closer to the body
sometimes that creates just the right
amount of tension
and we're just going to move through
those at your own pace move with your
breath here
or if you want to hold it for a few
breaths that's all good
find what works for you here
[Music]
and we come back into noticing the
breath
now that we've found ourselves back on
the ground here
noticing the breath noticing the body
and take a moment to
understand different ways
that you can show up for yourself
is there any way that you are avoiding
things in your life or holding off on
things
because you're waiting for an ideal
version of yourself to magically appear
and if that's the case i think a lot of
us can relate to that in one way or the
other
if that's the case think about one thing
here that you can take away
from this practice that's going to help
you to show up for yourself and to
really appreciate
every version of yourself that shows up
every single day
no matter what journey you're on every
version
you wake up as is equally
deserving of admiration celebration
whether you're in the beginning of your
journey end of it in the middle of it
every day is worth celebrating
so from here we'll find our final
shavasana
so we can stay in this position or if we
like we can draw our legs
long in front of us to find the
traditional posture
there's no wrong way to practice this
find your comfort here
and once you settle in maybe ask
yourself if there's anything you can do
to make yourself
a little more comfortable for just a
little bit of an adjustment
we're looking for ultimate relaxation
here
so if you're still holding that deep
breath start to ease out of it
and allow your body to find its natural
rhythm of breath again
your mouth to part open if that feels
good here
[Music]
[Music]
allowing the eyes to rest softly in
their sockets
allow your feet to roll out
allow yourself to just be in the most
natural state your body wants to be in
here
for your last exercise of this
session i want you to take
the corner of each side of your mouth
and and curl them up
smile asana
give yourself a smile here
and maybe even a hug drawing the arms
into the body and give yourself a little
love
a little appreciation for showing up to
try this practice
for trusting me trusting yourself
[Music]
then we'll release the arms and we'll
take a few more moments
in our shavasana
[Music]
this concludes our class together i want
to thank you all for joining me
for showing up for moving as you are and
for trusting me to lead you through this
practice
and i also want to give a special shout
out to athleta
these elation tights really held me down
and made me feel so supported during
this class
and it almost felt like i wasn't wearing
any pants at all
so thank you so much athleta and thank
you to you
see you next time
