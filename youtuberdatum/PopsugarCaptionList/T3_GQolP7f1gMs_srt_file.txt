our workout today we're gonna have such
a good time
today is a lower body bar boot camp so
bar boot camp is a method that i created
oh my gosh
probably eight years ago now which is
crazy and it really takes some of the
fundamentals of a traditional bar class
but intensifies and brings in a little
bit more of your
standard boot camp strength endurance so
that you get the optimal workout in a
short amount of time i'm all about fast
fun and effective workouts
and that is what this one's going to be
so a lot of times in my bar boot camps
we're using weights
we're adding in booty bands or
resistance bands which you can
absolutely do but today
i'm going to be doing the whole workout
no equipment
so i'll cue you if you have dumbbells at
home that you want to pick up during
some of the exercises that we're doing
by all means grab them weights always
add that bit of resistance
help you build muscle which in turn
helps you build more excess fat
and just get stronger and feel better
every single day so if you have them
grab them
if not you and me we're going just body
weight this entire time
we're going to start with a warm up and
then we're going to get right into it so
if you are ready
start on your mat in just a few moments
we'll get started

minute to let everyone get in here but i
wanted to come on a little early and say
hello
introduce myself give you guys a bit of
background on me if you haven't done a
workout with me here on pop sugar
or on love sweat fitness before welcome
i'm so excited to get to sweat it out
with you today
you'll notice i don't have any shoes on
um you don't really need shoes for this
workout especially because we're not
using
equipment um if you're ever picking up
heavy weights or anything of course you
want to keep those toes protected
but in our bar it's a little bit more um
gentle in some ways if you will so you
can totally just go
without shoes if you want sometimes i'll
use grippy socks but i have
my love sweat fitness dual sided yoga
mat so one side
is a little bit more grippy for things
like yoga that's this side here
the other side is ready for you to get
jumping on with your shoes but since
we're
going no shoes i'm going to use this
grippy side so that
my feet don't slide when we go into our
wide grand plays
because i get really sweaty all right
you guys ready to get into it
let's bring those feet out wide heels
and toes out
it's a wednesday i love doing live
workouts on wednesdays because
the middle of the week i feel like this
is that time we could all use a little
extra support
a little extra motivation to get us over
that hump
just side to side
i want you to breathe and if you haven't
had a chance just to really breathe yet

with a few more
smaller toning moves and then hit
a little bit more cardio then we'll be

i know that lower body is like right now
all right so what we're going to do to

[Music]
dance break if you're not doing anything
[Music]
hit a little abs now we're coming up on
our time
and then we'll cool down together all
right
so we're going to start like this think
of a big lunge
you're going to get low in that lunge
we're going to start with a pulse in the
lunge
we'll eventually lunge and open to a
grind
your arms can be outside yourself
i don't care where your arms are just
about our lower body
so starting in that pulse
[Music]
your belly button pulls in toward the
spine
posture tall shoulders back and down
lock those legs in your back pocket
eight
seven six five
four three two and hold
knee lunge squat
[Music]
squats
if you have really sensitive knees or
any knee injuries
this isn't for you i want you to pick
one and do it or come back to those
bridges
okay or just work your hamstrings here
not twisting with control
if you need to go slow up then
pivot into the squat that's fine down
up down up
find where you want to be i always want
to give you
options levels modifications
for where you are at so you never feel
like you can't do something you never
feel like a workout isn't for you
maybe a workout super challenging that
you can find a way
to join in and give it your all your 100
whatever that looks like it's not going
to necessarily look like mine
and guess what my 100 looks different
every day too
some days crush it i can do it all
others i'm like
nope i'm about to score
[Music]
that's what unites us what makes us all
the same is we're all just showing up
doing our best
last two last one on the side
pivot pull it down
[Music]
squeeze
eight seven six
five four three
two hold we lunge
walk for example
my butt and my legs are real tired and
the squat
is like oh unless i feel like i'm like
i got this right now what
you feel the extra hard but i'm going to
keep moving
maybe i don't go as feet every single
time that's okay
i'm picking where i know i can push
harder
in that lunge i can get deeper
[Music]
good
almost there you guys
[Music]
eight
[Music]
seven
six the good news is
the good news is when you work your
lower body
you burn more calories you build more
muscle
because we're working these big muscles
your glutes are your three largest
muscles in the body
we have this giant mask working for us
last one shake it out
[Music]
i know about you but wow but
i feel like you feel me though right
on the back
i promised one more little bit of pour
here
i know i said we take one more cardio
burst but you know what
i feel like your lower body is probably
good for today
we haven't doubled up during our first
one
bring those knees wide bring the
[Music]
shoulders
check back into what i was saying if you
want to keep a space between your chin
and your chest like you're holding an
apple so there's space there but your
neck is not
extended with you looking behind you you
look straight up toward the sky
as you bring your hands behind your head
you're going to feel your rib cage
butterfly open i want you to pull it
together
zip it up draw the belly button toward
the spine
you're going to lift your shoulders off
the mat and we're going to start just
with a pulse toward the sky we lift
lift draw that belly button down toward
the floor
breathe little exhales
you got this
[Music]
just eight more pulses seven six
five listen for the change we're gonna
take a butterfly reverse crunch
so you lower your shoulders exhale lift
your knees and elbows come to knee your
feet stay together
and then you extend your legs up toward
the sky
yes and then we open necking lowers in
and up down and out
and up if this is too much of the upper
body bring your hands under your
tailbone
and mimic the legs
so those knees open feet touch knees
together
lift the hips overhead yes eight
let's go seven
six five
[Music]
four three
two one exhale
full body stretch reach overhead
roll onto that belly
exhale let it go
push the mat away lift your chest
you guys are so lucky you're not
finishing with burpees
i finished most bar boot camps with
burpees
but not today friends not today stretch
it out
and not just burpees you guys we make it
fun like grand plays all the things
because that's my goal fast fun
effective
right we don't have hours we don't need
a gym
put those hips back think of anything
if we've been taught whatever if we've
learned anything this year
it's that our bodies are so freaking
capable
they're so strong they work so hard
if we show up they'll do the work
they really will you don't need a lot
my gym my gym my mat
my sliders my lsf2 bands elsa sliders
like
booty bands i do use weights
some dumbbells but that's it and you
don't really need a lot
you don't even need those if you have
two bands like these
you can double up intensify our bodies
are so strong
you are so strong it's really about
checking in showing up and doing what
you can do
in each moment giving yourself grace
knowing that our bodies are changing
constantly
i know we're probably all women here
right now our hormones are changing
constantly
our energy levels we have to continue to
really
check in be in tune with our bodies and
give them what they need in each moment
know when we can challenge ourselves and
know the difference between a challenge
and something that is pushing us past
our limits that becomes like dangerous
that'll put us out for a couple weeks or
a couple days
that was my struggle for years right i
would go through these intense programs
and get
totally burnt out because i was going
too hard
too much it's not my brothers aren't
made to do that long term
it doesn't make sense so fast fun
effective
but i always want to bring you all hope
you hopefully
