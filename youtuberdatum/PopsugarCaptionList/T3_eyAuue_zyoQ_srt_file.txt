[Music]
hi welcome to the new class fit sugar
i'm charlie atkins and i'll be leading
you through a
full body strength training workout that
includes my favorite intermediate
exercises
this session is sponsored by under
armour shop my look
in the caption below i'll be using a
pair of medium dumbbells if you have a
pair at home
grab them now and let's get to work
let's start
just by simply coming into these bounces
now all we're doing in this warm-up
exercise is making sure that our ankles
are ready to go
for today's strength workout you can
chug your shoulders if you feel like
loosening them up
just adding a little bit of movement
starting to get the blood flow for our
warm up here
we'll stay here for about another 10
seconds and then we're going to do two
more warm-up exercises
before we fully head into our set of
strength exercises for the day
from here i just want you to come to the
back of your mat keep your hips high
all you're going to do is walk yourself
out to a high plank position
and then you're going to reach reach
keep the tailbone reaching towards the
sky
stand upright if you feel like you have
tight hamstrings you can always bend the
knees a little bit more
but you are reaching out in this high
point coming right back
standing all the way up hinging at the
hips walking yourself out
pausing in that high plank position
before coming all the way back up to
standing
one thing i want you to be aware of is
make sure that your fingertips are
pointing forward and not
out as you do this high plank
or this inchworm i should say hips stay
high walking yourself out fingertips
repeated forward
you're in that high plank position feet
are slightly wider than hip just
apart trying not to let the body rotate
let's do one more
now what you'll notice is that from your
high plain position you should be able
to shift the lips up
to a downward facing dog go ahead and
bend the knees push the tailbone to the
sky
really press the hands into the mat and
then all i want you to do is lift one
heel up to the sky
and then the other so just doing a down
dog with a leg lift
alternating legs if you notice my
toes are not pointed my feet are flexed
i want you to do the same thing reaching
the heel to the sky
not the toe and you should feel a little
bit more activation throughout the glute
let's go ahead and do two more on each
leg that's four total
one more here and then coming on
up to standing we're gonna move into our
marches so i like to call them goblet
marches because if you do have a heavier
weight
or a kettlebell you really want to hold
it in that goblet position
so i'm going to zip my two dumbbells
together hug them tight to my chest
elbows are in tight to the ribs
almost like you have two pieces of paper
underneath your armpits and you're
locking those papers in
and then you're just going to march
you're bringing one knee up
placing the foot right back down
alternating legs so what you're trying
to do
is strengthen your glutes and your hips
allowing you to stand
on one leg as you lift one knee up
towards the chest
if you do have a heavy weight your goal
is to make sure that you keep a straight
line from your head all the way down to
your standing heel
and then all you're doing is just
marching so a great core exercise
as well as a hip stability exercise you
could look at this
as a warm-up exercise in addition to a
core strengthening exercise
go ahead and give me four total two on
each leg and then we're going to head
into our half kneeling overhead press so
come on down to the mat half kneeling
position
and the knee that's down is the arm
that's pressing
in this half kneeling position all
you're going to do is press the weight
up overhead
now the reason why we do our overhead
presses in the hockey league position
is because if this is an upper body
exercise
we want to eliminate the lower body the
knee and the ankle joints
that we have a more stable core to be
able to press weights up overhead
now if you are using light weights what
you can do is you can double up your
weights
meaning if you have two five pound
dumbbells try double lapping them
into one arm and you can press them up
overhead pull them right back down go
ahead and give me two more reps
and then we're going to switch over onto
the opposite side here we go
so what i mean by double lapping or
doubling up you just add both of the
dumbbells into one hand
or if you want to stick with the heavy
or the intermediate weight that you have
just go ahead and use one dumbbell
pressing up overhead now when you are
doing that overhead press see if you can
get your bicep to cover your ear
fire up the glue of the half kneeling
position you want to make sure your hips
are in a stable position
and you're just pressing up overhead
and bringing the arm right back down
less than 10 seconds let's go see if you
can give me three or four more reps i'm
gonna go three
two and then one from there we're going
to come into a high plank position
we're gonna be doing plank spiders now i
like to put the heels in my hands on top
of my dumbbells
that way i have a nice stable surface it
feels better on my wrist
and then all we're doing in these plank
spiders targeting the core
also working the arms is you're bringing
the knee up and over a fire hydrant
towards the armpit
what i don't want you to do is rotate
the body so you're trying to keep the
shoulders and the hips
square towards the mat add in a breath
exhale every time that knee comes up
think about keeping
a straight line from the head all the
way down to the heels
good give me one more on each leg and
then let's come back
up to standing and we're going to do
those marches again so zipping your
dumbbells together if you're using
a lighter or a medium set of dumbbells
hugging the dumbbells in tight to the
chest
pretending that you have two pieces of
paper underneath each one of your
armpits
and then all you're doing is marching
strengthening your glutes
working on your core
and then on that standing leg really
press that foot down into the ground try
to think about reaching the crown of
your head
taller towards the sky if you also
notice in these marches my toe
is pulled towards my shin meaning my
foot is flexed
and my toe is not pointed so you want to
flex the foot
i'm going to give me one more on each
side and then let's go ahead and come
back down to that
half kneeling position the knee that's
down is the arm that's
up back toes tucked under meaning no
shoe laces down on the ground
toes tucked under pressing up to the sky
lowering right back down
pressing up and if you are using a
lighter set of weights trick of the
trade
think about dragging your elbow against
the wall
as you pull the weight down
dragging your elbow against the wall as
you pull the arm down that's going to
help you create this
tense sensation creating a little bit of
resistance
in your overhead press that is if you
are using a lighter set of weights
good let's go ahead and switch sides
back toe is tucked under the knee that's
down is the arm that's pressing
here we go
trying to see if you can get your bicep
to cover your ear as you press
overhead and if you notice my palm is
spacing slightly
forward maybe at like a 45 degree angle
putting my shoulder in a safe position
as i do these overhead presses
we've got about 15 seconds left to go
really focusing on what the core is
doing
make sure that the only thing that's
moving is that arm
good let's get three more together
here's three give me two more reps and
then we're gonna head right back into
those plank spiders
working the arms and core a little bit
more
if you'd like to you can elevate the
heels of your hands on top of your
dumbbells
if you are unable to do that just go
ahead and put your hands down in that
high plank position now one of the most
common errors
that i see in these plank spiders is
that people's hips are a little too high
so i really want to make sure that you
have that straight line
from the head all the way to the heels
if you want to make it even more
challenging on yourself take a micro
bend in the elbows
shift the weight forward and you're
going to feel that even more in your
core
give me two more on each leg that's four
total we've got four
three two come on one
and then go ahead and come on up
standing heading into our next set of
exercises
so we are going to be working on the
booty we're going to be doing some hinge
movements
starting with our kickstand deadlift so
go ahead and hold on to both of your
weights
all i want you to do is kick your foot
out to the side kick the heel back and
that's going to give you the perfect
position for your kickstand deadlift
also known as a staggered deadlift
take both of your dumbbells and then
you're just going to paint the front of
your shin
lowering down by pressing the tailbone
back and then stepping up
or standing up by stepping through that
standing leg
so you are targeting the hamstrings and
the glutes
so really think about pressing the hips
back and then driving through your
standing leg trying to get your
shoulders stacked over your hips
in that upright position now if this is
too easy for you and you want a little
bit more
you could turn it into a single leg
deadlift simply by letting that back leg
apply
however sometimes i find that the
kickstand deadlift is a better option
for me than the single leg deadlift
let's go ahead and switch sides so if
you want to set it up you can
zip your foot out to the side take the
heel back and then
shifting the tailbone back straight line
from the head all the way to the
tailbone
standing up straight you're in that
upright position
targeting your hamstring in your booty
hamstrings i should say plural three of
them
shifting hips back coming all the way up
now we've got about 10 seconds left here
really standing up straight through that
standing leg
keeping the hips and the glutes firing
as you move up and down from there let's
go ahead and head into our plank rows
we're going to be starting in a high
plank position again if you want to
elevate
the heel of one of your hands on your
other dumbbell you can
otherwise the wider your feet are the
more stability you're going to have
and then all i want you to do is pull
elbow to the sky
wrist to the rib keeping a straight line
all the way from the head
to the hips now if this is a little bit
challenging for you all you can do is
drop the opposite knee and you're still
doing the single arm
plank row so targeting the core and the
back muscles
go ahead and give me three more on this
arm
and then we're going to switch over onto
the opposite side
so you can start in this high point
position elbow to the sky
rest of the rib if this is a little bit
challenging for you go ahead and drop
the opposite knee
as long as your shoulders and your hips
are staying square to the mat
using your exhales and every single one
of your reps breathing out
thinking about spreading open the chest
keeping the shoulder out of the ear
elbow to the sky wrist to the rim
[Music]
go ahead and give me two more reps on
this side and then we're going to come
on
down to our backs for a leg lower
exercise
lower abs as well as hip mobility so
lying on your back
go ahead and press your feet up towards
the sky press your dumbbells up towards
the sky
and then reaching your heel as far away
from the body as possible
you're gonna lower one leg down and then
the other
now if you find this exercise super
challenging you can drop the elbows down
to the mat almost like you're doing a
chest press
or you can lose the dumbbells altogether
most advanced or most challenging
position would be to punch this guy with
these dumbbells
reach the heel as far away from the body
as possible as you're lowering that
down punching it right back up go ahead
and give me
two more reps one on each side then
let's go ahead and come on up to
standing
right back to that kickstand deadlift
you are going to set yourself up for
your kickstand deadlift shifting hips
back
driving through that standing leg
upright
if you want to make a little bit more
challenging this go around you can turn
it into a single leg deadlift
it does require a little bit more
balance keeping a straight line from
your head
all the way to your back heel
standing upright really pressing
your foot of the standing leg down into
the ground go ahead and give me one more
rep on this leg
and then we'll switch sides so if you
want to start with the kickstand
you can however if you are looking
to challenge yourself you can always
turn it into a single leg deadlift
straight line from the head all the way
to the back heel toe is pulled towards
the shin
painting the front of the shin with your
dumbbells
[Music]
standing upright good see if you can
give me three more reps
two
and last one and then let's head down to
the map for those plank ropes
so in a plank row if you would like to
set your hands up on top of your
dumbbells you can
but all we're going to be doing is a
single arm plank row so i'm just pulling
elbow to the sky
wrist to the room now if you notice my
feet are wider than my mat
straight line from my head all the way
to my heels and then all i'm doing is
pulling elbow to the sky
wrists of the rib if you find this too
challenging you can simply drop your
opposite knee
take a little bit wider stance with the
extended leg and then
try not to let your body rotate so you
don't want to open up your shoulders and
you don't want to open up your hips
let's get four more reps together here
three
two and then we're going to go ahead and
switch sides
so if you want to do the full high plank
you can so
not having one knee down just pulling
elbow to the sky wrists of the rib
[Music]
or if you find it a little bit more
balanced and stable
you can always drop that opposite knee
down elbow to the sky
wrists of the rib if you'd like you can
pause at the top
for a quick exhale before lowering down
to finish up your reps
less than 10 seconds left to go let's
try to get four more together here's
four three two go ahead and give me one
more
awesome and then go ahead and come down
onto your back we're gonna be doing
leg lowers so lying on your back
go ahead and press the dumbbells right
over the middle of the chest
and then you're lowering one heel down
and then the other trying to keep your
leg as straight as possible
so a good way to help keep this leg
straight is simply by reaching the heel
as far away from the body as possible
if punching the weights up over the
chest is a little challenging you can
always bend the elbows
otherwise we've got about 10 seconds
left to go stay with me here
[Music]
good go ahead give me four total that's
two on each leg
last two last one
good and then let's go ahead and move
into our final set of exercises
one of them has weights the other two
are body weight first exercise
is going to be a reverse lunge plus a
row
so in your reverse lunge you're stepping
back back knee kisses the ground hovers
just above the ground
and then you're gonna pull for your row
and you're just gonna stay on that one
side
so straight line from the head all the
way to the tailbone if you notice i have
a slight
forward lean just activating the glute a
little bit more
trying to let my back knee kiss the
ground as i pull those elbows behind me
for that row
use your breath to help you with the row
stepping back back knee
kisses the ground or hovers just above
it
spreading open the chest as you row and
then letting your gaze
follow the movement so if you notice my
gaze follows
the movement of my spine instead of
always looking up
i'm looking slightly down go ahead and
give me one more on this side
[Music]
and then let's go ahead and switch legs
so coming into your reverse lunge back
knee kisses the ground or hovers just
above it
you're gonna pull spread the chest
coming into that double arm row
[Music]
stepping back and then now remember in
these reverse lunge plus a row the
working leg
is the front leg so you really want to
step yourself up standing
through that front leg
starting to add up
[Music]
stay strong we've got this
[Music]
keeping the elbows in tight to the ribs
you've got less than 10 seconds left to
go see if you can give me two more reps
good one more and then go ahead and put
your weights off to the side we're gonna
be doing some seal jacks just to bring
the heart rate up if it isn't already
all you're doing is thinking about
opening up a barn door
and then you're popping in and out now
popping is a little bit too much for you
you can always just have super active
arms
tapping one foot and then the other
or if you are going full seal jack with
me hopping
in and out good we've got about 15
seconds left here
remember you want super active arms
think about using your back muscles to
open up your chest
good less than 10 seconds give me ten
nine eight seven six
five come on four three more two and
then one and then coming down into the
mat we're going to be doing push-up
breeches so in these push-up breeches
i want you to lower all the way down to
the mat reach in front of you
pull push lower down reach
pull push so if you are doing these
from your knees i really want you to
challenge yourself
to lift yourself off the mat in a
straight line
so that you're doing it from your toes
this exercise
is going to train you to stop doing
push-ups from your knees
you're finally going to build up all
that strength to be able to do these
full push-ups
from the toes give me one more
[Music]
good coming out of standing
[Music]
and then let's head into these reverse
lunges plus
a row stepping back pull
step up through that standing leg or
that front leg letting the gaze
follow the movement of the spine
[Music]
this is our final round of exercises so
stick with me here
[Music]
good yourself getting stronger with each
rep
[Music]
now remember if you are using a heavier
set of dumbbells
you're not going to get as many reps but
you are going to be a little bit more
challenged simply by having a heavier
load
see if you can give me two more reps
this is one
two oh good and then let's go ahead and
switch sides now if you notice that the
row is too much
you can always just do the reverse lunge
however by holding this isolation at the
bottom
you're just turning it into that much
more of a challenging lower body
exercise
step back back knee kisses the ground
hovers just above the mat
good don't forget to breathe
i like to really use my exhales to help
me get through
the hardest part of these exercises so
breathe out
as you're rolling standing up tell me
got less than 10 seconds left to go can
you give me two more reps here's one
[Music]
and then here's two and then put your
weights off to the side
we're gonna head right back into those
seal jacks remember you're just peeling
open
a barn door and you're hopping the
internet modification if you need it
you're just stepping
one foot and then the other good
so we're here for about 30-ish seconds
your whole goal is to keep the heart
rate elevated
to keep yourself active and moving
let's do 10 more together this is 10 9
8 7 6 5
three two and then one from there let's
head down to the mat
last exercise we're gonna be doing these
push-up breeches here we go
straight line from the head to the heel
lower all the way down reach
pull push so really think about
firing up your glutes and your core to
get you up off the mat
put the thumbs right underneath the
armpits elbows are pointed back at a 45
degree angle
good really building that core and upper
body strength
reach pull oh push
these are getting challenging
[Music]
good stay strong we're almost there
we've got less than 10 seconds give me
three more
you've got it we've got three two
oh come on last one
[Music]
and then from there go ahead and move
into a downward face
dog bend the knees push the tail into
the sky that should feel really good on
the hips and the chest maybe even the
shoulder
area
there you have it so that was our 20
minute strength set
just like we did in the beginning go
ahead and lift one heel up to the sky
and then the other we'll do four
total two on each leg
and then we're gonna move into a pigeon
so lift your right leg up to the sky
and then all you're gonna do is pull
your right knee towards your right wrist
right foot towards the left side of the
mat sit yourself up nice and tall so
that your chest is facing forward
take a deep breath in and then as you
exhale if you'd like you can slowly
start to walk yourself down
resting on the elbows
so really focusing on the breath here
allowing yourself to cool down
take inhales through the nose and then
exhale out the mouth
now in pigeon a good way to kind of take
this into a deeper stretch is to
press the shin down into the mat for
about five seconds and then relax
and that's going to make sure that your
hips are square and you should settle
into what might feel like a deeper
stretch go ahead and give me three more
breaths inhale through the nose
exhale out the mouth
deep breath in letting it go
and then as you take that final breath
go ahead and walk yourself up we're
going to come back to our downward
facing dog
your right leg might feel a little bit
cramped so you can shake it out
you can take the knee through a circle
otherwise when you're ready left foot
lifts up towards the sky
left knee towards left wrist left foot
over on the right side of the mat
sit yourself up nice and tall and then
when you're ready you can walk yourself
out you can rest on your elbows
or if it feels more comfortable to leave
yourself up in this elevated position
you can do that
you can use the same trick that we did
in that last exercise simply by pressing
the shin down into the mat it's going to
help you
square your hips off i'll take about
five breaths here
so allowing the exhales to cool you down
from that workout
now this workout is designed so that you
can keep repeating it so if this is
something that you would like to
incorporate into your daily routine
you can do this video three to four
times a week if you have time for it
it's definitely gonna help you
build up strength to kind of take you to
that next level
take one more deep breath in and then
as you exhale walk yourself up shift
your weight onto
one hip and then you're just gonna swing
the legs forward we're gonna target the
hamstrings here
so sitting up nice and tall you can
reach the arms up overhead
and then all you're gonna do is forward
fold reaching for the toes
if you can't touch the toes you can go
ahead and hold on to the shins
let the shoulders relax away from the
ears and then you're just forward
folding down
[Music]
go ahead and bring the hands down into
the mat walk yourself
up and then come on up to standing thank
you so much for sweating with me and
under armour again my name is trey
atkins and i hope to see you at another
class fit sugar workout soon
