this
so as you get a second get that air back
in those lungs
i've got four complete circuits for you

but we are going to focus on
explosiveness and power
just as usain bolt would train all right
for our first circuit

bring it right back
there you go nice and simple 40 seconds
of work
let's hit it three two one jumping out
further bring it right back good stuff

as deep as possible okay
40 seconds of work here it is movement
number one let's start in three

all right guys you have just completed
three circuits of
real explosive movement congratulations
but we do have one final circuit to get
done
and we're gonna focus in on our core so
you're gonna come follow me down to your
mats
first movement and we do have four core
exercises
is gonna be a reverse crunch so i want
you on your bottom
knees in you're going to leverage out
extend your feet
then drive your knees to your chest okay
we do have 30 seconds they're about of
work
four movements let's start with this
reverse crunch here we go let's go three
two one extend out drive it in
there you go so this here is my tempo if
you want to move a little faster
by all means you can slow it down
do that whatever feels good for you
looks good guys we're hitting halfway
right here again extend all the way
drive those knees to the chest
looks good here we go here we go in our
last
six seconds come on pull tight core
tight
in three two one looks good
saying seated on the mat i'm gonna have
you lie down
movement number two we're gonna do
alternating sit up claps
nice and simple hands behind the head
sitting up clapping under the kneecaps
then hit
the opposite side all right 30 seconds
on the clock
let's start this in three two
one clapping up there we go come on
opposite side
looks good guys looks good there we go
this one should be fun
a nice strong core is the foundation of
all movement
so we can never neglect working out our
midsection
guys you got about 10 seconds left here
good here it is here it is counting you
down
from five four three
two and one all right movement number
three our leg raise a nice classic one
usain bolt's favorite i hear here's what
i want you to do
lay down you can choose to put your
hands to your side
or create a little diamond section and
put it to the lower part of your back
for a little bit more support feet up
above
have them starting above your hips
lowering down nice and controlled
drive them back up okay you want to aim
to get those heels close to the ground
without hitting the ground
make sense of course it does guys 30
seconds on the clock let's go in three
two one lower pull tight
bring him right back beautiful
again find a pace that works for you
something that your body agrees with
again challenging the call here
doing so good i know this workout
can be a little intense but you really
hung in there
i'm so proud of you come on we've got
one more and bring it back good stuff
lovely that was your leg raise last and
final
the fourth movement of our core
exercises is a three count
mountain climb so very similar to your
regular standard mountain climb but with
a variation
let me demonstrate for you in high plank
we're gonna go one
two three stick it one two three good
keep that core engaged good stuff guys
come on
make sure your shoulders are stacked
over your wrist
looks good halfway
breathe again good stuff come on
here it is counting you down
five seconds to go five four three
two and one oh
that'll do it guys well done you've just
completed
three circuits plus an additional
circuit where we target our core
you did it you should feel accomplished
just like
the fastest man on the planet usain bolt
stick with me let's do a cool down
together the good news about this cool
down here
is that we get to stay seated good stuff
i want you to go ahead and extend one
leg
bend the other go ahead and stretch
reaching for
your toes if you can't get to the toes
grab your ankle okay
let's hold our stretches for at least 20
seconds
and again if you want a deeper stretch
here forehead to knee
good be here perfect
last five seconds here before we switch
out
nice come on almost there perfect
go ahead the opposite side this will be
a quick stretch guys we'll be done soon
go ahead reach for those toes if you
feel tightness in that
pay attention to how your body feels
right
you may need to replenish very shortly
