hey guys welcome to the new class fit
sugar my name is charlie atkins i'll be
your trainer and i'll be leading you
through a
30 minute full body strength workout
this session
is sponsored by under armour no
equipment is needed
so let's get ready to fire up those
muscles all right let's go ahead and
start with our warm up coming down onto
the mat we're going to start with hip
circles so i want you to come
on to your elbows and knees not your
hands and knees on your elbows and knees
nice flat back
all i want you to do is take your right
knee through a giant circle these are
slow circles we want to make sure that
the body is nice and warm
for our full body strength workout try
spreading the toes in the shoes and
pulling
the heel a little bit closer to the
booty and then all i want you to do is
reverse the direction of your circle
try to go nice and slow and controlled
and don't dip over onto the left side of
your body
everything that we do on the right side
today we're going to do on the left side
so let's go ahead and switch legs so
left side all i'm doing is pulling my
heel
close towards my booty staying on the
elbows
not dipping over onto the right side of
my body taking the left knee through a
giant
circle really try pulling the knee
towards the armpit or the elbow
and then we will also switch directions
on this side so go ahead and just
reverse the direction of your circle
this is a warm up that i do before every
single one of my workouts because it
feels
so good i hope that you can agree
make sure you're not falling over to the
right side of the body press into the
elbows
and then let's move into our next
warm-up which is going to be abductor
rock
so right leg is straight up to the side
and then all i want you to do is press
the hips forward and backwards
one thing i don't want you to do is have
the foot on the mat so i want you to
keep an active ankle
leaving the bottom of the foot off the
mat and then we're just pressing the
hips
forward and backwards feeling a nice
stretch all throughout the inner thigh
if you can align the hip over the knee
but if you're super flexible you might
find that
that alignment just isn't giving you
enough of an inner thigh stretch
so you can always change that up let's
go ahead and switch sides
toe pulls towards the shin hips are
shifting back and then all you're doing
is just rocking the hips forward and
backwards if you aren't really feeling
anything in these abductor rocks what
you can do is you can press the inside
of the foot down into the mat
as you press the hips forward and
backwards
don't forget to breathe and then as
you're moving the hips forward and
backwards
try to keep a straight line from the
head all the way to the tailbone
from here we're going to come into a
downward facing dog i'm going to show
you my favorite trick for a downward
facing dog roll the top of your mat
elevate the heels of your hands
and then lifting up into a downward
facing dog bend the knees push the
tailbone to the sky
and then i want you thinking about
spreading your hands nice and wide
pushing into the ground almost like
you're sliding into home plate
if you want a little bit more we're just
going to start to lift one heel up
and then the other so toe stays pulling
towards the shin
if you notice as my leg lifts up i have
a straight line from my head
all the way to my heel
if you have super tight hamstrings just
try bending the knees a little bit more
always pushing the tailbone to the sky
good
from our downward facing dog we're going
to come down onto the mat into quadruped
position
you can go ahead and unflip the mat in
quadruped position tuck the toes under
shoulders over elbows hips over knees
and then i just want you to hover off
the ground while engaging the core if
you have a little bit of a curvature in
your spine i'm totally okay with that
but right now we're trying to warm up
the core as we get ready for this
strength workout
one thing that i see a lot in bear holds
is your booty is usually too high so i
really want you to think about engaging
the core
your quads might burn a little bit but
don't worry we're almost done with this
and you're just hovering right off the
ground give me one deep breath in
and then let it go let's do a core set
making sure that our abs are ready to go
for this
strength workout we're gonna do all
these exercises two times through
so lying down on the back mat i want you
to plug
either your elbow or your hand into your
left knee both toes are pulling towards
the chin and then just the right side
we're going to inhale extend exhale
bring everything back to center
so these should be slow and controlled
and i really want you to think about
keeping the lower back
pressed into the mat if you want a
little bit more out of this exercise
you're going to push harder in this
opposite hand
that's holding onto your knee but
if you are doing this correctly then
you're gonna totally feel this
all throughout that six pack inhale
reach exhale bring it back to center
and then let's do the same thing on the
opposite side so hand is pressing into
thigh
toes pulled towards the shin you're
going to inhale extend
exhale bring everything back to center
so if you notice my heel is only a few
inches
off the ground i'm really thinking about
pressing my lower back into the mat as i
extend
and i'm making it harder on myself just
by pushing into that
right leg good few more seconds here
inhale reach exhale good
from here let's go ahead and start to
warm up the upper body
go ahead and grab opposite elbows you're
going to come down into your plank
position
feet are going to be hip distance apart
hands are down and then all i want you
to do is replace hand with elbow
hand with elbow replace the elbow with
hands so plank walk
keeping the body nice and controlled
some people also call these commandos
i like to call them a plank walk because
if you notice our body is in a nice
straight line and we're just lowering
down and lifting up
replace elbow with hand hand with elbow
and what you're trying to do is not let
the body rock so you want to keep the
body as stiff as possible
from there let's go ahead and flip back
onto our back doing a lot of core
exercises
you'll love it right legs out left knee
is up the arm that's up
is the knee that's up and then all we're
doing is just rolling up
onto that elbow reaching for the sky
so keep your right or your extended leg
toe flexed
and you're just reaching up pressing
into the elbow lowering down so
quarter get up the half get up would be
coming all the way up onto the hand
but for now we're just coming right up
onto the elbow
keep the foot that's extended make sure
that ankle stays flexed toe stays
pulling towards the chin
onto the opposite side so the knee
that's up is the arm that's up left arm
is out
reaching up to the sky slowly lowering
down
try to keep your extended leg on the
ground and you want to reach reach reach
for the stars
with that opposite hand rolling onto the
elbow working
all of the core
from here we're going to head right back
into those dead bugs so re-center
yourself
on your mat we're going to start with
left arm
left leg toe pulls towards chin big
inhale reach
exhale bring it all back to center
inhale reach really think about your
lower back pressing into the mat
keep the ankle active by pulling the toe
towards the shin you're reaching the
body in both directions
and if you want to make it harder on
yourself just push into that bent knee
as hard as you can
switch sides so really trying to give as
much tension as you can between these
two limbs and then really trying to
extend and create space between the
opposite lips
[Music]
keep looking up towards the sky toe
pulls towards the shin
inhale reach use the exhale bring
everything back to center
[Music]
inhale reach oh wow it's getting tough
almost there give me a few more reps
we're gonna flip over and do those plank
walks let's go ahead and come into that
exercise
so you can use that trick that i taught
you by grabbing opposite elbows placing
them down on the mat
hands down feet back replacing hands
with elbows
elbows with hands one thing that you're
trying to do
in this exercise is you're not trying to
rock so i don't want you to rock that's
going to
not to bring you any joy to your lower
back but if you want to bring joy to
your core
you're going to control the body
from moving side to side so i'm just
replacing hand with elbow
elbow with hand reaching up
coming down these don't have to be fast
in fact the slower you lower yourself
down the more you're gonna feel that
in your core and stronger you're gonna
get in the arms coming into our quarter
get ups
it's kind of like this is what i call
the get out of bed exercise
because you know it's like you're
rolling out of bed every morning so
these are the get out of bed
muscles that you're building right here
rolling yourself up
the knee that's up is the arm that's up
make sure that this shoulder stays out
of the ear one way that you can do that
is by pressing the elbow down into the
ground
let the breath help you
good and then we'll switch sides same
exact thing knee that's up is the arm
that's up
leg is out at the side keep looking up
towards the ceiling the entire time if
you start to feel your neck
get tight it's probably because you're
trying to hold your head up so let your
head
reset in between each rep by letting the
back of the head
touch down on the ground rolling
yourself up lowering down good
[Music]
perfect give me one more oh
all right let's go ahead and go into our
first round of strength exercises we're
gonna do two times through
so let's go ahead and get started first
exercise is going to be a one and a half
squat so feet or hip distance apart
i just want you to lower down in your
squat come up halfway
lower all the way back down and then
come right back up to standing
lowering down lifting up so by doing
this one and a half squat
i'm trying to encourage you to slow down
your exercises one thing that you need
to keep in mind in the squat is that the
knees are always driving away from each
other
chest is always staying up lifting up
halfway
coming right back down and just
repeating it from
a side view i really want you to focus
on keeping the heart up
so lowering down halfway up all the way
back down
all the way back up should start to feel
this
in the quads maybe a little in the booty
coming halfway up all the way down good
give me one more
perfect go ahead and come to the end of
the mat we're gonna be doing an inchworm
so all i want you to do is think about
keeping hips high up to the sky
if you have tight hamstrings bend the
knees walk walk walk coming out to your
inchworm
and coming right back up standing up all
the way out
plank position keeping the hips moving
up towards the sky as you move forward
and backwards so not only is this a
core and an upper body exercise this is
also going to help you
stretch out the hamstrings warm them up
for whatever else
we did we decided to do today lifting up
one thing i want you to try not to do is
i often see
a lot of people walk with their hands
out if you want to protect your wrist
i want you to think about keeping
fingertips forward especially the middle
finger that's the
main thing i try to focus on is making
sure that my middle finger is always
pointing forward
good now from there let's go ahead and
walk out
i'm going to get a little bit more upper
body from here i want you to shift the
way forward lower down
reach in front of you pull back push up
so all we're doing is a push-up reach
to the best of your ability i want you
to try not to do these from your
knees so i really want you to encourage
yourself
to keep the booty tight the core strong
the arms even stronger lifting yourself
up lowering down
now remember none of these exercises
need to be fast you can do them nice and
controlled
trying to get perfect reps every single
time
you're gonna be balancing on one leg two
things you can do kickstand the back leg
and then all i want you to do is reach
the opposite arm out so facing
forward hips shift back you're cross
reaching
single leg deadlift so this back leg is
not doing
any work i want all of the work to
happen
in this front leg if i feel confident
with my
cross-reaching single leg deadlift what
i can do
is i can start to reach the leg behind
me
so if you are a yogi this is like a
warrior three
you're just coming in and out of it one
thing i do want you to focus on let's go
ahead and switch sides
is i want you to make sure that the back
toe is flexed
so i want you to pull the toe close to
the shin so start with your kick stand
just until you get the motion of the
exercise
and then if you're ready to add more
sometimes you lose your balance
you can start to lift that back leg up
don't rush these exercises
i know we're doing this based on time
but i've built in enough time
for you to practice getting stronger at
all these exercises
we did say full body strength so that's
what we're doing so you can lift the
back leg up
or if you feel more confident you feel
like you're getting a better workout
simply by pushing the tailbone back
reaching out in front of you you can do
it that way let's go ahead and come back
to our one and a half squats i want you
to see if you can get a little bit
deeper
superwoman pretend that you have a
superwoman
logo on your chest you want that
superwoman logo to be facing forward the
entire time
lowering down halfway up all the way
down right back up
now that we have the motion figured out
i want you to make sure that all of your
toes
are pushing down into the mat
good don't forget that little tempo
at the bottom just to keep you in that
pose or that exercise a little bit
longer help you get a little bit
stronger each time you do it
making sure all of my toes are pushing
down into the ground
the entire time my knees are pressing
away from each other
good from there we're going to come into
that inchworm
so go ahead and come to the back of your
mat whenever you're ready to go
remember middle fingers forward
whenever we don't have a lot of shoulder
mobility that's when we tend to start to
see our hands
going out but if you're really wanting
to get a little bit stronger
to have a nice strong wrist i want you
to challenge yourself to grip the ground
middle finger forward tailbone reaches
to this
now remember after our inchworm the next
exercise are those push-up reaches
so at the end of our 15 seconds here
we're just going to stay out in that
height plank
[Music]
fingers forward not sideways
take these as slow and controlled as you
want this is my last one i'm gonna go
ahead and stay out here
set up for my push-up now i like to
shift myself forward elbows point back
reach pull push
you're trying with all of your might to
build up your arm straight to not do it
from the knees
so you lower down reach take a big
exhale and let that be the one that
launches you up off the mat
another quick form cue elbows are
pointed back at a 45 degree angle
i don't want a t i don't want an eye i
want an a
an a is an apple
good one more and then let's come on up
to standing
kicks down that back foot another way
that you can learn how to do these dead
lifts properly is
i want you to pretend that you have
paint on your hand
and you're just pushing as hard as you
can into that front side
so i'm pushing my tailbone back i have
paint on the front of my hands
and i'm just pressing into my thigh if
i'm ready for more i want to challenge
my hamstrings and my glutes
a little bit more there's a wall there
then i can challenge my balance
challenge my strength by letting all of
that work
go into one leg
[Music]
fyi single leg deadlifts are a very
challenging exercise so if you're like
oh my gosh
i'm having so much trouble they're a
troubling exercise
so you can paint the front of your shin
if you'd like or
if you're looking for a little bit more
[Music]
you're
seeing if you can balance opposite arm
reaches out so a good way to remember
single leg deadlifts is the leg that's
back
is the arm that's reaching i'll say it
again the leg that's back
is the arm that's reaching keep the back
ankle active toe pulls towards the shin
stomping down into the ground to get
yourself right back up to standing
all right now from there crossroads
single leg deadlifts are done let's go
ahead and head into
another round of exercises fyi we're
going to be doing all of these three
times through you're going to come down
into a half kneeling position
lift yourself up and you're going to
hold that's it ice
isometric split squat so the difference
between a split squat and a lunge is a
lunge is dynamic
split squat is a one legged squat so all
we're doing is we're holding one leg in
a squat and we're balancing ourselves up
off the mat you're almost there i talked
you through it
stand up and then go ahead and switch
sides if you feel like you have tension
in that knee what i want you to do is
hinge forward a little bit at the hip
so start at the bottom of your exercise
lift yourself up feeling tension in the
back knee
pull the hips forward a little bit but
straight line from the head to the
tailbone if you can drive all
ten toes down into the mat you can put
hands down in a low v like you're a
cheerleader
fire up this back glue keep the
shoulders out of the ears you're almost
there keep breathing
all ten toes down into the mat good
lift yourself up that one's always a
burner
i know that squats and lunges are very
challenging
but they're in almost every single
workout let's go ahead and come down
into the mat
push up plank position shoulders over
the wrist elbow to the sky wrist to the
rib
so squats and lunges we're just doing
plank rows here working on core strength
try not to let the body rotate squats
and lunges are in every single workout
because
they burn a lot of energy they require a
lot of energy
they're the biggest bang for your sweaty
buck
so of course we're going to include them
in the strength exercise and that
exercise we just did
that isometric split squat that's the
one that's going to help you land
or i guess you want to land yeah land
all of those
exercises from there let's go ahead and
bring the heart rate back up
we're going to be doing under the fence
so you're just pretending
that there is a fence right here and
you're just going right under the fence
so stand all the way up switching sides
the goal of this is just to kind of
bring the heart rate up it feels good in
the hips one thing i am doing in this
under the fence
is i'm pushing my tailbone back i stand
all the way up
and i'm pivoting on one foot
good stay with it all right next
exercise is love or hate
you can let me know in the comments
below if it's a love or hate for you
crab reach so come on down to the ground
i'm gonna give you options
hands are pointed at i want to say
four and seven if you know what that is
now one thing i can do four and seven on
an
analog clock what i can do here is i can
touch my knees
so i'm balancing on one arm one leg
opposite
touching knees for my advanced friends
or if you're ready to upgrade your
exercise
you go full extension full extension so
one thing that has to happen i have to
spread open my chest
i have to have strong arms balance will
come
over time so if you find that exercise
super challenging the good news is we're
going to do it two more times
split squats now you can do isometric
or if you're ready to upgrade you're
going to do full split squat
so one thing that i like to do in my
split squats is i think about pulling my
feet
towards each other as i lower down
if i have a pulling on that back leg i'm
just going to hinge forward slightly
still keeping my head in line with my
tailbone and that's going to take some
tension
out of that hip flexor back hip flexor i
should say
switching sides same thing i'll face
forward for this one half kneeling
position is where you start if you want
to just do the isometric you can
if you're ready for more slight forward
lean pushing
through this front leg so my working leg
is the front leg back leg is a kickstand
pushing through that front foot trying
to push all 10 toes that includes the
back ones
down into the ground to get me up to the
standing position don't be afraid to do
a slight forward lean
good from there back to our upper body
core we're doing plank rows another
trick of the trade you can roll the top
of your mat if you feel any tension
in your wrist you're in that plank
position shift the weight forward
elbow to the sky wrist to the rib keep
the elbow tight to the body
challenge yourself to not sway the hips
so
when i pull elbow to the sky rest of the
rib i don't want my hips to move
if my hips aren't moving then my core is
working if my hips are moving
then i gotta work on my core another
trick of the trade go wider feet
to build up strength
almost there good
[Music]
come on up next to these under the
fences under the fences always remind me
of my youth
i was just you know going to the
baseball field
whatever it was and you're just you know
sliding under the fence
so don't lose your balance like i just
did you're trying
to get a little bit of movement into
your workout bring the heart rate up as
you can
when you do strength workouts one thing
that people always talk about they're
like i don't burn is
or i don't feel like i get that like i
do in cardio
that's because we're challenging your
body in a different way so here's your
quick cardio moment
of our strength workout see if you can
get the heart rate up good
now coming down to your new favorite
exercise crab reaches
remember this one takes takes some time
to learn spread the chest point the
hands
back and i can start by touching
opposite hand opposite knee or if i'm
ready for the full thing
i'm going to extend my leg okay
they're both the same exercise they both
challenge the same thing
the thing that makes one of them
different than the other is you're
either
extending your leg causing more room for
you to
sway side to side which is why your core
and your arms got to support it
[Music]
final round of these exercises this
right here is the meat and potatoes of
the workout
split squat you can do isometric just
like we did in that first round or
if you're feeling yourself you take that
slight forward lean
and i'm just pushing through this front
heel
straight line from my head to my
tailbone whether i'm standing straight
up
or i have a slight forward length making
sure that all 10 toes yes all 10 of them
not just the ones in the back
are pushing down into the ground good
you're almost there
and then go ahead and switch sides so in
a split squat i find the easiest way to
start it is on the bottom because then i
know that my limbs
are in a really great position once i'm
ready to go i'll pop up
and i start to go for it
if this is not your first time doing
this video and you're like oh
i want a little bit more you can add a
little dumbbell right here at the chest
it's how you make these exercises more
challenging for yourself and this is a
workout
that is going to age well this workout
is going to follow you everywhere that
you go all these exercises are things
that's going to make you stronger
so you just keep keep challenging
yourself coming into that plank row
roll the top of your mat new trick of
the trade keeping
the elbow or the um what are they called
heels of the hands elevated
now when i pull i don't want my body to
rock i'm trying to keep everything stiff
if i'm working on keeping everything
stiff i just go wider stance
if my stiff body is nailing it i'm just
going to bring my feet closer together
okay so that's how you turn exercises
into more challenging variations
almost there good
this is our youthful intervention it's
under the fence
all you're doing pushing the tailbone
back
hinging at the hips moving side to side
get the breath involved exhale as you
come up
good so again i'm pushing my tailbone
back
so i'm pushing my tailbone back straight
line from my head to my heel
i'm just moving side to side not quite a
squat
not quite a deadlift just me trying to
get under the fence
good nice your new favorite exercise
crab reach final round you have to do it
remember extended leg bent knee your
choice take a deep breath in
side out come on down here we go hands
are pointed at four and seven spread the
chest
five and seven if you don't know what
that is it's a analog clock
just making sure the hands are pointed
towards the
feet and not towards the head your
choice straight leg
or that knee which one feels better for
you
not which one is more challenging which
one do you feel like you have more
control over
[Music]
good all right coming up to standing the
good news is we've made it
to the final round and of course i'm
going to send you out of here with some
more core work
we've got two exercises we're just going
to keep repeating them
until you love them more than you love
the crab reaches
first exercise is going to be a plank
spider it would not be a charlie atkins
workout
if it did not include a plank spider
just like i taught you in the plank rows
plank position you're trying not to let
the rest of your body move
as you balance on one leg and you pull
the knee up
towards the armpit try shifting the
weight forward
one thing that i see a lot is
everybody's booty is too high
you want a straight line from your head
all the way to your hands
good almost there don't worry you'll do
those again
next one is the butterfly sit up come
down onto the mat challenging exercise
i'm gonna warn you ahead of time
sitting all the way up touching the
other side of your mat
if you're having trouble sitting all the
way up in a butterfly sit up
what you can do is you can do a
butterfly crunch
but i would rather you do a plank but
that would be a lot of planks so a
butterfly crunch
is a great way to work your abs but if
you're looking for a phenomenal amazing
way
do a regular plank regular plank is one
of the best core exercises
good let's go ahead and flip over round
number two of three
told you to go by quick we've got this
plank spider
roll the top of your mouth push up plank
position
not letting the rest of your body move
now the knee does not have to touch the
elbow or the armpit
as long as you can balance yourself on
one leg
while getting a little bit of a hip
opener happening
micro bend the elbows that's going to
make it more challenging shift the
weight forward make sure the booty is
not up in the air
good flipping over right into our
butterfly sit-ups
hold the feet together knees out wide
sitting up
touching the other side of the feet
you go more challenging
keep arms reaching up to the sky the
whole time
[Music]
reaching up
keep on
[Applause]
almost there all right let's go ahead
come down one more time clink spider
push up plank position you're bringing
me
so close so close keep going
knee up almost there less than 10
seconds left to go
try not to let the booty go up in there
give me one more on each side
good flipping over butterfly sit up
last one oh sitting up touching the
other side of the feet
more challenging arms stay up towards
the sky the entire time
let the breath help you come on this is
our last exercise you're gonna push all
the way through
give me two more if you got it oh one
more one more one more
and there you go let's go ahead and wind
down let's do a quick little cool down
roll the top of your mat let's stretch
out those hamstrings stretch out the
upper body bend the knees push the tub
into the sky
just hold a nice sound dog
[Music]
feeling good feeling strong right
[Music]
so stay breathing bend the knees push
the tailbone to the sky and then push
push your hands down into the mat like
you're sliding into home plate
if you have room and you have the
flexibility for it you can start to
press the heels down towards the mat
but if you start to feel your upper body
curve take that bend in the knee
from there go ahead and drop your knees
down to the mat
bring the right leg forward so i'm in a
half kneeling position but it's not a
split squat
and then all i'm going to do is open my
heart up towards that front leg
winding down now as many number of reps
as you can get in these
few seconds don't worry about going on
my tempo do whatever feels good for you
but what i'm trying to do is i'm trying
to rotate my body down to where i can
maybe get my forearm
down towards the mat but if you're like
me and you have tight hips then just
really focus on the actual movement
that's happening
as opposed to trying to get the forearm
down to the mat
let's do one more on this side
and go ahead and switch
so half kneeling position reaching up
trying to rotate working on bringing the
elbow down to the mat but if it doesn't
happen today
you just keep working for it
start to feel the heart rate come down
reaching up
