This offering has nothing to do with yoga because there isn´t a sparkle <br />of qualities inside this video Patanjali is asking for. Has this woman <br />got a real serious education in the surrounding of real yoga? I have my<br /> doubts about this. I can see only an egoshow of a pretty girl. Nothing <br />more and nothing less. And YouTube is full of this nonsence people are <br />calling &quot;Yoga&quot; where is no yoga inside.,Musik Liebhaber,2021-01-01T13:21:49Z,0

"Hello, I have a request for yoga for a shoulder impingement. I have had it since July! And the physio has helped a little but I still have a lot of pain. The Dr advises not to lift the arm too much and also no downward facing dogs. But I LOVE YOGA and need my daily fix. Yet, still I have not found any specific shoulder injury yoga that could help (apart from the obvious resting) but some stretches would be great and I know that’s something Adriene could provide 😊 Namaste 🙏",Marianne Dittrich,2020-11-12T06:39:23Z,0

"Yoga is NOT good for you, is not good  for your health and certainly not good for your mind, but most importantly is very dangerous for Your soul. Yoga is a religion ,which worships  evil spirits. The asanas are poses in which a person   allows  these spirits to come  into their life ,body ,mind and probably spirit ,operate through the person who does yoga .In many cases the  person even wouldn&#39;t feel their presence, because they are very good at  pretending to be you &#39;In some cases they even can  make you feel good ,  powerful ,creative  intuitive ,joyful and even psychic/you know this from the devil, right-being a psychic?/<br />.It is only a big deception. After some time they will turn against you, just wait and see.<br />They can start manifesting  powerfully in the presence of God and reveal their true and evil nature .If you want them to go they will not leave!!!!You have no free will with them. They might even start torturing you as a revenge and make your life  as hell, no  exaggeration....<br />The only way out of this -stop doing yoga right now, repent your sins and accept Jesus and the True  God. Our Creator! May God bless you!!<br /><br />Former yoga practitioner  and ex new ager.",TheJuneuk,2020-10-17T00:22:45Z,0

"Hey Adrienne! First of all, I love your yoga workouts and your personality! :)<br />I would love to do more yoga, but I always feel insecure about my form since my posture is so terrible. It’s not my shoulders but rather my neck which looks basically like the one of a turtle. Even if I try really hard and stand in front of a wall, my neck won’t go into its natural position. I was wondering if you could make a video on this - since this forward head posture is something pretty common nowadays due to us sitting so much in front of our Handys or laptops... <br />It would mean a lot to me if you could make a yoga workout especially for this issue which I could then do every day before school or if you could simply give me some tips on how to change my posture when simply trying to stand up straight and bring my head back isn’t really possible anymore...<br /><br />Greetings from Germany! :)<br />Paula",P 21,2020-10-15T13:03:37Z,0

I’ve been not stable most of my life and been bothering my family about my mental health till a point i can’t show any signs of struggle, it’s something i chose to do. I need to be strong for myself and family. When i was a child i had a bad experience of with a relative, harassment, but I’ve never told my family about it. I handle it good but few days it get me anxious knowing how bad it influenced me. But I’m willing to be strong. I’m not a person who cries at all, almost rarely, but these meditations surprisingly ends up with few tears that feels good.

"Hi Adriene, I would like to send you a big thank you for your work. Exactly one year ago I got beat up in the streets after a goodbye party in France, just before leaving my home country for Canada where I live now. The fight left me with an AC joint injury and pain that lasted for more than 10 months, which affected my boxing practise. I am happy to say that after listening to a David Goggins podcast where he mentioned yoga and reading the comment of someone recommending your videos, I ended up on your channel and after 2 weeks of yoga practise as a complete beginner and following your instructions, my shoulder injury is now completely healed. I also suffer from anxiety and depression and your work has been a life saver, quite literally. Greetings from a Norman traveler who&#39;s hoping to give you a thank you hug one day!

"The elements of the body<br /><br />There are two main energies: spiritual energy and material energy. Spiritual energy is conscious and material energy is unconscious. The soul is conscious spiritual energy and the body is made up of unconscious material energy. Without food, there would only be the self, the soul aka (1) antimatter towards unconscious matter with a size of .1 nanometer with its shells.<br /><br />According to the Sankhya philosophy, a person&#39;s body is composed of the following 24 elements:<br /><br />(1-5) 5 mahābhūtas (&quot;great elements&quot; - earth, water, fire, air, ether / space),<br />(6) manas (mind, inclinations, spirit),<br />(7) buddhi (intelligence),<br />(8) ahaṅkāra (ego  as a result of identification with the body and what goes with it),<br />(9-13) 5 senses acquiring knowledge (indriya - sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch),<br />(14-18) 5 working senses (karmendriya - legs, arms, anus, genital and speech organ),<br />(19-23) 5 sensory objects (indriyārtha - shape / color, sound, taste, smell and touch),<br />(24) avyakta (the unmanifest)<br /><br />The five great elements, the ten senses and the five sense objects make up the gross body and manas, buddhi, and ahaṅkāra make up the subtle body. Avyakta is the basis of both. In this connection of 24 elements sits the individual soul (jivātma) as an inhabitant of the body, accompanied by the paramātma, the oversoul.<br /><br />.With soul and oversoul, the human being consists of 26 elements. Jivātma and paramātma are both referred to as kṣetra-jña (&quot;knower of the field&quot;). The body is kṣetra, the field of activity, and the soul is the knower of the field. But while the Oversoul knows all fields of all living beings, the individual soul does not even properly know its respective body. Through unthinkable long contact with the material energy, the spiritual souls have forgotten their original knowledge and identify with the body in which they are currently living. With the body they try to enjoy by manipulating material nature and exploiting the riches of material nature.<br /><br />These 24 elements are manifestations, transformations of the material energy and exist in and outside the body as constituents of the universe. Their development, properties and interactions are described in various Vedic scriptures and also in the Ayurveda classic Caraka-Samhita. Just as a potter makes a jug out of clay and water, the spiritual soul, under the influence of the three modes of appearance, sattva (goodness) , rajas (passion), tamas (ignorance), unconsciously creates its respective body from the 24 material elements through its inclinations. In contrast to the potter, who knows how to make a certain object, most souls do not know how they made their bodies. They carry out certain actions with one body, cherish certain likes and dislikes, etc. and receive their next body from the Oversoul according to their karma<br /><br />The three doṣas (bioenergies and bioelements), the seven dhātus (types of body tissue), the upadhātus (subsidiary body tissue) and the malas (waste products) contain the mahābhūtas in different proportions. The seven dhātus are:<br /><br />rasa (lymph; plasma)<br />rakta (blood)<br />maṃsa (muscle tissue)<br />medas (fat tissue)<br />asthi (bone tissue)<br />majja (bone marrow and nerve tissue)<br />śukra (sperm and egg cells)<br /><br />The upadhātus are tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, muscle fat, breast milk, menstrual blood and the six layers of skin.<br /><br />The body&#39;s breakdown products are feces, urine and sweat. Hair, fingernails and toenails, ear wax, and other secretions are also considered malas. The malas feces, urine and sweat, ear wax and other secretions need to be eliminated regularly. If they are not properly eliminated, disease will arise.<br /><br />( From the signs and symptoms caused by the increase or decrease in doṣas, dhātus and malas, the doctor can determine which mahābhūtas are required to restore their equilibrium. Then he can prescribe certain foods and drugs (with corresponding mahābhūtas) to compensate for the deficits or excess of mahābhūtas in doṣas etc.)<br /><br />Whether there are other energies and what these are all about can be found in the Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Vedic scriptures.<br /><br />(1) Whatever we see within this universe, within material world and spiritual world, the spiritual world is expansion of internal energy, and this material world is expansion of external energy, and we living entities, we are expansion of marginal energy. So three energies.  Multi-energies. All the multi-energies grouped in three headings: antaraṅga-śakti, bahiraṅga-śakti, taṭastha-śakti. Antaraṅga-śakti means internal energy, bahiraṅga śakti means external energy, and taṭastha-śakti means these living entities (cit kana part and parcel). We are śakti; we are energy. We are not the energetic.",matthias elsner,2020-09-29T10:35:49Z,1

"Adriene , I just wanted to give you a huge THANKS for not putting mid-roll ads into your videos. It seems common sense for workout channels but I just did a yoga video yesterday from a channel I really like (that never had ads during the work out) because I like to mix yoga in and it had 4 ads (two of which were 15 seconds and non-skippable) within a 29 minute video and that doesn’t really work when you’re trying to de-stress with a work out.  YouTube is really pushing everyone to pay for premium so they can be like Netflix and Hulu and Disney+ but I don’t think content creators realize if everybody did that there would be no ads and they would not be making any money at all.",317 CRL,2020-09-26T15:50:15Z,0
Hi Adriene! I was wondering if you had any recommendations on educational yoga books?? I&#39;ve been watching your videos to help practice yoga for about 8 or 9 months now and I&#39;ve not only seen a physical change in myself but also a mental and emotional change as well! I feel like I appreciate and more aware of the little positive lights and experiences I&#39;ve had and I really believe that&#39;s because yoga and meditation has made me feel more connected to everything around me. I&#39;m not sure if that sounds crazy but I thank you for these videos!! You have really helped me find myself and have helped teach me how to take care of me! <br /><br />Youuu rock!

"&quot;Yoga&quot; is also known as &quot;astanga&quot;...which means there are 8 limbs of yoga, one is upayoga which is the physical yoga,  it is only the third level out of eight which is most popular now<br /><br />Three levels are dharana(effort), dhyana(no effort) and samadhi(cessation of mind)<br />Samadhi is a state when the mind becomes calm no anger no sadness just peace and happiness!",Gaming_Manushya,2020-09-25T12:36:18Z,3

"I first started yoga with Adriene at my friend&#39;s recommendation at the start of the pandemic. Adriene, you had about 6-million or so subscribers at the time. You gained about 2 million since then, and that is incredible! But also, I think it should be +200 million because you are the greatest, and you help so many people. I have been consistently doing your yoga videos every day/morning (maybe miss about 2-3 days a month), and I&#39;ve NEVER stuck with a &quot;work out&quot; program for this long and this consistently. Now I am just addicted. I can&#39;t proceed with my day until I see you in the morning first (sounds creepy, I know, but it&#39;s true). You have helped me through this pandemic, and also my high-stress job.<br /><br />I recommend you to all my friends.<br /><br />I just wanted to say thank you, and please never stop shining the way that you do.",Julie Cho,2020-09-24T16:16:12Z,10

"Global Synchronized Meditation Against the Engineered Second Wave of Lockdowns <br />On September 21st , 2020 at 10:08 PM UTC (6:08 PM EDT in New York)<br /><br />&quot;Jesuits and Black Nobility families plan is to use the engineered second wave of lockdowns to implement a comprehensive social credit system. This would give the Cabal a tool for mass surveillance and control of individuals, corporations, and sociopolitical entities. To counteract this, a globally-synchronized Mass-Meditation is scheduled at the exact time of the astrological Saturn-Chariklo conjunction (alignment) on Monday, September 21st at 10:08 PM UTC.&quot;<br /><br />A promotional video has been created for the meditation, please feel free to share it far and wide:<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=11&amp;v=i5xT3zNYFWY&amp;feature=emb_logo"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=11&amp;v=i5xT3zNYFWY&amp;feature=emb_logo</a><br /><br />- Guided audio for this meditation has been translated into multiple languages:<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-ujIE4tLGbFLBLlYHr4d61cwZ7gKfe4s"">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-ujIE4tLGbFLBLlYHr4d61cwZ7gKfe4s</a><br /><br />- Livestream starts at 9:45 PM UTC (5:45 PM EDT New York):<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlZKkrfZ94U"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlZKkrfZ94U</a><br /><br />- More details about this information including the exact time of the meditation in selected time zones:<br /><a href=""https://www.welovemassmeditation.com/2020/09/meditation-against-engineered-second-wave-lockdowns-on-september-21st-at-1008-pm-utc.html"">https://www.welovemassmeditation.com/2020/09/meditation-against-engineered-second-wave-lockdowns-on-september-21st-at-1008-pm-utc.html</a><br /><br />Global synchronized meditation at the exact-moment of the Saturn-Chariklo conjunction (where the two planets appear to be close together in the sky) on September 21st is key to offsetting any further attempts at lockdowns.",AstralTraveler,2020-09-21T00:40:37Z,0

My giant German Shepherd x Husky was definitely not a fan of the bee breath 😂 he came running over so concerned and proceeded to lick my entire face.

"I have endometriosis and I’m trying yoga to help strengthen my abdominal walls to help manage the pain. I greatly enjoy Yoga With Adriene. <br />Can you make a video for yoga with endometriosis? Sometimes you do sciatica etc, it would be great to have a special video for endometriosis and help spread awareness for this illness. Much love from Germany ❤️",Alexis84DE,2020-09-18T05:27:33Z,123
"I´ve been through endometriosis 13 years ago. My doctor ends it with a burning by freezing the tissue. It is not painful, somehow uncomfortable, but not dangerous nor painful. It takes thirty minutes and I could go home by foot. The next six weeks the body will &quot;expel&quot; as a transparent menstruation, and that´s all. In my case, I got calcification in the uterus because my vitamin D was too low and my metabolism did not process the calcium from my diet, but deposited it as a &quot;sediment&quot; in the uterus, becoming a painful endometriosis. After that &quot;experience&quot;, I get daily for my ten minutes under the Sun to activate my Vitamin D and let the body do the rest. Good luck, Alexis",Rosa Maria Panadero Martinez,2020-10-21T18:28:26Z,1

"Hei, fellow endo sister. Big hug from Latvia. I&#39;m also in search of some stretching exercises from yogis because they seem to be gentle enough. I&#39;ve also taken on running, as hoping that exercise and strengthening my core could help, but stretching is a must for us no matter what. I found an article on Australian government healthcare site about exercise and endometriosis, and basically they say that you&#39;ve got to be careful with strengthening a tight muscle, especially in case of endo, so basically stretching out pelvic muscles is very useful. That, and afterwards you can do some strength exercises as well. They advise us to be especially mindful about pre workout stretching, else it can make things worse. Hopefully I wrote stuff in an understandable manner, just came home from a 5k run and am a bit dizzy :D",Dana,2020-10-05T10:54:14Z,4
