I&#39;m following this 30 day plan to improve my breathing but found I sleep much better. Don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do when the 30 days finish 🤔,Trevor Harrison,2021-03-09T22:28:21Z,0
"I&#39;m recovering from having an ovary removed due to endometriosis in December and feeling so much better physically, and much stronger, especially in my mental health and my attitude to recovery! Thanks, Adriene!",Aine Mc Donnell,2021-03-03T04:19:01Z,0
since the start I do this practice everyday  in the morning with an empty stomach. This is the first time that I felt like I was going to faint. I could not stay up in the end I had to transition to shavasana. This is the firs time that I felt like my muscles are sore from the previous practices. my mid back my legs were so tight and sore. and when you did the side plank my obliques were okay but my wrists hurt so bad. For the first time in 24 days this happened to my wrists. (I ground my hands like a claw it takes a little weight off my wrists but still it hurts so much) I just wanted to share if anyone has tips for me.,Elvan Kimyon,2021-05-08T05:00:18Z,0

"Adriene, I love you! Thank you for always coming through with these videos, I&#39;ve been doing them for years! You are such a sweet person, so cute and funny, and your instructions are so direct and clear that I feel like I&#39;m doing yoga with a friend and am super comfortable! I do find I always have trouble with the simple seated positions, my lower and middle back end up in so much pain after just a minute or two, even if I rise my hips up with a block or pillow! I know this probably is related to poor posture, but often it hurts too much to get through even the meditations and breathwork and I worry this is affecting my practice or improvement. Sometimes it hurts so much that I skip the seated work and it bothers me that I do that. Do you have any tips for people who struggle with just sitting?? Thank you so much!",themselves press,2021-04-22T15:35:26Z,0

"Took a break when we were standing at the last part because I felt so lightheaded. I took a few calming breaths and I continued when I felt better.

"Thank you Adriene. Tough week for me, I&#39;m unfolding a lot of new layers to the challenges of my life. A couple times I was getting lost during this practice and it made me emotional, because it felt like the other things in my life that Im struggling to keep up with. But I was able to surrender, breath, and find center as I&#39;ve been taught and that helped me finish on a positive. I learn as much in this practice about my body as I do about my soul. I&#39;m excited to see what lessons I will be able to take off the mat and into my life. Namaste",Taylor Hill,2021-04-17T03:36:00Z,0

"After a couple of years now I can say that I love my body. My hands are longer than most girls&#39;, but that helps me play guitar more easily! My shoulders are a bit wider than average, but that makes me stronger than average! I can lift heavier things, and that&#39;s useful. My body doesn&#39;t look like those beautiful instagram models&#39;, but I prefer living for myself instead of living for imitating people. I prefer to find my own beauty instead of  imitating other people&#39;s beauty. I prefer being healthy, strong and beautiful in my own way. <br />This is something that I had in mind for a while and wanted to share it with this <i>truly beautiful and strong</i> community 💛",Daiana Chaves,2021-04-15T02:54:40Z,2

I am 65 years old, a father of my two daughters and in pretty good shape but i need this physically as well as emotionally.

"Dear Diary.  Day 43 2021.  Day 24 Yoga With Adriene.  I feel like I am taking control of my life,  body and spirit.   To turn up every day is difficult but I will turn up and continue to do so.   Already I wear and feel the benefits of what Adriene offers and I absorb with gratitude and pride ( let alone how my aching bod aches less already).  ☮ 😌",Perla Gaffney,2021-02-11T19:58:31Z,3

"I went six days between this routine (Day 24) and the previous one (Day 23). My longest stretch of consecutive days is 3. I’m really determined to finish, but I don’t know why finding 30 min to do this is so hard. I think I only ever did 4-6 days of the 30-day routine from years ago, so I’m already pleased I have made it this far.",Abbi Crutchfield,2021-02-11T19:06:25Z,1
"I noticed that at the beginning of the yourney, let&#39;s say 10 days in, I felt so empowered and thouht everything was slowly improving.  After day 20 tho,  I&#39;ve been feeling a bit clumpsy and inbalanced. It kinda scared the heck out of me, I was there thinking - oh god, here we go again. But then our dear universe sent me a beautiful reminder (again haha)! I remebered reading a book called The Power Is Within You by Louise L. Hay and there is this particilar sentence that made me calm down again - &#39;&#39;Even when we do a lot of work on ourselves, and clear out old blocks, new layers of old barriers still keep coming out.&#39;&#39; ♥ So, perhaps this once sentence here might trigger a new thought and help you see yourself in a different way.",Reza Jankov,2021-02-11T11:30:45Z,1
"When Adriene said &quot;and hopefully many more&quot;, I just answer &quot;YES&quot; with a big smile !

"I&#39;ve been struggling with wrist pain and taking this 30-day challenge slowly, alternating with some days doing practises off the arms. When I saw everyone commenting that side planks were on the menu of this one I thought I never could do it.

I felt so energised I finished the practice and dove straight into a quick high intensity workout to spend all the extra energy!!

Shout out to those still finishing Breath!!!  I had to take a 10 day break between day 23 and day 24 due to having gallbladder surgery!  The practice of &#39;moving from centre&#39; really helped me in the first few days of recovery when my abdomen was in so much pain!  I have missed yoga greatly and am delighted that I was able to keep up with today&#39;s practice while being mindful of not overdoing it.

Insane to think the first week I could only hold plank for 2 seconds where now I can do it the whole time. I wore tighter (but comfortable!) pants during this session and I was shocked to see how fit my legs are already getting.

This may have been the longest yoga practice of my life. I got a splitting headache in the beginning and I took some pain pills and thought &quot;well I might as well cry in pain on the mat if I can&#39;t even sleep anyway!&quot; So that&#39;s what I did. Breathing through muscle soreness on the mat kind of helps prepare you to breathe through moments of actual suffering.

"I couldn&#39;t stop smiling through this whole practice!  2021, despite (or perhaps because of) all my excitement and preparation for it, started off a slow struggle: a struggle to get up, a struggle to find motivation and energy, a struggle to find joy and ease.  But tonight, I decided to make a change in my space, opening the room up and inviting a different energy, and I followed that with this practice.  Wow have things changed!  I feel like I&#39;ve finally gotten my New Year sea legs.  Some incredible things happened with my career this weekend as well, and I think I&#39;ve really reconnected with my center today.  Thank you!<br /><br />P.S.<br />I&#39;ve been really curious about this: when do you film the videos?  Is it all done in December?  Do you record throughout January?",Rachel Bonarek,2021-01-26T05:37:14Z,0

There&#39;s awareness of diff btwn left / right which makes me reflect ok - how can I rejuvenate left side w/ openness of not trying to achieve but just accept and do as best as I can. Thanks and feeling much better with this breath of fire practice - M getting the hang of it. I try to practice it when I do my daily walking too! Which is pretty cool with the face mask on!

"This one is my new favorite! It was like doing a strong and graceful dance. It also felt good to do this in an emotional sense. Last night I had an experience that made me think, like Adriene keeps saying, “how you move matters.” A guy I have been dating for the last few months broke up with me by text message, with no explanation, which to me seemed disrespectful of the good times we had together, and really offended and hurt me - but it also struck me that I was a bit more objective about it, and not as hurt as I could have been. I really want to connect with others, and have kind interactions, even in crappy times like breakups. In general, it doesn’t cost anything to treat others with dignity and respect, even if you don’t want to be with them. There’s no harm in taking a little extra care to be kind, acknowledging that other people have needs besides myself. How we move matters...also, today after this practice I thought a lot about allowing myself to speak my own truth with firm grace. With strength, but also finding ease...it is nice to find moments where these principles appear outside of doing the physical yoga stuff on the mat (even when experiencing a soccer punch, a demoralizing experience like I did last night). I hope to get better at this by practicing it. Yoga really is a union and I want to continue learning because it is not only great exercise, the principles help me handle life’s difficulties a little better.",Lauren Green,2021-01-26T03:25:10Z,1

"Thank you, Adriene. I was starting to feel an overwhelming amount of anxiety build up this evening just before I was going to get into today&#39;s video, could feel myself get pulled into numerous distractions which only increased the anxiety but I couldn&#39;t seem to snap out of it...and while that happened, I felt the tug of an emotional downward spiral.  Finally, I was able to pull myself out of that just long enough to officially start the video. It really is the most difficult part, to START. Once I started, it was a safe place, I could breathe again, I could detach from those worries that had been so intense just moments before. Upon completing the video, I&#39;m feeling more centered, less anxiety. The positive self talk you encourage sometimes catches me off guard, especially having experienced what I did prior to this video, wow what a difference that can make to just take 20 minutes to be in a positive space that is grounded in the moment, sprinkled with that loving self talk. I loved the side balance poses - when I first started some form of yoga years ago as part of my physical therapy, that move was impossible for me, and became this huge symbolism of the change that can happen when I put self care/health first, and that I am capable of more than I realize, that I can heal and build/find strength. I was reminded of all of this in a rush of feeling within that moment, and felt that strength, that pride, that trust and love in myself, even as my arms shook. THANK YOU for what you do. So very thankful for the friend that sent me here for this 30-day challenge.",nniikkii jjaayy,2021-01-26T03:02:48Z,0

"I read someone&#39;s comment below who said she struggled with stepping forward from downward dog into a lunge.  I have extra weight around my midsection and can&#39;t step forward either, I have to lower onto my knees and swing my leg around.  I just do it that way and think, one day I will step forward, but until then, this is how I do it.  When I previewed today&#39;s video and saw the side plank, I thought there was no way my arm would be strong enough for this.  And then I did it.  My supporting arm shook, my other arm reached to the ceiling and I spontaneously burst into tears.  Yes, I needed the kick stand to stay there, but never did I ever think I would be capable of this.  A powerful lesson of the mind, I was already sabotaging myself thinking I couldn&#39;t do something but my body said &#39;of course you can&#39; ... and this is the &#39;magic&#39; that Adriene speaks of, and this is why I keep coming back.  Also, Adriene&#39;s spontaneous singing and Benji!",Estela Radan,2021-01-26T00:22:11Z,1

I would previously never have tried to continue a home exercise program when I was away.  Oh and I just loved this session, it is one of my faves from this series.  And, as always impeccable timing and insight.... just when I tried keeping my foot off the ground for the cross body standing stretch and toppled, Adriene suggested that I could just leave my foot on the ground if need be. 😆🌟🙏",Barbara N,2021-01-26T00:02:35Z,0

I   am finding joy being here each day ,whatever time it is ,knowing there is always someone somewhere in the world getting down to Breathe and ride the wave of consciousness, to laugh at the falling down and getting back up and know we are stronger together than apart.<br />Thank you Adriene for the lightness of being you so graciously show us and offer each and every day.

This is my first ever yoga practice where I am tipsy. I had 2 glasses of wine during an emotional phone call with my closest friend during UK&#39;s 3rd national lockdown. After the call, I felt motivated to show up on the mat  and it was a very unique experience. I was much more focused than usual (my anxiety means I&#39;m quite restless usually) and I was more forgiving. I&#39;m excited for tomorrow&#39;s practice and to finish the rest of this journey.

"a couple of days before all of a sudden became so huge. so loud. my family&#39;s living through a tough time right now, my mother barely sleeps and those midterms made me even more nervous (that kind of nervous when you don&#39;t even want to try to succeed, &#39;cuz it&#39;s so scary -- why on earth am I so afraid? what am I afraid of?). all I&#39;ve been doing this month is yoga (25 days in a row! wow!), breathing and sometimes baking. oh, and I re-watched LOTR one more time! and still I am super-duper proud of myself for how strong I am.

"My 123rd day of consecutive yoga - in that stretch, I have always walked away from each session better than I started. So rejuvenating yoga seems like a redundant term. In my philosophy class today - teach was talking about an orderly universe where everything has a cause &amp; is contingent upon something else &amp; it dawned on me that didn&#39;t apply to miracles or love because if you can break them down then they simply aren&#39;t miraculous or loving.

"For the first time in this 30 day journey I literally dreaded to come onto the mat... It was a really long day full of running around and I was feeling extremely tired. I didn&#39;t think I had  any tools to &quot;rejuvenate&quot; 😂. But again I thought about what Adriene always says; the hardest part is showing up. So I showed up, and I was actually pretty good till the end! Breath of fire always brings such energy to me. However, coming to the end my balance was sooooo off at the last little oblique crunches since I was almost asleep at that point 😂 Still, I was here. I showed up and I have no intention of giving up, this is for me. And thank you 25-mins-ago-me for taking the decision to show up anyways. If anyone ever needs to hear besides me today; Trust the wait and inch by inch you are changing! Hope all of you have an amazing week!",Öykü Elaslan,2021-01-25T20:44:16Z,0

"I am fully able to recognize the strength I have gained physically and mentally from day one until this point. A lot of the mental strength comes in the form of being able to accept when a pose is not within my reach on a certain day, and trusting that I can do a pose on other days even if its the first time Ive attempted it (I rocked the side plank today for the first time in a long time!). Knowing there is a group of like minded individuals who are just trying their best each day, doing this practice alongside me has been so motivating.",Bethany Caliaro,2021-01-25T19:59:28Z,0

It&#39;s a bittersweet feeling knowing this series is coming to an end soon but I am so excited to take everything I&#39;ve learnt forward &amp; keep this daily ritual going - who&#39;s with me?! <br />❤️🧡💛💚💙💜",Angelica,2021-01-25T18:54:39Z,118

"So there’s an invitation to think about what I’m noticing that may be changing.  This is the most consistent i have been with movement/exercise for a long time and it is giving me a sense of stability and level-ness - thats a word I’m sure!  I can sense that i am connected to my WHOLE body in the practice, more easily.  This practice definitely feels like what my body needs right now.  I am noticing more mindful movement off the mat.  Also being kind to myself in my thoughts.  I liked the reminder about noticing what we give energy to.....i thank you for your generosity of spirit in sharing this practice.  Sending love and warmth.

"This is my first comment on this Breath series, because I didn’t want to keep repeating myself.  However, now that we are on our last week, I’ll tell you what a great series this is for beginners OR old folks like me, who is not a beginner but everyone needs tips and reminders about our breathing, because that is the KEY to freaking LIFE!  Adriene, I hate it when spell check always wants to change your name. I’m a Catherine or Cathy.  Don’t do that K thing with me!  I actually injured my right toes practicing Renew, because of my anatomy.  I have flat feet, bunions and callouses, (try not to be jealous) so setting with my toes bent is always a challenge, but I’m getting better with it.  After my practice that day, my right toes bruised badly on top and on bottom so I took it easy yesterday , yet I was able to walk with no discomfort.  Today, I’m horribly bruised but not even fragile so I did 2 videos today to catch up.  What a wonderful addition you’ve been in my life during this pandemic!  And believe me,  I spread the good word about you to anyone who will listen!  I hope that I will always be able to practice with you. 🙏 I celebrate 🎉🥳 you everyday in this yoga room I’ve made myself.  And as we speak, my sweet, good looking handyman is building me a deck because I love practicing outside too!",cathy hollaway,2021-01-25T18:28:46Z,0

Also my forward fold is now more a fold than ever before.  Little by little, the body is responding in a positive way to each and every day of gentle release.

A friend of mine and her whole family has covid and I’ve been so worried and focused on that that I felt like doing something for myself was a selfish move. (I’ve been glued to my phone for updates and if I need to help in anyway) BUT  - today I decided to come back to the mat a redirect my worry and stress into caring for myself it was 25 minutes and I’m better for it. I wish that I had kept coming to the mat these last 10 days I feel like this experience would have been something different. <br />I’m happy I got here, I feel wrung out and new 🤍 going to be catching up on the videos I missed.

This is the fourth year that I&#39;ve started my year with 30 days of yoga.  I think this is my favourite series or maybe it has to do with being in another lock down?   I&#39;m enjoying getting onto the mat each day and feel the movements much more deeply than I ever have.  It&#39;s also interesting that I&#39;ve felt quite emotional at the end of each session. I have no idea why but I&#39;m to the point of tears at the end.   These are strange times.  Thank you for bringing calm into my life exactly when I need it.,Slothy-sloth-sloth,2021-01-25T16:34:04Z,0

"the last 30-day journey I did I tried to get up early every morning to do my yoga right when I get up and I found I was missing many days and it took me two months rather than just one. This time I have been allowing myself to do yoga In the morning, afternoon or right before I go to bed, just wherever it feels right and I haven&#39;t missed a day! sending love in this last week💕",Megan.Major,2021-01-25T16:14:18Z,0
My fire breath isn&#39;t as quick as Adriene&#39;s! I&#39;m wondering if that breath isn&#39;t for me... it leaves me feeling a way I don&#39;t know how to explain? I different kind of energized? Idk. Loved  the practice and had lots of laughs with the balancing attempts today. I feel stronger not just physically but my will power feels stronger from following through on this journey.

"Day 24! I literally did day 23 just before today’s practice and as I found myself initially getting to the mat, I was not very excited. By the end of day 24 it was very satisfying. With each practice there is a new challenge for me that slightly intertwines with the challenges I face off of the mat. I love coming back to this happy place of loving myself and knowing that through these practices I am getting stronger both mentally and physically. I know where I’d be if I hadn’t found you Adriene (or rather if it you hadn’t found me), and knowing that I will never get there fills me with such a great appreciation.

"Sore in the hips, glutes, and hamstrings this morning, but this practice helped stretch out and loosen up...and then I did a version of side plank AND was able to hold it!!!!  Whaat?!?  That. Is. New..  Felt good (and accurate) to say &quot;I am strong.&quot;  Let&#39;s go Monday!",Diane Nutting,2021-01-25T13:32:42Z,0
"I was overcome with emotion today when I looked over to see my love in a side plank. I&#39;ve always espoused the healing virtues of yoga, but she was not so in to it. Two years ago we were shaken to our core with by breast cancer. It was a tough time for us, but thank God she is a survivor. This year she decided to join me for the 30 day challenge, and today she was fully extended in vasisthasana. This is what strength looks like. Much gratitude to YWA and this online community. Be blessed.",John Welch,2021-01-25T13:31:15Z,327

"This is my first &quot;serious&quot; commitment to a 30-day challenge and it&#39;s full of good and bad. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m even doing this right. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m feeling the things I&#39;m supposed to be feeling in my body. Of course, I&#39;m sure the extra fat I&#39;m wearing doesn&#39;t help. I do feel a bit stronger and everyday movements feel much lighter and easier. However, I do not  physically feel &quot;lighter&quot;, nor do I look it. I&#39;m still having problems getting into a lunge without A LOT of adjustment and then catch-up to get to the pose. And I think I just did my first side plank! (is that what we did? really? YAY!) One thing I do know...I can&#39;t continue with a daily practice. It&#39;s just too much - I need a rest day now and then. I started walking regularly a few months ago just to get outside for some sun and fresh air. I walk approx. 2x per week and my pace has improved over time. I think I will begin the weight loss series after this, pacing myself according to what my body is saying to me. At the end of the day, I&#39;m exercising. I&#39;m moving. I&#39;m slowly gaining strength and confidence. Baby steps. Thank you, Adriene 🤍",Kat Nolan,2021-01-25T11:56:49Z,130
"I am over a week behind on finishing the 30 days and the reason is I pushed myself too far and forgot the first rule of yoga... non violence, to others, but also equally important, to yourself. As a result, I hurt my back and had trouble even standing up for days. Don&#39;t do what I did. Do what is best for you! There are many adjustments that can be made to make a pose suit your needs. Wherever you are, and however often you practice, is a good thing!",Maureen Yonovitz,2021-02-05T15:33:58Z,1
"Totally agree. I am not caring extra weight but somehow have always been quite stiff. It’s fine though cos I’m not on some stage.

Saying this just out of my experience as I had also done this mistake. I personally prefer doing 30 days yoga series. For weight loss, series are perfect along with healthy nutritious diet",kamalprit singh,2021-01-30T07:04:45Z,1
"I&#39;m proud of you. I think we can follow Adriene&#39;s lead with a gentle reminder to ourselves that there is no &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; on this journey. Just see where this takes you, and find what feels good :) What I&#39;m trying to do is make this less about &quot;weight loss&quot; and more about making time to develop a relationship with myself. Valuing myself. Whatever the scale says, if you focus on those things,  this will be a transformative experience of self love and care.",Sajida,2021-01-26T04:26:15Z,2

"Thank you Precious Adriene, my Yoga Guru, my Journey with you on this 30 Days and with the rest of the Beautiful People in the World, you have enlightened me through this Month the deeper meaning of the Body, Mind and Soul uniting as one in Yoga, the importance of the basic tool of &#39;Breath&#39; which is a passive aspect in our Life we take, or rather I take for granted.  I see the sole purpose of Yoga is, Breath, is like the music to our actions if used as you demonstrate so Beautifully.  I am slowly incorporating your teaching and trying real hard to integrate and marry the two &#39;Breath&#39; with &#39;Action&#39;.  I so love your mantra &#39;Breathe Love in, Breathe Love out&#39;, very inclusive and sharing freely with all.  Kudos to you my Guru. Thanks hun. ❤️ much Love.

It&#39;s nice to be reminded of the beauty of simply taking time to rejuvenate and be with yourself.

"So proud of all 1400 people who practiced with me today and everyone else who will do Yoga today. This was more challenging than I thought, but in a good way. I never thought I could hold a side plank this stable and long. Love to you all xx I am looking forward to this last week but also sad because I won‘t get to read all the new comments right after the videos go up.",dazzzlingworld,2021-01-25T06:28:27Z,2

Of course! There are many beginners here! Yoga is for everyone! And you can do it whenever you want to. I mostly do it in the morning right after I get up but that’s really up to you. Hope you enjoy it! 🤗,Cara Noé,2021-01-25T06:33:54Z,0
"Hey there! This is my first 30 day „challenge“ and I would definitely consider myself a beginner, having only done a few videos at home before and I‘ve never taken a class. On my free days I do it right after I get up but when I have to work I do it in the evening before I go to bed. So I would say, whatever fits best in your schedule. It helps to not see it as a chore or workout that has to be done but as time set aside just for you to start the day or relax. I hope you enjoy it!",dazzzlingworld,2021-01-25T06:33:27Z,0
"This 30 day journey has been so wonderful and I have grown so much already. I feel proud after setting aside time for yoga. Even if nothing else goes right or I don&#39;t get any work done that day, I always do the daily video and it feels so good to have accomplished something! I am so grateful for you Adriene, Benji, and all the people practicing around the world. Namaste from Portland, OR &lt;3",Alice Lawless,2021-01-25T06:12:01Z,0

"Can’t believe this is the last week already. I am going to miss the exchange with all of you! It’s definitely part of the reason I stick to the daily practice. Day 24, let’s do this! 🤗<br /><br />Edit: I opened my eyes for a second while doing breath of fire and saw your shirt ‘inflate’ like a little balloon 🎈 That made me laugh and gather energy to stick to it. I love how your videos are always not only relaxing but also fun!",Cara Noé,2021-01-25T06:00:30Z,178
While Adriene won&#39;t be updating daily there&#39;s going to be a monthly calender to follow consisting of older videos (at least that&#39;s how it has been for the last 3 years since I first joined a 30 days of yoga with adriene). There&#39;s always people following the calenders. I would recommend sorting the comments by newest comments first (option somewhere on top of the comment section) and you will see there&#39;s people doing the videos with you everyday. :-),Katharina Kettmann,2021-01-26T16:55:34Z,0
@Tosha O&#39;Neal Oh I‘m definitely staying but it’s just not the same if we‘re not all doing the same video. Because Adriene won’t upload daily I guess. That would be so much work!! :0,Cara Noé,2021-01-25T21:52:52Z,1
