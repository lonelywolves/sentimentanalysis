"I am currently feeling tormented by a dismaying thought and being that I find much solace and perspective in your words and guidance and you have as such somehow become a yogini to me - like it or not, I would ask a rather morbid question. If it were that you were watching the TV news - footage of a runaway fire, with a close up view of a bunny (for instance) fraught with terror, frantically trying to escape the blaze – to no avail, most of us would immediately change the channel, if however it was your very own fragile child in the place of the rabbit, would you still be able look away. How do you refrain from being consumed by hatred when you then see the fire-starter strutting around without the slightest sign of remorse, in fact every time you look they are lighting up another fire. But then when you look a little closer you see that you are the remorseless fire-starter the fragile child and even the rabbit. God is the one watching the horror scene on the telly <br />Namaste lovely Adriene.",Christ saevio,2021-05-08T22:22:24Z,0

"I haven&#39;t done yoga for about more than a week now and that time I was away from the mat was painful, I couldn&#39;t handle my thoughts and just the thought of catching up on the practices I missed made me reluctant to get on my mat. But today, I finally got to my mat and did the practice for today, I told myself &quot; just do what you need to today, don&#39;t worry about yesterday.&quot; I forgot how amazing and relieved I feel when I practice with Adriene and when she said I love you, i felt my eyes tear up, and i have never felt that before during yoga. I guess this &quot;break&quot; (more of laziness actually) from yoga made me realise it&#39;s importance to me and my body. I love you so much Adriene, and thank you for being there, always.<br />Jasmeet 💜",Jasmeet Kaur,2021-05-04T18:23:52Z,4

Question about hips - does anyone’s hips pop when they do the legs-core thing?? Not every time but most times mine does. It doesn’t necessarily hurt but I can feel it. Same if I was in reclined cobblers pose and took my torso (but not my legs) out of it. Can that be prevented / is it bad? I don’t have tight hips and I love to stretch them,pdille22,2021-05-04T14:40:51Z,0
"Yes! Mine does every time we do a &quot;lift/lower the leg while on the back&quot; move. Mostly my left but sometimes my right too. My hips aren&#39;t tight either, not sure what causes it or if I can prevent it other than subtly shifting the angle a bit?",Cecilia Kautzman,2021-05-04T19:08:34Z,0

It is how we react to what is happening that is important. I have noticed a distinct difference through practice. Despite the situation going on physically in my head, I have been upbeat and generally happy.

"very good video !! I agree because Regular yoga practice can help you stay calm and relaxed in daily life, and can also give you the strength to face events as they come without getting restless. Yoga practice ideally includes the complete package of asanas (body postures), pranayamas (breathing techniques), meditation, and the ancient yoga philosophy, all of which has helped several anxiety patients recover and face life with new positivity and strength.<br /><br />for tips and trick that targets the root biological cause of social anxiety<br />so you can stop being nervous, awkward and quiet around people, visit this site:<a href=""https://t.co/pdzk7CjuRh?amp=1"">https://t.co/pdzk7CjuRh?amp=1</a>",Stefania Hagendijk,2020-10-03T10:06:55Z,12

"This video and Yoga with Adriene in general has changed my life. <br />I was doing a youtube workout (one of those 28 day challenges. I won&#39;t say who it was.) and in the middle of it, I just felt so... defeated. Like everything I was doing was a competition. And because I was not the best or the strongest or the most conventionally attractive, why bother? <br />So I was brave and stopped the workout. I stopped punishing myself. I came to this video because I am very anxious and promised myself I would get through this video. It was only 20 minutes-- I could afford to spend 20 minutes on myself. I figured the world probably wouldn&#39;t implode. <br />And I did the video. And ngl, tears were coming out of my eyes. I felt reconnected to myself in a way that I never have. I do not have a good relationship with my body. ... But yoga videos like these remind me that my body is good too. Because it simply is. <br />Thank you Adriene.",Jeannie,2020-05-31T17:45:02Z,1

This was a beautiful practice. Thank you. I would like to request a “server yoga” practice or something for those who work in service and hospitality: bussers cooks dishwashers etc. We work long hours on our feet and do repetitive tasks and carry heavy loads. So many of my coworkers have rocks where their shoulders should be ; )   Maybe a shorter practice so their are no excuses lol. People who serve others tend to struggle to take the time to serve them selves. But whatever a long practice would be awesome too! Gosh I’m not trying to tell you how to do your job 😬 anything would be amazing. I am about to train a new crop of servers and I would love to make part of their training to be to do your video before their shift. Anyway.

"I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you so much for these videos. You do amazing work with so much thought and joy put into it and poor schlubs like me get to benefit from it for free. These videos are life saving for me.<br /><br />If you ever need an idea for a new sequence, I think one tailored for people in the service industry (like waitresses and bartenders) would be excellent.

"I have been doing your videos for a while now, and I just had a week off. I felt really anxious and have just been struggling to prioritise what I need. I realised that the practice has been so beneficial, so I dragged myself back on the mat this morning and found this video. It was perfect for how I have been feeling.

"Thank you Adriene! I&#39;ve been subscribed to your Channel for years now and I literally just got diagnosed with fibromyalgia. I&#39;ve had the symptoms for over 10 years. I noticed that doing yoga really made me feel better but I always felt too anxious to do a class, hence I found your Channel! It really has changed my life. After completing about 4 or 5 rounds of your 30 days yoga classes I finally got the courage to step in a yoga class in my neighborhood studio about a year ago! Now I have a lot of friends and I am working to understanding my fibromyalgia symptoms. I&#39;ll keep on doing yoga with you though because it really helps!",Elena Llinas,2019-03-06T19:08:30Z,2
"You&#39;ve such a talent! I keep coming back to your channel, no matter how many services and online classes I try. They all seem so perfect, and I&#39;m not that flexible and not that tiny, so it can be hard for me to get into many poses. I&#39;ve cried and quit during a workout because I just couldn&#39;t get into the pose. But you&#39;re so encouraging and reminded me that it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect. And I&#39;ve flown through your hour long sessions and it felt like only 20mins. <br />Of all the beginner seasons I&#39;ve tried, yours is truly the best between doable and challenging I&#39;ve tried. <br />You&#39;re the reason I haven&#39;t given up yet ♡",Rachel Sallee,2019-03-06T18:22:45Z,1

I wish I could go back to the days when I believed the guy actually liked me and I wasn&#39;t just the practice girl. When I thought if I were nice to the cool girls they&#39;d certainly have no reason to not be nice to me back. I wish I didn&#39;t know exactly what the employer was thinking as I&#39;m excused from the job interview. I wish people would understand social anxiety isn&#39;t just shyness or a lack of self confidence. It&#39;s a condition slowly formed into our beings through life experiences. 🕉️,Elizabeth Villegas,2019-03-06T15:44:53Z,2

"Loved the huggy, stretchy core work at the end! Does anyone have good tips for the interlace the fingers behind back / forward fold shape? I don&#39;t think my shoulders are that tight, but I feel like I always have to force that pose and my hands go numb. Adriene doesn&#39;t suggest any modifications or even acknowledge that it might be hard for some people, like she does with other postures, so I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s just me and there&#39;s a simple fix. Thanks, everyone! Love this community.",Richelle Wilson,2019-03-04T00:47:40Z,0

"<b>Hi Adrienne! Thank you so much for making yoga focused on certain aspects of Our Lives that could use some Rejuvenation and healing. My question is, how do you go about selecting the stretches, and exercise is needed for some of these issues? How do you create a flow for that?</b>",theFitty,2019-03-03T14:29:15Z,5
"@Sarah Harvey wow, that was really beautifully put. :-) Thanks for Sharing!",theFitty,2019-03-08T13:19:48Z,0
"My guess is she thinks about the emotions involved and how the stretch can help, eg forward folds are relaxing to the nervous system, shoulder and neck releases are good since anxiety / stress often manifest there, the focus on the tummy since anxiety manifests in the gut stomach issues nauseous feeling etc and to be more aware of our inner power and inner fire, the heart space to remember we are a vessel of love. The hip stretches as psoas are known to be tight due to emotional holding. What YWA does is much more than picking and choosing a set of stretches, if anything I would say it&#39;s more about Adrienne herself, the love she gives, the words of inspiration etc.",Sarah Harvey,2019-03-08T12:14:32Z,1

"Thank you so much for this Adriene, this is the type of session that reminds me that I am capable of whatever I put my mind into and that I am more than my anxieties. &lt;3 <br><br>I also have a request for a future video! I am working in the video game industry and me and one of my colleagues are trying to start an initiative in our office for weekly yoga-sessions. Video game development is one of those typical professions that is in a big need of doing exercises like yoga; sitting in front of a computer all day, bad posture... Would really love to see a video tailored to this type of profession! :)",Matilda Larsson Westerdahl,2019-03-03T10:00:49Z,2

CBT is cognitive behavioral therapy. CBD is an oil in cannabis that helps a lot with anxiety and doesn&#39;t give you a high like THC does. but CBT is also freaking great,Mar W,2019-03-08T21:59:20Z,6

Thanks!<br />Unrelated: Five days a week, I use three of your videos to stretch my hips, back, neck, and shoulders. Since I started a few weeks ago, my chronic pain has reduced SO MUCH. You are a god send. Also much love to Benji ❤️",Jennie Whalen,2019-03-03T06:14:36Z,173
"I also suffer from chronic pain and also have been using these videos, and they&#39;ve been immensely helpful. Currently doing the dedicate 30 day series. I wonder how related anxiety and chronic pain are? While I have chronic pain, a close relative deals with chronic anxiety, and I know I have a tendency towards anxiety myself... If I understand correctly, a lot of times chronic pain is caused by inflammation which is the overstimulation of the immune system, and anxiety seems to be an overstimulation of the mind.... just spitting some stuff out there, would be curious to hear your thoughts.",Michael Lees,2019-03-03T18:44:15Z,0

"Right on time yet again. Well, almost. I&#39;ve been anxious of the people around me cause i prefer to live by certain rules i have come to make myself follow over a certain time period and they&#39;ve been pushing me to get back to my old way of life where i had no sense of time management whatsoever. I feel like i&#39;m fighting a social battle against people around me all  by myself to get them to understand my vision but i know they never will. I&#39;d never give in or doubt my vision though no matter what they do to steer me off of it. Thanks for being the patient listener, kind guide, and wise mentor you are Adriene. Much love.
