"This practice was honestly so good, somehow I feel like Adriene always knows exactly what we need and the days we need it on. I was going through a hard break up the last couple months and yesterday, when my ex asked me to see him again, I was able to just think it through calmly and turn him down without getting anxious or reacting super emotionally and it made me feel like all the daily yoga I&#39;ve been doing is really, truly keeping me grounded and safe. I always know I can come back to this mat and be at peace with myself, I&#39;ve learned to love myself more because of that, and let go of things that don&#39;t make me happy. And it&#39; s all thanks to Adriene and her sweet, funny guidance (I laughed at loud during this video with the singing haha). Thank you for everything Adrene, my life has become a lot more less stressed and happier since I found you! And my posture improved so much!!",silly samira,2021-03-25T07:49:27Z,2

"Day 20! I have a mild fever/cold but I am here. It makes me smile that I&#39;ve stuck to this challenge. Just an update: my posture was terrible beforehand, like an elderly woman. But now it&#39;s so much better. It&#39;s a little easier to hold myself up. I feel like my upper back muscles are stronger. My core is stronger but I think that&#39;s because of Spin and my body workouts, and of course Yoga :) It&#39;s amazing. I feel stronger, and somewhat more at peace with my days.",Belle Princess,2021-03-22T08:43:00Z,0

"Ok, I just had a revelation when you said, “Feel these thigh bones snuggle up into socket.” Completely changed this posture for me.

"I always thought about doing yoga, but never did yoga until this 30 days of yoga. I&#39;m on day 20 and it&#39;s changed my life. I was a bit lost in lockdown here in the UK.  I had other worries and needed a new structure. I now wake up for me, I don&#39;t wake up for work to just log on to the laptop. That was the highlight of my day but now yoga has changed my outlook and focus  on each day. It&#39;s helping me with my weight loss journey too. Adriene keep doing what you do.

"Day 20: such a NICE practice.<br /><br />Took a couple of days off for a three-day migraine, but this was a good way to get back into it.  It always feels a little weird, if I miss a day or two right before a &#39;soft&#39; practice like this one, because oh, why couldn&#39;t I have just done it a couple of days ago, why do I need a restful practice if I just rested for three days--but that&#39;s not necessarily the point.  Even if I&#39;ve spent a couple of days being quiet, the moment to just BE PRESENT is worth so much. <br /><br />This month (last month, the rest of this month, however long it takes me to get through this sequence, whatever I come to next) is a journey, but I&#39;m always reminding myself that a journey doesn&#39;t need to just be about its destination.  Am I getting better at yoga?  Yes.  Is just <i>doing the thing</i> worthwhile, whether I learn or not, whether my knowledge or practice is changed or not, just for the sake of doing it?  YES.  I become a little more, learn a little more, change a little more, every time I do this, but it doesn&#39;t have to be about who I am becoming.  Sometimes it&#39;s just about who I am being.",Clarity C,2021-02-02T19:26:39Z,0

It really helped! I&#39;ve found myself quite a few times coming back to the breath, I really love your focus on mindfullness in this journey. Thank you, Adriene!",Laneybug,2021-02-02T00:58:06Z,3

I do have a bit of a hard time inhaling slowly, because I always seem to quickly run out of space in my lungs to fill with air, but I always have SO MUCH air to let out (could breath out for almost 20 seconds easily). Anyone else experience this or have tips for a slower inhale? Also i have a hard time taking a real deep breath into my belly, I feel like I usually get more air when I breath into my chest, although I know a belly breath is supposed to be better.",Katie DePietro,2021-01-31T00:45:23Z,1

"You know, I struggled with yoga 2 years ago. I found it boring and slow. I didn&#39;t understand what the teachers where talking about, I felt silly and awkward. Then a friend suggested I do a yoga teacher training course. I thought &quot;why not?&quot; .....a month before the course and my flight to India, I realised I had never practiced yoga before so I better start now. Then I found yoga with Adriene and I did my first 30 day yoga challenge. Her expansions and hints at more deeper spiritual connections during the practice really helped me to create a small foundation before I jumped into the deep end. That month in India was the hardest, physically and mentally, I have ever worked. I loved it so much. <br />In 2019 I did my second YTTC to learn again, and now I&#39;m doing my second 30 day yoga challenge with Adriene, and I can really feel the difference. I still struggle with my self practice, I don&#39;t want to teach (I only did the YTTC for more in-depth knowledge) so Adriene&#39;s course is really amazing in keeping me grounded in my practice and present. <br />So thank you Adriene for being there at the start of my journey and now as I continue to learn and grow.<br />Lots of love.",Jourdan Art,2021-01-29T20:15:14Z,0

"This breath training is so perfect in general but also as a singer it&#39;s very connected to the breathing exercises we use. I had started reintroducing these exercises recently as I had lost some strength there but was failing to do it every day and now with this daily practice and strengthening the core it couldn&#39;t be more perfect. Since Day 1 I have been so much more aware of how I stand when I&#39;m doing simple things like pouring my coffee, feeling the even weight in my feet, and even walking differently - hip bones and heart forward and lighter on the feet and notice some lower back pains starting to fade. I&#39;m just so surprised at how much I WANT to do this everyday even when it&#39;s hard. Thank you.",Visobel Black,2021-01-28T13:12:55Z,1

"There are times when I can hear Adriene&#39;s smile in her voice and it just tickles me. I was doing the breathing technique and thoroughly enjoying it. Right after the comment about softening the muscles in the face (which felt exquisite - I&#39;m usually shocked when my attention is brought to my facial muscles how crunched up and tensed they are, and releasing that feels so good), Adiene was counting, and I heard the smile in the count of &quot;two&quot; and I just started grinning from ear to ear. That was wonderful too. I then proceeded to try to soften the muscles in my face again. haha. Fantastic 16 minutes.",Devan Fronk,2021-01-23T04:28:07Z,0

How I react to certain situations and to try and center myself when I feel I’m falling off.”<br />Adriene you are a kind soul and thank you for all that you share💙✨ Namaste",Samantha T,2021-01-22T23:32:19Z,0

"I have come to realize that even when doing my yoga, it is hard to pause and actually feel my body. Yes, even when I breathe through each pose. My mind is elsewhere as a new mom wondering about the baby napping or playing in front of me or my to do lists that never seem to be able to get done. I disassociate so much and easily. I feel as if I’m just kind of floating through/ going through the motions of life these days. I know I need to pause and slow down, but then even less stuff gets done. I also have 2 amazing mini poodles that bark at every noise in the hallway or outside and I’m constantly yelling no. I also am trying to still reconnect with myself and who I am now after giving birth and becoming a mom (my baby is 5.5 months old now). I feel as if my vulnerability, especially in my center, is putting up a shield. These yoga classes so far are helpful, but I still am struggling to connect with my body and self. The nervous system operates 7 times slower than thought. I know. Thee answer is slowing down. Why is this so challenging? &lt;3 Thank you for listening/reading if you did. &lt;3",Jennifer Lynn Carter,2021-01-22T19:25:19Z,1

"I found my exquisite moment of total stillness today for the first time!!! To all those who have kept on this path faithfully and to all those who have taken a literal pause in this journey as they find a way to fit themselves through this practice into their daily routine, you are right where you are meant to be. You pause so you can return to movement with a greater appreciation for the ebb and flow of life. In my past experiences practicing 30 days, I had to take a few days off, no motivation, cravong laziness, my body hurting from its monthly cycle, but this is the first sequence of 30 days where that hasn&#39;t happened yet. I think this is the first time I&#39;ll make it fully and completely. But I cherish the beginning where I listened to my body, craving toxicity for a couple days, before jumping back into this healthy, nourishing practice. We have to see the dark before we can truly see the light. And even then, we need both within us and around us to live the fullest life. Namaste, all of you beautiful souls at different paths on this journey. Be well. Make this journey yours.",peach fuzz,2021-01-22T14:26:23Z,0

"Adriene - today is my mom’s birthday. She would be 65 today but she passed away when she was 59. I almost skipped today because I am spending the evening with her doing some of the favorite things we would do together, but since I saw “pause” I decided to join. Surprisingly, you made me feel ever closer to her tonight. When you told us to look at our beautiful selves - I’ve always been complimented for having my mom’s beauty. She was the most beautiful person, inside and out, I’ve ever known. And then your wonderfully goofy personality when you sang, what I think is, a Whitney Houston song. My mom instilled in me to be goofy and authentic and to always have fun. That’s a huge reason why I do yoga with you. I get your personality, and it feels real to me. Thank you, for somehow magically bringing me even closer to the unforgettable Tina tonight.",Natasha Buffo,2021-01-22T03:08:34Z,3

It turns out I got my period on the day it was time to give blood. Figured this practice was perfect since you shouldn&#39;t do any tough exercise on your blood giving-day, but my body started feeling strange just from breath retention, like never before. Right at the end I realised I would faint if it continued any longer. I do hope others remember that going forward and recognize the feeling sooner than I, especially if you have naturally low blood pressure like me.",Ewessa,2021-01-21T23:47:06Z,0
"The song you said during this practice that goes “how do I know if he really loves me”, that came on the radio right before this practice and it connected with me that the universe works in mysterious ways. It made me smile, thanks Adriene🤍",Lydia Blum,2021-01-21T23:46:08Z,3

Thank you so much for this beautiful practice today Adriene! Today has been okay so far but I’ve definitely done my share of crying today. There’s so much pent up emotions I didn’t know about. I feel so vulnerable right now. But this is a part of the healing process once all these emotions have finally had their moments to be felt; I can’t even tell you how excited (but terrified at the same time) to finally be on my journey to recovery! This practice was perfect for today. Thank you so much Adriene I love you and pray that God is working in your life! 💕💕💕,Annika Ewing,2021-01-21T23:42:35Z,1

I don’t know about anyone else but I came to the mat with a lot of emotions and insecurities today. I even found myself having a BIG cry whilst in cobblers pose. But that’s why practises like today are so important to me. I needed to pause from being ‘ a big brave girl’ and not letting little actions and words of other people effect me. I actually feel better now I gave myself that time to be sad. This yoga journey is doing wonders for me!,The Junk Box,2021-01-21T23:38:47Z,0

"Well this is weird. I&#39;m following these classes online for about five years and never posted a comment, but as I try to practice this breath retention I have to admit this is very difficult for me and I don&#39;t understant why. I&#39;m in my mid-twenties, healthy, no smoking etc but... I can help but feeling like I&#39;m drowning when I&#39;m doing this. How can I explain better with my not so good english... It&#39;s, especially when I retain the breath after the exhale, it&#39;s like I&#39;m having a panic attack or something, I keep telling to myself &quot;you&#39;re not gonna die&quot; but it feels like it. Really, like I&#39;m drowning, and after that it&#39;s very difficult not to inhale in a hurry. And so I&#39;m here trying to do this exercice and just this kind of breathing make me all hot and sweety and very discomfort, much more than abs work. So, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m doing this badly or if it&#39;s my heart naturaly beating faster, or If it&#39;s my natural anxiety coming to say hello. Anyway, I wanted to share my experience. I also want to add a beautiful thank you, merci, namaste to Adriene and this channel, which I&#39;m following every single day for yes, I think, five years now (everybody around me is saying : you are doing yoga EVERYDAY ? Waou ! I just want to respond that I HAVE TO otherwise I would be a mess) It has help me managing my anger, my anxiety, my mood swings, and help me have a stronger body. My mind is still not at peace but I&#39;m slow : starting with the body to ease the mind, because the hardest part is always, always always the mind... Again : Thank you. You are a life saver. <br />Sending love, light and prayers from France.",Armelle Dufau,2021-01-21T22:53:33Z,0

"This is something that I definitely need to work at.  I wasn&#39;t judging myself, but I just noticed that during the counted breaths (and I noticed it the other day too but didn&#39;t connect what I was doing until today) that towards the end, especially with the inhale that I didn&#39;t feel like I could pull in any more air so I just held the breath up there until Adriene started the exhale.  I&#39;m visualizing as we&#39;re doing these breath cycles and I know that it will slowly come and honestly I feel that this is increasing my patience with myself. &lt;3 &lt;3",Tricia A,2021-01-21T22:37:44Z,0

Finally made it - Was in the middle of the well needed breath counts, as my battery powered speaker died 😑 Had to abort, get up and reset the sound... then I backed up the video and restarted my breaths. Almost got all the way through - then my wifi, thus the video died 😑 Some days, huh?! I cussed.. and decided to start all over again to get through the important practice with all my focus.

Even day to day things like putting the key in the door, I&#39;m not rushing to get in the house, I&#39;m doing things a lot more chilled out and little things don&#39;t stress me out.

"Absolutely loved trying out breath retention! <br /><br />I have missed two practices up until now due to feeling physically unwell. One was early on and the other was yesterday&#39;s practice. It&#39;s always a struggle getting back to the mat after skipping a day and today&#39;s practice was a perfect one to keep things going. During today&#39;s breath work my thoughts went to the days I missed and I noticed I was kind to myself and I was okay with just picking it back up today. <br />I wanted to share this because normally I would think &quot;it&#39;s a 30 day yoga challenge I <b>have</b> to do it everyday!&quot; and I would either beat myself up for missing a day or try to play catch up, making mental arrangements thinking &quot;alright so the one I missed was 25 mins, maybe I can add that onto day x?&quot;. Somehow I would think that if I don&#39;t do it <i>perfectly</i> that would take away from the worth of the challenge and in today&#39;s pause I realized I had let go of that notion. <br /><br />So this is for anyone out there who shares similar unhelpful perfectionist tendencies (myself included): remember you are doing this for yourself. Whatever shape or form you choose to take part in this is valid. You are allowed to modify it in a way that fits you, whether that is skipping a day or even two, following a more extended schedule or taking heavy modifications during practice, it is all okay. Well done for keeping at it in a way that serves you &lt;3",Saziye Tasdemir,2021-01-21T22:06:54Z,0

For anyone enjoying the concept of the “pause” I recommend reading Mans Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankel. It’s an emotional read since it’s a true story about the Holocaust but it’s very powerful. Frankel talks about how the space between stimuli and our action is where our power lies. It’s where our power to choose comes from instead of just acting impulsively.,My Bubbles,2021-01-21T21:53:08Z,22

"On the porch of my grandmother&#39;s summer cottage in the woods in Pennsylvania is a poster that I love: a child and an adult on a porch swing, and the word &quot;PAUSE.&quot; This practice brought it to my mind even though I have not been there for a year and a half because I live in Scotland and the pandemic has not allowed me to travel this year. With my eyes closed as you talked me through this breathing exercise I pictured that porch, and the woodland village where I have spent almost every summer since I was born, and I sat through this practice breathing but with tears streaming down my cheeks: imagining myself there, and promising myself, that when I am able to return, I will sit there and breathe and PAUSE as you have guided me to do, and remember this day and think how lucky I am to be healthy and to have these things in my life.",Elizabeth Gatland,2021-01-21T21:48:10Z,0

"I needed a pause today.  Evaluation at work, teaching during these times, working on a second masters and feeling a little at sea.

I really loved this retention practice. You have to have more discipline and awareness after each pause as to not fully exhale or fully inhale after the hold. You have to remember that you still have 4-3 more seconds to go and you have to be strong and patient with your breath.,Katya Vargas,2021-01-21T21:21:39Z,0

"Halfway through the breathing exercise I felt this release of serotonin and I started giggling to myself because I just felt good. It was weird, if someone had been watching me they’d be like why’s this crazy lady giggling to herself like that? I’ll definitely be doing that often. I’ve already noticed that when I step outside I appreciate the air and the sky more and I actively take conscious breaths just to find myself in any given moment, this practice was much needed today.

Don&#39;t be in a rut, don&#39;t set an expectation, just be here.",Laura O'Neal,2021-01-21T19:46:44Z,0

"I had a really hard time today showing up on the mat. I was frustrated trying to breathe. And then I said to myself &#39;It&#39;s OK, just do the best you can do today&#39;, so I curled up in child&#39;s pose and was breathing there with you. And that is a whole new dimension to my everyday yoga practice, it took me years to discover, and it&#39;s thanks to you.",LaraSch,2021-01-21T19:44:13Z,46

"I had to skip the breathing part again, but I think I figured out why it gives me anxiety (and a panic attack if I push through carelessly): Trying to breathe to someone else&#39;s count makes me hyper focus on my breath, which causes me to tighten my airways, which feels like a panic attack, so it triggers a panic attack. I think I need to work on my own on slowing my breath down without hyper focusing on it. I&#39;m also going to talk to my therapist to see what she thinks. Learning this in the comfort of my own home was good. I would have a very hard time coming back to yoga if I experienced this for the first time in a public class.

I am so enjoying this 30 day journey with not only Adriene but all of you. I find that my new found yoga practice is giving me more strength and flexibility then the many years at the gym or any exercise workout I have done.

And I see others post with the same feeling. It&#39;s just incredible!<br /><br />Thank you for all that you do! 💞",haleigh1215,2021-01-21T16:16:48Z,1

"Thank you Adrienne,  this was the perfect compliment to yesterday’s practice of strength.  (I did both practices today, because I couldn’t take me eyes off the inauguration festivities yesterday).  After doing the breathing exercises, I was finally able to “hug the low ribs in” on the one downward dog.  The containment felt good.  Thanks too, for reminder to pause during the day.  I find so much more beauty in the world when I just take the time to see it.","Beth Larsen, Flute",2021-01-21T16:06:40Z,1

"Just before this practice I encountered a stressful moment. I immediately noticed how I reacted to the situation, and was pleasantly surprised to recognize that I allowed myself to pause and acknowledge that it is not as big of a deal as my past self would like to believe. Then I took this class and laughed at how perfectly it all fit together. What a beautiful journey for us to be on together.

"So much I want to share after today&#39;s practice!  It&#39;s uncanny how the daily practice always seems to know just what I need: I strained my wrist yesterday (playing video games, not in practice) and today&#39;s massage and staying off the hands was exactly what I needed. (And I started massaging my feet automatically—before the prompt. Though that was funny.) <br /><br />I wanted to learn more about Kumbhaka as well. What are the benefits and how can I integrate it into my practice? Is it primarily a meditative breath or is it also used during asana practice?<br /><br /><br />I also wanted to share a little story about taking moments of pause off the mat. In general, I&#39;ve noticed that after months of Yoga with Adriene I find myself pausing for longer and being more mindful about how I react. This week I was able to see the fruits of that work on myself in a very measurable way: I was feeling hurt by two different friends not being as in touch as I would have liked. In the past, I&#39;ve let my temper get the better of me. But THIS time, instead of being angry and reactive, I was able to pause and take the time to express my feelings and vulnerability in an honest, respectful, and constructive manner. Both of them listened and heard me and we were able to talk about what was bothering me and how we can do better—instead of fighting and exchanging angry words.<br /><br />I&#39;m really proud of that and also really thankful to you for this gift, Adriene.",David Finkelstein,2021-01-21T13:08:37Z,0

These series are making me connect again with my breath. Is it possible that my skin looks better and glowing because of the 20 days we&#39;ve been practicing focusing on our breath? it looks like it but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s something my mind does like when you go to a gym one day and you already see yourself fitter lol.

"Day 20: Pause, did ya’ll pause today? This world is so fast paced, so much so that I sometimes forget what it’s like to be alive today and just notice my surroundings. Be in the present moment. This practice was a favourite. Who knew that a little pause could do such wonders? Sending to everyone out there, hope it finds you ♥️",Raphah Raysa,2021-01-21T10:38:57Z,230
"Yesterday, bringing the trash can in from the curb, I hung out with a respectably sized grass spider. She and I paused together, and I marveled that here she is...up and moving around. Remarkable, since we just had a foot and a half of snow two weeks ago.",Susan Ikehara,2021-02-12T13:50:55Z,1
So true. If we pause for a minute we can always see a small wonder somewhere around us. For me it&#39;s the sea and the birds that always bring me back to the present moment ♥️,Francesca Neroni,2021-01-21T22:56:21Z,4

Thank you for only one downward facing dog. Before I read the email I though that my wrists need some break so I&#39;m grateful.<br />But after that breathing exercise it was much easier to take a breath in downward dog. And it always makes me feel dizzy.<br />I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s only 10 days left! How is that possible?<br />Thank you for today!,Osoroshii,2021-01-21T10:31:51Z,0
"This was so short again. But it did help me realize that the length and intensity of the practice is not the focus. It&#39;s really staying with that breath, whether is forced, heavy, light or easy. I may not have stayed as consistent as I would like, but it seems that whenever I return to this, the practice of the day is exactly what I needed.

You will loosen up. When I find myself looking or noticing tightness (my hips in my case) i also notice my breathing shortens-it&#39;s frustrating but that is what we are working on. You will feel more and more relaxed,kris law,2021-01-21T22:08:21Z,0
"Hang in there guys, even sukhasana gets easier the more you practice, I was always tense when I first started. But even sitting a certain way uses different muscles than you&#39;re used too. Try to keep ur legs out from your body a bit, that way, when you look down, your legs should be in a triangle shape ish, with ur pelvis being the tip of the triangle, if your anything like me haha. Hope that helps. Namaste 🙏",TMNTsamurai 84,2021-01-21T18:13:28Z,0

"@E Tristram I understand that it’s hard for you to talk about it. Society taught us to keep it to ourselves and even feel ashamed. Women are not supposed to take up space. But that narrative is not okay. Bleeding from your vagina is the most normal thing ever. It means we’re healthy. It means we can have kids. Like how amazing is that? 😯 and for anyone that doesn’t want kids: Periods can be painful enough so we should at least be able to talk about it! Keeping it to ourselves makes us feel like we’re alone with the experience which is simply not true! Nowadays I talk about my period whenever I want to, even in public. And I have a loud voice!😂 It’s not my responsibility whether people are uncomfortable hearing about it or not. It’s a normal topic and we need to work towards a society where we can talk about it without receiving strange looks. The period and talking about it aren’t the problems. The stigma and lack of elucidation is! Sending love &amp; strength to you to comfortably live your truth! (btw I’m not saying everyone has to talk about their period. It’s more about the freedom to talk about it if you want to)",Cara Noé,2021-01-21T11:39:38Z,0

If you still struggle with breathing try focusing on emptying your lungs as much as you can and then allow the body to suck the air back in rather than focussing on breathing in. This way you will become aware of the diaphragm so you are not chest breathing,Gary Williams UK,2021-01-21T10:25:56Z,8
I am just so wowed by the starting session each day...Its so different than every other class out there....<br />You just create a aura of your own and we guys are sucked inside into YWA world..<br />Thank You and Much love,Yog4Lyf,2021-01-21T06:42:46Z,36
