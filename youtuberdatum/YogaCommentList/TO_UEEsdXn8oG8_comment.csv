"Decided to try this and see how it felt.  Well it was pretty good on the shoulder and low back.  No pain and a very good stretch.  Looks  and feels like I might be back into the grove.  Now to catch up the  1st and today.  2nd &amp; 3rd days are history and did provide remedial stretches for the back/left shoulder.  Good to be back, but to be vigilant and not get too aggressive or cute with the back.",Tony Rodriguez,2021-02-04T16:23:51Z,0

I usually end up in some form of lizard pose, but today, was able to frame the leg, especially on the second side. Wahoo! Was a little downtrodden because my forward fold flexibility didn&#39;t improve as much as usual during January, but this is a BIG win for me. Baby steps. Breathe.

"It was super short but fair to the goal I think. I felt nice stretches with some new poses like gate pose and some old poses like runner&#39;s lunge. Also, the half warrior was new to me.

Same here for me I&#39;ve tried going through the videos before I try them so I know which poses are gonna come next and the times I need to breathe in or out .If you&#39;re familiar with the video then you can modify the time spent on each pose or breathe to whatever suits you and maybe even try to do it without the video with just some calming music,Gurleen Kaur,2021-01-10T06:32:09Z,0

Alvarez,2021-01-04T10:52:44Z,0
"I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s causing it, but I know that Adriene would say not to worry about getting your leg entirely straight. The important piece is the intention. If you just follow as best you can, eventually it will get easier. You can also play around with moving your back knee a little farther back or a little farther forward. If you google runner&#39;s stretch, you might find more advice from both yogis and runners.",Sophie,2021-02-02T17:30:05Z,0

"I have started doing this every morning. As my facet joints are tight and more or less lock up, I have to have a heat pack first and do my physio stretches before I can even attempt this, but then it&#39;s fantastic to do. I struggle with just sitting up at first, but the other yoga moves you do help me be able to sit (on the floor) after this is finished. Thanks so much. You are lovely and your dog is the cutest.",Robby Nielsen,2020-11-12T22:33:08Z,0
"I love this video so much! It wakes up my body, mind, and spirit in the most gentle, inviting way.

"Yoga with Adriene has become one of the good things to come out of the pandemic. One thing I have noticed: you always start on the left with sided movements, which sometimes causes the viewer to turn away from the screen. Could you think about whether we are turning away from the screen on the first side and adjust so we can turn toward the screen on the first side? I know that might turn you away from the screen, but we can still get an idea of what we are to do. Thanks!",Brooke Smith,2020-10-09T16:04:58Z,1

"It’s hard for me to find the time/energy to commit to a full practice every day, so I’ve struggled with the 30 days of yoga challenges. However, this video is the perfect length &amp; amount of activity to fit in every day regardless of my busy schedule. I’ve watched this video just about every day for the last 5 weeks, and I know it by heart at this point 🙈 I’ve really noticed my core is stronger, and my posture is better + my (usually chronic, agonizing) back pain has been reduced! I definitely notice an increase of pain when I skip a day or two. So if you are new to yoga and don’t know many poses, or find the 30+ minute workouts intimidating, I highly recommend keeping this video on a loop for days in between longer practices. Thank you Adriene &amp; Benji!",Corgi6725,2020-09-05T18:21:18Z,0

"Did this the day after the &quot;text neck&quot; practice and I feel so different. Yesterday’s practice really changed the game because sometimes you don’t realise how stiff you are, you just feel uncomfortable. But when you take time to stretch it out instead of pushing yourself to another workout - that’s love.",BeyondTheBop,2020-05-22T08:04:06Z,0

"My kitty and I enjoyed that very much! I do have one question though. I can pull off and hold most poses in this video fairly easily, as I am overall pretty flexible and strong enough, but I can’t get my legs straight in downward dog.

"I would get up 1 min. before the kids. Hardly awake myself, I would try to coax them out, get cranky and annoyed. struggling through the entire morning routine and breakfast, before finally dropping them at school, always feeling like I could do better. I was also suffering from a bad back and shoulder. Three months ago I decided to completely change my routine, I now get up as early as I can, ensuring I have time to do some yoga or pilates (and have a latte with an extra shot of espresso ;) before I wake up the kids. It&#39;s made a world of difference.<br />This routine is such a great motivator to get me out of bed, even on the bad days. It&#39;s only 11 mins and I feel so good afterwards! I even do it on weekends and holidays. <br />I love Adrienne&#39;s easy style and it has really helped me.",Mia Otzen,2020-02-20T11:51:13Z,66

"Good morning Adriene. I wanted to thank you for your wonderful free Yoga routines.  My friend had terrible neck problems, and could not move her arms properly. Since doing your Yoga five days a week, she no longer feels pain. She inspired me to start your Yoga practice. <br /><br />I used to forage organically in my back garden before my new neighbours pesticide invasion.  I was in top health. In just one year my health has deteriated since I can no longer forage for wild medicines. <br /><br />I am struggling to get up and down stairs. My knees have been creaking for four years. But now my whole body creaks. My Nan was crippled with Osteoporisis as was her father. All my family have had hip operations. I am determined to beat this with Yoga and Diet. I try and keep a Health Diary tracking what I eat and how I feel etc. <br /><br />I am part of a Health Group. And would love to liaise with you to see if you could encourage your viewers to also keep a Health Diary. I would love to be part of a health video to do with this research. A TEAM PLAYER!<br /><br />P.S. I have been doing this Wake up Routine for over a week. And the sensitive knees one. I will be doing more once I improve my bone strength. And tracking my progress in my Health Diary. By the way I love your Warrior Pose. I am a massive fan of the Warrior Herbal Plant ... Japanese Knotweed.",Butterfly Lullaby,2020-02-01T10:02:29Z,0

Now, at nearly 54, I find myself recovering from 6 weeks on crutches and surgery on shoulder bursitis, and I can&#39;t just jump back on the treadmill and jog anymore. This is a much kinder way to wake up my aging body in the morning. Adriene has a workout for everything. I love her style so much—it&#39;s so giving and warm. Thanks for providing all these wonderful videos, Adriene.",Holly Wells,2020-01-07T16:30:56Z,0

"Good Morning! I have been doing yoga irregularly for over 10 years, I&#39;m no longer obese :) but I just can&#39;t make my palm touch the ground when in the lunge (?) even though my knee is as close to my body as I can get it. Also, I have to stop the video, straighten my torso up some and grab &amp; pull my foot under. Will I ever be able to swing my foot to there or are my arms too short?

I found your channel about a year ago when I was starting to look into yoga but it was before I started my weight loss journey and before I started my channel, so I never subscribed at that time.

I&#39;m down 40 pounds and can&#39;t wait to start following your channel!",Planning Us Healthy,2019-08-20T16:21:51Z,0

Thanks a lot for this yoga session! It really helped me to start my day with a clear mind! I do have 1 question. Whenever I am in childs pose it is not comfortable for me to breathe when i have my forehead on the mat because my nose gets &quot;squeezed&quot;. Is it okay to have my chin on the mat? That way I also feel a deeper stretch or should I look to one side?,Nele Vandendungen,2019-07-04T06:23:40Z,0

"New to yoga. But experienced in fitness. I tried this in the morning. #1 I did not feel connected. #2 I kept looking at my posture to the side in the mirror to make sure I was aligned, which I had to adjust often. I mean whats the point of practicing bad technique that you carry one with practice.  (Despite having good body mechanics and awareness in other areas of fitness) #3 I kept looking at the video for reference and was not able to take proper breaths or even &quot;feel&quot; the stretch until the move was up and the next one started. #4 Moving my arms up and down and sideways in this slow fashion, opening up the fingers etc, felt very odd and theatrical which obviously affected this session.  If anyone has any ideas on how to practice as a noob pls advise.",November Alpha Mike,2019-04-09T14:48:57Z,0

"Hi Adriene! I&#39;m very new to your channel and to yoga, but I really enjoy doing it so far and your videos are a great guidance for practicing at home! I have a question however, when I tried this routine, my knees started to hurt a lot after a while bc I can&#39;t sit on them for longer periods of time on hard surfaces and the yoga mat is quite thin...I kinda broke down during the first warrior pose...I decided to use a thin pillow to rest my knees on, is this okay? Or do you have any other ideas or tips for dealing with this? Thank you for all that you do!",Nina Vanhoutte,2019-03-14T09:14:49Z,0

"I woke up feeling exhausted and being accustomed to always hitting the snooze way too many times. Today I knew I needed a reset first thing. My kitty Tigger joined me, and was purring and rubbing me as I practiced. During extended child&#39;s pose, I ended up have to lay my face on his heaving, purring belly. 😹😻What a loving way to start the day!",Elisa Chodan,2019-02-22T13:43:15Z,184

"Adriene! Ever since I was in school as a young child, it’s been painfully hard for me to sit with my legs crossed. I’ve been practicing your yoga for a while and at the end of the yoga when you mentioned sit in a seat of your choice, I had my eyes closed and immediately chose to go into a crossed legged seat. The very position that’s been so painful is actually enjoyable to sit in now! Theres still tightness but I know a consistent practice would help as you have! I’m very grateful for you Adriene and Benji💛💝",Empyreal White Rabbit,2019-02-21T13:19:59Z,0

But a short practice like this is manageable. Plus I work in front of a computer all day so this would help lots. Thank you Adriene! Love to you and Benji! 🐾🧚🏻‍♀️💕🙏🏼,yogachic69,2019-02-17T21:31:36Z,1

"I used to wake up at 12pm , and sleep late , I stopped practicing yoga since November<br />Yesterday I wrote down that I want to change and go back to my old good habits but didn&#39;t think of starting my day with yoga<br />I woke up and it&#39;s 7AM , couldn&#39;t leave my bed , I checked my phone, found this in the notifications bar<br />And it pushed me to leave my bed!!<br />Is it mother nature that&#39;s giving me signs? Hahah <br />Good sunday everybody and whoever reads my comment have a good day wherever you are",Imane Boulaid,2019-02-17T06:55:40Z,2090

"Oh mama!! The bed&#39;s screaming at me to get back to it but i know i don&#39;t want to. I&#39;ve been struggling to wake up early over the past week, driving me to have to take a little wake up shower each and every day of the week which i hate doing given that my skin&#39;s sensitive. Adriene sensei saves the day yet again with another yoga quickie, short but impactful, and will serve as an adequate wake me up session. Thanks for the wonderful practice and changing my life. Hope y&#39;all have a wonderful day. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-02-17T06:10:38Z,26
