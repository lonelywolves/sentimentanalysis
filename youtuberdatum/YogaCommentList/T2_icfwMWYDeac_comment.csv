I am a beginner who completed Breathe. It was difficult but I enjoyed it. I’m behind so I’m just completing bridge. Have any other beginners found it hard? I’m in pain in almost every single session which is so different from Breathe. I think this is too advanced for me,Sas G,2021-03-14T20:57:21Z,0

"I had just finished a therapy appointment. I&#39;ve been feeling down because of the cold and rain. I decided I can still show up for myself without going outside, and happened upon this video. This was my first time doing yoga in 2021, and it was emotional. I didn&#39;t feel the emotion until the very end when Adriene said, &quot;Give thanks for this moment, carving out some time for yourself. I admire you.&quot; I started to cry. Thank you. Be back tomorrow :-)",Jason D'Amours,2021-02-17T19:53:45Z,1

"This is the first yoga practice I chose after completing my Breath journey yesterday. It was an interesting throwback to hear the regular YWA theme song again! Yoga is changed forever for me. I am now able to give myself permission to adjust as I need, because I know how to do so and what my body needs better than I did before, and I am able to give strength and support and power to each pose because of all that I have learned. Certain difficult poses are not as difficult as they would have been before, and I feel more confident to power through the difficulty or even confusion. This was really eye-opening to me to see how much I have grown in the past month. Thank you for everything!",Valaya Hart,2021-02-16T15:39:47Z,0

"Because yesterday I joined you in the live session, Anchored in Love, I thought I’d do this short one today instead of the longer one that has come out today. I just came back from a long walk and I was so tired after a busy week and daily yoga every single day since 1st of January! 💪🏼🔥😃 I had nothing in the tank to begin with. Oh how wrong I was choosing this “short one” thinking it would be easy!!🥴😖 Oh my god!

"I&#39;m here from BREATH to BRIDGE! During this video, I was beginning to feel very tired and frustrated with the movements and on top of that, feeling angry with myself that I was feeling those things, which caused more frustration and so on. Then, while gritting my teeth, I thought, &quot;I&#39;m gonna finish the practice but I&#39;m gonna be as angry as I want&quot; and that actually diffused a lot of the upset I was feeling so that by the end, my mind was actually way more calm. By leaning into the anger, I realized that 1) there actually wasn&#39;t as much of it as I thought there was, it was me trying to push it away that made it feel bigger. 2) accepting that I was upset and allowing myself to feel it was so helpful for myself. This is definitely an Idea that I want to explore more. I guess this video was good for shifting perspective. :)",Yes! Ha! hannaH,2021-02-06T22:54:46Z,2

"I was excited to see this on Day 6 - Bridge...  I&#39;ve done this practice before and did struggle but today after doing Breath &amp; then continuing to bridge, I brought all the tools we have learned so far and o.m.g, what a totally different practice... I still wobbled, but I loved it... Big Shout out to all who are doing Bridge too &amp; to everyone else just feeling they need this too... 😊💕🙏🏻 Namaste xx",Daisy Dillon,2021-02-06T15:10:10Z,9

"It&#39;s so surprising to feel my muscles. I did pretty much everything until minute 11. I noticed I was getting low on energy. In the past this has been when I&#39;d stop the video and go on to my day, but the truth is that the sour taste of having not finished a video would stay with me. For some reason (thankfully), I remembered that this is about time and breath first of all. So I lay down on my back, my left hand on my heart and my right hand on my belly, and just breathed. Did some ratios for a bit. Then sat up and continued breathing. I felt good. I joined Adriene for the last bit: knocking on heaven&#39;s door, and I was up on my feet to say &#39;Namaste&#39; back to her.<br /><br />Today&#39;s discovery is not only that how I move matters, as Adriene says, but how I end also matters. Do I end with guilt, with a feeling of defeat, because of my perfectionism? Or do I recognise truthfully when my energy dips, my joy dissolves, and choose to reconnect to myself exactly as I am instead of being angry for not being other than what I am. And then, humbly, join for the end. Not to fake that I&#39;ve done it all, but to mark that I&#39;ve carved time out for myself, from beginning to end, from joy to doubt and back to joy -- exactly as I was in my rollercoaster of emotions. Knocking on heaven&#39;s door I realised this was not only some time for myself to breathe, but that actually my muscles felt good and sore. <br /><br />This was a workout. This was a meditation. This was growth. This was a win, all around.",Valerie Kroneanu,2021-02-06T13:21:34Z,22

"Hello Breath to Bridge family!🙏💜 How did you find today&#39;s practice? It is one of my favorites. I am a little confused though about how to breathe through the moving parts of the posture we did between <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icfwMWYDeac&amp;t=11m30s"">11:30</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icfwMWYDeac&amp;t=16m30s"">16:30</a>. Does that posture have a name? Anyways, Adriene does mention at each resting (transition) point whether to inhale or exhale, but what about while moving? I find it hard to be aligned with her inhales and exhales. Thoughts?<br /><br />Bridge Day 6! 125 days in a row for me. 😊",William B,2021-02-06T08:18:07Z,0
@India Lucas Thank you for mentioning that.,William B,2021-02-06T14:12:41Z,0

@GinatusThank you for your reply. I will try those five minutes again in the morning.,William B,2021-02-06T09:45:03Z,0
"Hi William! I was basically moving all the time. So when I started exhaling, I straightened my front leg and reached forward. When I had reached that posture and started inhaling, I bent my front knee and lifted the other arm up. Then repeat. I was maybe moving a bit faster than Adrienne because my breaths weren&#39;t all that long hehe. But in the end I guess you could do it with extra breaths in between and take your time :)",Ginatus,2021-02-06T08:59:34Z,2

"It&#39;s so amazing how your yoga sessions truly do what they purport to do. On the other hand, though, they teach not to expect any particular outcome but to simply enjoy, appreciate and feel good. Following your sessions, one feels an intimate sense of connection to you and to a whole community of followers. And what this teaches, I think, is one of the most basic yet hardest things to achieve today: to appreciate something without owning it. Thank you for your strength, your well-grounded subjectivity, and your generosity. Namaste.",H D,2020-12-19T11:01:52Z,0

"Earlier I asked my aunt to help alternate with me caring for my grandparents (her parents) but because I had not yet received a text from her my mind started to fill with ugly thoughts.  I started to feel helpless and trapped, snarled at my grandmother about being sick of the PBS News Hour and went off to sulk like a middle aged adolescent.<br /><br />At that point I decided to review the ACTION calendar I printed out. And there it was:  Yoga to Shift Perspective. I took action to shift my perspective and that made all the difference. ❤️ <br /><br />I don’t know what my aunt’s response will be but at least with a healthy, loving COMPASSIONATE shift of perspective I now feel more confident that I can adapt and rise to the challenge accordingly.<br /><br />Thank you Adriene.  🙏 And namaste to everyone in the community.

"Adriene, <br />I&#39;ve written to you before but you do not know what an impact you have made on my day to day life. A little over a week ago my little cousin was killed in a motorcycle accident, through no fault of his own. He was only 21. In the past week I felt so shattered, it even got to the point I had to be medicated to control my panic attacks. I do not know how the rest of my family are coping with it especially his dad and mom. I live in Florida now and am so far away from all of them in Canada. I couldn&#39;t even get out of bed the majority of the week. And I still am having trouble sleeping. I keep waking up gasping for air with my heart going crazy. <br />A couple nights ago I watched his funeral service online and afterwards I felt just so overwhelmed with emotions, so I started to knock on heavens door. Today was an emotional practice, it&#39;s the first one I&#39;ve done since he passed. Knocking on heaven&#39;s door again was such a release of emotions and honestly between that simple motion and the service I have finally been able to get out of bed again and start cleaning my house. Last night I only woke up twice in panic, and actually slept in this morning. A MAJOR change for the better.<br />It really goes to show you never know who you&#39;re impacting or how they carry on what you teach. Thank you Adriene for being my life coach when I don&#39;t have one without even knowing it. You were there for me this week when all I wanted was family. <br />Thank you &lt;3",delloliod,2020-08-30T18:51:09Z,0

Hi Adriene! My friend and I are huge fans of your work and have done over 100 days of YWA in quarantine. 💜🧘‍♀️ This morning we did the Detox Yoga video that you created 6 years ago and were caught off guard with an ad that interrupted the session in the middle. Not sure if this is just an issue with some of your older videos but is there any way to make sure ads only show up in the beginning and not the middle so that you can continue to be compensated for sharing your practice without ads getting in the the way of the flow?,Gianna Lum,2020-07-30T19:05:33Z,0

"THIS!!! Holy cow what a great way to wake -up if you are internationally traveling during a pandemic as an American! It took me just under a month to get from San Diego to Sanday in the Orkney Archipelago with travel delays, gracious Air B&amp;B hosts in a Dublin, London, Aberdeen and Kirkwall, getting booted off a flight after I was buckled in because my passport was persona non grata to connect in Paris, stranded on a dock in Kirkwall with no WiFi and no way to check my AirB&amp;B info.

"I’m also a beginner but, before you start a session do not go into it cold/tight. That’s how you tear muscles (from accidents or normal stretching) try to idk do a little cardio warmup. But in general, she has some beginner videos as well but I think the best way to progress is to just focus on yourself and breathing. I’m a guy who is not flexible so when I see her basically stretch her head behind her ass I feel bad that my head can’t even cross the plane of my vertical body. Overall though, just keep practicing. You won’t notice progress in real time but if you look at where you were a month ago vs a month later there will be progress!",Burr,2020-07-27T19:36:50Z,0

"Adriene, I&#39;ve always really liked yoga but you&#39;ve made me look forward to it every day! <br />About 10 years ago I dislocated my knee, and ever since it&#39;s been painful in certain transitions. I really struggle to get into positions like lunges - it does a painful crunchy grind every time it has to go through the  90° point, and poses like Hovering Cat to practise Chaturanga, where I have to press through the tops of the feet, also put strain on the old knee. It&#39;s affected my other knee and hip over time too, and I really want to strengthen my practice so that I can get back into beloved surfing again! <br />I would love to see a you create a video on knee strengthening yoga sometime &lt;3 most people tend to focus on avoiding movements that affect the knee, rather than helping it become stronger. <br />Thank you for helping me show up! x",Adelle Gough,2020-07-25T13:18:31Z,1

"loved this yoga session. but knocking on heaven&#39;s door? In tai chi we call it beating the heavenly drum or ringing the temple bell. the move comes from the dantien, just below the belly button, and the arms hang free, like limp spaghetti, beating against the body with each turn, hence beating the heavenly drum.

I&#39;ve only watched a small amount of this but it looks like something I can do I&#39;m 65 with asthma they took on my thyroid my weight issues sword after that it was hyperactive so I think that was keeping my way down most of my life. I also have some underlying issues.. hours of shutdown and inactive gain weight back and feet swelling did all the tests for heart blood kidneys everything&#39;s fine and I have hives on my back for 13 years don&#39;t know why complications from the thyroid or whatever but now my scalp is inflamed... and the hives went up there so I&#39;m a mess somebody suggested an anti-inflammatory diet I was so shocked I thought I was already avoiding things do to my allergies I reacted violently to a few mosquito bites the last two weeks I&#39;ve changed my diet to low histamine shocked that bananas spinach and avocado are high histamine I was concentrating on fruits. But in the past few years I&#39;ve had a really bad fall out of the shower hit the toilet landed on my tailbone and then last year another bad. My shoulder my kneecap was so badly that it was broken almost broke my toe tripping on my bedspread yeah home accidents can&#39;t believe it. I was always active my whole life had my sunlight in life it 37 for him it just seems like the past few years everything&#39;s been deteriorating I have arthritis in my knees also injured both of these two on top of that so I can&#39;t be real active and walk everybody has suggested yoga but I tried it years ago and it was so boring I have a hyperactive brain I can&#39;t relax..<br /><br />All that said it looks like some of the things on here I can do I was always good at stretching and bending I used to be in gymnastics and I was a dancer all my life Ballroom that type of thing I enjoyed being active and be able to do things and now I have slight asthma due to complications with the thyroid and racing heart. I was misdiagnosed for almost a year and it caused problems and scarring on my lungs because of the heart racing...<br /><br /> so that said this is the first yoga video I think I could actually try and do and maybe not be so bored I like that some of it has a little bit of isometrics...  I&#39;ve got to do something to get active.  I used to walk to the bus and walk around the mall so that kept me a little bit active. But now with the kid nations of the world I find it extremely hard,Ann inGG,2020-07-24T04:53:30Z,3

Namaste<br /><br />When body movements are synchonized with breath exercise becomes deeply relaxing.<br /><br />When we strech away from the normal position we must inhale as it is connected to sympathetic nerve and increases the stress/ energy which is needed.<br /><br />When we return to normal position we must exhale as it links to the parasympathetic nerve and is relaxing.<br /><br />Thanks.,Sada,2020-07-24T03:36:37Z,1

I have been following Adriene for sometime now. One thing I have definitely noticed is in the early yoga videos she sounded very english when she said the word &quot;Namaste&quot; but lately It&#39;s starting to sound like that of a Hindu person or someone who knows Sanskrit. Her pronunciation sounds very accurate. Also If you read this Thanks for your videos! Yoga practices with you and Benji has definitely been a huge part of my life now.

I would love to see a practice that, say, starts with core on the floor and then moves up to standing balance work, moving from training the muscles to using them.

"Adrian I&#39;m just writing to say I love you. I&#39;ve been practicing yoga for over 20 years and teaching for the past 15. Retired two years ago, got really out of shape, made a commitment to get back in shape, and what do you know, injured a ligament in my knee. So I decided the only thing to do was to start over like a rank beginner and work my way back up to where I left off. I happened to stumble upon your 30 days with adriene series which I realize is quite old but once I got started on it I didn&#39;t want to skip anything.  my plan is to work myself up to your most recent videos.

I also ride horses and love your yoga for equestrians and your full body stretch does wonders.<br /><br />May I request a video that combines tired legs, deep hip, groan and back stretches and upper body mobility. (Also a little fire in the abs never hurt) I know its a wide range and I am looking for a video I can do almost every day after riding to really limber me up for my rest time. I struggle with dumping into my wrists, if it is possible for a little wrist love would be amazing.<br /><br />WOW, thats a long list haha. Adriene thank you so much for everything you do. You make waking up at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icfwMWYDeac&amp;t=5m30s"">5:30</a> every morning easy(ier), love your work and excited to see what you come up with for a steezy mountain biking giiidie up !!!

"I wish I could have more fully engaged with this practice, but it was not easy to modify - I can&#39;t bear a lot of weight on my left arm, sadly the number of planks/side planks, the difficulty of modifying it to half-plank so I could take pressure off my arm etc meant I sat out like 40% of the practise. Then whenbthe more challenging stuff arrived I wasn&#39;t warmed up and I pinged a hamstring. More thought about variation on the active practises would be very helpful to disabled practitioners - I have a home practise for this very reason!",msmongooseable,2020-07-07T18:20:58Z,0

"I just finished Dedicate on Friday, which was my fourth &quot;30 days of yoga&quot; I&#39;ve finished this year, after Home, True, and Yoga Camp! (Plus other videos and freestyle days sprinkled throughout.) I did your original 30 days of yoga years ago, the summer after it came out, and have been sporadically doing yoga ever since. But for some reason this year I&#39;ve found the motivation and desire to do yoga almost every single day.<br /><br />I&#39;ve felt myself get stronger in every part of my body. In January I would frequently pause the video to rest for a few minutes, but now I rarely ever do. Downward dog now feels like a resting posture. I can <b>almost</b> gracefully lower to my belly from a plank. When I get stressed I find myself taking deep, measured breaths like I do when practising yoga, without even consciously trying. It hasn&#39;t always been easy, but I&#39;m so glad I&#39;ve stuck with it.<br /><br />I&#39;ve never commented on one of your videos before but I guess today&#39;s the day, after reading so many other comments like this over the years.

This morning, I have a new surge of energy, ready to face the new week ahead. Thank you Adriene xx Namaste 💟💟",Liz Beardmore,2020-07-06T09:22:53Z,2
"Thanks a lot Adriene. I&#39;ve found your channel thanks to a friend a day before the end of lockdown in France and I&#39;ve been doing yoga with you and your community since almost two months now, completing my exercices with pilates and kickboxing. I think I would have gone insane without your videos. Things are really messed up in France, I&#39;ll probably won&#39;t work in my domain anymore this year, I&#39;ven&#39;t seen most of my friends since march too, ... Things could be worse of course, I have a roof, food, I&#39;m quite healthy, but the mind is suffering. So well, thank you and take care.",SushiOverdose,2020-07-06T09:16:16Z,1

"Hey Adriene, this yoga sequenze was exactly what I needed today. To the end I thought: oh my back needs a „knocking on heavens door“ and then you did it as well in the video. Seems like my body finally finds what feels good by itself. So thank you for (for me it’s 5 years now) your great yoga videos! Also I am looking for a 30 day challenge for pregnancy. Did you ever thought about offering this? Would be great! Greetings from Hamburg💕",Elena,2020-07-06T08:51:48Z,0

"I have been following Adriene now for approximately 3 months. As a Support Worker working with students on the Spectrum - our High School program was chosen by the Vancouver School Board to be the test program to introduce vulnerable kids back to the classroom. We were back from April to June. As a way to provide a fun and calming environment, we did a daily session with Adriene. It really help all of us, staff included, to be more grounded in a world of uncertainly, inherent risk and change. I am now doing the daily challenge for July on the theme of Shift. Today’s session here was just what I needed to help some tired legs after completing a half marathon yesterday! Thank you Adriene - you’re the friend and light we all need right now!

"I really did need this video today. I have been going through so much stuff mentally for a long time now, and your videos have always helped me get through those rough times. Although as of late, it has definitely been more difficult than usual. It just feels like there is this giant, grey cloud just surrounding my brain and I find it hard to enjoy a lot of things that I used to enjoy. Just feeling like my loved ones don&#39;t really love me and I&#39;m just a burden.. I came to the mat today just feeling so out of it, depressed and just feeling like I&#39;m about to break down. By the end of the video, a lot of emotions came out and there were some tears, but I do feel a bit better. Hearing you say &quot;you amazing person&quot; in your videos or saying &quot;I love you&quot; at the end of most of your videos really does make me feel happy. I never hear those things in person so hearing you say it to me, even if it&#39;s on a video, it still really does me a lot. Thank you for taking the time and energy to make these videos for everybody. I love ya Adriene, and thank you again for everything. Stay safe. xx",dylan,2020-07-06T01:38:06Z,0

"@Shade On A Cool Day Same here! I was on a really good gym routine before the lockdown but I actually didn&#39;t go about the rest of my habits the right way... I was indulging in way too many treats and eating when I just wanted to &quot;numb out&quot;. I  justified it with hitting the gym. My weight loss and muscle gain were completely stalled because (as I&#39;m reflecting on it now) I didn&#39;t change my diet drastically enough and wasn&#39;t taking care of my mind as I was taking care of my body.<br /><br />I started doing Yoga with Adriene daily and several other workouts on Youtube when quarantine started. I found that I also needed to track my calories to keep myself accountable with my diet. (I use <a href=""http://sparkpeople.com/"">Sparkpeople.com</a>, it&#39;s free ;-) ) I also meditate now daily and I CANNOT recommend it enough... meditation has quieted my brain in the way food used to, without the guilt. <br /><br />I have a checklist of daily healthy habits to keep myself accountable. It&#39;s just a daily list I made in my planner and I check them off each day. I&#39;ve been doing that since March and I&#39;ve lost 20 pounds since the start of the pandemic. I no longer am focused on weight loss but for strength building and maintenance. I definitely still have my moments but I journal them and move on.  Some moments I just REALLY want french fries or takeout and 90% of the time I can talk myself out of it by reminding myself how much damn work I&#39;ve been doing! I&#39;m finally seeing results (it takes soooo much longer than I thought LOL)  but more importantly the routine has helped me keep relatively sane and makes me feel like I have some of control through all of this. <br /><br />Best of luck to you and your goals!",danikeir,2020-07-06T02:04:23Z,0

We finished that series then found Yoga Camp 30 days, “do what feels good”. We’ve now done that series twice! 90 days of Yoga in a row!!!! You’re encouraging, non judgmental attitude made us feel safe (pause button is our friend too!). I just wanted to thank you- this has changed us for the better in so many ways!!! Now what?

"So yeah most awesome it&#39;s so amazing so amazing I thank God for all the goodness in my life that I&#39;ve been struggling since the beginning of the year I think it would be fair to say with my emotions and just trying to get back to Total Wellness in my body and this practice as always is right on time as is the mercy, embrace, and healing of God.  I would say I&#39;ve been experiencing what&#39;s called a proper purging to achieve  peace,  Wellness, and balance. EVERY movement of this practice particularly towards the end was like a much needed rinsing out of what does not serve me. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽💞",galukya1,2020-07-05T20:10:06Z,0
Nice... side plank is usually dangerous for my shoulders as they pop out sometimes. This body of movement helped me consciously pull my left shoulder down and back to where it needs to go for proper stability. By the time you told me to side plank I didnt have to stop and think about how not to hurt myself - I just felt the right form coming to me and I was able to naturally unfold into a position where I am usually doubtful or in fear. I know you build these routines to show us just how much more capable our bodies are than we might otherwise know. Thanks Adriene,meow444,2020-07-05T20:09:07Z,0
"I&#39;ve really struggled keeping my practice consistent but have found myself back in old negative mindsets and thinking patterns which has made me feel very low and negative.

One year ago on Jul 4, my husband and I had a huge fight and he told me he wanted to leave...he actually had for a while. After my initial shock, I decided to take this as a learning opportunity and spent the next 12 months in therapy, reading, and discovering things like YWA. Among others, I have YOU to thank for finding myself, for creating strength and awareness, for revitalized joy and love in myself and my family. This was the PERFECT practice to &quot;celebrate&quot; my one year and realize how much stronger I am today And thankfully, my husband and I are also stronger than ever now.

"Hey yo!! I&#39;m on I&#39;m burning on fire of excitement at the thought of having Adriene potentially being back to uploading weekly videos. Believe itvor not, I find that it is now time to start shifting my perspective to a new direction in preparation to find what feels good in a world that looks to be ending no matter how one looks at it. Rightfully so, I am gonna savor every moment of this sweet practice in hope of aleviating some of the emotional pressure that has accumulated upon my shoulders over the past few months. Remember, always look for light no matter how dark things may look and feel around you, you can do this. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2020-07-05T14:33:37Z,0
"Been doing yoga every day since mid March, most often with Adrienne, but sometimes my own flow. It&#39;s a habit that has made a huge positive difference in my life mentally, physically, and spiritually. The hardest part is showing up on the mat, but it&#39;s always worth it. On the days when it&#39;s hardest I tell myself I&#39;ll at least stretch for 15 minutes. I always end up doing more. I&#39;ve never heard anyone say they were sorry they did yoga today.<br />Hey yo, party people! Just do it!",Lisa Lawwill,2020-07-05T14:28:39Z,0

Adrienne I&#39;m confused about the yoga breathing. your breathing is the exact opposite of how it is done in every other martial art I&#39;ve taken. Like when you extend to your tippy toes in the beginning of the video you say to inhale while extending and exhale after. Is there a reason for this in yoga? Normally you would exhale on he extension for explosive power and inhale on the return to normal. Just curious because it&#39;s throwing off my training. Thanks for the videos ✌️,thfenton,2020-07-05T11:42:21Z,0

"Hi Adriene😄! This was a beautiful practice that invited me to notice some of my patterns. For example, I find that I have a tendency to hold my breath whenever I am investigating a new pose or a new way of moving. Today, I reminded myself to keep the breath flowing. The breath is such a valuable tool! Also, I am so happy to end this practice with a little &quot;Knocking on Heaven&#39;s Door.&quot; Such a great movement to get the energy flowing! I could definitely feel a shift taking place by the end of this practice! Thank you so much❤! I hope you have an awesome day! 🙏",Yoga with Rachel,2020-07-05T11:21:33Z,0
