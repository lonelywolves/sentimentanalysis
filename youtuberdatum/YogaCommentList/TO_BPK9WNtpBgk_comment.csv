@Gill Smith  I am extremely jealous you live in a village. You are pretty much living my dream life right now.  How about we swap places after the world opens up again? I&#39;m amazed how colder the weather Out on the peninsula then inland! No wonder I was way off! It looks like you guys just got hit with the snow. I hope it doesn&#39;t do any damage to your plants that were starting to come out?  We should really be living in climates that are better for our sensitive bodies but we are lucky to live near the water. I am feeling better mentally. Those vibes you sent are working wonders. I just need to let you know earlier before it gets too bad. <br><br> Now that I&#39;m feeling better I totally think I can do tomorrow&#39;s yoga just sitting down. It&#39;s amazing howI can be more creative and flexible when I&#39;m not being eaten alive by demons. I&#39;ll see you in the comments.

"So for me today is day 3 of the Renew calendar and I woke up late. I was starving, so I had breakfast (tamales to be exact). I didn&#39;t feel able to go through the 36 minute session with downward facing dogs and vinyasa, and although I felt like cheating all along, I chose this lovely, magnificent, gentle 22 minute session. And when Adriene said, it is in the intention of working towards something, not shying away,  suddenly I felt more at ease. I am doing the work and maybe sometimes we are so tough with ourselves and trying to hit all the home runs, when in fact some days you just need to do your best while honoring your tamales for breakfast.",mariana campos,2021-04-03T18:10:07Z,50

"It still amazes me how much better I feel after doing yoga, a fact that I often tend to forget since I&#39;ve been doing weight lifting and hiit training the last 6 months. Today my body just wasn&#39;t feeling 100% to do something intense, I felt tired, exhausted, sleepy. So I turned to good old yoga with Adriene, the one that got me into fitness in the first place 2 years ago. I feel much more alive now, ready to carry on with my day, more awake. We need to listen to our bodies more, some days all they need is some love from us and this channel, this amazing lady here is the best way to do this.

"I had a big meltdown today but at the end of my practice today i was so at peace and smiled, which i haven&#39;t done in some time. In December 2020 i started with the 30days &quot;home&quot; journey. It was really hard at first to just listen to me breathing and to focus on my body. But with time my body got stronger. Now i&#39;m doing the &quot;breath&quot; 30 days and i love it. It keeps me going in the times of homeschooling. Today i went to the mat and started with one video and ended up doing 3 20min practices. I&#39;m so thankful for the opportunity that i have to focus on myself in my yoga sessions. Thank you Adriene, sending so much love from Germany. <br />To everyone else reading this i&#39;m proud of you.

My sister recommended your channel to me and this is the end of the third week where I have woken up each day with one of your yoga routines.

"that last bit almost made be cry again. so much of what my body does is linked to me feeling angry, hopeless and frustrated. whether it&#39;s hairloss or random pain or anxiety, it&#39;s hard to have calm thoughts when i feel like my body is constantly working against me. yoga reminds me every day that I should choose love, that I need to surrender and that I&#39;m not in control of everything. after running to doctor after doctor I realised that the best medicine in my case is doing all the hard psychological work, getting into a different mindset, no matter what&#39;s happening to me or everyone around me, I can only adjust and accept.

"It‚Äôs been at least two months that I‚Äôve been enjoying your practice. I do a session almost everyday. I think you may be teaching me how to quiet the sciatica (usually low back on right and upper hip). I am also re-learning how to stand and walk on all four corners of my feet. I‚Äôve danced for years but it‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve danced in a company. Somehow my feet decided to put weight on the inside. I have small bunions and the one on the right has been bothering me. I‚Äôm hoping standing on my feet correctly will help. I know surgery for a bunion is not the way to go; it‚Äôs not a bone. Anyway, I love your teaching style. You do things very safely otherwise, I couldn‚Äôt follow you. I really, really appreciate that!!! I love your practice! Thank you for all your time!

I just got out of an extremely emotional and at the end physically abusive relationship. I stopped doing yoga and the things I loved all together. In February he hurt me and I had a serious knee and tibia injury. I remember being in the hospital and thinking I might not ever be able to do yoga like I used to. I‚Äôm so thankful I am able to do yoga again. This is the first time I‚Äôve practiced since the incident.  I couldn‚Äôt help but tear up at the end. Thank you so much Adrienne you are by far my favorite teacher to follow on YouTube. üôèüèΩüíï,Avery Dawn,2020-05-25T20:25:48Z,14

"Love your videos Adriene! The only thing that is constantly a struggle is all the talking while trying to focus through the posture and either clear my mind or just let it be. It distracts my focus or makes my thoughts race more when someone else repeats it over and over to let them go. I also notice that sometimes there&#39;s a lot of talking. For example, we&#39;re on the right side then take 5 breaths, then on the other side it will really by 5 breathes when 16 were put in on the other side. I&#39;ll have to pause the videos a lot and even out which makes these sessions take up more time than I was ready to commit for. I also wish there was some way you could let the videos run for at least 3 minutes in silence at the end to allow the final pose to have its true effect. If I have to get up and pause it, then I lose it my interest in actually doing the final pose and turn it off usually. Thank you for sharing your videos on your channel!",Eileen Hopkins,2020-05-22T14:27:38Z,0

"My friend showed me yoga July 2019, and ever since i have loved it, i started by watching these videos from Adrian and i just watched a few, i hadn&#39;t been doing it a lot neither have i been doing a lot of poses just ones that i already knew or remembered from before, I&#39;ve recently hurt my lower back about a week ago and I&#39;ve been even more into yoga since, I&#39;ve noticed my back is healing way faster than i had imagined and it feels less strained, I&#39;ve also been able to go without my back brace for a couple hours at a time, I&#39;ve even found myself back at the gym a lot sooner than i thought, and although i still feel pain the yoga has tremendously helped me a lot and for anyone who hasn&#39;t tried it or is scared i truly think you should give it a try, it also has helped me be more spiritual and mentally focused, my depression is better than it has ever been and coming from an over thinker i feel way more at ease and peaceful with my mind and thoughts, i will be following more of your tutorials Adrian thank you so much. &lt;3",starlyn thornquist,2020-03-08T18:07:05Z,7

"Thank you Adriene! I have recently started doing Yoga with you (almost) every morning and after a week I already feel the benefits of it! I have noticed that I breath and move with more awareness along the day, not only when I am following your videos. I generally follow everything you do very easily but you always acknowledge that many people might not and I like that you always provide different ways of doing things for those who find it more challenging and help us all to accept ourselves and embrace our own body. Thank you for your job, you&#39;re making the world a better place :)",Alba Saez,2019-12-26T12:20:03Z,1

"First time commenting.. been doing the 30 days of yoga. I‚Äôm on day 15 halfway through haven‚Äôt missed a day. Today was half moon practice and I was falling all over the place but felt so ecstatic with the energies in my body after. That was this morning and I came here for seconds as I wanted an evening session. Yesterday I did two sessions as well, day 14 and another one of the miscellaneous videos. Words can not explain how these practices have made me feel, but one word comes to mind.. Alive. These energies I feel in my body feel wholesome and pure. As an ex football player wrestler rock climber and jiu jitsu practitioner growing up, I‚Äôm now 21 almost 22 I‚Äôve suffered a few injuries. I have dislocated both my knees my left knee twice broken my right ankle and torn my rotator cuff in my shoulder as well as broken my toes. These past two weeks I‚Äôve felt a pretty monumental recovery physically and have felt fantastic as well as looking better therefore regaining my confidence physically and mentally. Sorry if this is repetitive, but my bottom line is this is a beautiful practice and community and energy overall and it‚Äôs so amazing this is available and out in the world for free above all else. Free.. I‚Äôm from the Bay Area where rent is 3000 a month so free is a rare occasion. So stay consistent guys get your gains thank and support Adriene for every video she graces us with and above all else JUST BREATH hahaha!!!!",Nicolas Derksen,2019-11-06T05:37:07Z,0

"I&#39;m very inconsistent with my practice. I somehow get into the mind set that I don&#39;t have the time, I don&#39;t do it right anyway, it doesn&#39;t do anything for my body, etc. etc., excuses and more excuses. But, every single time I come back to yoga, I do it with Adriene. And I have to say, as soon as I step back on the mat, it&#39;s like all that negative energy, all those thoughts that keep me from bettering myself...they disappear. Thank you Adriene, for inspiring me, for holding my hand through this journey, and especially for still being there after I&#39;ve lost myself and found my way back. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",Briana Brock,2019-09-17T21:19:05Z,133

"Just did this video for the first time and I liked it. I just wish there was a way to figure out which videos are best for those who can&#39;t do much with pressure on the wrist (ie table top position and plank). I have a cyst in my left wrist that prevents full extension with pressure. I can do minimal amounts of table top position by using a fist instead, but this video was too long on the wrist action. Any suggestions of which videos would be best for me would be appreciated. Thanks Adriene!",Natasha Vedder,2019-09-14T16:48:15Z,0

It&#39;s over 20 seconds before each pose can be done which is nice for a beginner but doesn&#39;t help keep a practice and flow. Her little jokes etc are cute but its a bit of an interruption. I&#39;ve seen this across the board with her videos... a little frustrating. Any videos that stay consistent in energy, tone, and breath?

"Adriene, your pre and post cardio stretch videos, have, in the past, been instrumental in helping me both FEEL great/build muscle/diminish brain fog/increase energy AND avoid painful nocturnal leg cramps. The stretching, I have proven to myself, aids in my experiencing less back pain/weight-bearing/nerve pain during my cardio, HiiT and walks. Much thanks for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I,  however,  changed up my exercise regime &amp; consequently replaced the daily routine of 50 mins of cardio, concentrating instead upon upon walking and strength training (neglecting your videos and the stretching in the process) and my nocturnal leg cramps have once again become a horrific challenge which frequently interrupt my sleep. Thus far, the nocturnal cramping  has not been avoided with much hydration / the application of topical magnesium chloride flakes in solution / supplements / the topical application of cider vinegar  (which once worked immediately and effectively to instantly un-cramp the muscle in the past), NOR has the ingestion of cider vinegar helped in any noticeable way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             TODAY I did a brief stint of cardio upon awakening (as recommended as an to aid to improving my  sleep quality) and  book-ended the cardio with those two videos (which preface and follow my 160BPM music selection(s))  and I FEEL better than I have in AGES. AGAIN, thanks. I am really focusing on my sleep quality now as so much research stresses the importance of this facet of our daily life as being vital for repair of brain tissue, muscle and for weight loss/weight gain/emotional well being, and health..among other benefits.  Recent sleep research recommends STRETCHING before bed: both to improve the QUALITY of one&#39;s sleep and to avoid those pesky cramps which JOLT me out of sleep. When I stretch WITHOUT your guidance, the process itself is both BORING and not....as relaxing nor beneficial as when i stretch WITH  your instructions....so I ask you, please, WHICH existing video would you suggest as a pre bedtime ritual to aid in improving sleep quality and reducing, perhaps, the severity or frequency of those pesky nocturnal leg (thigh, glute, calf and foot) cramps? ADDITIONALLY, I ask that you, PLEASE, Adriene, consider creating yet another video(s) with the specific yoga YOU FEEL would help we, your legion of HAPPIER, HEALTHIER  novitiates (and those further along the path) which we might  add to our nightly routine to aid with increasing our  sleep quality ? Thank you, should you have the time to respond to this, (or create such content) and thanks, regardless,  for the increased HEALTH and well-being AND MOBILITY I have gained from your tutelage. &quot;Go get &#39;em TIGER&quot; &lt;3",DanceintheRaine666,2019-08-28T20:01:12Z,0

"Hi Adriene! I love your videos, I&#39;ve been doing my classes for years and I&#39;m old at Yoga. Today, however, I had a question. I realize that you are super elongated and can get your foot and so on, but in the Butterfly posture, the Baddha Konasana, your legs do not touch the floor. I know stretching is different in each body part for each person, but as it is very easy for me to make the Butterfly and my legs fully touch the floor and yet my chest and my face touch the floor, I&#39;m wondering if you really don&#39;t have this stretch or did not want to demonstrate in the video not to impress your subscribers ?! It remains to be said that I have been practicing for over 14 years and have already taken a course to be a Yoga Instructor, but I did not conclude because I am dedicating myself to another career.

"Adriene, I have been following you and your videos for several years now. You and your videos are the reason I dove so deep into my at-home practice. Being a person who never really liked practicing in group settings I found your channel to be the perfect outlet for self-care and finding what feels good, and yoga soon became part of my daily routine as a result. <br /><br /><br />Shortly after new years eve this year I was in a pretty bad car accident that left me with a tremendously painful neck injury and a bleak outlook on what the future would hold for me as far as being physically active. After many months of physical therapy and massage, I have just now gained the comfort and confidence to jump back into my practice -- this video being my first step. <br /><br /><br />Thank you for continuing to do what you do for all these years, and for giving me a home to come back to after 7 months of being out of practice. I am no where near the level I once was, but I have never felt more hopeful than I did after this session today. Looking forward to continuing to rebuild my practice with you. Feeling nothing but gratitude.<br /><br /><br />Namaste to you and the entire YWA family across the world.",Marissa Jones,2019-08-03T19:20:20Z,0

"just recently started watching adrienes yoga and I just adore it!<br />I am a competitive athlete and am always looking at hard yoga and the deep stretches, done a few of these with Adriene now and really enjoyed.<br />Feeling particularly tired and hard done by emotionally and physically the last couple of days... stumbled upon this. It was the best treatment I could have been offered! what a lovely gift that was bought to me in such a time of distress!<br />I do actually feel the best I can possibly can be right now!<br />this woman is like the mother of love; her voice, her ways, her persona and aura... so lovely and sweet. a great teacher, not just physically but spiritually too! ...and thats what the others were missing!<br />Thank You!!!",Pookygirl,2019-07-08T19:46:40Z,0
"This video was personally one of my favorites so far along my journey. I&#39;ve been doing Yoga with Adriene for a month now and I know that everyone is different and works at different paces but what was extremely useful and beneficial for me was I started out on a beginners video for the first 2 weeks and did it twice a day every single day for 14 straight days. That helped me get extremely comfortable with the poses and from there I began slowly trying some of the other videos. I recently just began to 30 day challenge videos and tomorrow I will be on day 4 and in my opinion yoga and Adriene both ROCK, lol. Anyway I hope that my little bit of advice will help someone else who is wanting to do this so badly but doesn&#39;t know where to begin. Peace and love people!!!<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YOGAFAMILY"">#YOGAFAMILY</a> <br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NAMASTE"">#NAMASTE</a>",Christopher Simcik,2019-07-08T18:52:50Z,0

Your philosophy of Find What Feels Good works so well.  I know when to slow down, and when to challenge myself.  Benji is adorable and so are you.

"I&#39;m gonna finish this challenge this time, this feels soo good! Been trying a few times on those 30 days-challenges, but this time it&#39;s different: I&#39;m working through some trauma, and the body just doesn&#39;t ever want outside. Don&#39;t know why, but I&#39;m respecting it, and making the best of this situation. So this time, that won&#39;t &quot;come in the way&quot; and take my limited energy from me. This month I&#39;m building myself, when my therapist is on a vacation. I&#39;m confident that I can take care of myself.",Tina,2019-07-01T13:29:46Z,0

"Ive done that position plenty of times since i first started doing yoga ten years ago. Rarely gave it much attention. Re-cast as the &quot;zoolander&quot; its now my favorite and I&#39;ll be adding it to the end of every session. Absolutely love your videos, wouldnt have been able to sustain my job as a massage therapist without them. One suggestion in two parts: At the end of the titles of your videos you could put 2 or 3 &quot;scales&quot; for the pace (maybe the intensity as well) and how much space the routine requires. Sometimes I get to one of your Texas T&#39;s and I have to get up and move some small furniture about to keep going. ...also maybe a video for massage therapists! : )",michael garcia,2019-06-30T19:21:55Z,0

I love how time gets lost in your videos. It really doesn&#39;t feel like a chore to get a good workout in.

It helps ground and (re)align us with our Love-filled Spirit. Adriene, Benji, and Chris, You&#39;re three of the leading peacemakers of this time, just by being who you are and doing what you love, co-creating in that - and sharing it with us.

I&#39;m struggling with depression and anxiety a lot so it&#39;s really hard to keep me motivated, but just knowing that <b>you</b> would guide me through this, helps me feeling better already. You&#39;re such a lovely angel and your videos do so much for me that I honestly am close to tears because it takes so much pressure off of me. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll even read this but I truly wanna thank you. I only recently started doing yoga so I&#39;m ready to see and feel how much more it can benefit my mental health if I actually continue doing it regularly, which I definitely will at some point. So again, thank you so much, you really help a lot of people with this and no matter if you believe in karma or not, but I so wish all this will give you enough good karma to have a life that you can enjoy to the fullest, you only deserve the best. God I&#39;m so grateful, my emotional ass is tearing up again",Celice,2019-05-15T19:42:05Z,1

I almost feel like crying everytime I hear your voice on a yoga session or get an email from you, because you&#39;ve become a very powerful symbol to me saying; it&#39;s ok to relax, it&#39;s ok to take time for yourself. Before I was so ashamed even thinking in that way. Can&#39;t even express it to you. Me and my two cats are &quot;with you&quot; every single day on the mat. I&#39;m so so so grateful for the unconditional love you&#39;re spreading... THANK YOU. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3",Alex,2019-05-03T05:47:17Z,4

"For the whole winter I did yoga every day. I was in a bit of a slump in November and from December through March I maybe missed four days. I started with one of your 30 day challenges having done a fair amount of yoga but not a daily practice. I felt AMAZING! I had so much love and joy and graceful movement. This past month of April however, I have not been so dedicated to myself. I have slacked off in many healthy and loving aspects of my life and I have felt its toll. Today, May 2nd I showed up on my mat with your help and welcomed back in that love, joy and gratitude. My mantra for today was I choose graceful movement, and my mantra for the whole year is Graceful Acceptance, of myself, others, and daily life. You have helped me in many ways and although we do not know each other we both share a love of many things including: Austin, Barton Springs, Breakfast tacos, and loving ourselves and others.

"You asked to let you know how this session helped - I started this video in a seated cross-legged position, and usually my right foot goes in front. Today, I was having pain in my right knee in that position, so I switched to left foot in front. At the end of the video, I absent-mindedly put my right foot in front - and then noticed that I had no knee pain in that position. <br /><br />I&#39;m not saying yoga is the cure-all, just giving my testimonial about where I was when I started, and where I was 20 minutes later, in a specific pose. I still have pain elsewhere, but I&#39;m feeling much more fluid and moveable and <b>less</b> pain. Better, not perfect, is my goal. <br /><br />Also, thanks for being a part of my self-care routine. I&#39;ve gotten a lot out of having you as an instructor (via YouTube) over the last few years. I will often catch myself, when I&#39;m just standing, parting attention to my feet and if I&#39;m standing on all four corners of my feet. I am learning to accept myself and my limitations and meet myself there instead of judging myself because I can&#39;t do what someone else is doing. I&#39;m not them! I&#39;m <b>me*, and this is where *I</b> am. What I have learned from you goes far beyond the mat. Thank you.",Julia Dillenbeck,2019-04-28T14:02:55Z,2

"Hi! I am really enjoying your video&#39;s and trying to find myself a play list with a few video&#39;s that work best for my body. And I think I heard you ask for ideas for new video&#39;s. So here is one! And some context! I have pain issues, fibromyalgie and have noticed that it helps if I do some exercises regularly during the day, with a max of 25 minutes (so far).  <br /><br />Today I am having a bad day but stubborn as I am, I tried your video of Total body yoga - Deep Core. So, yeah, did not get far with that :P But I do not give up! After that I did Yoga for hips &amp; Lower back release, which did not do much but I could finish! So then I just finished with Yoga for flexibility, which turned out to be just what I needed! <br /><br />And all of that searching made me think, maybe you could do a few daily routines, like the dedicate video&#39;s but cut them up. So in the morning you have a nice stretch like the Yoga for the feet and yoga for flexibility, around lunchtime something that takes a bit more power and warming you up and in the evening a cooling down and digestion, or a different order if that is better/healthier.",rodepet,2019-04-26T14:11:20Z,0

"Hi Adriene!  I love your work and you are truly an inspiration to me, and obviously millions of others.     I share your name and preach the good word of yoga and daily practice to everyone who will listen.  Its always fun and exciting when I talk to a friend or stranger who also follows you which happens quite often!  So with all this being said I have a weird and technical question:  What kind of mic pack do you use?  <br />I&#39;m an independent filmmaker and freelance videographer who currently has a chance to book a big client who teaches prenatal workout routines and wants video content.  The format will be different from yours, but one thing that will need to be the same is quality audio which you and your team have always done beautifully.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I look forward to practicing with you soon.  <br />Namaste!",EM 3,2019-04-22T17:20:58Z,0

"I&#39;ve been feeling really negative, angry and scared lately. It&#39;s just a weird time for me, I&#39;ve been buried in work, became annoyed with most of my friends. Been shutting myself out and feeling really sensitive. I always tended to be someone who liked people and talking to them but somehow lately I&#39;ve been feeling like I can&#39;t connect and share with anyone because everyone is just wrapped up in their own drama and not interested in listening as much as talking. Everything just began feeling pointless to me. It&#39;s not like I stopped liking people or being kind to them, I just have been (secretly) nurturing this feeling of pointlessness and lack of hope. And all this negativity has been really weighing on me. Where I wanted to get with all of this is to the fact about yoga that made me come back to the mat today, the fact that it is a moment to be at the same time brutally and kindly honest with yourself. And that&#39;s why that moment in this practice when you compared it to &quot;staring into a pond and looking at your own reflection&quot; was so emotional for me. I felt so sad and scared while &quot;looking&quot; at my own reflection. I was faced with this abstract feeling that I can&#39;t connect with anyone, not even myself and that I&#39;m so terrified of what the future holds. So terrified that it will be somehow disappointing, that I&#39;l disappoint my self, that the world will feel disappointing. I am so scared of feeling pointless. But, after facing that, I feel a little, faint, spark of hope. I feel like I began (once again) healing, and that if I keep approaching this practice with honesty I may be able to, maybe, at some point, actually become the change I wanna see in the world instead of just feeling so negative and powerless. So thank you for giving me a path Adriene, it means more than you&#39;ll ever know.",Tathiana Abreu,2019-04-21T23:55:16Z,0

"Really yummy practice! ü§§ I&#39;ve been practicing with you since 2014 and it really has been (still is) the best thing I can do in my day, I love your practices because they really help me feel good in my body (so comfortable and nice) and also emotionally. However, a month ago my boyfriend of 5 years and I broke up and ever since I&#39;ve been feeling like I&#39;ve got a dagger in my upper back, right between my shoulders. I&#39;m used to this kind of muscle pain because I&#39;m constantly working on a desk, normally I would practice yoga and I would feel incredible relief and the pain would go away. But right now I feel like I&#39;m storing all the emotional bag (it&#39;s really big, I&#39;ve been feeling really sad) from the break up and its aftermath there in that spot, I haven&#39;t been sleeping very well and even though I&#39;ve been constant with the yoga practice, the pain there doesn&#39;t seem to relief at all... Sorry for the life story, Adriene, I actually just wanted to ask if you could do a practice to relief the pain in that spot I mentioned remixed or mixed up with a 2nd version of the yoga for a broken heart ? ‚ù§Ô∏è I really am thankful for you and this channel! ü•∞",amuci11,2019-04-21T17:37:54Z,0
