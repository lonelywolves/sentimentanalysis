Practice 120/365 of 2021 ✅  I always start this meditations really tense. All of my muscles contract and only by the end of it I start to loosen up. It’s like my body wants to be prepared for some attack or something. Does this happens to anybody else?,Catarina Henriques,2021-04-25T19:04:23Z,0

"This was the first meditation of the week that sort of challenged me. My ear kept clogging, my mind wandered through what today has in store, and I&#39;m guessing too much black tea this morning kept me sort of restless. I powered through though, trying to focus on my breath as much as I could, and I gotta say I&#39;m glad I did cause I had some moments of true peace even in this less than peaceful state. But I&#39;ll keep trying to get better, and that&#39;s gotta count for something :D",Una Stanković,2021-04-24T10:53:30Z,3

"I had some back issues which prevented me from doing the meditation in a seated pose, so I laid down and finished it on my back.  With spinal stenosis, the back stiffens up when I&#39;m in a seated pose for a length of time.  I take it that the session allows for a variation when performing meditation poses.  Either way, the end result was good except I have a habit of nodding off which I guess I crossed the fine line between sleep and meditation.  Oh well, will try better next time.

I know it&#39;s repeated regularly and was part of a 30 days once but can&#39;t recall which...maybe someone else can? It&#39;s an arm/hand movement that can be done sitting or standing. You bring your hands to center in a way I can&#39;t recall and then fully up and then I believe to your sides? Very meditative and a good stretch, too!

"Meditate Day 9! It is actually day ten for me but still, having done this one previously, O feel this one is a pleasant one to return to now and again. When Adriene mentions returning to the breath after a thought carries us away, I find it helpful to relax as there is an ever so slight tension that arises with thoughts. I relax that and then put on a smile as I return.",William B,2020-05-10T08:37:57Z,0

"❤ That is a tough one. I feel for you as I think many if not all of us have been where you are. Even now, years later, recalling past loves can bring tears. I find out a week and a half ago that one of mine was killed in a crash last year. It surprised me how emotional I got over that, something I felt was processed long ago. I felt it in my heart and turned it, sending out unconditional love. It seems to have helped but I am still amazed how much of that relationship came flooding back. It seems like I relived every moment in a span of two days that week. So sending you love. Keep practicing here with this great community. 💜❤",William B,2020-05-10T08:44:30Z,0

I actually got anxious over the idea of meditating if you could believe it. HOWEVER, this was the easiest meditation and the most calming I have ever done.<br />Thank you, Adriene. <br />You make trusting you so easy.<br />I&#39;m a newcomer to the YWA community and I cannot wait for the journey I&#39;ll take with you. <br />Best wishes and lots of love to you, Benji, and anyone else reading this!<br /><br />(aaand this is officially the longest YouTube comment I have ever written)",Berrak Guven,2020-05-09T19:35:15Z,1

"That mediatation really touched my heart. I felt a lot of tension in my body at the beginning and at some point my body gently started rocking from side to side and then a memory from videochatting with my girlfriend last night came up and I could feel her loving care surround me. She noticed that I was really emotional and she asked me to place the blanket that she gave to me on my shoulders, close my eyes and hug myself. She said some really lovely things and I teared up.  Then I thought about my therapist who I currently can&#39;t see in person because of the quarantine but we&#39;re communicating via skype and in my head I was in her therapy room and felt the soft carpet under my feet and a wave of gratitude for her presence and remarkable support in this difficult time washed over me. And last but not least I thought about the evening when my dog passed away on the 13th March and I remembered how I was laying next to him when he took his last breath and at this point warm and cleansing tears were already running down my face and I just experienced an incredible amount of love that I will always have for this fluffy being that helped me to save my life.",Fiona Grüger,2020-04-05T08:38:52Z,0

"Thank you for this meditation Adriene 🙏 I think I&#39;ve been doing too much too quickly lately, and as a result I&#39;ve started to feel my mind and body being overworked. One of the most important things I realized for myself is that happiness (or really any sensation) is continuous work. Whenever I feel like stopping, I have to remind myself to adjust, but keep going. I can definitely see a parallel to life as well, that if things don&#39;t work out as we plan to adjust but don&#39;t quit the process. Namaste and have a wonderful day 🙏",Jay-Ram Rajendra,2020-01-19T13:59:53Z,0

"This was the second time in about 3 months that I did this meditation. I wasn&#39;t looking for it specifically but it showed up as a recommendation from Adriene in her weekly love letter to us, so I thought why not give it a try. Halfway through I realised that, 3 months ago, when I was, for the first time in my life, battling what I experienced as severe anxiety and stress, while doing the same meditation I started crying my eyes out, something I so rarely do, without even being able to point out a specific reason or thought that had caused such a reaction.<br />Today doing the same meditation I felt amazing! And it&#39;s so wonderful to just realise how much positive change has happened in my life in the last 3 months. And all this is thanks to all the love from my friends and family, and of course thanks to you, Adriene, and the wonderful practice of yoga :) I&#39;m normally a very skeptical person, but yoga doesn&#39;t have to be about esoteric stuff. You define what yoga means for you. And you can definitely reap the scientific benefits of it. Thank you, Adriene! You are such a beautiful human being. Please keep showing up on the mat for us, and we&#39;ll keep showing up for you. :)",EmpireFaith,2020-01-19T13:57:17Z,0

"I’ve only recently started doing meditation with the help of Adrianne’s video so I’m quite new to it all. But I’ve started to notice that after a few minutes of getting into a more meditative state and noticing and deepening my breath, I start to feel slightly nauseous. Does anyone have any idea why that might be? I can’t quite figure out if it’s physical and connected to trying to deepen my breath or if it’s psychological since I’m under a lot of stress and pressure at the moment. It does make meditating a bit more difficult since I find myself wishing it to be over even though I really appreciate this time...",Ziva D,2019-11-18T23:17:02Z,0

"Today I used this as a background to the specific stretches I felt I needed for the joints and muscles that were most crying out for some love (my uni&#39;s lecture theatres are not at all ergonomic and four hours of lectures yesterday played havoc with my right shoulder). Syncing up with the meditation for the last two minutes made the perfect combo of grounding my mind and rebalancing my body. <br />Thank you Adriene for teaching me for the first time in my life how to truly listen to my body and then give it what it most needs. And thank you in particular from my poor right wrist and shoulder!

I’ve wanted for the longest time to try yoga and so i decided today to try it after gym. I first did the beginners yoga and liked it very much so I wanted to try this mental yoga as well. I’d say I have a “healthy mind” always positive. Is it weird that I wanted to cry a little while doing this and that an actual tear ran down my face. It was more like an overwhelming feeling rather than anything else. Thank you for this ❤️,Emilly Falck,2019-10-23T11:39:19Z,0

I was recently diagnosed with PTSD and I am on medication but I just started following you and doing your relaxing exercises. Thank you so much! 💞",Ladybug Lane Soaps,2019-08-19T19:51:06Z,0

I&#39;ve done meditation before and did it for 10 days, but then stopped. So, I decided to try this out tonight, and I felt so much better, and as if a weight was just lifted from my shoulders.

I&#39;m quite comfortable now to say that lately I feel like I lost my desire one at a time. Like I don&#39;t have the burning desire to do almost everything even to get up from my bed.. I don&#39;t want to show up. Feel uncomfortable to go outside. Feeling total emptiness more and more everyday. I&#39;m confuse of myself. But this meditation quite helps me with how I control my breathing.

"Very glad that this suggestion popped up on the screen right after I finished up the video for Concentration &amp; Focus. This allowed me to round off the morning practice with some steadiness and loving kindness. <br />Yay for the fifth consecutive day of doing yoga since I discovered this channel. I naturally wake up very early, but typically spend my mornings reading and playing on my phone, thinking about how I should be exercising instead. Not today!

"Adriene, I love you and your videos. You are like a friend to me, and someone I can trust. I enjoy your other classes, I enjoy your way of teaching and inclusion and how you instruct. However, I have to say that I feel like you talk too much during these meditation videos, a process that is meant to be somewhat quiet, and it makes it impossible for me to go inward. A less talkative and instructive/suggestive meditation video would probably be appreciated by many. Perhaps you could include it on your membership site. Thank you for all you do and the heart you put into your work. Namaste 🙏🏾",J J,2019-06-10T16:14:20Z,0

"Ive been doing your videos for a little over a year now and I use to have really bad anxiety but you have helped me tremendously learn to take control and let go all at the same time. If that makes sense...just wanted to say thank you. I still sometimes struggle with anxiety but whenever i feel a trigger or stuck, I can always find a video perfect for helping me get through it. Thank you🙏",Star Williams,2019-05-05T23:57:16Z,0
"Hey Adriene. I just finished my shift over here in Paris. I&#39;ve been working a lot with anxiety and anger these past few years. A couple of friends recommended your videos, as a way to slow down and work on my inner peace. It&#39;s been only a couple of weeks but it&#39;s worked wonders; I&#39;ve noticed it especially with how I handle my work and my energy, my back pains and my fit of angers. A few weeks ago i tried to meditate but my back hurt too much. Today, I thought, it&#39;s about more than that, and I&#39;ve proven myself to be able to go beyond a lot of things I thought I wasn&#39;t able to do, both physically and emotionaly. I went through the whole video tonight. I&#39;m waking up in a few hours for a short holiday with the person I love and I feel serene. Like I haven&#39;t been in years, maybe ever. So thanks for this. Thanks for sharing and caring. It&#39;s truly wonderful to be able to feel like this. Have a good week.",Garance Le bars,2019-05-05T23:45:15Z,0

"Restarting my yoga as of today but had to do this one first due to your May 1st routine not coming out until midnight my time (I’ll always be a day behind in following your monthly calendar, but that’s okay) and I have to say I loved sitting on my blocks and having my hips elevated ... very comfortable position. The breathing in this one was super helpful as well due to the fact that I struggle terribly with anxiety which can severely affect your breathing in a negative way. I’m trying to use yoga to gradually wean off a pretty high-powered anxiety medication. I’m positive I can do it with your videos. Thank you so much for all you do, Adriene (and Benji!)! P.S. I have three dogs and they left me alone until the end, then one of them (who is a 38-lb “lap baby”) had to help me by trying to get under my right arm as I was doing the hands-to-heart portion 🙏🏻💕 ...

So I came here, in hope of calming myself down, taking control of my breath and dont let my thoughts waver me to a place I dont wanna see myself be at.

"Hi Adriene :) I&#39;ve been following you since March. I&#39;ve hit bottom at the time, and I knew what it meant staying there. I&#39;ve been down for 2 weeks then, didn&#39;t want to do anything, didn&#39;t want to sleep &#39;cuz then I had to wake up and do things, and this drowe me mad. I hated feeling like this, I&#39;m not the worlds most cheerful person, but that feeling of the void was something else. I was doing yoga since summer the previos year, but it was just physical and when I hit bottom I found you and I did Dedicate. It was the best most I&#39;ve ever had doing yoga. I did it every day, and I was so excited what kind of practise is next, what are going to do. I changed that month, physically and mentally as well and for the better. Now yoga isn&#39;t just physical practise for me, it&#39;s ME TIME :D where I feel good (not all the time, and that&#39;s fine too :) ). Thank you for all of it, YOU ARE THE BEST ^_^ &lt;3",eli warner,2019-04-29T16:32:59Z,2

"Slowing down helped me to notice that I hold a lot of tension in my throat, jaw and face. Adriene, any chance you could do a video focusing on this issue? I think it&#39;s an often overlooked area where many people feel the effects of stress, and your videos have been a lifesaver for me with so many other problems so I couldn&#39;t think of anyone better to tackle this one!",Rosie Jones,2019-04-29T15:20:43Z,0

"Adriene, I just wanted to give you so many thanks for how much your videos have been helping me for the past few weeks. I&#39;ve been suffering some very severe anxiety and depression which seems to escalate and escalate with time, but a few weeks ago, my boyfriend and I found your videos and we&#39;re absolutely addicted to how good they make us feel. You&#39;ve given us another way to connect and support each other through a yoga practice, and you&#39;ve given me something to get out of bed for and to center and relax my mind and body when I need it the most. This was my first meditation with you and to be honest I found it very difficult to be still and focus, but I&#39;ll keep trying with you and bettering myself every day.

How can I even get out of bed when I’ve got all this back and fourth going on in my head? Is there any peace? Is there ever any silence? I pray to the most high that I find it. Then I remember I saved this video last night. I don’t feel like tapping in or sitting still...still...I sit up tall, grab my crystals, and rest my back against my bedroom wall. Inhale. Exhale. I’m starting to feel better now. Inhale. Exhale. Your sweet voice harmonizing with the inner peace I’ve found. Thank you so much.

It felt so good to meditate. I tend to have an overly active mind and have a hard time getting into the habit of taking even just a few minutes a day to meditate and slow it down.

At this point I should also say I&#39;m massively grateful to be able to access the healthcare I needed to treat it (and free here in the UK). For the time when it has been scary having tests, not knowing what was wrong and managing pain, it has been so helpful to return to the breath practised you have shared again and again.

"Feeling lazy to get out of bed today. I might give myself another hour of sleep on this Sunday morning. This came in right when i need it. Getting ready to do it in bed and i know it&#39;ll be enough to wake me up to the rest of the day. Adriene coming to the rescue yet again giving us yogis a tap on the shoulder, a bro fist, and a wake up call that we&#39;ve all got this despite the chaos going on inside our heads. Thanks for the soothing practice Adriene. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-04-28T05:40:11Z,22

"Adriene, I&#39;ve been doing yoga with you every day for the past three months or so and you have helped me through so much, including the stress of my undergrad dissertation. My housemate has started joining me in my practice and he adores you, too. We always say how Adriene is our best friend! You&#39;ve changed the way I approach my day and the way I see my body. Thank you and much love",Annachiara Vispi,2019-04-28T05:16:46Z,517
