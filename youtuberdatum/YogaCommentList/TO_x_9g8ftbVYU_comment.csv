"What kind of risk taker will you be today?<br />A playful one? A curious one?<br /><br />Be kind, stay safe. <br /><br />But darling, <br /><br />Go for it.",Yoga With Adriene,2019-06-09T14:16:06Z,473
Thank you adriene  the risk takers and anyone else who is taking part in the march move calender.<br />Im a few days late but its all fun hopping around our yoga mats with a 8 month puppy near the yoga mat.<br />Namaste and thanks to the community during lockdown.<br />We can all lean on each other.(bill withers song),Louise Edgington,2021-03-18T11:04:39Z,0
"Dear Adriene, thank you so much for all your time and energy. I enjoy your video&#39;s a lot and although my chaotic personality makes it impossible for me to do any same thing every day I find myself on the yoga mat with you at least 4 times a week. I&#39;ve been doing this for 4 years and it&#39;s really made my life better.<br />Although I really love your videos and I usually enjoy every minute of them, the last few weeks I&#39;ve felt a lot of resistance. Maybe this sounds really stupid but I find that when I&#39;m in a certain state of mind (read:irritated) I prefer video&#39;s where there&#39;s only directions and no other information or conversation.<br />Maybe this is a stupid question but would it maybe be possible to make a playlist with video&#39;s that are not as talkative (is that the right word? Sorry not a native English speaker)<br /><br />I hope you understand and please know that 95% of the time I love, love, love your quirkiness and jokes. It&#39;s just that in the pandemic days I sometimes really can&#39;t handle people speaking to me in the morning üòÖ<br /><br />Thank you again for you wonderful work!",Zarah Gwenan,2021-03-17T09:12:58Z,0

I absolutely loved this video!  Adriene gives the clearest instructions on how to do crow pose.  I was able to balance for a split second with her help and guidance.

I got closer to crow than I have gotten before. I think it was important to get the outward rotation of the arms goin&#39; on for me. I really agree with what you said at the end about the courage to show up and be ourselves. It feels especially risky these days with cancel culture being such a &quot;thing&quot;.

"I¬¥m a daily risk taker as I¬¥m a Forex trader, and what I¬¥ve learned is that the is no gain if one does not take risks. But one must always limit one¬¥s risk or else things can turn-out ugly... In reality we as humans are taking risks constantly during our day whilst driving, working, doing sports or what ever activity we engage in. The biggest risk is not taking any risk",Ricardo,2021-03-11T10:52:38Z,1

"for some months now i&#39;ve been accompanied by periods where i feel short of breath (not corona-related, doctor says it might well be anxiety). since this started, when doing yoga sometimes limbs of me will suddenly start feeling numb or, you know, have this tingly feeling. does anybody experience this also? like right now when i was just bowing down and then into crow, my feet and lower legs started tingling hard... i never had this before, so just wondering whether other people experience the same or know why this happens",J Grds,2020-10-03T16:44:14Z,0

"I&#39;m so excited that I&#39;m commenting here cause I need to share. I&#39;ve been practicing yoga on and off through the years and decided that, with the whole Covid-19 thing and needing to stay at home, I should get back on the mat (I&#39;ve been social distancing for two or three months now).<br />My arms have always been really weak and that was mainly the reason I would stop practicing, I would get disheartened and quit when I thought I had failed (I&#39;ve never been known to have a healthy mindset about stuff...). But this time I said no way, I&#39;m gonna keep it up, it&#39;s okay if I can&#39;t make it.

"TLDR: getting fired sucks, living off of your art is terrifying, yoga made me feel not so scared ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®<br />So two days ago I got fired from my new job, fired for the first time ever. At the same time I‚Äôve been prepping for an art show and got two different invitations to apply to other art happenings coming up later on. I‚Äôve been super stressed attempting to balance the entire thing. So stressed to the point that my body has started to manifest physical symptoms and I had one of the worst panic attacks I‚Äôve had in a long time three days ago. So after I was let go I completely broke down in my living room to my live in SO, he asked me what I wanted to do, what made me happy I said only art and meditation and yoga, that kind of stuff. To which he answered; then do that, I‚Äôve got your back and you‚Äôre brave, you can do this. So after feeling bad for myself the last two days I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm going to give it a shot, take a risk and see how far my art can take me. <br />But, I knew I needed my mat... it‚Äôs been so hard just to get here and convince myself I am worthy of the work to self sooth and to grow. <br />I hit the mat today finally, and wept when you said I was brave. The acute fear I had about trying to branch out on my own works is much less severe, I feel like if I work consistently and with patience like I try to do with my self, maybe I can peruse my dream. My ankle and hip have unlocked (I have a pinched nerve that flares up if I‚Äôve not been paying attention to it or am dealing with a load of stress) and I feel like I can finally breathe. And I‚Äôm going to try to work for myself  in the best ways that I can. <br />Thank you for always being here, Adriene ‚ù§Ô∏è you truly are my hero. <br />PS. I almost kinda did crow, ü•≥something I‚Äôve not been able to quite master yet.",angela bleibtrey,2019-06-24T20:50:03Z,4

Hello Adriene from Jim...Bradford -West Yorkshire - UK.<br />Could I please politely ask if you would become a &#39;Brave Browser&#39; verified user. This way we can start to reward you with BAT - Brave attention tokens - in effect...I will pay you for watching your videos. Further to that you will still benefit from Youtube payments. I am not affiliated with either so absolutely no benefit to me if you choose not to get on this runaway train in terms of the way we will all do our banking and finances in the not too distant future. The only benefit to me is the most important one of all...not financial but will give me the chance to reward what you have so selflessly given thus far to my wife and I which has helped transformed our lives for so any reasons. I am an early Bitcoin adopter (2011) and have the last eight to nine years experience in all things Blockchain/crypto. With that in mind I hope you will be open minded with my request.,Jim Waddington,2019-06-11T13:54:48Z,0

"After doing yoga nearly daily since January I&#39;ve gained 10 pounds! I was underweight before with bad posture and a lack of appetite due to my depression but after doing yoga for a few weeks I became really hungry so I listened to my body. Now those 10 pounds I needed to be at a healthy weight have showed up in my arm muscles, my abs, my bum, and my thighs. Riding my bike to work is easier now and I feel like I have a lot more power behind my movements in daily life ... and I&#39;m excited to be showing off my strong core at the beach instead of all my ribs!

"@Mrs. Shaver&#39;s Pages Yes! So glad it resonated with you! I definitely felt blamed for losing weight as if I did it on purpose for attention but my depression literally just steals the flavour and enjoyment from food. Nobody gave me any tools to maintain my appetite they just blamed and accused me. That shame just added to the issue until I was gaunt. Then of course I looked in the mirror and felt disgusting so it would ramp up my depression even more. Yoga really empowered me to believe that I could create some balance for myself and I have kept the weight on consistently ever since! I wish all the same success for you!

I&#39;m lucky to maintain, to hang on, to wake up, to do much of anything at all. But I definitely need courage. And I definitely could use some more balance.

Good day world. I recently read Eat That Frog by Brian Tracy and started a challenge to cultivate this habit of eating the biggest &quot;frog&quot; first prior to doing anything else. I swear this video is the perfect complement to that experience to help me build this habit of risk taking. Feeling amazing again on this Sunday morning thanks to Adriene reminding me to count my blessings rather than whining and moaning about what I currently don&#39;t have. Thanks for the lovely practice Adriene. Much love. Namaste.,Shadan Zahrooni,2019-06-09T05:15:03Z,9
