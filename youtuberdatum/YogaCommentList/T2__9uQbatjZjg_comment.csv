Even though we are supposed to have accustomed to quarantine im back at home and lately I’ve been having zero energy and I hate it. But I just learnt the best way to come out from it is to refresh and be gentle doing little tasks each day until I feel better. Dang sometimes i forget how good yoga with Adrienne is, she transmits warmth and energy to me.

"Goddamn Adriene. I cannot express how much this practice helped me. I fell out of my routine of doing yoga after practicing for a month and a half straight with your 30 day challenges, and today I felt so shitty. I felt like I was falling into a depression and I could feel it in my body. It&#39;s hard to explain. But I figure others who deal with depression will understand. <br />This practice helped me SO much. And now I feel confident in myself that I can get back on track now and go back into practicing everyday and finishing my goal of 6 months of yoga. (That&#39;s another thing you and this community taught me: Just because we fall out of practice, doesn&#39;t mean we have to start all over again. We&#39;re just getting back onto the bus, we haven&#39;t &quot;back-tracked&quot;) <br />Thank you thank you thank you Adriene. I hope you understand how much you&#39;ve helped me, and changed my life. And I&#39;m sure many others would say the same. You have some special spot up in heaven.",DeShong,2020-12-03T23:03:33Z,0

"Hey Adrienne, I feel the need to share with you today.... I am a recovering drug addict. I suffered a spinal fracture some years ago and the &quot;medecine&quot; they prescribed did help me tremendously in the start but it later turned into such a dependency I ended up being way worse off then I had ever imagined...that being said I have been sober for years now and well ya pretty much found your online goodness and haven&#39;t looked back. Your videos have been instrumental in my recovery. Sire I don&#39;t bend all that well but I don&#39;t give up and learned to not over extend. Its the breathing that im connecting with and finding much relief. The clincher for me was your dog. My dogs name is Benji too! Turning to spirit and energy for healing that was the sign from the universe to follow your practice so just letting you know what you are putting out there is working. Much love much respect and boatloads of gratitude, thank you Adrienne 😊 🙏 ❤",Daniel Fontaine,2020-12-03T13:55:49Z,0

"Before stepping into &quot; Easy Stretching &quot; of Yoga , Educate yourself , It&#39;s an exercise of Mind, Body, Soul ... It&#39;s going to re-shape your entire Belief system in no time , It&#39;s a cult ... It&#39;s not what&#39;s it seems , It&#39;s a Deception of never ending rabbit-hole and going to open you for energies that you never had perceived off .",11.eleven._*,2020-11-18T15:43:11Z,0

"Started this practice crying (particularly when you talked about how we&#39;re feeling empty or lost inside), but ended it feeling like things might end up being okay. There&#39;s a lot of depression and change in my life, two things that don&#39;t really go along well, so this practice was just what I needed. Thank you Adriene for acknowledging that life can be tough and that you have our back. So important to spread the message that it&#39;s okay not to be okay, but that these feeling will also pass again.<br />Much love from Europe! (Also very impressed with your engagement on social media, very happy that the will of the people worked out in your favor!!)",BesondersBesonders,2020-11-18T10:10:23Z,0

"1st I have to say I just love these videos and I have followed Adriene for years and I have no plans of stopping. Yoga has healed me and taken away most of my fibromyalgia pain and depression. It has saved my life. The other day I was told by some people that Yoga is evil and it will lead to the devil. Please help me understand this if you know anything about it. I have looked it up and it looks like Christians do not agree with the teachings of the &quot;new age&quot; like crystals, meditation, kundalini. It sounds crazy to me. I would like some reassurance from my yoga friends.",C,2020-11-10T19:13:05Z,0

"Thank you for this practice. My work at home has taken over the perfect yoga space in my home since it is also the perfect space for work at home. The space is still here, but after an intense two weeks back in August, I have had an extremely difficult time making the mental shift to allow this to still be my perfect yoga space. There are other spaces in my home where I could (and sometimes do) do yoga, but this one is perfect. It took me weeks to figure out &quot;what my problem was,&quot; but now I am working on taking over this space for yoga without hesitation! I saved this practice that was posted the other day, and it was PERFECT for this morning!!!

"Hi Adriene! I am 15 years old and I have been doing your videos pretty much every day since March! You bring such a relaxation, calmness, and peace to my days! I am so thankful for you and Benji, you guys have helped me get through a very difficult time in my life and I am so grateful. The struggle I am going through causes somewhat of a disconnect between mind body, and spirit. I was doing yoga during my hardest time but just doing the weight loss and workout practices. Ever since I have started recovering I think I become more in tune, kind, and loving to my body every day and yoga is a clear manifestation of that which is really cool to see! You have helped me so so much, and thank you for everything you do! I feel like you and Benji are my friends and I could not be more thankful for you.<br />Also, if you are looking for suggestions I think a yoga for perfectionism would be really great! I am looking forward to YWA November! Love you so much and give Benji a kiss from me!",Megan Reimer,2020-10-30T13:54:17Z,0

My favourite youtube channel cuz:<br />A) it’s Adriene<br />B) it’s at home yoga<br />C) all humans(and pets) in this community are so kind and caring and supportive! The comments section proves how much gentleness is there in the world if we’re willing to look in the right places<br />D) it is absolutely incredible: the things you do on the mat and how they affect your life off the mat. I am an interning doctor and have been super busy off late and just 20-30 minutes completely change my outlook on the work I have to do. The hip openers always leave me super emotional and in tears for some reason and that is so cathartic and liberating.<br />Lots of love and light to you all!,prarthana chandra,2020-10-30T11:49:17Z,0
"You definitely hit the spot with this one Adriene. It not only left me feeling more energised, but also my dog Lady. She had laid still by the mat all practice until you called Benji to come back over and she sat up with her ears pricked and then decided to sit on me and join in with the lying on your back shaking your legs and arms, it was hilarious. She then went on to jump around like a puppy throwing her hedgehog shaped dental stick in the air wanting to play (she rarely does this now being 12).....so thankyou for your beautiful energy and sharing the love both with me and my lovely Lady xo",Annabel Fawcus,2020-10-30T11:19:28Z,0

So, even being sleepy and sad, I told myself I should do yoga. When I saw this title, I realized this is exactly what I need. :D My body is so grateful, it needed yoga so bad these weeks.

"Hey Adriene, I know you probably won&#39;t see this but I began yoga by watching your videos a few months ago and it&#39;s the only physical activity that I find myself actually yearning to do. This one in particular struck a chord for me, it&#39;s been the most stressful month of my life and every single day has been nonstop in every aspect of my life. I forced myself to practice for the first time in a week today because of how busy I&#39;ve been and this video popped up; it was the first time I actively expressed gratitude in a little over a week as well, and ngl, it brought me to tears lol. Just wanted you/anyone who happens to be reading this who may not know if yoga is worth it to start, to know that it definitely is and that it&#39;s changed my life and has definitely made today in particular take a 180 degree turn. I am so grateful to have found your channel. Thank you!!!",Bailee Trytko,2020-10-29T20:01:47Z,2

"You see me, Adriene. You know, without me telling you, my depression has been running high. Because I&#39;m not the only one. I&#39;ve done this video twice now this week because I need it. It&#39;s easy but gets my blood flowing which in turn settles my mind. Blood flow is so key to mental health. I know &quot;dead&#39; is in relation to Halloween but it&#39;s also just so fitting to how I&#39;ve been feeling. My depression has been roaring for so long and I&#39;m so tired of those nasty thoughts. It feels like my mind is slowly killing me but when I crawl onto the mat yoga helps me battle those thoughts back into a big creek instead of the amazon river.  So thank you for &quot;being there&quot; for me and for everyone else who fights this same battle. You are a light in people&#39;s darkness. <br />Your themes, your comments, your jokes, Benji, they all accumulate and are helpful. I appreciate you encouraging people to take action for their self-care and even to take action and vote. I see you on social media. lol Your message of telling people their in/actions matter and have consequences. No matter how small an action, no matter how obscure a person feels they all contribute to the whole that is life. <br />Thank you &lt;3<br />Namaste &lt;3",Emily Dodge,2020-10-29T17:09:06Z,169

I am new to yoga although I have been meaning to get involved for some time but the busy life and a touch of laziness etc meant I&#39;ve been taking my time getting round to it. Then the coronavirus reared it&#39;s ugly head and we were in strict lockdown for 2 months and I suddenly had lots of spare time which eventually led to some reflection on my general living,  I searched for some beginners yoga on the tube, found your channel and realised the potential of yoga in literally one session so I thank you for that.

"Feeling &quot;dead inside&quot; isn&#39;t some Halloween season joke. It&#39;s not something to play with spooky music and dramatized makeup. If you want to make halloween content, maybe consider halloween for ghouls or vampires, which gets at the same mood. Feeling dead inside is the only words I myself have, and many of my other friends have, to describe crippling depressions and/or suicidal tendencies. I don&#39;t know anything about you, maybe you have experienced your own mental health crisis that left you literally unable to feel joy, find peace, or care about anything at all. When someone says they feel dead inside, you should worry. You should offer support and ask how you can help.  You should encourage people who express that mood to reach out for help.  I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t mean this title/theme to be hurtful or triggering, but I hope this has made you aware that it very much is.",orangeisastupidword,2020-10-27T01:35:30Z,0

"Love this! So appropriate in so many ways. I am grateful to start each morning with Yoga With Adriene and this was the candy in my trick-or-treat bag today! Today I practiced with 3,142 of you good people! Scrolling through the comments here from this supportive community--it&#39;s unanimous, we all feel dead inside. Here&#39;s a trick-or-treat for you all from Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley&#39;s great work, Frankenstein. They are all so appropriate I couldn&#39;t narrow it down to just one.<br />“Nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change.” <br />“Beware; for I am fearless, and therefore powerful.” <br />“Life, although it may only be an accumulation of anguish, is dear to me, and I will defend it.” <br />“I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.&quot;   <br />Happy Halloween!",Nessa Roffredo,2020-10-25T15:54:42Z,0

Well, I tried and cried and cursed and giggled and felt an overwhelming sense of &#39;welcome home&#39;.

What I learned from today&#39;s practice is that sometimes we aren&#39;t ready for the shift until we&#39;ve acknowledged the state. For instance, we might not click &#39;Yoga for Self-Forgiveness&#39; say, if we&#39;re still in the &#39;I messed up&#39; headset?

"Hadn’t done your video practices in some time now, but the title caught my I so i did. Lovely, it was just enough to get the juices flowing and extract me from doing nothing and just worrying. Loved the makeup business, the MUSIC! LOL and the dead bug biz. Just enough seriousness and heavy emo for the times, with a little black humor thrown in. U could do an ‚undead‘ video for Halloween, where we can, while acknowledging the seriousness of the times, just give in a bit to silly, and walk the arched cat  back and forth across the screen, do pretend dressup and let out a lions ROAR (in some sort of pseudo lion position, you know how they round their heads when they do that), going to some other animals, neck-stretching giraffe, Elefant walk—-all walking back and forth across the screen, just briefly. I know, kids stuff, and its not yoga. But you are creative and maybe you could integrate something along theses lines. Thanks so much Adrienne!",Sharon Mueller,2020-10-25T12:34:46Z,0

You are such an amazing gift to the world, you are important too. Why not let people repeat a video or two and take the rest you deserve.

"@Amber Kendle It&#39;s not that I&#39;m not used to online schooling, I&#39;ve been doing it for eight years now without school teachers and have been fine so far. The problem though is the fact that the school board has taken the in person curriculum courses and put them in an online setting.

Grieving a loved one is so painful, one minute one day at a time,  we fall back again and again until one day we&#39;re stepping forward more than backwards. Hold on to the memory of your mum as you go through life. When the time is right I wish for you to find someone to love and cherish you. You being an orphan is sad 😥 but it&#39;s not a negative trait.

"Feel connected to all of us in this global community, dear Joel. There might be a lot who know how you feel - I do know what it feels like. Hope you can find relief in the yoga practice and in the small little things that are still beautiful and surround us at any time and remind us to keep looking and breathing and living for them. God bless you, take care and feel a big hug and love from Germany 💛",Essay,2020-10-25T10:24:46Z,0
