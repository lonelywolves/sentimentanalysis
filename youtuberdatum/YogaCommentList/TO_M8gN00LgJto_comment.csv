"I haven&#39;t been on the mat for 6months. I couldn&#39;t bring myself to the January programme, everything was wrong and I couldn&#39;t do it. Then my dad died of Covid and time went by. This morning Adriene popped up on facebook, inviting us to view her vlog, which was lovely, and I noticed today&#39;s March 15th practice was this. It seemed to be pulling me in. At the moment little happenings like this seem to come from my dad, encouraging me onward. I do hope this is a new start on the mat. This was just right. Thank you Adriene xx",Mich Stratford,2021-03-15T12:27:11Z,1

I loved the way this practice got my heart pumping, reminding me that I am still alive ;) When I did the prayer position at the beginning, I noticed that the humble hands helped me to feel moldable by the hands of the Master.

"Almost skipped today&#39;s practice bc I have a migraine, but I didn&#39;t want to ruin my daily yoga goal for 2021. I figured &quot;I&#39;ll just skip poses/modify&quot;. 5 minutes in my migraine pain was...not gone, but not as important somehow. Maybe it was conscious focus on the breath? Perhaps it was just the zen like state I fell into? No idea, but it felt joyful and calm and full of relief. I ended up not having to modify anything; in fact, I seemed to have more flexibility today than I normally do... bodies are weird, man. Today really proved that these YWA practices are essential to my daily life 😅",Leslie,2021-03-15T23:54:14Z,4

"I&#39;m loving MOVE so much! I&#39;ve been doing YWA videos on and off for about three years and this is the most consistent I&#39;ve ever been: 73 days in a row! I&#39;m feeling super connected to mind, heart, and body which has been so helpful and has gotten me out of some parts of a pandemic-induced funk. When doing a wide legged forward fold I tried to put my head on the matt and fully flipped over - I had a good laugh after &lt;3",Madison BS,2021-03-15T22:38:37Z,1
"For the first time in a long time, I have been doing yoga 2-3x/week thanks to YWA making it accessible in so many ways! <br /><br />My only criticism of this session is why the fastest, most heat-building transitions and poses were in the last 2/5 of the class. (within the last 10 minutes). For such a short class I would have loved the heat to be around 10-15 minutes in leaving enough time to cool down and wrap up at the end. <br /><br />Otherwise, absolutely fabulous. Reading others&#39; comments, I now kind of wish I had that same crying catharsis during this session. May have to do it again and be even more present. I think I&#39;m still in &quot;just got home from work&quot; mode. ;)",Bari Morchower Guzikowski,2021-03-15T22:25:54Z,0

Today i choose self-care and healing. Today i was hurting and it was self-inflicted and i&#39;m not okay with doing that to myself. I often push myself too far and that is rarely a good thing to do. This week in MOVE i will be working hard to learn how to put myself without it ending up in me being hurt. In martial arts i push myself too much and likewise with schoolwork. Tomorrow and the rest of today i will be trying extra hard not to do that! Thank you for this practice Adriene &lt;3 Namaste,eviee grace,2021-03-15T17:04:54Z,1

"When she said that things on the mat are sometimes applicable to life off the mat, I thought of those cycles she went through of the three-legged dog and lunges, especially the high ones. I realized I was &quot;bad&quot; at them at a faster rate, but I am better when going slow, when I have time to ground myself and figure things out, adjust my hips, my stomach, etc. <br />And while setting an intention, I thought, &quot;faith&quot; first of all, since I&#39;m going through a bible devotional at the moment that&#39;s about faith, and then I thought &quot;to be more active, physically and mentally.&quot; And that was kind of a lightbulb moment, because I always think about productivity, but changing &quot;I should be more productive&quot; to &quot;I should be more active&quot; feels a whole lot nicer.<br /><br />maybe I should take a shot before every yoga practice lol",Sarah Leeann,2021-01-20T19:31:37Z,0

I especially miss my 2 two sons who have taken up residence with their Dad. Isolation here is still in stage 4 restrictions and our movements are drastically restricted. I get out for shopping and some limited work hours. I will think of your message and silently express gratitude for the good and the wellbeing I have.

"I couldn&#39;t stop crying throughout the whole practice. I just lost my home and all my work gear for my music after the explosion that happened in Beirut last week. It was very devastating after the corrupt government instilled in us this thought that we do not deserve freedom or any form of happiness. I have continuously told myself that I&#39;ll never have a future and that I will never be able to make it as a musician to Europe or the US, because I always believed that I was always doomed simply from where I was from. This video helped me a lot, thank you for sharing your charm Adrienne. It shows that Love has no race, language or expense.

My intention was &#39;To find the courage to grieve&#39;. I am going through some big life transitions at the moment (I thought I was at the threshold of them, but I feel that the train has well and truly left the station). I intend to grieve the things that are ending, that are changing. And by feeling those emotions, I felt the rush of energy, that I can only assume is contributing to my rebirth. Joy, possibility, strength, hope. I loved this practice and the opportunity this channel gives me to connect to my body and the my spirit. It feels like such essential work for me.

It&#39;s like either a) YT can literally read my mind OR b) the universe is just totally synched up and manifesting exactly what I need. <br />Thanks for all you do &lt;3,Emily Pickett,2020-04-23T07:33:44Z,0

"Hey everyone I just want to inform you that there are in fact other stretches than like just Yoga and some of the poses and Namaste stuff is actually kind of demonic if you look into the specific poses you&#39;ll see it there are probably star signs and sun signs and stuff, I&#39;m a christian and sometimes I watch Adrian&#39;s stuff and she has really helped with upper back problems or strenuous tasks I&#39;ve done and had no way of escape so she&#39;s been a blessing to me at times but the point is that Yoga is attracting, it has a spiritual charm to the sound of it and even excites you to hear it, but I&#39;ve found some other more motivating exercise videos as well so don&#39;t just stop here keep searching!! There&#39;s not just one way of doing stretches or exercises!! There are so so many ❤🌷⚘🌸🌷🌼⚘💥💛",Anna M,2019-10-14T15:16:46Z,0

"Thank you Adriene.  Returning to my mat for this rebirth practise felt like all the stars had aligned.  Starting my cycle again today after the birth of my daughter 7.5 months ago bought with it a wave of emotions and a need to &#39;surrender to that which I can&#39;t control&#39;. The last seven and a half months has been a time of sheer joy and deep anguish, but I am reminded today, that everything has it&#39;s season and we are all going through constant transitions and rebirths, just like my baby girl does daily.  Surrendering is the only way when everything feels so completely out of your control, isn&#39;t it? All our love, Melissa &amp; Cleo &lt;3 x",Melissa Harper,2019-10-14T08:59:17Z,0

"I have been dealing with my loved son&#39;s addiction for 6 years now. In the past it would drag me down to a dark hole of sadness. I have been doing Yoga with Adrienne for almost a year now. It is amazing how the everyday practice of a few minutes of yoga slowly starts building a better you. Every morning  a little drop of goodness slowly fills your cup. I noticed that I am not letting the world cave in on top of me, my intentions at the beginning of each yoga session always include love, healing and recovery. My love for my son continues solid. My journey as a mom is not easier, but is fuller of light. The daily deep breathing and the awareness of my body have turned the journey easier to bear and more fun.

Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. <br /><br />As always, consult your doctor/physician before starting and follow their advice. xx",Yoga With Adriene,2019-10-03T14:53:39Z,0

"Your practice themes always seem to come at such a right time. I&#39;ve been coming out of an abusive relationship and beginning a long healing journey of therapy, notably dealing with deep deep intergenerational trauma. Everything is cyclical but hopefully the cycles of abuse and trauma are ones that can be broken. Yoga has always been an integral part of my healing journeys (those are cyclical as well). I&#39;ve been noticing the segments in which breathing becomes more difficult; in balasana my breathing feels constricted, and during the vinyasa I was unable to take full breaths. I think that to notice this and perhaps to work on it in the context of a yoga practice will help me notice and breathe better through the times in my life where even that is difficult.

"Thank you so much for this video, Adriene. The theme of rebirth really connected with me. <br /><br />I&#39;m about to finally finish my bachelor studies and to start off into a gap year full of possibilities before I begin with my master&#39;s degree. <br /><br />Right now, I feel a little lost concerning what to prioritize this year and a little anxious about &quot;wasting time&quot;. I haven&#39;t done Yoga IN AGES  because I was so busy working on my bachelor&#39;s thesis. And since I finished my thesis I&#39;ve mainly spent time sick in bed or procrastinating, not knowing what of the many things on my to-do-list to do first.<br /><br /><br />But today, I&#39;ve started yoga again by joining you in this video. Lately, I&#39;ve also started reading books not related to my studies again and met a lot of friends I could&#39;t spend time with during the last stressful year. I have so many things I want to do in the upcoming year: learning the language of my ancestors and traveling to the home country of my mother, learning a programming language, practicing yoga more regularly, widening my knowledge on topics that are not discussed in my studies. Finding out about my identity and my place in this world. Making new (scary) experiences and surviving them and growing and becoming more independent.<br /><br /><br />I really hope that the positive energy I felt in this video will stay with me during the whole year and that I can realise my plans and wishes. Your work is a treasure to me.",Die Bücherprinzessin,2019-10-02T11:04:55Z,0

"Adriene, I hardly ever comment but I had to let you know your perfect timing  with this theme. Bought out first house in a new town and moved in over the weekend.  We started the kids at their new school today, which feels scary for MOM surprisingly. House full of unpacked boxes and then we got a puppy! It&#39;s been an eventful  weekend and so many things feel unsettled. I start a new job next Monday after 11 years (since graduation!) At the current one. All this to say thanks for being you and showing up for us every single week! You are an inspiration and after following this video I have a positive feeling my family will come through this chaotic transition all shiny and new! ❤",Sarah Olson,2019-09-30T18:02:42Z,3

"I really liked this flow! It resonated with me and I feel like I can do it anywhere and anytime I need a little pick-me-up. It brought some heat and it was great to be able to hear my heart beat. Nothing hectic, just a reminder that I&#39;m alive and have purpose. During a meditation course once, the instructor asked us to share what makes us feel most alive. And naturally, I said working out. It&#39;s quite obvious right? During my day-to-day life I often forget to breathe. For real. And my heartbeat often becomes irregular due to anxiety and such. During a workout I can feel my heart and breath saying: Hey! Thanks for bringing us back into alignment. And for that I would like to say thank you to you, Adriene. Thank YOU for sharing YOUR time with me/us. Namaste x",Liandra Kirchner,2019-09-30T00:26:18Z,0

This year has been hard for me health wise and I&#39;ve been having a failure mindset. I discovered that this mindset was even affecting me in my exercise as I stopped doing the harder yoga videos with the thought that I couldn&#39;t do it. Today I did all of the downward dog/low lunge positions and I nearly cried. My word for my intention was &quot;finish&quot; and I did just that with this video.

"Happy Birthday sweet Adriene! I hope you&#39;ve been having a fabulous day. I was a bit worried cos I couldn&#39;t find your love letter today, for some weird reason it had gone into the spam box!.  You never spam me, no you lift me up and inspire me to be a better version of myself, without you my yoga would be without meaning or purpose, just an imitation of the poses, without my heart and soul in them.  May the blessings of the universe flood your life with abundance, happiness and peace,  you are simply awesome and deserve the very best.  Much love xxx",V Brew,2019-09-29T18:49:14Z,0

Checking where my body is each day , strengthening it , honoring it and loving it, were some of the things I really missed. I also realized how great Adriene&#39;s work is. I mean, these free practices, these spotify playlists, these Sunday letters and all of the advice she sneaks into each video shouldn&#39;t be taken for granted. Adriene, your generosity, kindness and love are truly inspiring! I can&#39;t imagine where I&#39;d be if it weren&#39;t for you. Thank you so much.",Angel S,2019-09-29T17:34:06Z,0

There have been a lot of drastic changes in my life during September, and this whole playlist has helped me out with the stress, confusion, and self-doubt I&#39;ve had. During this month I&#39;ve had to be patient with my anxieties and I&#39;ve grown. While acknowledging that I&#39;m naturally anxious, I know I can hold that as I move forward being more present.

Hello my fellow Libra. Is it normal to be short of breath or to have trouble breathing during the childs pose used in this video?,Nathaniel L.,2019-09-29T09:32:29Z,0
"I had my last day at my old job yesterday, finished at 3am, and come home completely exhausted after working 22 of the last 34 hours. This was a job that affected me very negatively both physically and metal. I got burned out and depressed, and stopped doing things I love like yoga and reading books. At the same time, I&#39;ve never drunk so much wine on weekdays before ... Not a place I want to be. So today I woke up to an email from Adriene &quot;Today, In Fact, Could Be A Turning Point&quot;. I did yoga for the first time in over half a year, and tears ran when Adriene spoke at the start of this video. I have now got a job that is about something I love, on a career path I want to be on, with morals I can put behind a hundred percent. The future looks bright again.<br /><br />Just wanted to say thank you Adriene for always being there with wise words when we are ready to get back to the yoga mat. 🧘‍♀️<br /><br />A new beginning - back to me ✨",Strix Aluco Books,2019-09-29T09:30:08Z,599

"right, like I want to spice up my life and try other channels, you know, to open up and hear other viewpoints, but it&#39;s rarely ever as good as her practices, and if it is, it&#39;s a golden nugget on the channel, not consistent",Sarah Leeann,2021-01-20T19:33:11Z,2

@A Lochetto wtf! how dare you speak for others and say we have to keep negative things to ourselves. we do not. all of us are allowed to say anything we want to.,Robopecha,2020-03-13T02:47:25Z,1
"@A Lochetto How is a &quot;What???&quot; interpreted as potentially negative from your end? I can say you&#39;re bringing negativity here by conforming others to your path - &quot;we just keep it to ourselves&quot; is conforming. The body of &quot;we&quot; is made of individuals and all individuals should be free to freely express their individual thoughts, creativity and opinions. What you see as negative - I may see as positive. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23profreespeech"">#profreespeech</a>",Daniel Rothstein,2019-12-05T15:07:07Z,4

"What a treat! Two birthdays in one month; now that&#39;s what I call a true recharge from whatever emotional roller coaster that&#39;s going on around me these days. I know it&#39;s gonna be a good one when Benji is seen smiling at the beginning of the video. Well, I can&#39;t blame him; everyone involuntarily smiles on a bright Sunday that gets even brighter when Adriene uploads another lovely practice to add to the dish. Thanks for teaching how to embrace myself for what I am Adriene and giving me the opportunity to be born again into this world. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-09-29T05:17:03Z,4
