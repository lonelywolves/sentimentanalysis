"Hi my friends! Today&#39;s practice is a big request - something short, simple and easy to follow. Something that you can wind down with. How do you feel after taking 12 minutes to relax your body?",Yoga With Adriene,2019-02-24T14:05:18Z,1554
"This was great! Such an amazing way to wind down. Thank you! Will follow you for more videos, Adriene",Benedicte Wærstad,2021-04-05T21:34:42Z,0
I want you to know that me and my son (teenager) have used this wind down video at least 50 times! We both have trouble sleeping but he has trouble slowing his mind down to fall asleep. This video and Benji leave him snoring most of the time! Thanks for all that you do!,Stacey Skidgell,2021-04-01T03:36:45Z,0

"Adriene, I want to thank you for the phrase &#39;if this isn&#39;t available to you&#39;. I will admit that at first I was a bit eyerolly at it, but I&#39;ve come to realise that this is due to my own judgement of my body and its value. Whilst I thought it was initially mildly patronising to be so avoiding the phrase &#39;if you can&#39;t do this&#39;, I&#39;m now really understanding how unnecessary it is to bring negativity by reminding myself I can&#39;t do something during yoga. It adds judgement to my body whilst I&#39;m trying to appreciate and relish it. So yes, some movements aren&#39;t available to me, and thank you for giving the words to acknowledge that without me describing it as a personal flaw. Those change of words represent a change of how I am viewing myself.",catlinboy,2021-03-27T22:39:32Z,1

"even though a lot of these movements, poses in these yoga teachings are hard or a struggle to me (slightly overweight, not nimble or stretchable), the foundation where adriene always sets where the earth/ground will support you as you push away from it, really helped me find strength and comfort even when my wrists, knees are straining. and for that i also really found shavasana really comforting for my depression because it feels so comforted to feel zero weight when the earth supports you, even though a lot will argue that shavasana is just lying down",cath,2020-11-03T14:51:43Z,0

It has been such a good stress relief. During this,  yoga is the only thing I think about, nothing else.

I wanted to thank you for these routines. I have PTSD and severe anxiety. I have spent years waking nearly every night with panic attacks. I have been doing your routines the last week and I am sleeping better less panic attacks. I feel so much better about myself and I lost 4 pound this week. Your voice is so calming and soothing that I can actually relax without panicking hearing a strange voice in my ear. I usually can&#39;t close my eyes with a voice in the room without feeling unsafe. Thank you so much you are a true angel and you have helped so many people with their mental health and physical wellbeing.,carla Shortall,2020-06-07T13:46:22Z,11

"@Shannon no no no, that’s not what I’m saying at all. I was just trying to offer her peace in Christ. I wasn’t gaslighting at all, I was just referring to my own situation. How was I manipulating? And since you’re a Christian, I would have assumed you would appreciate someone trying to spread the love of Christ, though I may have worded it imperfectly? And I put the disclaimer because I’ve been cussed out for “shoving religion” down people’s throats just by simply sharing an encouraging bible verses about love. Ah I’m crying and frustrated now, I really meant no harm. Are you a christian?",Matthew 17:20,2020-11-29T18:47:50Z,0
"@Matthew 17:20 it&#39;s quite problematic to say something like a spiritual practice &quot;didn’t immediately stop my anxiety cause I wasn’t fully trusting in him&quot; while telling a story to someone (especially someone who&#39;s struggling with anxiety), as it puts the blame on the person for having anxiety because &quot;they weren&#39;t trusting enough&quot; in God... As someone who was in ministry for years and witnessed the way so many Christians unknowingly or knowingly use spiritual manipulation to gaslight people into shaming themselves for having mental illness when in fact it is an illness and there is NOTHING that person did to deserve it, I highly recommend thinking a bit more before you post.

Not only from my experience, but billions of people out there who have experienced the unexplainable unworldly power, love, grace, comfort, joy and peace of God in our lives. I remember when I had my first panic attack, a soothing voice (mind you, I felt like I was going to die, almost hopeless, but I had God and called out to him) and he told me “be still and know that I am God” . It didn’t immediately stop my anxiety cause I wasn’t fully trusting in him, but it’s a powerful verse and sentiment that calms my anxiety like nothing else to this day. Prayer is real, prayer is powerful. It wouldn’t hurt to try :) but regardless of what you choose, I love you, God loves you, and I’ll be praying for you Allyson ❤️",Matthew 17:20,2020-11-02T03:21:37Z,1

I heard you mention the ego and monkey mind and that&#39;s actually my main reason for yoga: i have so much brain noise/chatter. Yoga is the only think that quiets it down.  Would you consider doing a longer video for brain chatter/ ego? Something slow and with deep breath work? Maybe yin yoga-ish?

"I have had a very stressful week, and another stressful week ahead, all i needed to relax was these 12 minutes of self care. Just remember, work hard and move towards your dreams, but never let your mind and body suffer, always take care of yourself and know when to stop and take breaks. If our minds work for 24h constantly we are not going to achieve anything but stress. You need to take breaks and refill your body with energy + sleep at least 8 hours a day (super important) &lt;3, these tips are really nothing fancy but it&#39;s good to be reminded sometimes",Linda Leith,2019-11-28T20:21:50Z,0

"Adriene, I just returned from a five day meditation workshop at Omega Institute with training with Jon Kabat-Zinn. It was not a totally silent meditation and when some of us were talking about our yoga practices your name came up often. There were so many Adriene &amp; Benjii fans in this group of 200 people from all over the world. Many of us laughed that we felt obligated to join your affordably priced yoga “What Feels Good” group because we had been receiving the benefits of your training for so long. You have a large following and lots of groupies of all ages. Know we appreciate you and all you have given us and we hope to continue to support you in the future.",Brenda Desjardins,2019-10-01T02:48:54Z,1

"Hugging my knees up to my chest has never been accessible to me, I have big boobs and short legs, it&#39;s just hard. I&#39;ve always just held on for dear life hoping one day it might just work. Today instead I asked myself &quot;what good is this doing for me?&quot; and instead I stopped the struggle and gave myself a big hug across the chest because really that&#39;s all we&#39;re trying to do. Give ourselves a hug. What good does struggling do me? None at all. Thank you Adriene for always reminding me why we do yoga. Not to get into a shape, but to feel good 💕",Alexsheena,2019-09-28T20:36:55Z,709
"Same! Sometimes I&#39;ll use a strap under my knees. When I was taking in-person classes, we did a thing once as if we were going to do legs up the wall, and then brought knees to chest with the soles of our feet on the wall, which made me realize how much I had been struggling with the posture and how shameful that struggle felt. I think you&#39;re right to just ask, what is the purpose of this pose (sometimes for me it&#39;s a low back release), and how else can I achieve that purpose?",Karen Wolf,2020-10-23T13:04:55Z,8

I’m 14 btw and only know one 40 year old woman who does yoga occasionally. I tried yoga with her once and decided that it was beneficial to my health and that I should make it a habit of it.

"I decided to start today doing yoga (well, actually last night, this is the third routine I follow -night, morning, night-) and I just feel so good after each session, so I wanted to thank you for making such calm and relaxing videos. <br /><br />Also, I saw on another video someone that looked at how many views the video had before starting, and how many it had after finishing... And I also want to take the time to wish goodnight to the 200 people doing it at the same time, even if you won&#39;t see it.",Saakuchin,2019-03-21T00:23:53Z,4

"Hi Adriene, thank you so much for your wonderful vids, you make yoga so much fun! Unfortunately I injured my hamstrings (they call it &#39;yoga but&#39;)  and thinking it was muscle pain, I kept stretching it and only made it worse. I don&#39;t want to give up yoga, could you make a vid about modified postures and self care for this injury? It would be so helpful for a lot of people since it&#39;s such a common yogi injury.",Linda Anne Heemskerk,2019-02-26T05:58:55Z,0
"I kind of fell off of my yoga game and have been having the WORST time trying to fall asleep at night.

I have a lot of fat in the way that prevents me from being able to do a lot of the stretching. Is it good that I attempt to do it best as I can or should I try something else? I find that I’m feeling so restricted by my size.,Annie Waters,2019-02-26T04:36:23Z,0
