"What, if anything, is resonating with you as we get on the mat for Day 29?<br />Do you feel more united with your conscious breath?<br />Do you believe that this is a useful tool for your own growth?<br />Take time to really notice how you feel about showing up for yourself in this way.",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-30T15:13:17Z,530

"Thank you so much, Adriene. I had Covid-19 for 10 days which was in direct conflict with my 30 Day Yoga Journey. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t feel well enough to do yoga practice during that time. I am very proud of myself for picking up where I left off and continuing the journey.  I am incredibly happy and excited I did this.

"I really want to share with you guys my experience with this practice! I was able to do the standing splits I think it&#39;s their name, without hands for a little while!! I absolutely understand yoga is about finding what feels good wherever you are right now and I love that and I&#39;m learning to embrace that. But when we got to the child&#39;s pose I was so happy! So filled with energy because I was able to lift my whole body with only one leg!! (I can do that standing but you know what I mean) I felt so powerful! So grateful for my own body!!

I&#39;ve unlocked my balance, the feeling of exquisite stillness, I found meaning in some mantras and even took a liking to a new one (how you move matters). I&#39;m proud of myself for showing up despite being very tired from work. And I couldn&#39;t be more grateful for this channel and Adriene&#39;s beautiful personality, the best yoga teacher in the world. ❤️<br />Can&#39;t wait for tomorrow&#39;s practice.

"Adriene, I struggled a lot with today because of how much talking there was.  I know it was valuable wisdom but it was activating so much of my intellectual processing and analyzing that I couldn&#39;t get in the zone and be one with the practice.",Aixa Kay - عائشة كاي,2021-01-31T19:56:48Z,0
I am happy I joined the 30 day journey! I made the commitment so I can get back into yoga for being away from it for awhile due to depression and anxiety. Some days were a struggle just to get on the mat and some days i missed altogether. If I missed a day i would combine them the following day. I am happy I did this because it&#39;s getting me out of the darkness and into the light. Thank you Adrienne &amp; Benji! :),Julie Barancho,2021-01-31T19:46:03Z,1

"Yesterday, i missed a day. I&#39;ve beaten myself up about it. After 28 days i failed, i let myself down. But now i realised - it is not about having that perfect 30 day streak, its not about &quot;completing the challenge&quot;, its about showing up for youself, again and again. So to anyone, who missed a couple of days, I got you, we got you, but most importantly.. you got yourself &lt;3",xilvsionx,2021-01-31T19:22:21Z,3

Ok. So now I know I&#39;m actually done with this (after tomorrow). A couple of days ago I was super surpriced that it was day 26 when it felt like day 18. Yeasterday I was on fire and felt so good. Today I felt like shit and couldn&#39;t do anything.<br /><br />Daily Practice just isn&#39;t for me. I&#39;m so proud of myself for sticking to it and only skiping a couple of days so that I&#39;m only one day behind the rest of you. But no. Im not going to keep doing daily Practice. It&#39;s too much for me. I aim for 3 times a week now one.,Riina Pursiainen,2021-01-31T17:47:30Z,0

"Thank you so much for this gift of breath. I have practiced yoga over many years, some times regularly, but never  every day for 30 days. In my practice, I have not been able to focus on my breath during the movements. With this series, I was able to do a much better job of breathing. And, the payoff during non yoga as been beneficial as well. I even believe my breathing while asleep has improved. I thank you for your loving kindness and look forward to continuing this journey. The last session without your voice cues was harder, as I found myself continually checking the video which disconnected me from my breath, but I realize I just need to trust myself more in the flow. I look forward to playing this video again to improve my trust.",Marty Gerkey,2021-01-31T16:42:22Z,0

"After savasana, I had to rewind to the beginning and write down this quote.  It really captures what I have learned in the past 30 days:  &quot;it&#39;s not about believing in the benefits of yoga . . . this is an opportunity for you to recognize how time with conscious breath, contemplation, and mindful movement can lead us toward genuinely believing in oneself, trusting yourself, trusting the quality of the relationship that you continue to cultivate with yourself as you change and transform and shed and grow.&quot;",Deborah Collins,2021-01-31T14:13:44Z,0

"Adriene, there are times in your life when you just feel like something is missing. Yoga was my missing link that has over-time brought me closer to my center and to myself. Your yoga lessons of self-love resonates. I started practicing yoga back in September, after coming home from a trip. I noticed the weight I had gained and in my eyes I could tell there was a lack of self confidence and unhappiness. I was disconnected with myself. I thought why not, I have this yoga mat from high school that I haven&#39;t touched in 9 years. I decided to dedicate myself to yoga every single day to see what happens. Now, I feel like I am incomplete without doing yoga every day. Even if it&#39;s just 15 minutes, the breathing alone is beneficial. You&#39;ve made me laugh and have kept my spirits up with your wisdom and warmth you bring. Thank you for helping me find my confidence and self-love. Sidenote: I&#39;ve lost 26 pounds since I started too so I feel much healthier and it even has changed the way I think and my perception in a positive way. I truly do believe in the benefits from practicing yoga. Thank you so much Adriene and Benji! 💙💙 I hope I can meet you one day and tell you in person how much you&#39;ve saved my life. Thank you for being you and having fun with it, you had me cracking up during some of these days on this BREATH journey. I can&#39;t remember what day it was but you were doing a good ol&#39; Texas song and dance and I loved it lol 🙏 Thank you so much 💙",Kaci Sulzberger,2021-01-31T09:27:39Z,3

"One of the many things I love about yoga is that it gives me a graceful posture and tells other people I hold my head up high (even though I don’t always feel this inside) and it helps me trick my mind into thinking I am this confident person with high self esteem. I do get sad when it comes to the end of 30 days of yoga but when you follow the calendar and you do the individual practices for certain needs then the sadness doesn’t last long. It’s sad that doing these practices with everyone at the same time will end, for the time being, but every single day can be a yoga with adriene day, thank goodness! 💛",Wonder Woman,2021-01-31T04:07:36Z,0

But then I thought to myself, It’s DAY 29! What if being gentle with yourself today means showing up and seeing what happens? So, 11:00 pm, that’s what I did, and I’m glad. Thanks for this reminder to champion ourselves, not to prove something by coming to the mat, but to honor something. 💕",Amy Dunning,2021-01-31T03:56:51Z,1
"I can truly say that I hear myself doing ocean breath throughout the day. It is a soothing sound and definitely connects me to my breath. I don&#39;t think that I was conscious of my breath before this 30 day practice, so thank you Adriene for this gift and the gift of practicing daily with you and this lovely community. This is my first 30 continual day practice that I have succeeded in. I am proud and grateful!",Cheryl Carlson,2021-01-31T03:51:10Z,0
"Aaaah I am so shocked by how much more length and ease I feel in my hamstrings, especially, as we end this journey. I had been in a little bit of mourning over how un-limber my body felt since quarantine (I am a dancer and haven&#39;t been able to be in a studio since March!) but I didn&#39;t realize how much daily yoga practice would truly help - physically and emotionally. I was falling off balance a lot during the standing split on the second side, and I felt so un-phased and forgiving of myself, which is also so different for me. So glad I&#39;ve had this the past 29 (almost 30) days &lt;3 Thanks Adriene.",Lucy Austin,2021-01-31T03:41:24Z,0

"I AM getting stronger, physically and mentally! And I learned an important lesson. See, I had a slight sprain in my ankle on Sunday, so I chose to &quot;take a break&quot; until yesterday. I didn&#39;t even look at the daily practices. When I did, I realized that I quit before I even started. I could&#39;ve done most of the poses each day and modified the ones that might make my ankle hurt. I did catch up with the practices but I cheated myself out of the daily experience of being with myself. Lesson learned with a Loving Heart!!! 💖",Steve Smothers,2021-01-31T03:27:59Z,1
"Wonderful practice, that was my first time doing standing splits, which was a fun challenge. This journey has been AMAZING! I&#39;m so grateful to you and the entire Yoga With Adriene community! Thank you for giving me tools to be so much happier and more loving and accepting of myself! I was half breathing and thus I was only half living till I started this wonderful journey!

"Wow. Today was a big one for me. I was a bit behind so I did Day 28&#39;s practice immediately before this one. It was good timing, because I was having a rough day (was rather irritated), and needed something to help me constructively work through it. Within the first ten minutes of this one I was bawling. I had been having thoughts of having some comfort food after this practice (it is dinner time), right before the tears came. Just like for so many of us, the last year was rough. I put on some extra pounds because I was emotionally eating so much. I&#39;ve been trying to get back into shape and eat better, but it&#39;s been hard to shed the weight though I feel healthier. It&#39;s tricky to walk the line of being motivated to keep going, and not be hard on yourself. I realized as I was crying, that I was letting out some of that emotion that I had been stuffing down with food this year. I was grateful to have the space to let it flow. It was a good incentive that I may need to do an hour of yoga next time I&#39;m in an emotional eating mood.<br /><br />Eventually it passed, and then as we were touching our opposite shoulder while in plank, I was amazed at how strong I was! Steady I tell ya! Never would have imagined that at the beginning. We&#39;ve come a long way this month (and year), and I&#39;m not going to stop now. <br /><br />Lots of love to all of you out there who have been practicing!",Sarah,2021-01-31T02:21:35Z,1

"So I had a very cool experience with this practice. I suffer from a bit of asthma and when we first started the breathing on our backs, with our hands to our belly and hearts, I struggled with the deep breathing.  This happens particularly when breathing out sometimes when lying on my back and I couldn&#39;t take a deep breath without coughing or wanting to cough.   So in the end, after this practice of working the body, and coming into the same pose we started with, lying on our backs with hands to belly and heart, I noticed after several breaths how clear my breathing was, how absolutely clear and taking beautiful deep breaths. It was like, &quot;Hey, wait a minute....&quot; I Believe I can Breathe.xoxo",Brynn Matthews,2021-01-31T02:02:30Z,1
I have done few of Adriene’s 30 day journeys. And each time I come away with something precious. This time I realized that I have been viewing yoga as only a way to make my body more fit (which it does) but totally missing the deeper benefits. This time I had flashes of connection to myself. It was so different than my usual ‘exercise’ routine where I focus on the goal and zone out. So grateful for each of you on this journey with me... and of course Adriene and Benji !❤️,Bonnie Sydora,2021-01-31T01:59:12Z,0

"Yesterday I managed 1 second on the crow pose for the first time. I was so surprised by it that I let out a yelp-like sound before falling over sideways, I was still focusing on getting my feet on the ground for downwaard facing dog, it didn&#39;t even occur to me that I would improve so much in crow.<br /><br />Today I noticed after practice that I have some muscle definition in my shoulders, chest and biceps. I had to stare, because I&#39;ve always been chubby and am not used to being able to see my muscles.  I was confused though. My muscle grew so much! but when I tried to lift some heavy stuff the other day,  it seemed more difficult than usual. Then I realised: The muscles that grew the most art the ones that help me &#39;push&#39;.  Like pushing off the ground into plank and pushing to get into crow. <br /><br />When I showed off my new muscle to my boyrfriend he joked about me carrying him accross the doorstep, but I guess I&#39;ll have to push him insteas.",vivchibilove,2021-01-31T00:42:52Z,0

I&#39;m disabled and I&#39;ve wondered whether my struggles to do certain things, having caused frustrations, may have further affected my ability to trust myself.

I found her yoga channel sometime in April during our first lockdown. It helped with stress management. I went through several of 30 days YWA. Some days I did twice in a row. One I didn’t finish. Sometimes I found a video that fit the time I had to practice. This was my first real time 30 days. I loved it. I will admit I am not a fan of the silence of day 30.

It may have taken 29 days to finally get a glimpse of internal self-love but I did it! I am so confident that each and every one of you will also find what you are looking for inside. When you least expect it, it will come. Stay open, work to be present, and everything you need will appear.

New to yoga. Haven&#39;t watched your latest videos yet so I can only speak to the earlier ones for beginner but I like how you keep it light and real with some normalcy (at least that&#39;s how I see it) and not just the serious low whisper &quot;creepy&quot; voice that most other yoga channels have. Works better for folks like me who want the benefits but do not want to feel like they&#39;re in the mountains living with monks. Best of both worlds.

"I am so excited to have been on this journey with you. This is my first 30 day challenge and I am beyond excited, proud, filled with joy to have come this far. I remember back to day 3 when I was so sore, I thought, &quot;how am I going to do this?&quot; But I just showed up, and that day stretched every sore muscle I had, and I felt so much better having showed up. From that moment on, I just trusted you and kept showing up, and you delivered. My body is so much more mobile, I have more balance, and even just walking feels better after this challenge. I have already set another goal of another 30 days, and honestly am thinking I want to do this every day for the rest of my life. I am trying to convince my 65 yr old dad to start, he&#39;s not going for it so far, but everything else I have suggested to him he does, it just takes a year or 2, so my guess is, he will be here next January :) Thank you so much for this challenge, and your obvious attention to detail.",Kari Kincaid,2021-01-30T20:12:31Z,0

"Dear Adriene,<br /><br />I am leaving my mat in tears today.<br />In March/Apríl, I was doing Home with you. We were locked in quarantine in the Czech republic back then. I was practicing Home with my best friend, also doing some wim hof practices, walking up an old Celtic pagan hill in my neighbourhood. I was joking all the time that what I was doing felt like magic. That I have no idea where its going to take me. I have done Yoga before, I have been doing it since on and off as well, but that time felt different.<br />Well, the next month after Home, they called me from the social services. They had a baby boy for me to adopt. To take home.<br /><br />Fast forward, here I am, with him at home already for so many months, finalising my court application to have it all done. I had to do so much paperwork, not to freak out so much. I felt like I was going to go crazy.<br />I needed so much breath. You gave me all of it.<br />The application is sent, accepted, the only thing I am waiting for is the final court date. <br />Maybe some small changed will happen too, but I am a peaceful warrior.<br /><br />You have the biggest Namaste from me.

"Something wonderful and inexplicable happened today. As I followed Adriene&#39;s voice, I found myself, somewhere between the second and the third downward dog, moving as a fluid let free to behave like itself. It&#39;s difficult to describe, but for something like 50 seconds my body was dancing through the movements, as if it knew where to go before being told and as if it was doing exactly what it was born for. It felt like freedom, like going home. I&#39;m so happy I arrived to Day 29 or I would have not experienced this magical moment. Thanks Adriene.",GiudittaVonKleist,2021-01-30T19:20:32Z,0

"During the second pyramid pose my legs gave out, both sides. So instead of feeling angry at my body for not holding the pose, I sat still and quiet and massaged my legs, then tried again for the other side. I think before this practice I would have had a lot of self-hate for not being able to hold the pose. But now I just accept that today isn&#39;t the day I hold that pose for very long.

I showed up for the 29th consecutive day, and though today didn&#39;t work out as I wish it would have, I still sat on that mat.

Just before the pandemic I joined a local yoga studio and they closed and it has been hard to keep on track.  Since beginning this practice I have not only accomplished showing up every day, in the past two weeks I have shown up at least twice a day for 3 days.

There&#39;s a restless energy of being cooped up at home and stillness is frustrating. I&#39;ve learned that what I need by way of meditation is more of a moving meditation during this intensely home bound time, and I know what to seek tomorrow.

We’re also both members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and we have found that yoga is such a great metaphor for our spiritual growth trying to follow Jesus Christ. This practice has made us better at living out our religion and being kind with ourselves and others while also challenging ourselves. It continues to be awesome to learn to care for others by caring the different parts of our bodies and minds.

"Although this month felt so lengthy, this 30-day journey flew by so fast and I can&#39;t believe tomorrow&#39;s the last day! I am truly going to miss this. This is my first time joining 30 days of yoga live but I am ready to begin following the monthly calendar this year. This is the beginning not the ending. I am so happy and proud of myself for making it even in the toughest days when I wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;ll make it on the mat but hey, I did! I am proud of us and thank you Adriene for taking us together along to always find what feels good and making this world a better place in these critical days. Let&#39;s just forget this pandemic and all of this and forget its there, lets think about the days where we won&#39;t be wearing masks,  the days we reunite with the people we&#39;re being away from to protect them. It &#39;s okay and this will be over. Connecting and supporting each other&#39;s backs is what we all need so maybe focus on that.. what do you say, are you in? - Sending virtual hugs to everyone! &lt;3",Sarah A,2021-01-30T14:57:20Z,2

"Imagine learning how to also be present even off the mat 😮 this practice made me realize that being present/presence, although somewhat individual and personal, doesn&#39;t mean existing in a vacuum of one&#39;s own awareness... it&#39;s also the courage to take up and share a space/s of existence outside one&#39;s own. So yeah, that awesome feeling of presence on the mat translated off the mat should be quite awesome as well. This I hope to further  reflect on and learn about and practice~ ❤❤❤",blessieva,2021-01-30T14:45:33Z,1

"Today&#39;s practice was bitter sweet. It&#39;s crazy how fast this journey has gone. During the part that Adriene said whisper to ourselves &quot;I am strong&quot; I actually had gone into child&#39;s pose for a moment and the thing is, I still felt strong. I whispered &quot;I am strong&quot; to myself a couple of times and got right back into the flow. I was strong enough to listen to my body, and strong enough to believe in myself to give a loving push to get back into it. I will also miss the sweet and encouraging comments. I do have hope that my new beginning will be full of these practices and skills even if my new journey is not related to yoga (though I will be continuing yoga).",Melanie H,2021-01-30T14:32:01Z,0

"I found Yoga with Adrianne several years ago and she is the one that has inspired me to really get into my daily practice. For years I WANTED to do yoga but at the time was too focused on the hardcore, fast pace, push your body to the limit and feel it for a week at a time type of movement. Honestly at the time I really didn&#39;t respect my body, I just wanted to acceive that perfect shape.<br /><br />But I finally came into yoga, and truely surrendered to it when I was going through some tough times in my life about 3-4 years ago and it honestly has brought me home to myself. Instead of seeing my body as something I have to fight with to get it to do what I want it to do, I see it as an outward reflection of what is going on inside myself. It is mearly a part of me (body/mind/spirit) and all areas have to be harmonious to bring you well being.<br /><br />For the last 2 years I have pretty well practiced yoga DAILY and I LOVE it! I truely crave it. Without having any expectations of how hard I have to work or how flexible i need to get or how many calories I need to burn. I just get on the mat and move and LISTEN! It is like therapy for me. <br /><br />So thank you for being the catalyst to me truely LOVING myself enough to just BE with myself every day Adrienne! It truly is a gift! 🥰🙏🤗🙏💖",Kaley Wilcox,2021-01-30T14:16:54Z,2

"One more day?! Before this journey we couldn&#39;t imagine ourselves committing to a week of yoga let alone a whole month! It now feels wrong to start the day without carving out a little time for ourselves in this practice, couldn&#39;t be more thankful! Feeling proud and excited for the final day, see you all tomorrow! x",Mo Pittaway,2021-01-30T13:21:39Z,1

"If this is your first 30-day experience, Adriene has a surprise for us tomorrow, a 30-day tradition you won&#39;t want to miss. I encourage you to show up, trust, and try. Give the thinking mind a break. You can do it even though you will think it is impossible. Me Year One: didn&#39;t even try. Me Year Two: maybe, just maybe. Me Year Three: I&#39;m flying! (and dang, I cheated myself on year one and two). ❤️ Love from NC USA",Tricia Moss,2021-01-30T13:18:19Z,0

"Day 29: Believe. ‘Having this relationship with yourself that you really can trust’. I still cannot believe that tomorrow is the last day. This journey has taught me so much. It’s helped me to grow as a person and build this beautiful connection with my breath. Even if we’re all on our individual journeys, it’s so amazing how a simple practice can connect so many of us together. The comments we share about ourselves, to the love we express to others, this community is so precious.

"I cannot believe I have been doing this for myself every single day, and I&#39;ve done it for years. With little children, Covid, health issues, last year has been tough. Some days I have tears while I&#39;m in a session. I was so lucky to be in a big crowded room with Adriene doing yoga in London back in the day. So many people in one room in unity, no masks, no fear. At the end of that session, I was lying down and I again had tears in my eyes. I so wish those days to come back. It&#39;s like a far away dream...",StandardCandle,2021-01-30T12:49:12Z,70

"I have been away from yoga for 3 years d/t foot injuries. I am so glad to be back!

"Adriene, I signed up because I started noticing about 2 years ago that I couldn&#39;t fill up my lungs in that comfortable way you can when you yawn. BREATH spoke to me. I have not missed a day -- and yes, my breath is so much better. The extra crazy benefits are the strength and kindnesses you offer. (I usually run and do HIIT stuff, but this month, I gave myself permission to suspend those activities to make sure I showed up here.) SO grateful to you. I&#39;ll be continuing with this practice.",Kelly Hennessey,2021-01-30T12:46:03Z,97

"I resonate with what you said. I have had an off and on relationship with yoga throughout the years and also gravitate towards HIIT and heavy cardio. This last month I have still incorporated HIIT, however my focus was on yoga and always came after my HIIT. If I missed a day of BREATHE, I’d double up the next day to catch up. If everyone practiced yoga, especially now, what an amazing place we’d all be in, both emotionally and physically. They definitely go hand in hand. ❤️",Eliserin,2021-02-01T01:45:58Z,3

Day 29 ❤️  today really pushed me but it was amazing because it showed me that I could finally keep up. I had been slowly getting there but today my body shook with strength and power and I smiled and felt myself buoy up and just believe in myself. It was extraordinary and I am so proud of myself and every body who has gone on this journey. 29 days of yoga and I have never felt more in tune with myself and my body is so happy it makes ME happy.

"I started todays practice so distracted and thinking &quot;im not present, I keep thinking about horrible things and I&#39;m not going to be able to do this.&quot; Then I just allowed myself to follow Adriene&#39;s voice, however it was I got there, and before I knew it I was connecting my breath to my movement and was fully engrossed in the flow. Magic! ✨ Thank you Adriene! Xx<br />How bittersweet to think that this 30 day journey is coming to an end...but I do love your sentiment that with every end is a new beginning. I am so happy that I have showed up every day to experience this and I am glad that I now know I have the time, strength and motivation to continue with a regular yoga practice 🤍",Samantha Holder,2021-01-30T11:57:30Z,6
"I need to share my today&#39;s experience because it really changed the way I went through the practice. My eyesight is really bad and every practice I would do with my glasses on, which sometimes could get very frustrating (glasses dangling on my nose, falling down). I never considered taking them off because I always wanted to see the video clearly, be able to recreate every move as much as I could. Yesterday for the first time I decided to take my glasses off for the entire practice and see what happens. It was a bit weird but also so much easier! Today I entered the practice without my glasses consciously and decided to fully focus on the voice. I left my perfectionism behind and for the first time during the challenge I listened to my body without any distractions. And like the practice told me to believe, I finally did so. Thank you, Adriene, for your guidance. I&#39;m fully ready for tomorrow :)",Naskiel Shepard,2021-01-30T11:57:07Z,882
"I have been practicing for almost a decade, and today was the first time I had enough self trust to do an entire guided practice without my glasses.

"@heedmydemands I also wear glasses, and since am near sited, I need my glasses since I want to be sure my positions are correct. I have an old pair that has smaller frame and that works better for me, my regular pair did however get in the way like the first person &amp; along with what others said. For me if I don&#39;t have my glasses on and I try to for us on something I get a headache.  Great job Adriene blessings to you &amp; everyone!",Pat Bone,2021-04-13T13:50:20Z,0

So I keep coming back because it BLESSES me.  Thanks Adriene and the team.  You are AWESOME and help us all be AWESOME.  Did this practice inside by the light of a fullish moon.  A morning light for this 29th day of WONDERFULNESS.,Ann Jenkins,2021-01-30T10:54:00Z,2

This was day 99 for me of yoga with Adriene after being convinced about Yoga reading the book The Surrender Experiment. Thank you for this wonderful teaching Adriene. I&#39;m hooked and I&#39;ll be doing it until I die. I was recommended by my 75 yr old Mum who has been doing it herself and you&#39;ve been helping so many during these strange times.  Best wishes to you and all on this journey! Namaste ;),Andy Wade,2021-01-30T10:50:26Z,29

"What a wonderful month. I&#39;m very much looking forward to continuing with yoga, hopefully every day.<br />I do have a request for a bit of advice from the more experienced out there. My wrists really hurt during practice. I really try to push my weight into my fingers when in downward dog but sometimes it hurts so much that I have to drop my knees. Are there any exercises or yoga moves I can concentrate on to build my strength?<br />I also really struggle with upper arm strength. I used to go to the gym regularly (when we could) and have progressed quite well with deadlifts, but I still can&#39;t even bench press the bar without any weight added. I can&#39;t do a push up either. I&#39;m quite a big girl (around 95kg) so it&#39;s a lot of weight to hold. Any exercises or moves I can concentrate on to increase my arm strength? Maybe more lowering down from plank, or the shoulder taps we did today?",The Teeps,2021-01-30T09:53:58Z,0

I was in that balancing pose on my left leg, and when Adriene said step the right foot back, I forgot it was still in the air. 😆 Easy landing though.<br /><br />Puppy posture was anothet MATter. Perhaps someone has a good suggestion for a mat brand. Not sure what I can get easily here but puppy posture always reminds me I have cheap mats that need to be tossed. My nose just cannot bear them. So any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 🙏<br /><br />I am glad whatever funk possessed me yesterday and this morning lifted somewhat before I got on the mat. Personal funk, not the mat funk! Feel pretty good now.<br /><br />Enjoy this practice! One day left, but then everyone can meet each other either on a 30 day program or the month calendar.

"Feeling very similar Sophie! Today when she asked us to notice how we felt about being here at Day 29, one of the strongest feelings I had was one of surprise. Every year I start a Yoga with Adriene 30 day journey, and every year I finish it in about 3 months or more, but never live as the videos are released, never a truly daily practice. This year is so different! And I&#39;m very proud. Everyone who is here at Day 29 on this journey has given themselves so many reasons to &quot;believe&quot;! &lt;3",CaraK003,2021-01-30T13:52:41Z,1

You&#39;ve shown me that I&#39;m more than others can think of me, and that I can rise above any obstacle that comes my way! Thankyou for teaching me to appreciate every little things in life! Thankyou for helping me walk through life with grace and passion on difficult and bright days! You&#39;re simply the healer of my anxiety! Also, I&#39;m proud of everyone who continues to do yoga, no matter what, you&#39;re all great people! Never give up! Keep up the good work and well done!

Exactly what I think too. I absolutely agree. Thank you Adriene so much and this lovely community. I will miss reading the comments but I will carry on finding Adriene’s yoga sessions. It took me almost two months to complete this one month of sessions. But I’m still proud of that and I am stronger in so many ways. I hope you all continue with Adriene’s yoga. I’ve never stuck to regular sessions of yoga before. This has been marvellous and amazing. I’ve learnt so much and got into a daily routine now.
