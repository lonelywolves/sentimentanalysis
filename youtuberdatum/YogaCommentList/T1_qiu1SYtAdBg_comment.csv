This has just done me the world of good.  A day working from home at the dining table and my back was done in.  Thanks Adrienne.  I started with you one year ago and I think we’re mates for life!,Lynn Manning,2021-03-16T17:57:11Z,0
"This just didn&#39;t vibe with me. I left the mat feeling worse than before I started the practice. I felt frustrated and defeated by things I&#39;ve done plenty of times before in YWA practices. Basically sobbing right now, and I have no clue why this video brought that on. Couldn&#39;t find that unconditional self love she talked about today.",Leslie,2021-03-14T22:50:13Z,0
"These monthly playlists are such an awesome way to rediscover your past videos and experience new things no matter how long ago these videos are made, just shows how revelatory truth is. Thanks Adriene and YWA Team.",Lawrence Seiji Abbott,2021-03-08T18:31:34Z,0

my upper body got so much stronger than it was before. I did the second part of the practice without struggling. &quot;one step at a time&quot; approach really worked. Thinking to apply this approach more frequently on others matters. Should help considering my impatient nature :) Thanks Adriene :),Saikal Isakova,2021-03-03T17:08:19Z,0
i am feeling so much better now! thanks adriene :),raquel lohmann,2021-03-01T23:50:54Z,1
"It was full of heated moments. I couldn&#39;t resist but to rest at the end of the long low right leg lunge move and for the left side my left knee was on the ground. I think the reason was my hands being lifted over the head during the pose which made it very tiring for me. Also, I was already a bit tired before the yoga. <br />But honestly, I liked how this session was choreographed. The movements were inviting one to continue.",Pooya Valinataj,2021-03-01T11:04:43Z,0

"You know, I remember when Adriene dropped this practice last year, when February was KISS. I remember that because it was after the amazing HOME journey. I enjoy thinking about where I was last February, to where I am now. I am stronger, in the mind and body, and I&#39;m more peaceful, which was my goal all along. Now I come to you with 57 days in row of yoga. I do not state this as a challenge or bragging, but in pride of my growth. Thank you so much Adriene for being my guide. I wish you all the very best! Namaste 🙏",TMNTsamurai 84,2021-02-28T03:24:03Z,1

"Today was super rough for me, I started a new medication on thursday and the side effects come and go. I’ve done this practice before without too much trouble, but now i find myself struggling a lot. Trying however to be kind to myself (even if it’s hard sometimes), and not be mean to myself and my body when it has a perfectly valid reason for not being perfect today. I love this community though. I’ll take a quick breather, see if I can continue. Otherwise, I’ll spent the rest of the evening just being kind to myself",maddesonsquaregarden,2021-02-27T20:20:15Z,2

Few months on and I still appreciate that this is a challenging practice, but I enjoyed it SO much more this time. I really have developed a lot on the poses since the last time I did this, high lunge especially, and my vinyasa flow and it genuinely just makes this whole process so much more relaxing and enjoyable, I can feel the love with this practice now.

Then down to the ground for a little core work. My low boats definitely weren’t very low Adriene but you said modify so I did.

"@Gill Smith I totally feel  the DD vibes right now! Thank you Gill! <br /><br />I didn’t end up doing the 40 min., however, I’m not shaming myself for it which is a miracle! Moving on! <br /><br />I print out the calendar too! I even have a “key” that tells me what happened that day depending on the color of the heart I color my in (I use hearts instead of crossing out so I give myself love even if I have a black heart) but I helps me track pain. <br /><br />I’m excited for the new calendar! Those vibes must have been very strong bc I don’t normally do “excited” 😂.",Laura Reed,2021-02-28T11:28:17Z,1
"I totally understand Laura. I still think 40 minutes was rather long for me but by breathing slowly and missing out the bits that spoiled my fun, I’m always mindful and so today I’m not paying the price for yesterday 😊 our last day of Bridge is 20 mins. I’m ready to go, then later I’m downloading MOVE for March. I’ll print off the calendar so I can cross them off. Today I’m sending you extra demon defying vibes 😂🤞 take care 🧘🏼‍♀️💕",Gill Smith,2021-02-28T08:29:12Z,1
Ok Gill. I didn’t do it this morning and didn’t even check to see if you did bc my brain demons were having a fiesta. <br />👿 🪅 <br /><br />I’m going to just try it with the modifications you prepped me for.

"Having a good day YWA friends?<br /><br />Breath and Bridge family? How does today&#39;s practice find you?<br /><br />I have to admit there was quite a bit of irritation today. Thoughts flying. Too much talking. Let&#39;s move along. What, doing that again?! And having a headache did not help. I have done this before and loved it so it is no reflection on Adriene. Definitely not. Perhaps it was similar to the feelings that come up sometimes when the weekend ends and the work week starts, only here we had done so many short practices leading up to this longer one. I really should add in some other videos like some of you do to even out the practice times. <br /><br />All that aside, I know you will enjoy this one. I did despite the difficulty. Can say that after lying on my mat for some minutes at the end. 🙏<br /><br />Bridge day 27. Day 146 in a row.",William B,2021-02-27T03:43:50Z,148

"Loooved this practice!! At the end in happy baby, I felt comfortable in that pose for the first time in forever; when Adriene said to find what feels good I tried rocking a bit, but fully got unbalanced and totally tipped to the side while staying locked in the position 😆 It made me laugh but I still kept the position, and tried to give myself some impulse to bounce back towards center. Probably not the chill slow energy I was expecting to put in / get from this pose, but it did make me smile 😂",Emeline,2021-02-14T14:47:08Z,0

"Today marks 6 months since I retired, and 6 months of almost daily yoga with Adriene.  Before retirement, I did 3 or practices a week.  During the first 4 months I also worked at losing 30 pounds.  I am successfully keeping the weight off, and my knees don&#39;t complain on stairs any more.  I have become a lot stronger.  I can even see a tiny bicep bulge (if I flex in just the right way).  I have begun trying to hop to the top of the mat when transitioning from down dog to forward fold.  And this week, I have begun to add back some low impact cardio.  <br />I truly believe that if I hadn&#39;t found Adriene 7 or so years ago, I would be in terrible physical condition, but thankfully, I feel that I am in better shape than many in my age group.<br />Thanks Adriene!",L C,2020-12-05T16:21:43Z,17

"DO IT! <br />Like Adriene says the hardest part is showing up and if you&#39;re seeing this comment you&#39;re already here, so just press play!<br /><br />I really debated doing this practice today (following the December 2020 calendar), the 40 minutes seemed long, the mention of core seemed daunting, was it a challenging one? I wasn&#39;t in the mood for a challenging practice...  <br />After a couple minutes of inner debate I just pressed play and let me tell you it can be challenging in parts but Adriene eases you into the practice with such kindness and care you don&#39;t even realize. The time flows by and as for the core section, never knew I would actually be willing to do core exercises when met with kindness and encouragement!

"Dear Adriene,<br />As a beginner, I felt anxious to follow quick flows which I used to have in yoga classes last year. I love yoga, but somehow I felt I had been progressing slowly. There was the point when I pushed myself with classes, and I ended up having a mild meniscus tear. It was a heartbreaking moment. After three months therapy, my therapist encouraged me to get back to gentle yoga. She said I was ready, but I did not dare to.<br />Quarantine let us stay more at home and become even less active. That time I knew my body and mind needed balance. I started yoga again after 8 months of giving up. I found this Yoga Kiss. As a yoga teacher, you did not sound to push or force us and that was what I told myself to just enjoy and go with the flow.<br />After two months regularly doing this yoga kiss, for the first time I could do two challenging poses successfully: chaturanga and full forward fold. I realize that the less pressure I give to myself, the better I feel with the flow.<br />I always have this one as my most favourite.<br />Thank you, Adriene, for your kindness to share the energy, the passion and the positive vibes. <br />Hugs,<br />Nita",Nita,2020-10-29T07:56:32Z,1

"I just tried this practice today after doing the 40 minute beginner&#39;s yoga for the past several weeks. This video is so good. It was hard, I&#39;m not going to lie, but I was able to do all the poses without the modifications thanks to the strength I built doing the beginners practice. I was always afraid of yoga for some unknown reason, but this lockdown finally gave me the motivation to do it. I&#39;m also learning to belly dance, which is so fun too. It&#39;s a nice balance to do the belly dancing followed by yoga.  I watched a lot of teachers on YouTube before deciding on you. I&#39;m pretty picky about personality and I didn&#39;t want anyone who was too woo woo. Your style is perfect. I like the way you explain everything in a meditative and non-threatening way. I love that you have Benji in your videos (I often have cat trying to lay on my mat below me when I&#39;m doing a plank or downward facing dog). Looking forward to trying other videos, although I&#39;m really happy this one for the moment. Thank you for this great service!",Ali Claire,2020-05-12T01:53:32Z,5

I just would like to share this thought with you.<br />I feel bad because after 30 amazing consecutive days of Yoga With Adriene, I couldn&#39;t work out today due to some health issues.

I really wanted to fulfill my intention for April and complete my first Yoga Calendar - plus today&#39;s video looked AMAZING :&#39;( !!!<br />Then I remembered that the topic of this month is &quot;Nurture&quot;, and I thought that maybe resting for a day is also a way to nurture and take care of myself? <b>ugh</b> ...still got a lot to learn lol",Aurora D'Amico,2020-04-25T20:45:32Z,4

"Is it because my arms aren&#39;t that strong that the (high) lunge is difficult for me in this session? I&#39;m doing it and holding on, but feel the work in my arms so bad! o_O I love this session, and I especially enjoy that the core work gets easier each time. I also love the session where you&#39;re in a park somewhere in your hometown, feeling the breeze and a drop of rain falling on your forehead xD.

Im hoping you can do this idea for a video to help with anxiety. <br /> I would like it if you could make a yoga video wearing jeans and a leather belt unbuckled in them, or yoga pants with belt loops. The belt buckle sounds as you move doing yoga poses and stomach movement will sound very relaxing like ASMR, it would be the most relaxing video ever! 😌 I have tried it myself and it helps relax me (the yoga plus the sound of the buckle), if you make a video I can add it to my playlist to watch and listen<br /> to when I can’t do yoga to relax.

"Guys, I really appreciate these videos, and they made me get into yoga, BUT why does Adrian have to speak so much? And why do some videos have 5 minutes in the same posture, basically doing nothing, but listening to Adrian talking about nothing? It`s probably a personal preference thing, but I have no patience to wait those sequences out, and then I get annoyed that I need to skip half of the video until something happens. Is there anyone else having this issue? I`d appreciate if there would be a selection of videos with instructions, but less talking. Any recommendations?",Imola Kiss,2020-02-25T06:33:14Z,0

"Yoga With Adriene This May sound like an odd request but I am hoping you can fulfill it. I would like it if you could make a yoga video wearing either jeans or yoga pants/jeggings with belt loops and a leather belt unbuckled in them. The belt buckle clanging sounds as you do yoga poses and stomach movement will sound very relaxing like asmr, plus watching and listening to your yoga would literally be the most relaxing video ever! 😌 I have tried it myself and was so relaxed, so if you make one video I can add it to my playlist to watch and listen to when I can’t do yoga to relax.",K P,2020-02-24T04:46:40Z,1

"Here&#39;s what yoga did for me today. I got some bad news that a landscaper was going to cut down a beautiful vine right outside the little place I rent that provides me with the only privacy I have. I started my practice, thinking it might be helpful but when the chainsaw started and my gut clenched, I thought - just go do some errands and come back to it later. But I WANTED to do my practice now. So when you offered a moment to establish an intention at the beginning I realized I just wanted to feel peace, rather than violation. Fast forward just 5 minutes and the rest of the practice I was peaceful, accepting, and so grateful.  Interestingly, they stopped using the chainsaw about 1/2 way through. This is what it&#39;s about for me. Finding a center that is so grounded and strong that what goes on around me doesn&#39;t throw me.",Lisa Buell,2020-02-22T18:14:36Z,0

Does anyone ever feel like sometimes with Yoga you can&#39;t get to that &#39;as is ness&#39; place? Or like its taking to long for your body to respond to the movement and you get sort of impatient or you feel like you can&#39;t gather your thoughts or movements? I feel frustration sometimes because I just want my stretch to be over or I want my body to drop into a position that I know will crack my spin or release my tension but I can&#39;t always get to the place were my body gets that tension escape.,Trish Edwards,2020-02-22T18:01:49Z,0

There are specific cautions, depending on how a person&#39;s surgery was done, but it would be so helpful to have guidance in this pursuit.  I am personally a little over 6 months out, and still have to be careful about passing 90-degree flexion, etc.  Restorative yoga is a good place to start, but with some guidance for these precautions.  The goal is strength, balance, stretch, mostly.  Thanks so much for all you do!",True Imdi,2020-02-14T18:41:10Z,0

Today, I put a blanket - folded longways like an empty burrito - on the floor behind me so that if I laid down i would rest on it from the mid-lower part of my back to in between my shoulders. It stopped my lower back from going all the way to the floor. That made pulling back up to modified boat available to me and allowed me to work that part of the practice.

"Thank you for the amazing videos and inspiration. If you ever get a chance to do a sequence on either halux toes (dancers’ feet) or how to approach back pains after broken tailbone, I’m all in! I have tried lots and lots of yoga over the years to make my back feel better (fell off a horse 3 years back), your back pain videos and psoas are great! But maybe you’ll think of something specifically targetted at the tailbone issues.. If so, big big thanks in advance! Many regards to you &amp; Benji!",dom_inique_8,2020-02-14T08:49:52Z,0

"Hey everyone! I just wanted to thank Adrienne and every “find what feels good” yogi. I started my yoga practice last summer and Adrienne’s was the first video I came across on YouTube. I made a commitment to myself, not just to lose weight but to find some worth in myself again. Since that day I haven’t stopped! I’ve lost 50 pounds! But I’ve gained so much good, my sleep is more restorative, my posture is straighter, I can keep up with my kids! I have decreased my symptoms of anxiety and depression. So thank you Adrienne, I feel like I know you through our little practices every day haha. I’ve never felt judged or like I have to be a perfect yogi to be part of this community and it feels really good! My weight is starting to plateau a bit so keep those hour long challenging videos coming! I’m ready for them!",Raphaelle Cambou,2020-02-12T15:10:06Z,38
How long did it take for you to start losing the weight? I did the 30 days and have been doing yoga almost every day for about 45 days. And I&#39;ve GAINED like 7 pounds. Idk why but I&#39;m hoping to start losing soon,Jessica Wilson,2021-04-17T00:35:49Z,0

"Adriene, <br /><br />I hurt myself. What do I do. <br /><br />I was doing your daily yoga practices, and slowly started to have lower back pain. I was doing a lot of forward fold outside of your practices because I felt good in that stretch. I also saw some Instagram posts I wanted to try and felt I could do it as I had an alright daily practice. <br /><br />It’s a move in forward fold where you touch your toes to your wrist, one at a time. <br /><br />I think that must have done it. The pain cam gradually. But now its been 3 weeks, I haven’t been able to practice. Sitting cross legged hurts and I’m really unsure if I need chiro or physio or who to go to. <br /><br />I can live my life normally when I take anti-inflammatory like Advil and Tylenol. But I’m taking and depending on them way too much. 4 times a day. And cant sleep through the night anymore.<br /><br />It’s silly that I hurt myself stretching. I was hoping you could do a video that touches base on the seriousness of at home practice and how it can hurt doing silly instagram photos online.<br /><br />My back is killing me and I’m scared to stretch.",Keven Sherwood,2020-02-09T16:54:36Z,0

"Hi! In general, most women are able to continue a regular practice through month eight if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. <br /><br />As always, consult your doctor/physician before starting and follow their advice. x",Yoga With Adriene,2020-02-10T17:51:16Z,0

I am so excited. At the beginning of January when I started the Home practice I couldn&#39;t lift myself back up from low boat. Today I did and not just once. Woohoo. So proud of myself. Taking it down to the left or right was one step too far today but I know that will come. I loved the Kiss routine today and it&#39;s so lovely to see so many people from the Home journey taking the next step here. Thank you Adriene. Have a great day everyone. Much love from the UK.

"So wonderful!  After missing Home for sure (and especially missing the Adrienne voice on the last da of Home) I just loved this.  I  missed a couple of days after Home ended because there was  no friendly email and yoga session- (of course I spent yesterday skiing all day so I told myself it was ok if I missed yoga).  but this is wonderful and I like the boat eventhough I can&#39;t go down that far..  It&#39;s just great to keep going w/ the daily yoga so thank you thank you thank you for putting this out.  I also have to say I have a  1 year old rez rescue pup and mostly when I did Home she went into another room, but today for Kiss she came up and was licking me all over- giving me her little dog kisses, how funny although pretty hilarious to laugh in boat pose or happy baby w/ a pup licking your toes!",j miller,2020-02-04T02:17:12Z,1

It&#39;s crazy how a practice but also your perspective can drastically change when you bring <del>lots of</del> love, calm, attention to your mind-body-soul, awareness, softness, and yes, big, deep breaths.

"i seem to be having trouble whenever i go into lowering boat pose because in the transition, the bone in the middle of the butt gets very exposed that it hurts to make that transition. It also makes it hard to go down “evenly”, meaning when lowering, I tilt to either side versus being able to go down on a leveled surface. if anyone understands what i’m saying and going through or if you have the same problem, how do you adjust or modify or possibly improve this “condition”? thank you",Sedona Blanar,2020-02-02T18:53:53Z,0

Between sweating and hot flashes on the mat, I was still able to plug away and keep  up, my version of course.  Before showing up for this session,  I did your FOUNDATIONS OF FLOW clip from 5 yrs ago, which I believe was beneficial to the extended body flow.  I can feel my body getting stronger.  I still somehow get caught in my breaths.  Time and practice is on my side.  I AM committed to this morning FLOW to start my day!   Thank you!  NAMASTEE!  Have an AWESOME SUNDAY FUNDAY...",Nora Marsh,2020-02-02T13:39:40Z,1
I only completed the first 20ish minutes of this practice before giving into my toddler whose running around like a true wild thing but I had to add how perfect this practice felt to me as I got started. My son was intertwined all around me as we began and I just kept giving him soft kisses which(with the theme of the month) just filled my heart up! I also chose to confidently go at my own pace - I usually shorten my breath to go with the flow of the videos and today I slowed it down and trailed behind and it felt so yummy! 🥰,Katrina Thomason,2020-02-02T13:27:44Z,2

"This was just what I needed on this cold and wet Sunday morning (in the UK). Perfect after 30 days of Home. I came back on my mat for Home, after suffering some wrist and elbow issues and wasn’t sure if I would be able to make it through, but with lots of modifications and determination I made it. Today I felt strong and actually managed to lower from plank to my belly with grace and ease, I admit to letting out a little whoop of celebration. I feel like I’m getting my body back.

"Hello to all! Here we go with day 2 on our February calendar. Today I woke up, felt I didn’t want to practice for 40 minutes (of course “there was a reason”, I was clearly late 😆😉), thought of choosing a shorter video instead, then got on the mat... And my body told me it wanted this one. And I did it, and it was amazing. For the first time in 4 months, I truly felt it was not an act of conscious discipline but rather a true gift to myself, kindness in and out, no pressure, like a gentle kiss. It made me get out of my head and feel alive, today. My dearest fellow yogis, I send you all the love from the Austrian Alps straight into your hearts. May you have a beautiful Sunday, enjoy this practice as a gift that it is, and know you are not alone in this. See you tomorrow on the mat 🥰",Anna Kravtsova,2020-02-02T09:33:53Z,83

Thank you so much for this beautiful practice so shortl after &quot;home&quot;. A wonderful way to start my Sunday. The little self-loving meditation in the beginning is absolutely charming. It&#39;s an inspiration for the meditations I am creating for my clients. May you be well and happy. 💖🙏,Angela from Austria,2020-02-02T09:13:24Z,1
Yay a 40 minute yoga on a Sunday morning is perfect! We are so grateful for the new videos Adriene!!,Senja Abbasi,2020-02-02T09:09:38Z,9
"Wow Adriene, this gentle slow KISS became a full body workout. I made it through. After our last week of HOME I found the strength for all those planks and downward dogs. My little hummingbird was trembling 😂 but it was fun and this senior yogi got my boats as low as possible. Adriene, this was extra challenging for Sunday morning ! But hey, don’t we feel good ! My intention is to have a relaxing rest of my day. See you tomorrow on the mat for some gentle yoga maybe ? 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏",Gill Smith,2020-02-02T09:07:25Z,2
"What a way to continue the journey since coming ‘home’ over the last 30 days. I’m feeling connected again, after loving this mornings practice. I love the way Adriene says ‘hop into something comfy’ as I’m standing there in my pyjamas. Anyone else yoga on getting up and remain in pj’s? Love to all 🙏🌎😘",Jules Thomas,2020-02-02T09:04:00Z,505
Yep and if I do an evening practice...well it’s pjs again. Then I really slip into something comfy at the end - my bed!,jill Bonniface,2020-08-09T21:51:02Z,0

This KISS was the perfect follow up for the 30 days of HOME. For low boat I will need 30 WEEKS of practice though. LOL at the beginning when Adriene went into different kinds of kisses 😊!,Inger Döll,2020-02-02T08:43:03Z,13

"My favourite bit of these yoga practices is when you ask us to look down in to a pond, in to water, and see our own reflection. It&#39;s the most beautiful image. Thank you Adriene. Namaste. X",Alison Harris,2020-02-02T08:23:30Z,128

"Me too❤️ when I was around 16 I used to take my dog on a “walk” every day to a tree park near my house that has the most magical little stream. My dog ended up getting fat because I would take her to the stream and just sit there for a couple hours, just taking it all in. All the bird songs and how the sunlight hit the plants, the sound the water made, and of course my daily joint. So I’m always taken precisely to those beautiful moments of my life &lt;3",Kylee Davis,2020-02-09T01:39:15Z,2
