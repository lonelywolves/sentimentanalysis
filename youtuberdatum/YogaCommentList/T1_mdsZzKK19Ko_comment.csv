"I woke up with sore hips today, complained abt it and still managed a 5k run... I didn&#39;t feel the comment, &#39;you&#39;ve got my back&#39; until I realised that today was all about hips. How uncanny. How exciting. How reassuring, that you/the mat, really does have our back-literally 🥰. Soo grateful🙏🏽",samantha Zabs,2021-03-23T01:28:31Z,0

"This one is absolutely fantastic for the hips, glutes, low back. Lots of clunks and crunches as I moved through the poses, but I could feel tension in those areas release significantly. I&#39;ve been trying to counter my sedentary job with some indoor biking on top of my daily yoga, and this really hit the spot to help all of those &quot;fired up&quot; muscles relax.

"Please can someone tell me what magical brand of yoga mat is being used in this video?  My CleverYoga Liquid Balance rubber mat bunches up beneath me something terrible in pigeon.  My Gaiam 6mm mat is way too slippery for downward dog, and my old Toplus cheapo basically fell apart after 2 weeks of regular use.  I just want a mat that I can depend on.",Laura Alderton,2020-11-06T21:41:54Z,0
"I love your videos and I only started doing yoga with you about a month ago. I’ve really enjoyed this 30 day journey so far. However I really don’t understand pigeon pose. I find it incredibly painful in my upper thighs and hips. As well as this I don’t understand how your upper thigh on the back leg touches the ground as well as the front folded leg. It just seems like an impossible position which worries me I’m doing it wrong and causing myself pain ? Or am I just really inflexible 😕 I have very short hamstrings so that might be why I struggle, I also can’t put my feet flat or keep my legs straight in downwards facing dog 😕",Phoebe Dolman,2020-10-30T09:55:18Z,1
"Hey Phoebe, I have very tight hamstrings and tight hips, so I sometimes struggle with this pose too... It can be uncomfortable but also feel like a deep stretch at the same time... If it hurts, I would suggest supporting your body by propping up your hip (of the folded leg) with a cushion or block in pigeon if it&#39;s not touching the ground... I hope it makes sense! All the best...",Emily Beauchamp,2020-11-22T16:16:24Z,0

I thought I would move my body, i have been doing the 30 day challenge but missed a couple days due to time constraints, but I thought I&#39;d do this one.

Luckily no disc or sciatic problem, just an incredible tightness of the muscles in the lower back that developed over the course of a day so that every bodily movement was scary for the pain. It eased over the next few days with rest, a hot water bottle and hard drugs but it was a wake up call for me as your back is the centre of your body of course, and I have never before felt so debilitated. <br />My main exercise is running and I haven’t been able to get back to that yet but I do feel stronger by trying to do some yoga every day. I’ve just finished day 22 in a month and half so, err, nearly every day. I’d like to thank you for putting up these structured practices for us to use for free. Especially in the time of Covid. It has been a godsend to me and I really appreciate how you deliver them with real kindness and thought for people like me who could barely touch their knees and started off with zero wrist strength. So thank you.",Rita Mistry,2020-08-28T09:20:31Z,0
"Day 22, so super proud of myself. Consistency is my word of the year and YWA is really helping live it. My hips moved in ways they have never been asked to move before, I had to release a little and sit cross legged, my knees had no interest in stacking lol🙈",Raquel B,2020-08-27T06:16:53Z,0
"It&#39;s impressive, at day 22, I am starting to see that my movement is becoming more graceful in all activities during this practice. I can&#39;t wait to see what the future holds. Thank you &lt;3",Eric Schnare,2020-08-26T19:52:09Z,0

One day I feel like I am strong and can do it, the next day I literally feel like a million pounds of bricks and I find myself unable to do pigeon and just crying on my mat. Why is it that we can feel so strong one time and so weak for the next 5 days? I am feeling so discouraged. I did Adriene&#39;s first 30 day challenge video series and felt so happy and excited each day but for some reason, HOME has been such a challenge for me. I feel anxious, frustrated, unmotivated, and like a failure. Not a good day today. Thank you for always trying to encourage us Adriene.

"Am I the only one that feels like I&#39;m doing the 3 toed pigeon wrong? Whendoing the position of laying with leg crossed in front, it feels incredibly awkward and my skin on my inner thighs is stretching to a point where it stings. When I mimic the movement, my entire hip and leg is almost off the ground but if I try to lay all the way down, I end up lowering my hip so much that my lengthened leg turns to the side.

"I’m a little behind with the Home series~ completed day 22 today. Adriene says, “If you start to feel a little tender hearted I’ve got your back. Stirring it up, yoga it’s powerful mind-body work.” Tears start to rise up inside of me as I feel a connection with the physical tightness in this pose and how tightly I’ve been holding onto emotional pain. Cried for the rest of the practice. This is truly more than a space for Yoga. Adriene~ thank you for empowering others with connection. 🙏🏼",Melody Sylvester,2020-06-18T02:26:45Z,1

If i just let my body be supported on the hip thats being bent, it feels like im kinda off balance and wrong, but when i center myself the hip doesnt touch the ground and i experience a much bigger stretch, yet that doesnt seem to be what youre doing since most of your legs are touching the ground during that pose. any help is appreciated, thanks!",Nathan Crowe,2020-06-11T10:00:45Z,0

"Have been doing the Home 30 Days of Yoga up untill now. I love it and would like to go on. However, since a couple of days I am finding it more and more difficult to perform some of the new positions. Especially those that involve flexibility in the hips or in the ankles. I always try to alter the positions to match my current capabilities when I don&#39;t manage to pull them off like they are &#39;supposed to&#39;. However for some positions I struggle to find an alternative, like Pigeon Pose. I am not able to rest my upper right leg on the yoga mat because I miss the flexibility and my right ankle hurts a lot, eventually closing off my bloodstream making my leg fall asleep. It is even worse when I switch sides. Any tips on what best to do in those situations. Or am I better off by first developing some more flexibility an then coming back to complete the series? Like I said, I love the series. It is the perfect way to start my day and it has convinced me yoga is the way to maybe even eliminate some of the problems I have run in to during my life, time and time again (like lower back pain and pain in my ankles). Anyway, thanks a lot for the videos. I will be coming back!",Marc Smeets,2020-05-31T13:23:18Z,0

"Dear Adriene,<br />I wanted to reach out and share the story of a group of people who have been inspired by your classes. On May 1, 2020 I formed a private FaceBook Group and invited friends to join me on your 30 Day Yoga Journey to help us keep active (and grounded) during the pandemic. Each day after members complete your yoga class (or other physical activity), they post a message in our group indicating  &quot;Done, Day (1), etc along with a comment about your class or how they felt that day. This process of checking in keeps us accountable while we support each other. The majority of members didn&#39;t know about you, kind-hearted Adriene, when we started the challenge, but we&#39;ve all fallen in love with your personality, Benji and your yoga practice. Here are some of our member&#39;s comments:<br /><br />*&quot;You&#39;ll love the butt slap in day 3 of Adriene&#39;s home yoga video LOL&quot; (CB)<br />*&quot;Love it. So not flexible LOL, so definitely going to be good for me. (MK)<br />*&quot;Just started Day 1 of yoga...hooray! Feeling good.&quot; (JRM)<br />*&quot;Day 5 done. Back to Adriene, grateful the intention today is to soften, noticed I&#39;m working harder than I need to be.&quot; (SSR)<br />*Day 7 done. Thank you for the great stretch, Adriene. I needed that (CB)<br />*&quot;Day 8. So nice to wrap ourselves in love. I love Adriene.&quot; (CA)<br />*I did Fresh Morning Yoga with Adriene at 5pm to see what will happen...I&#39;m feeling a lot more awake!&quot; (DG)<br />*&quot;I&#39;m noticing how the theme of each challenge has been matching what I need, Day 8 done, with much healing (SSR)<br />*&quot;Day 11: Crow pose. Sort of...ummm NOT.&quot; (CB)<br />*&quot;Those ab, boaty things are hard, Day 13 and 4k walk done (CA)<br />*&quot;Day 19 done: I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t given up. (CA)<br /><br />Adriene, we&#39;re now at Day 22! I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s often during the last week of a &quot;challenge&quot; is when people need extra words of encouragement to keep going. I&#39;m wondering if you can please &quot;STIR IT UP&quot; and send a message to our group to inspire them to continue. You can do this here publicly, PM me on FaceBook (Mary Chang, Story Writer) or contact me through my &quot;About the Writer&quot; page at: <a href=""http://www.marychangstorywriter.com/"">www.marychangstorywriter.com</a>  Love, yoga, namaste.

Wow it did not only stir me up physically but emotionally as well.  I use the blanket that was wrapped around my sweet Mother when she passed for my yoga and when I went to put it up I started sobbing it has been 7 years since she passed and of course I think of her daily but man for some reason it just really hit me after this practice.  Amazing emotional experience yoga brings forward.  Namaste!!!,Ellen Maher,2020-05-06T13:54:43Z,0

"Hey Adriene! I&#39;m so excited to be apart of this 30 day journey, and already know that I want to continue daily yoga after this session is over. I am wondering, when I do three-legged dog and that position where you bend your leg after three legged dog, I get major hip cramps. How can I work that out or prevent it or do you just have any suggestions for hip cramps? Is it just lack of muscles and flexibility? Let me know if you have any thoughts. So happy to be doing this, thanks so much for making this opportunity possible to everyone! &lt;3",MacKenzie Wardell,2020-04-30T18:08:55Z,0

"This journey has taught me to accept where I&#39;m at today. This is the first practice that I&#39;ve thought &#39;nope this is too much for me today&#39; at about the twenty minute mark. I was about to turn off the video when I saw the rest was settling into pigeon so decided to rejoin again. I&#39;ve brought this lesson of self-recognition, awareness and forgiveness into all other aspects of my life as well, and it&#39;s making life a much happier one - thank you Adriene x",shutupcharli,2020-04-18T21:25:46Z,0

"Ciao! 3 quick things: <br />1 What kind of yoga is this? <br /><br />I am 60 and fit, have always done physical activity... gymnastics, ballet, contemporary dance, jazz dance, spinning and yet I find some of the poses challenging, I feel STIFF (especially knees and hips) and some of the poses hurt. Is this normal, does it take practice, is the stiffness age-related (?)- although, as I said, I am fit, thin and the gym&#39;s doctor told me I have the biological age of a 35-year-old (...this sounds like I&#39;m showing off lol ;) <br />2 My question is: can anybody, at any age- with practice- become supple, pain-free and look as &quot;flawless&quot; as yoga teachers do? <br /><br />3 Is there any international certificate you would recommend to become a yoga teacher?<br /><br />Thank you.   .......With an almost 2 month-lockdown in beautiful Italy your course is a peaceful challenge I (almost;) daily look froward to.",MsIthinkthereforeIam,2020-04-17T11:09:20Z,1

I hope you&#39;re staying safe and well.<br /><br /><br />Okay, I have a question, when we do &quot;forward fold&quot; it is not my back or my thighs which really prevent me from going all the way down but rather my calves. They feel very tight and interfere the most. This also happens when I try to extend one leg at a time when we&#39;re doing Happy Baby or similar poses. Is there something I can do to help stretch these muscles or something? Thanks.",Jared White,2020-04-12T03:09:58Z,0

One thing that has come into my mind multiple times during HOME was if, in your future 30-day practices, you could maybe leave more time for just silence and breath during the practice? I use yoga as a place to calm my very busy, very over-stimulated mind, and I&#39;ve often wished we could have more time with just silence. I love your commentary dearly, and you make me laugh all the time, but sometimes the consistent presence of an external voice hinders relaxation and calmness for me.",Katie Watts,2020-01-29T18:35:46Z,0

"Oh, how I outta known it was gonna be hip openers. 💓💓The first pigeon I was already meeting resistance. Surrendering and listening to the feelings passing through. MANY. Healing a heart is weird. It&#39;s never linear. I also giggled out loud HARD with &quot;some of you are &quot;YEAAAAAAH!&quot; I was in that category. Those  hip swivels felt like magic stirring. 🧡💚💓 And as I leaned forward into my cow pose, the tears came a coming. I kept getting the internal message of &quot;it&#39;s ok to let go, the universe has got you&quot;..

"Stirred it up real good, today!! These three-legged downward dog with the &quot;spiderman abs&quot; made me go &quot;noooo, girl, we don&#39;t have time for that ab stuff work, today!!&quot;. Haha I was frustrated! I can have a hard time going into downward dog, at times. Maybe because my neck and back are always tense. I probably need to see the foundations of the pose. The rest of the practice was great, as it always is. Also, the cow legs were amazing!!! I didn&#39;t have hip problems but I loved the feeling in my hip flexors and overall body - so relaxed, at peace and lighter at the end of the video &lt;33",Sarah S.,2020-01-25T19:26:08Z,0

"I&#39;ve been in the practice humbly on and off for about 10-11 years. One thing that stuck with me a few days back was &quot;find your center and the rest will follow.&quot;  I&#39;ve never practiced that way. <br /><br />I&#39;m tall and awkward with hips off kilter, not enough strength in my center quite yet. I have more weight than i&#39;d like to carry, but finding my center has helped me in more ways than just being in balance on the mat. I feel like the 30 day practice is always restorative. And no matter how far I drift, the restorative practice always brings me back. <br /><br />Adrienne has such a way of projecting restoration. Exactly what this practice intended for me. A return to the practice of yoga and oneself. A return home.",Ashley Elliott,2020-01-25T09:06:52Z,0

I&#39;ve often heard the hips hold emotion and extended holds including hips can let some of those emotions release. This was my first time experiencing it myself.

My muscles/joints have been stiffer than usual these last few days so having this time to just relax and stretch them out has been really nice and therapeutic (like all yoga practices are) the one? Plank you did in this practice really stood out to be because my doctor has told me to try and avoid planks for health reasons and I have a really hard time finding a good replacement during yoga flows since they can be a big part of some practices.

"In my lesson today I was telling my instructor that I was having issues with rushing in a fast piece I&#39;m learning. He told me he explains rushing to his students by saying that they&#39;re on an 8 hour train ride. They can either enjoy the scenery, talk with a friend, read a book, etc, or they can sit there constantly look at the time because the train ride is so long and they have nothing to pass the time with. He said to practice enjoying the scenery more, meaning finding the little phrases in the piece that I can take more time with even if the whole thing is fast. <br /><br /><br />It made me think of this yoga practice and how it&#39;s usually my one time of the day where I can be fully present with my body and mind. I&#39;ve felt so much more in tune with my body, and can tell more easily when I&#39;m straining something (usually my neck), and how I can relieve the tension there without resorting to cracking it like I used to lol.

"Starting today&#39;s practice was hard for me. So many things on my plate and feeling overwhelmed.

"I&#39;ve done the 30 days of yoga last year and this year I got my best friend to do it with me. We managed to do half of the days so far together in my room, but she&#39;s been away for a while so we both have been doing  this on our own and just texting back and forth after each day about how we felt. It was extremely hard for me today to get on the mat, as I wasn&#39;t feeling my best and was worried I&#39;m gonna miss a day. So we ended up facetiming while doing yoga at the same time which was quite fun! Even though we weren&#39;t really talking to each other or anything, just the feeling that we are doing it at the same time really helped me.

I was awake until after 4am with sharp pains in the meat of my bum, which I know is back related; and with thoughts of the passing of my sweet Aunt Cindy whose tooth and nail battle with pancreatic cancer ended yesterday afternoon. As my brain and heart adjust to accept this, it was good for the mat to have my back and let me focus on my body for a bit.

Good Afternoon! I felt so awesome today when I learned that my hips are in dire need of attention! I was not able to go all the way down when doing pigeon. The forearms are what I made it too but the point is atleast I did give myself the courage to try to go all the way down but couldnt hold it that long due to really  tight hips. I love that your not only teaching us from your point of view but you remind us to be mindful of all the inbetweens and variations for different body types. I find that I am flexible and I move fast but in certain areas I use the arms for safety and as a clutch. I wish to get deeper. This reminds me of a yin class I once tried to take. Everytime I go deeper stretching the feet start to tingle. Is this normal and/ or does this signify anything important my body is trying to tell me?<br />Namaste,Amber Rose LOVE,2020-01-23T18:26:10Z,0

I must admit that I have skipped a few minutes because otherwise it would have been too exhausting for me. But I am glad that I still came here today to do yoga although I have just travelled 9000 kilometers. This practice showed me what being home feels like. for me home is trusting in my body and listening to my needs but also trusting myself when I feel that things are too much. <br />Greetings from the beautiful island La Réunion,Pia-Laetitia,2020-01-23T18:11:10Z,0
"Oh the beauty!! This one had me at “lets begin in extended child’s pose” (enter Kermit going crazy 😝)<br /><br />All jokes aside - this gave me so much joy. I have extremely tight hips after many years of dealing with a very bad back and a major back surgery 3 years ago. And today, I got much closer to a real pigeon than I ever have. And I actually got my knee over in cow pose (sitting on a pillow). I never ever thought this would be in my vocabulary! <br /><br />And my PT was delighted today when she saw the progress in the hip work. <br /><br />I am delighted and thankful and humbled. To find the courage to start believing in my body again - and feel the response - there are no words. <br /><br />Thank you. Thank you.",Svanhvit Reith,2020-01-23T18:10:37Z,38

Life is a gift, so like you say, we don&#39;t have to do anything but be aware of who we are and accept and love ourselves with gratitude!  One suggestion if you accept it, please make yoga practice routine for AM hrs and PM before bedtime. The morning practice, I like it to be energizing, (no jumping though) so to your opinion which asana routine is most energizing?  Which routing is most relaxing and conducive of deep sleep?

"In pigeon when you said &#39;if you&#39;re feeling a little tenderness, I&#39;ve got you&#39; I realized that I was feeling very tender and I could feel it start to bring up tears, but I breathed through it and allowed myself to just feel it, which stopped the crying. When I got to the same spot on the other side in pigeon, I felt that tenderness even more and I opened myself up to it to see what I was feeling. I realized I was feeling like a lost child, scared and alone. I realized that in that moment I really wanted a place to lay my head. And I cried for the rest of the pose. And I drew strength from the fact that my yoga mat has my back, Adriene, you have my back, I have my back by tending to myself and showing up every day. God has my back by loving me and bringing me back to him.

"Maybe a little drunk still but certainly hung over I poured myself on to my yoga mat this morning. Head throbbing, I wondered if I could even get through todays practice. I don&#39;t know what I was thinking last night--I don&#39;t even like beer. I chugged along with the video though and somehow at the end, felt rather amazing. Thanks Adriene. Thanks everyone that did yoga with me today.",Antonio de l'Enclos,2020-01-23T14:56:48Z,43

"I&#39;m so calm, wonderful feeling. <br />I&#39;m still sitting on the mat and I can&#39;t stop smiling. The day itself is great but this yoga practice made it even better. <br />I love pigeon, it always shows me that I&#39;m not as flexible as I would like to be. At the same time it gives me an opportunity to try harder so I can see the progress. But no pushing myself.<br /><br />I can&#39;t believe how many things I discovered recently because of the yoga practice. Thank you so much for that.",Osoroshii,2020-01-23T14:51:26Z,4

"Ha! Lindsey, when I started (about 4 years ago) my heels didn&#39;t even come close to touching the ground in downward dog. As a former gymnast who still walks on her toes from time to time, I had NO hope that they ever would.

Today&#39;s session stirred up so many emotions for me.

"Each practice seems to be exactly what I need for that day, today I felt connected and in sync. Pigeon pose makes me emotional. There&#39;s something when leaning forward that makes me feel intimately connected to my center. My mind wanders but I stay present. I&#39;m relaxed but working, it is not an easy pose for me. I never thought I&#39;d love it this much! Happy practice everyone 💙 Namaste",anamuinelo,2020-01-23T13:14:36Z,0

Wow that was something I wasn&#39;t expecting. For the first 10 mins I stopped and started 4 times as my body didn&#39;t feel right I felt really sick. Not sure why. But I took some deep breaths in easy pose then continued. Was fun doing the hip rolls haha I was &#39;gettin&#39; it in&#39; haha then the pigeon I always struggle with deep hip stretches as my hips are tight. But I took my time and also the knee cross Omg!   That was no joke. Was a rough start this practice but patiently carried on and feel warm and sore in the hips but it&#39;s a good ache as my dance teacher used to say haha,Nicole O Scott,2020-01-23T12:08:31Z,0

"Alexis, I’m 62 and have been practicing yoga for about 6 or 7 years in 1X/week classes. Last summer my instructor recommended Adrienne because I wanted more. Since joining the YWA family I’ve done 3 past 30 day series, a number of “what looks good today’s?” and now Home. You are an inspiration to me to keep going despite arthritis in a big toe that make it almost impossible to do some of the leg raised poses. I figure if that’s my only complaint I’m a lucky woman, and if I keep practicing perhaps I’ll avoid some of the other typical aging issues! Thank yo for sharing your age! I’m proud to be as old as I am. Every wrinkle, every area of crepey skin, every bit of roundness in my tummy reminds me I have lived a full and loving life.

Oh gosh I didn&#39;t realise that stir it up would stir up emotions. When I checked in with my emotional body at the beginning it all felt good but from pigeon onwards I couldn&#39;t stop my tears from flowing! Have had a hug from my dogs now and all good again but today helped me to release in a very unexpected way. So glad I was practicing at home alone today! I am realising how powerful yoga is and as always love the way you teach Adriene. Thank you. Have a peaceful thursday everyone. Namaste xxx,Karen Lynne,2020-01-23T09:08:36Z,0

I&#39;ve been struggling with anger and trust for years and, due to an effort to heal trauma (prompted by, among other things, pain in my lower back and hips) I am starting to heal.  YWA has helped, along with support from others.  Just this morning in meditation, I got that I can trust myself not to be abused again and I can tap into forgiveness and unconditional love for those who abused me.  And then, I read this just a few hours later - such a confirmation of inner wisdom.  Thank you.",Carol Raymond,2021-01-11T19:33:58Z,1

"Same here, nearly 2 years ago I fell and shattered many vertebrae in my back. I now have titanium rods and screws in half of my spine.

But this feeling in my back really does help me bring my attention to how I feel at every moment. I never mindlessly go through the movements anymore. I feel the intention of each movement and breath and work with what my body needs.",BJ,2020-05-29T14:25:41Z,0

I’ve been doing every year for the past 4 years and it breaks my heart to write that I had to stop last week as I’m in a air cast for sprained ankle that was unrelated. I’ve been doing yoga for 7 years and it’s my nightly routine along side you through darkest days to the joyous. I thought I need to scrub my feed so I don’t see the daily videos as it’s killing me to not be in the 30 days live anymore but I haven’t unsubscribed. I see the videos daily and know I’ll be back!

"I too once had to take a break from yoga when I sprained my ankle really bad!  The body heals (sometimes faster than excepted) and the down time during that process can be so special though brutely uncomfortable.  I highly recommmend looking into a supplement called Bone Strength by New Chapter...the renowed ballerina, Misty Copeland took it when she had shin surgery.  She went on to become a Primadonna after that!  Point is, you could be doing the 30 day series before you know it! ...gently, courageously and well on the mend.
