"This meditation changed my life. Full stop. I first discovered this video about a year and a half ago, at one of the lowest points of my life. I found myself sobbing the entire time, and that’s when I realized that I wasn’t truly living, and I had the power and desire to get better. I started practicing yoga and meditating every day, being intentional about my lifestyle and food choices, worked at shifting my mindset, and made uncovering and embodying my highest self a priority. I had wrapped myself in layers upon layers of conditioning, masks, and limiting beliefs; I felt that I was drowning. It took a lot of self-awareness and effort, but it was worth it. After this video popped up again in RENEW, everything came full circle and I was hit with a wave of realization and gratitude. I’m so grateful for everything I have experienced and learned, and how far I’ve come. I’m at a point in my life where I can fully embrace my authentic self, and am fortunate to have the opportunity to empower others to come into alignment with their authentic self.<br /><br />If you are struggling, just know that you are enough, and you have the power to be your own hero. Start today with small shifts, and it will keep growing little by little. One day you will look back, with your eyes welled up with tears, and come to the realization that you fully and truly love yourself, and share it with the world. And it will be beautiful. 💜",brenna routhe,2021-04-26T15:09:20Z,1

"Thank you 😊  its been quite sometime I am  always having negative feel. Recently I have started doing yoga with you. I couldn&#39;t do this meditation really well because i was getting distracted many times. But at last to make a smile, I was not able to smile and when you said let it be a fake smile, I smiled and which became a natural smile. Now I  feel like some big things has gone from mind or head. Hope I should be able to continue this and bring my old positive and happy life back. Thank yoy again and lot of love.",Bhuvaneswary R,2021-02-16T18:42:12Z,1
"Day 16 of Bridge here. I came to the mat today deeply unsettled-sadness, anxiety, all sorts of emotions. About halfway through this practice, I felt something, almost as if those feelings were melting away. When Adriene said to fake a smile if you have to, I felt something inside me go on, like a light, and that familiar tingle of a genuine smile came to my lips. Thank you for making this day a little brighter, Adriene, Namaste &lt;3",Rebekah Raible,2021-02-16T18:41:22Z,5

"This practice was an unexpected challenge for me - to sit in stillness and be affirmed and reaffirmed is not a comfortable place. I felt squirmy and the need to move. A beautiful reminder that there is always more to learn about ourselves, more grow through the practice of yoga. Thank you for this kind nudge of love &lt;3",dollfaceflash13,2021-02-16T16:59:50Z,1
&quot;I&#39;d rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I am not&quot; -Kurt Cobain. That&#39;s how I approach self love: not everyone likes me and that&#39;s okay.

"I&#39;m not quite sure why mediation makes me cry so much, and I&#39;m not sure I like crying, but I love the feeling of being loved and creating space for myself. I think I cry because I don&#39;t treat myself well but when I create space for myself it feels so strange and amazing that all my emotions just release.",Emily B,2021-02-16T16:43:35Z,1

"Dear Adriene, not sure if you would read this.  I’ve lost three aunties in the past two weeks due to Covid.  My mother is devastated.  I always tell her that I watch your videos and how much they help me.  This one would be an awesome gift to her  but my mom doesn’t speak English, only Spanish.  With all respect, I would like to ask you if you could consider one day to make a Spanish version of this lovely session.  I am sure this will be a great gift for my mom (and for all the Spanish speaker community)  thank you Adriene 🙏🏽",marita1977,2021-02-16T16:10:51Z,1

"Anyone else out there from Bridge? This session was more challenging for me than any of the yoga workouts.  I&#39;d LOVE to remember to apply this meditation to life situations.  It&#39;s really something I can do anywhere, such as when I&#39;m standing in line in the grocery store, driving in a traffic jam, or waiting for the dentist to check my teeth. I LOVE the mantra of breathing LOVE in and out.  That&#39;s so important to remember throughout the day, as I face life&#39;s challenges.",Joanne Katzman,2021-02-16T13:51:08Z,7
"This morning I woke up wanting to just go back to bed for 20 mins but I committed to showing up on my mat every day and I am glad I did - I was rewarded with almost the same time in meditation, and I was able to do it lying down.

On Saturday it was to wear a favourite outfit, as we are all in lockdown here and not really going out or wearing anything other than jeans - we all got dressed up for dinner!  I &#39;met&#39; a friend for drinks on zoom. We both got dressed up.  Other activities have been creative - to do some journalling...others have been reflective - light a candle and think of other who value your love and care.... that sort of thing.  It has been fun, and of the group of 7, most of us have done the activity most days.  One was to do an online yoga class 😊🙏🧘🏼‍♀️. You could easily compile your own list for next month, or even a week.  Its nice to have a focus and intention each day, as we know from doing yoga!  Namaste 🙏",Jaybee Bee,2021-02-22T19:06:12Z,3

"I’ve been stuck at home due to a foot surgery and the return to work has been rough. I haven’t moved much in over a month, and because of this I let shame and guilt seep in and take over. Today, I did a lovely foot injury workout that was gentle and loving toward my body. (I couldn’t find any foot injury videos of yours so I found a different creator and she actually reminded me a ton of you— she was gentle and caring and reminded the audience that we are ENOUGH. That our bodies are here to help us, and that moving in loving ways and treating it well is self love. Which is what I get from your videos. Anyway, I decided a meditation to calm me down after a workout was just what I needed so I returned to this video (one that I’ve watched a handful of times already) and man, I feel GOOD. Thank you for being you, creating this free and quality content and having a shining personality that puts us all at ease. That’s all. Much love :)",madi sun,2021-02-07T20:57:33Z,0

"It&#39;s been deeply instilled in me to put others first and neglect myself. I&#39;ve subconsciously learned that it&#39;s bad to take care of myself. I haven&#39;t learned to set boundaries with others and allow myself what I need. Because of this, I&#39;ve let others use me, exhaust me, let me down and destroy me. I&#39;ve invested myself in others, hoping one day to receive some love too, but I never got it. Even through different phases of change, I&#39;ve gone from one oppression to the other. <br />I&#39;m learning to love myself, and it&#39;s long and frustrating as I realize I still have the same reflexes. I take everything on myself, the disrespect, the pain, the responsibility, and I let others act wrongly with me repeatedly. <br /><br />Since yesterday, during a yoga practice, I&#39;ve started to speak to myself : <br />I love you, and I will take care of you. I will protect you, I will defend you. <br /><br />If anyone is going through the same kind of struggle, I hope this helps.",Hannah Meersseman,2021-01-28T12:43:10Z,1

While I was practicing this meditation all of the people I lost in life appeared in my head. I remembered that I never said a proper goodbye to any of them. During the practice I felt like this was the right time to forgive them while saying goodbye. With tears in my eyes I felt like I got rid of a burden I never knew I was carrying with me. Most importantly I finally had the courage of forgiving myself. Thank you Adriene! I wish you all a wonderful year :),Aden S. S.,2020-12-21T08:00:42Z,8
"I have been struggling a lot lately. I am attracted to someone who I shouldn’t be attracted to, at least it would be frowned upon.

"I was reading the comments before I started, &amp; I kept reading about how so many burst into tears during/after this. I didn’t expect to, but I did, as well - especially at the end whispering “I am worthy of love. I am love.” <br /><br />My body is still recovering from not believing that for so long. I forget how much that mentality has impacted me, until I’m actively giving myself love; &amp; then I remember how much I’ve deprived myself of it. I let myself &amp; the wrong people convince me that I didn’t deserve love or happiness. I’ve been working to heal for a while now. <br /><br />This definitely stands as a reminder to be gentler with myself. I’m very glad I decided to start my day with this. It’s inspired me to treat myself how I’d treat somebody I love. <br /><br />Thank you Adrienne. You are light. 🙏🏻💓",Gemma Farquhar,2020-10-20T12:47:30Z,0

"Contemplation is the highest expression of man’s intellectual and spiritual life. It is that life itself, fully awake, fully active, fully aware that it is alive. It is a spiritual wonder. It is spontaneous awe at the sacredness of life, of being. It is gratitude for life, for awareness and for being. Thomas Merton	💙",Meditation Music Spirit,2020-09-27T01:14:02Z,0

"I come back to this video regularly but today it was absolutely what I needed! Thanks for all you do!  I give love at my job and it is my role to help others feel safe, love and accepted and worthy of love. But this video, like so many others have said before me drew me to tears. Maybe for the love I give everyday, maybe for the world that is chaotic and so many who struggle in pain, but also for the fact that I stopped, I allowed my breaths to wash over me and accept that I am love. I deserve love and that simple message, of taking time to feel the love within myself makes the work I do more powerful when I have love for me flowing in and out with each breath I can give love to the world in need.",Jessica Pirrone,2020-09-09T02:06:52Z,0

Thank you for this beautiful guided meditation. The first time you said &quot;I am worthy of love. I am love.&quot; really hit me.

"Hi Adriene, I know this may not get noticed but I felt the need to post it irregardless. I’m severely self conscious of my physical appearance and have always hated myself ever since I can remember, it is also a part of why I am severely depressed. Joining in with this meditation video was the first time I ever felt slightly positive about myself. I can’t thank you enough for this, you truly do make others so happy x",The Erin VC,2020-08-18T10:58:20Z,0

"Greetings. Please, excuse this interruption. <br />THIS IS IMPORTANT.<br /> IDK how to tell you this, but we are in serious need of meditation in order to raise our vibrations. And, the meditations will also help us to relinquish the past, and welcome the new future. The reason why it’s so urgent is because we had the 36 year window, 18 years before, and 18 years after December 21, 2012. And, it is not clear how much longer Kryon will be our guide through this human evolution. The energies of the earth, and of humanity are changing, and we must help them to change into the mysterious beautiful future we want to experience. We are told by channeler Alcazar of the Kryon Group that we should incorporate meditations of gratitude, of deep gratitude that fills the heart. Think of something or someone that you are thankful for, and hold that feeling. And then feel it deep in your heart. And hold it there.<br /><br />Let’s meditate to vibrate higher, and to ring in our mysterious, beautiful, new future, together, in love.",Shawn Nieves,2020-07-31T00:33:19Z,0

"Today, i have been feeling really down. I had a feeling that im a black sheep among the white sheeps. Always being insecure about my thoughts, speaking out my thoughts, body, me. I had a feeling that nobody understands me which is result why i don&#39;t have many friends. I kinda wanted to change so others would like me, but that didn&#39;t workout much. Now, few mins ago i went to my room and searched &quot;meditation videos&quot; and saw this. First i was a little uncomfortable and nervous while i was trying to get &quot;comfortable&quot; but i did it somehow. When u first said &quot;remember we are worthy, worthy of love&quot;, i just felt a tear running down my cheek as my throat (voice) was shaking. Not even a 3 minutes after, i could feel my tears drop on my thighs but i was still able to act calm. Dear Adriene, thank you so much, I never knew i needed this until now. Later i went to the bathroom to splash my face with cold water and i repeated the same thing when i was looking myself on the mirror... &quot;i am worthy, i am love.&quot; Again, thank you so much for teaching me that and i am looking forward to be doing this again, over and over again because it really helped me :).

"Today was just another one of those days where I’m smiling and laughing then the next I’m crying, feeling so low and alone. I know my family and friends love me and I know that if i open up to them they will try and help me, despite me thinking they will judge me. But it’s myself and my thoughts that I’m battling with. For years I have been battling with this feeling, of wanting to be accepted. I said my family loves me, but i don’t feel like i belong there. I don’t feel like i belong anywhere. I’m not diagnosed with depression and i don’t know if this feeling is even depression or just sadness but I’m tired of constantly being upset, bitter about life, how things are not fair. I understand that some people in my life are busy and that’s the problem, I understand that they have other things to think about so why do i feel neglected and the love isn’t enough? Why cant i just be thankful that i have a home and I have a job? I always think to myself, just put up with it until you live by yourself but I’m afraid that i cannot promise anyone what i will end up doing in the future. I’m battling depression but how come no one sees it? I don’t want to bother my family anyone or be a hassle to my friends so i guess that’s why I’m writing it here. I needed your words today and I feel so much better expressing myself. Thank you.",_ Gonzales,2020-07-28T14:52:49Z,0

"I love meditating with my spirit guide - Adriene! I believe I have problem with my back. When in seated postures, when trying to keep the head over heart, heart over pelvis - my back gets stiff and it even mildly hurts. If I try to relax it - my posture gets off-balance (no more head over heart, heart over pelvis). I am not quite sure what to do in this case - should I ruin the posture to get my back relaxed, or should maintain the posture at all cost? Your thoughts will be of great help. Namaste!",Georgi Tsenov,2020-07-16T22:03:00Z,0
"I found that I needed to lie down in order to not have tension in my right hip :/ Loved the meditation. Spent it lying down with my legs butterflied. Just a curiosity: I felt like saying love is within me would have been more accurate than saying I am love. Thoughts? I recently took a tip from The Midnight Gospel and placed my awareness inside my hands and arms and I felt love inside myself, so I am intrigued by the concept right now.",Jonathan Yonts,2020-07-16T18:12:00Z,0

I don&#39;t feel worthy of love. I get some sense of it but when i try my intellect starts to rationalise why i&#39;m not worthy and stirs up a bunch of negative thoughts and it&#39;s hard to silence or counter these thoughts and feelings. <br />I guess it&#39;s a practise and it takes time but boy am i good at feeling bad,qooiuler,2020-07-14T19:18:50Z,0

"Hey Adriene! (and Benji and the yoga community) I was wondering if you could make a meditation video for people with eczema and atopic dermatitis. I have really severe eczema and I have been finding that meditation has been helping me not itch and scratch so much. Sometimes, eczema and atopic dermatitis can be caused by stress and anxiety, and you have created a safe place for me to release my anxiety in a healthy way. I don&#39;t know if I can make a request, but I sure am gonna try💟 You and the yoga community have changed my life so much! Thanks!!

The music of Yoga with yourself will be forever my friend.  Thank you so much most sincerely, I am<br />full of gratitude for your beautiful, for me, spiritual, practice.

"I lost a lot of people the past few years, both from betrayal and passing away. It’s not so much ‘feeling’ alone than <b>knowing</b> I am more or less alone that has been so painful to process day to day. This helped me start to feel like I can manage that pain and maybe even feel a little bit better. During the breathing, a mantra came to me “Love is Here.” on the inhale and “Love is Now.”  on the exhale. This simple concept has already lifted me up so much. I don’t need to hurt from a lack of Love. It’s already here. Love is now.",frosty skeletons,2020-05-20T23:06:27Z,0

"I just discovered your channel a week ago. I can say I am so grateful for you Adrienne! 💕 <br />I&#39;m in a recovery program, been in my home in NJ for 9ish weeks (with 3 kids!) I&#39;ve been embracing my recovery and trying to work on myself during quarantine. About two weeks ago I had what I call a spiritual awakening. I&#39;d attended a webinar that talked about having a daily meditation practice. I was moved by the webinar itself but the price was outrageous, over a $1200. I have had a hard year, recently on my own with my kids after a bad break-up. No way I could afford that. My new tv had your meditation on one of the free Roku channels. Now I&#39;m hooked. Yoga in the am, yoga and meditation before bed. I&#39;m one week in, you have changed my life, my view of myself, my serenity. I&#39;m so grateful for you. 💕💕💕💕 Today I celebrated 1000 days clean. And day 7 in building a new me. Thanks for being a part of my world.",Kara Wood,2020-05-18T05:18:58Z,1

"When she goes&quot; Inhale lots of love in, exhale lots of love out&quot; I was somehow thinking of my ex lasted over 4 years who cheated on me. <br />I know my mind should be clear while doing this but It was my last serious relationship and since we broke up,  I&#39;ve been seeing a bunch of different guys and been on many dates just because I wanted to move on. I haven&#39;t thought of him more than a year on daily ever since. <br /><br />When the part comes, I couldn&#39;t help but thinking of him and noticed my inner anger that&#39;s been hidden, slowly came out. But,  this &quot;exhale lots of love out&quot;  part, instantly calmed me down and switched my mind to sending love and forgiveness and I burst into tears. Managed to brought myself back at peace at the end.   <br /><br />It was totally unexpected and bizarre but I needed this. I feel I am worthy. I deserve to love and to be loved again.

"This guided meditation was exactly what I needed this morning. I&#39;m following the April 2020 Calendar, and this one was a new one for me. Lately, I have been dealing with a lot of self-love and body image issues. The spring semester wrapping up and distance learning and social distancing at home has not been helping with that. Now that my class schedule has wound down to one summer class, I want to start to rededicate time to include time on the mat, every. single. day. Taking the time to slow down and remind myself, &quot;I am worthy of love,&quot; and &quot;I am love,&quot; really impacted me today, and I know I&#39;ll carry those thoughts through the rest of my day. Thank you for everything you do.",Emma Downing,2020-05-13T13:50:21Z,1

When you said, “You are love”, it was so powerful.❤️ Today has been an emotional day, not just be because of its nature, but also because I’m considering rekindling some old friendships that I lost to my depression and anxiety. The reason why I distanced myself and is still afraid to get close again is the same; I believe that I am not worthy of their love, and that they deserve more than what I could ever give to them.

"During this lock down I find myself needing more calming moments, and rather than being alone with my thoughts I decided to put on this meditation. I decided to do it lying down because it&#39;s 10:30 pm where I am, and after ten solid minutes I was so calm, so relaxed, when I was told to lift the corners of the mouth and smile, I actually did and got tears in my eyes, so pure and wholesome was this innocent command to me.

"I just want to thank you for this video. I recently started meditating and I do cry each and every time, but today was different - I finally got to see internally where it might come from (a true connection within myself). Less than 2 months ago, my father passed away (rest in peace). Today, as I held my hand over my chest (where I typically rest my hand during meditation to sooth the child in me), I began to see that child (myself) playing with her father and that is when I knew where my father was in my heart. This is extremely overwhelming, but so uplifting and comforting and I can&#39;t thank you enough. From the bottom of my heart, please doing what you are doing because the world loves and appreciates it. &lt;3",Julia Reeves,2020-04-10T15:43:48Z,0

Loving/trusting myself is so important now -- to be able to then extend the love outward. Thank you Adriene! ♥️",KitKat,2020-04-10T11:27:15Z,0

I have found your channel at random and this was my first time meditating. I have a hard time loving myself and allowing to be loved. I never talk to anyone about my feelings and this is actually the first time here telling (or at least writing) about what I think and even if nobody will ever see this I feel like I&#39;m writing this to myself because this meditation made me realize how broken I am inside. I think if I&#39;ll keep meditating I&#39;ll maybe get better so thank you for those 13 minutes.,Julia ',2020-04-09T01:00:34Z,0

"I purposely looked for a guided meditation for self-love after journaling and hitting a core belief of self-hatred. &quot;I am worthy of love&quot; initially had me with tears streaming down my face, hitching inhales and exhales.

"I started doing yoga a while ago. And it was always fun for me, of course challenging, but also fun. Meditation was something I really struggled with. When I tried to sit still, or even lie still, for a couple of minutes, I found myself thinking a thousand thoughts a minute and feeling how my whole body itches. After a year or so of practice, this is no longer a problem. I have to admire how my body and mind changed and adapted. I can focus on your voice and my breath and stay still. It is a beautiful experience. Thank you for being my yoga guide through all kinds of moments. Namaste &lt;3",iwasacloud,2020-03-27T18:26:23Z,0

While breathing in love I was imagining all the people I received love from in my life and those beautiful moments, that we shared and that I&#39;m so grateful for. And while bathing out I was thinking of moments when I expressed my love to them in words or actions or presents. Ans I was surprised by the variety of situations that I came up with.

Your meditation videos help subjugate the negative perspective that i have and degrading thoughts that i always believe in. Yesterday you helped me calm my anxiety, though a sobbing cycle happend henceforth, but you provided a hope that i’m in control and thus, having the ability to overcome my anxiety. Today i’ve been aware of my constant insecurity whenever i look or think about other people so i decided to try this meditation out. I realized that i’m worthy of love and i can overcome this agonizing journey by being gentle and kind to myself. Namaste",M Y,2020-03-16T15:53:15Z,0

"Did this meditation today while mindfully cleaning my mat :) Yesterday&#39;s session was quite slippery, so it needed cleaned before it could be used again, and I didn&#39;t want to use it while wet, so I thought this would be the best of both worlds.

"Thank you for this meditation, I reflect on things that I got and that, I think, I do not deserve, but this meditation made me understand that only when we are open to receive love from the world, we can give it back. This really inspired me, because I&#39;m feminist and I was really angry at all those misconceptions about national women&#39;s day (today)  because in Russia it is all about flowers, chocolate and word such as girls, keep being beautiful and gentle, and make men happy. And I was so annoyed that it has nothing in common what women in the past where fighting for. But after your meditation, I sublimated my anger into a passion to do something meaningful and wrote a post on Facebook, where I shared why I don&#39;t think that It makes sense to give those commonplace presents that nobody cares about and that are not connected to women&#39;s rights and at the end of this text I encouraged people to support organization that helps victims of domestic violence as an alternative present. Because I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say: all women need flowers, perfumes and cosmetics, but what I&#39;m sure about is that every woman needs to safeness and while every 5th woman in Russia can&#39;t get it and becomes a victim of violence, we should do something with that. So, thank you, Adrien, for inspiring me to transform my anger into a message about love and support to those who really require and deserve it. Send you love and light, namaste",Maria Voytinsky,2020-03-08T07:33:52Z,0

"I recently move to another country and I’ve been struggling a lot with the feeling of loneliness,specially when I wake up, I feel every one who truly cares about me is far away and that I’m on my own. This little meditation really helped me to see how love is all around me in this new place: the place itself, the people I’m meeting, the things I’m doing, my OWN company and care. Thanks Adriene!",Philomena Mateu,2019-12-12T06:42:57Z,1
"I just ended my relationship and really needed a space to be myself again. So much of this video felt like it was speaking to me, especially when Adriene asked us to trust we had made the right decision in selecting this video. I have been trying to trust I made the right call for a while now, and realizing that if I can trust myself in small decisions like which meditation to do, I can trust myself in big decisions like leaving a romantic partner. There is so much love all around - I AM love. Thank you for reminding me of that &lt;3",Emily Cote,2019-12-12T00:49:42Z,0

"Thank you, Adriene! Your meditations really help me. Once or twice a month anxiety hits me. I feel so insecure about my appearance, I want to loose weight but whatever I do, It doesn’t help... maybe because my body physically is not able to do this. And I don’t want to starve myself! So when I compare myself to the models (I am working as a model in my free time), I realize that I am not as skinny as other models, so I feel so insecure about my body... these thoughts are constantly disturbing me... I am so sick of it. I don’t know how to accept myself. It is very hard. But your videos do really help me to accept myself the way I am. I will try my best to be in love with my body and myself .❤️",Amanda,2019-10-26T18:58:24Z,0

"This one got me.  I too began crying.  I’ve realized how sad and stressed I’ve been.  My 3rd grade classroom has been incredibly difficult this year and I kept thinking that it’s because of me and my actions.  It might be, but life is a 2-way street.  It has really brought me down and I’ve felt depleted in my love and kindness of my students, but more importantly, love of my self.  It’s exhausting.  I needed this meditation to remind myself to love again.  Even if it’s for me.  By taking care of myself, maybe I’ll get back on track and love these little kiddos again.  I so want to.  I don’t like feeling this way and the students shouldn’t have a teacher that isn’t 100%.  I hope to get back.  This one I’ll be practicing a lot.",Erica Jasna Struble,2019-10-19T19:38:45Z,8

We bring ourselves down so much on a daily basis, calling ourselves names and so on... But we are worthy of love and lots of it. And perhaps if we breath in all the love we can, the idea of us being &quot;Love&quot; wouldn&#39;t be too foreign. Adriene, gracias mi amor. &lt;3",Raz,2019-10-18T02:00:58Z,8

"Dear Sister, Adriene, Thank you so much for these programs you create and share.   I am becoming more regular with my yoga practice, thanks to you... :-)   I am also attending yoga classes twice a week, here in Silver City... just to force myself to absorb as much of this healing, yogic energy to feed my body, as possible.  Working steadily now, to reach<br /> the goal of integrating yoga practice into my mornings, every day.   I want you to know how much I appreciate your bringing the aspect of self-love into the yoga picture.  I believe that a lack of self love is one of the sources of the turmoil we see in the world today, so this work you do, to encourage our fellow human beings, to really feel the love they have for themselves, and to grow it, and become LOVE... is such important work, for us as individuals, and as a culture, society, and world of loving brothers and sisters.  Much gratitude flows from my heart to you...  I really appreciate  all you are doing. &lt;3",Richard McDonald,2019-10-01T17:54:03Z,0

"Much like Cheryl Anne, I too began to cry. <br /><br />I am working through a break-up. And it helped to remind myself that I am worthy of love, and that I am love. <br /><br />Breathing in, I thought of all the good and breathing out, I thought of all I gave. <br /><br />It is hard and I miss it, but this is what I need - a reminder to know I love so much. <br /><br />Thank you, Adriene. I&#39;ll catch you next time :) <br />and to all the others out there - Thank you, and know that you are loved &lt;3",CoDLover7771,2019-09-30T13:04:18Z,0

"Thank you so much for this. In my meditation spot today on the pier in Mobile bay their were sharks circling the water. My spirit animal is a porpoise and I see them often. I did not know what this meant at the time, but I jumped on YouTube looking for yoga and gladly clicked on this meditation. I quickly realized I was so caught up in the drama of my complicated marriage that I had forgotten that I was worthy of love. And that I need to feel this to continue to be there for my kids and show them that love. When I finished just now, the sharks were gone. Now on I go today to Find My Porpoise (Purpose).",Allen Shorter,2019-09-28T11:43:01Z,0

"Been watching for years now and joined the YwA community almost two yrs ago. I appreciate and have greatly benefited from the different focuses of the videos. QUESTION: Adrienne can u put together a video focused around yoga for post breast augmentation? My lower body is so tight, as a result of stopping yoga completely (i normally do yoga 4 times a week as a healthy practice). I&#39;m wondering if u can suggest or demonstrate any modified or targeted positions to stretch it out.  This surgery has been incredibly hard on my body.

"Thank you so much for this video. I really needed it. I&#39;ve really not been loving myself lately and it&#39;s been showing in how I act sometimes. I just started getting back into yoga fairly recently and I&#39;ve been using your videos to help with it. Back when I first started college, I was mentally and physically at my healthiest and I&#39;m pretty sure it was because of all the yoga I did. Once I started university, I stopped doing yoga cause I didn&#39;t have the time, but my mental and physical health definitely started to decline. I really hate myself now and I&#39;m making a big effort to combat the negative self-talk going on inside of me. I just turned 28 and I really want to fall back in love with myself and try and improve the bad in me so I can spread good. I definitely cried during this one, but it was a good cry. <br /><br /><br />Sorry for the long comment. TL;DR: Getting back into yoga to improve my life and this video was just what I needed. Thank you!",Mushrambo,2019-09-24T12:18:13Z,0

I am hurting right now: grieving a much-loved pet and weighing up my other relationships. I am hurting, but I am also OK. I took the time after this practice to write and send a short and gentle goodbye to a friend, to our ailing, imbalanced, crazy-making almost-friendship. I can agonize over this stuff way too long. I love the idea I can be there for everyone, that I am strong enough, and generous enough. But I love the idea of treating each other, and myself, with kindness and respect more.

"This came in as always, just at the right time. Yesterday I attended a public sound meditation class, which was a first time for me, and I experienced a very strong panic attack, which took me quite a while to get over it and calm down. I inherently started fearing whether that would happen the next times I try meditating, and this morning I started my day with this video. It wasn&#39;t very easy but it gave me the courage to stick with it and dive deeper, and not to neglect whatever is going on in the subconscious. I will keep attending to it, maybe as preventive care or maybe as remedy sometimes. Loads of love to you all! Namaste &lt;3",Ceren Güneş,2019-09-22T21:06:26Z,0

"I have a spare bedroom that has just about become my yoga/workout room. Years ago on vacation I bought a very small set of wind chimes that is hanging off a plant hanger near the window in that room. There&#39;s also a ceiling fan that I always turn on during yoga ( i like the feeling of moving air during practice) that creates a gentle breeze that moves the chimes.  Most days I&#39;m breathing too deeply/heavy to hear the chimes but during slower practices and meditation I can hear their gentle music. It always settles me and moves me at the same time. It&#39;s so soothing, especially during meditations like today. Thank you Adriene for the slow down to help me hear the music that moves my soul.   Hope everyone is having a great Sunday!

"I&#39;ve been suffering from heavy depression for this whole year, and I&#39;ve got challenging time creating routines and having motivation to get off my bed for the most days. At times i remember and get the strength to tone in to Adriene&#39;s channel, and never regret beating myself to do some yoga or meditation, even though i might feel too ugly or think i have wrong shape of body to do yoga, but the acceptance and kindness draw me in every time, despite my insecurities. It has been so hard to find myself worthy or lovable, so this meditation, and most of the yoga practices touch my heart to the very core, and i can&#39;t help but cry through most of the videos. Adriene&#39;s sweet kind words are the opposite of how I talk to myself in my head, her words make me so humble and grateful and i get hope of learning to love and appreciate myself for who i am, thankful for existing. I&#39;m trying my best to get better, and these sweet sweet words of encouragement help me so much! I need to tone in more reguraly... Thank you so much, from the bottom of my heart, for the support and guidance💓💓💓💓",r_i_e_n_a _,2019-09-22T15:41:18Z,24

"Ciao Adriene, here&#39;s my story. My son started 1 year ago following you and had a profound benefit and started to explore himself and solve quite some issues with his state of mind. 2 months ago my dad has been hospitalized and since then things have dropped steadily to the point that is now close to end his life. Both my parents (my mom died 10 years ago) are full of love and have passed me their love since I was born and I&#39;m returning it now to dad just because I feel it and makes me feel good. But the last weeks have been pretty tough. I&#39;ve started following you beginning of august with your beginner video and the moved to the 30 days when I felt ready. Alternating some other practice with the 30 days and some meditation. I&#39;ve just finished this meditation and found my self in tears while breathing love in and out, a peaceful and cleaning cry. Thanks for helping me in this incredible tough time of my life. Peace.",Enrico Guala,2019-09-22T09:33:04Z,9
Enrico Guala hang in there! you are not alone in this tough time.
