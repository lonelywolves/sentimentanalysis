This session is not a fix all but I think it does a damn good job of gently putting you in an empowered role to center in your awareness and guide yourself forward. <br />Because no one else can do that for you. <br />No guru. It has to be you.<br /><br />How are you feeling after today&#39;s practice?,Yoga With Adriene,2021-03-07T14:03:03Z,1056

"I have been following her channel for almost 7 years now but all these years I have been introduced to some really amazing yoga videos and now when I got back to her channel I feel she talks more and gets less done. She is so busy talking that she forgets that we are in a pose here waiting. She talks so much that she forgets right side left side. She has her own terminology which is not yoga asana names at all which can confuse audience who are looking for serious yoga. Here references to creaky old floor, peanut butter, movies and songs are never ending. Her videos are more and more falling to a level of chatting talking and doing some asanas in between. She is good if you are looking for entertainment. Cat meffan, yoga lates with Rashmi and breathe and flow are such amazing channels with serious yoga. Crisp and to the point. After having following her channel for so long I think I am super disappointed and Definitely will not watch her videos.",shradhajatkar,2021-04-11T05:07:33Z,0

"Well, felt like leaving my first ever comment under a video. Hi, hello, hope y‚Äôall having a great day :) <br /><br />Today&#39;s practice felt really special for some reason. Even yesterday I was looking at the 46 minute timer and felt a bit scared, cause I think that&#39;s the longest video in a while for me (I have successfully missed it last month). But I really tried to think about doing it since the evening  to work up the motivation and, to my surprise, I managed. And it felt very nice and liberating in the end! Especially when somewhere in the middle of our dance I realised that, despite not being anywhere as consistent with my practice as a lot of you, I felt stronger in my moves. <br /><br />Yesterday was hard for me mentally. The project I‚Äôve been working on for almost 2 months got taken down due ‚Äònot being as useful as was originally expected‚Äô (despite the fact that I kept on saying how it might not be what managers expect, no one listened to just an intern). My mom was in my ass about not calling auntie to wish her Happy Birthday, but just sending a message, cause she keeps on thinking that sending a message = not caring. For some reason these things really bugged me, so starting my day with this sequence really felt like a Fresh Start. <br /><br />Ever since a few years ago, after I broke my arm, I never managed to go back to any form of activity consistently. I tried multiple times and would always stop cause I felt like if I missed a few days - there was no point in doing it altogether. But ever since finding Adriene again after so many years (I used to do her videos before breaking my arm to support my always-in-pain low back), I decided to approach it differently and not bully myself for skipping a few days or even a week. So I may not be all that impressive, but showing up for a practice 14 times last month was an accomplishment already. <br /><br />Trying to continue this month and got 8/10 in April so far! And to celebrate, I‚Äôm gonna gonna and make myself very yummy sandwich for breakfast/lunch. <br />Hope whoever reads has a great weekend! Have fun and RENEW :)",Nika Weller,2021-04-10T14:46:01Z,4

"If I drink more alcohol,  In the next morning or middle of the night I will get anxiety or panic attack what to do?any yoga for alcoholics??",jignesh ji,2021-04-04T19:01:27Z,0
"It sounds like you&#39;re in a tough place, please speak to your doctor. It&#39;s important to have a medical ally to help you with alcohol issues. They can work with you to decrease your drinking and to deal with your anxiety. Alcohol is a depressant and anti-anxiety, but it reduces serotonin, so when the alcohol wears off you just feel more anxious. People drink more and more and their anxiety gets worse and worse. It can destroy your life. Getting help to treat your anxiety and to cut back your alcohol use will have you in a better place. Yoga can be a tool to help, but having a medical professional on your side through this, helping you set out a plan, is an important tool as well. Take care",Prosateuse,2021-04-10T23:03:57Z,0

"Favorite ironic moment with Adriene (214th consecutive day of YWA&amp;B):  1st place ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start in a comfortable seat.‚Äù  Because of a lifetime of muscle stiffness, joint inflexibility and lousy posture, virtually no seated position involving crossed legs, a vertical spine or any other pose involving good posture is ‚Äúcomfortable‚Äù for me.  All attempts to approximate them are all very active (uncomfortable) poses, involving intentional muscle action, often with shaking, heavy breathing, etc.  They are helpful in many ways but nonetheless make me grimace and giggle every single time.  First runner up: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in this for 5, 4,...‚Äù. In real life - ‚Äúpush up to a full plank (takes 3 seconds), lengthen your spine, let your front body come up to reach your back body (7 seconds), focus on lengthening your spine (4 seconds), you can do this, you got this, we‚Äôre in this for 5, 4, (8 seconds), hang in there (3 seconds), 3, 2, 1 (3 seconds), release everything down to the floor (1 really short second).

"SHLM &amp; HaB (peace &amp; love).  The Name of the Creator is Hayah asher Hayah, as what He told Mose (Exodus 3:14), preserved in the Hebrew Scriptures.  There is a curse to the G-o-d name (Isaiah 65:11-12), preserved in the Hebrew Scriptures.  All followers of the Messiah are to do the 7 appointed times (Leviticus 23), but no more animal sacrifices, following the Crucifixion of the Messiah.  We are now of the order of MLK TSDQ (King, righteous), to Whom ABRaHM tithed.  Ask the Messiah to be your personal Savior.  He is the Atoning Offering for mankind for the remission of sin ( 1 John 2:1-2).  He said to him, I am the way, the truth and the life.  No one comes to the Father except through me (John 14:6).  If you believe the Messiah died on the cross, &amp; Resurrected three days later (presenting Himself as First Fruits to the Father), please ask Him to be your Savior.  He is the ONLY way to Everlasting Life.  Yoga allows demons to enter the temple/body.  Ask the Creator to help you not do this matter.",Gina Rios,2021-03-17T01:33:07Z,0

I have a question for all of you Adriene followers.  I&#39;ve been following Adriene for a while now and have done about four of her 30 day yoga challenges along with some of her random videos.  I am feeling more toned and stronger but instead of losing weight I have gained about five pounds.  Is this normal?  Has anyone else gained weight instead of lost weight?,elsamere,2021-03-15T19:37:22Z,0

Most of the basic movements are so hard for me, that sometimes I burst into tears.<br /><br />I want to take my time and go slow, and I would really like to follow step-by-step practice by B. K. S. Iyengar. In his book &quot;Light on Yoga: Yoga Dipika&quot;, there is a plan divided into 1-2 weeks periods for total starters. In this period you&#39;re supposed to learn few asanas, get used to them and then add a new one.<br /><br />Is there any way to ask you to make 1 video for each of those weeks for the first, basic level?<br />I would absolutely buy them as a product, and having you showing the practice would help me so much!<br /><br />If somebody reading this comment knows about such videos - please, share a link, I&#39;ll be very grateful!",–ü–æ–ª–∏–Ω–∞ –®–∏–ø—É–Ω–æ–≤–∞,2021-03-13T21:16:29Z,0

"I&#39;m not going to lie, I started this and got to the 27-minute mark before I got super frustrated and wanted to cry because I felt like I couldn&#39;t do those movements and I think that because I&#39;m already a bit emotionally overwhelmed that I was genuinely upset about that, enough to &quot;give up&quot; for a while if you will. I had to pause the video and drink my tea for a few minutes to settle down and remind myself that new things are hard, that THIS was hard, but that&#39;s ok. <br /><br />I&#39;m going to try that part again, but this time with the knowledge that I will get better and this is the fresh start and simply a baseline for what&#39;s to come. <br /><br />Deep breaths.

I love Adriene&#39;s message about taking time for yourself and it&#39;s so true that just showing up is the hardest part. Now that yoga is here for me everyday I feel much more connected with myself and no longer feel guilty that I&#39;m giving up something else to do this.

"Adriene,.....what would have led you to seeking adidas as a sponsor? I feel sad to see that you have combined yogic teachings with what seems a self seeking plan for you to make money through unethical means. While Adidas has shown that it is making progress in terms of sustainability and labour rights, at the end of the day the brand is still very much a part of the fast fashion industry. Producing huge quantities of garments (most of which are not made from sustainable materials) has disastrous effects not only on the environment, but also on workers who often have to work long hours for very little pay in order to reach production targets.",Amelia Swan,2021-03-10T09:21:30Z,0

"I&#39;m a retired businessman, spend a lot of time in the gym and on horseback. Due to corona I&#39;m limited to horsejumping, so I decided to compensate with yoga. My God, I can&#39;t even sit straight without forcing my hips, my joints are stiff, I lose my balance and  so on. I hope it will turn for the better! I sincerely thought I was&#39;in good shape as I train in the gym with guys half my age and on horseback even less!!!
