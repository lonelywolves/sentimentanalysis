Awareness of breath, of my body&#39;s feelings, the need to get in some more stretches with balance in mind.  Thank you for this program.

I found myself discouraged as I looked and tried to convince myself I might be qualified for this job, or maybe that career....I felt like a mismatched puzzle piece with forced qualities. But when you asked why did we start this practice, the answer popped into my brain. I want to pursue yoga everyday. There is no force involved. Now I can write to them about my best qualities  and why I am here. Let them know I have all this beautiful curious scientific brain and I want to work in the field of science and healthcare. HERE I AM READY AND WILLING TO SPECIALIZE! Thank you for helping me write an honest cover letter that speaks to my better qualities. Openness and the curiosity to be better.

"Went for a walk today and thought &quot;Geeze, I really feel like I&#39;m on a hamster wheel&quot;...and I MAY have said this out loud because...I was alone and in nature haha. And I graduated college in 2020 and have finally found a job, but it&#39;s not really what I want to do full-time, I think. It&#39;s crazy when you realize what the working world is--how many hours of life people dedicate to their jobs. I&#39;ve worked summer jobs before, and worked part-time in college but I don&#39;t know...it all seems so strange after so many years of school. <br /><br />Anyway, after doing this practice today I read the description, and when you mentioned the hamster wheel bit, I had to smile to myself. Sometimes it is so hard make time for yoga, or to motivate to do this practice when I&#39;ve missed a few days. But I do feel SO much better when I can commit and make the time. And I really am searching for ways to create meaning and comfort in my life. After finding Yoga With Adriene last March, right when the pandemic hit, I do feel like I have changed my thinking and experience surrounding my body. I notice more how I&#39;m moving, transitions between plank and downward dog feel more natural, and whenever there are days where I don&#39;t do yoga (Shhh!) I can actually feel my body missing it--can feel the need to stretch and move.<br /><br />So thanks lovely Adriene! We do so appreciate you. &lt;3",musicsummer12,2021-03-04T03:02:42Z,1

When i sat down on the mat and we started to breath I felt everything rushing out of me. And it wouldnt stop. And I wouldnt stop. I kept going and cried through each pose.

"(22/365) today i&#39;m renewing my practice (or my approach to my practice anyway). i started yoga because i wanted to feel better, and it allowed me to slow down when everything was going a bit too fast. but a lot of the time with life being the way it is, it&#39;s easy to just do it to check it off the to do list (or sometimes skip it altogether), but moving forward i want to try to practice with more intention and consciousness, and try to feel better even off the mat :)",honey Blue,2021-02-13T01:51:14Z,0

"This daily practice for me, was all about finding power within myself over my body and my emotions. I sought to find peace in the craziness of life. I have been able to find such wonderfulness, but it took more effort on my part than I expected. I have now found that it is about learning to listen with love. As I learn to lovingly listen to what my body needs and have the strength and care to make those little (or even big) adjustments for myself, I have found a greater capacity to listen with love to those around me. I also watched the first Star Wars movie in the original trilogy for the first time ever (I had not seen any of them!) and I have totally found The Force Within Me because of this daily practice. Awesome haha!",Valaya Hart,2021-02-06T17:11:13Z,2

"Day 22: It is <i>incredible</i> how much better everything goes when I have actual traction between my feet and the floor.<br /><br />Yoga, in general, works so much better when it&#39;s not a fight.  And so often it is a fight: fighting my own tiredness and executive function to get to the mat in the first place, fighting my own brain to focus and not get too frustrated when there&#39;s something I can&#39;t do right away, fighting my own body to try and get it to move right.  Fighting my feet and my balance and my pose and my slippery living room rug to stay upright in Warrior or Star Pose.  And I <i>can</i> fight, and I can even win sometimes, and I gain something when I do, strength and stubbornness and workout, but--god, how much better it all is when it&#39;s not a fight at all.<br /><br />I think, more than anything, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been discovering this journey.  &#39;Renew&#39; is a good theme for today, when I&#39;m remembering my intention from day one, which was never to be very very good at this, but only to keep coming back and keep trying.  I think I thought, on January 1st, that that meant trying harder the next day when I&#39;d lost the fight, as I inevitably sometimes would.  I think now maybe it means learning to back down, back away, pause and come back and renew when I find the direction things don&#39;t have to be a fight from to begin with.<br /><br />It means previewing the videos so I know what poses I&#39;m in for and don&#39;t have to struggle to figure them out mid-practice.  It means rolling the rug back or buying a yoga mat so my feet actually stick to the floor instead of trying to stay upright purely with thigh strength and determination.  It means jumping on the moment in the middle of the morning when my body <i>wants</i> to get up and move, rather than forcing it.  Some days it means no yoga at all, and some days it means coming back and being more proud and satisfied with that than guilty.<br /><br />Eight more days to this sequence.  Maybe I&#39;ll go back and try &#39;Home&#39; again when this is done.  Maybe I&#39;ll move on to something else.  I&#39;ll keep going.",Clarity C,2021-02-04T16:53:57Z,2

"&quot;Allow, release and let go&quot;. My mom tested positive for Covid recently and my thoughts have been a wreck. From sleepless nights to constant nightmares. Hearing this phrase from Adriene, immediately I felt more in control and I could feel myself wedging out of fear&#39;s foot after being trapped underneath for so long. Than straight away I can feel myself inviting fear out the door, and it just walked away. Thanks Adriene! I guess why I&#39;m here is to be better, both physically and mentally and to take better control of my emotional wellbeing.",Mallory Dominic,2021-01-28T09:44:28Z,12

"I started the month off so well, then about a week and a half ago I started to lose focus and fell into a really negative place. This grey Canadian winter, especially with this current lockdown, has taken a massive toll on me physically and emotionally. I missed a few days of yoga and screwed up my month of clean eating and just spiralled. Every couple days I would try for the motivation to show up on the mat and catch up on the missed videos, some days I would do two or three videos back to back but never seemed to catch up. Today I found myself 5 days behind on this challenge. I am struggling to be better than my negative thoughts. I have a test tomorrow that I barely had the concentration to study for today. But I just completed day 22, so I&#39;m going to be grateful for that small win and remind myself that in 10hrs I will wake up to a new day and can try again. Day 23 is the new Day 27, right?!",alisondawnsmith,2021-01-28T00:15:13Z,1
"Definitely! It&#39;s okay to not be okay. Keep showing up, girl. You can do it. I &quot;fell behind&quot; due to a muscle injury and I thought about doing multiple videos a day to &quot;catch up&quot;, but I decided to keep doing it one day at a time to really enjoy it and not stress out, since the intention for me is to enjoy this journey. In the end it doesn&#39;t really matter, if we are a couple of days behind, does it? The most important thing is to show up and do something for yourself.",Alex Lemke,2021-01-28T21:15:07Z,1

I went to bed last night with a really cluttered pre pms brain that started making me doubt my life choices and it became so overwhelming. I slept just fine but I woke up feeling really heavy and didn&#39;t have the urge to go on my mat. Something convinced me to just do a shorter practice today to accomplish my morning routine in full and I was able to unwind and breathe fuller throughout and I feel a bit better now. I think I was pulled in so I wouldn&#39;t give into my head thoughts that aren&#39;t real for the remainder of the day. so thank you for these positive comments in this thread and it sure as heck helped me this morning.,Nora Shvartsberg,2021-01-26T13:41:12Z,0

This was so magically what I needed. I‚Äôve recently discovered I have piriformis syndrome. I have some exercises that are helping but would love to have a yoga routine that helps with this.

When reading the next three practices were a &#39;trifecta&#39; I had to come back and makeup this session.  Im SO glad did!<br /><br />Doing this particular practice make me realize how far I have come on my strength and my relationship with  my breath.  It&#39;s SO exciting and empowering!  <br /><br />I&#39;m moving so much more fluid and holding positions for much longer.  I can breath deeply during twists and I  feel much more in control.  I didn&#39;t even have to move my covid belly out of the way like I did in the beginning.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite practices.

These practices are so good and they are a real treat for me. Don‚Äôt want to be a spoil sport but how is it an accomplishment to do a nice short and sweet yoga session everyday for 30 days? Makes me wonder how y‚Äôall deal with the real challenges in life... ?,Ann Bangert,2021-01-23T23:24:51Z,0
‚ÄúReal challenges‚Äù are the easy ones - they‚Äôre the ones we can‚Äôt ignore or refuse to engage with. But committing to self care is optional - it‚Äôs a choice that we have to re-commit to daily. And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs hard.,Amy M Simoneau,2021-01-24T00:17:54Z,1
"I hope you don&#39;t mind if I share my perspective on this one. I think it&#39;s because of the &quot;real challenges&quot; in life that committing to something like this is a big accomplishment for many people, including me. The world is full of work, sickness, commitments to other people, stressors good and bad. Honestly, this is the first time I have stuck with something like this on a daily basis even though I intellectually understood in the past that it wasn&#39;t a massive time commitment. It&#39;s great that it feels easy for you--and now that I&#39;m in the habit it feels easier for me than it used to--but I wouldn&#39;t use people&#39;s ability to commit to yoga practice as a gauge for how they handle their problems.",Kathleen Jones,2021-01-23T23:45:47Z,0

Also trying conscious breath when I‚Äôm in the bus, at class, whenever, and being really helpful. Thanks Adrienne for this amazing journey.",sookierory,2021-01-23T19:03:12Z,0

"Had some bad family news this morning and I was afraid that I wasn&#39;t in the right space for the idea of renewal. But I got on the mat anyway and found a place to reconnect to myself and recognize the few things that I have control of- my breath, the way I treat myself and my loved ones, and my acceptance of the things outside of my control. While renewal didn&#39;t connect with my family&#39;s situation, it did connect with how I can approach the world and address my emotions. Thank you for reminding me that hard times aren&#39;t forever and there is still purpose to trying to be a functional human being. A little glimmer of hope is so important right now, not just for me. Hope everyone else had a reflective and supportive practice as well. &lt;3",Avi,2021-01-23T18:30:47Z,0

It&#39;s crazy how no matter what you&#39;re struggling with there is always something each of us can find as an answer or as peace on the mat. Even though the practice is the same it is not the same outcome for each person participating. Its a beautiful idea that everyone can come and do the same thing but come out with different renewals.

"Today was my favourite practice so far. So many things fell into place. I‚Äôve been doing YWA for two years now,, Yoga on and off before that for  a few years but today when Adriene said ‚ÄòMaybe you just stand there saying - Everything is so integrated, I got this‚Äô that was exactly how I felt. After all those years everything DID feel integrated. There were a few poses in this practice that were impossible or very difficult when I started like stacking the hips in down dog or humble warrior or grabbing my foot during the twist and now they come easy and my movements have a bit of fluidity to them. So to everyone out there struggling thinking ‚ÄòI will never get this‚Äô you will in time. <br />And a big thanks to Adriene for gifting me with the poems of Mary Oliver. I had never heard of her before they appeared at the end of some emails and I love them. It‚Äôs the first time poetry connected with me. I was quite surprised.

"Another great practice! I was a bit scatterbrained and distracted for part of it, especially the first triangle and supine twist, confusing left and right, but I got it for the other side each time and it was much better :D I also managed to touch the floor with my fingertips on the second triangle pose, which is a great win! I&#39;ll have to try this practice again (I&#39;ll most probably start Breath all over again in February anyway), but it was already greatly beneficial and a lovely way to renew my commitment to this daily practice. I look forward to discovering the next two. See you all tomorrow!",Marion Carminelitta,2021-01-23T11:33:40Z,0
"Renew has many meanings. The core of the  saying &quot;each day is new day&quot; is hard to grasp and embody. <br />Today, dear Adriene, you showed how to physicaly feel what it means to renew, it doen&#39;t hav to be something we whisper quietly in our heart, it can be loud, bright and flamboyant .<br /> It all starts with little things , piling up one on top of the other. Each day is a new opportunity to renew something, we don&#39;t have to wait till we lose all passion .<br />Every single moment is an opportunity to start again, no need to wait until the end.<br />&quot;Thank you&quot; is the first thing runing through my brainn when I think of you! <br />From my heart to everybody&#39;s heart, have a wonderful day. Your new start is whenever you decide it to be.<br />Keep calm and breath.",Nana,2021-01-23T11:33:23Z,0

"Absolutely loving this 30 day Yoga course.  I have NEVER managed to stick with it to the end when I have attempted your courses before (guess being ‚Äúlocked down‚Äù helps?!). I am now beginning to understand why it‚Äôs a 30 day course.  It‚Äôs all CONNECTED.  I have had trouble sleeping and have tried everything - avoiding caffeine, alcohol, screens, etc, but I have usually been waking at 2am and restless until the early morning.  Then SUDDENLY after day 20, I am sleeping SO much more soundly.  The only thing I have changed is sticking to this daily course, and so I am going with that, and will definitely be looking to continue when this amazing experience ends in only another 8 days.

I need to remind myself why I started university, why I&#39;m getting this degree and why I have to keep pushing. The yoga practice with you is teaching me to take a breath and stay strong, phisically and mentally, and sometimes even to take a break too to reconnect with myself and my purpose. Also, it allows me to throw my attention, at least for half an hour, from the negative things that are happening in Italy because of this pandemic.

"My why is that I needed something to hold onto through January, which I knew would be a difficult time due to a lockdown with no clear end. I wanted a wholesome distraction. The yoga has given me that and more. The breathing exercises have led to real moments of peace (no mean feat!) and the positions and movements are wonderfully grounding. I&#39;ve come to treasure the daily practice.",Eleanor H,2021-01-23T19:37:51Z,2
"My why? Because I&#39;m learning to recognise how my mind, breath and body movements are connected.  As I get stronger, steadier more balanced, thinking about how I move makes me more aware, in control and confident.  The focus on breathing into the poses and out for release is helping me co-ordinate flow.  It feels really good!  Thank you, I enjoyed taking a moment for your invitation to pause, consider and reflect :) &lt;3",gipsi,2021-01-23T11:30:04Z,1
