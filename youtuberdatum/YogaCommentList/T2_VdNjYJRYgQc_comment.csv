"Ooh Adriene ! Since enjoying this awesome practice in September, the second lockdown here in England has had a negative effect on this senior yogi, so I had to do a little adjusting to see me through,  but I so loved the ‘ little bit of everything ‘ of this sequence, it was a fun party, slow and kind. Feeling the love Adriene 💕, see you tomorrow on the mat 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💕",Gill Smith,2020-12-12T09:26:16Z,4
"@Gill Smith I so appreciate your advice! Today I was feeling very 😞, and I was going to use this plan of doing the morning yoga for beginners. It did get me on the mat! I saw that it was a 14 min practice today (Truth), read your comments to see if I needed to modify, and did the practice. I did a foot massage too. 💓 Gardening is such tough work. I am always amazed how people can do it and apply their knowledge of plants like that. It is such a gift 🌱",Laura Reed,2020-12-17T17:35:05Z,1
"So important not to injure yourself Laura ! I have paid the price next day, by going a step too far in a challenging practice and learned to ease off when body tells me. Also after some what I call extreme gardening in the summer, I twinged my back digging out a large bush. But Adriene always comes to my rescue with a relevant practice to correct my injury. There’s always “Yoga for ..... “ if I search 😊 often if I’m feeling 😐 I just do Morning Yoga for Beginners or Gentle, Relaxing, Cozy Flow. This way I can never miss my daily yoga which so helps my mental state and keeps me positive. It’s been a shocking year ! See you on mat Laura 🧘🏼‍♀️😊🙏💕",Gill Smith,2020-12-15T13:59:59Z,1
@Gill Smith I love those ideas! I will join you in those child’s pose and neck circles. If I do too much like an extended vinyasa flow or side planks Are usually hurt myself and end up not being able to do yoga for maybe even a month while I’m healing. I so appreciate your response!,Laura Reed,2020-12-15T12:58:26Z,1
"Yes Laura, I enjoy the more physical practices to keep me fit but sometimes things like side planks and fast vinyasa flows become a little too much, especially with my arthritis. So instead of feeling in despair, I accept my edge and miss out some vinyasas, go to child’s pose, relax, then meet back up in downward dog. I also do useful neck and shoulder circles and breathe deep when moves get tough, so relaxing, then join back in with the sequence. That keeps it fun😊 hope this helps 🧘🏼‍♀️😃💕",Gill Smith,2020-12-13T16:14:34Z,1
Could you post what are you do that helps a practice feels like too much? Like if there is an a modification that is described? Thank you!,Laura Reed,2020-12-13T13:47:59Z,1

"This is Bill’s wife Debbie. I could see a beautiful monarch on one of my flowers through my front window. She was my focal point for a long period. She was there so long flapping her wings slowly I started really worrying she may be in trouble. The beautiful butterfly must have stayed for 20 minutes! Finally, after worrying about her, she flew away toward the end of practice. I’m really having a hard time with what’s going on in the US and rest of the world. I know she was a gift from G-d, Brahman, Jesus, the Universe; whatever you call Spirit. Thank you Adrienne, my other blessing from G-d from Brahman. These blessings keep me holding on 🙏❤️☮️🦮🦋🧘🏻‍♀️",Bill Will,2020-11-08T20:12:37Z,0

"Hey Adrienne! First of all, I love your yoga workouts and your personality! :)<br />I would love to do more yoga, but I always feel insecure about my form since my posture is so terrible. It’s not my shoulders but rather my neck which looks basically like the one of a turtle. Even if I try really hard and stand in front of a wall, my neck won’t go into its natural position. I was wondering if you could make a video on this - since this forward head posture is something pretty common nowadays due to us sitting so much in front of our Handys or laptops... <br />It would mean a lot to me if you could make a yoga workout especially for this issue which I could then do every day before school or if you could simply give me some tips on how to change my posture when simply trying to stand up straight and bring my head back isn’t really possible anymore...<br /><br />Greetings from Germany! :)<br />Paula",P 21,2020-10-15T13:04:00Z,0

Our sage sages derive their enlightenment and dimension from this mudra. Meditation posture reduces headache. The power to pay attention increases. Memory increases. Nature is calm.

I am pretty new to your channel, I have been practicing at LEAST 3 times a week for one month and I wanted to share with you my progress and thank you SO much for sharing your wonderful energy! Not only have I lost TWENTY pounds (with the help of diet) but everyday I start with yoga makes everything else fall into place, doing errands or going to work is easier.

"This was my first yoga practice with Adriene and I really enjoyed it. My friend recommended this channel to me about a year ago but I wasn&#39;t really interested in yoga back then other than using it for flexibility &amp; stretching purposes. Ever since I had a depressive episode back in May 2020, I&#39;ve felt extremely drawn to Yoga. High intensity workouts and jumping have begun to feel like such a chore, Yoga helps me feel centered and grounded especially on difficult days. Now I&#39;ve been practicing Yoga on a daily basis and it&#39;s helped me physically, mentally and emotionally. I look forward to more classes with Adriene &amp; Benji, Thanks 🙏🏼💜",Bhavna Rasaily,2020-09-21T05:13:32Z,2

We have been doing yoga exercise every single day since March 17, 2020 since COVID Lockdown started in Canada. You have been our greatest inspiration. We  stretched, down-dogged, twisted, laughes and cried with you everyday. We cannot thank you enough for helping us getting through this weird and hard time for everyone.

Hi Adriene  I love your yoga channel so much! I am wishing for the discipline to do it every day as it really actually does help! My son also will do it with me occasionally (he’s 6 and resists other exercise videos!) Do you plan on doing any more kids yoga vids? <br />I want to share an observation with a suggestion (sounding scary even to me!) I share your channel A LOT! And each time I share it I notice the picture that comes up is that gorgeous one of you in black with white background. I’ve now had enough people tell me the same thing that I thought maybe I should tell you! That they see it and think oh it must be advanced yoga and then they don’t try it! Which is so sad to me and annoying cause I know how helpful your channel is for me and the friends of mine who follow you. I Often I just go ok chill Chrystal in their own time they’ll find yoga etc etc but anyway I just thought cause it was said to me again today that I would share that with you and suggest maybe mixing up the cover photo to something more relatable...like what your channel actually is once we click in! It’s all SO beautiful and light and welcoming and pet-loving and plants and relaxing loveliness for people who need that the most perhaps. Thank you for your time and energy in the channel. I adore it! ❤️👌🏼💫🌟🌏🙏🏼,Chrystal Lynch,2020-09-10T00:26:40Z,0

"Oh Adriene, I always think that I don’t have enough time for yoga, that I don’t have the energy, that my heart is too heavy. But I’m always proven wrong. I just got back from a lovely time away from home surrounded by love. Was immediately thrown in to all the stress of family, of school, of life and I felt so overwhelmed and upset. Nearly crying, I felt so isolated. But I continued on with the BUILD playlist, which brought me to this video. I feel so light and happy, as though I can kick major ass and that maybe life isn’t so serious. Thank you for an amazing practice❤️❤️❤️",Jenin Ahmad,2020-09-08T05:50:05Z,0

"whassuuuuuuuuup yoga party people!!!!! <br /><br />I am so blessed to be a part of this whole crazy YWA thing it&#39;s just.. unexpressable, I think<br /><br />I did this one with some hang drum beats in the bg and it was a rather ethereal party sensation, with feelings of gratitude and just... some pure feeling, idk... I&#39;ve also noticed a change in my attitude towards KOHD recently, and today was the day I was right out beaming, as my breath synchronized with my hands slapping my sides..... : &#39; D <br /> <br />Haven&#39;t been on the calendar recently, good to pop in!

"I wasn’t feeling much like yoga today (and definitely didn’t feel like a party), as I’m grieving my two high school choir teachers, a husband and wife team and a source of great encouragement for me. She died a month ago from cancer, and he died yesterday from Covid. I’ve been feeling numb all day, still trying to process her death and reeling from his. During knocking on heaven’s door, I started to weep. It’s like it wrung the grief and numbness and finally allowed me a bit of release. Thank you for that gift.",Jamie Kocur,2020-09-06T21:53:24Z,0
Adriene you have been a blessing with your videos. This is my second time doing yoga for 30 days. The first time I did I cried because it was a journey for me. Thank you so much.

Feeling kinda isolated on my big 5-0 bday weekend here in Los Angeles with the over 110 unheard of temps and my tween &amp; teen that refuse to head to the coast, albeit they&#39;re the smart ones considering the pandemic. Happy to note that I started this practice at 51, 189 &amp; finished at 53,659. It is fun to see that I was partying with 2,470 people, so thank you all! Also will just keep reminding myself I&#39;ll be 50 all year and look forward to the days to come when we can once again head out to the beach and only be concerned with the traffic on the freeways. Funny how easily perspective can change, In the meantime, here&#39;s to couch surfing at its finest...or maybe I will just pack up the board and go for a solo trip.",Nessa Roffredo,2020-09-06T18:10:26Z,0

hi adriene! i&#39;m not sure if you answer comments but i&#39;m going to try: I have a really tense and inflexible lower back. i love yoga but i get very uncouraged because i can&#39;t i.e bend down with my back straight and stuff. do you have any tips for a very inflexible lower back?,Heta,2020-09-06T12:14:02Z,0

@Lucille Sanders thank you so much Lucille! this was very helpful and i already found some great videos to try out. thank you &amp; take care love xx,Heta,2020-09-07T13:37:12Z,0
"Hi Heta. Either on You Tube or Adriene&#39;s website, in search, type lower back. Possibly alternate any lower back videos with other practices. Also, search hips, as Adriene teaches that often tightness in hips affects the back. And as Adriene would say, be gentle, do not force the stretch and breathe deeply into your lower back....feeling it expand even a tiny bit with the breath. I just did one of her videos where she is in the basic seated posture. She reminded us that if you watch some of her earliest videos from 8 years ago, when in seated position her hips were so tight her knees were no where near the floor. She herself has slowly become more flexible while teaching. I hope this helps a bit, as Adriene says they get so many comments they can&#39;t really respond to all. Be gentle with yourself. Be safe. Enjoy all that your body is doing for you. Take care. Lucille",Lucille Sanders,2020-09-06T13:43:23Z,0
