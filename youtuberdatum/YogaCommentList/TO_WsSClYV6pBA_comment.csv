THANKYOU Adrienne. A month’s lockdown has just been announced and I am having a very grey day. But I feel so much better having focused on just the yoga.

"Thank you Adriene for sharing with us so insightful tools. Every practice pushes us forward physically and spiritually towards our best selves. Today I broke down into tears at the idea of surrendering and letting myself being hold, so that I had to question my thoughts on trusting and allowing others to help me throughout my journey. Every practice you put out takes us closer to our higher self.

"I never comment on these, but I always find reading others so heartwarming and inspirational- and today I had that &quot;a ha&quot; moment.  Between the pressures of the pandemic, my personal life, and the general state of society I have been trying to consistently do YWA daily to varying successful attempts. This morning I woke up with increased dread after the supreme court confirmation, and had a hard time motivating myself that a positive future is out there. But nevertheless, I was going to make myself to the today&#39;s practice. Against my own expectations I ended the practice ready to take on the day, and create any little effort I can towards the future I want for myself even if this world wants to take them down. I so often don&#39;t notice that little change, but it was extremely prevalent and necessary today, so thank you so so much, Adrienne &lt;3",Anna Hibbert,2020-10-27T14:00:20Z,3

Ok so my gym sent me a link to a free yoga session via you tube for lockdown. Never having been to one of the classes when the gym was open I thought I’d see what it was like. I switched it off after 10 mins as there was no warmth or connection. YWA is the best!!!!!!,Jules Thomas,2020-04-23T07:26:25Z,0

"The power of yoga is incredible. I loved this practice, even though it was a little bit difficult to maintain the plank pose and the downward facing dog position; it&#39;s probably because I&#39;ve done softer practices in the past two weeks and my body needs to get used to these poses again.<br />At the end of the practice, I could feel a lovely sensation of warmth. <br />P.S.

"Myself and friends enjoy your yoga videos and relaxed, open, accessible teaching. The only negative/constructive criticism that puts us off, is when you attempt comedy. I&#39;m English, my friends different nationalities, but we all have particular comical tendencies. We come to your videos for the quality and nice nature of your classes, but your jokes distract all of us from the process. So we&#39;re left in a predicament, we find your classes the best, but also irritating and distracting when you break into a song or attempt a joke. Maybe some people like it, fair enough, but for us, we come for the yoga which leaves us all in a predicament and choice to make. Not a complaint, just an opinion, and constructive criticism.",tom port,2020-03-22T21:46:55Z,0

Im glad i found your channel and im greatful for your videos! I wanted to ask you if you can make some videos that exclude some body parts completely. For example a wrist free one or one without any pressure on the knees etc. I have a friend that cannot do any of your tutorials because she has super sensive knees and hurts a lot even with a blanket underneath during table top position. And i hurt a lot my wrist during practice and now i feel that i shouldnt do anything even if i want to... 😞,Melina Nalmpanti,2019-12-18T14:53:58Z,0

"I wanted to express my gratitude. Seven years ago God, Tao, Source, whichever it is to you spoke to me. I am the reincarnation of Joan of Arc, I am here to start The Great Awakening. <br />When I realized I was an empath immediately hints of the fact that I had to learn Yoga came gently at first, as I couldn&#39;t stand yoga, which is hysterical as I have been a Yogi in many lifetimes. Then it became apparent that I had no choice. I don&#39;t like to go to Yoga places, the last time I went to a Siddha Yoga Center the women went nuts, exclaiming things like &quot;She is the one&quot;, &quot;She is the real deal&quot;. When this happened I didn&#39;t even know I was an empath, lol. Your videos are great! Easy to follow, and I love that you explain everything, why your bones must be stacked, etc... Benji is such a good dog, I had an Australian Cattle dog once also, they are so smart. I have asked God to send you a blessing, thank you for all you do and for being my gateway into Yoga, and I am happy to report that I don&#39;t hate it as much as I though I would, lol, and I am sure I will learn to love it.",Life of an empath by Cristina Litvin,2019-12-17T15:51:29Z,0

"I’m trying this 30 day challenge with openness even though vinyasa isn’t my usual method of practice. Her class is pretty good. She explains the beginning seat well except I wish her visual of herself in Sukhasana matched her words better. It seems like Adriene would benefit from sitting on a height to help her own knees come down. She has a long torso, yes but her knees look hiked up to me...her feet are under the shins (the visual is clear in front of us) as she tells us to bring the feet out and under the knees I think...? Just something I noticed after finishing my first teacher training journey. Otherwise her class is pretty good...reminds me of being in a kids yoga class almost (a good thing). 😅👍",Danielle Deutsch,2019-10-07T17:12:57Z,0

"This was very hard for me. I did this journey when it was first released in January, just over a week when my paternal grandmother had died and going into the first year death anniversary of  maternal grandmother in February. <br /><br />I couldn’t do all of dedicate due to being swamped by grief, so I’m returning to it now and having flashbacks of earlier this year so I had to take a break 20 mins in and then return for only 9 mins. I’ve not finished it, I did collapse at one point. <br /><br />What was interesting to me as well is that both palm mounds hurt a lot whenever I placed pressure on them. In acupressure there’s a point in that mound that associated with the lungs and the lungs are associated with grief or loss.  <br /><br /><b>sigh</b> I’ll try and finish tomorrow’s practice, I just want to curl up in a ball atm 😔",Cairistiona O’Loughlin,2019-08-25T18:08:59Z,0

Loving this 30 day challenge! Does anyone have any advice on wrist pain? Doing table top and cat cow and then any other movement when putting weight on my wrists the underside hurts so much I have to stop - which is so frustrating as the rest of my body wants to carry on haha. <br /><br /><br />Any advice would be appreciated :) I shall keep trying<br /><br /><br />x,Natasha Boon,2019-07-12T09:54:30Z,0

"I came across this a few months ago and have been meaning to try it out. I did Day One with little trouble, aside from pain in my wrists. Unfortunately, I found this day to be a little too hard and had to stop at about the 25-minute mark. I&#39;m fairly new to yoga, only a couple months of practicing on my own, and I so wish I could do this stuff. It was so disappointing that this Dedicate series might be beyond my capability right now.",Transcending Together,2019-07-07T20:30:39Z,0
"Thank you for the calming and relaxing atmosphere that you create in your videos! I feel so comfortable with the exercises and thank you for reminding me that even though I&#39;m new to the yoga practice, there are many others watching the same video, going through the same practice with me.  it makes me feel a part of something bigger.",Michelle Janse van Rensburg,2019-07-07T19:43:34Z,0

"I woke up late this morning and didn&#39;t have time to practice so I came home determined to finish the day with Day 2. I wasn&#39;t sure how the energy would be different since I always practice in the early morning. Would I be worn out? Will I get too worked up to rest? <br /><br /><br />And I have to say, I feel positively invigorated! There was more levity, I was more forgiving of myself, even my dogs were helping. What a great way to close the day. Namaste everybody.",Ast,2019-07-03T01:28:11Z,0

You might not read this but I’m not sure what to do with a lot of the poses and transitions... I am plus size and my stomach is hard and gets in the way and I was unable to fully do any of the positions that involved my knees close to my chest or the lunge with hands on the ground which was a good portion of the day today. Any advice for upcoming videos on how to modify or should I just do whatever I can get get my body in the position? Thanks :D,R B,2019-06-06T14:00:19Z,1
"Adriene we love you been doing yoga with you for 30 days straight.  we recently tried your 30 day yoga and my only comment is: STOP TALKING, PLEASE.  the 40 minute video is really a 15 minute workout with 30 minutes of you talking.

"This is day two for me and I&#39;m feeling a type of calm I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever felt before. I&#39;m currently at university all day 4 days a week and I&#39;ve recently had a flare-up in my anxiety and depression. All of these stresses had me resisting yoga, saying it would just give me room to spiral and get stuck ruminating over anything and everything my mind could latch onto. But despite being time poor, I&#39;ve decided to make time for myself and despite the fact that I&#39;m still confused about one of my assignments, I&#39;ve never felt this at ease",Georgia Hore,2019-05-07T23:54:30Z,0

"I&#39;ve had the most enlightening and wonderful experience with this. Just as the practice was drawing to a close, I lay down on the mat and felt this sudden burst of warmth and cosiness. It felt as though in that very moment I managed to reconnect with myself on a spiritual level, and I could actually feel the gratitude towards myself for trying to incorporate more acts of pure self-love into my life. I&#39;ve spent many years being strict and condemning myself, all the while ignoring my own voice. I started bawling my eyes out on the mat, but it was magical and so relieving. I&#39;d read about other people having to cry after practice, but only now I fully understand. I&#39;m slowly tearing down the wall between my body and my mind. Thanks Adriene xx",Lukas Kieviet,2019-05-01T08:19:48Z,107

"Wow we really kicked it up a notch today! I found myself mostly doing the less intensive versions of each pose because I have a disability and anything close to exercise yoga is too much for me. But I wanted to say I loved this, and I really appreciate how open you are to people of all abilities and consistently give options to those of us who can not physically hold a difficult pose (like a plank) for a long period of time. I feel fully stretched and worked out and ready for the day, but not like I pushed myself to the point where I&#39;ll be in pain for days after. Thank you very much Adriene, you have been such a huge help to me. Namaste.",Faylen,2019-04-28T14:53:51Z,3

"Have just found Adriene, so inspiring. I am onto day 3 tomorrow and actually look forward to doing it. I am shocked at what l am able to achieve with her in the sessions. Who would have thought l couldn’t even cross my legs and now l can do a downward dog, not as lovely as Adriene but maybe one day l will be that gracious. Thank you so much and love from Australia.",mel mil,2019-03-10T04:46:46Z,0
"Hello Adriene, I first want to say Thank you so much for these videos you have truly transformed my body and mind connection. I wanted to check with you if i&#39;m doing my downward dog right as my heels don&#39;t touch the ground so in turn my arm sometimes shakes and i feel a strain in my neck. I can&#39;t touch my toes yet but i&#39;m getting closer everyday..would my heels touching require practise or am i doing something wrong? Thank you xX",Jasmin ramadan,2019-03-09T11:53:14Z,1

"I am new to yoga.  I did the 30 day series and am now repeating it,  getting a better understanding and improving my awareness this second time around.  I am a dressage rider, and my horse is about 250 miles south of me for the winter for additional training and physical conditioning.  The weather these past three weeks in the midwest made it impossible for me to do my weekly drive to ride my horse. I was able to get down there 2 days ago and my trainer commented on how much stronger my core and shoulders were during my lesson.  I had thought that the Dedicate series was helping me to be more flexible,  but now I realize how it is actually making me stronger throughout my body and is truly helping me to be a better partner for my horse.

"Your positivity and focus on self-compassion is such a light. I&#39;m an adult Irish dancer who&#39;s currently figuring out how to navigate a foot surgery that took away some mobility and strength, potential shin and hip issues, and the fear of even more debilitating injuries that has sprung up alongside these problems... not to mention the weight gain that has come from being inactive; I&#39;ve put on about 15-20 pounds, and though I&#39;m not overweight, I can definitely feel the restrictions of my new proportions. I haven&#39;t felt like my old dancerly self in almost two years, and it&#39;s been extremely discouraging feeling like I&#39;ve been shut out of not only dance, but any activity with any degree of impact. I started to forget that even a little exercise is better than none, and that it&#39;s ok -- necessary, even -- to work within my current limitations rather than waiting for them to go away and then jumping back into intense dance training. It&#39;s only day 2, but this series is already serving as a pretty powerful reminder that all is not lost, and I&#39;m extremely grateful to you for that.",ramywiles,2019-02-01T18:32:57Z,0

"What I did, ( and still do sometimes) is to simply watch first and observe, then try it (rewind the vid) and adjust as you go, as Adriene says, to find what feels good to you. It doesn&#39;t have to be pretty and perfect. It may seem silly to stop everytime she&#39;s talking about a new pose but eventually it will all just click. I hope my perspective helps you in some way.",Sophi23,2019-01-26T09:33:36Z,0

"Been so long since I&#39;ve been exercising... so out of shape... circulation was being cut off in right fingers doing planks and downward dogs yesterday, so I didn&#39;t want to do them long, trying everything with my right arm, rotation, pressing, everything! Then realized that it was actually just my left that I needed to press into more, and lighten and softer my right more, and that worked great... opposite thing! It&#39;s funny how often trying the opposite thing that what seems intuitive works so well!

I am so disappointed and sad and angry, I just see fat everywhere on my body, it doesn&#39;t allow me to move like I want and even these positions are so difficult now :( I was never into this stuff about connecting body to mind and so on, but today I  felt that I need it!!

"Finishing High School this year and integrating Yoga into my daily routine to remind myself to take time for m y s e l f. I turn my phone off and disconnect from the world (especially social media!) and connect with myself for at least an hour through Adriene&#39;s Yoga Practices and every time I learn something new; absolutely addicted and in love with Yoga and cannot ever imagine quitting now that I&#39;ve started. <br />Best Part is: I used to be super unflexibel and I did Pole Dance for a while which really helped, though in my mind I still think I&#39;m quite inflexible but then I get into Yoga Poses and surprise myself. Definitely finding confidence in my body and trust in my abilities as well. <br />Okay, that&#39;s all I have to say. Have a nice day &amp; keep on spreading Love.

"This is my Day 2 (the second Sunday) I felt so tired after waking up but I have to do yoga every Sunday (like I want to :P) because I have been busy on weekdays like other students do, so I needed some space for my mind. This time I understood yoga postures more than my first Sunday, I felt so good while doing it. Btw, thank you for this journey, it’s great for a busy person like me so much. Namaste 🙏 💕",Primrose,2019-01-12T23:39:12Z,3

This makes me feel so much better and makes me feel like I am getting a workout without the pain my 48 yr old body sometimes feels with the other training. Anyway, thanks for sharing.

"Really enjoyed day one an was feeling excite to move forward through the 30 day journey, but I was completely lost going into the twenty minute mark. I appreciate the repetitive us of the pose names, yet I found them interfering with keeping track of the movements. As a beginner (which you expressed this series was directed toward in the first video) I am far less interested in the pose names and more focused on completing the movements without constantly needing to watch the screen. I wish you all luck, but I will search for a a series that is focus on the movement and not the names.",SanDiegotoStLouisR1,2019-01-09T14:48:40Z,0

Your energy is beautiful, thank you for sharing your knowledge and love with us all. I have one question... I cannot sit up straight if my legs are stretched out in front of me. Should I be doing all the exercises where the legs are out in front with my legs actually bent so that my spine can be straight? Or should I have straight legs and bent spine but push it to be as straight as possible?",Sentia Corpa,2019-01-09T08:33:40Z,0

I&#39;ve loved and enjoyed your series for many years Adriene, but did so quietly. Today I am older, wiser and even more grateful. With the intention of gratitude for this year ahead, I wanted to take my time out today and say thank you. You mentioned if someone was a yogi practicing for more than 20 years, they would fine nourishment just as I had done. I am turning 21 soon and at the same time coming close to a five year practice with you, and I wholeheartedly look forward to practicing with you in the near and far future.

"Hello and thank you Adriene.  Yesterday I started with my second round of 30 days, having found 30 days of yoga from 4 years ago first. I know, I&#39;m a bit late to the mat, but I have to say, I&#39;ve never gone 30 days in a row of anything on my own. In the past I&#39;ve hired personal trainers at the gym to keep me accountable, but even that didn&#39;t stick for very long. I&#39;ve always wondered if yoga was a better option for me since I was constantly in fight mode (stressed all the time). I&#39;m so excited to hit the mat every morning now that my hubby laughs at night when I recheck the video for the next day. I know you&#39;ve heard so many thank yous, but here&#39;s one more, thank you from the bottom of my foundation - you have taught me an undeniable strength in me. Looking forward to these 30 and beyond. <br />Much love, and namaste from France<br />Bisous",Cave de la Lune,2019-01-08T08:11:21Z,0

"I&#39;ve said this before, but Adriene, you&#39;re a lifesaver. I&#39;m recovering from/learning to live with Bipolar Disorder and PTSD and the fact that you are always there for me, just by your videos existing, is so powerful. Yoga is becoming a part of my life now, and though it&#39;s not a magical cure-all activity, it is a space where I can be myself and exist with my body, and that would have been impossible two years ago. More and more often, my mat is a space where I can be free from intrusive thoughts and hallucinations and instead just breathe.

But I&#39;ll tell ya, even getting down into the final savasana was agony. I put a folded towel under my mat and that didn&#39;t help much.

"When I was 19 I went to 5 yoga classes a week and practiced at home. I did this on and off for about 4 years and over the past 2 years I’ve only practiced every so often. <br />But I remembered how I used to feel, it would uplift my mood, bring me peace and happiness, and I remember being able to wake up in the morning with ease.<br />Yesterday I decided to search yoga on YouTube since I can’t afford yoga classes anymore. And I saw your series and thought it was just for beginners. But I’M not a beginner (I thought to myself). But then I realized how long it’s been since I’ve built up my foundation, my breath, my posture, my conscious mind. <br />And wow, it really humbled me. This practice is not only great for beginners but wonderful for intermediate and advanced as well. And especially for those looking to find time and a love for their practice again. I’m only on day two, but wow it brings me back to those wonderful calming endorphins I used to feel after a practice when I was 19.

I&#39;m from Italy and horrible things are happening: it seems that people have forgotten what means to be human, what means to exist together.<br />So this day 2, for me, becames also a reflection about what are the foundantios of humanity anche love.

"I lasted 26 minutes into this one. I honestly was gonna give up on it all together because I really couldn&#39;t do some of the positions. I decided to read the comments for motivation. I&#39;m adamant on sticking to this for 30 days. I&#39;ve always been one for holding myself to an impossible standard of perfection or nothing. Even though it&#39;s day two, I felt like I had to do all the moves instead of actually taking a step back and focusing on the connection of the heart mind body and soul. I&#39;m gonna stick at it until I&#39;m able to let go and just enjoy it and work with my body rather than pressurise myself with the much tiresome standard of perfection. Sure after 30 days I&#39;ll be in a better place than I started?",Goldacorn,2019-01-05T01:23:27Z,0

I am 62 and have followed you for years now and have enjoyed every minute!  I feel much better when I use 2 blocks for downward dog poses and many others.  The extra lift really works for me and I also use them in planks.  This might be a tip that older practitioners would want to try or maybe even a future video using more props?  Keep up the good work and please let me know your thoughts on using the blocks with some of these poses.,Beth Parks,2019-01-04T20:37:20Z,0

Also got a load of shoulder pain everytime I did yoga. <br /><br />I’m practicing on all fours getting the elbows forward, already I’m noticing a lot of improvement! I’m finally using my left arm muscles! <br /><br />I’m noticing that when I do downward dog they naturally turn inward, is this healthy?

Felt so disappointed that I may miss day 2, am one day behind, as felt pretty yuck BUT after a slow start I managed it albeit with tissue for Down Dog 😃. Great session which although I am still streaming made me feel SO much better both physically and mentally. Really great to be refocusing on some of the key points of Yoga which can so easily be given less attention. Never too experienced or practised to go back to basics, in fact just need to be even more patient to allow the process of going back to the beginning.

Such a great practice. I&#39;m a new mom and my new years focus is to create time and space for me to recharge. This 30 day program is a perfect reason to wake up 40 mins early and gently start my day focusing on my energy and strength building. Adrienne is a great instructor and I&#39;m impressed by how easy I can follow given my limited yoga experience:),Christy Lauzon,2019-01-04T06:44:27Z,0

"Okay, I don’t know why I keep letting the time of the video intimidate me, got such a late start because of that. I think it’s because I’m out of practice and I keep thinking if it’s too long I won’t be able to do it. I’m also out of shape because I fell off in my regular workouts as well for the last at least 2 months. I’m working hard to keep focused with the Yoga because it will get my head right to thinking more clearly and positive as I am facing some temporary stressful life stuff which makes me completely fall off everything that would help me to manage the stress. I’m trying so hard, I had a difficult time focusing at first and my body was a bit tense, but I loosened up a bit towards the 2nd half. If I can just struggle through the first two weeks I know I’ll get more flexibility and be more relaxed and focused and it won’t be as challenging. 😔",Jbutterfly15,2019-01-04T06:32:51Z,0

Feeling so good after this practice today. Felt a nice bit of heat during this session! But I am also struggling with learning to love my body. My belly and breasts often get in the way of some poses for me. Especially traditional child&#39;s pose. But learning to modify poses  for my body is helping me! Taking the knees wide during child&#39;s pose I have found works well for me to create more space.

I had started your 30 day challenge last year and I made it to day 24...that&#39;s when I discovered I had a very large tumor (non-cancerous) I waited nearly three months for a surgery because I needed more than one surgeon....it was large enough that it obstructed other organs and I was so glad that I had learned different yoga poses because that reduced much of the pain and pressure as I waited.  Thank you 💕 for being you, and for being funny, and for taking it to another level on day 1 😊.  I am mostly healed up now....to be truthful quite industructable.... and am able to do most of the poses albiet abdominal work is challenging.  I have invited all my nurses to join me as well.  Blessings to you and yours and Happy New Year!",Apricot Jalopeno,2019-01-04T03:02:56Z,0
"I really enjoy how so far Dedicate really takes the time to focus on breath and on the action of getting into poses.  I often have a hard time with poses, feeling like I am not doing them right because they feel uncomfortable or misaligned, so it&#39;s really helpful to have the slower explanations and focus on foundation and reminders to breathe (which i often forget) :-)",Em H,2019-01-04T03:00:42Z,0

"I spend a lot of my time devoted to others, as many of us do. Taking care of my friends and family emotionally and spending time with them when they don’t want to be alone (they all seem to have so much going on all the time). It doesn’t leave much time for me. Today’s practice helped me to remind myself to keep my foundation in yoga and in my life strong. I’m trying to prioritize self care and being at peace with giving myself time for emotional growth and accomplishing my own goals this year. I’m off track already. Ha! This practice helped remind me that if I don’t have my foundation in-line, the pose goes to crap. And the same is true for life and self care/goals. <br />Thank you for pouring your positive energy and goodness into us. It was much needed for me today, in a way I didn’t expect. 💗 May this comment and all the others pour some good energy back to you! Namaste 🙏🏼, Adriene",jbc103085,2019-01-04T02:25:58Z,1

I have tried so many different times to get into different yoga practices or different exercise regimes and tend to give up easy. Even yesterday I almost quit halfway through. Then with today&#39;s practice I wasn&#39;t ready to be done! Today something about this practice hit me and I just felt a light bulb go off and realized everything I&#39;m doing to better my life is building off the foundations of the hard years I&#39;ve had.

Today after 2 c sections and a heap of extra weight I&#39;m ready to reconnect to myself and regain some of that strength and flexibility! Things which were easy before really aren&#39;t now with a stiff spine and non existent core but this is where that decline is halted. Thank you so much for doing this, it really is wonderful to know you are participating with so many people all round the world 💗",Nancy Harvey-Kemper,2019-01-03T23:18:29Z,0

"Wow, this was amazing. I would have never guessed this would make me sweat so much just by looking through the video :) I find the deep, connected movement pretty intense - and so rewarding. I think I might have awakened some muscles in my lower belly that were asleep for a loong time, resisting attempts at rousing them, making (among other things) my return to bellydance so difficult. The movement now feels like I remember it, I hope this stays. Thank you, and I&#39;m looking forward to tomorrow.",Martina Den,2019-01-03T22:35:02Z,0

People who have the same/ a similar problem: do you practice yoga in the morning or at night? Cause for the first two days now, I did it at night, because I&#39;m scared, doing it in the morning, I would feel tired afterwards. On the other hand, maybe it&#39;ll help me start the day more relaxed and set the tone.<br />Do you have any advise for me?",jaymer,2019-01-03T21:52:52Z,0

"I have had a rocky relationship with yoga this past year as I had to break off my 30 days last January to fly home and be with my seriously ill mum in hospital. She sadly died a few weeks later and I really struggled with weight gain in the following months and couldn&#39;t practice yoga for the rest of 2018 as it was too raw and emotional. I started Dedicate yesterday after doing your &#39;Resolve to evolve&#39; meditation a few days ago and I am delighted at having finished the first two days despite being stiff and sore and having rolls of fat where I don&#39;t remember them being before.

This has been a problem in all group exercise classes I have ever done as well<br /><br />2) I am struggling to engage my lower abs and pelvic floor while also extending my tummy when breathing in as I find extension to not work well with flexing?<br /><br />Regardless, thank you for another wonderful day of practice!",Leo G,2019-01-03T21:38:41Z,0

"Dear Adriene, I&#39;ve been a student of yours for the last four years, and I look forward to the release of your 30day videos more than I do Christmas or new years eve. Finding your channel gave me access to yoga, which I&#39;d previously avoided because of the expense and the shame I felt in public classes (which completely disconnected me from my body). Practicing with you has, over time, revolutionized my mental and physical health. I have introjected your voice and can turn to you for guidance when I am out of touch with reality. This has been therapy, more than anything--as I&#39;m sure you know. I&#39;m so glad you have taken the risk to do this work. You are a very bright star in this sometimes dark world. And, what I actually came here to say: you&#39;ve truly outdone yourself this time. These videos are fantastic. Thank-you so, so much. Namaste.",Solastalgia,2019-01-03T21:07:59Z,17

"I even managed to keep a panic attack away during this practice which makes me quite proud of myself. I am dedicating 2019 to myself, especially to my mind. My mind is always really noisy and loud but yoga helps me to silence it a bit. I am really excited to continue this yoga journey and hope that I can keep up! :) The biggest difficulties are my wrists. They hurt extremely when I bend them too long. I sometimes switch into making fists to relax my wrists but that sometimesseems to take the flow away... Any suggestions? Or does anyone else deal with the same problem?",Greenleaf,2019-01-03T20:05:01Z,2
"Greenleaf, yes, I have the same problem and my wrists start hurting pretty soon into the practice. I&#39;ve noticed it is much better if I first do a little wrist excercise - just making slow circles, clockwise and counter-clockwise for a few minutes. It&#39;s simple but it helps.",SumskoDevojce,2019-01-05T15:57:52Z,2
"Greenleaf <br />When I started doing yoga I had the same “wrist problem” but I promise... it gets sooo much better over time! I also made fists when my wrists were hurting too much and sometimes I even took a little break, paused the video and when I felt better I jumped right back in🙂 Building strength and flexibility just takes it time, I guess😅<br />I wish you a beautiful yoga journey and an exiting year, keep going😊❤️",tnaomie,2019-01-04T16:29:27Z,1

"I was swearing... I really didn&#39;t mean anything bad, but there were times when I could barely keep a pose. But I see how with time my self-control is getting better. You are the reason I started yoga and liked it!",Anna Molly,2019-01-03T19:03:01Z,0
"child poses are so difficult for me. being fat, I can&#39;t bring my legs into that position to support my weight, so the shark fin pose is completely unavailable to me. I would be putting harmful pressure and strain on my neck by putting my forehead to the ground, since even my arms aren&#39;t supporting all of the weight.<br /><br />so I modified by going into heart to earth with the shark fin hand pose, in order to continue the practice.<br /><br />yoga isn&#39;t about fitting into the positions. it&#39;s about connecting to your body--your whole body--and your wellness. if a pose doesn&#39;t feel good for you, don&#39;t do it. you&#39;re not a bad yogi or doing it wrong if you are aware that a pose hurts you--especially true for people who want to do inverses, back bends, or even tabletop.",Coryl Addy,2019-01-03T19:01:17Z,251

I am overweight and find my boos constantly are in the way and I get mad at myself... like if I didn’t gain the weight my boobs wouldn’t be the size they are today and wouldn’t be bothering me.

"Yesterday was flat out humiliating, but worth it. Today, I feel more humbled than humiliated. Two days in, and I feel twice as better than when I started. But that&#39;s like saying I improved from 5% to 10%, and that&#39;s the humbling part. I have so much more &quot;quieting&quot; to do internally. I&#39;m still very conscious of how long 40 minutes is out of my day, still mindful of all the things I keep going over, that I should be tuning out and focusing on just yoga. My mind is still busy and pre-occupied/distracted by all the noise of my daily life. My breathing is surprisingly counter-intuitive, and struggling to find aerobic synchronicity with Adriene&#39;s instructions. I can already tell that this journey will be worth it, that all the things I am becoming aware of are things I do need to address. It&#39;s still daunting that the journey itself is not going to be quick or easy. I feel like the fat kid&#39;s second day at the gym, or the crippled&#39;s second day in rehabilitation. I know this is necessary, I&#39;m willing to show up, just a bit humbled by how much showing up I&#39;m going to have to do to get there. This is counter-intuitive to my natural tendency of just &quot;plowing through it.&quot; I can&#39;t just knock this out in a few hours or binge all the episodes in a day. It will literally be just one day at a time. But it is necessary. Today, like yesterday, I&#39;ve got to take what I&#39;ve learned, and consciously apply it throughout my day. Just like yesterday. Just like tomorrow. And all the days that lie ahead. Until it&#39;s not so conscious, til it&#39;s reflexive.<br /><br />One day, I will be bragging about this journey. One day, everyone will notice the difference. One day, I&#39;ll be talking with someone who is where I am at right now, and convincing them that it&#39;s totally worth sticking to. But that day will never come if I don&#39;t stick with it all the way through. So today, I&#39;m eating a lot of humble pie, and I&#39;m going to <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23JustKeepSwimming"">#JustKeepSwimming</a> swimming swimming.",chan zilla,2019-01-03T17:03:11Z,71

"I can relate to the feeling of feeling out of sync with Adriene/breathing, or just feeling off a bit. Not sure what to do there usually. Today, I am feeling peaceful!, and feeling love/enjoyment. When I practice like that, I kind of DO try to breathe when Adriene says, but also, on some moments, you kind of don&#39;t do exactly what she says all the time. So, don&#39;t hold yourself to follow everything EXACTLY. It&#39;s ok to be on/in your own experience a bit, but know she is guiding you with experience.",emily,2019-01-06T04:18:25Z,1
don&#39;t give up - plan to finish the whole 30days on your time. nobody says you have to do the 30days in exactly 30days. Give yourself grace and love when you miss a day. It might take you until July 29 to finish Dedicate - just finish!,Erin Wallace,2019-01-04T04:51:01Z,2

I had to stop yoga last year because I started to get small red or purple blotches all across my forehead any time I did any practice like downward dog. They go away after a few days but show up again next yoga session. Any ideas why that happens? Anybody else experience something like this?

I don&#39;t enjoy the moves as I usually do because I am paying an obsessive amount of attention to my body parts and shoulders (this is something that drives me nuts).

"Amy Hartsough super impressed that you got respectful and non-judgmental replies to your question! I can see how the talking and intonation can be off putting to some. But, I personally prefer it. As a person who only does yoga at home due to kids and scheduling issues; I like the extra instructions. I feel like I pick up extra details and make adjustments to my posture and movements that really add depth to what I’m doing. With no spotter/ instructor to correct my posture as a novice, I appreciate the preciseness of the instructions. I hope that you can find a channel that’s less chatty and more suitable for your needs. Namaste 🙏🏾",Bianca Mathe Reichelt,2019-01-05T22:18:14Z,0

"What happens is that I miss actual instructions because I just zone out in face of the constant stream of words. I&#39;m glad it works for a lot of people, and I appreciate that Adriene makes the videos for free, but it&#39;s really difficult for me to stay with the practice if I have to spend attention on deciphering the constant word stream. I think I need an instructor who is more structured and concise in their verbal output, both content-wise and regarding intonation.",tichuu,2019-01-03T13:11:18Z,0

"Many thanks for your generosity and beautiful practice, Adriene. <br />I am confused by the words “claw your fingers into the ground”. That makes me think my fingers should be gripping into the mat and that doesn’t fit other ideas of relaxed and strong. Can anyone explain how they feel that in their body? <br />Thank you!",Maria DePasquale,2019-01-03T11:09:18Z,0
"I always imagine that my fingers are like that of a ghecko (the lizard) and my fingerprints are like mini-grips (the imagery helps a little so I pay attention). So wide fingers with extra grip in the tips.<br /><br />The practice in truth is to create a physical response in the palm of the hand. You don&#39;t truly want the middle of your palm on the mat (almost think of a tiny tent being made in the middle of your hand), because this can dump too much weight in the wrists and cause injury and pain. When you push a little on your finger prints,  you will notice that the joints at the base of your fingers (like your ball joints on the bottom of your feet) will press more deeply into your mat, lifting the center, and taking a bit of pressure off the base of the palm (because now your body weight is at the base of the fingers). <br /><br />I hope that helps, it takes some practice!",Brittany Damron,2019-01-03T11:23:04Z,0

I struggled more today than yesterday. My sinuses really didn&#39;t want to play nice but I&#39;m glad I made it through. It was overall a nice feeling getting back in touch with my body in spite of needing to work through my frustrations at not quite being well and my negative thoughts about the weight I&#39;ve put on this past month. Finding my stomach and thighs in the way in poses where I know it wasn&#39;t before. I do feel a thread of hope that I can still do the best for myself moving forward from here all the same. Thank you for stating that whether or not the palms reach the floor in dandasana is fully about how long your arms are. I know this is almost obvious but it can be easy to slip in toxic thought when it feels like your body shape doesn&#39;t fit the instruction and I can wonder what I&#39;m missing so I always appreciate when yoga instructors are clear about what is dictated by anatomy. It is extremely helpful.,Clodagh Brennan,2019-01-03T10:53:39Z,1

I have this a few times a month and it all started about 6 years ago in PE (I just turned 17 last month soo....). About 1,5 year ago I was at my worst. I had this numerous times a month and while getting my period I just passed out. This went on for a whole year till I had some serious health problems (my doc didnt think that me passing out every month was serious). Since that point I am on birthcontrol and it kinda helps with my whole condition (besides all the side effects). My circulatory callapses happen less, but they still happen sometimes. <br />I also have been skinny and frail al my life and never had much muscles. So I decided to build some a half year ago when I started having judo in school (I didn&#39;t wanted to lose every dammn match just bc I am the smalest and weakest). <br />I&#39;ve been fitter ever since, but I&#39;m still not very healthy and most of the muscles I could build up are in my arms (now I am at a normally strong point, but still weak xD). And when I realised that all my workouts haven&#39;t helped me that much, I searched for a way to build up muscles all over my body at once. That&#39;s when I found yoga.<br />I&#39;m practicing yoga daily for a month now and after the first week I could already see results in my flexibility.<br />So I am excited to join dedicated and to become healthier! this is challenging for me ( I mean it took me 30 min to recover from the collaps xD) but I am dedicated!<br /><br />Lots of Love!<br />(sorry for my bad english and my phrasing, I am still a little dazed)",karo is art,2019-01-03T10:40:04Z,4

I would have never imagined that Hatha yoga can be so challenging. I was shaking soooo much in that tabletop position with the raised leg. Staying centered while kicking your leg back is definitely hard on your core. Woohoo!

"Yesterday&#39;s practice was hell for me. I was irritable and impatient, and I realised that the yoga mat I bought is far too thin, making poses a nightmare to hold. I couldn&#39;t even forward fold with my knees practically at 45 degrees, I was that tight. I still feel incredibly horrible today, and I&#39;ve only been awake two hours... but I&#39;m not going to give up. Hopefully this practice will serve me (and I can find a way to make my mat not suck). Hope everyone&#39;s having a better time than I am",honey Blue,2019-01-03T10:20:15Z,0
@honey Blue You&#39;re welcomed! And good to hear that you made some adjustments and it&#39;s going a bit better 😊 I hope yoga can continue to be the place u can go to when you feel like there&#39;s no where else to go. Cheers,Skyez_sky,2019-01-04T22:51:09Z,0
"@Skyez_sky Well, I mean I do have depression lol, but I&#39;m handling it a lot better nowadays (yoga helps). I figured I couldn&#39;t double the mat up for the whole session, so I put a blanket underneath my mat, which helped a lot! Still struggling with pressure in my wrists and shoulders, especially in down dog and table top, but it&#39;s so much more preferable than yesterday. Thanks so much for the comment :)",honey Blue,2019-01-03T23:18:49Z,1

"Everyone has their own struggles unfortunately. The thing is to understand that, as soul crushing as it might seem at the moment,  it too will pass (Unless ur actually depressed). Where the tightness is concerned well hey that&#39;s why we have Adriene. And the mat? Double it up for the most taxing poses :) Hang in there! ~&quot;Change the things  you can&#39;t accept and accept the things you can&#39;t change&quot;~",Skyez_sky,2019-01-03T12:32:34Z,1

"I have done many classes with Adriane by now. She is by far the best yoga teacher I have come across. Yesterday I felt the first class was a bit slow, or perhaps I was a bit stressed/rushed, but once it&#39;s over, you feel the positive effects in your body so once again the tempo proves you wrong :).There really is power in yoga. It makes you feel great - and it makes you slow down and just take care of yourself. Thank you so much, Adriane, for all these free videos!

Is it ok to do this 30 day challenge while pregnant?,Christina Karas,2019-01-03T07:44:21Z,0
@Mikaela Jonsson one thing I&#39;m noticing is that it&#39;s hard to avoid core exercises completely. So no planks? But doesn&#39;t all yoga use core? I wish there was a list of poses to avoid.,Christina Karas,2019-01-04T17:41:41Z,0
"@Christina Karas Ofc! I agree woth Adriene, core should be avoided since muscles will part from each other as your belly grows. Don&#39;t be afraid. Have faith and trust, everytjing will go great and sooner than you know, you&#39;ll have your baby girl in your arms ❤",Mikaela Jonsson,2019-01-04T16:59:02Z,1
@Yoga With Adriene Thank you so much for taking the time to reply to me. I will definitely heed your advice. You have really helped me more than you know as this pregnancy has been very emotionally draining on some days and also taking quite a toll on my body. I&#39;m so grateful I discovered you! 💕,Christina Karas,2019-01-03T18:31:29Z,0
"@Mikaela Jonsson thank you for your reply. I&#39;m in the second trimester now but I will still avoid the twists to be safe. I have always been a very active individual and used to be a personal trainer but this is my first pregnancy and so I just wanted to make sure I&#39;m not hurting my growing daughter. Again, thank you for your help ❤️",Christina Karas,2019-01-03T18:29:47Z,0
"Hi Christina! The practices in this program are absolutely suitable for pregnant women with the use of some modifications. Avoid twists below the neck and core work (maybe skip Day 6) and always ask your doctor for advice based on where you are in your pregnancy. I advise that, when in doubt, you supplement your twists and core work with slow and loving breathing.",Yoga With Adriene,2019-01-03T16:19:28Z,0
