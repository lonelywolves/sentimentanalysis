I used to do Tai Chi back before I had my 3 kids. I have been doing yoga for 10 years or so 3-5 times a week and the past 5 with Yoga with Adriene. I love this practice because I feel the energy like Tai Chi when the hands are coming together.  It is revitalizing! I also love a good warrior to feel strong!

"This one did not work for me, unfortunately. It was not pleasant because my body was craving something else today.

Loving my daily yoga sessions with Adrienne. Think I am beginning to build strength and flexibility. However Day 17 was hard for me as I still find sitting crossed legged for any length of time really uncomfortable especially on the inside of my right hip.

"When I first begun doing this journey I dreaded sitting cross-legged as my back would hurt so badly, even in the meditative moments I was cringing as it was so sore and felt so weak. I&#39;ve also had such bad knee pain that would just not leave me alone. And then today the best thing happened...I sat cross legged for 10 minutes straight with little to no pain or weakness. And I&#39;ve just realised now I&#39;ve spent the last few days with little to no knee pain. Usually I&#39;d take a painkiller but it just shows these subtle adjustments my body is making ,for the better, due to the wonderful practise of yoga.",ivjo19,2020-06-30T21:25:05Z,0

I&#39;ve learned in the past few days to follow your body, and do not simply rely on adriene&#39;s command... and so i standed firmly, reach for the sky, and let my hands fall back until it reaches the ground.

I am telling on myself here but I took a day off after 15 days. Instead of that feeling like I needed the break it felt like I was cheating on my new feel good habit. Ugh!

I&#39;ve found myself getting frustrated within practise over the last couple of weeks that I can&#39;t breathe as deeply or for as long as I would like, but today I decided to change things up. <br />I decided to listen to my body, to thank it for healing me and getting me through other chronic illnesses, I decided to seek forgiveness for being so hard on it on a daily basis. I simply learnt the sequences and did them to my full capacity; taking all the time my body and lungs needed. <br /><br />This daily practise has been one of the most healing things for me throughout quarantine; everyday I wake up excited to hit the mat and feel energised and thankful after every session.

"Hi Adriene and community! The first flow in a seated position really hurt all the weak and sore spots in my back. (Any practice where i have to sit up straight in a cross-legged position for more than a few breath cycles just kills me. for ex. The neck, shoulders &amp; upper back lesson 💀) I want to strengthen these areas while accepting the idea that i may have to quit early. I have a hard time knowing when to tap out.

"This was the first practice that brought tears to my eyes. I struggle deeply with keeping a routine and I&#39;ve never made it longer than 3 days in a row with a self care routine. Last night I slept very poorly and had multiple nightmares and panic attacks from a lifelong trauma I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s been really bad recently. So not only have I been able to keep up this care for myself and made it 17 days IN A ROW without ever missing a day, but this practice couldn&#39;t&#39;ve come at a better time for me, returning to my breath. When you said &quot;Talk about a warrior, day 17!&quot; I teared up. I have a hard time breathing deeply into my lungs because of some scoliosis in my back, but I managed to find a flow and breathe deeper for longer than I think I ever have in my life, to be honest. I can&#39;t even begin to express how important this journey has been for me. It has affected my life in so many ways so deeply and I will always be grateful.",Skylar Void,2020-06-03T15:45:10Z,2
"Hi! I adore practicing yoga with you through your amazing videos. I have a constructive criticism to make, though, and I hope this gets read. The ending music is totally off. It works great for the intro, but keep in mind that the person might still be on the floor, relaxing, listening to their body. At the end of a practice, it feels disruptive. I work with music selection and editing (irrelevant, but I have the vocabulary to pinpoint why it feels so and what could feel better), and I think something more subtle and less high pitched could be better to ease us out of the practice. Maybe something less &quot;corporate motivational&quot; and more minimalistic, loopish, fewer elements, to get the driving force for &quot;regular life&quot; started again. Terry Riley, Philip Glass sort of music? Or many other kinds, just something less.... loud. More appropriate for someone who is at home still in touch with their body. Who knows, they might even feel like doing another one. Thanks!",Mari Romano,2020-06-02T19:21:24Z,1

"to be honest, it&#39;s really hard to synchronize the breath and the movement when whenever i&#39;m told to inhale, adrienne starts giving more instructions/insights and i run out of breath and only when she moves to the next movement does she tell you to exhale!",alacarteno,2020-05-13T16:54:10Z,1
"Coronaquest Day 17: Was good to spend a bit of time on the breath, although I still find it quite hard/annoying to sync my breath up with the instructions, quite often it feels like I&#39;m holding my breath for ages waiting for her to get to the next step. I was wondering, is there a universal formula for when to inhale and when exhale? Today it seemed to be, inhale is lift and expansion, exhale is contraction? But still not really that clear.

"I have to say, Day 16 and today have been disappointments for me. I guess when starting this journey I expected the intensity to ramp up. These days have been just slow and boring. Today felt like 20 minutes of doing the same exercise with no real idea why. I get that it&#39;s mindfulness, I guess, but repeating the same exercise so much just begins to feel rote. I actually skipped forward a couple minutes earlier (a first) and paused the video around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGEMzfXfj-g&amp;t=22m00s"">22:00</a> to write this comment. I don&#39;t like feeling like this because I was really enjoying the series up until around this point. I&#39;m guessing the series&#39; objective here just isn&#39;t aligning with my own goals? I will stick with the series at least another few days and hope it speeds up. I do love your attitude Adriene, so I hope I&#39;ll find something else from you that resonates more.

"Hi all, I was wondering if anyone had tips for breathing with shortness of breath? I&#39;ve had periods of shortness of breath in my life and currently it&#39;s quite bad. (I don&#39;t have coronavirus) Yoga has definitely helped me practise breathing, but when I have to consciously focus mainly on breathing, I feel like my lungs don&#39;t get enough air. It&#39;s worse with certain positions, and it&#39;s hard not to focus on panicking when I&#39;d rather be peaceful during the practice. <br />Does anyone experience something like this or have any advice? It would be much appreciated.",lucia,2020-04-16T18:50:25Z,0

"Doing the 30 days in middle of the COVID 19 craziness. Not to criticize but to offer constructive comments . When you say last one, you dont always stay true to that. You get distracted with chatter and I lose the focus on the practice.

"For a practice focusing on the breath, I found a few challenging moments due to the lack of cues:<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGEMzfXfj-g&amp;t=6m15s"">6:15</a> / <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGEMzfXfj-g&amp;t=7m15s"">7:15</a> / <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGEMzfXfj-g&amp;t=20m22s"">20:22</a>- first &amp; second outstretch while sitting and first outreach while standing. Initial movements had extra inhale while arms extended, without a cue to exhale first. Later it changes to inhale extend and exhale arms in. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGEMzfXfj-g&amp;t=6m40s"">6:40</a> - first hands behind neck.

Difficult to do while in chair pose.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGEMzfXfj-g&amp;t=20m40s"">20:40</a> - arms up while inhaling. No cue to exhale before another inhale.

Today I feel so vulnerable and agraviated, I don&#39;t want to go to school tomorrow and face my fears and annoyment. My space feels shattered because my father was in my room for hours laying on my bed; and I wonder why it makes me feel so disgusted and humillated, if it&#39;s wrong that I feel that way, if there&#39;s something important I don&#39;t know. I just feel so out of place, like I&#39;m 15 again...<br />I cried half of the practice, so the breathing was challenging, haha.

Halfway through this practice, my hips and shoulders were looking for some good openers, so I let the video run and just ran with my own flow. The knowledge you&#39;ve helped me find feels so fluent in some of my joints now, like a language I had lost and needed to relearn~ Thank you for making these lessons so accessible; it&#39;s not an exaggeration to say they&#39;ve truly been life-changing. 😊💕",Andrea Kerrigan,2020-01-26T14:34:38Z,0

"This was lovely. During the breating exercise I had some old painful memory coming up from a time I felt very alienated and helpless. I realized I could talk to myself kindly, to my past confused self and send her love. In the forward fold I strangely burst into tears because of a person I loved but couldn&#39;t show my vulnerability with that person and by the last breaths I just sighed out and let every anger go and thought about forgiving my father.

"DAY 17- DONE ! Today’s practice was brilliant and much much needed by my yoga deprived body. When you said “bow your mind intelligence to your body intelligence,” Adriene, i really thought about how the mind is actually dependent on the body just as much as the body is dependent on the mind. We can’t think or function well enough unless our bodies and their energies are tended to and neither can we function well unless our bodies tend to our minds ! Being still and just thinking, listening to our minds is how we heed to our minds and moving and shifting our bodies’ energy is how we tap into what feels good. Thank you for sharing your wisdom and perspective so we could get motivated to live better and stay committed. Namaste ❤️",Ranjani Pammi,2020-01-22T10:47:53Z,0

"Combined today and Day 16 for an extra-long stretch and to catch-up a little bit. With the temperatures in the mid-20s tonight in NYC it was nice to get warm all the way to the core. When I started this month I had these big ideas of things I&#39;d like to do with my body but didn&#39;t really think they&#39;d ever be possible. But now I&#39;m starting to see small changes in my flexibility, back pain, and strength. I&#39;m hopeful that everything I imagine I&#39;d like to do will one day really be possible. xoxo",Jenny Kellerhals,2020-01-21T02:16:24Z,0

The the synchronizations around the 20-minute mark were a complete experience for me. I did as well as focused on something different each time, which made it more fun and interesting.

"I found this one very difficult. I&#39;ve been doing yoga for decades but for some reason, this practice today was my most challenging yet. I felt irritated by the synchronicity and the repetitiveness of the seated posture. My mind wandered to anywhere but &#39;here&#39; because I didn&#39;t want to do this. I made it through to the end, I kept recalling myself back but I wanted to quit, to cry so I appreciate this practice because the harder ones help me to reset and to focus. It&#39;s easy to go through the motions and it feel capable and easy, but that&#39;s not life so this practice was a recall to life lessons.

Practicing asana with her has truly changed my life. It has led me into a meditation practice and honestly, a complete transformation of both my inner and outer worlds.<br />Adriene is truly a guiding beacon of light, and I thank her profoundly in my heart at least once during every practice for being who she is and doing what she does. <br />Namaste everyone!<br />Zoë",Zoe Kovel,2020-01-19T18:33:27Z,0

"It (still) boggles my mind that the more mindful I am of the connection between breath and body, the more synchronicity I see in the environment outside my body: in literal time, in repeated people crossing our path--in pretty much most things.. Often I get excited and read into the synchronicities a lot more than maybe helpful, and maybe this a great reminder that although synchronicity is wonderful, maybe see it more as a guide post rather than the goal. Synchronicites will always be cool to me, and have some meaning, but I&#39;m quickly realizing that the real work only begins there. Namaste 🙏",Jay-Ram Rajendra,2020-01-19T05:45:06Z,0

My morning was a bit disrupted but I wanted to get the yoga in! So I was a bit late to a social event because I know how important this time is to me. It does feel like yoga is medicine for my  anxious brain! This is the most I’ve ever gotten out of the 30 days and the easiest it has been to stick to! I love how the days are balanced so well with core and rests and stretches 😊🧘‍♀️,Lydia,2020-01-19T00:15:13Z,0

"I take a different course of spirituality when I get on the mat, but I feel closer and more at ease. There is no way that I could have done 17 days in a row before had there not been this trust and reliance on my God. Legs were a little stiff after awhile, but I always love these practices that bring me back to basics with breath control. When I am trying to speed through something, my breathing gets out of control so this was a great reminder. Had a panic attack the other day, but used the breathing taught from you, Adriene, to calm myself down. So many thanks to you for doing this awesome practice. I can&#39;t believe that I can call yoga as part of my routine, but I am! &lt;3 &lt;3 Glad to hear all you in Australia are finally getting some much needed rain!

"day 17...check and I already feel like this is a way of life.  I AM seeing the results off that mat! Not only am I seeing awesome changes in my physicality but I stop often to take deep fulfilling breaths. I stop often when I notice tension in my body, breath in, tense up harder then breath out and let it all go. Also, my posture, I had not realized how bad my posture has been all my life (horrid, I now see!) but I find that I am now correcting the bad ways I nestle into sitting and standing. No wonder I have been in so much pain for so many years! I am grateful for this practice.

Day 16 was far from me today. Started the day by going swimming and after an hour of swimming I felt my arms too  tired and decided I  was not going to make it.

I’ve notice that really slow flow yoga like this with repetitive movements really makes it hard to train the monkey mind for some reason. I definitely have a harder time with it than more of the faster pace stuff. It’s harder for me to not over think and I get frustrated/ bored. I’m not sure what that says about me. Lol,Shawnee,2020-01-18T19:26:39Z,280
"@Gloria Slechta I came to the comments too after 20ish min because I was started to get really frustrated with her constant talking, I thought maybe I’m just irritable today or something. First time I’ve ever struggled with her videos but oh well, she’s def learned over the years since in her recent uploads she doesn’t talk nearly as much and lets you listen to your own breath",Megan P,2021-03-18T17:11:49Z,1
lol I was thinking the same thing that&#39;s why i&#39;m reading the comments here instead of doing whatever she&#39;s instructing me to do at the moment. i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve ever done this before and stopped during one of her yoga vids! glad i&#39;m not the only one struggling with this one.,Gloria Slechta,2021-03-17T22:58:29Z,1

"A few days ago I had a moment during one of Adriene’s videos where in savasana I went into a blissful trance, I couldn’t even pause the video to have that moment quietly, my body was just guiding me through a dreamy happy blissful trance, and it was very special. Today, at the end of this video when we brought our palms together to put our thumbs in our third eye, I just...I don’t know how to explain it without it sounding weird our obvious haha but the thing is like, I felt, but REALLY felt my palms (?) when they touched the first thought that came to my mind was &quot;wow, these are my palms!&quot; So...yeah I’m just so amazed by the magic of yoga and how it deepens my connection to my body with my mind and spirit ☺️💞 thank you Adriene and thank you yoga for existing &lt;3",Val cami,2020-01-18T19:24:20Z,20

Adrienne! Four years ago I was traveling across the country to protest in the women’s march in DC. An acquaintance that I was traveling with mentioned your challenge and we practiced together after the march. Four years and four 30 day yoga challenges later I’m carrying the strength that I have cultivated through your practice in the protest today. What a journey!,Margot Frazier,2020-01-18T19:03:34Z,22
"I&#39;ve posted each day and shared so much. This has been such a terrific week inspite of saying goodbye to my uncle. One of the most beautiful souls to have walked the earth. I didn&#39;t lose myself in grief. I didn&#39;t rely on poor food and or alcohol to dull the loss. I met you, the Kula, myself and my grief on the mat. In turn I was given the gift of celebrating my wonderful memories that a 78 year old man gave me over the past 27 years since marrying my husband his nephew. Thank you for the tools for life&#39;s real journey. Namaste`",kristi shore,2020-01-18T18:57:28Z,9

"THAT was the toughest practice yet. I&#39;m good at synchronizing breath while moving my whole body or being in a difficult pose or just being still, but for some reason doing it with those simple hand/arm movements was extremely challenging (mentally, I just wanted to move).

I’m definitely drawing on my yoga mat experiences in my day-to-day life; simple things like the breathing and dropping the shoulders back and standing tall. <br /><br />I love the ‘flow’ sessions but hands up who struggles to keep up and marry up the breathing and not topple over 😆 but it’s all good and if you can’t laugh at yourself then it’s all over 😂 <br /><br />Thanks Adrienne you’re a legend 🧘‍♀️ 🙏🏽💕,NatRisp,2020-01-18T13:30:42Z,3

"Being aware of the breath is definitely my biggest struggle on the mat. Funnily enough, knowing that I struggle with that makes me try to breathe mindfully very often off the mat! This practice was a challenge, but a truly gentle and relaxing one. Hope you all have a wonderful day ❤️ Namaste",anamuinelo,2020-01-18T13:06:36Z,0

"Day 17: Usually I am really relaxed after coming from the mat, but today I got really frustrated because the my syncronisation of breath and movement was constantly stopped by Adriene&#39;s talking and stopping the flow. I know I should focus on my breath and my movement, but today was the first time of doing yoga for over eight years that I had the feeling the video did not bring me joy. Maybe I got up with the wrong foot, but I will try again tomorrow. New day, new me. Nevertheless, thank you Adriene for doing these videos and maybe even showing me where I still need work.

This really triggered my chronic back pain but i stuck with it and completed it and hope for better experience tomorrow!

"Honestly when she said &quot;now that we&#39;re halfway&quot; I felt I should mention in the comments that I really needed several months, and doing all six of her currently existing 30-day journeys, before I understood this find what feels good, and veering off the railroad tracks = listening to your own body and you dont have to follow her cues. (you have to at first bc you dont know what youre doing. It&#39;s like knowing the chords but not knowing how to play a song. I could sorta do the basic poses but I couldnt do a sequence myself.) This is why the 30th day (without audio) didnt work for me the first few times, I just skipped them because I didnt get it. And i was not a total beginner you guys, I had done a lot of budget-gym-yoga-classes but it wasnt until now that i think im finally beginning to understand what it means to move like you love yourself. thanks again Adriene, namaste &lt;3",Ruby,2020-12-17T15:56:06Z,0

"Bleh. SO frustrated today again. Don&#39;t know what it is, I can&#39;t take a deep breath. It hurts everywhere in my body, and it feels so restricted. To take the deeeeep deeep breath that my body needs, I have to sort of hunch my back, lift my shoulders, and just use all my strenght. I&#39;ve always had trouble with breathing deep (it literally feels like my whole torso is just stretching almost to the point of breaking), but today was worse than in a long time.. Stuck to it though, even though I REALLY wanted to give up. I&#39;m hoping todays practice has some benefits even though I spent the whole time being frustrated and crying..

"Ahh what a lovely way to start the weekend. I finished my practice to the morning lit with a half moon and stars here in the UK! Woke early to an argument outside and couldn&#39;t sleep again. With a little consciousness I decide to meet the day the best way - RPM (Rise, Pee and Mat) what a wonderful way to turn a bad nights sleep into synchronisation. I feel awake and refreshed and so much gratitude for everyone practicing these tools of yoga so we can show up more loving, more kind and more present to ourselves and each other! Ollie the dog was snoozing in bed and just at the end of the practice he woke up to find me not there and came dashing in all flustered! It reminded me of how I start my mornings sometimes. Thank you Adriene for helping me to be centred, balanced and breathing! Wishing you all a wonderful weekend where you carve out time for nourishing you ❤️",Jo Chew,2020-01-18T07:54:55Z,8

"wobbly legs towards the end this morning but used the tools to regain balance.  and thanks to everyone for the downward facing dog love yesterday - it took me over a year to get there and just suddenly happened without thinking about it - and if it happened for me, it can happen for anyone - enjoy the journey! xxx",bridgecmw,2020-01-18T07:35:33Z,0
"Morning yoga makes me weak and dizzy. I&#39;d like to know why is that. I was kinda frustrated with this and almost fainted at the end ☹️<br />Luckily, nothing happened, and I&#39;m happy I&#39;ve managed to get to the end 🍀",Minja Markovic,2020-01-18T07:30:03Z,0
"@Ginatus Oh yes, I usually grab a few dates and drink a glass of water in the morning.<br />It&#39;s a weird feeling...like I can&#39;t get enough oxygen, no matter how much I focus on the breathing. You&#39;re probably right about the blood pressure, since there&#39;s no problem with later practices.",Minja Markovic,2020-01-18T08:28:36Z,0
"Maybe eat or drink something before? Have you tried doing yoga some other time of the day, does the dizziness occur only in the morning? It could have something to do with low blood pressure or something, but that&#39;s just my uneducated guess.",Ginatus,2020-01-18T08:06:21Z,0

"I&#39;ll be practicing come morning, but I wanted to say hello to everyone! I hope you&#39;re all well! The last few days have been excellent for me in terms of my practice. I&#39;ve noticed I tend to sigh out exhales in almost a hum sometimes, and it feels really nice! I&#39;ve also started to find myself smiling during my practice. And most interestingly, as I go to sleep I find myself checking in with my body, almost as though we&#39;re having a conversation, as though I&#39;m asking how it&#39;s doing, is it comfortable, what does it want. That&#39;s very new for me! Lots of love you to you all &lt;3",Meghan McGarry,2020-01-18T07:14:30Z,1

"Day 17: The phrase &#39;Sense of Self&#39; is important to me here. I have always been scared to make decisions and when I have made them, half-heartedly (again because of fear and underconfidence), I have failed to stand up to them and blamed other people. This yoga practice made me realize that I should be open to making mistakes and take responsibility. And as I start doing that, I am bound to make mistakes. Because that is how you learn and then gain confidence. Thank you for reminding me of that, Adriene. I am grateful. Namaste.",rubyveil19,2020-01-18T07:06:10Z,175

This was an excellent exersice! ❤️ How is it you always seem to know what is needed? 🤔 Since yesterday afternoon my shoulder strain has been bugging me a lot and my sleep wasn&#39;t that great because of it 🙁 I woke up exhausted and in a lot of pain. After doing day 17, I can safely say it&#39;s still there a little but only if I really focus on it. It feels so much better! ❤️ Thank you Adriene! Namaste! 🙏🏻",Deborah,2020-01-18T07:00:50Z,1

The harmony between my breath and the flow of my thoughts during these kinds of practices never ceases to amaze me.

Totally agree:) it helps so much!  I often add some other matching 20-30 min workout from Adrienne&#39;s channel on top of those.,Victoria K,2020-01-18T06:49:12Z,2
"I agree a 45 minute yoga session is a minimum to get all the benefits but this is how people start to get an introduction to yoga. Well that was my journey. Adrienne has so many other videos you can always add other videos to your session. She even has them grouped into length of time sessions. Almost 6m subscribers, this is what people want so it&#39;s what she gives.  If you want more take more. Find what feels good for you, she has some much tougher sessions if you feel you need it but don&#39;t ignore all this breath work it&#39;s very important too. Be grateful for what&#39;s on offer, really good instructions to allow you to improve your practice and join a local class build on it even more.  If you do join a local class it&#39;s great that you can come back here and follow her foundations of yoga sessions for poses you didn&#39;t fully understand in class.<br /><br />Now I like to come back to these short sessions to join the community and share the love plus it&#39;s a journey, there is always more to learn to allow you to get deeper into the pose. We all feel the same stretch just some people have to go closer to the floor to feel it.  Some year I&#39;ll get there but only when my body is ready.",Paul Fairbrother,2020-01-18T06:43:26Z,2
