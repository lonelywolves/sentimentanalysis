Adriene teaches me to have compassion for myself. I didn&#39;t realise how hard I was on myself until I started this journey and started picking up on how I talk to myself on the mat.

Hi Adriene! I just keep on going back to these amazing practices. Practicing yoga has brought me a lot of benefits in so many aspects of my life and I can see how important it is to breathe and to remember that we are sometimes just a breath away from feeling a little better. I love you all!!,Claudia Lamprea,2021-03-23T17:06:53Z,0
"Thank you Adriene. I have to confess that it&#39;s becoming harder to come to the mat. I don&#39;t love it any less, but something in me is offering resistance. I will still show up nonetheless because it is always the best part of my day. I am feeling more connected to my breath, and it&#39;s even happening off the mat. Both emotionally and physically I find power through my breath as I go about my day. Finally, I wanted to note that I attempted to touch my head to the ground like you and... misjudged... How much farther the ground was and it was quite the tumble, so thank you for the opportunity to laugh at myself :)<br />Namaste",Taylor Hill,2021-03-21T04:08:34Z,0

"I&#39;m with Debela Barbara below - this is one of my favorite days.

This is helping my body and head during the grimness of a UK lockdown. I am very grateful to you Adriene. Namaste.",Sue Frost,2021-02-18T12:17:32Z,0

I feel good.  I feel not-alone.<br /><br />Going to keep taking Saturdays off and continuing on with whatever day comes next on Sunday, I think, at least through the end of this 30-day journey.  It&#39;s wonderful to realize that, even though I very much did need the break, my body was ready and so very happy to work as hard as I asked it to today.  My core is a little stronger than it was two weeks ago.  I&#39;ve figured out how to create enough space in my downwards-facing dog that I actually can step a foot all the way up between my hands in one step, at least sometimes.  I don&#39;t get as frustrated when Adriene&#39;s pace and mine don&#39;t quite match.<br /><br />I feel good.  Thanks, Adriene--this one was pretty great.",Clarity C,2021-01-17T20:10:15Z,0

I used to be much taller than my peers, had wide shoulders, big hands, long fingers. as a girl, I used to be ashamed and always tried to hide myself by wearing baggy clothes, even crouching when taking photos with friends so we&#39;d seem to be the same height. as I opened my arms wide and spread my fingers in star pose today, I realised how much space I can take and this felt so freeing and grounding, expansive.

It made me laugh .. there it was - visibly up there hovering but connecting my hand to my ankle - a little beyond me.. I nearly caught it one side... Looking forward to progression with that. What has been noticeable is that I no longer have pain in my left buttock just walking around. Now it&#39;s painless.. I&#39;ve lived with that pain for about 5 years.

The earth keeps revolving, it does not stay stable; the day ends and the night follows; after humid summers follow relieving monsoons. This reinforces the fact that impermanence is the law of the universe. Therefore being proud of your wealth is a sign of immaturity, because it can vanish into thin air in a minute.

"I came to the mat feeling depressed and drain and it was so many things that played a part in it but mostly it was intrusive thoughts and self doubt and self criticism that got me feeling less capable and I never really paid it any attention or gave it any credit but not matter how I was feeling each day since this month started I showed up on the mat to practice and finished each one and I always held myself to a standard it not a big deal so just practice and only at the end of this practice I realised that I had the courage to show up each day and that shows how much I am capable of and I should be proud to know that I did so thank u Adriene for helping me remember what my journey is all about, much love Namaste üíû‚ù§üôèüáπüáπüôè",Vanessa Morris,2021-01-16T01:34:45Z,0

"Day 14 - Space, We made it! almost half way through this beautiful journey. I&#39;m really happy I made it to the mat. Today was really busy, so I wasn&#39;t sure if I was going to have the energy. I&#39;ve come to realize that wether I have energy or not, if I just roll out the mat, lay on it, stretch, start my practice, by the end of it, I sometimes feel energized, and sometimes I just feel really relaxed, I feel calm and peaceful in my body and in my mind. I love that. I love that whatever is happening outside, around me, or even in my own head, I can get on the mat and find peace in my breath, in the movements, and the poses. Make space for what we need, and that can change by the day, hour, or even minute, and that is perfectly ok! Todays practice was very therapeutic and gentle.  I know I say this alot, but it really was exactly what I needed. Its like this Yoga Journey is following my heart. Thank you Adriene for being such a loving and caring guide!

I am taking this opportunity (space) to ask two questions I&#39;ve been meaning to ask for months: first, when we are wanting to press into the knife edge of the foot, I never quite feel that in that way.

I have to actually break the post and reposition. Anyone else? Tips?",Jeanne Pengelly,2021-01-15T22:01:58Z,1

Not going to lie today was very hard for me to show up and I was not feeling it but now as I lay on my mat after finishing this practice I feel so refreshed and my mind is clearer.

"So, I&#39;m pretty exhausted because of my depression. Just, you know, one of those days when you stare at the wall and wonder why the hell you&#39;re so fucking exhausted and you begin to think you&#39;ll get stuck in this powerlessness and tiredness forever. Insomnia doesn&#39;t help to fight this feeling either. <br />And when I saw this 36-minute-long video I thought to myself &quot;no way, not today&quot;. I just wanted to lay in bed forever and sleep, because that&#39;s the closest state to being dead that I can get like NOW. But I remembered Adriene saying &quot;a little goes a long way&quot; so I decided just to press start and do like 2 minutes. During the practice I was like &quot;I&#39;m so done with this, I can&#39;t&quot; but then something changed and I caught myself... smiling. And then, the video ended.<br />I&#39;ve survived this day and done a 36-minute-long yoga session with Adriene. Yep, I guess I&#39;m a hero now :D",Lizzy Mad Hatter,2021-01-15T20:26:41Z,3

"When Adriene asked us to become quiet at the end of practice in savasana, my 13 month old started pushing buttons on one of her loud toys and brought it over to me right in my face and was yelling with happiness. I just started laughing and allowed her space to be a sweet darling little human, a true yogi. She takes up any and all space and has no absolutely no concept of boundaries. It‚Äôs phenomenal how breath can clear the fog from your sky and drop scales from your eyes and allow you to see truth all around you.

"@Jess Spain I totally hear you! I used to get fairly irritated and aggressive about things that disturb my quiet...then I had a child and nothing has been quiet in my life for a while üòÇBut no, seriously: Being zen or calm or being in a mediative state is not about being checked out, and ignoring all the things around you that may or may not be pleasant or quiet. It‚Äôs about being able to check in and being able to notice ‚Äúthat really bothers me and I stay bothered for a while‚Äù. To meditate is to contemplate, to notice, to take stock of what is. You approach those noises and disruptions and they are a challenge. They are meant to throw you off balance and see how well you regain yourself. My baby interrupting my quiet IS my practice, she is my yoga instructor for she teaches me what it means to just be with what is happening at the moment. The loudness you experience during meditation IS meditation. ‚ù§Ô∏è",J J,2021-01-18T01:53:16Z,2

"Wow. Props for your practice allowing you to see this, mid sequence too! I still struggle with loud/jarring noises, inside practice especially, but even outside practice.

"So far my experience is best described as blossoming, opening, encouraging, enlightening, lightening, freeing, restoring and energizing.  I am learning to honour my breath and all the places in my body that I haven&#39;t spent time with before.  I am learning to honour the place I am at right now and the time I have finally given myself to engage in a yoga practice.  I am learning to celebrate my body and its movement and simple presence in space and in the present moment.  For the past three months, I have felt pain in my left arm (had some diagnostic tests this week) and some hip discomfort ( a little osteoarthritis) but I feel more aware of my body now and an overall sense of comfort and elongation and space and more openness --despite the fact that yoga is new for me and some of the postures are difficult for me--along with the movement from one into another.  After this 30 day series, I am looking forward to working through Adriene&#39;s Foundation Yoga videos.  I feel so supported by Adriene&#39;s approach, her commentary, her sense of humour and her humanity --and happy I am here!  Thank you!   (and I LOVED Day 14!)",Susan Beaumont,2021-01-15T19:12:08Z,0

"I&#39;d like to share what I wrote down in response to the prompts Adriene offered us. I took the prompts and sort of just let the words flow:<br />So far my experience is best described as simply wonderful. It has not all been wonderful, some days I have wanted to cry, felt so frustrated and annoyed at myself for NOT BEING ENOUGH! But, I think what has made it wonderful is that as the days have gone by, I have developed a deeper connection to myself and my breath and body, a connection that I had lost along the sometimes thorny and winding path of life. These past 14 days I have spent learning to honour AND celebrate the beauty that is being alive, to throw away the notion that there is any part of me that is not ENOUGH. I still get frustrated. But, I have smiled while falling out of poses more often than I have frowned. I have learned, I am learning, to breath like I love myself and really, really, deeply mean it. I wasn&#39;t expecting this when I stepped on the mat on the first day. I almost didn&#39;t step on the first day. But I am so, so grateful that I did, to myself, to Adriene and Benji, and to every single person who has stepped on their mats with me everyday, to share in each others journeys. I feel so much love, I feel so much gratitude. Thank you.",Natascha Paul,2021-01-15T18:48:04Z,0

"I find myself surrendering to poses so much more instinctively than I did on day 1.  In my previous experiences with yoga, I&#39;ve always felt the urge to fight the gentle discomfort I felt, even in poses like downward dog.  Today I realized that when I go into DD, it feels easy, natural, comfortable.  This new ease means I can actually try and find the nuance to poses and my body&#39;s capacity to bend/stretch/evolve--this is something that Adriene mentioned early on, but at the time, I felt like just getting into the pose was enough.  I used to scoff when instructors encouraged us to see poses like DD as a place to rest . . . but I&#39;m starting to sense real changes in my body and my brain b/c of the regular practice.

"Hi Adrienne and yogis,<br />I‚Äôm so enjoying my daily sessions of me time. And I have an analogy that came to mind doing the twist on the floor, which I wanted to share with you. Imagine I am a towel that has absorbed worries and baggage and in the twisting move, all that seeps away ( just like wring out a towel while you remove water). Then as I breath in, I am able to absorb clean clear water to reset/start again. It all goes with the breath so it‚Äôs a purifying feel.<br />I hope you like it.<br />I feel cleansed and ready to start again now.<br />Love to you all<br />Bridget from Devon.

"I won&#39;t lie: showing up to the mat today was a real challenge. I was feeling drained from two straight weeks of daily yoga - by far the most consecutive daily practices I&#39;ve ever done. But as the wisdom goes, showing up is half the battle. From there, it&#39;s just a matter of leaning on your own strength. So far, my experience is best described as: challenging, yet invigorating; a process of discovering my own strengths.",Joe Whelan,2021-01-15T16:43:56Z,69

"I am feeling good, sore, strong, unsure, flexible and rigid. Also grateful, happy and sad. It&#39;s kinda amazing to be able to feel these sorts of emotions all at once. I wish I could say that at the age of 28, that I was closer to having all my ducks in a row, but I do not. However, coming back to practice with Adriene always reminds me to accept where I am today and to try staying in the present moment. Challenges will always arise, whether they are out of your control or you&#39;re struggling to fight with your own inner demons that constantly tell you that you&#39;re not good enough. The important thing that YWA teaches us is how to combat those moments in a loving and mindful way. I have to learn to forgive myself for being so hard on myself about how my body is, how my degenerative scoliosis makes me feel as if it&#39;s holding me back from doing amazing things.  But, I know that ultimately it&#39;s my mindset that I need to work on and that even if my back/hips may not go back completely to normal, I can still reach my goals and aspirations. That&#39;s what I keep trying to tell myself anyway and daily yoga practice continues to help me with that.",Krystina,2021-01-15T16:37:34Z,1

"I feel very empty, stressed these days and I feel like I‚Äôm less productive as I should be, i overate and hated myself for that today... and when I saw that this practice is 35min I really wanted to miss it and felt like I can‚Äôt manage with it today... but i showed up! I felt restless and took breaks, light few candles instead of some movements and I felt a bit detached but  I still did it, i stretched out my body and felt good kind of burning, also took few long breaths. And when we were doing the X pose and Adriene said the thing about that we allowed to take space I started crying a bit and it released some tension, felt like a warm hug I needed. Let it be a reminder that there will be hard days and the times when you don‚Äôt want to show up, but it is worth it every time ! Even if you will suck at movements or could‚Äôt feel calm, it will make your soul at least a little bit more peaceful and your body will feel less locked.

However, my circumstances are making me anxious. I am trying to be open  to both. <br /><br />Yesterday was bad. And today was worse. But yoga on today went without a pause. I did everything and well. My mind was too uncertain of getting through the 40 mins. I did anyway beating its stupid doubts. Thanks to myself. <br /><br />Tomorrow is my birthday and I am having such birthday blues. I feel unloved and misunderstood specially by the person I am supposed to be understood by.

"Wow today was powerful for me. When I expanded into star pose, I began to cry. Something opened. As I focused on the remaining poses I gripped back up tight. Then when I let go again in Shavasana I cried again. Even now I feel very vulnerable and like I want to close back up tight. This is interesting. Today requires some attention and allowing.  I might go back and do this practice again later to see what happens. Thank you, Adriene, for the can opener.",Lauren Pickens,2021-01-15T14:10:36Z,0

Praying, focusing on my breath and remaining calm guided not just me but eventually also guided my accident ‚Äúbuddy‚Äù and the police.

"So far my experience is best described as finding out that I can commit to taking care of my body and my mind on a daily basis carving out time for myself and acknowledge that the hardest part is indeed showing up but when you do show up finding what feels good is a sweet reward I am learning to honour myself and my efforts to embrace daily yoga practice as a natural instinctive part of my day not a chore or a task on a to do list I am learning to celebrate not only my achievements in terms of flexibility and strength that I gained so far but also the areas of struggle and I send lots of loving kindness to those areas of my body<br />I am feeling like my daily yoga practice is a natural part of my day by day 14 I show up on the mat without encouraging myself or motivating to do it , it just happens naturally now that I have learnt to create SPACE  in my day to focus on me and DROP into a conversation with my breath  thank you for this year‚Äôs  beautiful January  journey Adriene and for all you do for us ...

I spent first couple of minutes on the mat crying. But at one point I stopped. And had those thoughts that I don&#39;t like the practice but I changed my mind as we continued to move. It wasn&#39;t a difficult one but it required some focus. It was the hardest because I have a lot to think about.<br />By the end of the practice it hit me that it&#39;s like a repetition to what happened two years ago. But everything worked out just fine even if I struggled. I know it doesn&#39;t make sense to anyone but it does to me. And it made me cry again. I can do it!

Also, because my arms and legs are still quite tired, it got a bit challenging from the warriors poses. I was shaking quite a bit a times, but I stayed strong and focused on my breath to help me. Definitely one to try again when I have more energy! Finally, as always, the messages you spread are particularly timely, as is Mary Oliver&#39;s poem you shared in the email. I am literally in the same situation, as I don&#39;t have a permanent home base at the moment and left quite a lot of things at my mum&#39;s, and I will probably get rid of even more when I do move somewhere new.

"Just jumping on here to find motivation to do this video later on the day. Normally I do them in the morning right after I wake up (so I can&#39;t argue with myself wether I am motivated enough), but today I don&#39;t have time (had a bad night so couldn&#39;t get out of bed). But I want to do the video after my whole day of lessons and studying so I can go into my night and weekend relaxed. So. I promise to myself (and you guys are my witnesses) that I am going to do this tonight! &lt;3 Have a beautiful day lovely people.",No√©mi Wiegman,2021-01-15T07:05:18Z,55

"Today‚Äôs practice felt really awesome, my shoulders and upper back and neck was really tight be7of some weight training that I did earlier in the week and the created  SPACE in these areas was just what I needed, so feel very relaxed in these areas and open and upper back and shoulders really let go of all the tension in the muscles. I think bringing conscious BREATH while opening up to the idea of creating SPACE in these areas really helped and as you say Adriene, being present in the moment and being mindful of the movement is really the key to having more mobility, so thank you Adriene for this lovely practice, love to see Benji in the background.
