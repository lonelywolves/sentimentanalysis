@Sarah Rossiter hey I‚Äôm a newbie too so I feel you! It‚Äôs encouraging to see comments like this to know I‚Äôm not the only one who shakes and slips around haha! But like you said focusing on my breathing really gets me through. These videos that Adrienne has done have been life changing. Knowing it‚Äôs not so much about the Asanas but more so about the breath has been an game changer for me. Anyway stay strong my friend. We‚Äôre all in this together!,Connor Mouser,2021-05-04T02:29:27Z,1
Shaking. Couldn&#39;t do half of it. But I&#39;m gaining strength and awareness. Resting in child&#39;s pose and focusing on breath when it&#39;s too much for me.,Sarah Rossiter,2021-05-03T19:49:44Z,2
"I feel absolutely amazing and ‚Äúin tune‚Äù if that makes sense. I just want to love and be at peace with myself, others, the Earth. I want experience other‚Äôs energies and share them.

"I started following one of Adrienne&#39;s 30-day journey in 2019, and that was when I first fell in love with Yoga. That was when I started to learn about the power of breathing! The physical and mental changes that I experienced at the time was so amazing that after completing the 30 day journey, I decided to continue doing Yoga by myself. And for a long time, life was good.<br /><br />I am currently back to who I was before Yoga. Basically stressed, depressed, and constantly tired. I stopped doing Yoga a few months so I didn&#39;t think getting back into will be difficult. But oh boy, I started Day 1 yesterday and oh my god! Poses that used to feel so easy for me somehow became very very difficult. My legs were shaking and when I woke up today, my whole body is sore! I did not want to continue with this. But guess what, I am not gonna give up cause I will reach to that point in life where I can feel good again! <br /><br />I know it&#39;s a long comment but I really needed to do this and since I don&#39;t really have friends that can possibly understand this, I figured the comment sections would have plenty!

When you&#39;re about to meet a friend, you get excited and look forward to it. And when the friend leaves, you tell them how glad you were to see them. So I started to look forward to each breath, and think &quot;Thank you for the opportunity&quot; to say goodbye to each breath as I exhaled and let it go. I&#39;ve never been more able to focus on my breath throughout a practice.<br /><br />I feel very peaceful and grateful for each breath and each opportunity to experience it.",Clarissa Garvey,2021-03-19T21:01:59Z,0

"After having a braintrombose in october (bloodcloth to the brain) and finally feeling up to starting a daily yoga practice again yesterday, I&#39;m wondering if any of you know any herbal teas that don&#39;t contain licorice. I used to drink yogi tea after practice and throughout the day, but my physician told me to avoid licorice at all costs since that increases blood pressure and thus adds to the risk of having another bloodcloth. Really miss having a warm, comforting drink after the practice but also an alternative to coffee during the day!",Naamah Notorious,2021-03-16T21:57:00Z,1

"Hi everyone,I&#39;ve just started a month late,but then I&#39;ve only just decided to take the journey into yoga,and I&#39;m glad I did.

Mine did too. But now it&#39;s stronger and hurts less than it used to. Maybe you should try to sit less straight while you&#39;re a beginner. Like Adriene says: find what feels good. But be careful!

I really appreciate her saying that the hardest part is showing up.<br />And today&#39;s theme/concept was very interesting; to arrive with every new breath, to realize that each breath cycle is a new beginning. I needed that. So, thanks, Adrienne!<br />My point is that if there&#39;s anyone like me in any way, I&#39;m just letting you know that you&#39;re not alone.

Overall I&#39;ve been doing a lot better but yoga classes have been one of my biggest hurdles because smoking helps my body to relax and helps yoga to feel a lot better since my body has been very sore from doing physical labor for a long time.

"I like this class a lot. I was there for day 1 too. I just have a critic I hope is useful.<br /><br />The speaking is very monotonous, and it becomes stressful when you have to turn your head up to the screen every five seconds to check if you&#39;re doing it right, or if you have been holding the pose for too long. I have the feeling that I cant trust this voice that goes &quot;so you tuck your chin to your chest and bring your foot onto the mat AND BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO YOUR BREATH move this to that and roll up to the sky AND THEN THE IDEA OF THE ARRIVAL...&quot; : I mean, you cant just let the flow go and look for the inflection of the voice to follow the instructions, you have to be there for each word, studying what&#39;s possibly coming at the end of the sentence so you&#39;re not too late doing your move (and if you miss one word - maybe because a car passed or because you&#39;re not fluent in english - then you feel totally lost). And whenever the tone changes, it gets your attention, you get all excited about whats coming next, and you realize it wasnt new information, it was just telling you to relax, which has the opposite effect. ^^",Barkrust k,2021-01-19T10:44:09Z,0

I don&#39;t have time&quot; (but I was just sitting on the couch watching YouTube anyways).  However, I realized just how much tension I was holding in my jaw (I have TMJ and it&#39;s been worse lately) and so I sat down and did the video.<br />I woke up today, debating on if I wanted to get out of bed early and do this or if I wanted to sleep an extra hour and just do it in the evening.  I got up and did it.  I&#39;m glad I decided to start my day this way.<br />In order to hold myself accountable, I am going to leave my thoughts in the comments after each day.",mon last name,2021-01-18T22:34:15Z,0

"When you said at the very end that every practice will be different, and you might have a moment where you think you won&#39;t show up, tears came. This practice has definitely got me feeling that way for future practices. It was especially hard, and somehow the &quot;arrive at every breath&quot; that seemed so wonderful in idea was difficult in practice, and made it harder to just breathe. It didn&#39;t help me turn off my thinking brain. I worry that I&#39;m doing too much, and that I&#39;m hurting my body. But I also worry that I&#39;m not doing enough if I modify or just stop doing a certain pose. But every practice will be different. A new beginning.

"I must say I REALLY APPRECIATE your videos and that they‚Äôre free. I started doing a bit back in November as outside walks became less feasible in the North. Trying to do more this year. I did Day 1 1/4 and only coming to Day 2 now (1/14), but still trying. Maybe when I get a job after I finish school in a month I‚Äôll be able to donate something to help keep these videos free and ad-free. You‚Äôre the only one to be able to get me to do yoga this much.

"I especially appreciate Adriene&#39;s Rumi poem reference.. So many poignant subtleties in her teachings.. <br /><br />This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival. A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes As an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they‚Äôre a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight. The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.

However we are anticipating being well behind as we like to skip the yoga on days that we have another major outing, ie. xc skiing, hiking or even a big birding day.  We are actually finding this journey fairly easy so far, as we prepared with two months of your shorter 20 - 25 minute videos 4-5 days a week. We are loving it!

"I love your videos, however I find it frustrating whenever you ask to press equally into both palms when one leg is raised. That&#39;s physically impossible unless you shift your weight to one side, since for instance you only have 1 support on left side (left leg raised) and 2 supports on the right with your center of mass in the middle. I&#39;ll bet all viewers must be frustrated with themselves on this step when in reality it&#39;s not really something that is achievable.",Brian J,2021-01-08T01:45:21Z,0

"I just started this journey yesterday.. You&#39;re right, there&#39;s a lot going on in the world today, but I&#39;m choosing to distance myself from the news and tv for this time of breathing",aurinko,2021-01-07T19:11:41Z,2
"I&#39;ve never commented before, but I started practicing yoga by following your videos sometime last year. It helped me get through the worst moments of isolation and anxiety. I&#39;m commenting today because this particular practice taught me something so new--the concept of arriving with each inhale. As I&#39;ve continued through the other videos of this series so far, I keep coming back to that. Even when I&#39;m not doing yoga--when I start to get stressed or check out I catch myself inhaling and thinking &quot;arrive&quot; and it&#39;s like... a reset button. I come back to myself. And in practice, I use it to bring myself back when my thoughts wander OR to help when I&#39;m meeting my edge and don&#39;t think I can keep going. &quot;Arriving&quot; on that next inhale when my body is shaking is for me, again, a reset that lets me feel like I&#39;m restarting the session even if I&#39;m in the middle of it. SO yeah. Thank you so much for all your videos, for your kind and fun attitude. &lt;3",Alexis Hunter,2021-01-07T19:05:03Z,0

I need this right now. My housemate is also my best friend - I&#39;ve been in love with him for just under a year and told him about this recently only to be rejected. I can feel a shift happening in our dynamic as we adjust to this information and he allows me the space I need to handle this (we&#39;re in the middle of lockdown so can&#39;t leave the house and I also work with him) but I&#39;m just terrified that this is the beginning of the end of our friendship. I&#39;m a little heartbroken of course but the fear of losing the closeness we have is even worse. Having these practices helps ground me a little and access the emotions I&#39;m struggling with at the moment. Thank you for these videos xx,Emily Clayton,2021-01-06T22:14:51Z,0

"I had to pause the vid several times because I can&#39;t support my weight on my hands, it was frustrating but I finished the practice anyway, The most difficult thing besides the physical challenge this means for my body is the mental part where I deal with frustation and lack of tolerance from my own doings, however I decided these were dangerous for me to have and I&#39;m practicing one day at a time to get rid of those toxic attitudes. I showed up on my mat and I have to thank Adriene for doing this with me.",Anne Govea,2021-01-06T15:31:23Z,1

"Adriene, it&#39;s so nice that you offer this (for free) to anyone that is yoga curious.  I&#39;m new to this, and my negative self-talk can start to get in the way (i.e., I&#39;m too old for this, I&#39;m not strong enough, etc.), and it&#39;s encouraging when you validate how something might be aching just as soon as I&#39;m feeling this ache.  I didn&#39;t realize how weak my wrists were until I started this, and the figure eight thing felt so good.  I hope I can continue to &#39;show up&#39; for this, and I feel so much better upon completion of this. Thank you...",ngosztyla,2021-01-06T14:47:02Z,0

"It was focused on each breath is unique and is an arrival to the moment and is a new beginning. So each breath is important and from the get-go, our yoga is started. It focused on the core, strength on hands, and neck stretch which I rested for all 3 for a few seconds since it got really hard while doing mountain climbing while on the plank and then in stretching the neck while hugging the knee to chest.<br /><br />I felt each breath as an arrival because since the first-ever day of my yoga I think I took it seriously and felt it like this. I am energetic and surprised by how comfortable Adriene was with her core strength moves and how heavily I was breathing instead.",Pooya Valinataj,2021-01-06T11:02:55Z,0

This is my 3rd 30-day challenge , well technically 2nd, b/c in 2020 I got pneumonia the first week of January so it all went out the window.  And today, Jan. 5 (day 4 for those keeping track), I just finished the video above (again, for those keeping track, it is day 2!), so maybe tomorrow I will do days 3,4 AND 5?  Probably not, but that&#39;s OK  I will catch up. Or i won&#39;t, and my Valentine&#39;s Day gift to myself will be one of the final videos, LOL!  Point is, it doesn&#39;t matter.  Just show up.  It really IS the most challenging part.  And I have to add - I am LOVING the room you&#39;re in, Adriene, and the view behind you.  It is both calming and &quot;industrial cool&quot; and really sets the tone.  Kudos to whomever scouted it!  Wishing all good things to all reading this, and those that aren&#39;t.

"I don‚Äôt know what I do wrong... Everytime I try for downward dog I just feel pain in the joint connecting my thumb to my palm, and I can‚Äôt seem to get a good stretch from it... My hamstrings are also quite tight so I can‚Äôt get my heels to the ground. Overall, it‚Äôs painful and frustrating because it transitions into other moves. And I can‚Äôt seem to match my breath with Adrienne because it feels so forced and unnatural and I end up out of breath and struggling... Today was frustrating because I couldn‚Äôt flow through it naturally and I ended up tensing and shaking .

"Adriene why are you talking so much during breathwork and meditation? I feel like you are trying to find &quot;healing&quot; words for your community, but it&#39;s still kind of your opinion about life in general. I found that really distracting, when there is no 10 seconds in a row where I can let my own thoughts flow because my mind is automatically thinking about your point of view about life and health and comparing it with mine etc... why should I do so, when I&#39;m trying to release the tense in mind during yoga? Maybe be it&#39;s my fault because I&#39;m always overthinking? I would be glad to hear your opinion on this.",flowerkassy,2021-01-05T10:08:22Z,0

"Got really busy and forgot to do yoga yesterday! So I decided to do this video tonight, and man this video has helped me a whole lot. The idea of arriving with every breath has helped me feel more light and it made me feel as if I have the ability to feel safe in my own head. It sounds strange haha. I needed this because I&#39;ve been dealing with a lot of anxiety since my family and I all ended up having COVID due to my dad being exposed at his work. My anxieties about COVID has made the experience worse, but this video REALLY gave me relief, and it made me feel safe in ways that I haven&#39;t been able to the past few days. Most of all it helped me breathe better (I tend to have shallow breathing when I&#39;m panicking or having anxiety). So thank you thank you thank you Adriene!

"Hey guys! I live in Bozeman, Montana in the US. This is my first 30 day yoga challenge. I am so excited to be a part of this. I read a comment after I finished day 1 that recommended that I take note of how many views there were when I finished that day&#39;s yoga session and then to refresh the video to see how many people were doing the practice at the same time that I was. It was so cool to see that on day 1  I was joining 22,000 other people from around the world doing the same yoga practice. It was so rad!! So today I just finished doing day 2 (I am behind 1 day, but I am being gentle and patient with myself about not having to do it all &quot;perfect&quot; ). The truth is I just practiced yoga with 14,000 other people. So cool!! You should try checking out how many others were doing yoga together virtually with you too :) <br />Take care, enjoy!!

After practicing ujjaji breaths throughout the practice when I was in child&#39;s pose in my own little love cave, I really felt like I was throughly anchoring in my breath and truly in the present moment. I&#39;ve never breathed so deeply before. Breathed right in my upper back as I felt tension there so I focused on that area and my whole upper back cracked when I went back on all fours.

"I counted the seconds for the pose at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaL3YF1vY2k&amp;t=22m16s"">22:16</a> ... it is 35 seconds. How many breaths are then? 15? But should a pose that gets so much tension really be maintained for so long in yoga? I mean lifting on the tip of your foot, the whole weight of the body on the wrists, the muscle of the one leg high... I love this channel so much but sometimes I get the impression that with the talk the practice loses a bit its yoga flow, and becomes something bodily hard. Not saying that hard is bad, but just that it has to have a dimension of righteousness, and those 35 seconds to me say the opposite.",ipercalisse,2021-01-04T21:50:31Z,0

"I love the idea of arriving with every inhale! :)<br />On the one hand, because when I&#39;m arriving in a pose, I&#39;m checking how my body is, if I need to shift something. And I tend to forget that when I&#39;m holding a pose. But with a new arrival/a new beginning every inhale, I&#39;m checking my body parts, my muscels, my mind every time I inhale and therefore do the exercises more precise and definitely more present :)<br />And on the other hand, a new arrival at every inhale also means, that I don&#39;t need to stay, I can walk away at every exhale. And we agreed that showing up is the hardest part.

"I usually skip fetal pose -- I feel so vulnerable in it. Today, I felt strong enough to end with it along with the video. I imagined how we begin in this pose, then grow up tall like seeds, and mammals, and reptiles and -- insects? Maybe insects, too. We begin in this pose. Yes, this video was a challenge -- I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one who felt that! -- but that pressure gave me the space for such a sweet release at the end, like I haven&#39;t been able to do before.

"I&#39;m already a day behind (today is day three but I&#39;ve just finished day 2&#39;s practice) and I felt really bad about it going into this practice, but during the last couple minutes, what Adriene said about just arriving and showing up kind of struck a nerve (in a good way lol) and it was like something clicked in my head. I can&#39;t fully describe it, but my mood completely shifted and now I&#39;m feeling very positive and motivated about this journey. If this happened on day 2&#39;s practice, it&#39;s gonna be crazy to see what happens at the end. Sending much love from Michigan to Adriene and everyone else who is taking this journey.

There‚Äôs nothing I can do about it but the only thing I can control is my breath, how I use it to feel better and stronger. <br />It was a beautiful practice and I love the fact that there are new poses and little exercises that I haven‚Äôt encountered before in my last four years with Adriene.

"Adriene, thank you so much for this practice. The idea of every breath being a new arrival at the present moment, is so empowering.

"The comments saying this video was difficult definitely intimidated me. I waited until nearly one in the morning to finally do this thing, literally putting it off until the last second, but I refused to skip a day due to fear. I am SO GLAD I DID THIS. Honestly, yoga has been annoying me lately. Yoga, typical meditation, all that Jazz, just makes me super irritable. And honestly it‚Äôs been like that all of 2020 and tonight I finally realized that it‚Äôs okay to feel like that. Because I found the source for me is because I‚Äôve spent so long just sitting. Waiting. Breathing through it all- I‚Äôve wanted to ACT. Burn. In all areas of my life.<br /><br />Recently I‚Äôve wanted to lose weight and reset my body so I turned to water fasting like I normally do. I got annoyed with that, so I‚Äôm eating healthy and doing Pilates and 2x yoga- and I feel great. I felt stuck at my job so after SO LONG I  got a new one and now I feel great there too. And so the annoyance I‚Äôve been getting with yoga and meditation is just because I want to DO more, and this video did that for me. <br /><br />A perfect balance of activating muscles üí™ and your brain üß† and ‚ù§Ô∏è. It made me feel like I was DOING something rather than just looking inward. I‚Äôve looked inward for so long that it started staring back at me telling me to do something else. I‚Äôm rambling now with no point so I‚Äôm going to go journal before bed. But YES, do this video. Feel the burn, feel ALIVE.",liljubsy,2021-01-04T08:33:57Z,0

I thought it perhaps better to just rest and skip yoga today, but I wanted to stay committed. I could only do half the practice, the rest spent in child&#39;s pose or hero&#39;s pose, just breathing. Still, I stayed present, arriving with each breath. In the fetal position at the end I was reminded that I am always worthy of arriving to the party, exactly as I am, and that is enough. :) Off to sleep! Thank you Adriene!!

A major goal of mine this year, and with this practice, is to create a more trusting relationship between my mind and my body. I&#39;ve often felt frustrated and saddened by the ways I&#39;ve been a stranger to myself but the reminder that each new birth is an arrival encourages me to honor the ways I will continuously be meeting myself. <br /><br />All of that to say I feel open and emotional and as if I&#39;ve arrived at a new place with myself. I look forward to seeing where I will arrive tomorrow.",Alexis Mayfield,2021-01-04T05:01:21Z,1

"I have two young daughters, and a personal crisis is currently unfolding in my family of origin, so I&#39;ve been up late the last two nights - after everyone else in the house has gone to sleep - in order to keep this commitment to myself and discover how a daily yoga practice would serve me in a different way than my usual sporadic one. So far, so good! I&#39;ve felt great following both so far. Yes, it&#39;s strange to feel like a bit of a yoga ghost in my own home, but I&#39;m trying to carve out space and time for myself, even if the world won&#39;t.",Jenn McKee,2021-01-04T04:57:01Z,3

This could be a weird thing but for some reason I feel more connected and calm when I hear it. Almost emotional, because sometimes things get so busy and hectic in life that I forget to just slow down and listen. The heartbeat is a beautiful thing and I just wanted to recognize and appreciate the sound that keeps us alive.",Aisha D,2021-01-04T04:50:16Z,1

What is the name of the pose where you sit back on your heels with toes curled under? How do you modify it? I can only do it in a kneeing position. I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s my knees or toes (perhaps both?) that won&#39;t permit me to sit back.,Blandyna Williams,2021-01-04T03:27:29Z,0

I believe it&#39;s a variation of vajrasana. I find it too hard on my feet to curl my toes under so I just uncurl them and sit on my ankles/soles.

Also, knowing that I&#39;m completing this practice not only on my own time but also with so many people across the world, brought me back to that feeling of why I love yoga so much. I miss the community of being jammed packed in a hot yoga studio, people stepping on my mat, me stepping on other people&#39;s mats, hearing everyone breathing, sweat everywhere lol but honestly I miss it sooooo much. Hopefully we can back to that soon but for now this journey has already made me feel somewhat back at home. So thank you Adriene and keep the momentum going everyone + don&#39;t forget to breathe &lt;3",Stephanie,2021-01-04T03:24:24Z,1

Hi Julia! I&#39;m assuming you mean pain in the seated meditation pose - I have the exact same issue! Sometimes I find it helpful to place a pillow underneath me so my hips are higher up than my knees. I also often do a sort of cat/cow stretch when I&#39;m seated to give my back a little of a break or even sit against a wall to take some of the pressure off if I really need it. There&#39;s also the option of sitting in a chair too! I hope you had a good practice today :),Abby Fenwick,2021-01-04T03:43:44Z,1

"For the first time in I don&#39;t know how many years, I did not sign up for a mileage based challenge.  I have spent years pushing my body trying to hit 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 miles per year.  Every year I do my best and every year I fail to reach the goal.  Throughout the years I&#39;ve had to overcome pneumonia, knee issues, feet issues, ridiculously long work hours, a head injury, and this year, a torn calf.  The torn calf led me to the Home journey from last year.  Finally I felt peace when I exercised.  After thirty days, my knees, feet, and calf felt better.  The practice didn&#39;t aggravate my injured brain.  I didn&#39;t have to overcome anything.  I just felt good - not as stiff, stronger, and just better about myself.  So this year, I didn&#39;t sign up for any mileage based challenge.  I&#39;m going to focus on yoga and walk three times a week.  I&#39;m going to not push myself through pain.  Imagine that?  I&#39;m going to see what happens when I honor and listen to my body rather than ignore everything it&#39;s trying to tell me.  Today was wonderful.  I am no yoga guru.  I still can&#39;t sweep my leg all the way through to a lunge but I can get to one and do one pretty darn well once I&#39;m there!  Hahaha.  Each day I do my best and for once, I know that this is enough.  I am enjoying the journey.  Thank you Adrienne.

I think it&#39;s the stress, and so when I had the chance to join this 30 days of yoga, I jumped on it.  Granted, I&#39;m on semester break right now, but I still feel so much more relaxed after just two days, and more flexible, too.  Love the focus on breath and new beginnings.  Thanks!",Kim Wright,2021-01-04T02:12:14Z,1

Anyone have some pro tips on how to do these with weak wrists? I‚Äôve never seen a doctor bc money but my wrists suffer a bit from these (not too bad mostly in the moment and a little after so far) and I‚Äôve tried using the front of my knuckles instead of my palms but nothing helps.

"&quot;arrive&quot; is just the theme i needed!! meditation is very challenging and feels unnatural for me, as is simply being &quot;present&quot; - my brain feels like an angry panicked animal that lunges away crazily every time i try to rein it in. so i&#39;ve always shied away from that kind of mindfulness despite knowing how much it might help. but &quot;arrive&quot; is perfect, because implicit in the idea of &quot;arrive with each breath&quot; is the idea that you might have wandered away in the meantime. the emphasis isn&#39;t on <b>staying</b> there, just <b>starting</b> there, getting your foot in the door, over and over and over again. it feels unintimidating and possible. i did this video first thing this morning and i&#39;ve practiced &quot;arriving&quot; all day - as i load laundry, as i microwave food, as i type this comment. just taking a deep breath and arriving where i am, knowing that it&#39;s okay if i float away again a minute later, because i can come back again.  i&#39;m so excited to hang onto this word and keep exploring in the rest of this month.",otempora16,2021-01-04T00:26:53Z,0

"I feel somewhat better reading your recommendation to make showing up on the mat the #1 goal. Today&#39;s session was physically challenging for me. Perhaps a month from now it won&#39;t be.<br />I cannot seem to get Closed Captioning with these sessions. Yes know it seems intuitive that if your face is in mat or eyes closed you cannot read the captions. However through the magic of computers if I feel I am missing something I could rewind and play back.  If I cannot understand what you said the first time its doubtful with my type of hearing impairment that listening twice or a thousand times would matter. I am using wireless headphones along with hearing aids. Hearing loss has removed me from many activities that I used to enjoy. I hope that yoga class isn&#39;t going on the list with:  working as a nurse,  live concerts, Movies at a Theater, enjoying a night out with friends, having a normal conversation around the dinner table.

"I discovered this channel a couple of months ago, so I got really excited about this 30 day challenge! At first, I was a bit concerned that they were longer than I had hoped and wondered if I was gonna be able to take that much time out of my routine. In day 1 and 2, I ended both practices with saying to myself, &quot;oh wow, we&#39;re done already!&quot; It&#39;s great to be able to prove to myself that I can take some time out for myself. Arriving on the mat is certainly the hardest part, but I&#39;ve been spending less and less time trying to talk myself out of it. I&#39;m so excited for the rest of the month! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è",Taylor Laviera,2021-01-03T23:41:25Z,0

"I found it hard to get here today. I‚Äôve been doing your camps since 2016, on and off (mostly off), But I got back into the full swing in august and have done all the yoga camps out so far in preparation for this one. I was so sedentary during the first lockdown that my body started aching from not moving. It feels so weird to have conflicting feelings on coming back to the mat. I know yoga is good for me, I‚Äôve seen the results, FELT the results, and more important than that, I enjoy doing this. But it‚Äôs still hard. I have a lot of days where I catch myself thinking ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do this today‚Äù but I‚Äôve shown up regardless for the past 5 months. I always think this will get easier but I guess it‚Äôs not about it getting easier, just accepting that I do this for me and my wellbeing, and as long as it impacts me positively it‚Äôs worth doing.

At the start of the practices I am noticing some discomfort in my upper back, despite using a blanket under my hips, and I think I am really paying attention to sitting up straight.  Does anyone else have this issue, and if so, what helps with that discomfort at the beginning?",Kristen Brey,2021-01-03T22:12:40Z,0
"I have pain in my back when sitting straight and being still for a long time like in the beginning is very difficult. I try to hold it as long as possible (comfortably) and then do small movements (circles/flex/curve spine) to loosen it up if it gets tight/try to relax and then go back to it when it feels better, in the previous 30 day journey I did, it did improve over time and is all about practice. It&#39;s good to know your limits and incorporate it in so you don&#39;t over do it!",Phoebe Carter-Powell,2021-01-03T22:15:59Z,0

"Good to remember that yoga practice is a metaphor for life and sometimes it&#39;s a literal reminder: Breathe, show up, be flexible, adapt as necessary, take risks, find balance, take a rest, challenge yourself, notice when you&#39;re stressed, notice when you&#39;ve improved, etc. We just need to know when and how to do any of these things at any moment when we listen to our bodies and minds. I write this not from the point of view of being an expert, but because this is what I&#39;m working on.",Dave Edson,2021-01-03T21:26:35Z,0
Thank you! I&#39;ve been busy on a laptop and had a lot of pain in my upper back/shoulder. After this practice it&#39;s totally gone! I love when you say that each breath is a new invitation to arrive!,AdelaideJonesEd,2021-01-03T21:26:13Z,0
"I‚Äôm 69 and was diagnosed with osteoporosis so I put my yoga on hold and began to do a lifting class, BodyPump, by Les Mills, at my club. I also started doing BodyFlow, another Les Mills class. It combines Tai Chi moves with yoga and core work. After 4 months I noticed I had developed tennis elbow. it was painful and I had to stop using it for a few weeks. I decided not to do any more BodyPump classes, and am replacing it with yoga once again. I will continue BodyFlow but NO MORE HEAVY LIFTING. It‚Äôs so sad when we work to get fitter only to injure ourselves. Yoga is so much gentler yet still challenges me. Adriene, your class has been a lifesaver during Covid. I know I speak for a lot of people when I say this. I see that you have become much calmer over the years and seem more mature. I wonder if you will decide to go on a sabbatical to India at some point, lol. I love your funny asides or when you sing a song related to what you‚Äôre doing or saying. As a musician I often think about doing the same thing but find myself holding back. Why? We should all be feeling free to sing whenever we feel it,  but most of us are too uptight, I guess. Anyway, thanks for being your wonderful free-spirited self and let‚Äôs keep doing this for a long long time! SoundCloud: Summerfly,el-and-al",Elizabeth Hudetz,2021-01-03T21:26:05Z,0

"Today I was struck by how arriving in each moment made me forget about whether I was doing something &quot;correctly&quot;. I struggle with perfectionism, and this practise made me come to a realisation that in striving for perfection with sacrifice so much. We sacrifice the present moment, and what really exists, rather than savour it, embrace it, and nurture it. Think of all the thing you don&#39;t notice because you&#39;re think about whteher you&#39;re doing something perfectly. I&#39;m making a commitment to arrive at every moment more often.",Amy Rushent,2021-01-03T21:17:57Z,48

I&#39;ve been practicing yoga for 14 years and there are still some poses I can not do.  It&#39;s about being present and the breath.   You just keep practicing.  Try the pose a little bit every time you practice.  Modify when you need.  Someday, you might get it.   There are some poses that I can do now that I couldn&#39;t do when I first started.  I just laughed like &quot; Ya right, sure!&quot; .   Then one day, I did it!   Just breath, do what you can.  That is all that matters.",Shell S,2021-01-04T01:52:07Z,3

Sometime, I just move my body to take a book or head to the kitchen or doing some daily basic activities, the bones cracked. Is that the normal phenomenon for a yoga beginner?

Today I felt the power of breath. These 2 days have been hard. The hardst part hasn&#39;t been showing up but too keep going. My mind just keeps telling me that it is hard and that it wants too stop or get out of the pose. But halfway thru the video the arriving with a new breath started to work. And I was able too quiet my mind and just breathe and stay in the pose. Thethat last plank made it really hard. But I made it!,Miranda,2021-01-03T18:50:49Z,0

One or more of my kids will also show up and craw underneath my downward dogs, or snuggle into my lap when I am finding my breath to watch and learn what moms yoga is all about.

"Day 2 of practicing with hypermobility (possible and very likely hEDS- a connective tissue disorder which manifests in hypermobile joints (frequent dislocations) and skin, and other symptoms like heart palpitations, digestive issues, chronic pain and fatigue that can be more harm than good when it comes to exercise like yoga, which is often given as a recommendation if you experience chronic pain (as it was given to me when I was told I had fibromyalgia, as no one had noticed my hypermobility), as those with hypermobile joints can very easily overextend these joints or destabalise them, making them feel worse, rather than finding the practice useful and soothing, there&#39;s a confusion between flexibility and hypermobility, something I didn&#39;t understand for a long time and I&#39;m still getting used to with my new awareness of my symptoms and my joints.))- I&#39;m doing this as not only do I want something to help me bring awareness to my breath, but to my body, and how I can modify practices to make sure I don&#39;t cause my body more injury. Today I:<br />- cried at the very beginning with the &#39;arrival of breath&#39; and welcoming it etc- yay for emotional release<br />- halfway through the practice I put my wrist braces on, as I was feeling a lot of pain and strain in them- they&#39;re the soft types, without a metal insert. these did help marginally but did hinder putting my whole hands on the ground, and didn&#39;t stop strain being put on my fingers as they&#39;re only support for the wrists)<br />- put a blanket under my knees at all times, whether I was in a tabletop position, or straightening my legs to make sure I wasn&#39;t overextending or putting stress on my knees. I also in the sitting down forward fold didn&#39;t keep my knees on the ground or blanket as I knew I can do that- but in doing so overextending my knees, so I bent them instead to keep them safe)<br />- tried to be mindful of where my hands were in relation to my shoulders (very difficult), and where my shoulders were in relation to my ribs and neck and ears (weird way to put it but basically- was my shoulder still where my shoulder should SAFELY be, not where it could go if I let it)<br />- tried to be mindful of always keeping the slightest of bends in the elbow, making sure my elbows didn&#39;t over extend <br />- took frequent breaks, even if it meant I missed a move or two- I know yoga is useful for building strength, but I also kept in mind that pain doesn&#39;t always necessarily equal that building of strength, and could mean the move isn&#39;t a wise choice for my body<br />- I can&#39;t use my fingers to prop myself up as they&#39;re very hypermobile, so attempted to use my whole hand (keeping a slight bend in the elbow) or with my hand in a fist, on my knuckles<br />- managed the whole session with only one actual pause of the video- whereas yesterday I needed several<br />all of this was done at the expense of not keeping my thought on the breath at all times, because it&#39;s quite a task trying to keep track of everything, but I think I&#39;ll keep going with the wrist braces, and keep them in the braces before and after the session, and keep an eye on them, as well as my fingers, elbows and shoulders, which do hurt a bit more than I think they should, especially my fingers, to see if too much stress has been put on them already. If I find they&#39;re injured ice and rest shall be applied. I think I did much better than I did yesterday in terms of noticing things I could do to improve my experience, keep my body safe, even if it wasn&#39;t exactly how it was instructed, or took away from my awareness of breath, because at the end of the day, can&#39;t breathe if the body can&#39;t quite breathe with it y&#39;know? I have no clue if anyone will read this or anyone with hypermobile joints specifically will and has any advice or finds this helpful but I was told for YEARS before I knew hEDS was a possibility and I was hypermobile that my chronic pain could basically be cured very magically by exercise- specifically yoga, by doctors and friends and physio and pretty much everyone, and it wasn&#39;t until someone noticed I was hypermobile I realised that I was doing myself a disservice because I was overextending everything while doing this exercise, leading to much more pain, and that my body was not compatible with yoga- but I&#39;m attempting to find out if I can MAKE yoga compatible, if I can become aware of which of my joints do what, what symptoms flare during or after, how can I fix that etc.",lxlliby,2021-01-03T18:39:20Z,0

"I think I am finally accepting that, right now, with the current state of my body, I cannot do these yearly 30 day journeys. No amount of props or modifications will make 30 days of very active flows accessible to me at this time. I cried 3 times out of frustration doing day 1 yesterday and today had to skip about 20 minutes of the 37 minute video today, and have had very potent feelings of guilt and anger because the same thing has happened every January the past few years; where I am unable to do these classes and still receive the daily email which just felt like a daily reminder of what I can&#39;t do. For the first time, though, thanks to Adriene&#39;s guidance, the comments section, and my own growth, I am able to identify all of this. Instead of anguishing that I can&#39;t participate in the BREATH journey with ease I am going to pivot and instead commit to 30 days of Adriene&#39;s relaxing/cozy/restorative practices. I will be cheering y&#39;all on and joining when I can, but for now I am looking forward to 30 days of gentle yoga &lt;3",Em Adele Oppman,2021-01-03T18:28:35Z,1

I have always struggled with discipline and the part of showing up. But this has already become a very relaxing habit at night where I just light up my candles and arrive on the mat to share this practice and after I am finished I read the comments which motivate me even more. Loving this series by far and I am very excited for whats about to come. :) Thank you Adriene and everyone for leaving such nice and positive comments for me to read after practice.

I found this was a good way to keep my mind focused on being present and I had less moments where I was trailing away in my thoughts!

My goal for 2021 has been to get my health and strength back on track. I&#39;ve been doing Adrienne&#39;s videos for a while to build up the basics. This is my first time doing it live with everyone and it&#39;s so great to see such an active community here.,Courtney Stearns,2021-01-03T17:54:31Z,1

I‚Äôve known that every day was a new beginning, every moment was a new beginning but  every breath a new arrival really helps to clarify the power of now and that we have. <br />I came across this practice over a month ago when being a lifelong athlete, I couldn‚Äôt workout due to a surgical procedure but my mind and body needed something. What a gift this has been at this point in my life, and it is exactly what I needed as we look to grow in all areas of our lives.

"The idea of treating each breath as a new arrival really resonated with me today. Whether it&#39;s because of exhaustion or impatience, sometimes these longer videos can be a struggle for me. I get caught up in thinking about how long it&#39;s been, what I need to get done today, that I don&#39;t have it in me to finish, etc. But by choosing to arrive new, I can think of this time as a collection of valuable moments. I&#39;m not &quot;getting through&quot; the video, I&#39;m continuously beginning something new. And it always helps to use those moments to remind myself that this is the most important thing I&#39;ll do for myself all day. Thanks for this one, Adriene!!",Maili Knox,2021-01-03T17:47:08Z,0

"Today was especially difficult to arrive on the mat (hard PMS day) but I&#39;m happy I still showed up. Today, arriving with my breath meant that with each pose that felt impossible, or each moment where I felt like I wanted to stop, I would approach each &quot;new arrival&quot; as if it was my first pose of the day, my first movement of the day. That helped me ease so much into it without feeling any judgment if I got any previous poses wrong or had to cut them short cause my body could only handle so much.

After completing the practice I&#39;m starting to accept that I have plans today, and it&#39;s not an injustice to keep moving forward. One breath at a time, I can arrive in the present moment, and I can still mourn and honor past events while living my present life.

Lovely practice. I left my leg on the floor for the low lunge and managed to just sustain the plank. After doing yoga every day for the last few months my strength has improved dramatically.

I am realizing I am enough to be present and to try. Thank you Adrianne for motivating me on this journey!,Marwin Davies,2021-01-03T16:55:11Z,0
"Showing up is definitely hard when you know that you need to carve out another niche of time among all the other to do‚Äôs on your list. However our bodies are God‚Äôs temple, so they need to be taken care of. Last plank was difficult.  Stayed almost to the end and then dropped down to a modified plank.

"As a professional musician (flutist), the theme of this 30 day journey early speaks to me.  Breath is essential to living fully but also to playing my flute.  Normally at this time of year, I‚Äôm busy rehearsing and performing, but because of COVID, I‚Äôm unemployed and searching for a musical outlet.  These two days have already been physically challenging for me, even though I‚Äôve practiced yoga for many years.   However, so far, it‚Äôs helped me to focus and stay calm and feel good during this time of isolation.

"Reading everyone&#39;s comments is like a warm embrace. I have been struggling with body issues lately and to see people with such kind comments saying &quot;we&#39;re in this together!&quot; or like &quot;yoga isn&#39;t a competition. honor your body, mind, and soul&quot; made me shed a tear. Yoga may be seen as another source to strengthen the body but people forget that it also strengthens our mind, heart, and soul. To be honest, it is rare to find good yoga videos that help us relax, meditate, and be present. Most of the time it is for &quot;vigorous&quot; exercises or simply sequences to just do the poses, never attending to our minds and feelings. I know it&#39;s just  a matter of preference but I feel like people should also take the time to be mindful of our thoughts not just do chaturangas and whatnot. This is a biased comment but I do hope people rlly spare time to notice their feelings and thoughts than their physical actions. Im truly grateful for YWA and its community. They teach us to honor our feelings whilst doing yoga. I love that!! sorry if sound pretty demanding I would consider myself bad at expressing myself but I hope my intentions are clear üòÖ have an awesome 2021!!",sunnie tyler,2021-01-03T15:52:10Z,0

"day 2<br />jan 2, 2021 <br />11:29 PM<br />---- üåû---- <br />Today&#39;s practice was an eye-opener. I realized what my problem really was: &quot;stuck and dwelling in the past&quot;. Back in early 2020, I exercised daily, did yoga daily, ate healthy foods, drank plenty of water until more food and celebrations came in. I realized how ungrateful i was. I didn&#39;t see them as blessings. I saw them as objects that &quot;ruined&quot; me, things that would make me &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;unhealthy&quot; when in fact, it was just the feeling of guilt. I didn&#39;t want to admit that I enjoyed the delicious food. And then I stopped doing my daily habits, came the mental break downs and such. I hated myself. &quot;Why can&#39;t I be the way I was before? I was smaller and prettier&quot; I tried exercising again but the thoughts of failing just came back. I was so invested in the past and what my imaginable future could look like that I didn&#39;t realize where I truly was, the present moment. It made me so lost. so It was my resolution for the new year&#39;s to go back to my old ways. Little did I actually know, those old ways were self-destructive. I only wanted to go back to my old ways to look &quot;prettier&quot; This practice really reminded me that it is not to go back to old ways and to embrace the present moment and breathe in for a new start. NEW START. I was so deep in the past. An exit was not to be found. but this practice made me escape. Thank you Adriene for giving me a door to open and ARRIVE in my new beginnings. Much love from the Philippines!",sunnie tyler,2021-01-03T15:41:05Z,0

"It&#39;s absolutely true that showing up is the hardest part and for sure it&#39;s hard for me to find that motivation every single day. Here&#39;s a tip that I sometimes use to make myself commit to those &#39;hard&#39; things like showing up for yoga or doing daily piano practice, for example. That is - just roll out your mat / sit down and decide to do 5 minutes. Literally just five minutes. Most likely you&#39;ll keep going and do the whole thing, but lets say it really isn&#39;t your day and everything is too hard - worst case you&#39;ve done 5 minutes of breathing and neck rolls or 5 minutes of scales (or whatever). How bad is that? Of course it&#39;s not perfect but even 5 minutes is better than nothing at all. Hope that helps! x",Alexandra Panico,2021-01-03T15:28:56Z,0

I&#39;m in a new place with a rink not too far from me, and my 2021 goal is to rebuild my strength and my skills and continue to progress in skating, because I miss it a lot. Last time I did yoga somewhat consistently was weekly yoga at the rink, but that was years ago.

That is a challenge for many. You are not alone. Let the thoughts roll in and then let them go and focus on your breath. Take these few minutes each day just to be with your self and not your to-do list. x,Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-03T16:28:52Z,0

"The reminder to &quot;arrive&quot; is one I also read recently in a technique for grounding when you&#39;re experiencing acute anxiety. You quietly tell yourself your name, what time it is, where you are, and that you are okay. It&#39;s like arriving at calm in the midst of chaos. Locating that spot even when I&#39;m feeling uncertain about sensations or postures during the practice is helpful. üíñ",Carrie Meadows,2021-01-03T14:14:03Z,2

"Practiced with almost 4,000 people today, wow! I was feeling very distracted and lost today and kept pushing the practice for later. But then I just firmly decided that I&#39;m gonna do this and arrived on my mat. The hardest part is to show up, this keeps getting reinforced time and again. Throughout the practice there were moments I was distracted, and Adriene would mention to arrive with the breath and I&#39;d feel myself step back into the practice.

"Wow! I have been inspired by you to build my daily yoga practice now for the past five years ever since I believe what was your first 30 day challenge and today just blew me away even more than ever, which at this point I didn&#39;t think possible! For the past year I have been focused on building my soul biz, The Joyous Parent yes, in the middle of a pandemic and have had so much self doubt, uncertainty, shame for having &quot;abandoned&quot; my fellow educators in the classroom and moving around with a lot of proving energy and fear of failure. But today, when you said to simply celebrate a new beginning with each breath, I was finally and miraculously and simply able to just drop into the amazing miracle and overflowing gratitude of the wonder of what I get to do each day, even each moment. I got to the point by the end of this video that each breath was like &quot;wow, how amazing is my life!&quot; &quot;Wow, I&#39;m so blessed&quot; &quot;wow, this moment is full of so much magic and glory too!&quot; - and I realized, what a gift, if I am able to approach my biz building like THAT, then imagine how much more impact my work and passion will be for others because I will just be in celebration mode of the every amazing, beautiful, imperfect, terrifying moment of putting myself out there and embracing what comes back... I feel able to take the lessons on the mat off of it and into real life on a whole new level. And who knows what will be?! Maybe I just get to be me in this moment, and now in this moment again, and in every moment I say thank you thank you thank you for the gift of this new breath and hello to what might be and become! So thank you. From the bottom of my hear and the top of it and ALL the parts of it. Thank you!!",Sivanne Lieber,2021-01-03T12:26:59Z,0

"Had to look up the poem Adriene mentioned. Perfect for today and a good reflection for every day.<br /><br />THE GUEST HOUSE <br /><br />This being human is a guest house.<br />Every morning a new arrival.<br />A joy, a depression, a meanness,<br />some momentary awareness comes<br />as an unexpected visitor.<br /><br />Welcome and entertain them all!<br />Even if they are a crowd of sorrows,<br />who violently sweep your house<br />empty of its furniture,<br />still, treat each guest honorably.<br />He may be clearing you out<br />for some new delight.<br /><br />The dark thought, the shame, the malice.<br />meet them at the door laughing and invite them in.<br />Be grateful for whatever comes.<br />because each has been sent<br />as a guide from beyond.<br /><br />‚Äî Jellaludin Rumi,<br />translation by Coleman Barks",Rachel Stoparczyk,2021-01-03T12:17:06Z,0

"The past two months have been my longest break from yoga in two years, then the last week was extremely difficult because my cptsd somehow got triggered and I had a major breakdown followed by nightmares every single night. I feel so lost and broken, but I am trying to believe that I deserve to be found. This is what this year&#39;s journey means to me, a leap of faith. It is hard to have faith in myself and it is hard to show up because I feel rusted. But it helps so much to know that I am not alone in this. If I wouldn&#39;t have felt the support of this global community of amazing people, I couldn&#39;t find the motivation to get back on the mat. <br /><br />   So I just wanted to thank everyone here and share my love üíô And thanks to you Adriene for making this possible, for your kind guidance, and for your inspiring grace üôè",Z√ºmra Dil≈üah √ñks√ºz,2021-01-03T09:43:10Z,49

Well, I made it through to mountain climbers, adjusting as I do in senior fashion and transitioning to our backs was a joy. A lovely wind down, super stretchy.

"2020 has been my year of hell. After more than 7 years of struggling in my studies and work, I decided to listen to my body and STOP. What followed was of course a breakdown of my body and I was diagnosed with severe, pent up, burnout. I have lain in bed for weeks. Then the pandemic happened. During those weeks in bed thinking, a lot of unresolved childhood trauma caused by skipping grades in school came up. Then, last december, in the space of just 10 days, my grandma died, my dog died and my father, not yet 60 years old, was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I spent NYE sobbing my heart out. What was supposed to be my year of healing dug my even more into the mud. <br /><br />My former strong and fit body has been reduced to a quivering mess with VERY tight muscles and more than once I had to stop today because it was too hard or because relaxing caused me to sob again. But I am determined to make it through, however many breaks and modifications it might take. Showing up, every day, to do something for myself in these mountains of grief. Healing in 2021 is my goal.

"This was a tough one if you&#39;re not in full health or have injuries. So remember yoga is for health. It&#39;s not an exercise or competition.  Poses are shown with variation and props.  So I do mountain pose instead of plank. With downward dog I use my bed, to put the arms on. If this is hard, use a table. For lunges,  you can either have the stretched leg on the floor. You can also do warrior one. With changes I could do the whole program today too. Now I have breakfast and then I rest. Take care and have lovely sunday.",Lotta Larsson,2021-01-03T06:47:20Z,1716

Wow I can&#39;t believe that I forgot that Adriene uploads everyday this month. <b>chefs kiss</b>,Just Some Darling in the Franxx,2021-01-03T06:11:19Z,36
I discovered this channel back in March and managed to do over 250 days in a row before taking a break. It&#39;s been a life-changing experience and I&#39;m so grateful to Adriene and everyone in this community for helping me get through 2020. This is the first time I&#39;m doing the monthly series in real-time and it feels so great and fresh! I love that Adriene introduces new practices and movements in each series and I&#39;m looking forward to what BREATH brings. Love to all &lt;3,Supriya Naidu,2021-01-03T06:09:57Z,37
"Hey I‚Äôve been doing this daily since March too! Absolutely love this practice and community, Adrienne is definitely the best . I‚Äôve also been doing a 30 minute speed walking / dance practice and I feel better than I have in years. I‚Äôm 66 and in the Uk. Love to all. üòä",Louise Simmonds,2021-01-03T10:13:07Z,1
@DeadwoodSD1876 good luck to you! That‚Äôs a fantastic goal. The only reason I stopped was because I felt like I was putting too much pressure to do yoga even if I didn‚Äôt totally feel like it that day. It‚Äôs important to listen to your body and feelings and take a break once in a while :),Supriya Naidu,2021-01-03T06:48:27Z,2
