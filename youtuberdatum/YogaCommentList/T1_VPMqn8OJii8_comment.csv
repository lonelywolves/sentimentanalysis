I love your videos and my dog Kub always joins me too.  I&#39;ve learned that this is yoga &quot;practice&quot; not yoga &quot;perfect&quot; and that good things take time.  I&#39;m so pleased with my progress so far.  My wrists and neck are hurting so much less.  Thanks!,Janice LaPlante,2020-12-09T22:47:51Z,0

I look forward to my yoga sessions in the morning, I never dread it. I’m most surprised by what I have gained spiritually. I feel lighter after your sessions and I feel at peace.

"For some reason, I performed nearly this entire sequence with my eyes closed. SUPER intense and what a way to really connect with your body and your energy flow.

"At the beginning of today&#39;s class, I could not stand firm with my feet together. Towards the end, when you asked us to stand with our feet together on the last pose, I felt more grounded and I felt proud of myself! <br /><br />It was my first time to hear the saying &quot;The mat is your reflection&quot;. When noticed that I had a harder time grounding or keeping my balance when I closed my eyes compared to when I gazed on somewhere, I realized that it somehow reflected my extroverted personality. At that point I realized the saying was true. It is a constant challenge for me to find grounding in life on my own and without other people. It is more natural for me to try to look out for other&#39;s opinion than to reflect on my own experiences and opinion. It is honestly not a bad thing that I am this way, but I would like to take it as a challenge to learn to let go, trust myself more and find grounding on my own. <br /><br />Like what I said before, I saw how I improved from the beginning to the end of today&#39;s class and I felt proud of myself. I remember that each individual goes through life and grows as a person at their own pace, like me, and so I should respect mine. Thank you for your guidance Adrienne!",Jemimah Publico,2021-01-16T04:37:06Z,1

"This is my first time going through a committed yoga practice, and I am learning so much! One of the things I have begun to find myself doing is trying to find what feels good and comfortable in my body as a yoga beginner and as someone who is in a larger body. Instead of feeling frustrated, I&#39;ve been searching for modifications or adjustments I can make so I feel supported but also am able to get something out of each pose! <br /><br />That being said, the cross-legged fold actually gave me a lot of difficulty! I have larger thighs, so when I crossed my legs I could only go so far, and I end up with no space between my two feet. This gave me a really tiny base to work with, and I felt wobbly and like my back knee in each move was really strained because I couldn&#39;t give it any bend. <br /><br />Does anyone know what I&#39;m talking about? Any ideas on how you would change the pose to give a wider base? I could barely keep my balance!",A Colon,2020-11-05T12:02:17Z,0

Loving the practice. Always struggle with at home exercising cuz I loose discipline and get bored doing it alone.

But I couldn&#39;t concentrate, I couldn&#39;t work towards any of those goals. I just didn&#39;t feel like it.<br />But today I&#39;m back in our journey. I just love how Adrienne assumed I was here yesterday and wasn&#39;t judging me for taking this long pause. Coming back to this routine, hearing her voice, seeing Benji and going through the practice kinda felt like coming back together. I cleaned my home and I&#39;m going to keep working on my story in a minute. All because <i>my</i> story, my life is coming together. What can I say? Thanks for making me <i>feel home</i> again.

"Coronaquest Day 10: As sure as night follows day, I&#39;ve had a short downer phase following a week of anxiety, which also meant skipping 2 or 3 days of yoga in favour of late nights, computer games and chocolate ice cream. Doing yoga this morning after a full night&#39;s sleep is a positive step. Adriene&#39;s little breathing in and out metaphor felt very relevant, plus it was another good one for the legs after all that running and cycling. I could have used another 5-10 minutes, maybe a goal from the remaining 20 days would be to have an idea intuitively what positions would do me good. Also if I keep on at this rate I won&#39;t be done for another couple of months! But not the end of the world. Greetings from Switzerland",hypodemicnoodle,2020-04-15T07:13:07Z,3

"Lovely Day 10. As you asked us to place our hands over our hearts, I felt the fast beating of my own heart and the warmth from my hands, and my mind was brought to those suffering from COVID-19. I felt how precious my own beating heart, being able to breathe deeply, and to be aware of all of this is. I love the quote from one of your first emails, &quot;People say we&#39;re all seeking a meaning for life. I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s what we&#39;re really seeking.  I believe we&#39;re seeking an experience of being alive&quot;~Joseph Campbell. I feel grateful to notice my being during these practices, I feel grateful for being alive.

"Hi Adriene!  I wanted to say &quot;thank you&quot; for this gift of yoga you have given to me.  When the coronavirus concerns began and my gym closed, I couldn&#39;t imagine going through this time without yoga.  So I went on youtube and found you!  I&#39;m on Day 10 of your 30 Day Home Journey and it has been such a blessing!  And who doesn&#39;t need Grounding at a time like this?!!   I do your Home series each day and then I pick whatever bonus class of yours I&#39;m feeling like I need that day...yogi&#39;s choice I guess you&#39;d call it!  :)  Anyway your humor, heart and gift of yoga has helped me tremendously at this time to stay healthy, strong, grounded, centered, optimistic...I could go on and on!  I HIGHLY recommend your yoga classes especially during this global pandemic.  What a gift!  THANK YOU!

Hi Adriene I&#39;m from Italy and with all the caos that is happening here with the coronavirus your videos are helping me to reduce all that stress that has been building up. I&#39;m really glad that I have started this 30 days journey with you (even if I&#39;m 2 moths late). Thank you!,Barkissa Nonni,2020-03-12T09:44:57Z,4
"This practice brings up so many things for me, it&#39;s amazing... I get emotional at the end of each session. I really have no idea why, but something about your energy, about the fact that I made it another day makes me really proud of myself and so, so grateful to you! I love you ♥️",Andreea Elisei,2020-03-12T07:27:31Z,0
"I was really struggling with my anxiety today and this just so happened to be today’s video for where I am in this series. Feeling grounded is such an important part of dealing with anxiety. I almost didn’t come to the matt today because I just wanted to curl up in a ball, but I’m so glad I showed up. It didn’t “cure” my anxiety, but it has definitely played a part in making it feel less dominating and more manageable. Thank you for these practices and taking it beyond the movements. It helps so much and has become a part of my day to which I look forward.",Meghan Garland,2020-03-11T18:31:20Z,0

"I had an odd morning: was woken up at 3:30am, then I slept past my own <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPMqn8OJii8&amp;t=5m15s"">5:15</a> alarm to wake up 30 min later, running late.  Went to walk my dog, but she got distracted by all the other dogs out &amp; about so she couldn&#39;t do her business &amp; subsequently pooped in the house when we got back.  Then, when I go to start the video, I was put off by a standing start (one of my favorite things is sitting cross legged with you) and then the video started. <br /><br /><br />Somehow, Adriene, you know what I need even before I do.  Thank you for reminding me to stay grounded in my own self and leading me on the search for inner peace.  After my time with you, this hectic morning was nothing I couldn&#39;t handle.  It won&#39;t derail my day now.  Thanks, Adriene. :)",Madzilla1010,2020-03-03T11:53:40Z,0

I can&#39;t do it everyday, working two jobs and being a full time college student, but on the days that I don&#39;t have enough time I feel a little different. Then I come back on the matt, and after my practice, I know what the problem was! My biggest problem is paying attention, and getting through the breathing exercises. I have massive ADHD and I absolutely hate sitting/ standing for a period of time because my mind starts to wonder so much, and I get distracted by literally everything in my room. I typically end up skipping some of the breathing exercises that consist of just sitting or standing, but I want to get through it. Any suggestions?",Ann Clifton,2020-01-27T02:18:26Z,0

"Here lately I&#39;ve been feeling like I&#39;ve been &quot;carrying someone else&#39;s groceries&quot; and have been angry and upset about it. Mad that I&#39;m the one doing that and it always seems to fall to me. <br /><br />Adriene, you talking about doing this practice, this move, so that we can carry our own groceries &quot;when we&#39;re 80&quot; and &quot;someone else&#39;s groceries too&quot; was so powerful for me. I needed to hear that. I do keep myself strong (and we all know I don&#39;t mean just physically). I work with my mind and body to grow and persevere.  Others do not do that. Others don&#39;t have the time energy, discipline, softness, love that I do. No one will be like me, no one, ever. This sentiment allowed me to be grateful that I can, am able, and willing to carry someone else&#39;s groceries. My original reason, intent is out of love that I do it Thank you for reminding me of that.<br /><br />&quot;The mat is a mirror.&quot; So true. How I treat myself, how I really think, how I really feel... when I&#39;m on the mat, I see it. Truthfully, lovingly. I once told someone that my yoga, my mat is my church. And it is. I gain clarity, strength, and cultivate self love and awareness of my mind, body and soul on my mat. This practice, for me, is for life. And I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. <br /><br />Love you, Adriene and Benji. Thanks for being a big part of this journey. Namaste",Merissa Kelley,2020-01-23T16:58:09Z,0

"This was so hard, I find it hard to ground myself mentally as well - always living in my head, be it daydreams or anxiety. So this was super challenging but I think the right thing to do. I feel like with only meditation it makes me overthink and overworry even more, but with yoga I can concentrate on not just my mind but the movement, which is fantastic.",TheJoulification,2020-01-18T21:04:18Z,1

"Day 10, Yay!!  This one was hard on my lower back (I have some issues there); of course it is always possible that I wasn&#39;t doing the poses just right though.  Forward fold with my legs crossed was hard on the knees also.  Did anyone else experience that?  I kept trying to have a slight bend, but they wanted to bend backwards, so that was a little painful.  I am grateful for the practice, though and proud to have made it this far!!  And, I am excited for the coming days!  I have to make myself not peek ahead since I started a few days after; I want to be surprised! :) &lt;3",Anjee Campbell,2020-01-18T02:54:40Z,0

"After what could be a huge disaster for me yesterday evening, having a yoga session with Adriene to wake up to in the morning is a big help. <br>Last night we had really strong winds here in London, and while I was out for classes my window was blown open from its hinges- unfortunately, me being completely stupid I had a 5 litre bottle of water on the windowsill. That got knocked over onto my desk and when I returned home discovered everything completely drenched including the floor. As a result my laptop isn’t turning on- I’m currently leaving it to dry now although I fear I’ve lost all of my dissertation research, all of my documents, and above all, 4 years worth of memories from finishing secondary school to my year abroad. I had also made lots of marathon training vlogs for my charity campaign YouTube channel- they might be gone too... Cloud storage also failed to sync with my files, so it’s all gone horribly wrong. I’m going to try to get my laptop working again later tonight after waiting 24hrs for it to dry. If it’s dead then these last months of university will be quite the challenge. I’m going for a run now and then after will spend the day in the library trying to rewrite my dissertation. Let’s hope this is the low point and that it’s only up from here",Ellis Warren,2020-01-15T09:59:24Z,0

"I really want to like these and appreciate that she does them every day. Definitely a good way to build a practice  However. There are 2-3 minutes at the beginning that are unhelpful and just Adrienne hearing herself talk. Then, throughout the video there is no background music and she talks constantly. Which can be helpful if it’s pose improvements, but instead she talks about her dog, herself, what we probably think of her... this drives me berserk. Additionally, she spends so much time talking about random things that sometimes you’re stuck in a pose. She’ll start to tell you  to do something on your next breath but by the time she is done making a comment about something irrelevant, you’ve taken three breaths in the middle of a pose you can’t finish because Benji walked in the room and threw off the flow.",Mad Brew,2020-01-13T13:17:53Z,1

"These last 2 days have been so enlightening with these yoga practices. I realised i wasnt being as intentional as i could be with my mind and heart during the practice (my mind would get distracted by thoughts racing inside my head). And yesterday&#39;s practice gave me the answer that I am the only person that can truly block my way to everything i could be and i could do in life, because so so many times i choose to believe in fears and hurt. Today i chose to be different, to rewrite the story i was telling myself, to reinvent the perception i have of myself and be in charge of my life again.

Not at all surprised, but these little lesson are teaching me bit by bit how much better daily yoga can make my days.  Thank you Adriene!",Karen Eichenberger,2020-01-12T03:29:45Z,0

That stretch with the crossed legs! Love it! Perfect to relax tense legs before bed. Can’t wait for more. I have already found that my posture in my shoulders is getting better. I gave myself a 30day challenge but I’m considering keeping this up after. Feels great!,nicky5078,2020-01-12T02:13:04Z,0
"I wouldn&#39;t have guessed it, but focusing on my belly button seems to be super important!   This practice really helped relieve my low back and hamstring tension.  This is my third year with Adriene, and I&#39;m still surprised by the ripple effect that daily practice has.  The expansion and contraction of life becomes more evident when I focus on the expansion and contraction of my body during yoga.  Makes logical sense, but it has taken many years of dedicated practice to uncover this level of awareness in my daily life.  More awareness to come?  Now that&#39;s super exciting.

At this point in the journey I have to say this 18 minutes left me wanting. Maybe I wasn’t very grounded but I wanted to move and build some heat and I just didn’t get what I needed today.

Well, I had a hard time staying grounded with the &quot;ankle move&quot;. Yes, it&#39;s hard for me to do so when in difficult times. I told myself &quot;stay grounded, stay grounded, stay grounded, STAYYYY GROUNDED!!!!&quot; only to realize that I was only focused on how hard it was instead of just firmly planting my feet onto the mat. I guess that today&#39;s lesson is that I need to think about being and stay grounded first and we see what happens afterwards. (I hope I&#39;m making sense!)",Sarah S.,2020-01-11T22:26:10Z,0

I hadn&#39;t realized that I&#39;d had muscles that needed to be stretched out.<br />Last night, I was showing one of my family members some of the moves from day 9 that we did (like the three legged dog) and I successfully held the moves without my exercise gloves. I actually felt no pain and I almost cried when I realized that. I haven&#39;t felt that in years. So, thank you Adriene for helping me get stronger.",Mammon,2020-01-11T20:26:00Z,2

"I love the grounding practice today and really felt how much I am not rooted in my practice or aspects of my life. I am feeling so many benefits of the mirror of my mat reflecting lovingly what I need to bring into my life.  I love that Adriene gently coaxes us to show up with no expectations just be there, breath and see where we are in this moment. I feel different and know that my body is grateful for this energy and attention. I want to show up in my best self and serve - Home Yoga with Adriene and Benji daily is how to do it. <br /><br />I am sure you know already but tomorrow at 5pm GMT /11 AM EST there is a worldwide synchronised meditation for personal and worldwide peace, meditate in any way yoi like for 15 minutes with the goal of creating more peace in each of our hearts, and then naturally, more peace within the world around us. There is an invitation that if you are not able to meditate at that time, to do so anytime that day that is most convenient to you. <a href=""https://m.facebook.com/events/2226302687668047/"">https://m.facebook.com/events/2226302687668047/</a>",Jo Chew,2020-01-11T18:54:19Z,0

"My focus during this 30 Day journey has been to bring intention to the mat for the duration of the practice, and consciously bring my mind back when it roams.  It is amazing how strong this 62 year old is when I focus and bring intention to every pose and transition!  Consistent attention to core, and 4 part equal standing is a game changer!

"This practice was short and sweet. I was able to focus on hugging my lower abs in, building strength. It will help with my anterior pelvic tilt. I saw myself in the mirror the other day and I noticed that in 10 days there are already some physical changes that are happening as a result of this practice. When cleaning my house. I noticed that bending over was easier and I was flexible and strong. Here&#39;s to carrying your groceries and neighbor&#39;s groceries until you are 90! Spiritually I have noticed that when I meditate after these practices, I have a more clarity and presence during my sessions, as my energy is always more balanced after physical yoga.",Terence,2020-01-11T16:24:15Z,0

I needed a practice with ease on my shoulders so this was a great practice today. I also learned a slightly different way of coming up from a forward fold. I always roll up stacking the spine but the idea of really starting with pulling the lower abdominal towards the spine and use that to start the movement is very strengthening and actual less strain on stiff hips. Thank you Adriene for such a lovely practice. Namaste.,Wendy Schlegel,2020-01-11T15:29:31Z,0

"Today I want to focus my energy on being  here now with every sensation, interaction, emotion and lesson. Grounding practices help me to come back down. To feel at home not just in my body but with my surroundings as well. <br /><br />As I have been practicing with more consistency I notice that my dog (who is getting older and who is blind) has started coming up to my mat to sit with me while i do my spiritual practice. I live with relatives that are fighting pretty often and my dog will usually run to me for a comforting presence when that happens. Even though he cant see anymore he can tell when my energy is in a space to come to the mat and he feeds off of it so he can get some relief from his daily pains and struggle. His sweet soul adds an extra motivation to my coming to the mat and it really means the world as I absolutely love the energy animals give off. <br /><br />I&#39;ve even done energy work on him as he gets very anxious and shakey and whenever I see that I will tune in and give him some loving energy. As soon as I feel source energy running out through my hands he stops shaking and gives me kisses. I am grateful for this practice, this journey and for those I can help through showing up for myself. 🙏💖 thank you for helping me to see my own light so I have the opportunity to help others.",Connor,2020-01-11T15:16:02Z,0

"I&#39;m an artist and in the middle of a project that requires me to work everyday for all of January, with deadline the 3rd of February. Before Christmas when I saw you were preparing for the 30 Days yoga challenge I thought to myself that it was something I didn&#39;t have time to this year, because I was so stressed about this job commission. But coming back from Christmas holiday and feeling stiff and and sore in my body because of bad weather and a lot of time spent on the sofa reading (which I love too!) I decided to try a couple of the Home-videos and now I&#39;m on day 10 – woah!! I figured I need to take care of myself and my body also when I&#39;m in a hectic work project because it makes me happier and more focused.

I know I&#39;m going to look and feel fabulous in the dress she&#39;s chosen for me and I&#39;m so looking forward to my birthday as well.  Before I started doing yoga my body was going downhill, lacking shape and flexibility and I was in constant pain.  Six months on I&#39;m thoroughly excited about my life and I&#39;m going to look better on my 50th birthday than I have done in years.

"Thank you so much Adriene for today grounding😍 after not have internet yesterday and missing my daily dose of yoga with Adriene it felt so good to have a grounding practice today. I love yoga to and special with Adriene❤️🙏🏻 had to keep relaxing in my shoulders, so thanks for the reminder from time to time.

"Hi everyone 👋 I love you all and I hope you all get the grounding you need. <br /><br />I most definitely needed this practice 🙏 My energy is really elevated towards the end of the night (maybe because I was asleep during the day lol) but I was just like &quot;man, I need to take off on a hike or something this weekend and ground with nature!&quot; And just then, one of my dear friends texts me to grab a tea and go for a hike! Amazing coincidence. I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of purple colors in my life too lately (last year it was green, this year even my journals are purple...maybe a chakra correlation?).<br /><br />I joked that this past few weeks, I was surrounded by too many fire, earth and water signs, and not enough air, and, man I could feel the drain. My friend happens to be a ♎, and I was like man nature just knows when to send balance. And then this practice happens! Are you a Libra too? Lol jk. Namaste 🙏",Jay-Ram Rajendra,2020-01-11T08:25:50Z,0

"In addition to the sponsorship, she’s been a professional instructor for years. Instead of having a full closet of office-appropriate attire (like me), her work wardrobe happens to require athletic wear. If you view tons of her videos, series, and membership courses, you’ll notice that she does re-wear pieces.
