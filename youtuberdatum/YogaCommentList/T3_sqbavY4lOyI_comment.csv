"For some reason today&#39;s practice was incredibly difficult for me. I showed up ready to go but as it went on I found myself frustrated with feeling too tired to complete almost any of the poses, feeling off balance, sometimes just plain feeling stubborn and not wanting to do the parts of the practice. But I tried to remind myself to take a breath and arrive again and that every day will be a little different. I think at the beginning of this if I had had a day like this I&#39;d have given up but now I feel like maybe today is just a little unbalanced for me and tomorrow I&#39;ll show up and try again.",Acacia,2021-03-01T13:45:52Z,2
"That. felt. so. freakin. good. oh my god. I felt so terrible today and sickly, but I always put my practices right before bed so I can do meditation and yoga at the same time.

"That moment of &quot;Yes, I will let go&quot; brought me to tears today. I have never had such anxious feelings during such a calm, wonderful practice. I had to pause in the middle of the video to stop and pray and think about what these feelings were coming from. Fear, fear of what others think of me. It is a feeling that I come back to again and again. It oftentimes feels like I cannot let go, that it is a part of me rather than just something that I struggle with--so I am choosing the word Yes. I will let go of that which no longer serves me. Thank you",Valaya Hart,2021-02-01T16:02:33Z,1

Feeling very emotional because the last move to lift my legs with the strength of my core was not something that I have been able to do but I did today!  I really feel the difference in my core since I’ve been showing up everyday no matter what and now I see how my body is changing and getting stronger. I am so overweight which makes me sad but doing this everyday has helped me feel better about myself and confident that I will get stronger and therefore start losing the unhealthy weight.

Towards the end, when we did the Little bridge pose and when you asked to  &#39;slowly lift the heel&#39;  - for some funny reason, my mind received this as &#39;lift your leg&#39; .<br />And I actually did 🤣 and I was there, lifting one leg up in a bridge, not sure what I was doing, trembling &amp;  saying  &#39;Mama Adriene&#39; for a few seconds and then I came down to see what you were doing. I started giggling alone when I saw you lifting your HEELS &amp; continued. 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️<br />I LOVE these lil silly moments 🥰<br /><br />Much love and blessings to all of you 💖",Love And Light,2021-01-27T02:17:25Z,0

"I wanted to comment this before even starting today.  I just finished day 16 and enjoyed it but was struggling with some distraction.  I finally figured out it was because I was wearing shorts, and don&#39;t have the most comfortable body image relationship with my legs.  I thought maybe I should power through this practice and sort of force some love on my legs, but instead I decided to be comfortable, because this is my time for me, and throw on some nice sweats that I like the look of myself in more.  Basically what I&#39;m trying to say is yes, body love is important, but you can also make it easier to love your body 💕",Abigail Kerr,2021-01-24T14:10:21Z,2

"Day 17: HECK yes.<br /><br />One thing that I really, truly value about these practices is that there&#39;s no way (short of skipping ahead in the video, but we don&#39;t do that here) to make them go any faster than they&#39;re going to go.  The practice is 32 minutes long, and whether I put my all into it or I slack off the whole time, I am still going to spend 32 minutes on this practice.  I have looked at the clock and determined that I have those 32 minutes to spend.  There is nowhere else for me to be in that time, and nowhere else I CAN be, and it takes so much pressure off my need to GO FAST.<br /><br />Adriene said something early-ish in this practice about how we weren&#39;t technically doing ratio breathing, but we could think about it, and I think that ended up being incredible for my focus and presence in this session today.  By speeding up my breathing in a rhythmic way sometimes, I was able to slow it down others, without feeling caught or behind or desperate.  No, I wasn&#39;t always exactly on pace with Adriene all practice.  I was on pace with MYSELF, in a steady sort of way that felt really really good.  (Isn&#39;t it amazing how, when I do the breath things that this entire sequence is about doing, the sequence goes better.)<br /><br />A really good yoga day.  We&#39;re a couple of days behind and we&#39;re going to stay a couple of days behind, and maybe I&#39;m going to move to every other day or five days a week or whatever for the second half of the month, but I&#39;m doing it for ME.  And it feels good.",Clarity C,2021-01-21T21:06:19Z,18

"For some reason, I only had audio and black screen when I was doing this video and the whole time I was thinking that Adriene intentionally left in only the audio and that it’s such a brilliant idea to help us bravely EXPLORE what it feels like in our own bodies and not see what it should look like! It was only when I was reading the comments that I realized that no one else experienced this and that it was just an error on my youtube😂<br />I’ve been doing YWA for years and now can’t live without the physical and mental care that you get from doing yoga!

Until yesterday I didn&#39;t really realize I could breathe slower, muuuch slower :D. Like in count to 8. And I really did! Today, when Adriene said just try to use less breaths, I&#39;m like, okay, let&#39;s do this! And it worked! I was conciously breathing slower during the whole practice, which also helped me to keep my mind focused and not let it wander, like it usually does :).

"I’ve done a few yoga journeys over the years, but this one is my favorite.  I have acid reflux that has impacted my breathing and the breath exercises on this journey have been incredible.  I can breathe deeper than I’ve been able to for some time.  For years I could only take a really shallow breath in cat pose... it’s like I felt blocked.  My lungs couldn’t expand any more.  Today I was in cat pose and I noticed I could breathe fully.  Learning to breathe down instead of up into my shoulders was also really useful.  Thank you! Really truly!",Penny Time,2021-01-20T14:54:11Z,2

"I have been using your videos since the start of the pandemic when I was living alone during lockdown. They have continued to help me bring about more mindfulness, focus, clarity, and calmness to my life since then. I often catch myself when I am feeling stressed, tired or tense and try these breathing exercises, relax my shoulders, jaw and forehead, and instantly feel relief. Tonight I was doing Day 17 and wanted to share my experience. I felt like I had mastered the pose of low lunge with the twist where we raise our arm up the sky (you have it in many videos). But in this video, you explained how we should squeeze our thighs in and feel our pelvis lift half an inch or so. I couldn&#39;t believe how much higher I felt off the ground! One simple move of two muscles and I experienced a dramatic shift in this pose. Your words about finding more space in our moves at first was sort of hard for me to understand. But tonight, in this moment, it seemed to click! I am starting to experience taking up space in different ways, and being more mindful of how my body is feeling and moving at all times. I think this is one of the many reasons why you are so amazing and provide so many people with a great yoga practice - you always know the right thing to say! The right funny thought that we are all currently thinking or addressing the feeling we are all currently experiencing. Or in this case, one small alteration to a move that brings about a huge difference! I know this is a long comment, but I just wanted to share and say how much I appreciate your videos and what you have done for my mental and physical health. Thank you!",Anna Kimmett,2021-01-20T03:11:26Z,1

"I’ve just had a blinding insight when Adrienne invites us to notice (how you feel): <br />Battling depression has left me with a habit of ‘mood monitoring’, which when really low, always seemed a bit pointless. Therapy discourages one from just accepting how you are at a given moment, attributing a negativity to low mood, but positivity to better mood, unless it swings too far to being manic. So, through therapy, was taught that mood is linear, aiming for 0- neither positive nor negative.<br />Through this practice, and with Adrienne’s thought provoking guidance, I now know that this is not the case and I am ‘allowed’ to just notice, leaving me calm and grateful, and able to carry that off the mat.

"There are builders in the next door house and there is this constant loud drilling/sanding sound that was really beginning to annoy me.  I put my yoga on thinking that im never going to be able to do it because of all the noise when suddenly after say 5 minutes I realised that I wasnt listening to the noise any more, I was just listening to Adriene and loving my yoga. It was amazing, like a true meditation.  Thank you so much for everything you are giving us Adriene, especially during these very difficult lockdown days xxx",Marion Exley,2021-01-19T14:45:42Z,0

"This was one of my faves yet! <br /><br />I have been feeling lately that there is this culture of self-numbing brewing - an extreme coping mechanism which hardens us to emotions, sensitivity and authenticity, the things that cause us to overflow and react to this turbulent world climate we live in right now, which we can&#39;t do because we&#39;ll lose that strong facade we need to be able to get through these days of isolation, loneliness, monotony, struggle. <br /><br />The idea of exploring the combustible, fire-y, passionate parts of you without &quot;freaking out&quot; by keeping the breath present and involved in your movement spoke massively to me... and it&#39;s going to be what helps me come out of this pandemic with my emotional, feeling, compassionate self in tact, and not a robotic shell of my former self!<br /><br />Thank you all so much for your words, I am better for reading them x",Kate does Yoga,2021-01-19T06:22:50Z,2

I was playing games on my phone to numb myself, until I remembered that I still hadn&#39;t done today&#39;s yoga. I was about to open another app, and then I jumped off of the couch and set my room, my sanctuary up as I normally do for night time yoga; candle lit, yummy incense burning, video on.. I felt safe, I felt proud, I felt a wave of calm wash over me as I touched my mat. This session cracked the bubble in my chest open at so many stages. Getting up out of shavasana I felt a high that I am still riding as I write this. I am blessed with this practice. I am blessed. I am blessed.",Ruby Hoops,2021-01-19T03:42:25Z,0

I&#39;m bloated and unhappy, and I feel like I wasted this amazing practice today. I&#39;ll definitely retry this one again when January is over because I don&#39;t feel as I showed up as I usually do. I barely showed up, and could not do most of the practice without feeling like I was about to throw up. I know it&#39;s not a bid deal, at least I had a meal, but I enjoy those practices so much and I feel like I betrayed myself today. :( hope tomorrow will be better.",eliee4,2021-01-19T03:16:14Z,0

"Today was difficult. I struggled to get in my body throughout the practice however, the final message from Adriene really stuck with me and allowed me to extend myself grace and perspective. &quot;How do you really know how you feel on any given day unless you take the time to explore and listen, to pay attention.&quot; Today I felt frustrated and unfocused and that&#39;s okay and very much a part of the human experience. It is as worth exploring as all of the more pleasant emotions. I am grateful for this space from which I learn so much!!",Alexis Mayfield,2021-01-19T02:50:41Z,1

Every day finds me flowing a bit more smoothly into downward dog, strengthening formerly weak wrists enough to plank instead of half-plank, and discovering one more of the myriad of reasons that this can and should remain a daily practice for me.

I really struggled with whether to practice today. I think I overdid it getting into a lunge and my knee is hurting a lot today. I get very “all or nothing” especially about exercise challenges. Then I reminded myself this is a journey and yoga is about honoring my body; pushing my body isn’t honoring to it and might even hurt it more meaning missing more days. So instead I did a little bit of meditation and reminded myself what breath and yoga are really all about while I ice and use heat on my knee. Looking forward to coming back to this video another day and to hopefully feel wrk enough to get on the mat tomorrow!,Maria C,2021-01-19T01:56:01Z,0

To anyone who was once a lovesick teenager, I just went through the disappointment of realizing you were wrong about someone and that you don’t really matter to them.

I’ve cried a lot over the last 24 hours and when she said to just “let something go” I started crying but it was different than earlier today.

"Day 17. Check! I must say I tried to understand how I feel and... I&#39;m feeling frustrated. I&#39;m feeling frustrated at myself for not taking proper care of myself. Everyday the one thing I dedicate the most is study. The rest is just wasted time, not doing what&#39;s best for me. I get lazy and I procrastinate, but only when it&#39;s about me. I am done with that. This yoga journey can&#39;t be the only thing I am doing for myself. Even when I practice yoga I almost have to do everything perfectly at times, or I will get angry at myself. This is not fair... This is it, I&#39;ve had enough! Today&#39;s practice made me come to a huge realization. I hope I don&#39;t sound to angry to anyone reading this. I am just feeling somewhat inspired to wake up tomorrow morning and simply do things differently. Weird day today, but tomorrow will be better.<br>PS: Today&#39;s practice felt really good anyway!",Alexandra Bob,2021-01-19T00:42:03Z,2

"I feel heavy today. It&#39;s not a good heavy or a bad heavy-<del>as I suppose anything isn&#39;t good or bad, it just is what we decide it is--but heavy. My days feel like a minefield. I&#39;m so grateful for what I have, and I also feel weighted with just...more nowadays. It&#39;s not just a trip to the grocery store to pick up some toilet paper and fruit. It&#39;s a choice to enter a risk-filled environment which requires a kind of hyper-vigilance that immediately shrinks my joy and -</del> my breath, most of the time. I felt my mind beg me to return to a deeper breath today in the car, unprompted. That&#39;s an improvement. I was also anxious enough one night this week, worried about my dog and possible health problems, that I needed to take my on-hand anti-anxiety medication. I&#39;m trying to accept all of this, to let it come and go. But the longer this pandemic lasts, the harder it feels to maintain my own sense of balance and safety. That&#39;s what it is. I don&#39;t feel safe. Adriene, have you made a yoga video for safety/security? I think that would really help right now. Of course, you&#39;re churning out videos all the time, so I&#39;d never want to pressure you. Just thought of it. Goodnight, all.",Rachel Clausen,2021-01-18T23:53:09Z,0

"This day was pretty difficult for me, I had to stop. I have some back, feet, and knee problems and &#39;ve been doing yoga for general wellbeing, but I don&#39;t recall a yoga day so far that hasn&#39;t left me feeling more sore and a little defeated honestly. I try being careful and not pushing my body while remaining in form, but even simple poses like a forward fold are really difficult. I have been doing yoga regularly for months now, so this has been an ongoing issue. Does anyone have suggestions or tips?",Emma Kenn,2021-01-18T21:52:03Z,2
"Do you let yourself do totally different poses when you want? If not, that could be something to try. Sometimes if I’m not feeling something, I’ll do a child’s pose or just lie on my belly. Then I’ll sync up with the video when it’s back to something I want to do.

"Day 17 - Explore done ✅ First day I didn&#39;t feel like showing up! 😳Couldn&#39;t get on my Mat at my usual a time this morning due to hubby not feeling well, so of course I looked after him, then a busy day in general, with a headache &amp; period pains &amp; backache, &amp; feeling grumpy!! <br />Finally reminded myself that I had made a choice at the beginning of this journey for the next 30 days, (in fact I had made a choice/pact with myself, to show up on my mat for  the next 365 days on the 1st January).  <br />So I&#39; came &amp; unrolled my mat  this evening, in my tiny space at the end of my bed,  with an open mind.  And I explored playfully, and focused on my breathe &amp; practised and let go.  And now I leave smiling, pain gone, refreshed &amp; relaxed.  And so glad I showed up.  Thank you Adriene.

I&#39;ve been doing yoga with Adriene for more than a year off and on, but I still have a lot of trouble with the &quot;zipping legs together, really together&quot; part of it. I believe it&#39;s because my medial malleolus on each foot (the bump above the inner arch) stops my legs from joining completely, and if I pull the knees together and force it a bit, there&#39;s an uncomfortable strain on the medial malleolus. Does anyone have any tips or know anything that could help? Thank you so much!!",jan jan,2021-01-18T20:18:52Z,1

"Today was really challenging for me! I’m sure others can relate that the most challenging part is overcoming mental and emotional blocks, mostly the shame that says “I’m not doing this well enough” “I’m no good at this”. For me, it was helpful to pause the video, take a few deep breaths and remind myself “you are on the mat. You are breathing. You are moving. You have already succeeded”. After that I was able to continue through the rest of the practice, at times crashing into my mat, at times falling over, but in the end proud of myself for sticking to my commitment ❤️ I hope everyone is feeling proud of themselves ❤️",Hannah B,2021-01-18T20:17:22Z,25

"Thank you for the Breath Journey, Adriene. I’ve been doing yoga off and on for my whole adult life and YWA since the start of the pandemic. With Breath, a light turned on in my head.

"I wasn’t sure how I’d come to the mat after a “troubled mind” day! But I definitely learned from yesterday’s breathing and brought that to the mat to experience the most exquisite calm in my practice, letting go of everything and mindfully working through without any apprehensions of whether I’d manage one move to the next. It was sensational! Thank you Adriene 🙏🏼- I’m getting where I want to be. Slowly but surely towards lightness of being. ♥️",Leena Launay,2021-01-18T19:57:16Z,2

"&quot;And if you feel like letting go of something, even if you can&#39;t name it, say yes. If you think it&#39;ll serve you. Yes to letting go.&quot; <br />I read about it many times in the comments, and experienced it only once or twice during yoga, but those words caught be off guard and I felt tears coming down.

"I usually follow the practice quite closely, but today as I began exploring on the mat I realized how heavy hearted I have been today.

"I loved this one! Time passed so quickly. I also got my cat involved... well, she got herself evolved, helped me by forcing me to have a flat back in plank pose so I wouldn’t throw her down, she slid from my belly right into my face in bridge pose and was a great hip/belly warmer at the end. All around, went well. Also, I almost got one heel down to the earth at downward dog! I wish you all health, safety and lots of love. I adore doing yoga with so many of you at the same time xx",dazzzlingworld,2021-01-18T19:22:29Z,1

"Every year I’ve tried to do this yoga journey I haven’t completed it. Something always comes up, usually because I’m burnt out and adding the anxiety of completing a challenge tips me over and I get sick, and I stop. This year broader social, systemic on goings coupled with personal losses took me out a few days, but I knew this was a soothing and grounding practice for me, and spent some time this week slowly catching back up instead of stopping all together. This is first time I’ve come so far along this journey. <br />What I truly believe is that cultivating self compassion, in place of compulsive productivity and all the anxiety with it, is what has gotten me here. Thank you Adriene, and all of y’all breathing with me. More self compassion for all of us.",Bianca,2021-01-18T18:02:10Z,0

this was unexpectedly very difficult yet healing for me. this practice gave me a roller coaster of emotions for some reason. i think i often spend a lot of time exploring my own mind and body and thoughts so i found myself drifting into exploration of others. i know why i do and feel the things i do yet i dont often try to explore those around me. why do they do or feel what they do? i know myself so well that i sometimes forget that other people go through life with completely different motivations and emotions and experiences than me. this was a humbling practice for me. thank you adriene!,emme,2021-01-18T17:45:01Z,0

"I have a question about breathing techniques (for you Adriene, or anyone else who cares to share some wisdom). I have sinus issues that make breathing in and out of the more difficult. Is it less beneficial if I am taking conscious breaths (more frequently) out of the mouth? Nadi Shodhana (or the Alternate Nostril Breathing) from last week was definitely more difficult for me as well. Any wisdom for deepening the breath when physically breathing is hard?

"5,714 practiced exploring Day 17 with me this morning. So cool! My hips and lower back were a little tight today maybe from sitting so long working on slower breathing yesterday. So I loved having extra encouragement today to find what feels good. I found the slow and measured breathing really helped me stay grounded in today’s practice. Much love to you Adriene, Benji and <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ywabreath"">#ywabreath</a> community...thank you. Namaste 🙏",Meredith Meixner,2021-01-18T15:54:09Z,0

"I love how your small cues for adjustments make me feel that 1/2 inch difference.  Bringing so much awareness, I am learning so much!! And this was the first practice I have ever done where I breathed in and out through just the nose, unless making a conscious choice to breath out from the mouth.  Was so interesting to notice how my body felt because of this, yesterday&#39;s ratio practice truly helped me with my breath awareness.! Thank you Adriene, absolutely loving it!

"I had a lot going on during practice this morning and had to keep pausing/going back in the video and I felt a lot of aggravation and friction building up inside of me. I took a moment to explore myself, explore the reasoning for it and realized that it was because I am always having loads of high expectations that sort of frame my picture. The moment I noticed it, dropped the expectations of a “perfect” practice, outside disturbances became more quiet. Was it that they stopped, or that I let them have space to clutter around and make noise? At the end of practice, right as we put our hands up in prayer to the third eye, my baby came up and gave me a kiss and it spread throughout my entire body-the gross body and the subtle body. Thanks again, Adriene, for being such a phenomenal teacher, and a patient friend. 💝",J J,2021-01-18T15:12:22Z,3

I&#39;m job hunting and dealing with a lot of self-imposed stress, shame and doubt right now, and I can&#39;t possibly express how valuable this practice has been - it&#39;s the only thing that can pull me out of my mind and the endless spirals of rumination.

"Shame and doubt, spiralling thoughts, whirling emotions... I get it too. I&#39;m glad you were able to find release, and I&#39;m praying that now, a month later, things are going better for you. <br />The only place I find lasting relief from those things is in Jesus (I hesitate to say that in case people start hating me! 😅 But I want to be open and honest, and this is a kind community. 😘 ) Finding my worth in a God who is kind and compassionate and knows exactly how I&#39;m feeling and is with me at all times I&#39;ve found is far better than when I was trying to convince myself of my own self-worth (which only lasted maybe 24 hours on a good day...). <br />So, anyway, I just hope you&#39;re doing better and that you continue to have a helpful and healthy yoga practice. Lots of love! 😁",Robyn Hepburn,2021-02-19T08:10:40Z,1

"Good morning! I am wondering if Adriene, or anyone else who sees this, has any ideas for me. I have a shoulder injury but would still like to participate. I have done a couple of them so far, but usually get discouraged when we get to plank or down dog because those put so much weight on my shoulder (I have a labral tear, will most likely have surgery on at some point soon). Any thoughts? I love Adriene and her work so it&#39;s a bummer when I feel like I can&#39;t participate. Thanks in advance!",Sarah Hutchison,2021-01-18T14:30:05Z,0

"Dear Sarah,<br />First of all I think only a doctor can answer your question.<br />I myself have an impingement syndrome in my left shoulder and I cannot even do a cactus pose without pain- so I just do not do it but alternate my body position into something that doesn´t hurt. But what I do: I breathe with Adrienne. I feel so much better after a session even without doing some of the exercices just because I explore my breath and my state of mind (and body). <br />Maybe this helps you a little bit. And sorry for my bad English, I am from Germany.",Judith Schäfer,2021-01-18T15:25:55Z,0

"In the spirit of total honesty, I think it may have been during today&#39;s practice where my mind was the most distracted. Any time any piece of my body cracked or popped its like my brain went directly there with curiosity, but not always the good kind. I tried my best to use my breath to bring my focus back and I am happy to report it worked sometimes! I use this experience today to remind myself that yoga is always a journey, you just have to roll with whatever comes! Thank you Adriene, see you tomorrow! 💙<br /><br />Side Note: Why is it that whenever we are holding anything particularly difficult, that is the time Adriene uses to give us some elaborate motivational speech, quite slowly I might add! LOL",Faith Hudvagner,2021-01-18T14:29:35Z,0

"I really must call for balance here - there were a lot of spaces and asana here that were treated  very differently on one side than the other (2 balancing cat pulls-in versus 4; 1 breath in runner&#39;s stretch versus 5; pyramid pose on one side and not the other). Over time, this creates significant bodily imbalance that can take months if not years to recover from. I&#39;m a yoga instructor, I know how hard it is to make sure that you perform the same sequence with the same timing on both sides. But it is so vitally important to make sure you do so, especially for beginners who are developing the muscular mobility, flexibility, and strength. This is not specific to this video or to Adriene, I see it all the time live and online, and I think as teachers and students it&#39;s something we have to be extra mindful of as we explore into new postures and moments!",Ayla Amon,2021-01-18T14:26:52Z,0

"YWA is absolutely life changing! Adriene has taught me to Find What Feels Good even in the midst of tough challenges - both on the mat and off. This is a journey of ups and downs. Waking up to Adriene&#39;s warm, kind vibe is like being with a friend. Her energy flows even through the TV. I cannot imagine how much she radiates in person. This practice allows you to go at your own pace AND still be challenged. She teaches you to move slower (yes, even Vinyasa). She focuses on breathing and movement. This is a serious practice made lighter by how she teaches. She guides you every step of the way. She is truly an amazing teacher. And, she&#39;s funny, quirky, talented, silly, and just really real. This practice has changed my life. Thank you so much Adriene!",Kym Machovina,2021-01-18T13:47:14Z,0

"Explore really resonates with my core value of curiosity as curiosity for me fuels exploration. I admit today was a bit tougher as I had awareness of pain the lower back, so I gave myself permission to explore this throughout and only do what I was capable of doing without pushing myself too far. At first I felt a wave of guilt, but I let that go and realize that I can be compassionate to myself and love my body even when it  is not where I want it to be today and that’s okay. There’s definitely some more lower back exploration in my future though! Super grateful that I was able to show up today and grateful to Adriene and this entire community.

Today was a struggle for me emotionally. I was feeling a little on the depressed side this morning. I was not feeling any desire to do anything. I kept listening to Adriene and just explored my feelings (or lack of them) and explored my body movement and stillness. The moment when Adriene said to let go of something even if you don&#39;t know what it is &quot;just say yes&quot;. I said yes like 10 times and it really helped to let go of this weird feeling I was having this morning. Thank you Adriene!,Melanie H,2021-01-18T13:18:24Z,0

"It honestly feels like this program is personally tailored to me. Every day I am reaping the benefits, and I feel so excited for the next day. I once had the great fortune to hear Dame Shirley Bassey sing live, and in a crowd of 80,000 people she made it feel like she was singing just for you.  I think Adriene has this gift too, and over the internet which is quite remarkable.  Even though I know there are thousands of people practicing with me, it also feels like each practice is a special little gift just for me.

But the reminder is that this life is still here for enjoying, for seeing with eyes of awe, even on the dark days.

Okay but I&#39;ve been experiencing personal revelations in the moments right after yoga with Adriene a handful of times in the past few months (including today) and I just think that&#39;s so extraordinary. The fact that people have known this and been practicing yoga for hundreds of years for spiritual development is amazing.

"It is amazing isn’t it!? I think when you give the mind a chance to slow down, get quiet and totally reconnected into the body that’s when the magic can happen that’s when our spirit, our true Self can be heard. Our Self is always there but we’re not always quiet enough or receptive enough to hear its insights. Just my post-practice musings of course...🧘🌻🙏",Katrina Hinton,2021-01-18T12:18:02Z,2

"Today&#39;s practice was particularly intense, and everytime she was reminding us to breath through our nose, I was huffing and puffing with my mouth open... :D Sometime I had to force myself not to give up and collapse on the mat, but it was definitely worth it. Now I&#39;m having trouble writing, as my arms are shaking like pudding, but I feel much more energyzed! Glad I stuck till the end, two weeks ago I would have never had the strenght ... &lt;3",Anna Serafini,2021-01-18T11:07:17Z,128

"my exploration looked different today. with a body that felt tired and sick i explored what it was like to really listen to my body and only join for the low to the ground, soft movements and sit in silence breathing. this was a first for me this journey - but i remember my comment on day 1 saying i would show up everyday, even to just sit and breathe. so here’s to everyone else who’s looking at the comments, not feeling it today - show up, even just to breathe. x",Carina,2021-01-18T10:56:01Z,14

"Today was hard for me. I was really low on energy (which I could have prevented), I&#39;ve been a bit sick so breathing through the nose is tiring,  and this lockdown really has drained my motivation...

"It’s so interesting how being conscious about breathing through the nose for inhales and exhales forces you to slow right down and uncovers these subtle nuances I don’t think I usually notice! Like breathing in and out through the nose inherently encourages these wide long breathes, especially in poses that are trickier, which is something I definitely take off the mat when things get trickier (outside of a yoga pose!) so to speak. Such a powerful tool of self-discovery! Hope everyone is doing well💕Namaste x",Jess Nolan,2021-01-18T10:16:21Z,35

"@Tricia Moss I&#39;m thinking of doing HOME from last year which I loved. Wish I could get a group from the UK doing it at the same time, as it just really keeps me motivated. Love NC...just moved back to Wales after 34 years in Florida...yes I&#39;m old!!😂xx",Annie Dickson,2021-01-18T19:31:46Z,0

"@j no problem - if you look at the number of views of the video when you start the practice (it’s just under the title of the video). Then do your yoga practice. Then after you’ve finished, refresh the page (or just leave the video and go back to it again)  and see how many views there are. The difference between these numbers before and after you practiced is the number of people you practiced with! It’s usually easier to see if you do the practice close to the release time :)",C,2021-01-19T06:42:45Z,0

"Exploring possibilities and exploring how you really feel by listening. What a great flow today! When Adriene asked us how we are feeling, I answered, &quot;I feel great&quot; because I show up each day with my breath. As a child,I struggle with explaining or expressing my emotions but as I grew up, I slowly explored how to open up and be more honest to  myself. I hope everyone feeling great too! If not, that&#39;s okay. Here&#39;s to all of us cloud ticklers ☁️😋 Namaste 😌🙏",Roselie Samson,2021-01-18T06:38:08Z,7

Can&#39;t wait to see what kind of little yoga pretzel I&#39;m going to be in two weeks time. Well, a lump of bread more likely, but a very soft and malleable lump of bread 😄",Vilhelmina Pietiläinen,2021-01-18T06:23:30Z,17
