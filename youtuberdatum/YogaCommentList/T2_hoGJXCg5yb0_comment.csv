Anyone suffering with injuries be warned although this practice says ease Adrienne asks you to hold poses for a long time. I&#39;m usually able to get through her videos but this one really tested my patience and I actually gave up before the end.,Chris Beames,2021-03-15T18:53:11Z,0

"As a person who hasn’t done yoga consistently, I really needed this. It’s 3:22am here in Texas and randomly thought “let’s do yoga”. I didn’t pause it, check the time or even harshly repeat why I couldn’t do it perfectly. I was so in the moment, peaceful, and my self talk tender. Thank you for reminding me, that I need to do what feels right, adjust when necessary and to continue the process.",Treasure Curry,2021-02-19T09:26:11Z,1

After returning to work once things started to open back up in the summertime, life got so hectic I totally abandoned my yoga practice along with my other spiritual work...

"Day 10 of the twelve I should have done by now..but that’s ok. I looked forward to this so much, the sun came out onto my face during the stretches as I felt my hips support me taking it really slow. I’ve noticed after 10 days that I can now bring my foot up to the top of the mat from cat pose in one movement which I certainly could not do before and my body is less stiff in the morning than before. Very grateful for you and for myself finally doing this. X",Gabriella Buckingham,2020-11-12T12:57:54Z,1

Ground day 10! Day 38 of return to YWA. Always welcome a return to basics. Keep a beginner&#39;s mind. Find something new.  I found some ways to refine and experience the poses today. Thank you Adriene. ❤,William B,2020-11-11T03:31:20Z,2
"I loved this and so needed it. YouTube always creepily knows which videos from Adriene I need whenever I pull up my page (monocle emoji). Anyway, two pros: one, I&#39;ve been doing yoga for years. I&#39;m not fabulous, but I know my way around the mat and several poses. This practice was a really nice way to revisit things I&#39;m confident about and &quot;find something new,&quot; as Adriene says. Second pro is that I&#39;ve been suffering from a days-long headache turned migraine, and if you&#39;re familiar with chronic migraines you know that there&#39;s a day or two after that are kind of an &quot;aftershock,&quot; like it&#39;s still lingering back there, not 100% gone. It&#39;s like &quot;I can come back if you want me to!&quot; (smiling devil emoji) ANYWAY, this was the perfect practice for a day like today, in the cycle of migraines. Thank you! x",Bailey Powell Aldrich,2020-11-11T03:12:35Z,1

"After five years of (almost) daily yoga practice, lately I&#39;ve been so distant from yoga and mindfulness in general, just feeling super disconnected and anxious. This was exactly what I needed today. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll keep practising regularly after this, but in any case, it was just what I needed today.<br /><br />So if you&#39;re feeling disconnected to your yoga practice, hey I&#39;m with you.

In downwards dog I’ve let go of the tension in my shoulders and like you taught us, imagined a flow of energy throughout my whole body.

Don’t be too hard on yourself. It will get easier with practice. Certain moves can be harder with a little extra weight.

"The thought of texting my yoga teacher from my last studio (in another time zone from me now) saying &quot;I may have been &#39;late&#39; to class, but I was practicing with you ladies. In spirit.&quot; was going through my mind and then you mention that we might be practicing with another yogi at the same time we are watching this video and it made me smile. It just proved your statement to me. Statistically, I believe that there are many people practicing at the same time all the time. I love that you mentioned it. <br />Also, I just want to say thank you (again, I know) for your videos. They help my body so much (Fibromyalgia Warrior) and they make me feel less alone (still practicing social distancing September 2020). <br />I find such inspiration from the things that you say as well. Things that I hope to bring into my own classes (when I eventually start them... which will hopefully be this month but... still anxiety)  <br />I love your reminders to connect the mind, body, and spirit. Oh, and I loved your line of &quot;I hope you come to the mat in order to learn instead of to master&quot; or something along those lines. Such a good statement! That&#39;s exactly what I try to do. Forever student, never a master. I&#39;m gonna steal the concept if that&#39;s okay and of course reword it, but not because I think I should &quot;have&quot; it but because I think people can really use that message. I&#39;ve always imagined the people I picture as my students as having an issue with that concept. The perfectionist, the person who is hyper-competitive with themselves, always hard and down on themselves, etc. <br /><br /> I share your videos on facebook all the time.  &lt;3 I hope you feel strengthened by your videos and you may continue for many years to come. &lt;3",Emily Dodge,2020-09-01T16:41:16Z,4

"This is the first time I&#39;ve been able to bring myself to do yoga since the beginning of the pandemic. The shock of all the change in the world, along with the various traumas I&#39;ve had throughout my life, have made it a survival mechanism for me to vacate my body and totally disconnect when I&#39;m threatened. What an interesting practice, although my body is definitely weaker and shakier, I found that my ability to really tune in to the subtle aspects of each pose was actually even deeper than ever before in the many YWA videos I&#39;ve worked with. Also, just dropping that line right at the end, &quot;show up with an open mind and a willingness to learn, rather than master,&quot; was just the reminder I needed in a lot of areas of my life right now.

Everytime... when I&#39;ve practiced yoga following your videos and it&#39;s been awhile. I have to sit or lay with myself because I get emotional. Does anyone else get that feeling? It&#39;s like my body is letting go of so much crap I cant help but sit and feel it leave my body. Leaves me feeling stronger.❤,Aarika Brown,2020-08-31T15:55:20Z,1

"Hi Adriene, this video was the first on my home screen on YouTube when I wanted to select a yoga class after being slack for a couple of months 🤭 It was as you knew that I was coming back 😃 This was a great session to start with. Me and my body could feel that we need to get back in practice as working from home during this Corona time, makes me sit to much 😬 After your lesson I got my spirit renewed to get back on my yoga mat on a daily base. Thank you so much 🙏 Greetings from the Netherlands 🇳🇱, 🙏 Esther",Esther de Hei,2020-08-31T06:44:27Z,2

"Hi Adriene!<br />Thank you so much for sharing these wonderful videos. I was on and off of yoga until about a year or so ago when I discovered your channel, and now perform one of your routines pretty much every day! It has really improved my well-being and I believe it has also positively impacted those around me.<br />I started bringing some of the concepts I learned from you into my company (we&#39;re a small team of artisan candlemakers) to perform our daily morning stretch. Our work involves some lifting and lots of handiwork that can be tiring on the wrists, shoulders and back and back especially. I found your &quot;yoga for chefs&quot; video really relevant to the work we do.<br />I wondered if perhaps you would consider doing a very short (5 minute) standing stretch routine for this kind of application. I would love to be able to play the video to our team every day. My hope is that it might also benefit other workshops, small factories, and similar work environments, where the conditions are not ideal for dropping a yoga mat on the floor.<br />In any case, keep doing what you&#39;re doing. I am very grateful for you.<br />Thank you!",aridoull,2020-08-30T14:54:37Z,0

You are my go-to for yoga and honestly an inspiration because one day I want to start a channel focused on yoga for chronically ill people (like myself) who can’t do certain poses like average people. Idk if you’ll see this but I am in desperate need of yoga for a tilted pelvis. My hips are tilted so far back that I can’t lay on my back or lift my legs up without a loud painful pop. 😖 I’ve been studying yoga for a while now and have not found anything to help stretch this out yet.,Han Stone,2020-08-28T22:55:22Z,0

"Awesome and very insightful updates👍👏🏻✌ Well i will also say this here... I was born and brought up as a business oriented person, i so much that getting rich in life you need to spend less and invest more, you don&#39;t expect to spend 90% and invest 10% and sit to make more wealth. Mostly as this recent Covid-19 outbreak turned a lot of people jobless, i still find cryptocurrency as one major opportunity to make money online mostly in bitcoin trading if you know your way around. However i still believe in day trading if you must make good profits from bitcoin trading, this i have been doing for over 6 months and it&#39;s been so successful because i was smart enough to find myself a working strategy/daily signals backed with guidance provided by pro trader known as Lyra Holt Dean. During my first month i accumulated and grow my portfolio from 1.1btc to a total of 6.4btc which you will agree is a very good profits. her contact info are ((info@<a href=""http://lyraholtdean.com/"">lyraholtdean.com</a> )) or WhatsApp **[[+1 910-367 5481 ]]**•profitable trading systems.",Antonio Bandears - Topic,2020-08-24T14:08:06Z,16

"Adriene, I honestly do like your videos but I cringe when &quot;namaste&quot; is being said at the end. As an Indian-American, and growing up in a Hindi-speaking household, the word has had a different meaning for me. When I hear white yoga instructors say &#39;namaste&#39; at the end, what I&#39;m actually hearing is (quoted also by an Indian-American blogger), &quot;The cultural appropriation in me bows to the Indian in you.&quot; Here are some good articles on some uneasy experiences that Indian-Americans have dealt with when it comes to the appropriation of yoga and the use of the word &#39;namaste&#39;- <a href=""https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/01/17/406246770/how-namaste-flew-away-from-us"">https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/01/17/406246770/how-namaste-flew-away-from-us</a>  AND <a href=""https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/indian-in-yoga-class/"">https://brevitymag.com/nonfiction/indian-in-yoga-class/</a>",Manisha,2020-08-17T20:39:56Z,0

"I love doing yoga with you. Since lockdown (mid-March) I’ve been doing yoga with you every day and it has helped me to cope with the situation. During a run I fell and hurt my hand, which means no downward dogs, planks, chaturanga as I can’t put pressure on the ball of my hand. I tried doing it on my knuckles (at least all fours) and looking for alternatives (puppy pose instead of dog), it’s just quite difficult and painful in places... soooo, I was wondering whether you could do a session that is hands free. I’ve found one video, but a bit of variety would be awesome. Thank you and lots of love.",Christine Bertram,2020-08-17T06:53:41Z,0

Yesterday, I hit it way too hard and today’s practice reminded me of some things I need to think about, like, “Why don’t I hit it hard one day and ease the next”.  This is a great practice to come back to .  Thank you Adrian. I’m quarantining now in a beautiful ravine with rushing water and I’m practicing on a deck overlooking the creek.

Awesome video!!!! Most excellent for getting back into daily practice.  I had a quick question regarding breathing cues if anyone can help...how do I breath into my belly while pulling my navel in at the same time. I find when I &quot;engage&quot; my core(flex my stomach) I can&#39;t get a full breath.  I have been into yoga for many years but just getting back into it after like 2 years off and this has always been a question on my mind.  Thanks!!!,Night of the Living Funk,2020-08-11T20:34:06Z,0

"Hello Adrienne, Thankfully, I want to share with you that my daughter (22years old ) and I (58 years old) have been doing Yoga with you, since quarantine started in Mexico by the middle of March 2020. We started with your 30 day yoga videos, the first time we finished the sequence of the complete 30 days including Saturdays and Sundays, we felt so successful and grateful to you ( you will never know how much yo have helped to our physical and mental health. <br />We live in Cuernavaca , Morelos, Mexico. After the third month of your 30 days videos, we started to pick a different video for each day, according our necessities as you always say “ listening to the needs of our bodies” , for lower back, for upper back, to relax, to sleep, etc . We do yoga with you every day, now we are doing it from Monday to Friday but if one of us is in pain or in need we do it even on Saturday or Sunday. What you have done putting your videos at no cost and available to everybody no matter where we are. That is the way we found you and you have really reached to us. We love you Adrienne. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EXISTING, AND DO WHAT YOU DO. YOU ARE AWSOME. We admire you so much. We sent you our very best wIshes for whatever you need. THANK YOU SOOO SOOOOO MUCH. From Mexico with love.",Mary Tere Pérez Rodríguez,2020-08-07T02:35:02Z,0

"so about 3 and a half years ago I was diagnosed with chronic labyrinthitis, which is basically constant vertigo plus a load of other horrible symptoms that the doctors said would maybe never go away. I started doing yoga with adriene about a year after i found out I had it, after a period of not being able to walk by myself or shower without falling over (I was 14 so it was a weird thing for me to have this ‘invisible illness’ that no one could see but still not be as independent as most people my age.) This was also around the time I was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety too- and I just wanted to say that these videos genuinely make everything better, always. With Adriene I’ve been able to improve my physical and mental health more than I ever thought I would- now I’m 17 years old and running 4 times a week, and despite still having the vertigo it is much less severe, and I truly believe that’s because of this yoga. It has taught me to be kind and patient with myself, especially on the days where I’m feeling the worst. It’s also taught me to slow down and appreciate life around me no matter the circumstances- and I never want to miss a single day because I know I won’t hear a “heyyyy-ooo” from Adriene if I do!! So, Thank you Adriene, truly, from the bottom of my heart. You’ve quite literally saved my life and I am thankful every day for videos like this. ❤️",Amélie Woodwards,2020-08-04T18:19:33Z,1

I had a pretty awful migraine yesterday which left me feeling like a chewed up stick of sugar cane today and I wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d be able to make it to the mat, but when I saw this video I thought, &quot;perfect timing&quot;. Thanks for also reminding us of the people we&#39;re practicing with right at that moment! Today I felt like there was some energy pinging from person to person, especially when we brought our hands together at the heart. Pretty darn cool : )",Mado,2020-08-04T11:50:31Z,1

"Reading all these comments, seeing peoples stories is so lovely. I also felt that in some ways this beginners practice really unveiled the difficulty of yoga (even more than usual). Not only was it a work out focusing on truly understanding the basics of posing, but it also exposed how difficult it is to really really slow down (even more than corona has already forces us too). To anyone who is ready this, I hope you feel supported and loved!",Emma Ariena,2020-08-04T09:52:59Z,1

I’ve been faithfully following each monthly calendar  since January 1, 2020.  Love the balance - energy, gentleness, encouragement, challenge - that  you bring to the teaching/guiding process.   You constantly highlight the importance of bringing the breath into the practice, a reminder that brings life and positiveness. <br />I have notice that when you guide to exhort the audience to focus on their breath, connect with all the parts of the body, and invitation to ... you  tend to repeat yourself with redundant comments/directions/descriptions which tends to distract from the breath-body connection.

I really feel I&#39;m gaining awareness and strength in my body beyond what I imagined possible at the start of &#39;Home&#39;.  I&#39;m listening better to how I position my body, during today&#39;s &#39;Ease&#39; practice particularly so. Some days I still stumble and have to take extra rest but other days I&#39;m stronger than I could have believed. Yoga hasn&#39;t fixed all my disabilities but it&#39;s training me to have patience, and providing me with the strength to work with them rather than against. Thank you for gifting so many modifications and encouraging props with no shame, allowing us to come to the mat even on bad days and do the best we can, with gratitude and grace.

These slower fundamental practices are always the hardest for me,Tonya,2020-08-02T15:53:49Z,0
This is brilliant!  All too often we just automatically follow what an instructor says without thinking about whether it&#39;s right for us and how to experience more joy and ease in the movements (and stillness).  This is how yoga is meant to be practiced---mindfully!  I used to think that yoga wasn&#39;t worthwhile unless it was done for an hour because that&#39;s what yoga classes usually are---but I get more out of Adrienne&#39;s 30 minutes or less sessions than I do with longer ones from someone else.,Ellen Lederman,2020-08-02T15:50:32Z,0

"Day 2 of YWA August 2020 and my oh my am I feeling the feels of missing practice for quite a while. Mentally I find I am in a stronger, more positive place and physically I can feel my body pushing through the tough moments, building strength and endurance. I found that when I often go into Downward Dog I am forgetting the fundamentals of the pose and I am so glad this practice brought me back to re-learn some important alignment aspects. It is funny, Adriene seems to know exactly what I am thinking because it never fails that a minute later she mentions something in the video that reassures me I am on the right path, progress is happening, and finding what feels good for MY BODY is what is important. Thank you Adriene! See you tomorrow!",Faith Hudvagner,2020-08-02T15:47:12Z,0
"This was perfect for me today, a real lesson in listening to what my body needs. I dropped a ceramic vase on my left foot just over a week ago and it is so cut and bruised. Instead of laying my foot flat on the earth whilst sending them back in a lunge (a no-go at the moment), I curled my toes as much as they were able to. And I did find stability and ease. What a lesson in humility and patience. At one point I was worried &#39;I wasn&#39;t doing the yoga properly&#39; but then I realised that I truly was finding what felt good for my poor battered foot!

I absolutely love classes that invite me to return back to that &quot;beginner&#39;s mindset.&quot; This encourages me to focus on the transitions, the sensations flowing throughout my body, connecting my breath to the movement, etc. Slowing my movement down helps me stay rooted in the present moment. I am able to think more clearly and I even find moments where I am able to quiet my mind. &quot;Find ease in the difficult moments&quot; is such a beautiful statement!

"Adrienne, you are an amazing woman.  The amount of comfort you have in front of the camera, your calming voice, and the funny little quips you have make you seem so down to earth that it&#39;s very easy to watch you and follow along with what you are doing.  You seem like a &quot;real person&quot; rather than a stiff fitness robot.  I am a Corrections Officer at a state prison and recently had back surgery.  It&#39;s hard for a guy like me to try yoga, but you are so easy to listen to and follow, and such a natural beauty.  And to top it off you have an adorable dog!  Thank you for making it so easy to get the rehab I need to get back to work sooner than later!  Keep making the videos and I will keep doing them along with you!",coopermarc,2020-08-02T12:48:37Z,3
That was excellent Adriene! Thank you for another great video. You&#39;re videos have helped so much over the past four months since our gyms closed. This was a nice reminder to take it easy while challenging myself.,Celina Christopher,2020-08-02T12:48:11Z,1
"For all non beginners who doubt if they should do this practice: DO IT! I also doubted if I had to do this practice since it says &quot;yoga for beginners&quot; and I do yoga everyday for quite a while. I decided to give it a try and I noticed that my ego had taken over some poses and in this practice I relearned the poses. I felt fresh and new. Downward facing dog never felt so good as it did in this yoga practice, and it was even a fierce practice, it was definitely not an easy practice💪🤸‍♀️. I&#39;m glad that I did it. Thank you Adriene. 💚",Momo's Videos,2020-08-02T12:47:37Z,582
"@Rachel Parent I used to have the same problem with slippy hands and feet, until an old yoga teacher (old as in age and how long ago she taught me 😁) recommended using liquid chalk on my hands and feet.

"@Rachel Parent I had the same, now I use a manduka yoga mat, which is very sticky (if you clean it often), and if my hands get too sweaty I use a towel or I wear a shirt with long sleeves so that I can put the sleeves over my hands. Hope it will help for you too. If not, try to be mindful with it and accept it as it is, focus on the things that work for you. 🤸‍♀️ Or maybe you can try another pose like tabletop or puppy pose, like Adriene says: &quot;Find what feels good&quot;. Good luck, Namasté 🙏",Momo's Videos,2020-08-26T09:44:57Z,0
Rachel Parent try a small hand towel at the top of your mat or you can find cheap yoga “towels” on Amazon. My hands get super sweaty too.. such a difference the towel will make not only with the actual problem of your hands slipping but you no longer have to think about the problem and you can focus on the practice!,Stefan Crowl,2020-08-25T17:59:32Z,2

I tend to go for fast moving practices without too much sitting or stillness, and I’m not very good at remembering to throw in a slower practice every now and then especially when my body feels tired.

Every day when I practice with you Adriene I especially listen to your words to refine each move and this is what makes all the difference for me. I have learned that slow is powerful and quite challenging more so than flowing vinyasas and this is what builds my strength. So I stick with it and breathe deep and if it gets tough I breathe a little deeper. It’s all good !  .... and I loved the namaste shark fin, my favourite in child’s pose.

I’ve read that yoga can cause anxiety because we are putting our bodies in physically vulnerable positions. If you’re holding onto anxiety it will come through in yoga sometimes. I’ve also read that yoga has the intention of bringing these emotions to the surface so we can can process them more fully. Interesting to think about.,Erin Grz,2021-04-11T17:54:20Z,1

This was such a loving learning reminder that to learn in itself is sometimes better than to master.....or that the beginner´s mind is a wonderful way to meet yourself.
