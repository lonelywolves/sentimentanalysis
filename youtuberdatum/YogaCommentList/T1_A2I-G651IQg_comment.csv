"I want to return to calmness, clarity and positivity. I want to return to my energy and optimistic mind. I want to return to doing some things regulary, to listening to myself and taking better care of my health. And... I want to return to wanting to help others instead of shielding myself from everyone like I&#39;m afraid they&#39;ll steal the last drops of energy that I have left. I&#39;m tired of feeling like I&#39;ve got nothing left to give. I want to return to my better self.",Diana,2021-01-13T19:08:35Z,2

Today the question in Return is where you want to return to. Quiet funny that I want to return to Home which is the name of this program. I’ve been away for work for a few weeks for work and due to COVID only allowed to stay in hotel rooms and now in quarantine. Can’t wait to return to home.,Frank Alkemade,2021-04-02T07:39:25Z,0
"It is beautiful to learn that all I need and all I am are already within me and I simply need to return HOME. The movements felt challenging and hard but powerful and strong. The images in my mind were of returning to the outdoors where I feel free and grounded. This is my day 44 of YWA journeying and I am grateful for the sense of joy, peace and power it awakens in me. Thank you. 💞",LJ Grooms,2021-03-25T02:05:42Z,0

I want to return to the gym and to running. I got my 2nd vaccine yesterday and feel some hope towards getting back out in the world. We&#39;ve had some snow in my area so running has been put on hold but I will get back to it when the roads and trails are safe. Not doing those things has enabled me to start this yoga journey which is something I don&#39;t want to let go of.

Today, the words happiness, peace, and a home came out, along with a flow of tears, and a prayer to my Father in Heaven. I have been faking it for so long, I didn&#39;t even realize I was not happy nor at peace!  Thank you for this practice!",jenna logan,2021-02-15T00:13:43Z,0

"On the 30 day Home journey in the 28 days of February 2021. I did Days 13 &amp; 14 back-to-back today, after getting on my bicycle for the first time in 8+ months. I swear, every time Adriene has a little &quot;conversation&quot; with us, she&#39;s always spot on. She asks, &quot;What do you want to return to?&quot; on the day I just returned to something so dear and missed. I was hyped up for the Day 13 practice, and glad that I could settle back down with Day 14 immediately after.",Elle B,2021-02-14T00:44:38Z,3

"I&#39;m a stocky, former bodybuilder a little over 50 and bow-legged as hell.  I now use yoga 2-3 days/wk. on my off days between power lifting and HIIT days and love your sessions. I can&#39;t do some of the poses (in some cases due to my size in certain muscle groups and in some cases due to inflexibility or structure) and really like the variations you offer. There are just some ways that my body will not move.. I wish you had 1-hour sessions, but I will typically just daisy-chain two sessions together. I&#39;m also finding moves to spend more time on before or after the sessions.",slashyone,2021-01-17T16:05:34Z,1

I have been struggling a lot with finding my way and losing my dream career that I worked so hard towards.

"Wow Adriene... if only you knew how much you&#39;ve impacted my life in a positive way. Even during those days where I don&#39;t feel like doing it. I discipline myself to do so.. and it always turns out to bring me right back to where I am supposed to be in the end. More often than not, I go to sleep.. boundless. These practices are a form of release for me, as well as a valued lesson each day. The beauty.. the balance of both. Releasing as well as Receiving. Releasing what does not serve my higher purpose.. Yet making room for  love.. peace.. light. So thank you. Super grateful!",Promising Soul,2020-11-25T03:18:37Z,0

"Today was a realisation moment for me. I am new to yoga, and was recommended this channel by a friend, we did a few practices together and it was fun! I started the 30 day journey on my own just because I wanted to keep having some fun with yoga, plus it feels great to stretch things that don&#39;t get to stretch a lot. <br />In child&#39;s pose today the question was asked &#39;what do you want to return to?&#39; My immediate thought was &#39;myself.&#39; I&#39;ve been struggling mentally this year for a whole host of reasons and today I realised that yoga is a way to find myself again and cut through the mental smog.

"This was very good, but I am afraid of pigeons. I had a labral tear (maybe) in my hip. I was not able to sit in a yoga position or easily climb stairs. I healed it slowly without surgery. After 1 1/2 years, I was able to exercise vigorously again and do most yoga positions. I am just afraid of working for too much hip flexibility. I try to strengthen muscles around the hip. Most of your emphasis on the center helps with this. Any advice would be appreciated.",Christina Yocca,2020-08-14T16:50:22Z,0

"When my much beloved yoga teacher retired a few years ago I went into mourning and my practice languished; I had a difficult time finding a class that worked for my aging body.  Now there&#39;s Adriene!  Her practices have everything I need/want--careful design, humor, variety, attention to form, a marriage of the inner and outer bodies--a deep sense of the joyful and every-changing yoga I once knew and loved.  I am astonished that my almost-70-year-old body is quickly able to find a home in poses that once were difficult for me.  At first, I would take a day or two&#39;s rest after a few taxing days to allow my muscles to regroup, but now I see that Adriene&#39;s practices are designed to let that happen naturally, and I am putting myself on the mat each day.  The mat has become home again--thanks, Adriene!",Winifred J Wood,2020-07-13T21:27:30Z,12

"I realized how tight my hip muscles and my hammies are after doing this practice. I was almost in tears stretching, but as the practice deepens, I feel more at ease and relax. I will look into more hip openers and hamstrings yoga now that it made me aware of it. Thanks again, Adriene.",Myn La_Gasca,2020-06-13T19:15:09Z,0
"Return이라는 말이 많은 질문을 남기는 수련이었습니다. 처음에 누군가 또는 무엇이 되려고 하지 말고 있는 그대로의 나를 바라보자는 질문과, 마지막에 내가 무엇을 잃었는지, 무엇을 원하는지를 떠올려보는 질문이 언뜻 보기에 굉장히 다른 것 같기도하지만 하나라는 생각이 들었어요. 비둘기 자세는 원래도 잘 못했던 자세 중 하나인데.. 요가원을 못가면서 몸이 더 틀어졌는지 양쪽 느낌이 완전 다르고🤣🤣 허벅지가 땅에 안 닿네요..^^ 꾸준히 수련하겠습니다. 오늘도 좋은 시간과 에너지, 격려의 말을 해준 Adriene 정말 고마워요💕💕🥰🥰",JB,2020-06-13T13:39:49Z,0
"As someone fairly new to yoga I’ve loved the differences between these lessons. Some are “easy”, some are hard, others are physical, while some take you back to the “why” of it all. <br /><br />It’s been really refreshing compared to my prior experiences of frantically alternating warrior poses while trying to keep up with the class.

I&#39;m loving this 30 day journey (even though I&#39;m taking longer than 30 to complete it) because I love the flow of each day to the next and the flow of Your voice guiding me gently to become better and true to what&#39;s already inside me.  I need to return to my disciplined self.  I also enjoy realizing that I&#39;m stronger than I thought I was and finding that I&#39;m becoming stronger still (physically and emotionally).  I&#39;ve also noticed more flexibility --- just not enough to be on my elbows in the lizard pose yet!,shelliwsmith,2020-06-10T14:59:07Z,0

I was entertaining those little “you can skip today” voices and realized I do not want to over think this 30 day yoga experience only to think myself out of the gold right here today.

"Ooo this was an interesting one for me. I have scoliosis and I&#39;m due for my next adjustment. My hips are slightly turned and one is higher than the other. I found the lizard pose super easy (apart from my weak arms holding me up) with my right knee forward, which is my lower hip. But the left knee forward if I tried moving my knee out at all to get it out of my armpit, my hip would make this really fun pop/grinding noise. Didn&#39;t hurt at all, just clearly was moving it off the rails a little bit haha. This practice has been a very nice way so far to connect with my body, both in the complete lack of arm strength (though I can hold downward dog for at least 10 seconds longer than I could on day 1 now haha) and also in exploring my scoliosis. It&#39;s not severe and really is only painful when i stand for long periods, so I don&#39;t often connect with it. It&#39;s been nice. Returning to body awareness has definitely been a good return for me so far.",Skylar Void,2020-05-31T19:42:33Z,0

"I would like to comment on the repeated use of the pigeon pose.  This is not a good position to put knees that have had reconstructive surgery, or total replacement.  There are other positions that can accomplish “opening the hip” if that is the goal.  I decided to use a different pose in this session after trying the pigeon in an earlier session.

I finally did yesterday’s practice, but it felt strange because I hadn’t practiced for a couple of days. Today, I RETURNED—physically, mentally, and spiritually—to the practice. It felt right. And along with it I feel like I’m returning to a better version myself, with a sense of peace and sanity and motivation that I’ve lost these last few days.

"So, I don&#39;t usually tend to write, say, or reveal my feelings to people.<br />But something has happened in the last few days since I started my 30-day journey.<br />I don&#39;t usually do yoga, either because it is in front of other people and feels competitive and impersonal, or because it requires involving emotions. And I&#39;m the best at keeping inside. I decided to try because I wanted a physical change, and after a few days I had a strong emotional experience that I had not experienced in a long time.<br />I felt myself fall into the deepest pit and into my deepest fears. It felt like my heart was breaking. I was crying my hearth out, crying my past and all my fears.  <br />And after skipping one day, and completing it the next day, I felt like the name of the workout, its content, and the words that have been said by Adrian, bringing me back to life.<br />I&#39;m only at the begining of this, of putting myself out there and saying what I want and what I need, But I wanted to say Thank You.",Netta Haier,2020-05-10T08:57:29Z,5

"I wish to return to contentment and peace. Though life is not perfect and I know I&#39;ll face struggles, and am even facing them today, this yoga journey has helped me realize I can enjoy the process. I can enjoy the gentle pain of a stretch or of holding a tough position because they help to shape me. I no longer want to let myself get swept up in the events of my day and have them control my emotions. I don&#39;t want the waves on top of a stormy sea to disturb the peace below and within. So I wish to return to active contentment and peace.

"I never really cared for yoga in the past, always just seemed slow and boring but I’ve been doing this 30 day yoga journey while quarantined because hey why not give it a shot.  I’ve become obsessed! I’m feeling the physical benefits already but I had no idea the mental benefits. I’ve struggled with anxiety, depression, and PTSD for a long time so that has led me to be very disconnected from my body.  Yoga has given me the space to reconnect my mind, body, and spirit.  I often find myself crying during the practice, but in a good way! I definitely feel more at peace with myself and life in general. Thank you Adriene! ❤️",Laura Mangiarelli,2020-04-27T05:18:23Z,78

I took it very slow and made it through.<br /><br />There are some things I flat out can&#39;t do yet but am modifying as best I can and will get there soon enough. I know I&#39;m really late in starting this series but it seemed fitting to start Home while I&#39;m stuck in mine. Thank you for all of this. See you all tomorrow.,Ben Riley,2020-04-26T07:51:29Z,0

"Hi Adriene, not sure if you will see this but just want to let you know that your 30 days yoga helped me to not only tone my body because I was taking running classes 4 yrs ago, but also really helped me in my breathing and mind relaxation. I followed your True, 30 days yoga, and Yoga camp last 4 yrs ago and I really saw big difference aside from just running alongside. I also followed your yoga for runners and that is when I started. When I work in the office, I mind my breathing to reduce the stress and now I apply your yoga stretches when I hit the gym. While on quarantine now, I go running the afternoon and do your yoga Home after. Really helps me to still tone my body and reduce work stress. Thank you so much for your videos! Your voice is just relaxing to listen and the stretches opens up my hips in a controlled flow of your steps. Thanks and all the best!!

"I began this practice absolutely crippled with sciatica for almost a year, having had to give up my whole fitness routine including walking. On strong medication awaiting surgery, putting on a 1st due to meds and not being able to keep active. I&#39;d wake in the middle of the night crying with pain. HOWEVER! Since becoming this journey I have not only weaned myself off my meds, but I am back walking/jogging and I can barely even notice any pain anymore! I thought I was dreaming and cried happy tears when I woke yesterday morning and for the 1st time in a year there was absolutely NO pain.

Losing weight or gaining strength or whatever always feels like I have to &quot;transform&quot; or become sth new but when I think about it I have already been this person. I have basically always been this person. I don&#39;t have to learn how to be disciplined or how to push myself when I wanna reach a goal because I have already been all these things.

"Adriene, I love you ❤︎❤︎❤︎ Thank you for sharing this amazing, lifechanging journey with us.<br />It&#39;s only been less than a month since I first started doing yoga with you but the improvements are unbelievable (even though I took rest days in between). I&#39;m feeling stronger, more centered, more present in the moment, calmer, and lost a lot of fat. Imagine this: I could fit into my shorts from my teenage years, after not being able to wear them for a few years!<br />I didn&#39;t even count the calories or limit myself from eating what I like. If I wanted some cookies, I make some for myself and eat it. My body does the portion controlling all by itself, so there&#39;s no way I&#39;d overeat something (even if I do, my body instinctively knows how to balance it the next day). I don&#39;t beat myself up for having cravings; I give my body what it wants, along with the nutrients it needs, of course. I&#39;m the happiest I&#39;ve ever been. I&#39;ve finally found a type of exercise (with meditative quality) that I can&#39;t wait to do every day. It really feels like coming home. I would like to thank you again, Adriene. You&#39;re awesome. Namaste. 🙏🏼",Trisha Prajnawirani,2020-04-15T08:43:04Z,0

Previously have I taken DEDICATE with me when I am traveling but have now added HOME during this Stay at Home time of the Corona Virus-19.  Not only has it kept my Yoga practice healthy and strong, it has provided calm to me during these uncertain times.  I should have expressed my deep gratitude for these practices before but want you to know how integral they have become to my physical and mental heath on. a daily basis.

"Oof, Adriene my dear! I felt this one today. Felt it physically, felt it emotionally. These hip centered poses are really what my body seems to crave! So many moments today just felt GOOD, as I breathed deeply and felt right in the moment with you. I really felt WITH you. Present. And trusting you to guide me through the practice. Felt teary more moments than one....&quot;If a friend asks you, what do you wish to you return to?&quot; seems so poignant, particularly now. I found myself wishing for the simplicity and joy of being in college just a few months ago, before these COVID-19 times. However, I also have the hope and faith that out of this trauma and tragedy we can grow, and hold with us more knowledge of staying close to loved ones, and prioritizing the needs of those most vulnerable in this world.

Thank you Adriene. <br /><br /><br /><br />During this quarantine I&#39;m really missing my yoga studio, a female ran, nonprofit magical place, that even has a dog like Benji. Me and the owner have become very close and her and the studio were like a second home, a safe space.  I hold SO much gratitude for the magic of that studio and the people there, but also for these videos and you Adriene for helping me realize that I AM my home. So much love to myself. Yes sometimes we may feel like we&#39;re &quot;loosing progress&quot; but there&#39;s no such thing.

"About four years ago, I had a horseback riding accident that rotated my hip bone 3/4 of the way around. I started treatment at the chiropractor&#39;s but I still had endless amounts of back, shoulder, and hip pain. This created a lot of pain associated with exercise, and I gained weight, making it even harder to exercise. Today is the second week of doing yoga every day with this series, and for the first time in four years, I have no pain in my back, shoulders, and hips. These hip-focused stretches were a little intense, but afterwards I&#39;m left with this <b>heavenly</b> feeling in my joints. Aside from all of the amazing physical results (I feel stronger, have lost some weight, and am more flexible), I&#39;ve had important breakthroughs in my mental health involving my self worth. I will return to healthy eating because I deserve it. I deserve to be strong and healthy. I deserve to eat nutritious food. I am worth it. Not every session is an intense breakthrough, but each is progress. Thank you so much, Adriene, for your work.",lauren,2020-04-12T20:12:02Z,0

"“In the philosophy of yoga we are not actually trying to ever work towards a goal of becoming someone or something that we are not already.” I loved this and I could really relate to that we have so many influencers these days and you think that who ever influences you is doing something right so you do your best to be like them or do things other people do that seems like they are happy but when thinking about this you realize you really just want to be the best version that you can be and find what makes you, you.

"Ok, first of all, this practice didn&#39;t feel like 27 minutes, it felt like just 10! Second, I loooooove hip openers, maybe my favourite kind of stretching. Now, about what I want to return, the first thing that I thought was &quot;normal life&quot;, since we&#39;re in self-isolation and the world is facing a horrible pandemic. But, I know that&#39;s something that&#39;s not under my control. So I changed it (I didn&#39;t have to think that much about it, it poped up immediately) and the thing I want to return to is writing. I&#39;ve always considered myself a creative person, but lately It&#39;s been harder for me to sit and write, coming with ideas for stories, and even journaling, and those were things I really used to love. I know it&#39;s in me, I just want to feel that connection again. Thanks to this practice I decided it&#39;s time. Maybe you&#39;ll find me doing some creative writing exercises tonight ;). Amazing practice, namaste 💖.",Kristina D'Antonio,2020-04-07T11:53:46Z,52

"This idea of &quot;return&quot; hit me hard. I started this yoga journey when the pandemic shut everything down.

And even if I wanted to return home to help my parents, I&#39;ll be stuck there, far away from my new &quot;home&quot; until this is all over.

I know that we won&#39;t &quot;return&quot; 100% to how we were before, but my thoughts acknowledged how different life is now, and how I want to return to a semblance of it. :)",Maryann Peterson,2020-04-01T13:23:20Z,0

"I started doing yoga again 14 days ago and promised to make time for myself. Today was the first day I really wasn’t going to show up... But I did and I feel so much better for it.

"Thank you Adriene. It&#39;s late March and I have just finished this day 14. The year so far has presented difficulties to me, some fairly intense, but I&#39;m enjoying making my way slowly through this series mixed in with some other yoga videos. I shared your channel on my Facebook page recently due to many people staying at home and have had at least one friend come on board really enjoying your videos and personality. We both agree you are genuine. For the time being a couple times a week we do the same video at the same time and laugh at things like the Beyonce chakra, open the pickle jars, namaste shark fin, and more! Speaking of returning, today I returned to reading the book March by Geraldine Brooks and also to drawing a sprig of Forsythia on grey paper with color pencil. Also since  my life has seen rough and churning waters in the mental space I felt like during pigeon (maybe also called rock dove!?) with my head down, I might just taste a return to feeling like I did before when I felt my spiritual path was more meaningful and loving. This feeling has been challenged lately - sometimes it&#39;s like the universe sets you up with some long dreamed of hopes, only to dash them on the rocks. However, nothing has really changed at the root of it all. Even on the darkest days our souls shine. Yoga practice can lead us to feeling our shared energy source from which came the dust, milky ways, planets and light that we perceive though a miracle.",Maria Moyser,2020-03-29T15:22:10Z,0

"So, last week, I was visiting friends in Malaysia and trying to decide if I should come home early because of the corona pandemic. I simply said the following prayer: &quot;Make it very clear what I&#39;m supposed to do.&quot; I thought I&#39;d start off my day of discernment by doing yoga with Adriene. I was on Day 12, which happens to be called &quot;Return.&quot; I decided to not read too much into that title. But as Adriene was saying, &quot;What do you need to return to?&quot;, one of my friends informed me that the U.S. just issued a Level-4-Health Advisory; she read the article&#39;s headline, &quot;U.S. citizens, return to the States!&quot; That was clear enough for me! In a time of panic, Adriene helped me with her calm wisdom. Thanks, Adriene!",Emily Grad,2020-03-25T23:50:26Z,1
"I started this journey by myself, but my boyfriend suprised me and joined around day 5 and we have been doing it together since.

"Hi Adriene, thank you very much for this beautiful series! I have grown so much in the practice thanks to your video&#39;s. Now there&#39;s one question that i have: What is your view on the necessity of &#39;counter-movements&#39; like when you&#39;re doing a position that makes the hips open, you then compensate it by a movement that closes the hips again? I am using the hips as example, because I notice that in your video&#39;s there are a lot of hip-opening movements but not so much the opposite. Sometimes it does not feel so comfortable for me so I mostly end with some counter movements. What&#39;s your opinion on it and have you got other tips for me how I might be more comfortable in these positions? Thanks a lot!!",Lien Stockmans,2020-02-22T08:18:18Z,0
this practice today is perfect because after day 13 Igot really sick for 4 days and today i &quot;return&quot;ed to doing yoga everyday (hopefully) and also the ending of this practice was just lovely coz today is &#39;Maha Shivratri&#39; ( Shiva is the god most yoga asanas are inspired by) and that last pose is how one would bow in a temple... manh i love when things work out like this,a_little_disquised,2020-02-21T14:58:32Z,0

"Return is a great name for this practice for me. As someone who had extreme hyper mobility in my hips when I was younger and am slowly losing it as I age, these hip opening positions were amazing! The reminded me of watching Sailor Moon when I was a literal child in a full split because that&#39;s how I was most comfortable sitting. I may not be able to do the splits anymore, but this practice helped me return to that energetic, child feeling of pure joy in movement. Pigeon has always been one of my favourite poses (probably due to the previously mentioned hyper mobility) and I felt so happy and comforted in the time we spent there.

I tink the only thing (emphasis: only) i&#39;d like to see is a way of discerning which videos are going to be more intensive (like day 6) and which are more lowkey (like the rest of Home so far). <br /><br />Do you organize your videos into more vinyasa style playlists?

I feel like she is a friend, i value the insights and the mantras that she shares through her videos. I love the idea that we aren&#39;t changing ourselves but simply using the breath and Asana practice to uncover, or rediscover parts of ourselevs that already exist that maybe we had forgotten about. I honestly don&#39;t know where I would be if I hadn&#39;t discovered my first yoga with adriene series in june 2018 it has honestly saved my life. throughout this time I have uncovered so mnay truths that I didn&#39;t even know Ihad within me.

"As I inevitably do every year, I fell behind with my &#39;30 days&#39; when I was away for the weekend and then had a bit of an internal strop about it (&quot;I&#39;ve failed so there&#39;s no point in finishing it now etc etc). But this is the first year that I&#39;ve picked it up again and have kept doing the 30 days, even though I&#39;m behind. Or, not really behind, but managing it at my own pace. So I&#39;ll see you on the 30th day but for me, that might be in February!",the devil wears tartan,2020-01-22T22:14:11Z,3

"I&#39;ve literally started crying after the first 5 minutes. There is a famous &quot;fitness guru&quot; in my country currently fat-shaming mothers who gained weight during and after their pregnancy saying that they and their body/skin are the main reason of divorce (the husband can not possibly find an overweight body sexy and will eventually cheat on the wife). Your approach is filled with love, kindness, you are always so patient with your followers and viewers. The contrast was so shocking to me today.  I can not possibly understand why someone thinks that negative thoughts and criticising millions of women/men will lead to a positive thing. I needed your words, Adrienne. Thank you.

"I&#39;m a few days behind on this challenge but have been doing it everyday since I started. Last night I was restless while trying to fall asleep, so I turned on a chakra cleansing sound meditation. When I got to the sacral chakra I suddenly thought, &quot;gosh I think I need a hip opener to release this.&quot; <br />I then fell asleep, woke up this morning to do this video, and saw that your email said it&#39;ll be a juicy hip-opener.<br /><br />As a yoga teacher who loves yoga and eastern philosophy about the body, I just want to say that whether subconsciously or not, you&#39;re doing a great job at directing our energy within. Thank you ❤️",Oriana Forsythe,2020-01-21T18:21:49Z,0
"The name of this lesson made me smile because today I actually returned to this challenge after taking nearly a week break from getting the terrible flu that&#39;s going around right now. In the past with so many other challenges like this I know I would have likely beaten myself up for missing so many days, but it&#39;s never felt like that ever since I started doing these YwA challenges a few years back. A 90/100 is still an &#39;A&#39;, &amp; it&#39;s certainly not reason to completely stop all efforts towards making yourself feel better. Not to mention I always end up just picking up where I left off and continuing the challenge daily til it&#39;s over. So I guess I&#39;m grateful I&#39;ve returned to finish the second half of this challenge, because it shows how much I&#39;ve grown in my understanding in what it means to commit!",Torrance Sullivan,2020-01-21T17:26:32Z,1

"Hi Adriene! As I was writing in my journal today, I remembered a poem I had written at the end of 2018. It&#39;s very relevant to today&#39;s practice (I&#39;m a few days behind 😊) so I&#39;d love to share it with you:<br /><br />&quot;A sweet return<br />Knees to chest, kissing skin faces<br />Popping toes, doodling hearts<br /><br />An embrace-<br />Of self<br />Of care<br />Of truth<br /><br />Alarms set, coffee prepped<br />Teeth brushed, clutter gone,<br />I&#39;m going home &quot;<br /><br />I love how themes that we&#39;ve talked about- and that I&#39;ve reflected on in the past - come up again and again in life.

"I started with basics, I wanted to return to sleeping well enough to dream and remember it, then thought about returning to treating myself with higher standards, and reducing the standards I held for my friends, because they may not hold themselves to the same standards as me, and it’s not fair to hold them to my expectations. But by the end of the practise, it was more clear than anything that I want to return to passion, find things that make my heart sing again. Hopefully this journey helps me remind myself of that.",ambiguousaesthetic,2020-01-20T20:44:35Z,0

The practice also helps not only my physical but also my spiritual body and I just love to return to myself during yoga. <br />This practice was exactly what I needed today to made me feel strong and alive.

"Yesterday you told us to move like we love ourselves.<br /><br />Two to three days before yesterday I was feeling restless due to painful emotions. I wasn&#39;t able to hear the loving words you were spreading because I was a bit blocked. <br /><br />A couple of months ago I&#39;ve set the intention to find peace and compassion within myself as my life&#39;s intention. Ever since I&#39;ve been structuring my life following this intention&#39;s pathway. Because structure/routine itself is an important one for the mind&#39;s rest. This new year I&#39;ve also set the intention to have courage, courage to let go, courage to continue, courage to learn to be a bit more still. <br /><br />I&#39;ve been following this structure as the only thing I have to do, no matter the feelings coming along. Showing up on my yoga mat, going to my kung fu lessons and all other lessons and moments I&#39;ve set out for myself. Each day this week I felt there had been a little bit more space created. Yesterday I was able to grasp again, to understand what you meant by moving like you love yourself. The whole day these words echoed in my mind and I was very grateful for the fact that you had been watering the right seeds in me.<br /><br />I moved like I loved myself yesterday. Slowly, surely, patiently, lovingly, gently, softly. Each step as important as the last, the next; the one in the now. I&#39;ll continue to move like I love myself today, and any other. <br />Because I love myself. I am learning each day how it feels to love (myself, as well as others).<br />Thank you :)",Daila Kuan-Yin,2020-01-18T12:24:41Z,4

I just wanted to point out at the start, when we did extended child’s pose, it wasn’t comfortable for me to have my knees all the way out because of the tightness in my hips.

the series so far is special in that you get noticeably stronger but most sessions somehow seem fairly easy- thank you adrienne and team! what do i desire: consistency (for which you need to be always alert but do you marry that with calm so you don&#39;t feel the need to &quot;unwind&quot; ever),Julia Irina Enescu,2020-01-17T23:11:18Z,0

"I want to get back into running and want to take up dancing, i was able to run an hour nonstop with a large bottle of water but i fell into depression and several comfort foods and moping around later i can only run about 20 minutes before breathing heavily and not having enough energy to do anything but 20 situps before getting up and possibly giving up the next day, so far yoga has helped with my back pain and that was only ten minutes in a different video so i have high hopes for a 30day yoga session to motivate me to get back to where i was headed before",Hey there,2020-01-17T20:06:28Z,0

"Been doing home inconsistently due to being sick, very annoying.<br /><br />This was far too slow for me today so I threw in some planks (side and normal) as my body was craving some instensity. <br /><br />I usually ignore these signals as someone who grew up very intellectual and in my head, I don’t particularly trust my body but I did this time and it felt good! Side plank felt good, it DID NOT feel like torture!! I even ENJOYED normal plank! WHAAAAT?!? <br /><br />And! My heels in downward dog touched the floor!!! WHAAAT?!?  <br /><br />I’m coming to realise that I’d rather show up to the mat and do something, do anything, than break practice and have a greater temptation to break practice again, because of how much it throws me off kilter when there’s no yoga/Adriene in my life. <br /><br />Thank youuu again!

"I haven&#39;t practiced in 2 days due to the fact that I&#39;ve been questioning if practicing goes against my Christian Faith, but today I&#39;m gonna try to practice seeming it truly has helped my anxiety and physical health, I&#39;ve been trying to decide;<br />is yoga like a Christmas tree and coffee, just something borrowed and enjoyed by other cultures and religions, or is it truly sacreligous due it&#39;s roots as a prayer ritual? if anyone could help me out here I&#39;d appreciate it, and if you&#39;re Christian and practice yoga, what are some things you&#39;ve changed to help it fit your faith better?<br /><br />thank you, and God bless. &lt;3",Vega Cassady,2020-01-17T16:12:54Z,0

"HELLO! <br />Makes me allwarm &amp; fuzzy inside reading all these comments :)<br /><br />I left this as a prompt to reflect on in my journal yesterday and I had a wee bit of resistance. I thoughtabout myself as a child and how I trended to the anxious/introvert side; I thought about how these days, I am generally feeling happy and whole and confident. Sometimes, I fret about doing TOO much work on personal development/inner growth - when I was in a place where I was binging more traditional self-help, it just unconsciously perpetuated the narrative that I wasn&#39;t DOING ENOUGH TO BE THE BEST POSSIBLE ME I COULD BE!<br />Now that I&#39;m writing this out, I can see the connection between Adriene&#39;s message at the beginning of the move - What we seek, we already have - and the idea of return. The spirit has everything it needs; and sometimes, the ego gets in the way with the narrative of what we are NOT or what we lack. If we just gently chip away at those patterns, we can then reveal whatever masterpiece has been there, all along. &quot;Return&quot; isn&#39;t so much about going back to being an older version of ourselves, but guiding us back to a place where we&#39;re aligned with our higher selves. <br /><br />[speaking of the resistance - i did not journal, but it did dissipate once i actually sat down HERE and found a flow of expression, after a couple false starts/mini-youtube + social media binges. yay! i thought maybe i was &quot;forcing it&quot;... how often we think we&#39;re stuck, when we really just need to let process breathe without the pressure of perfection, profundity, and...some other p-word.]<br /><br />I also had a mini-&quot;aha!&quot; moment when I thought about how in the new year, we often focus on behaviors and habits we want to change (often around what we could be doing to be &quot;better&quot;), whereas yoga encourages us to change our way of being. Much more effective overall, than forcing and muscling our way into becoming a brand-new person -- with that extra &quot;oomph&quot; of intention and attention, we can let the process unfold at a more natural, loving pace. <br />it&#39;s getting later now; I&#39;m happy with how the day went and how I followed through on my intentions, but still haven&#39;t done my daily yoga yet! off I go to RESET :) <br /><br />[i&#39;m very cheery writing this - hopefully it&#39;s just a general mood and i didn&#39;t late afternoon OD on green tea]<br />EDIT/P.S. On a side note, when I was actually doing the practice, the words that came up for me were: Playfulness, stability, and creativity!",Grace Kim,2020-01-17T03:23:48Z,0

"It was my birthday yesterday and I didn&#39;t have the time to come to the mat and enjoy this little part of my day. I would be lying if I said I wasn&#39;t delaying this practice anytime I looked at the clock... but each day I come back is a reminder of why I&#39;ve been here for 14 days now, I just feel so good. It allows me to relax and think in a clearer and more helpful way about things, process feelings; I just love it so much, I laugh and feel plainly good. And I&#39;m nowhere near what I would like my life to be like, but your videos have made it less worrying and pendant, when I&#39;m doing this I feel I have time and space and that it is all I need. I hope I can return to discipline, but in a healthy way now... I destroyed my body once and felt proud of it, and even now I sometimes want to go back there because I only remember the outside benefits I got from it, but I know I wasn&#39;t happy and... maybe I went all those steps back to where I started because it wasn&#39;t the right path and I was meant to be here today, doing this practice and being the slightess bit closer to a good life... trully thank you, Adriene♥",Celichan905,2020-01-17T02:54:14Z,0

"Yesterday I posted about my brother passing, and not being on the mat for a couple of days. May I please share with you? He had been estranged from the family for years. Monday I got the call about his location and a request to withdraw life support. That evening, I went to the mat for “nurture”. How timely. I missed coming to the mat the next two days, as I processed this tragedy, but in looking at the invitations, I am called to “return”, just as my brother was returned to me, just hours before his passing. Thank you! Tonight I return to the mat.",Angela Steelman,2020-01-17T00:55:01Z,0

"Woooooow, this was my favorite practice so far (for this 30-day journey, at least!) I think partially due to the timing... I went horse-back riding yesterday and I&#39;m still quite out of practice with that so my hips got quite the work out. So stretching my hips today felt AMAZING. And today I had a very emotional and tiring day so I&#39;d like to think that the hip openers will help settle some of those emotions. So far, so good!",Gracie Siegrist,2020-01-16T04:05:49Z,0

"On the days where I don&#39;t have a chance to get to the mat right after I wake up, I&#39;m realizing how much I look forward to and anticipate the practice at the end of the day - it&#39;s not a chore or something I have to do, it&#39;s something I&#39;m excited to do and every practice just reminds me of that. I think it&#39;s fitting that this 30 day journey is called home - when you asked us to think about what we wanted to return to, home (and everything that it represents) is what came to mind. Hopefully by the time this journey ends, I&#39;ll be able to find a sense of home no matter where I am.",ashah213,2020-01-16T03:41:01Z,0

"This was such a meaningful practice. When I read today’s email I decided I wanted to go back to being healthy, to exercise regularly and to read more. Trough the practice I felt extremely happy because I truly felt the realization that I already am all that I want to be. At the end of the practice I realized I’ve been hurt, I’ve been played with and I’ve been taken for granted, that made me hide my vulnerabilities with the ones I love and what hurt me the most is that I don’t trust anyone anymore, not even myself. I’m in shock because I believe from the bottom of my heart that there’s no other way I could’ve realized this, other than by this beautiful journey.

"When I found out this was a practice aimed at the hips I was a little nervous because my left hip socket has been hurting for a little over a week now and I was afraid this would upset it. But, I wasn’t going to let that stop my journey home! After this practice my hip feels practically new, as if nothing had ever hurt in the first place! Thanks for this journey, Adriene.

I can write by hand longer without feeling stabbing pain going up my arm, starting at my wrist. <br />It honestly feels like a cage has been let away, allowing me to fly.",Mammon,2020-01-16T03:18:53Z,0

"I have struggled with my weight for 28 years. My daughter encouraged me to try this 30 day challenge as part of my lifestyle change for the new year. It has been amazing thus far. I find that the body I currently inhabit ,makes some of my poses and movements difficult- hard to slide a leg up when your thigh and stomach are the biggest they&#39;ve ever been, lol; but Adriene&#39;s persistent commentary regarding what feels right for me is so encouraging. I haven&#39;t given up! I have found that I can put yoga blocks under my hands and it allows me to cushion my wrists a little more and it gives just enough space for my movement to flow a little easier while still challenging me. Additionally, I was in an auto accident 2 years ago-my back has been in real discomfort for the  past few months especially - peak of discomfort- started doing the 30 day yoga challenge and have felt my back and hips adjust to a better alignment. The pain is nearly gone.  Today I focused on a  return to a state of feeling one with my body rather than feeling my body is the enemy. Thank you for making this community possible, Adriene. Namaste",Jennie Rutowski,2020-01-16T02:40:16Z,0

Day 14 done! I ended up doing this far later than planned due to being out most of the day but it was such a soothing practice for my hips which had been feeling the last few days of work. A combination of gentle and work as I could feel my arms shaking when they were together over my head at the end there even though it didn&#39;t feel like my arms were having any sort of intense workout. Just goes to show how much the micro movements in yoga and holding really do build muscle slowly but surely &lt;3,Emily Gleeson,2020-01-16T02:06:39Z,0

So cute and comfy, and they had little grippy things on the bottoms, and I was able to keep a great awareness through my feet (the seat of my choice at the end was a kneeling posture with the &quot;yoga for the feet&quot; thing going on haha).<br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve been walking to work lately (so good!) and yesterday I had my weekly dance class, so my legs definitely needed some love.

"I’m the very type for forcing poses which I wasn’t really ready yet back then. I must admit I still am, but Adriene slows the way I try by not ever forcing what my body couldn’t do.

I was talking to my sister before my practice and she was struggling with feel like her old bad habits made her inferior and like she could not grow and endure her day to day task, I literally told her the same advice that Adriene said today well along the lines of it, that it&#39;s okay to have  bad days but don&#39;t get stuck there, that she had to find the strength to keep going. Adriene had told us this in previous practices last year and that has helped me to stick with my practice and in my day to day life it kept me from giving yup and quitting easily and I thank u Adriene cause it not only helped me but today it helped my sister, this practice was really for us. I want to return to healthier eating habits, I feel like I have dropped the ball on it and just in general become more conscious about my routines and let them be more healthier so that it become a lifestyle rather than just something I am doing for the sake of doing it, you know what I mean. Adriene once again I enjoyed this practice, even though my right hip was tight I laughed and had fun which made it so much more enjoyable and I all thanks u being our Friend and teacher guiding us along our individual journey so thank you much love and Namaste 💞💗💓💖❤🙏",Vanessa Morris,2020-01-16T00:25:37Z,0
"I&#39;m glad because my flexibility was very good when I did Salamba-Kapotâsana. A juicy, happy hip practice! I feel totally rested.  I felt increased energy and strength coursing through me.

"YES HIP OPENERS 🙌 I&#39;m naturally open in the hips, so I tend to push myself into these shapes with ease. BUT! You reminded me to return to a beginner&#39;s mindset. I checked Ego at the door and moved carefully and mindfully. There&#39;s a sense of pride that comes with that and I felt better moving in these postures than I would have had I been jumping into pigeon mindlessly. You&#39;re a great teacher ❤️",GrayLandscapes,2020-01-16T00:09:08Z,0

I&#39;d just come from someone being very antagonizing, followed by patronizing, and I kept falling back to thinking about that all through the session, and then was reminded by your words to return to thinking about my breath and better things.  And although I was far from perfect I did the best I could right now, at this moment, and that was enough.  So thank you.",kittis888,2020-01-15T22:11:20Z,0

"Ahhh, child pose... My favorite pose! 😂 Today was pretty great, especially considering that I didn&#39;t want to do something hard or at least something that required some strength and effort. I enjoyed the pigeon pose, it felt good to have enough time to relax into that pose. As for the theme, I want to (or should I say must) return to my spirituality and faith. That&#39;s what my entire (!!!) being has been craving and screaming for but had no answer on my part.

Than I start to exercise with your videos. And felt so good. And here we go again. Another challenge for our mind and bodies. Another 30 days of yoga. I learned a lot about myself this year.

"When you shared the song Return to Innocence by Enigma....I immediately knew that there was going to be something that wanted to come to the surface. Something deep and heavy. I embarked on this journey home to me, so I decided to embrace it instead of run from it. My younger brother loved the band Enigma. He introduced the very song that you shared today because he thought I would love it, and I did. Months after, he committed suicide. It was my first experience with total utter devastation. I was 28 at the time, with 3 little girls of my own, but all I wanted was to return to a time in my life when all I had to worry about was what color crayon I was going to use. I didn&#39;t want to have to be an adult navigating the shattering of my heart. Today, on the mat, I embraced that 28 year old me and helped us release that deep distrust of life so that we can return, in whatever form and shape it takes...to innocence. To trust life and it&#39;s unfolding. To trust myself...that I can.",Jennifer Allen,2020-01-15T21:41:03Z,15

"It was a really good practice, I feel really good after each one since the January 2nd ! I&#39;d like to thank you for your help, my New Year resolution was to take care of myself, something that I leave behind for a while…. And this Journey of HOME really helps me to stick to it. Even if I have final exams this month, I take the time for myself to not fall into my usual stress spiral. So this is a big thank !<br /><br />I just thought this : maybe, at the end of the practice, you could tell us if you have a recommendation about the time we practice the next day ? I means some practices are better in the morning and others during the evening, even if most of them can be done at any time. It is just that sometimes (like today), I can&#39;t do this in the Morning (I have to leave home before you publish the video) and I can&#39;t make them before the evening, but sometimes the practice is quite energizing and it is not the best before bed. I Don&#39;t really know if I&#39;m clear, but I hope so ^^<br /><br />Anyway, THANK YOU Adriene, for your smile, your kindness, your laugh, that little smile of &quot;Yeah, one more time, it is hard but you can do it&quot;, those sentences of kindness and enhancement, and all those litlle things (Benji included) that make me stick to this practice ! You seem to be a really good person, and thank you for sharing this goodness with us. And for this introspection, one of those that make sometimes cry and sometimes laugh, but anyway that make feel at peace.<br /><br />Lots of thanks and love from Belgium !",Marie-Va Rougfrt,2020-01-15T21:15:48Z,0
"Hello Adriene! Thank you for reminding us what do we want to return to on day 14. I enjoy that you teach a flow based on what each persons body needs for that day, it is so amazing to know there are teachers like you available to us. When you asked what do I want to return to, I would have to say it is the moments of realizing how far Ive come and to be able to pause in the moment of all birth and really have gratitude and feel empowered in the feminine aspect of my journey ( different angles and perspectives come into play for different parts of the cycle).

Then 30 minutes later, after a lot of &quot;I don&#39;t want tos, I don&#39;t have enough energys, I packed my bag and went to my judo practice. Got home at around 9 and was sitting in bed, wanting nothing more than to just sleep, but I grabbed my yoga mat and I decided that I AM going to go through these 30 days, and now I regret nothing.

I were doing mostly a child pose, but I felt peace. I also feel bad for me feeling like this, but somehow I got to a little moment of silence where I didn&#39;t think about anything. I wanted to return spending time with my friends and family. And I will do that. But right now, I&#39;m gonna go to sleep.<br /><br /><br />Thank you Adriene, as always.",kaisa,2020-01-15T20:29:25Z,0
What does your heart say when a friend asks you what you want to return to? That sort of threw me for a loop. It is a slightly different think when you my good friend asks me that question vs. when I ask myself. So I&#39;m just going to think about it. Maybe I will even be luck and dream about it.,Hillside Homestead,2020-01-15T20:27:19Z,0

"I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s day 14 and I only skipped 2 days so far. This year I&#39;m trying to be softer with myself, so I decided to take it day by day and just go to sleep if I&#39;m too tired to show up on the mat. So all the days I decided to skip it, I did it as a conscious decision, which led to me not feeling like a failure, which in turn helped me to show up again instead of just stopping the challenge. This has been a huge learning for me so far and I just wanted to share it with you guys.",MissCamChoco,2020-01-15T19:58:59Z,0

"Omg! This practice just killed me emotionally. Not only am I super proud of my obvious progress in hip flexibility, but the notion of ‘returning’ really brought home a lot for me. The feelings that came up were ‘returning’ back to childhood, purity of spirit and body, when I listened to myself without trying, when my body knew exactly what to do without me ‘trying’, before all the things that caused trauma that shaped my later life, when everything and myself were just as it were...that’s where I’m returning to. And I LOVED the idea of already being/having everything I want to be/have...just returning to it as oppose to trying to obtain it. Made me sob at the end. 🙏🏾",Taylor Parris,2020-01-15T19:50:18Z,0

I had it confirmed that I am clairsentient by a clairvoyance practitioner and I am excited to learn more of my gifts. I feel so relaxed after this practice and am feeling I have finally returned home. I am so grateful for the collective energy of this 30 day journey!

"I need a daily reminder to tell me &quot;that which we desire we already possess&quot;. Because of my anxiety, it&#39;s easy to forget my own potential for stillness and serenity.

"I haven’t done all the videos of Home, so today’s title was really nice to return and start again☺️ I didn’t beat myself up over not showing up every day.

I hope to show up consistently from now on.<br /><br />“Where do you want to go back to?”<br />For me personally, I want to go back to the me who doesn’t pressure myself to do things. The me who doesn’t need to prove herself and doesn’t feel the need to get validation from everyone. The me who always wanted to learn new things without feeling bad for not being good at something right away. <br />And most importantly the me who doesn’t overthink everything or takes everything so seriously.<br /><br />I’m slowly getting there by practicing yoga, meditation and gratitude on a daily basis. <br /><br />Thank you for providing this amazing free program💖 I feel so welcomed every time I click on a video.",Pitchy Peach,2020-01-15T18:27:21Z,0

"Fun practice, this made the back hip areas feel yummy.  On my right side especially since the Sciatic Nerve is wanting to awake.  I&#39;m going forward with doing bridges instead of doing a boat pose as a replacement.  I remember you said your chiropractor said those were recommended.  The lizard pose is always fun to do, I really did feel the stretch in that, and the pigeon poses too; those are what my hips needed.

I am not trying to force myself like all the other times I&#39;ve tried, and failed, to give up the ED. This time, there is an ease, a compassion, and a grace that has come over me with daily yoga.

"Thank you! this was SO good and big for me. when you asked us what we are returning home to, it was clear for me... in an @EdMylett  talk he spoke about this idea that the creator has an idea of who you are for this life - he/ she has built all of this amazing potential in you to be the best version of yourself - Ed says that at the end of life when we return to the heavens we get to meet this &quot;best&quot; version of ourselves - we may be exactly that persons twin or we may be far from who they are because we have gotten off course or we may have gotten caught up in fear doubt or worry... today when you asked I made a commitment to return to that version of myself - like you said, it is there already and I LOVED that!!! so I am just returning to that. I am feeling more &#39;on course&#39; because of todays love-filled practice and I am once (twice, three times- hahahahaha- you are SO cute!) again deeply grateful for you and your teachings! xoxoxo",Donna Sonkin Shaw,2020-01-15T12:23:46Z,0

"This morning I didn’t feel the want to get out of bed. I pressed the snooze button multiple times. I stayed in bed 1.30h after waking up. This is something that I want to change although sometimes it gets me frustrated and then the self compassion and self love comes in. During the yoga and meditation practice this morning, I just didn’t feel connected as I would like to feel. Although it makes me frustrated sometimes, because dealing with anxiety and obsessive compulsive thinking you just crave that feeling of connection, Love and peace, it’s the perfect state of relief and healing! And many times before, that’s what made me give up from building these healing habits, not feeling or reaching that state where I find the perfect relief when I’m doing them, but I have to accept it and it’s alright, it’s part of the journey, the process. It’s still loving and healing. Thank you Adriene for being part of my journey home, and thank you to the loving community you’ve created here. Namaste 🙏",Carolina Veríssimo,2020-01-15T11:56:11Z,41

"the time that I devote myself to practicing Home is precious. I honor this opportunity that I give myself and I honor myself, Adriane and all participants here.<br />Today I have got direct synchronicity with the name of the practice and my night dream. <br /><br />tonight I dreamed that I gave birth to a New Girl. She is so different and happiness that I experienced in a dream is also different in feelings, new or forgotten.<br /><br />I remembered that feeling of happiness from another time and space. It was such a multidimensional dream that I still breathe into it.<br /><br />the most important feeling I have now from this information about the girl is she is free.<br />and even someone wanted to take her away from me (the reason said to me by a person I needed some rest) I refused.<br />I was sooooo strong in my decision.<br /><br />Because the girl brings me such Joy! And there are no issues with the little kid! She is already done in spite she is newborn!<br />This felt into the dream as a Miracle! And I accepted this quickly. No doubt!<br /><br />A week ago, I dreamed that I was 9 month prego and that the child would be different, it will be a New Human.<br />The new story successive unfolds into my night dream state and it is so exciting!<br />thank you!

Yesterday I was thinking that a nice hip practice would be so good and look at what we got today! ❤️ For me I mainly want to come HOME to my peaceful and calm self again with a positive, strong and healthy attitude. I lost myself somewhere on the road to trying to be the perfect mom and wife to be ☹️ But last december I finally realised that this is near impossible and that it would be better if I feel better about myself. To get my old self back from before being a mom. Slowly but steady I&#39;m getting there! ❤️ And for real, everyone at home benefits from it.

"I didn&#39;t manage yesterday&#39;s video, I had a train to catch SUPER early in the morning, business meetings all day and I didn&#39;t get home untill stupidly late, but I&#39;ve noticed something interesting... I didn&#39;t beat myself up about it, And I came back today! That is actually pretty huge for me. It is one of the very few times in my life i haven&#39;t felt like I have failed by not doing something I should have done and beaten myself up about it. It was unavoidable but even then, I usually would have felt like I&#39;d failed the whole 30 days... But because I don&#39;t see It as a failure, I didn&#39;t use it as an excuse to stop the whole thing &#39;because its all ruined now&#39; and I was SO excited to get back into the mat this morning! I think yoga is starting to stick, I think it&#39;s becoming a happy place 😁😁😁",Sammy K,2020-01-15T07:54:42Z,46

"Doing yoga with Adriene has brought me some of my favourite moments over the past few years. Like the time I started laughing to myself while rolling around in Happy Baby. And the time I started crying mid-practice, and saw and heard my tears dropping quietly onto the mat. The time I managed Crow Pose for a few seconds and really felt like I was flying. The time I &#39;took up space&#39; in Star Pose and realised how much needless energy I have spent in my life trying to make myself smaller and less visible, both physically and mentally. I returned to all this in today&#39;s practice. Thank you Adriene, as always. Anyone else have some beautiful yoga memories they&#39;d like to return to today?",Ilinx,2020-01-15T06:54:54Z,1784

"We&#39;re legit two weeks in everybody. I woke half an hour earlier today to prepare for this particular practice as planned. I am trying to adopt a new lifestyle, become a better version of myself and remind myself of the reason why I chose to take this journey &quot;Home&quot; by returning to the breath and studying what I&#39;m feeling from the inside out. I can tell this one&#39;s gonna feel good for me. Thanks, Adriene, for yet another empowering practice. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2020-01-15T06:08:15Z,5
"The same here !! it worked and it indeed helps me in every part of good reminder.I truly love myself more by practicing with YWA community over the last year and half. Kinder attention to myself, much more gentle to my body and soul. Plus I am on the self transformation journey continuously and now this year I am starting to<br /> quit my alcohol drinks consumption. even though i considered my self an average mindful social dinker but now since HOME came in this year, I think it is time !!",Linda Zhang,2020-01-15T06:56:10Z,2
