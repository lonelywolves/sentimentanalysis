"This session continues to help us learn about the philosophy of yoga too.  <br /><br />For example, snuggling up to the role of the observer has changed my whole life. <br /><br />Off the mat, this practice has allowed me to pause more, and notice my reaction before  I make a choice on how I want to consciously react to that emotional response. This has helped me to be a better listener, to move with more mindfulness, and to act with greater intention and purpose.",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-09T14:18:54Z,1015
Thank you Adriene.  I have been pretty stressed these last few days.,Fer-De-Lance,2021-04-14T16:08:39Z,0
"Awwww, being my own, best, observer of my thoughts and emotions and being aware of them and choosing to react, respond, or just think &quot;How important IS this?&quot;, &quot;Take it easy&quot;, and &quot;Keep an open mind&quot; work well for me. &lt;3 I have a stiff knee with arthritis so the first sit and reach forward asana was relatively impossible, thus I adapted it as best I could. &quot;Happy Baby&quot; was such a treat for me, fully of joy, that it&#39;s never too late to be a Happy Baby. &lt;3 Namaste, Adriene &lt;3",Jan Joyce Lehde,2021-03-25T15:10:31Z,0

Day 8: I started this journey on 21 March. I am inspired by all of you lovely people and I got this idea (on day 4) to leave a comment every day after each session.

@Stefana Lavinia Day 8 checking in :) I so agree! This practice is a way to get reconnected with ourselves first and foremost. I held back from doing yoga for years because I didn&#39;t want to be confronted with how &quot;limited&quot; I was in flexibility. I love the kindess of Adrienes voice while I have a little voice in my mind that says &quot;that&#39;s all you can do?&quot; I&#39;m so grateful I decided to do this 30 day series!,crazytlccool,2021-03-31T02:28:05Z,0
"This is exactly what I needed today. At min 6 my hips were really painful, I was nowhere near putting my forearms on the ground. I realise that one of the best things about yoga is learning my body, really knowing how it feels, where there is strength, where I&#39;m limited. I agree with Adrianne that it&#39;s so important to go inwards because I bet most of us are so disconnected from ourselves and our bodies running on autopilot most of the time. I&#39;m so thankful I&#39;m working on this.",Stefana Lavinia,2021-03-28T11:02:08Z,1

"I just woke up, but I was really doubting whether doing today&#39;s practice. I stayed up super late doing a motivation letter and I am feeling exhausted. Yes, first thing in the morning. Fun. So seeing this practice is called &quot;Snuggle&quot;, I toughend up and went to the mat. So glad I did that. I still feel like I&#39;m too stiff for some the exercises (when Adriene had her legs crossed and went to the forearms I couldn&#39;t even cross my legs properly), but I&#39;m showing up and doing the best I can. With yoga, I&#39;m being able to shut for half an hour my inner critic. It doesn&#39;t seem much, but it&#39;s such a huge accomplishment for me... So yeah.

Love the idea of ‚Äòsnuggle‚Äô - it‚Äôs been hard to get up n running with the practice this month ... when I was a child I had this cutest pony called ‚ÄòMarcus‚Äô. He was a light palomino 12.5hands. After morning mucking out in the stable yard Marcus would lay down and I used to snuggle into his side near his head - he was this sweetest of ponies and I fed off this mutual moment of snuggle ü§ç‚ú®,Venetia Robinson,2021-01-26T15:32:38Z,0

"So in 2021, I have pledged to do 300 days of yoga as part of my get healthier plan.  This is about my 5th or 6th Adriene 30 day series but it&#39;s been a a year or so since I&#39;ve done any.   I&#39;m not a religious or spiritual person in any way (no 3rd eye for me), meditation makes me anxious and angry and, physically, I could be the worst person at yoga ever (I&#39;m over 50, I&#39;m overweight, my heels have never touched the ground in downward dog, I swear my arms are too short as I can&#39;t even wrap them around my knees when on my back, I have arthritis in both knees and one thumb, and the only &quot;crow&quot; that will ever be in my life is the crow that I eat!) BUT I am so thankful for Adriene and these series as I can do them in the privacy of my own home and she never makes me feel like a yoga loser for what I can&#39;t do.  I&#39;ve learned not to focus on what I can&#39;t do but to modify for what I can and at the end of every session, I find that I have improved, even if in the tiniest bit, in some form - breathing, flexibility, balance - SOMETHING.   By the end of a 30 day session (which honestly may take me 32-35 days) I feel better in my body and mind.  All of this to say, even if you don&#39;t think yoga is for you or that you can&#39;t do it...you CAN.   It may not be perfect, heck it may not even be pretty, but you will thank yourself in the long run.",Mary Blankenship,2021-01-11T19:18:31Z,1

"Day 8:<br /><br />It says some things about me that I waded through the first week of practice, in spite of aching muscles and poses I&#39;d never seen before, and kept up every single day, and it&#39;s this kind self-care practice that I put off for an entire day instead.<br /><br />It&#39;s been a long, hard, strange, terrible week, and I am being kind to myself this weekend.  I&#39;m glad to have had this.  I&#39;m glad to have brought myself to do it.  I knew it would be warm and good and feel good to do, and I let it slide away for a day and a half because, well, I didn&#39;t need to push myself and force myself to do something that felt GOOD, did I?  I only got myself to the mat by reminding myself that I wouldn&#39;t feel able to do the hard, important things if I didn&#39;t get through this nice one first.<br /><br />The nice things are important too.  This was worth my time, not just as a necessary unskippable step in the thirty days, but on its own merit.  I&#39;m glad to have done it.<br /><br />Everyone else was on Day 9 today, but I&#39;ll do Day 9 tomorrow, and if I stay a day behind for the rest of the month so be it.  I&#39;m still not alone.  Thousands of people are a day behind, or two days, or three.  Thousands of people will find this sequence in the future, next week or next month or next year, and it will still be worth it.

I let it out while staying within the pose and suddenly I noticed that i had gone deeper into the posture! That posture was well needed!!!,Savannah Buckner,2021-01-11T00:16:41Z,0

"Thank you so much for this practice. In Savasana I had a vision of myself being in the place where I will move to at the end of this year, so my partner and I can live together. I have been very worried about the move and about me losing everything and the fear of not making it. Worries that make me doubt my decision. But in that moment, picturing the fresh air and the sun on my skin, in the garden of my new home, I felt content. I felt my heart pulling me deeper into that vision. I have never felt such connection before and it made me tear up in joy and relief. I am on the right path. I know it. I can feel it in my heart right now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

One was that I got interupted by my brother and then when I return Adriene immediately said &quot;Return to your breath&quot; and I smiled and found it so easy to reconnect.<br />The second was that Adriene encouraged us to find our happy place, I searched and searched and became so worried when I couldn&#39;t find something to connect to. Then I realized I didn&#39;t have to because I was already in my happy place, on my mat with my candles and Adriene, this is my happy place.",Audree Clint,2021-01-10T09:30:19Z,0
that was actually perfect to do after day 9 - as I accidentally did! Moments of pain in my right knee - that close cross legged position is hard for me - such a difference in sides....lower back issues for me clearly because I couldn&#39;t even get my elbows on the floor . Other poses a doddle -I love the twists - spent a bit longer there and who couldn&#39;t love the two legged baby pose  :)) One to revisit. Thank you x,Gabriella Buckingham,2021-01-10T08:50:46Z,0

"Thanks again Adriene! Awesome practice.<br /><br />1. When you said the thing about self massage and acknowledging what you already have, I teared up.<br /><br />2. When you said &quot;or maybe pretend like you&#39;re a baby animal&quot; I was cracking up. My room mates were prob like &quot;uh... I thought she said she was going into her room to do yoga...&quot;<br /><br />3. Today was the first time in probably two years when I&#39;ve been able to get my left shoulder to the floor in that reclined twist. I had lots of injuries in that shoulder from being hyperflexible during cheerleading in high school and then lifting inventory and stocking shelves when I worked retail in my early 20s. That was a huge moment for me!",Cassie Rae,2021-01-09T21:50:48Z,0
Combined day 7 and 8 together. Was a good sequence.

"I‚Äôm really enjoying this 30 day challenge and I have stuck at it so far. Just one move today was too challenging for me - sitting crossed legs, leaning forward with either elbows or arms/hands on floor out front, fully bent over from the hips. I personally have trouble just crossing my legs. There was no way I could fold over and put my elbows on the floor. I could just about touch the floor with my fingertips. I would have appreciated an alternative. I‚Äôll be back tomorrow though. Little by little. Thanks Adriene.",Sian Griffiths,2021-01-09T18:53:51Z,0

I&#39;ve been doing Yoga with Adrienne for 6 years. I always do the annual 30 day January practice.  The <br>Breath practice is just what I needed.

I started late 1/4 but so far everyday is a gem &amp; a welcome respite from our angry world plus it&#39;s kicking my butt.  Thank You Adrienne for a great practice.

Something about the way she phrases the benefits (snuggling up, comforting, deep relaxing) of these poses just triggers me into frustration and anger because I physically can&#39;t do these moves.

This yoga journey gave me extra clarity and helped me to make an awfully difficult, but rightful decision. I ended this relationship last night. I want to thank you all for this snuggle session as I really needed it, and after a very long walk through the city this afternoon, I feel so much better, even though the pain will remain for a little while. Take care, everyone doing well, and everyone going through some things right now. Namast√©.",Jelle V,2021-01-09T15:55:46Z,0

"hey heather, spontaneous thoughts on this:<br />If you mean the &quot;lying on the back, foot over knee cross&quot; pose: try to place your ankle on your knee, not just the foot; it should also help to flex the foot; if that  doesn&#39;t help, maybe don&#39;t push your knee away from you, rather pull it in a bit until you don&#39;t feel strain on your ankle anymore. Yoga poses should never hurt, especially not in the joints. <br />If you mean the &quot;cross legged seat, then folding over&quot; pose: my ankles hurt too, maybe because I used a super thin yoga mat. I think some people just have more sensitive ankles...I personally am trying not to go too deep into the pose and I&#39;ll definitely use a thicker mat next time / put some towels/blankets under my normal one :)",Lisa Laquelle,2021-01-09T18:30:10Z,0

"@Shannon Pitts  thank you for this answer, i really appreciate it! sounds like my knee pain (and stress level haha) might be the same as yours, so i‚Äôll keep on the stretching and try to target some thigh and calves muscles! glad to hear that it has helped you:) lots of love.",Carina,2021-01-09T12:58:07Z,0
"When I went to a Dr for knee pain they just gave pain killers, but a friend recommended a physical therapist. When I went, she discovered my pain was actually being caused by tightness in my thigh and calve muscles which was then pulling my knee out of alignment. That&#39;s actually what made me begin doing yoga more regularly (that and my crazy stress LOL). Every person&#39;s body is different, but perhaps your knee pain is also caused by muscle tightness? She had me do stretches and recommended daily stretches/yoga (she said yoga for me to also manage stress because stress can also tighten our muscles) and used KT tape to help stabilize my knee and prevent some muscle tightness. I was honestly a little skeptical at first, but I&#39;m now relatively pain free. Full disclosure, it&#39;s been weeks of stretches and tape...my muscles kept wanting to tighten back up and I had to switch my chair at work). Everyone is different though, hopefully my experience is the same for you and simple stretches/yoga and tape will help, but never ignore chronic pain.
