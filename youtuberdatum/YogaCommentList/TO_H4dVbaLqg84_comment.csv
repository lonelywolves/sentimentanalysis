"I set the intention I always do, every day that I get onto the mat (which has been nearly a year 😯). To practice grace. To live with grace. To embody grace. And boy is it a &quot;practice&quot; not a &quot;doing&quot;. Thank you so much for all you do Adriene, to guide us through these practices and lead us on this spiritual journey that has changed my life 🙏 Namaste, my dear friend, whom I have never met.",Marina V,2021-03-01T00:54:53Z,0

"Day 58 Adriene. Wow. Thank you. I haven&#39;t been feeling too great the past couple of days but I kept this beautiful commitment to myself to show up for daily yoga with you, and with all the ups and downs, I have this one very real experience that we&#39;re sharing, with thousands more, and I feel so so good for it. Also, I thought today that I should perhaps write more about what I feel about this whole yoga journey, telling myself that well, &quot;I won&#39;t be a beginner like this forever, so may as well soak it all in, and write it all down.&quot; So that will be a grand new addition to March&#39;s MOVE. A major move away from habits, people, energies, actions and anything else that absolutely no longer serves me. I&#39;m so pumped for this! Thank you for the newsletter, just read it before writing this comment and it was just the energy I needed. Vibesssss!!! I couldn&#39;t be more thankful for you. No, I actually could be! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I love you! I appreciate you! <br /><br />Journey mates! Aluta continua! We are alive. Do you know what that means? It means that we got this! There&#39;s no going wrong, even if we tried! Buckle up! We &#39;bout to MOVE ALL THE WAY UP! I love you all.",Serena Ndekeremo,2021-02-28T18:15:15Z,0

"Not gonna lie, today&#39;s Sunday Love Letter saw me with tears in my eyes. &quot;Do you feel like you are being called to know yourself better lately?&quot; Yes. For awhile now.

"Any suggestions for those of us with &quot;fake&quot; joints. I have two hips (2002 and 2017) and one knee (replaced twice 2003 and 2018) and some of the positions are fairly uncomfortable. For instance I use a folded blanker under my knees for just about everything or otherwise it is two uncomfortable. I can do most of the positions but still have problems with balance (loss of proprioception after chemotherapy. It is overall a great experience, that I started at the tender age of 74 - still doing dialy for two months. Thank you for your calm voice and commitment to peace.",Rob Robson,2021-02-28T17:20:32Z,0

"Can&#39;t believe today is the last of February, it felt so fast! I am so happy though to continue this journey and commit to 365 days of yoga with you along to many beautiful people around the world. It hits differently every time I finish one month of yoga and realize that at this time, all of us are about to begin the next chapter of our life and goodbye to what no longer serves us. I am so glad I am in this and proud of myself for showing up every single day even at times when I didn&#39;t feel like. Now its like a new habit I stuck to but also reminding myself that its all okay if I don&#39;t practice, it doesn&#39;t make me less worth, less loving or less of a person. I am whole, we all are whole just the way we are and not what we do or say. All of us should be proud of what we committed to this date during these hard times, its time we celebrate from within and cherish our being. Namaste peeps. THANK YOU Adriene and Benji love you both so much! sending hugs through your screen xx",Sarah A,2021-02-28T17:07:50Z,1

"Came to this practice from today&#39;s Sunday letter and it was just the reminder I needed! I have been neglecting my yoga practice the past couple of weeks on account of being too busy, but if  I&#39;m being honest it&#39;s not the kind of busy where I literally do not have half an hour for myself. Rather it&#39;s the busy where I <b>feel</b> I do not have the time and think I should cut out anything that isn&#39;t necessary. Oh such faulty thinking... The reminder to fill my cup was much needed and welcomed, thank you Adriene &lt;3 <br />And to anyone out there with similar though patterns, let this comment be your reminder: the half an hour you carve out for yourself for your health, sanity, calmness, care <b>is not</b> better spent on work or others. As Adriene says fill your cup! You deserve it.",Saziye Tasdemir,2021-02-28T09:27:18Z,3

"This last practice of Bridge was a slow steady workout for this senior yogi. Suffering from lockdown inactivity, the downward dogs and vinyasa flows were more of a challenge than usual, so I modified a little, moving through knees to be mindful. Completing this sequence was fun and so good for my positivity and fitness. Feeling yoga satisfied Adriene 😊👌 I’ll see you tomorrow for MOVE 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💕",Gill Smith,2021-02-28T08:59:57Z,19

We did it Gill! 🙌🏻 <br /><br />I had to do modifications today bc my sciatic pain letting it’s presence be known. It’s funny how quickly I forget how the softness and gentle approach that is what keeps me going. The desire to compare creeps in if I’m not careful. <br /><br />💕,Laura Reed,2021-02-28T11:38:19Z,1

"First, thank you for this video and all that you&#39;ve posted, such a blessing.  I find myself very very blue of late.  Working on self care among other things.  I find that I&#39;m making a conscious choice to utilize your videos in a pick and choose manner just for now - videos that are supportive, slow, mindful.  I&#39;m approaching my practice in a kinder way - instead of feeling like I have to push, bend - work, I&#39;m experiencing the practices in a different manner - and it is truly helping.  I&#39;m sure that it, as always, helps physically, but it is truly nourishing me spiritually and emotionally. I&#39;m also experiencing my movements in a different way, and it feels like growth.  As you say...&quot;find what feels good&quot;. Thank you again.",mobilemidlifecatharsis run riot,2021-02-26T17:03:38Z,1

"That&#39;s just what I needed! but I realise that every practice I do with Adriene is just what I needed:) At the start of the year I wasn&#39;t sure I would be able to commit to a daily practice because of a busy family/work life but managed to find that time for me even if some nights it was nearly midnight when I got on my mat and it is sooo true that the hardest part sometimes is getting on the mat, but I did and my family survived!! ha ha, it&#39;s surprising what hubby CAN do when you disappear for what really is a short bit of ME time. My daughter made me a beautiful zen den do not disturb sign to put on the garage door( my gym/yoga studio) but I have learnt to not be bothered by interuptions as sometimes they (kids &amp; dog ) come and join in for a bit and then wander off, but my family have realised that this is good for me and them. Today is Day 55 and i&#39;m HOOKED!! LOVE YA ADRIENE :)",Helen Stone,2021-02-24T11:14:30Z,1

"Hello Adriene :D I&#39;ve been doing your practice daily for almost 2 years! I can now tell what my body needs, and usually I like to alternate between a more intense/ tone workout with a gentle workout or floor practice, but I do find it hard to gauge how intensive or gentle a workout will be. I was wondering if you&#39;d consider giving your videos an intensity reading from 1-10, like this practice would be a 5(?) maybe. I wanted mostly to do a gentle yoga today and I thought this one would be pretty gentle (it helped that it was only 20 min because I did the Yoga Kiss yesterday and it was 40!) but it was still more core work than I thought it would be, I was looking for a gentle, give the core a break kind of one, and that&#39;s when I thought of the ranking idea! At least if a video is a 7-10/10 then I would know that it is too intensive for my chill days ^_^  I hope that makes sense. Thanks again for all your videos, they&#39;re life changers",Bianca Rowena,2020-07-02T15:54:40Z,1

I have never been able to exercise daily in my life (I&#39;m 66) but since isolation Adriene has kept me company and inspired me to commit to treating myself with more love and respect. I started with complete beginner practices and still do those 40 minute ones interspersed with random practices that correspond to how I feel or want to feel. I haven&#39;t done anything too challenging and it&#39;s great there are so many lovely videos to work with that I am able to manage. I always come away feeling better than I did before I started and this is a great motivator. Every day I can feel that I&#39;ve used my whole body.

My life got turned upside down for a while, I was able to keep practicing prenatal yoga for a while but then a lot of things happened that pulled me away from my mat. I&#39;m four months postpartum now and yesterday and today have been the first times I&#39;ve practiced with you since finding out I was pregnant a year ago. It felt like coming home. I didn&#39;t realize how out of sorts I was and how much I needed to start caring for my mind and body until I put on one of your practices yesterday. It&#39;s only been two days and two practices but I&#39;m already feeling parts of myself come back that I forgot were even there.

Been struggling with my body image a lot this last week. Trying to shrink yourself really wears on you after a while. I didn&#39;t have much energy or motivation to practice yoga today but I pushed myself to do this video because it wasn&#39;t too long. The moment when I heard &quot;take up space&quot; while standing in star pose I started to cry...I&#39;ve been too hard on my body and on myself and this video is what I needed today.,Veronica Clemente,2020-02-04T23:14:58Z,0
"Ohh Boy! I believe I have messed up the calendar for February after HOME. I did day 2 Kiss on day 1 and Day 3 practice on day 2. So, now here I am doing day 1 practice on day 3...lol. Anyways, I am sure with my positive intentions, I have still filled my cup with the right energy. After a good 45 min jog, this 21 min practice was so good for my legs and arms as well.

"Just after finishing HOME I had to get some blood exams done, including the glucose one because I have insulin resistance problems and I felt so sick later, and got a headache that lasted 36 hours and 3gr of paracetamol 👌🏼 I was bummed that I lost 2 days, but now, doing this I realised I can... i kind of can have problems and come back to it. It is not that hard, not after a full month. Getting on the mat after 2 days being a walking dead wasn&#39;t terrible, it was nice and I was somehow not expecting it. Everytime before, when I tripped it was so hard to get back and I am just so thankful for the HOME practice, because I think it was the key to get me to love Yoga again. Also, I got the exams back and everything is alright. My numbers have never been lower and honestly, I thank that to you too",PolliitoAle,2020-02-04T01:32:25Z,0

"I&#39;ve been living with your yoga sessions for the past 3 years but a while ago, I quit because of my depression, I quit almost everything in my life. A friend of mine basically pushed me to do yoga with you again, made me make a promise to her, that I would do yoga today. I forgot how amazing it feels. I forgot how loving we can be to ourselves. I forgot the importance of breathing right to every corner of my body.  I&#39;m grateful that she made me pushed to do yoga, also I&#39;m eternally grateful to you, Adriene. Thanks to you, I feel good again (and it&#39;s been a while since I felt good). I&#39;ll keep on doing yoga until my depression is healed. And just please never stop doing this.

"1st February 2020. What can I say? After doing 30 day Yoga with Adriene. Home each day from 1st to 31st January 2020, my body got into this &quot;high &quot; coz I included the yoga practices to my strength workouts. I did them in the evening and I had a good night&#39;s sleep. Come February and especially today after working 5 days this week,  followed by a full day workshop on a Saturday when all my body is telling me relax after  the workshop. Am here thinking a yoga practice do me some good but which one? Surely Adriene you have spoilt me. Luckily before I go to YouTube I take a peek into Instagram and voilà I see a February calendar. Is it just me or is there anyone out there who feels like Adriene has cameras on her? 🤣🤣🤣. Just kidding. Anyway I didn&#39;t go on scrolling. Went directly into the practice and boy was it just what I needed? God bless you Adriene. I feel great now. Love from Germany. 😘",Jenky sikolia,2020-02-01T18:32:35Z,3

I have been doing Yoga since 1978... another senior yogi here... and now I practice with Adriene&#39;s videos everyday.

"That move really was powerful for me, too! Because Adriene speaks so clearly and proceeds at such a great pace for me (usually!), I can follow her with my eyes closed most of the time. When I &quot;released the bind&quot; on the second side, it felt like my energetic body was flying! Such a wonderful, free feeling! Filled MY cup! Watching much later than most who have posted. I only found Adriene on YouTube about a month ago. What a woman!",robininthegarden,2020-09-19T17:40:37Z,0

"So, Adriene:  My dear father died two days ago; I have a bad headcold; and logistically, there was no comfortable place to do yoga in the house for a couple of days ... And I chose this sequence, for the title.  Yes, my cup was pretty empty, but I got through it all pretty much and this sequence, now, has gotten me moving back toward harmony, that harmony and balance that allows me to expand and give to others.  (I&#39;ve been  a regular for over a year now, doing one or two of your sequences every day). You are indeed a GENEROUS SOUL.  Have a very merry Christmas.",Arpa de Lluna,2019-12-23T06:12:03Z,0

"I&#39;ve spent today and yesterday slowly working myself into a haze of stress over whether I&#39;m spending enough hours doing uni work each week, and spent the day neither relaxing nor working, just watching the hours slip away without feeling like I had achieved anything. Doing this practice I could feel that haze evaporate. <br />Of course working my way methodically through set tasks is more important than tracking hours spent on each subject. Of course I need to invest time in things like yoga and mindless video gaming and baking so that I can get more out of my working hours. Of course Adriene could help me see the light again. Of course.<br />Thank you Adriene :)",Rebecca Hurford,2019-11-12T22:30:39Z,0

So I honored my truth and Filled my Cup with you two today. Right as we began, my dog jumped off the couch and came to sit next to me (not her norm).  Then as we were doing spinal flexions, she pulled out every toy onto my mat and went CRAZY! She tossed them up and around and growled at them. She later joined Benji in some barking.

"Hi Adriene. I love your style of yoga so much I downloaded the app and went with the monthly payment plan. Unfortunately there has been some sort of a glitch and every time I’ve tried to play a video for the past six days it says I need to update my subscription but when I go to update my subscription it says it’s all good . . .

"Hi Adriene!<br /><br />I am a yoga lover who unfortunately, got taken away from my practice after suffering with chronic hamstring tendinitis. Four years later and I’m struggling to find videos that aren’t heavy in the warrior poses as any added pressure to the hamstrings, or over stretching them, causes tendon flare ups. If you could make a video catered to this injury, I would just die! Love your videos Adriene!",Calissa Treat,2019-10-19T18:24:18Z,0

"Thank you so much for your classes and lessons. I recommended you to a friend last night because yours is the first Yoga class (live or on YouTube) I have ever resonated with. Your style of teaching is so easy to understand and your energy just gives off a sense of non-judgment.<br /><br />2 months ago when I started, I could not even touch my toes. Now I can - not a huge achievement in the grand scheme of things, but for me its a huge step. Today, doing this practice, I was overwhelmed with this sense of gratitude, to you and myself - you for making these amazing and incredible classes, and myself for actually engaging with them - I even started to get a frog in my throat haha. <br /><br />So, Adriene,  again I say - THANK YOU. You are amazing. - and to answer your question, I did set an intention for my practice and now my week and month ahead. I got more out of my practice than even my intention offered... :) Namaste",Stephan Hoffman,2019-10-19T10:18:33Z,0

"Thank you for your Videos, i practice Yoga with them since a few years now and recommended them to other people. You do a great job guiding even beginners through the different poses. The only critic I can think of is that sometimes, if a pose includes repeating a movement on the other side (like first we stretch the right side, then the left) the second stretch or whatever is shorter than the first. But other than that, I really love your lessons :) Yoga does a lot for me and my body!

Do you perhaps have a video that&#39;s ill people-friendly?

"I just did 2 of Adriene&#39;s videos in a row because my psychiatrist &quot;prescribed&quot; me 40 minutes of sports 3x in a week (she said this is not a recommendation, I should take it as much as a prescription as to take my meds daily). It felt great and, additionally, I am so proud of myself for sticking with it! Sometimes it is hard to stay motivated, especially as a person who never saw themselves as sportive. But since I discovered Adriene 3 years ago my whole relationship to myself, my body and sports started to change. It is not yet a completely healthy relationship, but I am almost there, and it would have taken so much longer or not happened at all w/o Adriene. Thank you.",Rodothea Robbe,2019-09-30T13:38:44Z,5

"Dear Adriene,  thank you for sharing your expertise with us.  I blew out a knee on the treadmill and my daughter suggested I try your classes.  I&#39;m &quot;old,&quot; and tend to write more than most younger people; so let me write more like I&#39;m 20.  I used to HATE yoga the way some people dread trips to the dentist.  I completed the 30-day challenge and made gains in strength, flexibility, and muscle tone.  Best of all, I feel better after yoga than when I am on the treadmill, hiking, or even swimming.  I use your classes now like prescriptions.  Today you smiled at the camera during your class and I was so touched I cried.  I know you have love for your students and I can&#39;t tell you what that means to me right now.  Thank you for using your gifts to help us.",AnneMarie Gaffney,2019-09-14T01:53:10Z,1

"In general the practice went smooth and easy (the word &quot;easy&quot; has a good sense there). But in some moments I felt irritated and was ready to give up. I sometimes do feel that in poses like plank, &quot;downward-facing&quot; dog, &quot;three leggy dog&quot;, the poses that are more complex than &quot;mountain pose&quot; or &quot;table&quot;. I feel that this irritation comes from tension that I feel in these poses, from my tightness and stiffness. But what unpleasantly surprises me the most, sometimes I feel the same in easy stretches like side body stretch. Maybe its because my practices are not regular yet. I can do yoga every day for a week or two - and then just give up. And after starting again even simple movements can feel awkward and uncomfortable :( I must do yoga regularly, because giving it up constantly I just deprive ,yself the opportunity to consequently become more and more flexible, healthy, feeling good. But this is also a lesson, and thank you, Adriene, just for your existing and doing what you do for us. It&#39;s a big job.",Valery Kabs,2019-09-13T14:03:01Z,0

"I&#39;ve been following Adriene for yeeeears (on and off, admittedly... there were more than a few months-long breaks), and today I finally felt that breath/body connection in its fullness.  I feel uplifted, centered, and full of heart! I just wanted to take a moment to let you guys know that it really does happen with enough patience and showing up on the mat &lt;3 <br /><br /><br />Adriene, thank you SO MUCH for doing what you do.  Coming from someone who has struggled with depression and low self-esteem throughout my life, I feel so grateful to have found a teacher who emphasizes &quot;finding what feels good,&quot; whatever that may mean to me! Learning to become more present in my body has genuinely aided in my coping strategies and overall healing.

"Thank you Adriene. i can’t express how much your style has meant to me. you were exactly what i didn’t know i needed, at exactly the right time i needed it. ‘when the student is ready, the teacher will appear’, has never been truer. i still won’t practice around other people because after every session i whisper namaste back to you with a crackly voice and tears in my eyes, of joy or love or peace... i’m not really sure, but something powerful is happening. i watch on my fire stick, so don’t ever leave comments, but i’m glad to have you as my guide. <br />namaste my friend",troglodyte61,2019-09-10T15:23:18Z,0

Great instruction and makes it easy to pull up when I&#39;m outside and can&#39;t see the screen as easily. Please keep up the shape suggestions. My favorite was explaining how I need to dig in heels for diver&#39;s pose to round my spinal base. I guess I pop out my butt by default in chair pose or similar positions.

"hi, adriene! even though you may not have the time to read all of this, i just really wanted to say that your videos have helped me through so many tough times in my life. not only do i actually feel comfortable practicing guided yoga by you, but i do yoga daily now. i do it at least once a day and usually it&#39;s at nighttime because i struggle with severe anxiety. doing yoga in your bedtime, healing the mind, stress and anxiety playlists helps me destress and sleep better than i did previously. before i started doing yoga, i sometimes cried myself to sleep because all of the anxiety and thoughts rushing through my brain that kept me up at night for hours. i was just wishing that it would all go away. it got really bad to the point that whenever i got anxious or very upset my whole body started shaking and i couldnt get it to stop. my stomach felt like it did when i was about to throw up all day, every day, which kept me from eating because after i ate something i got really anxious and i just felt even worse.<br /><br /><br />my parents made me go to therapy, which helped for a little. but after a while, i was sick of it. i had a mental breakdown in the middle of our soon to be last session with my therapist, and my parents and my therapist decided that i could be done with therapy. i was pretty much doing okay after i quit therapy. last year my anxiety slowly started to come back and this year it was at the worst it&#39;s ever been at. recently my parents have been getting into huge arguments to the point where i can hear them yelling at eachother, banging on things and my mom bawling her eyes out when im downstairs in my room. my dad even left us a couple of times for a week, and right now he&#39;s not here with us at our house because he left us again. my mom admitted that he didn&#39;t love her as his wife anymore. even though she said he was going to go to counseling and they were going to go to couple counseling, this made my anxiety go at an all-time high and i barely ate anything at all the rest of that day. i was already doing your yoga before this all happened, but it felt like everything just came back again--crying myself to sleep, my body shaking, isolating myself from everyone, and even feeling like i was going to faint by pacing around in my room so much.<br /><br /><br />the week that all of this happened i decided to do more yoga guided by you. even with the support of my best friend, i still felt really depressed. your cheerful personality made me feel like i was actually loved and more content. i love your personality, humor, the little jokes thrown into your yoga lessons, and benji (even though im much more of a cat person myself!) doing yoga especially from the bedtime playlist at night helped and still does help me distract myself from the family issues, anxiety, depression, and the pains i am getting in my stomach. i also have turned to doing good things in my life, making art for myself and other people, taking walks, and listening to upbeat music for other distractions for what&#39;s happening right now. but practicing yoga with you and also venting to people has been my main distractions lately. currently i still feel very anxious and pretty depressed but i am slowly getting better mentally and physically. i am eating more, and even though i am still getting panic attacks multiple times a day, i have found ways to deal with it, especially when i&#39;m in school.<br /><br /><br />im currently going to counseling at school and i might go to therapy again. this and doing yoga with you has helped me feel a lot better. i just really hope you know that you have a huge impact on peoples&#39; lives, including mine. keep doing what you love and stay beautiful and kind. i really appreciate your videos because it may not seem like it but they have helped me tremendously with everything going on in my life. im sorry that this comment was so long and that you may not have the chance to read all of this, even though i hope you do. seriously though, nobody&#39;s videos have ever helped me as much as your videos have. i appreciate you, your personality, your yoga teaching, and your optimistic attitude so much that i really don&#39;t know what to say.<br /><br /><br />thank you so, so, so much. sorry that i got really emotional and personal while writing this. i hope you have a great rest of your day/night. &lt;3",steph,2019-09-10T01:25:31Z,0

"I have a suggestion. Not just for this video, but for all your yoga videos. I have been following your channel on youtube for the past year. My suggestion is that in your intro, before the yoga starts, mention any props you might be suggesting  in the workout. I realize all props are always voluntary to the individual, but if you plan to use blocks, or a blanket, or something else it would give us time to collect that before we start the &quot;love fest&quot; of yoga. Love you Adriene! You got me back on my mat feeling strong again. I tell EVERYONE about Yoga with Adriene.",ruth collins,2019-09-05T17:59:45Z,0

I&#39;m so proud of myself. I went into this practice with confidence because I&#39;ve been doing yoga practically every morning (only a few times did it get skipped) for over 5 months now.. I did some of those moves with much more ease than the first time trying them out. You have no idea how much you impact my life on a daily basis. Thank you and namaste.,Nadia Nanette,2019-09-04T16:28:07Z,0

I love your yoga channel so much ❤️ I am now 10 weeks pregnant and I’ve switched to prenatal yoga but I miss your videos. Any chance you know some pregnant women and want to do a few prenatal yoga sessions. Or are you videos still safe for pregnancy?,Kimberly Shepherd,2019-09-04T14:39:13Z,0
"Hi Kimberly! In general, most women are able to continue a regular practice through month eight if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. We also have a Prenatal Yoga For All Trimesters available in the FWFG Membership - <a href=""https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/prenatal-yoga"">https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/prenatal-yoga</a> and our shop - <a href=""https://do.yogawithadriene.com/prenatal-yoga"">https://do.yogawithadriene.com/prenatal-yoga</a> xx",Yoga With Adriene,2019-09-05T13:56:10Z,1

"I don&#39;t know if I started doing YWA videos last September or October, but either way, I&#39;ve been doing them for roughly year now. This is the longest I&#39;ve stuck with any at-home exercise routine. In the past, when I told myself I&#39;d workout at home, it was a guarantee I would do workouts for like a week and then lose interest. Maybe it&#39;s because it doesn&#39;t feel like exercise. It just feels like (sometimes sweaty) meditation.",Nikki Berry,2019-09-03T18:56:48Z,0

I did this one two days in a row because it was everything I need and nothing more. Not going to lie, it got my heart rate up and I had to take breaks from 3 legged dog. Maybe tomorrow I’ll venture out and try a different ywa video or maybe I’ll do this one again. I’ve been doing YWA since the first bedtime yoga vid came out and the newsletter is the only non work related email that I read (even in my post baby yoga hiatus).

"Adriene you&#39;re my saviour and hero. I was life-threatening ill in 2018, my adrenal glands had stopped working out of the blue, which meant that everything stressful could kill me. The tiniest virus to a anxiety attack or even a wedding or funeral... I began with yoga, first just yin, but after a month or two I found out your yoga videos, and you remembered me to smile, to love myself and life. The medication and illness caused anxiety and depression symptoms. I was tired of living and craving for death. But every time I stepped on the mat, you were there and you just... thought me self love again. You remembered me to smile, to stay breathing. You literally saved my life. I don&#39;t think I would be here a year later if it wasn&#39;t for you. I switched jobs, hell, I even went back to university to chase an old dream of mine. I am now sort of healed. I won&#39;t be the same old me like before all this, but I&#39;m still here to live life to the fullest. <br />A friend of mine once said that in our life we sometimes meet angels sent down to our path to guide us or help us. You are definitely an angel that remembered me to stay on this earth a little while longer. Not just once, but every time I step on the mat. <br /><br />Namasté 💟",nonnjie,2019-09-03T05:22:31Z,0

Namaste I am your follower from India .I love your way of doing yoga so comfortably..you are the best trainer ....I love you,Nidhi,2019-09-02T04:27:24Z,1
"Hi Adriene, First up I love you. That should encompass all my gratitude, my awe and my dedication to what you are helping us achieve and the energy you bring to our lives. :) Second is a general question that I&#39;ve recently begun to be made aware of and now I&#39;m confused. When we breathe in do we breathe into the stomach or the chest cavity. I have somehow always breathed into the chest cavity because of keeping the udiyaana bundh and attempting the mool bundh. So now suddenly I&#39;m finding it difficult and unnatural to breathe into my stomach. But if that is what we are meant to do I will rework the brain&#39;s habits and fix it. I just wanted to know from you. Thank you and huggs",Shahana Goswami,2019-09-02T04:27:10Z,0

"Adriene, <br /><br />You are changing the world. You&#39;ve created a movement that is life-changing- not only for others, but for yourself. As you work tirelessly to help others fill their cups, I hope you are making sure your own cup is filled. To check in with yourself, to prioritise your needs; to enjoy moments of stillness. I am very proud to be a part of this community and I appreciate you so much. As I see the work you&#39;ve done to heal the hearts of others, I just want to check in that your own heart is healthy. You can&#39;t do this without YOU! You&#39;re always reminding us to breathe, so let me ask: are you creating the space in your life to connect with your breath? <br /><br />I love you, Adriene. You&#39;re a powerhouse; an energy machine. I just want to make sure you have time to fully recharge. When we are not serving ourselves, it becomes an unnecessary struggle to be of service to others. But you know this. ♡",Verta,2019-09-02T03:01:41Z,0

So I haven&#39;t done yoga in 5 days! My body and mind have been exhausted. Thank you for reminding me to fill my cup. This month I am going to focus on myself and not just my jobs and the people around me, but checking in with myself to ensure that I am giving from a full, overflowing cup! I love you, Adriene.",Natalie McLaughlin,2019-09-01T17:23:24Z,0

"Hi Adriene. Thanks for this session today. It was very nice. I have been thinking as August drew towards a close that I had begun feeling exhausted. I have recently finished a different daily schedule for 3 weeks which threw me off so much and my body wasn’t used to it but it was for work and I pushed through. As I have been feeling exhausted for some reason it brings me back to when I was a teenager when I was exhausted all the time (underlining conditions lol). In the past few years I have realized how much I adore Autumn. My birthday is right at the turn of the season in September so I kept thinking that I feel a “rebirth” is coming on. I hope that I can get back on the YWA bandwagon and do what I can to keep consistent. Everyone have a blessed day, month and season.",Leah Kelley,2019-09-01T13:50:13Z,0

THANK YOU from the very depths of my being for your incredible generousness.

"It has been around 5 months now that I&#39;m following YWA and doing my bit every day..for the first couple of weeks I had to take myself to the mat and had a hard time finding my postures..by now l can&#39;t give the practice a miss anymore..my body and mind asks for it naturally.. however, for some reason I have a hard time trying to keep my eyes open during the practice..it takes conscious effort on my part to keep my eyes open in fact..any idea why?",indrani mukherjee,2019-09-01T05:52:30Z,0

I to also love your videos I lost a good amount of weight and gained a good amount of muscle just by doing beginners yoga YOUR Yoga. Imagine this a 564 lb man doing your beginners yoga exactly the way you&#39;re doing it for months on end then finding out he&#39;s down. 448 lbs I need to get back to it and keep Dropping,Jay Smith,2019-09-01T05:27:21Z,167

As I lay in my bed<br />Taking my final breath<br />I grab hold one last time<br />The fight to inhale begins to subside<br />A rush of fright enters my mind<br />I begin to run in all directions<br />Puffing and panting has no effect<br />The weight on my chest was my last breath<br />I fall into the earth all heavy and dim<br />My only thought is will I meet grimm<br />No air to breath <br />Nothing goes in and nothing comes out<br />What is this experience all about<br />I begin to feel light and float to the sky<br />I feel the seasons come and go by<br />Like one giant system it all flows together<br />Just like a breath did in this olden fella<br />Seasons go by one at a time<br />How can I feel these if I have died<br />Suddenly I realized It is earths breath<br />The weight on my chest was instantly released <br />Once I became apart of this incredible beast<br />Earth is my name come play my game,Cosmic Conundrum,2019-09-01T05:25:12Z,13

Hey Adriene👋🏼 I recently started to do yoga with your videos and I&#39;m in love with them. They always manage to make me feel relaxed and safe. I was wandering if you can do a yoga session for weight gain (if that&#39;s a thing)? Thank you so much 😊😊,Fatma Sena AYDEMİR,2019-09-01T05:15:43Z,0
I truly want to do this but I know MS is crazy so will have to cut off for standing poses and for sure one leg things but I know the start like others will be awesome for me. Thank you for all you do,Kellye Cooper,2019-09-01T05:15:09Z,0
"Hey. Just wanted to say I&#39;m really glad I stumbled upon you a few years ago. You&#39;ve changed my life for the better and I will be forever grateful. Thank you. <br /><br />Also I hope you realize that there&#39;s not a second that goes by where people aren&#39;t doing yoga with you. Literally every second of every day you are changing lives.  Stay awesome. <br /><br />Signed,<br />-A random 29 year old man on the Internet.",Chip Whitley,2019-09-01T05:14:32Z,661
"Thank you Adriene. So many of your lessons seem to fit exactly what I am struggling with a given day. Your comment at the end is so true and something that was hard for me to accept and understand; that our own pain and inbalance and anxiety that we carry colors our experience, our life and anyone we come in contact with in profound ways. We can be a light or sadly, the opposite. I know I have been both. I am working for myself and others to be in balance. Couldn&#39;t do it without you!

"Yoohoo!! Saw this on the September calendar on Instagram last night. A perfect complement to an active Sunday. Time to fill our cup with some fresh morning water/coffee (and our lungs with a fresh breath, of course), and be reminded to be kind to ourselves and get ready for the next week while unwinding from the challenges of this past one. Can&#39;t believe we&#39;re almost through with the year 2019. Y&#39;all rock everyone, you got this. Thank you, Adriene for once again brightening my day and encouraging me to get better every day.
