"A little discouraged because I&#39;ve been practicing yoga regularly for a year and every day in 2021, but I had to take a huge break in the middle because my heart was racing",Erika Skorstad,2021-03-09T23:22:05Z,0

"I started yoga for about 3 years ago. You where a huge inspiration for me in the beginning. I did not pay for a yoga teacher or anything. Just your YouTube videos and my own mat in my home. Ive done it almost every single day untill about 3-4 months ago, when i got back from a school in denmark. Now, i try to get back in it and i use your awesome videos for inspiration like in the beginning and i have to say Thank you so much for being you and your warm energy. It helps me to belive in my practice, and i feel so safe and guided in a way no one else can. Thank you❤️ love from norway.",mari-elise Klokseth,2021-03-18T12:44:47Z,0

I took a week off from yoga because I wasn’t feeling so good. Self esteem issues started rising again and I physically didn’t feel like I could be active. I challenged myself today to try this and get to the end even if I didn’t do the best job. I had to take several breaks throughout but made it to the end despite wanting to quit halfway through. Hopefully my self esteem can start to get back on track,Ssilnah,2021-03-12T07:09:09Z,1

"This was such a fun practice! I loved the creative arms. When I started yoga with you, I would mainly pick out practices that were more restorative and focused on healing, since I&#39;ve been in the process of trauma healing. But after doing Home and Breath and getting into daily practice, I realize that all yoga is healing. And, it&#39;s an important part of healing trauma to embrace joy and remember the magic inside of us! Thank you for lifting my spirit today, Adriene. As you do every day! 💜",Kat Abrams,2021-03-06T23:03:09Z,0

"This week has been tough so yesterday I decided to do the 50 minute self-love yoga class. I’m continuing MOVE today with this one, I’ve had a project in mind for a couple friends for a while. I’m sure it’ll take my mind off of this heavy and negative week, MOVING (wink) into a relaxing weekend. I’m just a couple months into my yoga journey, but I’m already feeling the difference within my mind and body. I feel so supported by my mat and this community. Even though none of us know each other and may never meet, knowing that everyday, someone is practicing with me has helped me shake the illusion of separation and isolation. We’re physically apart, but practicing together. Much love to you all ✨💞🌱🧘‍♀️🌹",Sea Air Ah,2021-03-06T18:14:37Z,0

"Sorry everyone, this comment is a bit of a long one, but wanted to share!<br />So today was a tough one! One of the things I have always stuggled with is to let myself be imperfect when exercising. I&#39;ve never been very fit and when I try a new exercise I always berate myself for not being able to it perfectly, and I either oush myself too hard or give up. Now, I&#39;ve been doing YWA regularly for 8 months now, and I&#39;ve got better at queting that voice. However, last week it got the best of me and I definitly pushed myself too far and injured my back. <br /><br />Although I had noticed I was hurting, I didn&#39;t LISTEN to my body and kept puching through MOVE regardless. This practice, although beautiful, proved too much and I threw in the towel halfway and began to feel really guilty about doing so! But I know that is NOT the way to feel, and that what my body was telling me is that I need rest, and that this community will be ready and waiting when my body is ready. <br /><br />SO while I do that, and some lovely meditation in the meanwhile, best of luck to everyone else following with MOVE, and I&#39;ll see you all soon xxx",Naomi Dixon,2021-03-06T17:55:26Z,29
I have the same voice in my head too. I did a 3k run today and I am struggling to decide if my body can handle 40mins.<br />Thanks for sharing your experience,Lanti Usman,2021-03-06T20:35:57Z,3
"I’m so glad that you listened to your body and trusted what felt good and stopped before hurting yourself more! I’m the same always hard on myself for no reason, and then frustrated with myself for being too harsh! I hope you have a lovely day and continue to practice self love on your journey because trust me you deserve it💕",Zainab Ahmed,2021-03-06T18:41:38Z,4

"Move Day 6: Today&#39;s practice was long in comparison to the others, and getting onto the mat was challenging, but I did it and enjoyed the whole practice, except for pigeon, which has always been difficult for me.  I hope to find pigeon again in the near future, because the only way I will improve my pigeon is with more practice! I believe that sometimes the poses we like the least are the ones we need to do the most, for that&#39;s the only way to improve.",Joanne Katzman,2021-03-06T13:54:10Z,103

One of my favorite fitness instructors tells us often that &quot;the body hears what the mind says&quot;, which I remind myself frequently.  I love your description of being curious...what a great way to move through that wondering and enter into the challenge.  Let&#39;s be curious again tomorrow, ok?

"I normally go for a walk, but due to the weather I skipped it (cold and wet). Pretty emotionally instable lately. Cried twice during this practice. It helped processing all the events this week and I have a calmer mind now after this practice. I have followed quite some practices from you Adrienne, and I absolutely love that I, more and more, can close my eyes and just follow you on your voice. Helps a lot with the poses and giving even more peace of mind.",Gerdine van Schothorst,2020-12-11T16:08:19Z,0

"Did this today instead of Yoga for When You&#39;re In A Bad Mood for NOV2020&#39;s Ground practice. Wasn&#39;t in a bad mood and wanted to be a little more inspired and dang it Adriene! I love when you kick my butt gf! Haha but seriously I did get a little emotional - I am just so grateful for you. I feel like you really saved me over these past few months, I was headed to a really dark place and yoga has been the only thing that has shown me a different perspective of how to think. Yes, there are times when I start to sink back into that but I am certainly more mindful of myself when I do now, and I always come back to the mat for support to give me a new view. I know I have a long journey ahead of me and there&#39;s still so much more healing to take place, but I feel this practice changing me and I am getting better because of it. Namaste. &lt;3",imsam96,2020-11-11T17:33:52Z,0

Hi Adrienne - I smile every time I watch this video and Benji. Thank you for the smile. I’m a psychologist and coach. I have been inspired by your videos .

I know you may not get to millions of comments you get and I have a dream like Benji to one day collaborate with you :-).  My cats seem to like to come to me while I do yoga and  guided imagery  .

"Hello Adriene!  I love your videos and I follow your yoga workouts and meditations almost everyday &lt;3  However, I am scared that this will become more difficult to do so because YouTube is planning to remove Community Captions which is what you use to include closed captioning in your videos.  I am deaf and I rely on these captioning.  When YouTube removes Community Caption (September), it means that you will have to either take the time to make the Closed Captions or you would have to pay a third party to do it.  In my opinion, this is bollocks because no one should have to pay for accessibility!  It is my passion to make sure that this does not happen and I am hoping you would join in our fight!  I have pasted the link to the petition to prevent from this occurring and leaving millions of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing viewers around the world in the dark of what is being said.  <br /><a href=""https://www.change.org/p/google-inc-don-t-remove-community-captions-from-youtube?use_react=false"">https://www.change.org/p/google-inc-don-t-remove-community-captions-from-youtube?use_react=false</a><br />Namaste",Michaela Mullin,2020-08-06T14:36:02Z,0

Hello All!<br /><br />This is my 8th month straight for doing daily yoga with Adriene! I am in love with her 30 day journey&#39;s as well as her monthly calendars! Today&#39;s August 2020 day 1 practice really let me settle in and relax.  I will need this towards the end of the month as I go back to teaching my 6th graders.,Kristin Reed,2020-08-01T21:18:56Z,1
"Loved this practice! After having struggled to &#39;keep up&#39; with daily yoga since the beginning of the year,  I&#39;m back on track this month. Feels like a great overlap with the theme of the month, inquire. So much to learn and discover, thanks Adriene! &lt;3",Ceren Güneş,2020-08-01T21:12:05Z,0
"I will admit, I fell off the Daily Yoga bandwagon. I was constantly finding excuses to stay off of my mat. But I decided, with the beginning of a new month it was the perfect time to do some goal setting, some journalling, and take time on my mat again. I will admit, this was a tough one for me. At times when I wanted to stay in Downward Dog I would come to rest in Child&#39;s pose for a moment before getting back into it. I know in this moment it may feel like I have lost progress, but I know by showing up daily for myself on my mat with the YWA community the progress will continue to push forward. I feel stronger, more free, and more open after finishing today&#39;s practice. Thank you Adriene!",Faith Hudvagner,2020-08-01T21:04:29Z,0

I took July off to focus on just gentle stretching and nothing too energetic and I’m back for August and already trembling with prana! I love this practice but I remember the first time I tried it I couldn’t even get through it because of my mindset. Today it was like a balm to sooth my soul. So fun and interesting to observe these changes in my body and mind.

Phew. I found this pretty tough tho great start to August when Lammas is celebrated by some as when we harvest. I guess with our yoga practices we reap as we sow. Found pigeon too tough today so flipped onto my back for upside down pigeon which suited my body better today. As a result I feel I harvested greater feelings of contentment with what I achieved. Loved the fancy boat poses. Almost dashed to get a feather boa - if I had one! Namaste all and thanks again Adriene.

I have enjoyed and embraced so many of your practices on your channel. This one was a beautiful yet challenging. I love these types of practices! Your channel has helped me cope with my recent break up and now it&#39;s meant more than that as in I&#39;ve found what my body has been calling for for so long. I&#39;m also currently doing one of your 30 days yoga courses from your website. Yoga responds to my body and mind so well I wish I understood it more before.

"Today is the first day I do a full yoga video! One year ago I got diagnosed with PCOS and the immediate response from my doctor was to prescribe some birth control which one helped to mask the symptoms for a few months but then I started getting anxiety and headaches. Now I quit the birth control and I&#39;m trying to treat my disorder with a more holistic approach. I&#39;ve been doing HITT sessions during this past 3 quarantine months and I have enjoyed them but I learned that some of these excercises can actually stress my hormonal imbalance, so now I&#39;ve decided to alternate some new low impact HITT routines with yoga and after how I feel after this first yoga class I really believe this would be good for me :)",paloma Pardo,2020-07-14T18:59:18Z,0

"Hello Yoga Community, I&#39;m practicing for around half a year now almost daily and improved quite a lot in flexibility strength even gaining weight. which was kinda impossible my whole life. But I have a question, theres this one pose at example <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twDBxdmjCA8&amp;t=17m30s"">17:30</a> where u kinda just push ur hips back, but somehow it feels like just my bone crush into my hip and everything blocks. If I go into the pose from the other way I have the normal feeling of a stretch in hips and hamstrings. So is there a trick to it, which I couldn&#39;t figure out myself? <br /><br />But overall thanks Adriane and keep up ur work :3",Cold Popsicle,2020-06-26T16:07:32Z,0

"People seem to love Adrienne and she really seems to be sweet and healthy, but let me break something to you - This drama isn&#39;t supposed to be called yoga. Real yoga needs not be decorated with the &#39;reach for the sky&#39; types of nonsense. And I wonder how much of whatever nonsense she does is just made up and could actually end up harming your body. This is just another level of appropriation. It&#39;s difficult for people who were born and brought up in the culture of (actual) yoga to endure this. <br />Westerners willing to learn real yoga, should just visit India or at least watch Indian Yoga practitioners, not this brutal appropriation.<br />Take a look at her, for example- <a href=""https://youtu.be/_op1erw2bn0"">https://youtu.be/_op1erw2bn0</a><br />It is clear, crisp and minus the nonsense. It is what yoga is supposed to be.",Dishari Roy,2020-06-26T04:07:34Z,0

"Dear Adriene, <br /><br /><br />I&#39;m not sure you&#39;re going to read this, you must have a lot to do and countless comments coming in every day. But on the off chance that you will, I wanted to thank you. (This is going to be a bit long). <br /><br /><br />Last year was kind of rough. In fact, my entire life has been kind of rough, but last year was particularly bad. I drank and smoked heavily, did not exercise and kind of neglected my diet most days. I was not in a good place emotionally and it showed physically. I turned over a new leaf in January; quit drinking and smoking, started taking care of myself again and remembered my trusted old friend Yoga With Adriene (I have been with you in the past before everything went a bit nuts). I have been doing your exercises almost daily since then and I&#39;m not going to lie: it was hard. I had lost a lot of my flexibility, my breathing was messed up, but most importantly: I couldn&#39;t just <i>be</i> anymore. I am a naturally anxious and perfectionistic person to an unhealthy degree. I am very hard on myself and because of this, much of yoga in the past and back in January was just &#39;getting that pose down perfectly, you know, like in the picture!&#39;. I&#39;d practise in front of the mirror, force my body into the poses just so they looked good but neglected the feeling. When you tell us &#39;find what feels good&#39; I told myself this was what I was doing, but it wasn&#39;t. I was too preoccupied with getting everything just right and in so doing, actually forgot a lot of important things along the way. I couldn&#39;t keep my core engaged because I was so focussed on touching my chest to my leg in forward fold, my breathing was ragged and uncontrolled, I couldn&#39;t lift from my body but dumped weight into my wrists because the soles of my feet just <i>had</i> to touch the ground in down dog. As always, I was thinking too much, being too critical of myself and forgot why I wanted to do yoga again in the first place. It&#39;s an easy thing for me to fall into. <br /><br /><br />The past week has been very rough for me emotionally and I haven&#39;t been back on the mat until today. This flow was beautiful. It was energising and touched on the exact basic yoga poses and flowing through them the way I needed today and I noticed that I could finally be present. Listen to my body, find what feels good and be aware of everything going on in my body. I stopped focussing on getting everything &#39;like in the picture&#39; and as a result, actually focussed on the movement and flow. I rose high lunge without shaking, strong and balanced like I&#39;m supposed to because for the first time, I focussed on the present, on everything in my body and finally, my mind could tune out all the outside stuff that makes me so crazy all the time. <br /><br /><br />You did this for me, Adriene. You give me these little moments of peace and quiet amidst chaos (both on the outside and inside) and I thank you dearly for it. Namaste.",Kat S,2020-05-16T15:10:07Z,0
I’m very new to yoga and I found this practice challenging today as I couldn’t hold any poses for very long (the hardest being chair pose” are there any poses anyone could recommend I do when I can’t hold a more difficult one for very long?

"This was the first practice I did that I genuinely experienced the feeling of wanting to throw in the towel several times. I&#39;m the type of person who would quit sports when I wasn&#39;t good at them upon starting them as a child. I like the journey, but only if it&#39;s easy. This has shown up in my life in many ways, and it&#39;s one of the biggest challenges I face as a poet. When I don&#39;t like what I&#39;m writing, I give up for MONTHS. It hinders my creative process, as I quit before I can even start when I don&#39;t feel inspired. I paused the video to go do something else, as I was frustrated feeling like I couldn&#39;t do it, then ultimately came back. I stopped during a couple of the transitions, as the poses were challenging for me and I began to feel discouraged. Then it all clicked for me all at once. You have to push through and let yourself flow regardless of internal judgement, it&#39;s the only way! Thank you so much Adriene! I think you&#39;re awesome. Appreciate you and your vulnerability!",baylee olds,2020-05-13T13:41:46Z,131

"Thanks for this!! What you describe sounds just like me. I have slammed my wrists on the floor before out of frustration because i couldn&#39;t hold a particular pose (think it was side plank). And whilst I myself am not a writer, I have been trying to write more because I find it calms my mind in a way nothing else can, and I really miss the creative outlet in writing/drawing/using my imagination I had as a kid/teen. I often feel so frustrated and embarrassed by the fact that stuff doesn&#39;t usually just flow out of me when I write, that I end up putting off trying for a really long time. I really want to get better at pushing through that! And I think yoga is a place to practice doing that. Reading your comment was a relief to me! It&#39;s nice to know I&#39;m not the only one who has this internal battle raging around writing!",Miranda Jarrett,2020-08-01T10:18:44Z,2

"Hi Adriene, you know I have been a Personal Trainer for 18 years and no one over this time could get me interested enough to do there yoga class except you. It has been an on going joke between myself and my friends who are yoga instructors about me attending there classes.<br />I lift heavy things and train so many clients to a stronger more functional movement pattern and love and believe in themselves. But myself I could never slow down enough to do a yoga class.. until i started doing your classes on YouTube.<br />Thank you so much, your yoga classes help keep me moving relatively pain free and  is so grounding emotional and spiritually for me, it helped me slowww down. Thank you!<br />I refer my Personal Training clients to do your classes also, i love the feeling of team and you are part of our team.

"Hi! I enjoy doing yoga a couple of times a week and I want to start incorporating more advanced moves like handstands and arm balances but something I’ve struggled with is that I only have carpeted floor in my house and I feel like I can’t get the stability I need from it ( i feel as if my hands shift with the carpet fibres even under the yoga mat and I then find it difficult to ground down through my knuckles/fingertips) which sometimes causes wrist pain. Have you ever experienced this or heard about anyone who has? What can I do if I don’t have any even, solid ground to do my practise on? <br />Thanks so much!<br />Gabby ❤️",Gabby Morley,2020-04-07T14:58:54Z,0

Can anyone give me a recommendation of a YouTube channel with a host similar to yoga with Adrienne?

"Thank you Adriene for the series &quot;home&quot;. In corona&#39;s days, it has been so usefull. <br />Today I found a poem by Walt Whitman, from Leaves of Grass, that expresses how I feel in this days practicing yoga with Adriene, I would like to shere it with all you. <br /><br />It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,<br />I will go to the bank by the wood, and become<br />undisguised and naked,<br />I am mad for it to be in contact with me.<br /><br />The smoke of my own breath,<br />Echoes, ripples, buzzed whispers, love-root, silk-<br />thread, crotch, vine,<br />My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my<br />heart, the passing of blood and air through<br />my lungs,<br />The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of<br />the shore and dark-colored sea-rocks, and of<br />hay in the barn,<br />The sound of the belched words of my voice,<br />words loosed to the eddies of the wind,<br />A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching<br />around of arms,<br />The play of shine and shade on the trees as the<br />supple boughs wag,<br />The delight alone, or in the rush of the streets, or<br />along the fields and hill-sides,<br />The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song<br />of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.<br /><br />Have you reckoned a thousand acres much?<br />have you reckoned the earth much?<br />Have you practiced so long to learn to read?<br />Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of<br />poems?",Lara Mendonça de Almeida,2020-04-04T16:01:23Z,0

"My dearest Adriene, I just wanted to thank you so much for your amazing videos. A few months ago I introduced my 7 year old daughter who is high functioning Aspergers to your videos. You have made such an impact on her and no amount of gratitude could measure up to that. She has gone from being completely disconnected from her external world to having a much deeper understanding of the neurotypical. Although her journey is far from over, she has learnt how to better quiet her mind during a meltdown and how to be more in tune with her emotions. Which in turn helps her to be more aware of when she’s become triggered and has helped us to avoid so many meltdowns. And your bedtime yoga has been the greatest gift of all. (The one where you suggest “bringing oils into the mix” and massaging your feet 😊) We’ve gone from taking 2 or 3 hours to get her to sleep to maybe 20 minutes! We’ve tried other YouTube videos before but you are the only one who can hold her complete attention. She still dances to the beat of her own drum, something that we will always encourage. But now it’s driven from a place of calmness and magic, instead of anxiety and frustration. My household is now much more harmonious and it’s all thanks to you! Thank you so much and namaste beautiful soul 🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️",The stuntman’s Wife,2020-04-02T00:01:07Z,1
Thank you Adriene. I found one of your delightful videos this morning and I love it - especially Benji chasing something in his sleep. The inner creative class was exactly what I needed as I&#39;m housebound due to the virus. It was perfect in every way and your instruction is great and the setting is so right.

"Hi Adriene, would you consider making a video about your daily routine? I did try doing yoga sort of first thing in the morning, I almost fainted because my body was just not ready for being upside down and back again. I am also not sure when to drink, etc. Moreover, I was told several times that upside down poses (when your hips are higher than your heart) are not recommended when on period, do you agree with that? So long story short, could you collect your views about what to do and when? I know that listening to our bodies helps figure that out, however I would be curious to know the fundamental guidelines (e.g. don&#39;t eat before practicing). I appreciate your channel a lot. All the best!!!",nóra juhász,2020-04-01T10:20:21Z,0

"I don&#39;t know if you will see this, but I have scar tissue in my wrist, throughout the joint area. A lot of the poses that involve grounding through the hands are difficult to hold and it feels difficult to transfer the energy to the fingers to assist with grounding, but only in the hand with the scar tissue. Just wondering if you had any pointers. I have tried the video for hand/wrists, but I am wondering if I should just try that daily or if another move might help prior to beginning my sessions.

I ended up being inspired to write a little poem about child&#39;s pose after this practice-- hope you enjoy :):<br />Child’s Pose<br /><br />My legs fold at the knees,<br />thighs on top of calves<br />My body folds at the hips,<br />chest on top of legs<br />head resting in the space between my knees<br />arms holding my entire self on each side<br /><br />It’s amazing how our body folds up into itself<br />how small we actually are<br />how little space we need<br />When we hold our whole world within ourselves;<br />a safe haven we can always recoil inward<br /><br />I feel my heart beat against my thighs<br />In this moment,<br />time pauses:<br />I am one,<br />I am whole<br /><br /><br />Also, if anyone wants to check out my blog for some more poetry: <a href=""https://explorationsofconscience.wordpress.com/"">https://explorationsofconscience.wordpress.com/</a>",Anna Power,2020-03-30T23:50:45Z,20

Thank you Adrienne.  I started my daily yoga practice with you 3 and a 1/2 years ago so deep gratitude. Good to come back (tho have still dipped in from time to time with you) I particularly liked that there was less chat and more silent spaces but your pace is perfect for me :).  One thing when you were offering asanas and you were facing into your body e.g what I believe was child&#39;s pose (tho couldn&#39;t see as I couldn&#39;t hear you so remained in dog for a very long time and came out to find you were moving into table top!) yes your voice was much less audible.  No doubt OK for younger ones with good hearing but thought I need to mention this to bring it to your attention.  Everything else beautiful.

"I&#39;m 33 years old and HATED Yoga from ever since I can remember. It felt boring, incredibly slow, and unsatisfactory. Αbout 20 days ago I ran into &quot;you&quot;. Now I will do one of your videos every single day, no exceptions, even if it&#39;s a 5-min one. I have ADHD, so I can&#39;t thank you enough for being so easy-going and kind, thus helping me to effortlessly form what seems to be a wonderful (hopefully long-lasting) habit by now. I fell in love with your attitude and, through it, I fell in love with yoga. Keep on shining &lt;3",Evie Evie,2020-03-26T18:41:47Z,62
"I&#39;ve done this practice every day for the past week.  The first time I completed it, I loved how my entire body felt challenged.  This past week I&#39;ve learned one&#39;s practice truly depends on how you are feeling in that moment.  On my third day of completing it,  I struggled with my balance and focus, and I felt as if I did better the first day I was introduced to it, which is ironic considering my body knew what to expect.  Although it is the same sequence everyday, each practice is truly unique.  Thank you for this, Adriene (and Benji)! Love what you do &lt;3",Anna Garbus,2020-03-26T17:52:04Z,2

"What I’ve realized is that yoga can be for everyone of any age. I’ve just started your guide, at 14 minutes already, I was about to do the children’s yoga channel that I heard my age group is doing during the outbreak. But I prefer doing yoga with adults for some reason. I think it makes me calmer and gives me a better feeling of who I am doing the activity with - next to me or not. I’m about to subscribe after I finish writing this comment because Adriene has really helped me so far! I will be doing this every day and I’ll hopefully get to try out different types of yoga if that is a thing.",roarrawrrory,2020-03-25T10:01:13Z,2

"Yes, just pay attention to your knees - maybe using a blanket if there is discomfort. x",Yoga With Adriene,2020-03-20T15:28:16Z,1
"This one was hard for me. I haven&#39;t practiced in over 2 months. I do often fall in and out of doing yoga quite dramatically, I have a lot of negative emotions around that as what I really want (but don&#39;t do) is to have a daily practice and be progressing - that may be physically or mentally. I&#39;ll admit it does bother me that I am all or nothing with this, and have been for 10 years. About 2 years ago I was dead set on doing my yoga teacher training, but in my mind I wasn&#39;t quite &quot;there&quot; yet with my physical and mental practice. Since then I have again gone through the on-again-off-again roller coaster. Last year I spent the first five months of the year practicing nearly daily. I was proud of myself, I am still. That was started off with the 30-days of Yoga journey, something that tends to revitalise me. This year I did maybe half of the 30 days of yoga month and dropped off after that. I was annoyed at myself, I still am.<br /><br />Today I found this practice really hard. I tried my best to notice any negative thoughts that were coming through and dismiss them although I know some of these thoughts are &quot;true&quot; for lack of a better word. I found myself out of breath immediately, I was shaking, I felt generally really weak (I could barley lift my arms, couldn&#39;t hold a downward dog), I had to take breaks. I know that all of this is part of the practice and I have no reason to feel bad about this - I&#39;m sure if anyone does read this they can relate to being your own worst critic. If I was reading this comment from someone else&#39;s perspective I would be sending loving vibes and words of encouragement. Ultimately I know in my heart this is fine, more than fine. I am proud of myself for getting up and onto the mat in the first place - I have been at home for 3 days in isolation so I have done nothing more than sit on the couch and browse social media. I feel today will be different. <br /><br />It is frustrating to lose (although I know it is not lost) the strength I built last year and to not be able to motivate myself. I find myself torn between the voice in my head that is saying I am &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;if only I had kept up with my practice I could have been somewhere different by now&quot; and the other voice that is loving and caring and accepts me no matter what the circumstance. What I said at the beginning of this comment is true... I do want to have a daily practice. I want to motivate myself regardless of situation. I want to progress - what ever that means. I want to look back on myself in a year and know I made good choices that have benefitted me. This is is longest comment I have EVER left on youtube and I have been on here about about 12 years. <br /><br />To anyone reading - I am looking for change. A change to my practice that is permanent. I have learned so much from yoga and it has helped me in so many ways, I struggle to understand why I continue this flip-flop attitude towards it. I want it to be different.",Letitia Mc Conalogue,2020-03-20T12:20:31Z,4
"@I.K. I do strive for this and &quot;know&quot; it in many ways. I am very much less goal-oriented now than I have been in the past and I feel present when I am on my mat. I think the lack of consistency is what is getting to me (important or not) because I know how much better it makes me feel. Thank you for your comment, it is much appreciated. &lt;3",Letitia Mc Conalogue,2020-03-22T12:26:53Z,0
"Maybe you&#39;re too focused on the future and the past? On the idea of progressing? Maybe what would be more beneficial is just to focus on the now. Don&#39;t think about how this will make you stronger or &#39;better&#39; in the future, be it physically or mentally. Because once you get to whatever goal you set yourself, you&#39;ll again be striving for a new goal, and you will again be trying to live for the future. Think about how getting on your mat makes you feel right now, not about what it will bring you in the future. Stay present",I.K.,2020-03-22T10:54:39Z,0

"It&#39;s been a couple of months since I enjoy practicing yoga for my well-being. But today was different. I&#39;m an exchanged student stucked in Poland, trying not to get worried of the spread of the coronavirus. Being away from my family and not knowing how long I will be away from them is particularly hard. Yoga is one of the few activities I decided to keep on task in my daily routine to distract myself from what is happening in Europe. Being compelled to stay at home favours creativity: to keep myself busy, I will try to do painting, writings and so on. <br /><br />Take care of yourselves and others, guys. The spread of the coronavirus goes beyond our individual lives. Listen carefully to the instrusctions given by your local/national government, and do not undersestimate the seriousness of the situation.",Orianne,2020-03-14T10:01:58Z,15

"Hi Adriene,<br /><br />I haven’t tried this practice yet, but I am excited to. <br /><br />However, I am writing to make a request for a practice to help with getting back to sleep. I am sitting here in the middle of the night unable to get back to sleep because my mind is running away. I tried to walk myself through a mindfulness exercise, attempting to focus on my breath and relaxing each part of my body starting from my toes. I got side tracked so frequently that I didn’t even make it to my knees after 15 mins.<br /><br />It got me thinking that a yoga or meditation that I could do when I have problems falling back asleep would be super helpful. Just a thought in case you are looking for inspiration for a future video. <br /><br />Thanks for listening! And a huge thank you for all of the beautiful practices you create for us.

Hello. I haven’t watched this one yet but I just finished the Home 30 day yoga journey and I wanted to say thank you so much for sharing these videos with us. I’m sure you get that a lot but I love what you do and I appreciate it so much because it’s sort of kick started me into getting more serious about working on my physical and mental health. My cousin Ashley told me about you and I’m so grateful she did. There’s still so much I am working on but even after the first few weeks I could tell a difference in the way my body feels. I always wanted to get into yoga and because you use this platform and make it so easy for us I’m able to do that. I’m starting Dedicate tomorrow. So thank you!,Erica Lorain,2020-03-11T16:28:37Z,0

"this was actually pretty difficult. i noticed that I am still trying to get the shapes &quot;just right&quot; and that i don&#39;t really know what to do with myself. like when i&#39;m awaitin the next instruction or move i&#39;m like okay it&#39;s quiet and it&#39;s just me here so do i talk like what do i do. I also noticed that i got really serious and it was just interesting to observe. definitely a nice practice. but i&#39;m proud that i showed up cuz after a few days off at it being 5am when i started, anyway, mad love your way adriene. peace from Big MOB <a href=""http://www.spinrilla.com/FMOBious"">www.spinrilla.com/FMOBious</a>  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BRKNLMTS"">#BRKNLMTS</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23StoneRockINC"">#StoneRockINC</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ABLgang"">#ABLgang</a>",BRKNLMTSvision,2020-03-10T09:50:05Z,0

Does anyone have any tips?<br /><br /> My calves + knees are much longer than my arms + shoulders so when I do a lunge pose it is REALLY uncomfortable and awkward because my calves are too long and press into my chest.. Am I just stuck with my anatomy when it comes to this? I just don&#39;t see how creating space and lengthing will remedy this. :/,Megan Elektra,2020-03-10T00:41:23Z,0

"Hi Adriene, I have a question about breathing because it is stressing me out during the practices: I feel like my breath is shorter than your sometimes so when you say &quot;inhale&quot;, I inhale and then I automatically stop breathing and wait for you to tell me what to do on the exhale. This is a little annoying because I keep judging myself that I &quot;breathe the wrong way&quot; or something because I sometimes need to inhale when you say exhale and vice versa. I don&#39;t really know what to do about that because I can&#39;t just do the practice faster because I don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming and I can&#39;t do it slower because then you&#39;re way ahead and that actually really bothers me because a part of me is constantly busy trying to &quot;breathe correctly&quot;. Have you experienced this? How do you inhale for so long? Is there anything I can do? <br />And thank you so much for your practices, I think you are the best yoga teacher on the internet &lt;3",janamusic,2020-03-04T18:44:45Z,0

"My sweet kitty usually has a lot of interest in yoga...... or at least the mat. Usually once I actually start, she gets annoyed at the lack of attention and leaves. Something magic about this one, it had some pet energy. She stuck around, walking in between my legs and stroking my face with her tail during my forward folds, standing under me looking offended (maybe because we’re imitating dogs?) during downward facing dog. And then you said to give a little pet to any critter we happen to have, and I think she was really glad you said that. 😂😂",Faith H,2020-03-03T11:21:40Z,0

Hi Adriene! I’ve been following your channel for a little over 2 years now and I think what you do is so wonderful!!! I’ve been able to cultivate a really good (almost) daily practice because of the resource that you offer! I recently got a foot surgery so I haven’t been able to really do a good yoga practice and i can FEEL it. Could you make/ recommend some videos for poses that are off the feet but still balancing? I’m finding my butt is really uncomfortable from sitting so much and I”m worried about getting super lopesided in my legs/ thighs since I cant put any weight on my right foot. <br />Thank you for all you do!!!,Eliza Bryan,2020-03-02T22:47:40Z,0

"Hello, everyone. 😊 I wanted to share my story cuz maybe it will mean something to other people. I have been doing sports my entire life, was always in a great shape and never had any injuries. 2 years ago I started practicing yoga (ashtanga vinyasa) and I got addicted. This addiction turned out to be bad for me just like any other addiction is bad. But I couldn&#39;t realize how bad it was because in my mind I was doing something good like cmon it&#39;s yoga, I imagined that this type of movement is different from all others as if guided by some invisible divine hand and nothing bad can ever come of it. I was in a really good shape and at first I couldn&#39;t feel any pain. I was practising 6 days a week for 2 hours or more. My teachers have been telling me &quot;Breathe through the pain&quot; &quot;It is normal to feel that, you are changing your body&quot; &quot;That tension means that you are releasing something buried deep within&quot; and so on. I never questioned it. How dare I question yoga, or maybe better said yoga teachers? I never questioned my coaches when I was a kid, or at the University, they must know... Fast forward, I now have injury in my hip, SI joint and knee. I am hypermobile. I was so happy to be able to do some crazy shit aside from other numerous mental and spiritual benefits . I was feeling the best in my entire life... until I wasn&#39;t. <br />My friend said &quot;You are practicing yoga, you are not in a circus.&quot;<br />In &quot;Hatha yoga pradipika&quot; it is said that yoga is poison for those who are not handling it properly. In the west, people approach yoga in a, lets say, questionable manner. We must question this questionable manner. <br />Once again, Adriene is the truest yogi I have met in a sense that her philosophy alignes with love and nurturing as opposed to perfection and violence towards yourself. <br />If you do your reserch on the internet you will be shocked with the amount of injury that comes from not using yoga as it was meant. I must now learn from the pain and that is where true yoga begins. Peace 🙏",Maria Milo,2020-03-02T11:16:44Z,0

Of course for the 2nd day, I did all the required &#39;slow, warming up&#39; yoga movements (that I learned from Adriene&#39;s Home challenge) before jumping into the more intense yoga part at the 2nd half of the video. Hopefully, one day my body can grow to endure longer yoga sessions😅 On the other hand, I love the flow of this video :)",IreviewUread,2020-03-02T09:21:23Z,0

I love the analogy of looking into your reflection and when this is part of the practice I always envision staring at my best self and visualizing what she feels like. And then at the end of the practice when we bow and share the namaste I envision bowing and flowing into my reflection and becoming that best self. I just think it is a beautiful image that feels like a small rebirth &lt;3 So excited for CREATE :),julie. moravek,2020-03-01T21:28:06Z,2

Hi Adriene! Hi everybody! 👋🏻<br />Adriene thank you for this video today. When I woke up this morning and read your email I teared up. A few months ago I had commented saying that my husband and I had lost our fur baby Zeus as he had passed away. We took it hard and the grief was so weighing but thankfully I had tools and a support group.  (YWA being one of them!) <br />Yesterday we adopted a new fur baby! It has <br />and will be an adjustment. She is such a sweet girl and full of love. She is so curious about my morning yoga and meditation routine and wow haha she gets right under me. <br />Thank you again for today’s routine. 🌈❤️,Leah Kelley,2020-03-01T20:54:05Z,0

Great practice. My dad ruined it for me less than ten minutes in by screaming to turn the sound down (even tho hes downstairs blasting his flat screen TV and I watch u on my cheap non smartphone not even loud...) <br />Regardless I finished the practice but couldnt concentrate on myself cause I was too afraid to make too much noise and get yelled at. <br />You really triggered me when you jumped/hopped cause I can&#39;t do that if my dad is home which he always is basically. <br />Yeah I&#39;m 28 and am completely controlled by him it&#39;s sad.<br />I&#39;m hoping your yoga practices get me back into the strip club so I can get away from this toxic house hold.

I am new to this channel. My favorite takeaway so far &gt; is when I meet “my edge” I am offered to make the movement or pose “my version”. This guidance is an opportunity to shift my inner voice from “I can’t do this or I need to do better” to I am empowering myself to explore what I actually can do and I am good where I am at.
