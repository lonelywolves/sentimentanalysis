The repetition of daily yoga practice and the repetition of your Dedicate vocabulary provides you the opportunity to check in with what is going on right now.<br />Not yesterday. Not two years ago. Not later this year. Now.<br />Have courage to be with what is.,Yoga With Adriene,2019-01-12T14:12:32Z,541
"@Stephanie Lee Agreed. For me, this works and shows greater results than traditional practices I have taken part in for a long time. I actually do not feel like I will hurt myself here. We have proper guidance. Everyone can do what works for them, If not does not work for you, or you do not agree with it, that is okay. But when commenting, it would be helpful for others to say exactly what modifications should be made.",William B,2019-08-16T05:01:17Z,0

"Adriene Thank you for helping us with your gift of Yoga. With your Teaching we are building Courage, balance, and strength as we progress through Dedicate 30 Days of yoga with Adriene on day 11 we can see and feel a change from when we started slowly but surely our bodys are opening and freeing up from the tightness we were locked up in we wish would have found yoga with Adriene years ago.<br />Thank you<br /> Adriene you Rock !!!",Brian Wagner,2019-03-09T01:00:55Z,0
"​@Farwa R I am also not Adriene (lol) but I think there are LOTS of benefits to doing yoga when you a pregnant. I would say to keep the parts that feel comfortable, and modify the parts that require too much crunching or pressure or balance. If you do a different move than Adriene in some parts you are still DOING it! It&#39;s not &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;incorrect&quot; to choose your own moves. What counts is that you are showing up and breathing and being calm and relaxed, and sharing your energy with everyone also doing the practice.",mixedveggies528,2019-01-31T15:32:45Z,0

"So my yoga journey started back in nov 2020, I’d been telling ppl for years that I thought I would love yoga but never did anything about it until I found Adriene’s short 10 minutes video for absolute beginners. Did that 5 days in a row then did a few random videos the next few days until I found HOME. Did that AMAZING journey in about 45 to 50 days. I was totally ok with not doing consecutive days. Then!! BREATH!!! That was awesome! And I was able to do all 30 days conservatively. Then I rolled right into DEDICATE ❤️ so 41 consecutive days today. All of this to say today really felt like I’ve made so much progress and everything seemed doable and I had a new sense of confidence. <br /><br />Adriene, you are the best teacher and I’m so fortunate to have found your channel! I can’t wait to see where this journey will take me 100, 200, 365 and more days down the road. <br /><br />❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",DenisChenard,2021-02-12T02:16:04Z,2

"My left leg during that balance was shaking, trembling, wobbling so much like a Loony Tunes jelly - but I did not fall! I had the courage to keep going, and even though I was 99% absolutely going to fall, I kept pulling back to my centre and I did - not - fall. There is absolutely nothing shameful about falling, but this practice, and that moment, for me right now, is excruciatingly relevant. I&#39;m trying to catch a wave into the veterinary industry at the moment, and the constant pushback has proven so difficult, and sometimes it takes me to a dark place. Thank you for teaching me today that I can always find the courage to keep going, and that against all odds, I might not even fall &lt;3 Namaste xXx<br /><br />22&#39;Oct&#39;20 - just a quick update to say that one month on from when I did this practice, I&#39;m now on my first week officially working as an animal carer at an established veterinary practice! Against all odds, I did it. I did it! I&#39;ve since moved onto the HOME yoga and I&#39;m relishing in practising alongside you while growing my veterinary journey (I&#39;m on lucky day 13 &quot;GROW&quot; btw ;] ). Thank you again, Adri-ji, for being my ongoing support! (Adriene-Benji :D) Namaste! xXx",Jasmin,2020-09-22T17:19:38Z,3

It brought me right back to the mat, but this time with gentle, kind, forgiving energy. Thank you!!! This community is awesome!!",Svenja V,2020-07-31T23:13:44Z,2

"To anyone else who broke the chain, and is feeling guilty - After completing Day 10, I suffered an ankle injury while playing badminton, and was not able to do any yoga for 4 days. I was scared of coming back to the mat, and aggravating the injury, and tbh was a little scared after seeing the crow pose in the thumbnail also :p<br /><br />I realized though that this session is all about courage, and today I ended up on the mat, wanting to be courageous. I&#39;m so glad I did! Feels absolutely wonderful. <br /><br />I was even able to hold the crow pose for a couple of seconds (whereas could barely rock onto it when I did Home)! Yay for my wrists getting stronger! Certainly helping my badminton game also 😁<br /><br />Thank you so much for existing Adriene. Namaste 🙏🏻",Shobhit Bansal,2020-06-08T16:57:55Z,5
"Doing Dedicate so far has been really profound both mentally and physically. First I did HOME and I didn&#39;t want to stop daily practices so I chose to continue with Dedicate. For some reason exercise is almost like a straight line in my head, you know from start to finish but no I have had it wrong(I think this stems from my competitive sports background). I thought that since I&#39;ve been doing this for awhile this is a breeze(hahahahahaha how wrong was I, now I have learned and started to appreciate my shaking muscles,like Adriene has said &#39;how it feels to be alive today&#39;)<br />Today I realized that this journey through mind and body is a spiral and each day even though I think I&#39;m strong the practice makes me humble, brings me back to the present and always always finding something new. <br />This practice, yoga is such a huge blessing in my life I am afraid to even find the words but each day through each practice I have more courage.<br />Namaste🙏❤️",A.

Today was so hard. My balance is horrible. I don&#39;t know if I should keep doing this session to try to get better. I feel really discouraged for the first time. I really enjoy the sessions. I just lost some faith in myself to continue because I imagine its only going to get harder. I done know if its my large thighs or my insulin pump or what the issue is. I would really love some advise. I have only been at this about 6 weeks and up til today I have been enjoying it. But now Im not sure what to do?,jurkh2,2019-10-27T20:00:34Z,1

It took months for me to finally get started with Day 1, then I fell behind a couple days, but haven&#39;t missed one in over a week.

"I have always been so terrified of crow pose. A few years ago when I first started to gain interest in practicing yoga, I tried to do crow pose (way too soon for my body) and totally biffed it and bumped my forehead on the mat pretty hard. Ever since then I&#39;ve felt a good amount of anxiety at the thought of trying it again. As soon as I saw the thumbnail for Day 11&#39;s video, I felt that fear. But I did it anyway, and I found balance in my bakasana pose for a few seconds today. I never thought I could do it, yet here I am! Thank you for reminding me to have courage. I AM STRONG!!!",Lynora Tolman,2019-08-07T17:52:36Z,1
"Todays been a long one. For the first time the entire series, I didn’t start the exercise first thing in the morning , but rather 2am after playing video games and realizing that I hadn’t done my daily yoga. I had some rather big changes occur today as far as social life, and  Ive just felt drained and overwhelmed . This specific exercise helped me with my courage and showed me that even though I wasn’t feeling my best, I still did what needed to be done to be the best version of myself. Thank you for that.

I love how you do even intimidating poses with grace make it so easy to follow with your soothing voice and motivating words. You also don’t wear those fancy outfits that those other people wear in their videos, I love your yoga outfits.<br />I also love how you use Sanskrit and I can speak Sanskrit a little bit and understand it completely because I learned it in India before I immigrated to the United States. You really help me understand yoga in its benefits. Thanks you for making yoga part of my life. I cannot thank you enough.",Chitra Salazar,2019-07-09T04:30:51Z,0

I have a big problem with balance, always have (even in ballet as a teenager - which didn&#39;t last long), and couldn&#39;t hold the poses as I felt I should have been capable.

I fell over so many times but then i think about how hard i found it to go from plank to downward dog etc and how easy it is now. It&#39;s very easy to feel like i&#39;m not good enough when i fall over but Adrienne telling me everyone is catching me if i fall is so comforting! We have to allow ourselves to fall in order to get stronger and keep trying.

Hey Adriene! I‘m Tuning 20 today and just wanted  to thank you for this awesome video and for what you‘re doing. I‘ve grown and learned so many things by doing yoga with you. To live with courage...to have courage! Thank you so much! ❤️,Pineapplelover07,2019-04-09T08:40:40Z,0

"Today I almost did the crow pose for the first time! For a moment I was like, hey, wow, am I really doing it? I&#39;m really doing it! (After that I almost fell down to the floor, hahah! But then I just started laughing :) ) It&#39;s so awesome that in that difficult pose I had to remind myself that I&#39;m strong enough, that I can do it, or I can try to do it and not be afraid of falling down, because if I do, I will always have my own back and laugh at my little fails with myself, like with a friend. This is something that is so important in real life and I love that you are teaching us how to treat ourselves with love and understanding, not only on the mat, but in life. Things get tough sometimes and it is really important how we speak to ourselves in the good days and in the bad days. Because courage is so much more than just being brave :)",Sara Kayacomesin,2019-04-07T18:23:49Z,0

"Man, this one... I got so angry! And then tearful. As I sat with myself afterwards and read through so many beautiful, open comments about how this one had many struggling, I went deeper. I know what this connected me to and why I felt the way I did. That&#39;s kind of rare for me with Yoga. Usually, if I have emotional releases, I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re about. It&#39;s empowering to come face to face with unresolved subconscious issues, to be able to say, &quot;I accept this, and I release this.&quot; I started with the 30 days of Yoga and moved to Dedicate when I finished it. Early on I realized this was way more than exercise. There have been a few days I&#39;ve wanted to quit because of mental anguish brought up in various poses. It&#39;s your gentle encouragement, Adriene, and the honesty and love of everyone taking this journey that have helped me keep showing up. I&#39;ve carried these things long enough.",K.

"My mum and I are loving the daily practice. Adriene, your way of explaining what to imagine is so wonderful and really helps to visualise so that the body and muscles get the maximum through the asanas while keeping this lovely connection to the breath. Thank you so much. Keep going strong!<br /><br />Fun fact for those interested in languages and imagery (as I am) <br />In Sanskrit or Hindi (which I speak) Bak = crane. Kak = crow. In the practicing of the asanas the poses are similar. And I really love the flow Adriene created to get us to the point of courage to try it. 😘👏🏼👏🏼<br />So some of us may have managed to straighten arms in the last pose rather like the long legged Crane = Bakasana. And some of us may have managed to balance using crooked arms looking more like the shorter legs of the Crow = Kakasana. Either way more power to you!<br /><br />Just thought it would be fun share the tidbit since I love how yoga takes deep inspiration from nature and its imagery.",Dana Roy,2019-02-19T06:41:31Z,3

The time that I gave myself daily to do your sessions kept me physically healthy and my head clear. My husband used to love watching me do it and encouraged me as he also saw the benefits. He passed away almost 6 months ago but every time I do my yoga it not only keeps me going but also gives me fond memories of him. A man I loved and adored for almost 30 years.

Okay. First off Adriene thank you for this practice. It gave me courage to do something I didn&#39;t think I could do. I have tried doing the crow before but I couldn&#39;t do it so today decided to trust you and tried once again. I was really surprised and happy that I could hold it for 25 seconds. It usually takes a while to get to convince myself to exercise but I&#39;ve been looking forward to these relaxing times with you while pushing my limits and loving my body. It helped me not just physically but mentally as well and I feel so relaxed and free that I would like to continue with this for a long time. Thanks one again. Stay awesome.,Red Hat,2019-02-10T12:53:33Z,0

"My balance was terrible today (as it is most days :)). One legged poses especially with the knee in front is just about impossible. One of the more frustrating days I’ve had as I spent most of the time concerned with my balance or getting caught up. The last pose was impossible. I would like to practice this more but feel the safer option would be to work on other poses first.<br /><br />Anyone have any balance suggestions? (My pinky toes have always been pretty bent/curled towards my ring toes, even when I stand.. so that may be part of the problem)<br /><br />Anyway congrats to the folk who had the courage to get through 11 consistent days! Let’s do it!<br /><br />P.s. did I miss Benji today?",Jeff Crook,2019-02-09T21:32:01Z,1
That last pose where you balance the knees on the elbows is always so hard for me! I feel so unstable and start to shake even when I&#39;ve got both feet on the ground still. Does anybody have any tips for how to achieve this pose? Obviously practice is key but I would be grateful for any other tips. Thank you for another great day!

"After having such a monumental moment last practice when I had no wrist pain it was fun and challenging to play with the theme courage on a new day in which I was low-energy, low-strength.  I caught myself in the beginning thinking “man, I lost it! Why can’t I do what I did last time for my wrists?” Once we got to the balancing postures it dawned me that it’s a new day and I’m just going to feel different. So even though it was FREAKING HARD and my ankle and calf felt like they were going to burst, I stayed courageous, didn’t give up, and made the modifications I needed to be successful. Hell yeah.",Laura Parker,2019-02-07T02:26:25Z,0

"Hello to everyone who, like me, has joined this journey late! I wanted to give a reminder for those of us doing yoga in larger bodies-- days like today might feel discouraging, and you might feel like you&#39;re &quot;giving up&quot; on a pose before you&#39;re supposed to. But yoga is, at the end of the day, a series of beautifully connected bodyweight exercises, and those of us who are heavier aren&#39;t weak or &quot;wimping out&quot;-- we are, in gym parlance, doing fewer reps with more resistance! Keep doing your beautiful work, my friends, and remember that yoga is for every body.",Eliza R.,2019-01-31T20:52:53Z,28

"I&#39;d like to share a little story about my yoga journey. :)<br /><br />A few hours after yesterday&#39;s practice, I made a small movement while sitting at my computer. Suddenly, my neck was struck with a terrible pain. I could barely move my head and had the worst night&#39;s sleep, and it was no better in the morning. I have quite a bit of anxiety, but I managed to get myself to the physiotherapist the next morning in a bit of a panic.<br /><br />That panic soon subsided. It was a GREAT visit (and not just because of the massage! XD). He showed me some neck stretches and strengthening exercises and said, echoing Adriene, that self-care and mindful movement is so important in dealing with injury and pain. He was also SO happy to hear that I&#39;d been doing yoga every day for the past 10 days. <br /><br />It really hit me then that I had learned to view pain as something fearful, indicative of danger, and to freeze up when it occurs. But some pain is just an alarm bell with no underlying harm, or harm that will heal with proper care and patience. A huge part of dealing with pain involves movement and being soft, kind, and yep -- having courage!<br /><br />So instead of giving up on yoga entirely, I did one of Adriene&#39;s softer neck and shoulder practices that day, just to be safe. But today I decided to continue the 30 day journey. I really had to have courage this time -- not only to do these awesome yoga poses, but also to take initiative and change it up when the poses were not appropriate for me (the physio said to avoid putting too much weight on either side), and to be very aware and kind to my neck. I have been pushing too much on some of these exercises, and I am now much more aware of that.<br /><br />I saw my physio again too, and the last thing he wrote on the take-home exercise notes was &quot;Keep up the yoga! :)&quot; <br /><br />So thank you, Adriene. This truly is a journey, and like you said in this video, it takes real effort go inside and to deal with all the stuff we have built up inside our hearts and minds (and of course it takes effort to move our mindful butts now and again too). Much love to you and to everyone else practicing out there! &lt;3",LA S,2019-01-26T05:16:43Z,0

Seems like I am agin seeing in front of me a year full of big changes.

I have really tight ankles, so squatting down feet turned outward, I can only squat a little bit.

"Adriene, you brought tears to my face again. So often I am so hard on myself, not really finding myself to be a courageous person at all. More like a fish out of water, flopping about, trying to find their place of belonging. This dedicate journey is teaching me to be my own friend, like the one I am to others. I have never felt so strong in warrior three, or been able to hold it for that matter. It&#39;s been a year or so since I have done crow and look forward to learning again with this solid foundation. In other interesting developments, I had a successful mediation session this morning for what very well may be the first time ever! My mind is occupied with many hamsters running on wheels and I have always struggled with focusing on the breath. Today felt easier, dare I say natural? I kept thinking of day one and feeling my lungs expand and then hugging into my core. <br />You are a natural born teacher and have a way with people. So full of gratitude for this space and this journey and everything you continue to show me. <br />Thanks for sharing this with me, fellow yogis. Thank you, Adriene.",Danielle,2019-01-17T15:34:26Z,4

"I’m a few days behind (but I have more to be proud of that I fell behind but picked back up) so I’ve been watching the thumbnail on this one, nervous that I’d have to do that pose. But I still showed up to the video and worked through everything, not concentrating on that pose, knowing I’d get to it when it happened. This was a tough practice for me because I’m a toe-walker, so I haven’t yet built stability in my core of the muscles of my legs that work when I’m flat footed. I stumbled, but still went through it. I got to that pose and well, I tried. I didn’t get much lift off the ground before I fell. But I’m still happy I tried. I look forward to coming back to this video as I progress and gain more and more strength. Because I know that it’s ok not to get it on my first try, even if I’ve been able to do everything else so far, and it’s going to be so rewarding when I finally can. <br />Thank you for this journey!",Keith S,2019-01-15T21:20:56Z,0

I found confidence in the struggle because I feel myself evolving.  Much love to all of you on this path with me ossssss❤️🙏🏾,Darren Knox,2019-01-15T06:56:51Z,0

"This practice made me realize that it takes courage to also do the things you love. For me when I even take ten minutes to sit down and write, that takes courage and I shouldn&#39;t be hard on myself that I only did a little bit, I should be proud of myself. Thank you Adriene this practice was wonderful and you&#39;re wonderful. Namaste!",Brianne Marie,2019-01-15T02:34:12Z,0
"Running A bit behind, just finished day 11, whoa! I attempted Crow! Yay me!!! Never in a million years would I have thought I&#39;d ever try that pose. The explanation had me there, I felt weightless, amazing practice. Much gratitude as I become stronger and recover from injury with the practice.",E Mazey,2019-01-15T02:26:31Z,0
"Holy moly<br />Now , the crow pose is something that I’m still not able to do... it looks so challenging, but I will do it any day soon!<br />I noticed that my arms are a bit floppy compared to my legs. They have definitely gained lots of strength!!<br />Thank you for another amazing practice, Adriene ❤️",D3STINY G,2019-01-15T02:24:00Z,1

"The ending of this session was really emotional for me. Somehow, your videos always seem to find me at the right time.<br />Yesterday, I was planning to catch up on the two days from last week when I couldn&#39;t practice. But something happened ; an old pain woke up in my body, around my left shoulder blade and I could barely move or leave the bed. I tried to do this video, but it just hurt so much, I had to stop after three minutes. I really wanted to cry, because I was craving for some yoga, and I simply... Couldn&#39;t. I felt so frustrated with myself, even though I had done nothing wrong.<br />So I decided to be patient. I rested. Didn&#39;t move for the whole afternoon and evening. Had a bad case of anxiety when I looked at myself in the mirror and saw my neck all crooked (I really was the bent neck lady from the Hounting of House Hill !). But still. I waited. I was tired from all the pain, but sleep had trouble to find me.<br />I&#39;m so used to my body working almost perfectly that this kind of episode releases a lot of judgemental thoughts and fears. Yesterday... Was hard.<br />But today was another day, so I decided to turn up on the mat. To try again. To meet my edge peacefully if it was too much for me. My neck and shoulder blade didn&#39;t hurt as much, but I wanted to be cautious.<br />Today, I held my first crow pose.<br />And I was so excited, I almost sunk my teeth to the floor when I attempted it for a second time.<br />The next instant, I was laughing like a mad man.<br />Then I listened to you, Adriene. I truly listened to you. And I&#39;ve had trouble holding my tears, since then. But these are good tears. They&#39;re okay. I&#39;m okay.<br />You&#39;re teaching me so much, Adriene. About myself. About self love. I can&#39;t thank you enough for everything you&#39;re doing for this community.<br />To everyone who had the courage to read until now : thank you. Remember yesterday is nothing like today and today is nothing like tomorrow. I want to believe we&#39;ll all end up being okay 💙<br />Namaste 🙏",Rianne Cabanier,2019-01-14T21:20:32Z,0

I got super nervous and self conscious because I’m still unable to do crow pose, despite starting yoga three years ago. However, I’m super grateful to discover that when I did this day’s practice there wasn’t actually any pressure to do crow prose—all the pressure was in my head 😅 Thank you for reminding me, and all of us, that any amount of courage to show up to the mat and try is still worthwhile ♥️",Erika Storli,2019-01-14T04:52:13Z,1

But it was so much more than that, of course. The plank felt really... nice. And the one legged crow suggestion/easing us into it was really nice. not sure how well it will fly the next time but maybe it&#39;ll get out of the nest, check things out a bit heehee<br /><br />thank you adriene. i feel stronger than I did day 1, no doubt about it.",MilesVsSeth,2019-01-13T19:13:56Z,0

But here I am on your channel 50 days later, doing your videos together with the namaste stuff daily and cannot believe myself - i am not the spiritual type AT ALL (or  at least I thought so :-) ). It speaks volumes about the quality of the content here. I want to thank you for all your energy, thoughtfullness and intelligence you put into all these videos to bring yoga closer to people. I am very sure it takes a lot from you, and i am also sure I cannot give it back through a computer screen, so I just wanted to wish to you that as much as you have courage doing this, you&#39;ll also have the courage to recognize if and when it becomes toxic for you to keep this up.

"I&#39;ve been a bit behind but after doing day 10 just now I looked at my &#39;up next&#39; and saw the word courage and the picture of the crow pose (I had no idea what that pose was, of course, but I really wanted to try it) and I decided that if that wasn&#39;t a sign to try to catch up a bit today I don&#39;t know what is :)",Aysha Majeed,2019-01-13T08:16:27Z,0

It&#39;s truly incredible just how much better I felt when I sat down on my mat and only just pressed play for the video. I did the whole practice too.

But, oh friends, how glad I am that I stuck with it and had the courage to show up today. The courage needed for me is for looking inward, at the way my spacesuit is inflexible or hurting or &quot;stuck&quot;. It takes courage to look with curiosity and to accept it without judgment. And I imagine that the most flexible and experienced of yogis experience this and still must show up with courage. All of you give me the courage to show up every day.

Well I showed up...and fell...and fell...and fell.  I don&#39;t feel like I accomplished anything today.  All those words of encouragement couldn&#39;t help me get my balance to even grab my knee much less do the crow pose. I couldn&#39;t look in the pond without balance.  I had been feeling really good but tonight I&#39;m defeated when I can&#39;t even balance on one leg.  Did anyone else have trouble or am I the only klutz?,Lorna Geraldine Leche,2019-01-12T23:40:06Z,2
"I feel like continuing to get back up and try when you keep falling takes much more courage than simply being able to balance the entire time! My feet cramp when I am trying to balance on one leg, so it&#39;s difficult for me too. When I fall, I try my best to smile or laugh and then try again... and again! I know this comment is a week late, I&#39;m joining the party later on. I hope you&#39;re still continuing to be as courageous as you were on day 11 &lt;3",Kelda Lundmark,2019-01-22T04:41:44Z,0

"@Lorna Geraldine Leche Oh, Geraldine.   You won&#39;t be left behind.  Each day is different.  Not every day will have this much one-leg balancing.  But the key, I think, is to choose for yourself what you will do on any particular day.  If it&#39;s breathing with one toe on the ground, then do that.  Perhaps that will be your balance for a month of more and, then, one day you can lift higher or for a little longer. . . . Sending love and a hug!",Deb,2019-01-13T02:12:55Z,0
Bless you!  I felt so down but you have encouraged me to continue.  I just don&#39;t want to be left behind it I can&#39;t learn to balance.,Lorna Geraldine Leche,2019-01-13T01:21:12Z,0

"I liked this one. I am so bad at standing on one foot. All my progress and increased strength and flexibility always feels meaningless when im wobbling.  I kind of wobble a lot, sometimes I fall.  I think I gained some awareness in this practice about putting more of my weight in the front of the foot as opposed to so much on the heel.  Ending with the crow pose was cool.  I learned it (and headstands) from another of your videos and have been practicing! Thanks Adriene and everybody.",Marck Miller,2019-01-12T19:23:46Z,0

Oh my! That was amazing! Now I get it. I thought yoga was just stretching. But this was a big adrenaline rush. I have had a right total hip replacement and I&#39;m still afraid of it after 6 years.  The rush from standing and posing on it blew my mind. Then the courage came to balance in the froggy thing at the end and I managed it ( a bit 🙂). Take courage and your fear will go. Courage comes from trust. Thank you Adrienne for trusting in us ❤️,Paul Robinson,2019-01-12T18:58:42Z,38

"Its been since November that I started to do yoga with Adrienne every day. What I learn from Adrienne are three major things.  1. how much a difference mindful exercise can make. Before I was doing x number of push ups etc and all it was is just mindless repetition I felt the pain the next day and I was exhausted not energized after a workout 2. Considering your own head as a &quot;beautiful extension of your spine&quot; this made me realize how posture is important and thinking to my head this way made me self conscious about the way I hold my head in general. 3. Be kind to your body and find what feels good. Its okay not to be able to follow the practice 100% you can make adjustments in the way if something is difficult for you. As long as you show up and try your best every day is all that matters. Thank you, Adrienne!",Dominika Legrand,2019-01-12T18:45:24Z,176
"She has helped me to become more mindful when I attend hot vinyasa classes and when I am doing calisthenics at home, as well as how I can slow down in my life in general and take time for the quality things to be held and nurtured 🙏💕",chris gestalis,2020-01-26T12:18:12Z,0

I commented earlier and felt a bit frustrated with myself. Then I read a lot of everyone’s comments here and discussed with my friends who are also doing the challenge about where we each are. I went shopping today and found a magnet with this quote. It is definitely a humble reminder. “Courage doesn&#39;t always roar.

With day 10, I found the strength that had been building and I was surprised by the confidence it brought me.  You then brought me an emotional release when you told us, &quot;If you do not care for yourself, you cannot care for others.&quot;  That was the intention behind my starting this whole practice (and it is working)!  I am further encouraged to know that you and others, worldwide, are finding this intention and and sending that positive energy inwards and outwards into the world through this practice.

"I remember one of my first practices with Adriene, about 3 years ago.  We practiced &quot;the mother of all poses&quot; she called it.  My balance was so terrible and I remember her saying, &quot;if it takes 1 month or 1 year or 10 years, who cares&quot; as long as you keep practicing and challenging and meeting your appropriate edge.   Im just getting better at it now.  Oh my what a daily practice has done,  Im so glad to be dedicated to this journey  (get it... &quot;dedicate&quot;d)  :)",Della Schmalz,2019-01-12T16:10:22Z,0

"Today was challenging for me in a way I didn&#39;t expect, but what I took away was that nurturing ourselves and recognizing our growth is a practice. I realized I&#39;ve been demanding machine-like performance of myself: to be successful down a checklist, to be emotionally secure, and the truth is growth happens from going through these hard places where we struggle and AREN&#39;T perfect.

"Good morning. So today I was very very wobbly. Part of me wishes to do the routine again (probably to prove something?) but I must trust the process. I do feel tired from the balancing, leg work and breathing. With the opportunity to do crow pose and when  I saw the picture of you Adriene doing it I thought, “Ohhh that pose.” Kind of dreading it. Lol. Then I thought to myself, “Today is the day I will do it!” I tried and tried and tried again. Crow pose was a no go. I usually get bruises on the inner parts of my upper arms trying crow pose.

"I love that people are mentioning where they are from. I am from Eastern US. I have the luxury of doing my yoga practice with Adriene at mid morning. Balancing postures are the hardest thing for me. I was getting pretty good at it and even was getting Crow posture down about a year and a half ago. But life got in the way with inner ear and vertigo.i couldn’t even walk across the room without losing balance. It took me a long time to make yoga a part of my daily routine again, but finally I am back and “boy, go boy” balancing is a huge challenge.  I give my self a high five for effort though.  Have a good day everyone. Namaste 🙏",Nancy Badal,2019-01-12T14:48:47Z,0

@settingnoahfree It&#39;s from having our heads below the rest of the body for an extended period of time so a lot of blood accumulates in the vessels in the head and nose.

"Balancing is hard but the core work we have done is really helping. I managed the leg balances for a short while and I even felt able to try the crow balance (for a millisecond) whereas I’ve felt not strong enough to even attempt that for several years due to weight gain / loss of upper body strength. The blood is pumping! And I’m getting thoughts about what I need to be courageous about off the mat too. Mind &amp; body are connecting ❤️🙌🏼 thank you for your input and your words Adriene.

"14635 views . Finished at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_5q_vIgPkA&amp;t=8m05s"">8:05</a> Saturday morning on the US East Coast. I feel so great! Loved the hip and leg work in this practice, but only because I’ve been building enough strength and flexibility by doing the previous Dedicate videos. I feel as good as I did when I did Truth last year and fell in love with YWA and became a subscriber. I have also been walking nightly and actually doing 2 YWA videos per day- 1 am and 1 pm. I think I lost 5 lbs this week, but mostly I am proud of the strength and flexibility I have again. Thank you for creating this free and encouraging 30 day yoga journey.",Christine Schebilski,2019-01-12T13:12:25Z,1

Adrienne this a wonderful yoga exercise to start the day with courage and hope as part of your yoga exercise series right now. There are various posture to increase stability in the body by giving them inner strength. The ending part is also encouraging to seek and find Truth in ourselves and around us.

Lovely practice like always. I am really enjoying this new 30 days! <br />Just a suggestion it is really much easier too wacht the videos when your clothes are dark or with strong colours. As I am doing the yoga and peeping the video trying not to move the head too much... when the colours are clear as today  your body mix with the backgroun and I am not able to see properly the body postures....<br />Thank you so much Adrienne for all these brilliant videos!!!,Barbara Murphy,2019-01-12T12:31:14Z,0

"10.30am in London and, as usual, have done this at 7am, and feel very good for having done it (toppled over a few times, balance not at its best this morning, had a few drinks yesterday evening but so what :) ), and now much later sitting at my desk, reading the comments and thinking, as usual, how special this is, and how remarkable it is that you have created this global yoga community and how much I&#39;ve learned from you, Adriene. Above all I think it&#39;s the whole approach...how boring it is if you set about things with gritted determination..how much better if you can get the whole thing of being present, in the moment, doing this playfully, with fun. This is what makes this such a great form of exercise to look forward to. A small gender plea here. I think it&#39;s a shame that more guys (for whatever reason) don&#39;t do yoga. Why not? They could benefit just as much. I&#39;m just guessing here, but judging by the comments male yogis here, they must be well under 5%. So come on female yogis persuade your partners, families etc to get on the mat with Adriene!",Nick Ward,2019-01-12T10:39:36Z,22

My balancing was so improved, always a little wobbly but I find the trick of rotating my ankle seems to steady my body and thoughts and retrieves my focus allowing a little freestyle and experiment in that last pose.
