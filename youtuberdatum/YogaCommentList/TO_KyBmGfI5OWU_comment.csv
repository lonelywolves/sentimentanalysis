"I modified the interlaced fingers early on because the motion from the heart to above the head just makes my shoulders hurt. They&#39;ve been pretty tight and I&#39;ve been working on helping them out. The open side plank, I tried but ended up lowering my knee because the integrity of the position was really falling apart. And yet, just as Adrienne promised, I am stepping off my mat feeling my best, strong and happy :). Thank you for this practice and for reiterating so much mind positivity. Exercising and diet culture work relentlessly at forcing in a negative inner dialogue and it&#39;s taken me a bit to be able to be in a positive space. Your videos make me feel like you &quot;catch us&quot; and help us so that we don&#39;t have to do all that mental fight alone. Thank you! ^-^",Theresa Jane,2021-05-02T23:37:18Z,0

"I&#39;d done this practice before but now i&#39;ve returned to it once again. it&#39;s been some time since the last time I&#39;ve done yoga and instead of doing the last 5-10 minutes I&#39;ve sat in extended child&#39;s pose and then in seated forward fold listening to adriene talk.<br />i think the biggest impact yoga had made on me has been the way i treat my body. previously i would get angry with myself because i couldn&#39;t do it but right now I&#39;m like. okay I&#39;m not used to thus anymore and i can&#39;t push myself anymore. how about i do something else and stretch my tired shoulders and upper back instead.<br />they say that yoga is a spiritual practice but I didn&#39;t think that this could apply to me. surprisingly this is exactly what happened lol<br />yoga has been with me at my lowest point, when i was depressed and has very low energy and yoga was the only thing i could do every day and feel like i had achieved something. (also sweet sweet serotonin was very nice)<br />now i do yoga much more rarely, however, the way it makes me feel is much !ore powerful. i would like to do more yoga like before but it&#39;s nice knowing that this isn&#39;t the only copinh mechanism i have in my life.<br />in conclusion, i would like to thank you for always being there for me, adriene, your videos have helped me immensely",Анастасия Макарович,2021-03-19T01:40:02Z,1

Today I cried uncontrollably after finding out I’m considered medically overweight through my doctor. I actually almost skipped this video because of how horrible I felt about my body and how much worse I thought I’d feel after this practice. But I followed through with my 69th day of yoga in a row and I feel better for doing it. I had to modify a lot today but I’m glad I went through with it anyhow. I don’t have any super inspiring advice I just felt like this is a good place to share today’s experience openly. Thanks again Adriene ♥️,Mikayla Weston,2021-03-11T04:38:50Z,2

"This was really challenging for me, especially mentally. So glad I am sticking to this months MOVE calendar. I always feel so much better after yoga practice and I have these wonderful mini enlightenments every time I listen to you. Today it was the realization of having the power over my own attitude. I decide how I want to approach different situations. It’s not the situation but my attitude, which decides on how it turns out. It’s my own choice and shifting the energy through yoga practice unblocked some negative attitude I had towards life and towards myself. <br /><br />I am also constantly thinking about yesterdays practice and how you said “how you talk to yourself is how you talk to others.” Everything in out life’s is a direct reflection of ourselves. The more love I can create within, the more love I can radiate outwardly. 🙏🏽🌸<br /><br />Thank you Adriene!! 🌈🌈🌼🌺🌻🌷",NAVENI MUSIC,2021-03-10T22:42:06Z,2

"There were so many helpful things that Adriene said along the way in this practice. I tried to remember them all but but stuck with me was “be sweet be curious be kind” and “work with your muscles where they are”. <br /><br />My muscles are very sensitive around my sciatic nerve and if I do some thing the wrong way I will be in a lot of pain for a long time. So in order to change my attitude, I thought of it like I’m playing the game “Operation” (which I never liked but that’s besides the point). I did have more curiosity to see how I could modify each pose to support my sciatic and all the muscles and joints surrounding. 🦴 <br /><br />I don’t think I shocked myself ♥️",Laura Reed,2021-03-10T13:54:26Z,0

I had to ease up a couple times but right now, I feel quite good. I do have a question that perhaps someone can answer. I noticed bumps appear on each of my ankles. I think they are actually blood vessels. They only seem pronounced while standing. Right now, sitting, I do not see or feel them. However, having just stood up to check, I can see and feel them again, although less so than while we were practicing. Any idea what that is?

"Hi William, you&#39;re right, this was a tough one! I get those bumps too on one of my ankles. I have been getting them since a very young age, and I never really felt much except for perhaps some funny feeling after a run, especially in cold weather. My guess is that you are correct, those are bulging veins, most likely due to a faulty valve. If you stand or sit for a long time, the blood might pool in your legs making the bulging more pronounced. I know that in some cases it can be a chronic pathology (i.e. varicose veins) but I consider a a few bumps like in my case as a benign condition. I should say that I am not a medical doctor, so please don&#39;t take my word for it. I wouldn&#39;t be worried unless you feel that it affects your blood flow. Get it checked out by a professional if it bothers you. At any rate, enjoy your yoga routine and stay healthy!!",Walter,2021-03-13T09:58:51Z,2

"I try this as a challenge before doing for almost an entire month the 20 min yoga flow, I wanted to improve a little bit and try something a little bit harder. I was scared 😂 i most say but surprisingly i did it and it feels awesome! i really feel the heat but no unconfortable or painful feeling. I also wake up really stressed and grumpy and now i feel so possitive and happy! 😍 i really love your yoga practices adriene ❤️ thank you so much!",Valentina Cruz,2020-09-20T15:56:12Z,0

"My mind is very busy, even waking me early in the morning&#39;s as dawn begins to creep through the curtains. There are family matters, schooling issues, financial pressures, work conundrums and time management impossibilities that are imposing on each day.

Even when we shop for food we are only allowed to travel within a 5km radius of our home. Some children have missing nearly half of their schooling year, as remoting learning has been in place.

"I think you should check out the video of Foundations of Yoga, especially Cat Cow or Downward Facing dog. <br /><br />I used to have the same problem but she told us to use our shoulders to push away and lengthen through arms, clawing through fingers and the flesh between thumb and index finger, that REALLY took the pressure off the wrists. Worked wonders for me! Highly recommend to check it out. It was also on the last month&#39;s (August) calendar, Beginner&#39;s Yoga/Foundation yoga video. Hope that helps you too :)",Parul S,2020-09-05T04:41:27Z,1
Anna Newman thank u very much for ur reply! i will definitely keep this in mind and be more patient. namaste 🙏🏼,luminocityjpg,2020-09-04T19:26:15Z,0
Honestly the more you practice the easier it gets as your wrists strengthen. It&#39;s okay to take a break when it hurts. You can also go onto the forearms instead which has the same benefits for each of those poses. It takes some time so just be patient :) Namaste,Anna Newman,2020-09-04T18:24:41Z,1

"Hello September build folks! Accidently did yoga for the 4th instead of the 3rd 😂 this practice, particularly talking about the balance of moon and sun energy, reminded me of a high school theater warm up. We would open our arms and chests and together proclaim &quot;I am radiating!&quot; and then we&#39;d close our arms, hugging in toward the body, and whisper &quot;I am receiving.&quot; Then we&#39;d repeat for times, each time facing a different compass direction in unison.

By incorporating 2 to 3 yoga practices per week I have made a dramatic difference in the way my body performs and then the way my head functions. I can’t recommend this website enough- In fact I do it daily in my sports chiropractic clinic to The clients that need something like this in their life.   Thank you so much.

Beautiful practice so challenging but cleansing as well.  I love that you talk about attitude.  I have found since practicing yoga religiously for about 2.5 years now that I am so much more grounded in my daily life and how I deal with challenges as they arise.  It took me over a year to actually bring my yoga practice and thought patterns into my daily life. It is such an awakening to realize how much we can shape our lives with our conscious mind. So much gratitude to you for providing these awesome free classes for all of we yogis in the world.    Namaste!,Ellen Maher,2020-06-03T14:36:59Z,0

"I have to admit that I dreaded this practice so much I skipped my daily practice yesterday and I debated skipping it altogether today. Anything regarding muscle/streght work is still quite intimidating to me, but as the theme of this month is courage, I decided to at least give it a try. Honestly, it showed me so so much- after two months of almost daily yoga I am much stronger than I thought I was. It&#39;s not just about physical strenght though- I am pretty sure that had I tried this before going on this journey I would have given up not even in the middle of the practice.

"Courage - what a wonderful theme for our new yoga journey. I think we could all use a little courage right now. Courage to speak truth to power and injustice. Courage to own up to our mistakes and privilege and failures to understand. Courage to remain hopeful, patient, and kind in the middle of a really scary time. Courage to try and hold a side plank, even though you&#39;re still building the strength to do it properly. Thank you, Adriene, for all the love and light you put out into the world.

Doing the June calendar!! Amazing. Just starting my health journey :) Wondering if there are any good modifications for the side plank? I really was struggling.,Kate Wallick,2020-06-02T01:03:32Z,0
"You could do the side plank on your forearm (elbow on the ground) instead of having your bottom arm straight. Or then you can step your top leg on the ground in front of you. So if you&#39;re facing to the left and your right leg is straight &amp; holding the plank, step your left leg on the ground in front of you for stability. I hope you could catch what that means :) I&#39;ve seen Adrienne do it in some other video, maybe Sidebody flow? There she offered many different modifications.",Ginatus,2020-06-02T07:44:48Z,1

"I&#39;m here for the June calendar, and this video is one of my personal nemesis (lol) that is because when I restarted my yoga practice, in the middle of March (and beginning of social distancing in my country), I was so bummed out for not being able to keep up. I was sweating like a pig (granted, the weather being a bit warmer didn&#39;t help) and had to make breaks in between every ahsana.<br />I wasn&#39;t really looking forward to doing it again when I saw the new calendar. To my surprise, though, I was able to do almost everything without sweating like crazy and I even enjoyed the practice. I&#39;m still not able to do the plank to downward dog and the side plank thingie without having to stop for a bit, but I&#39;m actually happy with my progress.

"Hi, I really enjoyed this today, it&#39;s my first week of following the calendar.  Beginning my yoga practice with you has meant so much to me.  I was very anxious during February and at the beginning of March and I asked a friend to recommend a gentle morning yoga to go alongside my meditation to help with anxiety and she suggested your sunrise yoga which I&#39;ve been doing for about 6 weeks now.  It was exactly what I need to find.  April was very difficult with Covid19 sweeping the world and my father passing away from it.  Keeping that 15 minutes of practice going every morning helped me so much.  It grounded me, it soothed me and it stretched my very anxious body enough to get through each day.  I tried a couple of the may calendar flows and loved them so decided to give June a go with a gentle commitment to do as much as I can and to revert back to your Sunrise flow when I need to.  I wish you and your team health,  peace and love. With gratitude, thank you. Namaste.",MissLealikes,2020-06-01T17:24:06Z,0

"I have always considered my body as a &quot;bad&quot; body (some chronic stuff going on) and every time you say things  like &quot;we work WITH our body&quot; that really helps me. The way you suggest other poses/simplified poses when something might be to hard has really helped me over time to be so much kinder to my body! I have been doing yoga regularly for a little while now, and every time I actually can do the full pose and make it all the way through the practice I am reminded that my body is actually getting better!

I daresay this one is a current favorite-- did a virtual yoga sesh with my buddy and turned this baby on in the screen share. kicked my batootey. particularly loved the bidniss about the third chakra -- the &quot;beyonce chakra&quot;-- loved how you connected that with self-confidence. I am I can ; powerful stuff. I had to run it again this morning. I also loved how you mentioned the focus, the drishti. I hadn&#39;t heard that phrase before, hearing it and hearing you define it makes me want to do a deep dive into what the sanskrit names mean for all the poses.  Thank you for another great jam.

"Another one that I thought I feared, conquered and enjoyed. I am learning (after two years of daily practice with you) what find what feels good really means. No judgement. I love the core work without the idea of &quot;repetitions&quot;.",Marilyn Lauer,2019-12-19T01:56:13Z,0
"To be honest I was intimidated by this practice at first. I had no idea of how hard that I was going to be pushed. I gave myself permission to take it slower if I needed to which meant a few more half-planks and sitting out on the mountain climbers but I finished the practice! I am proud of myself and I can see how much strength I have regained since being sick earlier this year.

"So what comes to abs &amp; arms; good news: I had an upperbody workout before this and I got to notice that my strength had improved with yoga and without any that kind of stuff (weight lifting etc.) in a while👍🏻 bad news: this wasn&#39;t a short 30 mins after the wo😂 And what comes to attitude; bad news: not an easy 30 mins, good news: I was able to be realistic and modify the asanas. I was able to be proud of myself and notice that I am already an intermediate level yogi (tho let&#39;s not categorize our yoga levels😉) but also was I able to be humble and notice that today I wasn&#39;t able to do all the full asanas but kept the alignment in the easier versions. So progress it is, mental and physical💪🏻 Thank you Adriene💕",Helmi Järvinen,2019-12-18T15:36:26Z,0

"Hands down, one of the hardest practices of yours that I&#39;ve done.

"Changing the attitude is everything… That’s the place where change starts. Recently, I experienced a crucial change in one more field thanks to the change of my attitude regarding the migraine phenomenon. Giving the fact that I become allergic to a medicament, the only one which happens to help me to easily overcome all manifestation of a migraine attack. After 15 years behaving in a helpless manner like “Oh, here comes the severe storm again, poor me, poor me…” where I used to indulge myself in the outcomes of it and turn it into nothing but suffering as long as it lasts. And I received this allergy-like message as a final warning that I should change something… And that was my attitude. Then I think of it as an excellent chance to get rid of the medicaments, chance to gain knowledge about the natural phenomenon like the migraine is (I related it to a weather changes giving the fact that it is connected to it), get more familiar with symptoms and so on. So, I undertake the research – I’m writing my diary on migraines, I found some YouTube videos on acupressure, and what is matter the most – when the first migraine came after this decision to actively participate in it, I can tell you that just the change of my attitude brings me so much relief that was amazing… And I said to myself with the smile on my face (first smile ever! while migraine attack rages, that was epic) “Now, let’s try this acupressure cure session that I found, it can’t be worst then it would be if I do nothing”. And it helped! After about half an hour the pain was gone, and I was able to continue my day properly. I’m doing that form that day on and it works. I would suggest to everyone who is suffering from migraine to Find how it Feels Good, if not already, to change the attitude and make it easier. Kind regards to all readers who make it through this writing. Namaste and wish you all weather changes be good one &lt;3 …if this makes any sense… Dear Adriene, mental growth is so much wealthier with you... Beautifull changes are happening, indeed...",Jelena Nedeljkovic,2019-08-25T12:11:35Z,0

"I’ve been using Yoga with Adrienne videos to help me get in shape for about two years now, and I always love when I use these videos because it’s a challenge for me. Each video always has a little something to make the experience more challenging, but this video was not only a physical challenge. This video challenged my mind and my thoughts. It took me longer than 32 minutes to do this practice. But it didn’t take me as long as it would’ve when I first began my journey. I told myself I could do it, and when my body needed a moment to catch a breath, I took the moment without shaming myself for it. This video did indeed call to my abs and arms, but it also worked my attitude, which I wasn’t expecting to be worked as much as it was during this practice. Thank you, Adriene! Your videos have been helping me for a very long time, and they always make me feel good about where I am and working with my body instead of on my body (as you mentioned in this video)!",SimplySarah,2019-08-22T18:03:30Z,1
"I swapped my days in Reunite as time allowed today. This practice was tough for this senior yogi and I managed all but those last side plank moves so I did my version. I loved the steeple grip, 007 ? 😂 for my arms, awesome, struggled to relax in downward dog, but loved the general core work. Relaxing afterwards in shavasana, as you say, I could really feel the nutrients of our practice working through my body ..... a lovely feeling !

"I always like to try the &#39;Yoga for Weightloss&#39; videos because you can be sure there will be some challenging poses and a decent workout. Of course yoga isn&#39;t just for working out, but sometimes that&#39;s what some people want from it and it&#39;s good to know that you can get a bit of a workout with it sometimes.",Alexandra Panico,2019-07-09T08:03:49Z,0

Hi Adriene! Thank you so much for being you! I wanted to let you know that I had a really neat experience. I was visiting Chiang Mai in Thailand and walking through a park I saw a girl doing yoga. She was looking at her phone and as I walked by I noticed that it was your set and realized that it was you! So I had to turn back and hope that she&#39;s spoke English and say something to her!

There is a Prenatal Yoga For All Trimesters available in the FWFG Membership - <a href=""https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/prenatal-yoga"">https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/prenatal-yoga</a> . In general, avoid twists below the neck, core activation or anything on the belly. Hip openers are good but I advise to go easier in third trimester. Modify core moves with reclined cobblers pose, modify belly stuff with expended child’s pose or yogi’s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold.

I am proud of myself even though my body is weak sometimes and my wrists are nowhere near as strong as I would like them to be. but nonetheless I can feel some progress. last year I wouldn&#39;t have lastet more than a few minute into this video. now I feel empowered and self confident even though I can&#39;t execute half of the exercises. this is such an awesome feeling. so let&#39;s continue this journey!,꧁nevermind꧂,2019-06-05T20:37:38Z,0

"Hi Adriene! Long time subscriber, but I&#39;m fairly certain this is my first time commenting (I apologize for that). Sorry for this dumb question; but would you recommend doing 1-2 Yoga For Beginners videos (on your playlist) per day; or could I incorporate other videos too, as part of a &quot;re-beginning&quot; practice? I used to be a ballerina, yoga enthusiast and SUPER flexible; and while I&#39;m still very lean (practice ballet for fun) and into yoga, my flexibility and yoga abilities have gone downhill over the past few years (due to foot injuries/surgeries). I&#39;m also on the ending &quot;leg&quot; of healing from sciatic nerve issues and a locked up sacrum - both of which I had for a solid 2 weeks (but thanks to your Yoga for Sciatica, Yoga For Hips and Low Back Release and Yoga For Low Back Pain videos, I&#39;ve been able to naturally heal these issues!! I did all the videos all these weeks, every day in a row). Long comment, but I just want to make sure I do your videos daily as I rebuild flexibility, core strength and foot strength (also did your Yoga For Feet video).",Liz S.,2019-06-04T11:38:55Z,0

I really liked your reminder about attitude and tying in the mental challenges with the physical ones (this was put to the test, for me, during the plank countdown that started at 10! :)). As usual, Benji provides that extra dollop of zen to complement yours. Thanks for all you do! Ever grateful.",blinddog1212,2019-06-03T12:50:14Z,0

"This is the first comment I’ve made on YouTube. I have to say I had been practicing yoga with Adriene every day since January 4th, but felt I wasn’t being challenged enough recently. So, I tried doing yoga with another YouTube channel for the last two weeks. More challenging, yes, but my mood has not been the greatest. Yesterday I decided to come back to Adriene and after that and today’s session, I feel more myself. My energy is back and my attitude is positive. I realized I felt like I lost a friend without my daily dose of Adriene. Thank you for being a light in the world.",Erin Pristavec,2019-06-02T15:12:58Z,1

I&#39;m not sure what brand she uses currently but I think I&#39;m right in saying she&#39;s used Manduka in the past. They&#39;re who I use and once I&#39;ve worked on them for a few weeks my hands no longer slip. Hope this helps! If not it&#39;s always good to try popping a towel down too.,Maddie Smith,2019-06-02T15:32:59Z,1
"This year I started with DEDICATE and have been dedicated to practicing nearly every day. Must admit that I did a gentle morning practice this morning because yesterday we spent 3 hours prepping our garage for painting and then 4 hours painting it.  However, this busy time of year has shown me the benefits of daily practice.  Although I&#39;m tired and a little sore, I am not stiff after spending hours on projects like painting or perennial flower beds!  Trust me, I&#39;m middle aged and I know stiff!

Namaste and all the heart emojis",Hannah Tattersall,2019-06-02T08:19:22Z,0

Thanks Adriene you are awesome and we love you and Benji 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🐶💞🙏",Gill Smith,2019-06-02T07:52:17Z,0
