Oh and the kind thing I have done is to do yoga every single day of the year so far.  323. 2020 is good for that–– and the hope!!,Nan Elizabeth Jorgensen,2020-11-20T09:33:08Z,0
"So funny!! I have a cat Benji ( who is  about 2-3 years older than your darling Benji) and he decided to curl up right on my belly for the first half of this before we moved off our backs. I was thinking--Benji knows where the action is!!! My other yoga companion is my devoted enthusiastic Beowulf, our German Shepherd. I love them to do yoga with me. So much inspiration then for the down dogs from Beowulf. Thank you Adriene 💞I feel great!",Nan Elizabeth Jorgensen,2020-11-20T09:30:45Z,0

I really like your style...you feel genuine and honest...not like a lot of yoga videos where the girls have globs of makeup and fake tan on (which I do like in the right situation) but not when I&#39;m working out.

"I&#39;ve watched everyone of your series, probably 50 times per series as I rely on your videos for warm up pre-climb; I climb a lot. This video, hands down, is my favorite warm up for lead climbing for the front portion of my core and stretching my lower back. Do you have a recommendation for another of your video, I&#39;m guessing outside of your series videos, that is going to intense enough to warm my lower back and hamstrings for lead climbing? Thanks for everything, you do a fantastic job, be safe.",Dom Aleandri,2020-12-06T17:27:56Z,0

"I went back to this practice from Friday 20th, I was feeling 🥴so then I was doing gentle. But thanks to Adriene, I’m feeling better and recovering and needing to build strength so this was good, but as a senior yogi, I took it steady and adjusted to meet my edge, missed the odd vinyasa flow and went straight to downward dog for a little pedal. Now, when it came to mountain climbers I breathed deep and did slow ones and that did it for me, a great workout 😊💪 see you tomorrow on the mat 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💕",Gill Smith,2020-11-28T08:53:54Z,0

I kept saying &quot;Wow! Am I actually doing this? With ease too!&quot; throughout this entire practice - I was laughing at the prana when it got tough instead of beating myself up mentally for &quot;struggling.&quot; I feel so strong and supported. I even cried a little during mountain just because I am so grateful to have found my yoga practice. It has seriously saved me, not only helped my physical body feel better but I am definitely benefitting off the mat, mentally, as well from YWA. Just - thank you thank you thank you.

"This is one of my favorite core workouts--I just keep coming back to it! It&#39;s always challenging enough to where I feel it in my belly the next day but fun and relaxing enough for me to do in the evenings as a quick break from work. I was also thrilled today that I finally managed to go through the whole flow without taking breaks or falling over during the high lunges, haha. Love it! &lt;3",Olivia Bedford,2019-09-29T02:58:38Z,2

Gratitude for my life, my body, for strength, for growth, for change, for confidence, it just went on and on! I feel so happy and grateful. I also wanted to thank you for your mindful gentleness. I was doing yoga about a month ago with another instructor and I injured myself when I pushed too much. I haven&#39;t been able to come back until this week and I noticed how part of the reason I was never injuring myself with you was because of the focused and gentle awareness you ensure we take for our body and to never push beyond an appropriate limit.

"Adriene!! I just got word you will be in my neck of the woods at the incredible Red Rocks!!! There is a lot in life to get excited about, but the fact that you will be at one of the most beautiful,  grounding venues.... I&#39;m over the moon!! I started practicing YWA in 2015 after I was forced to move from PA to CO to save my daughter (epilepsy sucks, cannabis saves/d!) -- YWA videos, YOU were my savior in a place and time I felt I was falling apart. Now 4 years later, I&#39;m still practicing with you daily and you have 100% changed my life physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually... I love you, Adriene. You don&#39;t know me, but I love you! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23namaslay"">#namaslay</a> 🙏💚",Dena Sneath Wilson,2019-05-28T19:51:11Z,0

"I have been doing yoga for weight loss for quite some time now. You are an amazing teacher and I love how laid back and goofy you are, it makes the experience much more enjoyable that you can be relatable. I had been experiencing quite a bit of pain and have now just been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, and I&#39;m sure you get a ton of requests but it would be amazing if you could do a sequence for people with fibromyalgia! I wouldn&#39;t want to do it with anyone but you. 😘",Cassie Brownell,2019-04-05T14:12:32Z,0

"Hi Adriene, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for your incredible videos, you&#39;ve been inspiring me for months now and I haven&#39;t spent one single day without yoga since then. Most importatly, the practice has been literally curing my depression and immensely relieving the symptoms of a disease that I have called Myoclonic Dystonia, so I am very grateful for you and your dedication to help people. If you could answer me one question only, I would appreciate it: I am 5.6 foot tall, and my legs have 3.9 foot length - does that make it more difficult for me to gain flexibility, do some of the poses or anything else, or is it the same for everyone? I still can&#39;t even touch my feet with straight legs :( Anyway, thank you again for your channel, it has changed my life! Namaste",Juliana Guinsani,2019-03-25T23:04:09Z,0

I sure listened, I am grateful for my tailbone and the miles she&#39;s come. I will not drag her on roads until she&#39;s ready. P. S. I always - always- sing with you; when you go: once, twice, I go: three times a laaaadaay. From the legendary Yoga for backpain.

"Hello Adriene! I just want to say thank you! Your channel has changed how I look at my body. Thanks to you I have found my yoga practice and now I can not imagine a life without it. I January I started the 30 days of yoga for the second time and this time around I have not stopped. I have done every single practice from Dedicate, Care and Reset this year up until now and it has not even felt hard. My daily yoga session (with your videos) is my breathing space and the one thing that keeps me grounded no matter how stressful everything around me might be. I cannot thank you (and your team!) enough for making these videos. Namaste &lt;3",Linnéa,2019-03-24T15:02:15Z,0

Good day everybody. It&#39;s about time i did some core work given that i&#39;ve been &quot;desk bound&quot; for literally the entire past week working on various assignments that i now feel like i&#39;m developing love handles again. Time to tend to my body and get it back to where it used to be by showing my core some love. Love the ground core work Adriene. I&#39;m grateful that you somehow always know exactly what we need and it&#39;s what i consider a pure blessing to have you by our side each and every day. Thank you for who you are and what you do. Much love. Namaste.,Shadan Zahrooni,2019-03-24T05:35:50Z,0

@Andi Katona bless you. I&#39;m sorry to hear that you&#39;re having a hard time with your knee. I was resigned to suffering forever with pain and lack of movement. I needed a solution. Yoga has provided excellent therapy. I sincerely hope that it will support and benefit you too. Many best wishes and Namaste 🙏,Christina Ravenhill-Boast,2019-05-06T21:41:56Z,1
@Christina Ravenhill-Boast That is so good to read! I had knee surgery 4 years ago and my knee still hurts sometimes and I can&#39;t walk and stand properly due to its problems...but you have given me hope. Namaste!,Andi Katona,2019-05-06T20:02:41Z,4
@Kim Mancini it&#39;s a pretty wonderful thing. May you find even more healing and strength. Namaste 🙏,Christina Ravenhill-Boast,2019-04-16T15:22:03Z,2

"The lady, Adriene, does indeed reply. Her caring and sweet nature are the things that set her apart. Can&#39;t beat her lovely yoga. I had knee surgery over a decade ago, and was in pain every day and unable to kneel. Since taking up yoga my knee is remarkably better. Barely any pain, stronger and I can kneel. All thanks to Adriene. Huge thanks indeed 💟",Christina Ravenhill-Boast,2019-03-30T17:24:20Z,19
