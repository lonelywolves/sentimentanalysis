As I sent my assignment, I felt the relief of knowing that no matter how long and hard a day feels, we can always meet on the mat at the end of it.

That said, every month I experience uncomfortable cramps thanks to Aunt Flo.  I never considered doing yoga for PMS.  Until now.  This yoga session worked faster than Midol.

"This video and Adrienne area lifesaver. Once I turned 20 I went from having no symptoms or pain to having unbearable period cramps and aches that have me barely able to move. It doesn&#39;t help that I unload trucks very early in the morning and that just adda to the pressure and strain on my muscles. It feels so nice after a long hard shift to come home and just give myself some tlc and try and help my body. I also reallt enjoy pairing this video with her Lower Back and Hamstrings video on days where the pain is especially bad and we need that extra stretch. Thank you so much Adrienne for your videos, dedication and love. The loving (and non gendered! always a bonus as a non binary person) atmosphere that is so comforting.",Mo,2020-10-09T00:35:46Z,0

"I love both your period videos, the other one a bit more because I&#39;m a sucker for restorative yoga and the more props the better! As a yoga teacher in training I&#39;ve loved reading the comments from trans and non binary people. I wanted to bring something a bit different to my yoga classes and that&#39;s, yoga is for every body. My primary reason, originally, was for people like myself who have mobility issues and those who think they can&#39;t practice for whatever reason, you can do it in a chair! I also want to bring a lot more of the meditative side, my teacher was fantastic but it was something that was missing for me. If my students don&#39;t want that in the class then I&#39;ll change it up. Having read the comments I realised another thing that I want to bring and that&#39;s, nobody will ever feel uncomfortable or out of place in my class. Regardless of gender, race, age, and so on I don&#39;t care, you will be welcomed with open arms. That&#39;s the type of person I am, always have been and always will be. Life is hard enough without getting crap over your sexuality or what gender you do, or don&#39;t, identify with.

I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do with out you, I&#39;ve lost count of the times you&#39;ve picked me up and helped me get back on track.

When I finally got home I had the worst cramps.

The stress of the world situation and all these little things really had me in shambles today. So I came to you and I could not have been led to a more appropriate video.

Hello Adriene! THANK YOU for doing this. I hope you are okay.<br /><br />I have a hard time gaining weight and beeing healthy lately. I feel like I am pure bones when I look at myself. I DONT WANT THAT. I want to feel STRONG and not weak while teaking two steps walking. Do you have any ideas how I can be strong and GAIN WEIGHT again? I want to look and feel healthy again.<br /><br />You helped me so much exploring me beeing healthy in the past. But I lost that direction somehow by stressing to much about my situations in life.<br /><br />What should I do? Is there a yoga practice that helps gaining weight and wellbeeing?<br /><br />Thank you for your time!<br /><br />♡ lucija,lucyluuu17,2019-10-25T08:26:02Z,0

No se trata sólo de biología, sino de toda la experiencia vital que nos constituye.<br />Yo seguiré practicando con tu anterior video PMS, hecho  para las chicas, porque te agradezco y valoro que en esos días de malestar para muchas de nosotras, haya una propuesta así. <br />Que la lucha por la igualdad no conlleve el borramiento de las diferencias.<br />Con amor",Laura Raquel Amaya Botello,2019-10-22T14:15:31Z,0

Super intense cramps arrived today after a rather bad night because of a stubborn headache. I&#39;ve felt so tense and in pain and finally guided by you and benji I could find some ease. I didn&#39;t know I needed to cry but you helped me let go and I feel more free now. Letting me know it was ok whatever emotions might come was important to me. Thank you for this. I needed this so much. ❤️,Joy Aileen,2019-10-21T14:34:28Z,1

"I can’t explain how much this means. The previous version of this video has been there for me on many a crampy grouchy sensitive day, and while it’s a great practice, the association to gender just pangs in my heart a little bit. It would prevent me from fully relaxing into my practice and reaping all the benefits it had to offer. Now I can enjoy it even more! The bar is really low and it shouldn’t have to be such a big deal to be included in things like this, but unfortunately it is rare for me and my trans and nonbinary community to be acknowledged and considered, so I thank you deeply for this. Much love ❤️❤️❤️❤️",Emma,2019-10-21T13:31:14Z,0

"I understand updating videos from time to time, but I cannot get behind this idea of a person who isn’t “female” having a period. Only women get periods, only women can bear children. It is jolting to think how many people exist out there that cannot accept who they are on even a biological level. How can this be yoga? To support the denial of one’s own self and who you were born to be? As a woman, I’m offended that there are people out there who wish to take away this exclusive and special claim we have to being female, the ultimate culmination of femininity, this natural right that allows only us women to cultivate and bring new life into this world. Only WOMEN have the biology to do that and I am proud to be one!",Tawnie Barrette,2019-10-20T21:30:10Z,4

"@amberisrad I&#39;ve never ( nor will ever)  repudiate gender dysphoria, period.  I understand inclusivity: women and uterus havers/menstruators will suffice. <br /><br /> EVERY time the word woman is erased/taken off,  the message is (to those of us who are female dealing with SEXISM) your existence is a problem-moreso younger girls than women my age. <br /><br />If the only way to include our NBs and transmen is through the erasure of the word woman, that&#39;s not intersectionality, it&#39;s collectively accepted misogyny.",Maria Chequita,2020-01-05T04:40:03Z,10

"@Roxana Kristina okay its an old comment but I cannot let this pass : not only everyone&#39;s preferred pronouns and therefore identity should be respected without question, but there are SO many traditional non-occidental societies that recognize a third gender or beyond. In India for instance, there is a whole cast of transgender people which has existed for hundreds of years. Same goes for some Polynesians people and for some native American tribes.

"Hi Adriene, I have been a big fan of yours for ages, I recommend you to a lot of people too.<br />I got your email in which you stated why you redid the video for women&#39;s menstrual cramps/PMS and said it wasn&#39;t inclusive enough as you called us ladies.<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m sorry to say, but women suffer from menstrual cramps, women have PMS, and likewise, women have Endometriosis.<br /><br /><br />I am a woman who suffers from Endo, and I hate to see woman be removed from society, why are we so afraid of it now? It&#39;s a girl&#39;s/women&#39;s issue and removing that from issues such as periods may feel inclusive to you, for the small minority (less than 1% of people) however, it&#39;s making 50% of people invisible again, when we as a sex have worked so hard for visibility.<br /><br /><br />Please think about this. It&#39;s important to claim womanhood and be proud of it, not to diminish it and be scared to even say it. Menstrual cramps is a women&#39;s issue.",Lady Em,2019-10-20T12:36:05Z,14
"@Lady Em Couldn&#39;t agree more with you! I have the utmost respect for the challenges trans people go through &amp; am fully supportive of those who have transitioned to become women, or vice versa, however I will not marginalise myself as a woman to fit in with and &#39;respect&#39; a narrative which is scientifically inaccurate and stems from a political ideology (which is a totally different thing to genuine transgenderism!).

I&#39;m proud of what I&#39;ve been through to get here, and it&#39;s empowering to talk woman to woman and use that word WOMAN! For Adrienne to not even mention us as women during this time that bonds us as a sex is hurtful to women, but it seems our feelings are not paramount, it&#39;s the feelings of the less than 1%.",Lady Em,2019-10-21T07:24:53Z,2

"Emma Jo Right, I get that. I think we’re all learning and it can feel overwhelming, but I do think language does need to evolve to suit the times. Guess it’s more about how people identify. You can be a bio female but identify as male, so they would feel excluded in a cramps video for “just us girls”. I’m a girl, so I personally like the language, but realize other people can be left out and as yogis and learners, we don’t want to leave anyone out. But I get your points, it can be crackers! I think we still have lots to learn about each other. Remember that Adriene’s original PMS video is still up for those who want it!",Stephanie Kane Gordon,2019-10-20T18:11:52Z,0

"ohh my god adriene youre amazing , every week you made a video for what i need .when i suffer from hands you made a video for them , when my legs are tired during the week you made a video for legs ...and now😲 , i suffered whole yesterday from cramps . weird coincidence 😂😍🤩",Zeinab Kassir,2019-10-20T05:15:58Z,2
"I really appreciate your newsletter email about this video. My first reaction was &quot;What is Adriene talking about redoing this video for gender inclusion? Only ladies have menstrual happenings...&quot; and then I&#39;m like oh not if they are gender fluid or go by &quot;They&quot; and happen to also have a lovely working uterus, etc... Anyway. Thank you, mind opened a little bit. <br /><br />Ps. I did yoga today! :)",Emily Cohan,2019-10-20T05:15:18Z,31
It&#39;s not just genderfluid or nonbinary people. Many trans men also have a working uterus,theKathi,2019-10-20T06:09:32Z,15

Yes she is!,Arundathi Yasok,2020-04-18T06:57:17Z,0
She kept uploading the videos I really needed for a while now. I&#39;m new to the channel and to yoga and it helped me A LOT. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without these practices. I mean Adrienne even made a highly specific yoga for writers video and I&#39;ve been meaning to improve this skill so much. She&#39;s wonderful 😍😍 what would we do without her,xDbjchb khfdsvj,2019-10-24T00:54:31Z,0
