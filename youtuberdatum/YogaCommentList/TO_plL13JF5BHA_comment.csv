"Day 11 of the July Challenge on SHIFT. Just back from a 40 minute run and did today’s practice. What a great sequence for runners! I already use the pre and post run practice and find it has been excellent for keeping pains at bay. But i do love this practice. Especially the twist for the lower lumbar. Excellent! Thanx Adriene!

YWA July 2020 :) I have done this video before. It came up in a search for leg stretching about 2 months ago. For me the titles have been a little lesson. I probably wouldn&#39;t have done yoga for swimmers in the past. It was the best thing I did for myself that day. No judgment zone! Doing what feels right.  Woohoo!

"yoga never ceases to amaze me. I&#39;ve been practicing for over 15 years now but the last 2 years, I&#39;ve transitioned into a different training regimen including at least two runs and two strength workouts and found it hard to get back on the mat and practice mindfulness and stillness. However, after two great runs over the weekend I found myself in a flunk and had terrible gut cramping and issues. I knew I pushed my body too hard. So after a full two days in a row of zero activity (that never happens to me now) which really dug into my self esteem, (I know it shouldn&#39;t and I should cherish my body and understand its capacities and limitations but that&#39;s still hard for me to put into practice) all I really wanted to do was to reconnect so I did this Runners yoga and Sunday&#39;s gut health yoga back to back and oh man, I did not see the time fly. My body feel brand new and relaxed. Like a breath of fresh air. Exactly what I needed. Thank you Adriene.",Solène Buffet,2019-12-04T18:22:23Z,0

"Oh, what a perfect sequence! My exercise routines are a combination of running and yoga, and yours are always my favorites! However over the past 2 months I have been running virtual races and I pushed myself to the limit with my running. I was running every day and was too tired for yoga. I knew I was neglecting the need for that balance between the two, and told myself I’d take time off from races to get back to that perfect harmony. Yesterday was the first time I did a yoga sequence in 2 months and it was this one. Your words about balance struck the perfect note with me and coming back to my peace and my body with you coaching me was the balm my tired and sore muscles and mind needed. Thank you for all you do!!",Megs,2019-07-18T02:19:28Z,8

I find your videos both challenging and relaxing and not at all annoying which is really rare for YouTube channels. Thanks for what you do!  I did have a question and maybe you’ve already done it but do you have any video suggestions for people working on their balance and also can you make any recommendations for stretches or routines for people struggling with tendinitis/carpal tunnel in the wrist causing grip problems. I know that’s highly specific but I’m always looking for something to help with my balance because I’m easily knocked over and I’ve worked on computers for over a decade and I know I’m not the only one that struggles with wrist problems as a result and it makes your wrist weak.

"Hi gorgeous Adriene. I would like to ask you a question. I&#39;ve been suffering from sinunsitis since I was 18 years old now i&#39;m 36 years old, I could manage it until I had two babies because  the fungus went to different parts of my body after my pregnancies and is been 10 years of trying everything, holistic, naturopath, any doctor that you can imagine, I&#39;ve done detox programs, etc. and sometimes it gets better with the treatment but it keeps coming back. I feel is in my liver and because my liver cannot detox because of this fungus my ovaries and uterus are suffering too and I have polyps, cyst, etc. I also suffer from horrible anxiety since I remember, I also tried everything for that. What I wanted to ask you is: Of all the yoga videos you have, which one would be the most beneficial for the fungal infection in my body?. In another hand you inspire me so much, thank you so much for being here for us =). (I apologize for my English, my first language is Spanish).",yasnitac82,2019-06-25T00:19:26Z,0

"Hey Adriene. Thanks for the wonderful service you give to the Yoga community. I have a question for you. As a former judo and sports athlete and now a middle aged dad who has taken up athletics coaching etc. We would always be taught to warm up your body prior to undertaking any form of stretching. However whilst I’m a yoga fan, I constantly find Yoga classes both online and in class are delivered without proper prior warm up. And often such as this class undertaking static stretching without getting the muscles warm. What is your take on this?",John Neilson,2019-06-24T06:55:51Z,0

"Hello! We have a Prental Yoga For All Trimesters available in the FWFG Membership - <a href=""https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/prenatal-yoga"">https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/prenatal-yoga</a> and in our shop - <a href=""https://do.yogawithadriene.com/prenatal-yoga"">https://do.yogawithadriene.com/prenatal-yoga</a>. In general, most women are able to continue a regular practice through month eight if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. <br /><br />As always, consult your doctor/physician before starting and follow their advice.",Yoga With Adriene,2019-06-24T16:05:06Z,0

@Lesley Gaisford This! Going to a class occasionally is really helpful but practicing at home is equally if not more important,Robbin Ploeger,2019-08-06T22:40:56Z,0
"Most yoga classes where I am are between 8 and 15£ per class (the latter being 90 mins with a senior teacher). I don&#39;t think that&#39;s expensive, considering how little hours you can realistically do as a teacher and time it takes to prep, cost of a place to rent etc.. I love Adriene BUT she can&#39;t see what you are doing. I find my &#39;live&#39; classes invaluable, they make sure my alignment is right, I deepen my practice and I don&#39;t hurt myself in the long run. I practice 2/3rds at home, the rest in class.
