Breath - done<br />Home - done <br />Onto Dedicate <br />Feeling great ! It was tough ! Still can&#39;t drop down to the ground from plank pose ! I guess all in due time ! :)<br />Those willing to try yoga must start with Breath as Home is a little more intense ! <br />Thanks Adriene &lt;3,Aashka Shah,2021-04-27T19:38:55Z,0

"Well Ladies &amp; Gentleman, <br /><br />Here we are, here YOU are. Day 30. I just completed all 30 days of this journey and reflecting back it wasn&#39;t always easy to get to the mat and click play on the video. but i made it, and here i am, with a body thats more flexible and energetic than when i first started, and a yoga vocabulary that is more full and vibrant than when i first began. reflecting back on this I gave myself a hug and said I am proud of you Corey :) <br /><br />it is important to give ourselves moments of appreciation and just pure gratitude. I invite you to take a moment and thank yourself. reflect upon who you once were and how you have grown through the process and although at times it gets painful and scary, you always pull through. you deserve a moment of appreciation, from my heart to yours,<br /><br />you are loved, you are appreciated.<br /><br />Namaste.",Conscious Corey,2021-05-03T01:05:07Z,1
"Hi! For anyone who might not exactly be vibing with this video&#39;s style, I found the 2015 video &quot;Yoga for Gratitude&quot; to be a nice substitute, still get to relish the idea of being thankful for what the journey has been, and getting a longer process in, but with the auditory guidance some of us love too much to give up. Happy practicing!!",Chelsea McMillen,2021-05-02T14:54:10Z,0
"I won&#39;t lie, this entire yoga journey took me more than 30 days to finish. With my depression hitting me hard and the pandemic still at play, there were some dark days that I didn&#39;t feel like getting out of bed. But I am happy to say that even though it took me more like 60 days than 30 days to complete, I&#39;m glad I finished this. It takes me a long time to finish things but when they are done I feel proud of myself and here I felt that. Thank you Adriene for creating this, I look forward to continuing your 30 day yoga series :)",Alexandra Ciardullo,2021-05-02T14:48:53Z,1

"Adriene &amp; Benji thank you from the bottom of my heart for this 30 day Home practice. This is my second 30 day practice with you.  I started with Breath and just completed Home. My next journey is Renew🙏🏻 I’ve showed up to the mat every morning to be inspired and to give myself a gift every day, and to FWFG!! You have helped me get through some “darkish” mornings. I love the energies I experience with yoga. After each morning practice I go right into meditation which is the “frosting on the cake” for me 🥰. I just wanted to take this time to say that I am grateful for your work and I appreciate you and Benji💜...with love Namaste🧘🏼‍♀️💜🐾💜",Cheryl Forino,2021-04-30T13:28:36Z,0

"I always cry on the last day.. Because it mean&#39;s soooo much. And all this music from others 30 days... I remember each of them. And I realized, how many time I did yoga with You. I started in april) year ago... You just gave me more then yoga classes. You gave me home and self balance, noticing and self love. I just started to love a world around me, every sunrise and sunset, I started to live in moments and now I feel so better each day I open my eyes. It&#39;s unbelievable. And all this thanks to You.

"YAY I finished another 30 days with you, Adriene. Every Namaste I bow my head and say, &quot;Thank you, Adriene&quot;.

"I was so disappointed with today&#39;s practice. I had worked so hard and made so much progress in the past month, and then today you went silent.

"I just finished day 30! I came here on day one so emotional, because my oldest child had just moved out and I was so sad and missing him. I turned his old bedroom into my yoga space and it has been so wonderful to come in here every morning and practice with Adriene. I have a hard time keeping to a routine/habit and I&#39;m very proud of myself for getting to the mat every day. I feel more calm, flexible (emotionally and physically) and less creaky joints. I will be honest I was disappointed when I realized there would be no queuing on this last day. I got frustrated midway through and turned it off, but then I thought to myself &quot;Adriene has been such a great guide and teacher on this journey, perhaps she knows what she is doing&quot; and I restarted it. I followed along the best I could and added in some of my own things, like pigeon pose and some hip openers instead of some vinyasa. I feel so proud of myself for pushing through the unknown with this last video and it turned out it was great. And yes like many of you, the swelling music at the end combined with Adriene&#39;s sweet smiling face, and then the beautiful quote... I was def crying.

This 30 days yoga practice helped me so much spiritually and physically to go through the 3rd lockdown here in Greece! Thank you!!! &lt;3 will definately continue the yoga journey!,Sophie Vourdanou,2021-03-01T09:29:13Z,1
"Congratulations and big hugs to all of my February 2021 Home friends! I had two big emotional moments in this practice -- first, with &quot;knocking on heaven&#39;s door,&quot; I let out a little giggle that turned into a full on sob. Then, as the practice was ending, I thought about how I stayed present in the moment during the whole practice, and was overcome by emotion. I somewhat followed what Adriene was doing, and added in some of my own flow. It felt amazing to be in my body and just experience the moment. Thanks to everyone whose energy has lifted up my January and February 2021, you are amazing!",Elle B,2021-02-28T17:34:58Z,9
What kind of mat do you use? Do you clean it? I have a hard time wanting to rest my head where my feet have been lol.,Angelina Vivanco,2021-02-28T16:17:01Z,0
"Just a comment for myself. I completed the &quot;home&quot;-journey, after doing &quot;Breath&quot; in january. The last day in january was not good for me. I didn&#39;t know what to do, tried to follow Adriene and that didn&#39;t work for me. So now I let everything go (not knowing what I was going to do for 40 minutes, being distracted, not being able to focus for so long, ..) and I did it. I felt very emotional in the end and I feel proud of myself. Lots of love in, lots of love out.",Femke Vandebroek,2021-02-28T08:26:40Z,29
"That was the same for me. Took 2 months to finish &quot;Breath&quot; and now did &quot;Home&quot; in March. The last day felt very different, this time I did trust myself and did what I felt like. Since it&#39;s way past midnight, I did my todays practice very light and chill, but it felt so nice to just move myself with her in a way. Although going through very different motions most of the time. <br />Felt good to see someone else felt similar about getting more familiar with this freestyle 😊",Pipilota Neostus,2021-03-31T23:21:30Z,0
Very proud of this accomplishment! I’m continuing with you Adriene with your Breath journey challenge. It is now part of my night routine before bed. It gives me a reason to move a bit even when I have the kids home.,choukchouk,2021-02-26T04:28:42Z,0
"This is my second 30day challenge by Adrienne, and planning to continue with the newest. This changed my life. ❤️<br />But also, I am so sad to have missed both last days in these challenges because I just don’t trust myself to being able to do this alone. Especially when I read all of your comments. 🥺<br />I start and get frustrated because I don’t enjoy it as much as when Adrienne is talking... <br />nevertheless, I love you and your work Adrienne 🥰",Kristina Sitaric,2021-02-25T19:46:03Z,0

"The last moments of this practice were emotional for me. I started yoga before but it was not something like this - a yoga journey. I am a beginner at yoga and the journey was worthwhile. A lot of emotions sparked within every practice and I get to see more light every day. I experimented a bit on when I do these sessions and doing it in the morning makes me wanna wake up and start the day early and right. <br /><br />Thank you, Adriene, for being a wonderful guide and friend. This has been a wonderful journey and I&#39;m jumping in to another 30-day journey with you :D",Kyren Cabellon,2021-02-22T10:58:50Z,0

"ended up having to take a 2 week break at day 28 for a back injury.. came back to 29 yesterday and when i saw this was unguided i almost skipped it, instantly feeling frustrated and upset because the guidance is what keeps me focused and here instead of stuck in my trauma thoughts... spend the better part of the video on and off crying and feeling all the areas that are blocked and loaded with old emotion.. felt anxious and like i had to be watching the screen for exact movement until i skipped a section to just hold pigeon poses and work my hips and felt like i could finally take a breath.. this was an intense but very needed emotional release and im proud of myself for sticking through with it... thank you for this. cant wait to start the new 30 day practice from this year",Seraiah Apelian,2021-02-20T15:56:15Z,1

"Really been with you Adrienne for so many years - and love my time with you. I never complained of anything but really this last without mike was a very bad idea - I had to keep an eye on tv continuously so all attention from breathing and postures was taken away - Also you don’t know what arrangement people have in their homes ... mine is such that I have to place my mat at a right angle to the tv but it’s ok because most of the time I’m listening and following. Sometimes I don’t even cast on tv , I just use my phone. Therefore this was really not working for me. Bad ending to a good month. 😏",rafiya hasan,2021-02-20T08:06:07Z,0
"Thank you Adriene for teaching me that self love isn&#39;t made by being super strong, going to the gym everyday and doing a lot of intense exercise to feel good. It&#39;s just to show up for yourself every day, having that appreciation that you are a human and you&#39;re here and alive. I&#39;ve been trying different types of exercise but this one is my favorite. It not only made my body stronger but my mind too. This is the first ever 30 day journey I&#39;ve completed being fully committed to (I skipped 2 days but I forgive myself for it) &lt;3",Nanaumi,2021-02-18T21:34:29Z,0
Adriene!! I started this 30 day journey in the middle of the summer when I was feeling down and I needed some sunshine. 30 days has turned into a lot of months later but I finally finished today and even though I had some pauses in between I wanted to finish so badly. So here I am! Thank you for guiding us through and teaching us to love our bodies!!,Maddy Mermelstein,2021-02-17T22:52:36Z,0
"11 months it took me. 11 months since the start of the first lockdown in the UK. I had to restart from day 1 4 times, but I finished it eventually.

Today is our last day of this 30 days journey! Me and my husband are very grateful! We were absolutely beginners and love your practice. <br /> We only struggle on the day 30 as we have to look at the screen all the time to follow. We think would have been better with the instructions so we could have followed without watching at the screen. Thank you for all! We will continue practicing yoga with you. Our every day yoga has help us a lot during this difficult time. Send you lots of love from London :),laura narro,2021-02-14T19:24:51Z,0
Mic free isn’t for me.  I’ve hurt my neck from constantly trying to look at the screen to see when to come out of downward dog for the next move. I loved the length and the speed but not the lack of direction.,Choc Mak,2021-02-14T08:56:00Z,1
"i am so thankful to have found adriene&#39;s channel. a little over a month ago i broke up with my partner and i was at the lowest i&#39;ve been mentally and physically (even more so bc of covid) but it&#39;s all changed and a big part of that was because of yoga and this channel. yoga has always been something i thought was rather boring of a sport and didn&#39;t think i had the attention span for it but now it&#39;s one of my favorite times of the day, and the time flies by so fast when i&#39;m doing it i always wish the practices were longer! even though i still have hard days where i&#39;m sad or anxious or miss home, i know that adriene is always waiting for me every morning and even if everything in the world seems chaotic and i don&#39;t know what to do, these yoga practices will be there for me everyday. that in itself has helped me so much and i&#39;ve learned to be less overwhelmed by my feelings and am so happy to come to the mat each day to practice with adriene. i never thought i was a yoga type of person but it&#39;s one of the best things i could have done for myself in 2021! :)",silly samira,2021-02-14T07:37:12Z,0

"This is my 30th day in yoga, so it’s been a month since I first started. I decided to do yoga because I figured it’s not too much for my body to handle unlike workouts. At first, I was hesitant in certain shapes or if I should do this before that, but somehow, Adrienne’s voice just echoes in my head, tells me what to do and encourages me to keep going. After the session, I cried when I saw the quote at the end. At first, I didn’t know why I cried, but when I reread the quote, it really struck me. For this year, I really do strive for growth, for a better me, for a healthier mentality. As I cried, I kept muttering to myself, “I finished the 30 days” and “I’m so proud of myself”. Actually as I write this, I’m still crying T_T I easily give up on certain things when I know that I can’t keep up, but completing 30 days was a huge accomplishment for me today. Thank you so much Adrienne for being there and knowing that I’m not alone with my struggles. I look forward to yoga everyday and I want to keep it that way for a long time :&gt;",Nina Maria Isabel Triño,2021-02-09T14:23:50Z,0
"I really enjoyed this series, but struggled with the silent approach with the final class. I really appreciate the intention, but  felt I was taken out of my flow by having to continually look at the screen to see where we were going. I did end up doing my own thing. I have done something similar in a class in a studio and it worked better because you felt the energy of those around you, but not the same in the virtual world.",Diana Murphy,2021-02-09T13:08:41Z,0

"wow, that was truly incredible, there were a couple of points when i looked at the screen and i was totally in sync with what you were doing, the rest of the time i had my eyes closed. I definitely cried, because i felt the love, i was holding myself and i felt held by you. I found myself saying &quot;thank you&quot; a lot in my head to myself, thanking myself for having taken care of myself my whole life, surviving everything. It took me a while to get through this journey, i even went back and started from the beginning when i moved into my new home in November. Part of me moving and living a lone was to be able to rest and heal and return home to myself. Doing this yoga journey has been a major part in that.

(yay me) I didnt forget the tools like what Adriene said in the intro and i was able to follow hee lead and was even surprised that i knew what&#39;s next even without verbal cues! <br /><br /><br />Background: i didn&#39;t like yoga at first because i&#39;m the hardcore type and was a cheerleader/athelete a few years back. I tried yoga from free gym classes but i just didnt get it. But because of the pandemic i needed a mindful exercise to holistically lead me into the right mentality; and thankfully i found Adriene&#39;s channel. It&#39;s so beginner friendly and she&#39;s not just about the trend.. she made me appreciate the ESSENCE of Yoga and not the face value of being a &quot;yogi&quot;. I get it. Thanks to you, Adriene.  This 30 day video made me almost cry; i could tell by your stares that u were &quot;proud of me&quot; like u were actually talking to me. does that make sense.

"As someone with anxiety and a sore neck to boot, I found this particular practice to be the most frustrating.  Without verbal instructions, I had to constantly be looking at the screen in order to know what to do, straining my neck, anxious about what was coming next, etc.  Unless you have a screen at your front, left, right and on the ceiling, you&#39;re SOL.  Not relaxing for me.  Yikes.",Mary Jordheim,2021-01-24T15:31:45Z,0

"One of my goals for 2021 was to &#39;get into yoga&#39;. I missed a few days here and there when I began this 30-day journey, but when 2021 hit I haven&#39;t missed a day. Now my goal is to make it this whole year doing yoga daily. The reason I started yoga was that I wanted to fix some muscle tightness/pains from working out and not stretching correctly for the major part of my gym career. I didn&#39;t expect there would be such a healthy mental improvement from doing yoga as well. The deep breathing, mindful movements, and really just Adriene&#39;s positive dialogue throughout the 30 days have really helped my mindset and way of thinking. Anyways, looking forward to more yoga, more growth, and getting a lot more use out of the yoga mat my sister got me for Christmas!<br /><br />Thank you for these videos, they help in so many ways",SpennyStable,2021-01-15T03:57:14Z,0

"My name is Danielle and I am practicing from Cape Town, South Africa. Thank you so much for the gift of &quot;HOME&quot;. It came to me at a time where I needed to practice discipline but still be gentle with myself. It has opened me to the strength I have within and the knowledge that I AM CAPABLE. You are a blessing. &quot;HOME&quot; has inspired a new confidence within me and has helped me on my journey home. I will be starting BREATH tomorrow which I am highly excited for! I appreciate you Adriene. Love, Danielle.",Danielle Gympies,2021-01-13T12:17:55Z,0
So I have finished home for the 2nd time but I find it hard to focus without your guiding voice!  I am now going to do Breath 30 day yoga journey! Thanks Adriene for your inspiration! Namaste!,Sarah Taylor,2021-01-12T19:42:10Z,0
Adriene - this was my first Yoga experience and I am so grateful for what I have learned.  I feel so happy on day 30 and watching you go through a history of all the moves...flowing like water...reminded me that I could too.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us - it has helped my body and mind hugely during this pandemic!  I cant wait to move to BREATH another 30 day journey.  Someone said below they felt verklempt after todays practice...I know what they mean :-) <br />Thanks Adriene and everyone else in this yoga community!,David Cronin,2021-01-11T19:45:20Z,1
"I loved the 30 day program (as always), but the last one without voice is very stressful :/ Normally barely look at the much and concentrate on my practice (I’m doing yoga since...forever). Know I had to look every few seconds what’s up next (ok sometimes it’s obvious) and even got a little sick from looking at the screen in positions were my head was below my heart (sensitive PMS stomach, tbh). Next time I‘ll probably skip day 30, doesn‘t feel good ;) <br /><br />(Of course I could just do my own yoga session, probably that’s what I‘ll do next time for day 30, with music I‘ve chosen. But that wasn’t the idea of day 30, was it?)",Sara Loersch,2021-01-10T22:10:56Z,0
"I came across this day 30 session when I was doing the longer videos by Adriene. Realized then I wasn&#39;t ready for silent yoga. Then I began this 30 day journey and now find myself at the end. I am flored by how much more confident I feel in doing 40 mins of yoga without verbal instruction. I still looked at Adriene very frequently, yet I felt well prepared. <br />Adriene you are a fantastic human being. I am so grateful to have found  you. Making yoga a daily practice for me is now so much more a reality after working through these 30 days.  I did skip 3 days, so I&#39;m going to do your other 30 day series and keep it going. Thank you for helping me work through this challenge. Your videos breath joy, silliness, gentleness, and strength into my world. I truly appreciate you.",Hannah Weldon,2021-01-10T02:52:22Z,1
"I missed your sweet voice today . This was my second 30 day practice  since I found you and started yoga. I have also just finished my first week of breath and I know that I couldn&#39;t do this alone , so I&#39;m glad  you will still be here for me. And yes WE DID IT! Thank You Adriene for being here for us  and I will see you tomorrow on Day 9 of Breath.😍",VLM,2021-01-09T20:54:53Z,0
"I&#39;m so excited to have completed my second 30 day &quot;Yoga With Adriene&quot; program! I was a little nervous to not have her guiding voice in the last class, but it was awesome!  I felt like a kid having Adriene holding onto the back of my bike seat as we started down the road, then before you know it she had let go and I was riding all on my own. It was so freeing to just play and do my favorite poses and flows that I had learned. I was &quot;finding what feels good&quot; all on my own! She even finished before I was done. Thanks for another beautiful 30 days!",Laura Mulligan,2021-01-09T18:26:10Z,0
Anyone got a suggestion of what to do after completing day 30? I would like to stick with Adrienne. If anyone has a suggestion of what is a good batch of sessions to do next let me know. I’m a novice,Jeff Fallon,2021-01-09T17:23:41Z,1

I got emotional and cried a little bit when I heard the music of the pyramide at the end, I’m so proud of myself that I committed and showed up every  day to the practice of this 30 Day Journey!

"What a journey it has been! Every moment of practice taught me something new or rekindled my faith to keep going. I love how far we&#39;ve come together and I say &quot;together&quot; because when I started Journey, I felt isolated as if it were just me following the practice. When I checked the comment section, I was happy to find others sharing their thoughts and experience of the session. I felt relieved knowing there are other people actively engaged in this journey and each session motivated me to relax, take things easy and do my best. Adriene, you are a star. Thank you for your time and dedication to these videos. I actually completed Day 30 in post-quarantine where I am but I&#39;m thankful I made it until the end. I&#39;m looking forward to our next journey. 💙",Naynika G,2021-01-02T10:56:52Z,1

"To be completely honest, I really didn’t like this practice most of the time because I really like verbal cues and I was frustrated not having them but when we stood with our hands on our hips almost 30 minutes in, the music and the pose got to me and I started crying. I struggled to continue this journey multiple times but it finally hit me I was at the end. I actually did it. I’m really proud of myself for completing this journey, especially with all of the bumps I faced along the way.  I did it. We did it. And I couldn’t be prouder. ❤️",Aleyna N,2021-01-02T02:39:41Z,1

"I remember I did this practice on November 3rd. That was me finishing my 6th month of yoga and my first half year of it. I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed it. I was better physically, mentally, and emotionally. I let myself go freely using you as a guide occasionally when I did this practice, I was very happy with it. After that, I was waiting for the next 2021 yoga to come out so to compensate, I would pick a video of your channel that I thought fit the day or one I needed. If I was tired, I could choose a 15 minute calming yoga practice, and If I had the time and energy, I could choose a fiery 30 minute practice. Now, my yoga journey has transcended the year and I will be starting it with Breath, which comes out tomorrow. Although I liked the freedom of the choosing what yoga to do everyday, I am also excited to be back on another 30 day yoga journey. To keep up with every day, I will try this practice without breaks this time, as usually I have a day off every week meaning that a 30 day yoga journey takes me around 34 days. I am so excited to start another yoga journey and it&#39;s all because of this practice and the ones before.<br>Thank you so much Adriene for gifting us these practices.<br>Happy New Year, and Namaste",Arturo Merediz Thomassiny,2021-01-01T05:27:43Z,0
"Well, it legit took me 365 days, but I did it! When I started, I could plunk my son down on the floor next to me and he would crawl around a little while I did yoga. Then he figured out how to crawl faster... and then walk and talk and say “yoga! No!” Which is why I finished Home at 9pm on New Year’s Eve. Cheers to everyone else who took the long road home!",neffsnicker,2021-01-01T02:12:41Z,16

"Wow, just wow. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that I came upon this YouTube channel toward the end of 2020 in what has been a particularly difficult year for everyone on the planet. And it’s no coincidence either that I just finished these 30 days of coming Home on December 31, 2020. Words can’t really express what I just experienced in this yoga session. I’ve done a ton of bodywork and mindfulness practice during my lifetime but something supernatural took over me in this last no-mic session. Hard to type and dictate right now with tears in my eyes, but I was really moved by this. And I was finally able to do a full plank to the mat on Day 30...and burst out crying. Adriene, what you provide here is such a gift beyond measure, especially when so many people are alone, isolated, and struggling right now. I am so proud of myself for showing up every day for 30 days, and I can’t wait for Breath to begin soon. Thank you, namaste, from the bottom of my heart. So grateful to have this community.

"I finally completed this journey Home today, after three attempts in 2020, just in time to start the 2021 30 days! I never thought that I would be able to know what to do during those 40 minutes, but as I tried to find my own way, many of the times I peeked at you I saw that we were having more or less the same idea at the same time. What a great way to help us find our autonomy in the practice. And starting it all over next month, with joy and pride! See you tomorrow Adriene and Benji!",celeluwhen,2020-12-31T14:50:58Z,5

I did this HOME journey back in April, as we went into lockdown, and today I came back to this video looking for something quiet for my final yoga of 2020.

"This was both my most and least favourite session of Home. <br><br>I LOVED knowing when to breathe, what positions to do, and how to do them. Also the tender moments between Adriene and Benji were 🥰<br><br>I did not love craning my neck to look at the TV. Maybe I need to adjust my mat position.<br><br>However, right at the end, when I raised my hands to my third eye, I cried and cried. I&#39;m not much of a crier, but the feeling of accomplishment as well as knowing Adriene is always there with me, it got me.<br><br>God I&#39;m a bit of a wreck now. But in a good way.

"This was the first big obstacle I completed in my yoga journey that started just a few short months ago. Since I decided to participate in this month long practice in December, reflection and the new year is on everyone’s minds. About 15 minutes into the practice I started crying for what I figured was no reason. I stood up and I looked in the mirror right beside me and I said to myself “you did it”. Now that phrase is what broke me. I started to bawl uncontrollably, but I think it was a bittersweet moment. I was proud of myself for all I had achieved in terms of self care and growing to love myself in 2020, but I was also crying a years worth of tears of a young girl who seemed to be watching the world burn. Adrienne, thank you for giving me this space that was away from the troubles of the world, and thank you for helping me to realize my true strength as not only a yogi but as a human. Here’s to a brighter 2021, and to finding what feels good tomorrow.",Emma Long,2020-12-30T16:25:24Z,2

"hello adriene! ♡<br><br>i started this journey, with you, one month ago. i did take 2 days off somewhere in between, but i continued and finally, i reached the finish line! since day 1, i&#39;ve been carrying the same thought in my mind, to breathe and to believe that i will come out of this with something worthwhile. it felt like i had a purpose from the very start to the very end..<br><br>in day 8, heal, i cried so hard because i felt emotions i never thought i had. hell, i&#39;m beginning to tear up as i&#39;m typing this. i know the embarrassment will hit me as soon as i hit the &quot;comment&quot; button but i don&#39;t care. i have a strong urge to tell you this, like i owe it to you for your amazing guidance.<br><br>thanks to you, i discovered the beautiful world of yoga last month, on november 6, so i&#39;m still a novice. every day i feel like i&#39;m getting closer to becoming the person i deserve to be. your air and warmth made it feel like i&#39;ve known this place for the longest time.<br><br>i&#39;m so happy you found me, thank you so much.<br><br>all the love,<br>njoud",njoud al,2020-12-29T20:07:58Z,1

But due my line of work (i am a programmer) office life and old injuries got to me and mostly my lower back. This resulted to me experiencing weird pains in my hip and having trouble in everyday life. Since i started watching and doing your videos i lost about 20 pounds and i feel brand as new. Congratulations on your channel and keep up the good work!!! Regards from Greece!",γιαννης τζουμας,2020-12-29T19:56:45Z,1
The last day is always my least favorite because I get too into my head over what poses to do... But I think that is also what makes it so necessary because it teaches you to feel what comes next instead of getting in your head about it. Finally completed 30 days straight of yoga and I&#39;m so happy to have found someone like Adriene to guide me! It&#39;s been awesome doing this with all of you!,Freex Necroanim,2020-12-29T04:03:00Z,5
"I was moved to leave a message here among the rest of you. Yes, tears...just flowing at the end. I used this yoga practice in and around my usual workouts. And I find myself, today, completing Day 30. This journey has taken me through these days of lockdown and difficulty. It has been a bright light through it all. Benji, your sweet, quiet entrances and exits. Thank you for finishing with us. Taking us to the end. I love you.

"So I started this in January, and never finished. And this month in December I decided to finish it. Today was the last day, and it’s almost as if I was always meant to end this year with this series. About 10 min in, the weight of this year and the gratitude for making it through this year all hit me, and I just sat on my mat and started bawling. I said all the things I was grateful for, set new year intentions, and sent love &amp; light to everyone that suffered this year. It was a magical experience, and I wouldn’t have felt this weight lifted off my shoulders had it not been for this channel. I smiled the rest of the way through. Thank you so much Adriene! You are an angel! 🤍🧘🏻‍♀️",Amber Michele,2020-12-28T17:57:19Z,46
"Same here! As a joke, I told myself in January that I would finish HOME no matter what even if it was in December. Turns out joke&#39;s on me because I only made it half way through then but I picked it back up recently just in time to finish today. I agree that it ended up being perfect to start and end 2020 with Adriene and this series. Now I&#39;m looking forward to BREATH to quick off 2021 :)",Fadia Ticona,2020-12-31T07:14:40Z,3

"Tonight is Christmas Eve, and a hard one for me. For all of us on a collective level, but for me on a personal level entirely separately. So there&#39;s a lot. I almost didn&#39;t show up today. I wanted to do one of your old practices instead. I thought I had to wait until I was strong enough. I felt frustrated, because your guidance has been one of the only things I have been able to truly trust, to count on, and not feel so alone, because someone is there to catch me. But I showed up today, with all my anxiety and grief, I showed up. Something told me to show up, I heard it above my uncertainty and fear. I showed up. Feeling alone on Christmas Eve in a pandemic, where nothing looks the same. Not even yoga looked the same today. But here&#39;s the message that I found, or that found me. &quot;Even when things look different, the good parts are just the same.&quot;. Love will always catch my fall. Love will always show up. It could never be absent. It is everything. So in a period of transition and grief, that&#39;s what I can count on. And so between fearful thoughts, I began to embrace &quot;different&quot;. I began to praise &quot;different&quot;. And see it as a blessing. As my Rebirth. No, this doesn&#39;t feel the same. And it is because of the beautiful healing journey I&#39;ve been on. But the Love is still here just the same. So I&#39;m letting go. Letting go of what I thought it was supposed to look like. Because here was a surprise, something totally new. And it was a beautiful one. Home is inside of me. So I can never be lost. Support and guidance and Love are right here. In me. Home. <br><br>Namaste, Adriene. Namaste to anyone who may read this. This practice made me cry. And the quote at the end was exactly what I needed right now. Here I am. Beginning again. After my trauma. Here I am. Reborn. Home. <br><br>Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Adriene. I love you.",Kat Abrams,2020-12-25T02:02:26Z,1
"Can&#39;t believe I did it! Can&#39;t believe how excited I am for the new 30-day series coming in 2021! I was never able to commit to daily yoga in the past, but I got an apartment on my own a few months back, and being alone so often made me realize how much I needed something like this as a way of taking care of / checking in with myself.<br><br>I was really nervous for this last video since there are no verbal cues. It was definitely challenging, but it also resulted in some really cool moments. Like many others have said in comments, I kept hearing Adriene&#39;s voice in my head. When we did star pose, I heard &quot;take up space&quot; and I smiled and started to tear up. The realization that I am HERE and I am ALIVE just hit me so strongly. And then when we were in plank pose and did the thing where we touch our hips to the ground, I remembered to whisper to myself, &quot;I am strong.&quot;<br><br>I just want to say thanks to Adriene and thanks to all of you! It&#39;s amazing that, even though we&#39;re all in different places, we are all on this yoga journey together. Namaste.",Katherine Larsen,2020-12-24T14:15:37Z,0

I said to myself: ah you taught me well.<br>also many times to myself I was saying things like...<br>Lots of love in, lots of love out. do what feels right. lost warrior pose, and many more.<br>when I layed down and after one more deep breath, I put my thumbs to my third eye and said out loud Namaste.<br>i slowly got up and the quote just started. whithout knowing it we said namaste together. <br>even though i did it myself i still felt the connection.<br>Thank you for teaching me how to bring peach to myself!",Jeske vd M,2020-12-23T23:44:35Z,0
"Just finished this incredible journey. Thank you Adriene. Things have been tough for everyone this year with so much uncertainty and so much pain, so much loss. To come to practice virtually everyday - it’s been my little ray of sunshine, to step on the mat everyday, knowing it’s a safe space &amp; I can simply be.

You really helped me come back into my body and love and accept myself more! I looked forward to our practice every night and i even started needing it to calm me down and give me comfort. I used this commitment to build more self trust and it certainly helped!

"WOw, I made it! This was my first practice without direct guidance and I think I did an okay job at finding what felt good. I started this journey right at the end of the year, instead at the beginning. I stretched it out through november and december and today I finished. I think I learned a lot about the practice and the peace it can bring (despite the constant construction noise from the neighbours). Adriene, you kindly guided me through our second lockdown in Germany and showed me the way home before I will finally be visiting my family next week for the holidays. It has been a crazy year, but a journey home right at the end of it really got me grounded and refreshed for a new start. See you all next year!",Anni Sofortstart,2020-12-19T13:59:14Z,0

Since then - as of today - I completed all of your 30 day challenges and I&#39;m so glad and grateful that I did, because it has helped me so much to stabilize physically and mentally. Doing yoga has become an essential morning routine for me!<br>Although the 30th day was always a challenge for me and still is in some way, today was the first time I didn&#39;t think &quot;What am I going to do next?&quot; the whole time. So thank you, for giving me the tools, for teaching me so much about caring for my inner self and for providing all this amazing, free yoga content. <br><br>Can&#39;t wait for BREATH in 2021! <br>Until then I&#39;ll be honoring the second half of December... ;)",Lucy,2020-12-18T09:48:55Z,0

"Adrienne I hope you read this. I’ve followed you since early 2015 and I absolutely love your teaching style and the tools that I’ve gained by listening to you. Ive never left a comment but always look forward to what you are going to bring to the table. Recently I did 29 days of the home journey and I loved every part of it. Through the home journey I found a new appreciation for commitment that’s rooted in flexibility. Today I went to finish the last day and after a few minutes of having to look up and try to figure out where I lost track of what the next move was I just decided to replace the practice with something that I could hear. For me it’s hard to really get into all of the things that make a home practice juicy when I can’t tell where each posture will lead. Once we started in downward dog I couldn’t turn my neck to properly see you and it didn’t feel good. I want you to know that I really appreciate the way that you lead people with your voice. Your classes are detail oriented and I really can just zen out and know how to articulate my body to work toward what feels good. I’m sure that some people really loved getting the opportunity during class to speculate and find what feels good for them, but I felt mostly distracted and I just felt like maybe I could offer you that perspective. I really am grateful for your online yoga platform and use the tools i learn in class constantly on and off the mat, I hope you can feel that appreciation and understand that this isn’t meant to be overly critical.",Just J,2020-12-17T16:16:46Z,0

"Could not help but getting the goosebumps and my eyes fill with tears at the end of this practice, the little music from the beginning of each practice touched my heart when it appeared towards the end of this one. 30 days of defeating my sedentary inflexible self every day after work(home office), no matter what my energy level was. Committed to this new challenge for myself. Thank you Adrienne, I could hear your voice in my head in every pose. It was very satisfying to peek to take you as reference and find myself in the exact same pose, regardless of the JOURNEY that brought us to that specific one.

Thank you so much for showing us the path, guiding us, grounding us, not just with your videos, but with your little and calm voice in our heads even off the mat.

"That was so hard. I feel like I completely lost the confidence I built in myself over the last 29 days. I couldn&#39;t make it through 10 minutes. I came back to it and powered through, but I didn&#39;t enjoy it. The quote at the end was a bit of salt in the wound, because this last session has completely destabilized me and made me question whether I want to continute doing yoga. I discovered Adriene&#39;s channel because of pain I was having in my neck and shoulders. I found relief over the last month, but from straining to look at the screen during this last session, I have that pain returning. I feel like we all spent 29 days building a vocabulary only to have it all silenced in the final stretch.",Natalie Clement,2020-12-08T07:32:49Z,0

"I almost didn’t do it. I thought « I can’t do it alone, i’m not there yet, i’ll just try another video. »<br>But i stayed, tried to simply trust the process, one pose at a time. And this might’ve been my favorite day ! The fact that i wasn’t guided even helped me to be extra intentional with my breath. I just played with what my body and mind could do, and it wasn’t as terrifying as i thought it would be. I tripped sometimes, smiled a lot, breathed, welcomed that fire, peeked at you kissing Benji... for 40 minutes ! Thank you Adrienne. I didn’t know i could trust my body like that. It wasn’t perfect, and i loved every bit of this.",Estelle Martorano,2020-12-06T07:48:34Z,0
"I pushed off doing this very last practice for months after finishing the other 29 days of Home. I knew I wanted to finish the 30 days at some point, but the idea of a self-guided 40 minute practice was incredibly daunting and so I kept choosing guided practices in favor of finishing the challenge. Maybe it was the Holiday spirit, but I finally did this practice and am so grateful for it. Thank you Adriene, despite having never met me in person, for giving me the tools and vocabulary to guide myself through a yoga practice - so much so that sometimes I would take a peek at the screen after doing my own thing and we were in the same move! Whenever I would lose focus or flow, I could remind myself that I could just meet you in downward dog and the 40 minutes felt much less intimidating.

"Thank you so much for this journey Adriene ❤️<br />I started it a few months ago when I felt overwhelmed with everything going on in my life and stopped halfway. In November, I decided to be a better version of myself. Home allowed me a daily meeting with myself, and you - and I loved it so, so much, I can&#39;t thank you enough. I cried out of frustration or out of happiness on some days, sweated on others and meditated when I needed it the most. I learned to be kind to myself and listen to my body. This day was harder because I had more freedom with my movements which was both scary and exciting at the same time, but I loved knowing I could watch you whenever I felt like I needed help. <br />Thank you again for this fabulous month!

"Filled with so much grace and gratitude at this moment. Today was simply divine!!! Thank you so much Adriene for these past 30 days. A journey home it has been.<br /><br />In this session today I also had moved through different emotions as someone else mentioned and I had a real A-HA moment when in boat pose... For years I lacked the strength and confidence to do it properly, as I could never do it without intense cramping in my hip flexors or without putting pressure on my sciatic nerve. I believed I was a lost cause because it was always so uncomfortable/painful, I just thought &quot;it&#39;s not for me&quot;... But with this daily practice, I am now able to do a modified version with much less discomfort in my hip flexors. I can&#39;t do it &quot;perfectly&quot; but I&#39;m okay with knowing that I&#39;m making progress and it feels amazing. ♥︎ I feel so much stronger than 30 days ago. When it feels like I&#39;ve gone too far, I step back a little.

Yes I peeked to see what Adriene was doing from time to time, but I already had in mind my next move, so I let what she was doing go, and continued with what I was doing.    I did my best tree poses ever, and even attempted crow pose.  I got one foot off the ground and then fell on my face when I tried to lift the second foot.  I took a second to laugh regroup, but got right back into it.  <br /><br />Thank you Adriene for making me so much stronger.

Happy to have completed my 2nd 30 days of Yoga with Adriene. Both of which took me months to complete with a busy schedule and bad excuses but it&#39;s all about the journey and not judging how long it takes. This has helped me significantly with the daily headaches I&#39;ve had. This has been part of my repertoire for them to happen less often and less severely than before.,Ross,2020-11-26T16:02:58Z,0
"Just finished this series - my first one with Adriene, what an amazing experience! totally had a little cry on my mat towards the end :) so proud of myself for committing to something for 30 days and completing day 30 feeling great!

"I must admit, I’m not the yoga type. I’m more of go hard as fast as you can type of person, especially with my workouts. Until one day when everything in my life changed in a split of a moment. Out of the blue, I ended up with an ovarian torsion which lead to an emergency surgery to take it out. The emotional, hormonal and physical turmoil lead me to the worst place in my entire life. Since I was operated on my abdomen, I lost all of my core strength. The recovery was and still is ongoing, very long. I found myself so tense and clenched up from pain and anger that I decided I needed help with some stretching. I found Adriene’s video and really liked it. Then saw the Home collection and decided to commit myself to daily yoga for a month just to see what would happen.  I have to say, IM COMPLETELY BLOW AWAY!!! As I was doing this practice, I was soooo overwhelmed with emotion because I was seeing the glimpses of my old self again. Strong, able to move and most of all free from pain. My recovery isn’t over yet but I’m MOST certain that I’m much farther along than I would have been. From the bottom of my heart, I’m forever grateful💕 <br />P.S. I’m not a pet person but Benji made me smile every time he appeared, especially during this practice. 🥰",Katie B,2020-11-26T03:16:55Z,0

"It&#39;s been 8 months now since I heard that my job was shutting down and I would be laid off due to the pandemic and subsequent lockdown. I can still taste the fear and anxiety that took over in the wake of such uncertainty, but then also the sense of resolution and surrender that had to follow in its wake. It is in those feelings that I received a message from a friend who I&#39;d lost touch with over time. It was an invitation to do 30 Days of Yoga, the first 30 day journey that this channel embarked on. In the interest of staying grounded and creating stronger routines to manage my mental health, I accepted my friend&#39;s invitation.<br />     At first I told myself, &quot;Just finish one solid week.&quot; At the end of that week I felt more confident, and so I told myself to just finish one more week. After that it was smooth sailing to the end of that first series, and I cannot tell you how proud and accomplished I felt at the end of that time. I&#39;m someone that struggles with consistent routine, and discipline has always been a weak point. When the idea first came into my mind that I might continue on and try to complete every available 30 day journey in sequence, I dismissed it immediately. &quot;I could never&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll give up&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll surely fail along the way&quot;<br />     What slowly disintegrated those thoughts was the love for, and patience with my body that I&#39;d been cultivating over those first 30 days... and so I continued on. I told myself, &quot;just one more sequence&quot;, &quot;just one more day&quot;. I created a journal to slowly check off each practice as I completed it, and over time something changed. 30 Days of Yoga, Yoga Camp, Revolution, True, Dedicate, and finally Home... This has been such a profound and beautiful journey, and I&#39;ve uncovered so much on my way inward. It&#39;s a blessing to have observed Adriene grow and blossom into such an amazing teacher and friend, to see and experience the maturity and wisdom settle into her body and spirit... And it&#39;s a blessing that this same maturity and wisdom has taken root in me too.<br />     In this time I&#39;ve revealed to myself a sense of self-belief. I&#39;ve learned to trust in myself and my intuition. I&#39;ve seen how diligent, disciplined, and honest I can be. I&#39;ve laughed, and cried, and screamed... I&#39;ve become more patient, kinder to my body, and awakened more love and gratitude for it. I&#39;ve demonstrated to myself that I can achieve anything simply by taking one step. So much has changed over these months and the landscape of the world around us looks so very different. That same sense of resolution and surrender that first drew me to you all that time ago is still necessary, still vital... But I am capable and strong. Thank you for the beautiful gift of your time and friendship. Thank you for holding space with me on my mat, and for being there in a time when so many of us needed you most. The YWA Team and community is such a truly profound and meaningful thing.<br />     Moving forward I&#39;m going to continue on a special journey of my own making. I&#39;ve patiently marked all of my favorite practices over the last 8 months. Every practice that moved me, the ones that made me feel so joyful and alive, and the ones that challenged me. I can&#39;t wait to see you at the dawn of the new year. From the bottom of my heart I extend my deepest gratitude to you... Namaste",Henry,2020-11-22T17:18:39Z,0

"I just wanted to say thank you! I&#39;ve been working on developing a home practice for the last couple years, but only really committed to myself and what I deserve in the last couple of months. It took me a bit over 30 days to complete this, but I am so proud of myself and thankful to you, Adriene, for helping guide me!

"Thank you Adriene! Coming into this practice, I had the objective of losing weight. But what I got was so much more: space. A time for myself, to step back from the chaos of everyday life and find peace. Through this practice, I was able to realize a lot of things about my life and if before, I would’ve been hard on myself, now, I was able to look kindly at these realizations and on myself.

Most importantly, you brought a much-needed calm and focus to my days. It was all I could do to get ~20min a day to do this while at home 24/7 two young kids. Often they were on the mat with me or talking over you- but your message and the consistency of this practice still got through. These times are challenging, to say the least, and you provided something invaluable to help me push through.

I have never experienced yoga like yours with its easy and smooth richness keeping in your movements mindfulness and awareness of breath and body. Aslo, for your attention to detail in naming the individual yoga classes which made me feel determined to concentrate on that very said word while I worked through the moves. You have been a brilliant instructor and have given me confidence to join you every day on the mat with your fabulous and spirited friend and companion Benjy, who I must say is very handsome and loving friend to you. I wish I had a dog friend just like him.  Thank you again Adriene for your motivation, encouragement and commitment in your classes.

I got through the other Day 30s, but this one seemed different.  Maybe I’ll cycle through again after repeating the others and try again.

"I did it! I had done a couple of the 30 days years ago in undergrad, before I was a mom. I&#39;m a totally different person now and barely have time to think about what I need most days. Doing this really did bring me back to myself...it took waiting until after my son was asleep every night to do it, but it became the only time in the day when I could think about my needs...like breathing deeply for example. Seriously...I had not taken a deep breath since I gave birth a year and a half ago 😲 then here I am on the last day breathing deeply while doing boat pose like it&#39;s no big deal when I could barely do one in the beginning while holding my breath💪🏾 I also kept reminding myself to relax my shoulders, wiggle my fingers and open up a little more the whole way through with a level of self awareness I had not afforded myself for a long time.

There are still lots of bits of it that my body won&#39;t do for me because I&#39;m not strong/flexible enough, but never once did I feel like a fool or a failure. This last session was <b>such</b> a treat - I couldn&#39;t believe that I&#39;d be able to do a full session like this with no verbal cues, but found myself naturally doing what Adriene was doing because of her amazing teaching up to now.

"Thank you Adriene for offering a journey &quot;HOME&quot;! I hesitantly started this yoga journey on the advice of my daughter because she had completed the 30 days as well. I say hesitantly, because I was unsure that I could commit to 30 days and I lacked the faith that I could do the movements. Well, here I am, 30 days later, and I have so much more energy, a clearer mind and a stronger body. This at home practice enables a newbie to make mistakes, laugh at oneself and best of all challenge oneself. The 30 day program may have ended but the yoga journey is just beginning!  Looking forward to checking out the monthly calendars and feeling good! My sincerest thanks. Noreen",Noreen O’Sullivan,2020-10-16T01:03:11Z,0

Adriene from  a 61 year old psychic medium and for many years a boxing trainer and internal trainer - I put it out into the universal network of energy and found you. I had seen your posts of yoga on and off however when I was brought to your 30 day journey of yoga (and all the others as I chose to do 2 to 3 a day...) I feel so strong and utterly incredible. My soul bows to you and Benji as I sit in Sri Lanka guided each day by your divine presence. Yes I cried on this last day....but it is not!! and I will continue this pathway that you opened up for me and thank you so much from the bottom of my heart and soul. Shine on as you radiate for so many upon this planet. THANK YOU X,Nita Taylor,2020-10-12T14:19:26Z,1
"Wow! just finished this 30 day journey and even though this is my very first time doing yoga, adriene is such a great teacher. I did lots of different kinds of exercises and i pushed myself above my limits, hurted myself in the process. And turns out yoga was exactly what i was needed! Adriene&#39;s little comments in the videos such as &#39;&#39;dont worry if u cant go all the way, if u cant do this its totally fine&#39;&#39; really helped me. Even though i cant quite do the poses i felt like i&#39;ve accomplished something. I started to laugh at my mistakes. When i felt that i couldnt practise that day, i didnt felt like i was disappointing myself. Yoga&#39;s relative slow flow made me more aware of my body and  how i did the poses started to matter to me. I found your foundations series very helpful!  So thank you so much adriene :)  I hope happines finds  you wherever you are &lt;3",miyaw **,2020-10-12T11:12:03Z,1

My mother recovering from a serious bicycle accident, my company closing office putting me out of work in the middle of a pandemic, my loving grandmother&#39;s death. I so appreciated spending the time receiving love and heartfelt admiration from Adriene, which really did feel like she was speaking to me personally so often. Not just as an instructor but as a friend. I am so grateful for the love and admiration through yoga and I&#39;ve learned to practice putting that same energy out into the world. I may have shown up to the matt crying at times, but I persevered and felt uplifted every day. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!

"In out-of-the-way places of the heart,<br />Where your thoughts never think to wander,<br />This beginning has been quietly forming,<br />Waiting until you were ready to emerge.<br /><br />For a long time it has watched your desire,<br />Feeling the emptiness growing inside you,<br />Noticing how you willed yourself on,<br />Still unable to leave what you had outgrown.<br /><br />It watched you play with the seduction of safety<br />And the gray promises that sameness whispered,<br />Heard the waves of turmoil rise and relent,<br />Wondered would you always live like this.<br /><br />Then the delight, when your courage kindled,<br />And out you stepped onto new ground,<br />Your eyes young again with energy and dream,<br />A path of plenitude opening before you.<br /><br />Though your destination is not yet clear<br />You can trust the promise of this opening;<br />Unfurl yourself into the grace of beginning<br />That is at one with your life&#39;s desire.<br /><br />Awaken your spirit to adventure;<br />Hold nothing back, learn to find ease in risk;<br />Soon you will home in a new rhythm,<br />For your soul senses the world that awaits you.<br /><br />John O&#39;Donohue, For a new beginning<br /><br />- A beautiful end to a beautiful journey Adrianne, thank you. -",ladida,2020-10-07T10:20:27Z,0

"This was the horrible way to end an amazing 29 first days of amazing yoga. I hated this last day as I couldn&#39;t relax because i was constantly trying to watch and follow along. Maybe you should just make it a suggestion that people turn the audio off, since reading through the comments it&#39;s clear many people didnt enjoy this, or come here for this kind of yoga. I am disappointed.",Nadine Kopp,2020-10-02T01:10:26Z,0
I agree with Dee&#39;s thoughts. There were times it was difficult to see the screen so I just went with how felt right to move and then joined in again once I could see the screen again 😄<br /><br />There is no right or wrong or have to in Adriene&#39;s style of guiding. Trust in yourself and relax into the practice 🙂🙏🏼,Will Goacher,2020-10-04T07:55:33Z,0
"I felt the same way the first time I did True, I felt like I couldn&#39;t relax while having to keep watching the screen. After doing the rest of her 30 day programs, I love the 30th day now, it feels like a graduation! I think what Adriene is trying to teach is that you know the poses after doing them for 29 days, so trust yourself and go it alone on this day and see how it goes, see how your body wants to move, and essentially &#39;find what feels good&#39;. It&#39;s a tough challenge, but an important one.",Dee O' Leary,2020-10-02T07:18:11Z,2

And it won&#39;t stop here, I intend to keep going! <br />I am sad this 30 days is over, but my yoga journey is not over! It&#39;s only just begun. Adriene has become such a great voice and energy to have when I practise, and Benji also, it feels like they are there with me. Today was hard, I&#39;m going through a bit of rough time, and it was hard to know what poses to do in what order, but then I would just stop and watch Adriene and remember all she said about listening to yourself and then I would find a way back. <br />Thank you so much Adriene for creating this channel.",Amy Rushent,2020-09-25T10:35:52Z,0

"I&#39;m so proud of myself for doing a 30 day challenge but this is my first experience of day 30 and honestly I found the lack of audio instruction a big barrier to accessibility. I understand that it&#39;s a style choice but an audio described option would have been incredible. I know the whole point is that I could have done it without watching but I felt so frustrated by 30 minutes in as I was craning my neck. <br /><br />Thanks so much for this life saving content, in general it has been amazing but please consider people who do not want to or are simply unable to rely on their vision to experience let alone enjoy day 30.  &lt;3 anyway I am going to start my next 30 day challenge tomorrow.

"As an introvert, I am not the kind of girl commenting publically on videos in YT!! 😅but for this one, I need to express myself in public :D <br />Hello dear Adriene, I hope you&#39;ll read this! I have been practising yoga for 2 years now, on my own and in a studio. I was recommended to start this challenge by a friend of mine so I gave it a try since I am at home most of the times! And what a journey it was!! I am fully satisfied, your way of &quot;guiding&quot; us as you say is way fantastic!! I love the way you care about us, the way you give us space for flexibility, freestyling, for feeling and being comfortable in our own bodies. I finished today practice smoothly and felt a lot of stress came out, however, in the end, with you disappearing from the screen, my tears came out and I felt already missing your kind voice. You became one of my family members that I spend valuable time with every day!!<br />Thank you for this wonderful journey to Home, and I am looking forward to seeing you again in a new challenge!!<br /><br />Take good care of yourself, and of the lovely Benji ^^❤️",Amarun Nozomi,2020-09-18T20:09:13Z,1

"I appreciate the sentiment of an unguided yoga practice for day thirty but I left the mat feeling very anxious and frustrated to the point of ending early because I felt the need to keep craining to look at my tv every 5-10 seconds to make sure I’m on pace or doing the right positions. I assume from other comments people were able to memorize the flow but I wasn’t there. I felt compelled to either keep looking incessantly to keep up with the video or do something completely based off intuition which didn’t feel like the right thing to do either. Idk, it’s unfortunate because I wasn’t able to get out of my head for the entire 40 min flow. Nonetheless I have enjoyed and let go days 1-29 and that’s still something to be happy about. Thank you",MimDiesel,2020-09-11T12:14:23Z,0
"This really was a journey home for me &lt;3 grew up in the 90s with a new-age-crystal-totin mama so I was always in kid/ teen yoga and meditation classes. Really lost connection with that practice throughout my 20s. Partied hard and accidentally didn&#39;t do any yoga for about 8 years. Foolishly in my mind I thought I would pick back up where I left off when I was 18 (NOPE). It feels so good to come back to practice. I am so glad I did this, and really want to incorporate yoga into my daily routine again. Thank you Adriene! You are a true comrade. you have changed so many peoples lives all over the world for the better. these videos are a huge blessing for poor folks like me who can&#39;t afford much more than youtube.

"I loved the concept!  You have taught us, worked with us, and we have worked with you for 30 sessions.  It was time for us to try our wings.  It&#39;s amazing how clearly I see my behaviors, attitudes and approaches off the mat come to the mat.  I recall Adriene saying this from time to time in these 30 sessions.  I panicked a little when she said she was going without a mic.  I mostly trust her now, but not myself.  At first, I occasionally looked to see what she was doing &amp; followed. I did my own thing, like the side plank  and listened to my body, but somewhere along the way I started trying to keep up with her completely.  The half and full forward folds and rises have come to mean surrender &amp; opening myself to my Higher Power&#39;s strength etc.  Those were very personal beautiful moments.  I love to read what Adriene writes below the video.  It&#39;s often said in the video.  I sometimes cry because I&#39;m getting in touch with myself again.  I&#39;m returning to myself.  There were a lot of messages in the 30th day for me to process.  I&#39;m super grateful for the gifts I have received from my HIGHER POWER, through YOGA &amp; through ADRIENE&#39;s HOME series.  I too heard her voice throughout!  I hear it off the mat too!  hahaha!  I appreciate the comments made by the community below.  I can always relate somehow to each of you.  I&#39;m new here, but look forward to getting to know people and make friends!  Sorry for journaling in the comment section!  I&#39;ll work on that.

"Hi there Adriene! This is my story: When I first started your yoga program I was recovering from covid-19. I was not ill anymore, but for maybe three months my immune system had been very vunerable, I got new colds and other types of infections all the time, and I was so tired that a doctor took me off work part time. My working memory was failing, I had a hard time dealing with new or complex information. In the beginning I could only do yoga every second day, because the exercise drained my energy enough for the exhaution to &quot;spill over&quot; to the next day. My arms and legs were shaking in easy positions like Standing dog. But I persisted, and after a week or so I could see the difference and started to feel a little more like myself again. For different reasons (like I had to go slow in the beginning, and some days I would join people in yoga who did another one of your programs) the program took mee almost two months to finish. But by the end of Home I felt mentally and physically recovered. This became a long post, but what I really want to do is to send a big THANK YOU all the way from Malmö, Sweden. All the best / Käbi",käbi petersson,2020-09-07T05:51:46Z,1

"Dear Adriene, another 30 days journey, wonderful. The last video is without words. A bit nervous at the beginning, but it all turned out fine. I just knew how to breath, when to joke. And the cute Bengi, omg. <br />Always put my laptop on my right side. So it seems you lying down beside me, like a mirror. I peak you from time to time, and even my eyes closed, I see you smiling. You are my guide, also my dearest companion. When I found you share the same ponytail as me today, I felt great joy. Haha. <br />Through this journey, I&#39;m trying to figure out what home means to me. Hometown? Dormitory? I found it at the end, the real home is my own body. Every time I looked down on my feet and touched my sweat on my back, I was amused by my body. &quot;It&#39;s a very beautiful body, how can I never feel that way before?&quot;<br />There&#39;s a Chinese poem: &quot;此心安处，便是吾乡&quot;, means “wherever I find peace, that is my home.&quot;<br />A lot of thanks and love!

"In the end I cried. Don&#39;t know how that could have happened, but it did. Your HOME videos gave me so much, Adriene: calmness, hope, inspiration, flexibility and strength and I am very grateful for having been able to watch them. I&#39;m a hughe fan now. Thank you so much. Now I have to find another 30 days practise...",Nina Leitner,2020-09-02T09:43:56Z,0
"I am so proud of myself! I did 30 days straight, I had to make time, no matter how busy I got, how hard it got. As a beginner, not sure why I started with Home but I followed through and learnt something new every day! Thanks a lot, Adriene, for walking this journey with me. I trusted myself and I did it! Woohoo.",Truphena Owiti,2020-09-02T09:12:01Z,0

"I will be honest. There were meny moments I couldn&#39;t focus or commit this time. I got a scatter brain and I couldn&#39;t stick with you or listened to your voice or more importantly my own voice/heart sometimes. In fact this was my second time doing your 30days yoga journey and I did your very first 30 days yoga practice 5-6 years ago. Back then I had such a mindblowing and wonderful experience. So I was a bit disappointed at myself this time. But no matter how hard it was or how poorly I practiced,  at least I made a decision to never stop and always come back on the mat. Here I was on the 30th day, I knew what was coming - a freestyle yoga. This time I wasn&#39;t expecting much. I even had doubts about mylsef if I could do by myself. When you put your microphone down and the nice gentle music started, I reluctantly closed my eyes, sat legs crossed, breathed deeply, then the magic happened. I could <b>finally</b> shut down my brain, listen to my breath and my body, then I could finally let go and reconnect my heart. I lost in the beautifu music and followed the rhythm of my breath. I realized the goal and purpose of this practice wasn&#39;t to be perfect, but to listen to yourself, which means reconnect your heart -HOME. I did find a way HOME in the end.  Toward the end of the practice, I got emotional like many of you. It&#39;s always a beautiful feeling. When I finished up my practice, I sat leg crossed, closed my eyes and breathed gently again. Then I slowly opened my eyes.  My dog was standing right in front of me giving me the best smile while holding her favorite toy. Then she jumped on my lap as if she was waiting for that moment. I felt like I came home, held my dog and had happy tears. Thank you Adriene💕",snowbunnyjp,2020-09-01T07:33:16Z,0
"This was hard for me. I kind of look to Adriene as more of a personal trainer, like I&#39;m not getting in downward facing dog, plank pose or boat pose unless she tells me to lol. I&#39;ll just do cat/cow or child&#39;s pose if left to my own devices.",Gabby McCall,2020-08-31T21:18:06Z,0
"Thank you Adriene and the whole community! I started the 30 day yoga journey on April 1st and didn´t finished it until today (August 31st).These past few months were hard it a lot of aspects, but it was easier with this journey. I now feel like this: the world might be collapsing BUT you can be okay in your HOME, you can be peaceful &amp; grateful, and after that you can deal with whatever is happening outside. I discovered you can come back home, to yourself, and yoga it&#39;s a great way to do that.",Ana Castillejos,2020-08-31T20:12:47Z,0
"Finished the 30 days and it was a great journey. I just wasn‘t prepared for the visual only practice as I‘ve done most of the 30 days with eyes closed, just listening to Adrienne‘s voice! So it was a bit difficult to follow, watching it on my tiny tablet and there are just so many poses I do not want to crane my neck to see what‘s next... so mine was a loose interpretation of what I saw, guess that‘s kind of the idea of it. But I‘m more of a guided practice kind of person...",Judith Anders,2020-08-31T17:37:15Z,0

At first I wasn´t really sure about how I should move or with what pose I should continue, but after some minutes I just let it go and I just felt, I was just following my breath, my heart and my intution, at the end of this practise I almost cried, I think that this journey has had a wonderfull impact in my life, I feel proud of me for keep doing yoga everyday, and I´m sure I will do it for the rest of my life, thank you so much Adriene, thanks for being here with all of us, thanks because of your love, thanks &lt;3",Brenda Paola Baltazar García,2020-08-31T01:40:29Z,4

"This was hard and I&#39;m not sure I liked it, especially for the last day of the 30 day practice. I realized that I never look at the screen anymore. Mostly because I have to set my computer up off to the side in my space so I can&#39;t see it easily during the practice. In the beginning I was glancing over to the screen every few seconds and my brain was all over trying to figure out what was next. This sucked as normally I&#39;m calm, my brain is shut off besides following the cues. This would have been easier for me if Adriene just said a loose guideline for what to do and where to go and than just sat there smiling. At one point I decided to just breathe and do what I wanted but then found myself still glancing at the screen and switching directions to follow. Finally my solution was to watch her go through the poses and very slowly follow. That way I didn&#39;t have to think about as much. By the time we got to the floor I couldn&#39;t see the screen at all so just did what I wanted and closed out. Maybe I will try it again now that I know the basic flow and see if its better",Rachel Flynn,2020-08-25T16:52:45Z,0

"Dear Adriene.<br /><br />I really do hope you read this.  Today marked the end of my HOME journey and as someone who completed your 30 Day Yoga challenge a couple months ago the humbling realisation, that the last day may be another freestyle type Yoga session, all flooded back to me.  The passing of the baton, passing of the torch and gift of total trust was given to me once again today.  Despite having the thought in the back of my mind that &quot;oh this gonna be another freeestyle video,&quot; the wave of sadness and gratitude was still overwhelming.  I always get too used to and too comfortable with having you there to guide me, that I feel sad when it&#39;s time to say goodbye.<br /><br />But this time I make a promise to make sure this isn&#39;t a goodbye.  It&#39;s simply a &#39;see you next time.&#39;  Because this time round you aided me to find a deeper love, appreciation and serenity that I thought I had found during the last Yoga journey.  Am I still going to miss the idea of it being a 30 day journey/challenge?  Absolutely.  However, this time the ending feels different.  I don&#39;t feel like a complete novice anymore.  I feel more complete.  And I feel like Yoga is not just a challenge or goal for me to reach.  You have helped make Yoga my lifestyle:)<br /><br />I did this challenge alongside the Insanity workout and I am on day 30 of 63 for that workout as I type this comment.  This challenge has helped my cardio performance so much that I wish I could thank you eternally.  Since I do have another 30 days left of Insanity, I very may well just restart this HOME workout since I have a hard time letting people go haha.  Or I may do other random forms of Yoga per day until I reach the end.  But the bottomline is - I can&#39;t go.  I appreciate you too greatly!  And now I love Yoga too much.<br /><br />Thank you and see you next time!",neefy,2020-08-25T13:49:40Z,35

"It was a little hard to follow for me. It was also a little longer and fast paced than other sessions. Felt bad in the middle when i had to skip almost 15 minutes of the practice. But towards the end when the intro music came on, I could hear Adrienne telling us how we can work at out own pace. And that made me realise that although i couldn&#39;t finish it today, i will be able to someday. It will just take time❤️",Kajol Sood,2020-08-25T02:25:26Z,0

This is a beautiful community and I&#39;m so grateful to Adriene and the Find What Feels Good Team for literally saving my mind in the last year with daily practise! I&#39;m a Yoga instructor but also do other modalities (Reflexology for 20 years) and I find this series so motivating. Now we have two doggies sleeping while I do the Yoga.

"Feeling really frustrated by this final ‘no talking’ session. I am not a mind reader as to the progression of the moves and trying to focus on watching the video is off putting. I need your voice to guide me as I do most of the session with my eyes closed and headphones in. As a total novice to yoga I need guidance. Really disappointed in this video, sorry for being negative and I wouldn’t normally leave a comment unless it’s positive but I have really enjoyed the 29 days so almost wanted a greatest hits session with vocal guidance.",Jessica Wills,2020-08-23T15:59:19Z,0

This has taken me much longer than normal, since I have become my older brother&#39;s caretaker. So when I needed it the most, I had very little opportunity to participate. Anyhow, Adriene! Now what should I do? Start from the beginning? Guess so. Thanks for becoming a healthy part of my routines. Coupled with my new walking habit (what to do during a pandemic? I&#39;m not working) I&#39;ve lost 10 lbs and I feel fitter and more flexible. But, damn it, balance poses I guess are for you younger types. Namaste.",Steven Orloff,2020-08-20T14:33:00Z,0

This last day was a struggle for me without the guidance, which I took with so much grace for myself and love for how much I still have to learn. And then I sobbed for a good 10 mins after, this has been so amazing. Moving on to True now with a goal of 90 days in a row and even more personal growth ❤️",Emileigh Earl,2020-08-19T02:11:08Z,1
"I enjoyed this one although I was nervous at first. I understand the purpose is to get us comfortable with our own movements, speed, and transitions and not feel like we have to perfectly copy your pace.

I&#39;m sorry but I really didn&#39;t like this -  I couldn&#39;t do things like close my eyes or relax in poses like down dog or child&#39;s pose because I kept having to check where we were in the practice and it just made me really annoyed in the end.

"I think it&#39;s okay to feel frustrated and not like this. But remember, the point isn&#39;t to copy her, but do what feels good to us.

I&#39;m sure the irony (poetry?) of Home being the 30-day yoga practice for this year has not escaped anyone (especially you, Adriene). <br /><br />I couldn&#39;t be more grateful.<br />For the chance to uncover.<br />To struggle and let go.<br />For the &quot;I love yous&quot;.<br />To get out my head (and into your car - I snort laughed at that).<br /><br />To myself. To everyone. To Benji. To Adriene. To her team. To my mat. To the traditional custodians of the ground that supports me. <br /><br />To my body. I love you, friend.

Filled with so much emotion after finally reaching day 30. I’ve half-done a few of the 30 day journeys but never finished. I decided I was going to do this one from start to finish after getting the news my furlough was no longer temporary and I was laid off.

At first I felt hesitant about no voice guidance but after a few minutes I realized “I got this.”  I peeked at my phone several times but then I knew what came next. I didn’t follow everything Adrienne was doing but I did just what I wanted to do—which included a couple more child’s poses 😊 I list focus once or twice but brought it back. <br /><br />Really Adrienne, thanks so much for putting this channel out there.

"I love your videos and you have done so much for me. I am on my own journey to do all of your yoga videos. I find videos without audio cues to be very difficult because I can&#39;t close my eyes or focus on  my breath. It takes the meditative state out of yoga for me. I also love your voice and find it to be super comforting. I understand this is a tradition, but I wonder if in the future you might post one no audio version and one with audio version, so those of us who struggle with no audio can still have a great experience. Thank you Adriene. I love you.",Jadah Peters,2020-08-08T16:38:50Z,0
First of all I wanna put out my gratitude ! 🙏 I felt like it’s been way longer than a month ! I absolutely love your appearance and guidance ! I have to admit I had to do a one week break because my wrists were killing me ! I’m not use to being on my hands that much so I was in a lot of pain after two weeks . I picked up after a week and felt really good after I gained some strengths and I felt really proud ! This last day I was having mixed feelings about it - I didn’t wanted it to end . When I heard about the mic off I thought I’ll give it a go and half way through I felt how I more and more got annoyed . My breathing wasn’t working I was constantly looking at the screen I peaked and couldn’t relax at all . After 40 min I paused it to check how long itll be left . Not great . I’m feeling really annoyed finishing off this amazing journey like this .,Jess Plett,2020-08-08T11:19:05Z,0

"Definitely felt the beauty, the significance of completing this incredible journey with Adriene, Benji and all of you here in the comments! What a crazy time in the world right now.  I feel so blessed that Spirit guided me to yoga and with a simple search, finding this 30 day journey.  Everything about this was so sweet... precious really.  Loved the visual of the space, the centering music, a wonderful 4 legged for me to smile about (how cool that he was in and out, free to do his own thing and to really come home and into the mix on day 30!) the guidance, wisdom and personality from Adriene... all so welcome and soothing.  Thank you so much.  When I take time to read the comments, it&#39;s another lovely bit that is added to the journey.  Thank you.  For our last day of this particular journey, I found that I really wanted to hear her voice to guide and give direction.  On one hand, I was glad that I was able to follow what she was doing on the screen.  I wanted to sink into the moment more, but definitely felt the part of me that doesn&#39;t want to leave something out.... so I had to keep checking the screen to make sure that I was on track.  I felt good inside though.  Tearful at the end.  Again, just loving Benji weaving in and out of it all!  Hands together...heart... third eye... Namaste beautiful ones! &#39;Til we meet again.",Nicola Karesh,2020-08-05T13:12:17Z,1

"We are still on lockdown in South Africa. Since end March 2020 and I just finished this 30 Day yoga practice. At some point on this video i looked up and Adrienne was petting Benji. It was so cute and I thought I wish I had such a loving pet. My cat, not the friendliest of creatures, came over and purred and rubbed against me and was so loving. It seldom happens, but it made me feel so grateful for the loving pet I do have (i clearly didn&#39;t realise it before). Very emotional experience.

"This was frustrating.  I didn&#39;t know what was going to come next and when it would come.  I scrolled through the comments and I seem to be one of the few who felt this way.  I wanted to relax and enjoy but I was craning my neck the whole time trying to watch my screen.  I haven&#39;t needed to do that for any of the other videos  because of the guidance of when to move, how many breaths, etc.  Any chance there can be a version where we&#39;re still told what poses to do and when to move?  I understand that defeats the purpose of the silent video but I found this to be the most frustrating days.  Regardless, thank you so much for this journey, Adriene.

"After doing a big hike yesterday I felt really sore today, especially in my feet and ankles. At first the length of this practice put me off, but then I realised it&#39;s the silent day 30. Which means I can do whatever I want. Find what feels good. So I put together a yoga practice that fit my current needs - mostly restorative and focused on stretching aching muscles. I glanced up at Adriene every now and then to see what she was doing, but I was perfectly happy doing my own thing. I was really surprised by this, because during previous day 30s I always tried to keep up with Adriene. And now I just...didn&#39;t. It was really empowering to realise I had all the tools to put together a 40 min sequence by myself, for myself.<br /><br />That said, I still prefer being guided by Adriene :D",Anra,2020-08-02T14:28:28Z,1

"I started this journey as a way to force myself to get my body moving again after being idle in quarantine for so long. What I didn&#39;t expect was to grow mentally and emotionally as well. The thing that I am most proud after completing this journey is not my increase in strength and flexibility (although that&#39;s pretty awesome too) but the ability to quiet my mind. I have had many days that have been very, very difficult but having the ability to just lay down and focus on my breathing has done wonders for my overactive mind. I definitely think I have discovered both a love for yoga and a love for myself. Thank you to this community, and especially to Adriene, for such an amazing and uplifting experience.

Yay!  We did it!  I was a little nervous about &quot;Silent Adriene&quot; mostly because I&#39;ve done most all of this whole practice by letting her voice guide me (especially the times when she says go ahead and close your eyes if you want to and I already had).  But I was able to do it today -- maybe not perfectly or at the very same pace -- but I did it and enjoyed the journey and new experience!  I was worried about missing all of he wisdom that she imparts along the way -- kind of in passing -- that I&#39;ve learned from but I heard many of those messages repeated in my head as I went along today; both of how to do the yoga poses and move as well as  how to take it into daily life.  I must say that I loved the music!!!  And it was like watching poetry in motion to see Adriene move so beautifully through the poses. <br />This was a great yoga experience and I recommend it to anyone and everyone! I&#39;m going to do &quot;Home&quot; again after I try some of Adriene&#39;s other series.,shelliwsmith,2020-07-31T17:06:33Z,0

"Initially I planned to follow along with you, I was a little anxious about getting lost without your voice and was going to try to remember some of the sequences from the first 29 days of this Home practice... but then I started to breathe, to check in with myself, to hear you say, &quot;Find What Feels Good&quot; in my mind&#39;s ear, and something clicked. I truly did my own practice. I have been doing a fitness challenge and I spent the whole 40 minutes stretching and breathing into all the sore, aching parts of my body. I stepped of the mat feeling <b>so much better!</b>",Kirstyn Livingston,2020-07-30T17:57:50Z,0

"Adriene, today I completed my day 30 and I don&#39;t know how can I ever thank you enough for this. You have changed my life. Life&#39;s good Adriene. Life&#39;s good because of you ❤️. On day one I came with lot of anxiety, stress and negativity. You will be happy to know that I am finally home 💕. I cried my heart out towards the end of this video. I am so proud of myself and so thankful that I chose to do this. You always said the hardest part is to show up. On day one I couldn&#39;t do a basic plank or down dog and here I am today ❣️. I have never seen angels or god but than I found you, my guiding light. I will always be with you, show up and practice with you. Once again a heartfelt thanks to you and this wonderful community. I love you Adriene thanks for your unconditional support. Sending you love and light. I am grateful that I found you and will always keep you in my heart and thoughts💗🌻.

"Like many others I 100% panicked at the beginning and even thought about skipping the last day, but as soon as I started moving I realized I had learned so much and I just moved to the music and my breath. I can understand how this was too overwhelming for many; I think the key here is to not be hard on yourself and remember to keep breathing and moving to whatever feels right for you. I finished the practice without realizing that I had flown through 40 minutes of my own yoga-created practice. I’m so thankful for this journey and will definitely continue to do yoga.",palomita94ful,2020-07-29T00:43:30Z,0

"I had completed a &quot;30 days&quot; years ago, in bits and spurts over the course of a few months. Then, I was so focused on getting in a &quot;good workout&quot; and didn&#39;t pay any attention to my breath. I didn&#39;t even know how to begin to do that. Years have passed since then and, in the midst of this pandemic, I decided to do another 30 days of yoga journey and I&#39;m so glad that I did. This time, it was all. about. the. breath. for me and that changed everything. This past week, I started to worry about this practice. I remembered the tradition of the 30th practice not being guided and I was flooded with self-doubt and fear. But, I showed up today and I had a genuine smile on my face the whole time. I turned the computer so I wouldn&#39;t be tempted to look at the screen if I didn&#39;t need to and instead I went inward and just followed my breath and flowed for the entirety of the practice! My smile was from so deep within me. Tears flowed multiple times, happy tears,  as I&#39;m just overwhelmed with gratitude for you and what you give to this community, for this journey, and for myself. I feel strong and calm and proud and happy. Thank you thank you thank you.",CharmaineMarie,2020-07-25T18:48:38Z,0
"We Both came to the Matt today with almost the same outfits on..The same time that Benji was walking around the room my cat was walking around the same time it was funny it was almost like a mirror image but a cat and a dog..That was actually really hard because I had to keep looking at my phone to see what you were doing without having any instruction. It’s not that I don’t know the moves. But when you say what it is I don’t have to look at the phone and I can just focus on the move more so this was actually really difficult for me, but I did it..I just finished the 30 day program and I am so proud of myself and now I’m just gonna start doing your other yoga videos every day..",Corina Delattre,2020-07-24T19:09:14Z,0

"If you had told me a month ago that I’d be guiding myself through a 40 min yoga flow, I’d think you were nuts. But this practice had me trusting myself, finding what I needed in my own time. It reminded me that life’s moments all come to us exactly when we need them, and just because someone else is doing them first doesn’t mean we won’t get there in our own time—even if their journey is just a reminder to steer our boat to that course and redirect. <br /><br />I began this journey because I’m a new mom trying to figure out parenting while working at home during quarantine. This practice was every day during the first nap. It changed me. <br /><br />Thank you for this practice Adriene. It’s been the first “fitness journey” I’ve ever completed. <br /><br />Thank you for you, the community, who I checked in with often to see if they experienced what I did and to hear of your journeys. <br /><br />My pups and I enjoyed this and can’t wait to see what’s next. <br /><br />Love you all.

WOW! first 30 day journey and like most people was avidly watching the screen - for 5 minutes! Then watched (poetry in motion) for the next 5 minutes then decided I wanted to actually BE on the mat with Adriene so just started moving around and felt totally free to do my own thing! Wasn&#39;t pretty 😝 but it made me feel like I was doing yoga. Thank you SO much for this wonderful experience.

"This was definitely an interesting last session. I went ahead and did it, sometimes following Adriene, sometimes just doing what I felt like. I’ll admit about over halfway through I was pretty much out of ideas haha and it was hard to follow along without any audio, so I kind of gave up and just read the comments. I don’t think I can do 40 mins of yoga unguided, I’m glad I’m not the only one.<br /><br />Still, I’m so grateful to you Adriene for this practice! I loved being able to experiment and make the poses my own. The comments section is always so kind and inspiring, you’ve created a wonderful community. You are a lovely human being, and I look forward to doing your other 30 day practices! 🙏",Leanzadoodles,2020-07-21T19:01:50Z,0

"Adriene, thank you so much for this! After almost a decade of practicing yoga in inconsistent spurts, I feel like I finally found my way home into my daily practice. I&#39;m glad you told us to come to the mat today with an open mind, I felt a little unsure about how to do this without your voice guiding me... but your voice was there the whole time! &quot;If you fall, we will catch you&quot; &quot;Trust that the earth will catch you&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t panic&quot; &quot;Find what feels good&quot; &quot;You got this!&quot; Thank you.  I found myself very emotional during this one as well, anyone else?  Also - I loved so much that Benji moved with us this time. I think he was trying to catch a fly? Lol.

"As I said below, I struggled to follow along today but love the music and chose to play the video in the background while doing my daily physiotherapy exercises. Downward dog is one of the exercises and I intuitively walked back up the mat afterwards, even though this is not part of the physio, and looked up at the screen and see that you JUST did the same thing. :D So, I&#39;m a bit let down that I was able to reap the full benefits of HOME ... but maybe I don&#39;t have as far to go as I think. ;) <br />Also, can we buy this music from you?

I did this in a heat index of 105 today, sweating it all out. I had this feeling of sweating out all the negativity in my life and the things that just don&#39;t fit with this new found peace  and just an overwhelming feeling of renewed freshness and well being. I am looking forward to many more years of this peace. Thank you Adriene and thank you to all who came to the mat. Peace and love to you all.",Jennifer Smith,2020-07-18T21:19:14Z,0
"Thank you. Wow I got to day 30. Unfortunately I brought to the mat a shoulder I had wrenched probably while sleeping so had to be kind to myself physically and emotionally and did the sort of session that I could manage. The rest I watched thinking ...oh yes, we have done this and this. Also watching was like watching poetry in motion.  I was even joined by my cat for the first time. A fabulous journey. Thank you so much. My first 30 days with Adriene. I’m sure it won’t be the last. Still in partial lockdown here. Have an inviting flower filled outside space for yoga so I reckon I will go with my own flow from tomorrow and see where that takes me.

"THANK YOU SO MUCH, ADRIENE! This is the second 30 day yoga journey I’ve done with you during COVID. Your videos are a true gift to me during this time. I feel like I truly have returned home to myself, my intuition, to trust myself. Slow down when I need to, find my breath, and let the breath guide me. During these 60+ days now of yoga with you, as a long time off and on practitioner, I’ve been able to do what I haven’t done in years. Both literally and metaphorically. Release old hurt and pain stored in my body. Heal those areas within, even in the spiritual/ emotional body. I truly appreciate your approach as a teacher.

"I wanted to say thank you for an incredible journey home! I found you on a whim from my children&#39;s PE class while quarantining. I&#39;m stuck home might as well try yoga. Well, 4 months later and I just completed my first monthly journey with you. The final day wa bittersweet. I had made it and learned so much. I was ready for one final leg on my journey home, but no I have to go it &quot;alone&quot;. Surprisingly, I rose to the occasion and had one of the most satisfying sessions of the month. Your constant reminders were always in the back of my head. I can&#39;t thank you enough for all that you have done.

I&#39;ve been in a quarantine lockdown where I can&#39;t leave the house more than twice a week for the past 2 months and this journey was a great way to work on my mindfulness and gave me something to look forward to each day.

"I also started this journey during quarantine and although I had to pause a few days or a week, my body always felt the need to come back and to &quot;trust the process&quot;. For me, having achieved something that is just for me, just for my wellbeing provides me with so much joy. The most touching phrase in my head for me through all this time was that the earth has my back. Thank you so much Adriene, I love you and your endless love for us all.

"This was so wholesome! I was scared at the freedom of not being told what to do, but like you said, we already had the tools! The bits where Benji came to you and said hi were so lovely! This made me a bit emotional to be honest. Before Adrienne I was very skeptical of Yoga.  It was a very lovely and welcome coincidence (or maybe not), that on the last day of the 30 days of Yoga just before I was about to start, I got a call from work and I got a promotion!<br /><br />Thank You Adriene!",Nick Bradley,2020-07-15T11:57:00Z,0

Today was so special with you turning the mic off - I suddenly found myself in pidgeon and tree pose watching you do your thing while I did mine and it was magical.

"I really struggled with this and got really frustrated having to come out of poses so I could stop and see what I was supposed to be doing, to the point I actually stopped the video half way through.

"I went to the comments to see if I wasn&#39;t alone in feeling a bit emotional at the end of this one--I will admit, I cried at the end of the video. It felt to me like the last day of summer camp as a kid, or saying goodbye to a good friend, melancholy and bittersweet. These 30 day challenges mean the world to me and I have been doing them for years now. I love Yoga with Adriene, she is such an amazing teacher and guide.

I loved my 30 day yoga journey but have to admit-I’m really really bummed you didn’t voice guide for this last episode.  I usually close my eyes the majority of the practice and couldn’t do that for this day that I’ve been looking forward to so much.  Maybe consider giving up your tradition for a future series? Thanks nonetheless!,Nick Paige,2020-07-12T20:40:39Z,0
Thank you Adriene. Finished my first 30 days with you during lockdown. It has totally converted me from a once a week yoga girl to an everyday one. I loved it and felt the improvements both physically and spiritually over the course of the journey. Already started the next one ‘True’. Love your style it’s so natural and so calming . Finally aged 62 I have found exercise that I love and has brought me home to myself . Namaste x,Ruth Shaw,2020-07-12T20:25:56Z,0
"I don’t even know how to start, but I’ll just say Thank You.<br />During quarantine, I knew I had to start embracing a healthier lifestyle. I started doing HIIT and (eventually) yoga every other day after being recommended your channel. I started with the Home series cuz I thought it was created by the need to quarantine, but it was just a fantastic coincidence! I’ve never done yoga before and decided to try it. Here I am, 2 months later and I just completed a self-led practice with the tools and grace you gave us during the Home journey. Like many others, I was intimidated by the 40 minute video length, and learned the hard way that day 30 wouldn’t be guided. I didn’t think I could do it, but I just started by sitting in a comfy position and leaning into the breath. Then everything just.. happened. 20 minutes went by of listening to my body and moving into whatever positions I could either remember or felt like doing. I feel so much happier with myself, with my progress, and my physical flexibility. I didn’t expect this to stir some emotions in me after completing the Home journey, but thank you. I can’t wait to try the other journeys you’ve posted on here! Very grateful for you.",Brandon Cera,2020-07-12T19:21:36Z,0
"Yay! I&#39;ve done it 30 days in a row without missing one. This final was was lovely, somehow before I started I&#39;d decided to play it through my television.

"I found this really good but also rather difficult. I found I had to keep looking at my laptop down on the ground to follow the routine, which at times made the balancing postures a little tricky and rather wobbly! I use the voice cues a lot and don&#39;t look at the screen much when doing a &#39;normal&#39; practice - it felt like I needed 3 synchronized screens: one in front, and two to each side! Anyway, it was good because I like the longer routines and everything we&#39;ve covered in the past 30 days is in there. The funniest part was when my cat came onto my mat at exactly the same time Benji came onto Adriene&#39;s - I could hear her voice say &quot;now pet your animal...&quot;! Thanks Adriene for taking the time and effort to publish these videos on youtube for us! It&#39;s wonderful that so many people from around the world can benefit from them :-) (I&#39;m in France btw) Namaste",LMB2301,2020-07-11T07:59:22Z,0

Would have loved to have been talked (even minimally) through 40 mins, bringing together all that we&#39;d practised. As it was, what a let-down.",critical critter,2020-07-09T15:12:49Z,0

Today I had all the tools and I did it. I found myself in tears multiple times because I am so thankful for how much Yoga with Adriene has benefitted my life and I&#39;m amazed by what my body can do. Plus, there were a few times where my eyes were closed and when I glanced at the screen, Adriene and I were doing the same thing - it&#39;s beautiful how we are all connected and sometimes we don&#39;t even know it.

"I did it! For something like 3 years now, I have tried to do your 30-day challenges and given up after day 4 or 5. The kids would interrupt too much, I&#39;d feel too tired....and then not come back to it. This time, I was determined it would be different. It did take me all of 3 months to actually finish all 30 days, but I DID IT. Yep, I still missed days, but my mindset was completely different, I&#39;d tell myself &quot;Okay, you are not a failure, today your children needed you more, tomorrow is another chance to try again.&quot; I am no longer in the mindset of giving up, I&#39;m in the habit of trying again!

"I started this journey home since my therapist recommended it. I didn&#39;t expect much, maybe only hoping for more flexibility and physical strength. I didn&#39;t think too much of your commentary through the month with Adriene. But halfway through this video, around the star pose, I realised, for the first time in my life, I had a positive voice in my head and started to break down crying. I&#39;ve always had low self-esteem, with many negative voices rattling around in my brain. However, now, I internalised a positive voice that said &#39;I love you&#39;.

I found myself craning my neck towards the screen rather than focusing inward as I normally can during these videos. It was a disappointing way to end such a beautiful series. Please could you upload a version of your day 30s where you simply say the name of the next posture when you’re switching? Or something similar?

"Hi Adrienne, thank you for this. Your yoga practice not only helped my body but also my mental state a lot, and taught me to be more independent, self-reliant, and to trust my body. Was it just me or anyone else as well that was emotional towards the end of this practice. Yesterday was Guru Purnima where we thank our teachers. I finished this practice today, so thank you for being such a wonderful teacher ❤️",Shubhangi Kale,2020-07-06T03:39:09Z,0

"I am 17 years old, and heading off to college next year. I started doing yoga about two and a half months ago and I am so proud to be a part of the yoga with Adriene community. This practice was hard for me, and I definitely had a couple of days where I just couldn&#39;t get myself do practice, but I always came back and finished out strong. This practice has been life-changing for me, even in the very little time that I have been regularly practicing. I have created a greater bond to myself, my heart, my body, and the universe. I am so grateful for this practice everyday, for helping me realize how beneficial and therapeutic it truly is. I plan on brining my yoga mat with me to college, and plan on making yoga a prominent part of my life forever.<br /><br />Thank you, I love you all, and wish you all the best in your practice. :)",em,2020-07-04T22:28:42Z,0
"Wow I finally finished it, with an odd day off but this is the first full series I reached the end and didn’t give up! I’m sweating loads from it but I went with what felt right within my body. Bit tricky without direction but after 30 days you feel what’s gonna happen next! Now to find my next yoga 30 days! Thank you Adriene this was my first full month of exercise since my surgery, a perfect way to slowly get my body moving again.

"Started this journey with the intention of giving myself just this one thing. If the rest of my day, my heart and my mind goes all out for everyone and everything happening in the world, with each day, this journey was a gift for me and myself. I am so grateful for this, for Adrienne for making yoga welcoming and embracing, removing every expectation and hint of intimidation I’ve always felt before. Thank you for helping me and a lot of people see that this is something we deserve and I can always show up as I am. <br /><br />The music on this last video in the journey helped so much, and when the theme song would play, it really felt like coming home. I moved to Singapore four months ago from the Philippines and I’ve been getting incredibly anxious and homesick. This journey helped me process my feelings and helped me breathe through the transition. Reminded me that home is wherever I am. <br /><br />Stay safe everyone.

"My mother, sister and I spent the last few months doing both &quot;Dedicate&quot; and &quot;Home&quot; together via Skype! We really enjoyed both journeys and it has become a kind of ritual, meeting up every morning to do yoga together - so thank you Adriene!<br /><br />However, we never really know how to handle Day 30 of any journey. While it&#39;s nice listening to the music, we all struggle with the actual yoga sequence, getting cricks in our necks trying to see the screen while in downward facing dog, lying on our backs, etc. We all feel like we can&#39;t enjoy (and relax into) the movements because we&#39;re constantly checking what&#39;s next and how long you hold the positions for. So sadly, we&#39;ve ended each series with a little more disappointment and frustration than would be anticipated.<br />Of course we trust ourselves and the movements we&#39;ve learnt, but we don&#39;t want to make something up when we&#39;re all doing it together - just because we can&#39;t see what&#39;s actually happening.<br />Dear Adriene, if you ever read this comment, we would be thrilled if you would consider adding just a bit of commentary at the end of your next journey, so that the transitions from and to positions not facing the screen become more manageable. That would allow us to truely enjoy even the very last part of the journey!!",Σιεηα VθιιμεΓ,2020-07-02T08:46:51Z,0

I just let go of the screen completely and for me it really worked (but then again it was my third journey and I remember that I was so confused at the end of the first). I almost completely forgot that she was there but knowing the video was there made me do yoga the whole 40 minutes.,Amalia X,2021-05-02T09:09:59Z,1
"@Sarah Juniper Greene I just stopped it at the 15-minute mark. It&#39;s hard on my neck and stressful to constantly be looking to see what I&#39;m supposed to do and since I&#39;ve only done yoga for 29 days now (apart from some sporadic yoga here and there over the years), I am not at all ready for making up my own sequence.",Beth S,2021-04-24T02:05:46Z,0
Glad I&#39;m not the only one feeling like this. My neck hurts from looking up at my screen the whole time 😟 one of the reasons I love adrienne so much is because her verbal cues are so descriptive I rarely need to look at my screen at all. Idk. Definitely feel completely tied up in knots instead of relaxed.,Natalie Aleman,2021-04-20T13:49:18Z,1
"i feel the same way. BUT i think it will get better with each yoga journey. Like the first time I did one i just skipped day 30 because i didn&#39;t like the concept, i didn&#39;t feel like looking at my screen all the time. This time i did it because i wanted to feel the culmination of the 30 day practice, but i still didn&#39;t like it.

"Practising from Beijing and this is the first time I&#39;ve completed a 30 days of yoga, I feel really amazing. I wasn&#39;t expecting to be doing it by myself, and the length of the video initially got me a bit panicked, but after focussing on my breath I just allowed myself to move into the spaces I&#39;ve learnt in the last 30 days. I lost my balance a couple of times but could hear Adriene saying that the mat will catch me and to try again, and so I did. I&#39;m definitely going to continue practising yoga every day, but I&#39;m going to miss this feeling of continuity.

"So, I&#39;ve been bedridden from November of past year until February of this year, crippled by full-body eczema and the depression that came with it. I&#39;m usually fairly stable mentally (which I&#39;m so thankful for) so the depression hit me like a freight train.<br /><br />However, as I started slowly climbing out of the darkness, with the help of my incredible parents, therapist, and medication, I started to regain my sense of self.<br /><br />This month, I finally decided that enough was enough - I was going to put my past behind me, whilst still holding on to the lessons and the grace that it taught me. That&#39;s when I stumbled across this 30 Day Yoga Journey.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know what made me click on this particular one - after all, there were more recent Yoga Journeys - but I like to think it was serendipity, a higher power, maybe even my intuition, that brought me to you, Adrienne.<br /><br />And I&#39;ve done it. I&#39;ve done 30 Days of Yoga, 30 days of taking care of myself for the first time in a long time  30 days of walking the path, not back to the old Ciara, but towards the new Ciara that I&#39;ve always been. I&#39;ve uncovered parts of my personality that I never knew were there. I&#39;m resilient, I&#39;m strong, and I have more optimism and hope inside me than a Disney princess (or prince, for that matter).<br /><br />For the last 15mins of practice, I just lay on my side in the fetal position, with my clear skin and peaceful heart, and cried. I just cried and cried and cried. In that moment, I felt reborn.<br /><br />I&#39;m damn proud of myself for doing this, and I&#39;m so, so thankful that you, wonderful Adrienne, have chosen to share your gift to the world.<br /><br />I extend love to everyone. I extend love to myself. Most of all, I extend love to the home I&#39;ve rebuilt inside of myself.<br /><br />Thank you, Adrienne.<br />Love,<br />Ciara",featherweight123,2020-07-01T01:28:00Z,15

"I started &quot;Home&quot; in January, was keeping up with doing a video once or twice a week, and then quarantine hit and I couldn&#39;t get myself to do yoga for a few months due to depression/stress/anxiety, etc.  Decided to make a goal to do a video every day for the last few days of June, and today I finished!  I had no idea what Day 30 was but I had so much idea.  This was easily the most fun I&#39;ve ever had doing yoga; I didn&#39;t even know that I had it in me to do a whole session without guidance but I totally can!

I appreciate you and this practice as well as the community of other yogis who went on this journey. After these 30 days, I find myself being able to stay calm and focused in stressful situations, I am able to breathe deeper and be more mindful, I am more aware of my posture and find myself stretching more throughout the day.

My upward downward facing dog feels more like a comfort than just stretching. Most importantly, in 30 days, I learned to find solace in my breathing. I feel like I found a friend in you.

Aw....I was so disappointed with day 30. I know the idea was to go with the flow but that&#39;s not what I came here for. I wanted to end on a high for doing 30 days straight and day 30 was the worst day of all. I feel really quite emotional about it! The lack of guidance was frustrating and there wasn&#39;t a whole lot of variety. I know I am in the minority here!  I will however continue my yoga journey and tomorrow is another day.

"I am 25 years old. I want to start off by saying that this is the first goal I have ever set for myself and have willfully achieved. I started this 30 day yoga practice during quarantine, when I began deeply examining my life and reconnecting with myself spiritually, once that finally had the space for me to address it due to not working my usual, very stressful job. It also naturally created a lot of chaos, me opening up doors to myself that I had long locked shut (I&#39;ve tried to commit to yoga for so long but never made the time for it). I had very little yoga experience prior to this. I definitely had no core strength or balance. I turned to yoga for mental clarity, for emotional release, and for physical health. There were hard days, but the reward that I hold now was well worth it. I haven&#39;t felt this type of mental clarity, ever. I haven&#39;t felt this good, ever. I have more patience, more grace. I am overall more calm. What I once never made time for, I now can&#39;t go a day without. I find myself excited for this practice every day, ready and willing for the internal discipline it&#39;s taught me to have. It has helped teach me, that ultimately, I am in control here. I am worthy of giving myself the time to grow. These positive changes influenced me to apply to college (my last course was 7 years ago). I am taking more initiative and chasing after my dreams. I truly owe it to these videos, this practice, and you, Adrienne. I can&#39;t wait to begin the next 30 day yoga journey tomorrow.  My new goal is to do yoga every day for a year. If I can make it 30 days, I can make it every day. I surprised myself doing the last day of this challenge. I actually was able to keep up with you and move through each pose easily. I realized I have grown a lot stronger than I thought I would grow to originally. I could go on and on about how this practice has changed my life, but alas, I&#39;ll be with you in my next journey!",Kaiden Johnson,2020-06-29T22:04:50Z,97

"Hello Adriene, before quarantine I did a little bit of Yoga, but when I discovered your yoga serie, home, I thought i would give it a try! Turns out it was the best decision I made for myself, i discovered that i was more powerful and strong then I thought. You helped me strengthen my muscles, calm my daily anxiety, so thank you so much! You are a wonderful human being, you gave me courage to never give up and look forward. I cried a little bit at the end, i was proud of myself, proud of us, all people who did this journey. Lots of love and peace , xxxxx",cool maexx,2020-06-28T16:37:12Z,0

I&#39;ve been doing this religiously for the 29 days and felt it has really helped with various things in my life. Day 30 has completely thrown me. I felt I was really picking it up and understanding the names and movements. Today made me feel upset as after 2/3 minutes of having to turn to watch the tv I gave up. I wasn&#39;t sure if I was to copy the flow or make up my own.  I&#39;ll keep using Adriene&#39;s videos as I really enjoyed them but after only 1 month Of yoga I know I still need the guidance x,Claire Wilson,2020-06-28T11:45:13Z,1

"I did this journey the second time and in between two others of your journeys. This final was amazing - it was the first time that I didn’t even look at the screen and was in a total flow. All learned from your practice, Adriene!!! Thanks so so much ❤️ Yoga never meant anything to me but now it is part of my daily routine. I even watched the History of Yoga on Gaia. So interesting and amazing! <br />Thank you!! You inspire me!",Franziska K.,2020-06-28T07:02:27Z,0
"Finally reached the end of this journey, I just want to write about how grateful I am for adriene&#39;s yoga and how glad I am to give myself the time and space for yoga with adriene. This past month with adriene completely transformed how i do yoga, how I feel in my body and how I feel my mind. Anyone who is interested in yoga, PLEASE START WITH THIS JOURNEY :) <br />In the first week i started to pay attention to the various little sensations and moments in my body - from the soreness of my neck to the touch of the ground on my toes. I started to pay more and more attention to my fingers, the ways I use my muscles, my torso, my quads. I paid attention to threading my every movement with my breath - with more space in my mind.<br />While I discovered parts of my body that i had never paid attention to, i am feeling more calm, more stillness, more resilience, more strength, and more clarity in my mind. I realized that my mind is strong and my body can be stronger.  <br />Thank you adriene!",Jou-An Chen,2020-06-27T23:29:12Z,0

"This was my first time ever experiencing Yoga and I really think that crossing Adriene&#39;s channel was a true gift from above; I started this journey looking to improve my discipline and commitment, but came out learning about self love and awareness &lt;3. <br /><br />This final practice was amazing and so emotional for me, I have never cried over the entire journey but this session had me all emotional since the beginning, I was feeling proud, nostalgic &amp; grateful, and also, the presence of adriene even without the mic + the home soundtrack made me feel so so so so confident during the entire practice. Loved loved loved it. <br /><br />Thank you so much, Adriene, for all your effort and kindness, what you are doing is just a beautiful and perfect way of impacting people&#39;s life in a very positive way, you&#39;re a truly influencer. <br /><br />May God bless you and all your community.  :)",Melissa Beras,2020-06-27T11:25:24Z,0

I couldn&#39;t relax into any of the stretches because I had no cues and I had to keep checking the screen. It was such a let down after an otherwise great series.

"I just completed Home June 26 (8 Infinite number, which is one of my fav numbers and significant to me, I have a tattoo 8) 2020. I started my Yoga Journey back home to me at the onset of this pandemic, it took me 90 days to finish a 30 day Yoga practice. I&#39;ve learnt that I need to work on consistency. But I also learnt that I need to be gentle and kind with myself since this is My Journey. Even more so during a really hard time for many. I hold space for me and all my brothers and sisters, those that are light beings. I cried today once I completed my 30 Day, but I cried through many sessions, for one reason or another. So many moments that Adrienne allowed me to discover more about myself if not in my Yoga poses but on a spiritual deep plain. I thank you and hope for better days and that light and love always shines upon us all. The greater <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ywa"">#YWA</a> community and all positive, light communities coming together is a powerful thing, even if its in our own corner of the Universe.

This was the first video ever of Adriene I didn&#39;t finish. Really disliked it. I felt left alone and stressed out. I can&#39;t look at the video and do the shapes at the same time and i feel like a complete failure bcs I don&#39;t know what to do and how. The worst way to end this otherwise really great 30 day journey. This completely ruined it and my motivation to show up on the mat for me completely :(<br />Would have been nice to have an &quot;alternative ending&quot; for people like me who can&#39;t do it by themselves. <br />Loved all the other videos though.,BethAge,2020-06-26T15:08:21Z,0

"I was very afraid when you said the mic would be off, I believe it is something I have been feeling a lot in the last years, whenever I&#39;m on my own I start to panic and freeze, through jobs, through life. I thought about quitting and not doing this one, but then I realized how this attitude has affected my life, so I stoped second guessing and dived right in. I was so surprised that when I checked we were doing almost the same asanas, and i remembered &quot;intuit&quot; &quot;ground&quot; breathe&quot; &quot;keep&quot; &quot;lots of love in, lots of love out&quot; Suddenly I was flooded with this trust and confidence, it was so beautiful. I joined you for the last asanas and as soon as I finished reading the quote  my heart melted and I was crying!! Thanks to you Adriene and to this great community! I felt like we were all together while reading the comments and crying. I will begin another calendar tomorrow and keep this trust in this new beginning for my life. Ps. We love you so much Benji!!

"I really appreciate you Adriene - I love coming to the matt, your lovely personality and humour - it’s like spending time with the chillest of friends.  This one was a bit intimidating when you said no guidance ._. Didn’t know how I’d fill 40 mins off of memory! But I trusted you, as I have from the start.  With the exception of a great 7 min foot massage, I ended up going for an hour with barely any hesitation.  And I managed to easily hold the crow pose for 5 seconds, 3 times in a row! Couldn’t do it at all last time!  Most of all, what I realised is you will always be with me on my yoga journey now, guiding me, making me smile and relax - whether I have YouTube or am atop a mountain somewhere in the world.

I could defiantly tell a difference in my breathing and flexibility than when I started this a month ago but this was the video that I had a big emotional moment of realization during one of the poses that I&#39;ve always had trouble with. I just had to go slowly, go back to my breathing and think to myself &quot;I&#39;ve got you, I&#39;ve got you through this&quot; It was then I realized that I had grown to give so much love and support for myself instead of harsh critique.

Thany you, Adrienne. I have never felt more connected to you and everyone in this community. It was like you were there with me, in my living room, and at the same time, I felt like I was somewhere else, with you guys. It was really special. <br />And I realised today, that I can trust in myself. I knew what I had to do because I could feel it. The power in me guided me today. Thanks to you, Adrienne, I feel strong and capable today. <br />And speaking of the journey HOME, it was literally for me, since I moved in a couple month ago. And now, after finishing this yoga-journey I also feel like I have found a way into my literal new home. It does feel like home to me now. <br />Thank you, Adrienne for guiding me home, and letting me find my inner, powerful voice!

"I’m not sure how long I’ve been practicing, but I believe I started with one of your very first (if not the first) 30 Days of Yoga. I have fallen off my practice for years at a time in between, but I always come back. It is where I find peace and feel most connected to my spirit and Divine energy. I love the curated playlists you’ve started with “power” words, and I will move to that one next. I am much more aware of my body since starting my yoga journey, and I can’t wait to go further.

"That was a shock to my system, wasn’t quite expecting that...and it jumped to a lot longer than I could handle after being trained this month between 20-30 minutes videos.  I tried to keep up as best I could , constantly rushing and peeking at her, felt messy and lost confidence but I did the best I could. I love her videos normally. I hope to either start this 30 day over or check her other videos....that definitely was not a feel good moment for achieving / finishing the month journey.

"A friend suggested HOME to me a couple of days before my birthday. I&#39;m so thankful to him for allowing me to discover this amazing opportunity to breathe and this wonderful way of understanding our own movements. I was unnerved when I realised we had to do today kind of on our own, and my intuition wasn&#39;t so strong—but maybe it was the SICK entry of the opening theme in the middle of the video that got me so pumped up. I was kinda struggling in the middle but that filled me with so much joy, and I found myself in tears at the end. I cry easily but during yoga I am so focused on moving and RELAXING, I thought years of joking about had made me immune to cathartic crying. Maybe because it was so relieving, cathartic; maybe because of the glorious thumbnail or the music; or maybe I was stretching it so HOME wouldn&#39;t end, I found myself shedding a couple of tears in a quiet kind of joy. Thank you so much, Adriene. You made me believe in this. It was a beautiful journey.",Sananda Gopalakrishnan,2020-06-22T06:19:05Z,0

"I have a weird journey with yoga. I used to do jogging in my past, but only to see that I did 6-13 km of trace, but I wasn&#39;t satisfied with the results, so maximum after a summer break I gave up. I was so afraid of sitting in quiet that even when I started the first yoga practices I used to have back ground music and not necessarily a relaxing one. <br />I did since second time of March more than a dozen of your practices. After this Day 30 video I felt that I need to give it a try and start the Home practice. It do not went so well, like in daily bases cause I made 2 practices/day when I did it and only about 3-5 times/week. I started doing yoga with your help as a woman who just wanna loose weight, but who do not like extreme cardio or weight lifting. I do not tell that this series of practice changed my life, but it definitely showed me a new path, where I do not have to rush it and where I can give myself one-two days to just relax. <br />Practicing yoga I learned some self-acceptance and forgiveness. I learnt that when I feel that I need to take a break to actually do it and to have boundaries at college-studying and at studying. Thank you for your work you do with us!

There really is something about learning and practicing something that soothes you mentally and physically with thousands of like minded strangers. Not once have I read a nasty comment here or anyone bragging or trying to bring themself up above everyone else. I have so much love for this community and am so glad I stuck around to the end of these 30 days. I feel like I&#39;ve gotten a go-to flow of my own from practicing alongside Adrienne but theres so much more I plan to learn :D<br />My next steps are learning the showy moves like baby crow and a headstand.

"Thank you so so much, Adriene! I have completed the 30 days in Lockdown and feel I have gained something very valuable! I missed your voice in this but it was good to see how far I have come, still a long way to go! I need to work on my balance poses!  Can you recommend or offer any advice on what to do now?

Thank you so much for this series. I missed a few times so it took me about a week longer to finish but I really enjoyed it and look forward to doing more. I feel great and it was perfect for quarantine and all the chaos is the world.,Talia Collier,2020-06-20T07:11:58Z,0
"Another 30 days completed and now yoga has a home in my home. Today showed me that I have all that I need to keep this going as my daily routine plus the added bonus of additional guidance to deepen my practice. Thank you Adrienne for your love and kindness, but most of all for that quirky sense of humour that I have come to enjoy at 6am while going through my movements.

I&#39;m taking responsibility for myself first so I can look after my family and do some good in the world. Thank you for what you do Adrienne.

"Honestly when Adriene first said there wasn&#39;t going to be any guidance I was sat on my floor saying oh no oh no oh no, but as soon as we got going I just started doing my own flow with what felt good for my body and doing the poses and sequences I loved. Managed the whole forty minutes on my own, I haven&#39;t been this proud of myself in a long time. Thank you Adriene!",Maddie Hewitt,2020-06-19T10:44:00Z,1

I&#39;m a student and it would be so helpful if you could do a series where each practice is 15 or 20 minutes! I can&#39;t be the only one that finds it difficult to fit the longer ones in and find it a little hard when each one is a different length. A short series would be amazing! I love your yoga so much Adriene it has made a huge difference in my life but this would be so so helpful. xx,everyday Anna,2020-06-19T06:57:24Z,0

"Omg!  Why did I cry at the end of this??? Did anyone else have an emotional response?  I thought, wow, that was tough, but the whole time I had to follow my instincts and make decisions on my own.  I had to sit with my own voice, and in the end, I discovered home is deep within.  And then I just started bawling!  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I felt so afraid of my own potential.  I don&#39;t know if it was because I was felt so in charge of my decision making.  I don&#39;t know if it was because it was the end of a journey that I&#39;m sad to see end.  But overall, I&#39;m hopefull for what comes next.  I&#39;m very thankful for this experience, because throughout the whole thing, Adriene gave us permission to listen to our own bodies.  And as a former dancer, it felt nice toe reconnect with home.",bluscorpion,2020-06-18T22:46:40Z,0
"I started this session with tears streaming down my face, and unfortunately I had to tap out midway because I spent too much time trying to watch (vs listen) and ended up getting entirely too dizzy/queasy (I&#39;ve been struggling with that throughout the entire journey)  but I sat and watched in awe and she flowed through the poses so beautifully.  She is absolutely my inspiration and after we get moved and settled, I fully intend to take quite a few more journeys with this beautiful soul.",MaeMaesChannel,2020-06-18T21:32:43Z,0

"I have never in my life stuck to something so religiously as this. I completed the 30 sessions in 30 days and couldn’t feel more satisfied. The last session really surprised me as to how much I have picked up on this journey, your pointers go through my head as I go through the flow. I think the satisfaction comes from the progression and my momentum and dedication and it makes me feel happy.  Thank you Adriene for making yoga a habit to me and no longer the odd session I do at the weekend, the daily practice has shifted how I see yoga now. You are an incredible teacher. ❤️",Jade Caton,2020-06-18T12:01:09Z,0

"I did this video today. The best part was Benji. You took the time during the session to give him love and that warmed my heart! He&#39;s such a doll! But, I must admit, I&#39;m not a fan of the last day with no mic. I can&#39;t see you, and I don&#39;t know automatically where you will be moving to. I&#39;m so used to closing my eyes and hearing you lead me through. Today, I had my head turned to the tv even in odd positions just to see where you headed next. It wasn&#39;t relaxing for me. It&#39;s ok, though. I will check out your other videos now that HOME is done for me, and maybe learn some background on Benji!",Gina Lynn Guesby,2020-06-18T02:15:42Z,0

"So Adriene today i finished the 30 days of Yoga, i started while i was in quarantine but then i went back to work and i thought that i won&#39;t be able to continue but somehow every day when i went back home from work and even though I&#39;m exhausted i find myself starting your video and just do it, i wasn&#39;t sure that i would be able to finish it this time because it&#39;s 40 minutes but i did it. And i can tell that there&#39;s a huge difference in my body from the day i started, the moves that once were killing me, now i do them with ease so thank you so much i want to keep doing yoga as a life style and i hope i will. Lots of love for you Adriene from Alexandria, Egypt ❤️❤️",Youmna Nader,2020-06-17T21:10:51Z,0

As a newbie this has opened me up, literally, physically, mentally. Adriene, it always feels as if you’re talking to me directly and that I am your friend, and I’m so grateful because I don’t have a lot of those.  I’m a bit stretchier, a bit more flexible and I breathe a lot more than I used to! Thank you! Onto the next adventure... 🙏🧘‍♀️✨",Samantha Tyler,2020-06-17T16:01:09Z,776

"Hi Adriene, thank you so much and to all the people in your team. I never thought that I would be able to make it this far. At first, I thought I would just try it and will eventually lose interest and stop. But that never happened. Every day, every practice, made me appreciate my life and the lives around me even more. Thank you so much for guiding me in trusting myself again. Thank you.<br /><br />Also, I would like to thank the people in this community. You are all awesome and wonderful people. I learned a lot from the stories you have all been sharing. It is always beautiful to witness kindness, support and compassion as I read through the comment section. We may all be from different places, but we will always have stories that will bring us together. <br /><br />Let&#39;s continue on this journey together. <br />Thank you everyone.",Tin Tin,2020-06-17T04:37:26Z,0
"I had never done yoga before, and I decided to try these videos to keep me going during quarantine. The first few were a huge challenge, even just hanging my head upside down for forward fold made me lightheaded. Now I feel much more comfortable and like I have so much room to grow! I finally found a physical activity that I will make time for in the day. Thank you for always being so kind.",Nuttynicole11,2020-06-17T02:21:40Z,0

"You know, I panicked a little when I was watching the first bit while I did my scar care and hormone application and Adriene was like, &quot;You&#39;re DIYing it today kids but I believe in you and I&#39;m here if you need me!&quot;. I wondered what the hell I was going to do but then I though that this was cool because it took the pressure off me to keep up with the video and I knew I had poses that I liked despire being a total beginner. So I just went with whatever popped into my head and took the pressure off myself. I didn&#39;t always hugbmy lower ribs in, I didn&#39;t breathe right in places but that&#39;s ok because it was a journey and an experience. As soon as I started in mountain pose and then raised my arms up I felt this huge rush of emotion and I knew I&#39;d be ok. Like Adriene said, I had the tools she&#39;d given me. I can do it. I had to look a few times to get ideas for where my flow was going which was cool. <br /><br />Maybe my journey home was realising that I can do stuff on my own amd I&#39;m capable of guiding myself and I won&#39;t fuck it up.",Jak Ateara,2020-06-16T14:58:19Z,0

"I found this channel by accident and because I was suffering back pain. After 2 days of back work out, I moved on to Adriene’s 1st 30-day challenge. I have bought yoga packages before, but I never had such determination to follow through, but with Adriene - I finished 30 days! I started with apprehension today, I was so surprised to know that I can actually complete it. Today was a tough workout but I loved it and was overwhelmed by the confidence she has unknowingly instilled in me. Thank you for the selfless sharing of your knowledge Adriene and Chris. Appreciative of your giving heart and your actions spur me to also want to pass it forward. Love from Singapore.",sqweeling,2020-06-16T08:02:12Z,0

"Oh, Adrienne. I&#39;ve been a silent lurker here since I&#39;ve started doing yoga for the first time ever with this journey. But during the practise, a thousand thoughts were popping into my head, and I felt like I needed to write something afterwards.<br />It was magical. I truly cannot say how much yoga have changed me, physically and mentally. I&#39;ve had a tumultuous period with my studies this year, and starting this practise about a month ago was a way to deal with the stress. Fitting is also how the 30th day came up with the day of my final exam, and I&#39;m ending the whole year with a beautiful practise. :)<br />When I heard at the beginning that you won&#39;t speak a thing in Day 30, I was hesitant, almost as if I was a child who&#39;s getting sent to school by a mother for the first time. But it all disappeared in the first 5 minutes. The music and the flow connected me with you, and all the people practising, like never before. There&#39;s something in the silent, thoughtful, mirrored movement that serves as a wonderful communication tool, and it felt even more like coming home.<br />I teared up when I realized the music I&#39;ve started associating with &quot;victory dopamine boost&quot; that&#39;s usually at the end of the videos is playing alongside some of the harder parts of the practise. It&#39;s so metaphorical, and so freeing, to see our hardships as something to take courage and strenght from, maybe even happiness!<br />I also noticed that thorough this practise I didn&#39;t complain in my head even once. Not with the boats, or the plank pushups - I simply acknowledged that they were part of the Journey, and calmly prepared myself, knowing that I can do my best, and it will be enough. And I can already feel how his tremendously helping this mindset will be in day-to-day life.<br />I could write a whole book of praising here, honestly. I kinda just did, haha. But I wanted to leave it here. I&#39;m definitely carrying on doing yoga with you, and the 30 days were just the freshest of starts. Thank you. :)",Marcelina Sak,2020-06-15T20:10:35Z,0

I have come to be at such peace with myself with your help; to feel loved and supported from the inside to the outside.<br />I&#39;ve never thought I would be able to freestyle a practice of my own. But I did it, and it felt amazing and fulfilling. I took a few peeks at you and at some times we were doing the same thing.

"Yesterday, I messed up in my life in a way that I really broke my own heart. It was hard for me to show up today. I was trying so hard to avoid being alone with my thoughts. Little did I know, Adriene would have today&#39;s practice be a silent unguided one. I cried so much. I felt so pain get felt, validated, and released. I forgave myself. I held space for myself. <br /><br />I have been doing yoga and teaching it for years. This is the number one hands down best yoga experience I&#39;ve ever had. Adriene thank you for what you do.<br /><br />I&#39;ve realized that in life, &quot;mistakes&quot; are inevitable. I am always doing the best I can. I can&#39;t beat myself up to success.

"I&#39;m another who started and finished this journey home during quarantine. This was absolutely what I needed. I am a Theater and Dance major, so I have a physical practice built into my days through Jazz, Ballet, Modern, movement classes and physical theater. I feel so lucky and grateful to have found this journey home. I was so desperately missing the connection with my body that I had known consistently for the past 3 years of my education. Having my routine and my physical practice suddenly taken away left me feeling confused and frustrated. I felt like a stranger in my body. Through this journey I have learned that being distracted by long days and rehearsals, dancing constantly and going to the gym to maintain my instrument is not the same thing as a loving connection with my body. Working myself to exhaustion is not the same as finding what feels good. I always struggle when Adriene asks me to surprise myself. What do I have to offer that&#39;s surprising or new? How can I do that when I&#39;m a beginner and still learning? Well, today in this silent practice - I absolutely surprised myself. Thank you, Adriene. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",Abigail Rosen,2020-06-13T18:47:11Z,0
I cried literally when I finished this yoga home journey and heard your intro music on the last part.i just Cant believe it I finished this journey. thank you adrienne. I’ll start the revolution 30 day yoga tomorrow 😍,Michelle Emee,2020-06-13T13:05:20Z,0
"I genuinely loved this series. I had some tough times during the journey however always managed to make up for missed classes whether it was doing double the next day or squeezing it in when I had room, it was frustrating I will admit so the last thing I expected was to be so moved emotionally on this last lesson. I don’t know if you’ll read this however I found your channel through a meditation video of yours and instantly subscribed, when I found this series I was a complete noob at yoga (I’m sure i’m still barely scratching the surface) so it was a little daunting to tackle however i’m glad I did. Thank you for this and I will be looking forward to future videos and steams!",C h u m p,2020-06-13T12:32:35Z,0

This was so amazing. I am really grateful! I am even a bit crying:) as if tomorrow I won&#39;t open another video of yours... but if really feels like achieving something here.<br />As many I started this journey during the lockdown, but I&#39;ll try to keep the habit of practicing with you and Benji even later &lt;3 <br />All the best &lt;3",dididadei,2020-06-13T09:21:33Z,0

"Wow. I was really nervous and scared when I found out that this was going to be all on our own and I didn&#39;t know how I was going to do it, but then I just started doing the yoga poses that feel good for me and what felt right in the moment and kept continuing to do them one after another, remembering previous sequences we have done. I worked to not look at the time or what she was doing for reference at all and just do my own thing. I decided to lay on my back to finally get in that meditative state and eventually it felt like it was time to get up. Little did I know when I opened my eyes Adriene too was sitting up from her last pose and bringing her hands to heart center. It felt like I had only been doing yoga for 15 minutes. It&#39;s crazy how things can work out just right sometimes if you just believe in yourself without question.",Caroline Taylor,2020-06-12T17:04:15Z,0

Tears welled up in my eyes, and I&#39;ve never been someone to cry from a positive feeling. In that moment I felt more in tune with my body and my self than I probably ever have.<br /><br />This series has turned me into a complete believer in the practice, and I never want to go another day without taking this time again.

"Adriene, Thank you for this practice. Completed in the past month of quarantine while also at the tail end of a year-long divorce process, your instruction, humor and smile helped to keep me grounded and remember to take care of myself.

I didn&#39;t expect to get noticeably stronger and flexible but especially didn&#39;t expect to gain such an appreciation for my body and mind. <br /><br />I kinda freaked out when you said you wouldn&#39;t wear a mic today, but as I started to breath it just happened. I kept hearing your voice but also my own, and I surprised myself when at the end I felt so much love for my body and myself.

"I can&#39;t believe I cried in the end!! Wow, I don&#39;t even know where to begin but honestly, this yoga journey changed my life. I&#39;m 23 and I feel like I never really accomplished anything, I never finished anything... I&#39;ve started so many things that I was super excited in the very first days and then eventually ended up giving up. I thought this yoga journey was going to be another one of those things... even though I was promising myself I was going to make it till the end, there was this part of me that was sure I was not going to finish it. But well... I made it!!!! First I was starting the videos after midnight because I was waking up really late and watching tv shows all day so after midnight was when I had time, but after day 5 or something I decided I was going to do it in the mornings so I started to wake up early just to do the yoga and then during the day I also started to do more productive things. Slowly, in these 30 days, I went from somebody who would wake up at 2 p.m, stay all day in bed eating and watching Netflix and then go to bed after 4 a.m to somebody who wakes up 8 a.m, does yoga every morning, works out in the afternoon 4 times a week, studies every day for at least 4 hours, spends time with the family and goes to bed at 22 p.m. I feel like I woke up to actually living again and I honestly believe it was all because of yoga. Thank you, Adriene. Thank you. Now my goal is doing yoga every day until the end of the year and I look forward to writing again how that changed me :)",Amanda Fernandes,2020-06-11T13:15:04Z,0
This is the first time I&#39;ve done a day 30 and I was not expecting that. At first I didn&#39;t feel prepared and my brain went into blanking mode but having the video helped a bit.

I hadn&#39;t realized just how much this experience has helped me connect to myself until that moment I heard the Yoga With Adriene theme music playing and all the hours spent on my mat came rushing back in a flood of sunshine and tears, and I realized that perhaps that whole gorgeous score <b>is</b> the theme song much as the moments of beauty on my yoga mat are not separate from the rest of my life but are instead interwoven with it. What an honor &amp; a blessing to have Adriene and Benji as cosmic tour guides on this wonderful adventure! Much love!! 💚",meleakua,2020-06-10T13:31:22Z,0
I made it through day 7 and won’t be back. Adrienne does not show modifications well enough for those of us not thin as a twig like her.

While I understand the theory of you removing the microphone, I found it incredibly frustrating and uncomfortable to keep twisting to view the screen to see what you were leading us to do!

"Today I finished Home and I just wanted to express my thanks to Adrienne for this amazing resource that she offers to us all so generously! It is my first time doing yoga and I thoroughly enjoyed each and every session, even on the days I struggled! Like so many others here one of my favorite things to do was read the comments every day after I had finished, and before today I never really could relate to those who said they cried during these sessions - but today I got it! I had such a release of happy tears at the end of today’s video! And also when the Home theme music played in full 😭 Although the silent video was challenging I really, really enjoyed it, and yes I spent most of the session looking at the screen to see what was next, but I couldn’t believe the ease with which I was able to transition between movements, and that I kept it up for 40mins!! I can’t wait to move on to one of the other 30 day series next :) Thank you Adriene, much love from Ireland 😊🇮🇪💚 (ps - does anybody know the name of the piece of music used for the Home intro/ending??

"Wow, that was quite the journey. As with so many others, I only even thought about yoga once in lock down. This journey has done so much for me, in awareness of my body and posture, in focusing on my breathing and how important the breath is. I too struggled to get a flow without verbal cues today, but feel I got a lot from the session. It wasn&#39;t perfect, but then I have never even attended a class. (I intend to as soon as we are allowed!!) I am sure I don&#39;t get the best out of all the positions, because they need tweaking and practising, but this journey has made me realise that it will all come in good time and to go with what feels good. My intent was to find calm in myself, after a tough few months before we all got grounded. I found this process healing and enlightening and intend to continue this journey for a lot longer.<br />It always surprises me that when Adriene says &quot;I love you all&quot;, you know and feel the truth and warmth of it.

"Empece este viaje en cuarentena y la verdad que no me arrepiento :&#39;) lo empece llena de ansiedad esperando cada practica a que terminara, chequeando cada minuto cuanto faltaba. A mitad del viaje, ya empece a relajarme y dejarme ir, y al final siento que conocia los tiempos de Adriene y sabia por donde iba y cuanto me faltaba. Aprendi a enfocar mi vida desde otra perspectiva, llena de paciencia y paz. Me comprometi por completo y no me arrepiento &lt;3",Camila Delgado,2020-06-07T22:41:26Z,0

"I loved this course and feel like it definitely helped me recommit to yoga for the long haul. I sympathize with those that were thrown off by the lack of vocal cues (I felt like I was often awkwardly contorted trying to see the screen or anxious about falling behind, unable to fully relax and flow) but I appreciate the intention behind it and think it&#39;s a very valuable final practice. I found myself wishing for maybe a small chime or another subtle indicator to switch sides/postures but I ultimately felt this was a wonderful final step of our journey home.

"Living in another country for 3 years now and my dog passed away 2.5 months ago. I could not go back to the Philippines due to the pandemic; I felt like I never really got to process her passing properly. This Home journey has helped me so much with my anxiety and probably the only thing I made sure to commit to during quarantine. When Benji came over at ~37 mins, tears suddenly started to come out of nowhere and I couldn&#39;t stop crying, basically going through the last 4mins n tears. There is some sort of calmness (albeit sad at the same time). What a journey. Thank you, Adriene. ❤️",Jan Herrera,2020-06-07T10:38:36Z,0

"Throughout much of this class, I kept thinking to myself, “I don’t like this!&quot; I felt uncomfortable, uncertain, even scared. But it was in that discomfort that I began to notice some pretty important things. <br /><br />I have a huge fear of missing out that hinders me from being brave and doing things differently, or even asking myself what I want to do. I’m afraid of not belonging, or being on my own. I kept glancing at my screen to see what Adriene was doing so that I could follow along, losing focus of the integrity of the poses, of my breath, of staying present.<br /><br />I don’t know how to follow or even feel my intuition, or maybe I just don’t trust myself enough to do so.<br /><br />I’m a perfectionist, and get caught up with the minute intricacies of whether or not I am doing something right.<br /><br />I’m afraid of doing things wrong, and resistant to try new things on my own.<br /><br />I still don’t know how to do anything with ease and grace. Especially failure.<br /><br />I struggle with truly being mindful and present.<br /><br />I am very hard on myself.<br /><br />My mind always feels like it’s running a hundred miles per hour, and when I am left alone with myself, the uncertainty I feel only brings in the chaotic thoughts even more persistently.<br /><br />But in the silence of this class, I also found that it turns out I&#39;m stronger than I realized I was. Doing just a little bit every day for the past thirty days has led to results that surprised me.<br /><br />It was only in the last few minutes that I asked myself for the first time, “What do I want to do?” and began to diverge from what Adriene was doing. It felt terrifying, and also exhilarating, to be making my own choices and trusting myself.<br /><br />I may not have liked this class at the beginning, but I sure as hell needed it. If anything, this last day taught me the ways in which I need to grow. I began to tear up when the quote from John O’Donohue showed up at the end. <br /><br />Although I did not enjoy how I felt during much of it, today&#39;s class ended up feeling like magic when it was over. Looking back, this might be the best experience I’ve had in the past thirty days.<br /><br />I am so grateful, Adriene. Thank you for helping me catch my own magic. &lt;3",Niki,2020-06-06T02:23:57Z,0

I am usually a silent watcher on YouTube but I have to sincerely thank you Adriene. I started this journey to try help with my PCOS and endometriosis but it&#39;s given me so much more. Today I was finally able to keep my feet flat during downward dog and I felt myself get so emotional. I cannot wait to start another one of your 30 day journeys 💕  You&#39;re a true gem 💕,Megan M,2020-06-05T12:25:08Z,0
"I love adriene with all my heart and I was so happy to see benji wandering around -- and so did my dog who always watches the screen intently. I want to preface by saying I really do love everything about ywa; I tell everyone about this amazing corner of youtube like a town crier and I&#39;m buying myself my first ever ~subscription~ to the fwfg community for my birthday this monday. My boyfriend and friends are for sure tired of me dropping yoga into every conversation so they all began practicing to appease me. Surprise! They have now joined the cult of everyday practice and are now the town criers to their own circles :)<br />I do feel like I failed this one though.  I knew the second I read no mic that this wasn&#39;t going to go well for me. I&#39;m seeing themes of this in some comments too. I am a perfectionist in recovery so not &#39;nailing&#39; every pose or landing on time really got to me. I was out of sync with my breath and body and really in my head. Which is beyond ironic as ywa -- specifically this home journey -- have pushed me along the path of self acceptance and confidence. This journey is nothing but remarkable and it came right on time for me but I was frustrated today. And I feel like a toddler crying from frustration simply because I didn&#39;t cry from joy or relief like the others. I&#39;m not sure where to go from here; should I try this practice or the entire 30 days again? Did I miss the rules, should I be doing my own movements? Or should I be trying to keep up? Was I not ready? Or am I not zen or trusting enough to have finished correctly? Did I not find the right home? Because it feels as if I had my bags packed and ready to move in but I don&#39;t have the keys to the door.<br />Okay, I digress. This is not a bash on the ywa community or adriene herself. I have nothing but love and respect for everyone and their mats but it seems jealousy has wiggled its way in as well. I need my fellow perfectionists in the comments to know they aren&#39;t alone. Not sure I have any advice to comfort us but I definitely feel the same way. @khadija zaheer @ajmonkeyflash @Archie &amp; Alfie @Steph anie @Kathy Moseley",Miranda,2020-06-05T11:44:45Z,0

I appreciate this entire journey.  Half to say this was the only time I quit.  I&#39;ve never taken a class or did a yoga video wherein the instructor is silent.  There was familiar moments but I was constantly resting my knees to look at the video or compromising form or my neck to look at the video and decided I will chose another one of your videos for the last day instead. Sorry but I just didn&#39;t like no mic day.  The best classes/teacher are when I can do the entire lesson without having to look at the screen and just following the ques and reminders.

"To all the people who are doing the yoga journey for the first time: you did great. Even if you peaked at Adriene a thousand times. You did great.<br />I think this is my third yoga journey and still remember my first time. How betrayed and lost I felt, doing yoga without Adriene&#39;s voice to guide me. Today, I still wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;ll be able to do it alone, but I did. It was beautiful and messy and I lay on my back at least like 3 times, but I did all 40 minutes by myself. It gets better. Believe me. YOU get better at listening to your body and your inner voice. And then, it feels amazing. Namaste ❤️",Dorotea Ivanković,2020-06-04T21:34:11Z,0

"I am so proud of myself for finishing the 30 day journey. It &#39;s been years since I practiced any yoga.  I loved each day, but I have to say that I am not a big fan of day 30 and how it was presented.  I found that I was rushing into each pose and had to keep arching my neck or watch the screen to see what was coming next.  I find Adriene&quot;s voice calming, so not to hear her encouragements left me feeling like I couldn&#39;t keep up.  Perhaps Adriene could have 2 versions of 30 days, one with her commentary and one without.  I lost a bit of self confidence with day 30.",Lorna Ferguson,2020-06-03T14:11:17Z,0

However, I am proud that I managed to do some of it alone, remembering what we did during the series. It&#39;s gonna take more work for me to be able to do 40 minutes of yoga with no guidance but I&#39;m ready to do that work and maybe next time, I&#39;ll be able to.

"You have options to do it your way, explore what poses and how you’d like to move or to follow her or find inspirations from her movement. Even if it is a child pose, a Long shavasana, a cat and cow etc  what you find feels good to you you put it in your 40 mins.",Bobo Rudy,2020-06-03T16:10:58Z,0

"Thank you. It has been an incredible 30 days. 33 for me to be exact... I missed a few. Definitely so grateful for this free journey and your guidance. My practice for the past couple years has been 5min daily sun salutation so this definitely took it farther. I noticed right away how I was more aware of my balance and posture throughout the day.  And today, how impressed how far I&#39;ve come. So thank you. And thank you for your words of encouragement. Excited to see where  I&#39;ll go next...",Andrea Perch,2020-06-02T11:46:45Z,0

"This might be my first Youtube comment ever. This Home series was so calming and brought so much fulfillment to my life during such a stressful and uncertain time in this world. Like many others, I would scroll through the comments at the end of every practice and didn&#39;t think I would end up relating to those that said they cried during or after the practice, but in the last 10 days I have found myself crying during several of these sessions and feeling a release of emotion that I didn&#39;t even know was there. Thank you Adriene for this gift. I am a lifelong fan and will be dropping in to your monthly calendars for a long time to come.",Samantha Daza,2020-06-01T19:56:46Z,108
"Somewhere in the video I broke into tears, I somehow associated the title of this video, the postures with life itself and the time we&#39;re all going thru these days, I&#39;m just going thru a breakup, but the last month wasn&#39;t the best with my ex, I found your channel around the same time, and it has given me something to look forward everyday. I started practicing yoga about 10 yrs ago but had not been consistent in the last few years, quarantine brought me back to it!

"Thank you, Adriene! You have found something inside me that I didn&#39;t know I have. Like a hidden treasure that I didn&#39;t have a map for. Now, I&#39;m slowly uncovering a need that seemed to be dormant for years. I&#39;m not sure why or how but your practice often uncovered unexpected emotions that I didn&#39;t know existed within me. It has been my pleasure to join you and thank you once again for what turned out to be much more than an exercise program :)  I&#39;m for sure going to continue on this journey.",Lenka Tvarůžková,2020-06-01T17:49:30Z,0

I had no idea that this was the last day tradition. Maybe just add captions or something. You move so so fast. All I did was have a panic attack. I get that I am supposed to make the decisions within the move but some people can&#39;t make that leap straight into silence.,Starlyght1,2020-06-01T13:31:55Z,2
I found my way home and this was a beautiful practice &amp; part way thru I found myself crying. Happy tears &amp; sad tears and all the emotion just began pouring out. Happy tears just cause i was proud and amazed at me able to do all of this &amp; sad because the journey home was at its end. I won’t stop practicing tho and as this journey ends i look forward to starting a new one. Thank you so so much Adriene &amp; Yoga with Adriene community.

"This was really hard for me. I felt like I couldn&#39;t really relax into any of the poses  or close my eyes because I would miss what would come next. I even broke down and cried because  I was so angry that this last practice didn&#39;t have any cues. I finished it, because I said I would, but I had so many bad thoughts coming up during it. I struggle a lot with my body image and perfectionism, so just being alone with my thoughts like &quot;you didn&#39;t do this plank properly&quot; &quot;you&#39;re lagging behind again&quot; was so difficult. I realised how much I rely on Adriene to tell me that it&#39;s okay if I can&#39;t do a chaturanga, it&#39;s okay if I don&#39;t do it perfectly.<br />But all in all, I really enjoyed Home, even though I didn&#39;t do it 30 days in a row. I just still have a really long way to go practicing being kind to myself.",Anna Maria,2020-06-01T08:32:30Z,252
"Thank you for writing this; I felt so abandoned when I pressed play looking forward to it being the last one and then just anxiety and panic when she said it&#39;ll be on our own :( I didn&#39;t get it at all, I didn&#39;t even understand whether we were supposed to do what she did or just our own thing. I felt as if I was dropped in the deep end and expected to know how to swim when I absolutely did not feel ready for that yet.. Cried throughout. I just wanted it to end so that I could at least say to myself that I finished everything. Out of all 30 days this is the only one that I&#39;ve wanted to go into child&#39;s pose and stay there for the whole 40 minutes, just because I was so not prepared and the panic took me by surprise. I&#39;m a bit of a perfectionist too, and I really really don&#39;t deal well with feeling unprepared and not good enough... Such a low end for me, to what&#39;s otherwise been such an amazing journey 😞",Nora - Lifeinvetschool,2020-12-30T20:04:46Z,3
"I had such a hard time with this and bailed at minute 27. I have vertigo and craning my neck for any significant amount of time reactivates it and makes me dizzy and sick. I also never fully got into the postures bc I had to keep checking. I&#39;m so disappointed that I couldn&#39;t finish this. I&#39;ll literally be sick if I do. 😥<br /><br />I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only one, though. Virtual hugs to anyone else who had to stop.",Christiana Sherrill,2020-12-13T21:44:18Z,2
Me too! I felt like I had made so much progress over the first 29 days but this session broke me after 10 minutes. I couldn&#39;t close my eyes and listen to my body because I had to keep turning to the screen to see what comes next. I broke down and cried for half an hour and now I feel so discouraged about the last month.I wanted to start another 30 day program straight away but I feel... betrayed in a way.,Natalie Clement,2020-12-08T07:27:15Z,2

"What a disappointing way to end what has been an otherwise wonderful 29 days. Not sure why this is a tradition since it seems more aggravating than anything else. I spent more time looking at the video trying to see poses and transitions we were doing than actually, consciously doing them. I would have 100% preferred an audio-only video rather than tearing my focus and gaze away from what I was doing every five seconds - completely ruined the flow that I have been practicing for the last 29 days. Would give the Home series an A- only because this last was such a let down. Really hoping this tradition ends here.",Christina Samurkas,2020-05-31T21:34:31Z,0

"What an amazing journey - I have practised Ashtanga yoga for 2 years and have just found you as I have a couple of injuries and wanted a ‘lower level’ yoga.  When you said what today’s surprise was I panicked, I followed you to start with and then ‘found what feels good’ <br />- it felt so liberating to to be able to my own thing instead of structured moves in sequence and when we happened to do the same move at the same time, I smiled!

The response I get is always positive and they tell me how you&#39;re helping them with their communication skills as much as their physical and mental health (I&#39;m sure the phrase &quot;Hey yo!&quot; has a universal meaning across many cultures! :-D )<br />I comment on a lot of your videos but still just wanted to say how grateful I am for what you share with the world.<br />Keep shining that amazing light, Adriene!

"As I was feeling anxious and sad during quarantine, I knew I needed to do something for myself.  That something became yoga.  This is the first 30 day challenge I’ve completed, and I have grown in ways I never imagined.  I am turning 50 in one week, and my body has changed a lot in recent  years.  With your help, I discovered that my body is so much stronger and more capable than I thought.  I have come to accept and love my body more than ever before.  Thank you for that, and thank you for the gentle, sweet, calm start to my days as I’ve had to facilitate my kids’ learning these past weeks.  I know it made a huge impact on my mental and emotional state as well.  I missed your sweet voice today, but I get it.  I knew the poses, the flow, and how to breathe through the poses.  Thank you for helping me discover that. Looking forward to spending more time learning and improving. 💕",Angie Johnson,2020-05-30T17:30:43Z,0

"Yep, I did not enjoy this practice. Maybe it&#39;s trust, maybe it&#39;s confidence or maybe it&#39;s something else. But with no audio or visual (I don&#39;t wear glasses when practicing because they keep sliding off my face) cues...I was completely lost. And I felt frustrated. Like @ajmonkeyflash said: this definitely felt like an exam I wasn&#39;t prepared for. Sigh. Quit at the 20 minute mark because I didn&#39;t have a clue as to what to do....so I went back to another day. Sorry Adrienne but I think this one will definitely require a lot more time and work.",Khadija Zaheer,2020-05-30T16:46:11Z,7

"Ngl when I realised that Adriene wasn&#39;t going to be talking us through it I panicked and figured I might get about 20 mins in then give up, but once I started I was amazed at how much I remembered. No, it wasn&#39;t perfect, sometimes I forgot to breathe and I had to keep glancing back at the video to see if what I was doing was vaguely right, but it felt good. There was a fair amount of freestyle and I spent more time on my back than doing flows, but that was what felt right for me today and I really enjoyed it. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever completed a 30 day challenge and I feel so proud and motivated to continue.

"This practice was so powerful for me. I&#39;ve never finished a 30 day before, so I wasn&#39;t expecting the last day and leading my own practice. Initially I found myself watching a lot, but then I remembered the practices to explore movements that feel good, and found myself going back to favorite poses I&#39;d forgotten. I didn&#39;t think I could fill a whole 40 minutes, but I did. It was my strongest practice yet and I ended with tears streaming down my face. Thank you Adrienne, for making the journey home not seem so scary. 💕💕💕",iluv2cheer176,2020-05-29T18:29:21Z,0
"Adriene... You have totally changed my home practice!! I started watching you at the beginning of the year sporadically, and quarantine coupled with your videos has helped me journey back into everyday practice.

"From Petaluma, CA: Just finished Day 30 and it was one of the few times I didn&#39;t read the description first. What a surprise - first anxiety, then opening, then magic. In the end I surprised myself. Like others, I discovered you during quarantine, and like others I started out shaky, out of shape, breathless when during every inhale and exhale. My resting heartrate was in the 80&#39;s. Now I just get breathless toward the end. And my resting heartrate is in the high 60&#39;s/low 70&#39;s. I can almost put my heels down in downward dog and I don&#39;t fall over (as much) during the warrior positions. I can do the planks without having to stop. I feel incredibly emotional and empowered as I, in my 50&#39;s, am looking toward my first bachelors degree and research graduate schools. I know we are coming home, but I do feel transformed - my eyes are clearer and my heart is wide open. Thank you Adriene and thank you to this community. I will see you tomorrow! Sending so much love and light.",Janette Morrow,2020-05-29T16:57:09Z,1
"30 incredible days. It was an emotional experience for me, Adriene. Realizing I was able to follow through and do this 5 days every week for the past 6 weeks. Thank you for this gift! I will forever treasure this moment. You are a God-send.",grace strother,2020-05-29T15:46:12Z,1
Yo! Adriene! Words can’t do justice in expressing my gratitude for you and all those involved in making this series. Thank you thank you thank you. You changed my life! I felt like crying at the end. Maybe I will now. And then maybe I’ll keep practicing my new freestyle yoga moves I didn’t know I knew until today. 🙏🏼🥰,Brett Bluestein,2020-05-29T15:12:59Z,1

What an amazing journey. The change has been great from where I started to now. I wasn&#39;t in the best place mentally when I started and I feel these videos have helped in so many ways. Such a beautiful end to the 30 days. Thank you Adriene for helping me &lt;3,Arabella Stewart,2020-05-29T12:40:34Z,1
"I guess I wasn&#39;t open enough for this - it&#39;s really hard to follow a sequence in my laptop without the audio guidance, I kept peeking all the time. I imagine if I had done it on my own, it&#39;d have been much more relaxing and fun. It was a great series with not such a satisfactory finale.",Fernanda Dutra,2020-05-29T11:34:26Z,82
I kinda agree. I come here for a guide because it keeps me motivated to follow the steps and do these poses that I wouldn&#39;t know how to do normally. I&#39;m a beginner and I was frustrated getting to the end to find this. This journey has helped with my anxiety but this last session only triggered it. Like I understand that the message is supposed to be &quot;you have it within you&quot; but imagine you went to an in person yoga class and the instructor said nothing and just did yoga in front of you for 40 minutes. Absolutely not lol,Maija Shea,2020-11-10T05:27:36Z,1
"Have to agree.  29 awesome sessions and one dud, we have no comfort with our personal yoga vocabularies.  So instead, using the video as a huge crutch, we: hurt one neck constantly looking at the screen, we both completely lost track of our breathing, and both of us generally had a miserable experience.  If Adriene had built us toward a &#39;make it up yourself&#39; session instead of springing it on us at the end, our results might have been different.",J K,2020-10-13T20:51:33Z,3
"I definitely agree, I enjoyed this series but to end with a 40 minute unguided session where I couldn’t close my eyes because I had to keep looking at what comes next was not satisfactory at all.",Christine Ling,2020-09-14T03:12:03Z,13
"You&#39;re exactly right! The sequence was not meant for you to follow to the letter, and you are encouraged to &quot;find what feels good&quot; vs &quot;geting it right&quot;. You would definitely enjoy it if you went off on your own even if only loosely resembling Adriene&#39;s sequence (or not at all). I loved it.",Jehan de Guzman,2020-08-27T00:30:49Z,1
"I&#39;m so happy, this is the first Day 30 that I&#39;ve been able to do alone!!! I remember Day 30 of 30 days of yoga, (it was about 5 years ago!?), I felt so lost not having a video to follow and it was impossible to think up things to do which was disappointing and upsetting. Now I finally relish having freedom to do what I want, this was the perfect end to Home for me.<br />To anyone who panicked at this - it comes eventually! You can learn the poses but I found it&#39;s a totally different ball game being able to read what your body needs that day. I hope this marks the beginning of me doing many practices alone. I think at first I&#39;ll still need this video on in the background to help me get ideas when the mind goes blank, but maybe someday I&#39;ll be able to just do it me and my mat... <br />Even though I was able to think of a lovely sequence today I found it hard to be alone with my thoughts without having Adriene to listen to, which I wasn&#39;t expecting. I guess it shows I really need to work on the mindfulness and meditative side of yoga now. Excited to continue on my journey until I am a fully independent yogi! <br />Thank-you so much Adriene! We love you so much too.",Zoe Angel,2020-05-29T11:20:56Z,0
"I had a moment where i was stood at the top of my mat in mountain pose,  I felt lost and totally unsure of what to do next.  My mind started to race and worry and it paralysed me even more.  It took a little time but using my breath i quieted the mind and slowly embraced the stillness.  At that point it all simply became a nourishing and natural part of my flow.<br />I hope reading this can help someone.<br />Cosmic love and shiny vibes to you all. x",Daniel Holmes,2020-05-29T11:09:25Z,2

"I was not expecting to be my own guide for this one, but was pleasantly surprised to find that this was exactly what I needed! My practice looked nothing like Adriene’s except for one point where we were both in the exact same lunge at the same time. But I found what felt good, and good for me was rolling around on the floor in happy baby and even finding myself moving into pigeon. I always thought I needed a teacher or at least a guide for my yoga practice. Today I learned that it all is inside of me, I just needed some help in recognizing that is was there all along. Thank you Adriene!",Sean Householder,2020-05-29T02:19:07Z,0
"I don&#39;t even know what words to say. I kept telling myself I wished I could do yoga without guidance (as much as I love being guided) and here I am doing yoga without guidance. I just read in the description that it is Day 30 tradition but as this is my first 30 days I was not expecting it. I feel so emotional and compelled to comment and engage with my fellow yogis.

"I started back with yoga on this 30 day Home journey in mid-April. My husband of thirty years died unexpectedly on April 24th. He was only 48; our 3 children lost their dad. I was determined to stay on this journey. I wanted to tell you that the last session was cathartic and really made me dig deep within. My first thought was “Noooo I need your voice”. Then you said “you already have the tools”...your encouragement and support lifted me as I cried my way through the yoga session. And I did it. Thank you because I needed to be pushed, I needed to allow myself to let the emotions flow and I needed to be reminded that what I need to survive this is within me. I already have the tools &amp; I will live the best life I can for both of us.",Mmmkay Horn,2020-05-28T19:41:19Z,0

"I just paired this 30 day journey with my 30 day IVF journey. It made the meds and injections feel like a part of this amazing series. It was wonderful to wake up everyday looking fwd to the journey rather than having fear or resistance to it. I highly recommend this series for those women going through IVF. I modified toward the end, eliminated any twists and tummy time, but was able to complete all the way up to day 29 before the surgical procedure of egg retrieval. I did a modified version of day 29 and 3 hrs later I was ready for egg retrieval. I had to wait 48hrs after procedure to do any yoga so today I am happy to say I just finished day 30!<br />The IVF process from beginning to end was a welcomed breeze and I owe it to this series. Very grounding and perfect for this time!! Thank you Adriene. I hope we get some viable embryos but even if we don’t, I will forever remember this time fondly with an empowered and grounded feeling of home. 🙏🙏 Namaste everyone. (If anyone would like to chat about IVF I’m here for you. Feel free to DM me anytime!)<br />~Sara @yosemitesara Instagram and One Straw Farm Life Youtube.",One Straw Farm Life,2020-05-28T19:12:37Z,0

"Hi Adriene! I just wanted to thank you for this beautiful journey. I had done yoga many times before but I never did it daily. This truly was a game-changer as I felt all the benefits yoga can offer. I gained physical strength, more flexibility, peace in my mind, and a true connection with my body. I will for sure continue doing yoga daily (or at least many times a week).<br />Thank you very much!<br />Namaste :)",Constanza Mancebo,2020-05-28T18:43:18Z,0

"I am so grateful I found YWA. This journey home into my body, in the serenity of my own home, was the most beautiful gift of this quarantine. I loved your guidance, your rhythm, your levity. I have to say I loved the last day&#39;s flow and wanted to know if there was a guided version of this flow available anywhere or would you be willing to do one with guidance? <br />I would love to practice this flow with guidance until I can do it with no guidance, but I think I will need another 30 days for that. I would love to make that my next yoga challenge! <br />The Day 30 Home class was a little dangerous for my body because I had to keep peeking at you to follow the sequence in positions that stressed my neck and back to look. I think it would have been helpful to do the same flow fully guided on Day 29, then in silence on Day 30 so we were already familiar with what the flow was. <br />I loved this experience and it has definitely turned me into a loyal YWA yogi who is finding what feels good in her body. Your dharma is a truly a gift to the world. Thank you!",Nora Walsh,2020-05-28T16:25:40Z,0

The good thing about your yoga lessons: I love your style, your humor, your commitment, and on the practical side I like the fact that it is only 30 minutes or so, so I can not vind any excuses that I don&#39;t have the time to do yoga every day.

"Maybe i&#39;m a little late to the party, but i have to say something (english isn&#39;t my mother lenguage, that&#39;s why i never leave a comment, im a little ashamed by my grammar, so, sorry for my bad english).<br />as a 19 year old male i always used to read the comments, there was always this comment saying how beautiful that day&#39;s session was and how it made them cry, i had never undesrstood that, i used to feel tired or energized but not emotional, i&#39;m actually not an emotional person. But today, oh boy, when i read those last words i cried in a way i&#39;ve never done before, i felt weird, i cried for like 5 minutes before regaining composture and then i noticed something... i felt... i felt proud of myself, i still do, i feel so proud of what i&#39;ve just done, 30 days of yoga, i did this for myself, i didn&#39;t told anyone and wasn&#39;t expecting no one to congratulate me because i didn&#39;t did this for nobody else, i did this for myself, when i noticed that, i started crying again, i&#39;ve never felt this way before, everything i have ever done has been done waiting for someone else&#39;s appreciation, this is the first time i have done this completly motivated by self love and self care, and the fact that didn&#39;t abandoned it halfway throw, i still cannot believe i have done it and only thinking about it makes me feel weird and i start crying a little bit again.<br />Adriene, i cannot thank you enough for this, i have never loved myself, i have been through some hard stuff, everyone has, but this gift you gave me is something i&#39;ll treasure forever, you showed me a part of myself that i never thought waspossible, i feel complete for the first time in my life, i&#39;m crying while writting this, thank you so much and thank you to everyone that accompanied me during this 30 days, you all are winners, you deserve so much love in your life, this is just the beggining, you&#39;ll see.",reshirman,2020-05-28T03:34:20Z,0

I started to notice a shift in my thoughts and feelings. I didn&#39;t even know I had a centre until practicing with you haha. Now off the mat I catch myself saying in my mind, &quot;find your centre&quot; all the time. When I started this journey my intention was simply to &quot;breathe deeply&quot;. Now here we are on day 30, and I&#39;ve discovered so many more beautiful things about me!

"Wow, thank you so much Adriene! At first I felt so frustrated trying to follow along without your guidance, but I realised I was doing it all wrong. I rewinded the video and started over, doing whatever it felt right and I was so surprised with how much I could do. I even attempted crow pose and was able to do it for a few seconds (for the first time ever!). I&#39;m so so glad I started this journey, thank you SO much for that!

"I rarely post more than a few words on Youtube. But this young lady is certainly worthy of incredible praise. As a middle-aged guy I never considered yoga, as I am more of a rowing guy at the gym, but in lockdown for a few months I found Adriene on Youtube and off I started on my 30 day yoga journey.<br /><br />Now I must admit, I probably looked ridiculous in my living room on my exercise mat trying to crane my neck to see my tv and wondering how does this lady get into them positions with such ease. But, unperturbed, I ventured on. As I progressed I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it and by day ten I was quoting positions to myself and doing a bit of &#39;free-styling&#39;. Obviously being middle-aged, I forgot to breathe correctly and was &#39;out&#39; when Adriene was &#39;in&#39; and so it went on. <br /><br />But all that did not matter; this quite beautiful lady, who will never know me, gracefully led me on a 30 day journey that has quite frankly been amazing. I am now a fully fledged and committed yoga starter. Now, I must add that all this was on Youtube and quite free and Adriene should be given some high praise for doing this. So much so that I will be purchasing further sessions, as the &#39;girl&#39;s&#39; got to make a living right.<br /><br />So before I sign off, regardless of who you are and or where you are from, if you are just passing through, I urge you to give this a go and it might just change your life. <br /><br />Chris.",Christopher Vincent,2020-05-26T16:42:18Z,0

I&#39;ve been practicing yoga on and off since I was a teenager but this is the first time I&#39;ve committed to doing it so frequently and from home. It goes to show all the tools are there and always have been, its just about making the time and space. I feel stronger, more confident, and ready to start a new challenge.

Before I started doing yoga with your channel which is about a year ago, I had been dealing with sore shoulder and body ache all the time. I was so depressed and sometimes I did not want to go out and see people because of it. Your soft voice, friendly atmosphere, and sense of humor are why I could stick to practice. Yoga with Adrienne changed my view of yoga and healed my body and soul.There are many uncertainty and difficulty around the world right now but the 30th Yoga have power of healing people. I almost cried towards the end because I felt the powerful of yoga and I feel so grateful that I have met this amazing journey. Thank you so much, Adriene!",t ashley,2020-05-25T16:04:54Z,0

On Day 1, my knees were recovering from an overuse injury,  but by Day 30 they’ve made tremendous progress in combination with proper strengthening.  <br /><br />This practice was great and I’m looking forward to 30 more days of mindful movement. <br /><br />Hoping  to inspire others like you one day.

For many personal reasons, this coming home has been incredibly emotional and will be healing ultimately once I’ve worked through what it has revealed. I’m one of the few who found it really difficult not to have the guiding voice in the last one and didn’t manage to sink into it the way I have been. No matter, might even do it again now I don’t need to look so much.

I actually stopped early for a bit, like after day 5, but on day 6 I did yoga for 25 days in a row. I didn&#39;t beat myself up for it and just kept going. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever done an exercise for that many days on my own accord. Now that this is over, I want to keep on going. The practice has taught me a lot: forgiveness, kindness, and love for myself. I plan on going through your channel and doing a video every day.

"I know so many people already said this pretty much but I want to share my experience nonetheless. I started doing Yoga because i was incredibly inflexible, had a bad posture which lead to having struggle with breathing while working out and playing soccer. I must say I really became so flexible I never believed I would ever become in my life and my posture has also gotten much better, but  the most important thing I&#39;ve realized is that Yoga isn&#39;t just stretching. It&#39;s so much more and I&#39;m so grateful for being able to experiencing that. I cried so much at the end of the 40 minutes, when the theme started playing and I saw your smile and then the quote. I felt so loved and not alone it&#39;s honestly incredible. During this journey I also learned how to love and respect myself, which was so hard for me just about one and a half months ago. Thank you for believing in every single one of us and for giving us the chance to do this absolutely great journey. I can&#39;t say how thankful I am. Also I just realized how much I improved in the posture as I was able to hold the crow pose like whaaaat I couldn&#39;t do that at all before. I am sooo proud of me and everyone else who attended this journey and stayed on track for the whole 30 days",Chris Bang Bang,2020-05-23T23:13:05Z,0

Totally agree. I have been wanting to quit and I finally make it to the last day and it was just an out for me to not do it. Staring at the screen the whole time was frustrating so I quit. Oh well. Guess I&#39;m glad it&#39;s over.,Gabriela,2020-06-17T03:42:36Z,1
"Same, it would’ve been far more relaxing to just do my own music and yoga workout rather than trying to strain my neck to keep looking at the screen. I so wanted to finish this, and I tried 3 different times, but hated it and decided it wasn’t worth it.",Christine Lee,2020-06-09T00:31:24Z,2

My absolute favorite thing after every single session was to look through the comments and see the amazing community of people going through this journey with me. It inspired me to know I wasn&#39;t alone and kept me motivated even when I struggled and for that I not only thank Adriene but the entire community.

"Wow, what a curve ball. Finding out this was kind of on our own I didn’t really know how to feel but then the opening played and I was like, “Okay ill just start on my back and sync my breathing”. Then i was like, “Alright, I’ll just do spinal flexions cat/cow into downward facing dog, thats easy to remember”. Then I just went off, on my own, breathing through my movements and really using the vocab we all learnt through the 30 days of our journey, not even really noticing. I just so happen to turn to check what Adriene was doing and it hit me all at once, this feeling that like wow I’m doing this alongside Adriene, I knew I could do it all along, I just had to believe in myself and I just started to cry and cry. Maybe it was the serendipity of the music, or the 30 day journey coming to an end, or everything all at once, I honestly must have cried through my whole practice; tears of happiness and courage, writing this im still tearing up. Thank you so much for bringing a ray of sunshine into our homes for the past month, especially in such crazy times. Please do a 30 day part 2! Lots of ❤️ and take care everyone, we made it🎉🎉🤗",Banjo BE,2020-05-22T20:15:47Z,315

There are no words to express my gratitude for this journey home. You have brought something so beautiful to my life with these practices and what it has awaken inside me. This practice was the perfect milestone for it from my immediate panic in the beginning to realizing my body will tell me the moves and through a beautiful session that ended in tears of happiness and gratitude. I can’t wait to see what’s in store for me next for this truly was just a milestone on a continuing journey. Thank you.,Emilia Unfiltered,2020-05-22T17:35:12Z,0

"Thank You Adriene. I got into your yoga videos during lockdown here in the UK. Yoga is not a very common thing for 22 year old guys to do but I’m loving it and am going to make a daily yoga practice a part of my life long term. I recommend and am also pestering everyone I know and care about to try out your videos, everyone has a responsibility to look after themselves and spend some time in the present moment connecting with who they are at the core, not who they want to be, and not who they were. I’m not a comment person but have now done 2 of your 30 day courses so just thought I should say thank you.",Charlie Moody,2020-05-22T10:18:24Z,0

It was especially amazing to do during this lockdown period, so grateful. Everything you&#39;ve taught me is pure gold. I&#39;m still hanging onto my Intent from Day 2, and will continue to. From the bottom of my heart, thank you, for everything. <br /><br />Please give Benji some more of those loving kisses you give him, from my side. He was so active on the last day! Moving around and coming to give you some return kisses 😘<br /><br />Again, I definitely want to continue this journey, and I do not think I will have the feeling of completing my day without yoga being a part of it.

Practiced day 30 in quarantine in Scotland. Such a beautiful session. Was lovely to just flow in silence actually trusting myself with the moves. At the end though when we were on our backs a huge wave of child nostalgia washed over me for some reason and brought me to tears. Very overwhelming. I’ve realised that the mat is now a huge release to me and I can’t thank you enough Adriene xx,stephy986,2020-05-21T11:53:51Z,0

"When I first heard the intro I was scared.  I&#39;ve only been doing this thirty days how on earth was I supposed to do it with no guidence?  But once I started I somehow immediatly knew what to do, what I needed. Downward dog was easier than it has ever been and I could breathe deep for the first time in it.  I was able to warrior without needing to hold onto something for balance.  I knew what I needed.  I&#39;m so sad it&#39;s over.  It&#39;s hard to even think there was a time without yoga.

"Today i’ve finished this 30 day yoga. It gave me confidence and found a new kind of love for myself. Just yesterday I was frustrated because I’ve been trying to lose some weight and my progress was going well until i checked yesterday that I did not have any kind of progress this week. I thought if i continued working hard, i eventually have results. And that thinking made me proud but as i did the last day for this yoga program, i realized that, i may have forgotten my roots and it clouded my perception of what progress it. My last day doing this yoga grounded my feet when I was feeling invincible and I realized my faults and I was happy I did. I am proud to say that I garnered more patience and my understanding of things had been broad. This totally humbled me. Thank you!",Chip Yellidon,2020-05-21T02:18:58Z,0
"Hi Adrienne, this was my first try at yoga and I made it to day 30. I feel defeated and frustrated by this last episode.

It was very uncomfortable having to look up every 30 seconds to see where you were going. Really disappointing.",Jacob,2020-05-21T02:18:00Z,1

I said to myself I was just going to follow Adriene for simplicity&#39;s sake. But I found myself finding what felt good, moving through my own vinyasas, even remembering the yogi names for the poses. I peeked at Adriene and at the end I found myself on my side in a fetal position, and cried about how much yoga and Adriene has changed my life and made this pandemic bearable.

"I cannot thank you enough, Adriene. Out of all the challenges that I got constantly bombarded with all over social media during quarantine, this is the only one that I was able to show up to, every single day, without hesitation and without a minute of doubt - and this is something huge coming from someone who was never into yoga, but was mildly interested in it. Thank you for making this practice accessible to everyone. This has become the only part of my day that I genuinely look forward to, and I cannot wait to start your other &quot;journeys&quot; on youtube. Your voice guided me throughout the entire practice today. You were in my mind through it all saying gently that &quot;I am strong&quot; and that I need to &quot;breathe lots of love in and lots of live out&quot; while also reminding me that &quot;I shouldn&#39;t take more than what I need&quot;. Thank you so much, lots of love to you and Benji.",Farida Qtaishat,2020-05-19T19:38:24Z,0
Thank you so much Adrienne! I’ve been following you for years. Last year was my first 30 day challenge and this year I didn’t think I was gonna do it. But quarantine sure changed that for me. Showing up everyday really helped me through some tough days with my anxiety and depression. I fell off for two weeks but I’m so happy I came back and finished! I broke down crying during this practice and for the first time it was a cry full of joy and love. You have no idea how much this means to me. Thank you 💖,Saada Uh,2020-05-19T19:13:30Z,0
"Thank you so much from my wee spot in NZ. First time I have ever completed an exercise challenge and I love it. 30 days straight. I feel so proud of myself. You are amazing, Adriene. Thank you for all you do for the wellbeing of others. Certainly the start of a journey home for me. So excited for more. Namaste!",Rachael Linklater,2020-05-19T18:29:24Z,0
"I really feel that I&#39;m back my self , I&#39;m not the same person i was 30 days  before,  I found my self I learned how to love my body again , I realised that I&#39;m stronger than I thought, I have love power and energy to take care of my self , I feel home , thank you  ❤",Amira abh,2020-05-19T18:10:43Z,0
"Thank you so very much Adriene. Today We complete our 30 days together. I feel such a deep connect with you... It was such a beautiful feeling reaching the end of this journey. <br />I will start with another 30 Day series. Unsure which one to take on... I want to shed off some post partum weight. Should I go with the Yoga Camp, Revolution or Dedicate  Any suggestions fellow Yogis... Do share .  <br />So much love to each of you on your journey of self love &amp; connection !! 💕💕💕 My heart to yours .

"This practice has really changed my whole perspective of yoga. I&#39;ve been doing yoga on and off for about 5/6 years and I feel the most grounded and humbled by this journey. I have a whole new connection with my mindset, my breath, rooting through my feet, so many different things but most important of all I re-discovered my belief in myself. It feels like the most humbling and beautiful journeys are the ones were you realize you had everything you needed all along.

"I’ve completed all days of Home and when I started day 30 if I’m honest I nearly didn’t do it- I didn’t think I could, or I wouldn’t enjoy it without being verbally guided....but I went for it anyway and wow- I knew more than I thought! I could hear Adrienne guiding me through the moves and yes I do have to look at the screen a few times but those 40 mins just flew by. I felt super emotional at the end. Thank you Adrienne! I need more now though- what’s next?!",Ellie Belly,2020-05-19T12:28:01Z,0
"Scrolling down through comments to see who just finished the 30 day journey on the same day as me : ) Feels like a graduating class! I was definitely super nervous and skeptical like many others to do this &quot;on my own&quot;, but I&#39;m so glad I went for it, and me 1 month ago would have had nooooo idea what to do, so that&#39;s pretty incredible! I don&#39;t want to stop doing yoga every day, it has brought so much joy into my daily routine. I&#39;m so excited to curate a daily practice going forward!

The practice gave me a few moments to feel at home..with my thoughts, with my feelings and with my desires during these times of a raging pandemic. I noticed I could move better too today through some of the asanas that were tough for me earlier.<br /><br />Thanks Adriene. What makes your teaching style unique from others is your focus on the breath, inclusion of the mind and heart and &#39;finding what feels good&#39; throughout the practice.",Ankit Gupta,2020-05-19T02:25:12Z,11

"Dear Adriene, <br />Thank you for creating such wonderful yoga sessions! I&#39;ve been practicing for several years and have not made so much progress in such a relatively short amount of time from the guidance of your videos. I initially was attending in class yoga sessions but due to the coronavirus outbreak I turned to online sessions. I&#39;m grateful I came across your page. After the first session I was hooked! As an intermediate yogi, I enjoyed the pace of the videos, the various modifications offered to intensify or ease the postures, and the manageable sessions for creating a daily practice. I appreciate you for emphasizing the importance of bringing the breath into the practice. I was able to go deeper in my postures which ultimately increased my endurance, strength and flexibility. What I&#39;m most grateful for is the sense of calm I felt as soon as I pushed play and watched your videos. Thank you for sharing your cute puppy Benji in all your videos. He adds the perfect touch, is therapeutic, and promotes connection. From the bottom of my heart thank you for your dedication, efforts and sharing your gift with me and the world. With love, <br />Dorothy",Dorothy Raczkowski,2020-05-19T01:28:31Z,0

"Was excited to start day 30. I couldn&#39;t help but smile at the thought of the 30th day. When i heard you say mic will be off, i was thrown off and panicked for a bit. But your gentle reminder to trust that I had the tools to guide me in the practice helped me to rally on. <br /><br />At some point, though, I think I stopped looking at the screen and just flowed to the way it felt right. And before i knew it, you were done, the music went silent, and i was just about to lie down. 😅 dunno if that was supposed to happen, but i kept going anyway, giggling all the way to the end.<br /><br />By the time i finished my flow, i sat up to a seat, and lo and behold, my tears decided to chime in and started to flow on its own too. 😅<br /><br />No words can ever express how much i appreciate your gentleness, and patience all through out. I deeply thank you for allowing me to journey back home and trust myself (unconsciously). <br /><br />You are a wonderful creature and your existence and presence in this world is more than appreciated.

"I think I understand the idea but I was totally unprepared for this... When I saw the last session would be 40 minutes long I was so happy, 40 minutes with Adriene! Instead I was constantly checking the screen, forgetting to breathe, closer to the end I even paused the video to see if it would end soon, which has never happened to me before with yoga with Adriene... I’m a little sad, I think I expected something... different.

"I hope this finds you Adriene, anyways this is my first 30 day journey, I did a triangle and almost cried. Funny feeling when going back into yourself, it’s such a wonderful feeling. I’m grateful for my mind and body for the journey thus far and thankful for you Adriene. Vividly imagining it was like walking in the middle of nowhere, you said “here, let me show you” you held my hand, we walked and talked without words, smiles across our faces. Then at a point in time everything in that vast space starting feeling familiar, a kind embrace that I could only have with myself. This was my world within and seeing my realization, you smiled at me ever so gently, let my hand go, and me, now understanding the comfort in my own setting, smiled back at a distance, then turned around, continuing the path within myself as you waved me goodbye.",Simba Mteirek,2020-05-18T17:03:53Z,0
Adriene stepped foot on the mat and I started crying. I cried through the whole practice as I &quot;watched&quot; myself come home to my body.

"THANK YOU! This is the first 30 days of yoga I have done and quite possibly the first bit of exercise I have stuck with for 30 days. We always say life is to busy but now in the UK we have been in lockdown for far longer than I can remember  (more than 30 days for sure) and its hard to know how to fill the days! But when I do my yoga as I have for 30+ days I feel as though I have achieved something with my day even on and especially on days when I haven&#39;t wanted to get out of bed. Living alone and going through a break up while living in lockdown has had its ups and downs. But knowing I have this time &#39;on the mat&#39; with a friendly, familiar face and Benji has really got my through. There&#39;s days where I have a cry on the mat but I always come away smiling, more centred and better able to get on with my day. <br />You really are giving the world a gift with your talents. Thank you for taking the time to make this series and the many other videos I have watched over the years. Stay well and safe x",amy johnson,2020-05-18T07:59:21Z,0

And as for Benji, well what a sweetie and reminder of the calming presence dogs bring to everything. Now trying out some of your other videos.

As others have commented,  it made me feel open and emotional. What a perfect way to start the weekend...and the next journey home. Thank you!",Debbie M,2020-05-16T17:41:09Z,0
I started this yoga journey more than 30 days ago but I made it! So much gratitude to you Adriene. I feel so connected to my body. I have not felt this comfortable in AGES since I gained weight a few years ago. Also was not expecting to move through day 30 almost &quot;solo&quot; lol thanks for believing in us! &lt;3,Darcelle Lewis,2020-05-16T16:55:13Z,0

"Well I just cried.  That was really a powerful journey and I can&#39;t imagine not starting my day with yoga practice now.  Thank you for being such an amazing teacher ... kind, funny, quirky, and, most of all, accepting.  I may not have the grace and the ability to do everything &quot;proper&quot; (you kill me with the boats) but I make it work for me and you allow for that ... accept that ... honor that.  So, I just wanted you to know how much this has meant to me.  I feel stronger, I sit and walk taller and my dogs love when I do lion&#39;s breath - they get all crazy!  Be well in these crazy times and thank you so much for the tears of gratitude I&#39;m still having (for reals).",amy bahruth,2020-05-16T13:04:01Z,0
"Well, this weightlifting adrenalin junkie is converted to a Yogini. Quarantine brought me to my knees emotionally and physically, and this journey HOME has been my primary source for healing and accepting. <br />Adriene, thank you! I can&#39;t even describe how lifechanging this experience has been!",Tonje Cecilie Stordalen-Søndenå,2020-05-16T12:20:57Z,2

Oh my god I can&#39;t believe I made a yoga practice of my own🤗😳💖 I wanna cry happy tears 😂😢<br />That moment when we were both doing boat pose I was surprised😅💪,E에리카,2020-05-16T07:55:11Z,0
I can&#39;t believe I did it. The moment you said microphone will be off... I thought to myself I can do only Shavaasana in that case... Haha... But I am so glad I was able to do it on my own. I am also very emotional that the course is over. So what do I next? Do I continue with this practice or should I hope on to some other practice? I still can&#39;t do all aasanas perfectly &amp; I start losing my balance in few.... But a great improvement from where I was. Thank you so much! Lots of love :),Ghaas Foos,2020-05-16T07:09:57Z,0
"This was beautiful. Thank you  for this opportunity Adriene! I must admit, when you first said that we were doing our own thing today I was a little skeptical. I nervously giggled for the first three minutes (whilst acknowledging the silliness of that response). I started off with the breathing from the beginning of the Synchronize class, and then fell into the groove and just listened to my body and gave it what it needed today. It became a hip-opening restorative class as I did a 1h15m intermediate vinyasa class yesterday in addition to Day 29 andi was a hurting unit today). I never before would have allowed myself to do a practice on my own, but your gentle push into it helped me to trust myself enough to try it.<br /><br />I feel like I grew in my yoga journey today. Thank you. ❤",Amy Derksen,2020-05-16T06:46:49Z,0

"Whoa. I started this journey really hoping but not really believing that I could do it. I was never good at regular exercises. But this became so much more than &quot;exercising&quot;. I really tried to get into this headspace, that it&#39;s more than poses and how accurately I can do them. Adriene&#39;s patient and calm instructions made it all possible even though I&#39;m quite overweight. I learned that my body IS my home. I learned how much I&#39;m really capable of, some of these poses never seemed possible. I came with the single intention: show yourself that you can do this, that you are persistent, reliable. And I am. If I can do this, what else can I do?<br />Of course it woulnd&#39;t be possible without Adriene, to whom I send my most sincere and heartfelt thanks. Your gentle instructions, unwavering faith, your soothing voice coaxing me to just TRY, your belief in me, your thanks at the end of each video - it made me a better person. And I am very grateful for that. Great, now I&#39;m crying :)<br />I love you 💛",Monocerosik,2020-05-15T23:29:55Z,0

"I&#39;m in lockdown alone in London and just finished day 30. Thank you so much Adriene, you and Benji got me through this sane! It has been like spending time with friends &lt;3",annettiku,2020-05-15T18:34:10Z,0
"I started doing random morning yoga with Adriene videos the day before we got the news that schools would be closing here in NYC due to Covid. After about 20 days of various videos that got me going and feeling good, I chose this 30 dayHome journey to keep me motivated and connected to yoga. I truly believe that yoga with Adriene has kept me centered and balanced and breathing in a way that I would not be without it during this time. I am a single mom of three young kids- 6 and almost 3 year year old twins. Their other mom is an essential worker so they don&#39;t see her as much as they used to and I don&#39;t get much of a break from being the sole caregiver, teacher, cook, housekeeper, etc. It&#39;s a lot. But I have kept yoga as a daily constant even if it meant in the beginning having crying two year olds hanging off of me because they&#39;re not used to not having my full attention. Now they sometimes join me for some parts of the practice, and my 6 yr old will randomly come to me and say, &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Adriene.&quot; :-) This has been a wonderful, sometimes emotional, journey. I&#39;m looking forward to choosing my next 30 day journey here. Thank you for you, Adriene. You are a gem. You have become part of my household, and part of what is keeping me sane during this pandemic.",Tynisha Wynder,2020-05-15T18:31:01Z,0
"I was so nervous to do this, mostly because I&#39;ve never been particularly self driven in any kind of physical activity. Even though you kept saying &quot;you&#39;ve got the tools&quot; I just understood that as &quot;yeah, i understand what she means when she tells me what to do, I don&#39;t have to look at the screen.&quot; BUT as soon as we started I almost started crying- I was doing it by myself and without really thinking too much about it! I knew when to breath in and out, I knew where to take time to sit in a shape for a while, I knew the pacing I could handle. Thank you so much Adriene &lt;3 I&#39;ve never felt this sure of my body in my life.",Haley McCay Designs,2020-05-15T18:09:46Z,1

I was a bit nervous about no mic but once i just jumped in feet first it as fantastic. I totally found my flow and even ended up incorporating poses never touched in this 30 days. The only times i found myself looking at the screen was not to try and change my pose to match yours but just out of curiosity to see where your flow had led you. Thanks for a great 30 days during COVID. :),Tommy Jacobs,2020-05-15T16:30:30Z,0
"I’ve never done yoga before stumbling upon yoga w adriene and randomly deciding to do a video and let me just say, I’ve never felt more at peace with myself esp starting my day with yoga. I Just finished my 30 day @ home journey and I feel a sense of accomplishment. At the end I recognized that I am much stronger, flexible and grounded. I suffer from anxiety and this has helped me through it. Thank you adriene, I am truly looking forward to my yoga journey",Christie Padilla,2020-05-15T16:04:24Z,0

"Made it to day 30 and I am so happy I did. It was one of the best yoga session I have experienced and it was all because of how you guided us “Home”. I started the morning off not motivated and I quickly realized how much I need this. I am pretty sure I had tears in my eyes most of the time, guess I needed a release. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful practice and guidance with us. If I could I would take a (live) class from you every day, so I guess I will just have to start on your other videos 😊. Thank you for sharing the journey and of course Benji! (Seriously, he’s an awesome dog!)",Mr AtoZ,2020-05-15T13:58:09Z,1

When you said your microphone will be off, I was kind of anxious at first, but once I started grounding through my breath, it all just came along, I barely needed to follow your flow perfectly because I knew somehow where you were heading, but most importantly, I knew where I was heading for the very first time.<br />Thank you so much for everything, and thank you for being such an incredible teacher and human being ♥️<br />Wrapping you in love and warmth.",Camélia,2020-05-14T15:02:32Z,0

"This was quite an emotional ride for me. I really didn&#39;t expect this class to be without your vocal guidance, so I definitely panicked at the beginning. I saw the 41 minute length and felt overcome with anxiety and thought maybe I shouldn&#39;t do this one. And I found myself looking up to the screen many times just to see where you were... Anyway, about 20 minutes in, I started relaxing. I was still having to glance at the screen which wasn&#39;t ideal, but I was more calm about it, and I came into the flow :) When the theme played entirely for the first time during the plank swings we were doing, I cried! I was struggling a bit but I kept going. And when it was finished and I realized you weren&#39;t going to talk at the end, and your kind comforting smile appeared, I cried again. So many emotions. Thank you Adriene for this incredibly journey! I want to continue this yoga journey with you! So much love xoxox",holisticmaya,2020-05-14T14:35:18Z,219
"I cried at all the same moments you did! The beginning when I found out we wouldn&#39;t have Adriene&#39;s guidance, again when the HOME theme song came on, and again when Adriene didn&#39;t address us at the very end. What an emotional practice. More than anything, I am grateful that Adriene taught us so well, and helped me believe that I really can do this on my own. I just didn&#39;t know it yet...

"I&#39;m absolutely gutted to say this, but I hated this last day ; as a beginner to yoga I enjoyed this whole journey, and felt like it was doing me so much good during those 29 days, but having no guidance for this one made me feel so inadequate and frustrated with myself that I almost cried, I felt like I messed it all up and couldn&#39;t keep up, or make sure to breathe deeply while staying synchronized to the movements, and took zero joy or relaxation in it... I&#39;m really sad that this beautiful journey ends this way, it doesn&#39;t really feel like home getting so disappointed with myself after hyping myself up for days and thinking that I could do it... it must have also been a bad day for me, and I was already emotional without adding this stress ! I&#39;ll keep on practising with you but I guess I&#39;ll always make sure that I&#39;m mentally in a good enough place, and check that it seems doable at my level !

"Thank you Dear Adriene! I did it! This 30 day challenge was motivating to my lagging spirits especially during the lockdown in 🇮🇳. I’ve been into yoga the last 20 years, love its calming effect🧘‍♀️💕, but one loses rhythm when you have a lapse. Always done Iyengar in 🇮🇳, then some Ashtanga, Hatha and a fusion in Japan(my hometown). Then, my own self style  when going to the studio became difficult. But my son encouraged me to go onto YouTube and do ‘Yoga with Adriene’. It kept me from slipping...You are an amazing teacher, I admire your flow and soothing messages of loving yourself, and I aim to continue. I seem to get aches here and there (mid 50’s 🤫) and just two days ago, when I raised my legs against the wall to ease my lower back pain and irritating edema that flares up now and then , wow, the results were so good that I look forward to doing this every evening. BTW,  I happen to be drinking a similar yogi tea concoction every evening, and it just affirmed my heart that I was on the right path😊 It has to be Chai every morning and I love to put turmeric and ginger in almost everything! Keep going Adriene, lots of love and stay well🌹",Mona Shamdasani,2020-05-14T09:18:03Z,0

"Thank you very much for this journey! This time in quarantine has been stressful and taxing on my mind and body and having your practice to turn to each day throughout has been very therapeutic and calming. I had never really practiced yoga before this but I now will incorporate it into my workout routines. While I may not be the most flexible or stable nor able to do all of the motions, your instruction has allowed me to feel good no matter what stage I am at.

"Got started a bit late but just finished the 30 Day Journey, WOOT!  Loved it!  Been following for a couple of years now and this is the first 30 Day Journey I&#39;ve done.  So perfect.  On day 15 I injured my lower back at work and was still able to do the whole journey, even though I had to go a bit slower for a couple of days.  In fact, my back is much better as a result, so thanks!  My reward for sticking with it and completing it is a t-shirt!  My only regret is that I can&#39;t get the Home specific t-shirt anymore.  Oh well, have another one picked out.  I have said this before but it&#39;s worth repeating, no matter where I am and what I&#39;m experiencing your weekly messages and videos always seem to hit me at the right moment in time when I need them the most.

"Adriene, I have been homeless for two years. One could say I&#39;d been homeless for much longer on some level but two years ago, I made a conscious decision to forego maintaining a physical &quot;home&quot; to move into a sense of home that did not depend on external conditions. With just a backpack of supplies, I thust myself into a vulnerability that challenged me, moment-by-moment to show up honestly — speaking honestly, listening honestly and living honestly, authentically embodying my core values, principles and wisdom. I leaned into the uncertainty present in every momentary set of circumstances to fully dedicate myself to unearthing the Truth in the heart&#39;s center while hitchhiking up and down the West Coast, taking only temporary housing offers and volunteering.<br /><br />I started Home late, in April, after a short-term housing arrangement turned indetermimable with the pandemic locking down the state. It seemed that I might stay put for a while despite how my heart felt, well, compromised and unheard.<br /><br />Eventually, I did manage to leave despite the climate and stepped out into an unfamiliar uncertainty. <br /><br />Just like everyone else, I feel much more vulnerable in the pandemic climate. Moving about has been central to my life as a homeless person for the last 2 years. Unlike most, I don&#39;t have a base in which to take shelter for an indeterminate length of time.<br /><br />And this has been true for these last couple years but now I can&#39;t rely on the support of open doors when I have to move on for whatever reason. I feel vulnerable to making unfortunate and possibly unhealthy compromises to remain sheltered - a condition we know is ultimately unstable anyhow.<br /><br />So my experience and appreciation of instability is deepening. Surely, none of this will last but neither is relief guaranteed. Life may very well continue to present conditions wherein its inherent instability must be faced on increasingly deeper levels, no choice and no escape. That&#39;s a frightening prospect but, of course, that way lies surrender and liberation.<br /><br />I wept throughout this day&#39;s practice. It&#39;s humbling to see how much work I still have to do to land &quot;home&quot;, how my practice has led me here and still I feel frightened, vulnerable and uncertain.<br /><br />But I know that I see you and I see what you offer; it&#39;s not just a way to move that builds physical strength, agility and flexibility — these are just by-products — but rather a way of seeing and allowing ourselves to be seen, by ourselves and each other.<br /><br />Adriene, I see you and I know you see me. Because it is not my heart and your heart but THE heart which sees vulnerability with tenderness, compassion and unconditional love. This is always a precious, precious blessing; thank you.<br /><br />I can&#39;t know where this next step will land but I remain open and inviting the path to rise up to meet the four corners of this foot. And wherever I have the chance to lie back and sink into the earth, she&#39;ll be there to hold me, she&#39;ll have my back and together we&#39;ll carry me Home.<br /><br />Blessings, Adriene. May you always have support for your journey Home. May you always return to your heart in gentleness, beathing deep into love. Thank you.<br /><br />In kindness and care,<br />Natasha",Natasha Cabrera,2020-05-11T15:57:00Z,0
"I almost feel like I graduated or something, it felt so good to just show up every day. And I can&#39;t believe how much easier I move around now than 30 days ago.

"Wow. Just wow. I was totally not expecting this, but I just got started. I did my own flow, added some, left some out, hardly glanced at the video at all. And absolutely loved it. I felt like you gave me lots of vocabulary to form my own sentences and for the first time I &quot;wrote&quot; something that was completely me.<br />First I felt that the time flows by so much faster when you instruct - until I realized the length of the whole practice afterwards only. <br />Thank you so much Adriene for making daily yoga part of my daily routine for the past 30 days, I&#39;m on to one of your other programs :)",Nadin S.,2020-05-11T14:01:13Z,0

At first, I missed a lot of days, but by day 15, I wanted to do it everyday and I only missed one day after that. <br />I am genuinely and sincerely grateful for this opportunity and thank you, Adriene, for being being so gentle and loving, and for allowing us to just be wherever we are and feel whatever we feel. This was beautiful ❤️<br />Hopefully, by next January, I will be ready to do a 30-day journey. Meanwhile, I&#39;ll go and join the other calendars 😊😊<br />Thank you ❤️❤️",Talin Saghdasaryan,2020-05-11T12:30:36Z,0
"Thank you, first of all, my mom and I did this challenge during quarantine and in march (it started sooner in Austria) we said we would try to do yoga every day but I didn&#39;t really think we could do it, but from the day we started the 30 days series we really did it. It gave us structure and a fixture in the day we could look forward to, we also really bonded doing it together. I was doing yoga before but not like this it was without mindfulness and for the result, not the journey now I know there&#39;s more to it than that. Today I noticed that unlike a month ago I learned how to incorporate the breath and it makes such a difference. In the beginning, I was hesitant to give in to the spiritual side of yoga but now I like it even though I&#39;m not a spiritual person.  I will keep doing yoga every or almost every day and I think this has changed my life for the better.  thank you Adriene (and all of the people that comment i like reading the little stories under every video)",Niki,2020-05-11T11:34:13Z,0

"Just finished this today and I wanted to say thank you thank you. I started in January with my baby daughter while on mat leave. She started to do a beautiful downward dog. When she turned 9 months two years ago, she was sent to the hospital to have a brain tumour removed. My husband and I were away from our homes and close to the hospital. With this pandemic going on , I would continue my journey with each video so on my days away from the hospital. While I felt like I was foresaking my little yoga buddy, I gained hope that we would be home again.

"First off, I&#39;m Mary, not Gary.  Anyway I have really enjoyed the 30 day program but was really disappointed with lesson 30.  I&#39;ve been doing my yoga in our office and watching on our computer screen so when Adriene decided to go off microphone, I was thoroughly handicapped.  I could either watch the monitor to see what she was doing on just do whatever I felt like doing.  I had been doing that before finding her sessions so was disappointed that the last session was such an unexpected failure that I gave up half way through.  If I was doing this in front of a big screen TV, it might have been different but it was a real downer for me with only my computer screen.",Gary Dewey,2020-05-10T18:18:12Z,0
"Done! And it was so satisfying to move through all the positions we have been learning this past month, and with a few of my own lol. I had to take a break in the beginning when Benji came to you. I was a wash of memories and emotions of my good girl Noodles. Had to stop and feel. After that the flow came easier.<br /><br />Kudos to the composer of the music. <br /><br />Thank you<br />Cheers",peter koufoudakis,2020-05-10T17:50:08Z,0

"I just finished the 30-days journey in 30 days in a row, as a way to make the lockdown less painful. One month passed and barely noticed it thanks to this initiative!<br />It has served a lot to me to discover the benefits of yoga, and as a relief-valve for the everyday routine.<br />Thanks a lot for all this, and congratulations to your hard work!<br />Warm regards from Toledo (Spain) xx",Carlos G M,2020-05-10T11:14:48Z,0
I’ve done this journey for 30 days and loved it. But 7 mins into this last day and I want to cry. I can’t follow without the verbal queues and feel like such a failure. I appreciate Adrienne and the practice but I’ve lost all the excitement and joy that I came to the mat with this morning. Feeling heartbroken. I never really comment on YouTube videos and this isn’t a negative on Adrienne as a teacher as she is fab. But I feel like a failure that I can’t go through the flow without looking. I can’t be the only one. X,Harriet Small,2020-05-10T11:05:13Z,0
"I think the point of today&#39;s practice was to try and improvise a routine of your own. Start with some basic poses sitting down, maybe some standing poses like the lunges and downward dog we did almost every practice, and finish off with your favorite poses to settle down and stretch your back! I think Adriene wasn&#39;t meant to be followed all the way through, just served as an inspiration guide where you could look up and work your way to a pose you forgot! I think you should try again with your eyes closed perhaps, and try to do a 10 min yoga of your own! I&#39;m sure you can do that and you shouldn&#39;t feel like a failure if you can&#39;t do a full 40 min yoga routine! I did 30 mins on my own with just poses I remembered and held some of them for a long time cause it felt right!! Good luck Harriet, I believe in you :)",Daria,2020-05-10T16:50:46Z,2
"When during this video I looked up at you as I wiggled my fingertips and saw you were too, when I uttered the words &#39;take up space&#39; to myself in star pose, I realised how grateful I am for this journey and the vocabulary you&#39;ve given me. Thank-you Adriene, thank-you. ❤️",Melissa Wilson,2020-05-10T09:00:50Z,0

"This is the most difficult one - as a beginner, the lack of verbal guidance makes it more difficult, but I managed. I tried doing my own flow, although some parts of it don&#39;t flow too nicely. I did my favorite pigeon pose and frog pose, and tried the crow pose again, this time feeling slightly stronger than I was before. There were moments where I didn&#39;t know what to do next so I just followed Adriene.",Trisha Prajnawirani,2020-05-10T07:11:16Z,10
"The last day of this challenge. It took me 38 days, but it&#39;s completed. I feel better, I&#39;m moving better, and I am in a better mindset. I didn&#39;t feel the need to do Crow Pose once during this session. LOL. Thank you again, Adriene for putting these out there. The world needs more positivity and love. Now onto the next 30-day challenge.",alohababe14,2020-05-10T07:04:52Z,0
Finished day 30 today. I was emotional. My 30 days reflecting a beautiful journey spent with two girlfriends in lockdown. My mind wandered over those days with amazing memories of coming together each day and connecting as friends or separately on an internal journey. Thanks Adriene I enjoyed everything everyday. The one comment I’d make is to have had instruction voice no chatter just simple instructions on day 30 as had to keep looking up from breathing and going within. It was nearly perfect but voice over would hv made it. Music was amazing too. 🙏🧘🏼✔️,Sandra Chatfield,2020-05-10T05:42:16Z,0

I did not have much faith when I started the challenge, but then I realized that, it was the best decision I made, you helped me a lot with my mental health in quarantine, I improved my flexibility and above all I learned to listen to myself",Regina Dascón,2020-05-10T02:06:28Z,0

I started  this series as a challange to myself during these lockdown days and here we are in the final day. Wow that was something. I was critical at first about how i could finish this without ever trying Yoga before but with your walkthrough I managed to finish it.  Thank you Adriene. Lots of love.

"If I wanted a freestyle session, I wouldn’t have turned the video on. In order to follow along I needed to constantly stop and strain my neck to watch. Really really bummed after such an awesome series up until this point. What a disappointing flop at the end. I’ll do more, but if this is a day 30 tradition, mine will be starting another video. A voiced-over option with short verbal cues would solve the issue.",Marty Smith,2020-05-09T18:16:49Z,0
"I&#39;ve been doing yoga every day since lockdown began but for the first month, I didn&#39;t have a direction or intention for my practice. I just picked videos based on length and ability level. The 30 Day home series gave me a goal to work toward and help me maintain healthy movement while in quarantine (I&#39;m an at-risk group so I can&#39;t leave my flat at all). Thank you, Adriene, I look forward to many more practices with you.",Joan Catherine Meyer,2020-05-09T17:31:33Z,0
Thank you Adriene. So there was a moment where I could not watch you without being in an awkward position that was the time to let go and trust that I could flow. There was a moment of doubt like what the f am I supposed to do which led to feeling deflated then it was like I got this and I started to move through my sequence in my own way. Of course I glanced a peek at you every so often and the funny thing was that sometimes were were doing similar things at the same time and sometimes not and that was OK.,Karen Brown,2020-05-09T17:06:59Z,0
"Never in my life I did workout every single day, 30 days in a row. Well, now I did, so proud, so happy, can&#39;t imagine going back old ways. I&#39;m feeling like a brand new human being. Also did a little bit of crying at the end of a video. Thank you &lt;3",Ivana Zidar,2020-05-09T16:18:56Z,0
"I just finished Home today!!! Ahhh I&#39;m so relieved and don&#39;t tell anyone, but I cried a little bit..not because I was sad, but because I finally finished a 30 day yoga challenge!! I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s quarantine or the fact that I have an actual yoga mat instead of a blanket or a sheet this time around, but I did it! I have tried Adriene&#39;s other 30 day yoga challenge two other times and only ever got to day 14 or less. Why did I stop?!?!? Can&#39;t wait to continue my yoga journey!!!!",Sydney Fillinger,2020-05-09T15:46:22Z,0
I can’t help but cry at the end of Day 30 on all the 30-day yoga journeys. Practicing beside everyone but creating my own flow is so empowering and beautiful. I loved the quote at the end.

"Day 30: Done!!!<br />When I started this yoga series, I didn&#39;t expect too much. I wasn&#39;t good at making goals or doing something continuously, let alone for 30 days.  On Day 1, I thought maybe, I would become more motivated if I comment each day after finished the exercise. I always looking forward to writing &quot;Day 30: Done&quot;. Today, I did it! When the Home music-themed playing at the end of the video, I started feeling emotional.  Sad, proud, happy. It&#39;s like I&#39;m parting from you and Benji, but it&#39;s for good reason.  To start another challenge.  For me, this series isn&#39;t about yoga only.<br />Thank you VERY MUCH, Adriene, Benji, and the team to create this series.",amelia aman,2020-05-09T09:37:47Z,1
This was possibly my best yoga class ever. I did this 30 day home challenge during lockdown. It actually worked out like a good theme for me and I finished the challenge. I never do! I do yoga on and off I love it but I don’t do it .i actually found myself in tune with Adriene and did almost and identical routine. I am very thankful. I am wanting to take this home and continue with a short daily practise. Thank you Adriene for sharing your yoga 🙏,Ester Piras,2020-05-09T08:28:15Z,0
I&#39;ve been trying for a few years to actually finish one of your 30 days journeys and I have finally done it. It wasn&#39;t all in a row but I managed to make it all the way through!

I always thought that I wasn&#39;t flexible enough for yoga, but this program taught me &quot;find what feels good&quot; and bring whatever you can to the mat. Thank you for making me fall in love with this wonderful practice. It has been so beneficial both on and off the mat.

I couldn&#39;t do it all in 30 days(something flared in my body after day 4,so I had to do it every other day until it healed),but I finished strong (consecutively) on this past week!I remembered your words on making it ours and respecting our body limits,so I wasn&#39;t so hard on myself !Here is Day 30,I was anticipating and dreading it at the same time...You opened the video,talking so gently and I started crying! Really?! Lol...You are at fault for being so incredibly down to earth and make us feel like we are bffs,when in reality we have never met.I am calmer,less reactive,breathing better and more <a href=""http://centered.now/"">centered.Now</a> I want more!Where do I go from here?I do not want to stop!

I was new to yoga so I took things slowly, and I am really amazed at how these 30 sessions have changed me, both physically and psychologically. More than two months later I&#39;ve finished it, and this same week, according to the last government regulations, I am finally allowed to get a train to get back to my home safely.

"I was intimidated by today’s practice, but you taught me to trust myself, to listen to my body and find what feels good. I felt so empowered going through it, sometimes meeting you with some poses, but doing my own version. It was truly amazing. The practice has been a bright spot in these dark days of isolation. Thank you so much Adriene. Namaste.",Adel Rodríguez,2020-05-07T16:14:07Z,0

"Thank you Adriene for curating this for everyone. It took me about 2months and it has been amazing. Days where I came every evening I could find my body being stronger. Days where I got too busy, I felt the difference and finally when I came to do Day 30, I was really touched by this programme. Thank you Adriene for your heart - for people. Praying the best for everyone on this platform. Love.",Weig Ong,2020-05-07T14:45:07Z,0

Thank you for a beautiful journey home—I was initially upset about you not leading me through on this last day—but then i found my own rhythm with my own yoga practice listening to my own body and moving as i needed—what a powerful message to myself.  I also cried at the end recognizing the feeling of home in my own body.  “We are all just walking each other home”. —Ram Dass,Nori-Lynn T,2020-05-07T12:40:54Z,0

Between these last 30 days and the &quot;self love&quot; meditation, I feel so much more energized. Thank you, Adriene for not only helping me but all these amazing people around the world.

Still, every day we felt better after and had a better day because of doing yoga! My flexibility and strength has definitely improved, as has my mental health! Thank you so much!",vindelanda,2020-05-07T00:08:22Z,6
Adriene Thank you very much for sharing this journey with myself and my friend Martina. We were getting into our yoga before this lockdown and we did it after every 13 hour shift whether a long day or Night shift. It&#39;s been wonderful thank you. Missed your quirky comments during this one but totally loved the fact we understood the vocabulary and knee what was next. We will be doing the next one Dedicate. 😁  Loved the little write up about you in the paper saying how this has been a bit hit during Quarantine.  Namaste from Belfast,Zara,2020-05-06T23:34:13Z,0
"I had to stop the video halfway, as I didn&#39;t want it to end...! Emotional day indeed. As I am recovering from injuries (both physical and mental), this journey took me more like 65 days, pre-pandemic and during isolation. Thanks to you and that darling pup for sometimes being the only people I talked to while working from home. &quot;Oh Adriene!&quot; and &quot;Awe, Benji!&quot; were frequently the first words out of my mouth on any given weekday.

"i found myself crying at the 24 minute mark. out of gratitude, out of bliss, out of pure connection with my own mind, body, and breath. when i started this journey, i knew little to nothing about the yoga practice, but day by day, i found myself listening to my body, i found myself putting my breath first, i found myself putting intention behind my movements. seriously, these past 30 days have been one of the best things i&#39;ve ever done for myself, and it culminated perfectly today with this practice.<br /> throughout the video, i could hear many of the teachings from the previous days cycling through my head, whether it was &quot;observe&quot;, &quot;spread your hand across your ribcage as if it were dipped in honey&quot;, &quot;halfway lift, your version&quot; or my favorite &quot;belly to cobra or chaturanga to upward facing dog&quot;, hahahah. i even said &quot;i am strong&quot; aloud. this was such a beneficial journey for me, and i can see myself coming back to this video in particular and creating my own flow mixed with notes of what is going on on screen to further enrich the practice. i am so so grateful for this, and i found your channel at the perfect time for me. thank you so much, adriene (and benji!!!) &lt;3333",Cari Whyte,2020-05-06T19:11:09Z,2
"I am 28 years old and was living abroad for the last three years volunteering in the Peace Corps when, seven weeks ago, we got the news that we were all being evacuated to our home residences due to COVID-19. I was distraught mostly because I knew I would be going to my childhood home, not to mention, with no prospects for the future for the first time in my life! A couple weeks after my return to South Carolina a friend sent me &quot;Home&quot; sensing I could use the pick me up. I had never done yoga but I literally had nothing else to do. Here I am 30 days later in the middle of Journey when it hits me that I started and completed &quot;Home&quot; in my childhood bedroom. I&#39;m feeling much better than I was seven weeks ago!

This the first time I stuck to an exercise routine faithfully without dropping it after 2 or 3 days. At first it was hard but as I continued it became bearable and I&#39;m very proud to say I didn&#39;t give up! This is my favorite day because I get to do whatever the heck I want! Thought I still followed your actions at most parts. 😁 I even did fashion boat pose &#39;cause why not! This has been a very wonderful and enjoyable journey home!

I can’t believe I made it this far. But no talking at all on the last one.. it wasted my time. I wouldn’t mind some talking.. instead of looking at the screen always. I will go watch a different day to get my days activity in. Some could just mute the sound or turned down the volume than to just not talk. Your voice is soothing so you should of said somethings. Think of that next time.,Tonya Hardin,2020-05-06T13:17:22Z,0

My intention was to get more friendly with my body, and we’re getting there 😁<br /><br />I also struggled with the no audio in this one, and realized I have often been using the vocal guide more than watching the screen (plus I was sweating all over my glasses). This is probably a tough one for folks like me who are caught up in doing it “right.” I know that’s part of the point though 🙂 - maybe I’ll watch a bit more then try again.",Greg Murphy,2020-05-06T12:41:26Z,0

"There are no words to express how happy I am that mid January 2020 I started Day 1 of the Home journey. I really committed. Never missed a day. It has been months now and it&#39;s still very rare that I miss a day of a YWA video. Before HOME I had only done a tiny bit of yoga and it was with P90x and scary and intense. But this was a perfect welcome to a beginner like me, who was interested but intimidated. I&#39;ve recommended it to many and will continue to do so. I appreciate this YWA Channel SO MUCH! I am especially thankful that I was already accustomed to daily practice prior to quarantine. Now it&#39;s even more important to get the time in.

"I loved the Home series and was really looking forward to finishing day 30 and it being a special practice.  But having to look up from down dog or forward fold to see what was next was frustrating and I ended up turning it off halfway thru.

Feel bad - I could not complete this. Due to certain injuries I cannot hyper-extend my neck. Which is what I need to do in certain poses in order to watch without instructions. One of the reasons I love hot yoga so much (and I miss it dearly right now) is that it is the same all the time. Mindful and mindless - can concentrate on my practice. Without watching this video several times before doing it - won&#39;t be able to complete it. Kudos to everyone who can.,Jo Ann Kirby,2020-05-05T15:54:55Z,0
"Wow Adriene. I was emotional from the very beginning but when I heard the Yoga Revolution music, I lost it! Many emotions came up: courage and excitement but also uncertainty and doubt. I tried to notice them all and keep breathing through. I have found Day 30 much more difficult in the past, so I can already see how much I&#39;ve grown over the past few years.

"The music was so powerful to me in this flow (I actually used to find the intro a bit too cheesy but how it has changed!) - triggering the daily notion of clicking on YWA, all the different feelings that I&#39;ve had at the start of a practice - the ups and the downs. But each day being greeted with the intro music and again at the end of my practice, feeling restored, healed and ready for the day.  It served as a reminder of the journey we have all been on together. This at home practice, on my matt with Adrienne. Like the millions of others united in their destination but with different paths or meanings.  I started practising YWA in 2016. I wasn&#39;t sure this feeling could come from a virtual class, but I carry your voice in your head throughout my day beyond my practice; &quot;Set your intention&quot;, &quot;Let go of what&#39;s not serving you&quot;, &quot;where the mind goes, energy flows&quot;, &quot;we call this the Texas T&quot;  <br />Thank you Adrienne for bringing in the light.

"I&#39;m speechless about this 30-day challenge. I&#39;ve done your videos here &amp; there for the last 8-9 years, but I never did a 30-day challenge. Doing yoga would make all this anger come up for me, as I wasn&#39;t able to be still and present with myself. I would hate doing yoga. A year ago I realized that perhaps yoga could be a way for me to cleanse all this anger out, but I wasn&#39;t ready yet. I just finished this 30 day challenge and I&#39;ve never felt so peaceful. It has moved me, challenged me, and cleansed me. Thank you, Adriene. You are such an incredible guide for so many of us. I&#39;m not stopping after 30 days -- bring on 60 days of yoga every day!

I loved it, it was the first time I have had a daily yoga practise, (admittedly it took me about 35 days), you made it accessible, relaxed, easy and I feel you gave us a perfect grounding and starting place  for continuing yoga. Thankyou for your generosity;, some of us do not have the means to pay for regular classes, esp at this time of lockdown and no paid work. I feel the benefits in my body, in the way I move and in the way I feel connected to my body after just this 30 day course, which is very motivating.

"Having done &#39;Revolution&#39; and &#39;True&#39;, I knew Day 30 was going to be a freestyle practice and I wasn&#39;t looking forward to it. Not one bit. But this time was different. I decided to keep my eyes closed and to just go with the flow. And it worked ! I peaked at my screen a few times and was amazed to find myself in (almost) the same posture as Adriene.<br />This practice was wonderful. I was able to fully commit to the journey for the first time, even if it took me 34 days. I will be back to the mat tomorrow with &#39;True&#39; which I didn&#39;t manage to finish the first time around. Maybe I will complete the practice in 30 days this time. Maybe I won&#39;t. And that&#39;s OK because Adriene has taught me to keep an open mind and to &quot;find what feels good&quot; :)<br />Namaste y&#39;all ! Hugs from France 🙏",Wendy Cairoli,2020-05-05T00:00:48Z,0

My heart is full  When I remeber my first day saying  to myself, let s give it a try and thinking at the same time no way I shall do this every day for 30 days. I am so not flexible, I get tired just watching. And I did it each day without skipping.. It increased my strength, my balance,  and most of all my piece of mind. The most important thing is that I learned  how to listen to my body... and  the rest will come. And here I am, staying proud. And you know what, my journey have just started&lt;3 Thank you Adrienne",Andrea,2020-05-04T21:31:18Z,0

I released so many emotions and negativity during this journey, things that were stuck for so long - still work to do but hey, baby step after baby step right? :) Lots of cries on this last session, I hold your hand during these past month practicing with you, really .

You changed my quarantine. at the beginning of this video, I started to cry, cuz I feel like: “omg, I did it”, I could do it and I’m so happy that you got my back and make me believe that I can also got my own back, thank you so much for this, Adriene, you rock! 💞  sending love from São Paulo, Brazil. 💫 obrigada 💋 🐶  (I’ve just downloaded your app, I’m loooking forward to continue this journey)",Andressa Cabral,2020-05-04T13:14:53Z,0

"I just want to say thank you Adrienne, this series came at the most perfect time.<br /><br />30 days ago I was 2 weeks into my recovery from a possible covid-19 case, just getting back to work and revising for University exams. My breathing was horrible, I was anxious and quite frankly scared and feeling horrible overall.<br /><br />30 days later, my breathing has healed up beautifully!! I feel much more calmer and in tune with my body. I have gone from okay let&#39;s make an effort to get to the mat, to counting down the minutes to my lunch break just to have this moment of calmness for myself. <br /><br />And physically, wowza my arms are toned!! I feel like I&#39;ve just walked out of a spa at the end of each session. Honestly thank you, you&#39;ll never know how much you&#39;ve helped me during these crazy times!!",Noor,2020-05-04T11:30:37Z,0

"As possibly many of us, I started my journey home in quarantine. I feel so blessed, grateful and honored to have shared this journey with you, Adriene, and the YWA community - It is truly amazing how much connection I was able to feel during a home alone yoga practice. Adriene, I lack the words to describe how grateful I am to you for sharing your spirit with us. Needless to say, I will continue my journey home with YWA. Thank you so, so much.<br /><br />On another note: My dog, who is living with my Mum, is called Benji, too. I am not able to see them during these difficult times, but seeing you and your lovely Benji was a daily reminder of the two of them. Although the thought of them being so far away stung each and everyday, it also filled me with love. I saw this as an invitation to send my daily love to Mum and Benji... Breathing lots of love in, and then breathing lots of love out. <br /><br />Now, dear Adriene, I take a deep breath, and send my love all the way from Germany to your home! <br />Namaste.",E.

"Adriene, I have been doing your videos on and off for about 3 years and this was my first time completing the 30-day journey. I just wanted to let you know that it felt great and I do feel like I&#39;ve learned a lot and am trying to put some of the elements into practice &quot;off the mat&quot; as you always.  This last video was incredible as well. I could hear your voice in my head giving instructions for every pose that we did dozens of times before and I really enjoyed the music too.

"You told us on day 29 to come with an open mind today and I did, but this sure isn’t what I expected! At first I couldn’t help but laugh nervously and feel a bit lost, but I sat in &quot;a comfortable seat of my choice&quot;, and just breathed for a couple minutes until I was calm and confident enough that I could do this on my own.<br />From then on it went amazingly smooth! I followed my breath, improvised, all the while hearing your voice inside – &quot;lift your left leg up high&quot;, &quot;aaand slowly release to center&quot;, &quot;belly to cobra, your version&quot;, &quot;and straight to downward facing dog&quot;, and so on. I peeked at the screen from time to time, for inspiration, but also just to see how you were doing, and it felt like I was practicing together with a friend.<br /><br /><br />Thanks for this journey, this 30-day program (well, 32, I took a couple days off) was my first time ever doing yoga, but it won’t be the last :)",lyoug,2020-05-04T02:41:22Z,0

I was like &quot; I know what you&#39;re gonna do adrienne&quot; and it was so fun !

I started one month ago thanks to a friend, after a couple of days I felt weird but I decided to go on - in this period I feel lost and I needed a daily commitment. And... after a week this was &quot;my appointment&quot;, it became my thing. I discovered so much about myself, what I am capable of, what I can commit to... this has been really important.

"I don&#39;t even know how to express how precious this &#39;Home&#39; journey was for me - I started 30 days ago, bored with isolation, tired of the lockdown situation, feeling pretty down about sitting home alone for weeks. It took me 2 or 3 days to notice the small changes first, then the bigger ones. After a week I have somehow switched into the &#39;positive mode&#39; and I have stayed there. I&#39;ve noticed big changes in the body and huge changes in the mind. And I&#39;m sure that all the credits for that go to &#39;Home | 30 days of Yoga&#39;. And the end of &#39;Home | 30 days of Yoga&#39; is not an &#39;end&#39; at all - I believe it&#39;s just a beginning. Thank you, Adriene 💗",0lexandra,2020-05-03T18:05:18Z,0
"Thank you so much Adriene! Like many here, I did this during lockdown, and this yoga journey has infused this time with mindfulness, compassion and &#39;yumminess&#39;! Like a delicious cup of herbal tea. The lessons have spread way beyond the mat (which I guess in this analogy is the teabag?!) I seem to be a bit behind most people who&#39;ve done this but if anyone&#39;s finishing home at a later date, hey! Lovely to practice with you (across space <b>and</b> time! Whooooa.)

"Took me a few extra days to finish but I would like to say thank you for teaching me to show up. I now understand what it means. Like many other people, I felt a bit insecure at the end and I thought I needed more coaching but a few minutes in I just did the best I could remember. At some point, I have noticed how some moves are now so much easier to perform, how I can hold a pose longer and how I do not rely only on Adriene&#39;s voice. I also remember to breathe, to relax my shoulders and acknowledging my thoughts and letting them go. To all of you on this journey - congrats, you have done great! To myself: pat pat.

Not loud, not too quiet. Not lame, not too fast. Not a pretentious animal lady, but a woman who I, for my part, find great. A person with whom one can imagine sitting in a café and having fun all day. Thank you for the journey together, which for me has definitely only just begun!

"Can hardly believe our journey has ended (or just begun)! I was feeling deeply critical of myself leading up to today because I didn&#39;t manage to finish the journey without skipping some days, confirming my struggles with following through. I am so glad that I took up your invitation to trust our inner guides today, as I closed my eyes almost the entire time and finally found that my body was learning from our practice all along. Even though I kept tumbling while attempting crow, your voice emerged to say, &quot;I got you&quot;, and I felt safe even though fragile. As I slowly pulled my thumbs up to my third eye with my back turned to the screen, the closing music started getting louder and I realized we were finishing synchronously. I looked back and saw you bowing and started weeping. Thank you Adriene, for helping me be with my body after a lifetime of running away from it, for guiding me to my own inner guide, for trusting that we already have what we need to heal.",Susan Park,2020-05-03T05:11:18Z,0
"Thank you so much Adriene. I just finished your 30 day challenge. The symbolism behind all this, with your words and how it made me feel, I am simply speechless. This last day made me so incredibly emotional! I felt such gratitude, reaching my hands towards the sky, it actually made me cry. Reading all these comments makes me realise I wasn&#39;t the only one. Quarantine ends over the entire world, starting slowly from tomorrow it seems, which made this last practice even more beautiful. A new beginning. Ending with a beautiful quote. This challenge was also my first dip in yoga! And I got so surprised along the way how much I enjoyed it. I have been in bodybuilding for 17 years, I slowly introduced Pilates a few years back, but there is something so absolutely wonderful and intimate about Yoga. Also, these last 30 days made both an old wrist and elbow injury completely dissapear! So again, from the bottom of my heart, thank you so much.",Louise Jensen,2020-05-03T04:31:51Z,0

Every day there was a routine I was looking forward to, after the session I&#39;d take a shower and feel like my day had been worthwhile! The fact that I know yoga terms now is beyond belief to me.

On day 30, I was finally able to find stillness. It has brought so much physical and emotional strength into my life. I never would have thought 30 days of yoga could have done that. Thank you so, so, very much Adriene, Benji &amp; team, for providing this 30 days and also guiding me to find freedom within myself. Also, my Mum and I live almost 8 hours from each other and we have completed this journey home together. It has brought us the feeling of being closer together. Each time I get on the mat, it is like I am receiving a hug from her even though she is not here. It is such a beautiful and comforting feeling.

"Thank you Adriene for such an amazing journey Home. I feel so proud of myself because I successfully committed to practising for 30 days in a row. It may seem such a small achievement but isn&#39;t. I was an absolute beginner, never practised yoga before and I now feel that the practice has to fit into my daily routine because it makes me feel good. I confess I got a bit emotional at start because I was scared I couldn&#39;t do anything without your guiding voice. But then it simply came from within and I follow the guidance of my breath, because it was not a competition, not a race, just return to yourself, to something you are already, regardless of small &quot;mistakes&quot;. and I was even more emotional when I realized that I was able to do 3/4 pushups after the plank position, never happened before.

"Wow! I never thought I&#39;d cry in the may. Seening you with Benji made me cry buckets over my darling Collie Max I lost some years ago. Beautiful dogs are more than a blessing, they are a direct gift from God.  Thank you for this I felt strong and vulnerable and happy and sad but that&#39;s ok.

"I cried 3 times durig this video. <br />I got into college 4 years ago, and was working out twice a day. With all things from college and my personal life, I ended up not doing anything for my body for the last 4 years. I tried going back to the gym several times, home workouts, etc, because I hated my body.<br />Today, completing this practice I cried because I was giving myself so much love, deep inside I was telling myself &quot;You see? You can do whatever you want. You are amazing. &quot;<br />I  guess I finally found the movement that makes sense for my body, something that besides being challenging, I love to do. During yoga I know there is no right and wrong.<br /><br /><br />Thank you so much, Adriene, for showing me the way back home.<br /><br /><br />I will keep up with the next calendars!

"Today is my day 30! I started this and did not miss a day, even though sometimes I did it really late in the evening, I was able to keep this one committment to myself throughout. I have never done any yoga before so I was unsure what to get out of this but I am so thankful for the opportunity to go through this. I was mildly panicking when you said no mic, but I was actually able to follow along and I do feel stronger at a lot of the poses than when I started.

There were days when I felt like I didn&#39;t want to do it or I couldn&#39;t do it but I managed to click on the videos and just do it and I&#39;m so happy I carried on through cause I feel great for it.

As a young adult trying to figure out my life during these tough times, I am beyond grateful to have this escape. I&#39;m still learning to give myself permission to let go.

"That was incredible! <br />I&#39;ve never done an unguided practice (without a voice telling me the moves) and the first 10 minutes I was constantly trying to look at my screen to see if I was keeping up with the moves. About 20 minutes in I swear I started hearing your voice saying when to breathe in and out haha and wow by 30 minutes in something must have happened during these 30 days because I swear we got in sync. I would look away from the screen, breathe into the movements and by the time I looked back you were doing the exact same thing! It&#39;s like our minds just were connected (as crazy as that sounds). <br /><br />Thank you for this amazing journey Adriene!!! Looking forward to so much more and this has given me so much more confidence to create my own fulfilling practices when I don&#39;t have access to internet or devices to play these videos.

"for the first time ever I have completed the 30 day challenge with Adriene so feeling absolutely elated. Was feeling a bit emotional before I started Day 30 because I knew this was the last session and was wondering what I&#39;d do next, then when Adriene said she was turning off the mic I felt overwhelmed with emotion. I felt like a baby bird being thrown out of the nest for the first time and not knowing whether I could fly. It was a bit of a nervous first flight but the last 29 days have taken me to this place and I realised I had everything I needed to go solo. I&#39;ll be sticking with Day 30 for a while to help me remember all the moves to create my own unique flow. I could have done with a Day 31...Day 30 with the mic on and Day 31 without, just to save me looking up to see what the next move was going to be but I can&#39;t thank you enough or recommend this challenge enough. It has got me through lockdown so far. I wish you had a 60 challenge!",Alahree McDonell,2020-05-01T11:44:03Z,0
I was so overcome with emotion during the entire thing. It was so wonderful to realise I could trust my body to know what to do and to know the prompts and pointers and to flow. Endless gratitude Adriene❤️,Somedaysoon111,2020-05-01T11:42:58Z,0
"Wow, I thought I’d hate this practice without your guidance but I loved it! I expected myself to be trying to follow your every move but I ended up just doing what felt good. It felt wonderful and it was quite fun when I looked up and saw we’d met in the same pose sometimes. I ended up with a really nice flow that was just what I needed, I actually was more in tune with my breath and my body than ever before and I realised I have everything I need already, I don’t necessarily need someone telling me how to move (though sometimes that is wonderful and I wouldn’t be here on my mat without that.) Thank you so much Adrienne for this 30-day journey, I’ve learned and grown so much, my yoga practice will never be the same again - I’m so much more in tune with my body and my breath, I’ve learned so many new flows and poses as well as improved on how I move in familiar ones. This has really helped me through a difficult month in coronavirus lockdown and helped me give structure to my days. Can’t wait to explore more of your channel, though I can see myself coming back and starting this journey all over again from the beginning sometime as I’ve enjoyed it that much and got so much out of it.

"Thank you Adriene, although I truly don’t know if words can express how I feel. I started this journey on the first of April, thinking it would be a nice way to stretch, breathe, and move. I end feeling stronger, more in control, and more content. I have felt extremely anxious and stressed in quarantine, and your yoga practices have helped me realize that when I am spiraling, a few deep breathes will help me become a little more calm, which can make all the difference. Today, on day 30, I was overwhelmed with feelings of anxiety and helplessness. This practice was exactly what I needed. I was worried about a non-guided practice, but I knew that I had the memory and all of the tools I needed. I now know how much I enjoy yoga, and how it helps me in many ways. I have more confidence in my ability to use how I feel to guide my yoga practice, and I am ever so grateful. I’m very excited to be doing the May yoga calendar, and I cannot wait to see where this journey takes me.<br />Julia",Julia Greiner,2020-05-01T04:40:26Z,0

"I DID IT!!! oh wow, adriene. gosh. im sure you get told this all the time, but this has changed me in so many ways and i will be forever grateful for you. i have been dealing with a panic disorder since i was a little kid. i was agoraphobic for about two years. at the end of last year, i finally managed to get myself to a therapist. a couple months ago, my therapist actually recommended your channel to me. my self esteem is so low and i had no doubt in my mind that i would give up on this. i put it off for the past couple months because i couldnt deal with the disappointment in failing myself yet again. but look where i am now!! day 30!!!! i had those same doubts and fears when you said you were going to be taking off your microphone. i thought that was crazy and i couldnt do it with no guidance. but i reminded myself that i had those same fears going in to day one and i thought to myself &quot;if you can start, you can finish.&quot; and let me just say, that was the fastest 40 minutes of my life. i feel so strong. i cant remember the last time i felt physically AND emotionally strong. these past 30 days have sparked a hope that i thought i had lost forever. i am more than grateful for you and your words and your teaching. thank you, adriene. you have a very special place in my heart.",emme,2020-05-01T01:38:02Z,0

And thank you for making it so easy to fall in love with yoga as I have always been the person who felt like they were too busy or would make some other excuse.

"JUST FINISHED A SECOND GO AROUND! !I never thought I would be &quot;A Yoga Guy&quot;... In December of 2019 I did my first couple YWA sessions (and first ever real yoga sessions for me). I found YWA looking for videos geared towards back and neck pain as I am a graphic designer/single dad and spend most of the day at my desk or chasing around a toddler. I continued these sessions through January and decided to take on the Journey Home for the month of February. In conjunction with a few lifestyle changes, I lost 12 pounds!! I was so happy! What was better yet, my neck and back pain were going away. March was more of an every-other-day yoga practice kind of month and my weight stayed about the same. So in April, especially with the quarantine going on, I decided to take on the challenge for a second time. I&#39;m thrilled to say I lost another 8 pounds, making it an even 20!!!! Not only that, but to see the improvement in my flexibility and strength in that time frame was awesome! So I&#39;ve decided to do another challenge for next month but will take on one of your other sessions (any recommendations?). I honestly haven&#39;t felt so good in years (both physically and mentally).Thank you so much Adrienne, for helping me make this life changing journey.

This was such a perfect culmination of 30 day journey! I’m proud of myself for stepping on to the mat everyday even if it was at 9pm. A few days ago I was thinking about what I would incorporate in a self-guided practice and it was really nice to get to try that out today. The music mix was so lovely. When I found my chivasnisa (sp?)

This last one was particularly challenging. I did my own thing and then looked to Adriene for guidance, and found I was often in sync with her. I will take what I&#39;ve learned and work on trusting myself more. And I&#39;ll continue meeting Adriene on the mat every day!",Purpley Pumpkin,2020-04-30T17:15:58Z,0

I found this really hard and I’m just a little deflated right now. I could do it by myself for around 18 minutes but I had to skip to the end and feel like a failure. I find it too difficult to do this unguided. Feel like I’ve let down the whole journey 😔,Yana Walker,2020-04-30T16:46:58Z,1
I struggled to follow aswell without the mic but just keep repeating the video until you feel confortable. Don&#39;t give up. Youve come this far...you are not a failure x,Alahree McDonell,2020-05-01T11:54:43Z,0

I have tried for years to complete a whole 30 days. It took quarantine to make it a success for me. Thank you for making my home a little less scary for me. Namaste. 💕,Sarah Gray Brenden,2020-04-30T16:46:44Z,1
"Just finished my 30th day, body feels stronger and more limber. Daily meditation practice that comes with it has been really useful for staying grounded during these times. Something that would have made this final practice feel like a better &#39;sendoff&#39; would have been if it were verbal only (very basic, minimal instruction) and no video. <br /><br /><br />Craning my neck out of line with my spine to see the video for the visual queue made me feel frustrated, because I was constantly reacting and playing catch up rather than anticipating how I&#39;m going to transition into the next position. Wasn&#39;t able to sink in and enjoy the juicy parts either because I had to keep an eye on the screen. Hard to turn inward with this format of video.<br /><br /><br />That said, this series is awesome and I&#39;ve recommended it to many friends.Adriene is a wonderful teacher, I love her philosophy of self-compassion and grace, &quot;finding what feels good&quot; makes this practice easier to stick with. Her pacing is perfect and her sense of humor makes me feel at ease. I look forward to doing another series and using her other videos for my home practice!",Kirsten Ourada,2020-04-30T16:33:22Z,1
"Thank you, Adriene. 30 days of Home during the past 30 days of lockdown. Tomorrow morning I can walk for exercise outside my property for the first time since 26 March when the lockdown eases slightly. The daily yoga practice has kept me sane and healthy.",Lennie Metcalf,2020-04-30T16:28:42Z,1
"Today&#39;s practice has been like a catharsis for me. I was getting more and more emotional as the practice was coming to an end. The whole 40 minutes have been a realization that this 30-day journey has taught me a lot. I never thought I could do a whole practice without a voice guiding me... and I did. And I followed my breath all the time. And it has been amazing. And just when I opened my eyes at the end of the practice, I found you smiling, staring right at me and I started crying like a child. Thank you Adriene. I love you.",souslalune,2020-04-30T16:26:49Z,0

"Today is April 30th 2020. I just finished Day 30. When you said that you were turning off your microphone I almost had a sense of panic. How will I know what to do? Then a tiny voice inside me told me that I would know the way. As I sat at the beginning and started deepening my breath I realized how much I look outside myself for the answers, how much I still wasn&#39;t trusting myself. And as I focused on my breath and began my flow with the music of the class today it&#39;s like I knew what I needed to do. I cried at the beginning of this class and the end. AMAZING!!!

"Thank you for such a beautiful month of yoga. I like many in the comments started yoga because I was in self quarantine and couldn’t go to my regular exercise classes. This challenge brought me so much awareness and love for my own body and provided me with a bubble of peace every day to escape the fear and worries I’ve been dragging around. This practice brought me to loving tears once I realized all that I’d learned from you and how much strength I’d gained. Thank you Adriene. Not stopping here, now I think I’m a certified daily yoga addict!",Maddison Langston,2020-04-29T23:34:01Z,0
"Dearest, darling Adriene, and all of you wonderful humans practicing alongside me, thank you. During this quarantine and uncertain point in my life, where I have completed college but am so unsure of the next steps and am anxious about the pandemic, this practice and reading your comments have been a rock. Before quarantine, I never thought yoga was for me. But I have found so much dang peace moving my body with my breath. How unexpected today&#39;s practice was! I had no idea today would be a time for us to try on our own, with Adriene practicing with us. Without Adriene&#39;s voice, oh my goodness, my thoughts came rushing in big time!  Memories of my childhood washed over me, ideas and goals of setting out to do this practice, a deep longing to feel something meaningful or spiritual, reminders to clear my mind and try and focus on my breath. And, for some reason, I sensed a lot of fear/anxiety within my body, within my mind. I think I just have so many gosh darn hopes and dreams, as all of us humans do :) And I really, really, DEEPLY want to strive to be a certain kind of person--someone who just lights up with kindness for herself and others. Hahahaha anyway, as all of this was rushing through my head,  instead of grounding myself to Adriene&#39;s voice, I realized I could do the same thing with the music. So I kept my deep breathing, and did the best I could. Had to toss in some yummy hip-openers! And the 40 minutes did fly by--definitely felt more like twenty. <br /><br /><br />I hope everyone is staying safe and well during this crazy time. Thank you all so much for being here. Thank you Adriene, for making a beautiful way of being/feeling accessible to all. <br /><br /><br />Thank you, Benji, for being Benji. :) <br /><br /><br />I am so scared for what is to come, and sad for certain things that have past. But I also know that there is a beauty in the unknown, and so many people are here along this path with me. I wish you all the very very best. Sending love, sending happy vibes, sending well wishes!!! &lt;3",musicsummer12,2020-04-29T22:46:16Z,0

I didn&#39;t know that was going to be a &quot;special&quot; session, compared to the others, and it really surprised me. It was so emotional! The part when Benji comes close to you and stretch, is so amazing, so touching! I got emotional! Thank you for that moment and for all the others you gave us! You changed my life.

You have kept me company during this time in quarantine and I actually did feel that you were connecting all of us doing yoga at this time. I suddenly felt that I have to continue alone.

"It took so much longer than I anticipated to finish this journey, and I think that&#39;s telling of a lot of my mentalities and neuroses. Even during this practice, I kept finding myself thinking, how much time is left, what pose do I do, should I be doing what she was doing. But a quiet little Adriene voice in the back of my head said something along the lines of &quot;you&#39;re probably thinking, okay I have to do warrior next and *phwoosh * jam into the next pose, but can you find a way to relish in this posture, this moment, right now?&quot; and that was so important to me. I discovered that in yoga, as well as in life, I&#39;m always thinking of what I have to do next, how it needs to be done etc etc, and as such I miss out on so much happening RIGHT NOW. I think that&#39;s what my &quot;Home&quot; is. Right now, in this moment. And it&#39;s surprisingly harder than I thought to live in the moment..<br />I thought that by the end of the 30 days (or 4 months in my case) I&#39;d have figured it all out. That I&#39;d be &quot;Home&quot;. And as such, I felt a bit of... disappointment at the end of this practice? Because there wasn&#39;t any eureka moment, I didn&#39;t feel like &quot;ah, I&#39;m home now.&quot; But I&#39;m proud, because I know that this 30 day challenge was more like a gateway, and a guide, leading me to the road that would take me home. Tomorrow I&#39;ll be attempting to commit to a daily practice, and hopefully as I go, I&#39;ll truly be able to find my way back home.<br />Namaste to everyone who practiced along, wherever you are. And namaste Adriene, thank you for being my guide back home.",honey Blue,2020-04-28T17:11:59Z,0
"The 30th day of yoga with Adriane and she takes the mic off after reminding that all the tools are there, just flow. So many emotions with this. First scared/nervous- I&#39;m not ready. Then moving through it- I got this, I&#39;m awesome at this, I could do this everyday. Then I went through all I thought about but she was still going- I didn&#39;t do enough, I should have kept going, I could have got more, I should have breathed more, I should have held it longer. So I did a few more, I watched as she finished and stayed in savasana so I could be reminded of what I could add, and let myself listen to my thoughts as they passed. Then it comes to a close. I realized that if I&#39;m not doing as much as someone else, it makes me feel bad, but I did what I felt and that&#39;s good enough. I realized that I did some things imperfect and it made me feel bad, but I did them and I&#39;ll improve, so I can let that go and move forward. I realized that meeting myself where I&#39;m at and with empathy will allow me to continue forward.",Elizabeth Galbraith,2020-04-28T16:53:46Z,0

I actually tried to create a session for my partner yesterday (and I did a 20-omething minutes long one) - as if I had known what was comming! Today I started by peaking at you but within a few minutes I was just creating my own flow.

My neck is all tensed up because I always needed to look at you to follow, and this uncertainty also added a level of stress to the practice.

My favorite was when sometimes I’d look up to check in and we’d be doing the same pose! I did about 30 minutes of my own flow and joined back with you at the end because i wasn’t sure how to finish it without your loving namasté!

"Hi Adrienne,<br />I just finished your Home 30 days journey and I can&#39;t tell you how much this meant to me. Two years ago I herniated a disk in my spine and it gave me crippling sciatica- I couldn&#39;t run, bend over, or lift things. I went through physical therapy, started doing weight training to strengthen my back. During quarantine I finally have had the time and been feeling healed enough to try out yoga again for the first time in years. This sessions meant the world to me, to come to the end of the 30 days and feel flexible, strong, and anchored in my body in a way I haven&#39;t in years. Thank you! At one point during the flow I did a forward fold and grabbed my toes, not to prove anything, but just because it felt good, and it made me tear up because two years ago my doctor told me it was possible I&#39;d never be able to touch my toes again, even with exercise. So, two years post injury I&#39;m getting my Personal Training certification and transitioning into a career in fitness because fitness changed my life and gave me my body back, and this 30 days working through the Home series has felt like another integral and powerful step in my recovery. Blessings, thank you, mwah!",Joshua Haddock,2020-04-27T17:05:58Z,0

"This was the first time for me that I became so one with my own imagination. Everytime I looked up to my ceiling, I saw treetops with their green leaves and a blue sky, everytime we where in mountain pose, I became a mountain and I saw that I was joined with many snowy mountain tops all around, everytime we bend forward to the ground, I saw my own eyes in the reflection of a pool of water. In the end I was laying in a beautiful maddow surrounded by flowers and trees. I could hear my own voice loud and clear telling me &#39;everything I thought I couldn&#39;t not do, I can learn. Everything. I am so much stronger than I think. I actually DO love myself. Thank you to myself, for gifting me this care and movement, and thank you Adrienne&#39;. It was wonderful. I brought nature in my home. Thank you so much Adrienne!!",C VH,2020-04-27T14:07:43Z,3
"i loved this, but i wish that there was at least a simple voice command about what pose to go into so that i didn&#39;t have to constantly look at my computer. i have a tiny space with only one way i can orient my mat, and one place the computer can sit, so my head was turned to the right the entire practice trying to watch you which was painful for the neck and not great for my balance. :(  so happy to have completed the 30 days but a bit sad about today&#39;s practice because of that.",Karin Feltman,2020-04-27T13:50:04Z,0

"Oh Adriene, what a journey! I loved every single day of this journey. I must say I got scared when you said you would put the mic off. I was so stressed and I was sure I wouldn&#39;t be able to keep up the pace. But then, everytime I would turn my head to look at the screen, I would see you smiling back at us. Every. Single. Time. It gave me so much strength. I was hoping to hear your sweet voice at the end of the video... But when I looked up, I saw a black screen with a wonderful quote from O&#39;Donohue. It made me smile until I saw my own reflection on the screen, it&#39;s like I was smiling to myself. And what a wonderful smile it was. I was (and still am) so happy. I burst into tears, tears of joy, pride and love. I couldn&#39;t have hoped for a better ending.<br />How do you do this, Adriene? Thank you so much!

"Today I finished this 30 day journey, which was also the beggining of yoga for me. I must say it changed my life in so many ways. I feel more relaxed, my mindset is more in focus, my anxiety moment got so much better and so on. I can&#39;t wait to continue this amazing journey but most of all I just wanted to say thank you Adriene for everything! Thank you for guiding me with your beautiful soul. I am so grateful I got introduced to yoga with your channel. Also wanted to share these two quotes that got stuck with me: blanket yourself with love and where attention goes, energy flows. Namaste!",Nika,2020-04-26T16:12:58Z,0
"hi Adriene! I have been following your videos for years, and whenever I feel bad, I&#39;ve got used to opening a video and &#39;hop into something comfy&#39;. I have tried some of your 30-day journeys before, but I couldnt ever finished. this time i did it! I started and finished HOME while these times &#39;being home&#39;. Your guidance is soo good for my anxiety in this process and before that! and i was shocked bcs of discovering what im capable of while improving both physically and mentally each day.<br />while following your silence instruction, i caught you were smiling whenever i guessed you would be smiling to courage us. and i could guess whenever you were relaxing your neck or wiggling your fingers. that was amazing. thank you so much for your existence ❊❊",Duygu Saygı,2020-04-26T15:36:55Z,0

Thank you so much Adriene for these videos and for today&#39;s practice especially. It was simply the perfect way to end these 30 days. I actually got very emotional at the end which surprised me. I started this journey at the end of March when we had been in lockdown for about 10 days in Ireland already and I was not coping well with the lack of routine and feeling very lonely. Practicing yoga for the last 30 days has not only made the last month bearable but actually enjoyable. I am definitely not going to stop my daily practice and will follow May&#39;s monthly calendar. Thank you again so much.,Alice8,2020-04-26T11:13:19Z,0

I can actually touch my toes with straight legs, and do a sort of proper downward dog now! Thank you for making this series. It&#39;s really helped me to work through mental health issues and begin learning better discipline and do good things for myself again. Now I&#39;m gonna go do your previous 30 days of yoga series!

I started to tear up as soon as I sat on my mat this morning.

This has helped me so much and I couldn&#39;t be happier to have shared with you and loads of other people these first 30 days of the rest of my life. Also, I am in love with all the instrumental used in this video but I must say the main theme of HOME is the most subtle but encouraging tune I have heard and I would love to know where I could get it. Truly, a masterpiece as all of the videos. I can&#39;t wait to do all your practices and support you in the future like you have done with me throughout this journey.

I have a question for the Day 30 Journey, do you recommend if we are practice it during our menstruation? because I like and enjoy doing it. I already try the video you posted related to PMS and Cramps, really helped during my 1st day of my period to relief my cramps. But I guess the rest of the period cycle I want a little bit sweat, let me know which video is recommended during menstruation with a little bit sweat. Thank you.

"It&#39;s crazy how much of an impact you&#39;ve made on my life and the life of others. Before starting your first ever 30 day yoga journey with my dad, I never understood the power of yoga, and what a blessing it truly is. I used to be ashamed of saying &quot;I like doing yoga&quot; and was scared of what other people thought. Now, 3 series later, I can proudly say I love yoga. I love the power it brings me, I love the sweat that drips off my forehead when you say &quot;come on 2 more.&quot; I love relaxing on my bed after a long 30 minute session. I&#39;ve never felt like this before. I&#39;ve reached day 30 many times before, and it doesn&#39;t matter how many times you&#39;ve reached the end point, but what you learned and the journey you took that got you there. This 30 day expierence was truly different. My body spoke to me, it kept moving without me doing anything. I&#39;ve found what feels good, and it&#39;s all because of you. Thank you so much. I hope a new 30 day series comes out soon:) much love",Catalina C.,2020-04-25T03:08:29Z,2

At day 1, I would watch my phone all the time and wouldn’t know how to properly concentrated or if I was actually breathing (I’ve a tendency to hold my breath) But when the practice ended today, I realized that I’ve created my own practice and experience today and that it lasted around 40 minutes, I started crying and felt so proud and had this feeling of fullness, I don’t know how to describe it, but thank you Adriene for this amazing journey. I can’t wait to start another one 🤍",Luisa Maria,2020-04-25T01:10:34Z,2

"Dear Adrienne, <br />I started and ended this practise with tears rolling down my cheeks. I started practising with you in 2017, but could never make it through a whole 30 days of yoga. I&#39;ve been on and off since then, never feeling like I had the time or mental energy to fully commit to an everyday practise. <br />I began this yoga journey Home 30 days ago, on the day that New Zealand entered its first day of lockdown. I figured that I would have the time and need the routine, and I was right on both accounts. Although most of my practises ended up being in the wee hours of the morning, I began to treasure the twenty minutes we spent together. You became a beacon of certainty in this time of huge emotional and mental turmoil. You allowed me to take back ownership of my body, kept me moving even on my most difficult of days, and most importantly allowed me to feel truly proud of accomplishing 30 continuous days of yoga. <br />We are exiting the strictest stage of lockdown at the start of next week, and I can&#39;t wait to take your wisdom and daily practise back into the world with me. <br />Thank you so much for what you do. You are so good at it!!! XXXXXX",Lily Wright,2020-04-24T13:42:01Z,0

"Okay I have to admit, at the beginning I was quite anxious as this was my first 30-day yoga journey with Adriene. I was following Adriene for the first few mins today, trying to match her movements while trying to be mindful of myself as well. But after 7 mins or so, I must&#39;ve done something different and I was like &quot;you know what? Might as well do my version of the flow today&quot; and I did. At the end, I did savasana just to reflect on my progress today. It felt amazing and empowering. Thank you, Adriene.",Virenne,2020-04-23T22:05:44Z,0
i started and made it all the way through &quot;HOME&#39; during my quarantine. We&#39;re in a time when it&#39;s hard not to be stressed about whats happening. YWA has helped me relax and be more a ease with the stress. And I can celebrate the fact that this is my first 30 days with Adriene. Thanks Adriene! You are the best!

"I started this 30 days ago and am so proud of myself for not missing a day! I danced for 15 years as a child/teen so now I&#39;m in my early 20s with way more joint, hip, and back issues than I should have. I haven&#39;t been able to keep up with any sort of exercise routinely since I stopped dancing at 18 and this is the first time I&#39;ve kept at something for more than 5 days in a row. I&#39;ve been blown away by the difference this has made in my daily pain levels. Looking forward to starting one of the other 30 days tomorrow!",LyriumGhost97,2020-04-23T19:44:28Z,0

"This was an incredible journey.<br />I started this 30 day yoga sessions because I had been diagnosed with coronavirus about a month ago and the breathing difficulties plus the chest pains stopped me from doing any sport of any kind. I thought it would be a nice way for me to simply move a little since I couldn&#39;t even go for a walk but it had been so much more. The breathing exercices and the relaxation helped A LOT with my breathing troubles but also calmed my anxieties (corona or not corona related). Plus, seeing such a nice and conforting person every day was a true blessing during those hard times. <br />Thank you so much Adrienne for this journey. You&#39;ve really helped me and you&#39;re a fantastic human being.",Calliopei,2020-04-23T16:29:18Z,0

"Dear Adriene,<br /><br />Honestly, I admit my 30th day practice was not my best practice through out this Home journey. For the first half of the video, somehow I was irked by the abscence of your voice guidance and I couldn&#39;t keep my breathing steady. I was frustrated.<br /><br />I found it really surprising, since I always love your sessions, this was the first! I even paused and tried to assess my feelings. Like, what is going on??<br /><br />After calming down, I tried to continue the video. Then, throughout the last half, I could feel my &#39;inner&#39;  was stopped. My feeling is not flowing, stagnant. And while doing the movements and listening to the music, I wept. My tears just melted and melted.<br /><br />I think everybody is trying to adapt during this pandemic, so does myself. And i thought i am doing okay, but clearly I am not. I had a feeling I had numbed myself so I could have my quarantine days at home undisturbed.<br /><br />But through this 30th day practice, my stagnant feeling started to flow again. I communicated with myself, accepting that I am not okay and so does everyone in this world.<br /><br />Then, I remembered. Journey home is not always smooth one, and I am gladly accept this with an open heart.<br /><br />Thank you for this experience, Adriene. May we all accept our feelings, good and bad.

"I just finished this practice down here in SW Austin, typing from my yoga mat, quarantined at home like the rest of us. Pretty emotional right now -- been a tough 24 hours. My old dog, Henry, hurt his shoulder on a long walk in Slaughter Creek and had to go to the vet yesterday where I couldn&#39;t even get out of the car to be with him while they examined him. He&#39;s okay, just getting old, they said. But I was reminded kind of crushingly of his mortality, and then of everyone&#39;s mortality, this thing we&#39;re all thinking about but not really saying or implicating ourselves in. And so, when Benji entered the show today -- his down dog turned into your down dog turned into my down dog -- I just kinda felt it all again. I&#39;m so glad to be home with Henry, so glad that I completed this journey -- I&#39;d never done much yoga before this. A few classes at the gym this winter, but that&#39;s about it. I feel more now, I think. This has helped me so much, allowed me access to things I didn&#39;t know were there, made me stronger and more vulnerable at the same time. I can&#39;t thank you enough. I really mean that. What you do here is such a generosity. You&#39;re helping the world so much, and I&#39;m so grateful.",Adam Boles,2020-04-22T15:28:10Z,0

"I will be honest, every time day 30 swings around I find myself lacking the courage (and the perseverance!)  to be alone with myself for whatever amount of time I need. However, this session was different in many ways. I did not have time to practice in the morning, so it was moved to the night. That said, I have not had the pleasure to brave the final day of 30 Days of Yoga, I found the silence to be intimidating. I struggled to be utterly alone with myself, and whenever the final session would swing by, I would just begin a new 30 days of Yoga journey. Yet, I found myself willingly, albeit a bit nervously, participating this time around. I followed you, but I did deviate and included multiple push-ups and intense moments where I found myself pushing myself not under your guidance, but my own. I wept at the end of it, for I truly felt I had found my way home. This quarantine has put my mind in places I did not think it could go, and yet you managed to gently pull me away from the edge and guide me home. Thank you, Adriene. I have been following your practices for nearly a year now, and I found incredible joy and pride when I whispered the names of the poses out of recognition. I cannot thank you enough, you are the universal yogi and have brought immense amounts of peace into my life, Thank you so much. Namaste. 🌱✨",retr0gue,2020-04-22T05:07:06Z,0

My wife and I just finished this 30 day journey during our self-isolation (our first proper experience with yoga). The last day was pretty tricky as we got used to being guided by your voice and had to keep looking at the screen but overall we learnt alot during these past 30 days and are stronger and enjoyed it. Any suggestions from you or the community on where to go next? Any recommended series to follow now we have finished this?,Craig Monger,2020-04-21T15:01:23Z,0

"I decided to just do what felt right for as long as I could without looking up for guidance. I went more than 20 minutes with my &#39;own flow.&#39; I surprised myself with what I was willing to bring, and how much I&#39;ve grown in these 34 days. (Yes, that&#39;s how long it took me.

"i finished this Journey to Home yoga today, and i gotta say that this has surely had a massive impact on me. i started this Journey along with journaling together to practice self-love and balance in my life. had never done yoga before so never would i ever have thought that these two combined would change me this much! i feel like i have finally found that inner spark that i have in myself and learned how to listen to my heart. as someone struggling with mental illness atm, this yoga Journey really has had a positive impact on me (and reading all of the supportive community messages after every practice in the comments!)

"Thank you, Adriene. There were so many days that I didn&#39;t feel like coming to the mat, but I did. Some days I felt enlightened and had all the warm fuzzy yoga feelings, some days I was frustrated and couldn&#39;t wait to be done, some days I cried at the end. But your encouragement and soft voice got me through 30 days (in quarantine, no less). I truly thank you for sharing the gifts that God has given you and that you have clearly worked so hard to cultivate and connect to. You&#39;ve got a new subscriber out of me!

"Today I finished this journey and what a journey it has been! I started doing yoga because I was bored for being home all day due to COVID-19 and I thought this would be a nice challenge. I didn&#39;t count on yoga being something I looked forward to at the end of each day or something I would continue doing after this challenge was done. But here I am; day 30 of the challenge and so not ready to leave yoga behind. <br />When I saw that this last video was 41 minutes I almost didn&#39;t do it because God I&#39;m tired today, but I sat down on my mat and pressed play. When I heard that you wouldn&#39;t guide us like you normally do, I almost stopped this video, cause there was no way I could do yoga alone and just make it all up. But now I was already on the mat, so I didn&#39;t feel like giving up already. So I tried. Just doing what felt good. And then all of a sudden the music stopped and I was about to complain that you turned off the music mid video. Until i realized, that the video was done and I had made my own yoga rutine for the last 40 minutes. <br />Thank you for showing me that I can do this and the hardest part really is showing up &lt;3",Line Vahl-Møller,2020-04-20T19:37:08Z,0

And I feel strong and will definitely continue with yoga and you.<br />But that being said.... am I the only one who prefers you with mic on?  This was the worse day. I actually hurt my back because I had to keep straining to look at the screen. UGH  I didn&#39;t realize how much I just went off your instruction.

It’s let me see just how much I can do (always felt slightly worried I’d make a fool of myself in yoga class) and inspired me to continue practicing to make it to the ones that are more challenging! Look forward to seeing you tomorrow (on the screen) to discover all your other practices. Xx,Chrys K,2020-04-18T08:57:39Z,0

"Thank you so much for introducing me to yoga Adrienne. I’ve always wanted to try it but never sticked with it. One good thing about quarantine is that I finally got time for myself every morning and I could follow your practices day after day.

"Thank you from the bottom of my heart for the last 30 days - I started this a few days into our self-isolation.  It seemed like a good time to commit to daily practice, but what I found is that it quickly became a way to let each day and so much sad news and anxiety go.  We still have so much to be grateful for.  So now should I start another 30 day session?",Genevieve Munro,2020-04-17T22:59:04Z,2

I started the first practice on day 1 of this COVID-19 here in Canada, so your influence has definitely improved my quality of life. I even recommended your channel to my coworkers, so if your subscribers increased 2 weeks ago, that was me :) Well, of course, among many other followers. Now I&#39;m wondering, what&#39;s next? What do you recommend to stay in this new yoga lifestyle? This is my very first time doing 30 days non-stop yoga, so I&#39;m inspired to go on!",Jessi Z.,2020-04-17T16:48:45Z,0

"Just finished the 30 day challenge during this quarantine and I can say I really enjoyed it. More than I ever thought I would. It was an amazing- perfect way to start to explore with these practices that made feel good and challenged. The toughest part was to show up, after that the rest was manageable. I will continue to explore the channel. Thank you for these videos Adriene. 🙏😊 🧘‍♀️",Lis Ortiz,2020-04-17T14:48:43Z,0
"I can’t believe I finished this series! Today while following you in this practice, I could hear you saying certain things... but my body went to a pose and knew what came next.....I absolutely loved it....to think about when I first started there were poses I couldn’t do, but today I was able to do them. I’m still working on the crow pose. When first starting I started because I wanted to find happiness, but I found so much more; self-love, sense of calm, mindfulness, a stress reliever, and a power boaster!  I’ve been recommending you to everyone I know! I’m definitely going to continue with your series! I love that you have yoga for everything even when your upset and angry! Plus, I love how chill Benji is; my 3 are NEVER that calm!💕💕❤️🧘🏽‍♀️🙏🏽💨NAMASTE",Kat Latimer,2020-04-17T14:44:26Z,0
"I started this during self-quarantine and went through with it. I would&#39;ve never believed that I could pull through with 30 days of yoga but I proved myself wrong, I sticked to it every single day and was (almost ;) )always excited to get on the mat even at 11pm haha. It was actually fun and I&#39;ve never experienced that with any other type of sport/home workout before.

This has been my 5th time doing a 30 day challenge. And thus one just felt different. Today I did my yoga practice with my eyes closed the whole time it just felt so good to listen to my body. I may have not done it live and took more than 30 days to complete but I made it to the end so happy to see day 30 and hopefully will keep doing daily yoga.

"Well, I&#39;m writing a comment for the first time to thank you for this journey. I started it a week before the UK first when into lockdown for C-19 (already had a regular practice and dipped in and out of yours every so often) as I wanted something to help me stay healthy in both body and mind as I dealt with a huge amount of uncertainty, for both myself and my loved ones, of whom I miss dearly. It... truly truly has. I&#39;m finishing this practice stronger, and happier than when I started - despite everything that has happened in that 30 days outside of the mat. I am finishing with tears - mostly of joy and gratitude. And a promise that I will keep coming back, every day, until the end of lockdown and beyond. Thank you for bringing me home, when home wasn&#39;t always necessarily where I wanted to be. You have helped, in so many ways Adriene.

This was my first ever 30 day yoga challenge  of yours and I thoroughly enjoyed it on every level. Though I have been doing yoga on and off for several years, nothing has made me gain progress quite like this has, both mentally and physically. My downward dogs are better aligned, my balances last longer and I am stronger!! I thought I&#39;d be the only person still doing this in March/April, but the comments here have proven me wrong.

I was experiencing for the last few days terrible chest pain and difficulty breathing due to stress, and I wasn&#39;t able to enjoy this last sequence. I was in pain every time I inhaled. I burst into tears on the mat, letting go of all the stress I accumulated since this pandemic crisis began, and had to wait a few days for the pain to leave. I came back to the mat today, did this final practice with a giant smile on my face and a few tears of happiness at the end. I feel so strong and confident.

I did the final day at 6am with the sun breaking through the mist in gorgeous East Cork - I nearly shrieked with excitement at the John O’Donohue quote which seems SO apt this morning. 30 days in a row - my intention for this exercise was to control what I can and release what I can’t - in the middle of lockdown with scary news every day it was a reminder to control my own behaviour and actions and let go everything else.

After recovering from two back surgeries, yoga seemed like a practice I would never be able to enjoy. Thank you for creating such a warm, comfortable environment to learn, listen and grow. You are simply lovely and I appreciate all you do to help so many. This was a welcoming adventure in such challenging times. 🥰❤️🙏🏻",A Bell,2020-04-13T22:20:09Z,0

"Adriene thank you so much for all this journey has shown me throughout the time I&#39;ve been here with you. I started this Yoga HOME journey in Februrary and I used it as a tool to ease my anxieties of going through a breakup and handling the stresses of a first year teacher. Personally I have always struggled with consistency, and finishing things that I have started so to be here on day 30 (even though it is well into April), I am so so proud of my self. I feel that I have learned the tools necessary to calm my mind, body, and spirit. Thank you so much for this and all that you do. To everyone who reached this point, you are awesome and you are loved by all outside of you and inside. Your soul thanks you! :)",Anashia Williams,2020-04-13T15:55:20Z,0

"Today, without your voice as a guide, it was really hard for me. I had to pick at you a lot of times, and that kinda hurted my neck; i couldn&#39;t concentrate on my breath and, above all, I had to constantly fight with the fear that I didn&#39;t learn anything in the past 30 days. But, despite all this factors, I was able to manage it somehow, and at some point even to relax and find my balance. I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t stop. Thank you Adriene!",Beatrice Morra,2020-04-13T11:41:19Z,1
Thank you for giving us this Adrienne. I feel so good after these 30 days that I intend to do yoga every morning for the rest of my life. <br />Lockdown is a brilliant opportunity to get yourself fit and learn new stuff and this has been the best thing I’ve done.,allyzally,2020-04-13T08:51:28Z,0
"Ive been practising yoga for almost 20 years and also taught, its always shown me that I am always a student. But Adrienne, you reminded me that I also have an inner teacher, thank you for guiding me there. I love what you do, so authentic, so true to you and so open. I try to get my daughters inspired through you. I can only give my gratitude to you, and look forward to starting the next day another 30 day program because you and Benjy baby are such great company during quarantine. I wish you much love.

"Adriene enjoy this 30 day journey, it was wonderful truly . However the silent last video really didn’t work for me. I live in a tiny studio apartment where the only configuration I can put my mat is long ways facing the TV, which means basically any time I’m facing down I have no idea what you’re doing. I mean I have some idea after 30 days of this but I can’t predict what kind of lunge you’ll come out of a gold with or whether your going to stack up or when to come out of downward dog. It was so hard and I kept wrenching my neck to see what you were doing. I didn’t give up but I didn’t have a great experience with the last day.",KreBstarProduct,2020-04-12T23:01:23Z,0

"Because of how welcoming, adaptable, thoughtful, and inspiring your videos are I got into yoga in the first place. I was so sceptical towards this whole &quot;westernized spirituality&quot; that didn&#39;t believe I will enjoy it. I have completed my first uninterrupted playlist, and I can (with surprise) admit that not only it&#39;s now my favorite type of home exercise, it has yielded fantastic results for my damaged nerve, improved anxiety, brought energy, and is generally keeping me sane during quarantine. That is entirely because of your personality and approach. (And Benji.) You are doing amazing, important work. Thank you.",Jane Palash,2020-04-12T02:56:28Z,0

"I just wanted to say thank you for this excellent 30 day practice.  I have never been able to figure out a practice when doing yoga at home.  I would find myself questioning everything I did.  After this 30 day journey, I just completed my first at home practice where I just did what I knew my body needed.  Nothing more, and nothing less.  I got really scared at first when you said you were taking off the mic and not cuing us into the poses but I just followed my instincts and what I had learned from your previous videos and also stuff that I had learned from previous instructors.  I was crying by the end of the video because I was so thankful that I was able to do a full 35/40 minute practice basically on my own.  Thank you so much for sharing your gift!  You are truly inspirational!!",Liz Rioux,2020-04-08T16:32:05Z,0
"I can&#39;t believe what these 30 days of yoga did for my body and mind, especially my body. I was so stiff and sore on the neck, shoulders, back, you name it. My posture was terrible, I was tired all the time, headaches, etc. My sister lifts weights and she always told me that I should do it too to strengthen my back. She has been doing it for years and she still has occasional back pain. After 30 days of yoga, it&#39;s all gone for me... I&#39;m not a spiritual person at all, but you don&#39;t have to be to enjoy yoga. I never liked exercising because it always felt like a chore. When I was on the gym for a year I obviously noticed my body changed, fat was gone, muscles were in, but I almost never really felt a big difference. Now I know why. Today I am so aware of my body that I almost FEEL it changing, like on the inside and not just when I look at the mirror. It&#39;s honestly amazing and kinda... spiritual?? What is this sorcery, Adriene?? I am not a spiritual person! Am I? One thing I know for sure though: I am never looking back. I finally found a physical activity that makes me feel good and doesn&#39;t feel like a chore and I think it has done more for me mentality than I realize. I feel confident enough to make my own yoga flow from now on, but I&#39;ll come back to your channel always and do your other videos too (and new ones!). I just did this video but I&#39;m already missing your company, haha.  You have a subscriber for life. Continue being the beautiful human being that you are.

"This may be an unpopular opinion but I highly dislike that you took off the sound, I couldn&#39;t finish the video because it wasn&#39;t even relaxing for me. <br /><br />My neck and back were hurting more because I was constantly having to look forward during every pose to see what you were doing. My muscles in my abdomen and leg were twisted the wrong way because I was unsure of which way to turn without guidance and how to do certain moves without looking up. The constant looking up and doing the move wrong without guidance ruined my whole calm and made me anxious.<br /><br />I thought maybe the point is to make up our own flow rather than follow yours then why include the video at all then? Why not just tell us to practice on our own or put a calming scene? Because I tried doing my own thing but then would get anxiety see you in a completely different motion. I&#39;m here to be taught yoga, if I wanted to create my own flow I wouldn&#39;t even be here. <br /><br />I couldn&#39;t finish it because I decided finally to just not try to follow you at all but then I run out of moves to do...I am a beginner so I can do a couple basic things but expecting me to do 40 whole minutes of freestyle is a bit much in my opinion :/ <br /><br />I think for my 30th day I will just go follow one of your videos on yoga for neck or back pain and do that instead now that those areas are screwed up from this. That&#39;s what feels good for me. To each their own.",Ashley Breding,2020-04-08T03:03:55Z,1
fuhbloom i feel the same way as the original commenter. I can maybe freestyle for 5-10 minutes but then I get frustrated. That’s just where/how I am. I typically skip the last video in each journey because I don’t like them.,Tasmanian Devil,2020-04-15T06:23:33Z,1
"If you followed Adriene for 29 videos then you have the basic moves to make your own flow or at least enough that a slight glimpse to the video would instantly remind you what move that is and what comes next. The point of the video is that you didn&#39;t have to follow it to the letter. Even if you did a different version of this or that, it&#39;s all good! But well, yes, each to their own. Each person is different, maybe you can&#39;t do these things without looking for guidance, but considering you went through all 30 days, this video wasn&#39;t that hard to follow if you wanted to follow it. And you should know what type of teacher Adriene is by now. She highly encourages people to do their own thing, freestyle and &quot;find what feels good&quot; for them. She likes to play around and have fun and yoga isn&#39;t a strict physical activity for her that has to be done this or that way. There are plenty of other Yoga videos out there where it&#39;s all business, straight to the point, maybe those would suit you better.",fuhbloom,2020-04-08T11:58:55Z,0

I trust you &amp; I trust myself, yet I found this ending somewhat difficult...all of the days before I liked hearing you, and didn&#39;t need to watch much to follow as I practiced, but in this episode I found it more distracting while wanting to relax and flow with the music, yet needing to continuously glance at my computer screen to see what you were doing next. Love everything you do , but just some feedback to let you know I found this more distracting than peaceful.",Ashley Joy,2020-04-07T10:33:36Z,1

"Well, here I am...stuck at home, but also finally at home. I started on January 1st and didn&#39;t know how or if I would finish, but today I proved to myself that I could do it. Today&#39;s practice, itself, was a journey--I didn&#39;t know if I would be good enough to lead myself, remember enough to come up with things to do, and then somewhere along the way I just felt it. I ended up doing a crow pose because that was what my body wanted. And just as I got ready to dip my first boat pose because I was feeling it, Adriene did the same thing, and I smiled!

"It&#39;s April 6th, quarantine in Moscow and the first day of a new cycle. I am achey, irritated, low, generally upset and have a mild cold. <br />I was so angry at myself for feeling this way, as I&#39;ve been looking forward to this practice immensely. I felt like I failed, ruined everything, succumbed to despair and disappointed the very essence of Yoga with Adriene. Breath lots of love in sounded like a cruel joke today (especially considering the blocked nose). I wanted to postpone until I felt better.<br />But I showed up. And decided to allow myself to just BE. With who I am today. And move in a way that feels good today. <br />I cried through most of the practice and did the silliest moves, but my Half Moon was the best it&#39;s ever been. And then I look up - and Adriene is doing it, too. And I remember that we all have days like this, every single one of us. It&#39;s universal.<br />So why not embrace it? Sometimes this is where my head is, and it’s a part of my Home.  And it’s also good, because in it’s own twisted, neurotic, touchy way it want the best for me, tries to protect me.<br />I am my Home.<br />And I am ready to face the day with tenderness and love  - for myself.<br />Adriene, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. You have changed my life for the better.",KSoloviev,2020-04-06T11:17:31Z,1
"Thank you so much for a beautiful journey, your generosity is incredible. Just some gentle feedback (and I can see that I am in the minority in not having enjoyed this class), I wear glasses to read and see screens. If Adriene is speaking, I can make out what is going on without my glasses but if not I have to wear them, which meant that they were in the way and kept falling off. So I didn&#39;t finish. I will use another session to end my 30 day journey. With love and deep gratitude.",Sascha Polkey,2020-04-06T06:15:09Z,0

"I&#39;m not going to lie- I thought about stopping this video about 4 times during practice today and just ending it there.<br />I thought 40 min, all this flow, choreographed, this is too much, too hard.<br />I got into a real wave of depression all day and honestly didn&#39;t even expect to be doing this last video. I looked through some pictures that made me laugh, got a glass of water, and turned it on.<br /><br /><br />When these thoughts came up I had to remind myself what I&#39;ve learned these past thirty days - that I don&#39;t have to compare myself to anyone, that I can find what feels good. For me that meant some extra childs poses for breaks and chaturagas because I really enjoyed how my arms muscles felt in them. <br /><br /><br />This past thirty days has not been easy. And I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m not like OH MY GOD THIS JOURNEY WAS AWESOME AND WONDERFUL AND IM HOOKED ON YOGA. A lot of times, it was super hard. My mind would wander, I would get mad at myself for not wanting to work hard enough, yadda yadda. But it&#39;s not how easy it is that gives it value. It&#39;s how strong I&#39;ve become in the process, how fluid my movements are, are clear my mind can be. It&#39;s about regaining control over who I am and who I want to be, while cherishing what is. This journey has given me confidence, strength, and power. And that&#39;s why it has meant so much to me.",Annalise Gallagher,2020-04-05T04:15:47Z,0
"I came into Day 30 very emotionally heightened and feeling like all I needed was to be told what to do so I was pretty upset and ready to look for another video when I learned this final practice was the exact opposite of that.

"Touched.... I started the session around mid-January with very low path like 1 day a week. Then ever since the lockdown in Italy started from early March, my second part of the 30 days yoga gets to be done with a much more frequent practice...... Probably i managed to finish Day 18 to Day 29 in two weeks of quarantine home. As some followers of Adriene have already mentioned in their comments,  I was really touched when I heard the theme music in the end of this Day 30 session... ❣️ <br />The memories of self following each step during the 30 days instruction all coming back to the mind freed by the movements from the anxious lockdown and hard time....<br />Thank you Andriene and I definitely feel more encouraged to my next path of plenitude!  Namaste! 🙏",Ping Chang,2020-04-01T12:02:47Z,0

"Dear Adrienne. Thank you. Thank you with all my heart. I did this yoga journey in January-February, and then life overtook me and there was three sessions I didn&#39;t finish. Until a few days ago, after two weeks of confinement, I came back and wanted to finish. I find magical that the days aligned so beautifully. This morning, I decided to give myself silence and no outside noise in the morning in no form at all (whether it be a book, a podcast, a text message or anything) and I was delighted to find out that the practice was in silence as well. It was my favourite. And then at the end, deep sobs came out. Because, today was supposed to be the day where I moved to a new city and finally start building a new life. I obviously cannot due to the circumstances. This session allowed me to live this emotion, to be disappointed, but to also know that it will be ok and that home is within. So thank you, I appreciate you and what you do. It is truly magical. Best of luck in these times.",Lucie Aidart,2020-03-31T11:17:43Z,0

Like others I started this journey to home in March. Partially because I wanted to get into yoga and it turned into so much more! I thought I trusted my body but this journey has given me an entirely new meaning - especially since we’re quarantined. This has been the thing that gets me out of bed. Can’t lie - I was very scared when she said that she wouldn’t have a mic. But it was wonderful! I was able to trust my institution and find what felt good. I even developed mini flows of my own in between following you. Thanks so much!!,9ajack,2020-03-30T19:21:17Z,17

"I just finished the 30 day journey. (Better late than never). All I have to say is, there were days I made excuses but i did every video. It took me longer than 30 days to do it but I’m still proud. Couldn’t ask for a better yoga teacher. It seems like Adriene always knows what to say and even her corny little jokes make me laugh at the worst times but it makes me feel more connected to her if that makes any sense. These videos not only challenged me, but helped with my mental and physical health. I’ve recommended YWA to so many people. This last video, I was kind of hesitant on because she wasn’t going to guide us. But I trusted, not only in Adriene, but myself and pushed through. Thank you so much Adriene.",Gabrielle Alley,2020-03-29T15:50:27Z,0
"Hi Adriene,<br /><br /><br />I really hope you get to read this. I am a person who struggled severely with an eating disorder. I entered residential treatment in October of 2019 and am currently in an IOP program. Your videos were recommended to me by one of the therapists, and I am so glad she told me about you. I have a history of over exercise to the point of destroying my body. You are helping me to cultivate a better relationship with my body, and to find a way to move that empowers rather than tears down. Each day along my journey with you, I&#39;m learning how to move mindfully for health, rather than to burn calories or judge/critic my body.  You are truly making an impact on my recovery journey, and I couldn&#39;t be more grateful for that.",Katherine Larson,2020-03-29T15:25:51Z,0

It was my first time to do yoga continously for a longer period of time and now I know, I will keep it up and stay with you and your practices, it&#39;s perfect to start into the day. Thanks a lot, all the best from Austria. Leon",22Striker05,2020-03-28T09:17:33Z,0

"Even Benji sensed downward dog was coming! 😍This practice was so enriching... following you at times, others trusting and letting go, with courage and intuition. What a wonderful way to finish the journey back home. Last Namaste brought some tears. 🙏🏼Thank you Adriene for the whole path you walked with me, feel connected again to my practice and my life.",Maite López,2020-03-28T08:06:00Z,0
I really really enjoyed this journey up until today.  I didn&#39;t like the fact that you didn&#39;t tell me what to do and I couldn&#39;t watch you and do the yoga. As a teacher I make a million decisions everyday.  It is comforting to have someone tell me what to do.  I really needed today but I was very disappointed that you took off the mike.  I will continue doing yoga with you but this thirtieth day was not enjoyable at all.,Debbie Dawson,2020-03-28T03:01:07Z,1
"This is the only thing that kept me consistent. I looked forward to every day and can proudly say I didn&#39;t skip one - even if some days I didn&#39;t want to show up in the mat. This journey made my life better and made yoga a very important part of my day. Thank you Adriene for this amazing experience. I will now continue a daily practice with you and the crazy range of videos you have on your channel. I highly recommend the 30 days to everyone - I was a complete beginner and now I&#39;m stronger, my balance is really improved as well as my flexibility. I can do a Crow with no issues now, and that was the biggest challenge!<br />Go for it!",Katarina Lazic,2020-03-27T21:05:00Z,0
There’s no words to describe how amazing this 30 days have been. Tears of happiness running through my face. Just love and gratitude for you. Thanks Adriene! Namaste 🙏🏼,Eliana García,2020-03-27T18:31:48Z,0
"I just finished this 30 day practice! I am so grateful and to my surprise when you said that we&#39;d be leading this session on our own I was overwhelmed with emotions of sadness for the end of the journey, happiness and fear that I can lead myself, and gratitude that I have people around to guide me I started to cry. I needed a good cry and needed 30 days of yoga with you Adriene. Thank you so much! My practice today was good, I challenged myself and nurtured myself. Thank you.",CompostBucket,2020-03-27T16:14:58Z,0

Thanks for the HOME series. I couldn&#39;t start with you on Jan 1 but I made sure that I completed each day. This last day was interesting. It really does show that I just need to show up on the mat and the rest will follow. Namaste Adriene.,AndrewandBertha Pilgrim,2020-03-27T12:54:18Z,0
"My darling Adriene, you made me cry today the minute you went onto the matt and smiled silently to camera a surge of emotional energy somewhat as grief came up and I allowed the tears to flow like a river. <br /><br /><br />My words cannot come close to the depths of my gratitude for what you have given to me and all the amazing people in your Yoga community. <br /><br /><br />You are a beautiful human being inside and out.<br /><br /><br />If you are willing I would like you to follow me on my Kindness Matters Community on Instagram @thekindnesscoach as I would love the whole of my community to benefit from your life message.<br /><br /><br />If I can ever be of service to you just ask.<br /><br /><br />I will leave you with a gift from me to you one of my own quotes I manifested in meditation.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Make Kindness an Integral part of what you think, say and do. And I assure you of this...It will give you a life filled with inner peace, love, joy and happiness&quot;. -John Magee. Namaste sister.",The Kindness Coach TV,2020-03-27T08:44:07Z,0

This was a bit of a disappointment. I need the audio cues to move on to the next pose. It was very frustrating to constantly have to contort to see the TV. No eyes closed. Breathing was totally not happening. A really disappointing way to end this series that I was enjoying so much. And today was finally a nice long 40 min session. I lasted 15 minutes unfortunately. Had to turn it off. It&#39;s a shame.,Katherine Hul,2020-03-27T00:08:23Z,0

"Took me nearly three months to get to the end, but I made it! It truly is about the journey. Silent flow for 40 min was really challenging when all the videos were 20ish minutes.

I&#39;ve managed to make it my own, finally finding what feels good. Thank you so much Adriene for all your love and support &lt;3",Marjolijn Vonhof,2020-03-26T16:24:41Z,2
"Wow thank you so much for this beautiful 30 day journey. I still can’t believe I did it! I’ve been meaning to start yoga for such a long time and one night at 9pm I was like: let’s do this, I clicked on day 1 and I almost left 30 seconds after but I didn’t and I’m so glad I stayed! Your smile and energy carried me through those 30 days. I’ll sure be back tomorrow thanks ❤️",Kelly Ann Bernier,2020-03-26T16:07:10Z,0
I love this one so much.  Finished home with this but today came back and just did 20 minutes of my own yoga with the music (and occasional peaks at the video for inspiration one moves) and it was wonderful.   <br /><br />Are there more similar videos with no mic of various lengths?    I’ll likely just keep coming home to this one but if there’s more similar to this yummy video I’m curious :)<br /><br />Thank you thank you!,Chelsea McGuire,2020-03-26T15:24:40Z,0

"I started last year&#39;s 30 day journey but didn&#39;t stick with it, so this year I committed myself to finishing this one no matter how long it took, no matter how many days I missed. I stuck with it daily until I got sick about halfway through. For a few weeks I couldn&#39;t do yoga, and it took me a bit to get back into the daily practice, but I remembered what I had told myself in the beginning and I kept at it. Getting back into it was difficult, because I had lost a lot of the progress I had made, and I was very discouraged. Slowly, I started to see it come back and I realized that I could do this. When you said today that you were taking the microphone off, it terrified me. But I decided to trust in you and myself and it resulted in one of the best practices I&#39;ve ever had- something I didn&#39;t think I was capable of doing for myself. I heard your voice in my head the whole time, reminding me to breathe, to take up space, and to do what feels good. I was surprised at how many times I glanced at the screen and found you in the same position as myself, as well as the amount of times we were doing different things and that I was okay with that. I teared up at the end of this practice today, filled with so many emotions. Thank you, Adriene, for this wonderful gift. I&#39;ve made yoga a daily part of my life now, and I intend to stick with it as long as I am able. Namaste &lt;3",Erin Noelle,2020-03-25T14:08:13Z,1

"Oh man, I was so intimidated when you said &#39;I&#39;ll be turning off the microphone now&#39;. I genuinely thought I&#39;d be completely at a loss of what to do and about ten minutes in would already be in corpse pose, thinking I had reached the 40 minutes already. But once I got going, it was actually surprisingly easy to go from one pose to the next, following the kind of flow you have taught us. I peeked at the screen now and again, I&#39;ll admit it, but got over not being in the same pose as you like nothing. It was okay. This was my own 40 minutes to fill in as I please with all the great tools and poses you&#39;ve taught me over these 30 days. And aside from some minor mishaps in half moon and crow, it went really well and the 40 minutes were over much faster than I anticipated. <br />Thank you so much Adriene! For doing this, for being you and for getting me into a better physical and mental state. And I think I can speak for all of us when I say: We love you too.",Kat S,2020-03-25T09:49:52Z,2

"Wow. This was really powerful for me. I cried at the end and wasn’t expecting that kind of release. Thank you for this. I was partly following along with you, partly making it my own based on what felt right to me. I’m glad that I finally made it through this journey. All I could think of at the end were the words, “I’m free. I’m free. I’m free.” Free to be who I want to be at any time. I don’t have to wait for someone’s permission to do what I know is right for me. I need continued healing but this definitely brought some light into my life, so thank you so much, Adriene!! ❤️❤️",Margaret Long,2020-03-25T04:22:05Z,28

"At first, I was panicked before this session. I believed that I cannot do this without a voice guidance. However, during the session I became more brave and I enjoyed it so much!

A lot of days I wasn&#39;t motivated and I would say I&#39;ll skip today, but I wouldn&#39;t feel right. Eventually, I would pull out my mat and do it and I would be so happy I did.

I always look forward to Adriene&#39;s  30 days of yoga. It&#39;s a good way to get back into a daily yoga routine to keep you going for the rest of the year. This is not one of my favourite days because I know it&#39;s the end of it but also because I keep having to look at the screen to try and figure out what&#39;s next. If you&#39;re like me and  to follow the routine closely I suggest you watch session once through first. I actually didn&#39;t enjoy it until I decided to allow myself to make mistakes. It might be helpful if you could put up some hints on the screen  as the practice progresses.,JoAnne Yeo,2020-03-24T11:15:55Z,1

"The last 30-day yoga ended with the same and this second time is no different for me - I just am not the type to have or create my own routine on the spot :-( So I stopped midway, slightly annoyed, because if no voice is there to guide me, I constatnly peek at the screen and it is distracting. I tried my best but no, 23 minutes in, this is not for me. I will finish up with a short video from Adriene&#39;s list to have a feeling of closure but this did not work for me.<br />WHICH IS NOT TO SAY that I do not appreciate all Adriene&#39;s hard work and her guidance for those 30 days. It took me 40 days, during which I had to say goodbye to my Grandma and to my beloved tom-cat, we laid the foundations of our house and the pandemic broke out... And all this time, this mantra resonates in my mind: You&#39;ve got the tools. So thank you so much for that, Adriene, and I&#39;ll sure keep yoga-ing with you in the future!<br />Regards from the Czech Republic :-*",Klára Míčková,2020-03-23T12:01:43Z,0

"I just want to thank you so much for all that you do Adriene. I have been struggling with my own mental health lately and your yoga videos have really been my saving grace. Over a month ago I found out my partner was suffering from his own demons. We both decided to do this 30 day yoga journey and finished 2 days ago. Between the pandemic concerns and all of the bizarre developments this year has brought it has allowed us to find peace and strengthen ourselves and our own relationship. I have been following you for 4 years now and this is the second 30 days I have completed. We just started dedicate and the mental, physical, and emotional benefits of yoga are so evident. We have two children together and both work as nurses so find it difficult and unaffordable to go to a studio. These videos, your words, and careful guidance are a perfect balance in our busy lives. As natural caregivers we both find it difficult to care for ourselves. Thank you for helping us guide us into a space where we can learn and grow. I have been sharing with others and have had people message me &quot;Adriene has really change my life.&quot; I hope you are able to read this and understand how much you do for people just by sharing your love and gentle spirit with others.

Really thank you from all of my heart you cannot believe what this journey meant to me. I feel this was the start of something big. Thank you Adriene that you dedicated yourself to this beautiful practice of helping people around the world to come back home to themselves, do something loving for themselves and show them how capable and strong they are and that it is worth it to not give up but believe in oneself and our goals and dreams.

I knew I was on the right track and you&#39;ve taught me well. My husband says,  you have so much grace in your movements, where I used to be so imbalanced and clumsy.

"thank you adrienne for this amazing yoga journey that you took us on. As i lied there in shavasana trying to clear my mind and have a moment of stillness, i realized that (of course) not all my problems are suddenly solved. i still can&#39;t concentrate that well, i fall over in half moon and i am impatient and on edge pretty much all the time. But i also felt an immense, stubborn love for myself, something i never really felt before this deeply. I realized that no matter what, I will continue to love myself whether i love me back or not. I will continue to do yoga even though it takes me great convincing to get on the mat because i know how good i&#39;ll feel afterwards, i will eat healthy food instead of a diet of chips and ice cream because i know that i feel way better and i will be kind to myself and all those around me even tho i want to snap at people and tear myself down. Because I love myself and i love living! From the bottom of my heart, thank you adrienne for being a role model, a wonderful yoga instructor and an inspiration in kindness, patience and love. ♥",lili,2020-03-21T11:08:14Z,0

With all my sincerity I thankyou for this wonderful heart touching journey into yoga ..it was definitely an inspiring series of sessions ..brought me so much peace everyday..and a special thanks to Benji..just his presence was so joyful and I have to mention that more than me my dog Snow was so curious about Benji and never missed a session just to watch Benji come on screen and go ..<br />And today especially was the best ..made me emotional at the end of it ..yes !! &quot;Then the delight ..when your courage kindled..and out you stepped onto new ground&quot;..how true and inspiring..loved every bit of HOME ..not to forget the theme music ..aaah !!

"Wow, it was like I lived, breathed, and saw this montage of my YWA journey to get to this day. I took it at my own pace, and somehow I found myself syncing up with Adrienne at times. <br />What I&#39;ve rekindled is the playful essence of my spirit and my hands and feet&#39;s spirit too! I was playing in boat pose and started flicking my feet in point and flex. Imagining little splashes of water. I&#39;ve held a grudge again my feet for so long because they pronante in the wrong way and have large bunions. I&#39;ve seen them as this stand still obstacle in my movement practices. I never truly feel grounded my feet. The part of me the literally supports my whole body to connect with the earth, I&#39;ve shunned as a part of me.<br /><br />With these magical splashes, I forgive you my feet. You deserve much more love and support from me. <br /><br />Thank you for guiding to awaken the imaginative playful essence again. ❤ ^U^",Tory Pisarek,2020-03-18T15:10:27Z,0

"One year ago I finished True and the last day was the most frustrating experience for me because I didn&#39;t have any guidance and every minute I felt panicky trying to catch on what you were doing but today after a year of doing yoga (with breaks, I confess) this last day was really inspiring for me. I let myself do all of my favorite poses and enjoy them without looking at the screen all the time. I even let myself cry a little a bit when the music ended because I felt so proud of myself that I could do it. You taught me so much. Thank you!",natalia rubleva,2020-03-18T04:53:19Z,0
"Finally finished the 30-day journey! The end of the journey is always my favorite and I&#39;ve been doing yoga with you for almost 5 years! Last time I cried while doing my day 30 video where I took control of everything because I was in a darker place back then. BUt now that everything is much, muc hbetter, I find myself choreographing a sweaty 40-minute routine that feels light but at the end of it I sweated as if I was doing cardio! <br /><br /><br />The magic mantra is &quot;find whaat feels good&quot;. Who knew that today, my body is moving on their own accord because what feels good is sweating! I also find myself doing hard poses that I thought I couldn&#39;t do like crown and half moon, and it felt like flying! Magic!<br /><br /><br />Thank you so much Adriene for this practice and this journey and for those who are also practicing with the same frequency. I hope everything in the world will be better soon.

"I discovered YWA in 2017 while going through a divorce and recovering from addiction and Adriene&#39;s gentle, empowering presence helped me find my light again. I did yoga almost every day until getting pregnant last year (with my current wonderful partner), and doing this 30 day challenge has been my reintroduction to my self and my body since our son was born in December. I didn&#39;t start until February, had to skip a day or two in between, and had to pause many of these practices multiple times to get up and soothe a newborn, but I always got back to it and feel SO good seeing the positive changes to my body/mind/spirit. Jon O&#39;Donohue is one of my favorite authors and the ending quote hit me directly in the feels!

"Well first of all let me say I really enjoyed the first 29 days but that (the 30th day) was just annoying, a guided yoga routine without an audio guide.yeah I know the positions and moves but it’s still a routine and without audio guidance you continually have to check the video which is not at all good for some of the poses or your neck and you can’t even relaxingly close your eyes during parts of the practice because you have no idea if we’ve moved on to the next pose. In some ways seemed like more of a personal performance piece. Thanks for the first 29 days, really started each day off nicely :)",Tortoise Hare,2020-03-17T01:19:40Z,0

"This was such a beautiful and emotional practice. I loved the part where Benji came in with his downward dog and you both looked at one another. It was such a loving and tender moment and with the music playing in the background, it put the biggest smile on my face. I loved this practice but it made me realise that I&#39;m so used to you guiding me through it, so at one point I almost gave up... but I didn&#39;t! I soldiered on and by the end I felt so relaxed and calm. I have really enjoyed waking up and not knowing what practice I&#39;m going to do.

That I knew to whisper to myself, &quot;Stay focused... it&#39;s all good... you got this...&quot; when I lost my balance or fell behind.

This is a waste of time for me. I get the point &amp; in theory it sounds beautiful &amp; freeing &amp; all that stuff to “trust yourself” &amp; go without cues. But in practice it’s just me being annoyed &amp; not able to predict what she’s going to do next so I have to watch the screen in a way I didn’t with any other day. I don’t have time to waste 40 minutes without feeling like I got a workout. I also just feel stupid the entire time. Maybe I’m not as enlightened as everyone else here. But I did 30 days of this only to feel stupid for 40 minutes.,Milk Sweet,2020-03-11T15:26:47Z,0
"I was proud that I made it 30 days straight through, but the pinnacle was a let down. I say this because I was straining to look at the screen to know when to go to the next pose. I had to quit because my neck is hurting. Some sort of sound cue is really important as you shouldn’t turn your neck in some of those poses. I’ve been really appreciative of this practice, and would like to do more. Adriene, I’m just wondering if this is the standard for ending each series? It’s going to be hard for me if so. Maybe there’s a balance between the music, the opportunity to create a personal practice and use the language and sound guidance? Maybe if you named the next pose and let folks move into it on their own? I’m asking because it would be more healthful for me, and I’d like to complete each series. Thanks for listening to those of us that need some sound cues, and thank you for taking the time to offer this great resource. It is much appreciated. Love and light!",mtnmuseful,2020-03-11T15:16:54Z,0
THANKYOU ADRIENE!! This is my first time completing the entire 30 day challenge and it was an AMAZING journey. I really appreciate what you give and I hope you are receiving so much love from us in spirit!

"for some reason i started doing the 30 day challenge from 2015. I guess it started out as another way to get strong and relieve back pain. Turned out to be doing even more for mental health! I carry a nugget of calm with me all the time, and its lovely. After my first 30 (from 2015) i immedtiately started this one.<br />Today marks my 60th consecutive day.<br />I feel happy!",arvidedor,2020-03-10T20:49:31Z,0
"I just finished Day 30 today! I think it might be my favorite day of the journey Home.

It also made me realise how much I&#39;ve learned these past couple of months. Thank you for this journey, Adriene!",SameAsMe,2020-03-10T18:36:11Z,0
"I gotta be honest- I&#39;ve done Adriene&#39;s yoga journeys for a few years now, and I came to fear/hate/avoid day 30- I even skipped it last year. It made me feel lost not to have a voice guiding me. I went into this practice feeling the same kind of emotions and almost delayed it to get on with my busy day, but I managed to press play (the hardest part, right?). I followed Adriene for the most part, got in to my own groove a bit, and was shocked when I realized that 40min had flew by! I felt calm for most of the practice, but when I saw Adriene closing the practice, I got so emotional. Tears came to my eyes. This year&#39;s journey went so well for me- I&#39;m proud to say that I only missed one day in the whole 30 days! (I was traveling in Jan, so I started on my own in Feb.) After so many years, a daily practice is starting to seem really within reach. So many people say it, but it&#39;s true- this yoga has changed my life. Thank you, Adriene, for all that you do. I am deeply and eternally grateful for your gift!",Seekay Hui,2020-03-10T17:43:10Z,0
"Thank you Adriene. I have been following your videos for more than 2 years now. Every time I have followed your flow, I have felt good. Finally after completing this 30 day flow, I feel like I have grown emotionally and physically, I have a long way to go but, these 30 days have taught me to appreciate the journey and to live mindfully. I can never Thank you enough for teaching me how to Live with meaning. Lots and lots of love and positivity to you❤",Anya Mandal,2020-03-10T16:52:35Z,0
"This is the third year that I’ve followed Adriene’s 30-day yoga journey, and THE FIRST TIME I’ve managed to complete the 40 minutes without hesitation, knowing what to do next. The first year, I just sort of hobbled around wondering what to do, taking cues from Adriene but feeling as though I was cheating. Last year (Year 2), I managed about half the time before following along because I’d run out of ideas. This year, at last, I felt quite a natural flow from one sequence of movements to the next. I have never tried practicing yoga on my own, so this was a really significant step for me. I really enjoyed the time to feel my way into each posture, making it work for me. And I finally realized what I’m doing wrong when moving from chaturanga to upward dog! Thank you so much, Adriene, for (a) rekindling my interest in yoga later in life and (b) giving me, as you say, the vocabulary to express myself freely. 🥰 It&#39;s amazing, like the first time my dad let go of the bike and I found myself cycling upright without support.",Alison Wonderland,2020-03-10T14:36:29Z,0

"i felt like i didnt try hard enough or push myself enough this practise, but then i realised that i am already enough. even by showing up and starting i have done enough. ive been really sick with a cold and i had to miss a day or two and instead try more gentle healing poses, and im not fully recovered,, but even then i dont need to push myself or be unkind. my journey might take longer but it wont be helped by unkindness coming from me,, thank you for helping me to find what feels good for myself 💖✨",Summer Sundays,2020-03-09T10:49:23Z,0

"This was difficult for me without hearing your voice with instruction as was the last 29days.  I am happy to have gone this far, but unfortunately, I  feel defeated this 30th day, unable to flow without instruction or looking at the screen. Then I was lying on the floor doing a side twist when my dog accidentally knocked a picture that was leaning against the wall,( not hung up yet)and it smacked me right in the face on my upper lip! What could that mean in the cosmic world? Sort of upsetting!

"This brought up so much emotion from me that I totally didn&#39;t expect.  I have done my own yoga flows in the past but I realized through this freedom and trust you invited us to participate in how much I have been relying on the guidance of others as of late.  I teach and preach inner authority, alignment, personal power and yet, I&#39;ve been abandoning my own while I shift into new and uncharted waters.  I felt so much fear come up as the practice began and sat with it all.  I used the opportunity throughout class to remember that I have the wisdom, I don&#39;t need to go fast or do it right or perform for anyone.  That the way I move is perfect and right for me and that&#39;s all I need to remember and come back to.  This was so profound and so perfectly timed.

"This 30 day journey, was 60 day journey to me. But hey! Yoga every other day is better than no yoga at all! First time I&#39;ve completed your 30 day challenges and it felt so good :)",DaniCrayons,2020-03-01T21:43:45Z,0
Today I completed my second 30 day YWA series! I’m beyond proud of myself for coming to the mat every day! I am finding more and more confidence in myself and the power I have inside. I can’t express the gratitude I have for being able to find what feels good and not feeling guilty for not looking exactly like everyone else in any particular pose. I’ve never been as self assured as I am now after this beautiful journey of self discovery back home! <br />Namaste friends!,Ashley Benoit,2020-03-01T21:19:06Z,0

"This playlist was my first exposure to yoga. I was curious about it, so I thought why not give it a try for February. I’m blown away by how much my flexibility, balance, mindfulness, and overall stillness improved over this month. Although sometimes I felt like you talked a little too long in some of those uncomfortable positions for me, I do appreciate it because it allowed me to work on my patience and remain in the moment. I honestly still can’t believe I’ve been practicing yoga for 30 days. I am incredibly grateful for this journey. Thank you, Adriene!  Namaskar!",Orange Waves,2020-03-01T19:48:59Z,0

I&#39;ve always been really intrested in yogic practices and everything related to this. But i have to say that you are my first teacher from whom i actually learned yoga...  And no matter how many teachers i would find in this field, you will always be the best for me, you will always be special,  and i really love you Adriene.  Thank you, thank you for  being  a person who changed my life, rather i would say you turned it upside down, and I&#39;m really glad about it.. I&#39;m  happiest about the decision  of  starting  yoga. And i definitely owe you my yogic experience... Thankyou.... Sending lots of  honour and blessing and Love from My Home to Yours.! ♥️♥️♥️🙏Namastey",Anzu Swami,2020-02-29T07:53:09Z,0
"Thank you so much Adriene for this 30 day challenge. I just finished today. I am almost 77 years old, so it definitely was a challenge. I did the best I could and was rather proud of doing all I did. I guess yoga is supposed to flow, and while this body does not really flow so well, I got there when I could and met you at downward facing dog. Looking forward to the March calendar.",Helene Goodman,2020-02-28T16:37:17Z,0

"Thank you so much Adrien!! ❤️This was my first 30 day YWA challenge I completed and I’m totally hooked now. At first when you said at the beginning of this class you were taking the mic off I was like, “say WHAT?!”, but now upon finishing I totally get it. This class seamlessly blended together all the beauty that was built upon in the previous classes, while giving permission to follow what feels good. I also felt like it was a special sneak peek into your own personal yoga practice when you’re not spending your energy focused on instruction, which was quite a treat. Again, thank you so much!! 🙏 I have been practicing yoga for years but have not had a daily practice consistently. Your classes make daily practice so much more of a possibility. Already planning to go back through your previous 30 day challenges next! Love &amp; hugs from atx! ❤️🤗✨",minpaldy,2020-02-28T14:37:16Z,0

And at one point, I looked at the screen and I was in Mountain Pose just as Adriene was! Then we both floated down together.<br />Thank you Adriene for helping us realize our own power and potential.

"I can’t even begin to describe how this challenge changed me, when I started I honestly thought there’s no way I can do this, I’m just a beginner! And since I tend to give up on everything halfway I expected the same for this, but I really pushed myself to show up everyday no matter how tired I was, no matter what plans I had that day and I slowly began to enjoy yoga and look forward to it. My energy level changed my sleeping got better and overall I feel amazing. I’m truly grateful for these videos and this challenge, it’s the reason I started doing yoga and the reason I’ll continue to do it, thank you so much ❤️",Mai Roberts,2020-02-25T18:09:40Z,0
"Dear Adriene,<br /><br />I&#39;ve been going through a rough patch and this yoga journey has been the only thing I&#39;ve been able to stick to daily for the last 30 days. Actually, most days, it&#39;s been the only thing I was genuinely looking forward to. It kept me going, time and again. In your own words, my yoga mat literally and figuratively got my back. Today, I sat down on my mat at the golden hour. At first the prospect of going through this session without your vocal guidance distressed me; I thought I&#39;d only get stuck in my head, afraid of missing a &quot;cue&quot;, of not knowing when or how to move. But only a few minutes into it, it dawned on me that that&#39;s not the point; yoga is not a choreography, it&#39;s a language. A therapeutic language. I never trusted my body as much as I did during this final practise, however clumsy the outcome. I actually, genuinely listened—to my breath, to my body, to my needs. I&#39;m not talking about a hyperfocus kind of mode; it rather felt like I was letting go of something, in the subtlest ways. I melted into the moment, into the environnement and sounds and light around me, into my body. At the end, I lied down with my left hand on my heart, the right one on my stomach—the two areas that I probably tend to mistreat the most. It took me a minute to notice the tears after I felt the steady, loyal beating of my heart and the warmth of my abdomen. After this 30-day journey, life is still what it is, sure. I wasn&#39;t expecting a miracle. But something has changed withing me. I finally want to take care of myself. And from here on out, yoga is going to be a central point in this process. It&#39;s only the beginning. So much love x",machaon,2020-02-25T17:53:25Z,0
"Did anyone else get so emotional at the end of the video? I literally cried! Thank u so much Adriene! You&#39;re such an inspiration to all! When I started Yoga, I&#39;m slowly learning to appreciate myself more and also to value, love myself (which I haven&#39;t done in ages) &amp; just appreciate life in general.  Thank you Adriene! Will continue to Find what feels good 😊😊😊",R C,2020-02-25T17:20:11Z,0
This was awesome! Lovely way to finish the 30 days challenge although if I had one criticism I would have is that it would be really helpful if you were to put a bell or sound at each switch of pose.. was lovely to do it on our own but was distracting for the longer holds of poses when having to keep an eye on your movements. If there was a sound when poses changed would only have to look up at that.<br />I have thoroughly enjoyed the 30 days and will be starting another one of your 30 day challenges tomorrow.. thank you for your guidance you have no idea how much it helps my mental and physical health.. blessed be xxx,claire robinson,2020-02-25T14:49:21Z,0

"I started in real time, but January was NOT a good month for me. I kinda put this to the side a little over a week in (just doing a video here and there when I could) and didn&#39;t start back up until this month. But I finished and I am so glad that I did! This makes 2 years I&#39;ve been consistently doing yoga with you Adriene, and honestly this was by far the best practice I&#39;ve ever had. I had never felt more in tune and in control of myself than within these 40 minutes. Thank you for all that you do and all the hard work you put into these. These 30 day series at the start of every year help serve as a valuable check in time for me to see where I&#39;m at and how far I&#39;ve come. You&#39;re amazing. Seriously, thank you for all that you do. Namaste friend!",Zakerdoodle,2020-02-24T15:16:58Z,0
"Finished today with about 8 days of breaks (showing up sometimes is difficult). I&#39;m not going to lie. I was a little scared and worried about doing yoga without you telling me what to do (I think it may be somewhat easier to do it that way), but once I started doing it, I couldn&#39;t believe that I did yoga by myself for 35 minutes!!! You&#39;ve taught me the vocabulary as well as the moves and allowed me to create my own freestyle yoga practice! I think the main thing that I learned was just to take time for yourself and to love yourself (whatever that may be). It was great! Using you as a guide to remind myself of the moves, I was able to do my favourite poses and hit spots that were &quot;yummy&quot; and helped me feel better. Thank you for this journey! I&#39;m going to continue with the next calendar. Namaste!",Raymond Ang,2020-02-24T12:31:35Z,0

I love doing my own thing with my own timing during practice, but I also like following along and knowing where we’re at. I couldn’t be in it cause I was constantly cranking my neck to look at the screen, which I rarely do normally. So maybe minimal voice cues next year?

"I started today&#39;s practice feeling discouraged. &quot;I have to do this for 40 minutes without any guidance at all??&quot;. But as I started the sense of time has disappeared for me and the only thing present was the sound of my breath. It was the most satisfying time I had in a very long time, because usually I struggle with anxiety and unwanted negative chatter inside of my head, and for those 40 minutes it was finally gone. I was smiling the whole time with the overwhelming calmness running through my body and mind! Thank you so much Adriene!",Keiii0 0,2020-02-23T14:48:06Z,0
Wow! I started this year with the intention of taking better care of myself. I started HOME later and got hooked. I now practice almost everyday with or without a video.

"Although I absolutely love all of Adriene&#39;s workouts (she&#39;s my official &quot;yoga instructor&quot;; this video didn&#39;t work out very well for me (or the other 131 people who gave it a thumbs down).  Adriene, in my opinion, is a pioneer.  She gently guides and instructors her students as she takes us through the various poses.  I can&#39;t take a fast passed yoga class and her videos are perfect for me.  It&#39;s impossible to watch an instructor AND get into these poses at the same time.  Especially figuring out what the next pose will be while in downward dog with my head upside down at that time.  Having to keep my eyes peeled on my laptop screen without simply following the guided instructions of her voice, made it impossible for me to benefit from this video in an easy &quot;flow&quot; manner.  I&#39;m not alone in that opinion so, hopefully, none of Adriene&#39;s other classes are silent as this one was (I&#39;ve taken over 50 of her videos and a few are my favorites which I do all the time!).  Hands down, she&#39;s the best in the biz!",Shane Alexander,2020-02-22T18:14:03Z,0

"I was really worried about this one at first and was kind of upset that I had to do it all &quot;myself&quot;. But I showed up! It was short, it was very imperfect, probably a bit sloppy too, but it felt good and I did it listening to me and to my body. Thank you for this journey, Adriene! Looking forward to many more.",mollaboutthat,2020-02-22T17:09:47Z,0

"This video made me realize how much I need the audible cues and guidance in order to push myself. I simply could not close my eyes and focus fully on my breathing the same way I can when Adriene tells me what to do, so this was the first practice where I hardly ever closed my eyes. But, because I did watch everything and did every pose the same, I had one hell of a workout with sweat dripping, and I did feel really accomplished anyway 😍 Namasté",Maria Oseberg Hansen,2020-02-22T14:51:31Z,0

"I started this journey January 10. I was sick with the flu from January 1 to 6 (a great start to 2020). Having more PTSD symptoms than usual, and recovering from the holidays that had their own triggers, made January a very difficult month for me. Body memories from January 2019 were being triggered and I wasn&#39;t used to having recent things to process (most of my trauma is from 5-7 years ago). <br />I still made it onto the mat, even if I had to skip 5 days during a bad week or ended up crying halfway through a video. I still made it through this whole video able to do each sequence, even if I misstepped or had to look at the video a lot. <br />I&#39;m so proud of myself and thankful for this exercise keeping me grounded during a significant and challenging point in my life. Thank you Adriene.",Megan Rigsby,2020-02-21T20:50:55Z,0
"From the bottom of my heart - Thank you! I can&#39;t even express how much your love and guidance helped me. Last year was filled with depression and self doubt for me. I couldn&#39;t see a way out for quite a long time. But somehow the daily videos in my subscriptions tickled something inside me and made me start my journey home in the end of January. I&#39;ve started the 30 day challenges quite a few times but never made it really far. This time around I told myself that I wouldn&#39;t give up on it even if I miss a day. So... here we are I got on my mat for (almost) 30 days straight and I couldn&#39;t have done anything better for myself. I too cried tears of happiness - quite unexpectedly in forward fold (the feeling of tears streaming up your forehead towards your hairline is quite something :)) In the beginning I thought that I will run out of poses before the video is over, but I even ended up rewinding it a few minutes because the time just flew by so quickly. Thank you for being you and always having my back! &lt;3 Namaste",steph g,2020-02-21T19:52:51Z,0

"Love you...loved the series, first 30-day challenge for me and the wife...one suggestion for us nOObs, you should do a voice-over at the beginning of each pose, softly stating the pose name...we found ourselves having to strain our necks to see where you were at. I know we were expected to do our own thang but let&#39;s face it we all follow your direction. Read a few comments and so I came back to add this...I agree this was emotional but I feel that if I was not straining to see what to do next sort of thing, I would have lost my shit and cried like a baby lol :-)",Pierre Racette,2020-02-21T10:12:04Z,0

Baby is happy.<br />I remember last year not having the courage to move freely, but glanced at the screen every other second to see what Adriene was doing. But not this year! This year I only looked to see if she had any good tips for what to do next, and always found something I knew I wanted to do in a short while. It was freeing, it was opening, it was amazing. Thank you, Adriene. Somehow you made me braver (I thought only my spouse could do that).

I&#39;ve ordered books recently and want to start my own practice, but you have taught me the basics and i appreciate what you do immensely. However, the last day of both 30 days I&#39;ve done, it&#39;s just painful trying to follow you without audio cues. It completely takes me out of the practice.

This has been a really wonderful journey and I’m excited to keep doing yoga every day. When you said come to this with an open mind I really didn’t know what to expect and was surprised that it was silent! I was kind of uncomfortable at first until I realized this is my opportunity to really find what feels good.

"Thank you so much, I am so greatful. I struggled with eating disorders, and body dysmorphia my whole life and also survived sexual assults. I was married for 14 years, and I wouldnt let my partner touch me or see me naked, the entire time. I was so ashamed of my body. However, Ive already fully recovered from my eating disorders, after 25 years, at worst I almost died after starving myself to 93 lbs, another time I weighed 260 lbs. Now IDK, or care I am healthy; that&#39;s what matters. I also have 13 broken bones and metal rods, plates and screws holding them together. I never thought I could do yoga. This was such a beautiful practice, and experience, I cried a lot. Adriane was so kind and gentle, I appreciated it. Today I completed my 30th day. This is one of my proudest moments. Thank you.

"Hello, Adriene!<br />I started this journey a little late and with a lot of unhappiness in my heart. While I can&#39;t say that yoga helped against that, I certainly feel like even the motivation to wake up early every day and do it was a clear boost for my spirit and morale. I was so very surprised when I saw some signs of muscles on my arms, as well as when I realized that I gained some more length in my very inflexible legs! Today was my biggest surprise by far during this journey and it happened when the usual outro music softly started playing. With my hands in front of my heart, I just started crying and even as I write this I have tears falling down my cheek. They&#39;re not tears of sadness, nor happiness, but something else. It feels as if I&#39;ve been watching a piece of art or something highly inspirational.<br /><br />But I am babbling now! I want to thank you for being you, Adriene and for everything you do for us. I hope you&#39;ll remain this bright being which you are or grow into an even brighter and warmer one. You are wonderful and I wish the best to Benji and you! I will try to go through the other 30 days challenges and see where I&#39;ll end up. :)<br />Namaste.",A. Iosif,2020-02-18T06:57:13Z,0

"A month ago, I began a new chapter of my life, I moved from Sweden to Australia, to be an au pair for 6 months. <br />This is what I wrote in my journal after today’s practise:<br />“I was just at the end of the practice, thumbs at my third eye and crying from being humbled and so, so grateful for all my yoga pals around the world and Adriene, when C and A walked in. D had another bad evening and L needed me to watch them. Sometimes, things just don’t go according to plan, or the plan changes abruptly, and that’s a beautiful part of the journey too. Today, I’ve had to try to let go of the need to know and plan what comes next. In this, during practice when my mind wanted to continuously plan the next pose, and when I looked into the travels I want to do after I’ve finished au pairing. /../ Can I bring back my intention with this trip, to go with the flow and not plan too much ahead? I want to take one thing at a time and see where it leads me. I’m on a journey. ‘Don’t decide where it ends’...”<br /><br />I’m so grateful for this journey, this practice, for lovingly having my back through this first month of a new adventure. When the change and newness has been too much, it has been my comfort. It has helped me reflect and grow, feel my feelings, and has grounded me. It has helped me slow down and take notice, when things have moved too quickly. It supported the transition of moving across the world, and Adriene, I cannot thank you enough for that. HOME created a home within myself when I left everything and everyone that has ever been home to me far away, and now that safety will forever be there. I am so loved, by other people but also by myself on a new level. It’s intrinsic, unconditional, and will follow wherever I go next. That inner support makes me brave.

I feel like it&#39;s so much easier to breath and flow through the poses and in life. So very grateful. I have shared this with a few friends and will continue to share. Home practice is very important!! Thank mew thank mew thank mew!!",Queen of Love and Hope,2020-02-17T04:03:41Z,0
I am so proud after catching the flu I started the home journey 30 days ago still not feeling well but kept at it. Today session scared me when you removed your microphone but went with it (although I pretty much follow you the whole way) and it ended up being one of my favorite practice.

"I did it. Every single day. Thank you, Adriene, for guiding me through this. I have not only discovered, to my utter astonishment, that my body, though diseased, is so much stronger and more capable than I thought it was, I have discovered more of myself. I keep thinking &quot;take up space&quot;, when so often in my life I have remained silent and tried to take up as little space as possible. My voice matters and I am allowed to take up space, to be strong. Thank you for helping me on my healing journey. I am so utterly grateful to have gone through this with you, and with everyone else on this journey! I will be continuing! &lt;3 <br />Namaste, from Utah.",Fyre Heart Studios,2020-02-17T02:41:55Z,0

"So I finally made it home (16th Feb and during the rages of Storm Dennis) and I don&#39;t know how to thank you enough Adriene (and Benji - so cute when he showed you his down-facing dog and gave you a big sloppy kiss!). <br /><br /><br /><br />It was strange not to hear your comforting and encouraging words but I found myself following your moves on screen and was pretty much second-guessing correctly the next move. <br /><br /><br /><br />You are a wonderful teacher Adriene, and have taken me from the sofa to (almost) daily practice in the space of about 8 weeks (I started my journey just before Christmas). In that time I&#39;ve learnt how to breath properly again, rediscovered stretches and moves I don&#39;t think my body has known since I was a toddler, gained some new strength and balance, and feel a new sense of purpose and well-being. I even find myself having a secret little stretch when I&#39;m doing something mundane like washing the dishes or brushing my teeth!<br /><br /><br />I only wish I&#39;d discovered this magic 30 or 40 years ago, but I&#39;ve discovered that you are never too old to start learning yoga.<br /><br /><br />Thank you for everything and love to all who follow your channel too - nameste",Bob Donaldson,2020-02-16T22:03:55Z,0

I’ve done your other 30 days classes before but always skipped or gave up mid way through the last self guided session. I’m feeling so emotional that I finally trusted myself and your message that we have all the skills we need really inspired me to just close my eyes, let go and flow with the music rather than worrying that I’m doing it right or lost track of what you are doing...so THANKS ADRIENE❤️",Lonley Pxnda,2020-02-16T18:26:58Z,0

"I really don&#39;t understand this day 30 tradition. I have to keep looking at the screen, it disrupts the flow. Wouldn&#39;t it be more practical to blacken the screen and just have the voice? How are even seasoned yogis meant to follow along? I mean... we click on a yoga video instead of just firing up a playlist on spotify because we need the timing for move switches or because we don&#39;t have a flow in mind. I just don&#39;t understand day 30.",demonella,2020-02-15T00:03:22Z,0

"Once I realized I wasn’t going to be able to end on 1/31, I almost stopped.  I have a tendency to let go of things if I can’t do them “the right way.” Workout programs go unfinished, I stop using apps because I’ve lost my “streak,” I let my diet collapse on itself because I went way over my calorie goal a few nights in a row and feel ashamed.<br /><br />But when I started HOME, I said that I would not judge the process. That I wouldn’t say or think anything negative about my body for not being able to hold a pose or for having random pains on occasion.  And I wouldn’t beat myself up for anything that came up during the 30 days. So I figured out how to keep going.<br /><br />And I finally finished Day 30 on Valentines Day, of all days!  To me, that feels perfect.  This practice felt like what I needed; I wasn’t expecting to get very far without you telling me where to go next, but I stayed “self-guided” for most of the practice.  So glad I didn’t give up on this.  I finished when I was supposed to finish.",Eboné Ingram,2020-02-14T12:05:20Z,99

"Well, I made it to day 30 (albeit a little late). And I am surprised how I enjoyed today&#39;s practice. Last time I did a 30-day challenge I skipped the last day because I can&#39;t manage without structure. Today, I used Adriene as a cue for when to move from seated to tabletop, then to standing, seated and finally lying down. But apart from that I mostly did my own thing and the 40 minutes shockingly flew by! I am amazed by my gains in strength, flexibility and posture. I sit and stand up straighter, I feel stronger and I even made it into a few postures I could barely do before. Thank you Adriene for this journey.",Alexandra Panico,2020-02-14T08:13:21Z,0

Today was my final day and I can&#39;t even begin to express how life changing this journey with you has been. There were days when I thought I wouldnt be able to come to the mat (even had to improvise my mat while travelling) but I was able to push through and show up every day of the 30 days and I feel so proud. After every session I would read the Bible and write a journal entry and it has been such a healing and beautiful process. Thank for your generosity and love. I hope you realise just how much you give to this community and know it is much appreciated. <br />PS: I still hate boat poses but.....I got this 😂,Zozo3able,2020-02-13T17:52:49Z,0
"Hey Adriene, I just want to thank you for being the perfect humble guide on this journey for me. I&#39;ve been into yoga for years but have never stuck with it for more than a couple days at a time. To stick to anything for 30 days in a row is a big achievement for me, and now I see no signs of stopping. I think I&#39;ve fallen off the wagon so many times cause I always feel I&#39;ll never improve or become ultra flexible, but you showed me that it really is a journey where it&#39;s A-OK to be imperfect.

"Thank you Adriene for this, I do these journeys with you every year and love them and am so grateful for them and all your hard work! <br />However I must honestly admit that I really dislike this tradition on day 30 to take off your microphone. Like someone else also mentioned in the comments, it’s frustrating and very difficult to follow along without audio cues because I’m forced to look at the screen and crunch my neck all the time making me feel rather uncomfortable. I’m a yoga teacher myself (which you have inspired me to become!) so there’s really not a problem with me not being able to listen to my own voice, I can easily do my own flow and listen to my body etc but the reason that I do yoga with someone else is because I’d like to follow along with their flow, and that’s incredibly difficult to do without audio cues. If I’m in childs pose for example, how do I know when to come out? If I come out whenever it feels right to me, I might miss out on a whole sequence and see that you’re suddenly in a completely different pose that might need another pose to come into it, and so delaying me even further, in which case I’ll get so much more out of it by practicing on my own. For this reason I enjoy just watching your day 30’s each year to avoid myself frustration. I love the sequences every year and at least it serves me as a kind of meditation. I just wanted to share my personal experience with you and I hope you’ll appreciate my honesty! I love your channel and have been following since your early days. Keep up the great work! You’re a huge inspiration!",Consciously Pure,2020-02-13T09:49:49Z,0

I’m taking that student’s comment as a compliment for those reasons - I hope I’m bringing yoga with me off the mat in more ways than one.

I&#39;ve been interning at a hospital the past 5 weeks, which caused me to take longer in finishing HOME on time, but I made sure to get some type of yoga in every day regardless. This practice has helped me cope with so many stresses. Finally making it to Journey is really powerful; being someone who struggles with commitment, making it to day 30 a really special moment.

I loved this journey! I&#39;m growing so much in my yoga practice. I would love to see 30 day or maybe 10 day practices all about poses. Like 10 days to get yourself into a great crow pose or difficult binds or harder positions like headstands and such that we don&#39;t usually do in the normal flow. Looking to expand my practice into these sorts of things. Would love to see more focused segments! Thank you for sharing your yoga with us!,Abby Bengtzen,2020-02-12T16:54:23Z,0

"I have not done any Yoga for the past few days as Cyclone Damien had a direct hit at Karratha in Western Australia at approx 3.30pm on Saturday, 8th February 2020.  We had to evaculate our caravan park, our caravan in a warehouse and us staying at friends place.  4 days later I am back home in my caravan.  I am sitting outside on the last day of this 30 day journey about to complete this Home journey.  Always do my Yoga outside, but this time its different all around is destruction of our trees, buildings, etc and the two trees nearby has broken branches. But I am about to witness a beautiful sunset amd listening to the birds as I do this 40 min practice.  So there is hope again.  Thank you for letting me share this.  I have enjoyed this Home Yoga series very much.<br />Just completed my 40min Yoga under the sunset and watching the darkness and stars to appear.  It was emotional, but I feel renew and hope for me... as well for this town to come together as one and rebuild.  I am glad to be Home again. Thank you",Lee-Ann Stevenson,2020-02-12T11:11:05Z,0

"I thought that doing it alone would decrease my enthusiasm for the practice, or that I would half ass it. I surprised myself by giving myself exactly what I needed today. I&#39;m leaving this practice feeling refreshed and full. <br />I can&#39;t even describe what Adriene has given me throughout the years I&#39;ve been following her videos. I feel like a new person. I&#39;m so grateful for this community, and grateful that this practice has given me my body back. I love you all.",Mady McColm,2020-02-12T03:56:36Z,0
I know I&#39;m just a small little fish in a vast sea ...however I just wanted to tell you that I came here for the inner peace more than to be healthy and you gave me both.

"I made it! I don&#39;t quite know how it&#39;s been 30 days already but apparently it has! Thank you so much Adriene. I know a lot of people have left comments here before me saying very similar sentiments, but honestly from the bottom of my heart thank you! Even after these 30 days I have noticed so many changes happening in my life from incorporating this daily practise. I don&#39;t know why but when you brought us down on to the floor and I hugged my knees into my chest I just started crying. I don&#39;t know where the tears came from or why, but I just felt something give way. You&#39;ve given me so much through this series and honestly I&#39;m ready for the next one! My biggest heartfelt gratitude to you and Benji for sharing your time, love, and beautiful energy with us. Namaste &lt;3 xxxx",evilnoodle101,2020-02-11T22:35:22Z,0
"I love your channel, and have enjoyed every video (I usually spend 2+ hours a day doing yoga from your channel) up to this point, but I found it frustrating to be left to my own devices on the last day. While I know most of the moves already, it&#39;s hard to know when you&#39;re switching, so I end up looking up at the screen almost constantly to make sure I&#39;m not missing poses (which I did, and the other ones were compromised by my looking up at the screen.) This made it impossible for me to continue keeping focus on my breath/core. The fact this happened to be the longest video of the series just made it more frustrating. I stuck through til the end in the hopes I&#39;d still feel good after, but I didn&#39;t. The way I see it is- if I wanted to do yoga without any instructions, I wouldn&#39;t be on Youtube watching beginner videos in the first place. That said, thanks for all you do, and I&#39;m glad that not everyone agrees with me, and that many could get something out of this day. &lt;3",Kay,2020-02-11T20:56:36Z,0
"Finishing my journey home on Feb 11th and I am beyond proud of myself. Although I missed coming to the mat for 11 days in January, I stuck with it and finished in my own perfect time. As a beginner, I have learned so much from day 1. Thank you Adriene for sharing your love and compassion. I hope to take the skills learned here into the rest of the month, year, life, etc. The mantra that came to me on this journey is &quot;this is me&quot;. and I am ready to own being a strong, independent, joyous, and caring being!

"Want to start off by thanking You and the YWA team for such wonderful and loving content.  We all appreciate this so much!<br /><br />A small population of this community requests that there be two versions of this final 30th day.  One version with some verbal/audio cues and the other without.  Sorry to sound ungrateful 😬. My wife and I practice every morning and rarely if ever look at the screen but do actively listen for movement and breathing cues.  We don’t “watch” your videos, we practice them. <br /><br />Muchas Gracias desde San Antonio TX!!!!",Stephen Hernandez,2020-02-11T17:26:33Z,0
"Adriene and YWA team, thank you so incredibly much. I had been doing the HOME series daily until day 20, where I took a bit of a break here and there, until I finished day 30 today. I was so moved at the very end, when the HOME theme song hit. The emotions and tears came out of nowhere. I was legit crying! And that hadn&#39;t yet happened to me in this series, even though reading comments, I see it has happened with others. Reflecting on it though, the release of emotions may be because I am so busy in my life off of the mat, that when I come to the mat to practice with you and this beautiful community we have created, I feel such gratitude and profound peace inside myself. And knowing that this HOME series has wrapped up is like... an acknowledgement that we have done it yet again. I had done Dedicate and True before this, and...the music incorporated in today&#39;s practice was so meaningful- like a nod to series past. I love this channel, this community, and the way yoga (and your presentation of it) has shone a light on the inner teacher and the higher self within me. To the readers of this comment contributing to the light and love on this channel and in your own communities: thank you, thank you, thank you.",Melissa Chanthalangsy,2020-02-11T17:17:59Z,0

"I love your videos and this 30 journey! Sadly I couldn&#39;t connect with this video. Kept having to break the posture to look up at the screen and then find myself anxiously catching up. I have been practising for a while and really tried to trust my instincts but it wasn&#39;t connecting. So I had to stop 20 minutes in , I understood that this practise wasn&#39;t right for me today (and that&#39;s ok) so I&#39;m going to do another instead. I am sad to not &quot;complete&quot; the Home series but just being kind to myself (as it was making me anxious) and changing gears. That&#39;s just my experience.

I sincerely could not believe that I could do this when you introduced our task for the day (no guidance?! ah!). But oh-me-of-little-faith, I just led my own 35-minute practice, feeling incredibly connected with my breath, the present space, etc. I haven&#39;t felt this empowered in such a long time, that tears of joy streamed down my face in my final resting pose.

"10 minutes into practice today, the furnace of my rental house blew. IN CANADIAN WINTER. So, yoga got cut short today but I&#39;m still counting it as a win because I got myself on the mat. Even if it was only 10 minutes (really like, 9 min and 45 seconds if I&#39;m being realistic) I made it there. I did a little cat-cow and some one legged pigeon.

It was daunting at first but the music was beautiful and your sneaky smiles of encouragement kept me going. <br />Much to my surprise I was very teary at the beginning and then at the end actually had a good old cry<br />(BUT slightly sensitive at the mo and lady time fast approaching).<br />Thank you so much for sharing your heart with us Adriene, I&#39;ve wanted to reconnect with yoga for some time now and I know I will continue on this journey home with your support - this practice has felt so wonderful.<br />Thank you.xx<br />Demi, London, UK",Demi O,2020-02-10T21:10:35Z,0
"I have to admit that I felt a little reluctant  on whether  I should do this practise or not. The thought of not having  the voice of Adriene to guide me through this, made me feel kind of scared and insecure  about me, like: &quot;what if I don&#39;t know what to do on the mat?&quot; Or &quot;what if I do it wrong?&quot;. In the end I&#39;ve decide to give it a try and the result was marvellous: My body surprised me by knowing  exactly what it wants! I was just concentrating  on my breath and left myself guided by my soul and my body. It was the first  time after a long period where I&#39;ve trusted myself again and proved  that I am capable of doing something. I finish the home yoga journey still imperfect, full of flaws and insecure about many things in life but with a tremendous  important  lesson that I&#39;ve learned: to accept myself the way I am. To welcome all the imperfections  and to befriend my insecurities. Thank you Adriene for showing me that it&#39;s ok to be broken, and that life is an endless  journey  wjere we search our lost smithereens and try to achieve  our best version.

"Adriene that was the most amazing practice. This journey has been exactly what I needed to affirm my love for myself and my commitment to caring for myself both mind and body. <br />At first I had a hard time getting to the mat each day, but as time passed I began to realize how essential my yoga practice is to my self care. At first when I missed a day I would be very self critical, but as I progressed I realized that I can allow myself to choose when I practice and forgive myself for the days when I may choose an alternative. <br />I am going to continue my journey and do my best to make it to the mat each day while following the calendar that you sent out.

"I&#39;ve had anorexia when I was 13 and although my weight stabilised after therapy I was still carrying a lot of negative assumptions about me and my body for the last 12 years. Those assumptions became  more and more conscious during the last year and I had a hard time continuing to eat and staying in a loving relationship with my body.

"I finished this today, on February the 9th, in my little corner of Spain. The 30th day is so important to me. I felt quite sad today, that&#39;s why I knew I really needed to get home. I was ready. I just started crying from the very beginning with her words and hold my tears during the practice at several moments. I was very excited and nervous as if it was a test. I wasn&#39;t always synchronized with her but I didn&#39;t feel bad about it. Her instructions resonated in my head and I said a lot of them out loud to give me confidence, the name of the postures, the mantras... One that really stuck for me  on this Home journey was &quot; Find your footing&quot;. A great metaphor I can use off the mat. <br />Everything was really dynamic, I felt my heart racing , I enjoyed the effort with a smile. The music was fascinating too because it was the &quot;Home&quot; theme. I finally arrived to the end of this journey really happy with my accomplishments. I needed to let go some heavy burden that I&#39;ve been carrying around for more time than necessary. This journey gave me hope and made me trust myself a bit more. It&#39;s tough but I&#39;m getting stronger.<br />Thanks so much Adriene, beautiful angel 💙💙💙💙",ManderleyDreams,2020-02-09T17:24:08Z,0

"This was such an emotional practice for me. My mantras throughout the journey were &quot;I am strong&quot; and &quot;I am capable&quot;. I hoped that I would gain strength through this 30 day journey and, as always, I gained so much more. Near the end of my practice today, I was in a supine twist and I repeated to myself &quot;I am strong, I am capable, I am worthy&quot; and found myself answering back in tears &quot;you have been all along&#39;. I found release from some of the tension I have been holding on to for so long and was able to finally connect it to anger about my past. I now know what my soul has been searching for and truly have started to find my way home. Thank you so much for this journey, Adriene. Namaste 🙏🏻",EJ2894,2020-02-09T16:20:56Z,0

"Here we are! Two friends, Renata and Aya practicing at home and gym in Hanoi, Vietnam! Today we finished 30 days. Biggest benefit we feel is the achievement to finish it 30 days in low. Even we do not see changes much our body changes and we can not do all the postures, our flexibility got better. And what is the most important, we look forward to exercise. We liked the fact that we could exercise together. That was important for us, and we liked that it was kind of surprise what is waiting for us for the next class. During our last class without the guidance, just music, we realized that we still have to work on remembering the patterns so we decided to continue with another 30 days challenges. Which one you would recommend, the one from last year? Some of the postures are really hard for us. Like changing the positions to get the leg from plank to the front. Same to return the leg bag to the standing position. Our feeling is our arm is too short but may be there are some advice or trick that we did not figure out yet. So thank you very much and now we enjoy your tea and we like! Greeting goes as well to Benji💓💓",Aya Takahashi,2020-02-09T09:20:22Z,0

"Finished on February 8th! Thank you Adriene for such a fantastic journey home. I have never stuck to a yoga “program” before but I really enjoyed my almost daily practice with you. I also really surprised myself that I completed 40 minutes of self led yoga with this final practice. It’s apparent to me that I’ve gained both physical and mental flexibility and am capable of more than I sometimes give myself credit for. I am proud of myself (and everyone else) for completing these 30 days but am sad to see it end. Looking forward to following the February “kiss” calendar. Thank you again, Adriene, for sharing your knowledge and light with all of us around the world.",Amy Moodie,2020-02-09T05:01:36Z,0
"I did it! Felt so emotional as I bowed and whispered &quot;namaste.&quot; I had bumps along the way and I had days where I did not show up for myself but here I am, nourishing the benefits of this practice. I trusted myself and I trusted you. This has been a wonderful journey for me and I slowly learned to have that courage and strength to show up and to tell myself, &quot;you got this!&quot; I have some things going on and work can be stressful but at the end of the day I always have that feeling of joy when I show up and come home to myself. There&#39;s always that excitement even when I am not emotionally or physically okay, I am able to say &quot;I CAN&#39;T WAIT TO COME HOME AND DO YOGA&quot; I am truly grateful that I found you. It was on January 2 when I typed, &quot;yoga&quot; and your channel was the first to pop up! I am looking forward to continuing my journey home as I make yoga a part of my daily ritual.

"Since the first of this year I have completed an internship, moved to a different city, and began my bachelor&#39;s thesis, and in mid January my grandfather died. I have followed this practice in multiple apartments, multiple countries, in my grandmother&#39;s attic, in hostel bedrooms. In a season of very rapid changes in my own life, but also in the west, through brexit and impeachment trials and all of the rest, this series of practices has been a constant. A daily reminder that I am well, that my body is beautiful, a daily reminder to allow myself time to do absolutely nothing, and over that time, I have watched myself and the other 5,500 people who have followed this practice grow stronger, calmer, more aware, more mindful. I&#39;m just so overwhelmed with gratitude for the gift of this practice. <br />What I&#39;m tying to say is, thanks for leading us home &lt;3",asher coady,2020-02-08T23:13:50Z,0

"Thank you from the bottom of my heart for guiding this amazing journey. In the course of these 30 programs I have built physical strength that no other program has provided for many, many years. Along the way I also learned to do what felt good and nothing more (ah well maybe there were a few sequences for the abs that felt more beneficial than exactly good ;) ).

I found it easiest not to look at the screen unless I was in a place to do so. Added some pigeons and extra stretching, it was so nice.

Move like you love yourself.  Dont decide where it ends. I love you.&quot; By the end. Sitting with hands to forehead, all I could hear was &quot;come home, come home, come home&quot;.

"Dear Adriene, thank you from the bottom of my heart for this journey home. There were days when I struggled with the title of this journey, I lost my physical home, a place that I loved, through divorce, and have felt displaced every since. And toward the end of this yoga journey I began travelling, back to sea, back to my other home, to a place that has been a huge part of my life, a place that I am uncertain whether to continue to live in or whether to let go of. Thank you for reminding me that home is not a geographical location, but a place within me to be carried wherever I go. It is an honour to be guided by you and to be a part of this global community. I am grateful and thankful for you Adriene and for the tools you have given me that I know will see me through anything that comes my way. Namaste 🙏🏻",Amanda Fisher,2020-02-08T03:15:27Z,0

Loved this yoga session. My 11yr old son and I do an ‘Adriene Yoga’ every morning. He is Autistic and this really sets him up for a good start to the day. <br />One thing that disappointed him is that the heart was not there at the end of day 30. He also remembered it wasn’t there last year as well. Sounds like a small thing I know but he watches all the way to the end to see it. So he asked me to ask you to-‘Bring back the heart please’.<br />Love always ❤️🙏,Bill Naydon,2020-02-08T01:33:55Z,0
"I like that quote is quite true. I feel like that after this last day was perfect and full. Well it was a beautiful new beginning 😉. We did it! I got a boost of energy during the practice and I felt guided by you as well as by my intuition. Yes. I took care of myself in my little corner of the world for this great program. Determination, motivation and strength of the Spirit. It was a concentrate of this today to me. The music relaxed my mind for this session (excellent choice) and later I was like; Oh! The theme of Home. It was a honor for all too I think to follow it. Thank you very much Adriene. It was a fantastic job! Namaste.",Fanfan MentalistFictions,2020-02-08T01:13:48Z,0

"I began this 30 day journey in one state, then traveled to another (which was my home of origin), and finished in Australia, my new home. I was 5 days behind because of days on planes, trains, and automobiles, then have been putting off day 30 for another couple because this is my third 30 day January with Adriene so I knew what was coming and, I&#39;ll be honest, I was scared. But I put on my big girl pants (as they say here in Aus) and dove in and found that I have truly been transformed over the last month and in a larger sense over the last three years with you. There were a few times I looked at the screen and we were doing the same thing so I would flow with you for a few minutes, then we would go our separate ways. I feel uplifted, strong, and grounded. I am so grateful for you, for me, for this community. At the end I cried with gratitude and joy. Thank you thank you thank you!",Tj Lova,2020-02-08T00:21:54Z,0

"I was under the weather for the first week of the new year, so I couldn&#39;t start the course until I felt better, so I only completed the 30-day course today...but what a wonderful daily ritual to have! I went through a myriad of emotions - Sometimes I was so up for it I&#39;d be full of beans on the mat, other times I really couldn&#39;t be arsed - but I still made it to the mat and always left so glad I did! There were times I was joyously happy and sometimes where I was totally frustrated. all this culminated today, where out of nowhere, when we put the 29 days altogether, I slowly became deeply connected to a sadness that I was able to release in a heavy wave of emotion at the end of the practice and I have felt so light since! I was pretty amazed at how much I remembered and was able to do without you telling me to as well! I&#39;m now going to head on over to one of your other 30 days and keep this daily ritual rolling...This is the good shizzle! Thank you so much, you legend!",Mark Mathews,2020-02-07T21:14:30Z,0

"Finished day 30 only today yay! I have to say, hearing the old 30 days challenges&#39;s themes got me hard. While I was flowing I was reflecting on all those days and challenges I shared with you. All those sweating days, cozy days, hot days, heart to heart days. The journey home. This is something. Thanks to my therapies and yoga with you, I healed so many things in my soul and body. I hope you do feel my love, our love! and gratitude for you because &#39;girl! That&#39;s something! I will forever thank you for helping building better foundations for my life.

"Thank you, Adriene. I&#39;ve been practicing with you for years and have started many of your 30-day challenges, but this is the first one that I&#39;ve ever finished. Part of doing this, for me, was to get back into the habit of being on the mat each day, so even though some days I didn&#39;t have time for a video, your constant encouragement got me there, on the mat, anyway, doing whatever I could for however long I had. Another part was trusting myself to listen to what my body needs during self-guided yoga. I&#39;ll continue to turn to videos for certain needs and strength-building, but now I&#39;ll also turn more often to me. Thank you. &lt;3",Tamara Zoner,2020-02-07T03:18:15Z,0

However, even though I found this practice a little bit challenging I thoroughly enjoyed it and I even got a bit emotional towards the end of the practice. So I just wanted to thank you very much for everything that you do and for helping me discover and develop a deep love for yoga. Can’t wait to hop on the mat again tomorrow to start February’s yoga calendar (even if I’m a few days behind 😄💗).",Emma Bradley,2020-02-06T20:39:34Z,13

Question: I have recently started doing yoga in the last 2 months. I unfortunately did not give my body the rest it needed today and tweaked what feels like a tendon in my elbow. Do you have any flows that are standing only or could you make a video that does not put strain on the elbows?,Emily Kerscher,2020-02-06T19:18:24Z,0

This is my first 30 days, and I have enjoyed every minute of it. Totally hooked. And while I will always prefer Adriene with the mic on, this was a novel experience, and I surprised myself at how much I went with it.

This is the 2nd 30 days of yoga i have done and marks just over a year that i really got into yoga thanks to you. I can&#39;t now think of my life without the flowing benefits that yoga provides me whenever and whatever mood i may be in. It has proved to be better than any other therapy i have had. I am so honored to say that you are the reason i began practicing yoga and will never stop! I always leave the mat with a huge smile on my face, and that really is something. Much love from England x",megan,2020-02-06T01:02:27Z,0
Thank you for this  series and especially this last one. I was just saying yesterday I feel like I can’t cry like I want to but can’t and today I cried at the 2nd child’s pose and through the twists. I had a migraine all day and I think the crying relieved it and I think the yoga helped get it out! I am very emotional after this one. Thanks so much!

"What an amazing experience. I not only committed to something I needed very badly, but it came at exactly the time I needed it most. I sobbed with happiness and pride when the screen went black — and then the quote that says it all about what this year is about for me. Having this practice in place mid-January when a dozen things went terribly &quot;wrong,&quot; I found myself more able to see what was &quot;right.&quot; Thank you for catching me and guiding me to my stronger self.

During this silent yoga I felt inspired just to do my own thing. Moving in and out of poses like they came to my mind. Just looked at the screen once in a while to see how much time was left. Wonderfully at some point I came into a squat and naturally tried and (for the first time!!) managed to do a crow pose. Beautiful!,Sina Muster,2020-02-05T17:04:01Z,0
"What a lovely 30 day journey! I felt more powerful with each video, more sure of myself just to close my eyes and follow your voice during the practice. And how terribly insecure I felt when you took of your microphone in the last video. Craning my neck every couple of minutes to at least keep up with the moves. Please reconsider talking us through the video, maybe you can leave out the visuals or encourage us to close our eyes and find what feels good ourselves. And not make me feel so lost.",Pauline Depière,2020-02-05T16:38:53Z,0

My voice teacher has commented on how my breathing and posture are different this year, and I feel a new sense of calm and confidence. Supported by the breath, the life. Thank you for this annual start to the year. I shall go forward with that most advanced of yoga postures: turning up the corners of the mouth.",SteventheThorn,2020-02-05T15:06:21Z,0

"Thank you so much Adrienne!!! January 2020 was filled with so much stress, but doing yoga with you helped me manage it in ways I couldn&#39;t imagine before. As someone with severe anxiety disorders, I should&#39;ve been a blubbering, anxiety-filled person this past month, but instead I was able to take the lessons you shared and apply them throughout my days. If I started to feel overwhelmed, I would try to take a second to breathe lots of love in and lots of love out. My husband even said the other day that he loves that I love doing yoga with you because he can tell it helps my anxiety! He said I seem so much calmer after.<br /><br />So thank you, Adrienne, for changing lives (especially mine) and for changing the world. I hope I can thank you in person some day! ❤️<br /><br />Namaste 🙏",Jayda Skidmore,2020-02-05T11:54:43Z,0

My comment is late Adriene because I have not been well these last few days but I was determined to finish the 30 days so I did day 30 today. I started really well listening to my body from one move to another which I have never done before. It was awesome but after 20 mins I ran out of ideas and needed to follow you! I did miss your voice but it felt really good being able to work on my own and I was so amazed that I could do things today that I couldn&#39;t do 30 days ago. I am hooked Adriene and I will be continuing my yoga practice with you but thank you so much for giving your time and energy so freely to sharing your love of yoga with us. You are a very special lady. Namaste  xx,Karen Lynne,2020-02-05T08:27:28Z,0
"I procrastinated this last one because I was afraid I couldn&#39;t manage a 40-minute practice without your instruction. I&#39;m finally here, and I&#39;m proud to say that I made it. I did peek a few times (catching adorable Benji joining on the mat) when I was lost in my flow, but it was mostly me. Your gentle voice carried me through the &#39;journey&#39; (this practice, yoga, and life). I&#39;m really grateful I found you. You helped me learn self-compassion, which brings me out of the dark shadow of my depressive state. With that as basis, I&#39;m now more ready to serve others and pass on the love I&#39;ve received. Thank you so so much Adriene. May you and your team be in peace always. Namaste.",Cindy Cheng,2020-02-05T07:11:46Z,0

"To everyone who&#39;s made it this far, you&#39;re my heroes. To those of you who, like me, are finishing this on February 5th, you&#39;re amazing. To those of you who will come to finish this at any point in the future, you&#39;re all awesome. Home is not a place where you come to hang your hat at the end of each day, but it&#39;s the version of you who is ready to receive all that which is good in life, and the bad. Adrienne has hit it on the spot by showing us that home is a journey, and I know that I speak for all of us when I say thank you, Adrienne, for inspiring and challenging us to become better versions of ourselves. To continue to journey home. Don&#39;t let the journey stop here, for every new breath is a new beginning, and it&#39;s up to you to decide what it&#39;ll bring. So to all of you, welcome home.

"It took me a few days to finally be able to do this last video and at the beginning of this journey, I was teary eyed at the end whenever you said Namaste, and this time I just started bawling. I couldn’t believe I finished this and I’m somewhat sad it’s over. This was such a nice practice and I’m blown away by how much I remember (even if I did follow along with you through the video - I went on some footpaths and eventually found myself on the same road again). <br /><br />Last year, I began Dedicate but couldn’t even get through the first or second video. It seemed too overwhelming for me, and I wasn’t ready. But now I am. Thank you for everything. I’m going to continue my yoga practice because I enjoyed it so much.",Bahareh,2020-02-05T04:02:27Z,0

I feel I made a progress in my yoga practice, I am more alert now and also I am not frustrated of being still and silent. Namaste 🙏🏻❤️",Rositsa Ivanova,2020-02-04T18:00:42Z,0

I had a dream the other night that I was looking for a blue healer puppy, but already have 2 dogs that are definitely not as calm as Benji and think when I am laying down that walking on me might be a good idea.

"Thank you Adriene for this series! This is the first 30 day challenge I’ve done with you and I’ve never felt so connected to my body and my breath. I can feel it throughout my everyday activities and I feel so much calmer in general. I have to admit I shed a few tears during the shavasana as it refers to death, reminding me of how we lost Kobe this last weekend. Knowing that he isn’t alive anymore, that he won’t be able to see his beautiful daughters grow and the kids he mentored blossom into their full potential deeply saddens me whenever it crosses my mind, but it also makes me grateful to be alive. Grateful that I still have breath. Grateful that I can nurture and strengthen my body.

Suddenly, I was comparing myself and thinking oh no I haven’t done this pose or this pose and it’s not going to be a fulfilling practice. Then I reeled myself in and remembered that yoga isn’t about comparing or meeting a certain number of poses per practice. All the things you said throughout the series came flooding back and I finished the rest of the practice with a smile of gratitude. Gratitude that I accomplished something, gratitude for all the support in the comments, and gratitude for the body I am in (which has been a tumultuous relationship at times). I look forward to continuing to grow in my practice and in myself!",Victoria Juvera,2020-02-04T03:50:47Z,0

"Hi Adrienne!!<br />I just finished the challenge because I came down with the flu around Day 15. I must admit, I was heartbroken to finish behind everyone else... but I finished, and I am so happy! Throughout this challenge I have gained SO MUCH flexibility!!! I can now do the splits, touch my forehead to my knees in forward fold (with straight legs) and touch my heels to the mat in downward dog! I have to admit, these are things I never thought I would be able to do. Yoga has been the one constant throughout this crazy, crazy month... some days, between work and school, it was the only time I had for myself... and most of my days have been 16 hours long! Basically, what I’m trying to say is... thank you, for everything. You are truly amazing... we all are! <br />Blessings everyone😘<br />Namaste🙏",Sarah Vines,2020-02-03T22:18:15Z,0

I had only done a couple of yoga classes before starting this 30 day &quot;challenge&quot;, and I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to have the determination to stick with it. Some days were harder than others, but I got to day 30! But today, at the beginning of the video, when you said there would be no &quot;instructions&quot;, I panicked. I didn&#39;t trust myself without you. And you know what happened? I did it anyway, and I was ok.

"For me, this was honestly the worst practice of the journey and I feel like its ended on a down note. I&#39;d wanted to really get stuck into this one and compare it to how I felt on day 1. But that was impossible to do when I was constantly having to tilt my head and look at what I was supposed to be going into next. Meaning I wasn&#39;t giving my all to each pose and it didn&#39;t flow like usual. The whole point of this for me is having a guide, if I&#39;d wanted to make up my own routine I wouldn&#39;t be here. I&#39;ve loved the journey and the progress up until now, but this video is definitely not for me. Quite disappointing for me unfortunately.",sianharvey,2020-02-03T12:45:21Z,2

With the beautiful music and your graceful movements, I watched and thought, “There’s a woman who loves her body.” And then I stopped, and realized: I am doing the same movements to the same beautiful music. Do I... also love my body? Wait. <i>I’m doing this because I love my body.</i> Idk if that’s not a profound revelation to anyone else, but for me, that was a BIG DEAL to realize. I’m doing this because I love myself, you guys! I proceeded to cry healing tears all through the rest of the practice. Thank you, Adriene. I think...

"of all the 30 day journeys we have been on together, this one was really real to me. i have always been afraid to do things on my own, unconsciously not trusting my inner teacher/wisdom/intuition. but today- oh today was different. this is the first day 30 that i was able to get through on my own, AND even had more to do after you were finished and the video stopped. it was so comforting to know i was able to sit with myself, my breath, and just flow for 40 minutes!? truly something i never thought would happen. i feel so connected and in tune with inner teacher now, and am amazed at how strong and graceful i can be. <br />this past 30 days have been a magical journey, a real shift in perspective. the synchronicities all around me are mind blowing. so many things about the “journey home.” how fitting. “how’d they know?” it’s almost comical to me looking back now. that the answers i was seeking were within me all along. i can’t thank you enough, adriene (and benji)! i am grateful for this platform, and your willingness to serve not only yourself but others all over the world. something even close to yoga with adriene is something i haven’t found yet in my local yoga community. i love the intention, the way adriene lets you know “i got you,” “you’ve got this,” you’re strong,” “find what feels good,” “from your center,” is such a reminder that yoga is so much more than asanas. you have somehow found a way to put the foundations into each and every video, and i believe that is why your videos are so helpful and hit home (😉) for so many people. <br /><br />thank you again. adriene, benji, and all of those who joined me on this journey home. 🙏🏽🙌🏽💕",mango,2020-02-03T03:08:40Z,0

I managed to complete the journey and I&#39;m proud to have finished it and given it a try, even though I know that I will not continue as I did not like it enough in order to keep it going.

"I love Adriene but I  am not a fan of the silent videos. If there had just been one word about which positions were happening every now and then I would have been golden, but I watch these videos off a cell phone so my whole practice was spent moving the phone around and twisting my neck to see what the heck was happening. I guess it&#39;s different if you use a TV or actually want to freestyle your yoga. But that&#39;s not me.",Rensy,2020-02-02T21:55:50Z,0

"My third year doing your 30 Days of Yoga and I have never enjoyed the last day, too busy stressing and trying to keep up with the video! I very nearly almost didn’t press play on this one but I thought I’d go in with an open mind and see how it went! Instead of trying to keep up with the video I just did my own thing and used what you were doing any time I caught a glance of the video for future inspiration. At 36 minutes I looked at my watch and was disappointed the time was nearly over! Thank you Adriene for all you do, your heart is so apparent, and everyone taking part. We’re home 🥰",Alanna Salter,2020-02-02T20:38:53Z,0

"Well, I&#39;m somewhere in between on this practice. Yes, I did love the freedom and the sort of.. depth of practice that gave me. Being able to sometimes stay in a pose just because I found something that felt good. But still, I had this nagging feeling that I was going to miss a move, or a body part. Since I really like full-body yoga classes, I ended up looking at the screen much more than I usually do. Then at the end when the Home music came on, I was still in savasana and felt a bit lonely to find that it was already over... Also, I realise I probably didn&#39;t do day 30 on True och Dedicate, because I really can&#39;t remember mic off being a tradition. xD",nuquernawithiel,2020-02-02T19:51:05Z,0

Could feel your reverence and love for this practice, so beautiful to have completed these 30 days - already miss the live feeling (although I never did att the actual time as I live in Sweden).

Thanks so much Adiene for helping me find that bit of time for me.  I am a stay at home mom to two kids and a work from home husband, I never seem to find time for just me.

Just coming out of  an emotional depression, your HOME reminded me who I was, who I am now, and who I want to be in the future. You truly are a blessing.",shanice darby,2020-02-02T18:57:40Z,0
"Thank you for reminding all of us to nourish the only home we have during this journey, our body! It took a  catastrophic injury and two years of chronic pain to realize that all the external stuff is unnecessary clutter when the internal is in a state of unbalance. Love your body because it&#39;s yours and no one elses. If you take care of this vessel it will take care of you. I was watching Beyonce&#39;s homecoming performance on Netflix and I enjoyed the achievement more because she worked so hard to get her strength and stamina back after having twins. It&#39;s nice to let go of obsessing over physical appearance to focus on internal strength. It&#39;s kind of magical to just love and appreciate your body for what it&#39;s capable of instead of what it looks like.",Andrea Morgan,2020-02-02T18:54:36Z,0

In that moment, I realized just how much I&#39;ve learned about myself on and off the mat in the last two years. You have helped me grow so much through this channel.

Deepest gratitude. I did all thirty days missing a couple days. Catching up yeti sessions in a day. It’s all good. When I came to this last one and heard <br />“I’m taking off the mic” I started to go into frustration but the you said something about making it your own. So I did. I’ve done yoga for many years the last few not as much as I would have liked. So I got on the mat and just felt what I needed to do for me. Sometimes we were doing the same things. Cool. A couple of times I just watched you move and it reminded me to lift my heart or ground the corners of my feet.  Thank you 🙏,Tonnie Schroeder,2020-02-02T15:49:41Z,0

Day 30 was, well, interesting, I will admit I struggled without your voice to guide me. In previous practises I didn&#39;t need to look at the screen always as I let your voice guide me. I felt wobbly and unsure if I could do it without your voice and then....I allowed myself to trust, I mean the flow does come naturally if you let it. I then began to really enjoy it.

I have started these 30 day journeys a few times but this is the first year I have saw it through to the end.

And then, that I see, I hear, I notice, I experience, love and embrace. Thank you, Adriene! It was a beautiful, life-changing journey. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve ever been as calm as I an now.

"Thank you. First and foremost. I have been meaning to join in with the monthly practises for a while now and this is the one I actually stuck to, hard at first but easier as I went on thanks to your unending enthusiasm for teaching and sharing. It&#39;s baffling how wonderful these practises are and how they have changed my mind and body! I was wary of this practise when you first said that you wouldn&#39;t so much as be leading it, a scary thought and I have to say that I panicked. But I got in the flow and got lost and struggled but it was nice to be able to play and also have you there just in case. <br />Thank you again, so, so much.",Emily Mattinson,2020-02-02T11:57:20Z,0

"Wow what a journey. I started this journey crying at the end of the first video (for the first time after a  yoga video) I ended this journey crying at the beginning and the end of this video. Today I read your mail and I already started tearing up. Then I started this practice and I just started crying. So in tradition I just showed up with what I had going on and started to find what feels good. So for the first few minutes just sat there crying. And the tension that I&#39;ve been having in my shoulders the last few days just disappeared. Usually I get this pain in my throat, this lump in my throat so big that I almost can&#39;t breath. This time I felt my throat a little for just a second and then it was already gone. So eventually I started the slowly move and begin my practice. During this practice I begin too feel so light. This last few weeks feel like I have been digging deep in some old pains and have been processing them. It has been tough but also needed. At the end I thought, I did it and just felt so grateful. So the tears came again. And while laying there I heard you voice Adriene so strong saying, you are loved and you are worthy. And I truly felt it in my heart and soul. So you guessed it I started crying even more. So thank you so much Adriene for this Home journey and helping me process this old pains. I&#39;m forever grateful, Namaste",Miranda,2020-02-02T10:44:13Z,0

"I was feeling rather agitated and distracted when I came to my mat for Day 30 of Home and then realised that there would be no instructions from Adriene and almost didn’t do the practice because I didn’t think I’d be able to concentrate without being told what to do!  I’m so glad that I stuck with it, though! The 40 minutes flew by and there was something so serene and mindful about just doing the practice to music and focusing more on the movements and how they felt.  I feel like a different person and really proud to have completed the full 30 days.  I feel stronger, calmer and more flexible after finishing the Home series.  Thank you so much, Adriene! You are a yoga superstar!",Nbroogie,2020-02-02T10:30:46Z,0

Adriene, you&#39;ve been in my daily life for 2 years now, &amp; I&#39;m always grateful. The start of the year has been a challenging one, as I&#39;m now away from home &amp; in a new country alone. Thankfully for this practise, I had the space to appreciate myself in how far I&#39;ve come, how much I&#39;ve endured, how well I&#39;ve done that I don&#39;t give myself credit for. Once again, I was reminded how to love myself. &amp; that it&#39;s okay. It will be okay. I&#39;m home.",Vanessa Chin,2020-02-02T09:51:38Z,0

"HOME was my first journey into yoga, the first time I pushed away all the limiting beliefs that yoga was boring and not my cup of tea, and just pressed play. And it was one of the most amazing experiences. I came to the mat every single day, despite the challenges life throws at us. I came to the mat at 3 am and at 11:00 pm. I had days where it seemed too hard, and days where it felt effortless. It thought me to trust myself, to listen to what my body needs and wants, to feel that elusive self-love, to let go of negativity and toxic anxiety, to relax my shoulders, and to breath. Thank you, Adriene, for bringing this light into my life!",gilieva,2020-02-02T09:10:48Z,4

I think the main thing I have learnt, which is something I hope to carry with me for the rest of my life, is to accept myself exactly as I am in this moment. No judgement, no guilt, no shame. Just seeing where I am and knowing that I already possess everything I need to both succeed and just &#39;be&#39;. I feel so much more content and strong and centred within myself and I hope I can keep this going for as long as I can.

Today was like doing yoga next to a friend rather than a teacher and I loved the opportunity to take my own path home. Thank you for this journey!,Crystal-lee,2020-02-02T06:03:21Z,0
"Also, the fact that the practise was unedited allowed for more Benjie time, he really put a smile on my face.",Nahla Aly,2020-02-02T05:33:01Z,2
"Welcome home everyone. We have arrived. By the end of the video, I didn&#39;t want the music to end. This will be the tune I hum when I need peace from now on. It felt a little odd not to have your voice guide me and actually having to look at the screen (I do most of the practices with my eyes shut if I can help it). But I found myself imagining what you would say, root to rise,  downward dog paddle it out, close your eyes, bat your eyes open, bow down, Namaste. <br />Namaste to you, Adriene. So much love!",Nahla Aly,2020-02-02T05:31:31Z,0
"So happy to have taken the journey and to have arrived home,,,even if I never really left...but it is a different home here on day 30. A home where I feel more grounded and supported than I did at the end of 2019. Having Benji there was pivotal for me since I lost my Joey pup in September,  so for sharing him with me I am ever grateful. Thank you Adriene for your exceptional human touch and openness. Much Love.",Catrin Jonsson,2020-02-02T05:13:44Z,0

ADRIENE! I&#39;m graduating TEACHER TRAINING tomorrow!!! I&#39;m in the Rocky mountains in Colorado. An hour away from Denver (Shoshoni) and you were my first ever yoga video. You inspired me to do this. It&#39;s been so hard. But such a beautiful thing. I just want to say thank you. You mean so much to me. I LOVE YOU. NAMASTE<br /><br />P.S.

"Thank you, Adriene. I am so happy to have completed this especially with so many life changes I went through in just 30 days. I stayed centered and came home to myself.

"This whole series was just so beautiful and it&#39;s so bittersweet that it&#39;s over. Your videos, Adriene, and your lovely personality are what keeps me coming back to this channel everyday for the past few years. Through this series, I&#39;ve found my love for yoga again and tried to really feel everything, rather than just going through the motions like I&#39;d been accustomed to recently. For today&#39;s practice I had some incense burning and put rain sounds on in the bg, it was so relaxing. Through the whole journey my cat has been right next to me. I lay out a yoga mat next to mine and he sits on it as soon as it&#39;s time for our practice. Thank you so much Adriene! (and Benji) love you both. &lt;3 namaste.",Haley,2020-02-02T03:10:35Z,0
"I just did the first session of 10,000 Tapping, after completing the 30 day Home practice. I think it was a good flow from one to the other and I really let out some emotions just like I do on the mat with Adriene. The organizer is trying to reach 10000 for the Maharishi effect, so we were encouraged to share. There are six tapping sessions left. This isn&#39;t normally my thing but I thought it was worth a shot and I&#39;m glad I attended the first session. Maybe you could be too. <a href=""https://www.unify.org/10000tapping"">https://www.unify.org/10000tapping</a>",Jessica Head,2020-02-02T03:09:43Z,0

We both enjoyed the practices and it felt so good to have a pal with whom to share such an amazing experience. This challenge got us closer, we laughed wit your jokes and love to see sleepy Benji everyday! We freaked out our dog with our lion breaths and hold each other while balancing. It was tender!

"I was a day behind so today was my day 30. I&#39;ve really noticed a change in my strength and flexibility over the last 30 days, even my toes seem more flexible, lol! I&#39;ve done these 30 day YWA challenges for, I think, the past 6 years, so I knew what to expect on this day. I decided, just as a challenge, to do my own thing and not focus too much on what was on the screen. It made me slow down, relax and take my time. I have to admit, I did lose my focus a little trying to figure out how much time went by. I got it back and carried on until the final namaste. Can I just say, I got a little emotional at the end. I know you&#39;ll have more for us throughout the year, and I can&#39;t wait to see you all again soon! Until then, keep rocking the tree poses and one-legged pigeons 😀 Namaste everyone 🙏🤗",Cheri Powers,2020-02-02T01:24:12Z,0

I&#39;ve been in the process of moving and I started the practice feeling the weight of stress finally release, and spent the first five or so minutes crying. But I gave myself the space to do so and by the end I was crying tears of joy. While I didn&#39;t feel yet at home in my new place, this journey made me realize I am home no matter where I am, simply because I&#39;m there. And this is only the beginning, not the end.

"Ahhh... I will always that smile in the intro - the one where you hold a mug in your hands. This video went so fast. This &quot;Home&quot; journey went so fast. I legit spent 10 - or so - minutes more at the end. I definitely didn&#39;t have the time to do everything that I wanted, though. I loved how we went into the boat pose combo at the same time. How you went into poses when I was just thinking about going into them. I loved the flow. This must be one of the very best practices I&#39;ve ever done. Plus, the tracks were perfectly chosen!!! I read the poem (?) at the end and it teared me up! I don&#39;t want this to end, ugh! Still, I feel like I&#39;m getting where I want to be. A bit slow but I&#39;m enjoying the process. Maybe, it&#39;s just that: a journey. Might as well breathe deeply and go with the flow while enjoying (and learning from!) the bumps &lt;3",Sarah S.,2020-02-01T22:46:41Z,0

"Thank you so much Adriene! It&#39;s been six years now that i&#39;ve been practising with you and every year at the end of the 30-day yoga Challenge I cry like a baby....because i still find it hard to believe how far i&#39;ve come in my practice and what amazing things yoga has brought into my life. I practised every day of this challenge even if I had to stay up till midnight to do it, even when i felt super tired and then yesterday, on the last day, the most important day, i had a stomach bug and was simply bed-ridden. Absolutely gutted that for the first time i could&#39;t finish on time but it was all worth it when i finished it today, every second of it. I&#39;ll definitely repeat the program and happy to say I&#39;ve convinced others to do it too. So again Namaste for all the magic and joy you bring into our lives. We love you :) xxx",Alina Stoicescu,2020-02-01T21:36:38Z,0
"Hi Adriene...and most of all, thank you.  Piggybacking on what Dianne Graham said earlier, I hear your voice also saying, &quot;find your center&quot;, &quot;I show up because you show up&quot;, &quot;you got this&quot;, and many more encouraging messages.  You are an excellent teacher.  Day 30 taught me that my practice is still good if I make it my own....it&#39;s okay to pet my dog during practice (loved when Benji got onto your mat), I can pick lint off my mat during a pose, I can find what feels right and hold some poses longer than others (&quot;my version&quot;), etc.  I am grateful for you popping up in my IG feed in late December--what a blessing this has been.

"I enjoy the Day 30 practice so much, even though it’s so challenging! I always start off knowing what I want to work on, and then somewhere in the middle I start to feel lost so always look to you, Adriene, until I find my flow again. I built a sweat, stretched my tired muscles, and enjoyed the process. But when the “Home” music started, right before the end, I just lost it - overcome with emotion! 😭💕",Michelle Harvey,2020-02-01T21:00:44Z,0
"I usually dislike the final day of the 30-day yoga challenges - not bc I don&#39;t like the practice, but the silence is a challenge.  I&#39;ve found after years of doing at-home yoga with Adriene, I tend to do it nearly all with my eyes shut and just follow the cues, so the silent practice totally throws me off (and makes it much less relaxing than usual).  This year, I found a happy medium of looking up when I needed to, being okay with finding my own flow, and if I wasn&#39;t synched up when I popped my eyes back open, I just realized I was okay with that and found what felt good.  Great 30-days to start 2020 :o)",Shelley Sontag,2020-02-01T21:00:43Z,0
"Unpopular opinion: This was my first time participating in 30 days of yoga and day 30 was so disappointing for me, I cried. I like the structure of someone talking me through the breathing and the poses. That’s why I play videos instead of referring to the pictures of poses you can find on Pinterest. I don’t want to stare at someone or a picture... I want the guidance of someone talking me through it. To each their own I guess... 🤷‍♀️",Alyssa Brown-Tomanek,2020-02-01T20:59:52Z,0

"Today was so so amazing! First of all, it was the day of me completing my goal to do this challenge and I&#39;m so so grateful for your loving guidance along the way. There have been a huge amount of times over last year and this year that I&#39;ve felt really useless and like I couldn&#39;t do things but you&#39;ve helped me to do it! I feel such a massive sense of achievement and self love! As the challenge has gone on, I&#39;ve been able to love myself so much more and look after myself better and I&#39;m so so grateful to you Adriene. Secondly, the idea of Day 30 has always really daunted me! I always thought there was no way I&#39;d be able to practice on my own! I was really worried I&#39;d get bored, run out of ideas of what to do next, or I wouldn&#39;t make use of the time properly. And for 40 minutes? No way! But wow! Today was I think my favourite day of the whole challenge! Thank you so much Adriene for helping me to enjoy this challenge so much!!!

"HOME IS PROBABLY THE INTRO I&#39;M GOING TO MISS MORE! I started this 30 day program with an unsettled heart, one of my cats died some months ago and embracing this journey was specailly difficult for me. Some days have been specially hard cause I didnt even want to get out of bed, less step into the mat. But every day the intro made me feel safe, warm and in peace somehow. And the session helped me to get some ease and get away of the pain for 30 minutes. I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ll redo those 30 days later in the year and I hope it brings me the same feeling.

"Hello Adriene!<br />A huge Thank You for all the Yoga journey! It makes me feel better in many ways :)<br />There is also two small things I would consider to change in the future.<br />One thing is: when you turn to the camera when doing the first side, then I have to turn away from the screen to do the same move. Sometimes I tried to do opposite side first, but that&#39;s confusing for me. So for me it would be easier to follow, if you did the other side first, so I could watch it while I&#39;m doing it.<br />The other thing is really not that important and personal preference. I kept wondering why you chose to show us your pretty butt in close up every single day in the intro. For me it seems to private and a little inapropriate for the seriously good yoga you are doing.<br />The best thing about this series: all the precious thoughts beyond the shapes!",gather feather,2020-02-01T19:46:16Z,0

"Last night was supposed to be my thirtieth day of HOME but I crashed out after a birthday party. I&#39;m glad I had the morning energy to do this one right!<br />I did crow pose for like, FOUR seconds!!! At the end of my first 30 day challenge I think it was only 1 second, maybe. Anyway, I felt amazing! I did so many poses I had in my brain from these past few months doing yoga, plus some new practices and ways of thinking from HOME. I even saw you about to do boat pose and joined in. All of HOME I hadn&#39;t been able to do boat pose for as long as you, but I did it this time!<br />I feel so accomplished. This was my January goal, and I&#39;m so proud that I made it all the way through this month along with everyone else. <br />We made it HOME!<br />As always, thank you, Adriene. I almost cried at the poem at the end. You are such a gift to this world. I&#39;m so proud to be able to do yoga, and you made that possible. :)",Tony Maynard,2020-02-01T19:14:48Z,0

"I will remember the HOME as a time when I managed to get into full sirsasana, for the first time, after the practice with you.

"Illness kept me off the mat yesterday and I was so sad! This was the first year I’d followed the 30 day journey as the videos came out, and I hadn’t missed a day until day 30! Ugh! But I came back today to finish my journey. Happy to say it was a lovely experience. I loosely followed your lead at first but by minute 15 I was comfortably doing my own thing and I even ended up taking a little extra time at the end because I was enjoying myself so much. Thanks for the wonderful journey, Adriene! I’m looking forward to doing more yoga with you again tomorrow! 💗",Rachel A,2020-02-01T18:47:50Z,0

"Hey Miss, I&#39;ve been watching your videos for 5 years now, and I have started the 30-day challenge for the past 4 years. This was the first year that not only I made it past day 4 but actually made it all the way to the end. I am so proud of myself, I am so grateful for you. <br /><br /><br />Day 30 was a surprise, with no guidance for over 30 minutes of practice. I started out fearful that I couldn&#39;t make it, but I did. I stuck with it. Tears of joy at the end of the practice today. And now I intend to continue the practice.<br /><br /><br />You are an absolute gem and I thank you for your spirit.",Logan M,2020-02-01T18:06:38Z,0

"Beautiful, Adriene. Many tears have I shed this day. I cannot express how Life has truly woven for me a beautifully meaningful path, of which this Home yoga journey has played a special part. All of life is the journey but I wrote a story which has evolved and evolved over the years. There’s a small seed, stuck alone under the earth. Finally… finally she begins / I begin my long journey out into the light of day. Your quote for today fits perfectly. The metaphors of my story-tale-life… Thank you for all of it. Wonderful practice without the talking, and yet very difficult as there was so much to flow through and, without the voice, it was very difficult to authentically remain centred. Thank you thank you thank you Adriene ! For this role you are playing in my life and the lives of so many. May I continue the yoga with you and may my body, mind and heart grow so strong 💪 !!! I hope I hope I hope 🤞 ! Much Love… 💕",h2owalkforwater,2020-02-01T17:58:35Z,0

"I feel like i&#39;m missing out on something because I simply cannot do it without any audio cues. Yes, I have the &quot;vocabulary&quot;, yes I generally know what order we&#39;re going to do certain poses. But without something (or something - a bell?) telling me when to goto the next thing, I&#39;m constantly forced to look at my screen and it takes me out of the practice and makes me very frustrated. I don&#39;t want to sound ungrateful for this wonderful work. I&#39;ve tried every year to do the 30 days and this is the first year I made it. THANK YOU for everything you do. I&#39;m probably just being too literal-minded and not trusting myself enough to do it on my own without guidance. Maybe someday.",Kathy Moseley,2020-02-01T16:02:26Z,282
Like many one here I totally agree. I suggested in a separate comment that maybe they could do Day 30 with the mic on then Day 31 without the mic. I loved that Day 30 linked all the work we&#39;ve done throughout the practice and wouldn&#39;t change anything but needed the guidance  to help me remember all the moves we&#39;ve learnt. I love the idea of going it alone but it was too big a jump from Day 29,Alahree McDonell,2020-05-01T12:03:24Z,0
"I felt the same way the first time I did a 30 day yoga with adriene and it ended up being a frustrated ending rather than a beautiful one haha, but I guess it&#39;s all about how we deal with it<br />Don&#39;t feel the pressure to do so many poses or the pressure to Know what to do, we simply don&#39;t know, we&#39;re not adriene at this stage of our journey 😅 so &quot;find what feels good&quot; even if that meant spinding the practice in child&#39;s pose and cat cow 😁 focus on breathing and Enjoying what you know, it&#39;s still frustrating I know but the more you do yoga the more you feel at ease in flowing between poses ( and you still wouldn&#39;t know what to do and it would still be different than when adriene guides you)<br />But I guess we&#39;re doing our best and that&#39;s what matters :)<br />Have a lovely day",Rahaf Rab,2020-03-30T05:08:07Z,0

I have loved all 29 days - it has been an amazing experience! I am so grateful for it. But I totally agree and understand these comments myself.

"I&#39;ve been having one of the hardest weeks of my life. Yesterday someone I care very much about decided that he needs some space for the time being. My heart aches because of how much love I have for him. I couldn&#39;t get out of bed once I got home. I could barely get myself to eat and drink water. I felt like a failure because I hadn&#39;t missed a single day of this journey, but the last one was finally where I missed it. But this morning my mom has been encouraging me to move, and I decided that I&#39;m going to finish this journey. Today will be far from easy, but I&#39;m grateful for being strong enough to do something for me, just me, even if this is the only thing I can muster on my own all day. I&#39;m so thankful for this community for keeping me motivated the last 30 days, but especially today.

"I can&#39;t believe it 30 days already! What a 30 days has this been! This whole journey to arrive at the end back HOME was filled with gratitude, joy and a special feeling that this is really a journey with myself to I. I turned 40 on day 29 (your lucky number, Adriene!!), and I admit I had intentionally started this journey to somehow &quot;complete&quot; these four decades of life. I think this was one of the best choices ever! I didn&#39;t have too much problem with showing up because after about three days these little sessions became actually addictive! I tried to use our special vocabulary all day long, not just for the practice - and somehow this made me more balanced and calm. Thank you so much Adriene that you were part of this special journey to my special birthday and thank you for teaching me that sometimes it&#39;s just better to do what feels good rather than do what you think you should do...

I felt connected to the community the whole way through, and it really shone in this practice. I was blown away that I could still &quot;hear&quot; you in the silence. The sheer power of your messages has really kindled in my subconscious, as I thought of grounding down through the back body, taking the deepest breath I have all day and of course, only holding on to that which serves. I am not overly emotional, but I really did well up at the end there. Namaste to you, and to everyone I shared this journey with. What a privilege it has been.

"What a perfect end practice to incorporate everything we’ve learnt on this yoga journey together. I can’t tell you how my body has transformed. I feel confident, empowered, strong! And this is a lot coming from a person who at one time felt completely out of control of my own body. It’s true the saying, ‘the best things in life are free’ because yoga is the one of the few things in life that nourishes mind body and soul, it’s magical. You can come back to it any time or anywhere and it’s there, waiting. I can’t thank you enough Adriene for the amount of hours and sheer hard work you put it in each and every day to give us free yoga and your touching emails reminded us to appreciate the little things and beauty that’s everywhere in life. Your support and guidance is what pushes us all to complete each practice. When we feel things are maybe out of our comfort zone, you come in with ‘feel that fire in the belly’ with a smile on your face and we know there’s nothing to be afraid of because ‘we got this.’ You’re an incredible teacher, and someone we love and trust, who wants the best for us. There’s not a materialistic bone in your body and you encourage us all to find happiness in ourselves and practice self love. Thank you once again for this outstanding 30 day yoga. I will continue with the monthly practices with new strength, wisdom and flow. Love to all my fellow yogis, and congratulations for completion!

I&#39;ve never done one of these month long journeys, and never really committed to something like this before, not fully anyway. But I figured, why not? Some mornings I didn&#39;t want to get up, but I did. Other mornings, I was up before my alarm. Some days, I had company next to me on the mat and others it was just me. Some days (especially this week), I came home and turned to another video just to help me decompress from a tough day. But, every day, I did it. I don&#39;t normally post comments, but these 30 days have meant something more to me - they have shown me what I can do and what I want to do - and I couldn&#39;t miss the opportunity to thank you for this video, for this series, and for this opportunity to challenge myself and truly commit to something. Thank you, Adriene, and thank you to all the others practicing along with me - it has truly been an inspiration.",Adrienne Eaton,2020-02-01T12:30:39Z,0
"There&#39;s this Radiohead song called Lift and as I was listening to it today it reminded me of the theme of this year&#39;s practice. Somehow both the meaning of the song and the concepts of the practice merged and let me understand the philosophy of yoga. It was one of those moments that made me go &quot;Ohhhhhh I get it now&quot;.<br /><br />Great song btw, I recommend it.",Tofol Cano,2020-02-01T12:08:22Z,0

"Before I started doing Yoga with Adriene, my balance was so distraught that I couldn&#39;t even think of standing with my feet together. I have bi-lateral acoustic neuromas(brain tumours) which are responsible for loss of balance. A year later, I can stand with my feet together for however long I want, can do high lunges. I couldn&#39;t believe when I actually did the half Moon pose the other day.<br />Adriene, you are healing the world, one person at a time. So much is wrong with the age we live in, yet here you are, guiding us through the impossible. You walked us home, and like a true Guru, today you leave our hands, smiling as we walk the rest of way. So many of us owe our lives to you. May you never have doubt how loved and valued you are. Guru Maa, Jai Namaste 🙏",Ayushi Maheshwari,2020-02-01T11:53:08Z,3

"About 2 weeks before I started this journey HOME I had recently finished your 30 days of Yoga with Adriene programme. That programme was the reason I started and stuck to doing Yoga every day and seeing that another 30 day programme was right around the corner made me so happy. I thank you, Adriene. I thank you for taking your time and putting heart and soul into these yoga practices. Every day I relearned to love myself a little more and be less harsh towards myself. At the beginning of this 30th day practice I sat down on the mat and cried. I couldn&#39;t believe it. In that moment I couldn&#39;t quite believe how quickly those 30 days actually passed by and how I did the daily practice EVERY DAY. But it really scares me how quickly time flies by. It feels like just yesterday I was 12 and this month I&#39;m turning 17. I hope to keep the joys of yoga at my side for years to come. Namaste and thanks Adriene.",Misaki de la Lune,2020-02-01T10:01:40Z,0

I’ve successfully completed Revolution last year. I am just an amateur but it is changing me in so many ways. I tried to keep up this HOME by doing two videos a day if I had to but traveling, stressing and many other excuses prevented me from finishing this.

"Today felt like graduation, and I felt a similar sadness that this beautiful group practice is over, but also just so much gratefulness for this wonderful community and for you Adriene. While I was in the moves I could hear your voice saying &quot;just let it all go&quot;, &quot;move from center, from a place of connection&quot;, &quot;relax your shoulders&quot;, &quot;you got this&quot;, all of your helpful words have become a part of the movement for me and it&#39;s wonderful :) This is my 3rd 30-days with you, and this is the first one that I made it to the mat every single day no matter what, and I really learned this time that it is better to show up even if I&#39;m tired and just breathe if I need to take a break between moves, because taking the time and space to just connect with myself, to let go of all other thoughts and worries and just be completely in the present moment, that that is truly the most important part of all of this for me, and it doesn&#39;t matter if I hit every pose &quot;perfectly&quot;. The peace that I have found on the mat this last month has carried into my life in so many ways, this practice continually brought me back to myself, and nurtured joy and strength within me. I love yoga, and for years have wanted it to become a part of my daily life, but somehow I just never managed to create that space for myself, and your guidance has been immensely helpful in me finally creating that space. Thank you so very much for all that you do, for all of the time and energy that you and your team (and the ever-cute Benji) put into these videos and into your lovely emails, it has all truly made a positive impact on my life &lt;3",Scarlett,2020-02-01T08:57:30Z,0

"After practicing yoga for almost 4 years, this is the first time I did it every day. Today I finished day 30 and I feel so grateful for this experience. It changed both my body and mindset. I even teared up during the end of this video! Also, as a Muslim, yoga makes me more God-conscious and it has a great affect on my soul. I am soon to be married to a Muslim man originally from India and we all know things are not going well there at the moment with their Indian version of Trump. I pray we can all be united by our differences. Thank you again, Adrien. Namaste. Or like the Muslims say; as salamu alaykum (may the peace be with you).

"I just got a sense that Day 30 - Journey, is marking and celebrating the conclusion of a larger journey that I’ve been on for the last 25 years. I feel like the Universe is saying to me, “You have crossed the finish line!” And you, Adriene, have been my gracious escort across, possibly, the last leg of a major journey in my life.<br /><br />What a blessing and a gift the HOME journey has been for me! I know I’m always writing about my spiritual self, but when I looked in the mirror, after practice, I noticed my body was, awake - nice posture, toned stomach, and my face was bright. I definitely want to continue! <br /><br />I feel refreshed. <br /><br />Thank you Adriene, for guiding us home.

There was a time I would have laughed at the thought of doing yoga, period. This month I was not perfect; I fell, I hurt, I griped, I cried.

"I can&#39;t even begin to describe how healing this session was for me. I remained with my breath, in my FULL body throughout the entirety of this video. I got giddy with how many things I knew how to do, and how naturally it came to me as long as I was breathing. In this session I melted away years of self doubt and limiting beliefs that I can&#39;t do anything on my own, or I&#39;m not good enough. In the middle of this session I started rocking some crow pose because I got so excited that my toes left the ground last time. I go in for my second round of toes off the ground, and <b>POP</b> I had a split second of panic before I realized I wasn&#39;t in pain. I had popped a significant portion of a calcium deposit on my left wrist. I mean, this thing was at least an inch round and I thought for sure I would need surgery to come close to fixing this problem. It&#39;s been on my wrist for 7 years now, and has caused me tension all the way up into my shoulders. Seven years. And it popped during my journey home. That&#39;s no coincidence. I&#39;m so humbled, grateful, and in awe right now. The perfect ending to our journey home. Thank you for this practice and thank you for marching alongside all of us.

I did my yoga in the hotel room each night, and when I sat down on my own yoga mat and heard Adriene say that it was time to journey home, I laughed. I had forgotten what the whole journey was about these past couple weeks, just lost in making sure I did each day. But now I feel so fulfilled and renewed. THANK YOU Adriene, and THANK YOU yoga community!

"Adriene, for the 1st time in 6 years I haven&#39;t done our annual January Yoga Challenge, changed countries so now that I&#39;m settled, am going to start in February. You have no idea how much your videos mean to us. Your Yoga for Sciatica helped me a lot last year. I did a 60-day Yoga. That video is very helpful, highly recommended. Thank you for everything, sweet girl.. xx..",Stella Johnson,2020-02-01T06:28:20Z,1
"Deepest gratitude to you, Adriene. These past 30 days have been transformative. This last class ended on my birthday and what a beautiful class it was. I love how you only had the music and we had to believe in ourselves, you and Bennie as a silent guide. My orange tabby cat walked in front of the scene and gave his very best downward dog (hats off to Benjie) It was quite emotional for me. I’ve done lots of yoga the past 20 years but never 30 days in a row. So impactful.  My body and mind feel strong and open. I feel grounded. Downward dog doesn’t hurt so much, I finally did a few push ups again without my right shoulder collapsing. I couldn’t believe it.  <br />My heart feels full and my mind open. <br />Thank you for this beautiful gift you give to so many people. May you be gifted the same love in return threefolds. 💫💗🌈🙏🏼namaste",Sadie Sponsler Clements,2020-02-01T06:28:10Z,0

"Day 30 already?😭 I started crying...realizing how far I’ve come, feeling stronger, and truly full of gratitude. Adriene, you’re a beautiful gift. I so enjoyed these 30 days and became tearful when hearing that signature music that got me on the mat and brought me HOME!! Thank you thank you thank you!!! Ready for another 30 days and more🥰 Bless you and all those out there who showed up on the mat!! 💕",Jessica Ortega,2020-02-01T06:24:26Z,0
"I forgot about the last day’s tradition, and while I felt sad that our Home journey has come to an end, it felt like a badge of honour in a way that I could practice quietly with you. Almost like I’d earned the spot after these 30 days. <br /><br />Once again even though it’s never enough, thank you so so much for this yoga series. I look forward to it every January, and the last two years have had me visiting my father in the hospital at this time for two different operations. This community helped me survive some of my worst days, along with my toughest and most exhaustive nights. I never let a day go by without joining in because I knew that this community was a place to come to when I needed to relax at home.<br /><br />My gratitude is immense and I’m ending today’s practice truly full of love. May 2020 be a brilliant year for all of us! Namaste ❤️",Jennifer Gambacorta,2020-02-01T06:18:37Z,3

"I love how the music would change tempo or instrumentation at a section where Adriene was moving from standing to sitting, from plank to a new position, etc. It made it easy to hear when to wrap up what I was doing and reopen my eyes to peek at what Adriene was doing.

"I had tears in my eyes at the very beginning when you were leading us into day 30, and then again when Benji joined you. I looked over to see one of my sweet pups watching me, and just motioned for him to come to me, and he did! And that beautiful music is amazing! Thank you so much for this 30 day HOME journey Adriene! I actually did it, and it has helped me immensely, giving me more energy, and relieving my asthma symptoms. I can&#39;t even remember the last time I had to use my rescue inhaler! Today&#39;s practice was especially emotional for me, as it was day 30, and today is my sweet youngest son&#39;s 30th birthday! (Why does time go by so quickly??) He is the one who thought I might enjoy YWA, and benefit from it, and I am forever grateful to him for telling me about you, Adriene! Thank you so so much for sharing your encouragement, advice, and love with the world! You are truly amazing! Much love to you and to adorable Benji too!

"January was a month of mental struggle for me, very difficult, Home was the only thing keeping me from losing it completely. Last practice of this journey happened just after the main problem was solved at the cost of a sleepless night and right before I have to go catch my flight that will take me to my first solo travel. I feel the strength and magic within me and I know that everything is going to be great because I choose so.

"Thank you so much, Adriene. ❤️ This journey has helped me connect to my body in ways I don’t think I ever have. My body &amp; my mind are my home, no matter I go in life, and it’s been so amazing realizing what that means to me. <br /><br />I am strong, capable, &amp; worthy, even when it doesn’t seem like it. I showed up even when I thought I wouldn’t. I found myself deeply appreciating my body when I’ve spent half my life resenting &amp; hiding it. I found an inner strength and balance I didn’t know I still had. I came to the mat with anxiety, happiness, exhaustion, irritation, sadness, and always left it feeling stronger. Like for a moment, with my body &amp; breath connected, I was in control. I could go on, but the gist is — THANK YOU. ❤️ Looking forward to continuing this journey in Feb!",Michelle,2020-02-01T05:46:57Z,0
Thanks. It is my second year  doing the 30 day challenge. I am 80 pounds lighter and much healthier. Not bad for a 65 yr old. I appreciate all you do and the great community that is yoga with adrien. I find all of you just incredible.  Thank you all!,badhabit13010,2020-02-01T05:46:38Z,0
"I live in a motorhome (bus).  We travel from Ontario, where we live in the summer to Nanaimo, BC, where we stay in the winter.  I joined the gym last year when we were here, to stay in shape and weight train to keep myself strong for our handicapped 66 pound dog who we have to lift in and out of our motorhome.  Last summer, we spent so much money on having some of her bad teeth removed and so many other things that in our budget, (we are retired) I couldn&#39;t justify spending the money to rejoin the gym.  It rains here, a lot.  I saw a pop up shed on sale here recently, made of tarp material and steel poles that I asked my husband to buy me as an early birthday gift.  My birthday is in July.  I popped it up beside the bus, lined the floor with a tarp, put some jigsaw mats in it and voila.... Yoga hut!  Every day I&#39;ve been going out to the little She Shed and doing 2 sets of 10 pound dumbell lifts, 2 sets of 50 squats, a plank that I increase every day by one second (I&#39;m up to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VSqbSCcvuU&amp;t=2m17s"">2:17</a>) with your January daily yoga session in the middle.  It&#39;s me time, it&#39;s glorious and I&#39;m proud to have done it every day except for two snow days.  Thank you so much for all you do here.  You and Benji and that lovely calming voice, with the twinge of humour and the creak in the floor.  I&#39;ve loved every second.  Namaste! 🧘",Sue Davis,2020-02-01T05:45:59Z,0
"This is the first time I&#39;ve actually completed a 30 day challenge and I feel so incredibly amazing! In the beginning it was also hard to find stillness and I had such a hard time slowing down, truly feeling the sensations of each movement..I had definitely been just going through the positions. THANK YOU for teaching me to slow down, to find what feels good, and to always make that journey back home! 💜💜",breejeanne,2020-02-01T05:44:22Z,0
I left my beautiful home country of Brazil when I was 18. Since then I travelled very much but it was not until I had my children that  felt homeless. <br />The need of providing then grounding took me on a journey where my heart become my Home. It’s no need to wave a flag anymore. I live on planet Earth and wherever I am with my family it’s exactly where I belong. I am HOME and so are they.<br />Beutifull start of the year!<br />I am so gratfull for what you do and all that people around the globe that took this journey with me.<br />Much Love!

"This was the best way of ending this ride Home. I struggle with inconstancy so much, that this 30 day experience was in the beginning a way of proving myself that I could finish something. But little did I know that this would not become into another to-do list, but into a new way of living, a new way of exploring myself and my body. Every day I noticed an improvement and discovered new things (at the beginning I couldn&#39;t even do downward facing dog properly, or reach the ground without bending my knees a lot in forward fold). Today I let myself explore and do quite a lot of &quot;freestyle&quot;, and it felt so amazing and liberating. As you say &quot;trust me, trust yourself, trust the practice&quot;. So much internal grow for me in only 30 days.<br />I cannot thank you enough for this. Thank you Adriene, namaste. 🌸",Luced,2020-02-01T05:38:07Z,0
"Dearest Adriene,<br />Even after four years of your challenge, I still get tearful on the last day.  It’s like saying goodbye to a friend .  A friend who has your back.😇🥰<br />I am in awe at what amazing souls you and Benji are.  Giving the gift of yoga for free to millions.  It’s refreshing to know people like you are here.  You are changing the world.  Exposing people to this wonderful and nurturing self practice.  I think your my modern day hero.🦸‍♀️ <br /><br />In thirty days I’ve seen my body morph into a well oiled machine.  The improvements in postures, poses and mental health are impressive.  <br /><br />I hope to catch you this year when you come to Red Rocks.  You and Benji have gotten me through deaths, break ups, loss of dogs, births, changes good and bad.  Namaste 🙏",jessica sandborn,2020-02-01T05:37:59Z,0
"Redemptive. It’s the only word I can think of right now, what this practice has meant to me. Day 30/31. I’ve made it. I’ve <b>done</b> it! Gone are the days where I call myself a quitter and believe it. I’m not a quitter. I did it. By myself. I finally attempted, trusted, crow pose. I’ve never given it my all before- because I told myself I’d fail before I even tried. How often do I do that in life? Probably too often. <br />I showed up. I journeyed. I ~trusted~. I slow danced with myself and cried; knowing I have my back now, just like I did then. Through it all, I’ve been here for me. Home.",Alyssa,2020-02-01T05:35:10Z,0
"Thank you so much, Adriene for sharing this journey. During today&#39;s practice, I accidentally exhaled and spooked my cat by blowing air into her but hole.  On a more serious note, I wasn&#39;t sure if I wanted to go all in and commit to 30 days but I just went for it and tried not to overthink it. I am so glad I did, I felt great starting off the spring semester of college having this accomplishment to be proud of.",Alanah Cunningham,2020-02-01T05:33:13Z,0

I didn&#39;t care that it was the last day(not anyones fault, just not sleeping enough recently). I also didn&#39;t feel creative.

I couldn’t find my own voice and couldn’t hear yours.  I held my breath throughout the whole practice and constantly reminded myself to breathe. I was not expecting to fee l on my own.

I did not feel my best during this practice - but it didn&#39;t matter. It didn&#39;t matter that I was bloated and tired and stressed. It didn&#39;t matter that I often followed along with you Adriene instead of doing my own thing. All that mattered was I showed up for the journey.

At the end of the 30 days, I am finding it easier to forgive myself for a multitude of things. That is huge for me because I&#39;m a perfectionist to the point of it being unhealthy.

"This has been such a wonderful journey. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever practiced anything 30 consecutive days before, but here we are. I don&#39;t know where to begin to explain how impactful this has been or how it has shifted my mindset, but maybe I can summarize it by saying that during this practice I did my own thing and when I was stuck I didn&#39;t stop, but instead asked myself &quot;Where can I go from here?&quot; and then I listened to what my intuition told me. I found myself in a pose I had never tried or even thought of before! In tree pose I opened my arms to my sides and tried a spinal twist. I fell on one side, but held it on the other. Thank you for this program, Adriene! I know the 30 days are over, but I&#39;m sure I will see you again tomorrow. Much love from snowy Minnesota.",Maren Friemann,2020-02-01T04:37:59Z,0

I finished it! I completed it! And I did not miss a day. Looking at my growth is amazing as always. To see my growth is a priceless treasure. I am beyond grateful for you and all you have done for my little world. If you see this please know that you have changed the world of a small town girl in Michigan.

"i had to take a break part way through because I was so hot. BUT. I did it! I&#39;ve attempted this 30 day thing for the last 3 or 4 years, but this was the first time I made it all the way through!",brittsco13,2020-02-01T04:21:51Z,0
"Long comment alert!!<br />This was really emotional for me. Particularly hearing the music that served as the themes for the previous years of the 30 Days of Yoga. It really struck me - more than usual - how long I&#39;ve been practicing with you as a guide, Adriene. It may sound silly, but you are someone I &quot;see&quot; every day, and I appreciate that time so much. And it must be an exhausting endeavor to be the person that literally millions of people see every day. This series especially was a reminder of that, and I can&#39;t express my gratitude enough for the work that you have done and continue to do. Your guidance has strengthened my practice in ways I couldn&#39;t have imagined when I started practicing almost twelve years ago. May all the energy and love that you&#39;ve given return back to you a thousand-fold!<br />Namaste, everyone - we did it!💙",Emily Benoit,2020-02-01T04:18:28Z,149
"Beautiful sentiment and I agree! There&#39;s something about that Yoga Revolution music especially that feels very emotional to me. I so appreciate this channel as a safe, supportive place to come to anytime. As Adriene says, she, and yoga, have our backs &lt;3",Lucie,2020-02-08T18:14:14Z,1

"My cat, Marmalade, was fixated on  Benji today. First time he&#39;s ever noticed him and while he was rather uneasy for some of the practice I loved day 30 the most. And from the comments I see I was not the only emotional person 😘. I committed myself mentally to this sometime early December. And even though I experienced an autoimmune flare up just after Christmas I started up Day 1 as planned. When I flare my feet, legs and back have strange sensory issues and the last thing I want to do if feel my body. BUT I stuck it out, breathed through it and had the quickest recovery yet with almost no anxiety about it. Ahhhh. Felt like sharing that. Thank you.🧘‍♀️",Rebecca McCready,2020-02-01T04:14:32Z,0

"My goodness...I cannot believe I made it through these 30 days.  And because you made this feel like such precious and important time for ourselves, I only looked forward to each day.  I have to be honest, I did not feel very open minded when I read what we were going to do for this last day, but I happily surprised myself with how much I could move through the asanas with ease and confidence.  Definitely some room for improvement, it wasn&#39;t always graceful, but you accept what &quot;is&quot; and keep moving.  Thank you for opening my mind and my heart to what yoga is.  I&#39;m a bit emotional on this last day as it&#39;s been what I looked forward to each day.  I hope to keep joining you on more of this journey and better my practice as time goes.  Thank you, thank you!  Bless you for being such an inspiration and really showing you care about all of us that watch you from our home studios.

"I don’t know about this one.  I loved it and at the same time I kind of missed your voice.  During my usual practices I have grown accustomed to closing my eyes and to being in the moment, listening to your voice. Today,  silence had me looking at the screen... was not totally able to settle. I missed you Adriene and totally sad that this was the last of the 30 days.  Went by so fast.  Tomorrow I shall start another... with your voice so <br />i can yet again close my eyes. 😘",Ronda D'Oliveira,2020-02-01T03:58:37Z,0

"Thank you, Adriene, for a beautiful beginning to 2020. We will be leaving Austin, TX (home for 26 years!) later this year for my hometown in IL to help my sister with our aging parents. It is truly a year to journey home. I have started your 30 day journey twice, and twice, life got in my way and I didn&#39;t finish. How fitting that the year I committed to going to my childhood home to find your 30 day yoga journey HOME. I don&#39;t believe in coincidence, but I DO believe in serendipity. This was serendipitous. I will continue along with you as often as I am able, and as I travel from one home to the other. Namaste.",Adrea Craft,2020-02-01T03:53:01Z,0
"I got discouraged at first because usually with the last day and the mic off I have a hard time following and panic too much to keep up. I didn&#39;t do anything too out of the ordinary this time, my joints are all over the place in stability anyway. But I did the flow for once, and managed to cry out some excess energy built up. I haven&#39;t cried for a long time, so.....guess that was needed. Thank you for this practice, like always.",Noma Fox,2020-02-01T03:52:56Z,0

"Great gratitude and abundant thanks to Adrienne and crew and Benji for all the time and effort to bring this Home program to us. I&#39;m really going to miss the daily sessions w/ Adrienne here, and all together.  I&#39;ve done the January 30 day challenges for 3 years now and it&#39;s a wonderful way to start the year.  But I&#39;m not crying or emotional- I have to say the silent thing doesn&#39;t work for me as well- it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t trust myself or my body it&#39;s because I can&#39;t remember what is next, or when to inhale or exhale, or what to pay attention to in each pose, and you&#39;d think I would remember, but I don&#39;t, so I like to be reminded- my brain was working harder w/ the silent thing- and then the &quot;go slow&quot; but I&#39;m slower at times than Adrienne was or faster, or distracted by trying to look at the screen to see what&#39;s next, and I totally miss the verbal cues and Adrienne&#39;s silliness too. Well anyway- just my outlier opinion here...  The main thing is that I&#39;m really grateful and appreciate this series and Adrienne and thank you thank you.",j miller,2020-02-01T03:06:58Z,0

"30 consecutive days of Yoga completed. I&#39;m proud of everyone who stuck with this. <br />I missed Adriene&#39;s comforting voice, but it was interesting to see what I was able to do on my own. It was not perfect. I may just be having an off day; or maybe the independence of the practice scared me; or maybe the marinara sauce from dinner is making me feel sick. I struggled more than I wish I had. <br />This made me doubt myself, but then I remember how difficult the first day was. The way my forearms shook and the sweat that coated my body. I also remember how proud I was that I did a whole 40 mins of yoga, and how excited I was to start this journey.<br /><br /><br />And I now realize that the journey Home has only just begun. I&#39;ve gotten my feet wet; I&#39;m slowly making my way into the water. This journey has been so eye opening. I&#39;ve learned how much strength I actually hold. I&#39;ve been more loving and accepting to myself. I&#39;ve found a new nightly tradition to that helps me got to sleep; sometimes the yoga makes me feel better than I do all day long. I&#39;ve grown a better understanding and appreciation for yoga. <br />Thank you a thousand times over, Adriene, for your guidance and acceptance throughout this process. I am eternally grateful and excited to further my yoga experience with you. &lt;3",Maggie Woolford,2020-02-01T03:01:44Z,0

Wow this practice was amazing. I thought that I wouldn’t be able to do today’s practice without you to guide me but boy was I wrong! I surprised myself in how much I learned and remembered from the last thirty days and with he fact that I went the whole forty minutes without feeling like I need to take a break for mental or physical reasons. This whole month has been one beautiful practice after the next. I hope in the months to come I can continue on my journey on and off the mat. This month I was able to do my first (and second and third) crow pose which felt amazing! I thought I would never be able to do it because I have so little upper body strength but I proved myself wrong and now I feel like I can (and will) do more and more balance poses in the future.

"I&#39;ll be honest, I started out good and trusted my intuition for the first half of the pratice but got in my head for the second half and barely had any synchronised movement but towards the end, I stopped and just stayed in extended child&#39;s pose for a while. It&#39;s really hard to trust my instincts but we&#39;ll get there eventually. I definitely shed some tears towards the end there because I can&#39;t believe I made it through all 30 days. Absolutely grateful to you Adriene for all you put into this and everyone else for showing up for ourselves ❤️",سمية عمر,2020-02-01T02:22:46Z,0

"Very nice.  Yoga without a net.  I found myself focusing on the insides of me - a radical feeling.  I worried about &quot;what&#39;s next&quot; but at a certain point, that felt OK too.  I feel like this when I sing without a score - trusting myself to riff through the parts that may not be exactly picky-picky right, and coming out the other side with a sense of self and calm and knowing that this is so right and good.  Thank you.",Christine Moon,2020-02-01T02:16:14Z,1

"Writing that comment on the surge of sudden inspiration during the last 10 minutes of Day 30, Journey, as I realized, this is my yoga. Home changed my life. When I started 30 days ago, I was depressed and battling the existential crisis. Nothing helped me, you name it - movement, books, spiritual tools, meditation, even sun, and healthy food. Through this process, I realized why it was like that. &quot;I&quot; was not there, I was not committed to healing at all, cause I had no idea who this &quot;I&quot; was. I loved the dark as it was comfortable, paradoxically warm, safe. And then I committed and fully surrendered to my own healing. And MAGIC happened. 30 days later and here I am, suddenly enjoying life and light again. All of a sudden I decluttered my whole apartment, bought a lot of houseplants and started creating my own urban jungle. And please mind this, I was not interested in plants al all my life. I do not know what exactly happened and I have no words. Dear Adriene and every each and one of you, I love you for being my humble guides home. Thank you, I am forever grateful. Namaste.",smokymoon,2020-02-01T02:14:37Z,0

"This is maybe my third attempt at the 30 days of yoga journey with Adriene. Last year I got sick halfway through and had to stop, though I did pick it back up later, just not consecutively. This year I was sick at the beginning, but I was still able to start. I am so happy that I can say I DID IT. I showed up for myself all 30 days. No matter what time it was, no matter what else I had left to do, no matter what roadblocks stood in my way, I made time for me day after day. <br /><br />Thank you Adriene for this wonderful guided journey you created. I am planning on going for my YTT in March, and I feel like this journey was the perfect way to start a new year with such an exciting venture up ahead. I plan on continuing with a daily practice and even trusting myself to be my own guide on the mat. I&#39;m happy to say I am home.

"Oh Adriene, we as a couple (my husband and I) have done this HOME journey together, and just finished this morning (Phuket, Thailand). We have attempted two other 30 day journeys, but didn&#39;t miss a day and have held on to the 30 days in sequence from the start, amongst so many possible (and valid excuses), we made it work. This video had us both in tears; a release and also tears of immense gratitude for such a truly special experience. We started yoga via your YouTube videos one year ago, as complete beginners. We are so proud we could stick to this journey, and can&#39;t thank you enough. We are so grateful for this experience. You truly are a guide, a light and very special to us. We could go on and on ad nauseam. So, thank you from the fullness of our heart! Namaste, and love to you and your team.  - Justine &amp; Justin",Justine & Justin,2020-02-01T01:50:40Z,0

Wondering how I was going to conjure up the mental tenacity and physical energy. Not a few minutes in, I felt a spark. A few more minutes, brighter spark. Then full on, blossoming JOY. Actual joy in movement. In enjoying the sensations, feeling grateful for what I’ve learned. Reveling in things that were once “hard” that now are an “edge.” I actually think I did more than when cued because I was just truly enjoying the experience of being in my body.

But throughout these last 30 days I&#39;ve developed a new appreciation for silence and this guided meditation she brings to the table. I&#39;ve opened my brain to the possibilities and the joy that yoga can bring someone. Needless to say, within the first 30 seconds of starting todays practice I was in tears. This truly was a journey home and I know that I&#39;ve grown more than I thought possible this past month.

Coming to the end is always so bittersweet because it is a huge sense of accomplishment and I am so much stronger and more capable than I was on day 1 but at the same time not wanting it to end.

"Omg. Wow. This was absolutely magical! I have never ever done a yoga practice without verbal guidance, so I was a little nervous at the start. But then I got going and I found my flow, I peeked at Adriene every now and then when I struggled to think of what to do next, and then I found my inspiration to carry on. I was hit at the end with emotion that made my eyes well up because I&#39;d just done a shoulder stand, rolled down to sit up cross legged and I was faced with Adriene sitting cross legged too, bringing her hands up to her forehead and bowing her head just as I was coming to do the same, like the timing was perfect and the 40 mins were over without me even realising... This was the most amazing experience. Thank you so much! ♥️",Emily,2020-02-01T00:37:36Z,2

"I can’t believe I actually did it this year! 30 days of yoga without missing a practice! I don’t think I’ve done anything consistently for 30 days. Thank you for helping me prioritize myself a little bit every day. I want to make yoga part of my everyday routine. I’ll be going through your old 30-day sessions as a guide :)<br />Also, though this journey, I’ve discovered I can do a shoulder stand, which is something I would have never thought possible! I love building strength, balance, and flexibility all while focusing on breathing and being present in the moment. I feel like I have grown stronger both physically and mentally thanks to your guidance.",UkuleleLauren,2020-02-01T00:36:21Z,0

Tears of gratitude and appreciation. Thank you Adriene! The past 30 days of HOME has changed my life in so many ways. This wasn’t like me to commit to something like this but I felt in my gut it was for me.

"I&#39;ve been saving my comment until I completed all thirty days. I have started and failed to finish three of your past 30 day challenges Adriene and this year I decided, and worked hard to make sure that did not happen. I&#39;ve gotten up earlier; I&#39;ve been late for work; I&#39;ve done yoga with my nephew crawling into my lap and between my legs in down dog 😅; I&#39;ve done it in the evening if I woke up too late. I printed the calendar and everyday I did a little celebration dance as I filled in the day with a pattern to mark it as complete. <br /><br />Over the past month, yoga has  been a calming space, a catalyst for change, a push to get started and a challenge. I&#39;ve had so many emotions over the course of this journey from clearing my head of anything that is bothering me to allowing myself to think through things I&#39;ve have been putting off. I appreciate your channel so much and today after thirty days of doing yoga consistently, it was so reassuring to peek up and see that I was in Warrior 2 with you. I crafted the first thirty minutes on my own but followed along for the last ten. I made sure to work in a power pose and a goddess pose because honestly, that&#39;s how I feel after completing this challenge 👸🏾🦸🏾‍♀️<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23superpowerfulgoddessyogi"">#superpowerfulgoddessyogi</a>. <br /><br />To a daily practice on the mat, cheers everyone!

"Thank you for this experience Adriene, Benji, the crew, &amp; the viewers here on YT. This was the first time I had ever done a yoga challenge &amp; the first time I had been consistent with my yoga practice. These 30 days have really helped me to learn and trust myself. I felt so out of tune with my body and my mind last year, but now I feel myself healing.<br />Today&#39;s practice kind of scared me when I looked at it this morning, but once I stepped on the mat everything flowed. I&#39;ve learned so much and I look forward to continuing this journey Home. Thank you again Adriene for bringing so much light to the start of this new decade.

I knew not what I would find in these last 30 days, but I feel as though I found what I was looking for. <br />Multiple times through this last practice, I found myself offering kindness to myself, something that I have been witholding from for awhile, and I wanted to thank you, truly, for helping open that path once again. <br /><br />As I said to myself after, I say to you here: May you be well, May you be happy, and may you be loved. <br />With love and kindness, Nathan Gilles From Missouri. &lt;3<br />Namaste, Adriene.",Nathan Gilles,2020-02-01T00:09:49Z,0
"I am gonna sound like such a cheesy hippie tree hugging human when I say this but... wow. That was so fucking magical. Music is so emotive! As soon as it started playing and I was moving to it, I went into child&#39;s pose and just cried a little bit. Thought of how far I&#39;ve come etc. It just felt so incredible to practise everything we&#39;ve learnt to music like that. It felt like I was dreaming or on drugs or something. Adriene, I can&#39;t thank you (and your team!) enough for how much time, effort, energy and love you&#39;ve put into this. I am so grateful. You&#39;ve already single-handedly changed my 2020.

"Hi Adriene! Hi everybody! <br /><br /> I&#39;ve been struggling with anorexia for quite some time now. Last year, I embarked on this 30 days yoga journey and managed to keep up with yoga for half a year before I had to focus on intense recovery from my mental illness. I spend the last six months of 2019 eating well and not moving any muscle, for fear that exercise will trigger weight loss thoughts. I ended that year with a body that was stronger and healthier, but with mind that was torn between further recovery and self hatred. <br /><br />This year I embarked on this journey once more. Excercise is still scary, especially the community associated with it, but yoga with you is like a warm, safe space. As you say we don&#39;t do yoga, we practice it. There are no goals, only intentions. Every time I step on my mat, my intention is to be happy and hopeful again. Today at the end of the practice I thought, maybe for the first time in years, that I&#39;m grateful for my body that is capable and strong and can move and do such amazing things. It was a revolutionary thought to say the least! <br /><br />I hope yoga with you will remain a big part of a happy, hopeful life ahead of me. I&#39;m truly thankful for you, more thankful than I can say. The feeling of self acceptance I felt today was one of the most beautiful moments in my life.",Olga Oliwia Kortas,2020-01-31T23:45:59Z,0

"I can&#39;t believe we did it!<br />I finished at exactly midnight (10 minutes ago) i&#39;m from algeria.<br />I ve never been able to finish a yoga journey before, being stuck in my mental illness but this journey made me realise that depression wasnt  who i was, before that there was this strong and dreamer girl who wanted to be the best version of herself. And through this journey i decided to bring her back home. And i&#39;m back now, determined to get better and make the most of everything in life. I can&#39;t stop crying since i finished ...<br />I was scared to go in without the instructions ... i fell few time and had to go backward in the video 3 times ... it wasnt perfect but i went through it and it was mine.<br />I can&#39;t believe i achieved this, Adriene i will never thank you enough for what you gave me and i want to commit to that. I deserve to feel good and i owe it to myself. <br /><br />Thank you so much ... I love you :&#39;) ❤",Tchina Mameri,2020-01-31T23:13:47Z,0
"This was simply wonderful! Although one thing I noticed around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VSqbSCcvuU&amp;t=37m00s"">37:00</a> Benji was limping? It looked like his right leg was bothering him, had he just gotten up from laying on that side? Just wanted to point that out to make sure he’s doing alright. Had so much fun on this yoga journey with all of you :)",Mystic Spirit,2020-01-31T23:13:20Z,0
"Adriene, thank you for this incredible journey. And what a perfect ending. The music could not have been more beautiful, and I felt myself taking turns from using you as my guide but then trusting my own intuition and allowing my body, mind and soul to work together on their own. This has been such an amazing 30 days, and I&#39;m truly sad that it&#39;s over. Thank you for all of your love, light, humor and wisdom that you put into this series. You are truly making a difference in this world. With love &amp; light to you and to this entire community, Namaste &lt;3",Katie Day,2020-01-31T23:12:17Z,0

"I can&#39;t believe i made it, 30 day yoga challenge! This sure was the best way to kick this year off. I&#39;ve had so much fun and i&#39;ve got the oppurtunity to explore and get to know myself better. I usually practised yoga only when i had a really tough time and it sure helped, but now i feel empowered to practise yoga more often, as a way to reward myself both in good and bad. Thank you for sharing this experience with me Adriene, thanks for making all this possible. Altough this practise was non guided, I could still hear your voice in my head telling me to breathe in and out and taking things slowly. Big up to everyone who has been here since this beautiful joruney started, it&#39;s not always easy to fulfill a challenge especially if it&#39;s an everydat challenge, I believe this is the first time i&#39;ve stayed true to myself and completed a challenge that i do find joy and peace in. Once again, a huge thanks to you Adriene, lots of love from Sweden, see you and Benji soon &lt;3",Linda Leith,2020-01-31T23:10:04Z,0

Not gonna lie my anxiety kicked in when you said you’d be taking off your mic. I was like what am I going to do without narration? Coming up with my own routine...yeah not quite there yet so I definitely followed along with what Adriene was doing and it wasn’t as hard as I thought it would be without narration. I actually enjoyed it more without the narration! I have loved every moment of this journey and I honestly can’t believe I didn’t jump on the yoga train sooner.

"As one of many: Thank You, Adriene! <br />Thank You for guiding me home, a place that i always carry in me. All your guidance was in my head,  lifted me up and suddenly felt like my own voice inside to find what feels good - and damn,  i feel good right now. Maybe the hardest practice in all of the 30 days,  but you make it come so easily.

"30 days of yoga, in the bag.<br />I breathe in liquid sunshine and refresh as I look outside at the rain pouring over the trees from the cloud-filled sky and I smile, in tree pose. I realize that I can hear Adriene&#39;s voice in my head as I do my own practice, but now, after my third(?) new year with Adriene, I can also hear mine. Perhaps I truly have been guided home. <br />I did this journey everyday, even in the last week when I got the flu (thank goodness for my flu shot). And today, I think I&#39;ve finally turned the corner to recovery, so fitting for the last day of our Home yoga journey. <br />Thank you Adriene, thank you to the person who wrote the article that brought me to Adriene, and thank you to my inner self for being open to finding someone and something to help me find peace and contentment.

It&#39;s serenity, gratitude, homesickness, joy, pride all mixed together, it&#39;s amazing how a month can change you (in a good way) Even if it&#39;s really hard most of the times,I&#39;ll try to cherish and take care of myself this year. Thank you for this wonderful journey,I&#39;ll continue with the first 5 days I&#39;ve missed and probably with the playlist of February. Wish you all the very best Adriene.

"Sorry, did not enjoy it. Had to always keep an eye on the screen because the music gave hardly ever a clue on when to change or move on from a resting position. It was too fast for me - not time to settle and breath into a form, often jostled to keep up. Stopped after about 30 minutes and started to do my own thing. I&#39;m a beginner and enjoyed most of the 30 sessions, but doubting the whole thing now because that might just not be my style of Yoga at all if this is what we were aiming for. Might need find a Yoga instructor that suites my skill and pace better. Heard Yin yoga was more slow, so I might try that. Thank you though, I feel I learned quite a bit, and it got me interested in Yoga again. Cheers",Helen Egan,2020-01-31T22:46:46Z,0

I found myself crying during the series, not one time and it was from pure emotion, realizing what is love for me and how I can be better for everyone around me.

My surgery was yesterday and I completed day 29 right before leaving for the procedure. Now, on day 30, I am back home and resting. I watched this video from my recliner, and although I can&#39;t move much, I practiced breathing where I normally would breathe throughout this practice. It has been such a lesson in letting go, and returning to the breath. Thank you Adriene for all that you do for the community.

"Hi, first time in the comment section :) I first came across this when someone shared it in a discord server I am in. At first I was sceptical to it, like &quot;me, do yoga? naaah&quot; but I decided to give it a chance. was still a bit sceptical in the beginning but stuck through it, even if I looked completely ridicilous :D And this 30 day journey has been the most special thing to me so far in 2020. Every day after finishing, I have always felt at peace and genuinely happy, which is a rare thing. It&#39;s as if every bad depressive thoughts, any worries, everything just dissappeared for a good while. Also knowing that everyday that you, Benji and everyone else out there was here doing the same thing, it was reassuring in a way. I teared up a few time while writing this, there where both sad and happy tears. This has been the most amazing journey I have ever had, it showed me that change is possible, and what we all have within is very special and stronger than we think, and that it is just as or more important than what is on the outside. I am for sure gonna continue with yoga after this :D So, thank you Adriene, Benji, behind the scene people, everyone else here for this very special experience, for showing me that all needed to change is within oneself. And I hope you all continue to have a blessed and beautiful 2020, I&#39;m sending all the love from Norway &lt;3 Namaste",CyberDalek,2020-01-31T22:25:41Z,0

During these 30 days my journey physically took me from Brazil to South Wales and then to Yorkshire. It&#39;s been so stressful and exhausting but at the end of these 30 days you&#39;ve reminded me that home is me and wherever I go I&#39;ll always be able to build that for myself.

"I was nursing a hangover today, it got to 10 pm and I still hadn&#39;t rolled out the mat. I prepared for bed and then a little voice nudged me to roll it out anyway. So I had my own restorative low to the ground practice, completely different from what I saw you, dear Adriene, do next to me. It felt nice and also a bit confusing and new. A special experience, which I will definitely come back to do in the AM with more energy and a more focused mind.

Wow what a journey! Thank you. First time I have ever done anything like this and found myself looking forward to each days practice. Excellent way to let go of the days stress and focus on being present. The final practice was difficult for me as I very very very much missed the verbal cues and thus spent a large amount of my time catching up and/or head cranked to the screen. Overall is was a fabulous learning about me and my body experience.,Marley Marshall,2020-01-31T21:41:21Z,0

When I started this on day 1 I couldn&#39;t articulate why I wanted to do this and what I wanted to get out of it. If pressed I could come up with some ideas of strength and flexibility and some time to focus on myself. And I got all that but so much more. I think my intuition from the start told me that I needed this kind of trust and acceptness of my body. I still can&#39;t put exactly into words how I feel right now. I&#39;m very grateful and thank you all for the experience. I will definitely continue doing yoga regularly to get even more benefits from the practices.,Diane _Princess,2020-01-31T21:32:08Z,0

There was something special about this 30 day journey that was different from the others. I saw more progress in myself, physically and emotionally, in these past 30 days than I had in all of 2019.

"I have to admit in all honesty, I really struggle without your voice as guidance. I don&#39;t really trust myself. I find myself forgetting to breathe correctly or at all! I often do my yoga with my eyes closed and your voice guides me through the movements and reminds me to hold, breathe and support. I need to learn to trust myself but following a guide is what works best for me. to do my own thing I need to not be feeling like I need to keep up with a video. All with love. Finding what works for me and what doesn&#39;t.",Penny Agius,2020-01-31T21:23:18Z,0

Got a little emotional on this last day of HOME Adriene... I stuck with it every single day and I can’t thank you enough. I went to the doctor this morning to go over some blood work and she is aware the 30 day challenge I’ve been doing all through this month and she said she wants me to continue with yoga everyday. I’m hooked thanks to you. 💛💛💛,woodsandtea,2020-01-31T21:21:35Z,0

On the other hand however, I’m sad it’s over. I could very happily make this day 30 of 100!! Not gonna lie, I shed a tear Haha. Thank you so much for taking the time for us to learn with you.

I have big questions I have yet to answer and it&#39;s making me nervous, it&#39;s making me cry all the time, but yoga gives me courage, yoga gives me strength, yoga gives me peace I have yet to find in my life.

"There is a magic to day 30 practices, finding those moments where things just FLOW and your mind body and spirit just connect! I had a moment of euphoria after working in goddess pose for longer than I usually do, as I usually tap out a bit early, and wow! I was laughing and feeling giddy, so knocking on heaven’s door was the only way to deal with that! I love that we have these amazing tools, thank you so much Adriene!

For 30 days. And I loved every step of it.<br />When I saw that today was a 40-minute freestyle practice, I was worried that I didn&#39;t have the proper tools. Yet I did it!

"This was simultaneously my easiest and hardest practice! I was absolutely terrified when you said you were turning off the mic for this one - the thought of guiding myself through a 40 minute practice was daunting! But as others have mentioned, I could hear you in my head the whole time, a quiet voice of encouragement, &quot;you&#39;ve got this&quot;. And you were right, I do have the vocabulary, I do have the tools and it ended up being a magical and powerful powerful experience.

"Thank you Adriene. Last year I tried to do the 30 day journey in the begining of January. 3 times. And always when I arrived at day 8, everything in my life started going crazy, and eventually I had to stop. So, last year I gave up. This time around everything Was going perfectly fine... Until sunday!!! I caught up a respiratory infection, and had 40•C of fever for 3 days. Had to go to the hospital and everything. My first impulse was giving up again. And it made me sad. So... on wednesday, thursday and today, I did two days in each ( one in the morning, and another in the evening) and I FEEL GREAT, because that way I could come HOME with all of you. And most important of all: I chose NOT to quit. <br />Sometimes life throws curve balls at us... And we either quit... Or get creative😉<br />Thank you very much to all of you who came on this journey.<br />Kisses from Portugal 🇵🇹 <br />See you soon",Catarina Henriques,2020-01-31T21:02:11Z,0

"Took me time today to process my feelings. I was very hesitant about doing the practice without verbal cues and for 40 minutes, but did find that the time flew by and at times I pretty much was able to keep up with the flow. I&#39;m not yet practiced enough to make up my own moves so I did sometimes have to hurry to catch up or stopped short at others. So overall, not very smooth. Somehow, I feel I&#39;m not Home, but just Starting Out as I understood whilst doing the 30 days that this is to be a life-long, daily, practice. I&#39;ve barely stepped outside the front door!

"OMG I just can’t! Literally bawling by the end. I have never cried through forearm planks and yet...there I was. This has been an emotional journey for sure, but this practice in particular has brought it all home for me (pardon the pun). The courage, the camaraderie of everyone here, and how far we’ve all come on our journey home. By the end credits I felt like my spirit had valiantly battled the deepest darkest demons and was striding through the field, returning home to confidence, comfort in my own skin, and a more optimal version of myself. Thank you so much for this. What a blessing. I’m so moved. <br /><br />Also, I NEED the music from this session. Especially the Home theme song, it’s so SO powerful.",Taylor Parris,2020-01-31T20:58:37Z,1

"Me talking to the screen; You bring those hip-dips, girlie! I got this. I am strong!! 💪🏼 I held it together just fine, right up until the fetal position and then the water works started. Tissues were at the ready! I loved that you managed to sneak in a &quot;knocking on heavens door&quot; too. Brilliant!!  Sweet Benji was really feeling the lovely vibes, wasn&#39;t he? My cat was equally drawn to the positive, emotional energy. It&#39;s absolutely magical how you touch so many lives with movement and breath, all without needing to say a word. That&#39;s powerful.

"Wow. What an incredible 30 days it has been, I&#39;ve had some intense experiences throughout this series and I&#39;m not exageratting when i say that i have experienced tremendous therapeutic and spiritual growth.<br /><br />My body, my mind and my soul have all benefited from this prwctice. I came here searching for something, and throughout this journey I realised what I was looking for was myself. <br /><br />However towards the end I discovered that I wouldn&#39;t find what i seek here, today I was proven wrong. I found it, I found Home. I found myself. I dug deep, so very deep in this silent practice that I finally found the childhood trauma that was blocking me from becoming who I truly am. The source that started this cycle of fear and desire to be accepted by others, and to conform. Now I feel free, and I have you Adrienne, mg dear teacher, to thank for it. And of course i should thank myself, for doing all of this, I love everyone here.<br /><br />I was left at the end with this message from within. &quot;now offer your gift(love) throughout the universe without shame.&quot;",Rrr21,2020-01-31T20:53:32Z,0

"Adrienne,<br /><br />One month ago I started this journey not knowing if I would show up everyday.  But I did for all of it. Each day I would surprise myself  because for such a long time I didn&#39;t want to move.  Was afraid to move because of depression and anxiety.  Five years of it.  So to be able to complete HOME is huge for me.  Today  I have a sense of pride and accplishment that I haven&#39;t felt in years.  I DID IT!   Yes, I will continue my daily yoga practice.  Going to start DEDICATE  tomorrow for mornings.  And the monthly theme for evenings.  Thank you, thank you for this journey HOME.  It brought me back to yoga which brought me back to me.  May you and sweet Benji always be surrounded in peace, light, and love.💜",rose louise,2020-01-31T20:51:25Z,0
"Here I entered with my eyes closed to the practice, surprised myself twice looking at you, Adriene, and starting or finishing the same movement.<br /><br />Thanks &lt;3",Viaja con John Dunbar,2020-01-31T20:49:26Z,0
"Thank you. Thank you Adriene, the whole crew and all of you guys who were with me on this journey home. I can&#39;t really explain every aspect of me that experienced benefits from this practice but I can keep thanking you again and again. There is so much going on. So much has changed. And not &quot;just&quot; my flexibility. 😉<br />And its the first finale where I really trusted myself and went with the flow, not stressing about keeping up with you like I did one, two yrs back. I even did some extra moves and there was this one time when I decided to do this one variation I remembered from one of the past episodes, then looked at the screen and you just started to do the same thing 😂<br />Btw that moment at the beginning when Benji makes down dog and you doing the same right after was priceless 😍<br />If anyone made it that far I have a question - are you going to keep that promise we made few days ago about keeping the every day practice? See you tomorrow on the first video on febuary playlist!<br />Namaste everyone! We did it!! 🙏",Mer lin,2020-01-31T20:49:15Z,0

"Before I start...<br />THANK YOU so much for such an amazing journey. Thank you for taking your time to prepare it all for us. It&#39;s been such an honour to be a part of it.<br />I couldn&#39;t stop crying while reading the very last email. And then, when I started the practice, I needed a few minutes to calm down. I found the stillness, it&#39;s a big achievement for me since I struggled for three weeks. I kept telling myself &quot;you did so well&quot;.<br />I&#39;ll be honest. My body was very well prepared this time, I&#39;ve exercised enough for the past few months. It was my mind that struggled the most. I knew it would be tough and challenging. Many thing happened last year and I was running away from thinking. I thought I was doing well distracting myself but all of these sessions made me realise that I can&#39;t avoid it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s been such an emotional journey. I though I wouldn&#39;t write it down but I think I can. It was my first time doing yoga since I stopped taking antidepressants. My emotions were all there, no help, just me and them. It&#39;s such a relief I was able to do it. I&#39;m so grateful for the guidance.<br />I thought I would need a few days off but I might be back tomorrow, I feel like doing it. Let&#39;s see what happens.<br />I read many comments and people are so brave for showing up when it hurts the most, it&#39;s so inspiring. It made this journey even better. It&#39;s incredible.<br />I don&#39;t know what else to say. Once again, thank you so, so much Adriene, it changed the game for me. <br />I&#39;m sending you all the love, you are incredible♥",Osoroshii,2020-01-31T20:42:59Z,0

But after today&#39;s practice I don&#39;t feel proud or elated. I couldn&#39;t trust myself and cricked my neck trying to figure out what I was supposed to do. Without narration all the evil little voices kept chiding me for doing it all wrong and for still not being able to do things (ahem, boat pose...).

"Today&#39;s been the most difficult practice of the journey, but it&#39;s just because my p.e. teacher told me and my classmates that he&#39;s retiring in June, so he won&#39;t be with us during our last school year. And I&#39;m honestly shattered, he has such an important role in my life. I&#39;ve cried during the practice and I&#39;m crying right now. Thank you, Adriene, for making January a special month and for teaching me something new every day, you&#39;re so special and I can&#39;t wait to keep practicing with you in the next 11 months. I&#39;m proud of myself for practicing yoga every single day, no matter what. It&#39;s been a unique, challenging, beautiful experience and I&#39;ll carry with me what I&#39;ve learnt.

I just wanted to thank you Adriene and Benji &lt;3 This journey home was incredible and loved every single practice. When I was younger I sometimes would get very upset and cry in my moms arms and I would say: “I just want to go home” but I was physically at home.  I undoubtedly meant that I was mentally and spiritually not at ease and needed to find my way back to my happy peaceful place. So these 30 days of Home were extra special to me and I just want to thank you so very much! Namaste 🙏🏼,Suzanne Voorn,2020-01-31T20:25:49Z,0
"Adriene thank you so much for this ❤️ I have recently started living away from home for the first time and this journey has taught me that home is not a place: it&#39;s a feeling, a community that spreads over the whole world.

At the start of the month I never thought I could do every day, but we did, we all did it and I&#39;m so proud of everyone ❤️ Namaste 🙏",leahtheperson,2020-01-31T20:25:16Z,0

"I have to say this was my favourite practise of the month, for many reasons. Primarily, it showed me the ability I have to put together the vocabulary I have learned in a meaningful way. <br />I was able to give my body exactly what I needed. Before I started, I saw the practise was 40 minutes long, and I was worried about being able to create enough flow on my own for that long. I did use Adriene as a reference a couple of times, but I typically practise with my eyes closed unless I am really confused. I found myself near the end hoping there would be enough time left to fit everything in that I still had in my head. <br />I cried through the first almost 10 minutes, then a couple more times throughout. It hit me because I have been going to the same yoga class (my first and only studio thus far) with the same guide for over 2 years now, and this week we found out that at the end of February, she is moving, therefore this is our last session of yoga with her. There are so many emotions attached for me because I joined this class two months after moving to the country to live with my fiance, and I was worried I would become lonely and isolated. This class gave me somewhere to go that I felt like I belonged, and I built some beautiful kinship in this class. <br />I do know that I am lucky enough to work in a city nearby-ish and will be ale to pick up classes there. This just hit me so hard because it is the end of HOME and nearing the end of the last session of yoga with my first ever studio and group. <br />I am grateful there are more YWA videos and more yoga studios to join. <br />Namaste. &lt;3",Reanna Boschee,2020-01-31T20:12:21Z,0

My mood is better, sleep is better and i feel more relaxed less stubborn! I absolutely love when you speak so this last was extra hard on me, harder time to focus on breathing. Next time if possible maybe voice over for those that wants to hear you speak? Anyway loved it!

All my poses were forced and rushed as I kept looking at my screen. <br />Halfway through I decided to stop and read the comments. They made me realise I did not need to follow every move, but try and make my own practice based on the last 29. So I picked up where I left of and finished! <br />Even though it did not leave me calm and content, I am glad I really finished the journey.

"Dear Adriene, and YWA Community! This was the third time I did the traditional January yoga challenge with you. This was the second time I could really stick to the daily practice and hop on the mat no matter what had happened previously that day. And this was the first time I could really enjoy the last day, the last practice because before that I was always afraid of the &quot;free-style yoga&quot;, I felt lost without your voice guiding me through the shapes. But not this time. Sometimes I peaked on the video and I smiled because most of the times we were in the same rhythm and we were doing almost the same shapes. Thank you for all your work, your guidence, your enthusiasm. It was a pleasure. See you and every member of the community on the mat. :-) Greetings from Hungary.",Kolinkin,2020-01-31T19:35:29Z,0

I have been practicing yoga for about 7 years.  I have NEVER cried...until today.  Cried through the entire thing. It somehow cleansed my soul..and even typing that seems hooky.  But it did.  It really did.  Thank you Adriene...I needed this.,Kelly Howe,2020-01-31T19:33:58Z,0

"I&#39;ve been here since day one, having tried in the past to carry out different 30 days YWA sessions. This time I&#39;ve practiced until day 7 and then stopped because of a severe urinary tract infection. <br />I laughed to myself, because the next day, day 8, was called Heal. So I listened to my body and took my time to heal what was to be healed with pills, because the body knew better that it was the perfect time to begin or continue my healing.<br />Now I&#39;m coming back and starting the trip again today, when it officially ends. But now, after this month, I do trust myself and Adriene&#39;s voice.<br /><br />Many thanks, Adriene! The seeds you&#39;ve planted now bear fruit.",Bianca Murariu,2020-01-31T19:16:04Z,0

"Oh my goodness! Where to even begin?! I have done all of your 30 day journeys. Dedicate and now Home are the two that I have done “live” and this one just really resonated with me. I really felt the mental and emotional journey this time around, and I could not be more grateful! True and Yoga Camp have been my two favorites, but Home now has a special place in my heart ♥️ I am so inspired by your love and dedication to the YWA community. I love scrolling through the comments and seeing how everyone is doing in their little corner of the world....it’s truly amazing! As always, Day 30 was emotional, we did it, together 😊 I loved hearing the previous 30 day music themes in this video, brings a smile to my face to know “hey I did that!” Shoutout to Benji for being extra cute and lovable in this video, he needs some treats for being such a good assistant 💕 A huge thank you to Adriene and her entire team, this was an incredible journey Home. I know not only me, but the entire YWA community felt the love and commitment in this series 🥰 I intend to journey Home again in the spring, once baby is born 🤰🏻for now my yoga practice will get more and more simple as this last part of my pregnancy wraps up.

"Oh, I felt all the feels during this session. Thank you, so so much, to you Adriene for your magic and deep love, to your team, to all of the yogis who have been practicing along every single day of January. I cannot believe we did it! I was so emotional in the final few minutes, but I know this is just the beginning of a long journey towards daily yoga and a happier, healthier, fuller life.

"Day 30 always has me in tears. There is something so beautiful about surrendering to our most unstoried selves. Today being my 23rd birthday I woke up in a good mood and as soon as I hit the mat I was crying out of sheer joy, at the beauty of the divine grace I have cultivated in these past 30 days and at the collective energy everyone practicing at home is sending by showing up for themselves. We are always growing, but today we are blossoming and thriving. This journey has been such a gift and this particular practice was an amazing way to start my birthday right! Namaste all! I honor the light, grace and beauty within each of you! Thank you for helping me to walk myself home and for letting me walk hike with you as well. Blessings 🙏🕉💖🎉",Connor,2020-01-31T17:59:54Z,0

Adriene THANK YOU 🙏 What a beautiful and amazing 30 journey!! so far I have done all the 30 days with you. And the ending seems a bit sentimental and I&#39;m saddened for it to end.

"Thank you for the entire 30 days, but the last one was disappointing without your voice... I spent the whole time scaring at my screen and it ruined it for me. I did not let go at all, it was frustrating. The 29 first days were great though, too bad you left your microphone!",Cyrille Huteau,2020-01-31T17:56:18Z,0
Wow!! Such a beautiful journey this was!! I really can’t thank you enough for all that you do!! I follow your yoga every day and it is something I need. Like air to breathe. This day 30 is tough for me being that I like to hear your direction. This time I was like I can do this and I peeked over to you a lot to stay with you and I realized that it’s special because this is the time when you are really doing yoga fully with us and not having to talk in between breathing. So it’s a beautiful time to share together side by side. And some times I peeked over and you were smiling and that made me smile too! Thank you so very much!! Your yoga means so much to me and so many people around the world! You are such a beautiful person and I have so much love in my heart!! This was amazing!! 💗🥰❤️😌 🧘🏻‍♀️,Laura DeMelo,2020-01-31T17:55:55Z,0

"Just finished. ♥️ I always get apprehensive in the beginning of day 30 like uhh what the heck should I do? How do I transition from this pose to that pose? But I always surprise myself with how much I recollect and really learned throughout the 30 days. And sure sometimes I take a break in child’s pose or look up for guidance. But that’s really such a great metaphor for life, isn’t it? It’s really a beautiful, strengthening, spiritual experience to just trust your mind and your body and surrender to the practice. Thank you adriene. You and your passion for yoga have blessed my life. ♥️ namaste.",Brittany Ellis,2020-01-31T17:54:15Z,0
I was a bit upset I had to come onto the mat today with the flu and not gonna lie I was in corpse pose for AWHILE but it was the very definition of find what feels good and listen to your body. It wasn’t until I just let myself lie down that I heard that inner teach go “FINALLY”. Things I’ve learned from these 30 days. 1. Mistakes are fiiiine. 2. Go slow and be still! 3. I’m so much stronger. 4. There’s always time for self care and I need to listen to when I need it. 5. There’s love everywhere ! <br />Well done everyone. We did it ! And thank you Adriene for all you do for us ! ♥️,JuJu Sonders,2020-01-31T17:53:19Z,0
"Funny coincidence (or is it?). Completely focused on doing my own practice, I looked at the video somewhere halfway through and found Adriene in exactly the same posture I was in.

I have so much gratitude not for just you but for myself and everything in my life. I love my FWFG family. There’s so much love spewing from me right now. Let’s keep this going!

Now I can&#39;t believe I stuck with the practice and I&#39;m more committed than ever to keep up with you and my yoga. I can attest to the benefits of it, I used to have the worst flexibility now my progress it&#39;s unbelievable. I&#39;m even getting teary-eyed.

Thank you so much for this practice. I&#39;ve been following you for years now and today I noticed poses that used to be difficult for me I was able to do for the first time and of course I got wobbly and stumbled along the way but instead of criticizing myself I breathed in and recognized that it is all apart of the process. I&#39;ve grown so much in this past month of daily practice and I&#39;m so grateful I was able to grow with you and this beautiful and wonderful community! Namaste,rliyah304,2020-01-31T17:46:11Z,0

I feel it&#39;s speaking directly to me. <br />There is something that my soul has been calling for but my courage has not yet been able to open to.

"Hi Andrene. I want to take a moment to say thank you for sharing your experience and knowledge with us. I’ve started doing yoga in December when I found your 30 day yoga challenge that you had posted 4 years ago. I remember how I left the comment “One day my heels will touch the ground”. Today I did it. <br /><br />I know that I’m on the right way of finding inner peace. I have unstable relationship with my body and food, but our yoga community helps me to find what feels good and reminds that they’ll catch me if I fall. I feel support. <br /><br />May your life be happy and balanced. I keep going with you.<br /><br />Namaste",GIRL WITH LUV,2020-01-31T17:42:29Z,0

And we&#39;ll end this practice by whispering -Namaste.&quot; <br />Also, I did the boat pose with you -had to pause the video so we were moving together! <br /><br />Thank you so much for this journey back HOME. I had great but also very bad days this month, and even when I was feeling tired and sore, not showing up on the mat wasn&#39;t even an option. Each time I ended washed, soothed and smiling.

About a week ago I caught myself worrying about this session. I remember being a bit scared of it last year when I did 30 days for the first time. I stopped and thought &#39;Trust the process&#39;.

"This is my second time taking part in the January 30 Day Challenge. Last year, I was amazed at how quickly I was noticing changes within my body and in my strength. And then... I stopped practicing all year. This time, I did not skip a single day, I enjoyed every single stop on the journey home, and again, I&#39;m noticing such an incredible difference within me between day 1 and day 30. But not just physically, but mentally as well.

I was a little scared when I saw this was a 42 minute video without guidance since I am new to the community. I almost didn&#39;t practice.  But I took a deep breath and got started.  I&#39;m glad I did. With a little help from you I was able to create a flow that was natural to me. I&#39;m looking forward to continuing my journey with all your videos as motivation. Thank you! Peace and Love to you and the whole community.,Dominique T.,2020-01-31T17:01:09Z,1

"I did it all 30 days, everyday despite a lot of things coming in the way of it. Thank you Adriene for the journey you took me on this month.<br /><br /> But I always have a love-hate relationship with day 30 because i really rely on audible instructions because i easily get distracted so this dsy might be the greatest challenge for me especially doing it after a busy day. I managed in a way but it&#39;s always my least favorite day sadly. Maybe that will change someday but not this time around.",Cathy Jean,2020-01-31T16:29:19Z,12
"Same. This was my first day 30, and I think I spent maybe the middle 10 minutes just watching because I was so tired of craning my neck to see what she was doing. It&#39;s much more relaxing and gratifying to move smoothly from post to pose by her verbal guidance than to stop each pose and watch to see if she is on to the next thing or not.",blaiseblack,2020-02-01T06:21:36Z,4
Cathy Jean I totally agree. I think my neck ends up hurting from having to watch for cues to move instead of listening to the audio. Halfway through I was ready to quit this video and just do day 1 as my day 30,Katherine Scrivens,2020-02-01T04:32:26Z,4

"This practice was so eye-opening! I started out trying to follow Adriene pretty closely, but after about 20 minutes, I felt worn out and decided to do my own thing. After that I switched between following her or just finding something that felt good (😉). On my own, I started doing some practice on the floor for a while, and right after finishing off with a bridge pose, I was amazed to see Adriene doing bridge pose herself! I had lined up with the video without meaning to!<br />These last 30 days have taught me so much. I have learned so much about myself, my capabilities, and listening to my body more deeply. I am so grateful to Adriene for all that she is doing for us, and so grateful for the practice of yoga. Congratulations everyone, we made it Home ❤",Michelle Nielson,2020-01-31T16:15:55Z,3

"Wow! What a lovely, healing ride. I discovered this channel four or five years ago, which was probably my first attempt at one of the 30-day journeys, and I think I&#39;ve started each January since with an attempt to complete one, but something always got in the way. Not this time! It&#39;s amazing how good it feels just to know I have it in me to follow all the way through, not to mention the physical and psychological warmth that comes along with daily practice :) <br /><br /><br />I&#39;m grateful to myself for managing to show up, even when it was rough, and for being kind myself on the days when I couldn&#39;t give 100%. I&#39;m grateful for this community for being a bright spot every morning reminding me of what we have been sharing here, the love and joy and healing power of movement together. And I&#39;m so so so grateful to you, Adriene, for making it all possible--no one could ask for a better guide on this journey. <br /><br /><br />My cat is sitting beside me purring meaningfully so guess I should also include her in here for being a constant presence along the way to remind me not to take myself too seriously ^.^ this one&#39;s for you Maiz.<br /><br /><br />Love and gratitude to you all.

"<b>HOME - day 30/30:</b><br />For me, this was honestly probably the most difficult day of this journey out of them all. Last year, I loosely followed both the Dedicate and True 30-day yoga journeys, but skipped the last day when I realised they were silent because I was in a place where I couldn’t be alone with myself... This year, I’m not much better, but I made a commitment and decided to show up for myself even though I knew it wouldn’t be easy. And I did it! Granted, I spent the last 10 minutes lying on my back while thinking about stuff I probably shouldn’t have been thinking about while doing yoga, but I still did it.🤷‍♀️ However, I’ll be looking forward to being guided by your lovely voice again, Adriene.😊 Thank you so much for this experience, and I’m sending love to everyone who completed this journey with me.❤️",Lea Jacobsen,2020-01-31T15:50:09Z,47

As I hoped on the mat something happened, I started crying like a baby. Relief, pride, a lot of disbelief that I actually pulled that off - but in a good sense, plus all the stress I&#39;ve been going thru this month moving out of my mother&#39;s house (yeah, I&#39;ve been literally searching for a home)...  It all just came running in tears. This practice really was a journey. I cried, laughed, fell on my ass, tried to do a inversion for the first time (not even close, but we will get there), slipped in sweat, rested. Every single second was pure bliss. It&#39;s weird to feel this kind of connection digitally, but I&#39;m so thankful for being a part of this community. And I&#39;m so thankful to be united with me again. Thank you all. Thank you Adriene 💜 I&#39;m truly home :)",Ana Carolina Barreto,2020-01-31T15:41:05Z,149

Same! I don’t know why but day 30 really gets to me in a way I don’t understand. I also teared up multiple times throughout the whole thing haha. And good luck with your moving/ finding a new home! ❤️,fluffycuteish,2020-02-02T03:01:48Z,0

"Thank you Adriene! I set my intention at the beginning of the journey: finish the 30 days (a pretty straight forward intention, but still), and I did it! :-) I was smiling on the mat today, even though I felt a little lost at times without you guiding me, but I am just very happy to have stuck to my goal.",Sjoerd Dobbinga,2020-01-31T15:40:23Z,1
"Thank You so much for this experience. I will miss mornings with Your loving mails of encuragement.<br />And just as You said - showing up is the hardest thing. After this 30 days I feel new strenght, espetialy in my arms and hands, the kind I never knew existed. I also love joga gained felxibility ❤<br />It feels like my journey home will take some time, maybe even my whole lifetime, but I am glad to be on this path.<br />This practice espetialy moved me through showing that I am able to use what I learned and actually be in charge of my own practice from time to time 😊<br />Thank You once more and see You soon!<br /><br />Warm hugs from rainy Krakow, Poland 💗",Magdalena Sopata,2020-01-31T15:38:57Z,1
"ahhhh I had such a difficult time today! not having any verbal cues meant I was constantly craning to try and see the video from a variety of weird positions -- downward dog, triangle pose, forward fold... I felt like I could never relax into any posture because I wouldn&#39;t know when to come out of it :( part way through I wondered if the point was not to try to follow, since that&#39;s so difficult without verbal cues, but to do my own thing? but then I&#39;d look over and see you doing something and wish I was following along properly. I feel like I really would&#39;ve enjoyed this session with the normal voice over a lot more, although I hear you when you say this is apparently a day 30 tradition.  nevertheless, I am grateful for the HOME series and proud of myself for completing it :)",Samantha O'Dell,2020-01-31T15:38:26Z,0
"Dearest Adriene and Benji, Dearest Fellow YWA HOME explorers, <br />Thank you. What a revelation, what a true, true honor it has been practicing with you all. This series feels special in so many ways and has an enormous impact on my day to day. Normally I am nervous on the self-led Day 30, but I basically ran to the mat this morning. And felt every second. How lucky we are to have Adriene and each other. There is max power in US, yall. Love every one of yous. NAMASTE 💞🙏🏼",Abbey Orzech,2020-01-31T15:36:06Z,0

"Haven&#39;t done day 30 yet, but i wanna say that i&#39;m so honored to be here and i can&#39;t believe it&#39;s over, i had so much during those 30 days, i laughed, i smiled, i cried, i broke down, but i know that Adriene and the yoga mat have my back, whatever i step on the mat with i step off without, it feels like i&#39;m exploring myself day by day, i know myself more than i used to before this journey. Home where everything begins, the past us created the present us and will create the future us, as you always say that we don&#39;t become something that we&#39;re not, it&#39;s already in us, that meant a lot to me and it kept me thinking &quot;Who&#39;s this amazing person inside me? what&#39;s new to explore every day? is there a wonderland inside this person that&#39;s lost and feels she&#39;s missing something?&quot; it&#39;s deep to think about but also logical, we have what we need, we don&#39;t have to look for it somewhere else. I always tell myself that i basically can&#39;t know everything, and it&#39;s okay to not know something, i learn, i analyze, i understand, i do, what&#39;s the point of life if we don&#39;t have something to live for? something keeps us alive everyday, something that we wake up for, and i&#39;m so so so glad to have yoga, to have you and your amazing wisdom, i hope that my words reach you with all my emotions, may my love to yoga, my desire to built strength and blanket myself with love, my ability to be grateful to every little moment, to savor it, to take up space, to take a deep breath, could show you how much i love you Adriene. Thank you for always working hard, you made it happen, and we all did it with love and appreciation, 30 days of Home, is over, and something beautiful will show up after, it&#39;s already inside, we just gave it a chance. Love you Adriene, and congrats for 6M, i&#39;m so happy for you😄🎉🎊❤❤",SANNIE,2020-01-31T15:33:21Z,2

After finding you on YouTube, I’ve begun to love it more and more.

I managed do my own thing for a while, then I kind of started to forget my vocabulary so I went back to you, Adriane.  I don’t know you personally, but I feel so much gratitude to have found you and your videos. You’re a beautiful light in this world. Thanks you for sharing, teaching and caring. Lots of love and respect for you, Benji and your team. &lt;3 <br />This yoga practice has changed my mornings.",Paola,2020-01-31T15:16:24Z,89
"What an amazing practice today. I ended up turning off the video and just letting the music and my breath guide me.

The two things together right now make me feel like a superhero. I really thank you and your team and Benji, of course, enough! Much love to you and see you on the mat!",Kelly Marie Martin,2020-01-31T15:08:45Z,0
"When I first pressed play, I was filled with fear. I have never trusted myself or my body; how could I do this without guidance? After a few tearful and panicky moments at the start, I realized that I DID know what to do; my body knew. So, I let go of the fear and trusted my body and mind to guide me where I needed to go. And at the end, I was sobbing in gratitude. My body has always known what to do, I was just too afraid to listen to it. I will NOT forget this powerful lesson. Perhaps I am truly coming home. Thank you so much for this incredibly journey, Adriene, and everyone who worked behind the scenes, and everyone who also came along on our journeys home. Daily yoga will continue, and I&#39;m looking forward to February&#39;s playlist. Namaste.",PhoenixPinion,2020-01-31T15:08:44Z,1
"I completed the journey.... it took me a few attempts but I followed a full 30 day from start to finish in the 30 days, which means I’ve practiced yoga every day this year, I’ve made some changes and recognised my worth<br /><br />I love the moments Adriene pauses to play or kiss Benji, it reminds me that yoga is about being not achieving an outcome",Jocelyn Raine,2020-01-31T15:08:28Z,0

"Adriene, this is my fourth year doing your 30 Day Yoga Journey. Tears rolled down my face as I listened to Dedicate, Revolution and Yoga Camp theme songs throughout this practice. My life has changed so much, and your presence has been one of the few constants in the last few years, especially in January. I often kid that you are my guru, and I tell everyone who will listen that they should try one of your videos. Thank you so much for another beautiful kickstart to the new year. Thank you Blue, Benji, the YWA team, and this amazing community. My plan this year is to do 300 days of yoga. So, to continue the momentum, I will start Dedicate tomorrow! Can’t wait! Love you all!

"Thank you self for knowing that I wanted to twist a lot today. I added a twist in to every posture, then went to the ground early to support my back. At first I was anxious leaving Adriene&#39;s flow, but I knew what I needed and I feel so good for doing it. <br />Lessons I&#39;ve learned that I want to thank Adriene for: I don&#39;t need to rush into a difficult posture - I just need to revisit it daily and before I even know it, I&#39;ll be comfortable and happy there; my days are best when I visit yoga in the morning before work rather than in the evening; I can find my own best practice while still having a guide to be there with me.

"Thank you for this journey, Adriene! You are amazing! I love your channel and your videos, thank you for everything. I’ve been following you and your videos for years now, and I love you. <br />Now, unpopular opinion: I truly dislike silent practices. I adore doing the 30 day journey with you, so the last day without your voice (or even Benji’s paws!) is like doing any other yoga video. Having to listen to generic instrumental music while twisting my neck to watch the video (instead of letting myself be guided by your voice) was quite anticlimactic for me 😔 <br />But other than that, thank you for your time and for the love you pour into these videos! ❤️ You are great!",Dany1Spike,2020-01-31T15:02:11Z,0
Thank you Adriene!! This journey was lovely!! In just 30 days I&#39;ve noticed both physical  and mental benefits. My posture has improved a lot and it&#39;s easier for me to connect with my breath and calm down. So I&#39;ll keep going! Lots of love from Spain!,Agatha K.,2020-01-31T15:00:58Z,0

I moved, cried some more and began to see and find parts of myself I thought I had lost. Then I laughed and cried some more. I am proud of myself that I kept with your challenge.

"Yea congrats to everyone who has made it to day 30! I had a wonderful time on this journey. The hardest part was making time for myself to do it every day. For me this practice wasn&#39;t just about doing yoga but about finding time for yourself. On a side note we did hip dips and of course I thought better than boat crunches. I think you heard me, cause to my suprise at the end of the video was boat crunches. I did them... I just wasn&#39;t to thrilled about it. Thank you Adriene for your time and dedication to all of us.

This last week, I could feel my anxiety fade, my digestion has been smooth, I feel strong and my intuition is high. I&#39;ve been practising yoga for a long time, but somehow once in a while I forget its power and drop my practice.

"I just wanted to say thank you, Adrienne. Your commitment to sharing the beauty of your practice is commendable. <br />I have always wanted to be able to fit yoga into my routine because I have been rendered very inflexible from four years of lifting with little to no mobility routine. <br />But I live on a military base in the desert, so needless to say the accessibility of a yoga class is... absent. <br />That being said I had tried previous practices on youtube but yours was the only one to stick!<br />With this new year, I finally said to myself I&#39;m going to do this every day, and this journey has been exactly what I needed.<br />Thank you again!<br /><br /><br />IF I COULD IMPART SOME CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM THOUGH:<br />I can&#39;t complain about any of the other days but to be frank, this finale was a huge let down for me. Without the audial guided talking us through movements, I found myself constantly cranking my neck in every position to make sure I didn&#39;t miss a change or I didn&#39;t check enough and was left way behind. Not to mention that all that distraction made it very hard for me to maintain my conscious breathing. All in all, it made me feel very discouraged because I refused to quit. But I just couldn&#39;t handle this tempo as a beginner with no audial guide...<br />I know it is tradition to get rid of mic for last day I just figured you were owed some food for thought :)<br /><br /><br />Like I said it&#39;s been life-changing though and you&#39;ve earned a routine view EVERY morning now, thank you",Baby Joe,2020-01-31T14:36:33Z,0

"I seriously injured my left knee when I was 14,after that I had to stop most of my physical activities. Long journey of healing began but today on the mat a sharp pain arose from my left knee. I stopped everything, set down with it and allowed the energy to come up into my heart. I could finally feel the sorrow and unloved-ness that was in there, stored. Today the feeling vould come up and I cried all the way to the end of the practice (and finished it fully meanwhile!). I was crying not because of the pain but because now love started to pour in where there was pain before. This is true healing.<br />We love you Adriene, no words for your beauty, loving heart, sweetness and truth. Thank you and thank you All ❤❤❤❤",Anna Divya Csetverikov,2020-01-31T14:35:16Z,3

"This is my fourth (!!!) 30 Day journey with Adriene...wow. I loved hearing the old theme music from past years in the background of this practice. It really stirred up a lot of gratitude for the long journey I’ve taken to reach this point, and just how much I’ve grown because I stumbled onto this channel in January of 2017. Thank you Adriene.

"Day 30: Journey. Sniff sniff...Gosh I can&#39;t believe that I am a little emotional. But then again, not so much because I am going to continue the journey in February as well. This healing process is not over for me just yet. This was a yummy practice. I stuck with it. I was less shaky today. There was a kind of resolute that I felt in my body and my mind. And I must mention that the music is so amazing. Kudos to the people behind such creation. The pieces were perfectly timed. There were moments where I was slowing down and then the music would rise and give me the much-needed inertia along with bursts of excitement. Thank you so much, Adriene, for taking me through this journey....this journey HOME. I am HOME and I will see you tomorrow. Namaste. ;D",rubyveil19,2020-01-31T14:30:41Z,18

"Thank you Adriene  for an incredible month of yoga! I am currently making the trip from Western Canada to California and you have been with me  on the journey. Seemed fitting that the last day of Home,  I finished  in the hotel room on the last stop until our destination. This was my first challenge and I will start a previous year tomorrow. <br />The last practice was beautiful and was a full well rounded yoga session. I liked the music, but with a person with some neck issues, I did miss the instructions. Haha, I did your neck and shoulder practice right after. <br />I would love if you had another day  30 with your voice guidance since it was so beautiful and full of all the yoga positions that we had practiced the last month. <br />This was such a beautiful community and I felt privileged to have shared it with everyone!  “Namaste”♥️",Karen Richardson,2020-01-31T14:26:43Z,0

"Thank you again for this 30-day practice, Adriene. I managed to keep up with it every day, and it really did help me on my journey. During today&#39;s practice, I found myself smiling, laughing, and even crying.... but now they are tears of joy and gratitude instead of grief. Today&#39;s star pose really got me... reminded me that I am allowed to take up space, and I have power. Thank you for walking me toward home, Adriene... I&#39;m not quite there yet, but I can see it just around the corner, and I know I can get there.",Remarkable Monkey,2020-01-31T14:24:10Z,0
"I must say, I almost panicked when you said no microphone but I stayed with it.  I did miss your voice and you reminding me to breathe! I reminded myself halfway through.  I began doing YWA a couple of years ago when I first found you.  In November 2019 I made a commitment to do it daily because I felt there was no excuse with as little as 7 minute practices to as much as I wanted.  I also thought it would keep me healthy through the holiday season and winter.  I made it through the holidays with just a short-lived cold.  I feel healthy and stronger now because of it.  I want to thank you and all of the people behind the scenes.  Although I am here alone in my dining room I never feel alone with this community practicing along side me!  Thank you, Adriene!  Have a wonderful day everyone!  ~namaste xoxo",A Lochetto,2020-01-31T14:23:55Z,0

"This has been the most amazing 30 day challenge I have ever done.  Usually my challenges, or goals that I set around fitness, have been centered around things like running a marathon, biking 150 miles and enduring some kind of pain or burn out.  This challenge has been all about learning to listen to my body and giving myself permission to take a break if needed.  I have taken the skills that I learned off the mat into my daily life and have not looked to be perfect but rather to take time to listen to what I need.  As a mother, wife, and survivor of abuse I have not put much stock into my needs and tend to &quot;stuff it down&quot; to the point where there is no more room for stuffing.  I plan to repeat this entire 30 days and continue to learn how to  listen to my needs and nourish my body and soul.  Thank you Adriene for all you have taught us and for helping me to start the journey home!!!",Amanda Mott,2020-01-31T14:21:28Z,1

"I’m writing this with such a full heart. When I first started yoga 5 years ago, I was too afraid to practice without a teacher, without a voice, because it would force me to deal with my thoughts and emotions during yoga. But today’s practice took my hand and made me understand that it’s okay. That I’m okay. That my thoughts are just thoughts and they pass, like a cloud in the sky. <br />Adriene, thank you so much for being there for me. Thank you for teaching me how to be strong and soft, for teaching me how to be alive and unwind. Thank you for this journey, it has been life changing.

Thank you yoga community for taking this ride with me.  I have learned a lot about myself on the mat to help me get through these medication side effects.

And, to be honest, I thought for a moment that it won&#39;t change anything, but it did change a lot. At the end of this journey, I really feel like I finally got to know the real me and the full potential of my body.

"The concept of &quot;finding what feels good&quot; and &quot;leaving the rest&quot; really comforts me. It&#39;s like permission to be yourself with no need to fit a square peg in a round hole. I started YWA last year around this time. I alternated between the same 2 beginner videos for about two months straight. I didn&#39;t think I was &quot;ready&quot; for a 30 day series. The first series I did was the Dedicate series. It took me around 40 days to complete it. I did the Dedicate series again and this time it took something like 50 days. A lot was going on in my life. I found myself a stranger in a new home. So, then I started the True series. The first time around was about 35 days and the second time doing True was about 32. How long it takes doesn&#39;t matter, what is important is how I gripped on to those series during a difficult time in my life. I had a roof over my head but I was never home until I was on the mat. So you can see, as the beginning of Home approached, I felt an intense closeness to it. The mat, my head, my breathing, these are where Home lies within me. Here I am, 30 days in 30 days. It&#39;s a small accomplishment in this vast world of yoga but I am so grateful to you, Adriene. You didn&#39;t buy me a house but you taught me a Home. Thank you. Namaste.",Jordan Fuentes,2020-01-31T14:01:08Z,25

I even considered just doing another video to end the 30 days. Then I realized that I was stuck on getting it right. I&#39;m new to yoga and thought that there was no way I could get through 40 minutes without following every move as perfectly as possible. Then I surrendered. I followed when I could, caught up when I could, did what I could--trusted myself. I was surprised to see the comments about people getting emotional at the end.

"This intro made me cry... I love you for being you and sharing that energy with the rest of the world. Namaste!<br />Edit after I finished the practice: WOW, I don&#39;t know where to begin... When Adriene said, &quot;I&#39;m taking off the mic, you&#39;re on your own.&quot;, I was unsure what would it turn out to be. But let me tell you this, as soon as I sat down crossed-legged, I had the BEST flow ever! Being able to really focus on my breath and movements in truly my OWN time, because my breath and time are slower than Adriene&#39;s, was amazing. I have never felt more open and balanced, and aware during practice until today. That just shows how extraordinary and special Adriene&#39;s teachings are. I&#39;m really glad I found her because during this 30 days yoga journey I feel like she&#39;s become a close friend. And I&#39;m looking forward to meeting her every day. Again, thank you Adriene for choosing to spread the light you carry in you! Hope to be able to meet you one day. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow. Namaste.",Melisa Hodzha,2020-01-31T13:18:04Z,1

"I’ve been a longtime lurker but this year I actually did the challenge. I’ve been loving it and falling in love with yoga again. <br />However... This one freaked my out! I’m so scared of doing flows of my own creation, because I forget so quickly what I’ve just done. Which is why I need someone telling me what to do! I can’t stay with my breath or feel my body properly if I’m constantly checking the screen for where you are, because there are no cues... <br />So yeah, I didn’t complete the 30 days. But I started.",KikkiGylden,2020-01-31T13:12:43Z,0

"Dearest Adriene, I have been with you since the FIRST 30 days of yoga series! I always disliked the last day, because you weren’t there to “guide” me. I would always try and look at what you were doing next. But today was so very special, I listened to your advice about being open minded and while at first I thought, 40 minutes!! How can I possibly find stuff to do? But guess what? You finished BEFORE me today! 🤯 As different moves kept popping in my head, your voice was there to guide me through!

"Today’s practice was incredible... I’ll admit I was a little terrified at the thought of having to guide myself through an entire practice, however I didn’t realise how much I needed it until I began. I could take everything I needed and follow my body through it’s own flow, all the while I still had Adriene’s voice guiding me through in my mind, reminding me to soften, breathe, notice... I have never been more excited for what my yoga journey holds next. Namaste 🙏 💗",Abby Lynch,2020-01-31T12:59:11Z,9

My husband encouraged me to keep going, and I’m glad I did. I’m not just stronger physically, but mentally, too. I regained strength that I lost last year due to a herniated disk, and am practicing my inversions again. Work is incredibly stressful this time of year, but I am able to manage my anxiety.

I’ve also been suffering with lower back pain since October, and I can’t tell you how much this daily movement practice has made my back so much stronger and pain-free. I can finally start to get back to my normal activities like strength training. This challenge is the first thing I’ve ever done consistently every day, and I’m so grateful.

"I started following YWA since last September when my sore back was getting annoying, friends suggested that yoga could help. YWA was the first came up on the search and I gave it a try... and I was hooked. For a first time yogi and English is not my first language, practicing with YWA is incredibly easy and enjoyable to follow... you all know what I meant 😄<br />In the first few weeks even a short 20 minutes practice had me sweated like a dog and I love it! Over the time I sweat less and less (weather change is one of the reasons of course) , this 30th day of Home have me sweated through my shirt despite it’s 13°c here in Hong Kong (most of the time we’re above 25°c, believe me, it’s cold for us), now I feel warm, refresh and alive, thank you Adriene, namaste 🙏",raye,2020-01-31T12:47:10Z,8

"Such a sweet practice of learning to listen to my own body and give it what it needs. I&#39;m the one in public class in the corner adding my own poses and transitioning whenever it feels right to me. My sweet dog who usually ignores me during practice wanted some love not long after I had hit the mat. Then Benji came along and did the same to Adriene with his downward dog during cat-cow. Haha! We must be glowing with positive energy. Did anyone else&#39;s pet give them extra attention during this practice?

"After I finished this one-left-step to enter the home, I have gone through the comment section, reading one by one, make it to some point, slowly and carefully. And first of all, I can tell you, dear soul, these pals truly love you. :) Besides all these delicate and precious love notes, it seems that there is not much left to add. I have chosen this segment of &#39;Great Dictator’s&#39; speech:<br />“We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.<br />Machinery that gives us abundance has left us in want.<br />Our knowledge has made us cynical.<br />Our cleverness, hard and unkind.<br />We think too much and feel too little.<br />More than machinery, we need humanity.<br />More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.<br />Without these qualities, life will be violent, and all will be lost.”<br />I can also tell that there is one rare contemporary social phenomenon that keeps these precious qualities still running in human beings. That and much more... Don’t you think? ;)<br />Namaste people &lt;3",Jelena Nedeljkovic,2020-01-31T12:24:35Z,3

"when you’re in a not to good place, you tend to don’t trust your decisions anymore. That’s why tagging along with a teacher like Adriene feels good, cause she&#39;s making the decisions for you. Today, since that was kind of the idea, I tried to go my own way on some parts and if felt really good to see that my decisions didn’t end bad after all. (sounds silly but its the truth) That was a very powerful feeling. I was saying then yea I&#39;m going to keep it cool this time when Benji showed up with his downward facing dog, that made my eyes water… darn! Lol.. I want to thank you from the heart Adriene, for this journey and the effort you put in to make this available to us all. Can’t believe it went by so fast.. love XO",Michael B,2020-01-31T12:14:38Z,40

Incredibly emotional after this one. The intro music to home! My dog has learned it he comes and lies down next to me when he hears it. I didn&#39;t know what to expect when I did this one day. Intitally I though nooooooo I can&#39;t do this free style. I don&#39;t have it in me. But then I can&#39;t believe how many moves I remembered. I had a little sneak peak in the middle and towards the end as  I wanted to make sure I did some nice stretches as a cool down. Never thought I&#39;d choose 1 legged pigeon today as something that feels good. It&#39;s not the most comfy for me but it felt right today.<br />I just wanted to say an incredibly huge thank you to Adriene and team for this beautiful gift. And each and everyone who comes together. It made sure I showed up each day. Looking forward to Kiss from tomorrow.,Dawn Taylor-Moate,2020-01-31T11:51:12Z,5

"Thank you so much Adrienne! I think this is the third time i am doing your 30 days januaries. Everytime i learn something new!<br />First time i learned that i am able to do daily Yoga for a whole month and realize that even though it only takes half an hour per day, i can observe how my body is changing!<br />Second time i Sticked with the daily practice into June so i learned that if you make yoga and health a priority, it is pretty easy to stick to it as it so quickly becomes a habit and even if on some days you only squeeze five minutes of practice in, all of them count towards a better mind and body!<br />This time around i learned to let go and be more okay with it If a posture does not feel well and listen to my body when something is too intense. I realized that the biggest judge of myself was actually me. Thank you so much for taking all of us on your journey Home! Much love ♥️♥️♥️",thislonelyfriday,2020-01-31T11:48:21Z,0

"My home is my favorite place to be so when I decided to do the Home 30 day challenge, it just felt like the right thing to do.  I was not sure if I would make it because I had never committed to 30 days of any physical activity.  I’ve tried a lot but never stuck with them.  Each day was like opening a present at 4am.  Each day I showed up I was amazed at what my body did, each day I showed up I was amazed at the clarity in my mind and each day I showed up I was amazed at myself.  The free flow of today’s practice was great I let my body lead and my mind followed. I did 35 minutes of practice and the last 5 minutes I meditated and gave grateful thanks.  This community has been great and supportive.  Thank you Sweet Adrian and Benji for all you do to inspire, equip and guide us.  Namaste",Rolanda Wilkins,2020-01-31T10:56:38Z,1

"Wow, that was so special! ♡ It was kind of strange without the mic, but I was totally hearing your voice in my head (it&#39;s the same thing with my ballet teacher, when I&#39;m practicing on my own I hear her corrections in my mind) ♡ And I absolutely love that, it just goes to show how much I have learned and how deeply all of those things you mentioned and explained have sunk in. I felt really at peace during this practice and it gave me the chance to focus on my breath even more so than usual. And also, it is just amazing to see how much we covered in this yoga journey and how much the vocabulary has grown. I am so grateful for this yoga journey, it is part of a wonderful start into the year 2020 :) It added so much to my life and it helped me so much. Daily yoga practice is truly special ♡ I can&#39;t thank you enough for this incredible gift Adriene! ♡",Alena669,2020-01-31T10:24:06Z,0

"I started my yoga practice last year before I turned 30. Ever since then, it has been a transformative journey for me. I learned to re-evaluate on how to treat myself and how to take care of myself with patience and compassion. I finished the 30-day yoga HOME with everyone. I must say, I’m gonna miss the daily emails from you. They keep me motivated even on days that I kinda don’t want to step on the mat. Adriene has been a light on a dark tunnel not only to me but to the entire yoga-practicing-world. Thank you for the inspiration and guidance. Thank you for all the effort you put in the production of these videos. Thank you for keeping the fire burning  for all of us. So much gratitude I offer and I’m sure a lot of us in the community as well. And congratulations for hitting 6 million + subscribers. Well deserved. Inhale and exhale all the love. Cheers! 🍻🙏🏻😊",Topher Pendragon,2020-01-31T10:10:55Z,11

I know that when I&#39;m stressed or feeling low or tired that I need time to breathe, and to return to me, to home. Adriene, I can&#39;t stop crying, as you have also come to feel like home for me and for so so so many others. We. Love. You. Adriene. You are home.

I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s over. Thank you so much for this Adrienne. I achieved so much in this first month and I believe it&#39;s because if this. I gained so much confidence and made many life changing decisions. This also really helped me with my ED. Before this I just couldn&#39;t eat anything without thinking about it or throwing up after but now it&#39;s so different. I&#39;m finally home. Thank you so much.

"That was great! I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d be able to freestyle for so long - 10 minutes in, I was a bit worried, but then the next time I looked I was 27 minutes in! I joined you for the sitting twists and the boats but then I just went into a super long shavasana which ended up lasting about 10 minutes! This is the first time I&#39;ve felt able to do a yoga routine on my own cues so thank you Adriene - all your videos and this Home series especially have given me that. I&#39;m planning to continue with daily yoga via your calendar all through February - and hopefully beyond, but I like to just plan a month at a time.

"Adriene, you’ve given us all so much more than yoga shapes. I feel like I’ve had a private therapy session each time I leave the mat. I appreciate the careful, loving guidance, all the giggles, and the wonderful community that joins in and supports us all. I love the beautiful theming and poetry that you introduce each day with. This is the true spirit and intent of yoga; connection and union. I’m also a teacher and I take many gifts away to inspire my teaching. It’s been a rocky start to this year, all over the world I sense, but especially here (in South Eastern Australia) as our beloved bush burns out of control. Thank you for this anchor in love, in self, in Home. Namaste.🙏💖🌻",Katrina Hinton,2020-01-31T09:54:34Z,0
"Thank you Adriene, for this amazing gift you gave all of us. I cried today, and I felt loved and guided. I felt home. Last year has been so tough, I went through an eating disorder, had to put my sweet furry angel to sleep, and moved to a new country, alone. It is your guidance that helps me get through the days and your love that embraces me and reminds me of my own innate ability to embrace myself - with love. <br />Thank you, from the depth of my heart, for being here, my beloved teacher.",Anna Kravtsova,2020-01-31T09:53:43Z,2

"Thank you, Adriene, for guiding me HOME. I found this morning&#39;s practice (yes! I managed a morning) very difficult. I wanted your instruction and peaking at the screen frequently interrupted my flow. Maybe next year I will be more in tune. It was however emotional, and I was accompanied by the neighbouring church bells, which added to the vibe. I intend to keep up daily practice with you. Namaste 🙏",Clare Moody,2020-01-31T09:46:21Z,8

But I enjoyed &quot;unpacking&quot; all the different sequences we&#39;ve learned &amp; repeated during the 30 days and being there with the music. My favourite parts were the first of the standing splits where my leg seemed to just &quot;fly up&quot; effortlessly to the music and then the star pose.

And with Adriene&#39;s guidance I did it and felt amazing.<br /><br /><br />This year I barely looked at the video. I feel so strong and graceful.

Deepest gratitude for your love care and inspiration. Can I ask if next year you could end with your voice rather than the visual. Most times I’m guided by your voice in any case. The only time I’ve had a niggle / injury is from your non-audio sequences (neck strain) but I am in my 50s. Xx,D !,2020-01-31T08:50:44Z,0

"Thank you so much again for these past 30 days Adriene. Every year during the last practice, when the music from the other 30 days are playing I think back to where I was when I started doing yoga, and all the years since. The first year I did the 30 days in realtime in January was in 2017. I was doing fieldwork abroad in a country where people were very reserved, and had just celebrated Christmas and NYE all alone. The start of the 30 days marked the end of that fieldwork and of being lonely, with my family coming to visit me and traveling with them. I didn&#39;t know it at the time, but it would also be the last time traveling with both my parents together, because by the next 30 days in 2018, they were mid-divorce. It was a sad time, but also full of surprises. I had moved back home temporarily after my fieldwork of the year before, and because of the divorce I had to find an apartment. The first day of the 30 days that year, January 2nd, I got the news that I got an apartment. I felt like I was rescued, although that apartment never really started to feel like home. By last year&#39;s 30 days, I had just submitted my master thesis, and my defense was during that month. I finally obtained my masters degree and finished university forever. What I didn&#39;t know was that I would be here, this year, in a new city in a new country, as a PhD student at a new university and in an apartment that finally feels like home. Although I am far away from my family, my apartment feels like it&#39;s mine, and like I belong. That is why this year&#39;s theme is so beautifully fitting for my situation. And today is also the day that my sister comes to visit me, so family is not always that far away after all. Again, thank you Adriene for organising this beautiful journey for us every year. As during all the past 30 days, I learned a lot about myself, I laughed and I cried, but this year those were mostly years of happiness and joy.",Eline Castelijns,2020-01-31T08:38:57Z,0

"Thank you for another great journey. I have taken part of 30 days of yoga for several years now, however I always fail at the last day. My brain is constantly busy and anxious and only time I can properly silence it is during the guided yoga practice. Trying to do it by myself always leaves me frustrated, I just need someone to tell me what to do. But I&#39;m going to jump straight into older 30 days practices and keep doing them through the spring, as these sessions are so helpful not only to my physical self but the mental well being aswell  specially during winter months.",Jemppu,2020-01-31T08:26:42Z,0

This has been a beautiful 29 days. But I really struggle with these &#39;no mike&#39; sessions! End up getting upset as I end up with a crick in the neck trying to follow the routine. Can&#39;t concentrate on the yoga. Think I&#39;ll do one of the other sessions! Perhaps we need less talk but just talk to guide - I close my eyes so much when I&#39;m doing yoga.

It taugh me for the first time to aknowlegde and listen to the needs of my body, which is something totally new for me. It helped me a lot with food related anxiety and made me realise how much my body and my mind were disconnected and I would neglect or hurt myself.

What a letdown :( I am not nearly as advanced enough to “freestyle” and having to watch you move from one asana to the next without any verbal guidance is simply stressful for me since you’re moving rather quickly for my taste already (I am a Forrest yogini). I made it to the end but didn’t find much enjoyment nor relaxation. It feels that my journey home ended with a crash against the garage door. (Alice),Alice & Alfred,2020-01-31T08:00:28Z,1
"Oh no, I&#39;m sorry that you feel that way... Some other people here in the comments have had difficulties with this one as well, so you&#39;re not alone. (I even saw someone saying they always skip the last day, because it just doesn&#39;t do it for them.) Maybe you could pick one of your favourite sessions from the series (or from Adriene&#39;s archives) and finish it off with that :)?

This is my third 30 day journey with you and it&#39;s so interesting how different an experience each one has been for me. This has been the most positive I think as it has been filled with self acceptance and love. I&#39;ve been able to let go of shame for the days that I haven&#39;t made it and felt gratitude for the days I have. What a great feeling to take into 2020. Thank you Adriene x,claire schofield,2020-01-31T07:29:06Z,4

"Wow. What a final session. Got a little choked up knowing that someone else was up at 6.30am and doing yoga with us. Well actually woke at 6am and got my fairy lights ready, my incense and my candle ready....<br /><br />I listened to my body and it felt out what I needed. Was super cool to check with Adriene and Benji as he came to get some TLC. You were cuddling him for all of us Adriene. Did a few extra warrior 3&#39;s and did my own variation of deep yoga squat with cactus arms in my knees and starfish hands (not sure what to call that variation but it FG) also did some boat dips and some extended legs twists (lit that 🔥 in the tummy). Was in the cuctus armed squat and looked over and saw Adriene doing the boat dips I was rooting her on then she looked at the camera as if she could hear me haha <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23magic"">#magic</a>. Then Benji came back for his own downward dog I had to watch him for a second all cute and stuff hehe hope whatever time you do this home session that you enjoy it and love doing it. <br /><br />I had my Bambi pj&#39;s on and was rocking it out. Let&#39;s continue the journey home! In bocca al lupo  (Good luck in italiano) <br /><br />Thank you dear friend Adriene and dear furry friend Benji for helping me get stronger and travel inwards to my true home. Love you both. Don&#39;t forget to give Benji extra rubs and love from all of us. XxxxxxX",Nicole O Scott,2020-01-31T07:24:22Z,0

"Thank you Adriene, and thank you everyone who breathed and sweated together with me. Those last 30 days were very hard for me with a 5-year long relationship that ended and the emotional and organizational turmoil that followed. The word &#39;home&#39; was difficult because my old flat felt hostile and sad, my friend&#39;s place where I stayed felt foreign and empty. But whenever I stepped on the mat, I felt home. I let go of which was no longer serving me and even if it was dreadfully painful I knew it was right and this journey had my back all along. Tomorrow I move into my new apartment and I am just overflowing with thankfulness. You are all amazing and I felt your heartbeats with mine every time I bowed in the end.

"Looking forward to doing this practice a few days later than planned. <br />I got really overwhelmed about a week ago trying to keep up with the daily practice and i noticed my body and mind growing resentful of it.  It started to feel like any other chore. What threw me off completely, was that it the practice wasn&#39;t as helpful as it used to be (f.e. the 30 day yoga journey one year ago)... i just couldn&#39;t seem to shut my mind up. I know this sounds like a cheap excuse but there was just too much on my plate.. or is at the Moment.<br />So i started skipping days. I still plan on doing every video in this journey, simply not by its assigned day. <br />Because I&#39;m not giving up and I haven&#39;t failed just because I adjusted my tempo.... daily yoga is the most beneficial, but know there is still value in doing these practices on my own timeline. Now i just have to let go of my nagging guilt, that i didn´t do what i set out to do. <br />Thank you for everything Adriene. You are the best Yoga teacher i could wish for.",No Barbie,2020-01-31T07:05:45Z,3

Today - 30 days later I’m waking up in my new apartment in a small mountain town in northern Sweden, looking out over the mountains and starting to feel like myself again.

Yoga For Fibromyalgia I don’t agree at all seeing as I did all of them before this. &amp; I think you’re discounting that not everyone is that kind of creative &amp; not everyone can think on their feet as quickly as you.

Yoga For Fibromyalgia that’s very nice for you &amp; apparently a lot of people in the comments but not everyone has the extensive knowledge of yoga to do it with no guide.

"This journey has been about so much more than the yoga for me. It&#39;s been about dancing to my favourite songs every morning, deleting instagram on my phone and journaling every night. It&#39;s been about intense growth in ways I wasn&#39;t expecting. I came to the mat 30 days ago feeling a bit lost about career choices, life choices, the future. But something happened just a few days ago: I listened to my intuition and realised that I already had it within me. For the first time in like forever I feel like I&#39;m on the right path, the path home, and I&#39;ve decided to just go for it. Boldly.

"I just wanted to hop on and say a big thank you for this incredible gift that you give to us all. My &#39;Namaste&#39; at the end of each session is so deeply heartfelt.<br />I am recovering from a neurological condition, I have numbness and crazy neurological sensations in my feet and legs along with some loss of control and weakness. Generally when I step back on my yoga mat my heart sinks and I fill with frustration as I struggle to move in the same way that I use to.<br />With the &#39;Home&#39; theme it has been the first time that I can get on my mat and meet myself exactly where I am without all of the frustration. I am enjoying yoga again, which is huge and have enjoyed the daily practice.<br />I am only half way through, but I wanted to send you my heartfelt thanks. Your work is a blessing to so many people Adriene, thank you for shining your light 💞🌈🌞💞",Liberty Star,2020-01-31T06:37:18Z,68

I am right with you crying! So many emotions! What an amazing journey,Carli Crum,2020-01-31T15:36:02Z,2
"Thank you Adriene. I am so proud that I actually made it to Day 30. I have so much to learn; there are so many flows and poses that I cannot do, but your encouragement even if only from a computer, was the reason I came every day, even if there parts that I could only watch. Now my plan is to go back to your Foundations Videos, to take it slow but to do it daily (you&#39;ve taught me that I can!) to learn and to check in with another 30 Day challenge in a couple of months. I know I&#39;ll see progress. I already have. Wishing you, and this entire community, health, happiness and peace.",Baila Brecher,2020-01-31T06:30:49Z,0
"Made it to the final stop of this journey!! I got emotional seeing the intro. So glad to see you all here as we get off the train at this final stop. I feel like I&#39;ve finally made it to my home along with everyone else on the train of this 30 day yoga journey. The music is so angelic on top of this final practice. It really can&#39;t be any more perfect than it already is. Thank you, Adriene for tagging along with us and guiding us on this beautiful journey through which I got to know myself and my body better than ever. We made it, everyone. Time to celebrate by estanlishing a deeper connection than we&#39;ve ever had before. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2020-01-31T06:28:37Z,11

"I have a couple of days to catch up on (I’ve been going to the studio alongside Home) but I wanted to pop in as this goes up and say thank you, Adriene. The 30 day challenges always get my year off to a good start. You’ve helped me to create a real daily yoga routine. I feel strong and healthy and carry these lessons with me throughout my day-to-day.

"I can’t thank you enough for guiding us in this journey home, Adriene. Every session felt like a breath of fresh air we badly needed in this incredibly stressful month. The calmness and peace you have brought and keep on bringing are unparalleled. Thank you so much, dear one. Namaste. ❤️",gem m,2020-01-31T06:13:13Z,120
"Adriene, I have a travel day today but hope to complete day 30 from a hotel room in Dublin later. I just wanted to thank you for this experience. I have surprised myself, firstly for getting up at 6am every morning to come to the mat (unheard of) but also by how this has made me feel - I haven&#39;t always been able to complete everything but I&#39;ve had a good shot and it&#39;s made me feel much better in body and mind and not just during practice, for the whole of the rest of the day. I am definitely going to continue and have subscribed now to FWFG. Your calm, encouraging manner is so important and your love for yoga shines through. I have enjoyed the &#39;community&#39; feel too even though I haven&#39;t met any of you - I&#39;ve loved finding out how everyone else is getting on! I am not one bit surprised that you have exceeded 6 million subscribers - you are very good at what you do and you are making a huge difference by offering this gift of free yoga to people across the globe - it&#39;s amazing! And then there&#39;s Benji who is adorable too. Anyway, thank you again Adriene and namaste xx😍🙏🧘‍♀️",Ally Bally,2020-01-31T06:10:30Z,0
