I send you a gentle reminder today to give the thinking mind a break. This practice gets right to it. Don’t think too hard. Begin with your breath and the rest will unfold.,Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-27T14:27:07Z,705

"It has been a long journey for me. During this 30 days I had the worst asthma crisis in the last years (ironically this journey is called Breath). And today I&#39;m so very very happy to get back and finish, even a little late. Yoga become a refuge for me that I can&#39;t live whithout. I have no words to thank you Adriene, it&#39;s been hard to be brazillian and you gave me a lot of confort &lt;3",Mayra Solano,2021-05-08T16:02:39Z,0

"I read so many comments saying they&#39;re struggling, or can&#39;t do it. I do BJJ, and it taught me that it&#39;s about learning and improving. So much pressure to be a blackbelt in your first class and it&#39;s absurd. This is how you master a skill. Hard work, dedication and discipline. I can&#39;t do half of these poses because I am a beginner. Day 26 and I can do a pretty good downward dog and my wrists no longer hurt. With daily practice, I can only imagine what I&#39;ll be capable of by end of year. Stop thinking you need to be a superhuman when you first learn something. Enjoy the journey :)",Belle Princess,2021-03-28T08:01:40Z,0

"I’m really struggling with pain in my lower back, particularly when we do a forward fold then roll up or flat back. My chiropractor said not to do forward folds as the gravity is pulling on my back which is no good for me. He said I have chronic nerve damage from an incident 14yrs ago. Almost every video form your lovely self has a forward fold. What can I do? Or am I doing something wrong? Xxx",Simmone Taylor,2021-03-20T09:49:41Z,0

Yoga with adriene has become a very big part of my life.

"Did this yesterday and here are my personal observations: 1.  I&#39;m finally starting  to better understand the different types of breath and appreciate each of them. 2. For some reason, I always question my form on cat/cow. I have a short torso and I can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m doing it right by watching the video. I&#39;m having a lot of pain in my neck in that pose. 3. Who knew it would be so difficult to bend one leg while keeping the other straight in forward fold? I dont have an issue with it in my lunges but found it to be extremely difficult in forward fold. Anyone else? 4. WiLd ThInG!! I did it! I was proud of myself for figuring it out, even if it was shaky or if I couldn&#39;t get all the way up on my toes. 5. I feel like the downward dog to one leg up into the lunge was my strongest point. 6. This practice left me feeling strong, rejuvenated, and self-aware.

Then I want to control circumstances in order to experience it. Through this practice I&#39;m learning  that it&#39;s not a narrow path, happiness is everywhere and in every set of circumstances. I think that&#39;s what joy is, and I&#39;m so grateful to get to experience it.",Blackheart F.C.,2021-02-25T15:25:34Z,6

"Day 26:  Here&#39;s how I know I&#39;ve been learning more than the technical physical techniques of yoga this journey.  Sliding up into rockstar pose was _hard_.  It was deeply confusing to figure out what I needed to do, and difficult to get my body to do it.  I wasn&#39;t sure what was going on.  I don&#39;t think I did it right.  And I _didn&#39;t get angry about it_.<br /><br />Not at myself; not at the practice.  It was hard.  I noted it, and I dealt with it--I breathed in, I paused the video, I tried it and then tried it again, and I did something that worked, mostly, more or less.  It was pretty far from perfect.  I&#39;m not upset about that fact.<br /><br />Just for that, this was all worth it.  For the chance to be bad at something without fury.  I&#39;m so glad.",Clarity C,2021-02-09T18:56:14Z,0

"The yoga for me begins before I get on the mat.  It begins when I clear my mind and pick up my yoga mat. Instead of thinking to myself,  I&#39;m gonna do yoga, I say to myself- I&#39;m going to get on the mat.  That helps me imagine a place of tranquility rather than a moment of tough work. Hopefully that helps someone.",bluscorpion,2021-02-04T17:48:53Z,0
"Today I am grateful for my partner who knows I have been struggling to get myself off the couch on days off.

"I got a little bit behind on my 30 Day Journey at the end of the month, because I was moving back onto my college campus. (COVID Note: I go to a small liberal arts school in a small town, so we are able to maintain COVID-safe social distancing, and everyone on campus is regularly tested for COVID-19. Our campus is also at 3/4 of its normal capacity, so all students can have a single room, and we maintain a strict mask-wearing policy. I take COVID very seriously and I just want to be respectful to the folks who have been impacted by the virus.) I found myself feeling bloated, lethargic, and tired after all the stress of traveling and unpacking. That said, getting back into this practice was just what I needed to feel rejuvenated and at peace in my body once more. Thank you, Adriene and Benji!!",Rosie Mae,2021-02-02T05:47:18Z,1

"Day 26 - accomplished! Over the course of this challenge I learned that I&#39;m actually pretty bad at listening to my body, so now during practice I&#39;m trying to focus really hard on my sensations and go very gentle with twists and other things like that, trying to figure out how to make it feel good instead of just sending myself head first into it",Ruri Takanashi,2021-02-01T08:11:50Z,2

I fell down, it is sooo late, I am struggling with the heat... but I am so proud I showed up. I really and truly showed up for myself and didn&#39;t let myself down.

"One of my big take aways from this 30 day yoga journey (my first) is &quot;a little goes a long way.&quot; Having practiced yoga for many years in traditional class settings, I have always felt like I needed to participate in a 60 or 90 minute class to feel the benefits. I now see how much value/benefit there is in committing to a daily practice with shorter sessions. The length doesn&#39;t matter as much as just showing up. So glad to have had this shift in thinking. Looking forward to the rest of the sessions this week!",Erin White,2021-01-28T04:50:23Z,0
"i almost didn’t do this today after a long day of work and class, but i got on the mat at 11:27pm and i’m so glad i did. i was able to pull each leg through from downward dog to a lunge with barely any adjusting (something i’ve never been able to do) and that is a win for me. this series has helped me SO MUCH with my mood, day to day posture, flexibility, and breath control while jogging. can’t wait for tomorrow 🥰",Bryn Dippold,2021-01-28T04:43:54Z,1

"Adrienne, I have to thank you for the gift of this journey! This month has been exceptionally challenging for me. Following you through this journey, discovering the power of focused breathing, has helped me navigate my personal storm almost daily. Yesterday I was in the dentist’s chair for three hours. As he was drilling away in the back of my mouth, I focused on my breath. I counted in for 8, out for 8. I repeated the mantra: my anchor is my breath, my breath is my anchor.” I focused on breathing down into my torso, and up and out, visualizing the circle or cycle of my breath. I reminded my self to relax the muscles of my face. I focused on lifting through the front body and grounding through the back body. All of this while the dentist worked on grinding my tooth away. When I lost focus, I forgave myself and re-focused. <br />You have taught me all of this! My dentist was amazed and thanked me for being such a good patient! 🥰 I think I will repeat this journey through February! Many, many thanks!!<br />Namaste",Sheri Lynn Davis,2021-01-28T02:19:37Z,0

I just love it and need it like I need my breath!! It’s so special and so are you! Just wanted to send you some love and thanks and that I’m here! I also finished listening to that podcast that you shared! Loved it!! Thanks again!

"I would love it if in the future (after covid of course) if we could start having other diverse body type people join you in videos sometimes. I have a belly that gets in the way of a lot of moves, and that’s my biggest obstacle to some of the poses. For example, just the first two postures of this video were difficult for me. Seated forward fold and bringing my one knee up to try and hook my opposite arm around it... almost impossible for me to do without cranking my body around in a weird way or not being able to breathe comfortably, and I know that those two things shouldn’t be happening for me to get the most out of the yoga. But sometimes I’m not sure what kinda of modifications can give me the same stretch or at least give me something that will serve me in the same way as the posture you’re offering. I still try my best.",Rita Hodges,2021-01-27T22:03:20Z,0

I am so happy we are doing this together. Also, today its my birthday and this practice helped me celebrate not the fact that I am getting older cause thats not the point but it reminded me to honor life. Honor that everyday I am getting up and I am able to do things that we  are taking them for granted and we shouldn&#39;t. We should be grateful for each day we here.

"Today I decided not to do yoga because I‘m on my period, and if you‘re a woman you probably can relate to that lol. Also just got some bad news with the electricity in our apartment and turned out that we have to pay at least 2x as much as planned so we turned the heating system off so we can save money. (I live in Germany, it’s currently 3 Celsius = very cold) Anyway I was under the bed sheets at 9 pm suffering from my cramps in the cold, and was thinking that I have to write in my diary that I haven’t completed today, (in January I started to write diary daily as ‚post yoga activity‘ and I haven‘t skipped a day since then) and started to think about, that tomorrow is going to be also pretty cold and I am going to have cramps, and Adriene wrote in the email to not to skip today, and I started to watch the video and was like. You know what? I am going to show up. I modified a few poses, but I am very proud of myself for completing today‘s practice.",Csenge Kovács,2021-01-27T21:08:00Z,0
"I think it&#39;s so sad that there have been less and less views after each day of BREATH. Day 1 had 3M and today&#39;s practice not even 200K...Just goes to show that not everyone chooses to show up for themselves or this community.

"Hey Adriene, I love your videos but sometimes it would be equally meaningful and inspiring if during savasana you gave us a few seconds of silence. I feel like all the talking really distracts me from finding actual stillness both of the mind and the body. I get that you aim to encourage us to come back the day after, but maybe you should trust us as well, as we trust you, and give us the gift of silence. I think all the talking should be done during the introduction of the practice, not during those moments that are supposed to be peaceful.",amareggiate,2021-01-27T17:57:19Z,0

"At the beginning of these 30 days I was really struggling, I lost my 12 year old dog and best friend to pneumonia in November, she’d struggled with her breathing for quite a while and had survived pneumonia a few times, so concentration on my breathing brought back the sad memories of watching her struggle to breathe, but as the days have gone on I seem to have become calmer and stronger both mentally and physically. I now conjure up more happy memories of our time together (doing agility displays and tricks to music and just chilling round the house and garden as she got older )than sad ones and I’m enjoy coming to the mat every day again, she used to sit and watch me like Benji so I enjoy seeing him too! xxx",Judith Glover,2021-01-27T17:51:04Z,1

I always remind myself that the hardest part is showing up, I’m also a runner and it very much applies there too.

"Had to go back and watch the moment when Benji joined for his own downward dog - aaaaaah!!!!! The cutest. My comment is actually for yesterday&#39;s &quot;Love,&quot; practice, but it connects to today. I did it with my dog and partner pretty late in the day and we all had low energy... and the giggles. I ended up laughing, falling onto my mat and my dog, and just listening to the last third or so of the session while I cuddled up with my dog, Jamie. As I listened, I realized, &quot;This is yoga, too. Letting your body do what it needs to. Releasing. Falling. Laughing.&quot; Even though I wasn&#39;t &quot;doing the poses&quot; with Adriene, I was listening to my body - not out of laziness or complacency - but out of delight and truth.  Gotta love yoga.

And even though I have never met you, I love you, because you have helped me to move when I wasn&#39;t able to get any other movement due to health issues I have been trying to figure out for a few years. I am so thankful because I am finally getting stronger - with just a little bit each day- I think that&#39;s what I was always missing - the small consistent HABIT!  So thank you Adriene!!  I pray God blesses you!",Peggy Hinds,2021-01-27T16:24:01Z,0

"Thank you so much Adriene, I really appreciate you. My body feels lighter and stronger, I am floating up my three flights of stairs now instead of trudging and panting. I can see how a daily short yoga is more beneficial than a long weekly one.

Benji&#39;s downward dog made my day💓,Laura Brattstrom,2021-01-27T15:40:18Z,0
I started out by thinking these are so short compared to yoga practice I&#39;ve tried in the past like 60-90min power yoga but the difference is that I&#39;m maintaining more consistency and showing up for myself each day (sometimes missing 1-2 but catching up later) I appreciate you slow steady and short approach to showing up because that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been lacking is the consistency and this makes it possible without giving an excuse not to get down to it. Thanks for the gentle push Adriene :-),Brian Marquis,2021-01-27T15:39:45Z,0
Benji behaved like a paid actor when he came and striked his down dog. Must say he did it to show Adrien like &quot;who&#39;s the boss of this pose&quot; 😅😅,Unfiltered,2021-01-27T15:37:52Z,0

I am so new to yoga but I thought it would be great to start the new year trying something different. I’ve been showing up every day but today felt like it was the first day and I couldn’t do anything. Balance was off and nothing was flowing. Does anybody else feel like some days are harder than another?  I just can’t seem to get to the pose before she’s on to another one. I don’t feel like I’ve experienced the day’s practice like it was meant to be. 😔,Carey Leacock,2021-01-27T15:18:53Z,1

"Unfortunately, I missed a couple of days and didn&#39;t do any Yoga for about 5 days, things were a bit complicated and I was stressed out so i couldn&#39;t show up every day. I was telling myself to quit because I&#39;m already so late and that I can&#39;t keep up, but then I thought &quot;so what if i missed a couple of days? it&#39;s not the end of the world&quot; and thankfully I decided to continue practicing. Yesterday I did two practices and today as well, and I&#39;ll keep trying my best. Even though I&#39;m a little bit sad but the good thing is that I&#39;ve learned that Yoga is not a task that I have to check at the end of the day, it is the journey itself. I&#39;m sorry for my English, It&#39;s not my first language. Anyway don&#39;t give up everyone let&#39;s continue practicing together, see you tomorrow! 🥰❤️",SANNIE,2021-01-27T15:14:42Z,0

"I get a little nervous everyday before practice &quot;Is it going to be too intense? Too hard?&quot; But then I think back on the other practices that made me think the same thing, particularly Discipline which surprised me, and I remind myself to surrender to the journey. No reason to stop before you know what&#39;s happening. I have no reason not to join in our global daily practice and see what today is all about. And if things are hard I can adjust, always, but usually I end up surprised, surprised at where the journey goes, at how much I can do and how eased the anxiety is when I surrender to the journey, to the practice. Surrender isn&#39;t a passive thing but active... something I reflected on following today&#39;s practice.

I am starting to get it! This daily focus on my breath has increased my awareness of my breath throughout my day.  I am guided more and more by my breath instead of my &quot;monkey mind&quot; of to-do lists and self-chatter. I put a note at my workspace that says &quot;nadi shodhana&quot; to remind me to take some conscious breaths.  Loved the Wild Thing at the end! I never did it with one leg straight - what a difference.,Deborah Collins,2021-01-27T13:56:58Z,0
You are correct. I can do this! Thank you for the gift of 17 minutes today. I appreciate it so much. My core is getting so much stronger. I love you all. Listen to me... So mushy. Have a glorious day!,Penny Kazmierski,2021-01-27T13:55:28Z,0

"Dear Adriene, I would like to thank you so much for these 30 days of yoga. It&#39;s has been truly life changing for me. It helps me physically and mentally immensely. I will stick with my practice after this. I will download and buy your app. I need it in my life. I am so thankful for you. And it&#39;s very inspiring to read comments here. This community is a blessing. 🙏😘 Namaste. 🧘‍♀️",Eva Nováčková,2021-01-27T13:48:15Z,5
"I loved todays practice. I just had a challenging conversation at noon today and my head was all over the place. Today&#39;s practice brought me back into the moment and has given me energy to refocus for work this afternoon. Benji provided several giggles with his downward dog, then taking over Adrienne’s blanket. Thank you. 💕🐕🙏",Jessie M,2021-01-27T13:48:15Z,0

"You can experiment by lifting the upper spine/shoulder area by placing your head on something. Lift the floor up to you. You can place forehead on a yoga block or two, or a stack of books. If you have some pillows, stacked blankets or towels - that will work too. Likely there is restriction around scap, shoulder, trap - but lifting the head could help bring some ease. Through regular practice this can alleviate. You will know when it does by checking in with the breath and feeling that it is easier to take that full inhale. xx",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-27T15:48:43Z,1

Beautiful - 5am here in the Bay Area. The expanding of the Full Moon coming and current stormy rain atmospheric river feels like a huge release. This practice gave me a wonderful full feeling of release and expansion. I feel so alive and awake today. Thank you. Many of the twists felt like a ringing out of the weight I am carrying emotionally. I loved todays expansion practice.,Krystal MacKnight,2021-01-27T13:39:24Z,1

"I somehow forgot about “wild thing pose” I did back in 2015 Halloween and so much fun and today felt so different in a very open, calm way head to toe. Must be the breath brought into the practice. Also doing breath ratios before starting today. Feeling the sunshine as it rises this beautiful chilly morning. Lots of love to the YWA community!!!!",Teresa Gutierrez,2021-01-27T13:35:49Z,1
"This practice!!! <br /><br />I felt so empowered, at 68, doing this practice! I worked on that hand knuckle clawing thing; kept grabbing my breath back in the forearm plank and hip thing; and so proud that I went into wild thing with no fear! Ok, so I went to fast into that lunge and totally lost my balance! This taught me, that for me, slow and steady is my jam.  <br /><br />Thank you Adriene for this amazing community  experience.  The support each day is there in the universe, though I don’t see anyone else in “class” I know there are literally thousands w me .  I pass thousands exiting from across the universe as I and my classmates are entering heading to our mats.  <br /><br />I will miss this experience.  I of course will continue w a daily practice, it just will have a different vibe.  Not bad just different! ❌⭕️❌⭕️",Dee Dee Lynch Silverstein,2021-01-27T13:35:20Z,4

I managed all of today&#39;s practice 0 but had to pause a few times since I can&#39;t move that fast  especially into shapes never tried before.  But even getting one front foot forward with long legs takes longer than your video.  Still good. Thank you.

"I started doing Yoga with Adriene back in June and I remember being frustrated that I couldn&#39;t do flip dog in 30 days of Yoga. It seemed completely impossible to me at the time. I felt so disheartened. So I was nervous when I saw it was coming up again today, but I did it! This practice really has made me stronger, in so many ways. Thank you so much Adriene, for getting me there but also teaching me to patient with myself and my body in the process.",Sophie Mullen,2021-01-27T13:22:27Z,2

"I put my hair in a ponytail for the first time in this practice. I&#39;d always thought it would bother me in savasana, lying on that lump in the back of my head. But I followed my instincts, as I&#39;m learning to do through this journey. To my delight, the knot was centered in just the right spot at the base of my head and savasana was like a mini spa vacation! it was as though my past self (from 30 minutes ago) gave a gift to my present self, and as I felt that special love, my eyes welled up. I love this 30 day challenge, and I can&#39;t wait to find out what&#39;s next!",Andrea Jones,2021-01-27T13:21:11Z,1

"The focus on breathing seems to stay with me during my day.  I find myself periodically, pausing to take a deep expansive breath to calm the chatter in my head or breathing into the little aches and pains that one gets when you&#39;ve collected a few years.  Or sometimes, just take a deep breath to feel alive, present and aware. ......que Adriene singing.......aware and I care.",Marisa Dean,2021-01-27T13:17:14Z,58

The message that it is ok to be where  I am and following the video exactly is not the point, but showing up and listening to my body is the point, I am really internalizing that well this time. Forced to due to the pain in my right shoulder, but determined not to let that derail me from the habit and all the lessons being shared. It is about so much more than the poses. The relationship with self. Thank you!",J. Clock,2021-01-27T11:13:42Z,2

"After over a year of daily yoga, and my 3rd year doing all the January journey in January, whilst gradually increasing how much yoga I did until I made it a daily habit I can see how far I&#39;ve come with some poses!<br /><br /> Some I used to try then have to sit out or heavily modify. I still have a long way to go but I can see how far I&#39;ve come, I&#39;m much stronger, more flexible in good ways (I have EDS so I have to be careful not to overextend) and my pain seems to be improved. When I was in my early 20s I would struggle with the pain I felt in mornings climbing just a few steps to my uni studio space, now on good days I can manage it up the 5 flights of stairs to get to my flat and mostly just be out of breath with less pain than those few steps before.  <br /><br />I take so much joy that one I&#39;ve warmed up a bit I can now get my feet flat whilst doing a downward dog, such a simple thing, and boats are (usually) now my friend and I can do side planks the whole time without collapsing. I hope this year I can finally get arm balances, little by little I&#39;ll work my way to crow! 💪<br /><br />Thank you for sharing yoga with us Adriene, for being our friend (along with Benji) on the mat and cheering us on. Thank you for reminding us how to breathe with this journey, improved breathing is something I&#39;m taking off the mat as well and am feeling so much better for it. <br />Lots of love x ❤️🌱🧘‍♀️🌈",Vic Treveil,2021-01-27T10:41:28Z,0
"Well, that didn&#39;t go too well... I didn&#39;t know it was possible to have a panic attack during yoga practice, but apparently it is. I won&#39;t go into details as I don&#39;t want to trigger anyone, but I&#39;ll just say that after an agitated night, and being mostly fine this morning, I was doing ok-ish until the Wild Thing pose. I then stopped and waited until forward fold. I went on with the practice until the panic attack was too intense to even hear what you were saying. I stayed in Savasana until it passed, letting it wash away and starting to breathe deeply again. Not too much else to say about this practice, but I&#39;ll obviously try again another time.

So all caught up...those twists from downward dog were a challenge..I had to sit and watch you to work it out in my brain..I think I might have done it in some form. I liked the feeling of strength in my arm and the back stretch so much I did it again at the end. Now I’m toasty warm. But I did have a jumper on throughout!

"This is one of the earliest practices I&#39;ve been up for and so I had a couple of dizzy spots and had to make a few modifications (just a product of me being so eager to roll out of bed onto the mat and not allow myself to wake up fully haha). BUT I was getting grumpy with myself and considered walking off the mat in the middle but just managed to stay on. <br />It can be such a stuggle sometimes but it&#39;s like Adriene is a mind reader, her words at the end of each practice seem to always be perfect for that moment. When Adriene said &quot;you did it, you showed up, wow&quot; I felt so proud of myself for sticking with it on what was probably my most challenging day. <br />In the future though I might stay in bed for a few more minutes haha!<br />Thanks everyone, sending love!",ChloeLucy2511,2021-01-27T07:35:28Z,4

@Life with Nicole Walking or cycling is great &amp; low impact. Or HIIT workouts if you like the intensity. Combine with calorie reduction &amp; nutrient dense foods to create a deficit &amp; you should be laughing! Best of luck 🖤🖤🖤,hannahmitchell87,2021-01-27T15:12:25Z,1
