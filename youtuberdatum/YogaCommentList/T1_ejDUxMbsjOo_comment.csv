"So here’s a strange thing... In child’s pose I’ve started to feel like a child! 🤣🤷🏻‍♀️ I had feelings of childhood memories, smells/olfactory memories and playful sensations/excitement from when I was much younger. It was such a lovely feeling. That’s the best way I can describe the experience. It was very fleeting, but wonderful! <br />I’m loving this yoga journey so much! ❤️❤️ much love to everyone! Here’s to finding and caring for our inner-child along this journey! 🙏🏼",Rae Lou,2021-05-08T06:06:44Z,0

I hate to hear what y’all are going through over there as there are parts of the US that are experiencing what you guys are, too.. unfortunately, I genuinely believe it will all not go away until the ppl stand up &amp; unite together in taking a stand against this tyranny. We the ppl hold ALL the power. There is more of us than there are them. Also unfortunately we have been so programmed &amp; dumbed down into believing we are nothing so, I feel this is all going to take time but just remember.. WE hold the key to when this shit is to end. I hope &amp; pray more &amp; more ppl wake up to this truth &amp; start standing up for themselves, no one is going to save us we must save ourselves. We HAVE to find our strength again &amp; we HAVE to do something about all of this &amp; stop complying w such tyrannical draconian orders mixed w SEVERE psychological manipulation &amp; warfare bc the longer we don’t? The longer we got to deal w this shit &amp; the rougher it will continue to get....<br />prayers to you guys over there, love..🌻💛💚",PiPER McFEiSTYS,2020-11-16T20:18:30Z,1

"I&#39;ve just started this routine to help me calm down during all corona stuff and goverment madness since my anxiety and depression started to act up again. I love the vibes of your videos. Some positions are harder to me, especially since lockdown 1.0 I&#39;ve been stuck at home all day and my flexibility is on a minus level (it even suprises me, but oh well, quarantine weight gain). <br />But I love the warmth of my body after workout, the nice tingling sensation meaning I did that, I followed all video the best i could. And your voice, the whole experience is amazing. <br />I love you, your videos and Benji being absolutely calm and chill during your workouts. Thank you for this!

I like your style Adriene but the practice is a bit too fast. Also there is no way to do this without  also watching the screen as your instructions are incomplete. I have a stiff neck from trying to see what to do on the screen while also completing the pose. Suggest you have someone do the workout next to you with her eyes closed or her back to you so that you can see how hard it is to follow your clues. They are definitely not instructions.,Nicole Rosenberg,2020-09-16T01:02:47Z,0

Just started 3 days ago. Have been doing yoga with Adrienne for years and did another 30 days of yoga last summer. So far I&#39;m loving this one. And last night I had a terrible night&#39;s sleep so when I saw this practice was called Awaken I was very happy 😊 Thank you Adrienne...

The lockdown is stressful and there is a lot emotionally weighing you down but suddenly you&#39;re moving your hands and slapping your butt and everything feels fine. I&#39;ve tried a lot of different meditation apps and yoga videos but the energy on this channel is just so positive. And because I feel better I look at my body and believe that I do look great. There were a lot of times yesterday where I reminded myself not to be in a constant state of reaction and just breathe, because of yesterday&#39;s practice and after setting my intentions. Thank you for sharing this with us. I truly appreciate it and all the people who are going through a journey here.",Rhea,2020-05-09T14:25:04Z,63
"I thought some of you may find this story interesting...while I was participating in this practice...almost to the halfway point, I&#39;m looking into my aquarium and see my Chinese Algae eater, Wanda, messing around with another fish under a tree trunk hide.. at first I thought she was trying to go into the tree, which she usually doesn&#39;t do, but I saw her go in once before. This time I noticed the other fish squirming around like &quot;Bah, leave me be, Wanda!&quot; When I take a deeper peek, I see it&#39;s an Upside Down Catfish we purchased  MONTHS ago and I thought was long dead because I didn&#39;t see it, except for a few days after, since! They&#39;re extremely elusive and usually only come out at night to feed. Talk about AWAKEN! :D <br /><br /><br />Adriene, you&#39;re the best.

"I am new at yoga. I find Your videos really helpful and great for the beginners. I have two concerns only, maybe I will share them with You so that it&#39;s helpful for the future. 1) there are two 30-days challanges and really I am sometimes confused, about which one I am doing 🤔 I recognize by the background, but what if background will change??... 🙈🤷‍♀️ 2) for non-English tounge people like me, sometimes You&#39;re explanations of changing asana are not so clear, so I am getting confused and I have to watch You all the time, whish is kot very helpful during the exercises. I found it a little bit harder to understand comparing to some other chanels. Nevertheless, I am really in love with Your challenge and with Your persona, and I will stay here. :) Wish You all the best and I hope I will do some prpgresses over the time.

I actually have a question too: I&#39;m a bit heftier 38yo guy (on my channel there are couple videos about me talking, if that is too vague) who&#39;s just done some weight lifting now and then, and I really don&#39;t bend to all the streches, although I&#39;m doing my best. I intend to make through these 30 days, but as your (anyone&#39;s) experience, does this month make it easier to yoga all in all, or is added streching needed? Or is it just gonna wear me out for the yoga? I know it sounds odd, but these simple poses really make me huff and puff and sweat like in a sauna :D Actually worse than in a sauna.",Niche VideoStudio,2020-04-21T21:15:31Z,0

"Day 3: my heart was telling me to awaken love and connection to the physical world. Being inside so much makes everything feel kind of fake, like if i reached out to touch things my hand would just pass through them. When you said to listen to what is speaking deep inside myself, I was reminded to recognize the physical sensations of things around me, and my physical self. <br />I hope nobody&#39;s bothered by my little entries here as a I go through the videos, I guess you aren&#39;t supposed to talk much about yourself online haha",kynn,2020-04-21T02:41:01Z,1

This yoga journey as well as other pieces of my life have enabled me to awaken to myself, who I am and how I am. The things I appreciate in life and the things I value. I appreciate breath. I appreciate movement. I appreciate pushing myself. Today I learnt that perhaps I am already more awake than I had previously recognised.",rylea jayne,2020-04-17T23:58:30Z,0

"Just finished Day 3 with you Adriene! I&#39;ve been doing random videos with you for 2 weeks now. It&#39;s difficult, I&#39;m not gonna lie. Certain areas are sore every day but I&#39;m pushing thru! My breathing is always a bit labored during and after, but I&#39;ve never been physically fit, so that&#39;s to be expected. I have to admit that my thoughts are constantly circling around how stupid I look and how I&#39;m doing the poses wrong and not doing any of it correctly so I&#39;m wasting my time......... I hear these thoughts, I can&#39;t stop these thoughts, and I&#39;m trying my best to ignore them!!<br /><br />I force myself to continue the practice even if my hubby or kids walk in on me.

I started practicing with Adriene again and the pain is back, I went to studios too where they can check if you do it right and thw pain never come back.

I am 39 and was once very athletic but have gotten to the point that my lack of flexibility is a major deterrent and cause of injury when I try to be active now, I very much let work take a priority to my physical and mental health.

I am only 3 days into this journey and already feeling and seeing a difference, although my relationship with yoga has just begun I know it will be a lifelong practice.

"Heyy Hello Adrienne ! Thank you so much for your work, this is a great gift from you to us. I wanted to suggest you something : I was thinking that you could maybe let more silence in the exercices that are repetitive. For exemple, I thought that knocking on heaven&#39;s gate could have been more intense and conscious if we were practicing this movement in silence, only hearing the sound of our hands on our hips.

"@mapple34 Hello! Since that comment, I&#39;ve managed to do a whole month or so of yoga almost everyday. But I stopped since the quarantine started here, which really affected my mood and I just don&#39;t want to do anything :( I know it would be better for me if i started doing yoga again, but it&#39;s been a bit hard. But during the time i kept up with my practice, my posture got better and it was like my body was moving with more flow, or something like that. Since I stopped, my posture got back to what it was and I feel like I&#39;m 90 years old. So I really need to get back to the mat lol",Kuroi Neko,2020-05-21T14:30:24Z,1

"Nope this was a big nope. Doing yoga on a Friday night with my brother just the other side of the wall, coming in every minutes isn’t the ideal.

"I wanted to give up when I started falling over, but I decided it&#39;s best to take a break instead. I restarted a section over where we had to grab our foot with the opposite hand so I get a better feel of how it&#39;s supposed to feel. I finished an am currently joyed about it. I did this day a little later in the day since I am a college student, so my body is a little tense, but in a good way, because you are helping us build endurance so we can move forward towards more intricate positions.",Kayla Naomi,2020-02-25T01:17:07Z,0

After doing yoga for about 4 months with you my back started hurting out of no where.  I had to go back to get another MRI and found out I had 2 stress fractures.  My chiropractor told me not to do any backward extension and cobra and updog are really bad for my back.  What can I do as a replacement? Love your energy and I want the healing benefits of yoga like a lot of other back pain people.  Wishing you the best!",Emily Souther,2020-01-27T10:21:00Z,0

Coming to the mat helps me ground myself and be in the moment and realize that life is not a race but a journey, these realizations were really needed for me since I just graduated and haven&#39;t found a job yet and sometimes feel like I&#39;m being left behind in life. But practicing with you makes me calmer and I thank you (and Benji) for that! ❤❤❤❤",Sneha Sood,2020-01-25T08:46:42Z,0

"Laughing right now. Spent the whole session wondering “what is she talking about?” “What is this awakening?” At the end Adriene  says something like “we focused on awakening, if nothing else your body got a great stretch” and I think “yes! For sure! At least there is that”. And then she drops the four letter word. From the heart, sweetly and without presumption: “I love you”. I start sobbing. And laughing. And think “oh, maybe this is the awakening part”.",Jennifer Greenberg,2020-01-08T16:33:57Z,868

"Hey Adriene, I love your Videos and am really motivated to finish the 30-day Yoga challenge . Unfortunately I got sick 2 days ago and now a tough Sinusitis keeps me far from enjoying downward facing dog :-/. Can you tell me how long the video will be available on YouTube?

After today&#39;s practice, I realized that &quot;catching up&quot; isn&#39;t the point.<br />I will get to day 30 when I get there, and it&#39;s okay if it&#39;s not with &quot;everyone else.&quot; <br />This is my practice and it doesnt need to match anyone else.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been following you for years now, I got into yoga from a class I took in college, and your videos are the only ones that really, truly bring me the peace that I used to discover in my early yoga days. Unfortunately, my practice has been inconsistent ever since that class concluded, but I&#39;ve forgiven myself. Thank you for sharing your practice with us.",Kaylee Levonius,2020-01-06T20:11:00Z,63

"Adriene, thank you for being in my life. Seriously. You&#39;ve been here for me for 5 years and whenever I need to be healed. This 30 Days of Yoga practice &#39;Home&#39; is very special for me because though I&#39;ve known you for 5 years I&#39;ve never started to do a routine that takes 30 days to finish. I have gone through a lot in 5 years; depression, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, worst nightmares, getting stuck with bad version of myself every time I try to get better and those therapy sessions which I talked about my love for Yoga. You put Yoga love in me, Adriene. I hadn&#39;t realized how Yoga is a part of me. Now after very worst years, I still haven&#39;t connect with me properly, yet. Today was a hard day. I couldn&#39;t wait to get back home and do &#39;Awaken&#39; part. I cried at the end of the routine. I wanna be better, the best version of myself. I know I&#39;m worth it and I know everybody who came to their mats with hope is worth it. We are strong enough to be the best of ourselves. Although I cannot complete what I&#39;ve started mostly (which seriously one of my biggest problems), I&#39;m gonna change it with &#39;Home&#39; practice. I&#39;m taking this road to discover my Home and I&#39;m so happy that I&#39;m doing it with you. It&#39;s never too late to go Home, let&#39;s start this beautiful journey.",Gigo Pataki,2020-01-06T18:12:21Z,0

"I&#39;m a couple of days behind, but I&#39;m not going to stress about it. I&#39;ll catch up as I can. I really enjoyed this practice, and I have to say the music you chose for this series is incredible. Every time I hear it I feel like we are about to do/just did something really epic like in a movie. Idk how to describe it, but I really dig it! &lt;3",Sara D,2020-01-06T07:43:33Z,0
"I was feeling frustrated with this practice. Couldn’t seem to find balance, struggled with my hamstrings during downward dog and my hands kept slipping from the mat. It’s days like this where there’s a desire to stop but then after there’s a sense of accomplishment. And that’s what keeps me coming back to yoga with all of you right there beside me.",Brittny Paz,2020-01-06T06:58:57Z,0

"In Australia, stressing myself while watching the bushfires. I’m not near them but air quality is constantly smokey. So much of this country’s fauna and flora has gone. In some areas there are barely any insects to feed the birds that survived! So after a day of that, I finally got to Day 3 before bed (after Day 4 was released!) So glad I did, even though it was about being awake it helped me focus, which was my intention for Day 2. Thank you for posting these. Time out and focus is so important during times of stress. 🙏🏻",May Lyon,2020-01-06T03:20:19Z,0

My husband has a heart condition that he was now told he cannot do his aerobic classes anymore, so I suggested he join me on this journey with you. I am thrilled to say that he is loving it, and he already feels the benefits. Thank you for who you are, keeping it real, and bringing us back.

"As I rose to standing with my hands together at my heart, I could feel the prana pulsing through my being, my physical body shaking, my soul ignited, like a spark held to old kindling. A surge of emotion took over, and after taking in another deep breath, I surrendered to the emotion and began to cry.<br /><br />So there I am, body trembling, sobbing, breathing, being. For a moment, I was so caught up in this surge that I completely forgot about where I was and what I was doing. I cannot recall a time that I have felt alive in this way before. It stirred up an intriguing curiosity that I am so excited to explore. <br /><br />Tomorrow will mark my 250th consecutive day of YWA. My journey has been indescribable. I am so eternally grateful for you and all that you share with the world, Adriene Mishler! <br /><br />This practice made me feel, in the truest and sincerest of ways, awakened.<br /><br />💙🙏💜 Namaste",Blazin' Skywalker,2020-01-05T22:57:50Z,0

"Dear Adriene and Community, <br />I fell in love with YWA with a Valentine’s workout in I think, 2014. I love the 30-day journeys. I recently stopped doing yoga for about six months, following a tough breakup. I took up running instead. I probably needed the yoga even more then, but I was already spending too much time in my head. <br />I am so happy to start the year again with YWA and a 30-day program. The progression and flow are always inspired and at the end of the 30 days, I know I will exalt in the blessing. <br />I am on Day three as I write this and now, it is time to let my inner and outer worlds come together. I am ready to awaken and yes, I have shortened muscles and stiffer joints but the YWA effect is immediate.  I am now ready to find again what feels good and get rid of the stagnant! <br />I am already standing taller and feeling better, my body awakening, connected to the whole, and coming home to a better me. <br />Thank you for the guidance and the community. I do feel like I have come home to a real worldwide community envisioning and enacting on the creation of a peaceful yet challenging adventure into a better future. It gives me great hope in these highly volatile political times.  20/20 vision. <br />Thank you Adriene and Benji for all the life-changing moments you have accompanied me through.",Dawn Spectre,2020-01-05T20:00:51Z,7

"Does anyone else have a pet that involves themselves in their yoga? My cat loves yoga time. She loves the mat and is a master yogi. Today she was weaving through my arms and legs when we were doing the tabletop balancing, purring so loudly. But then she laid underneath me at the same time I went from plank to cobra and she did not appreciate that haha.

"Does anyone have tips for relieving wrist pain while doing yoga? <br /><br />I’m pretty much a novice in yoga but, I very much want to start doing yoga daily! However, during today’s practice, i had to continually stop the video to give my wrists a break because they hurt pretty badly. I think it might be from the pressure on my wrists accumulated from trying to keep up in doing this 30 day yoga series as they come out.<br /><br />Any advice would be greatly appreciated! ❤️",Zoey Jaramillo,2020-01-05T18:44:53Z,0
"I love these yoga videos and appreciate everything Adriene does to bring people together and give a positive and impactful outlet. For me I struggle with staying in the present moment and staying focused, the world will pull me this direction and that direction, and I always want to help when I can. However, I have my own goals and aspirations I want to accomplish and sometimes that takes sacrifice, such as not doing what I would like to do for pleasure to work hard hours toward my goals. Nevermind the feeling of trying to accomplish a real life goal (such as advancing your career) when going through an existential crisis. These videos remind me that everything is okay, and that this time is only temporary, and that there are thousands of other people out there that are sitting right here in this moment watching this video and doing this yoga practice with me -- working on themselves too.",Emanuelle Andrianopoulos,2020-01-05T18:18:14Z,0

You should be proud of yourself.  You have created a phenomenon of health and wellness by sharing your talents and being you.  I feel like I’m on a parallel path and that the time put into something you love and believe in does bare fruit if you stay true to self and consistent.  I started working my business in 2014 and it is finally bearing fruit.  Keep doing what you do as it helps productive creative people like myself stay healthy so we can keep sharing our gifts.

"When I did this video last night, I was exhausted. My family is going through a stressful time right now and on top of that we had our last holiday gathering for the season at our house with lots of people. I did not want to get on the mat. I just wanted to go to sleep. I love hosting people and gathering in community but I also find it incredibly draining as I work towards healing myself from hashimoto&#39;s. But my husband encouraged me to get on the mat and I&#39;m so glad I did. Usually it takes me days to recover from an event like we had yesterday, and I woke up this morning feeling almost back to normal. This is the reminder I needed, to awaken to nourishing myself instead of collapsing into indulgence. How I move through and out of stressful situations makes a world of difference. Thank you for the gifts you share with us Adriene. I&#39;m so glad that I was introduced to your work. It is thoroughly healing.",Abbi Pratt,2020-01-05T14:21:38Z,0

Quick question... is it normal that you feel a burning sensation (it&#39;s not really BURNING!!! but a warmth) during the breathing process in your nose while doing yoga? Sometimes it&#39;s making me sneeze a couple of times... is that normal?<br /><br />I really loved the part that we were swinging with our arms! that was so much fun!!,inara1233,2020-01-05T10:07:50Z,0

I haven’t been as in tune with yoga the past year, and even the last two days I found my mind drifting and not getting out of it what I should have or needed.

I have 8 children and at home yoga is the only way I would be able to make a yoga class.  So thank you Adriene for all you do!

"Thank you so much Adriene for being so humble in your examples. I’ve been doing yoga with you for a year now and I was so daunted by the thought of it but you’ve always made it feel easy and so inclusive. Sometimes I notice you not put your feet flat during downward dog (or similar things) and it occurs to me that you could totally nail all poses but you don’t because we’d feel crap about ourselves! I love the idea that the best teachers teach by who they are and what they do - how they choose to move through life - more than what they say or the knowledge they impart.

"It’s amazing how quickly the body remembers! I have been pretty sedentary for the last two years, after actively doing yoga and working out prior. On day one, I could not do a downward dog. Today I did that AND I was able to reach around and grab my foot while on my hand and knee(don’t know what that is called). I can’t believe how my muscles almost immediately have woken up!! Looking forward to tomorrow!! Thanks Adriene🥰",Jeri Lynn Vizzi,2020-01-05T02:29:15Z,0

"I had a goal to comment every day that I practiced the 30 day journey with you all this month.  This is my first day commenting so I&#39;m a little late.  Something is off with me and I would normally find something to distract me from this discomfort.  A new (and likely unhealthy) relationship, a stupid decision or dabbling in some kind of drama.  I&#39;m not doing that this time.  I&#39;m going to sit with this discomfort and process it for once.  I already feel stronger physically and I know this 30 day journey will lead to positive, forward progress in all areas of my life.  I am thankful for this community.  See you tomorrow.",jjldaisy,2020-01-05T02:17:00Z,0
"Good for morning session. It awaken our spiritual perception on all the three planes - physical, vital and mental and unites our willingness to live and generates vitality. It awaken dormant powers within the body. It&#39;s strange because recently My spirit was disconnected from my body and immediately of other feelings took over and another presence took the direction of the operations. It stirred up a lot of things in me and this practice helped me so much. Do these 30 days is very special to me. It&#39;s like a new start.

"In April it’ll be a year that I committed to doing yoga with you every day. <br /><br />And today is the first day I got an emotional reaction to the practice. I started bawling like 10 minutes into this one. I just lost a dear friend in a tragic way. I’m trying to find a sign from him. On what to do. And I’m hoping one day he’ll come to me with the answers. Until then, I’ll keep practicing hoping he hears my cries. Namaste.",Nadia Nanette,2020-01-04T22:38:12Z,0

"This is my first time running through the program after hearing coworkers talking about it the past couple years. I’ve done a tiny bit of yoga in the past - enough to not be a complete beginner which brings confidence to find strength in my body and to know I can do certain things and have a foundation to grow with others. Adriene, you are such a good and soothing person. My anxiety has been terrible and I’ve had anxious feelings throughout each day’s workout because showing up brings its own set of fears, along with my stormy soul. Lesson is that it’s okay for this to not “cure” those feelings but to know that I can still move my body even when my mind is screaming and stagnant all at once, and that there is a kind presence weathering the storm with me. Thank you.",Sam Goldstein,2020-01-04T22:35:49Z,0

I love Knocking on Heaven’s Door! Haha. I was feeling great laughing and then I stopped and cried. (Currently detoxing emotions because my thyroid is suddenly under active).. Anyway. I am currently in the process of waking up. It has been quite a process and I must say a struggle to accept what it is and what must be. I have even gone as far not that long ago where I had some of my “sleep paralysis/lucid dreams” where I fall right out of bed and hit the floor in the dream... and I realize it is a dream and then wake up. Then it continued a few more times within minutes of each other. What am I trying to tell myself? I have been listening.,Leah Kelley,2020-01-04T22:26:10Z,0

"feeling awakened! I am loving doing yoga everyday! this is the first time in my life that I am starting and sticking to a yoga practice! One small thing - does anyone else get bothered by the loud music that ends each session? I always feel great as I lay in the last pose and most times I would love to continue to sit in all the good feelings at the end of the session, but the music is really jarring - so may even say &quot;awakening&quot; haha.

"Hey, long time no see, &quot;Knockin&#39; On Heaven&#39;s Door&quot;! I felt stupid like I always do with that move, but I laughed and it did awaken me. Today&#39;s practice awakened my energy, which is something that I really needed but also have been craving for quite some time now. Perfect!!! It wasn&#39;t too much but it was just enough, especially since I&#39;m doing it before going to bed. I messed up the warrior pose - I usually go into it in a much better way. My back and neck were a bit too painful on the first downward dog/bent knee/arm move so I gave up.

Day 3 and I can already feel this in my abs and shoulders and I am excited to what day 30 will bring! You are AMAZING! I wish you were closer!",Crystal Faust,2020-01-04T19:58:00Z,1

"On January 2nd, my boyfriend broke up with me. We&#39;ve been together for 5 years, and honestly, I can&#39;t seem to find a sense of life without him. I feel like my world has shattered to pieces. The only thing that has kept me remotely sane for these few days are these practices. I&#39;m deeply grateful with Adriene and this community, for being there for me. I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll ever be together again, but for now, I want to be better, for myself. I really hope to find some light within all this darkness and pain.",Daniela De Leon,2020-01-04T19:49:35Z,2
that sucks. <br />from my experience it gets easier after the first 6 weeks. let&#39;s do yoga together until then. you will feel better again. &lt;3,Robopecha,2020-01-04T20:26:58Z,1

"Hey Adriene and the YWA community!! I’m so excited to be joining everyone for this journey. I’m hoping to get some help with the supine twist in today’s video. I’m not sure how to improve, but my knees wont come all the way to the ground without lifting up my opposite shoulder. Thus, my opposite ear doesn’t touch the earth like Adriene says. Any advice for this pose?",Clara Mikhail,2020-01-04T19:37:55Z,0
"Oh, thank you, Adriene!<br />Missed Day 2 yesterday, meoww! Today was a hard one for me, and in the evening I made my way home with an intention to eat some yummy things and hide from everyone. But I decided to save myself and turn to the support of the body through yoga, and succeeded by diving into Day 2 and Day 3 in a row, rebuilt inside myself the INTEND, and then fully experienced the AWAKENing. <br />At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejDUxMbsjOo&amp;t=09m50s"">09:50</a> I just started singing, at the top of my voice, shaking out all the rubbish of the day, relaxing and really waking up - WOW, that was incredible!<br />I have been with you for several years, and I have found real support in these lessons, and I&#39;m immensely grateful to you. With each new lesson, I learn to hear you better, to hear my body, and to realize how yoga works. And I&#39;m sure - that is only the beggining of the trip to myself.<br />Thank you for what you do for all of us, thank you for everything you share with us. <br />Namaste ❤️",Christina March,2020-01-04T19:35:30Z,0

And the laughter awakened and have been giggling ever since. Life&#39;s messy but fun and unpredictable. This definitely awakened a sense of don&#39;t take things so seriously mindset. &lt;3",Tea Hržica,2020-01-04T19:25:49Z,3

"Not gonna lie, this has been really hard. I suffered whiplash back in September and it&#39;s been such a burden on me. I have lost a lot of mobility and have frequent soreness. This caused me to stay away from most physical activity for the months since then, whereas before I would exercise and/or practice yoga sometimes 2 times a day, every day of the week. I&#39;m challenging myself to do this, but also to be gentle with myself. I&#39;m finding my body stiff and not as limber as it used to be just a few short months ago.

Started in a bit of a fit as I couldn&#39;t find my migraine meds but started anyways and I think the knocking on heavens door was going to be the death of me at first but I think I must have spun the thing right out of my head. Hope I didn&#39;t spin too much else out. When we were standing still afterwards i had my eyes closed and I had the feeling I was looking into a sort of vortex in my minds eye. Awakening? xo,claire nicol,2020-01-04T18:16:32Z,0
"Did day 2 really late last night after coming from a shift that ended at midnight. Phew! I think with the theme day 2 - intention - and with having a series of intentions (overall and for the month - I WILL be disciplined and intentional with my time; I WILL complete 30 days of yoga with Adriene in January) guiding me, I&#39;ve found that there was very little resistance and more presence overall during the practice, even though my brain was a bit scrambled to hone in/focus on anything specific for my late night day 2! Slept like a baby after, though. <br /><br /><br /><br />I made it out for a 5k run today and did day 3 after, which was the perfect combination, as my body was already feeling alive and joyful. Today&#39;s theme made me reflect back on when I first started Yoga with Adriene. It&#39;s startling to realize how numb inside I once was; words like &quot;awakening&quot; can be a somewhat abstract concept, when you&#39;re in that &quot;sleepwalking&quot; phase. Yoga gave me the glimmers that led me to a more intuitive, felt understanding of what it means to be awake in our life. I wish this for every human being, a gentle dusting off of our old patterns, to shine the light in the dark places, and walk through with more wonder and awe.  <br /><br /><br /><br />And it progresses! This - using the YouTube comments as a sort of written diary of my journey - is an interesting change for me! I&#39;ve long been a lurker in online spaces. As I continue the journey of awakening, I choose to participate and create, knowing that my contribution is worthwhile :) <br /><br /><br /><br />Lastly, sharing this Ram Dass lecture - &quot;It&#39;s all yoga&quot; - <a href=""https://www.ramdass.org/here-and-now-142-yoga/"">https://www.ramdass.org/here-and-now-142-yoga/</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />Namaste, y&#39;all!

"Hi Natalia, maybe you would benefit from the dancers&#39; technique of spotting. Pick two points to look at, one on the left spin and one on the right spin, then keep your eyes at those points as you spin (switch between the two). If your eyes stay on these spots (you can turn your head), the dizzyness might stay away.",wandering Inge,2020-01-05T11:44:46Z,0

"Maybe it&#39;s a breath of fire, perhaps a set of stairs to heaven. I&#39;m actively  reaching out to gain a better understanding for those who wish to remain in my life. They&#39;ve all expressed a want to, but for me it&#39;s going to take a clear source in providing the info I wish to really. I&#39;ve had more than a few conversations with like minded others in the last month and I&#39;ve concluded that I&#39;m not insane, but instead frustrated with explaining a different point of view from that of their root views. MY life wasn&#39;t supposed to be this Buddhist or Taoist to begin with and after doing simply for others to understand that their issues aren&#39;t issues at all, and then having it turn into a gritty situation because of my stubbornness I&#39;d rather just sit in a quiet space as they learn that I&#39;m only trying to help. <br /><br />Namaste! I hope for some good Parana to awaken a silent mind.",eric wade,2020-01-04T17:42:46Z,1

"What was awakened?  I have practiced yoga, almost everyday, for about 4 years, and today I had a revelation/awakening regarding breath and movement.  The breath doesn&#39;t only guide the movement, it also initiates it.  This ties into my intention as well (patience).  I recognized that if I waited to move until the next cycle of inhale or exhale started, the movement became fluid and soft.  Thank you and Namaste!",Patricia Tiernan,2020-01-04T17:29:48Z,0

Good morning :) I wanted you to know that I consider yoga one of the greatest gifts I&#39;ve ever recieved thus far in life. From the ability now to control the chaos that once was in my head. To the crazy change in flexibility. I wanted you to know that you have been there right from the beginning. I&#39;ve been following your practice from the start of my journey and everything I know. Everything I have gained through yoga I&#39;ve learned from you. You are the most amazing beautiful soul and I just wanted to thank you!!! You don&#39;t know how much this stuff means to me. Your 30 day challenges are fire and I get excited every January when a new one comes out.  You have my love and my light Adrienne. Thank you :),Jordan Jarocki,2020-01-04T15:30:01Z,0

"Good Morning! This is awesome. It worked out for me to do yesterday&#39;s session before bed. Then this one when I woke up, with a meditation in between. Taking this time for me and with me is part of my awakening.  I love merging the inner me with the outer me. Even though I modify most moves it&#39;s all good and working in my way! Feeling good sure feels good despite any uncomfortable  circumstances. Thank you is not enough  Adriene for how you bring this to the people.

I woke up feeling very resentful and annoyed as I did not sleep well last night due to my roommate being loud (we share a room). This practice totally turned my mood around and I was thinking about waiting until later in the day to do my practice.  I&#39;m so glad I pushed my self to start the day by awakening my physical body as well as my energetic body. I feel more grounded and positive about the day ahead! Day 3 in the books!

"Hi First, thank you for all you do.  Id like to comment on the music in the beginning and end of the videos... Because I have a baby asleep in the room next to me, I have to keep the volume down and since your voice is quite low in the video during the practice, I have to raise the volume higher than I normally would.  The issue Im having is with the music coming on with a sudden loud noise, and after every practice I have to immediately jump up and shut the volume off before the baby is woken up by it. So I never have the chance to just enjoy the moment at the end of the practice on the mat.  Before you used to have the little guitar instrument ditty and it was a low, soothing sound, but more recently the music has become much louder and upbeat.  Id appreciate it if youd consider matching your new melodies to a similar volume as your voice so that there isnt this dramatic uptake in volume.  Thank you so much again for everything you do!",Lianna Faruolo,2020-01-04T15:09:35Z,1

"Good morning all. I love this practice. Day 3 in the books. Still so many things I cannot do fully but I am also seeing myself more able to do some other moves. I find closing my eyes to make things much easier for me. I know that over time  I will be able to sit on my legs in baby pose, jump to front of my mat not waddle there, step my feet into lunges not have to help them and be able to have both arms palms on the mat on either side of my thighs during lunges. I know I will be able to have my knees and thighs touch while on my back on the mat and my knees touch the ground when reaching across.

I&#39;ve been practising with you since 2016 and what keeps me coming back to it? Your inner sunshine - it&#39;s brighter than anything I&#39;ve ever seen.

"A little Rumi for my fellow yogis on the theme of Awakening: <br /><br />The breeze at dawn has secrets to tell you.<br />Don&#39;t go back to sleep.<br /><br />You must ask for what you really want.<br />Don&#39;t go back to sleep.<br /><br />People are going back and forth across the doorsill <br />where the two worlds touch.<br /><br />The door is round and open.<br />Don&#39;t go back to sleep.<br /><br />:)<br /><br />p.s. If there are any other new moms taking care of an infant at night out there, I feel like this theme is even more powerful as we&#39;ve surely been literally awakened countless times during the night and now it&#39;s time to metaphorically awaken. :) Sending you love and support!!",Joyce Ragard,2020-01-04T12:43:21Z,2

"Awaken feels very appropriate at the moment. I live in Canberra, Australia. We are moving through the most severe weather and landscape fires that we have ever known. The sadness is enormous. And so is the desire to awaken, to truly see what is happening and respond. My finding what feels good is to awaken to the reality that there is more I want to do. To live in true love and connection I am stopping buying anything with plastic, finding work arounds or simply letting go of certain things. It feels good and painful to awaken in this way.

"Yesterday the word &quot;level&quot; came to me during Day 2. This word now sums up my intention for the month (and beyond) and what I want to awaken. I&#39;ve been living in my mind a lot over the past year, and am prone to overthinking and anxiety. I pictured a spirit level inside me that&#39;s always there for me to connect with, even when sometimes my emotions and fears spiral. I find that idea really comforting.

Day 3 check ✅,Lisa K,2020-01-04T08:52:07Z,1
What I really love about yoga in the morning is that when I step on the mat and do the first forward fold I feel super stiff and my fingers can hardly touch the ground even when my legs are bent. And when I step off the mat my muscles feel so soft and I feel so flexible and can easily touch my nose to my knees with straight legs.<br />That&#39;s why I usually liked doing yoga in the evenings a lot more because I felt like getting into all the poses was so much easier. But it&#39;s actually the poses itself that awaken my body so much quicker in the mornings than it would usually take without doing yoga first thing after getting up.,Julia,2020-01-04T08:52:03Z,1

"@Michelle Downs idk if you want help. Your decision and choice. I&#39;m just throwing this out.<br />Fibromalgia often happens after prolonged issues with your gutmicrobiome/guthealth/bileproduction issues ending up with gallbladder issues leading to nutritional deficiencies fkin you up more and more. <br /><br />Here is what you can do without me explaining you tons of shit.<br />1 do a waterfast, if u are on a good ketodiet 3 days migjt be enough, if you eat carbs daily you need 5days minimum but feel free to go longer if you feel no hunger<br />2. Refeed with bone broth and cooked veggies, go very slow.<br />3. Stick to an antiinflammatory diet with 0 gluten or dairy for 3 months. Eat slightly cooked veggies to almost every meal and eat a plant based healthy omnivore diet semihigh in healthy fats. You should add here aswell oxbile/pepsins/betaine hcl after every meal since your bileproduction is shitty anyway. <br />You need to stress your system after that aswell. Cold showers, sauna, hiit and gym and yes it doesnt matter what age you are. <br />This is a marathon, it took decades to get you into this mess. 3months to fix your gut if done right. Another 3 to slowly absorb, so first benefits might come along at 7months. But if they start they will fix a lot in your body. You will feel probably great at a 1month mark if you did the waterfast, but there it is important to not indulge into old habits. <br />Good luck and trust your system way more.",A.

"Never in a million years would I have ever thought I would practice yoga. I am a big big guy (6&#39;3,234) ex football player. I do a lot of power lifting. Yoga has helped my mobility so much with my lifts and flexibility and ability to heal. I have never been this flexible and this pain free. I&#39;m a combat veteran as well so I struggle with a alot of PTSD. Yoga helps me find my center and jusk be ok with everything.

"@Manik Sharma it looks like you didn&#39;t finish my responce and you typed yours not seeing what I meant in my first comment so I&#39;ll write this part again - its about doing this particular practice in this particular time. It wouldn&#39;t be the same if I did it an hour or a day later. <br />I get all you say, I really do and I have the same thoughts but let&#39;s just stop this hilarious conversation 😂 <br />Have a good day 🙏",Mer lin,2020-01-05T09:32:29Z,0
"@Mer lin Well, firstly, excretion is not random, it&#39;s a process of cleansing your body, much like yoga and it&#39;s more essential than yoga. Secondly, if you start thinking the same way you do about what you seem to think as &quot;trivial&quot; daily tasks being done at the same time, you might have more reasons and occasions to feel connected with people across the world. <br />And I chose the process of excretion to drive my point because it&#39;s probably the most difficult to accept. You can pick up other routine processes like breathing, sleeping etc to speculate on. Those will be easier for you to &quot;digest&quot; ;-).",Manik Sharma,2020-01-05T09:20:13Z,0
"@Manik Sharma well, it&#39;s quite funny when the one person is amazed of feeling that right after Adriene publishes a video sees about 400 views which means this many people around the world woke up early just to do the practice in the same time and the other person&#39;s first thought is about having a sh*t. Many people eat, have a shover, workout, drive to work, a and you only think about sh*tting 😂 It&#39;s not about thinking if some people do the same random thing in a random hour as you do, it&#39;s about this particular practice, in this particular time.<br />So... happy sh*tting 😆",Mer lin,2020-01-05T08:55:24Z,0
