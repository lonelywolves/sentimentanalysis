this isn&#39;t yoga it&#39;s a workout video. yoga is very slow and more of a stretch rather than jumping jacks. it was a good PE video but it&#39;s not yoga. yoga isn&#39;t about building strength it&#39;s about peace and balance. this is very much building strength. that isn&#39;t yoga that a workout.,Sam Lee,2021-01-19T19:35:37Z,0

This offering has nothing to do with yoga because there isn´t a sparkle <br />of qualities inside this video Patanjali is asking for. Has this woman <br />got a real serious education in the surrounding of real yoga? I have my<br /> doubts about this. I can see only an egoshow of a pretty girl. Nothing <br />more and nothing less. And YouTube is full of this nonsence people are <br />calling &quot;Yoga&quot; where is no yoga inside.,Musik Liebhaber,2021-01-01T13:19:47Z,0

"Hey Adrienne! First of all, I love your yoga workouts and your personality! :)<br />I would love to do more yoga, but I always feel insecure about my form since my posture is so terrible. It’s not my shoulders but rather my neck which looks basically like the one of a turtle. Even if I try really hard and stand in front of a wall, my neck won’t go into its natural position. I was wondering if you could make a video on this - since this forward head posture is something pretty common nowadays due to us sitting so much in front of our Handys or laptops... <br />It would mean a lot to me if you could make a yoga workout especially for this issue which I could then do every day before school or if you could simply give me some tips on how to change my posture when simply trying to stand up straight and bring my head back isn’t really possible anymore...<br /><br />Greetings from Germany! :)<br />Paula",P 21,2020-10-15T13:03:51Z,0

Hi Adriene. I love your videos and am so pleased that you&#39;ve got some for students in virtual learning. I work in a special education program with students in wheelchairs and with disabilities that inhibit them from following in the same way their able-bodied peers do. Can I make a request for some content geared toward them and that community? My kiddos have really enjoyed your Yoga at a Desk and PE videos. What about something combining the two?<br /><br />Thank you again. You&#39;ve been such a wonderful resource over the years. Keep doing your thing.,Marlee Leebrick-Stryker,2020-09-30T19:51:11Z,0

To counteract this, a globally-synchronized Mass-Meditation is scheduled at the exact time of the astrological Saturn-Chariklo conjunction (alignment) on Monday, September 21st at 10:08 PM UTC.&quot;<br /><br />A promotional video has been created for the meditation, please feel free to share it far and wide:<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=11&amp;v=i5xT3zNYFWY&amp;feature=emb_logo"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=11&amp;v=i5xT3zNYFWY&amp;feature=emb_logo</a><br /><br />- Guided audio for this meditation has been translated into multiple languages:<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-ujIE4tLGbFLBLlYHr4d61cwZ7gKfe4s"">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-ujIE4tLGbFLBLlYHr4d61cwZ7gKfe4s</a><br /><br />- Livestream starts at 9:45 PM UTC (5:45 PM EDT New York):<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlZKkrfZ94U"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlZKkrfZ94U</a><br /><br />- More details about this information including the exact time of the meditation in selected time zones:<br /><a href=""https://www.welovemassmeditation.com/2020/09/meditation-against-engineered-second-wave-lockdowns-on-september-21st-at-1008-pm-utc.html"">https://www.welovemassmeditation.com/2020/09/meditation-against-engineered-second-wave-lockdowns-on-september-21st-at-1008-pm-utc.html</a><br /><br />Global synchronized meditation at the exact-moment of the Saturn-Chariklo conjunction (where the two planets appear to be close together in the sky) on September 21st is key to offsetting any further attempts at lockdowns.",AstralTraveler,2020-09-21T00:41:00Z,0

"Thanks for this cardio short!  Hubby &amp; I did this one Monday and plan to do the P.E. BODY one today.  I’m 58 &amp; he’s turning 63 Oct. 3rd, and we are both riddled with arthritis, and really have to pick and choose videos we can mostly do.  We started doing YWA yoga a couple of years ago.  I started with a beginner’s 7 day challenge.  On day 3 he came home from work earlier than usual and asked what I was doing.  The very next day he started doing yoga with me.  Back then, we started one 30 day series, then another and it was really helping with our balance and flexibility.  Then one day, after a routine EKG from his primary doc as part of his type 2 diabetes care, an anomaly was found.  Within a week we were in a cardiologist’s office, followed by heart surgery to place two stents.  Since he had no pain, no shortness of breath or any other symptom, that random EKG saved his life!  He had to take a break from yoga for a short time then, and again 8 months later for one more stent.  We’ve been back on regular yoga for 18 months, but haven’t been doing any cardio.  We usually ride bikes, but live in AZ where summer heat doesn’t drop below 108 and hovers for days at a time between 110 &amp; 115.  We’ve had it go as high as 122!  This short video gives us a little bit of cardio, which will help get us conditioned to doing even more every day.  Thanks so much, Adrienne, for all you do!  We tell everyone we can in our retirement community to look you up on YouTube!",Mary H,2020-09-16T20:59:06Z,0

absolutely fabulous - loved this - what a fantastic concept! great if time is tight and a great way to get your heart rate up too. Loved mixing yoga moves with cardio. Superb! Hope you will be doing some more 10 minute videos as it is just such an original idea and I though it was so original. Time is so precious and I liked being able to mix my yoga with some faster cardio training and then to a half hour yoga class with you. Thank you for such a wonderful session...x,Trixie Bradley,2020-09-15T07:14:44Z,1

"I prefer your videos without music - I think music makes it difficult to do those things I learn in your videos when I don&#39;t have internet and I feel that I need something like your yoga. It doesn&#39;t feel as nice as with the video (since something is missing then). In general I think the music distracts us from learning to calm down just with our bodies and being independent of anything else to do so.<br />Don&#39;t understand me wrong, I love music. Just not when it comes to calm down.<br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed the video! You have a lot of positivity :)",Marta Tome,2020-09-14T10:16:37Z,5

"Really fun work out -but I wasn&#39;t prepared for the star jumps! Haha!

"This yoga session was really great! I wanted to do yoga this morning, so when I saw you had uploaded a new video I was more motivated to do so.

"I love you, Adriene, but this I don&#39;t like. You really sound like a PE instructor and the tin music is horrible. Why that? There are so many yoga possibilities to get the heart rate up.

"Great, as usual, and very helpful as an addition to yoga. I have often incorporated PE into my yoga routine because I feel the need for movement. Personally I found the musical background distracting and mentally tiring when it was competing with your voice. Would it be possible to lower it while you speak? I love to follow your instructions, your voice is a good guide, but it gets lost with the music washing over it. Just thought I&#39;d mention it, you might want the feedback. Thanks for the fun session, Adrienne. All the best, big hug!",Sarel Ito,2020-09-14T07:39:27Z,0

However, for the past 4 weeks, I have been bedridden because of blood clots in my legs, a condition called DVT. Doctor has suggested that I should take complete rest and i have not been able to be on my mat for the past 4 weeks. Can you recommend any specific videos/practices that i can do while sitting and maybe something specific for DVT and improved bloodflow in veins in legs?

"@Ayza Khan the monthly calenders are put together from.existing videos, maybe with some new ones released for that month. The 30 day sets like Dedicate are designed as a journey to build each day on what&#39;s before. So they are good to build confidence and experience with postures. I found this yrs a lot more physically challenging, more planks etc so maybe not so ideal for beginners. Dedicate is a lovely one and I found it more a good beginners one. Eyes open is fine for all yoga /- it&#39;s a choice to see if it helps calm, focus or balance but &quot;find what feels good&quot; 🙏",Emily B,2020-09-14T22:43:52Z,0

Only in the pandemic have I come back to daily.  I&#39;m not sure now how many days, since May so 4 months. It&#39;s really kept me going as a covid doctor in my head and for my body.
