"This was exactly what I needed this morning! I did the Breath yoga journey in January and I decided I wanted to switch every couple months what I was doing in the mornings. So I have started dance fitness in February. I realized a couple days ago I wasn&#39;t feeling as happy, strong, flexibility, and like I was &quot;losing my breath&quot;. I realized I missed yoga! I decided I was just going to do different yoga challenges each month. So this month I finishing off with yoga. I am a dancer, and I love to dance. But I think I need yoga in the mornings and I can dance in the evenings/weekends. <br /><br />The fun and child like atmosphere really renewed my spirit today. I love zooming around like an airplane (and going slow too), and grabbing sunshine and clouds out of the sky, making dog noises and shaking my tail, and having my branches grow and leaves fall. The imagery today was amazingly beautiful and I could help but smile and laugh and play this morning!",Melanie H,2021-02-17T13:12:58Z,0

This offering has nothing to do with yoga because there isn´t a sparkle <br />of qualities inside this video Patanjali is asking for. Has this woman <br />got a real serious education in the surrounding of real yoga? I have my<br /> doubts about this. I can see only an egoshow of a pretty girl. Nothing <br />more and nothing less. And YouTube is full of this nonsence people are <br />calling &quot;Yoga&quot; where is no yoga inside.,Musik Liebhaber,2021-01-01T13:23:38Z,0

"Hey Adrienne! First of all, I love your yoga workouts and your personality! :)<br />I would love to do more yoga, but I always feel insecure about my form since my posture is so terrible. It’s not my shoulders but rather my neck which looks basically like the one of a turtle. Even if I try really hard and stand in front of a wall, my neck won’t go into its natural position. I was wondering if you could make a video on this - since this forward head posture is something pretty common nowadays due to us sitting so much in front of our Handys or laptops... <br />It would mean a lot to me if you could make a yoga workout especially for this issue which I could then do every day before school or if you could simply give me some tips on how to change my posture when simply trying to stand up straight and bring my head back isn’t really possible anymore...<br /><br />Greetings from Germany! :)<br />Paula",P 21,2020-10-15T13:02:59Z,0

"Many people are using yoga to de-stress, stretch, and get exercise. The problem is, that is not the actual purpose of yoga. Yoga is a Hindu religious rite, similar to how baptism and communion are religious rites for Christians. Yoga literally means &quot;union,&quot; and the purpose of yoga is to achieve a certain &quot;spiritual awakening,&quot; which a number of people have learned is both dangerous and false.

"The elements of the body<br /><br />There are two main energies: spiritual energy and material energy. Spiritual energy is conscious and material energy is unconscious. The soul is conscious spiritual energy and the body is made up of unconscious material energy. Without food, there would only be the self, the soul aka antimatter with a size of 0.1 nanometer with its shells.<br /><br />According to the Sankhya philosophy, a person&#39;s body is composed of the following 24 elements:<br /><br />(1-5) 5 mahābhūtas (&quot;great elements&quot; - earth, water, fire, air, ether / space),<br />(6) manas (mind, inclinations, spirit),<br />(7) buddhi (intelligence),<br />(8) ahaṅkāra (ego <br />as a result of identification with the body and what goes with it),<br />(9-13) 5 senses acquiring knowledge (indriya - sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch),<br />(14-18) 5 working senses (karmendriya - legs, arms, anus, genital and speech organ),<br />(19-23) 5 sensory objects (indriyārtha - shape / color, sound, taste, smell and touch),<br />(24) avyakta (the unmanifest)<br /><br />The five great elements, the ten senses and the five sense objects make up the gross body and manas, buddhi, and ahankāra make up the subtle body. Avyakta is the basis of both. In this connection of 24 elements sits the individual soul (jivātma) as an inhabitant of the body, accompanied by the paramātma, the oversoul.<br /><br />.With soul and oversoul, the human being consists of 26 elements. Jivātma and paramātma are both referred to as kṣetra-jña (&quot;knower of the field&quot;). The body is kṣetra, the field of activity, and the soul is the knower of the field. But while the Oversoul knows all fields of all living beings, the individual soul does not even properly know its respective body. Through unthinkable long contact with the material energy, the spiritual souls have forgotten their original knowledge and identify with the body in which they are currently living. With the body they try to enjoy by manipulating material nature and exploiting the riches<br />of material nature.<br /><br />These 24 elements are manifestations, transformations of the material energy and exist in and outside the body as constituents of the universe. Their development, properties and interactions are described in various Vedic scriptures and also in the Ayurveda classic Caraka-Samhita. Just as a potter makes a jug out of clay and water, the spiritual soul, under the influence of the three modes of appearance, sattva (goodness) , rajas (passion), tamas (ignorance), unconsciously creates its respective body from the 24 material elements through its inclinations. In contrast to the potter, who knows how to make a certain object, most souls do not know how they made their bodies. They carry out certain actions with one body, cherish certain likes and dislikes, etc. and receive their next body from the Oversoul according to their karma<br /><br />The three doṣas (bioenergies and bioelements), the seven dhātus (types of body tissue), the upadhātus (subsidiary body tissue) and the malas (waste products) contain the mahābhūtas in different proportions. The seven dhātus are:<br /><br />rasa (lymph; plasma)<br /><br />rakta (blood)<br />maṃsa (muscle tissue)<br />medas (fat tissue)<br />asthi (bone tissue)<br />majja (bone marrow and nerve tissue)<br />śukra (sperm and egg cells)<br /><br />The upadhātus are tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, muscle fat, breast milk, menstrual blood and the six layers of skin.<br /><br />The body&#39;s breakdown products are feces, urine and sweat. Hair, fingernails and toenails, ear wax, and other secretions are also considered malas. The malas feces, urine and sweat, ear wax and other secretions need to be eliminated regularly. If they are not properly eliminated, disease will arise.<br /><br />( From the signs and symptoms caused by the increase or decrease in doṣas, dhātus and malas, the doctor can determine which mahābhūtas are required to restore their equilibrium. Then he can prescribe certain foods and drugs (with corresponding mahābhūtas) to compensate for the deficits or excess of mahābhūtas in doṣas etc.)<br /><br />Whether there are other energies and what these are all about can be found in the Srimad-Bhagavatam and other Vedic scriptures.",matthias elsner,2020-09-17T20:43:14Z,0

"The purpose of yoga, first-of its basically three parts one is to use body-weight exercises to warm-up muscles then stretching exercises to make muscles more sumple and flexable then three is weight-exercises again to cool the muscles-down to prevent tissue cramping afterwards (especially for older practioners)...these were invented to recover from &quot;muscle atrophy&quot; caused from long periods of blank-mind meditation, I dont mean hours... I mean 3 or 4 days with a carer to feed the Monk water when needed (this practice was always done inside caves never out-side)...the so called experts could do this for 2 weeks without food only water, which also meant if the carer did not do there duties the practioner would die (it was also a way to loose weight, please dont do this!). For a Monk this was all done to reach so-called enlightenment or an epiphany. Remember this was 1000s of years ago around many locations of world. This synopsis and these exercises we do today have been slightly modernised especially in martial-arts, another good example by adapting these was turning this into relaxation exercises (however they should be done properly to prevent injury!) one is Tai-chi or moving-meditation with the same movements, but usually into animal poses though into modern-times they call this Kung fu. I&#39;m over 50 in age and a practioner of martial arts, Im not a teacher or instructor nor to I claim to be an experts as this is just the basics for which everyone should know!....",David Jones,2020-09-17T07:26:55Z,0

"Coming onto the mat with a huge amount of momentum that I carry with me from the last P.E practice, along with an eccentrically weird ear-to-ear smile that I can&#39;t seem to find a reason for having. We even had a flying airplane today, is just what I needed to at least feel myself outside again. Adriene is excellent as always in all aspects of mind, spirit and attitude. Thank you so much for giving me a genuine laugh with the way you guided the practice Adriene. Stay beautiful everyone. Let&#39;s make the most out of this one. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2020-09-16T05:59:51Z,19
