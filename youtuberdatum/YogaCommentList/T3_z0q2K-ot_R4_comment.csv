"Today was great. I was tired, not looking forward to &quot;Strength&quot; but it was great. I did it all. Feel wonderful. I don&#39;t want to sound like I would not like longer sessions, but THANK YOU Adrienne for finding the right session length. It is perfect, and I can make it daily.

"i&#39;m not gonna lie, I saw the title &#39;strength&#39; and I thought it would be a day with cardio, but no, I love what Adriene said that sometimes we have to find our inner strength while we are still and found our inner peace!

"This is a magic practice throughout the thirty days. Today, something very special at the end which I interpreted like this: the thing about being brave and courageous, and putting yourself out there in the world, is bound to bring us to make mistakes. And when this happens to be still, quiet, gather our resources. An amazing lesson. Thank you Adriene x",moonfruit,2021-04-30T08:02:36Z,0

When I start letting days pass without practicing or working out, then end up quitting. I know it.

"I always started doing Adriene&#39;s 30 days yoga challenges for the past 4 years but there has not been any time that I managed to complete in 30 days, the first 2 times I didn&#39;t even complete. This year due to a medical condition I got to start at March and now it is going great, I am only 2 days behind my own schedule! With these challenges every year I get to observe not only my physically improvement but also how more determined and more steady I become as years pass by and as I become more mature. If there is anyone out there feeling stressed out because they are not on their time like I was a couple years ago, let it go! Our timing only depends on us and the right way we feel, everything improves by time.",Alanay Sude T√ºrkmen,2021-04-08T06:57:39Z,0

"I love how I&#39;m noticing strength building up as I show up to the mat 5x per week (I&#39;m kinda taking the weekends off) my experience today in doing this yoga session proved to me even more that I&#39;m so much stronger compared to when I first started! Reader ‚Äî you might&#39;ve experienced a similar thing, and I&#39;m celebrating you for being here and for showing up to the mat! üéâü•≥‚ú®<br /><br />Quick story: I started practicing yoga last 2018 (with Adriene&#39;s 30 Day Yoga Challenge) and practiced regularly until last year. So like I haven&#39;t practiced yoga regularly for a year or so, then I started with BREATH on January 12, 2021 where I found my limbs and muscles shaking even when simply in downward facing dog. At first, it was discouraging, but I followed Adriene&#39;s advice to follow my breath throughout the practice and focused on how I feel and what my breath is telling me. So one day at a time, I started to build up my foundations again and really enjoy the journey. I&#39;m very happy with where I am today, and I commit to really integrate yoga in my lifestyle even after completing the BREATH journey in a few days from now. ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§ç",Lynelle Suan,2021-02-04T10:49:18Z,2

"I&#39;ve been very reluctant to do this video, as I had a hospital procedure and went on bedrest and this was the first back (with my doctor&#39;s okay). Although my body feels as weak as it&#39;s ever been today, I learnt so much about strength. Moving super slowly and doing the practices in the smallest gentlest way instead of &#39;hitting the pose&#39; taught me so much about self-kindness. Even mountain pose and corpse pose felt a bit much to hold at times, so slow gentle modifications were essential. The stillness at the end and gentle pace helped me learn that strength isn&#39;t all about speed and aggression, but willingness to show up even when &#39;failure&#39; is likely and you feel far behind what seems like &#39;everyone else&#39; in the journey.

Hello Adrienne. I am feeling good as a result of practicing with you through your BREATH series. Last year I enjoyed your HOME series.<br />In between I have chosen a program that felt suitable each time I came to my mat. Thank you for giving us at home yogis a chance to keep practicing.<br />I would like to request that you put together a session on how we can improve our facial and neck muscles.  There is the lion pose and the neck rolls and the drawing circles with the nose. I am wondering if you know of more postures that would assist with toning this much ignored part of all of us. <br />Kind regards Suzanne (Australia),Suzanne Wilkins,2021-01-23T22:36:39Z,1

"Sometimes I can swear that Adriene is there practicing with us. She says some things that resonates so well with what we&#39;re going through, it&#39;s awesome.<br /><br />For example, today at the end she talks about the importance of recognising that we fail, that we are humans, and about how we need to stop, breath, focus, and try again sometimes.<br /><br />I did yesterday&#39;s practice today by the morning, not yesterday (PMS is kicking my ash this week), but I was feeling so low and frustrated with myself that I couldn&#39;t focus. At half of the practice I just gave up at the half of every pose, and wasn&#39;t able to concentrate on anything that I was doing. <br /><br />I ended the practice feeling really really bad. But then I focused on my breath, on my center, and tried everything again.<br />And I did it. Not perfectly, but did it. And then today she talks about failing and trying again. üíï<br /><br />I have nothing to say but a gigantic thank you, to Adriene and to this lovely community üíñ",Bruna Mandu,2021-01-20T23:17:08Z,3

"I&#39;ve never commented before, but just had to say this course has been amazing for me. I have a severe disability - multiple herniated discs in my lower back and neck, even after several surgeries to fuse a few of them. COVID shut down the pain clinic here where I received monthly injections, and as a result I ended up bent over and unable to straighten my back. I thought I might be stuck this way forever. I tried exercising on my own but without guidance or motivation I just ended up hurting myself more. I joined this challenge as several of my friends were doing it, and even though I can&#39;t hit many of the poses (Cobra is far out of my reach!) I have modified as necessary and done the best I could. This is the FIRST yoga practice that has moved slowly enough, with good transitions, encouraging modifications and listening, and on day 8 I noticed a strength I hadn&#39;t felt in several years. The instructions are excellent, this is the first yoga I&#39;ve done in my life that didn&#39;t kill my wrists! I still cannot stand up straight, but I am a tiny bit straighter, and that is HUGE for me. Thank you Adriene for yoga that is accepting and loving and allowing EVERYONE a place. I am already planning to do another thirty day course when this is over, I believe I have found my way back from living the rest of my life bent over and getting more and more disabled as a result. I now have a target to be standing upright within six months! I didn&#39;t know it was possible, and now I believe it is. I cannot thank you enough.",Ruth Savage,2021-01-20T17:17:15Z,0

"Thank you, thank you. As ever, this one has come at just the right time for me. I&#39;ve had my son (nearly 9) in tears today because he&#39;s missing his friends with not being at school (UK lockdown). I&#39;d been nagging him all morning to do his school work so when he broke down in tears I felt awful. I felt like I was letting him down. Him and his baby sister went off to my mum&#39;s and I broke down in tears about it all. I knew I had enough time to get on the mat before starting work and was greeted with your smile and lovely Benji and instantly felt better. I was laughing doing the heel lifts in goddess. And then at the end, in corpse pose, hearing you talk about strength, I started to cry again. But this time saying to myself &quot;You&#39;ve got this! You&#39;ve got the strength to carry on. You&#39;ve got the strength to be there for your son.&quot; It was like you were talking to me personally, like you&#39;d made the video just for me to raise me up.

It&#39;s interesting to be able to look at my apple watch and see how many calories I burn each session. This one I found I did a little more than usual! This was a rough one for me because I&#39;ve been my most sore yet from yesterday&#39;s practice and probably the one before it. I didn&#39;t realize it was that short and paused it a few times (something I&#39;m working on :)). I might even do this one again later knowing what to expect now (aggressive - I know). But I enjoyed this one and am saving it for future sessions. A nice change. Go Adriene! Don&#39;t too many of these though it might kill me =) =),Dani Sibelman,2021-01-20T13:07:02Z,0

I have to remind myself that every day my body is different and that this is a process. It doesn&#39;t matter if I can get into crow or not. What is important is that every day I am showing up for myself and trying. And if I fail all it means is that I tried. Yoga has been the best balance for me in my perfectionism.,Leah Bisson,2021-01-20T21:49:57Z,1

However I wondered if you could give me some guidance/insight on a way to avoid tension in my shoulders, one in particular.  This is a reoccurring pain I get in the front of my shoulder and in my armpit.  It doesn&#39;t hurt when I am doing yoga but afterwards it burns and can become quite unbearable. I just wondered if you might have some insight to help me breath and move into a healing space here.  I have a very stiff body and flexibility is a challenge for me.

"Paying close attention to how you move around, marrying the movement to the breath, even names like &quot;Goddess pose&quot; make this practice so much more interesting and enjoyable. A &quot;classical&quot; workout would have said &quot;do 20 wide squats and 10 push-ups on your knees&quot;. Same exercises, very different approach. <br />I love that Adriene constantly reminds me to think about the tiniest details in my body.

"Ok, wow! This practice made me realize something very important.<br />I&#39;m on my period today and I was already afraid of that day because I still wanted to keep going with this 30 day yoga journey. When I read the title &quot;strength&quot;, my brain told me that I can&#39;t do this today. It was like &quot;Okay, you lost it. I mean feel your body. It feels so vulnerable today.&quot; But I was like &quot;No! I&#39;m gonna listen to my body and just do my best. No expectations.&quot; And guess what? Today I needed less breaks than on &quot;normal&quot; days! Cause I always expect that I need to do it as good as Adriene - even though she always says it&#39;s okay if we&#39;re not where she is.

I don&#39;t have any carpet in my home, and hitting hardwood with the back of your head is distracting, to say the least.",Ruth Savage,2021-01-20T16:57:59Z,0

"Yeah, I&#39;m here for the Lululemon. Vhanged my practice in lots of grest ways. Wrist pain went away, no slipping, etc. Ill try a manduka next time I need one cause I&#39;ve heard terrible things about Lululemon on a social/global level.",Sati Brown,2021-01-20T12:54:03Z,0
"My son bought me a LULU lemon mat a couple of years ago, which I love. It&#39;s the only mat I don&#39;t slip on. Expensive, but well worth it! I had to buy another one when I moved from Florida back to Wales, as I left mine behind, and tried a cheaper one, that they claimed was non slip but wasn&#39;t. It changes your practice when you have a good grip! :))",Annie Dickson,2021-01-20T09:11:35Z,2
