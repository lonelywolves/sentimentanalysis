"Following the April 2021 calendar but instead of doing Yoga for a Rainy Day I found this practice instead! Why?  Because I live in the PNW and it is usually always a rainy day here but as fate would have it, it is a beautiful sunny day here!  I searched for Yoga for a sunny day and this Joy practice popped up and again as fate would have it, It was perfect!  I will save the rainy day practice for another day soon I am sure!

"Hi Adrien! I love you videos. They keep my yoga practice fresh. I was wondering if you have a video of more free movements like the &quot;knocking on heavens gate&quot; that you did at the end of this video? The poses are so important, but I find a big release in the free movement, kind of like Buti Yoga, provide an extra release of tension. Thanks in advance. Keep up the amazing work!

"when I first heard&quot; find what feels good&quot; it made sense of course. BUT after doing yoga with you for months now with no prior experience I totally get what you mean much more fluently. I am beginning to see why you really love yoga and I am starting to fall in love for the same reasons. I am excited to continue doing yoga with you and all the other wonderful human beings that have found their way to this lovely community. and lastly as someone who struggles with substances (just look at my username lol) I also get why you believe yoga is better than substances and I agree. particularly when substances are abused or simply overused it seems it mess with our whole psyche in ways we aren&#39;t aware until we start to notice it, at least for me. and yoga has become another tool for me to peel into and tune into my body, mind, and spirit on a more subtle level. so thank you a thousandfold for all these videos that are making a positive impact on so many lives it is tearbreakingly beautiful and inspirational. oh yeah and as always, Namaste (:",Sublime420,2021-02-21T20:35:59Z,0

"I am so thankful for you, Adriene, &amp; your warm energy that is felt through the screen on my iPad here in Rhode Island. Happy Thanksgiving Adrienne and friends. This channel is what allowed me to love a life of yoga by helping me create “my practice” and throwing out the idea that social media says yoga is about looking a certain way &amp; contorting in painful shapes (giving us another thing to beat ourselves up over). Finding what feels good feels amazing. This community you have brought together is a gift for many, including myself. Thank you",Noelle Brown,2020-11-27T03:20:21Z,1

Hi Adriene. I began following your 30 day yoga classes at the start of the pandemic. I worked my way through each class from 2015 to 2020 and did not miss a day. I now have it as my daily practice at the start of the day. It has been a lovely thing to focus on and I love your relaxed approach.

Namaste Adrienne. On our zoom team meetings people have often asked me to name one positive outcome of this lockdown. My spontaneous answer right from the start has been Yoga with Adrienne! I had never experienced yoga before this. Working out with weights at the gym has always been my joy. Your videos and beautiful narrative has changed my life and perspective! I can see small changes every week. I have a very long way to go in terms of balance and core strength but my journey has begun in earnest.

"I especially looked for this yoga practise as I wanted to rejoice in having such a wonderful day. It&#39;s the start of October and here in Bristol, UK, we&#39;ve started to have a turn of the weather with miserable, rainy days! I had a zoom interview this morning and the sun was beaming so brightly I had to pull down the blinds a little so that the video could capture me properly. The interview went so well! But my point is - I then went to walk my dog and as he was resting in the sun, panting from having chased his ball around, I took the time to breathe deeply and enjoying that, I started &#39;knocking on heavens door&#39;. With the sun smiling down at me, knocking away, my dog abruptly stopped panting, locked his eyes onto me and was likely thinking &#39;...should I help her?&#39; Ha ha! I&#39;m glad I was able to knock along again with you, and everyone else. Namaste Xx",Jasmin,2020-10-07T20:56:51Z,2

"Thank you so much Adriene. I’ve done this practice several times (it’s one of my “go-to” yoga videos), but today I really felt it. Like many of the commenters, I’m writing this in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, which is currently upending life here in the US. It’s in the midst of this that I’m also trying to find a “big boy” job to go with my “big boy” PhD, and of course the search isn’t going well. After a very depressing day of job hunting that left me feeling like an utter failure, I decided to do this Yoga Joy practice and at the end of it, as I was slowing down from Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door and raising my hands to my sternum, something in me just gave way. I felt this small, but powerful, feeling of joy, or release, or gratitude, or some mixture thereof. Tears started rolling down my cheeks before I said our final “namaste.” My problems will be there when I step off the mat, but this small thing that I did for myself will help me face them. Thank you so very much for this experience!",Shawn Watkins,2020-08-04T00:38:50Z,0

"Practicing from St George Utah! I&#39;ve never really been into exercising for the longest time because physical ed classes in grade school gave me bad associations with it, there was a lot of body shaming and the teachers had zero consideration to people&#39;s physical capabilities. But ever since I got back into hiking and biking (a must if you live near 6 stunning national parks within a 200 miles radius!)  I started to like exercising because I was going by my physical capabilities and the beautiful scenery made it so worth it! I decided I wanted to learn yoga as more of a daily physical mindfulness exercise to align my mind body and spirit. I asked reddit for the best YouTube yoga instructor and you came up! I was nervous at first because of some of the body shaming traumas associated with physical education, but I was so pleasantly surprised when you were encouraging me to just go with what felt good, as a result you&#39;ve been a huge positive impact on my journey to self love and body positivity. Thank you so much for all the good you do Adriene, you&#39;re a true healer. Namaste. 🙏",Dissociated Jelly,2020-06-30T23:16:22Z,0

When doing the knocking on heavens door I was tempted to say &quot;knock out anything that doesn&#39;t serve&quot; but then I thought &quot;there is nothing inside me that isn&#39;t good. Everything else is just external noise&quot; 💛 thank you for a beautiful practice,Catherine Seavey,2020-02-21T14:35:54Z,1
"Thank you for this, just what I needed in my first attempt to practice yoga with my puppy present (licking my feet, nibbling the mat, knocking me over as he jumped around me, lying under me during planks and downward dogs, trying to yank the mat out from under me - I ended up using bitter apple spray instead of the usual aromatherapy to moisten the mat!). Happily he gave me as much joy and laughter as he did consternation; and I could still focus on my breath even if I didn&#39;t do all the poses this time.<br /><br /><br /><br />But, question for Adriene: how do you get Benji to be so chill with you when you do yoga? Did you have to train him to get used to you doing floor work etc?",Kate Rogers,2020-02-19T12:38:31Z,1

"I got a bit emotional on this one, which is a first in a long time. When I started your practice I was determined to be stronger. That was about 2 years ago. Since then, I was diagnosed with Ehler Danlos Syndrome. My body is weak, and that gets frustrating, because I look like I should be healthier than I really am. I have a severe pain in my side so I had to take a step back in doing regular planks. Overall I&#39;m just feeling unfit for this world, my reality is surreal, but this practice in particular helped me in having an internal talk to myself.

"This was a wonderful ditty and a nice way to start my rainy Sunday morning! I remember the first time I did knocking on heaven&#39;s door in one of your videos (Yoga for Insecurity?) I felt awkward and kind of dreaded it. Now, about a year later, I look forward to it! Thank you, Adriene, for encouraging our playful sides that we sometimes lose touch with.",blinddog1212,2019-12-15T13:02:25Z,0

I commented on the last video but i thought I get a better chance at getting info on a newer vid. I was in a motorcycle accident 2 years ago. I was wondering if their was a yoga type that would be good for someone who is in my position. And if anyone is curious my accident was recorded and was posted. I spent 30 days in the hospital and another 3 months bassicly relearning how to walk. It was a pain in the butt and I was stuck in a walker with raised arm rests on it to put my weight on my arms instead of my leg. I called it the death trap and it almost got me hurt a few times going to therapy. I was big into yoga before my accident and I&#39;m kinda scared that ibwill hurt myself.,Speeding with Steeto,2019-12-15T06:18:34Z,1
"Hi friend. So glad to hear that you are recovering well from your terrible accident! Check in with your doctor, if you haven&#39;t yet, and follow their advice on which poses to avoid for your particular injuries. And yes, start slow. Listen to your body and don&#39;t push. x",Yoga With Adriene,2019-12-15T14:21:39Z,0
"Hi, I don’t have a specific answer to your question, but just wanted to congratulate you and wish you well as you recover. The only thing I’d urge is for you to take things slowly and really listen to your body. At this point in my life I’ve finally learned to be patient with myself, to trust my body and to just let time take time. I’ll be thinking of you on the mat. ❤️",Raechel McGhee,2019-12-15T13:21:34Z,0
