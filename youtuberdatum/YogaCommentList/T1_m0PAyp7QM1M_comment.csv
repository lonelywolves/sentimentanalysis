"I&#39;m in the middle of my 4th month with Adriene and with yoga in general. Today is the first time that a) I&#39;ve been able to squat on my feet without hands on the ground, and b) put all my weight on my hands and get my feet off the floor [for a few seconds]. I&#39;m 55 non-athletic male and sit at a desk all day and have had torn miniscus in both knees. Thank you Adriene for pushing me to just show up, and to fwfg. SO MANY TIMES I&#39;ve fallen, taken a break, just about gave up, and when I glance at the screen, Adriene is staring straight at me, telling me it&#39;s OK, just take a little break, and get up and try again. I don&#39;t know how she does it. ESP or something.",Daryl Sawatzky,2021-03-12T22:05:30Z,0

"Picking up on Adriene&#39;s question from a year ago....I am seizing the day by getting some self-care in with healthy cooking, cleaning my space, meditating and doing some yoga :) I had a client yesterday that, when I told her I have been doing yoga for 42 days straight, said &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to be able to do that but....&quot; I remember having many reasons why I couldn&#39;t do yoga daily but I have realized...through the 30 day Breath practice...that I need to schedule this in to take care of myself.

"Digging <br />BY SEAMUS HEANEY<br />Between my finger and my thumb   <br />The squat pen rests; snug as a gun.<br /><br />Under my window, a clean rasping sound   <br />When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:   <br />My father, digging. I look down<br /><br />Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds   <br />Bends low, comes up twenty years away   <br />Stooping in rhythm through potato drills   <br />Where he was digging.<br /><br />The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft   <br />Against the inside knee was levered firmly.<br />He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep<br />To scatter new potatoes that we picked,<br />Loving their cool hardness in our hands.<br /><br />By God, the old man could handle a spade.   <br />Just like his old man.<br /><br />My grandfather cut more turf in a day<br />Than any other man on Toner’s bog.<br />Once I carried him milk in a bottle<br />Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up<br />To drink it, then fell to right away<br />Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods<br />Over his shoulder, going down and down<br />For the good turf. Digging.<br /><br />The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap<br />Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge<br />Through living roots awaken in my head.<br />But I’ve no spade to follow men like them.<br /><br />Between my finger and my thumb<br />The squat pen rests.<br />I’ll dig with it.",Majella Butler,2021-02-09T17:54:06Z,1

I would like to remind anyone doing this that it’s okay to miss some days in a row. I intended to do this everyday for 30 days but I stopped this home practise for about a week and today I picked it back up again. I am learning to stay focused and committed and apart of that is falling “off track” we are all learning to build new habits and that can be tricky so don’t beat yourself up if you miss a few days ❤️,Pixie,2020-11-08T10:09:32Z,3
Me too - Thanks for reminding me of this. The carrying on is as important as the taking up. I beat myself up if I miss a few days which is all wrong and probably why I am doing yoga.,anna chipch,2021-01-31T17:32:29Z,0

Today as I went into shavasana I was giggling, so taken by the surprise of how quickly my mood was lifted in 15 min. I&#39;ve had these kind of shifting opinions on yoga ever since I started practicing and I&#39;m really stating to catch up on the big picture, now that I can look back on the last two years and see the way yoga helped me.

"Yoga was tough today. After session I curled up on the mat in fetal position and cried for a while until my dog gave me a little nudge to get up. The ending really hit me and I have so many feelings but no one to listen to them.<br />I&#39;ve always had a lot of guilt and conversations/memories from school building up inside of me but the past two days they really overflowed. I know I have this power and strength inside me that I&#39;ve never allowed myself to use but I still cant help but sit here and wish I was different or that I could start over again. Sometimes I think that even if I got to start from the beginning again it would go the same way, like I&#39;ve gotten too far now and it&#39;d just be easier to erase myself entirely than waste more time. does that make sense?",Jo Jongin,2020-09-16T13:59:32Z,1

"I cried. I&#39;ve never cried during a yoga practice before. When Adriene started talking about how, when faced with fear or vulnerability, we may want to walk away rather than dig in for the sake of something special, that hit me hard. <br />I am a teacher, and with each passing day I have been getting increasingly more anxious and fearful as everyone debates how schools can reopen in the midst of a pandemic. I don&#39;t know what schools will look like in September, but this practice reminded me to dig in my heels in the face of fear and to do what I can for my students and for myself.

"This one was tough for me. I had to get up to do yoga really early due to a busy day, so I was really tired. Plus my joints were really aching, especially wrists &amp; ankles.

"I have practiced yoga for many years, but still, no matter what kind of shape I am in, cannot EVER do crow pose! I even have done Pilates for a year and a half (very regularly) but no matter the muscle tone I build in my arms, legs, and core- crow pose just always seems unattainable to me. I have shed tears over this! Any mental tips for this pose in particular? In addition, are certain body types more prone to having difficulties with crow? I do have petite shoulders and arms, and am more pear shaped. Sometimes I feel like my body just isn&#39;t capable of crow, but I am not willing to give up yet.  BTW I am loving this 30 journey!

"Ok, I&#39;ve made it to day 11 and I&#39;m pretty proud of myself. But when I got up this morning, the weather was too beautiful to stay inside so I decided to venture out to my tiny pond. I&#39;m sitting on my yoga mat, on our old dock, watched by turtles and nosy chickens. It&#39;s lovely until I take my first good, deep breath and realize it <a href=""http://smells.like.dead.fish/"">smells.like.dead.fish</a>! I forgot our pond turned over and we lost fish this week. I decided to stick with it only to have a farmer drive by in a large tractor giving him a good view as I was attempting that crow pose and it was not pretty! Oh well. At least I did have a pond to lean over and gaze into even if I can&#39;t see my reflection in the muddy water.",Shauna Clodfelter,2020-06-11T13:12:05Z,1

I´m so proud of myself after 4 seconds of crow pose !!!! Felt like a lady boss ;) Never did yoga before this journey and it will become part of my life after this 30 days... Corona brought enough time to think about things that I do only for others or because I think &quot;I have to&quot;.... These flows are giving me inner freedom and more radiance. And my singing voice shows the benefits of everyday practice (on my way to be a opera singer ). Just wanted to share my joy :) Hope your journey gives you much inspiration too,Franziska Mörtl,2020-05-03T07:42:13Z,1

And although when you created this 30 day journey you couldn&#39;t have possibly imagined what was just around the corner in 2020 I hope you know how especially meaningful your themes and your words are for us every day during these challenging times. My dog Bailey seems to enjoy hanging out with me during my sessions as much as your sweet Benji does. Thank you for this right now and every day.,ehsteinmetz,2020-04-15T04:27:37Z,1

"I started this 30 day journey admittedly more than 11 days ago, I fell off for a few days, I was feeling uninspired, worn out (mentally) and in all honestly just wanted to lay in bed and watch movies. Tonight I finally got the motivation back in me. Now I don&#39;t know if it was the stretches done tonight or my body craving some yoga but this has been the best one yet. I always feel good after yoga but after this one I felt even better then usual and am left spiritually more... well I don&#39;t know what word exactly but I guess the closest I could get to describing it is closed and centered (in a wonderful way) I feel like tonight I made grounding... maybe it was the rubbing of the third eye or maybe it was the body movements. I usually struggle during some of the stretches, but today everything went so smooth and natural- I can&#39;t wait to do the rest. Thank you Adriene! thank you for helping everyone through these rough times- may you be blessed everyday, along with everyone else &lt;3",alyse rapini,2020-04-14T05:03:43Z,3

"Today&#39;s practice taught me about trust. When we are asked to dig in, we go to a place of trust and unearth  whatever it is we need to. I realised today, during Bakasana (sp) that I lack trust,  and more importantly the strength to pull from within ( to dig in so to speak.) This revelation even made me think about my emotional health and the baggages I carry.  I figured the strength I need to leave behind my internalized but projected scars start  with me, and my body( self care) . I&#39;m slowly learning to love yoga. Thank you for the amazing community. ♥️",sarfoa darfoor,2020-04-10T20:19:04Z,1

"Stuck in self isolation and today I feel very vulnerable and sad moreso than I have thus far. Came to do today&#39;s class thinking NAAAA I don&#39;t wanna dig, saw the video title and immediately thought it was gonna be a hard physical workout. I wanted to do tomorrow&#39;s nurture class instead as that&#39;s what I &#39;needed&#39; but I said to myself no Beccie, this is the class order to do it in. See what happens and allow this class to aid you. <br />At first I was struggling to keep my balance in basic poses and kept telling myself I wasn&#39;t in the right mental state, my body can&#39;t do this, my body is rubbish at yoga. <br />Then Adriene said &#39;dig can be whatever that word means to you&#39; and something switched. I decided to dig deep within and accept how I felt and let that breath move me through positions. All of a sudden my balance became better and I felt more grounded. I managed to do humble warrior and lean right into it keeping my base strong. <br /><br /><br />I ended the session feeling grateful and happy for my body and connected to that power that is so much bigger than ourselves.<br /><br />Turns out I had all I needed like you say all the time Adriene and I did dig deep, digging deep was what I needed today. <br /><br /><br />Thank you x",Beccie Allen,2020-04-06T17:43:29Z,12

"Okay,  I&#39;m gonna have to leave a comment after this one. <br />I&#39;m utterly impressed with myself for embarking on this journey and staying strong up until here.<br />I started out being able to fold down and reach as far as a little over my knees. Today I&#39;m touching the floor(!). <br />Never ever ever have I thought I&#39;d be able to do the crow, and I was afraid of pressing play today knowing what lied ahead of me. What happened? I not just did the crow for a few seconds during the video, but after it I set myself on doing it again and, guess what? Held it for a minute. <br />You&#39;ve worked wonders! Physically and, most importantly, emotionally.  (Adriene, I love you!) <br />Thank you so much for guiding me and so many others into self-discovery and being the best version of ourselves. <br />Cheers!<br />Lots of love,<br />Robbie",Rob Feltrin,2020-03-18T19:24:46Z,0

"[23.02.2020]<br />What a beautiful practice! <br />It helped me connect to myself today and strengthen the roots of self trust.<br />Also I&#39;m chilled now and there&#39;s this peace and silence within myself. <br />Let&#39;s hold onto that and remember those feelings whenever feeling stressed.<br /><br />Do you guys ever feel agressive for seemingly no reason at all?<br />There might be small things like the pouring rain that you can&#39;t control. <br />You find yourself being mad at it anyway because you actually wanted to spend time with friends in the outdoors.<br />Connecting to yourself and thinking about what the worst that could happen might be, lets you smile to yourself. <br />It&#39;s just rain.<br />Your clothes could get soaked and you could get sick but that&#39;s nothing you can take care of later, right?<br />Know that there&#39;s still a shining light within yourself that no wind or rain could ever stop from shining. <br />The sun&#39;s always there too, no matter how bad the weather is. <br />So keep this little sunshine and hold onto all the little presents life gives to you everyday, no matter how small.<br /><br />That&#39;s what we&#39;ve  learned from you, Adriene.<br />Thank you so much and<br />Namaste ⛅",BeyondTheBop,2020-02-23T08:46:05Z,0

"Adrienne, I’ve been down, but I’m making my way back. Have had to have adjustment and xrays. Will have more treatments, but this is the good news:  when I ask my chiropractor if I could continue with my yoga practice, her reply, “Always do yoga, just listen to your body and if you can’t do a pose, simply do what you can.”  I’m thinking I might start loving her as much I love you. Who knows? However, I’m also praying that I won’t have to see her long. Hope to see you on the mat tomorrow and as usual, will cuss you and love you for whatever amount of time I’m there.

"I never thought I could do yoga, but after seeing a few of your videos....I tried.  Then I tried another one and I started feeling really good.

Keeping it real. I got really sick yesterday so I spent half of my day sleeping or just laying in bed. I couldn’t eat or move properly. So I decided to take it easy and skip this practice.

"Thousands of years ago, civilizations would struggle for resources: fresh water being a major one of them. This eventually led to the discovery of the water table: that a layer of fresh water is ever present below the Earth that can be reached from anywhere if you keep digging down long enough. <br /><br />Maybe that is a correlation to the infinite energy that is present within us; if we dig deep enough, we can begin to strengthen the connection to ourselves and create a &quot;well&quot; from where we can draw energy.<br /><br />Even then, sometimes I forget, and get distracted chasing the things outside of myself-- which moves me away from the main journey inward. Instead, I keep trying to dig shallow wells here and there, hoping that maybe I&#39;ll hit water, but end up wasting so much energy in the process by trying to please others or seek validation; instead of focusing and staying the path.<br /><br />I hope that the lot of us will always remember that what we need is always there and that we remember always to try digging in first before trying to dig a well elsewhere.

"I remember being two or maybe three days in and thinking, &quot;Hey, once I get to Day 10 I&#39;ll be 1/3 of the way through.&quot; But now it&#39;s day 11 and I&#39;m digging it (and loving all your puns and jokes and lovely messages and encouragement). You make yoga fun, in a way I never thought it could be. It doesn&#39;t have to be all serious but as a way to celebrate what the body can do. I&#39;ll say, the breathing and stretching and slowing down is harder for me so I was excited to just jump in and get moving today. And then, with the first crouch my knees were like &quot;oh God.&quot; And then my heart dropped a bit seeing that crow pose and wanting to be able to do it, and figuring it&#39;ll take me like a year to do. But then, I looked up your how-to video and I FREAKING DID IT. Multiple times. Looking back at my videos, I totally need to position my knees more centered on the arms instead of at the sides, so I hope I&#39;m not doing it wrong. But I feel strong and sore and tired and I asked Alexa to play Santana&#39;s &quot;Winning&quot; and I felt like a freaking rock star. Thank you so much for these videos; I&#39;m so glad I chose to be a part of it. A decade ago was when I was exercising regularly and in the best shape of my life. Due to recurring leg pains brought on by running and even hiking sometimes, plus my own anxiety, I just don&#39;t do as much as often. With this practice, I&#39;m celebrating coming to the mat 11 days in a row. I&#39;m letting it be okay not to feel pressure to do everything, and accept that something is enough. I&#39;m turning 30 this year, so never a better time to come home to myself and rememeber that I can be strong and that a body that has rebelled against me can still do some pretty cool things. Thank you.",Sam Goldstein,2020-01-13T04:16:59Z,0

I am blessed to still be on this journey and it’s a blessing to be with you any day you are able to show up.",Andie Roise,2020-01-13T03:31:26Z,54

I have become so proud of my body and have practices loving my body more in theist eleven days of this practice than I have in a lifetime.

This practice took my breath away (literally 😂) I’ve been doing this for a good year two years? And I never thought that I could ever do crow pose since I have such a week upper body. Today I did it! It wasn’t perfect and I rested my head on my yoga blocks but I got my feet up off the ground!

"I procrastinated day 11 until 830pm. I said it was because I wanted a lazy day. Or because I needed to shower and didn&#39;t want to shower twice. But in reality, day 11 was when I started feeling like I couldn&#39;t do it last year. I had to make more and more modifications and didn&#39;t feel like I was being kind to myself, and I didn&#39;t feel like I was doing it right. I&#39;ve practised yoga for 10 years on and off, and I&#39;m really finally starting to feel like I belong in this space. I&#39;m so proud of myself.",Errin Watson,2020-01-13T02:57:44Z,1

"Hi everyone, this is my third year doing the 30 day practice. I am now 74 years old and I would love to hear from anyone else near my age group. I’ve been also going to yoga classes these past few years but I have taken about a six-month break because we moved. Just for the record I’ve had two knee replacements so I’m a bionic woman ha ha. My son is a physical therapist and he’s told me that I’m doing things that you’re not even expected to be able to do with artificial knees. For example “child’s pose” should be difficult with artificial knees but no problem for me. I’m keeping Up daily with the practices and I really really liked this day 11 practice.  Needless to say the only part I did not do was lean on my knees in a full squat. I’m so darn proud of myself! Again I’d really like to hear from others who may be in the same position I am with artificial knees etc.  thank you so very very much Adriene for what you given to all of us!!",Diane Everson,2020-01-13T02:52:34Z,0

"So far this has been the most challenging practice for me (physically). I had so much trouble staying squatted down and had to stand up and do forward folds or sit on my heels because it was hard for my legs. Still, I felt accomplished when I finished this practice! I’m learning my limits and when to push myself if I want more out of a practice. <br /><br />I also wanted to mention that I struggled getting out of bed today. I’ve been struggling with that since Thursday and it’s Sunday now. I dread getting up in the morning because I just don’t want to face the day. But I still get up and I still do (some of) what I need to get done. And then I do some yoga and it helps me a lot more. I’m so SO grateful for you and this channel, Adriene, so thank you for your videos. They’ve made me realize I need to slow down sometimes, and that slowing down is okay.",Bahareh,2020-01-13T02:31:25Z,0

"Day  12 dig into our tool belt and find our tools of yoga. Wow today I struggle between getting on the mat and doing it tomorrow, it was such a mental battle but I found the courage to get on the mat and every word u said Adriene felt like u knew exactly what I was battling with and u encouraged me to keep going and I really needed it today more than other days so Thank you for this practice and the those remindering words of wisdom and it may seem like it was simple but some days  when the days events weigh on me it&#39;s so hard to motivate myself like today, it&#39;s wonderful to have the encouraging voice of a friend and teacher tell us it&#39;s okay you got just stick with it so thank u for being that voice most days for me🤗💗. I usually have issues with my arch and today i didn&#39;t let it bidder me, even with all the mental struggle I just as Adriene always says give thinking mind a break and boy does that make my practice 100 time better so all in all today&#39;s practice was really yummy and I leave my mat content and grateful so thank u Adriene much love u and all my fellow yogis practicing together with me love u guys 💞, Namaste Everyone and goodnight 💕💞💗💓💖❤🙏",Vanessa Morris,2020-01-13T00:55:51Z,0

This practice put my lessons to the test by helping me to put my money where my mouth is. Through these days of practicing consistently I continue to dig deeper into what my highest self needs and the answer I came back with today is simple: presence and surrender. Through all the frustration, encountering habits I wish to change I ask myself; Why not now? It makes such a difference in my energy. Thank you for encouraging me once again to dive deep.

"Wow! Day 11...I think I never thought I would get this far.  Always have thought yoga was very hard for someone obese to do it, but I am loving it.  I have been in a journey to rediscover myself for almost 4 months now, have freed myself from almost 40 extra pounds and am still in this journey to free myself from an extra 40 pounds more.  One thing I’ve come to realize, because deep down I knew it, is that the first step (and I think the most important one) to achieve our goals and make our dreams come true is mindset.  Today, my 7 y/o daughter joined me and we shared this session together. Beautiful! Thank you, Adriene! You’re not just helping me stay focused and centered with this 30-day journey, but helping me connect at a deeper level with my daughter and helping her stay connected to her true self.  This yoga practice has elevated my life so much in such a short time that I am very impressed and I intent to keep practicing and sharing it with my daughter for years to come. Thanks!

"Had an unexpected emotional release after practice yesterday, and today&#39;s dynamic flow was a nice follow-up. This journey is making me realize that, not only is Adriene one heck of an awesome teacher, but that I&#39;m slowly starting to learn yoga in a whole new way. A way that finally feels authentic &amp; meaningful. For years I&#39;ve tried to establish a yoga practice, but it never stuck. It just wasn&#39;t clicking with me. I&#39;m just now experiencing what I&#39;ve been missing, seeing the beauty of yoga. And Adriene&#39;s gentle guidance &amp; support is monumental. I don&#39;t know how you do it Adriene, but practicing with you FEELS like home. I don&#39;t know if I will continue after these 30 days, but right now it feels so good to be here. Namaste 🙏🏼",Kawa Salih,2020-01-12T22:01:58Z,0

"Greetings from Toronto! Doing this 30-day Yoga for the first time and I love how I am able to alter poses to fit my body type and fitness level (5&#39;7, 245lbs, little flexibility) but today I had a hard time following along, especially with that sequence during the squat. The squat I could do, but none of the &quot;knees to armpits&quot; stuff. I can&#39;t even go from a lunge to bring my foot to the front of the mat, I have to stand and then walk to the front of the mat. Any suggestions on how to alter that pose for someone of my abilities in order to get the benefit of it?",Giggling Fattie,2020-01-12T21:50:37Z,0

It was over, and the practice felt like it had just started.  Every move felt good.  OK...the crow pose was intimidating, and I may have stood open-jawed, staring at the TV, but my usual &quot;NO&quot; was a &quot;MAYBE SOMEDAY&quot;.

"Today was so good! I am having so much fun during this journey, even though I am not seeing physical changes, I do know that I am feeling a lot lighter mentally. I am so grateful for this journey, because I am doing something, I am moving my body, I feel better everytime and I never feel the amount of time the has passed.... I never feel like I am looking forward to when this is going to end, and I am so grateful for this. <br /><br />Something tho that I really want to get off my chest is, today while doing tge peaceful warrior  I felt my thighs and knees just going &#39; nope, I am too tight ma&#39;am,  can&#39;t take it...straighten me for a few seconds then let&#39;s continue &#39; so I had to take a few breaks and I was so frustrated... Because I don&#39;t know if I am even doing it right, but then I thought... That.... I have only been here for a few weeks now, about 3 weeks or something... And I can&#39;t expect drastic changes to happen so soon. <br /><br />So, I took a breathe pushed my body, when I knew that I could take it, and imma be thankful for it, and sometimes I had to straighten out of the pose then get into it again. <br /><br />Anyway today, I&#39;ve taken a decision to lose some weight, and so I am going to start the Keto diet, and go on with the yoga... In hopes that I won&#39;t take any rests anymore, and to actually give my body the chance to focus on trimming and toning instead of trying to digest the incredible amount of carbohydrates that I&#39;ve thrown at it for the day.",Mirna sh,2020-01-12T18:21:15Z,0

Last year I did the 30 days in real time, and now this year as well.  But even with all that, I find the Crow pose challenging.  I was able to fly my Crow briefly today.  Maybe my longest ever.  Even tried again a few times after the session was over and that is when I found more success..... with my 11 year old cheering me on, saying “you got this mom!”  I have taught him Growth Mindset.

"This flow really inspired me. I think the beauty of being at home to practice is it helped me to break down barriers and be honest with myself, without being judgmental and allow me to be fully vulnerable. It teaches me patience with my own self growth and encourages me to dig in and be true to myself and not be afraid to say to myself what I really want and need. I&#39;m just a happier person when I do Yoga and when I build honest meaningful relationships. Unfortunately It got embedded in my mind as I grew up that being raw, honest and vulnerable meant being weak and taken advantaged of. I kind lost of my intuition and self honesty and put up a front. But now I&#39;m at a stage in my life where I want to make a decision about the person I want to be moving forward and I&#39;m so glad that I have this practice to help me figure things out. I&#39;m grateful for your guidance and for my own inner voice. Thank you, I&#39;m grateful for today and excited for tomorrow, Namaste &lt;3",Angelina f,2020-01-12T15:39:59Z,0

"Today was a tough one for me - I had some rib pain from overdoing something yesterday (no idea what), and some emotional pain from remembering people I&#39;ve had to say goodbye to over the years, so I sat most of this one out (maybe half).

"I’ve been doing yoga for close to 7 or 8 years and when I started I approached it with the same intensity as one would a HIT class or a spin class. I’m naturally flexible and once I increased my strength I was able to “crank” my body into all the “perfect” shapes. Two years ago my life got really demanding and my body was struggling with my normal workout regimen. I have had to slow way down, I’ve struggled mentally as I’ve lost muscle tone and strength but when I found Yoga with Adriene I’ve been able to approach fitness with a much healthier attitude. I’ve been healing my mind and my body and it’s felt really good. All of this to say... today I approached crow for the first time in a very long time, it was one of my “normal” moves years ago but I have never felt this grounded, this strong, this connected to my body and that was unbelievable encouraging for me. Thank you Adriene and all of the Yoga with Adriene team, I don’t think I can fully express what you’ve done for me. Bless you 🙏🏻",Brianna Venegas,2020-01-12T15:30:14Z,2

"I&#39;ve been struggling a lot both in yoga and in meditation to give my thinking mind a break.  I really value yoga and meditation as a space to just let myself exist as I am in the moment, but for the past few weeks my mind has been so cluttered with thoughts, it has been very difficult. But during this practice I realized that instead of pushing and struggling I have to acknowledge who I am right now and honor myself, my abilities and limitations, my fears and shame and insecurities, my dedication and persistence and gentleness. If I don&#39;t accept myself as I am and work with myself as I am, then I&#39;m not going to get anywhere because I&#39;m not working on me, I&#39;m working on an imaginary version of me that doesn&#39;t exist. <br /><br /><br />I realized this right before doing crow, but also as I was doing crow. I&#39;ve been doing yoga for a year now and I still can&#39;t do crow pose. And often when it comes up I&#39;ll try to just jump right into it, but today, I realized that by jumping right into the final version and never accomplishing it, I&#39;m robbing myself of the opportunity to actually develop the skills required to do the pose. So today I just stood in a squat with my knees resting in my arm pits and felt the heat in my arms.",Anna Broomfield,2020-01-12T14:42:31Z,9

Today’s session was a little rough for me I read something sometime back that the Dalai Lama said  that we should go out and do something once a year that we’ve never done before in her life well I did last night I went to a Esctatic dance night thinking it was a type of meditation class “wrong“ and I’ve never danced a step in my life and I danced for over an hour straight last night and I tried the drink cacao for the first time and I have not slept at all so it made today’s session a little rough But it was still very beautiful thank you 😊 Namaste 🙏 so go out and do something new this year 🧘‍♀️,Brian Fetter,2020-01-12T14:33:20Z,0

I&#39;m in my first tech rehearsal on 16 years!  With a full-time job you know what I mean, Adriene!  I recently moved and figured community theater is a great way to meet people. It hasn&#39;t disappointed. And I&#39;m proud of myself for walking into that building and trying it. I had to go buy new blacks but I&#39;m ready!

"Thanks to Harry Smith and the Today show for introducing Adriene to me. Thank you Adriene for your positivity and this chance to do a daily practice. I have done yoga before using videos at home or going to a class but never did it consecutive days. It is only day 11 and I can feel the difference. I told my chiropractor and osteopath( I go to both!) and they said I really need it given my type A personality and chronic back issues. The physical benefits are quickly apparent to me, the mental ones may take a while as it is hard for me to quiet my mind during the practice especially when my Jack Russell Terriers want to be in the thick of things!  They are not chill like Benji!  I hope to continue something after 30 days, there are alot of video offerings. I feel some of these moves are very advanced and I just flop around the positions I can not get into( like today&#39;s hand stand- no way!!). I&#39;m working to make my transitions better for now....

"I&#39;ve suffered with lower back pain on and off for some time now and I can honestly say on day 11 that my back is feeling so much better and my core starting to feel stronger - I&#39;m finding the yoga both a physical and spiritual healing tool.  I work in substance misuse addiction service and one of the groups just set up for our service users is yoga, which I think could be a great tool for those people willing to embrace the experience on their road to recovery.<br />On another note, Adriene I didn&#39;t receive my Day 11 email, but obviously found it on YouTube, but I did receive an email Yoga for after a Disaster, which looks good too!

"Good morning everyone! Especially those 400 people who did yoga with me on a Sunday. I know what it means when Adriene cracks her knuckles in the intro, but I didn&#39;t expect to end up in the chair pose within the 2 first minutes. :D <br />It wasn&#39;t easy, but I keep pushing and I&#39;m starting to feel stronger. Also, Adriene is like the best teacher ever. In the moments where I could swear, when it&#39;s tough, I can&#39;t actually direct my anger at her, because she&#39;s just too sweet and doesn&#39;t deserve it. :D",Zita M.

"To be honest I am having a hard time connect to the mindful part of the practices. That is why I almost gave up on yoga. This time I committed myself to show up on the mat everyday and just do my best even if I cannot connect my mind to Adrienne&#39;s messages.<br />But I just realized that even like this I find my little moments. Sometimes during the day I realize that my posture is much better. <br />In addition, I just catch myself every other day sitting up tall, looking out of the window and just breath. It makes me realize that my anxiety issues are big, but I am lucky to be where I am. When I inhale I imagine to inhale the sunshine and happines and exhale the anxiety.<br />Finally I see that I am on a journey. Thank you Adriene❤️",Fanni Filotas,2020-01-12T09:06:57Z,1

"I am doing this journey just like I did in the past two years but this time my mind has been too chaotic and it has been hard to really feel the fruits of this work. I feel the workout but I am having a hard time connecting to it. That saddens me and that is why i am writing this today. There&#39;s a beautiful community of people doing this alongside me, also going through some challenges of their own, and i think I just need to be reminded that I am not alone on this one, even if i am seeing my reality through distorted glasses at the moment.",Marta Marques,2020-01-12T07:47:52Z,236

"I’m the same, I’m very distracted during my practice. Some days I’m unable to even get to the mat so I try to make up for it and do two practices in one day.

"Marta Marques thank you for your honesty. Like you, I had a hard time connecting to this practice as well and was sad about it too. But when I read your story all the lovely comments from everyone here it made me realise that we’re not alone and that it’s all okay (seriously I cried over all the positivity, acceptance and love). It reminded me that we all have highs and lows and sometimes we feel less connected but that does not make us nor the practice anything less. We showed up for ourselves today, we’re doing a great job ♥️ Being kind to yourself takes practice. And it will get better. <br />A big thank you and much love to you and everyone in this community ♥️",Karen,2020-01-17T10:54:49Z,0

"Day 11 - Dig! When I read the title I felt a bit scared to show up. Something like the fear of the unknown. But as soon as I pressed play that all faded away and I just went with. This was such a good practice! ❤️ At the part where we could practice crow I was like I have never been able to do that not even for a second, so lets try! 💪🏻 I managed to dig in my strength, breath, focus and the believe in myself and hell I even managed to do crow for at least 3 seconds! 😯 It made me say &#39;hell yeah&#39; out loud! ❤️ HOME is so good so far, I&#39;m loving this! ❤️ Namaste! 🙏🏻",Deborah,2020-01-12T07:10:44Z,5

"Ah, I wish I could join in with everyone who feels amazing and refreshed after each practice... I feel I&#39;m just getting more aches in my shoulders and wrists and forgetting to breath properly :/ Maybe it&#39;s a subconscious pressure (of myself) to relate to every day&#39;s theme or something. I feel like I enjoyed yoga more before, when I was freely mixing and matching the videos of the monthly calendars. I feel like such a failure :(",Ginatus,2020-01-12T06:53:15Z,0

"You 👏are 👏 not👏a 👏failure👏! I understand how sometimes yoga can be frustrating when your body does not want to cooperate. I found that what really helped me was to let go of the idea of performance. You don&#39;t need to hit a certain goal or to land in a certain shape. If you need to modify the hell out of every posture, do it! Who cares?! Find the experience rather than the performance and stop judging yourself, because ultimately you are perfect the way you are and progress will come naturally. (Hope this helps, if not here is a virtual hug 💖)",Louise Déglise-Favre,2020-01-12T09:52:53Z,1
"Your no failure... It&#39;s just part of the journey. I too have sore shoulders, and have to concentrate on so much throughout the videos that I sometimes cannot even give thought to the days theme. However that&#39;s part of the growth... Perhaps if I complete another cycle of HOME when it is finished then we would find we would have a very different journey to the first. Stay with it... Not everything is easy the first time around. You&#39;ve made it to day 11 so something in you wants to be here. Wishing you all the best with the rest of your HOME journey and beyond 😘",Erka Doof,2020-01-12T07:27:28Z,0
