"The energetic body can often go unnoticed. We don’t even realize we are quite off balance until things are so bad they begin to show up in a more harsh or glaring way.<br />Practices such as yoga and breath techniques, like Nadhi Shodhana, offer us a way to better keep in alignment. <br />How are you feeling today after this Balance practice?",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-10T14:47:05Z,888

love her channel but struggle when she mixes up left and right at least once per practice.  When she says right leg back and then switches to referencing it as the left my brain feels like the game twister.,George Newcomb,2021-05-05T14:05:20Z,0

"I just wanted to leave a comment because I have noticed that the views go down the further I get in this series. I missed Day 9 which was supposed to be yesterday because, after spending all day consumed with chemistry homework, I was just beat. In hind sight I probably should&#39;ve done this yesterday morning and it may have helped my concentration. BUT today I came back and did Day 9 and Day 10 this morning (I usually do it in the evening) and I feel so great. If you miss a day, YOU ARE NOT ALONE!!! I know this is easier said than done sometimes, but don&#39;t be discouraged. Like Adriene says, this practice is a great place to learn to fall with grace, just pick yourself back up and be gracious to yourself in understanding that you are human and missing a day doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ve failed. Anyways, All the Love to every one of you and Namaste. &lt;3",Allison Beeson,2021-04-10T16:53:47Z,5

Day 9: I started this journey on 21 March. I am inspired by all of you lovely people and I got this idea (on day 4) to leave a comment every day after each session. I rarely finish things like this so if I can do it then you can do it. Look for my comment each day and remember you&#39;re not alone. Breathe.,Stefana Lavinia,2021-03-29T09:02:39Z,5

Today was nice my lower back needed it.  But the balance part was hurting my feet for some reason. Do u know why? But I am rally starting to love yoga.,Desiree Mathews,2021-01-28T09:02:32Z,0
It&#39;s just tiring for the feet to be under the body weight for an extended period of time. Also the balacing activates a lot of smaller muscles in the feet that aren&#39;t used to that kind of work. So it&#39;s basically a sign of that your feet are activated and with practice they will endure more work.,zaprude,2021-01-29T10:40:14Z,1

"I usually don&#39;t even start this kind of &quot;challenge&quot; because I know I get mad at myself when I skip a day and then I just quit. Adriene&#39;s attitude has me coming back and accept when I take some days off. First week I had to skip three days in a row, since they are my stressful workdays of the week, second week I&#39;ve been showing up anyways, it gets easier to incorporate 30 mins of yoga into my days. I started day 9 yesterday after dinner, but my stomach wasn&#39;t feeling to well with the exercise, so I interrupted it and started over today. It&#39;s totally fine, no need for internal conflict, I can do it for myself or I can skip a day if it&#39;s better for myself. I&#39;m happy because this kind of attitude hasn&#39;t been easy to find for me. I hope you find it as well, fellow people with self discipline issues!",Sarah,2021-02-11T15:35:55Z,2

"Thank you for bringing Nadhi Shodhana to us today! As I began, I remembered my first yoga teacher, Manu, who, before we did this breath practice, would distribute tissues to the class, which he called our &quot;tool&quot; for this practice. In these times, it&#39;s almost unthinkable to imagine a group of strangers sitting in a room encouraged to first blow their noses and then engage in this breath practice. But that&#39;s what we did, and it&#39;s so powerful. He would have us rest our index and middle fingers, if I remember correctly, on our third eye as we did it. It&#39;s a practice I&#39;d forgotten -- even though you&#39;ve done it before! -- so I&#39;m grateful for your reintroducing it today and for the positive memories it brought up.

"Hi Adriene,  I have been following your yoga practice since a couple of years now. I love your energy and how you go slow for people at different levels. I am following the breath 30 day journey and loving every moment. I had been out of touch with yoga for about 8 months before this.  I have developed a bruise right above my left knee after the last practice.  Is it normal to develop bruises in yoga. This is my first experience like this.",Mehreen J. Ronald,2021-01-18T09:50:13Z,0

"Any tips on how to improve on the balancing part? I started following Adrian’s yoga videos a couple of weeks ago and even though the majority of the exercises are fine, my 2 biggest problems I noticed are balancing poses and also some flexibility exercises. I’m a 45 year old male, slightly overweighted but that is probably not an excuse right? :) Also started intermittent fasting and low carb diet recently so those extra kilos will go away over time. Maybe i will have to redo this day 9 in 1-2 months or so and see how it goes then. This was by far the toughest video so far for me.",Breyzipp,2021-01-18T06:38:24Z,0

"Maybe some newbie yogis or some more experienced ones can help me- my hands always slide when I go into downdog (or any similar kind of pose) my hands are just a little sweaty and they slide when I have to anchor them like that.

"Are you straightening your legs? Maybe if you are, you are putting too much weight and strength on your arms. Try to do the downward facing dog with straight arms and bend you knees and see if the balance its better. Slowly you can try to lengthen the legs after more practice. Another tip can be to not put your hands flat, but make claws of your hands so your fingertips give you extra resistance. :) Hope it&#39;ll help! Good luck 🤗",JoyKirsten,2021-01-17T23:16:38Z,0

"Hi Adriene, I would love a video about modifications (or just more cues) for people with hyperextended elbows and knees. I&#39;m never quite sure how to arrange myself in poses like Triangle (as in this video) and whether certain cues make sense for me. I know generally to try not to lock my knees, but more advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much for your videos. This series in particular has been really enjoyable.",Chelsea Spencer,2021-01-13T15:07:32Z,2

"I&#39;ve been watching yoga videos, practicing, and trying to follow YWA for the last couple years but never made the 100% commitment like I have this year. I love so many things about this channel, Adriene, and the YWA team (and of course Benji). My body is struggling a bit but I&#39;m sticking with it. One thing I need help with is understanding how to pull up from your arches of your feet... I&#39;ve been practicing since this session while I&#39;m standing in front of the sink doing dishes or brushing my teeth to just try feeling that connection. Does anyone else struggle with this? Does anyone have any suggestions? I feel like I could balance for longer if my feet didn&#39;t cramp up.",lisa marie,2021-01-13T04:01:21Z,0

A lot of falling but oh thank god Adriene gradually works you up to warrior 3 so it was actually doable even for me ;u; wondering though as someone who can’t really feel where there legs are, which muscles in your leg in something like warrior 3 should be tensed and if your knee should be more locked? what’s <b>supposed</b> to be happening to not fall over",Danielle Miller,2021-01-11T19:48:14Z,1

"A balance trick I learned from a pelvic floor therapist- engage your pelvic floor.  In more dynamic poses it helps to use an “amplifier”.  Yes- your pelvic floor muscles can be amplified bc they are connected with other parts of your body.<br />There are three.  One won’t really work, unless being on your toe is part of the pose.<br />#1- tongue to the roof of your mouth.<br />#2- making a claw with your hand.  She called it “lady Gaga hand”<br />#3- up on your toe- push the ball of your toe into the ground- like in an imaginary high heel.",carendale,2021-01-11T12:32:21Z,0

Our Balance practice today was so grounding.

"Thank you Adriene! 🙏 Unfortunately, I now have tendinitis in both arms now, as the right was compensating for the left, and I feel kind of discouraged and disappointed about that... But now I realize after showing up, carefully practising simplified and more subtle movements this evening, with only my legs and my torso, and pressing my heart lovingly with both hands, with arms carefully glued to my sides when doing forward bends... that what I really need to work on anyway is yoga all day!  Mindfully breathing and hydrating, accepting what is in the moment, encouraging and loving myself. With injuries, which will heal with loving self care, the universe has provided me with the most appropriate opportunity to learn. Yoga is a beautiful thing! You all inspired me with sharing your progress, so I decided to share my own. Namaste all! 🙏😊🦋👯🌈💖🧜‍♀️",Renée aka Saffron Stargazer Lily,2021-01-11T06:11:50Z,0

I started my yoga journey with the 2020 January 30 Day Yoga. Who knew it would have been the year I needed it more than ever. Staying at home with 2 toddlers. Uncertain of anything and everything. I showed up EVERY single day for the entire year. Give or take a day. It was something I knew would be a constant for me each day. I’ve learned discipline. I’ve learned self love. I am learning so much more. I am forever grateful for you and your videos. ❤️,Hayley,2021-01-11T02:01:40Z,4

To all my fellow yoga people out there a little tip - - switch to placing your mat on a hard floor/surface for this one.

Accountability check: I finished Day 9. An emotional one for me today...I had a huge release of emotions at the end and started to tear up. I already feel myself getting stronger and happier. I smiled on my own today out of happiness which hasn’t happened in a while. I am starting to look forward to these instead of feeling like it’s something to check off my to do list.

"This was such a rewarding practice. Physically it was one of the most satisfying, second only to to the Anchor practice on Day 3. I also found it really mentally rewarding, perhaps due to the level of focus it required to retain balance and the awareness this brought to my body. I&#39;m finding this 30 days to be so rewarding so far, and I&#39;m glad it fell just in time for yet another lockdown here in the UK and just before I begin my Masters Degree in February as I feel it&#39;s giving me so much time to meet myself on the mat and process what&#39;s happening in the world and my own life before delving back into academia once again. Looking forward the rest of the calendar very much!!",Alexandria Dixon,2021-01-10T22:53:41Z,0
This was exactly what I needed today!  I feel better prepared for the week ahead and so very in tune with my body and breath.  I find myself unconsciously using my breath to centre myself throughout my days since starting this journey and I am so grateful.,Kim Bouchard,2021-01-10T22:51:55Z,0

When I was first introduced to Yoga our teacher showed us three balance things at the end of each practice right before corpse pose - so I make sure to do my balance practice - first thing in the AM and the last thing before I go to bed. Falling is what takes most 65+ people out - good balance and strong core - they give you the best shot at walking your granddaughter down the isle. Or maybe holding up your great-grand.,Roger Clem,2021-01-10T20:51:55Z,0

11.33 - I followed the instruction to put my right leg back. Later in the flow i checked &amp; you had the left leg back. So I rewound. I guess this comes of often having to reverse instructions (R&amp;L) to mirror when teaching at the front of a class. I’ll go back &amp; start that move again :),Liz Curran,2021-01-10T20:34:34Z,1

I love that this isn&#39;t about forcing your body into a cool looking pose. I love that Adriene never makes me feel like a failure for needing modification or feeling weak. There have been so many times where I have though to myself, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m shaking, I&#39;m so weak&quot; and usually right after I think that, Adriene makes a comment about how it&#39;s okay if you are already shaking.

"Hi Bec, a book came out last year on breathing, by James Nestor. It&#39;s called &quot;Breath, the new science of a lost art&quot;. I haven&#39;t read the book but have listened to an interview with him. He talks about the importance of breathing through your nostrils and says that people have been cured of asthma because of it. Recommend checking it out in case it helps!",Laura Cobbold,2021-01-24T10:33:22Z,0

"I&#39;ve been practicing alternate nostril breathing ever since I was a child. Back then, I had no idea it was a yogic practice, I only learnt that a few years ago. I was doing it, because I loved the way it felt and most of the time I was doing it unintentionally. Even now, I sometimes catch myself doing it spontaneously when my mind wanders a little, for example when I watch TV. Thank you for including it into this journey! :)",Emily Rebane,2021-01-10T18:30:13Z,1

Feeling awesome after that given me balance challenges to work on xx,Judi Baldock,2021-01-10T18:16:03Z,1
"Something I thought about today:<br />Balance is hard. Balance in life, I mean. I know in my life, I&#39;m always struggling between that push and pull, how much to give to others vs. how much to give to myself, how much to rest vs. how hard to work, how much to stay stubborn vs. how much to concede. This practice was also hard, but... fun. It&#39;s a metaphor for life, I think. Finding the balances of life is part of the journey, and a huge part of that journey is to play with the forces that push us in order to find balance. <br />Now, time for coffee before I wax too philosophical, but as always: Thank you, Adriene &lt;3",rachmach,2021-01-10T18:15:12Z,1

"I’m really enjoying this series so far. Loved Balance today. I often am listening more so than watching and unfortunately today that caused me to do one section on the same side twice. At minute <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAOUZR3Jw3E&amp;t=11m30s"">11:30</a> Adriene says put your right leg back, which I did, but she put her left leg back. I did that whole section opposite and it seemed off a bit especially when she then had us do the same side twice. She didn’t, but I did. I rewound afterward to see what went wrong. I guess I need to look up a little more often to verify positioning. Otherwise, very much enjoyed today’s practice. Thanks Adriene.",Laurie Noorigian,2021-01-10T18:07:54Z,0

"I&#39;ve been so looking forward to Breath and I am absolutely loving it. I am noticing that, despite my best intentions, I have a lot of difficult energy arising at the beginning of each practice. Part of me just wants a to be a perfect, relaxed, zen yogi. I&#39;ve been so looking forward to a new 30 day journey and I just want to show up and for the yoga to flow and to feel so at peace. But the truth of the matter is that life is really difficult right now, the world is in a difficult place and, obviously, that all comes to the matt. Because of course it does. With that realisation, and our close, loving attention to breath, I feel the space opening up and I feel the light and love of this practice. The relaxation, peace and equanimity at the end is so much more real as a result. What a journey this is. Thank you Adriene, thank you lovely community!

"Lovely practice today, but I will say the alternate nostril breathing is difficult during this central Texas cedar season, I will have to try it again once I can breathe through both nostrils. 😆I am definitely loving the 30 day format, I don&#39;t waste any time picking my workout in the morning, I just get up and turn it on. ❤️",Claire Heins,2021-01-10T16:34:42Z,0

"So this ain’t my first Mishler rodeo. Usually when I fall out the balancing postures I just “jump right back in” meaning instead of starting Warrior three at the top, I would just shoot my leg back out, lean forward, arms out...no breath work, no body work, not trying to evaluate or see why I fell out in the first place, just ignoring any and all messages trying to be sent from my subtle body...just trying to nail the pose. Today, when I fell out of every single posture, I stopped, took a deep breath cycle and started back at one. If I work with the breath as the starting point, I realize that I don’t just start the breath in the middle. I CAN’T just start the breath in middle. I gotta start back at the top. I have really learned that this go round. It’s ok to fail and fall. ❤️",J J,2021-01-10T16:31:18Z,1

"i&#39;m not a newcomer to yoga so this practice seems rather slow to me.  However, it reinforces the basics.  One thing is that the directions seem off to me today as Adriene asked to move the right leg back but I believe that her left leg went back first. There was a twist on one side and not the other.  So, if this is balance, it felt a bit lopsided.  Luckily, I stopped the video and then did the right side.

@Jasmine Z That is great to hear :) I am glad that you have been able to find something that can support you through motherhood.

"A practice focused on balance always brings the heat, there is no doubt about that!! I must say, my favourite part of the practice today was our time spent in Pyramid Pose. I actually find that stretch and moment to balance so relaxing and centering!

"Ever since I was little I was drawn to dance and creative movement. I found such beauty in ballet especially as a child. I wanted to grow up to be a ballerina. Now that I am in my 20&#39;s I have been taking beginner ballet classes! This 30 day-yoga journey is not only helping me gain flexibility and getting closer to doing the splits, it&#39;s helping me in my balance and positioning. The one legged mountain pose really showed me that today. I often sink into my hips during ballet and this practice helped me feel around in my hips and legs and back more to be able to figure out where I need to be focusing to not sink into my hips. Thank you Adriene for helping me improve in one of my childhood dreams! &lt;3",Melanie H,2021-01-10T14:52:56Z,1

"Today was an amazing practice for me. I skipped yesterdays (simply did not make the time for it. I will do it this evening but anyway.) Today was just incredible, it reminded me yet again why I do yoga and why Adriene is simply the biggest blessing to have come into my life.

@Shannon Pitts i always have a similar thing with balance practices. grounded foot is shakey and hurts! but it&#39;s worth trying,Katie Sheets,2021-01-10T15:04:05Z,1
"It was a bit challenging for me as well. My calves were burning, but in a good way LOL I had to shake it out when I was done. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s normal or if I&#39;m not grounding my balancing foot correctly 🤷‍♀️ either way, I tried it and was proud of myself",Shannon Pitts,2021-01-10T14:00:52Z,1
"Though I&#39;ve been doing yoga with Adriene for a few years, this is the first time I have stayed this long, consecutively, with a 30 day practice.

"Day 9  I arrived with  sad thoughts. I am glad I turned up. As Adriene said if you fall its a great thing to do,  I felt more grounded and stumbled a few time . Thought Benji will catch me but he was in his own  dreamland. ❤Needed to balance, clear  my thoughts and focuse on the practice and this practice is what I needed. Concentrating on my breath, strength, flexibility and balance was the best therapy thanks Adriene and Benji 🙏.",Benhilda Katsande,2021-01-10T13:11:05Z,0

"It&#39;s the second time I learn this breath with you and it gets easier, but in every breath, I end up gasping for air. I see that it&#39;s a lack of trust. When I focused on breathing in the proper direction as you mentioned a couple of days back, it got easier.<br />My mind was all over the place today, it&#39;s easy for me to go in automatic mode in balancing postures as they are quite easy for me. But another super interesting thing I noticed is for the first time ever, I was able to transition from cobra to down dog via plank. I usually get to my knees. So in a way, being unconscious showed me I was able to do it, instead of being afraid... Lessons come in the weirdest of form sometimes!",Lucie Aidart,2021-01-10T12:08:39Z,0

"Hello everyone! Just joining in. Last week I&#39;ve had to work over 10 hours a day for university, if not even more, so it seemed impossible to bring out the mat because of how stressed I was about deadlines. Anytime I wasn&#39;t working, I felt guilty and panicked. But now that I submitted one of the bigger projects, I would like to join all of you for the rest of the month, hoping I&#39;ll find it in myself to allow 30 minutes a day to put everything on pause even if I&#39;m under time pressure. I really need it! <br /><br />My goal for this month is not to cry/ stress about university.

"I&#39;m not usually one to comment, but I love this community and I did want to share something with you all. So today I started practicing but I was not focused, not in the right mindset and my puppy (who isn&#39;t as well behaved as Benji yet) kept chewing on my mat and crying when I put him away. I kept having to pause the video and start again and it made me super annoyed. I almost gave up half way but then I thought &quot;this is dumb, I&#39;m on day 9, I&#39;ve done 8 videos without quitting in the middle why should this one be any different?&quot; So I put my puppy downstairs with my brother, restarted the video and reset my mind. In the end, I&#39;m very glad I restarted because this turned out to be my favourite video yet. (Thank you Adrienne)<br /><br />So whoever read this far (congrats), if you feel like quitting, just hold up, take a second and think of how much better you&#39;ll feel when you complete the practice you initially wanted to give up on.<br /><br />Namaste everyone, see you tomorrow.",Sohanna Sara,2021-01-10T10:19:37Z,32

"Every time a see a one-legged posture in the video preview, I get a little frustrated. Balancing on one leg is really not my strong suit as my ankles tend to dance around when I do them. I used to get foot cramps when standing on one leg, I got super angry and was avoiding the balancing work. <br />But magically, Adriene persuaded me to accept where I am and work there. Today, after a couple of years, I don&#39;t get cramps in the feet,  I can stand on one leg (there&#39;s still some wiggling, haha), I am noticing the difference between right and left, differences between days (somedays I still fall, oh yes). I try to laugh off the falls, begin again, enjoy the process. <br />In the end, it&#39;s working on our weaknesses that brings the biggest change. Seeing you CAN evolve, seeing it&#39;s not &quot;just who you are&quot;. A beautiful lesson to take off the mat as well, don&#39;t you think?<br />One thing that also really helped me ... My cousin is a ballerina, so I talk to her a lot about balance. She said that it helps her to consider this in balancing the body: &quot;Every part of you is carrying itself. It is not up to your foot (or any other part) on the ground to bear all the weight.&quot; It helped me a lot, together with engaging my core, learning the bandhas, working on leg strength to manage the slightly bent knee (it&#39;s still hard work, man!), but especially working on my MIND.<br />So, whatever you struggle with, it&#39;s ok. Lean in, discover, make space and leave judgment off the mat. Namaste, my friends. Can you believe it&#39;s DAY 9 already???",Neja Žitnik,2021-01-10T09:20:01Z,1

Ok - I didn&#39;t manage this on day 9 - I get up at 4am to go to a part time job and then I had to choose between watching things with my daughter or a night yoga practice - daughter won! And so did I because I got to be with her...but I felt sad I hadn&#39;t found time. So I came here with the intention of working through day 9 and day 10 one after the other...onwards to day 10 ( which it actually is ). Lesson - this is my choice. My decision.

Grrrrrrrrrrreat start of the morning 🌅<br />Namaste!,Mer lin,2021-01-10T07:00:23Z,1
"It&#39;s sunday, now 7.51am in Italy, and I wasn&#39;t feeling like waking up super early as the rest of the week: I have an exam on 26th and it kinda makes me nervous just to think about it because it&#39;s the second left before my graduation and I can&#39;t allow myself to fail it. I feel mentally weak during these days and I&#39;m just trying to hold myself together. So I thought:&quot;Maybe I could sleep one more hour...&quot; but then my sense of responsability hit me and I decided to get up. Looking on my phone I saw the notification of today&#39;s practice with Adriene, as always around 7am. And I just couldn&#39;t let myself stay in bed any more. Because in just nine days I think this has become part of my mornings: my boyfriend, who I live with, is still asleep and I have this time exclusively for myself, I&#39;m not seen by anyone (except our dog, Midnight, that keeps me company like Benji!) and I feel... I don&#39;t know, free? Alone but at the same time connected, with all of you who are doing this practice. So thank you for this calming, conforting and encouraging connection. See you tomorrow. Have a nice weekend.",Alessia Trombini,2021-01-10T06:51:20Z,48

"Hi, best wishes for your exam on 26th.  My birthday is 26th so I&#39;ll send you all my birthday wishes for luck.  I am also studying at this strange time and mental strength and energy is hard to find, I have over a year to go until my graduation though. X",MissLealikes,2021-01-10T19:55:54Z,1

"As we gently say in Rome &quot;Daje forte e spacca tutto!&quot; I have an exam on the 26th too and it would be actually the second of my master year (the first is on the 19th, I start feeling the excitement kicking in). I admire you for your responsability in the morning, it&#39;s something I&#39;m working on and I realized how the mindfullness that yoga brings has helped me a lot in this task. I understand you feelings right now (I was in the same situation last year), the best thing is to set a plan and stick to it, this has helped me to feel more light in my thoughts and not to worry too much since everything was scheduled. And remember to breathe! Ti mando un abbraccio in questa uggiosa giornata domenicale :)",NicoleKo,2021-01-10T12:12:46Z,1

"I am 20 years old and was suffering from PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) and late periods ( almost three months late) unbalanced hormones, cysts forming around my ovaries and there is no real cure to this problem only medications but because of that I was suffering from acne. So 6 months ago I decided to stop my medications and start doing yoga, not cardio or anything else which I have been doing till now but yoga, and I found your channel and started doing your 30 days programs. And all of sudden I got my periods within a 30 days. And it has been like this since then. And I&#39;m thankful to you Adriene. I love doing it and I do it only five times a week and still I got solution to my pcos and tbh and I am also loosing inches and I am not dieting at all..it&#39;s all so good ...thank you Adriene ❤",Shifali Pratap,2021-01-10T06:40:09Z,171
"Similar story here, but I had been trying for 5 years to have children with PCOS with no luck. I found this channel in 2016 to try yoga to relax and recenter my energy.

"I always need to leave my ego off the mat when it comes to balance work - it&#39;s never been my forté (especially not with tendonitis in one foot 😬).

Ahh balance! 😏Great on the right......... Not so great on the left but amusing. I will get better. Great practice. Thank you. Namaste 🙏❤️,Shaz Newman,2021-01-10T06:35:19Z,1
"Why did I struggle through that today? First, I couldn’t watch on my laptop, so winced at my phone. Then, found I was using incorrect leg so got confus-lde. Then found all deep breaths forced through twists where my tummy just kept being in the way. Finally, realised, that my mind had wandered when good stuff should have been “ percolating”. Thank goodness Adriene  justified my practice by letting me know that if I struggled, the practice was still worthwhile ( or words to that effect/ or that’s how I chose to interpret). I do feel better, though. As ever, thanks to A and the whole community. X",Helen Saltos,2021-01-10T06:34:55Z,8

This past year more than the others, you and the mat and the breath and me — it was a daily constant, a comfort, a trusted moment. In the midst of fear and hatred, your reminders to breathe lots of love in and breathe lots of love out reminded me of the deepest truth, our most true and unchanging nature.

Feels weird not sharing the same level of intensity here as every where else. My city&#39;s numbers have been steadily rising since August but no where near the numbers up north in the Seoul area and definitely a far cry from those numbers at home.
