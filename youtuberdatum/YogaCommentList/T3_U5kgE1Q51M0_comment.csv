"Hi Adriene! Love your videos, I’ve been on/off for a couple years but have dedicated the last 2-3months to doing some amount of yoga everyday, and I’ve never felt better! <br /><br />I love at home yoga because I can modify everything as needed with no embarrassment. I’ve been publicly shamed in classes before for wearing socks, but as a person with hyperhidrosis I slip and fall all over the place without some extra traction. And the sopping mat afterwards just adds to the overall shame hahaha<br /><br />Would you happen to have a practice for the super sweaty(hands/feet)?? Sometimes I will slip in downdog and smack my face on the mat, and I’ve tried most things to get hand traction without success...<br /><br />Anyways much love to you and the community ❤️",Jade Munson,2021-04-26T04:21:50Z,0

"When doing the hip exercise, laying on my left side to work the right hips feels very uncomfortable, like all my weight is bearing down the left (I have issues with my left hip).

One thing i&#39;ve learned from Adrienne is to be &#39;kind&#39; while stretching and doing body work.  As a weightlifter that really changed my approach with recovery work as I used to yank and be a bit too aggressive with stretching before.

"Adriene! I felt so good. I went from a 2 to an 8! the pain in my left knee nd lower back and tight hips have eased very much. Your advice on pulling up from the center to open/stretch the lower back helped me so much. I also had a revelation during this practice. With my eyes open I saw the cellulite on my legs during down dog, I felt tense and I heard in my head &quot;I hate this pose, oh no not this pose, I can&#39;t do this pose&quot; and I saw my cellulite and felt my stiffness and I said &quot;no just try and be calm and take it easy&quot; and your words &quot;calm soothing and encouraging made me feel it inside myself within myself. I closed my eyes and brought my center up felt the strength in my center like you said and it lifted my legs up more and felt the ease of the pose. I am sitting now with my hips open and relaxed writing this to you. I&#39;d also like to say thank you for your emails and the format you have them in, spaced out, it brings me calm and ease and OPENESS, space to breathe and take my time reading what you share. Today I realized to not let my center spill out, and connected it to how I let my energy spill out to the people in my life. I learned to keep some for myself and I learned that if I heard that negative self talk about how my body looks and start panicking, to shut my eyes and focus on the integrity. Thank you for all you do and after months of wanting to join the mat with you I&#39;ve finally relaxed about the idea and just decided ill do what I can and joined you all on the mat =] P&gt;S ! I love the affirmation you added for us, you didn&#39;t speak FOR us you let us choose our own affirmation for where we are on jour individual journeys. If you&#39;d like to know my affirmation that came to me without any resistance (which is important to gauge where are right?) was  &quot;I choose to improve my body by showing up, I choose to encourage my strength&quot; It is MY affirmation that will change as time goes on, but it felt so comfortable and so ME, right NOW.

"Hi Adriene, I was wondering if you could do a yoga session for people who have a very restricted range of motion (sort of an introduction to yoga for those people). I&#39;ve tried to introduce my father to your videos but he finds them too difficult and just forces the movement. He is 60 and an avid runner (20km on a good day) but he has never had any kind of training on how to move &quot;properly&quot; so he is experiencing a lot of pain in his calves, hamstrings (and has honestly very bad posture, rounded shoulders, no muscle tone on the upper body). I want to help him learn how to tend to his body as he ages, because he is very frustrated that he can&#39;t run like he used to when he was young. I think yoga would be a great way to keep his body healthy and unlock all the tightness. Most of the videos are too hard for him, even when I try to modify the movements to make them easier for him, and that makes him feel very discouraged. I was wondering if you could help us! Thank you so much",M. Caneda,2021-04-15T10:46:10Z,0

"No matter what your religion, there is only one God<br />Sunday Sep 11, 2011 at 07:15 pm<br />My dearly beloved daughter, when My children feel despair, frightened or lonely tell them they must turn to Me. Never before have as many of My children throughout the world felt such emptiness in their lives. With no direction they become more distracted when they are fed on a diet of junk. Daily media feeds them with stories, which show the evil present in the world, with so many countries in turmoil. Then there is the lack of spiritual food, and in its place, a diet of lies when you are told of the wonders of worldly ambitions. All of which, should you attain such things, will disappoint. Then as you strive towards such goals you will be anxious to reach these heights, again, you will be disappointed.<br />Remember, I Am your Food, children. It will only be through Me that you will find true peace, contentment and pure love in your hearts. It is not possible to gain this kind of peace anywhere else.<br />Turn to Me now, each of you who are suffering sorrow in your hearts. Let Me hold and comfort you. For you, My children, are My lost, but precious souls. Many of you have wandered off and do not know your way back to My flock. Some of you have chosen a different flock – a flock not of Me.<br />Listen to My call, for when you hear My Voice in your souls you will know the Truth. I Am your pathway to My Eternal Father. Remember that many of you, who give different names to God the Almighty Father, may still be worshiping the same God. There is only one God. The time is close now, for the time when His Glory will be revealed to the world. No matter what your interpretation is, God the Father is Love. His Mercy is all embracing. Come; turn to Him now, wherever you are in the world. He is waiting for your call.<br />Your beloved Saviour<br />Jesus Christ<br /><br />Woe to those Christians who have deserted Me in favour of new age paganism<br />Tuesday Sep 24, 2013 at 10:44 pm<br />My dearly beloved daughter, every living soul has a powerful instinct to seek out God in their lives. Those who find the Love of God in its most pure form are given this Gift because of their humility and acceptance of the fact that all Glory belongs to God.<br />Pagans, on the other hand, in their quest for spiritual peace, seek out the Creation of the True God, rather than their Creator. Instead of laying themselves before God, My Father, the Almighty, Creator of all things, they lie prostrate before false idols, including the wonders He created for the world – the Earth, the sun, the moon and the stars. They idolize these great wonders and then believe that by doing so, this gives them great powers. What they are seeking is a form of spiritual enlightenment, which they hope will bring them pleasure and peace. Many then, through meditation and yoga, open their minds and souls to allow the spirit of evil to corrupt them. They mistakenly believe that some other power, other than that which comes from God the Most High, can bring them the peace, which they crave.<br />Know now that there is only one God. Any other form of adulation amounts to paganism. It does not matter what they say or how they justify their actions, they are inviting Satan to invade their souls and once he gains access, he and the demons he sends will not leave those souls alone. They will torment these souls, fill them with lies and have them believe that they possess a gift. Some believe they can heal others, through practices such as Reiki, when what they do instead is infest others including the innocent. When pagans chant, to attract spiritual gifts, they say that this brings them peace. While many believe this, know that within a short period of time – once the spirit of evil has entered their minds – they will become agitated and no respite will they find. Every pleasure of the senses is constantly sought out by them and all they will receive in return will be a darkness of the soul.<br />Paganism brings a terrible disquiet and, in lands where the heathen cry out to the false gods, they incur the Wrath of My Father. Many such souls do not understand what they are doing, but recognise them by the ways in which they will adorn their bodies, as they consider themselves sacred vessels in the eyes of the false idols they claim to worship. Love, humility or personal sacrifice for the good of others, will be lacking, for they only worship the senses. They do not understand that their souls are a Gift from God and so they give them away in the pursuit of perfection, which can never be theirs.<br />During The Warning, I will awaken within these souls the Truth as to Who they belong to. Pray that they will accept My Hand of Mercy. Woe to those Christians who have deserted Me in favour of new age paganism. They are the ones who do not want My Mercy and would prefer to dabble in nonsense, because it feeds their egos when they believe that they have the power to control matters of spirituality. While they seek personal perfection in this way, they cut themselves completely from God. By doing so, they open the door to the evil one, who will seduce and hypnotise them through the appeal of superstitious promises, which lead to their souls becoming barren where the Love of God cannot thrive.<br />Your Jesus<br /><br />Many souls are perishing in Hell because of the sin of pornography<br />Sunday Aug 28, 2011 at 05:00 pm<br />My dearly beloved daughter, hear My Most Holy Word as I warn mankind of the urgency to beg My Father for the forgiveness of their sins.<br />Time is short now, as The Warning is almost upon us. Never put off until tomorrow what you need to do today. Remorse for your sins is crucial, before you ask for your sins to be forgiven. For without genuine remorse it is useless.<br />So many blackened souls do I see in your world, My daughter. There is little Light and were you to witness the depths to which man has fallen, you would be shocked. So many millions of My children are plunging daily, into an abyss of sinful corruption, from which they will find it impossible to pull away unless you pray for them. They are blind to the Truth and even if they were to be shown My Light now, they would squirm and hide from Me. Pray for them.<br />My children who are guilty of hateful sin, enjoy the fact that their evil behaviour is applauded for its entertainment value. Pornography seeps into so many homes around the world, by TV channels, which present these evil atrocities as harmless, humorous fun – these same channels which refuse to speak My Name. Violence also is glamorized not only on TV, but in games, making them so acceptable that people now consider the act of violence a natural thing.<br />Satan’s demons, when they enter souls, begin to manifest in the human body so that their acts become clearly visible to My followers, who cringe in horror at what they have to bear witness to. The human body, infested with satanic demons will behave grotesquely. Their physical movements will be distorted and will emulate satanic messages used by the evil one to seduce like-minded weak people. Weak souls, empty of love for God, will be drawn towards them and will eventually emulate them so that they, too, will honour Satan and all he stands for in the way they too behave.<br />Children, can you not see how Satan works? My followers, you must tell those who do not understand how he works in the pornographic business. This is when Satan sets out to destroy souls and suck the participants into eternal fire. Those guilty of sexually deviant behaviour and those who flaunt their bodies in an obscene, immoral way will suffer excruciating pain for eternity.<br />Help save them now, children, for they have no idea how their immoral impurity disgusts Me. They are covered in darkness. Bring them to Me, so My Light can embrace them and save them from the fires of Hell.<br />Sins of the flesh are abhorrent to Me. So many souls are perishing in Hell because of the sin of pornography and sexually deviant acts. Let them know what their fate will be unless they show remorse.<br />Your beloved Saviour<br />Jesus Christ",long khanh,2021-04-14T12:48:50Z,0

"This is exactly what I needed. 🤍 Today I arrived back at uni after being home for a few weeks and as the evenings draw in sometimes I tend to feel a bit lost and alone at uni, a lot of the time I don&#39;t know what to do with myself. But this was perfect, I&#39;m so proud of myself for getting on the mat and taking the time to myself to do what&#39;s best for me. This has been the perfect end to my Monday and now I&#39;m telling myself i&#39;m going to have a good week back at uni, I&#39;m going to take things slow and enjoy myself as much as I can.

I started this video and the first thing you said was something like : you have already done the hardest part and that is to make this choice to do this practice.<br />You are right! Making that effort and committing to feel good is actually the hardest part and in the middle of the video I realised that I had made the best choice this morning.<br />You are truly an angel and I really wish you all the good things :) iloveyou &lt;3",Kanika Sharma,2021-04-11T03:15:48Z,1

Some kind of stretch starting lying face down (or maybe sphinx?), one leg somehow pulled up towards torso.

I would not normally have the confidence to post a comment, but since reading a book entitled: &#39;Women Who Run With The Wolves: Contacting the Power of the Wild Woman&#39; by Clarissa Pinkola Estés, my entire life-view is changing and I have realised that I don&#39;t need to be afraid anymore. So I would finally like to say thank you, your classes are always so enriching and you have a beautiful and genuine aura that translates clearly even on a video.<br /><br />If there is anyone here, male or female, struggling with anxiety, depression, or finding meaning in their lives, or is simply interested in gaining a wonderfully life-affirming perspective, then I would recommend the book with all my heart and soul to you.<br /><br />Hoping we all learn to cultivate and harness the power within, even in the face of condemnation. Sending love and power to you all, namaste!",H Spikey,2021-04-09T09:40:59Z,0
"this was so beautiful and needed thankyou so much. It is the day after my birthday (just turned 19) and i always feel so many emotions around this time of year, i can get quite overwhelmed.  this really helped to release all that no longer serves me to find new focus, grounding and strength.",Kalinda Antoniadis-Patel,2021-04-09T09:25:18Z,0

"Wow, I really really needed this yesterday. I am going through the most transitional time in my life that I have ever had. It&#39;s been hard, rough, tough, strange, with plenty of doubts and cognitive dissonance. Hearing you talk about the usual feeling of rush and go and do during the beginning of Spring and then backing it up with &#39;slow it down&#39; helped me to remember that I don&#39;t have to have all the answers right now. I don&#39;t have to know what I&#39;m doing next month, next year, hell, the next day. My only &#39;duty&#39; is to breath, to sit and feel during this time. To feel my feelings, to be one with myself, and go from there.<br /><br />Thank you Adriene for your loving words. Your practice always feel like the BFF hug that I needed that day and I will always be eternally grateful to you and your beautiful soul. Thank you and &lt;3 always.

I feel like a lot of us are dealing with this right now, and it&#39;s such a tricky one to navigate as it comes with so much tension and tightness in the body but at the same time my body feels so weak and exhausted that moving my body easily becomes too much and it&#39;s so hard to not get angry and frustrated with myself.

"Here’s my YWA success story: <br /><br />Injured my calf 15yrs ago and lost some mobility. I exercised regularly but guarded that calf. I could barely flatten my foot!<br />Got checked out at the physical therapist and they encouraged me to try yoga (specifically downward facing dog). <br />Here I am three months later, and I have about 95% of my range of motion back in my bad leg!  I can actually flex my foot without my calf fighting back. I get up in the morning, put my feet on the ground, and there’s no tightness and pain!<br />Thanks Miss Adriene and Benji.

"Hello Adriane, Sarah, Chris, Sumai, Benji and everyone on the community. Mary Frances here, from Rome with all my love. Been an active member for the last year, I am SURE I am not the only one saying that YWA and FWFG have been the main protagonists of my surviving the pandemic and lockdown. I am and forever will be immensly and deeply greatful. There is something I feel when I &quot;join you&quot; on my mat that I cannot express in words. But it must be CONNECTION, in all it&#39;s power. I also feel very sorry that this screen is between us all, and wondering how much more must we wait before we can physically be together again. (Not that distance won&#39;t be in the way for me anyway....but being able to dream about reaching you and joining somewhere around the world would still be great) Before this gets too long, I want to share with you the profound joy of being pregnant. This, in a way, has brought me away from the community for a while. I have found an amazing yoga Journey on youtube with a pregnant yogi that does videos every week and helps feeling connected, and I alternate those with some of YWA prenatal safe poses or with the member&#39;s prenatal videos, but 9 months is long to keep going with such small number of practices (for which I am ever so greatful). But today, almost at the end of my 5th month, I came back to the community and felt AT HOME. Will try this Renewal practice, but I can&#39;t help wondering everytime &quot;I hope this is appropriate for me&quot;. If only there was a little PS (Prenatal Safe!) logo in a little corner of each video it would help us &quot;mamas to be&quot; feel safe while connecting to you all. Feeling ever so connected and greatful. From my heart to yours, truly. Mary F.",Mary Calabria,2021-04-07T17:53:18Z,0

"Always perfect timing from Adriene. Had a long vacation weekend where I couldn&#39;t really relax. It was like &quot;relax&quot; was a command or a something to achieve. I caught a few moments of being in the present moment and truly enjoying the experience. Yet most of it was a state of worry, &quot;why can&#39;t you just relax?&quot; I returned home with guilt for wasting a weekend getaway, and this was the perfect practice to hit the reset button and work through whatever it is that is eating me away. So glad that YWA has helped me understand the gift of taking these moments with myself and for myself. Wishing everyone a wonderful week ahead.",Elle B,2021-04-06T15:10:22Z,0
"WOW! THAT CLASS!!!!!! <br />An amazing beginning for our Spring entry!  YWA has been a journey I had not expected ..... especially to bring all that it has for renewal in many ways. Adriene, I began with you (at the prompt of my 21-year-old daughter) with your February Calendar trying to recover from unexpected back surgery. I definitely needed a &quot;Bridge&quot; to began to slowly strengthen and be mindful of movements. Also, I needed a new mindset that I could sadly, no longer be a part of a 10-year SPINNING group. YOGA surprised me in so many ways. Your scaffolded teaching, example, and life coaching sincerity with joy have me hooked!<br />YOU make a difference ....obviously with soooo many others, too. Thank you for you, and especially for YOUR  journey in getting to a place to help us reconnect, renew and truly listen to get to where we envision ourselves to be - and most importantly to possibly even make a difference (ripple effect love!)  with those in our worlds........YWGA and our yoga mats have our backs!!! xoxoxoxoxoxoxooxox",sherry keihl,2021-04-06T15:10:18Z,0
"It&#39;s been a very hard day, but this practice felt like a warm shower allowing me to wash away all the pain and the frustration I was feeling. Is it all magically gone? No. But I was able to find almost an hour of stability, of &quot;me time&quot;, of peace. And that put all I was feeling before into a different perspective, becoming much more bearable. Thank you, because your practices always come at just the right time, like you can sense what I/we really need. Maybe you&#39;re a whimsical creature of the forests, in tune with the universe. Maybe it&#39;s just &quot;luck&quot;. Anyway, thank you from the bottom of my heart. Namaste!",Anna Serafini,2021-04-06T15:06:26Z,1

"I&#39;m so glad you said something about starting.<br /><br />I often go too far into a yoga practice without starting.<br /><br />Or I don&#39;t even want to start, usually because I can&#39;t.<br /><br />Or I try so hard, then lose it right before getting it.<br /><br />It&#39;s so frustrating being in hell, with no way out.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been here before, and I&#39;ve found a way out before.<br /><br />So I&#39;m going to keep at it. Just keep going. Just keep going.<br /><br />If you&#39;re in hell, or whatever you call it, do the same.<br /><br />The alternative is not worth it...I&#39;ve tried it.<br /><br />Whatever it is, will fade away naturally.<br /><br />Like stubbing your toe. Losing family. Poverty.<br /><br />Like fog on a mountain pass. Homelessness. It will pass.<br /><br />If it doesn&#39;t seem to, does being miserable improve it?<br /><br />If it does, is it a tactic you truly desire?<br /><br />What if there&#39;s another way...a way to cross over...<br /><br />A way to cross over more harmoniously?<br /><br />Sometimes I don&#39;t want to choose that...<br /><br />I don&#39;t want to be more, my blinders are on...<br /><br />I don&#39;t want to be more, the pain is too much...<br /><br />I don&#39;t have what it takes to be more...<br /><br />Yet I am, we are, always were, always will be.",Danielle LeClair,2021-04-06T02:58:13Z,0

"Today it felt really heavy for me to breathe, it was hard. My wrists couldn&#39;t take the pressure so during some downward dogs I did Childs pose to get a bit more focus on my breathing. I felt lost for most of this session, but still tried to hang on where I could.I also discovered that I use the left side of my body completely different from the right side. It made me question many times if I even should be doing the poses, if my body didn&#39;t do them even. Pushed through the thoughts and at the end, I&#39;m just glad I tried.",Sebina Timm,2021-04-05T21:52:59Z,0

"I got a question! Is there an alternative position to start yoga in other than crosslegged? This is actually a difficult position , and not overly comfortable, for me, and has been since I was young. As a child I sat with my legs folded under me when others sat crosslegged because the position isn&#39;t easy for me.",Kat Chitt,2021-04-05T16:28:21Z,1

"Hello ! I am not an expert or totally yogi or something but I just want to share what I know  and what I have learned from Adriene. So , If you are uncomfortable in crosslegged seat , I think it would be good start with laying down or legs folded under you. Legs folded under you is a common position in yoga , like crosslegged position. Important things are sitting up tall and  breathing deep. I believe in time, crosslegged position will be easier for you, regulary practise helps a lot.. Like Adriene says &#39;&#39; Find what feels good!&#39;&#39; .I hope  I could be helpful.Have a great day!",Deniz Korkmaz,2021-04-05T19:07:09Z,1

My yoga class closed due to pandemic (still no collective sport practice allowed here in Belgium) it took me 10 months to go back on the mat. I was so convinced that video yoga classes couldn’t help me with my yoga practice and I’m so happy that I was so wrong :) I’ve discovered your channel with January program and I took it as a challenge to show up everyday on my mat. It was so wonderful to me, it released my stress out and my neck pain. Since then I’m practicing almost everyday. A lots of love from Belgium :)",Elise Leonard,2021-04-05T15:32:16Z,0

"@Lewis Emanuel ルイス <br />It helped me manage my anxiety &amp; keep the damn thing on a leash! lol. It takes practice but stick with it, &amp; do other things too to help keep your mind occupied, or rather unoccupied really. Mediations, essential oils, healthy diet, healthy sleep habits,exercise (yoga), etc. All these things come together to help us heal mentally &amp; physically. Check out The Anxietys Guy&#39;s channel too if you haven&#39;t. Think he helped me the most mentally. Start with a small ten min commitment daily. Once you get used to that, you&#39;ll add more time as needed. <br />That&#39;s what I did. Somedays I still only get 15-20mins, but I make myself make time for that every day.  You have to make time for you to heal from anxiety. Just remember that if nothing else. Do things you enjoy, &amp; take time to just be still. Start your day with a 5 min meditation at least, &amp; you&#39;ll will eventually see a difference. <br />Hope this helps someone. Anxiety is a beast!! I wouldn&#39;t wish that on anyone!

Health benefits of Yoga👇<br /><br />Improves posture. Working for long hours on a desk could not only hurt your spine but also make you feel tired at the end of the day. <br /><br />• Increases flexibility. <br /><br />• Builds muscle strength.<br /><br />• Boosts metabolism. <br /><br />• Helps in lowering blood sugar. <br /><br />• Increases blood flow.,Daily Dose of Medicine,2021-04-05T05:01:08Z,21
"Also this is just the beginning! Yoga means union! Union with other people, with surroundings, with nature, and everything else that there is. Yoga is a way of seeing through the veil of separation and merging into harmony with the universe. Once you feel really good physically, you will feel really good mentally and then you want to share that good feeling with other people. Namaste!",Sadegh Tavana,2021-04-06T21:14:34Z,1
