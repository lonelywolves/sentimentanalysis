"Hello Adriene from Scotland🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿<br />I am proud of myself for showing up. I feel that I have a new friend now, meeting you every morning. Thank you for your warmth and kindness. <br />My body feels stronger, with more space, cleaner breaths and less stiff joints.<br />More than anything I’m loving the dopamine rush after working out. It helps me to meet the day in a happy way. Namaste 🙏",skyscraperwean,2021-03-27T11:26:49Z,0
"I&#39;m a few months late doing this journey but loving every minute!! With three kids 6 and under, my preference is to practice in the morning to start my day consciously. It doesn&#39;t always happen but its amazing at any time of day either way. Thanks Adriene!",The World n Us,2021-05-07T15:53:48Z,1

"I noticed how has my body and mind had changed since I started this journey. I feel better, calmer. I don&#39;t get angry so easily, and I&#39;m more aware of my body. I think I look prettier than before, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s cause of the yoga itself or it&#39;s me that&#39;s changing. My shoulders are a bit sore, but I feel stronger. It&#39;s easier for me to sit with my back straight, because I&#39;m an artist and I spend hours hunched over the table, painting or drawing, and this is helping me a lot with that. Now I&#39;m more cheerful than before. Today I found myself dancing and singing alone in the kitchen while doing the dishes, smiling and feeling so energetic! I love this feeling. I think that now I&#39;m gonna add this beautiful and wholesome habit to my daily routine for the rest of my life, cause this is absolutely perfect for my mind and body. Every time I finish one practice, I look forward to the next one.",Daiana Chaves,2021-04-06T02:21:46Z,1

I&#39;ve been going through a lot emotionally and physical discomfort was really building up. I started doing BREATH and now here I am on Day 15 and I feel it has been very supportive for me to meet my body where it&#39;s at and unlock some of the gunk and frustration I had tucked inside.

"Adriene, I cannot thank you enough for providing such an accessible life-changing  practice and teaching in such a special informative way that makes everyone feel comfortable, coming back, and wanting to feel and do good. I wouldn&#39;t have been able to afford  a consistent yoga class, and imagining my life without yoga is heartbreaking. Everyone should know about yoga and anyone who wants to try yoga should have that opportunity. It should be part of the K-12 curriculum, in my opinion. When I worked at a public library, most patrons didn&#39;t know what yoga was. That&#39;s when I got the idea to start a public library program that would show your 30 Day Yoga Journey classes, so those without computers or internet or a safe place could practice. Sadly, that idea never came to fruition. But it&#39;s never too late! Thank you for existing!",Amy Bauer,2021-02-23T16:17:29Z,1

"Hey there! I was wondering if I could provide a little constructive criticism as we practice today? <br />You do an amazing job of encouraging love for the body and for the soul, but sometimes during certain poses, someone like myself is unable to do a certain move due to extra fat/weight on the body. For example, when bringing the leg in a hands length from the sit bone .. some people might be unable to do so. Perhaps encouraging your students to bring their leg as close as they can with a little room, might be a better way to phrase it? I try to give myself grace and do the best I can, but sometimes that little voice of you&#39;re not good enough creeps in.<br />I think what you do is amazing! I&#39;m in no way trying to hinder your work. Simply a thought I&#39;ve had over the last few videos.I hope this comes across with love and support!

I so needed that. I haven&#39;t practiced for a few days because my Dad passed last Friday. I have honoured how I have been feeling and was just not in the right place to show up on my mat. That changed this morning so here I am picking up where I left off. My body felt so stiff as I started but it felt like it too knew we were in a safe place as we melted into the practice and let go of all that is happening around me right now. I like to say thank you every time I practice Adriene but today is the biggest thank you because I could hear you calling me back to the mat and reminding me that showing up is the hardest part. I am entering a new stage in my life. I am opening the door to being the authentic me at all times. Thank you Adriene. Namaste 🙏💕xx,Karen Lynne,2021-01-20T07:58:02Z,0

Yesterday was the first time I was able to go from lifting my legs in the three legged dog into a lunge without pushing leg forward. I struggled but my hips finally cooperated and pushed through it was such an amazing feeling. My hips are normally tight I have two kids (16/17) and its been &quot;never in their&quot; life that I have been able to feel by hips beginning to open up.

"Thank you, Adrienne.  I have been using your program since lockdown. Your message is simple but profound at this time. Also, want to mention a little tip for anyone who struggles with consistency: I usually preview the video before getting on the mat. On some days, when I like a particular one, I would repeat the following day instead of going on to the next video. In addition, on those days when I&#39;m repeating , I would mute the video, play from my laptop and find a piece of music that would be suitable to listen to and play through my earbuds.  Feels so good!! I&#39;m dancing and floating - such bliss!! Thank you again!!",Shaida Watson,2021-01-19T11:38:53Z,1

"I really appreciate how Adriene said, recommit to this choice you made for yourself. I missed a day, and I was feeling really crappy about it. I&#39;m a few days behind because I also did her Yoga for Self Doubt video on Friday when I had my interview for grad school instead of doing the breath video. Anyway, the video and the comments made me realize I shouldn&#39;t beat myself up, all I can do is arrive and enter into being my best self in the moment. I can&#39;t change the past, only what I am doing right now. I am recommitting to my choice of doing yoga everyday this year. Thank you Adriene &amp; commenters.",Jade Boyd,2021-01-19T02:53:33Z,2

"So today, in keeping with my new year&#39;s buzzword &quot;growth,&quot; I did something new and scary and went sky-diving for the first time! Within the first 10-20 seconds of free fall from 13,000 ft, I had the most intense sense of panic surrounding the fact that I couldn&#39;t easily breathe while hurtling through the air. So I looked inward and channeled this 30-day journey&#39;s focus and made myself breathe, and I relaxed, and then I was soaring, fully entering the wildest experience of my life.<br /><br />Coming to the mat tonight, I found extra connection in this practice even though I&#39;m a couple days behind: knocking on Heaven&#39;s door right away, which I felt I literally did today when I jumped out of an airplane - and then the suggestion of airplane arms in forward fold made me smile and know that today I did exactly what I was meant to do.

Since then he&#39;s done 2 YWA videos with me.",Nicole Letourneux,2021-01-17T20:57:30Z,1

"I just wanted to let you know I found out about you on a local women&#39;s chatter site I follow.  I thought I would give it a try and signed myself up for your Breathe series.  I haven&#39;t really done yoga before and wasn&#39;t sure I could even do it.  I am almost 50 and not one for workouts but have seen what a life of low activity and an unhealthy diet has done to my mom and I don&#39;t want to go down that road.  When I started doing your daily sessions in our living room, I got the attention of my 14 yr old son and my husband.  I went out and bought them yoga mats and they look forward to doing your yoga journeys with me every day.  I am so happy that I found out about your YouTube channel and got started.  I am seeing a real improvement in my flexibility and balance.  Thank you so much for offering this!",5Demin,2021-01-17T19:56:00Z,2

"When you prompted us to let something go, I spontaneously let go of &quot;the need to know.&quot; I feel so much of my energy goes to trying to know, to plan, to make the best choice, to try and control.

"I love the pace and rhythm of this journey.  Each session has its gifts, its challenges, and I do feel that--moment by moment, day by day, week to week--something is turning inside me, turning toward lightness and breath and a more fully integrated life.  It is not like a light switch, nor is it so slow as to be undetectable.  I feel and notice the little changes, and am finding that connecting more consciously with the breath brings a kind of radical honesty about where I am in the world now.  Maybe that raw (not always easy or even welcome--it seems to require some loss and real grief) honesty is one of the hallmarks of this moment in our collective experience, as well as our individual lives.  Thank you, Adriene, for your illimitable generosity and wisdom.  About to sink into DISCIPLINE! Namaste.",Courtney Bickel Lamberth,2021-01-17T15:34:21Z,1

Your soothing voice and focus on breathing, gently guiding one is so comforting.

"I&#39;m going to be honest. Today was the hardest day to get to the mat. I spent half the practice in child&#39;s pose feeling like I wasn&#39;t good enough to take this time, or that yoga is silly, or that I&#39;ll never make it to 30 days.<br /><br />But I showed up even when I really didn&#39;t want to. And it doesn&#39;t matter if I didn&#39;t do every pose. Or if my heart was only half in the practice. Because tomorrow is a new day to arrive. And maybe it&#39;s just as important that I show up on the &quot;bad&quot; days as it is that I show up when it&#39;s easy to do so. <br /><br />Thank you all for practicing with me. Knowing that others are showing up when it&#39;s hard got me to my mat today. I love you all.",Marisa,2021-01-17T05:34:57Z,2

"It has been a crazy start to the new year, for so many, of course. And I started this series January 1st and second, fully intending to commit. But after the first week, I was caught up in moving to a new place and starting a new job. There is so much indecision and uncertainty. Yesterday, I came back to the mat with Adriene&#39;s &quot;Yoga for Transitions&quot; practice. And today, I rejoined all of you, with &quot;Enter&quot;. It feels fitting. I love this anchor of yoga practice, and I hope I can truly make this apart of my daily routine in the days, weeks, and months to come. &lt;3",musicsummer12,2021-01-17T04:14:51Z,1

I was in turmoil all day trying to figure out if I could make time for two sessions in one day to catch up, or if I would just keep going one day behind. I love doing yoga as a community, and I’m so happy to say that once I got on the mat today I caught back up to all of you lovely people!

"When going from that high lunge to warrior two, I fell right over. Just super ate it. And I was angry at myself for a little while, that I couldn&#39;t get this pose and transition right. But then I remembered what Adriene said earlier about finding humor and humility in practice, so I just laughed at myself a little and moved on. If there&#39;s someone out there who needs to hear it like I needed to hear it just now: even warriors fall down sometimes.

"Yes! I&#39;m a little late this year and completely lost my balance while transitioning to halfway lift. First I was baffled that I had trouble with a move I must have done a thousand times over the last 8 years, then I saw the humor in it and just laughed it off. I think that getting better at yoga does not mean doing all the poses perfectly, it is better measured by how kind you can be to your self after having an &#39;oops&#39; moment and as you said, by showing up",Anja Tolpekina,2021-03-11T11:30:19Z,2

"I really liked this one! I don&#39;t know if it has a name, but the pose that looks like Warrior 2 with a twist was fun to do. <br />My cat started to walk around the mat at the end of the practice and then kept on headbutting me while I was in Savasana, so I got the chance to laugh a bit too 😁 Gracias por tu generosidad siempre, nos veremos mañana.",Romina C,2021-01-17T00:49:25Z,1

"Today my body felt so heavy and tired I doubted I could make it to the end of the session. But thanks to Adriene I was up to find what feels good, so today I did what I felt was best for my body. I replaced some of the table top and downward facing dogs for a calm and deep flow of stretching in the hips and legs, and that felt wonderful! At the end of the sesion I re-joined to that yummy floor twists and after all I felt amazing for adapting to what my body demanded today🙏🏻 Reminder that every practice is different and that listening to your body is the most important thing, much more than &quot;completing&quot; all the secuences no mather what.

The great thing about this format is when you are discombobulated you can back it up and watch closely.

"I&#39;ve been practicing yoga on some level for more than 20 years. Never have I ever managed to commit to it as a daily practice until now. I think I always thought I needed 90 minutes (which is what we practice when I attend my local studio). And though a 90 minute practice is lovely...I can&#39;t manage that daily. These are perfect, and I&#39;m feeling super for having practiced 15 days straight! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Adriene for this challenge. I can&#39;t see ever going back from here.

"This was a magical practice. I went to Carl Schurz Park in NYC, which is on the East River. Local Christmas trees have been freshly wood chipped and lovingly spread all over their incredibly beautiful park. I set up under a fairy tale tree (secretly glad that there were no children yet - it&#39;s the perfect spot for climbing and exploring). As I sat down, I observed two cats, with different owners, walking into the area on leashes. They met. Their humans met. They encountered a dog. I laughed with the humans and said it&#39;s like out of A Nightmare Before Christmas: the dog has entered &quot;cat park town&quot;. It was such a cathartic re-commitment ceremony that, coupled with the built-in aroma therapy from the pine clippings, really made me feel connected to all of you. Namaste Kula YWA.",Laura S.

"Today was strange. This morning when I woke up I was journaling and I mentioned how grateful I am to have come back to yoga. I was doing it consistently from April 2020-June2020 and then I stopped and I don&#39;t really know why. I asked myself this in my journal. &quot;Why did I stop doing yoga?&quot; I concluded in my journal that it doesn&#39;t matter, I can&#39;t change what I didn&#39;t do, I can only change what I&#39;m about to do. And I showed up on the mat. <br /><br />On the mat I figured out why I stopped. <br /><br />During today&#39;s practice, I missed going into warrior II on my left side. I kind of got off the tracks and went ahead of Adriene and realized what I forgot when I was in cobra. I just started feeling terrible. I don&#39;t think in words, like I don&#39;t have a narrative going on in my head, my thoughts visual and I feel them deeply. So I felt just pure negativity. I anchored my breath and worked through that and synched up with Adriene. <br /><br />Then I got to the floor and did the twist and because I have a bigger chest and a stomach, I don&#39;t have a lot of room and although i can bring my leg up, I don&#39;t feel good. Its not solely about comfort, but just not looking like what Adriene is doing. My thoughts came back and negativity came to sore again. Twice in a session. <br /><br />And this is why I stopped doing yoga in 2020. These intrusive thoughts about not following or not looking like what is being shown in the video. I stopped because after three months of yoga in 2020 I still was meeting these intrusive thoughts. They weren&#39;t going away. <br /><br />I learned something today on the mat: My thoughts are not me, but they will be constant visitors. What I can do is control my actions, my choices. It&#39;s then up to my thoughts to leave or stay. <br /><br />What a gift I found today. I truly entered into something that is going help me throughout my life.",Lisa Alves,2021-01-16T19:44:06Z,0

Woo hoo!!! Here we go onto the next half! So very thankful for this community :) I have noticed that it&#39;s getting easier to get into poses. I am also using my breath off of the mat and in my daily life. My joints and muscles feel better and looser. I am also using some gentle movements when I notice I am tense throughout the day.

"Hello Adrienne and dear community. Adrienne, For me you are the best, cheerful, professional and good looking view behind your mat in each session. Today&#39;s practice 16 was good, complete but speedy in some chain movements, at least for me. After yoga I have good energy for my day and my family. I find that it gives strength to my body and resilience to my mind and heart. Tks an awful lot for this January challenge, conducted so well, with many challenging postures and you, always giving us a real boost, Adrienne.

"This year started with a friend very suddenly and shockingly getting hospitalized, and entering hospice. This morning she passed. Every day of the last 2 weeks I have been dedicating my time on the mat to her peaceful passing, and simultaneously using it as a reminder of the blessings of health and movement for my own mostly mobile body. As we move into the next half, I can only re dedicate to health, and peace, and movement, and joy. Wherever we may find it.",tkbdesign,2021-01-16T18:44:08Z,243

"I went to a yoga class 2 days after my father died of cancer. As I lay there in “corpse” pose tears came to my eyes and I felt warm, tingly, supported on the mat, and completely at peace. I am not a religious person, but I feel that must be as close to the afterlife as I can imagine. I thought, if this is what my father felt slipping away from life, it’s pretty wonderful. I hope yoga helps you heal in the way it did (and continues to do!) for me.",Dana Kleinhesselink,2021-01-17T02:22:23Z,9

"I don’t like knocking on Heaven’s door, like ever. I always do it but never allow myself to feel anything but irritation and annoyance. I had such a bad stank attitude when we started out with it. But at some point, I assume during the breathing, I actually began to accept this movement. Do I like the action now? Hell no, I still don’t like it. But I accept it for what it is, I accept the fact I don’t like it and might not ever. This is a metaphor for my life. There will be people and things I don’t like-including myself-sometimes.

"Fifteen days consecutive, it&#39;s been the longest streak I&#39;ve done yoga ever since! I notice the amazing shift that I&#39;m having by meditating every morning, and doing yoga. However, it&#39;s starting to get harder and harder to get on the mat. It&#39;s a journey, but also a challenging one in that and I love you Adriene for it! &lt;3 <br />It&#39;s out of my comfort zone, and therefore I&#39;m building more character. Something that I had set an intention for of doing so this year. So much gratitude to you, and Benji ;-) &lt;3",Jordi Martin,2021-01-16T12:14:42Z,2

"Today&#39;s practice was great... in theory. Brain fog made me quite confused about the high lunge to warrior 2 transition, and I had to pause and rewind 3 times, getting more frustrated each time as I just couldn&#39;t get which legs and arms went where. In retrospect it&#39;s quite funny, especially when I hear myself again saying &quot;WHAT?!&quot;. I guess I got the playfulness of the practice in a different way and with a little delay :D Otherwise, this &quot;enter&quot; theme is perfect, as always. I&#39;m getting ready for what&#39;s next with BREATH and a new chapter in my life. Thanks Adriene, for offering the ideal tools for awareness and growth. Now, I look forward to some sweetness!

Bittersweet halfway point. This month&#39;s practice has helped me fall in love with the daily movement!,Codi Potter,2021-01-16T10:42:34Z,5
"Yeah!! I made it! 15 days everyday, every morning. It feels good! And you know the funny thing? I usually get up up around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ0J5Sj_0Yw&amp;t=6m30s"">6:30</a> to meditate and check in on this journey but today is Saturday and I totally entered in the cozy area, I was generous with myself and I just slept a little bit longer. And the best part is that I was able to journey this day 15 with sun shining on my face because usually it&#39;s still dark outside ;) so Adriene always gives a perfect motto and my higher self shows me that I am releasing, trusting and evolving one day at a time. Thank you all out there in this global community! And let&#39;s keep the commitment to show up on the mat and check in on this beautiful journey tomorrow. Yes I can. Yes you can. Yes we can. May this day bring you Love, harmony and joy.",Cristina Belo,2021-01-16T10:42:33Z,0

"I fell of my bike during the first week and had to rest for 4 days. Normally this would totally derail me and I would give up, but I decided it was worth it to do multiple sessions each day until I was back on track, and I was so right!

"This is my first year following the 30 days in real time and I am enjoying showing up to the mat each day. It really is a sanctuary practicing YWA, especially during these difficult times. I found today&#39;s practice a challenging one; I was quite achey and struggled to &#39;feel good&#39;, I was quite wobbly through some of the poses, but I kept going and I feel so much better for preserving and completing practice, maybe even more so than usual. Best wishes to all of you - and a little extra love for those finding it tough today 💗🧘‍♀️ Namaste x",Lala Calli,2021-01-16T09:48:12Z,1

"I&#39;m entering into the future, as &#39;the best, most beautiful version of myself&#39;, of course. I&#39;ve been having a somewhat rough week emotionally, with very little motivation to work towards my goals. But somehow during this practice, I realised that today&#39;s worries and goals are not necessarily the things I&#39;ll care about and strive towards further in the future. So I should just focus on the now, find what feels good and not worry if, in some weeks, my productivity levels are not so great. In the big picture, it might not matter at all. Namaste, everyone, and greetings from the snow-clad Riga, Latvia. 💜",u_k,2021-01-16T09:47:14Z,0

"I love so much how you tell us to wear comfy clothes, for so long I thought I had to look a certain way to do yoga, like wearing the newest lulemon pants, having perfect hair and a pristine mat. Now I do yoga in my pyjamas, morning hair, disheveled and it&#39;s the best. If this past year taught me anything, it&#39;s that life is better in comfy clothes, and you always feel better after yoga!",M H,2021-01-16T09:43:22Z,71
"Same! Always so much pressure we put on ourselves, now I just wear comfy warm clothes and practice on a blanket! Not even a mat! I lost mine at the gym before quarantine. So I told myself I will get a new one if I do 30 days of yoga with Adrienne. In the meantime, the blanket will have to do! And to be honest, it has taught me that you need nothing but your body and the intention to do yoga. At this point I’m even thinking of the yoga Matt as an extra, but not necessary. To think before COVID-19 I was even looking into ‘yoga socks’ lol!!",Marta,2021-01-21T22:36:12Z,1

I suffer from chronical back pain and the last days were pretty tough. But this journey helps to forget the pain for a little time.

Makes me feel taller and more confident.<br />b. I am more patient while dealing with my toddler. (Still a long way to go; he&#39;s in THAT phase.)<br />c. My body feels more flexible, especially the hip flexors.<br />d. I catch myself getting overwhelmed at times. Then, i stop and actively do a few counts of Ujjayi breath. It makes me feel calmer and more centered.<br />e. On the whole, my mood seems more lifted, in spite of the daily ups and downs.<br />This is my first 30 day yoga journey with Adriene and I am doing my best to stick to it everyday. Loving it so far! Thank you for this wonderful practice Adriene ❤️<br />My fellow Yogis, I invite you to check in with yourself and reflect on the changes that you have noticed so far in yourself at this halfway mark. Even though the changes are small, like mine are, they are so encouraging to drive us to come to the mat everyday and give it our best. Thank you all! Much love 💕",Kavya Shekar,2021-01-16T08:39:00Z,1

Hello from Massachusetts!! <br />Today was the first day I felt that good post-workout soreness (in my hips &amp; butt!) <br />I really pushed myself to “dig deep” like Adriene encourages us to do and my chair pose was on point yesterday!!  Today.... WOOHOO i could feel it!! <br /><br />Congrats to everyone making it 1/2 way (Day 15) I’m sad we’re already at the half way mark of this journey instead of feeling happy/relieved to be halfway done. 🤩 Its a real life glass 1/2 full metaphor.  <br /><br />💜🖤CHEERS TO EVERYONE THAT IS STILL HERE &amp; COMMITTED TO THEIRSELVES!! 🖤💜<br /><br />🙏 Namaste,Amanda Hebert,2021-01-16T08:08:36Z,1
"This practise was a challenge tonight... I felt unbalanced and tight, crossing my legs at my knees and trying to hold my feet was the hardest thing. I even had to adjust child&#39;s pose to the wide legged version to help me breath deeply after it warrior poses. A lot to work on in this practise :D 🙏",Aquarius Macpherson Heta,2021-01-16T07:50:40Z,3
"I honestly could have written your comment word for word. I felt quite wobbly trying to do the &#39;curtsey&#39; posture and lean over to the side. I also find child&#39;s pose difficult at the best of times and have to modify it to extended child&#39;s pose -if I try and kneel then bend forward I just keep going! But we came to practice and we challenged ourselves today, we kept going - so well done! 😊 🧘‍♀️👍🏻 X",Lala Calli,2021-01-16T09:32:29Z,0

"Ok so day 15, super challenging for me to show up on the mat today as my head is very heavy this morning because of my sinus allergy for the past two days. But I made it and moved a little slowly than Adriene, honoring my body and mind and moving with awareness and trying to ENTER mindfully in to the next half of this amazing journey. Thank you Adriene for getting us on to the mat and enjoying these practices and welcoming each new day with something equally new to receive and embrace ❤️",Tasneem Siahiwala,2021-01-16T06:30:07Z,2

Can we perform this challenge when we have time or is it essential to do it everyday in a row?,BEAUTY SHORTS,2021-01-16T06:04:33Z,2
"I have done some of her other challenges over the course of the pandemic, and I found that certain days I had to do different videos due to limited time (she has some videos that are as short as 5-7 mins) or soreness and then return to the challenge a day or two later. So it ended up taking me 50-60 days instead of 30. As long as I maintained some sort of daily practice, I still got the benefits. I&#39;ll also note that most of the 30-day videos stand well on their own, but it&#39;s nice to go in order to experience the progression/build of the challenge.",rachelrossos,2021-01-16T06:52:36Z,1
