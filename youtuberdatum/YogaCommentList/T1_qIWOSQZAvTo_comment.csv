"I somehow hurt my sciatica during the day 5 practice and I didn’t feel brave enough to ignite today! But I didn’t want to skip completely either, so I followed your old sciatica video. It’s not the same, but I’m happy I didn’t use this as an excuse to skip one day!",RachelTheBookDragon,2021-04-30T01:26:50Z,0
Are their any other positions to you use when you are using boat pose? I can&#39;t do a lot of those because I will get really bad burning pain in my left hip and don&#39;t feel it in my mid section because of that so I felt really disappointed that I didn&#39;t get to work as hard as I could have since I can&#39;t use that pose a lot :(,shanawnee90,2021-04-26T19:26:53Z,0

"Hi Adriane and all other home=yogi&#39;s. Thank you so much for all your wonderful practices. I&#39;m following you already for some months on a (almost!) daily basis! 😀 This ignite, core training I just finished was quite something. Normally this is my weak point, put I did better then I expected! Also what you said made a point:&quot; Be kind to this area. It&#39;s y our energy center&quot;. Almost all my life I have a kind of &#39;hate&#39; relation with my belly. I find it to big. But actually I deny my energie through that kind of thinking! And I think many, many women aren&#39;t happy with their belly.... So thanks again Adrianne for your beautiful work  and silly jokes. I appreciate it very much!! 😀😂 👍 🌸 🦋 ❤️🌷",Ellen Bekema,2021-04-02T06:42:40Z,0

This was a really difficult practice for me...I didn&#39;t do nearly as well as I wanted to. I felt discouraged when my one leg muscle started to spasm and I couldn&#39;t finish the boat poses. What I found in this practice was that I don&#39;t always have to do well. I don&#39;t always have to define my strength by what I accomplish but by the simple act of being willing to try. So today was a lesson in loving myself in the midst of struggle and I believe it was a good practice for me because of that.,Debra Schooley,2021-02-08T16:46:11Z,2

Coming back to &quot;home&quot; and to a tough day 6 a year later - it&#39;s still hard.  I still fail.  But this year I held the planks the entire time.  Boat is a mystery to me - maybe next year?? third time is a charm?????,Christine Moon,2021-02-07T02:16:09Z,7

"Surprised at how difficult this was, even after doing 30 days of Breath. Had been feeling really strong going into my 5th straight week of daily yoga, but this humbled me for sure! Also not a great first day for my husband to try to join me. We got our ab workout from laughing at each other instead :)",Elle B,2021-02-06T20:23:40Z,10
"Very humbling for me too, the abdominal days feel so much harder than the other days. I just finished Breath too, and still this day 6 was waaaay too much (boat poses)! I do think having one killer crunch day just isn’t in balance with the other days, but it IS a good way to build another muscle called listen to my own body and stop trying to be enough when it feels wrong to keep forcing myself into a pose.

"I decided to do the Home 30 days after the 30days of breath, I started on day 3 so that it would be 28 days for Feb, today was day 6, while I could not sit up and do the legs in and out, I tried very hard, but it was not going well, so I laid on my back and did leg lifts the same way, but straight out and breathed with Adriene, and it was great still tough, but really good.  So thank you for always saying do it your way.",Glory-Anne Harvey,2021-02-04T14:15:42Z,4

"I work out a lot but have NEVER been able to lift both my legs up lying flat on the ground. I think it&#39;s because my legs are long relative to my torso, and my center of gravity low. If I try to lift my legs from lying flat, or lower them straight down from a full boat, my torso will just fly up. Conversely, it&#39;s easy for me to lift my torso up while legs stay flat on the ground. Does anyone else have this problem? I managed to get through this practice by lowering one leg at a time.",soundslikesushi,2020-11-28T10:39:55Z,0

"In the midst of a pandemic, our family is moving to another country.  My friend recommended Adriene&#39;s 30 day yoga and it has been very healing for me.  After day 6, I made an intention to not worry about the future and all the things I have to do as we prepare to leave the US, but to hold this moment, this second, and be calm.  Thank you, Adriene, for your peaceful presence, combined with your little quirky ways...my morning yoga with you has opened up grace and lovingkindness.",Karen Mittet,2020-11-27T18:11:17Z,0

I literally almost cried during that sidewards crunch. I managed to do a few on each side but it got so hard I turned over and wanted to cry.

So most of this session I just did random other exercises BUT I spent the whole time with you and never left .... right?🙄<br /><br />I&#39;ve broken my back so I can&#39;t do as much as you can do and I&#39;m not flexible at all but what matters is I have dedicated my time for this challenge.,Alannah Hatt,2020-11-26T14:19:01Z,0
Boat was fine until she moved from left to right on the inhale. Always gets me to start overthinking. How much do I lean? Do my legs stay straight ? Should I be moving as fast as her ? Am I doing it right ? What if I’m holding tension in my neck? <br /><br />Apparently it’s not resonating with me on how to make it your own and stay present. I can’t help but think too much about doing something right or wrong,PryJunaD,2020-11-25T22:44:06Z,0

"Can you add a practice to build stability for those of us with hyper-mobility and ED, or maybe add modifications for us? There are so many options for yoga for those who are not as flexible, but little attention is paid to those of us who are overly flexible, have instability, and constantly are pulling muscles/ligaments. I have so much muscle wastage in my hips and wrists (I pull a muscle every time that I scoop ice cream!), and would love to build stability in those areas, but youtube options are so limited, and doing workouts without modifications for me often end up hurting me. I didn&#39;t realize that I pulled a muscle in my right wrist with today&#39;s practice until after I had finished, because over-flexing doesn&#39;t hurt me, so my brain doesn&#39;t tell me to stop...",Victoria Maheshwari,2020-08-15T17:50:21Z,0

For some reason I’m really frustrated with this routine. Idk if it’s just me but boat pose is extremely uncomfortable for my tail bone. It’s weird because my glutes are pretty large but do not provide enough padding. I even tried putting a folded towel underneath and it still killed. I’ve been doing Yoga with Adriene for almost three months now and am kicking myself in the butt for not being able to complete this. What am I doing wrong?

"I rarely ever comment, but I sincerely want to say thank you for today. I have been struggling with my weight for years and I always was referred to as the bigger sibling (between my sister and me). It has definitely made me not appreciate or love me enough. I started my journey with you 36 days ago. I did your first 30 days and now I am here. I feel honoured and blessed to feel as though I am figuratively &#39;caught&#39; when I fall. Continue to inspire people. I promise you, you are saving more people than you realise.

I was also missing many days.<br /><br />I have started the journey again, this time doing it every day. And this time, when those scary boat poses arrived, I used the lessons we&#39;ve learned so far: I listened to my body (my back muscle flare up very easily), made modifications as needed--pride be damned!--, and tried to better follow along with my breath.<br /><br />IT WENT SO MUCH BETTER!

Hi Adriene. I have been following your programme. New to yoga. i am hooked. 60 this month and never dreamed i can come anywhere near some of the amazing yoga poses. BUT today i was hopeless and no way can do the boat pose and side roll stuff. Youch. Back cant cope. Need more core strength i guess. Suggestions? ps. benji is really cool. My spaniels are not quite into yoga,Penny Hoare,2020-06-07T07:23:56Z,0

Hi there! New to yoga so I have a pretty basic question. I think I’m putting too much weight on my wrists when doing planks. I’ve tried to “claw through the fingers” but it doesn’t seem to relieve much pressure. Sometimes to do so I even end up on my knuckles (palms off the mat) which I’m sure probably isn’t the best. Any tips? Thanks a ton!,Sam Roberts,2020-06-05T16:59:36Z,0

I just received your email where you express support for the Black community and identify your need to self-educate and do something useful about systemic racism.

"Can anyone offer advice on how to partially modify some of the plank and boat poses? I don’t want to completely go down to my knees or elbows as then I don’t feel nearly as much of the muscle work, but I also hurt my lower back and shoulder trying to keep up with these exercises today. My muscles aren’t strong enough to support myself properly, but I also don’t want to modify it so far that I’m not building the muscles I need. Any advice is appreciated!!",Molly Labine,2020-05-18T20:34:55Z,0

Sadly I have a spinal injury that makes it almost impossible to do core poses where so much weight is on the lower back (like where the only point of contact is my butt, even if I add some support like touching the ground). Other than plank for 5 hours, what are some core strengthening moves that are more gently on the lumbar spine? I want to feel strong and able to complete HOME.

"My Dad had a true story: I stick to the moral of it. He was v fit man(until he became ill with emphysema at 60). After a time in hospital he got in pool expecting to at least swim a length or two. Nope had to hang onto side. Was v saddened. There was an elderly v old man doing many lengths. He swam over. Advised: swim No more than 1/4 length. do that a few days. Then 1/2 length, few days. The do 3/4 length, few days. The...do 1/2 a length....then 3/4 then  then one whole length..few days... keep doing that rhythm(of gradual build up, but then go back for a day or two) This makes so much sense. We get confidence by realizing how far we have gone... even if has to be very small steps.  Small steps are the very biggest for some. Well done to me. And thank you to Adriene",Lesley Beckett,2020-05-06T09:52:26Z,44

My breath practice has come a long way and I&#39;m so happy! For the first time, I was able to truly trust myself and recognize my inner strength. Thank you Adriene xox",Sky Carroll,2020-04-27T15:40:30Z,0

"I’ve decided to commit myself to this 30 day yoga series, I’m on day 6 now, which I’m super glad, I’ve havent been able to find the time or kept giving myself excuses before this pandemic happened. I’m actually pretty glad I’ve started this, it really helped with the stress and I have felt so much better, at peace,  confident, and empowered doing these workouts these few days. This day, ive got to say, i’ve started getting emotional when Adriene started talking about how “off the mat, things are hard and we are so hard on ourselves but we have to remember we have the strength and the tools to get through it and how she mentioned about not giving enough love to our bellies/solar plexus area really made me tear up. That affirmation was powerful.  I am strong, I am resilient, I am beautiful, I am powerful and will get through this! We will get through this!

"I was tired, sore, and anxious about not being productive (I&#39;ve done a lot of productive things since the lockdown, so anxiety really is just a troll) before this video. I couldn&#39;t keep up with a lot of it, especially the core workout since crunches give me muscle cramps. But after all of that we got to that balance hover pose I blurted out to the TV &quot;I love her&quot;. She seemed to know exactly when I needed motivation or when I needed permission to rest. I&#39;m on my last day of PMS, so my muscles are not helpful right now, but I still don&#39;t feel discouraged. Progress isn&#39;t linear, and I&#39;ve come to realize that with this program. My balance is better, my body feels lighter, I can lift my legs higher. I&#39;m a clutz with ADHD, so this really helps. Thank you so much, Adriene!",Wannabanauthor,2020-04-25T18:41:29Z,0

Adriene&#39;s words are actually super motivating and just the positivity that she approaches each movement with, even when they are super hard. We are doing amazing, and it&#39;s okay to struggle.

"I used to be very athletic a decade ago, and now have a very weak core and arms because of a cervical injury and also IBS, there are major limitations to what I can and cannot do without hurting myself. It broke my heart how weak I felt while trying to do these poses so I just started crying in the middle of the session! I barely ever cry! Going to wait for a couple of hours and see how my neck and stomach feel about this, if all is good i&#39;ll keep doing Day 6 once a week in addition to whatever Day i&#39;m on ... hopefully it&#39;ll help me get stronger. Thanks for the great videos Adriene!",Haniyeh Mirdamadi,2020-04-13T02:00:33Z,0
"Thank you so much Adriene for your time and energy you offer to all of us. I love your videos!! I really like how relaxed, silly and real you can be. It&#39;s obvious you like to have fun doing this but you also take it seriously and offer great modifications. I am loving this 30 day journey! Day 6 I definitely felt was more challenging. Day 1 I struggled with just one down ward dog and now I can already feel I am getting stronger and am happy to come into that pose. Thank you so much for getting many of us  through this social distancing time. I hope to make this a regular practice and I am looking forward to Day 7! :)",Rachelqueen29,2020-04-13T00:35:36Z,1
"I am so glad I came to the comment section after this session. Like most people, I definitely could not do this whole session, I could&#39;t even do one boat lift. I didn&#39;t realize just how nonexistent my core strength was. Thank goodness my dogs were there to give me love when I wasn&#39;t giving it to myself laying on my mat. I will probably take a break for lunch and do day 7 this afternoon. Thank you to everyone who shared their experience below and thank you to Adriene for pushing all of us to be and do our best.",Tabbitha Boren,2020-04-12T18:08:50Z,217

I&#39;ve been practicing yoga for so many years. Some years up to 5x a week and other years once a month. Throughout all my practice I have never been successful when it comes to the ab exercises. Within the last two years I&#39;ve been weight training a lot more and today for the first time ever I actually did the entire workout. I could do the hollow hold into the boat pose over and over while focusing on my breath. I almost cried with gratitude towards my body for the first time ever.

"As a beginner, I really did not like this one. The previous days provided useful modifications, so I always felt like I was still getting something out of the routine even if I wasn&#39;t able to do the complete movement. With all these boat poses I felt like this was a wasted day. I couldn&#39;t do more than three in a row, and there were no useful modifications so I just had to wait and hope that we would move on to something I could do at least a little. This was so frustrating I didn&#39;t end up finishing the day. I want to build up strength an do better, and  this just made me feel left behind.",nemene,2020-04-09T12:21:36Z,1

I love to follow your videos and take the time to breathe and just focus on what I&#39;m doing in the moment rather than everything else going on in the world. I have a mat that is pretty old and I used before I actually started getting really into yoga and I&#39;m looking to invest in a new one! I was just wondering if there are any mats that you suggest, specifically ones that help with sweaty palms/feet?? Thank you so much!!:)",Jaedyn Harvey,2020-04-06T21:25:16Z,0

"I commented in a previous video, in different words probably, about how I felt an intense rush of energy at the end, saying &quot;namaste&quot;, where I ended up with tears in my eyes. Today was equally as strange and unexpected because, although some things are getting easier, I had a really rough time physically, and couldn&#39;t seem to loosen up and do things in a way that felt beneficial to my body. But instead of getting pissed off at myself and giving up to watch Adriene do the rest of the repetitions, as I have until this point, I burst out in laughter at my struggles and kept pushing on until I really couldn&#39;t any more. Which was a really awesome surprise. I definitely found a new strength during today&#39;s video.. Much love to all those out there doing this as well, and who are going through their own struggles on their unique journey &lt;3 And shout out to all those taking the path of self-love during this global pandemic.

"I struggled with this one. I felt sad because the perfectionist in me was saying that I should&#39;ve done more. But then a bigger part of me says that I shouldn&#39;t be too hard on myself. That since I&#39;m starting out it would be harder for me to do certain poses and that&#39;s okay. <br /><br />I wanted to cry during the practice due to me struggling through the moves but I didn&#39;t. I had to pause the video but that&#39;s okay. I needed to catch my breath and since it is my practice I honored what my body needed at that moment. <br /><br />Yoga reminds me that I can take my own pace and that I can be strong one day and that I can be not so strong  the next. It takes time to realize that sometimes we are being too hard on ourselves.<br /><br />Thank you, Adrienne, for this practice. Hoping to continue this journey with you.

"I’ve been running 5k each day and doing small ab circuits on top of this yoga and usually this helps with my aches and really stretches them out but today when I seen ignite and how it was all on the core, I could have cried because my core was already crying for help beforehand😂 That definitely made this harder but I stuck through it all and I’m so glad because after it I feel fantastic.

"Wow, today was a really good yoga session. Based on the comments, I expected the worst, so I told myself: even if I can only do 25% of the poses, I showed up and tried. I really pushed myself (in the good way) through the planks and only rested during two of the side boat poses. Thank you Adriene for helping me see my full potential. Now I feel confident that I can complete this journey :)))",Arianne Tremblay,2020-04-02T17:27:34Z,0

Here I am a week later doing day 6, and hearing Adrien saying &quot;if you were able to do day 6, you&#39;ll make it&quot;. I feel so empowered. But I changed my view about the practice. I thought it is a reward to myself for doing so well, and that&#39;s what got me through the first 5 days.

"Yes, yes, yes! I now know what softening your gaze means!<br /><br />Last night, as I fell asleep, my brain played out the home &#39;theme&#39; music and I felt so pleased anticipating the next mornings class.<br /><br />I realised that softening ones gaze is to realise how much time we spend, our eyes small and furrowed with worry.<br /><br /> <br />Definition:To soften is that mildly self pleased feeling one feels after ones muscles quiver and shiver, and Adrienne says in that soothing voice, trust yourself. :)",Priya Mirza,2020-03-29T03:05:24Z,0

"Not going to lie, this has been the hardest day for me thus far. I struggle so much with confidence and feelings of inadequacy and during those boat poses a lot of those struggles came to the surface. I ended up lying on my back and close to tears for most of that portion of the practice. But isn&#39;t that the beauty of yoga? This practice is meant for us to not only become more attuned to our physical state, but our mental and emotional state as well. I am grateful that even though I struggled hard through today&#39;s practice, it gave me the space and the safety to explore some of my inner struggles. I plan on returning to Day 6 in a few day&#39;s time to see if I can challenge some of the negative voices that found their way into my head today. Until then, I am excited to return back to my mat for Day 7 tomorrow and so very thankful for this beautiful, thoughtful, and compassionate community. &lt;3",rebeccakathleenmusic,2020-03-26T14:00:47Z,0
"I have started this 30 day series as the current Covid-19 lockdown is happening in Ireland. I have finally gotten into a routine of working from home and this yoga series has become part of that routine. I&#39;ve taken to doing a practice after 5pm when I finish working but today in Ireland it is a beautiful spring day but there is now more restrictions on movement and interaction. So instead, on my lunch break I did this practice in my back garden. I paused for a moment as I watched a butterfly fly by. It is a difficult time for everyone, and I am concerned and often stressed for my sister who is a doctor on the front line of this crisis. But I am thankful for this yoga practice, this sunny day and my increasing strength and resilience. Our health is truly our wealth. Namaste.",Cara O'Mahony,2020-03-26T13:26:24Z,1

I just wanted to let you know that I started this series in light of finding some peace and centering during this tough time and so far it&#39;s been so helpful. In New York City we are not able to leave our apartments very often, having this time each day to connect within, move my body, and breath consciously has been essential to keeping me sane.

I&#39;m just posting this so that I can keep up with my impressions and luckly, in a couple of months from now, I&#39;ll be able to do all of the plank poses without lowering the knees or trembling.<br />Keep practicing, everyone.

"Damn, those boat crunches were brutal, especially the side bend ones!

I though I had a pretty strong core since I&#39;ve been weight lifting for about 4 or 5 months and been doing yoga (with you!) for over a year now, but there&#39;s always something to make you feel like a newbie hahaha<br /><br /><br />Since I&#39;m stuck at home now and our gym is closed down in my building, I&#39;m happy that I didn&#39;t do this when it came out because I&#39;ve been doing them once a day now to keep me sane and unkinked hahaha",Brandon Golway,2020-03-22T20:33:22Z,0

"Had to stop because I don&#39;t understand how to use the variations for those of us needing to have our hands on the floor behind us or holding hands under the knees during the boat series.

I was in a point where I couldn&#39;t go to gym or do any very intense exercises, so I decided to give a better try for yoga. And I have realised there is so much more to it than I had so far experienced. I feel how I am getting better and stronger every day and how I can be 1% better in certain poses every time. It&#39;s amazing! Makes me feel like I am accomblishing those little things every morning and at the same time getting stronger and more mindful. Please keep doing what you&#39;re doing!

"I just want to share my thoughts about yoga. I used to do home work out (exercise) for the past months and I felt great but I have decided to try yoga because I&#39;ve read a lot of great things about it and well, I was easily convinced to try it! Working out keeps me alive, alert, awake, and enthusiastic all through the day but gradually, it started to drain me. Letting myself sleep is very hard. There were times when I can&#39;t sleep and then it is already 6 am and I haven&#39;t slept (probably because I&#39;m still alive, alert, awake, and enthusiastic). Waking up too is very hard &#39;cos I feel so tired and drained after working out the day before. And so, I&#39;ve decided to switch to yoga. I initially decided to give it a week to see what it does to me, but now I have decided to do it as long as I can. Sleeping, now, is as easy as 123. I close my eyes for a minute and <b>boom</b> I&#39;m asleep. In the morning, if my phone starts to alarm me to wake up, I don&#39;t press the snooze button and go back to sleep, instead I wake up, get out from my bed, and feed our dogs. Also, I feel more relaxed and free (?). My breathing is very smooth and my body is now more flexible. Discovering this Youtube channel is definitely a blessing and I thank you Ms. Adriene for doing this. Keep doing what you do best and I hope you live a very good life! (And to you too, Benjie!) 💚",june kirslie,2020-03-11T03:20:57Z,1

"The very first time I did yoga on my own, over ten years ago, I did some hip opening exercises and I remember feeling this intense rage inside of me and I started crying in frustration. According to my internet search back then, most people carry their emotions in their hips. So when they do deep hip openers, all of their emotions come flooding to the surface. Since then, I can now do most hip openers without having an outburst of emotion. However, THIS practice made me rage again. Anyone else ever have that experience?",Sam R,2020-03-07T06:49:40Z,0
"Adriene ngl as we were doing planks and swaying side to side and then front to back and you said we could add hip dips I verbally said no way bc just swaying was a lot for me. But then we (finally) went to downward dog and it was the easiest transition I’ve had yet. It felt fluid and /right in a way that I haven’t felt before.

And I am proud of myself. Tbh I’ve been avoiding this day 6 for the past few days because I knew it was going to be intense and I sure wasn’t expecting the second round of boats!

"Started my 30 days late, but I&#39;m determined to finish. I want to say that Adriene&#39;s yoga practice is the first time I&#39;ve enjoyed physical activity since I was a child. Having grown up asthmatic, been shamed about my body by peers and trainers and developed disordered eating I&#39;ve only ever associated  exercise with pain. The different combinations, and the Find What Feels Good philosophy have taught me that my body isn&#39;t wrong, and I&#39;m not a failure.

"I came outside to do this video, as I have been doing for the last few days, and about 5 minutes in, the landscapers next door started working with the leaf blower that was SO LOUD I could not hear any of the audio from the video.  I decided to keep going anyway and then as soon as the practice ended, the landscapers left lol.  It&#39;s dead quiet here now.  And as I read the comments, and the caption for this video, I realize there was a lot of commentary around self love in this video and I&#39;m wondering why, particularly, this is the one I was distracted from hearing.  Makes me laugh!  I do a lot of self love practice and if this session were easier, I would do it again so that I could hear the commentary but no way in heaven am I doing that.  Instead, I choose to trust and love what is!  There is so much unknown in this life and trying to figure it out can wear me down.  Trust and surrender, trust and surrender.

Throughout December and early January, I was having a lot of gut and digestion issues, and my insurance wouldn&#39;t cover getting it figured out. I&#39;m doing my best to take the issue into my own hands and get healthier, and this practice has already helped so much with that. I&#39;ve realized how much tension I regularly hold in my belly, and my belly has felt SO GOOD after each of these practices.

I started crying when Adriene talked about how things are often not easy off the mat, and I felt this surge to be kind to myself and recognise the bravery of myself and everyone who finished this video, regardless if our boats looked more like makeshift life rafts, or if our planks were just extended lie-down sessions.",shina chua,2020-01-30T20:25:09Z,1

"Core has always been my weakness. Even when I was a teenager and was doing ballet, I knew that my core wasn&#39;t strong enough. Was this practice challenging? Yes. Was is insanely hard and impossible to do? Absolutely not. I started with the &quot;soften&quot; mentality, accepted where I&#39;m at and worked with it. Do I need to try a more difficult variation of the pose when the exercise itself was challenging enough? No, so I didn&#39;t. I need to stop a few seconds to rest in the middle of a sequence? Yes, so I stopped. I continued with this mentality (and with my breath, of course) and ended the practice feeling plenty satisfied. What a wonderful journey is this becoming. Namaste 🙏.",Kristina D'Antonio,2020-01-29T11:13:35Z,1

This is the first session in a long time, where I could feel all of my muscles engaging and becoming stronger.  It&#39;s a small victory, but it&#39;s still my victory.

"Never have I been more thankful for a downward dog. I always used to dislike downward dog so much, because it&#39;s not a &quot;challenging&quot; pose but all the blood rushes to my head and I don&#39;t usually like that feeling. Then I remember what @yogawithadriene always says about how what happens on and off the mat interconnect. And I finally realise why I don&#39;t like downward dog, it&#39;s because I&#39;m not used to the &quot;in between&quot; stage of things. I like the heavy lifting like planks etc. And the &quot;easy&quot; stuff like child&#39;s pose. I like the all or none stuff, but most of life actually lies in the in between stages. It&#39;s not always about the highly charged moments. It&#39;s the in between, every day moments that make up life. And that&#39;s what yoga has taught me today.

"I struggled with this one but at the same time I managed to hold my planks for more than 10 seconds, which is a big deal to me.

"I&#39;m frustrated. I almost exclusively use your yoga videos and I like them a lot. However there are a few things with this new series that stand out to me so far.  -In prior videos you usually count down normally, now you seem to be putting extra long pauses or conversation inserted into your counting. I&#39;m not ready for a six count when you start at three.  -There are extended meditation/laying down at the start, then very little warm up or stretching and then quite strenuous stuff like all core for the remainder. That doesn&#39;t work for me.  I&#39;m frustrated since I&#39;ve come to expect to be able to complete your videos and today I couldn&#39;t. Maybe it&#39;s simply a matter of unreasonable expectation.  It does feel like a departure from the norm.",Ferdinandsits,2020-01-21T23:18:04Z,0

"I cried during and after this session, felt so confronted with the state of my body. After twin pregnancy - this is the first thing I did to get in shape a little more, but day 6 made me feel very vulnerable and insecure. I felt fat, stupid and cried a lot because I couldn&#39;t do the boat poses. <br />Even Adriene&#39;s sweet guiding voice didn&#39;t help. Reading the comments here, did. Seeing how I am not alone and how more people struggled with this and cried, made me feel a little better and made me see how I should indeed be proud of what I COULD do instead of being mad about what I couldn&#39;t. <br />The strength of this community: pick each other up when you fall.

"Oh my gosh - how far postpartum are you? This was a REALLY intense ab workout and you should not be surprised at ALL that it was difficult! Your sweet belly has been through so much and needs teeny, tiny baby steps to begin to shift back to normal. This legitimately might be too much for you! (I realize your post was three months ago now, so maybe you made it through just fine!) But diastasis rectii is a common problem, your core could be separated, and needs special gentle care to be repaired and restrengthened after pregnancy.",ellebow,2020-04-20T16:44:40Z,0
I didn&#39;t realise that I don&#39;t have any core strength at all! Or that anyone could ever do what Adriene did.  I couldn&#39;t do even one of those boat pose lifts.  Not even with one leg at a time.  Or maybe I just have ultra heavy legs ;).

I love Adriene’s sassy yogi vibe, my benefits and the opportunity to connect on a deeper level to the hum of this global audience. It makes my overall attitude towards the world, other people and myself so much better after I meet you on the mat! And I’m so much more aware of my intentions and physicality all day. <br /><br />Thank you for this gift of reconnection, for being the conduit for betterness.

Is anyone else experiencing a lot of pain in the wrists. That seems to be the only thing really slowing me down during these days,Taylor Deike,2020-01-17T01:41:49Z,19
@MunkeeMazik That sounds like a hack :) Not sure if I can follow the instructions. Why turn the broom? To shift the weight?,Elise G.,2020-04-19T20:57:20Z,0
"Yes, yoga is quite intense on the wrist. Try to press with your fingers on the mat, that helps. Also if it hurts, take a break, don&#39;t push it. Planks can be done over forearms with very similar results. Take it easy, gets stronger, try harder.",Fernando Hidalgo,2020-04-18T18:24:23Z,2
"I have problems with weak wrists too. One easy wrist exercise that I found has helped a lot: grab a broom, hold it horizontally in front of you, palms down, and spin it forwards in your hands for 1 minute, then backwards for 1 minute. Then turn the broom over so the bristles are at the other end, and do it all again. If you feel a burn in your forearms then you&#39;re doing it right! It&#39;s just 4 mins, maybe 2-3 times a week, but it really helps with these poses :)",MunkeeMazik,2020-04-18T16:47:44Z,0

This may be a bit late but what has helped me in downward dog (this is where my wrist hurt the most) is to place my hands closer to my feet as much as I need until the pain subsides. It is not a perfect pose but everyday I can be a bit better. Hope this helps.,Mariana Jimenez Gomez,2020-04-12T18:07:18Z,2

"Today was a tough one. I just felt exausted from everything but still decided to do today&#39;s session. And well, you kicked my abs. The plank pose was harder than any other day to me and those boat poses nearly made me give up. Yet, I was surprised by my stubborness to keep going and I&#39;m glad I did. I succeeded to indentify that I was trying too hard on my neck and my shoulders, like I was carrying all the world&#39;s weight on them, especially when I&#39;m forgetting (yep, it seems possible) to breathe. I&#39;m looking forward to start correcting this bad posture tomorrow. Thank you Adriene !",Syrine Metzger,2020-01-16T20:49:56Z,0

"Oh boy...today was...hard. I&#39;ve never really experienced yoga the way I did today. I utilize it to stay flexible and for strength and that was about it. However, with Day 6, I finally had a break through. I actually started crying halfway through the boats, and I felt so defeated. I don&#39;t have a flat tummy and I&#39;m not able to reach my hands around my thighs, and even when I was doing the modified version, it was hard. And I thought about giving up, but then I pulled myself together and finished the last few boats. And then, this wonderful instructor, said that this wasn&#39;t easy, just like things off the mat aren&#39;t easy, and then she said that I killed it, even if I struggled. And Adriene, you&#39;ll never know how much that meant to me. Being kinder and more loving to myself is something I struggle with, even though I&#39;ve been working on my journey for a while, but I think with todays class, I realize that I should do a better job. <br />Lovely class, much love, thank you for my Day 6, Namaste.",Alexis Rodriguez,2020-01-15T02:19:08Z,0

"Catching up this week. I ended up taking off for a bit because I was feeling super run down and just slept as much as I could lol. Feeling better now. Did anyone else kinda cry when they were doing boat pose? I had a moment of “ I can’t do this, my hips and tail bone hurt I’m disappointed in my lack of fitness and ability” as soon as Adrienne said “ three left you can do this maybe if you took a break come back in” and honestly I just went for it. And I’m glad I did. ❤️",angela bleibtrey,2020-01-14T02:15:10Z,0

I&#39;ve been following Adrienne for around 3 years now but have been bad at keeping up with actually doing sessions regularly and exercising but I&#39;d try. This year I am determined to get fit and healthy and keep it up.<br><br>This video is the first time I have ever paused a video and cried because I greatly struggled to complete an exercise. I can usually work through my difficulties but the boat poses were a particular struggle and for the first time I really felt like something was too much for me to complete. <br><br>I did keep going and trying and I know it will get easier with time the more I do and I am determined to keep going but this is the first time I have responded so emotionally to practice and I am a little overwhelmed.,Danielle Ramsey,2020-01-13T12:10:12Z,15

"First video of the journey that&#39;s ended in tears for me!! I suffered with an eating disorder for many years, last year I managed to get focussed on changing my relationship with food and exercise, doing this video I really realised how far I&#39;ve come, felt insane and so so good to be working out my abs from a place of love, attention and respect for my body rather than punishment and guilt, thank you Adriene for this amazing journey, reconnecting with self love and making me feel damn proud of myself!",Maddy Chapman,2020-01-13T09:42:00Z,0

"Modified and softened the core work a lot due to lower back twinges since starting this practice, which is why I&#39;m still on day 6  on the 13th Jan but I am delighted to still be here, in to not judge myself for how I am doing this journey. Also to not have given up as my back said.... OH. Of course it&#39;s opening up and this time I am mouch more aware of the subtle adjustements you are giving us around ribs and feet etc to be able to have the support within myself to not take it all on the neck and back and shoulders (as I have done in life too).

"Maybe someone can advise me on this. I don&#39;t mind the core exercises - what I have troubel with is when I use my neck and shoulder (as well as core) in the exercises. Afterwards I feel a lot of tension in upper back/shoulders and neck. Also can&#39;t really find a modification that works. To me, this should only be a  core workout not a tension builder. <br>Thanks for the help.",McIntoEnglish,2020-01-13T07:58:37Z,0

Thank you",Halee Harrison,2020-01-13T02:49:16Z,0
Its amazing how focusing on breath makes everything easier. I started this yoga journey a few days after everyone. When I saw people posting about day 6 I was worried about continuing and almost didn&#39;t practice today. But I made the commitment and I focused on my breath. While it wasn&#39;t easy it also wasn&#39;t excruciating and I ended up think &quot;oh that was it? I can do that&quot;. Thank you Adriene for helping me to remember I am stronger than I think!,Elizabeth Kitchin,2020-01-13T01:52:20Z,8
That &quot;inhale to drop down exhale to lift&quot; section was some of the most challenging core work I&#39;ve done in some time. I gotta lot of work to do on that little piece of practice. <br><br>&quot;Do you trust me&quot; was perfectly timed and hilarious!,Crash Blakmor,2020-01-12T23:07:32Z,1
I have never cried during a practice before but this one brought me to tears. I think this was the first time that I accepted and had compassion for where my body is now and felt so much gratitude for where my body is going. Saying &quot; I am strong!&quot; felt so good.

"These comments of everyone else who cried and struggled are such a healing to me right now.<br><br>Went into today knowing I would probably struggle. It was hard last year, and I&#39;ve gained weight since then. I cried during day 4, really struggling with the idea that there should be ease when it was so hard. Thought today would be easier mentally since it is hard by design.<br>And in some ways it was. Til the up and down boats which my larger body just couldn&#39;t do. Tried to modify but it got overwhelming the feeling of failure again. Was crying at the end.<br><br>And my fiance had watched me crying at the end, and was crying too. He held me and told me how proud he was and how strong I am. How I&#39;m his brave and beautiful girl. <br><br>That support and the support in this comment section is what is going to bring me back to the mat tomorrow. I will get there. We all will. We are strong. We are capable.",Kelly McKenzie,2020-01-12T14:43:06Z,350

"I have lost too much weight due to cancer... And my body was more a sailboat than a boat. I had no weight on me to keep me grounded, I kept toppling to irrelevant places and burst out crying each time I tried it. This day was the most difficult one on me mentally &amp; bodily so far... I thought I was too weak, incapable, how everyone was doing these exercises and I was failing. I do feel slightly better now... thank you for sharing your struggle.",Zerinda Ella,2020-02-22T17:09:50Z,4

"Phew, I&#39;ve been doing YWA for 3 years and that was one of the hardest. Some bits I just couldn&#39;t do without swinging legs right back to get momentum to come up again. However the most important thing I&#39;ve learnt from her is to accept the things you can&#39;t do, all of us being different. I&#39;ll never be brilliant at yoga as I started in my late 60s, but I am fitter and more flexible and most important important to me, I take life more lightly, am more tolerant of myself and others, and feel more hopeful, even in these difficult times.

"I am doing Day 6 on January 11th because I have fallen behind. I don&#39;t know yet if I am going to push myself to get caught up or if I am just going to try to keep doing a video a day and just, well, be a bit behind. This one was SO DIFFICULT for me. Every time I tried to extend out my torso &amp; legs low to the floor then pull myself back up with my core muscles I couldn&#39;t &amp; I had to use a hand to help myself get back into the curled upright position. So I cut myself a little slack &amp; just held the boat pose I&#39;m familiar with (but that still gets difficult after a long enough hold) for as long as my core muscles could hold it. My legs were shaking. It was life. I love the reminder in (I think) almost every video in this series so far that we are always home because home is our bodies. I need that. I feel kinda bad that I couldn&#39;t do the main/longest sequence in the video (the one I mentioned not being able to do earlier) but, at the same time, my cobra has gotten a lot higher, easier &amp; more graceful - so there is something to be proud of.

"Hi Adriene! Greetings from Moscow, Russia. I really love your 30-day yoga trip, and all the previous videos too:)  I&#39;m all in and with you on this. I have a question for you regarding this day-6 practice. As a mom of three I am familiar with diastasis recti. In fact, I hear it happens to almost every mom. Also most moms are unfamiliar with the fact they have it and attribute their postpartum bellies to body fat or some sort of &quot;body transformation&quot;. Its severity can differ from person to person. As I heard, doing frontal planks and frontal crunches can really worsen the condition.  Could you please comment on that, and maybe address the issue in your future videos. I would really think it&#39;s important to remind women with kids of it all the time, because it cannot be overemphasised:) I believe. And isn&#39;t it the majority of your subscribers? Thanks! Nadya",Nadya Mertsalova,2020-01-11T15:15:24Z,0

"I had a really hard time with this one, I even started crying. It&#39;s the first time I actually had to pause the video because I just couldn&#39;t do the pose. I started to struggle with the plank going up and down but the boat pose killed me. I stopped the video and cried for 10 minutes because I was so disappointed I couldn&#39;t do it. I then calmed myself down and started over. I struggled and it was very hard but I did it. Not perfectly but I did it. It felt so empowering at the end and I&#39;m actually really proud of myself. In today&#39;s yoga session I learned a lot about myself. It was hard because when I woke up I stepped on the scale en saw that I had lost a kilogram which I was very proud of but then this session made me realize that I&#39;m not one with my body.

"Hi Dawn! In general, most women are able to continue a regular practice through month eight if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. As always, consult your doctor/physician before starting and follow their advice. xx",Yoga With Adriene,2020-01-11T16:31:56Z,0

Today was definitely the most difficult one for me and was the most frustrating one for me. Between my butt bones and lower back the boat pose up and down over and over and over... Definitely was not comfortable whatsoever. And the positioning following boat pose was not restful/comfortable for me either. Not only because of the butt bones but because of the big belly that I have that doesn&#39;t allow me to be in that position and be comfortable and breathe during it.,Bambi Dean,2020-01-10T21:29:41Z,0

"“There are so many things that we encounter off the mat that are not easy”<br />This morning, just before I began my practice, I damaged my car by misjudging a sharp turn into a driveway lined with tall pavers. I surprised myself by how calmly I dealt with the situation, realizing that what was done, was done and could not be changed. I was able to breathe into the situation, make the arrangements that were needed, and go onward with my day. Then I came to practice to find it a challenging routine and was able to breathe through this, as well. I feel as if the Universe has decided to present me with challenges today to show me how strong and capable I am. With gratitude💜",Wild Elevator Boy,2020-01-10T15:57:13Z,64

"So.. I was recently diagnosed with osteoarthritis in my hips - the left one in particular has been flared up badly since I moved homes end of September. I&#39;m an athlete - an avid mountain biker and outdoor enthusiast - and a self-employed single mother of two. I am only 46 and I am having difficulty putting my socks on in the morning, am waking up in the night and early morning with my left side in spasm. I have had chronic back/hip/knee pain all my life, but have always found a way to stay active. My physio once told me that I am an athlete stuck in a princess&#39;s body. Well, my body has taught me that there are parts of me that are quite broken/crippled, but other parts of me that are super rad and badass. I like to spend as much time feeling badass as possible, of course. But this yoga practice has been a way for me to embrace the broken parts of myself and meet myself where I am at. My intention for this practice is to love myself exactly as I am, even when I have to modify or opt out of a pose because it moves me into pain. Five days in, I noticed a reduction in my pain and increase in mobility/flexibility that has helped me be more comfortable throughout my day and especially in the evening when I tend to get quite sore again and my entire left leg from my lower back/glutes all the way down to my ankle have been going into spasm. This practice is helping. Often, but not always, a certain pose releases tears and I feel myself being cleansed of pain, letting go of whatever crap my body has been holding onto. I have never committed to yoga as a daily practice before. Too slow, quiet, gentle for me, perhaps? Not anymore. Love to everyone who has found the courage to meet themselves on the mat every day, no matter what, and huge gratitude to you, Adriene, for creating this beautiful space and guiding our practice.  xo",banffcb,2020-01-09T06:48:51Z,0

At one point I started crying out of such frustration. That&#39;s where I needed to be strong for myself and look at what I was experiencing.

"Almost cried too many times today. I honestly have had so many injuries in my body over the last year (back pain. RSI, knee spain, strained muscle in my foot) and I was scared to do this 30 days. I knew deep down that it would be a good thing but I was scared I would push myself too far in frustration with how my body has been failing me and make an injury worse, but this whole thing is making me stronger, wiser and more respectful of my body (in waves, but no one is perfect. I&#39;m improving). <br /><br />I know that I failed my body by not listening to it over the past little while and thats why it has been getting injured. Whilst days like this make the muscles hurt where I have been injured in the past, I know they are just getting stronger and maybe, just maybe, they wont hurt like they have before if I keep pushing thorugh. Today was the hardest for my back and hip creases, because my core is so weak, but I did it. I almsot cried trying to get through it, but I did and then cried with my little affirmation at the end from Adriene. This is hard but my muscles are stronger and looser than at the beginning, my foot strain (currently in recovery) has been getting a bit overworked, but the overall benefit is helping so much with fixing everything as a while. <br /><br />I still feel angry with myself for not being able to do better, but mentally im getting much better at pushing thorugh that. What a journey this has been so far. I wish I wasn&#39;t doing it so late in the evening though.

I managed to push through the struggle and the pain and come out on the other side. I couldn&#39;t believe I actually did it!! I also discovered the places where I was working harder than I needed to, and I realized that it is okay to be at whatever level you are at in the practice.

"I found the series of rocking planks seriously tough on my wrists so I had to stop for a bit, and then I found it incredibly difficult to get back into sync with the whole thing. Looks like I&#39;m going to have to give this one another go on the weekend.",kris cote,2020-01-08T03:48:21Z,0

"Got hit by period cramps right before starting this practice. I thought I&#39;d have to bow out and go to one the tried and true PMS practices, but this felt great. Had to pause once right before boat pose, but powered through the rest. I wouldn&#39;t recommend it everyday during a period because it is core-heavy and it won&#39;t always feel great, but if you want or need something more intense 10/10 would recommend.",Kaytlyn Porter,2020-01-08T03:43:19Z,0

I broke my tailbone about 10 years ago and I’ve always struggled with boat pose. I can only do a few of them then it starts to get uncomfortable.

As I was doing the boat pose and when I had to go back up I had to lean on my left side and push up to get into boat pose.

"This practice felt very at odds with Days 1-5 to me, a student who is new to your teaching. Previous days had felt very geared towards beginners - this practice was NOT appropriate for a beginning practitioner, and I don&#39;t feel sufficient modifications were suggested for the less experienced. This felt like I was watching Adriene show off. While I&#39;m happy you have a strong Pilates practice, I am baffled by this one. <br />I also cannot seem to find stated anywhere who you trained with? From some of your cues, you seem to have an Anusara background, but I don&#39;t see who you trained under or what school you have worked with. I&#39;m interested to know which branch of teaching recommends this kind of navasana variation, given the extreme strain it places on the lower back, and the lack of counterbalancing poses incorporated into the rest of the routine.",Alexis M,2020-01-08T02:12:33Z,0

"Just want to send love and support to those out there feeling discouraged by this INSANITY: while I respect Adriene, this is Pilates, not yoga. So if you felt thrown off, or perhaps drowning in the deep end, its ok ! Ive been practicing yoga for nearly 15 years and was not at all prepared for NOR SUCCESSFUL with this AHEM dynamic boat pose variation. A variation I might suggest is using a band and perhaps lowering JUST the legs or JUST the torso rather than both simultaneously, or if lowering both the head and the legs lower the legs to a chair, coffee table or cushion rather than the floor.",Alexis M,2020-01-08T02:00:36Z,0

I started yoga this summer after watching Adriene’s videos. Instead of my usual blues of the hot weather I was occupied and felt refreshed every morning. I’m usually stuck at home to watch my little brother and I’m notorious for not doing sports and being a weakling. Not only did I make a commitment to wake up at nine and do yoga but I finally got out of bed and started a healthy routine. After summer ended I stopped for a while to get adjusted to school again but I’m finally back and gaining purpose. Thank you for all you do.

I often have neck issues  where I basically move the wrong way and throw it out, so I am always nervous whenever there are &quot;crunch type&quot; exercises, because I&#39;ve hurt myself that way before.  I really liked the option of doing the boat pose and the boat &quot;up and downs&quot; with my hands supporting me behind.

I need to work on core strength more than anything, but with a herniated disk injury and sciatica, it&#39;s also what I&#39;m scared of the most, catch-22. So when we were lowering in and out of boat pose, I just lowered one leg at a time and alternated sides with each breath. I know it was a lot easier than lowering both legs at a time (which my body just absolutely wouldn&#39;t allow me to do), but I&#39;m glad I did SOMETHING.

"Day 6 done and I&#39;m both happy and slightly annoyed. I completed the video but I also just could not do all the boat poses and often either just tried to hold boat poses or just collapsed when I tried to do another one as my abs went no please no more. So I&#39;m taking 2 things away from today - 1. I&#39;ll have to come back to day 6 once I finish the 30 days to try the boat poses again to see the improvement steady and consistent work and effort will make (I was boating as much as my weak abs could take so I&#39;d say I got about 40% of what Adriene&#39;s abs got from this workout, which is great for getting back into yoga and exercise but still annoying in a self critical sense, even though I have come so far to be able to do that much) <br />But point 2.

I normally do my practice at 4:30am. This morning I didn’t sleep well so I changed to this afternoon.  After reading the letter from Adrian and seeming the boat pose<br />I knew I was in trouble.  I’m not that advanced but once I started I was not going to let Day 6 make me give up.  So I modified the boat so I could get in it.  Then she said do you trust me and ignite the core well I wanted to put the fire out but I kept going.  Thanks Adrian I felt so challenged the you said if I could make it through day 5 I would make it through the rest.  😊 I’m trusting myself and trusting the process.

It&#39;s like she took a searchlight and shone it at my midsection and after two or three reps of whatever that impossible one was everything between my shoulders and my hips vanished. Like I literally couldn&#39;t engage my stomach muscles after a few reps. I&#39;m weak.<br /><br />Doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll always be weak but I couldn&#39;t dig deep to power through the rest of the reps and keep pace with her. I couldn&#39;t find or engage my muscles and ended up being totally inert. I don&#39;t even know if I&#39;ll feel this tomorrow since I barely was able to engage anything.<br /><br />First certifiably failed practice of the season for me.

"I went into this practice kind of dreading it but through pushing myself I was surprised at what came up. For the first time in a long time I got emotional during  a yoga practice. I used to hold a lot of shame for crying, especially if I didnt know why I was upset in the first place but in this moment I sat with myself and stayed present with what I was feeling. I was fearful going into this practice but I was very humbled by the fact that I had to let myself take a break to honor the emotions flowing through me. Before this practice I was singing to relieve stress and I feel that it opened my heart up to the lesson this practice gave: it is okay to need a break, to not be perfect and I am safe in honoring myself. Believe it or not the Titanic reference helped me a lot because being asked if I trust was just what I needed in order to embody grace. I thought about giving up in the middle of this practice. I thought about getting down on myself for having emotions out of habit and that fact that I didnt is truly evidence of my tremendous growth. I am proud of myself for honoring these organic emotions. Your supportive energy and the collective energy is a fantastic motivator. Thank you 🙏🤯",Connor,2020-01-07T23:54:08Z,0

Also, first time I felt the tilt of my pelvis engage the power of my center before we even started - getting much more connected to this area of my body and accepting my core/belly for what it is (starting to finally embrace and love it).  I am strong and my belly is on fire!  Thank you for several years of practice and today.",Kimberly Atwood,2020-01-07T23:44:42Z,0

"I felt miserable day 6. I felt like everything was going too fast,  I couldn&#39;t do it right,  and just wanted to cry in shame and anger at myself for not being able to do it well. I&#39;ve been reading a book by Sarahjoy Marsh regarding yoga. One of the ideas is that yoga can help us become comfortable with being uncomfortable.  I realized that this was my chance to do just that.  Discomfort is part of life. I realized that I blame myself for feeling discomfort.  I tell myself that,  if I wasn&#39;t so weak,  I wouldn&#39;t feel uncomfortable.  None of these things are true.  When this realization hit me,  I was able to plow through,  reminding myself that I am getting through this,  I am surviving this.  I even paused the workout to badly execute a few more. They weren&#39;t great,  but they were mine. I still feel sad, but I feel like I know me better and I can improve how I treat myself when life gets rough.",Sarah McLin,2020-01-07T23:14:54Z,1

Today was a long day. I had to leave at 7 am for work and then went straight to a 3 hour dance practice. I came home at 11 pm. <br />And then I still did this.Even though I have to admit that the third set of planks with the moving to the front and back was on my knees and my tempo in the boat lowering and then especially getting to a seated position again was a lot slower. But I&#39;m glad to read in the comments that more people modified bits of this practice and I&#39;m proud that I showed up anyway.<br /><br />But now I&#39;m gonna drink a cup of tea and then take a shower and go to bed and hope that my abs won&#39;t hurt too much when I wake up tomorrow. Goodnight!,Diane _Princess,2020-01-07T22:43:20Z,0

I was so nervous going into this because (as this is my 3rd year doing this) ab day is my LEAST favorite by far and always leaves me feeling discouraged. But today I prepped myself and gave myself permission to modify where I needed and be honest about when I need modifications and when I need to push. And honestly- it was SO much better than I had expected. Mindset and forgiving yourself and being gentle with yourself in hard times makes a word of difference. Namaste and my heart is with everyone that had a rough practice today because I know I&#39;ve been there. You&#39;re awesome!,nicole rauner,2020-01-07T22:40:01Z,0

"My own brain was making fun of me toward the end of this. Initially, I had a beautiful boat, but within minutes I looked like the catch of the day flopping on the deck. At that point the song “Chicken on a Raft” started looping in my head and I realized I was no longer doing yoga. Thank goodness I’ve learned so much from Adriene already! I stopped the crazed mermaid out of water moves, found my breath and softened. Then I humbled myself, modified to suit my current level of fitness, and finished out the practice.

"Happy Day 6 everybody! After doing the Dedicate journey for myself in October, I&#39;m so glad I can join everyone here. And boy did I need this practice today! I&#39;ll be honest...core work is my nemesis (I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone) and after the past two days, I had doubts about how much energy I could put into today&#39;s practice ESPECIALLY since it focused on core. Yesterday I was in the DMV for SEVEN (7) HOURS! Wish that was an exaggeration. And today I had to open my shop and figure out a new register system that turned up plenty of issues needing to be resolved. And then there&#39;s the after-work housekeeping (bills, pet care, errand, dinner, and literal housekeeping lol). I&#39;ve felt mentally spent but now, though still pretty exhausted, I feel re energized and just invigorated in my soul. I showed up with all of you, pushed myself to keep my hands out because I knew I could do it, allowed myself a break with as much compassion I would give my best friends, loved and celebrated my body for all it&#39;s strength (underneath whatever fabulous curves I&#39;ve been blessed with haha!). I hope you all are having a wonderful week, and if it&#39;s not gone entirely to plan like mine, I hope you find resolve and a moment to get perspective back. Embrace your power, friends!

I got through it pretty well until the boats. Not so much because of the ab workout more so because it really hurt my tailbone. So I substituted most of those with more planks and other poses. Maybe I can find a way to pad my tailbone so I can do them without it hurting?

That boat pose dance was very difficult today!! I like Adrienne&#39;s style because I feel like it&#39;s not a failure it&#39;s more of a starting point to keep going from 💖,Sarah Wagner,2020-01-07T21:26:03Z,0
"Shakey with this, my core, my inner strength is my weakness, I love the metaphor of my body dealing with the struggle is the same as my emotional stability.

Since I started this Home journey, it is the first time that I&#39;ve had so much difficulty doing a movement and couldn&#39;t finish it (the boat movement).

"Passing day 6 feels like such a milestone every year. And I think for the first time, this year I felt ready for it. I might have cursed at the screen once or twice during the boat poses (sorry Adriene, nothing personal), but overall I feel really proud of myself! January is not my favourite month of the year, but this journey always makes it 100 times better. And with the theme of this year, after moving to a different country at the end of summer last year and traveling a lot since, I am finally actually starting to come home to my new city this month.",Eline Castelijns,2020-01-07T21:15:00Z,0
"I&#39;m hoping this sharing will be encouraging to some.  This is my 4th 30-days with Adriene, and the first where I have felt at ease with each practice.  Doesn&#39;t mean perfect; doesn&#39;t mean easy; but rather:  an ease; a knowing I would be able to &quot;do&quot; the practice in whatever way that meant for me.  Along the way, I had come to drop the struggle -- and my body and mind learned to truly partner with my breath..  And, today, that all meant that I was able to do this core practice fully with grace.  It does happen.<br /><br /><br />By the way, I will be 65 next month and in March 2018 I had a life-threatening accident.  Short story I was like Humpty Dumpty, except that my body did all come back together again.  With a combination of  PT and yoga (I only do Adriene&#39;s yoga practices), I went from debilitating pain in shoulders, hip, wrists, knees . . . (you get it) to being pain free a little more than a year later.  As I had a crash course on really listening to and being kind to my body as I rebuilt, I emerged both stronger and gentler.  I had to give up the pushing through and struggle because every time I didn&#39;t, my body spoke up with a vengeance.  <br /><br /><br />What worked for me was:  kindness, gentleness -- and commitment.  Love to each of you along your personal journey.",Deb,2020-01-07T21:13:20Z,0

"This is my third or fourth thirty day journey with Adriene and the first time I’ve got through day six without hating it. Even this time through the first round of boat was hard ... I modified and felt like giving up - for some reason round two it all came together and felt waaay easier. I’m stoked - and I want to say to others, keep going, keep showing up ! If I can get there you can too!",Viv Aitken,2020-01-07T20:57:45Z,0
"Usually I welcome the heat of an intense practice, especially with vinyasa - it makes me feel alive! But I found today&#39;s practice the hardest Day 6 yet. The repetitions made me feel stuck in a loop, in a way I found really difficult and frustrating, even though I powered through. It definitely stirred the pot and brought up some uncomfortable feelings. On the positive side, I have a new appreciation of the joy of flowing movement.

Hello!Day 6 was all about igniting the passion from softness that I learned in Day 5. I found that I had to lower on arms because my core is one of my weaker points. It always has been since 2 children and battling some tummy/eating issues.

"HELLO! a bit on day 5 and day 6 --<br />day 5 was sort of &quot;squeezed in&quot; between 2 things, and I was surprised by how active the practice was, compared to the theme...still, the theme of &quot;soften&quot; certainly served for day 6! phew! those side crunch-y things... DEAD. d-e-d, DEAD. I read another comment on here about the ego getting in the way today - yep, those silly little brain demons, saying that I should be doing better at &quot;keeping up,&quot; showed up (their presence especially insidious as I work off-the-mat to cultivate stronger self-belief!).<br />but I guess sometimes you show up, get humbled, and you receive a choice to &quot;soften&quot; into self-compassion. :) as well as transmute the pain into fire, and an invitation to connect with our life force! <br /><br /><br />one thing that Adriene said that resonated with me during this practice as we got into the cool-down: <br />&quot;some more love, a different kind of love&quot; <br /><br />as self-love and self-care become more dominant narratives/messages (yay!), I always appreciate the reminder that everything we do CAN be in service to that self-love practice, even if it feels painful in the moment, and that we can bring an intention of love into it all... for me, sometimes, there&#39;s a delicate balancing act between nurturing and indulgence, and before this, I was feeling some drudgery and resistance about the things I have to do today and could feel myself teetering back into old habits (&quot;well, I already went on a run and if I do yoga, then I can just like... relax, right?&quot;) but now I&#39;m ignited to go about my day, with love and softness :) thanks, Adriene, and namaste!",Grace Kim,2020-01-07T20:07:43Z,0

I did forget my breath here and there, but I managed to get it done.<br /><br /><br />Everyone who has made it this far, congratulations. You&#39;ve done an amazing job. I&#39;m proud of you.

"Hi Adrienne, I just want to share this...........I&#39;ve been doing your routines off and on for a little while and joined your 30 day HOME when it started. I&#39;ve been practicing with you daily for the last 3 weeks. I woke up this morning and it is remarkable how great my body feels. I simply love it. I had to idea I could feel like this. I also never knew one could feel so many different energies through yoga ie I could feel the difference in this workout as opposed to the one yesterday. A little thing that I think is special is the number of times I smile during the routine at your suggestions. That is surely special. Your call to have fun is wonderful. I just want you to know how much I appreciate your routine and spending time with you. Love, respect to you and  Benji. He/she&#39;s so cute :). THANK YOU!!!!!!!",Kavir Mootoo,2020-01-07T19:43:40Z,0

"Oh my GOD, that intro!!! You&#39;re too funny, thanks for all the laughs throughout that video! I felt so goshdamn amazing, grateful, accomplished, victorious at the end of the practice. See, I&#39;m a Pilates girl, so I&#39;m always conscious of my breathing, always thinking about it, always working on it. Our breathing truly is a great gift that we tend to neglect, I feel like. And I do know that it&#39;s a great part of yoga but today felt like a flow. There&#39;s no better word to describe it. My breathing transported me, anchored me, helped me. It made me feel like everything was perfectly flowing, like it was so easy. <br />I love working on my abs so I loved every second of that sweet, soft, boiling ignition &lt;3<br /><br />GUYS, I SWEAR, YOU CAN DO IT - if you try and let go of what&#39;s on your mind.

"@Jenny Kellerhals Thanks for sharing that. I had a back injury a few years back and never trust &quot;ab workouts&quot; :D My physiotherapyst did work with me on abs back then, but never did anything even remotely dangerous with me like lowering in boat pose. From what others are writing here being scared/feeling pain is not &quot;normal&quot; and only seems to be happening to previously injured people or the ones without much abs in the first place. But I definitely feel bad for not being able to keep up at all today :( I feel like the last five days have not given me enough strength and bravery for this.",MsGloaming,2020-01-09T20:38:20Z,1

I have been listening to this song over the last few days, take a listen, the lyrics are very poignant given the journey HOME we are all on. You all rock, we got this!!! 💕 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJv9f-sdjjI"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJv9f-sdjjI</a>",Gilly Spence,2020-01-07T17:39:04Z,0

Feeling under the weather today. The ethos and sentiment of this practice was not lost on me. The truth is that I struggled but I didn&#39;t give up. Modifications were made and most importantly I used the breath. Taking part and giving it your best shot is always valid.

"Hi friends 🙏 Don&#39;t allow yourself to become discouraged if it takes a while to ignite the fire. Maybe the fire within has been doused repeatedly by the negative opinions of others, dinmed by the draining energy of people in our lives--or maybe it just needs more care because it hasn&#39;t been tended to for so long. As Thich Nhat Hanh lovingly reminds us: we must close the windows before tending to the fire. The time on the mat is the time we take for ourselves to close the windows and tend to ourselves. Much love to you all, Namaste 🙏",Jay-Ram Rajendra,2020-01-07T16:56:52Z,0

"So good!!! (I really was stronger than I thought.) This practice really forced me to be present as I&#39;ve been struggling with a (admittedly slightly obsessive) focus on future outcome (which ironically includes being more present). Living for the future, planning, goal-setting, and being in that constant &#39;go&#39; frame of mind is a really hard habit to break but time and again, your practices help me spiral back to my center, my presence, my Home. I know that being present in our daily lives is its own incredible reward for this work, but I also know it is from this place of being that I will be able to grow, thrive, honor my intentions, and ultimately create the life I&#39;m striving for in the best way possible.

Right now, I’m in week 4 following foot reconstruction surgery (arthritis) and can have no weight bearing for total of 6 weeks.  3 months prior to surgery, my doctor suggested I work on upper body strength so that I could navigate the recovery with walker and knee scooter.

I usually struggle on day 6 with Adriene, but today&#39;s practice was impractical for those of us who are only 6 days in to any kind of fitness.

"I&#39;ve been doing yoga for 5 years now, and I&#39;m here on this channel since the True. I do joga more or less regulary (3-5 times a week), but I&#39;ve been struggling for the past few month due to my depression. I&#39;ve been really hurt and betrayed and in pain for quite a time, so for November and December I mostly avoided practises that could be hard -- these with vinyasas and planks, so I lost a lot of my strength. I&#39;m better now and I&#39;ve decided to commit to Home and daily meditation. Yet today was a really hard session for me. I took a lot of modifications -- something I didn&#39;t usually do earlier. I miss my strength, consistancy and peace of mind. I began to cry nearly at the half of the video and I didn&#39;t stop. It really hit me when Adriene said that I killed it, because I didn&#39;t do well as I had done before. I know I shouldn&#39;t be too hard on myself, but I&#39;m just sorry I&#39;m not that good anymore. I hope I&#39;ll get back there, back home in time. Thank you for your inner light and strength, your guidance was with me even in the hardest times for whole two years now, so it&#39;s the third one.

"My mid back did not appreciate this practice, but I did. And I got it to settle down when I tried the second set of boats with my hands under me.

"I&#39;ve been following Adriene for a couple years now but usually I seek out something in particular that I&#39;m feeling for the day and that is usually something more calming because I deal with anxiety and sometimes depression. So I thought I&#39;d give myself a push and actually stick with her 30 day this year and I was doing pretty good until today and it was tough. I am not good with core ANYTHING (LOL)...I have always struggled with my belly area physically and mentally since I was a kid ....so this kicked off some deep emotions, especially Adriene&#39;s words of wisdom at the end with the fetal pose. I came to the mat and she is there for me no matter how I do and gives praise no matter what your result is by the end.

Today I really connected at the end when you made “at home” comment. I have started at home yoga about 2 months ago and felt like I was cheating because I wasn’t going to a gym style class... (I don’t even leave close to one) I have even rearranged my living room to make my mat apart of the room..

This year, I chose &quot;get things done&quot; as my motto and I made myself get on the mat even tho I was scared. I felt blanketed in love when Adriene said not to be scared at the beginning. <br />Also, I found myself SMILING at the last boat exercise?!?! Guys, I think the yoga is working 🤣💙 much love to everyone who was scared too and to those who are thinking of skipping it: trust me, I am the biggest core exercise hater but this one was over quite fast!",Xenia Hoff,2020-01-07T15:07:10Z,1
"I struggled only in that I couldn&#39;t keep up with my form with the high boat and low boat. But I succeeded in that I continued to move and worked at my own pace, what worked for me, and what felt right. So YAY for me. I feel strong, so that&#39;s a good thing.

"I came back from a bike ride on a really cold day and did not feel great. Decided to get in my practice anyway. Wow! I love all that core stuff and my knees were so happy to have a day off low lunges! This is the first time I&#39;ve ever followed a program and I&#39;m so enjoying what is a commitment but where I can also abscond any responsibility completely to Adriene and simply trust enough to follow wherever she leads. It&#39;s like when I take my dogs into the forest and let them choose the route. All I have to do is follow and trust that they will find the best route for that particular day. They always do, of course. I used to spend ages scouring YouTube for yoga videos and would forward through them to see what they included and if I wanted to do them. Now I don&#39;t bother because I trust Adriene to have already figured it out. It&#39;s actually quite empowering. Gratitude Adriene :-)",Suz J,2020-01-07T14:47:26Z,1

I used to struggle through boot-camp-like exercise classes with instructors yelling at the class to do one more, do better, work harder, push push push! I thought they were best for me because that&#39;s what my inner voice always said too, but I secretly despised them (and suffered many injuries from overwork). This practice was HARD, but I was able to move with compassion for my body rather than unforgivingly pushing it beyond its limits. I feel warm, energized, and refreshed (and sore of course!). This is a completely different way to compassionately push myself, and a great complement to the radical self-compassion mindfulness I&#39;ve been practicing. What a great practice - thank you!",PhoenixPinion,2020-01-07T14:47:22Z,1

"Today’s practice made me frustrated but for the first time in a long time the frustration worked as a kick in the glutes instead of being a distraction. I wish I performed a little better but I am not experiencing any negative emotions - rather a slight nudging for me to keep showing up on the mat.

Yesterday I cried on the mat because I couldn’t hold a pose as long as you did, today I started laughing when I couldn’t get up after lowering down and it just made the practice so much more enjoyable.

I am so thankful for all the strength I have gained over the years. Shout out to my big brother!!

Can I do that and not have my shoulders up to my ears and my face scrunched, and why the heck were my legs shaking so much?  Reminding myself to ignite, breath and soften was my challenge today.

"As a 55 y/o avid hiker I found this quite challenging. I have not done true core work in a very long time. That said, it did not kill me I killed it. So very thankful for the hands behind the back on the mat modification offered during boat cycles. Without it I may have given up. I felt this not only in my core but in my upper thighs too. I am feeling stronger, more relaxed and confident every day. Thank you, Adriene. Namaste`",kristi shore,2020-01-07T13:08:11Z,0

"Today ended in tears for me, but good tears. I wasn&#39;t able to complete the second set of boat pose. However, instead of internally beating myself for &quot;failing&quot;, I just sat still, focused on my breath, and thought to myself of proud I was to have made it here to the mat, to day 6. Not only has this practice with Adriene started to change my physical strength, but my mental strength as well. Thank you for all you do Adriene! 💜",Ashley Loflin,2020-01-07T13:04:21Z,0
"Home is my favourite 30-day journey so far. I struggled so much with the side boat poses, but laughed my way through. Thank you Adriene for showing me that pushing myself can be fun instead of frustrating. ❤️",Roxanne Joncas,2020-01-07T13:04:11Z,0

That was tough but great! 😁<br />One of my main issues with my body is my upper thighs / groin area. When I have my legs out straight or bent in those boat poses there&#39;s so much pressure on that area that it gets very tight and starts to pull if I keep them off the ground for too long. Even just lying down and having my legs float above the floor is a lot of pressure in the groin that I struggle to hold it. Does anyone else have issues around that area?,shmal,2020-01-07T13:02:59Z,0
"Today I felt very sore in my abs so I had to take a few breaks. I feel like a failure for not being able to do it, I&#39;m not even new to yoga. But I know that it&#39;s not easy for everyone. Also, when I do yoga, my mind keeps on thinking about other things, like what I have to do today, is there a way to possibly stop those thoughts?",AllyCat,2020-01-07T13:02:49Z,0

"I was so nervous to start this video today. In the past, this kind of yoga would make me nauseated and swoony and feel awful. Ive been doing Adriene&#39;s videos almost daily since November and have felt myself getting stronger and my capacity increasing. Today I SLAYED this workout!! I kept waiting to feel too worn out to go on, but I kept going. It was TOTALLY hard. I got gross and sweaty. But I can&#39;t begin to describe the huge, tearful joy I felt at the end. I&#39;ve never felt strong in my whole life and for the first time, I feel strong and capable and I can do hard things. Damn. It&#39;s just so good.",elizasaurusrex2,2020-01-07T12:59:52Z,0

Thank you Adriene for the reminder to love our core...so important and so many of us struggle with loving our bellies. Its been a huge struggle of mine since I was young and teased about it. Im very grateful for this time to focus on our core and treat it with the love it deserves. &lt;3,Nikole Fischer,2020-01-07T12:58:43Z,0

"ngl i did A Lot of modifications here! i was trembling sm but it reminded me when i first started watching your videos and everytime it required core strength i had none so i used to put all the weight on my neck and shoulders and spend the day sore. now i might not be strong ~yet~ but at least i feel my abdomen burning, i know i won&#39;t be sore i&#39;ll prob just feel the warmth(tm) a little bit, so i welcome all the shaking cuz it&#39;s in the right place lol also it&#39;s the first day i practice in the morning and i feel so energized i think i&#39;ll change my routine! namaste &lt;3",Dayra Émile Guedes Martínez,2020-01-07T12:56:59Z,0

Way different from day 6 in past 30 day challenges lol. Not easy. My modifications to get through it was to slide my arms up and down the hams for the first set and rest my hands behind me on the mat for the rest. <br />I’m still here!,Modlocks,2020-01-07T12:54:50Z,0
"Well this was an interesting one haha. I improvised a LOT, but I still did everything! For the crunches, I exhaled with putting my feet down and touching my nose to my knees, one at a time. Might not have been perfect, but I showed up, got stronger and feel so much better now thanks to it.<br /> I never feel any stress or worry with your practices Adriene, cause I know that just showing up is enough, and breathing. So that’s what I aim for, although it always leads to more. Thank you so much. Looking forward to tomorrow!",robynloveschocolate,2020-01-07T12:54:45Z,0

I am just starting this (doing day 3 today) <br />and feel like I am bumbling through it. Many of the things in the middle are difficult for me to do (hip replacement last year and rotator cuff rebuild 3 years ago that just isn&#39;t what it used to be). Not to mention I am very overweight and have big boobs so many of the poses are uncomfortable as well.

When doing the low and high boats (hard!!!) I felt like when I went low I was really pressing into my lower spine bones in a painful way that made it hurt too much to continue. Any advice? Did anyone feel something similar?,Evan Weiss,2020-01-07T12:07:08Z,1
"Maybe it was just too much for your body to handle in this present moment. When I used to do similar exercises, it was painful for my lower back because I hadn&#39;t developed the muscle yet.    Now I&#39;m a lot stronger and don&#39;t have the pain that kind of pain anymore. Also your form could contribute to the pain too. If you are arching your back too much, that will cause it to hurt and it&#39;s not good for it. I hope this helps!",Tyana Mouser,2020-01-07T12:41:04Z,0

"Felt like a failure during this.. I stopped doing the high boat to low boat, because I got angry. I could have kept going, i wasn&#39;t really tired in my abs, but I didn&#39;t have any balance and I fell and I got soooo angry. Always hated ab workouts, because I never feel it in my abs, only in my hips, or neck, or whatever. And I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s because I&#39;m stronger than I think, or because I&#39;m just using all the wrong muscles, because I&#39;m super weak (probably the last one...). I&#39;ve been angry or irritated pretty most every single day so far, and I just can&#39;t figure out why. Every practice has had me in tears of frustration.

"Love “Benji’s paws smell like Fritos, is that a thing?” I was dying! However, I felt so disconnected and uncoordinated during the boat poses.

My lower back was tight in this pose too! The lowering and back up again...a challenge. But I did a thing I wouldn’t normally do for myself. I stopped and rested a beat and then joined back in!

I found I was not able to do a lot of this practice. I amunable to do cobra because of sciatica and found the boat practice very painful as well so was not able to do that. Ironic that we are supposed to feel self love but are not able to participate in the process. Disappointing because I look forward to my practice and feel today that I have missed out. I suppose this is part of my learning that I can not do some of the things I feel I should and I have to find a way to come to terms with this.,Susan Snelling,2020-01-07T11:33:38Z,0

Feeling that happy heat in my body! Made myself laugh a few times once when I fell out of boat pose. 😅 Reminds me of the power we each have. Also the being nice to our tummies resonated! I give mine too much grief. I will be nicer to it after today. ❤,Elizabeth Dickman,2020-01-07T10:22:39Z,5
Whoooo! Day 6! I always look forward to this practice. I also guessed hip dips would be involved from the swaying in plank during yesterday’s practice. It was fun nonetheless 😊 I always struggle with boat pose because my tailbone causes discomfort but I padded it out and didn’t go so low during the reps and was all good! Have a lovely day everyone ❤️ x,Jess Nolan,2020-01-07T10:22:27Z,0

Definitely a challenging day! <br />Does anyone else struggle with syncing their breath correctly? I find that my natural rhythm is always the opposite of what Adriene directs (ie I want to breathe out when going down in the boats and breathe in when we pull back up) and then I spend half the exercise just trying to sync up rather than focusing on the poses.

"Soooooooo I may have started sobbing through the second round of boat poses today. I have been told by lots of people in my life that i really mentally beat myself up if I don&#39;t or cant do something perfectly. It has always been an issue but it popped up again after my mum was diagnosed terminal 3 years ago, it is one of the things I worked very hard on with a counsellor after her diagnosis as I decided that I needed to get rid of some negative coping mechanisms to be able to support her and my family properly. I have felt it slipping in again recently over the last 6 months and during that practice I reaaaaaally felt myself starting to beat myself up during the first round of boats... &#39;why am I so bad at this&#39; &#39;I should be fitter than this&#39; I&#39;m rubbish, I can&#39;t finish these.&#39; I got angry with myself that I couldn&#39;t do it without extra ground support... BUT then Adriene Said&#39; change your mind about it&#39; and I remembered all the lovely support I&#39;ve had here, and something hit and I started sobbing... And I finished them all! Yes it wasn&#39;t super yogi, I&#39;m not super yogi... But I am here and doing it... Which should be enough so I&#39;m going to make it enough.<br />I wasn&#39;t expecting so much emotional stuff during this 30 days, oh my goodness it&#39;s intense!

I&#39;m ready for this!&quot; I was super excited for this practice, but a little intimidated as well cuz I didn&#39;t know what to expect and a tiny bit worried that I might struggle with the different exercises and moves, but it was all good.

"Last day i could actually do these practices in the morning (I&#39;m going back to school and they aren&#39;t uploaded by the time I&#39;d have to get up to be able to do them befor leaving i think) and it was a frustrating one.<br />My back and espacially lower back have always been an issue and i couldn&#39;t do the first set of boat crunches for the life of me. Figured out i could at least do part of the 2nd set with the help of a band i use for PT but opted to just stay in boat position for most of the time, but that&#39;s also fine in my opinion. It&#39;s just where my body is at and that&#39;s okay",Cathy Jean,2020-01-07T08:21:12Z,28
@Katie Lenon would be an idea but sadly doesn&#39;t work with my schedule.

If this practice wasn&#39;t a big reminder that I should finally get myself an appointment at a physiotherapist I don&#39;t know what is. I&#39;ve had my hips crack whenever I did any of these leg raises all my life. But I feel like with all that lowering from boat pose both of my hips cracked so extremely loud every single time that my neighbors are for sure awake now. The thing is it doesn&#39;t hurt in the least that&#39;s why I never really worried about it. It&#39;s just an unpleasant feeling because I can also feel my femur hitting some kind of resistance in my hip socket and then releasing with a crack. Not sure how healthy that might be in the long term.,Julia,2020-01-07T08:15:38Z,0

"Thank you for this series Adriene, I&#39;m starting to feel a difference in my day already after day 6!

"WOW! What a workout! Today was definitely challenging for me at times, I&#39;ve never been able to find enjoyment or even feel empowered after an intense ab session - usually just berating myself for not &quot;pushing&quot; hard enough- and I truly loved today sooooo much! Thank you for being such an amazing guide on this journey Adriene, and reminding us that it&#39;s okay to be gentle,loving and soft with ourselves during this process! REALLLYY excited for the rest of this experience..  :D",Courtney Mason-Jones,2020-01-07T07:15:16Z,0

"I was a but scared of this one as I woke up with my back feeling tight but managed it much better than expected. It&#39;s nice to do a core workout that doesn&#39;t just feel hard, edgey or forced. That&#39;s why I love this programme. Thanks Adriene",S Casbolt,2020-01-07T07:10:27Z,4

"The exercise at 16.04 I couldn&#39;t do it without my hands behind me on the mat. And for that I felt so weak and sad, I was not enough strong and so unmotivated. I know that I have to listen to my body, but still, I felt so sad because I couldn&#39;t do without the help of my hands.😔",Simona Falcone,2020-01-07T07:09:09Z,1
"What an amazing intense practise. Only thing is I couldn&#39;t do it fully, I had to adjust and basically stay in a fix boat pose. My body isn&#39;t there yet. I hope this was okay! 🙏",Claire Miller,2020-01-07T07:06:50Z,1

"Wow wow... okay, I had a lot of trouble finding my ease yesterday.. and today was slightly frustrating for me as I had to modify quite some things for myself. Noticing that.. I am not as strong as I like to be, not in body, not in mind. So today was challenging for me. But nevertheless, I didn&#39;t give up and I guess that says something as well.

@Kayla de Groot as per video. I alternated between hands on the ground behind me and my hands catching the backs of my thighs in between breaths. I gave myself permission to not keep up (which was new for me) and omitted the side crunches within the boat pose too.<br />Good luck &lt;3,Tina T,2020-01-07T15:12:12Z,4

Oh man. Abs day is here baby!! I seek to set my abdominals on fire today. Adriene said to expect some core blasting today so I know for a fact that this one is gonna be intense. It&#39;s really tempting to give up in the middle of abdominal exercises due to the burn oneself feels. But I hereby make a promise to myself to accept where I am today and push myself to the limit. Here goes the abs blast . Don&#39;t give up everyone. The burn is worth it. Namaste.,Shadan Zahrooni,2020-01-07T06:08:57Z,40
