"Adriene, im sure you no longer monitor this video since its over a year old but I really need some assistance.   I keep asking but no one can seem to give me answer...please, please, PLEASE show us an alternative to crow and toe balance. My knees cannot do that pose without really bad pain.  While i realize there are some things i just cant do, you usually give alternatives, but never to these moves. Am i the only person who cant do those deep squats?   This is the one move that when you do it, i just feel like a complete failure and am ready to turn off the tv and never come back to yoga again.   It always makes me want to cry feeling like i just have to stop and watch everyone else while i just sit there failing and losing motivation.  I pretty much suck at yoga altogether but at least I  try most other moves...toe stands and sitting squats are just not an option for me. I know there have to be others with this same problem.  Thanks for listening.",Mary Blankenship,2021-02-27T14:13:56Z,0

I started this journey with my body extremely closed up, with no flow and movement, and I&#39;m so glad I am slowly releasing blocks, especially from my front body where most of the blocks are. Also, I did the Pranayam from the video in the description, and I&#39;m so glad to see you grow so much from then and now. It&#39;s so beautiful.

It is perfect for me now , as I have a potentially serious spinal problem that I am healing myself.( I do have my surgeons approval so no worries). Adriene you are inspiring and helping so many people ! Thank you! Love M",Marygrace Tagarelli,2020-08-18T15:43:17Z,0

I will say that it is nice for my wife and I to have something to do together since sooooo much of our time/ energy is spent making sure our boys (11 &amp; 13)  are happy and healthy - especially during the quarantine and all of the larger societal  issues.

"My wrists are not very strong and pretty much any practice with over 3 down dog moments is super challenging to me.

"I&#39;ve never commented on one of these before, but I have to say, this day was extremely challenging for me. I&#39;ve been in a weird rut these past few days and getting to the mat was tough. Then what felt like relentless up down up down all around aaaaaand squat forever. I had difficulty with a lot of moves today in ways I normally wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;m glad I wasn&#39;t in the studio with a big group of people so I could curse as much as I wanted.<br /><br />BUT...I felt super accomplished when I did prayer hands with the squat, even if it was just for a few seconds, even if I&#39;m not at the crow pose stage yet. And I felt amazing at the end, like I earned a bit of rest. That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about with you, Adriene. You&#39;re so encouraging and you tell us we&#39;re strong. Like that part where you told us to say &quot;I am strong&quot; at the top of the plank pose before we lowered down. I needed that. Thank you so much.",materialism,2020-07-09T16:37:28Z,0
Perhaps I tried to do this too early in the morning but my lower back flanks were not having it. Trying to sit and bend forward was painful and I became frustrated because I haven&#39;t had this issue before so  am thinking it&#39;s because I tried to do this in the morning when I normally do it in the evening. Not sure but my lower back is a bit sore now. Wandering if I should try again this evening even though I finished the video. Hmmmm....,Jennifer Smith,2020-07-08T14:04:47Z,0

I loved all your videos so far, but if I take the time to comment precisely on Day 19 it&#39;s to tell you how good a teacher you are.

"Does anyone know the feeling of not being able to inhale completely? Whenever i am supposed to take a deep breath, i inhale as much as i can, but i have the feeling that i need to inhale more. I have the feeling i need more air, but i cant put more inside. I feel like something is blocking me from completely inhaling. What is that? It happens in basically every body position, but when i am in plank or similar positions i can breathe a bit less. <br />I want to inhale stronger than what is physically possible for me.",Janini 123,2020-06-29T18:50:54Z,0

Am I the only one who seems to feel worse and worse as the series progresses? My back hurts more and more anytime I do a downward dog and my knees are killing me in warrior 2. I don&#39;t have any spine or knee conditions that I know of and I&#39;m in my early 20&#39;s. The only time my spine or knees hurt is when doing this.

"I&#39;ve never commented on a YWA video but I always check the comment section before. There is nothing but kindness and love here (and occasional &quot;oh no not core/crow pose&quot;). I have to say how serendipitous this home journey is; I wanted to start in January but I was so busy and couldn&#39;t find the drive. 20 days ago, I started therapy to work on my self-worth and self-esteem as I&#39;ve had to go no-contact with my narcissistic family, who has dissolved my sense of self for decades now. My harvard degree THERAPIST assigned doing YWA in the first session -- specifically YWA. Everyday it seems like Adriene curated each practice for me and my situation -- it&#39;s truly mind blowing. I&#39;m learning that my &quot;home&quot; isn&#39;t broken and I didn&#39;t lose the illusion of a support system that my family provided; I have everything I need and my true home is inside me. On bad days where I need extra love; I know my mat and this community have my back. This journey is incredibly powerful and emotional for me. Thank you Adriene and Benji, for telling me everyday that you love me, I cry every time but in a beautiful, healing way. I may have started late but I did start right on time.",Miranda,2020-05-24T10:51:19Z,0

"Thank you very much for your work and your videos.<br /><br />I am totally determined to finish this 30 day of yoga. Started during quarantine and I feel if I just quit I will feel extremely disappointed at myself.<br /><br />Day 11 my Internet was out and I felt so upset and angry, I actually waited until late in the evening for it to work again and did it late night, a couple of days ago I injured my right hand ring finger and I was afraid of not being able to practice but managed to do it taking extra care not to push too hard on my hand.<br /><br />I am very glad because even if I am not doing things 100% like you, or sometimes some poses are very hard for me, I am giving my best and improving on a daily basis not only body wise, but also working towards building a mindset of commitment and dedication.",DonGaviota,2020-05-22T15:09:16Z,0
Loving this journey so far. Toughest challenge so far was crow. Was really sore in my knees in first position. Any tips ??I even find it hard to sit on my heels 😔 but overall enjoying being back on the mat and will persevere 🙏,Elena McMenemy,2020-05-22T07:24:46Z,0

"I often struggle with doing yoga because I usually find it too easy.<br />Not today. I wanted so badly to do the crow pose, but my knees couldn’t handle it. I noticed myself sobbing because I was so weak and my knees ached so much.<br />And then I remembered: yoga is not like every other form of exercise. <br />Allowing myself to step back is not lazy. It is examining what I can’t do right now and giving myself the room to get there.<br />Yoga is about progress. I need to listen to my body and reward it for doing what it can.",BurningTurtle,2020-05-14T03:24:46Z,1

"10 years ago, during high school, I stayed in a wheelchair for 3 months after my knee dislocated and a doctor at the hospital made the wrong call and fucked up the muscles in my right leg. Since then I&#39;ve always tried everything to get my thigh muscle back to its original strength, and I&#39;ve always failed. At day 19 of this yoga journey, my muscle isn&#39;t completely back of course, but I can feel for the first time in forever that it is GROWING. It&#39;s getting stronger, I can feel it, and I am forever grateful. My left thigh is much more strong, but, not having to go through physiotherapy it is also much less stretchy compared to my weak but very mobile right leg. I&#39;m fixing both those imbalances thanks to you. I can&#39;t think of doing a yoga practice that&#39;s not with you, it helps my peace of mind. Thank you so much.",Melpomene,2020-05-08T16:59:38Z,0

"Really struggled in today&#39;s practice. It was on fire. But when adriene said whisper to yourself &quot;I am strong&quot;, I did it proudly cause I showed up even though it was hard. I did it all except the crow&#39;s pose. Recently, my whole body aches and I can&#39;t get comfortable sleeping. In the morning it feels like I got hit by a truck. But the practice not only lends fluidity to my joints and muscles, it also makes me realize how strong my body is despite what I may think. Thank you adriene.",Willow,2020-05-06T14:07:05Z,1

A little too much for me today. I am too hot. I had difficulties to find my inner balance but I adapted my practise to my energy. I did cobra instead of plank and cow-cat instead of facing dog. It was more adaptation than balance today for me! 😁,Steph,2020-04-22T17:30:36Z,0

"Attempted the crow pose earlier on in the 30 days when we were first introduced to it, and couldn&#39;t do it at all. But today I was able to hold it for like 5 seconds and I was so so so chuffed that I couldn&#39;t stop smiling for the rest of the practice! Thank you Adriene!!",Lucy Robbins,2020-04-20T22:05:58Z,0

"The challenge today was balance on the mat but I am also focused on balance in life. Working from home, though due to this awful virus, has given me much better balance in life.  I’m returning to a daily yoga practice that I left when I began working full time.  I was formerly a student of WaiLana (PBS).  I’m so happy that I have now discovered Adrienne!   Now I  need to keep this balance moving forward. . .",Sandy Nielsen,2020-04-20T12:59:16Z,0

"Wooo! Day 19, baby! Okay, squeezing this one in just before bed around midnight. Sometimes I like doing YWA at night--it is so peaceful. Definitely struggled through the plank/push-up bits, and took a couple child&#39;s poses when necessary. Kicking out the legs and arms felt so good! Sticking with this. This is good. This is healing.

Day 19 completed! Today definitely kicked my butt. It showed me just how much my body still has to go. But yet I still find the hardest thing is to sit still and breath with my eyes closed.

In this current climate, those couple of seconds brought such joy. I am loving my journey through this 30-day challenge and must admit I have sadly missed a few days here and there and had to catch up the next day.. normally I would beat my self up about this, and even give up but this process has taught me to continue on and be kind to myself, what matters to me is that I am not giving up because I missed a day, instead, I am stepping back onto the mat knowing I am trying my best.

A struggle with anxiety brought me back in the mat today and I sweated through the whole practice keeping up the tempo. I felt relief.

Yoga has taught and continues to teach me that my body responds to love and attention, that it is strong and powerfilled and on my side!

"Ok, So I&#39;ve been doing this 30 day challenge so far and I&#39;m afraid that it&#39;s not maybe the best way for me to start trying yoga. I&#39;m too stiff for most of the poses. My core strenght is fine no problems there, but I can&#39;t even get down to a lunge with my hand on the ground. I&#39;ll probably follow this trough since I got this far, but maybe there is something much much more easy for me ? Could anyone maybe guide me to a video meant for an oak tree like myself? No don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoy doing this and am very grateful for these lessons :)",morkmies,2020-01-28T17:48:35Z,0

"Thank you Adriene for this and all other videos, I have practiced with you dozens and dozens times and will continue &lt;3 You are amazing, keep on going &lt;3<br /><br />One tiny constructive feedback I&#39;d like to give, is that I have noticed that many yoga teachers tend to say something like &quot;take a moment to not think about the stressful things in your life&quot;. I think it works quite the opposite. It&#39;s like saying &quot;don&#39;t think about a garlic baguette jogging&quot; – you will think about that. Even though it&#39;s good mindfulness and acceptance practice to try to let those thoughts go. So, if possible, it would be great to guide the focus to the breath, the moment, or anything going on right now. I know the purpose is good, but I prefer positive encouragements instead of the &quot;don&#39;ts&quot;.<br /><br />Thank you so much, namaste!",ellamaijak,2020-01-23T05:17:12Z,0

Its not always the poses or the ab work that is hard, sometimes thats the easisest for me, its just showing up on the mat and accepting myself where i am compared to all my past years on the mat. Ive gained  a lot of weight during post partum this past 8 months of havinf a baby and im not as fit, flexible energetic as i remember myself before. I used to find your classes so easy, a walk in the park but lately they actually challenge me and i always remember what you have said, smile for you been humbled. This whole 30 days journey so far has humbled me and taught me my real.strength is loving myself where i am.even if its just goinf to the mat and crying in child pose for 30 mins lol.

I was not able to get the knees up towards the armpits ( I am 5&#39;2). I felt that maybe my short limbs had something to do with it.

Adriene, you have no idea how much joy and happiness you brought into this boring day of mine. I didn&#39;t even think it was possible for me to achieve that pose, yet I did it and it felt like I was flying. It was freeing, it was beautiful and you just filled me with so much love and lightness. And this journey with you is giving me a little purpose for myself, I&#39;m tryna take care of my body and mind each day and it feels so good. It&#39;s like having a sweet, fun friend by my side, it&#39;s motivating and every day I can&#39;t wait for the next one. <br />Thank you.",LadyMartinson,2020-01-21T17:42:49Z,1

"A day late, but I wanted to share something that I discovered in this particular practice that Adriene helped guide me to. I&#39;ve combined this lovely 30 day yoga series with a journal prompt. So yesterday my prompt was &quot;balance&quot;. When Adriene mentioned that balance isn&#39;t something to achieve, but something to return to, I was like whooooooaaa. Totally. It makes balance easier and more compassionate. It makes it easier because it takes the &quot;do&quot; or the work out of it because there is nothing to achieve. And it makes it more compassionate because it takes the failure out of it. You can&#39;t fail if you&#39;re not working towards achievement. Well, maybe you can, idk. Anyway, I just wanted to share that and say thank you to Adriene and this community.",Megan Horvath,2020-01-21T14:44:01Z,0

I was really, really tired doing yoga yesterday and felt so jealous of all the comments saying how good everyone felt because usually I&#39;m one of those commenters. Today I was feeling a bit of the same way, very tired (wake up at 11:30am and take two naps shortly after kind of tired) and trying not to push myself too hard. Crow pose turned my night around! I got off the ground for, I don&#39;t know, less than a second probably? But it made me feel like a little kid, like I was playing, just having fun. So that&#39;s how Day 19 went for me.

"Looking at balanced as being my natural state was a very new concept. Yet, it makes so much sense. We&#39;re born knowing no ups or downs. We just are who we are. Then the world affects us. Knocks us off balance. This practice has definitely brought me closer to balanced than I ever remember. I am in my third year of running a department. I have 4 staff members, 7 student TAs, and 4 subs. I feel myself more easily letting go of the days when one performs below, what I know is,  their level best. We all have days when we just aren&#39;t our best. I&#39;m good at not attacking them over those days, but now I find myself looking beyond that behavior even in the privacy of my office. That&#39;s huge for own well being. As for crow...well, 1 leg and 2 wings stayed planted, but 1 foot flew 😂",kristi shore,2020-01-21T01:05:38Z,0

"Balance meant something important to me today, not over doing it.  I&#39;ve been very devoted to this 30 days of yoga and meeting on the mat everyday.  Sunday I went with friends to a local brewery for yoga and a pint which meant I missed my morning with Adriene.  usually I would have come home and done a second round of yoga, feeling like I need to stay with the the program or I am a failure.  Today&#39;s practice of balance means that I have to balance my desire to keep up with my yoga practice and my bodies need or rest.",Amanda Mott,2020-01-20T23:42:01Z,0

I realised after a second.<br />It was challenging but in a good way. It was a chance to prove ourselves that yes, we can do it.<br />Thank you so much for today&#39;s practice.

"One of the best things about home practice is the ability to modify when needed and not feel bad about it. With a bone deformity in my front foot, toe stands can become painful quickly. It&#39;s one of the very few times the body is quitting on me before the mind. I do it fully for a few moments but then opt for a yogi squat with flat feet instead. &quot;Take what you need, leave what you don&#39;t&quot; - Adriene. 😊💚🙏🏻",Lori Beth,2020-01-20T18:20:15Z,0
"Crow pose isn’t one I have in my practice yet, so today I focused on balancing in that squat instead. I found using a block helped me sit up a little taller in that pose but still gave my fingers something to rest on if I found myself losing my balance.",Rachel A,2020-01-20T18:19:27Z,0

My wrists are getting stronger and my breathing has been better. This is my first journey with Adriene and I am ecstatic about the changes I am seeing in my strength, calm and acceptance of myself. I was able to lift one foot off the mat for the crow pose-boy! was I sweating bullets but so excited about that 2 second lift! Don&#39;t give up, friends! Just like Adriene says here it is a return to our natural state of balance. That just means a whole new way of looking at things. It does mean a return &quot;HOME&quot;. Very aptly chosen word.

Honestly my favorite part was the drum roll on Benji’s belly😊 since my ACL replacement surgery last April I struggle with Balance... the last two days were tougher for me... however today I was able to get on my toes and hands in prayer position... big step for me🙏🏻♥️ bring on day 20🥰,christine wellington,2020-01-20T14:32:50Z,0
I woke up this morning with a really sore shoulder.  I did a lot of modifications today. It was the kindest thing I could do for myself.  It felt good to show up on the mat and tend to myself all at the same time.,Debra LaRocco,2020-01-20T14:32:03Z,0

"It was a bit of a struggle getting on the mat today (even when I’m close to doing yoga with Adrienne for nearly 100 days straight now), but I pushed through and landed on the mat! Still can’t do crow pose, but for the FIRST time EVER I was able to fold over when seated and grab my big toes WITH MY LEGS STRAIGHT ON THE FLOOR! I could also sink down and push up with my elbows in the proper position SO EASILY compared to when I started. I remember back when in October when I couldn’t touch my toes in a forward fold, and couldn’t do a push-up to save my life.

"One thing I&#39;m really enjoying about all of these sessions is that it keeps reminding me that while I&#39;m absurdly inflexible in the hamstrings and can barely move at all in seated forward fold, I can twist like it&#39;s nothing.

I’ve been doing my own practice everyday since summer and I think I’ll finish this 30 day journey on time. I do vividly recall the first time I brought Adienes practice into my everyday life - I was driving and heard myself take this big breath and let it out, then relaxed my shoulders. After that I found myself becoming more consistent with my practice. I wish you well.",S-quirrel,2020-01-20T15:59:22Z,1

This is my 2nd 30-days Yoga with Adriene, finished the first last month and started this go round the next day, I did miss 2 days straight, was having issues with my foot, but I am sticking with it. My goal is to take Yoga with Adriene for 1-Year straight, so I missed 2 days so I started the count over again. I too dreads the crow pose, I have torn rotator cuff in both arms &amp; weak wrist, bad knees, so yeah, this pose is totally dreaded by me out, but am going to try every time she instructs it in one of her video classes....one of these days, am going to get it.

"SuperSonicSkyline I also started out that way. I think it was because I didn’t have enough body strength yet. I substitute child’s pose or puppy pose with active arms and work with my knees on the mat and work on stretching my shoulders instead of going into downward dog. But 2 years later I have a much stronger core and can now comfortably do downward dog. So listen to your body and find substitutes that work for your body, or just try 1 short downward dog each day and very slowly build up the muscles needed. Good luck on your journey.

"OMG! Can we all give Benji a drumroll if we meet him, such a cutie :) Ok balance has always been a love and need to learn to balance relationship. I use the word balance in other things though with my body its always a hit or miss. Today was abit of a hit and miss. Crow is always a challenge for me, sometimes I get it other times not. I use blocks to help me stabilize myself, and i got up there for a second, these tree trunks (legs) !!! but I felt good stretching my legs and I&#39;m learning to push my inner thighs closer to my body to keep my balance which is helping. All in all a good play time being that my energy is low today. Oh also those push ups (my fists had to come out to help me up and down as my wrists were being &#39;fussy&#39;) Hope other yogi&#39;s flew in crow today and enjoyed the seesaw of balance.

Well that was a bit of a challenge today. I was so proud of myself for being able o do he planks and then you introduced us to the beginning of crow!! I struggled o get into he first part of the pose. I think may be I should have done yesterdays session on believe first!! Sadly that went into my junk mail folder. I have no idea why..or is there a message in that? Anyway I like to be on the same day as everyone else so when I realised what had happened I skipped Believe and went straight to Balance. I sill enjoyed the practice even though I struggled towards the end. Thank you Adriene for helping me to start each day with focus and joy. Have a happy monday everyone. Namaste xx,Karen Lynne,2020-01-20T08:14:03Z,1
"Woohoo, this senior yogi struggled a bit/a lot with those plank push ups (glad no one was watching, hilarious) but it’s all about the taking part and doing our version ? But I made it through, arms are feeling it today, my weakness, but that needs regular work for me, not achieved in some practices. This one went super fast, a mystery tour ! See you tomorrow for Day 20 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💞",Gill Smith,2020-01-20T08:09:17Z,3
When I saw that the practice is over 30 minutes long I was like... No... I barely managed to work yesterday and I&#39;m supposed to do it today for this long? My body really is in a bad condition today...<br>But gosh this one was so nice and smooth and I felt like only 15 minutes passed.<br>Namaste! 🙏,Mer lin,2020-01-20T07:57:21Z,210

Also my hair really frustrated my today, there were all these short hairs slipping from my pony tail and falling in my face in the difficult poses and making it itch and I was like &quot;Can you pls NOT?&quot; But frustration is part of the challenge for me (on and off the mat), so I guess that was alright? Gotta learn to deal with it somehow... why not with Adriene? :)",servena,2020-01-20T07:25:54Z,0

"Day 19 - Balance! I wasn&#39;t feeling it today.. 🙁 I got up feeling meh and tried my best on the mat, but my head is so foggy I couldn&#39;t even properly focus on the breath. No focus means improper poses and 0 balance. I&#39;ll try this one again later some time to fully commit. For now I&#39;m going to accept that this is what is is.
