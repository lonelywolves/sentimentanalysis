"The practice picks up just a bit today engaging you in the vocabulary we have learned thus far, while inviting transformation and progress.<br /><br />Day 5 can be a tough one to arrive for. The hard part is over. You are here. You are doing great!",Yoga With Adriene,2019-01-06T13:49:48Z,652
"I was working with some of the Breathe 30 day videos, then I found Dedicate, so I did two videos today.  I feel I am getting stronger now and able to do the three-legged downward dog.  It was difficult, but I&#39;m getting better at moving from that position.",Susan Figlietti,2021-02-19T17:03:38Z,0

I just wanted to say thank you very much I love these yoga journeys and today I felt a real emotional response when you said &quot;you are exactly where you should be&quot;. As someone who puts a lot of pressure on my self I feel thankful for the acknowledgement that I have grown and will continue to grow. Had to do some of the work on my knees today but that&#39;s ok!

I am doing this journey after the Home journey and it is really helping me ground after a day of home schooling and trying to work and be a kind person. What would we do without Adriene? What a wonderful kind soul she is üåà,Sue Lewis,2020-06-14T10:25:53Z,0

"Adriane, thank you! I have been following you for years. It has been a slow process but every day is better and better. There was no COVID when I first discovered you. Home yoga was a great thing for me at the time my budget was short to pay classes. But with time I have keep on learning Yoga for several reasons. None of them is stronger than your pace, your style, your attitude your support. Benji also help! Besides, I realized today how your scenario has changed for better.

"Today was tough. My strong body just didn‚Äôt want to power up. Sp grudgingly I surrendered and did the lighter versions of the poses. Especially the wide leg stands.

"Hello, everyone. I&#39;ve been a fan of Adriene&#39;s since earlier last year. I just recently received my YTT-200 certification and am deepening my home practice. Now to my point: I have only gotten emotional during my practices twice in the whole two years I&#39;ve been doing Yoga. Once was because I had a bad day and the other was because I just wasn&#39;t mentally present. Today, with this practice. Oh my. When we rocked back to Sukhasana and completed the cool down, my body just knew to put my hands on my knees in surrender. In Anjali Mudra, I immediately teared up but in Namaste, the tears were flowing every which way.  I struggle with letting my body lead, my mind always has the front seat. Today, some switch was flipped and it just felt really good to know that what I did, before you instructed it, was correct and that it felt amazing. Thank you for reading.",Musyc Luver,2020-12-16T18:25:01Z,1

"Hi Yogi&#39;s! I am having a difficult time planting my heals on my downward facing dog. I&#39;m a pretty tall fella, 6&#39;4&quot;, so when it comes to forward folds and downward dogs, my flexibility isn&#39;t exactly where I want it to be.

"I found it just came over time! It took me 6 months of daily yoga but now my feet finally touch the floor! I found it is just like any flexibility training meaning it just takes time. However, I did find it sped up a little bit when in every downward dog I would actively try to reach my heels to the floor, building the flexibility that way! Also bringing your feet a little closer to your hands can help.",Margaret Pugh,2020-08-05T12:38:01Z,0

What I‚Äôm saying is that by this day next year, I will be an even more accomplished 68 year old yogi!  And I continue to be so grateful that ours paths crossed, even if it is on you tube!  If you can think of anything I can do to free my feet and ankles from spasming, I would be so happy!  I‚Äôm doing a lot already, but I think you might have an even better idea!  AND they‚Äôre not as horrible as they use to be.  Have a great day on me (dec 22)!  I‚Äôll send you some positive vibes! You do good work for the planet!",cathy hollaway,2019-12-22T17:39:32Z,0

"As a student and new yoga teacher I know I&#39;m not supposed to judge anyone and my next comments may seem like a judgment but that is NOT my intention (disclaimer). I just wonder how come Adriene&#39;s knees are hiked up above her hips. As someone who practices daily I have a hard time understanding how that is comfortable in Sukhasana which means &quot;easy or comfort pose.&quot; I hope in her next series that she learns to take her feet underneath the knees which will help her bring her knees down and help maintain the pose in a way that is healing to the body. In other news, vinyasa is not my jam but I&#39;m still doing this series to try for myself but if it weren&#39;t for my base in the Iyengar Yoga tradition I think I might have really hurt my left wrist this morning.",Danielle Deutsch,2019-10-10T19:40:09Z,0

Since I&#39;ve made lifestyle changes and changed my diet,  I am more consistent and have the energy to make it to the mat each day even on bad days!

It&#39;s not the first time but I don&#39;t know where this kind of tension comes from. It&#39;s really frustrating though because it influences everything - the rest of my body, my posture,  my movements and my mood.Some days it seems like to get better but then it gets worse again. Sometimes it really hurts and I have a headache or I feel really drained and exhausted although not having done anything productive.<br />Through your yoga I can release at least a bit but not completely. Maybe it will get better day by day.<br />I hope I&#39;ll be able to change my mindset with the series and become more positive and confident.",BeyondTheBop,2019-08-07T22:06:19Z,1

This one was hard. But not giving up. I am finding that having stopped practice for a couple of years has really put my body out of flex mode. Glad to be back on the mat. Have to put a day of rest between videos but gonna keep doing them. My only pain is in my wrists when doing table. Making fists instead. How can I strengthen my wrists? To do table without pain.,Loretta Railing,2019-07-16T14:48:06Z,0

"I love Yoga with Adriene but my one complaint is that the volume of her voice changes all the time!  Sometimes she&#39;s so loud that I can&#39;t even relax and the next second she&#39;s whispering and I can&#39;t hear anything at all!  The beginning and the end are the worst!  I&#39;m supposed to have my eyes closed for inner reflection but then I don&#39;t hear what Adriene says so I end up having to keep my eyes open and watch what to do.  The other part that I struggle with is when a pose makes me face away from the TV, then I can&#39;t hear what to do next and end up getting behind!  Soooo frustrating!  But again, love love love having Adriene as my teacher! I&#39;ll keep coming back from more, just a suggestion for whoever is producing these videos!",Trisha DeBolt,2019-07-12T23:27:07Z,0
"I have been doing yoga on and off for years, kept getting hurt trying to &quot;keep up&quot; with others in the class.

"I now tell myself it&#39;s normal to feel those feelings. When I first began my practice my inner critic was in charge for a very long time. It was not until I allowed the thought to exist then pass (I still have the thoughts, but they quickly leave) that I was able to understand that my thoughts are not in control of me, they are simply thoughts.",Chris Collins,2019-07-12T19:12:54Z,0

"I started doing Yoga With Adriene last week when I started feeling consistent back pain around the T10/T11. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was because of my strenuous exercise or because I‚Äôm overweight or because of my myomas, or a combination of two or more of those. I‚Äôm 32 years old and I feel like a wreck, health-wise. All I know is that after doing 3 or 4 of her videos, I decided to stop my strenuous workout (30 mins cardio reaching a heart rate of 165bpm + 1 hr strength exercises, 5 days a week) and I decided to do dedicate. I‚Äôm only on day 5, but I feel better. I‚Äôll start watching my diet next week. I have been eating pretty much anything lately. I hope I‚Äôll feel much better once I eat clean and continue doing dedicate. Adriene, please continue doing these free videos. You‚Äôre changing lives for the better. And to everyone else who are thinking of doing this or saying to themselves, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do this, just not now yet‚Äù, a piece of unsolicited advise - making the decision to wear something comfy and hopping on your mats, might just be the best decision you‚Äôll do for your health. Don‚Äôt wait. Just do it! And feel the difference even on day 1. As early as day 1, I was reminded that mindful breathing brings about healing. Doing dedicate allowed me to practice mindful breathing more religiously.",Fae B.,2019-05-05T12:17:22Z,1

I have to say that I&#39;ve been through the original 30 day yoga with Adriene and I definitely preferred it to dedicate 30 day and its simply because she taught me the discipline and flow of the work out. I&#39;m on day 5 of dedicate programe and I find this series too chatty...there is so many pauses with chatting about smearing substances across your stomach (!) and mid excersize and etc... I really think I&#39;m gonna give up this one and I really don&#39;t like quitting anything....  üôÄ especially when she made me fall in love with yoga and myself...,Stella ***,2019-04-19T21:21:21Z,0

"I really enjoy your videos Adriene since years already. But to be honest this is the first time that I keep &quot;pushing&quot; myself to be content and do the practice after work. I&#39;m going through a difficult time in my life right now, where I get confronted with many feelings, thoughts, fears etc that I&#39;ve been trying to hide since I was a child. And today as I sat on my yoga mat I started crying but 10 mins in I felt so much better and I am so thankful for you being able to change my emotions through your videos, jokes, kindness and relaxed being. THANK YOU, I just thought you&#39;d like to know.",Konstantia Grigoroudi,2019-04-17T16:55:15Z,2
"This is the 4th time through the 30 day challenge and I still can&#39;t keep up with you as much as I would like.  But I have progressed so much.  The first time through I could hardly get down on the floor and when I did I thought I would never get back up. Now I can do the downward dog without much strain.  Also, I&#39;ve noticed the horrible carpel tunnel problem I was having in my wrists last year isn&#39;t anywhere near as bad this year.  My wrists are getting stronger.  I will be 65 this year.  It&#39;s about time I worked on my muscles and balance.  Thanks.",Denise McGill,2019-04-16T17:23:23Z,0

I have always been drawn in a weird way to yoga, but never felt like I found a comfortable teacher or class, as the atmosphere for me is very important. You create that awesome, calming, nature-like feeling in every video, you have such a calm and sweet voice, and I can set my room and concentrate only on my improvement and not think about anything else. I do most of the video with my eyes closed, as this seems to be what my body wants. You are so great and we appreciate you so much! You do absolute wonders for my power to meditate and visualise, and I absolutely felt the need to thank you! I wish you all the good and health in the world!

Hello Adrienne I love your yoga. I have a question. What is the difference between the True and Dedicate series?,Ricardo Burbano,2019-03-01T12:31:59Z,0
"Hi Adriene! I&#39;ve just found your classes and am really, really loving them - thank you. I&#39;d not done yoga in about 5 years so am really starting as a total novice. I have a question - I&quot;m finding that when doing downward dog and any of the poses which put weight on the wrists, the outside of the palm of one of my hands gets incredibly painful, as if something is being sprained. The pain is only on the outside part of the palm though. <br /><br /><br />Would you have any idea what this might be and what I could do to help it? I&#39;ve tried switching up where I put the most weight, and putting more weight on my fingertips, but it doesn&#39;t seem to help.<br /><br />Thank you again so much for these classes!<br />Adrienne",Adrienne Pitts,2019-03-01T10:59:11Z,0

"I started this practice with amazing energy.  I was sooo excited to start as this has become my favorite time of day!  However, my french bulldog puppy kept coming in and giving me kisses during downward dog, and as much as I love puppy kisses, I kept losing focus and became really frustrated.  I handed my frenchie a greenie treat, hopped back on the mat, refocused, and I was amazed at how fast I can fall back into it!  I used to never be able to do that, I&#39;d have to meditate for a few minutes to get back in the &#39;flow&#39; of things.

"I was worried about this one before starting it - I tend to get frustrated with vinyasas if I&#39;m not going fast &quot;enough&quot; or if I&#39;m not able to hit the poses just right.

I normally tend to spend my day with others, focusing on them and keeping myself in check just enough to be.

Done in the evening, all the troubles from the day are dished out on a table and cooled. The hassles exist afterwards but they&#39;re less draining afterwards. In addition to all that, I have been dealing with anxiety and this sense of calm that this brings is pure in its beauty.

"Coming back to yoga at 68 after a few years away because of a series of unrelated little injuries.  I&#39;ve lost a lot of muscle mass in the last three or four years away, and the strength to come off the floor is gone. I have to come into Downward Dog from cobra by coming up on knees rather than pushing directly back. I&#39;m  feeling like this is going  a little too fast but I&#39;m making adjustments and know I can always do the 30 days over and over until I get those heels down on the floor and am able to step directly into forward bend from plank, one foot at a time, but in the meantime I&#39;m walking up and doing it at my pace.  I know from past experience this isn&#39;t the goal, but the goal  is to focus on the moment.  I&#39;m getting the benefits, and before I know it I will be doing things I thought were impossible.",Kristine Jones,2019-02-09T21:03:21Z,0

"Being completely honest here: I tried one of your yoga 30 day practices last year and failed. I managed to make it to day 26 or something, but it took me 4 months to do it. I had fallen and injured my right knee, so even basic table top was out of the question. Waited for my knee to heal, then I found out I needed my gallbladder out stat. Kept writing in my calendar to start doing yoga again, and I finally made it at the beginning of February. It wasn&#39;t planned really, but I follow you on facebook and one of your videos started playing and it made me miss (despite the physical endurance) how fun your videos are! Started February 2nd, and plan on making it through the 30 days even if I have to take a break once in awhile. I also deal with migraines and a back issue (it&#39;s complicated), so I might have to actually slow the speed of your videos down. I just want to focus on moving slowly but with purpose and save myself from hurting my back. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so much for doing these videos for people like me. You have a beautiful soul! Love seeing Benji photobombing (ha, videobombing?) every once in awhile.",Deyja Moors,2019-02-08T20:04:33Z,0

"Dear sweet Adriane, I have been a true follower since 2015. It pains me to see that you are putting more and more the focus on talking instead of yoga. Maybe you have noticed it, but sometimes you are taking for example 2 minutes for the left side and 5 min for the right side..pure on talking and talking. My right side is becoming superflexible, but the left.. ay ay. Maybe you can make a 30 days challenge of just giving the instructions and further nothing? That would be awsome!<br /><br />(As to see also in this video, just after 16 minutes, the yoga really begins. In all your other ones, we are already rocking it)",Katrien Elzinga,2019-02-05T18:47:55Z,0

"So I teach exercise classes (up to 4 hours a day) and lift weights. Everyone considers me &#39;the fitness lady&#39; but my body is telling me otherwise. I started this dedicate journey bc my nerves down the right side of my back have become compressed, and my left shoulder constantly aches. So I&#39;ve stopped going to the gym, and after day 4 I noticed my back has aligned really well and my shoulder has started to feel less painful (breathing into the pain, rather than being frustrated with it is helping). I&#39;m now considering getting rid of my gym membership, swapping to martial arts &amp; just doing yoga with Adriene! I think what I&#39;m learning is that the premise of weightlifting is just unsustainable- keep tearing your muscles, keep adding the weights even when your body is telling you otherwise, keep pushing yourself. When really we need to listen to our bodies &amp; should feel energised after exercise. What&#39;s the point of lifting really heavy if you feel completely burnt out after and need to supplement to get through it? Doesn&#39;t sound like health to me.",Lauren Ellaway,2019-01-27T12:53:53Z,0

"Hi Adriene , Thank you for al the great lessons so far. You are a really good teacher. i like that you always pay attention that we are not tightening our jaws en so on because unconsciously that happens sometimes and i really like it that you point that out, but i have a question i started this 30 day journey with some back pain from a previous yoga session that was called chakra yin yoga on youtube? i have never heard from that before so i wanted to try it. but i don&#39;t know if my back is hurting because i did the moves wrong or that it is maybe a sign of healing?? because my back is always bent in that spot but normally it doesn&#39;t hurt.i wanted to wait a couple days and do your yoga sessions that i normally do hoping that it would go over but it doesn&#39;t. i don&#39;t really feel the need to see a doctor since i am still capable to do everything it just hurts a bit, but i am just curious to know .",Donehv,2019-01-20T20:50:52Z,0

"This yoga practice has helped me so incredibly much. I feel warmed, relieved, calm, and ready to go most days. <br /><br />I loved what you said about &quot;It all begins with the breath, followed by the foundation...&quot; As a singer, this concept resonates with me so strongly and couldn&#39;t have been a more perfect mantra to start my day (currently prepping for a big concert this evening :) ). Sound, movement, motivation, all starts with the breath and the inhale. Then you rely on your foundation and support to move through your journey. Whether it&#39;s for work, just to get through your day (or in my case: to get through that passage in the Donizetti piece that has had me worked up this whole week) trust in the breath and your foundation. Your body WILL support you through your practice :). <br /><br />Thank you for your words of wisdom, Adriene<br /><br />Much love, and namaste<br /><br />Ginny",Ginny Weant,2019-01-20T16:53:37Z,0

"Thurs., 1/17/19:  Lovely flow. I&#39;m picking back up on the subtleties of yoga asanas, like cycling the energy from toes to fingers and really breathing into those poses. It may come as a shock, but actually the hardest pose is towards the beginning for me, where we are just pausing in an arms-up position while sitting down. Most yoga practices that I&#39;ve done only stay in those poses for approximately one breath and then you move on to the next pose, so you get distracted with the movement and forget your discomfort. I really like getting a chance to explore more of the minute spaces where I might be tight and then getting to loosen them, no matter how obscure they may be. After today&#39;s practice, I feel a lot more spacious, namaste c:",Katelyn Bowen,2019-01-17T22:40:31Z,1

Adriene makes things so approachable that even if I can&#39;t flow nicely, or do the moves the exact same way due to my physical limitations, I find myself looking forward to practicing. I hope that I can stick with this long term because already I am feeling muscles being used that haven&#39;t been used in years, and feeling good about embracing a practice.",Caitlyn Bullard,2019-01-17T20:07:30Z,0

"Coming to this after a week of pausing... I started strong and then, my cat Milo (of 18 years!) took a quick turn and sadly I had to say goodbye to him last Monday. üòø It&#39;s been an extremely challenging week.

Will you be making a 30 day series for ultra-beginners to start the new year off with as well? Do you have any tips?

Not my usual extra energy feel.<br />So I came here to read comments which is almost never the right choice. But it was! <br />Thank you to everyone here giving so much love and support and saying how it was hard for you too but you&#39;re proud you showed up. Because it reminded me to be proud I showed up. And to not be scared of what&#39;s coming or that I won&#39;t be able to keep up. That there is support here.

"Hey Adriene, I have been inspired from your yoga videos for a couple years now, and to sum it up these videos, specially the lst 30 day challenge, that&#39;s what kick started my daily practice, but getting to the point.....you have such a peaceful voice and have sometimes played the keys with your voice in the background and fits creating lofty vibes,  with your permission I would like to go through some of your videos and sample your voice and gather together a vocal sample message that can create the message, to stand strong in life and with inhale n exhale we can create love towards ourselves and each other, would be an honour to have you sampled into one of my works, understand you would get thousands of messages so no worries if you don&#39;t respond cheers from NZ",FlowKey,2019-01-07T06:47:47Z,0

"Any time someone asks for a yoga reference, my mind automatically flies to YWA &amp; this new 30 day practice is reminding me why!<br />It is so nice to follow someone who knows what they are doing. I remember when I first began thinking ‚Äúwow I‚Äôm unstable here‚Äù when really I didn‚Äôt understand how I should be using my muscles. It makes all the difference in lunges and warrior poses when you remind us to ‚Äúsqueeze our upper thighs‚Äù and with all the other poses as well; reminding us how we should be using each part of our bodies for that proper formation which makes all the difference!<br />While the practice hasn‚Äôt been extremely demanding, I am sore (in a good way) all over because I‚Äôm engaging my whole body.

I was having issues syncing my breath with my movements (mostly because I was breathing so hard from the exercise) and I basically fell out of one of the lunges because I was shaking so bad. I started to get mad at myself, but then my dog came over and laid down next to me and I took that as I sign of support. Instead of giving up I gave myself a second and then jumped back into the practice. At the end, I took a minute to lay on the floor with my dog and think of the parts of today&#39;s practice where I could feel myself getting stronger and not struggling as much (my arms aren&#39;t shaking in tabletop or downward dog as much as they were on day 1 and 2) and now I am excited to continue on and keep getting stronger and I will keep meeting my body where it is at now.",Kristen,2019-01-07T03:20:51Z,0

"Today I really had a moment of realizing how far I have come in my yoga practice. I was sitting in the very beginning, and realized that I am using yoga as a tool to calm myself, a way to feel strong and always a way to try and accept myself without needing to constantly judge. The first year I tried this, 2016, I tried to muscle through, and when I missed a day I would make it up the next day, and do two or three videos trying to &quot;catch up&quot;. I learned over time, though, that while completing the videos is important, it is more important to encourage myself. So instead of beating myself down, each day, after I complete a practice, I tell myseld, &quot;Good job! You&#39;ve done 5 days so far! Way to go!&quot;<br />I&#39;m just trying to work on being present in each moment and stop worrying about the past or the future. It&#39;s a lot of work. But you&#39;re amazing Adriene, and I cannot express how grateful I am that you create this gift, for us, every year- millions of people, many of whom you&#39;ve never met, have been impacted by you and your amazing spirit. Please keep giving and know that you have made the world a much brighter, better place for me. &lt;3",Hannah Schuler,2019-01-07T03:17:57Z,0

I went to a community yoga class today and it was pretty cool but the loud children and man with his chair set up right behind my ass was enough to have my energy a little off. I was able to remember my breath and foundation and shake off moments of frustration that I knew were rooted in my annoyance with external circumstances. I just knew that at the end of the day I would be returning to my little sanctuary to complete day 5 with this online tribe! At home practice has taken a new meaning today.

I know from hanging out with you for 3+ years that when I have a bad attitude, I have to consider why, so I  was constantly asking, why are you being so impatient? Why are you being so negative? The practice still sucked but I used the time to turn inward.

"First, I want to thank you for your videos. I&#39;ve faced a number of serious health problems during the course of the last year and, thanks to you, I&#39;ve just worked out for five straight days! Your routines are easy enough that I&#39;ve been able to modify them to work with a blown-out knee - something I can&#39;t seem to so with any of the other routines I&#39;ve tried. I&#39;m feeling better if only because I&#39;m getting to move around a little each day.<br /><br />Second, I have RA and doing poses which require clawing through the hands is difficult for me.

"These practices are giving me life in this new year!!! A number of years ago I had a very steady yoga practice at a local studio, which I fell out of due to work and schedule changes. I forgot how much I love it, and while my body is super tight because I&#39;m now a distance runner, it&#39;s amazing to see how much my body remembers. I&#39;ve been able to adjust the practice when needed, to strengthen without judgement over my poor, tight limbs.

Thank you for being so amazing and for taking time guiding us on our journeys. <br /><br />I have a question, my hands get really sweaty so downward-facing dog is almost impossible. I&#39;m jus slipping and cannot let myself go in to the position. Puppy pose is fine but I feel that it messes with the flow. I have tried to grab a hold of the sides of my mat a few times but it feels like I&#39;m gonna rip through quite a few mats that way üòã Do you have any tips on how to deal with the pose and sweaty hands? üòÖ Thanks again!",NedhuggenBjork,2019-01-06T21:57:34Z,0

"Hey Adriene ! hope this comment finds u well. First of thank u so much for dedicating ur time and energy to come up with this beautiful journey for free! Really appreciate that. I was determined to go allong this journey the moment u announced it, when in day 3 i injured my hamstring going from downward dog to uttanasana :&#39;( i know i rushed myself and there&#39;s no coming back now. I don&#39;t feel much pain when i walk though but i can feel the overload in my hamstring. I was wondering, since i obviously can&#39;t continue the journey for now :(, if u can advice me some yoga moves that i can still do with my injured hamstring (maybe target the upper body?).

My first accomplishment!: My hips don&#39;t move as much as in the past. I really appreciate that you are guiding us slowly. That way I can focus much more on the right positions and the right breath (and since I am learning to breath better through yoga and meditation practice my stomach is a little bit better).,Marie Winchester,2019-01-06T21:22:32Z,1
Today I had one of those headaches that made doing anything where my head was lower than my heart (aka. downward dog) nearly impossible as it seemed that every second in that pose my head throbbed more and more. I had to be gentle with myself and be okay with having to modify some moves and go into child&#39;s pose a couple times. It was challenging because I want to see more changes in my body and I want to be able to keep up --- but today I am trying to ease into knowing doing something modified is still progress... still a step in the right direction.,Leanne Anderson,2019-01-06T21:18:54Z,0

"I have been going into this challenge after a fairly long period of inactivity... so I&#39;m a bit weaker than the last time I did yoga, and slightly heavier... so I&#39;m finding it fairly difficult to keep the positions for as long as she is trying to get us to do... and maybe on occasion cursing slightly under my breath as my joints are not very cool with all the pressure I&#39;m putting on them... particularly in the knees and wrists. But... I&#39;m working through it... stopping for a moment if I feel I need to and going back in. Im already feeling better in general (I&#39;ve been adding in cardio to my routine too) and I&#39;m sure once I&#39;ve lost some weight and gained some strength this all won&#39;t feel nearly as difficult on my joints. I mean, I used to find downward dog kind of restful... but now its just killing my arms...",Kabi Ebl,2019-01-06T21:13:06Z,0
"I am going to be honest and tell you, that I almost skipped the practice because I felt too stressed and actually felt bad, because I hadn&#39;t really eaten healthily, as I had promised myself to do.

"I never post but feel the need to share this... Our family dog of almost 14 years passed away unexpectedly last night (he‚Äôd been completely fine, still healthy despite his age at his last vet check last year). Needless to say we‚Äôre pretty heartbroken (husband and two teenage sons). Everyone is at work (or away at university) today and I‚Äôm kind of wandering around my house aimlessly. Today, though, marked day 66 of 66 of Yoga with Adriene for me, and this is the one thing I knew I ‚Äòhad‚Äô to do today to keep the chain going and the one thing I knew would make me feel at least a little bit better. It did. Thank you, Adriene, for helping me through a tough day, and also for the way following you for 66 days straight is changing so many aspects of my life. Give Benji an extra hug for me - and anyone else who reads this who has pets. You just never know... And lots of love and cheers to everyone on the Yoga with Adriene bandwagon. If you‚Äôre new to it, keep at it - showing up every day really is life changing. Even with tears landing on my mat today, it gave me solace.",kjoyz,2019-01-06T20:57:38Z,73

"A cleansing and refreshing practice, thank you Adriene.  I even treated myself to shavasana afterwards.  It is amazing how I have grown since the first time I did YOGA REVOLUTION many moons ago.  My &#39;performance&#39;, the length of practice and intensity does not even concern me any more.  I enjoy every moment for what it is and know that it is exactly as it should be.  I&#39;m in the moment for as long as it takes, with acceptance and compassion, and I LOVE it! Thank you for helping me cultivate this gift to myself, which ultimately allows me to better serve my earthly purpose ;o)  Namaste and Bright Blessings! xXx",Jules Sparkles,2019-01-06T20:30:47Z,0

I came into it very stressed and nervous but when I let myself feel what was happening in my body and really went within, it helped to soothe and reshape my energy for the day.

I came here today knowing that this was going to be difficult but thinking that I could make it though. I was both right and very very wrong. There&#39;s a reason why I only do home practices and not classes. I can scream whenever I  want.,DragonbornBard,2019-01-06T18:54:09Z,0

"Today‚Äôs home practice was a little different..... because I did it in a crowded Planet Fitness in my hometown!

The practice did pick up... ayayay! My legs and feet don&#39;t feel strong at all; lots of shaking and can&#39;t really feel grounding but stuck to it and completed it. I trust it will get better in time. Thanks!,Leesly Leon,2019-01-06T18:52:30Z,0

"This practice made me realize just how strong I am! I‚Äôve been doing some modifications the past few days, especially for Downward dog, that pose is really difficult for me strength wise: but today I was able to do almost all the upper arm work, and am leaving the mat sweaty, but proud and full of happiness and positivity, and that‚Äôs definitely not how I felt when I stepped onto it.

Day 5 was a bit of a challenge. I found myself out of breath a lot and shaky.  Then I realized that I&#39;m practicing at 4000ft. Above sea level!

"I&#39;m jetlegged and have had a migraine all day, so I was so tempted not to do Day 5 considering it was flow. However, I did it and I&#39;m happy it did.

It was painful. I didn&#39;t want to be here today. But, I pushed through and I did it. I don&#39;t know why today was so hard for me. It just was.

"I am so grateful that each of these are in doable segments. <br />.<br />Sometimes I find that when I have gone to classes that are 1 hour or more I can do them then, but find it difficult to go back for a few days. My goal is to strengthen myself to the point where my body can recover from each practice as it has these past few days, and welcome the next day with as much anticipation. <br />.<br />I know these will get harder, depending on my current abilities but so far so good. ‚ù§Ô∏èüí™üèº",Karen Hughes,2019-01-06T18:26:21Z,6

"Today I honestly felt more fatigued than usual. I was a little bummed during the practice because I wasn&#39;t able to do all of the poses for as long as I wanted, but when we came to the end and I placed my hands to my third eye I told myself that I did it perfectly for what my body needed today, and my dog came and gave me a kiss through my hands.

NerdyCanadian hey fellow Canadian. The point is that you showed up. It‚Äôs ok to feel fatigued and sometimes frustrated but keep on showing up. That‚Äôs the hardest part. Stay strong and modify poses if needed. Modifying isn‚Äôt failure. Modifying is respecting your boundaries and your you (sorta speak). You got this! üòé,bethnie dorsainvil,2019-01-07T02:26:54Z,2

That sometimes you need to &#39;give in&#39; and use an easier posture, sometimes you need to push yourself through.

"Huge high 5 at the start! Loved it<br /><br />Looking for some advice tho - I broke my elbow 1.5yrs ago and ever since, downward dog has just been difficult for me. I cant straighten that arm, nor can I rotate my arm bicep forwards. It puts a lot of pressure through my shoulders and is not the comfy pose it used to be.

"I have tried to stay on course with these challenges for 3 years, and this year finally feels different. I did a few days of prep practices, and now with keeping on track with dedicate, I&#39;m already noticing significant mental differences, it feels so good. I have one concern though, I&#39;m wondering if anyone has thoughts on this. I have pain in my wrists during tabletop/downward dog etc. And I can&#39;t seem to relieve it. I&#39;m a musician so my wrist health is super important to me, and I often have to go into fists to feel like I am protecting them.

"Just a quick open forum question. I&#39;m sure lots of us have to find odd times between the day to fit I&#39;m our practice. I&#39;m sure even more live with kids, siblings, and roommates. So my question is; <br />How do you find the focus when so many different bodies are moving around you at the same time? How do you find the peace and quiet when there isn&#39;t as much as you&#39;d prefer?

"That&#39;s so interesting that there is a pattern where people tend adjust themselves when they get to mountain pose.  I was definitely doing that during Day 4 practice, and when you addressed it, I was surprised as I always am during those moments when I feel like you can see me right there.  For today&#39;s practice, I took what you said and definitely let myself stay in the moment rather than adjust.  It felt good and I didn&#39;t have to regain focus as I often do after adjusting myself.  Thank you for bringing awareness to this.",Jaime C,2019-01-06T16:07:45Z,0

"Hi friends! I experienced some anxiety like &quot;WHOA&quot; today.....I felt very disconnected from my body. The breathing always feels good, so I stayed connected and just did what I could. I felt like my left calf wanted to cramp, so I paused and got water. Instantly felt better, but I noticed that if I try to go too fast from forward fold to mountain, my anxiety goes way up, and I feel light-headed. Not a great feeling. So I stayed in mountain, doing the shark fin combo for about 5 more minutes than what was going on in the video until I felt calmer and grounded again. It was interesting, and I&#39;m glad I stuck with myself and the practice, until I felt comfortable to move on to the next flow. Namaste, friends.",Amy Hartsough,2019-01-06T15:15:54Z,0

Stronger, more aware of my breath, more tuned in to how I hold my body throughout the day. And more sure of my own decisions and work during the day. One thing I wanted to share is that sometimes you say to put the rest of the day away and out of your mind. Put the &quot;to do list&quot; away. Funny thing, is that hearing that makes me suddenly remember my &quot;to do list.&quot; May I kindly suggest saying: focus on being right here and right now, not any other moment or place.

"I‚Äôm going to confess here- sometimes I get really frustrated when I can‚Äôt do certain poses? Does anyone else get this? I‚Äôm taking lots from this and have noticed that I rush everything and expect immediate results. The tightness in my hips is insane when I start to breathe deeper, so I‚Äôve been working on my pigeon pose daily too. I also struggle with downward dog. I really love yoga and Adriene especially and notice the benefits when I am running. I am recovering from a hellish cartilage repair and yesterday managed an hour of running for the first time in 2 years. The hills were much easier and I think that‚Äôd because I am breathing a lot better. I guess what I am trying to ask is, is it normal to get frustrated and how do you cope with this?

"Thank you, Adriene, for getting me on the mat every day now. I started doing True yoga with you one year ago, and it really helped both my body and mind. I struggel with fibromyalgia, pelvic pain and neck injury. Then in august, i lost my 33 year old son in a very tragic work accident, and I lost myself completely. No more yoga or taking care of my self. The grief is unbearable. Then I got your mail about Dedicate, and - it took some time...I decided to join you again. My body screams in pain, but I know it will get betterüòâ My mind likes to have something other than grief to concentrate about, it is so good for all of me (or it will be, eventually).<br />So thank you, I&#39;m looking forward to every new day on the mat‚ù§Ô∏è",Linda Gill,2019-01-06T09:23:35Z,41

":) power- and beautiful practice again: after finishing, there came these things my physiotherapist said once about yoga back into my head. she said she wasn&#39;t convinced yoga is fruitful except maybe for the mindfulness aspect. she said if there are tensenesses and knots, yoga will make it worse... until the body is not fully treated and these knots solved. i struggeld with sollving and stopped doing yoga over a year ago. i felt worse and worse... now restart but there is this little bitterness behind. can anybody give advice? thank you and namaste",Nadine R.,2019-01-06T08:40:09Z,0
"Hm, I kinda feel the same. I love doing Yoga and it definitely gave me a better feeling about my mind-body-connection. But I also heard a lot about how it can actually be rather unhealthy.  And since I started doing it every day a year ago, I  have a constant pain in one knee and at the moment an ongoing pain in one wrist. So, I try to really listen to these spots when I practice, leave out certain movements completely or try to do them very mindfully. Still, so far there is no improvement so I am not sure if I should go on... but for the mind it is so good that I return to the mat rvery day.",Christin Ruppio,2019-01-06T10:24:43Z,0
