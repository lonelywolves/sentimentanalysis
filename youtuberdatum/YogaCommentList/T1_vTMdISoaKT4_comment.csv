"I invite you to contemplate what it feels like to be courageous this week, finding ways to carve out the time to show up for yourself and for others, as well as honoring that pause. <br />A pause to sit up tall, to anchor in the breath, a pause that allows you to respond from a true place, rather than just react. <br /><br />The courage to show up. That is where it starts.<br />And it starts with you.<br />And me too. <br />I’ll see you on the mat.",Yoga With Adriene,2020-06-07T12:26:04Z,829
"Not sure if courage is what I need.  I&#39;m physically a wreck, sciatic,and fibromyalgia pain constant 7-10 😪.  Mental status just as bad.  But Adriene always knows what I need so if she says it&#39;s courage,  so be it...something tells me I&#39;m going to cry at some point.",dawnangel1966,2021-04-08T14:57:02Z,0
@nofirstname nolastname hi. Whilst I agree that Adrienne yoga classes are excellent. She is not medically qualified to give you specific classes that will provide the treatment for your back. Have you visited an osteopath or physiotherapist or even your doctor?  Best wishes for a positive outcome. 🙏,78fisguard,2021-04-08T06:01:57Z,0

"I’m a little behind on these for April cause I was traveling and stuff and took a few days off but I woke up and did a sacral chakra meditation today and then decided to do yoga first thing this morning. This is the one that was next for me and you just happened to be wearing orange so I was like cool, still right on track. I started doing this and about halfway through I touched the screen to see how much time was left and there was still about 14 minutes so I debated with myself whether or not I had enough energy yet to finish it or if I wanted to pause it and finish it later cause I was just feeling kinda blah while doing it. Anyways, I ended up pushing through and just doing it till the end and now I feel great. It’s funny what we tell ourselves while in the middle of things even though deep down we know that pushing through is way more rewarding than giving up and picking up where we left off and completing something later. Thanks for being there with me through my internal debates and being consistent even when I’m not. You rock Adrienne.",Hannah Faith,2021-04-23T21:43:38Z,0

"I&#39;ve been feeling a bit off from yoga the last few days... I didn&#39;t skip a day, but I left it for the nighttime, even though I love practicing on the daytime. So, I will practice tomorrow straight after waking up, and I&#39;m sure it will feel sooo good!

"Could really use some encouragement! It was a very difficult practice for me. I was very discouraged tonight. For some reason I struggled with all the poses, even the ones that normally come easy.

"I completely understand how you&#39;re feeling. I&#39;ve had 2 days where fatigue hit me out of the blue &amp; yoga poses that are easy felt like such a strain, workouts that I usually love left me feeling drained &amp; disheartened. I think we often forget that our bodies go through a lot throughout the month. I track those days, make a note &amp; I notice a pattern. I&#39;ve found that very helpful on days when I just can&#39;t understand why I&#39;m feeling that way. Adriene often reminds us to accept where we are in that moment. Don&#39;t be hard on yourself &amp; just listen to your body 🙏🏻",Shelly M,2021-04-09T09:23:30Z,1
@Deb Thank you very much. I didn’t even think of it that way. This week at work was very exhausting both physically and emotionally and that may have carried over to the mat without me even realizing it! Your words really meant a lot and I appreciate you taking the time to share them.,Gabrielle McCourt,2021-04-09T03:57:47Z,0
"Oh, Gabrielle, you are so NOT a failure.  There are days when we are just exhausted, both physically and emotionally.  We might not even allow ourselves to notice how exhausted we are but when we get on the mat our body shows us (sometimes dramatically).  And look at what you did:  you had the courage to allow your feelings of inadequacy to come up and release and to share your experience with us.  Thank you for trusting us when you are feeling tender and vulnerable.  Sending you lots of love and gentleness.  Perhaps when your body and/or mind lets you know it&#39;s exhausted  again, you will be able to say &quot;thank you&quot; to yourself and modify the poses and/or do an alternative pose and/or take breaks, as needed.  Hoping you sleep well tonight.",Deb,2021-04-09T03:50:39Z,2

"Three things struck me from today&#39;s practice- I think I&#39;ve finally said &quot;I am strong&quot; to myself enough times that I&#39;m starting to believe it, I had a realization about the importance of making the practice my own, and the standing half split (or whatever the standing on one leg pose is called) showed me how much progress I&#39;ve made since I started practicing almost a year ago.

Started a daily practice January 2020. One of the BEST decisions of my life.  Just started my seasonal job at a local farm.  Had to pick up raspberry cane pruning&#39;s yesterday.  Lots of bending and stretching and I am NOT sore!!!!  WOOHOO.  YOGA WORKS.  I am 55 and feeling AWESOME.  Lots of love to Adriene and the team and Benji and the community!!!

"The last time this senior yogi did this practice I gave up half way through and thought this is not for me. But I felt sad and defeated. So this time I used my adjustments for my age, knee down in side plank dips, no vinyasas or chaturangas, I just enjoyed peddling it out in downward dog, perfect. This way I could have fun doing the toe taps in plank and say ‘I am strong’  and complete the rest of this sequence breathing deep and slow. This time I came off my mat feeling satisfied, a happy superhero 😃👏👏 we did it Adriene, see you tomorrow on the mat 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💕",Gill Smith,2021-04-08T08:10:39Z,13

"Today was my best yoga day since I began in January this year - I felt complete in myself and most importantly I wasn&#39;t criticising myself for my failures/inabilities - when I wobbled I laughed instead of getting annoyed - for me this is progress towards loving myself more :-) I was able to do many of the forward folds to mountain pose with my eyes closed as my own challenge for today, without losing my balance -- another sign that my daily practice is serving me well &lt;3 tomorrow might be different but this is where I am at today. Enjoy the practice and may you find the courage within you for whatever you need today &lt;3",Helen Stayte,2021-04-08T08:05:31Z,7

"Hi people doing this in april 2021! Back in January I would not  have been able to keep up with this practice at all.

Leah - frustration is my biggest challenge to work through with yoga so I empathise with you; I find that at the start of my practice I set my intent not to get frustrated and this allows me to focus on my breath as well as not worry too much about where I am in relation to Adriene since she is guiding me with my practice and my practice will always be different/unique cos it;s where I&#39;m at...so I hope you find a way to overcome your frustrations &lt;3,Helen Stayte,2021-04-08T07:26:39Z,2

"Hi adriene, just a suggestion for a video: could you do one for athletes right before sports competitions? I am a fencer and travel a lot, and I usually get nervous before tournaments and this would be really helpful. I usually try to do one of your videos before every time I work out (6 days a week) but don’t always get to it. You are so amazing at what you do and thank you for helping me be a better fencer. Hope you are well. ❤️❤️❤️.",Analise McKenna,2021-03-01T15:42:11Z,1

"I&#39;ve been doing at least one of your yoga videos every day for over a month now and I just have to catch you up with the results because I&#39;m so impressed. Bare with me, it&#39;s just going to be a little long but I just really wanted to give back. First, my mental health has dramatically improved : from really blue and lonesome to light and hopeful (especially with alternate nostril breathing and corpse pose), it&#39;s also much easier to welcome emotions in and let them glide by. Then, I used to have a forward head posture but it&#39;s improving day after day. It&#39;s almost imperceptible now. My back feels stronger and because my confidence is improving I don&#39;t feel as icky standing tall and proud. And overall I feels stronger, more flexible, connected with my body and to the world. You know, sometimes the universe reaches out to you, and I&#39;m so grateful I tried. Thank you Adriene, and lots of love out to those of you who have read me :).",Fougère Richard,2021-01-06T17:07:47Z,0

I took a hiatus from yoga and just walk the dogs daily. Tonight I decided to hit the mat. This was a tough session yet I managed to complete every plank without fault. The words “I am strong” were exactly what I needed to hear. I felt like bawling my eyes out. Thank you so much Adriene your words inspire me to be a better me each day.,Jamie L,2020-10-21T02:51:34Z,0

"At the beginning of London&#39;s Covid-19 Lockdown in March I started your 30 day practices to give me something to do. I never knew the impact your yoga practices would have on me. I now feel that I am more sure of myself than ever before, I have grown stronger not just physically but most importantly spiritually, and nearly every single day I now find myself looking forward to my time on the mat with you.<br /><br />Today I found out that I am facing redundancy from a job I adore in a time which is uncertain and unsettling. If I hadn&#39;t been doing yoga with you for the past few months I know I would be in pieces today. I thank you for the time and love you spend on these practices, I feel courageous and ready to ride the waves of life.<br /><br />Namaste and thank you again Adriene! Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll train to be a yoga teacher one day! &lt;3",Eve Scott,2020-10-15T17:58:17Z,0

"Many times some of Adriene&#39;s videos trigger the feels, but this one really got to me. Having the courage to show up is not just applicable to daily practice of yoga... it&#39;s a daily practice to show up for others, to show up for yourself, to be the best version of yourself that you can be.. and sometime&#39;s thats very hard! Especially in recent times.

"I remember this pratcise from June when the word &quot;Courage&quot; was highlight. First of all, I hated this class because it was challenging myself and perhaps I was afraid. Since the last few month, I try to demonstrate courage towards myself and the world in with we live longer and longer each day. So I&#39;m very glad to practise again this class this month and I do not hesitate to do it once more if I need. Thanks you Adriene for your work, love and kindness !",Eloise Trehin,2020-10-08T17:46:36Z,1
Following along the October playlist. I don&#39;t comment a lot on Youtube but each video has been so time-sensitive to me right now. I need courage for this weekend as I am going to empty my belongings from a flat I shared with my boyfriend for two years. I fled quickly after our 4 year relationship broke down - it has been 6 weeks now and I hope I have the courage to face our memories and untangle myself from it all. I hope for the courage to accept the emotions that arise and know I can make it through the other side. I hope for the courage to know that this is a necessary step for closure. That we are both brave enough to follow our own paths. I am strong.,bee-bee-bur,2020-10-08T17:21:32Z,2

My ex form a 10-year relationship called me this week to tell me how he slept with another girl. It has been 5 months since we broke up and I thought I was getting over it but now every time I close my eyes all I see is them together and it makes me sick. I started to feel guilty again and not strong enough to continue my journey of moving on but here&#39;s to the courage of taking a step at a time - courage to heal.,Marion M,2020-10-08T19:25:25Z,0

"Wasn&#39;t excited to see yoga for courage today. :/ I know I need courage, but it  kinda looked like it would be a grueling class (my energy level wasn&#39;t matching with the name of the class) Hopped on the mat and did it anyway. Once I twice I went to plank on my knees, but did ok after. Had a great savasana afterwards.

"Showed up on day 7 of Adriene’s calendar even though I skipped some of the previous days. It’s trying to build a good working relationship with your body after decades of neglect and even “not liking” the body. Having these feelings arise during yoga - especially during practice with Adriene - has made me realize it wasn’t meant to be like that. Befriending your body in middle age is an awkward experience, but just like electricity and technology, there’s no going back.",Daily Artonaut,2020-10-08T09:12:08Z,34

You make yoga seem light and funny and are able to transfer the sense behind it into our worlds. Also thanks for not showing off your flexibility and making us feel like stiff little knobs. 😊<br />There is just one thing I would like to leave as a wish for future sessions. When I do read &quot;Yoga for...&quot; like this time for courage I would love to get some more thematic connection between the headline and the actual practise. I missed that more and more in your vids lately. I know you can do it, you did it in the past. Like a themed inspiring intro and references throughout the session.

"Hi Rai just one thing to add to the great advice you&#39;ve already had - if you haven&#39;t done it already I&#39;d highly recommend doing one of Adriene&#39;s 30 day January challenges. They&#39;re very incremental and perfect for people who are newer to the practice. I did it this year and it&#39;s been a game changer for me and made practices like this so much more accessible. Even though I&#39;m quite experienced now, my breath is often out of sync with Adriene&#39;s but I try to settle into a version that works for me. I also will sometimes just stop and watch the video if it&#39;s a tricky pose or I&#39;m just not feeling it. I jump back in when I&#39;m ready. I find Adriene&#39;s mantra of find what feels good: in FWFG world there is no fail :)",Kerry Gray,2021-04-08T12:55:58Z,1
just breathe on your own time in between Adrienes cues.  just always breathe!!  if youre ready to come out of a pose just do it! you can always rest til the next one (keep breathing) or you can try to come back to the pose after a break.  Like Adriene says: just be proud that you showed up :-D,Michie C,2020-12-14T20:13:38Z,6

"Hi Adriene, I&#39;m practicing with you since four years now, you bring yoga into my house and I appreciate your work very much, so I feel free to leave some critical comment: sometimes I feel like you&#39;re rushing a bit much, I mean you are saying &quot;take your time&quot; and my body feels like: &quot;Oh yes, I&#39;m doing it slow and fun&quot; but in the following second you&#39;re already doing the transition to the next position. I understand your intention to get us into flowing but it would be great to give us a but more space, espacially than when you&#39;re saying &quot;take your time&quot; - maybe it&#39;s just hard for me to be 100% in my awareness while trying to flow with you, maybe it&#39;s me who is a bit slow and who is always rushing and in need of huge calmness but there are so many moments where I wish I could stop the video for a sec to take one more breath or to the the transition properly and then continue with flowing with you.

As someone living with PTSD, you’ve made my life something I can face and have helped me recover so much over the years.

"Breath is the core of yoga and its usually not in these videos. You can say &quot;inhale, exhale&quot; but if the timing is way off (like when the teacher starts chatting in the middle of a pose) it doesnt do much. There is also a wide audience watching these videos so modifications, when they are even mentioned, cant be an after thought like they are on this channel. And it isnt enough to just say &quot;if this doesnt feel good, please do a modified pose&quot; but then leave people hanging. For a truly inclusive practice the modification should be mentioned right away and shown as well.",Björg Hákonardóttir,2020-07-01T08:59:27Z,0

Its so habitual to do for others ALL the time and in EVERY way imaginable, but to stop and tell them no, so that I have the time to choose myself is HARD.

"This was lovely Adriene 💛 I was wondering, I’m in pelvic floor therapy because my PF is really really tight. I’m working on trying to relax them, so I can’t do planks or really any variation. Are there any moves I can do in substitution that don’t activate the pelvic floor? Thanks for all you do!",Jessika Jones,2020-06-20T15:50:19Z,0

"Dear Adriene,<br />This is my love letter for you!<br />The sentence when the student is ready the teacher will appear is amazingly factual. I had a burnt out years ago and yoga saved me. After few events I saw myself living in London and no access to a yoga practice that would touch my soul for the pass 4 years. Now during lockdown a friend recommended me your classes i was pretty skeptical (yoga online, what?!) but i wouls give it a go since it was a good friend of mine who had this suggestion. and I was “hooked” immediately. These classes mean a lot to me! I have been doing yoga every single day since March. It has helped me to find my way to myself again! If you ever feel tired or a bit sad (hey! We are all humans here) remember you have done remarkable work for some of us and for that as our teacher you will always be connected to us and you can count with our appreciation and energy towards you!",Gabriela Ramirez,2020-06-20T09:35:16Z,0

"Hi Adriene: I&#39;m writing this after reading your latest &quot;lntent Into Impact&quot; email. I was taken aback by your ask: &quot;...please do not come at me wishing for a full paper on injustice, on cultural appropriation, on silence, or apathy tomorrow. I am lovingly, politely setting a boundary.&quot;  I&#39;ve been practicing with you for years. I respect and appreciate you. I support folks setting boundaries. AND I wanted to share that your message comes across as defensive. With great power (i.e. a platform of over 7 million ) comes great responsibility. Many of the folks and orgs I follow have issued statements of solidarity with Black Lives Matter, Movement for Black Lives and calls to defund the police, including links to support local or national work. As someone who regularly reads your email letters, I was surprised that you did not express solidarity or include links to support racial justice work. I&#39;m also surprised that you haven&#39;t had a live yoga practice fundraiser for the Movement for Black Lives and/or local Texas orgs working to divest from the police and invest in mental health and low-income housing (i.e. Communities of Color United). We are all on our own journey when it comes to better understanding our own privilege and complicity, and I&#39;ve been reminded again and again that it requires a lifelong commitment. I hope you are taking good care of yourself and when you are able to get back to the individual and collective work of antiracism, that you seek out the teachings of Black women. Sending you love and support.",llamb14,2020-06-15T01:43:22Z,2

"Every new year for the past several years, I make a resolution that I want to exercise more. My biggest problem why this never worked out was that I was not able to motivate myself and always had a thousand excuses not to. I would have times of extreme motivation and go way overboard and then have very long phases in between where I didn&#39;t feel motivated at all. For me, the problem with exercising was that I only enjoyed it when I didn&#39;t feel like I was doing it. Two years ago, I discovered Adriene&#39;s yoga videos after several friends told me that I should really have a go at them because they &quot;aren&#39;t like other videos&quot;. I always hated going to sports classes cause I always felt embarrassed and was concerned what others might think of me and i could never find the motivation to actually go to the classes in the first place. On top of that, I always felt like it was a waste of money since I would end up not going anyway. So, having access to these classes at home where nobody could see me, right in my living room so that I wouldn&#39;t have to go anywhere, and for free, basically didn&#39;t allow for any excuses not to do them. I started off with Adriene&#39;s 30 days of yoga - and after the first few sessions I already had a moment of &quot;hey, I can actually do this!&quot; I finished the 30 days in just under three months but then I go injured at work and could not do yoga for a while - or so I thought. At that point, I was just using it to do a bit of exercise every day and would skip over the meditation parts. After the injury, I had a difficult time getting back into it. However, at the beginning of this year, I challenged myself to do yoga every single day - and here I am, half way through this crazy year, and I have done it! As Adriene always says, &quot;the biggest challenge is arriving on the mat&quot; - and it&#39;s so true! but if you look at it differently, it is really not that challenging. I told myself, even if it means just sitting on my mat and breathing for 5 min, it&#39;s ok! I don&#39;t have to exercise every time! And who doesn&#39;t have 5 min to sit down and take some time for themselves and actually &quot;find what feels good&quot;? And often times, when I made it onto the mat and just sat there, my motivation would actually come to me and I would end up doing a full yoga session - or even two. Since the beginning of the year, I have completed the &quot;yoga camp&quot;, &quot;yoga revolution&quot;, &quot;true&quot;, &quot;dedicate&quot;, and &quot;home&quot;  videos. Not only have I managed to build my core muscles and get stronger and waaaay more flexible, I am also happier, feel more motivated, more focused, and have more confidence. While I always dreaded the 30th day of the yoga series because they were &quot;freestyle&quot; and I tried to hurry along with Adriene and constantly twisting around to stare at the screen because she wasn&#39;t talking, I have now finally found my own - &quot;listening to my body&quot;. Funny enough, when I go freestyle and have Adriene&#39;s videos on in the background and I sometimes curiously peek at the screen, I see that she is doing the same thing as me. And sometimes I can hear her say quirky things in my head (&quot;heyyyooo&quot;) or when I fall, I hear her go &quot;it&#39;s ok if you fall, we&#39;ll catch ya&quot;. I just love how she doesn&#39;t show off what she is capable of doing and gives us &quot;yogi choices&quot; and is just a massive goof ball at times. Adriene, a HUGE thank you to you for changing my life! Thank you for being yourself and for being human (and for Benji being dog :P). You make yoga fun! These days, getting on my mat, is my favorite part of the day - and that&#39;s all thanks to you! NAMASTE &lt;3<br />And by the way - I suddenly have a creaky old floor, too :D",NEINNINA90,2020-06-12T19:16:02Z,0

"This has helped me so much, thank you. I have been struggling with pain in my lower back, so sometimes I have had to modify things, for example, the supine twist, which makes me a bit sad as I know I can&#39;t get the full benefits of it. I had a strange epiphany during this practice that maybe my lower back problems aren&#39;t just an effect of being more stationary and having to sit down a lot whilst working at home (due to quarantine) but has also come about because of some emotional issues. That because I had always considered myself a strong and courageous person, recently, when I felt tired and weak, I was dumping too much weight into my lower spine, because I was relying on what I thought was some inner core strength to hold me up. Other areas of my body have been neglected, my arms, my neck, my thighs, and I forgot that I had all these other things to support me. It takes courage to use all these other things you have access to, that is real courage. This practice made me realise that. Thank you.",Rebecca María,2020-06-12T13:18:46Z,0

"Dear Ms.Adriene, my name is Arshia and I&#39;m 13 years old. as you have probably heard, many students like myself are now doing online school on our computers in our homes since school is closed right now. I have found myself staying inside everyday and spending my whole day on schoolwork. During this time, my back gets really soar and I really do not want to get an arch in my back. To counteract this, I have started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago from the yoga videos you have on your channel. I never thought I would like yoga so much, but your channel has really gotten me into it. Although your yoga videos have super duper helped me,  I feel like I could really use something focused on specifically building posture. If you would be so kind to make a video focused on trying to build posture and stretch out neck muscles then I will be forever grateful.  Overall, I would be extremely happy if you accept my request because it would help me (and many other people) very much.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />    Arshia",Arshia Ghandehari,2020-06-10T21:52:24Z,0

"Adrienne, thank you for this practice, it’s my favorite so far. Courage is exactly what people need right now and you have an amazing gift to guide others to its source within us. I think this gift is needed and would be so powerful in the context of what is happening in the world. I know your channel is just for yoga, but I also know that yoga has always been intertwined with and relevant to the social and political world. I’m thinking of Swami Ramdev, who sees yoga as the answer to the suffering of not only the individual but also the nation and all of humanity, who used his influence as a guru to call for the restoration of the Ganges river and to fight political corruption in India. Like Ramdev, you make your teachings accessible to everyone and the comments on this video alone show your profound ability to awaken, heal and empower people from all walks of life through yoga. I can’t help but imagine the power this gift could have, combined with your millions of open-hearted followers, when applied to activism. So many people are waking up right now and joining the fight and I want to call on you to use your gift and your platform to say that Black Lives Matter and tell us how we can participate in the pursuit of justice. <br />Love,<br />Maija<br />“Can the entire world population join hands and walk on this path towards world peace? What is this magic solution that will protect each one’s national pride, religious belief and is free from any selfish interest or greed? What is this magical word that promises individual’s joy, peace and prosperity in their personal lives and shows them a path to world peace that they can adopt fearlessly? The word is Yog.”<br />—Swami Ramdev",Maija Harvey,2020-06-09T17:45:01Z,1

"Thank you Adriene! I’ve been doing this only for a week and it still feels weird at the end. At first glance it seems like I feel sad but that’s not it. Normally have so much tension, guilt, anxiety. After every session feeling light and unchained to my thoughts: It’s really just a completely new feeling in itself!<br /><br />Recently I had destroyed something beautiful. I was putting all my focus on the idea of enjoyment of a future goal that I went years slowly getting more bitter and not enjoying a second of the now. Feeling guilty and negative about the past I wanted to try something new. I wanted something active and I always wanted to be flexible, so I decided Yoga. Even if it was a “scam” my main goal was flexibility so the self love aspects would just be a side extra. There really is something to this though, I’m still working on nights but ever since my first day I have managed to not get down in my head at random and it’s so amazing. Thank you so much it means the world to me 💫 I feel like I’m finally learning how to enjoy the little things",Unknown Reality,2020-06-09T16:01:15Z,0

When I saw that this practice was about courage, I was excited to do this in honor of all of the young people who have the courage to protest and highlight injustice and brutality against black and brown people.

I’m still very sore from yesterday’s total body workout that I couldn’t get through this video today. I’m a little disappointed but my body needs to heal so I’ll do a more gentle practice today. Yesterday was tough. I was able to do the exercises but my stamina was running out fast so I had to take breaks. I’m definitely going to revisit that one. Knowing this calendar is focused on Courage makes sense now. Doing these specific videos is much easier than returning to them.,St. Jerome,2020-06-08T09:37:24Z,0

"Thank you so very much Adriene for all the practices! They helped me so much already. You give so much and you made me love yoga. I love doing yoga when I&#39;m in a good mood, but the last month I noticed how much yoga (and you) can help improve my mood, how good it is for my soul. Today is not a good day, but I thought with a practice called &quot;courage&quot;, I could do nothing wrong. And indeed, I&#39;m feeling so much better right now. Of course nothing dramatically changed in those 27 minutes, but it gave me the courage to continue my day, to try to focus on the good things and to allow me to be at peace. I choose to be at peace and to act as if it were already so. Thank so much. You are awesome. Lots of love from Belgium.",Julie Piette,2020-06-08T07:52:58Z,0

Due to some physical problems I&#39;ve been out of practice. I took up the mantle today but the courage was not so much in starting but in modifying when my body said &quot;gently&quot; and having the bravery to listen and not judge harshly.

I was so cranky, so insistent that I couldn&#39;t manage the next pose, so discouraged despite Adriene&#39;s gentle encouragement. I slunked my way to the end of it and didn&#39;t feel the same calm I usually do when I hear the outro music. I guess it was just one of those days. I was so afraid to come back today, thinking it would be a repeat of last night...but I&#39;m here. I did it, I feel good about the effort I put in, and that calm has returned.

"Hello Adriene. I just wanted to thank you for saving my life last week, and I don&#39;t mean metaphorically. You might not have the time to read my story, but I feel the urge to tell it.<br />Last week I was carrying a heavy duvet down the stairs when my foot slipped off the step. I must have subconsciously protected my tailbone (I had broken it a year before), because instead of falling on my butt, I started tumbling down. I was trying to figure out a way to stop, but the handrail was out of reach and my limbs were tangled in the duvet. Worst of all, my weight shifted and now I was tumbling heads-down. I saw the bottom of the staircase closing in on my face and I remember thinking I would break my neck, but instead I sommersaulted over my shoulder and landed softly on my buttocks, my legs crossed. I sat for a moment trying to comprehend what had happened. And then I realised. My brain couldn&#39;t find a solution, so it bowed (quite literally, because I tucked my chin to my chest) to my body intelligence and let it do the work.<br />Within a year, I have come from a woman who breaks her tailbone from falling on her butt while learning to rollerblade (which was actually what got me into yoga - gentle yoga was the only exercise I could do after the accident) to one who falls down the stairs straight on her neck and ends up with just a small bruise on her upper arm. If that&#39;s not a testimony to the miraculous effects of yoga, I don&#39;t know what is! Thank you, Adriene!",Stormchantress,2020-06-08T02:56:26Z,8
"I had a minor diverticulitis flare up today.  I almost missed my daily yoga, but I decided to give it a try and see if I could work through it.  This was the first time today I felt pain free.

"After a few days of not being consistent with my practice I decided to commit to the June calendar and get to my mat every day this month. The first ones I found challenging given that I was not feeling very patient and sometimes my body needs time to adapt to feel stronger and more open. I continued on this first week knowing that sometimes it takes time, and that joy does come if your brave enough to wait for it. Today I got to my mat anticipating this practice and enjoying it to the fullest. The best moments of yoga come when you least expect it, but they come.",Martina Cardenas,2020-06-08T00:55:09Z,0

"Alright, so I have to share this. I felt down for a loooong time and yoga has helped immensely in the past year (when it found me). This year I felt like I was getting away from myself and yoga was going with it. The fear of being somehow weaker or worse is here, I will not lie, but boy oh boy this practice was special!<br />I usually like doing yoga in the mornig or at most afternoon because of the energy of the sun and all, but tonight as I was about to shower and not having done anything my mind just could not resist and it&#39;s two in the morning and I&#39;ve gotta say doing this before bed? Not as bad as I thought. Maybe I do both.<br />Thank you Adriene.<br />Much love :)",Maísa Penetra,2020-06-07T22:59:01Z,0

"There are so many different ways of showing courage. There is the courage to show up and the courage to leave. I think what courage is  is taking action even when fear is crippling you. Adriene always says &quot;shine light in the dark places&quot;.That takes courage, but look what happens to darkness when the lighted gaze is turned upon it. We can do this.",kris law,2020-06-07T20:47:39Z,0

"Thank you for the practice &lt;3 Sincerely.<br />I have a question for you. Why did you not explicitly acknowledge current events?<br />You have an audience of over 7.5 million. Your voice has a powerful impact.<br />Our nation is protesting in the streets in support of black and brown lives. Innocent people die all the time due to fear, and racial bias. Our police are currently at war with their own citizens (the very citizens they are supposed to serve and protect). Do you have an opinion about this?<br />People listen to you. this platform that you have has the potential to start a conversation. You could quite literally help change the world.<br />I understand that you may be scared to speak up. Maybe you are afraid to say the wrong thing. Maybe you are still working to understand how you feel about all of this. <br />That is ok. I believe it is 100% ok to let people know that you do not have it figured out.<br />It is ok to be scared. This is not supposed to be comfortable. <br />Watching this video, I can sense some heaviness in you... I feel it too. We all feel it.  <br />I challenge you to meditate on this.<br />The theme of this class is &quot;Courage&quot;.<br />Do you have the courage to stand up for what you believe in?<br />* I do not mean to put you on trial. None of this is &quot;easy&quot;.<br />With love,<br />BLACK LIVES MATTER",zoomakroom,2020-06-07T20:16:30Z,0

"Thank you for marching and for sharing with us, Laure.  It is a time of great hope and great sadness, frustration and anger.  My daughter and granddaughter (5 years old) went to a march in NYC today.  My granddaughter made her own sign &quot;Peace and love to everyone!&quot;  Great hope.  My granddaughter was frightened (she is highly sensitive) by both the size of the crowd and the loud angry voices.  Reflecting the great sadness of all of the children who are frightened every day when they do simple things like walk to school.  Our time together in yoga and in meditation allows us to grow in being able to &quot;hold all of life in our hearts&quot; and offer that steadfast courage, openness and commitment to others as we work together to birth a new world.  One step, one breath, one heartbeat at a time.  All love.",Deb,2020-06-07T19:48:23Z,5

Day 72 of Yoga With Adriene//Day 7 of Courage 2020 -- Today was a beautiful Sunny and 75 where I live and I decided to use this opportunity to take my practice outside. It was a wonderful choice on my part. There is something so wonderful about practicing with the natural breeze and sounds of nature around me. It was a beautiful derivation from my usual routine.

"Love this and appreciate your work! But a little confused by your letter this week - the reiteration of the importance of speaking clearly felt undermined by a lot of subtle suggestions, but no “clear” statement, in support of the anti-racist movement, protests against police brutality or mourning of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor or the many other people who have been killed by police. As you said, it can be uncomfortable to be vulnerable, but you have such an amazing platform and you almost said it - but not clearly enough. And I’m sure many people may think this is too much to ask or appreciate that you keep your politics to yourself, but what I see is that you preach your values with everything you do - the dignity of human life is central to what you teach. Breathing is a right, but a man was suffocated by police (and not just this once, many others). Admitting that there is a broken system that is not valuing human life is not out of line with what you say in all of your work - it would just be more clear. The system is not working - I would be surprised to hear a chicago police officer (or minneapolis, nypd, etc) say “everything is great! I love how my relationship with the community is!” If you’ve heard such a thing, ask that they be clearer about who counts as “their community.” <br />I think it would be really impactful if you used your platform to more clearly support anti-racism and actively work against racism. And if you lose some followers...you’ll survive.",Maire O'Neill,2020-06-07T16:56:43Z,0

I couldn&#39;t help but want to continue, so this really couldn&#39;t have come at a better time.<br /><br />Thank you so much for what you do. I&#39;ve been fighting a lot for courage - the courage to show up for myself, to recognise how far I&#39;ve come and how much I&#39;ve grown as a human being. Throughout the entire practice I felt surprisingly strong, and upon closer inspection, I realised that I <b>am</b> strong. You&#39;ve shown me the breathing of a lion. You&#39;ve shown me how to take flight without fear. You&#39;ve shown me strength, and you&#39;ve shown me peace. All of these things you&#39;ve taught me to embody within myself through the yoga practice. <br /><br />I just wanted to say how grateful I am for your guidance, your kindness, your humour, and your daily reminders to us that we already have what we need within ourselves. Thank you so much.<br /><br />P.s. Please give Benji lots and lots of love. I always love it when I hear his small sighs and the click-clacks of his paws against the wooden floor, and I&#39;m sure others do as well :)",Akapine006,2020-06-07T12:43:29Z,51

You have one or two videos on it but not that much, and i LOVE your 30 day routines, im now on my third one, but they obviously have a bunch of inverted poses like down dog and forward folds. Any possibility you could maybe make a playlist with the vids that dont contain inverted poses, or even make new videos on gut health with acid reflux?<br />Thanks for all youre doing &lt;3",Ruby,2020-06-07T10:33:27Z,7

I always hated meditation and used to skip that part of practice but in May you managed to sit me through it and I actually enjoyed it and benefited from it ! It&#39;s been 1 hell of a year and still going, but no matter the situation I can hear your voice and guidance in my head, telling me I am strong, I am in charge of my own emotions and more importantly : power of the breath.

I have also just lost all the structure I usually have as I have finished my end of year exam and now have 3  months ahead of me with little direction. I am also at the crossroads in a relationship that I know has been failing for many months but I need strength and clarity to be able to take the next steps with confidence and love. I am excited to do this flow today and look forward to the power of it and how I will feel afterwards.

Quite a challenging week ahead but I need to face it with calm and grace not opt for the gentle practices, which I have done in the past. Hope the wind didn&#39;t do too much harm in your garden.

In one week, I&#39;ll end my PhD. Like, wtf is going on in june ? And now, as I read &quot;courage&quot;, I think about you and how you helped me five years ago. And now, you&#39;re helping me more and more, always. This week has been so hard and so strange. But you&#39;re here and in every video I do, I feel at home. Strong and vulnerable at the same time.

"Adrienne, I love you so much and am forever grateful for all that you do. I&#39;ve been practicing with you from my home for years, and got my mom obsessed with yoga through your videos- we do them together when we can. I subscribe to your news letter and your thoughtfulness and wisdom have gotten me through some hard times. However... I feel that sending a link to a breath focused courage practice is a bit thoughtless and perhaps even irresponsible during this particular week in our nation&#39;s timeline. I know that you know what&#39;s going on, and a lot of people are looking to you when their souls are searching and wounded. It&#39;s not your job to heal those wounds, but you have a platform to speak to countless human beings on the earth right now, and to not acknowledge the turmoil and in fact to ask people to focus on the breath that is denied to their brothers and sisters is a hard thing  for me to see right now. Again, I love you and you&#39;re amazing. I know things are hard right now. But they won&#39;t get better if we don&#39;t acknowledge what&#39;s wrong and stand shoulder to shoulder to fight.",Marisa Scott,2020-06-07T06:29:11Z,2
"Hi Marisa, Adriene is constantly talking about what&#39;s happening on her Instagram and also sent an email last Sunday to all of us who are subscribed to her Sunday letters, only talking about what&#39;s happening.

"Yoga is a Sanskrit word that, in English, roughly translates into “union”. What is demonstrated here is Hatha yoga, the strechy one. Others include kundalini yoga, which focuses on opening the chakras, the seven energy centers of the human body, and tantra yoga, the sexy one, but there are several hundred others. It’s worth studying as many as you can embrace,:)",Jason Bean,2020-06-07T05:53:43Z,0

"Dear Adriene and to whom this may concern as well,<br />I absolutely love your videos and yoga as a practise has many benefits for me. However I haven&#39;t been on the mat for months, although I plan to do so over and over again. I think I have just become really scared of yoga which keeps from actually doing it which is sad because I used to do it every other day. I am unsure what I am so afraid of though. Maybe it&#39;s being confronted with my own body (I am recovering from an Eatingn Disorder after all and keep gaining weight - which wouldn&#39;t bother me with anyone else but me) and my own failure and inability to do certain exercises? In short: being confronted with myself.<br />I have no idea how to deal with this and it feels like I&#39;m missing out on so much because of it. Has anyone experienced this before and has any advice?<br />Love, Sev",Severn Fox,2020-06-07T05:48:49Z,1
@Karen thank you so much for your kind words :) I&#39;ll definitely try to be more compassionate and take smaller steps!,Severn Fox,2020-06-07T06:58:13Z,0
"Hi Sev,  thank you for your question and honesty. <br />It got me thinking about my relationship with myself, which is never a bad thing to review so thank you. I know that fear of being confronted with yourself (myself) and your own (my own) emotions, and even though for me working through it makes me feel more centered and more chill with myself, it is an ongoing process. Which means that some days, weeks or months even are better than others, some are harder. And that’s okay, it’s part of being alive. We can always find our way back, and it sounds like you’re well on your way. I encourage you to ask yourself wit love and compassion “What does my body/soul need today, what do I need today and how can I tend to it?” Those questions usually help me.<br />For getting back to yoga; maybe start out small, like a 5 minute yoga quickie? Or maybe a forward fold in the shower, or just making a nice cup of tea? Maybe practice with a loved one, or scroll through Adriene’s videos until you find one that makes you feel like “maybe I can do this”? Can you find what you need, what feels good? If you’re anything like me, here’s a friendly reminder that it does not have to be big or revelutionary 😉 just baby steps are perfectly good.<br />You’ve got this dear Sev!<br />Love, Karen",Karen,2020-06-07T06:29:43Z,1

Yoohoo!!! It is finally here. So fired up to have Adriene back in what looks to be an encouraging new practice. Thank you for reminding me that life is beautiful and should be lived to the fullest.

"How did you know, Adriene. I yesterday decided to listen to what Universe was telling me and to give up trying to get home to Canada and to stay in Bangkok instead. It&#39;s exciting, but it&#39;s also scary. This will be just the thing!",TheseBoots.net,2020-06-07T05:08:51Z,0

Ah bugger I’m in New Zealand and following the ymacourage month of June and couldn’t find this one in particular so I completed ‘balancing ocean flow’ but I’m guessing it must be a time zone thing and didn’t come live until Texas rolled over to 7th June?,Amelia Clayton,2020-06-07T05:07:08Z,2
"Yoga With Adriene riiiiight, makes sense .... appreciate you letting me know. Love your work girl, I sing your praise wherever I go 🤘🧘‍♀️",Amelia Clayton,2020-06-10T09:40:42Z,0
"Hi Amelia! Yes, the new videos are released at midnight Texas time. x",Yoga With Adriene,2020-06-07T13:29:08Z,2
"Thanks , I’ll look out for that in future. I’m trying to be strict and not stray from the schedule otherwise I might be tempted by a shorter version 🤘🧘‍♀️",Amelia Clayton,2020-06-07T09:33:13Z,0
"Amelia, even here in the Netherlands, a lousy six hours or so ahead, that can be a thing. To be honest, I quite often swap the practices around on the sheet depending on how my day goes and a longer or shorter practice is a better fit. And in the longer programs with all new practices I just run a day behind from the start.",Doorle Offerhaus,2020-06-07T05:33:00Z,2

"I feel you, sometimes I find myself doing yoga at 12 am and I wonder who else on earth is doing the same practice at the same time with me.
