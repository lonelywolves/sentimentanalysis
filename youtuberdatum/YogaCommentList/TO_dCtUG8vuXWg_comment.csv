Hi just did this practice after carpel tunnel operation last week due to have stitches out tomorrow and it really loosened up my wrist I just skipped the downward dog bit but I&#39;m sure Abit of yoga everyday will help with recovery. I wished I had started yoga years ago maybe I could have avoided the op. Thank u Adrienne,Josep Ropero,2019-11-13T20:49:37Z,0
My god this video was so helpful! Till now I just had to struggle to keep my hands from slipping in the downward dog position. For the first time after so many days I did not lose my balance at all! Thank you so much,Team Iron Man,2021-05-07T07:32:08Z,0

"I was able to rotate the palms as she said, but I found myself struggling with shifting my weight away from my wrists. Even when I&#39;m actively trying to move the weight to my fingers and knuckles and the thumb joint, it still feels like all the weight is on my wrists. Anyway, happy to improve my form the way I did. I did Breath late and I&#39;m doing Bridge late, but by now I&#39;ve been doing this daily for over a month, and I&#39;m glad.",Jesse Genao,2021-02-25T14:28:12Z,0

"It was a short video to give some more understanding about the way we use our hands in asana poses. Especially when we do the poses that need different weight placements, to lower the pressure to the wrist it&#39;s better to spread the weight of the body to the palms and the fingers.",Pooya Valinataj,2021-02-05T07:36:23Z,0

I have a question because it seems that my wrists (especially my right wrist) hurt no matter what I do. With this video they hurt less but still did.

"Here for Bridge with all of you wonderful folks. I don&#39;t know about you, but I was blown away by the difference it made to place my hands differently for down dog! 🤯 I wish I had known this sooner. What a fabulous practice today to set things right. 😊 It&#39;s interesting to bring focus to the feel of things rather than the shape prescribed. I notice that with my body shape certain things just look different because I can&#39;t make it fit the mold. I have short arms and legs, a long torso, and a long neck. This practice inspires me to explore and make little tweeks here and there to make poses work better for my body type. 😊",Jessica Steinman,2021-02-05T03:21:56Z,0

"This whole time i&#39;ve been doing the downward dog the wrong way and I sometimes find it uncomfortable being at that pose and so much pressure. And OMG now I know why its because of the positioning of my wrist! It is so crazy how one action and one movement could change the whole posture and change the feeling into ease and comfort. This is incredible, now I know why and its so good to know. Now downward dog is one of my favorite postures. Thank you Adriene! This bridge calender is teaching me so much and i am glad i signed up for this. Namaste everybody &lt;3",Sarah A,2021-02-05T00:13:11Z,2
"I almost skipped today’s practice to take a break because my elbows and surrounding area have been experiencing pain.  But then I looked at the calendar and thought this might be just what I need.  I definitely felt a shift in downward dog with that slight adjustment.  I hope it helps in the long run because I don’t want to stop doing these practices!  They help in so many ways.

The best part of downward dog for me is the back stretch and I never would have thought that paying closer attention to my hands could deepen the back stretch but it really, really did!

That first downward dog with the new hand position was a total “aha!” Moment! Looking forward to incorporating it.,Lana Dominguez,2021-02-04T13:38:43Z,31
"Bridge Day 4. 123 days of YWA and twice today! I went ahead and did the dolphin foundation video Adriene mentioned on day one. Tomorrow, I will check out Downward Dog in the morning.<br /><br />For six and a half minutes I thought I might get away with practicing on my bed. Nope. Get to the mat which I had already laid out. Glad I did. Not sure if anyone else felt it but energy felt strong in the solar plexus while working with the hands, especially when making a conscious effort to reconnect between the index finger and thumb. Also, with palms out, forward and upside down. Quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Let&#39;s keep going 2021 Breath to Bridge family! 💜🙏",William B,2021-02-04T13:37:44Z,0
I&#39;m here to do Bridge! Just one day behind.  Just love this practice and the fact that I am following through! no excuses (today ha ha) Thank you Adriene for putting these monthly works of art together for us! Sending Love to all. ~namaste xoxo,A Lochetto,2021-02-04T13:31:29Z,0
"I&#39;ve always found that when I&#39;m in tabletop or downward dog, my pinkies don&#39;t straighten and it actually hurts a bit to try and flatten them, but I can hold them straight if they aren&#39;t bearing weight. ??? Any tips?",Kristin Stitt,2021-02-04T12:51:08Z,0

Hi everyone!! Who is loving BRIDGE so far?? Question - did anyone else combine this video with another one of Adriene&#39;s practices? I&#39;m looking forward to this one but my body is also craving a nice stretch today... any suggestions? :),Amber Farrington,2021-02-04T12:10:43Z,1

"I am always resistant to the videos in the monthly calendar because they aren&#39;t what I think I need. They aren&#39;t a flow, or a strength practice. I&#39;ve committed to following the calendars this year (2021) and this video is a great example of why. When I saw the name of this video, I thought - I don&#39;t need a video just for my hands. I&#39;m more advanced than that. Oh boy, was I wrong! Obviously, my hands and my wrists are neglected. I really enjoyed this video and I&#39;m inspired to keep learning and keep questioning whether what I THINK I need is what I ACTUALLY need.",hannahgleone,2021-02-04T12:02:59Z,1

"I always forget to show some love and awareness to my hands and wrists, which is funny given that I often can experience some soreness in the tops of my hands.

"Just did this as my Feb 2021 calendar practice and I really needed this caring hands practice and Adriene is so right. When I first began my practice I had a hard time with my wrists and I had to take breaks often but I always kept listening to the cues ADRIENE gives and regular practice really helps in relieving wrist pain and strengthening this area. I’m so glad I’m doing this, showing up for me and getting better in my yoga practice both on and off the mat. As always, so grateful for your advice and guidance ❤️",Tasneem Siahiwala,2021-02-04T08:16:12Z,37

I did the yoga for the hands and wrists video first and then this straight afterwards. I usually put a Mariah Carey song on very quietly in the background when I&#39;m doing these videos cuz she has a very soothing voice. I felt a great wave of relief wash over me as soon as the videos were finished. I feel positive thoughts come in and out of my mind during the videos. I&#39;ve been suffering from a lot of anxiety and I&#39;m surprised at how much yoga with your videos has helped. I follow zumba gold videos in the morning and then do yoga in the afternoon and evening. They both work very well together that way.,Sana Xx,2020-05-23T19:04:55Z,0

"Juliet:<br />&quot;Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,<br />Which mannerly devotion shows in this;<br />For saints have hands that pilgrims&#39; hands do touch,<br />And palm to palm is holy palmers&#39; kiss.&quot;  __Shakespeare&#39;s Romeo and Juliet, my favorite unit to teach!<br /><br />In regards to the wrist/hands, I was never taught proper hand placement in any of the yoga classes, so thank you for this.  I have been much more conscious of the correct position and working to take the weight off my wrist.  I do have carpal tunnel in both wrist and osteoarthritis, and it just seems like it never gets easier.  A bit frustrating, but LOVE the practice, can&#39;t live without in (peacefully) and so will continue to work on this.",Julie Marinelli,2020-02-06T17:11:38Z,0

"Hello lovely friends! During today&#39;s practice, the epiphany I had was the following: &quot;If I show up for practice, practice will show up for me.&quot; Bruce Lee once told his student that the technique that works is the one you practice. Since starting my journey, I&#39;ve been branching out to yoga studio practices and creating new friendships. Today was a breakthrough for me in class in an unexpected way; my body was giving up on me heavily in painful ways, but I just modified my poses and kept going. At first, I felt really self-conscious that I was the only one on my knees when people were doing forward lunge; but then I caught myself comparing myself to others. I was a) breathing b) listening to my body and c) taking child&#39;s pose and rest as needed. Everything else didn&#39;t matter anymore and I felt at ease. I have to always remind myself the foundations I learned since Day 1. Building my courage up from beating myself up in private, to finding that zen in public was crazy growth for me. And thank goodness for wrist practice today with Adriene, I needed this as well. Namaste my friends 🙏",Jay-Ram Rajendra,2020-02-05T06:36:08Z,9

I always try to be mindful of the placement of my hands, but it’s hard not to lean into your wrists sometimes when you get tired.

Revelation was the word I was looking for!  I can&#39;t believe what a difference the hand position made to my downward dog &lt;3,Sim one,2019-08-19T08:59:00Z,1
"Hi Adriene ❤️ I follow your videos to practice daily since like forever, but I&#39;ve never tried this rotated hand posture for downward dog before and I have to admit it makes a lot of difference, even though I don&#39;t have tight shoulders anymore. I don&#39;t understand if hands should be placed in the same way if we transition from downward dog to plank and viceversa. I&#39;m trying to freestyle a bit before the ending of the video, as you suggest, and it seems this rotation in plank relieve some pressure I always feel in the wrists towards the inside of the body, but it&#39;s a bit strange to go down from plank in that hand position. I&#39;ve checked the plank foundation video, and the downward dog too, and there you keep the index fingers parallel. A confused yogi here 😀<br />Thank you for your precious videos 🙏🏼❤️",Marina Bellacicco,2019-08-06T06:04:20Z,0

"Started Another 30 day yoga challenge. It’s been such an amazing journey doing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yogawithadriene"">#yogawithadriene</a> on YouTube! I started back in February with no big goals just to get back into something I have always had a passion for but lost for awhile. It’s been so empowering for my body mind and soul. I have learned over the past few months yoga isn’t about being a hard core flexible yogi but it’s about honoring your body and seeing changes in how you feel inside and out. What is also so very special is my kids see and want to join most of the time and baby franky is quite the baby yogi lol I am also so happy and excited to see family members starting their yoga journey and feeling amazing and seeing how much it helps your body feel!  So thankful for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23yogawithadriene"">#yogawithadriene</a>   And YouTube Channel so I can do this journey in the comfort of my own home and time. Hope this post is inspiring. Namaste the light in me honors the light in you 💕✌️🧘‍♀️",Arianna Martinez,2019-08-01T18:32:59Z,0

I eat so much food and I need to burn as much as possible and I used to do cardio and stuff but they are way too harsh for me because you have to run and jumb and these stuff are not my cup of tea and even lifting weights and going to the gym and spend too much money is no for me, but since I found your channel I fall in love with Yoga I didn&#39;t have much to know about Yoga and didn&#39;t think I could lose weight with it.

"I have very limited range of motion in my wrists. They just don&#39;t bend backward the way most human wrists do!  This makes a lot of the standard yoga things many take for granted (down dog, tabletop, that stretch with the fingers interlaced and palms out, pretty much anything involving the backward movement of the wrist, which seems like nearly everything) frustrating and occasionally painful for me. My wrists give out long before the rest of me every time. Several massage therapists have asked me if I was ever injured because what I have is &quot;definitely not a normal range of motion.&quot; No trauma, pure genetics. Needless to say, I was a little nervous about this one because there&#39;s always been a nagging voice in my head that something is wrong with me or that I can&#39;t get the full benefits of yoga because my body gets in the way, even though I&#39;m already more calm and flexible than I&#39;ve ever been in my life at 34, and getting stronger every day. That&#39;s a lot of words for what I really want to say, which is &quot;thank you&quot; so very much, for all the helpful advice in this video and for once again showing me and a whole lot of other folks that you can do so much with what sometimes feels like very little. I and my little oddball wrists thank you, Adriene!",Bonnie Jeanne,2019-07-31T18:25:35Z,0

"What I don&#39;t quite get is how pressing down with the knuckles and fingers is supposed to reduce tension in the wrists since it makes my entire hand and wrist sore even just in table top. Will it eventually get easier with practice or could I be pressing too hard. I did feel more stable in down dog tho, my bum could stop a train",Tofol Cano,2019-07-28T17:04:26Z,0

"Hi Adriene! I&#39;ve been following your videos for awhile now! I&#39;m an animation student and am constantly sitting at my desk for 10+ hours every day. This causes me alot of constant pain in my back everyday day, especially since I have scoliosis lol. I try my best to stretch every hour or so but it still hurts. I often follow your back pain videos which help. So I was wondering, do you have (or could you make) any videos that are specific to artists/animators that spend most of the day on the computer? I would really appreciate it! This hand one is very helpful too 😁 thanks!",artbytatertot,2019-07-28T15:45:02Z,0

"Adrienne, you and this community (and Benji of course:) have provided me so much relief- emotionally, mentally, and physically. I&#39;ve been dealing with Generalized Anxiety Disorder for years now as well as occasional depression. I&#39;ve made countless lifestyle changes, all of which have been beneficial, but the biggest shift has come from doing your videos consistently for close to a year now. I&#39;m more mindful throughout the day of both my thoughts and the way I carry my physical body. I have less migraines which I attribute to bringing the breathing exercises from the mat into my day- especially those times when I notice my thoughts are racing or my shoulders have made their way up to my ears from tension! I hope anyone suffering from anxiety, depression, loneliness, being human reads this and sticks with your videos. Like you said a little goes a long way.( I practiced a 10 minute video from my bed yesterday and sure enough, felt the difference afterwards). Yoga combined with your meditation videos truly goes a long way. To those who may be suffering today, in addition to Adrienne&#39;s videos, I also use guided meditation from &#39;The Honest Guys&#39; (here on YouTube)- also life changers. Lastly, this video has helped me tremendously with my anxiety and insomnia-- I fall asleep to it every night: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTqktSAmG30"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTqktSAmG30</a>.

"When I first began to do yoga I couldn&#39;t stay in downdog long due to my wrists. I had thought they were just weak and that it would always be that way, but they got strong and I can hold the asana now for however long I want! I just made a video on how I FINALLY managed to succeed doing yoga 30 days straight. I&#39;d failed 4 or 5 times before that and wanted to succeed. I realized some strategies that allowed for this to happen. I&#39;m actually on day 89 now, and very behind posting my 60 days review and have to film my 90-day review tomorrow!

He’s also high up in the American Nutrition organisations and very highly respected.  It’s not going to hurt trying gluten free for a few months to see if that helps your anxiety.  He’s got case studies that do see massive improvements.  I hope you are well.",Don Wetherell,2019-08-01T14:02:16Z,1
"Hi Sarah, I did notice increased calmness in myself from doing yoga 2 or 3 times per week. THen I wanted to do 30 days straight of yoga to prove to myself I could do it and to see if what I experienced was different than doing it 2 or 3 times. I failed a few times trying at first, but then succeeded once I figured out some strategies to help overcome my personal challenges that kept knocking me off course. What I noticed from doing it (I&#39;m actually on day 89 straight right now) is that I get calmer and calmer and things that have stressed me out a lot in the past aren&#39;t as stressful to me now. I still would like them to not exist, but I don&#39;t get so stressed out and anxious about them now. I feel like there&#39;s more space inside myself, I don&#39;t know how to say it better than that, but it&#39;s a good feeling and is calm compared with the anxiousness I&#39;d been spiraling in before. Also sitting quietly and meditating by just watching my thoughts and stopping them when they are upsetting thoughts and I notice they are there has helped a lot too. You could do that anywhere and no one would even know. If you can do yoga every day, even a short one like 15 minutes or so it will add to your increasing calmess. It builds. Te calmness builds with doing it daily - for yoga or meditation. I  made a video too on how I finally figured out ways to overcome the challenges that kept knocking me off course with doing it every day. My issues may not be the same as yours, but maybe they can give you ideas on how you could make doing yoga every day work out (in case there are things there that might make it seem not likely). I also noticed that when I do it in the morning, the whole rest of the day goes waaaaaayyyyyy better than if I do it in the evening. I think yoga in the evening is great and better than no yoga. I feel it would be ideal as a second yoga pracice because nothing makes the day feel easier than when I do it in the morning. All the best. Keep watching inspiring videos and do what you can in your own mind to calm those pesty thoughts that cause stress. You can do it!",Holly XO,2019-07-28T13:36:17Z,21
