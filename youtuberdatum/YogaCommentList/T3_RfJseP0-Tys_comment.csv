"What does center feel like?<br />Why is center important? <br />May we use the tools of yoga to learn how to feel our center, to learn how to guide our way back to center, and to celebrate that it is a journey.",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-19T14:14:48Z,594
was having a pretty meh week. To be honest whenever Adrienne has said &quot;the hardest part is showing up&quot; i usually do some form of an eye roll. getting on the mat today made me finally realize the wisdom in those words.,Timothy Kent,2021-05-05T00:58:01Z,0

"You mentioned about how the center chakra is your strength , your true self ! <br />I felt I haven’t been myself for years and maybe will get closer to being myself as my practice the mat continues ! <br />Though the breathing techniques help me snap into my meditation frame of mind ! Helps tremendously when communicating with Him ! <br />Thanks a lot 🥰😘",Aashka Shah,2021-02-20T14:07:25Z,0

Super sad because I was going so strong but in the middle of this practice when “looking into the pond at your reflection” I pulled my SI joint and have had limited mobility since... does anyone have anything they know helps?

"Oddly enough as hard as I&#39;ve found lots of other yoga poses, crow has always been one I could do. In second grade in p.e. we spent a week watching a yoga video and was told we would win a prize for how well we did. I won and I don&#39;t know if it was a knack for yoga or intense competitiveness lol but the memory always stuck with me (18 years later) and crow is my neat little trick 😋",Bri W,2021-03-17T03:50:35Z,0

"Centering is so important for me in my daily life. I love what you said in the end about being mindful about moving through  your center when you are doing everyday things like getting out of the car, bed, or getting off the toilet. Sometimes I find my head going before my heart and center when I am walking or doing those daily activities and I think it creates unnecessary tension for my body.

"Hello Adriene, The first time I tried yoga was with your 20 minute &quot;yoga for beginners&quot; video, I was amazed at how effective it was for my physical and mental well being.  I am now up to day 18 of your 30 day breath series and am really enjoying the pacing of the program and how you build upon the poses as we go.  I have had a shoulder impingment problem for 8 years now that physio alone has not been able to correct, but the way yoga addresses the positioning and flexibility of the whole body has started to fix my shoulder impingment.  I really enjoyed day 18 of your series.  Thank you so much for providing these videos, I can&#39;t convey just how much and in how many ways they are improving my life.  Thanks again.",Laurence Brewer,2021-02-18T09:46:22Z,0

"I felt a strange pinch in the bottom of my left hand in downward dog, plank and prepping for crow pose that made me have to pause from these poses. Never felt that before. Am I doing something wrong or should I take a break? I love doing these every day but not if I&#39;m uncomfortable in the poses.",Gina Anderson,2021-02-10T15:51:04Z,0
"People have talked about crying during yoga and I was honestly looking forward to it, but I cried out of frustration and disappointment with myself with crow pose/attempted crow pose today and it didn&#39;t feel good at all, not a cathartic release or anything. I know I just have to keep trying and be patient with myself but I think doing that is harder than the actual poses.",Jesse Genao,2021-02-10T15:24:13Z,0

"Saying &quot;the hardest part is showing up&quot; never resonated with me because doing yoga didn&#39;t feel like the hardest part, all the poses did. But since I&#39;ve been coming off anti depressants (good reasons!), the withdrawal effets are knocking me about so much that turning up has now become the hardest part. I have horrible indigestion, weird zaps, I often feel like my nerves detect the ground a second too late, my limbs feel like fuzzy velvet, and I am fighting bad back pain due to sleeplessness.<br /><br />Sometimes I miss a day. It&#39;s Feb 9th and I&#39;m on day 18 and I started on day one. I try not to think &quot;I wish she wouldn&#39;t congratulate me for being here because it reminds me of the days I wasn&#39;t, and she is congratulating people on the days I wasn&#39;t here!!&quot;. But I remember to remind myself that this is my journey. Someone else&#39;s struggles are not mine to compare to, and I believe it ruins any healing they have done when I (in my mind) think others don&#39;t deserve praise for turning up on days I didn&#39;t.<br /><br />I do get frustrated when Adrienne keeps talking, but I remember that I used to love it because it kept yoga fun and inviting, whereas now I just wanna get through it so I can go back to being in regular discomfort. I&#39;m so glad I was reminded today that everyone is different, and I don&#39;t get to me impatient because something that is designed to be soothing isn&#39;t going at my pace.",Megan Pinch,2021-02-09T00:12:31Z,3

"Oh I needed that after the day I had yesterday! Up at 3.30 to drive from Hampshire to Lords cricket ground in London for COVID jab, then visited seriously ill son whom we haven’t seen since Xmas. Then on the way back to Hampshire a van veered towards us on the motorway meaning we had to take evasive action and drive into a load of cones which caused a puncture so had to wait for 2 hours for AA man to bring us another tyre as Tesla’s don’t have spares, which I didn’t know!

Today i arrived there, and decided to just wiggle around my fingertips, could notice some strength in my arms which gave me a relief that one day i&#39;ll get there again.💛 Also, although sometimes you do talk a bit, I always think in those moments about others learning yoga for the first time from you. I think you&#39;re doing a great job keeping it open for beginners yet challenging enough for more experienced yogi&#39;s. Keep up the good work.💫",JoyKirsten,2021-02-02T22:46:28Z,0

But today was very different- when I went up to the high lunge, I felt lighter on the left than the right, from the foot, through the hip and up the torso.  Any ideas why that may be?

It helped me center myself in order to restore inner peace. It balances the body and soul. I&#39;m looking forward to know about red carpet of options even if I planned to do a new 30 days program I didn&#39;t do it yet. Thank you Adriene.,Fanfan MentalistFictions,2021-01-28T00:38:24Z,0

"It started raining when I checked what is my relationship to center... This was the most touching moment throughout this journey so far. I felt like I neglected my center for so long, the center of myself",Marcin Chylinski,2021-01-27T22:14:38Z,0

"I haven’t commented yet on this journey. I am started this journey about a week or so later. I remember when I first started I felt really guilty and annoyed at myself for starting later but over time I have realised that it really doesn’t matter when you started or how long you have been doing yoga for it’s the very fact that I am here and on this journey in the first place that matters. I just wanted to say a massive thank you to you Adriene and your amazing community. Today was a really powerful day for me and I also managed to do crow pose for quite an extended period of time which has been a goal of mine for ages, I doubt at the beginning of this journey I could have done that. So thank you again😊",Lyned Isaac,2021-01-27T22:00:48Z,0
"Thank you Day 18!  I wanted to add a crow-related synergistic tidbit: This morning, no joke, what got me out of bed was a murder of squawking crows in the neighbor&#39;s yard. Something in the air, Adriene! &lt;3",Felicity Doyle,2021-01-27T21:18:38Z,0

"I was on track with this 30-day program until I got COVID and had to take almost two weeks off. Trying to get back into it now, though my energy is still really low. It takes a special kind of self love to allow myself to heal fully, as my instinct is to push myself to the end, but I am learning to better listen to my body and mind and allow space for healing. It&#39;s hard. If you&#39;ve had to take time off, as well, I&#39;m with you!",Erin Regneri,2021-01-27T20:57:32Z,0

"Day 18: I showed up! I survived!  Nothing else matters.<br /><br />Seriously though: I missed a bunch of days in a row for several reasons, and they happened, and they don&#39;t matter any more.  What matters is being here on the mat again, and the intention to be back tomorrow.  To always come back, even if there&#39;s a gap.  And I&#39;ve got that.<br /><br />In other related news, I think I need a literal yoga mat.  While I didn&#39;t do great at connecting to center today, I did feel very very firmly in my whole body that finding my center is almost impossible if I don&#39;t have a good base to start from--and there is not enough friction on my living room rug to ever feel truly secure in my base.  I CAN do the wide-legged stances and ground into my feet.  I have that strength.  But when I&#39;m using nearly all the strength I have just to press into the ground so I don&#39;t instantly slip into a wider splits than my body can handle, there&#39;s none left to find center with.  It&#39;s a disadvantage I haven&#39;t even really paid attention to playing with, and it&#39;s HARD.<br /><br />So.  A real yoga mat.  Continued determination.  It all comes from there.",Clarity C,2021-01-27T17:10:14Z,0
"I&#39;ve been practicing yoga for years now, and I&#39;ve always loved it, but due to the anxiety/tension/stress I&#39;ve accumulated these past few months yoga became an obligation for me, and it became harder and harder to show up (even though I badly need it right now).<br /><br />It took me showing up a week late to day 18 to start having fun in my practice again.  When Adriene said &quot;fingertips come to the earth... or your DVD&#39;s&quot; I laughed so much. So glad I stuck to it. <br /><br />If you&#39;re also late, we got this. Lots of love.",Julia Amorim,2021-01-27T16:00:13Z,1

"Thank you for an amazing practice! I just have one question which bothers m a lot: I have scoliosis and I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m centered because I feel diffferent sensations in 2 halves of my body. So when I feel like I&#39;m more or less centered it doesn&#39;t look like this visually and if I&#39;m lying on the mat more or less straight, I don&#39;t feel like this (I feel like my legs are more right or left for example). So I can&#39;t trust my feelings in a way. I don&#39;t know what to do with this and would be grateful for an advice.",Екатерина Косенко,2021-01-26T17:38:03Z,0

"Today&#39;s focus on &#39;what does the centre feel like is very timely for me.&#39; I hurt my lower back a few weeks ago and am now unable to bend forward very far and keep my knees super bent so that I can partially get into downward dog.  The &#39;on the toes&#39; exercise&#39; imagining that it is the centre that is lifting us was an amazing game changer.  I suddenly had so much more balance and control.  I&#39;ve realized that I can apply this to any of the work we have been doing - I can twist further, open my heart more etc. and feel like my back is less vulnerable when I (I think this is what Adriene said) keep my centre contained.  I love these break through moments that make such a difference.  I can never say enough how grateful I am for this wonderful gift that is given with such kindness.  Thank you Adriene.",Ruth Mccollum,2021-01-26T05:24:47Z,0

"Thank you for this exquisite practice. After a long day of the mind and the world rejecting me and saying I&#39;m not worthy, heavy heart, erratic brain and breath that kept escaping, your loving voice and kind words brought me to a halt. With a bit of focus and attention I managed to do the crow pose and hold it for 5 seconds for the first time ever. Which naturally brought a flood of tears in the savasana. However the tears brought cleansing of the mind and rejuvenation of the heart and the breath came back. You are a global treasure. Namaste",Tea Hržica,2021-01-21T20:13:46Z,0

"My life has completely changed since learning ocean breath. I talk differently. I sing differently. I sleep differently. I poop differently. I THINK differently.  I haven&#39;t done yoga in 5 years and I&#39;m casually flexing on poses that previously tested my soul and sanity, no cap. I have a distinct memory from my childhood when my sister shamed me for breathing too loudly in the theater.  That day I learned to control my breath, but with the malintent of snuffing it out. 20 years later and I&#39;m finally giving myself permission to aspirare. ASPIRE. To Breath. Here&#39;s another anecdotal metric: Cold showers used to be a challenge, but knowing how to breath slowly has erased the discomfort of stepping into one; here&#39;s lookin&#39; at you, Wim Hof.  Also, since finding my center I can straight up Irish dance having never taken a lesson. It&#39;s like that Mulan song: Once you find your center, you are sure to win! All this after 18 days. I&#39;m going to repeat this series every month of 2021.",John deBruin,2021-01-21T04:35:29Z,0

Past years it was a nice, stretch pose, but now I&#39;m about to reach my 4th month since I got a breast reduction. It was a long and invasive surgery, and while I&#39;m happier and more relieved than I&#39;ve been in years, it was painful and I&#39;m still recovering. The scars go through all my underboob up to below my armpits, and my sides are definitely still very stiff. I can feel how these videos help me regain my strength and flexibility, so..

For me, it unlocked new strength and stillness in my crow and headstand poses that I haven&#39;t found yet, even with regular practice. I think this is what I&#39;ve grown to love about yoga: it is an exploration, a process of continued discovery. Namaste!",Katie Stottlemire,2021-01-20T18:21:53Z,0

I got really excited about it, I was finishing the rest of the practice smiling, and I couldn&#39;t wait to finish it and tell my brother, because we are both doing yoga, he is in the US and I am in Europe, so this connects us because we can talk about the time on the mat, feels like we are doing it together :D",Irena Stevanovska,2021-01-20T11:25:37Z,339

What should I do? I’m in fairly decent shape, or so I thought. Why am I hurting so much all of a sudden? I’m wondering if things are just moving too fast for me on this journey.

The way you&#39;ve curated each day is magnificent Adrienne. Admittedly something got on my nerves and threatened to ruin my morning that I had to close my laptop and get on the mat. My mind was distracted up until the Crescent Pose when the lovely feeling of that stretch overrode my annoyance and I could finally centre my self into the practice. It also taught me that the feelings and emotions I centre is through choice and that I need to commit and train my mind to centre my feelings out of negativity.

I&#39;ve been doing YWA videos for about two years now, and I&#39;ve never gotten close to actually balancing in crow. But after the practice today I just had to keep trying, and I DID IT.

Could not stop smiling after. :) Never give up guys, eventhough it is hard. you will get there some day!! Even if it takes some time.

"Another gem. Like you said, this is the core, or, your signature, as a yoga guide. It is what you implant. Uniting with my center/core, power/life force, has been a long quest of mine. Finding center - our life force, can be  very illusive, but you nail it Adriene! There is no dollar amount that can equal the value of what you are teaching in this Breath series.

Thank you Adriene, for giving me some insight into this practice. I am very interested in the philosophical teachings of yoga. I&#39;ve been reading The Tree of Yoga and it&#39;s been really insightful. At the beginning of this journey Adriene suggested that we write down the word &quot;simplify&quot; so I did. The little post-it in my yoga room with the word &quot;simplify&quot; reminds me everyday to do just that; both on and off the mat. It&#39;s been really helpful. See you tomorrow!

My planks are incredible after 8 months of yoga every day and although I cannot make it to the crow pose yet I know someday I will get there.  I’m proud to show up on the mat every single day and taking time for me before anything else as hard as that may be as a working mom of 3 kids during a pandemic.

"Thank you for what you said today about the modifications/allowing your fellow humans to settle before we begin. I&#39;ve been on/off practicing yoga for several years now but very much still feel like a beginner and am limited by my body at times. I sometimes feel like I&#39;m &quot;slowing class down&quot; when you go into variations because I imagine there&#39;s others who are much, much farther on their journey than I am - despite that I&#39;m literally the only one in my room (sans my cat lol), and there&#39;s no one else to slow down in my immediate space. That said, I also remember those who watch your videos in their own time and wonder about them... It was a good reminder that we&#39;re all different and will get to certain poses in our own pace (or not at all!), and that&#39;s okay. We need to be patient with ourselves and with others. Namaste, indeed. &lt;3",thewinterizzy,2021-01-20T03:32:23Z,0
"Today didn&#39;t go as planned. My ADHD was off the wall, I didn&#39;t use my time to my satisfaction, and I was starting to feel overwhelmed.

And I&#39;m going to allow myself to be proud of that.",Katie McMahon,2021-01-20T03:32:15Z,0

"When I started doing yoga about 7 years ago, it was as a way to stretch and recover from running or as a way to gently cross-train for running. I was in it for the workout and didn&#39;t really care about looking inward or cultivating the connection of the mind to the body. Since then, I&#39;ve injured my knee and can no longer run, and I have returned to yoga with a much different approach. At a low point in my health and physical fitness in late November, I started doing the 30-day Yoga Camp series and gained so much direction from each practice and from journaling about the mantras. I ended that series just in time for Breath, and this has been a beautiful journey in slowing down and appreciating inner strength. At a time when thousands of people with covid are struggling to breathe on ventilators and the phrase &quot;I can&#39;t breathe&quot; is a rallying cry for social justice, the theme of breath is powerful and so, so precious. I really appreciate how I&#39;m learning to move and open up from the inside out, and today&#39;s focus on the center may be my favorite practice of this series so far.",tromagnoli,2021-01-20T02:46:55Z,0

"I am just enthralled with this practice—I’ve never done Yoga before and 18 days in to your 30 day journey, and I’m hooked. It feels so Right, and you are so kind and welcoming. I love your approach and the togetherness of these lessons. I’m able to do the moves so much better now than a few weeks ago, and it all feels wonderful. I walk differently now, more graceful. Thank you so much for this, and thanks to my friend for letting me know about you. Blessings to you and Benji.",Laura Cooper,2021-01-20T02:14:16Z,0

"Adriene-<br />How wonderful. Been with you for quite a few years now... Crow was always a sticky spot for me. A few months ago I made it a goal to practice crow once a week. And today with this practice, I finally got my feet up and felt centered in crow (even if it was only a few seconds, as I got so excited I quickly lost focus). Brought tears to my eyes. Thank you for helping me feel worthy enough to stick to something and feel confident enough to *fly*. Love from Minnesota.",Becky Tossey,2021-01-20T02:06:22Z,0

"Adriene, I had to laugh: as I&#39;m lying on the ground in the beginning, trying to focus on deep, slow breaths, one of my dogs came and put her sweet snout in my hand, while the other came, sniffed my face and booped my directly in the left eye. 😄 Not much deep breathing for a minute, but big, belly laughter. <br /><br />It was good for my soul after a hard day.

"Right before doing this, a family member snapped at me (something we just don&#39;t do in our family) and left me feeling hurt, shocked, and honestly really angry. This practice helped me find my center...helped me realize I can acknowledge but not drown in my emotions and that I can only control me, my breathing, my acceptance, my forgiveness... I hope my family member finds some peace and doesn&#39;t take their stress out on me again, but I have no control over that. Ironically, this practice helped me let go of outward control.

@Jacqueline Lucier yeah it can be a problem if you&#39;re built a certain way. It&#39;s meant to be a relaxing pose but if you have to tilt your pelvis a lot It&#39;s not very relaxing! Maybe it would help to put your feet on the mat so your knees fall together? Take whatever position you find relaxing.,Prosateuse,2021-01-20T01:44:21Z,1
@Prosateuse it feels like it’s off the mat! So I’ll try lifting my knees to my chest and scooping up my tail bone to get my back flat to the mat. For some reason as soon as my legs are straight the pain and pressure start.,Jacqueline Lucier,2021-01-20T01:39:16Z,0

So for example, it hurts when I start with that space between my back and the mat and then bring my knees up to my chest. My chiropractor suggested to help this I do a one-legged pigeon pose on both sides before lying on my back or doing corpse pose. Do you have any tips or adjustments for this?

"I’ve been doing yoga with Adriene for a few years now. I first learned about it from a friend who was doing one of the 30 day series. I followed suit. After that I tried to maintain a home practice, even if that just meant 15-20 minutes on the mat at the end of a workout. Fast forward to last March and the beginning of the pandemic. I was scared. I was freaking out. I came back to YWA. I did the yoga for stress &amp; anxiety video every day. Over and over. I’d occasionally add another video, like if my low back or shoulders needed some extra attention. Adriene really helped me let go of all that stress and anxiety. It got me through some dark days. Eventually, I grew a bit bored of doing that one video over and over and remembered the 30 day series. Amazingly there were several different 30 day series and I just started working through them at my own pace. Some days I’d skip, on others I’d do 2. I completed every 30 &amp; 31 day series since the pandemic began and I thank you, Adriene. I thank this awesome community. Thank you for being there for me through the pandemic and for gifting us with this 30 days of Breath. Namaste 🙏",Meghan Walega,2021-01-20T00:13:49Z,1

This year we are caring for our elderly mom, kids in virtual high school, job problems... people problems (ha ha) and we had to miss a couple. At first we were feeling guilty then we both looked at each other and said “WWAS..(what would Adriene say?)<br />Just get back on the mat is what she would say. It’s not a competition she would say, it’s a process. We laughed when we realized “how would Adriene know anyways” “is she watching us? Sending out the Yoga police?”<br />We will just hop back on where we left off and finish, it will still be 30 days of yoga. Did Adriene make a rule that it had to be 30 consecutive days? Absolutely not!!<br />Love you Adriene for allowing us all to be right where we are at and promising to meet us there. You got us and we got this!!",Nancy Hatschbach,2021-01-24T01:54:50Z,5

I am on my mat and completed this yoga day like all others this month. Feeling grounded. This video taught me to slow down and lie down in corpse pose for a nap time like 1 hour. It&#39;s healing for the mind. ✨🎉🎈🎊✨,Biren Patel,2021-01-19T22:59:24Z,0
When Adrienne said just be patient and wait for the others to find their blocks or dvds that hit me really hard. I was like oh she is right I have to patient I am not alone in this. I am not alone in life. We all have to be patient with each other and learn and grown thru each other. Hope everyone found their center today or got a little closer. ❤,Μαρία Καρπάθη,2021-01-19T22:56:43Z,72

It was just one of those work days that is hectic and full of things going wrong!<br />However, I so needed to turn up that, despite the delay, I did the session in the evening and was so pleased I did!

"Ah wow - have never entered into a crow pose so focused on my center.

"So earlier today I made myself an eye pillow (filled with flax seeds) and got to use it during Savasana! Hey, its the small things in life! Also when I walked to the bus this morning, trying not to slip on the snow/ice, I really felt my core. Not like a flex or tension but like a diffuse steadiness.

"Adriene, I loved that you pointed out today how we should be patient with everyone practising at different levels. It&#39;s as in life, we are all in different places and it&#39;s understanding and patience that will make coexisting on this planet a beautiful thing. <br />Sending my love to all yogis - the tight hamstringy ones, the jelly ankly ones, the crow mastering ones, the busy minded ones, the off-centre ones, the zenned out ones, the doggy ones ... we are all here, doing this for ourselves so that we can be a better part of the beautiful world we live in, the world that needs us at our best. Namaste!<br />P.S: This journey inspired me to get a new mat after 5 years. My mom said I deserved the best one for sticking to yoga so passionately for the past years. &lt;3 It felt so good practising on the new mat today. Not because of the material side of having something new, but actually realising I deserve good things, I have earned it with hard work. And also, it&#39;s even more of a commitment now. You spent money on something, make it count. <br />See you tomorrow!",Neja Žitnik,2021-01-19T21:49:34Z,0

"@Karen Herman I hear you! I found that this idea of moving from the center helped me a lot this time around. I tried to keep my core zipped and at the same time kept my gaze out as much as possible, because before I wouldn&#39;t trust it so much and as Adriene said this is extremely important to keep the balance. It is rather painful of a pose, you are right there! ❤️🙏🏻",Lydía Z,2021-01-22T09:33:04Z,0
"Frustrated with myself today, I just can&#39;t get the Crow right. I felt so ready for it but when it didn&#39;t happen. I struggle with my knees on the arms and the pressure I feel doing that, I can&#39;t bring stability or stillness to the movement. Then in addition to that I find myself freezing with what, fear I guess, of bringing both feet up and falling flat onto my face. I practice alternating the feet up and down just a little and that&#39;s cool but I don&#39;t feel centred enough to go the whole way. A lot more practice required from me on this one. Otherwise a beautiful session ❤️",Karen Herman,2021-01-22T05:16:49Z,1
"Hi Adriene, i have a problem with crow pose. I can do the balancing but I dislike this pose because I have really thin arms and my triceps hurts when I put the weight on it.

"Thank you for this class. It was very empowering! Even though I&#39;ve been doing yoga for over 15 years, I find I&#39;ve lost my way with my practice after having my daughter 4 years ago. I&#39;ve lost so much strength and my core/ pelvic floor is in shambles. I have felt so discouraged every time I step onto the mat because I can&#39;t do even half of what I used to. I love that you encourage us to slow down, center ourselves, and check in. These are things I&#39;ve stopped doing during yoga. It&#39;s almost become a mindless task of movement, or a personal competition with myself that leaves me angry or sad. I feel so much calmer and healthier once I step off the mat with you these days. Furthermore, I appreciate that you reminded us to check in with our frustration with those moments of explanation that you give. I can occasionally catch myself feeling restless during those times, but I appreciate being called out on it and reminded that we&#39;re all in this together. &lt;3. Thank you, beautiful human!

"okay, story time: before the video I was trying to get to the crow pose, because it is one of my yoga goals. I could do it for like one very uncomfortable second. but in todays practice, guyyyys, I finally did it!  it was like 10 seconds, but I was confident and happy! It took me like &quot;only a year of yoga practice.",Marie Zdráhalová,2021-01-19T20:39:11Z,0

"Today&#39;s practice was about learning how to move from the center. Being aware of our center and centering with our breath in every moment, because invites the next moment and the next. In today&#39;s practice, I may not have understood some terms she was using, a few words kind of vague to me. Anyway, I was surprised how thinking and being aware of the center can feel different and new. I definitely cannot stay in crow for more than 1 second but I like the challenge. I&#39;ll do it one day. <br /><br />I feel heavy after the practice, also a little bit of headache of pre-practice might have influenced it. But definitely, I feel more relaxed. <br /><br />This is one of Adriene&#39;s favorite practices and she invites asking &quot;What is my relationship to center? What does center feel like? Why is center important?&quot;",Pooya Valinataj,2021-01-19T20:24:17Z,0

"I&#39;m REALLY new to yoga. I began this journey because I was so inflexible. The first time in this series when we did cactus arms, twisting our legs to the left and right, I whimpered and whined while shaking. I could not come even close to keeping my arms on the floor. This pose looked so relaxing and yet it was torture. It&#39;s Day 18, and while I&#39;m still not quite where I want to be, the position is much easier. No matter where you are, keep showing up! It&#39;s worth it!!",Melanie Sarver,2021-01-19T19:53:53Z,0

After today&#39;s practice, I felt so enlightened that I was able to truly explore what it means to be present in my body. Committing to BREATH is single-handedly the best choice I have ever made when it comes to my yoga practice (and arguably in life!). I completed HOME and felt changed forever, but this year&#39;s journey is on a whole other level. Thank you to all of you who make this experience happy and proud.

"Adriene always knows what we need! I&#39;ve been (re)discovering during this practise that I have a weak core which causes problems for me in many ways physically and emotionally, I&#39;m often hunched over and lack confidence to carry myself with my centre. I neglected the manipura/ solar plexus chakra in my practise, so much so that I didn&#39;t even know what it corresponded to. Now I know a focus on centre and manipura is what I really need.

Today, for the first time I managed 30 seconds - am so chuffed! No matter where we are on the journey the most valuable part is to show up and be open to possibility...that&#39;s what life&#39;s all about! Thank you Adriene x",Kerry A,2021-01-19T18:38:08Z,24

"Anyone know why the crow pose seems to be a pose that some people can do easily first try, while others (like me) try and try and it seems incredibly difficult? Idk if my body is weirdly proportioned but I find it very hard to get my legs at a comfortable place on my arms, that feels secure. Is it a strength thing? Balance thing? Does anatomy play a part? I&#39;d love to understand this pose more coz I&#39;d love to be able to hold it even for a few seconds. My boyfriend just sent me a vid of him doing it first try, holding it for a while. He goes to the gym and has good body strength, but he doesn&#39;t practice yoga. I&#39;ve practiced yoga on and off for a few years and I&#39;m still working on my strength, but crow pose seems almost unobtainable it&#39;s so difficult for me!",Emily,2021-01-19T18:24:32Z,0
"After seeing the picture of the pose we might PRACTICE today I was impatient and nervous waiting for IT!

"I love this series so much. Whenever I&#39;m not able to fully able to do a pose, or transition smoothly I never feel bad like I have done in past yoga classes. And when I&#39;ve managed to do something a little better than before I feel amazing. Really looking forward to getting better and strengthening my centre.<br />I&#39;ve always compared myself to Slinky Dog from Toy Story. I have a top and a bottom and a wibbly bit in the middle that is only there to stop me from falling in half, but now I feel like I have a centre. It&#39;s still wibbly but it&#39;s there!",The Teeps,2021-01-19T18:07:31Z,0
"I have 5 things to share! <br />1) Down dog really stirs up congestion in my chest, so I had to take a break to take my inhaler halfway through. <br />2) I held my plank for a full 10 seconds today!!! YAY!! <br />3) I held the crow pose practice posture a little too long and now my plantar fasciitis is acting up, so that&#39;s something I didn&#39;t even know I needed to work on.<br />4) As hard as practices are getting, I&#39;m still coming off the mat feeling accomplished and strong. I&#39;m tired and sweaty, breathing out through my mouth a whole lot during practice (lots of heat to release) and feeling super good about myself. <br />5) The amount of fat on my thighs  makes it impossible to keep my feet flush together and straighten my legs, so they are always a little apart. Despite observing that, I don&#39;t feel bad about my weight. <br /><br />Looking forward to tomorrow, no matter how hard it might end up being.",Elizabeth Schwartz,2021-01-19T18:07:04Z,0

When Adriene asked what does your center feel like, i had an epiphany: my center was whole, was warm, was powerful and it could give me everything. Sounds cheesy but hey... Not there for crow pose but it&#39;s ok I learnt something today, maybe another day or maybe not - I have a fear of all things not involving feet for some reasons. Anyway.

I hope you all have a beautiful rest of your day, you deserve it.",Rachel G,2021-01-19T16:58:46Z,1
Center needed so much these days. I’m in Portugal right now and we are in general confinement. So a chance to center myself and get out of head is a necessity ❤️❤️,Sarah Kilgallon,2021-01-19T16:58:33Z,1
Everytime I try to do crow pose and put my leg on my arms / armpits (I tried a few different positions) it hurts so much that I can&#39;t continue. Does anyone know what I&#39;m doing wrong?,Tamara Angelina,2021-01-19T16:57:06Z,0

I knew the crow was coming and I was apprehensive but I still enjoyed the rest up to there....the basic laws of physics just don’t seem to let my body come anywhere near that pose...my knees are nowhere near my armpits and I simply don’t know how to tackle even the first steps towards it....I’m stumped there !! 😖 Love from this Lego woman (short arms and legs!) 🤣🥴🙈🙏🏼❤️,Ami Ay,2021-01-19T16:37:43Z,0

"Wow, the foot exercises today BEFORE the crow absolutely killed me. I don&#39;t know why, but by the time it got to trying crow, I just couldn&#39;t even stay on my feet at all without my whole body shaking, so I didn&#39;t feel comfortable even trying to do crow because I couldn&#39;t find any sort of stability in my base. Maybe another day. I&#39;m a little bummed because I&#39;ve been doing yoga every day for months now and I feel like my feet have never attended the previous 8 weeks of yoga classes the rest of my body went to. I&#39;ve never had this problem and I&#39;ve always been able to at least play in crow. Today I just had to lay down and skip any and all thoughts of crow :/",Melissa F,2021-01-19T15:47:19Z,0

"Today was really challenging for me.  My perfectionist ways snuck in as soon as I saw the still image of video for crow pose ( a pose that continues to challenge me) There were expectations for myself and I was frustrated and in my head and tried to come back to the breath which got me emotional. <br /><br /> So interesting to see where I am at every day, continuing to learn things about myself and my practice.  But in the end, with each new breath is a new arrival kept coming up in my head. I loved the center work, especially the fist on belly when rising up, that was very helpful, made me feel very powerful and strong :)  Thankful that tomorrow will be a new day and a new arrival with more to explore on this journey!

"I’m try this new yoga and see how it goes. I’ll edit my comment every time I do this and see what happens. Wish me luck. Day 1: it was a really hard for me and sometimes I had to keep changing movements because sometimes I would do it wrong but anyways this is a great yoga to do. At the end of the yoga My body felt really comfortable. Day 2: I started to do a tiny bit better and starting to know how to do some of the yoga poses a bit better, the ending was great.

Wow so proud of us all making it to day 18! 🥳 todays practice was hard for me! 🙈 couldn&#39;t quite do my best as practicing for crow pose (the shifting forward and back) the sole of my right foot was cramping up so much I had to stop 😭 left foot was fine though 😂 does this mean that foot just isn&#39;t as strong? Or maybe was my form not good?,Emma,2021-01-19T14:37:49Z,1

This was pure bliss! I have been desiring the CENTER.  Many times I feel GROUNDED or I will also  lead with my HEART (Chakra) space. This Center practice really brought my awareness  into the mix of working with being on and off the mat. CENTER. I&#39;m literally blissed into the center of the self. I can barely make sense of this comment. I hope everyone feels this calming warmth of nectar divine within them. Leading us to a higher conciseness and consciousness  together. WE are all in this together. So much Love! Thank you thank you thank you Adriene you are filling my personal practice with so much wonder.

Breath Day 18! 107 Days in a row with Adriene! This felt really good. A down mood came over me briefly this evening without apparent cause but that is gone now. I could really feel an openness when we stretched ourselves longways early on in the practice. I even did this 37 minutes in 37 minutes. No 1.25x today!

"This is the first time I&#39;ve done one of Adriene&#39;s yoga journeys in real time (reading the email first thing in the morning and everything, btw that feels like reading a love letter from a friend I don&#39;t know if that happens to any of you :p) it&#39;s really exiting and special giving that I&#39;ve followed her almost since the beginning but university and eventually work didn&#39;t allowed me to join in like now.<br /><br />So yesterday when I hurt my foot and could barely move it I felt sad knowing that today I might have to miss practice for the first time. I decided to join all of you anyway and do a bunch of variations to protect myself (keeping a knee on the floor during the warriors, doing puppy postures instead of downward facing dogs, doing half planks...) but up from the minute <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfJseP0-Tys&amp;t=25m00s"">25:00</a> onwards I couldn&#39;t really do much.<br />I was feeling a little discouraged until at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfJseP0-Tys&amp;t=28m00s"">28:00</a> she began to explain how we really are a community and we must be patient with one another. That felt extra special because it reminded me I had to be patient with myself and that I wasn&#39;t alone. Suddenly I was at the back of the class cheering all of you on. I just wanted to share that &lt;3",Flavia C,2021-01-19T14:09:24Z,1

"Wandering mind in Corpse Pose population me. Isn&#39;t so funny how one day you can come to the mat and be totally focused on the breath and it is as if nothing else is happening and then other days your brain is like &quot;we have to do this, then this, then this, then this&quot;!? Crazy! Aside from my wandering thoughts this practice was a wonderful reminder of the importance of centre and how it truly is what carries me through each day and moment of my life. Some days it is stronger, more supportive than others but that is okay. We just have to take it as it comes.

"Crow pose? Umm not today. Even if I could lift this over weight body, at my age if I fell forward I’d likely break something.  <br /><br />With that said, this practice revealed when I loose confidence I loose my breath.

I was also proud I at least did the set up for crow!  <br /><br />Everyone who got to the mat and more Bravo and have a wonderfully centered day! 🙏🏻",Dee Dee Lynch Silverstein,2021-01-19T13:38:18Z,0

"The crow pose was a struggle for me! It felt so awkward and difficult as I lifted one foot a time, I even fell over once. I realized though  through Adriene&#39;s words it was not about the pose but about bringing what I&#39;ve learned to the pose and focusing on my center, and my hand to earth connection. It was a liberating feeling when I realized that. And even though it was still a struggle I feel more confident to try again next time!",Melanie H,2021-01-19T13:33:16Z,58
I loved some of the sensations I experienced here this morning. There was an emotional moment on the mat as I connected with myself and realized that I am an amazing person.

I deeply appreciate Adriene for leading the journey and all of those who also join. It feels like you’re all around me and I am not alone.,Amanda Armstrong,2021-01-19T13:32:54Z,18

"For our Day 18 the question is “What does center feel like?” . For me it’s the moment you step into the mat and letting go of the energy that doesn’t serve well. It is also the union of our breath and movement that creates this harmonious energy as we do all these meditative poses. And lastly, it’s the collective efforts and practices of everyone in this yoga community that made a strong foundation for this channel to become a beacon of light and wellness for everyone in the world.

"ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE CLASS<br />Specially the peacefulness of first few minutes where we got the opportunity to connect with our inner selves.<br />Then how we transitioned into the stretches, laying on our back, continuing our connection with the mother earth. The strongest and most fundamental CENTERING force that is there.<br />And after that, the way transitioned into power poses.

The way I was breathing before involved long abdominal inhales with a flabby low belly ...

"Wonderful session, thanks for your guidance and inspiration. Center reminded me of this quote of Nelson Mandela: <br /><br /><br />&quot;...Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. <br />Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.<br />It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.<br />We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? <br />Actually, who are you not to be? <br />You are a child of God.<br />Your playing small does not serve the world.<br />There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won&#39;t feel insecure around you. <br />We are all meant to shine, as children do.<br />We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. <br />It&#39;s not just in some of us; it&#39;s in everyone.<br />And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.<br />As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.&quot;",Rozemarijn Kalis,2021-01-19T11:35:42Z,0

"I was really frustrated by crow, not by me not being able to balance on my hands, but because I couldn&#39;t get my body in what seemed to be the right position. Her knees looked like they were basically in her armpits and her hands really far forward, the only way for me to get my knees where her knees looked to be was to have my hands in by my feet. I know my arms are slightly shorter than average, so I&#39;m sure that doesn&#39;t help, but I felt like my position was all wrong. Didn&#39;t help when she said knees shouldn&#39;t be digging into the arms, and mine totally were. Frustrating! Anyway, I know the point is to try, not be perfect, but I felt like I wasn&#39;t even trying the right way to set up for crow in the future.",Shannon Pitts,2021-01-19T10:50:56Z,0

The idea of moving from centre really resonates with me and I think it was one of the first things (asides from breathing more mindfully) that I took off the mat with me and into everyday life since starting yoga nearly 3 years back.

"I’m loving these 30 days. I have to make adjustments (a lot) because of my back pain but today, lying down with my knees up I felt my center turn on for the first time in months.

Thank you so much Adriene, Benji and team for these wonderful practices.",Zangcoaching Leonie de Wit,2021-01-19T10:34:27Z,4
"I always told myself that I couldn&#39;t hold my own body weight...cut to today and holding a 10 second plank because I&#39;m actually doing it correctly lol. It&#39;s nice to prove others wrong, but it&#39;s even better to prove yourself wrong! :)",theprincessed,2021-01-19T10:33:26Z,88

"Adriene, you ask what center means to me and I think it is the core of my body, the connection between navel and spine which gives me strength through my daily yoga. I love core practices, low to the ground, a brilliant way for us senior yogis to keep strong in a safe way. At the start with our breath practice I enjoyed counting 5 in, then 6 out and increased up to 7 in and 8 out, then tried to carry on with slow breathing throughout. I’m getting much stronger in plank and rather wobbly in those tippy toes poses 😂 but all such great fun. Awesome Adriene, I loved Day 18.

"As I end the session today, I feel expanded, connected and centred. &quot;My relationship to center&quot; is to be in the still point, in that space where my true power lies and where no effort is needed. No effort to do any of the yoga poses, no effort to speak my truth, no effort to relate to all around and be part of our beautiful world and all the lovely souls around. Thank you for an amazing practice today. So helpful to now start and think to move from our centre every time we engage into anything inwardly or outwardly.

"Goodmorning! This practice was intense but I’m so glad I got through it. I connected with my center in every move, except for the crow pose. I’m quite short (1,59) and I find the crow pose very difficult because it feels like my arms are too short to be a support for my legs. Can someone else relate to that or is it just me? Or is it just because I can’t connect with my center properly? Thanks again for the practice Adriene. Have a nice day everyone 🙏🏼💚",Diandraonline,2021-01-19T07:33:35Z,1

"@Anna Holland I think it took me about a year...? That said, I imagine the time it will take someone will be very individual, given previous physical activity, age, body in general, how much yoga/crow in particular one does, so I wouldn&#39;t use my experience as too much of a guide - it can very probably go both ways, with someone being able to do it sooner/later than I could, and for some I imagine the pose simply won&#39;t be possible for any variety of reasons ^^ and all that is perfectly fine, it is yoga &quot;practice&quot;, not yoga &quot;perfect&quot;, after all :)",M Chagawa,2021-01-19T13:11:48Z,0

"Ok so just did this CENTERING practice and I totally surprised myself when I could actually feel my center engaged ad helping to lift me up on my toes in Tadasana and lo and behold also to get both my knees up from the ground in crow pose, even if it was for just a few seconds. Will try and keep Adriene’s words in mind as I try to focus my attention on moving with my Centre engaged when I get off the mat today. Can’t wait to see what I experience next on this wonderful journey. Also so far, even though I cannot see any physical change, I feel lighter in my center and mind as I’m learning to accept what my body can do now as opposed to what it can’t and that has made such a difference. I have chosen to let go of that which is no longer serving me and I find myself open to receive both in mind and body and heart.  So thank you so much for that Adriene ❤️",Tasneem Siahiwala,2021-01-19T06:55:04Z,178
