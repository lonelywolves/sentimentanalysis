today&#39;s video sadly really wasn&#39;t my type at all. i actuall feel worse after the video. was bored at the breathing and the poses did nothing for me. i rly tried focusing but that made it worse. is there something to do when i get more annoyed than relieved/relaxed the longer the video goes on?,Faye,2020-10-28T21:17:04Z,0

This flow was an absolute beauty. I liked it so much I had the urge to write it. I was kinda not in the mood of moving a lot (or so I thought at the begining when you said that we were going to sweat) but it felt soooooo good. I feel so energized. Thanks a lot.,Brenda Tinoco,2020-09-11T03:17:44Z,0

"When I saw the length of today&#39;s class I told myself that I would go back and do Day 6 again as well. Adriene said at the begging of this video that we were going to sweat and she&#39;s a woman of her word! Once the video that I thought was too short concluded I decided that I &quot;was good&quot; and didn&#39;t need to repeat yesterday&#39;s video as a supplement, lol... Amazing class today, I feel so strong, my intention today was to find my strength and move with ease, wow setting the intention really helped me get into the right mind space and I WAS strong and I moved with such ease, I love my body and it&#39;s showing me I&#39;m capable of so much! Thank you Adrienne, Namastay. 🙏🏾",Kareemah Jones,2020-09-07T18:36:45Z,0

I&#39;m finding these videos rather late. I&#39;m about 3 weeks or so I to a regular practice. After day 7 of these 30 days I&#39;m sore but feeling great. The stretching is doing my body some good. Although years of inactivity has left my body tight and I&#39;m not very flexible. My goal is to be pain free and able to be a little bit more flexible,Valeta Winn,2019-11-12T14:13:42Z,0

I was wondering the same thing about the black screen episodes...relief that it’s not my iPad.<br />Beside this distracting part.<br />For me it’s still the basic downward dog pose to feet at the top of the mat...that I struggle a lot just can’t seem to figure out how to do it!!!<br />As always it’s take for ever to get there and that’s gets me two three poses behind 😐 <br />If you have any tips for me I’ll greatly appreciate. I feel I’m a forever beginner!<br />Can we love and hate yoga at the same time? 🤔,Nicole Vachon,2019-11-07T19:46:01Z,0

"The last couple of months have been really rough for me and I found myself having panic attacks this morning.  I went to go do this workout and instantly started to tell myself how much I was going to suck at it because I can&#39;t seem to focus.  Then I remembered a previous video in the series Adrian stating something along the lines of noticing where you are and where your thoughts are is part of the process and it&#39;s ok. I was able to do this video and not feel like a failure while I noticed my mind whirl.  Eventually,  my brain slowed down and I feel much better.  This is something I would love to take off of the mat and into life.",Sarah McLin,2019-10-28T20:19:17Z,1
"I&#39;ll be honest, its taken me longer than 7 days to get to day 7 but omg this video is what made me realize I&#39;ve made so much progress. I immediately did this video again after I finished and it felt like only 5 minutes long, it flew by and I really could tell the improvements in my form and breathing. I think this is a turning point for me and my love for yoga. Thank you.",Monica Rae,2019-10-23T12:46:57Z,0

For the last minute, I sat in child&#39;s pose trying to regain my breath and breath through my belly. Even though I didn&#39;t finish the practice, I think it was a good thing for me to reconnect to my breath.  Thank you, Adriene for creating these practices and for being with us throughout our yoga journey.",Michelle Janse van Rensburg,2019-09-29T18:44:14Z,1
"5th time on Day 7! Great practice, even though my back is sore I did the best I could today. I still have a crick in my left shoulder, I&#39;ve had it for over a month now. I&#39;ve never in my 53 years ever had a crick this long! Just when I think it will go away, it twinges and is still irritating! Thank you, Adriene for this 30-day journey! I&#39;ve dedicated to doing the rest of the year and beyond.  I think I am seeing changes in the exterior of my body, not sure. I&#39;ve never been a good judge of what I look like to myself. But I walk a little taller, sit up a little straighter, I feel tighter. Now the scale shows I am heavier, but I hope that is because I am adding muscle not fat!",Gina Rogers-Santos,2019-09-27T14:32:11Z,0

Some of my other favorite videos on your channel have those same flows in them, and they&#39;ve always been my favorite!!! &lt;3 I definitely feel yesterday&#39;s core work, yet somehow I feel it less after completing Day 7.

"As I ended with my Day 7 practice, I peacefully opened my eyes to find a spider dangling in front of my eyes. I initially got a fright and killed it (sorryyy 😱) but then I looked up the meaning of seeing spiders as I saw another spider earlier today dangling at my back door. Apparently seeing spiders means you need to, or are in the process of cultivating patience and becoming better in touch with your own energy! 💫 So I’ll take it as a good sign and message that my first week of this challenge concluded well 😂🤗😍",helzikinz,2019-05-15T19:03:23Z,0

"I have realized something in the last few days. I always hated working out because I always associated it to loosing weight. If I felt that I was starting to gain weight, I would restrict myself from eating everything I love and I would start working out. Than when I got the results- I would stop. So that has been an endless cycle for me- working out for a month every day and than not working out for moths. For the first time ever in my life I just want to &#39;work out&#39; for myself, to feel healthier and stronger. It feels so good to do something every day that I really enjoy and not think about the calories that I burned or the weight I am going to loose.

"You&#39;re so right, this really was the perfect remedy for day 6&#39;s soreness. I wasn&#39;t even able to keep up with everything from day 6 because I have such a weak core as of now, but I still woke up with very sore abs. This faster paced practice didn&#39;t give me time to think about how my abs felt, so I was able to push through without whining or stopping. And now almost all of my ab soreness is gone for the moment! <br /><br />I also broke a sweat for the second time this week, which is strangely satisfying. I think I had gotten too complacent and had only been choosing the calm and gentle practices before and I wasn&#39;t challenging myself, which means I wasn&#39;t growing. Only one week into this challenge and I already feel like I&#39;ve experienced growth and both my physical and mental strength are improving! Thank you again for doing this challenge!

"I&#39;m a little behind with this year&#39;s 30Days, (stomach flu for two weeks right after Boxing Day - grim!). I did this practice yesterday and LOVED it... so much so that when I came to do Day 8 today, I saw it was a yummy meditation session and decided to save it for tonight instead, opting for this fantastic wake-up with the sun again today. <br /><br />This is why YWA is so damn good. I&#39;ve been practising with Adriene for almost three years now and keep with it because I love how you can be flexible with it and go with what feels good;  Adriene, you&#39;ve taught me how to listen to my body, my mood, my energy, and adapt my practice to suit myself, so I can find what feels good each day. The results: a near-daily practice that has toned my body, honed my focus and improved my well-being. To anyone approaching these videos for the first time, you have found a real treasure. <br /><br />A thousand thanks to you, Adriene and Namaste. xx",Mark J Newton,2019-01-17T09:48:24Z,1

Maybe a good idea to let people know next time or they&#39;ll be hitting their tv with a shoe (or yoga block) to get it working again!  ;)",deadlypalms,2019-01-16T18:32:44Z,0

"My intention today was to integrate the wheat grass juice I&#39;d just drank (chlorophyll - pure sunshine!) into my energetic body (a new concept for me that I just love from Days 2, 4, and 5). I have a hearing loss and couldn&#39;t quite catch what Adriene said Surya means during the video. To my surprise when I looked it up - sun! Coincidence? I think not. Beautiful? Yes. Thank you so much for the gifts you give us, Adriene. As an added bonus, the next video YouTube queued up was your Yogi Tea video. There is now a pot of love brewing on my stove. It smells amazing.

"My intention was, “I am making progress.” I cried a little (joyous tears) and thought of “Here Comes the Sun” throughout the entire practice.<br /><br />I have often felt that what I accomplished was not good enough, especially when it came to things involving myself. But all of us need to love ourselves, care for ourselves, and applaud ourselves as each day we live. That’s an accomplishment in and of itself! I was able to make a single hop from the low lunge to standing at the front of the mat, today I made big progress and I celebrate. 👏🏼 <br /><br />You’ve got this everybody, you’re making progress just by showing up! ❤️❤️❤️",Harp Soup,2019-01-14T14:41:30Z,0

Will you advice answer comment ???<br />A short practice indeed to add to that o searched up beck and shoulder release as have some pain in right shoulder had a proper release with that<br />Coming to the practice I saw I could move well and more freely some of the poses could do it which I couldn’t do it earlier <br />But yes once the music starts playing that it’s the end on session I feel also oh no as said by someone else too in the comments <br />Love you friend Adriene <br />Thanks for helping us get fitter and better,Sonal Rao,2019-01-14T12:56:50Z,0

"I&#39;m a few days behind on Dedicate since I began late. But I would like to say that so far I&#39;ve felt much cleaner emotionally, I&#39;ve been dealing with the resurgence of old, unhealthy subconscious thoughts and impulses and this practice is really helping. My favorite thing about Adriene is that she doesn&#39;t try to come to the mat outrageously sexy and glammed out, and she works in simple spaces, so it doesn&#39;t feel like she is trying to sell us a luxury location, fashion, or a body type. I&#39;ve always been pretty confident in all of that, but I had to unfollow most of my Instagram yoga role-models because I began comparing myself to them, or my stuff to theirs, or my location to theirs. (Thats not to say that she isnt any of those things, she is absolutely beautiful, inside and out. Her soul radiates and makes her glow.) Much love 💕",Elaina Culpepper,2019-01-14T11:17:29Z,4

"Thank you Adriene! This journey continues to amaze me. Today I feel almost a complete 180 shift in my feelings and outward vibes--I stepped on to my mat feeling flustered and annoyed (some days the distractions in my house are much harder to ignore than other days...) and honestly just telling myself to get through the emotions to be done. But by the end, I did feel like I was actually dropping in and finding my flow and a more serene focus on the small and good things. I didn&#39;t think 17 min could help me work through negativity so well!!

"I am really enjoying this 30-day journey so far. It is my first time doing one of these and I am so excited to have made it through a week (I started late). The one improvement I would have made to this video is to have released it on a weekend. Where I am it is dark in the morning when I go to work and dark when I come home, and I would have loved to have the light streaming in the window while practicing sun salutations.",Gwendolyn Higgins,2019-01-11T05:50:11Z,1

"This was my favorite day so far! I’m two days behind and usually I rush and cram days together just to “catch up” and end up missing the importance of each day.

Im loving this practice and these comments are so positive, I’m just filled with so much love! Thank you, Adriene!🌻",Gigi Jones,2019-01-11T05:15:59Z,0

"Confidence through the roof now.  For some reason the video image cut out a few times, while the audio stayed.  Of course I panicked at first.  But then I realized, you got this!  It&#39;s Day 7 of this commitment, Day uncountable on this journey to wellness.  Close your eyes and trust.  So I literally kept my eyes closed for the whole practice.  Focused in on my breathing into the movement, allowing Adriene&#39;s voice to guide me in the background.

"In the last week I was struggling to find my way to Dedicate. Surya was the first day I truly enjoyed. I love sun salutations anyway, they help me switch off my monkey mind through repetitive movements. I am hoping that I have finally arrived in this. I’ve been with Adriene for more than 2 years now every day and she (and the way she practices and teaches yoga) helped me through so many things she cannot imagine.

"Just noticed this in the description, i think we all thought maybe this black out was intentional- and all so confused- but this makes sense now. Apparently it was a glitch in the upload??<br /> From Adreine &quot;NOTE: Your practice video seems to be experiencing some tech difficulties with this upload. It looks good on our end but it does goes to black a few times. The audio is still there so, keep practicing! I got you! &quot;------  Good to know- Namaste : )",Shawn Pool,2019-01-09T15:45:31Z,0
"I&#39;m adding the comment a day late, but this surya namaskar was awesome. We did this practice facing the windows and saluted the beautiful sun shining in our home. On the drive to work, the sun was sooo bright and so pure, for lack of a better word. It seemed so clean and unobstructed, and we couldn&#39;t help but know it was from our salute to that life force, the reason we get up and move every single day that changed the way we saw it and the way we felt it. Thank you, teacher!",J J,2019-01-09T15:44:42Z,0

"What a beautiful practice today (or tonight for me!). My intentions were to enjoy every second of these 17 minutes and to find clarity as it has been a rough and emotion past two days. I&#39;ve been watching Adriene&#39;s videos for years and never once tried to hop to the top of my mat, but today I went for it and was laughing and having so much fun. And by the end, I had a huge smile on my face and tears running down my face realizing everything was going to be just fine, no matter what twists my life takes. It still amazes me how much these practices heal me mentally. Could hardly believe it had been 17 minutes when the music started playing to end it out! And omg that first rise and forward fold! Who else felt that hard in their abs??? Mental and physical strengthening, how fantastic :)<br /><br />Thank you to Adriene and all you wonderful souls.

"Alright, Day 7 ! I’ve been rocking with you for a while now Adriene and it’s been a blast. First off, i 😍 the name “dedicate” for our 30 days yogi adventure, it’s a reminder for me, that ever day I am choosing what to be constant in; why not be intentional and choose something that will benefit my well-being. What you’re doing Adriene is truly making a difference in our lives , that’s why you had 9 Millie the first day of dedicate! 👍🏾🥰😇<br />What I really enjoy with this yogi session was the pace.  There wasn’t time to look at the screen which was GREAT because that allowed me To just listen while also focusing on my breathing and finding my flow. And as you said it’s not about being a robot and trying to make “yoga positions” it’s about finding what feels good to us as individuals! <br />Super happy for ya A, can’t wait until day 8!! 🥳",Laporshia Roberts,2019-01-09T04:32:23Z,0

I trusted my body that it was capable. And most importantly I trusted my mind that I could do it.

"Spent most of this practice in downward dog and extended child&#39;s pose. My body just wasn&#39;t feeling the fast pace of day 7.

"After reading the comments, I think I must be the only one really dreading the sun salutation videos. They are way too fast, I can’t memorize the sequence, after each forward fold I don’t know which move is next, up or down, and I keep getting lost, which just makes me feel inadequate 💔 As there is no time to adjust the position, my right knee is now quite sore from putting it on the mat in a haste in a wrong way.<br />Last year I quit after the sun salutation sequence, it felt like yoga class again and not really a home practice; this year I don’t think I’m quitting but this really did not make me feel good. I’m thinking... if there are more sequences like this one planned in the future, maybe I could substitute with something more doable? I’d rather do more core, or even legs 😂",Aldona Pikul,2019-01-09T00:52:38Z,0

This is the first time that I&#39;ve ever. ever. ever done yoga for a week straight. <br /><br />It&#39;s reached the point where I feel like I&#39;m reading a good book- <br />I wake up excited to have this new experience and find out what&#39;s in store for me.<br /><br />So grateful for the incredible amount of work and love that has gone into this. &lt;3,Kaitlin Franklin,2019-01-08T23:35:40Z,0

For the first time in 7 years of yoga, I was able to keep my fingertips on the floor during a halfway lift.

I notice my wrist have been hurting I know u said something bout your wrist hurting at the beginning but should I do anything to help with that I try to claw through my finger tips not sure if I&#39;m doing it right though. Also do you have any tips to help my hands from sliding I bought a new mat from amazon but they still slide lol I do have sweaty palms do u think that&#39;s why?

"my belly muscles were so sore from the practice yesterday that i was really afraid of starting today&#39;s practice. but i turned out to be wrong, there was no need to be afraid. i managed to go through the whole video and doing every pose. i even noticed that i&#39;m already stronger than on day one, especially in my legs and arms. my downward facing dog is already Way better after such a short time! something opened up for me today. i feel like a knot in my body and mind untied itself while doing today&#39;s practice. i started crying afterwards because i feel like i was able to let go of something. i faced my fear of failing at sports and overcame it by managing amazingly. something trapped inside me was finally freed today so i could let go.<br /><br />Thank you so much Adriene.",Kristoph R,2019-01-08T23:17:56Z,0

"I think I had a little breakthrough today (so much so that I&#39;m actually commenting). I hopped on the mat anxious and with my mind everywhere and worried I would struggle physically and mentally with todays practice but setting an intention to be open and kind with myself helped ease my mind and then we started and my body had an ease with the poses that hasn&#39;t been there so far. I was sweating but loving it, I even attempted a hop from dog for the first time on what ended up being the last dog. The practice flew by and I found myself a little bummed it was over.

Also found your message in the email about loosening my grip on something I could use backup on right now to be very relevant and encouraging. Dealing with a sick pet whilst also trying to finalize plans to go on vacation. The two seem at odds with each other but I have a capable accomplice here at home and I need to just let go and trust.

"My biggest challenge with Yoga is not to be mean to myself and my body. When my belly gets in the way of certain poses, I can feel these feelings of resentment, guilt and shame come up. Yoga is so much more mentality for me than it is physical. How do you go through the <a href=""http://movements.so/"">movements.So</a> today my mantra was &quot;I am free&quot; I am free from judgement against myself, I am free from fear and hate. I am free because I move out of love and not to punish myself. Hope you all enjoyed this practice too! Namaste from Switzerland ❤️",Mimi Dudli,2019-01-08T21:05:16Z,249

LOVED this one. Did it twice and the second time I set an intention to give it everything. It’s amazing how it can change a mere 20 minutes later. <br /><br />The fade to black segments are new- I honestly thought there was something wrong with my internet because out the corner of my eye I would see it go black and just hear the audio - have since realised that’s deliberate! It works though- you just listen to Adriene’s voice and trust your body. It’s so swift there’s no time to look at the video anyway!,Hannah Dupre,2019-01-08T20:54:30Z,0

"I didnt even notice the video going blank! haha my eyes are normally always closed anytime I&#39;m still in my practice. <br /><br />Thank you so much for this practice. I&#39;ve been having some anxiety this morning from some deep emotional stuff that came up the past 2 nights, stuff that is life changing and scary.  I&#39;m still fearful, which is ironic especially considering that the &quot;stuff&quot; is realizing that I keep myself on guard with anyone and everyone in my life out of fear. And when I&#39;m like this the last thing I want to do is meditate because I don&#39;t want to feel it or face it. But moving makes me feel better, it allows me to get away from my thoughts and the anxiety that comes with them and just breathe and move, feel my body. Then, during those still moments, I&#39;m able to face my anxiety a little at a time, like little sips, in a way I don&#39;t get overwhelmed. Thank you for making these yoga sessions versatile and changing things up. You always have a video for how I&#39;m feeling and what I need in that moment. You don&#39;t keep it just about the body and the stretch, but you&#39;re main focus is the mind. Thank you so much. I&#39;ll always be eternally grateful to you.",Merissa Kelley,2019-01-08T18:53:05Z,0

Yup my screen went black too. But I noticed it was mostly when mountain pose or quiet breathing. The word trust cane to mind. Perhaps the gods are teaching us all a little something.

"Today I am so grateful for all of you practicing with me and with each other. You are where I found the extra nudge I needed to show up for myself. I did an all nighter to study for an exam (which I think I passed, yay!) and truly doubted my body would be able to handle the practice. But I thought of all of you, many of you are probably tired as well, probably stressed as well. But you show up for yourselves, and for each other, and I wanted to do the same. I went in setting the intention to be kind to myself and committed to the practice, and once more my body surprised me: it was stronger than I gave it credit for. Thank you Adriene for this beautiful practice. Everytime you manage to surprise me! Now for a good, long night&#39;s sleep before waking up to day 8 tomorrow. I am excited already.

"I almost didn&#39;t practice today because I have issues with my left calf muscle/ankle burning and aching like hell when I walk or stand sometimes, I walk with a limp most of the time due to the pain. Just standing at the top of my mat at the beginning, my leg was shaking like crazy because it hurt so bad. But by the end, the burn/ache was almost completely gone. I did take some ibuprofen after the workout, too. Hopefully that&#39;ll help with the lingering pain.",Nikki,2019-01-08T18:41:49Z,0

We appreciate you Adriene. Oh i love the new setting you choose, Bengi looks so happy! It feels we are on a retreat with you. 😊<br />Love from Vancouver Canada.",annebourque79,2019-01-08T16:34:57Z,1

several black outs but because Adrienne&#39;s voice is so soothing and instructive I went with the flow...was this intentional teaching or technical difficulties?

"great short sun salutation practice. I like others though found the black screen to detract from the goal. Thought my computer was falling asleep or doing something extra wonky, because it sometimes does. The first time I thought I imagined it as I opened my eyes and the screen went from black to video. I have never noticed Adriene&#39;s videos edited this way in the past so I thought at first it was an error. Maybe a &quot;Close your eyes&quot; little reminder or something to just let the yogi know their computer is still alive 😂",Marjorie Sauer,2019-01-08T15:52:38Z,0

For beginners, it&#39;s a great intro into the practice. For slightly more advanced peeps, it&#39;s a great way to re-commit to an at home practice and maybe be inspired to practice further throughout the day. Yoga, man.

"The screen going black intermittently is aggravating.  It would have been better if Adriene gave us a heads up at the start (unless I missed something).  I know that forward folding is a key part of sun salutations but so much forward folding is not good for my bulging disc.

Last night I went to bed a little frustrated with personal and spiritual growth. I’ve been feeling as if I am missing something or that there is something more for me yet I cannot see it yet. <br />I had odd dreams as well. I know my body was trying to tell me something.<br />I woke up a bit down. Feeling either as if I am missing something or that part of me is just itching to get out. <br />I told myself to trust the process and stick to the practice today. <br />The practice was great. Yet I felt a bit anxious in my stomach. Right under my rib cage. I know things don’t change over night (haha besides waking up the way I did) but things like a eureka or a reveal upon waking of what I feel is next. <br />The sun hides today. It snowed and is cloudy. I will find ways to imagine it here to make me happy. <br />Everyone take care.,Leah Kelley,2019-01-08T13:37:56Z,0
@Leah Kelley Really glad to hear u were able to get to the root of the issue...u must feel so relieved :) I dont know anything about the solar plexus I&#39;m going to look into that :),Leona Isaac,2019-01-08T23:39:19Z,1
"So earlier I was feeling quite off last night and this morning. As an update about how I was feeling today, after this routine I looked into seeing if the anxious pain in my stomach was my solar plexus and the feelings I felt matched up perfectly. An hour after yoga the pain did actually leave and I happened to look in the mirror and declare “I am Leah”. Sounds funny. Lol. Then later I did find a binaural track for balancing my solar plexus and I felt warmth there with my hands. I also kept on sensing that I wanted to reach out and grab something. So hopefully I’ve recognized the issue and can move forward.",Leah Kelley,2019-01-08T23:16:24Z,0
Leona thank you. I am wondering if it is my solar plexus. I am going to try some balancing frequencies to see if that helps.,Leah Kelley,2019-01-08T17:47:10Z,0
"I can definitely relate to what you are saying about there be something more but u just cant see it yet and the frustration , I too feel like that alot, it also seems I have a mild depression, I have been using yoga to try and help myself maintain a sense of calmness and combat feelings stress and anxiousness. I wish the best on your journey and pray that you find yourself at exactly the place personally and spiritually where u ought to be and are meant   to be. Peace and love to ya 🤗",Leona Isaac,2019-01-08T15:42:21Z,1

I stopped halfway through both TRUE and REVOLUTION and I&#39;m heart-set on finishing DEDICATE in the 30 days! I surprised myself this morning by walking up before my alarm and getting to the mat before leaving for work (which usually is not a time when I can relax my mind), but Day 7 was just what I needed today!

"I experimented with the time that I did my yoga for the day and there is just nothing that compares to doing it at 4:30 am before the family starts to stir. It motivates me and sets the tone for my day. Not to mention, I get a lot done from 5 to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8KKL8qHVuY&amp;t=5m30s"">5:30</a> before the husband has to be up for work.<br />I also, will be doing yoga in the evenings.... The kiddos (3 and 1) like to participate and since I do my main flow in the morning I can accommodate them better lol. Blessed be and Namaste! ❤🌸",Christina,2019-01-08T11:16:05Z,0

"Is there a &quot;pre-yoga&quot; stretch routine that I can do before some of these sessions?  I have been having some lower back issues and after yesterday&#39;s Core routine (which I am certain I was doing all wrong because I could only feel it in my back and nowhere near my core) my back was super sore this morning, so all the forward folds and and lifts were brutal.  I don&#39;t want to inadvertently injure myself.  Any thoughts, advice?",Erin Dori,2019-01-08T11:10:57Z,0

I could go on for a long time seeing all the things I love… One thing I did not laugh so much today, there was the blank screen at times. A lot of the time I’m not watching anyway – just following your voice so when I peek and there’s nothing there, I think there’s something wrong with my connection! Then I get a bit stressed and start pushing buttons… Eventually I figured out this was when we should have our eyes closed to be going inward, but maybe a little music or something that would let us know that the Internet is still working would be a good idea!

"I was feeling very stressed and resentful (towards someone at work) this morning, and was not able to meditate, so after trying unsuccessfully to sit silently focused on my breath, I switched to this daily practice. I feel much relieved now :) I enjoyed these sun salutation flows. I must say my abs are making themselves noticed, especially during the upward dogs and cobra: yesterday&#39;s practice was a good way to signal that I need to work on... work WITH my abs more (i caught myself just in time then !). <br />I also noticed the screen go black a couple of times. The first time I paused the video, and saw in the comments it happened to others, but I wasn&#39;t going to leave that pertubate my flow ! I decided to take it as an invitation to close my eyes and focus on what I was feeling. Thanks for this ! I&#39;m looking forwars to the yummy DAY 8 ! &lt;3 <br />When I got here, there was 345 views, now there are 840.

"I quit again. I will continue to enjoy your videos, I just find that the structure of the 30 day program in real time doesn’t work for me. I need to be able to match my energy needs and start a 30 day when I feel up for it, rather than the beginning of the year. I’ve done several of the programs but never in real time so I was excited to try it. I’m glad so many people come together around it, for me I need to just choose when and what I’m up for.

@Naori I don&#39;t find her verbal descriptions to always be helpful. I&#39;ve done yoga before and am very athletic. But I am a very visual person and I like to do a quick verbal check sometimes on what she is doing. Having the screen go black mid-sentence with no verbal warning just makes it look like your computer is not working. Add to the fact that my internet WAS having problems this morning this became not a relaxing or flowing or anything yoga like time for me.,annmzli,2019-01-08T12:38:02Z,0
"margaret beasy the going black is meant for you to have your eyes closed, listen to her voice and notice your own breath<br />in these moments was no sense in looking at the video, as most of the times she says what to do and how to move. no need to look at the video. so TRUST yourself ;)",Naori,2019-01-08T06:50:10Z,9

Am putting aside what I think I know about how I want to feel, and trusting instead. Gonna lead me SOMEWHERE...... :-)",Kris Henley,2019-01-08T06:26:45Z,32

Did anyone else&#39;s vid go black a few times? or is it just my sorry tech at play?,Kris Henley,2019-01-08T06:24:12Z,127
Yoga With Adriene I liked it! It reminded me to really close my eyes and go inward.,Lauren Haas-Sulzer,2019-01-09T01:03:16Z,1
"Hi Kris! It&#39;s not you, it&#39;s me :) Technical difficulties today, but I LOVE the fact that some has taken it to be part of the process! What a beautiful community! XXOO",Yoga With Adriene,2019-01-08T20:07:05Z,3
"I like the intention of blanking out the screen (assuming it was creative choice).... but I found it distracting even after I figured it out, it still brought up fears of tech failure! LOL   Perhaps graying out or blurring the video could remove the visual queues and leave us worry free with Adrienne’s beautiful voice?",Alise Spence,2019-01-08T13:44:53Z,0
Thank you for saying that!  I was worried that there was something wrong with my computer! What a relief!,Mick Jagger,2019-01-08T12:40:38Z,1
"Kris Henley, Adriene believes in you. She trust that with time you will learn to trust yourself. I peaked once myself so that is how I saw the blackout but the moment I saw it I knew exactly what was intended. It’s about trusting yourself and self love. These practices really are a gift. ♥️🙏♥️",Voice of the Seraphim,2019-01-08T12:27:10Z,0

"I started doing yoga since I was 12 (I’m 21 now), I kept going back and forth not knowing if I like it or not if my body likes it or not. I didn’t really understood what was the point, how it was different from just exercise and why breathing was so much important.<br /><br />On the 1st of January I saw your day 0 and was like « what happens if I just start... » and I so I did. And after a few sessions I finally knew what does it mean « to focus on my breath »!!! I couldn’t be happier, idk what happened but at one point I just got it and kept doing that. And now in retrospective I can say that it took me almost 10 years to learn how to notice my breath and see what it does to my body and my soul.<br />This series has taught me one of the most important things in yoga and I’m so grateful 🙏🏻",katia balashova,2019-01-08T06:11:53Z,133
"Yoga and meditation has taught me to follow my breath, and I find myself following my breath outside of these practices as well, whenever I&#39;m getting overwhelmed or distracted! I feel more connected with my body, mind, and realtity as well! Cheers.",Nate,2019-01-08T20:45:47Z,3

I&#39;m so happy you&#39;ve decided to start yoga again. I had a very similar experience to yours a year ago when I found Adriene&#39;s videos.,Vilhelmiina,2019-01-08T10:12:07Z,5
Thanks tot charing! Unfortunately it comes at 7 in the morning in Holland. For me too late in the morning. As a start yoga at 6.30 for a long time. Is it possible to share of earlier? If not I will have to skip a day😊🙏😘,cinergie puntnu,2019-01-08T06:08:23Z,0
"Become a member of FWFG . That way you’ll get the videos (even) earlier. But if you do not want to, then you just do the video in the morning after. What difference does that make? Since we’re in all different time zones anyway there are always people practicing with you💖",SolYogi,2019-01-08T06:48:21Z,0
