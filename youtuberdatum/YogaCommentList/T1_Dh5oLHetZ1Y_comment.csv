"When it is challenging and my body is out of balance, it is hard to find stillness.  I used my breath to keep going and the collapse to the mat was sweetly rewarding. Loved the foot massage--so important to take time to care for my body and notice any changes.",LJ Grooms,2021-04-02T01:44:52Z,0

"This is just what I needed today, to shift inward and explore.🙏 I am going through some childhood papers and things at the moment and I was feeling very overwhelmed and found myself having a hard time parting with a lot of them. Today I am going to let go. And keep only the most precious💖 Thank you Adriene (and Benji🦴😁) for giving me support off the mat, too.",Eliška Č,2021-05-08T07:27:46Z,0

"Number 11 is the Master number that is related to Karma. This number is also a symbol of spiritual awakening. If this number keeps appearing very often by your side, it means that you should turn more to your spiritual life. You have your life purpose on this planet and you need to serve to others. Master number 11 is also called Teacher, which means that it can teach you lessons that are very important for your life.",Archangel Revelations,2021-05-05T02:11:40Z,1

"Hello! I am wondering if this is a form of yoga? I really loved taking the postures, aligning, and then hold for a while.

"Today i write my last final exam of high school and I couldn’t have started my day better &lt;3<br /><br />(Edit) Today’s practice was extremely refreshing, I’ve been doing yoga with Adriene for 57 day consecutively now and this was the first time I’ve laid in savasana at the top of my mat. It really shows how there isn’t any “fixed” to do yoga. I’ve started 57 days ago because I was trying to heal from the inside out and this practice ran through the duration of my final exam (I had my first exam when I was on Day 30 of the 2015 journey). I would NEVER trade this experience for anything else.

"I’m here at day 20 woo! 100% honesty, there have been days where I just wasn’t able to get to the practice for whatever reason, but I would keep with it and just do that practice the next day. I haven’t given up and I keep trying to get to the mat each day. I think sometimes it’s harder to get back to something once you’ve missed a day or two so I’m proud of myself for sticking with it :) don’t give up folks! Even if you miss a day. It feels so good to get back to it when you can ❤️",Ashley Mauerhofer,2020-07-28T13:09:22Z,0

I love how Adrienne teaches and encourages me to do the poses better or to move between them to make them more attainable -- she&#39;s a great instructor and I&#39;ve learned so much about yoga as well as about inner awareness.",shelliwsmith,2020-06-22T16:20:57Z,0
"I hurt myself with this one, ended up with a terrible strain to my neck shoulders and upper back that kept me away from all exercise for several days. I’m  in good shape but it was too much on those areas of my body and I’ve noticed that Adrienne often has poses that focus on one area of the body without resting or offering counter pose. Don’t get me wrong. I’m a  huge fan and continuing w the 30 days but much more cautiously. Doubt anyone will see this but wanted to give folks a heads up in case it’s useful.",Daisy Hernandez,2020-06-22T12:02:54Z,0

"Today’s stillness left space for emotions. I wasn’t expecting today’s practice to be what it was, and that got my mind thinking about expectations. I had a lot of expectations for the past year. I expected to have a great job, or at least a job I liked enough to get me to the great job I want. I didn’t get either. I expected to go on a big trip this spring, and to visit friends, but that was cancelled. I certainly didn’t expect the world to be as it is now. I expected it to be a fabulous year. As much as I can try to make the best of things, it still won’t live up to the fabulous expectations I had for it. Expectations hurt when things don’t go as expected. It’s so hard to let go of expectations. This year is certainly making me have to accept things rather than expect things. Until I can reduce how often I expect, I will be disappointed more often.

I did one of her upper back pain yoga before doing day 20, but woke up today (day 21) in a lot of pain. Do I drop off for now and just do her upper back videos?

Thank you Adriene you are a special person and the music of Yoga with Adriene will always be synonymous with my saviour and virtual friend during lockdown.

I feel so alone at this time and your wonderful practices have helped me to improve my self-confidence at a time where I&#39;m constantly with myself and my own thoughts.

Thanks to this lockdown i was able to finally be still and start my dream journey. I was really in the mood to get on the mat today but i did. This practice was a little difficult for me today. Maybe because i didn&#39;t have the enegry. but i still was able to go into boat pose with little to no struggle. the progess =),Chelsea M,2020-04-20T15:34:13Z,0

"Okay day 20! <b>breathing out</b> I&#39;m definitely becoming frustrated by my core strength....needing to pause and breathe many times while Adriene would shift from hip to hip, or between plank and cobra. But I know I need to meet myself where I&#39;m at! I think I need to refocus and remember that the goal of this is not be able to do a certain pose or movement, but to simply experience, breathe, and focus on the here and now.  Going to keep with this journey, and hopefully continue to grow stronger. I&#39;ve been writing a comment after each video along the way, as I feel like it helps keep me accountable :) Hope everyone is staying safe! &lt;3",musicsummer12,2020-04-19T17:01:36Z,3

"This might sound really stupid but... a bee flew into the room during this practice. I have always had an immense phobia of bees. I would get up from a dinner table and run away, scream and flail about and freak out in public if they fly near me (yes, I&#39;ve been told 1000 times to just be still, it doesn&#39;t help haha). And yet, when this bee flew in and I saw it land on the curtain, I just acknowledged it, dissolved any tension/stress within my body, and continued with my practice in stillness. I usually would have ran out of the room and locked the door, even if it was nowhere near me! But I shared my space with that lil bee (actually, it&#39;s pretty big), and it kindly stayed nice and silent... all the way until the final few moments, with our hands together taking our final few breaths together. My eyes were closed, it started buzzing, I couldn&#39;t see where it was going, what it was doing. My body started to tense up, but I relaxed into it, found the stillness, and finished up the practice. What an amazing experience for me!",Alice Giuditta,2020-04-08T14:50:36Z,0

"What a perfect session to soothe my sore muscles from the last few practices!  I was ready for something challenging, but this really hit the spot. It was challenging, but no so much in a physical way as a spiritual, emotional way. Never have I fidgeted so little in a session- my ADHD can make it tricky. I felt totally and quietly in tune in with myself- and that locust variation was hard! But I did it, and I also did boat pose with minimal to no fussiness in my body-- Yes!

To be connected to oneself. I was very focused on that session and it was as a renewal. I loved the massage, very good to start. It tones your mind and your muscles of course. And relaxing at the same time. I felt great and very motivated. Namaste.",Fanfan MentalistFictions,2020-01-29T00:26:21Z,0

"Wow, definitely felt my arms working, here!!! A couple of the moves (or well, poses) were a bit too hard for me. I did my best anyway and tried to return to as well as focus on my breath. Stillness can be just as delicious and relaxing as it can be difficult and frustrating. But today&#39;s session felt so, so good! Yummy as one would say hehe. The combo of challenging moves/poses and relaxing, peaceful poses was great. I&#39;m not used to doing that in your practices, at least not that I&#39;ve ever noticed. MORE OF THAT, PLEASE!!!! (it was like a new yoga layer)",Sarah S.,2020-01-23T21:35:14Z,0
Also - a general point for the northern hemisphere people - I always keep a light cheap blanket within reach so I can just quickly lay it over my knees when sitting or my middle when lying down. It’s just too cold to sit for very long (even with layers on) so the blanket really helps me to enjoy the reflective moments in comfort. I toss it aside once we’re off &amp; moving because then the heat arrives pretty quickly. It’s taken me 4 years to really sort this but I’ve got it down to a tee now. It’s just a lightweight IKEA cheapo fleecey thing. It works a treat &amp; is as essential as the mat. I’m 2 days behind (not too bad for me) but loving every single day.

I noticed how much it helped not only my body but also mind, soul and my self development.<br />BTW I noticed that sometimes when you are talking you say: Ok I stop now, shut up Adriene or you apologize. PLEASE DONT. This is what makes you and your chanel so special and friendly and this is why it feels like home. keep talking and sharing your amazing and funny and sometimes crazy thoughs with us.

It was my birthday yesterday started off with an interaction at the coffee place that lead to four hours of ruminating at home and anger and angry crying after my swim in the ocean with doggo then having cake and pizza with family and drawing and going for a long drive to soothe myself followed by more leftover cake and skipped yoga but  I&#39;m excited to be back todayyy yayyy might even eat a piece of Brocolli,Down to Mars,2020-01-23T02:43:17Z,2
"WELL, f&#39;ck a duck, I came to the mat expecting something easy and definitely had some struggle bus moments...what I noticed in stillness was that I overate at dinner, ha! Also, my feet were stiff as heck! <br />Yesterday&#39;s balance practice was wonderful, with winter sunlight filtering through the windows. I felt embodied in a specific, transcendent way -- you know, when you hit that flow and it has the quality of poetry about it... <br /><br />How fascinating that the different ways we move our bodies can bring out such different things! <br /><br />I&#39;m going to try to go back to doing these in the mornings - I draw more out of the experience when I do that instead of sticking to the williest of nilliest commitments... &quot;well, I know I&#39;m going to do it, so I&#39;ll just figure out when later!&quot; Eek. I&#39;m fairly comfortable being on-the-fly and try not to fight too much against my true nature, but I also know that it hasn&#39;t always served me. <br /><br />So here&#39;s to finding balance within the discipline. To finding stillness within the discipline. The imagine bouncing around in my head is a box and within that box, the ability to play -- like the idea that creativity thriving within boundaries, and as Adriene says, freedom within the form. <br /><br />Glimmers of understanding gained each day! And for right now, a mind that&#39;s ricocheting around a bit and the brain monkeys shaking their fists, going &quot;what are you even trying to SAY, woman,&quot; but gratitude for the space, even if it&#39;s just to rambleflect (reflect in a ramble-y sort of way), and namaste to all!",Grace Kim,2020-01-23T02:09:32Z,0

Loved still - grounding and resting in poses feels so good in the body and as challenging to stay in and feel as a strong vinyasa practice.  All that rooting allowed that natural lift in the body to be liberated rather than forced. A very late practice as the day slipped through my fingers.

Through YWA I have learned to LOVE a self foot massage! So much so that I keep a little pot of foot cream next to my mat so I can spend a couple minutes at the end of practice loving my feet 🦶I let out an audible yay today when finding out we were starting practice with my favourite bit! Although the cream did make my downward dog a little slippery.. 🧘‍♀️,sjislovingdchpcde,2020-01-21T23:15:16Z,0

This is real self care. Massage was excellent to start with. I should frequently spend quality time for yoga and self care. More would be better too.

"Stillness was hard for me today. I came to the mat angry at the world, at myself over things that happened during the day. So sitting still with that energy was hard. And when Adrienne said to let go? That was even harder. I don&#39;t think I totally managed. I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s called a practice. If at first you don&#39;t succeed, try and try again. Thank you, Adriene for showing up and helping me show up. Even when it&#39;s hard.",mayelaar,2020-01-21T22:49:11Z,0
"Good evening! I enjoyed todays practice because it allowed me to realize that when you said &#39;&#39;stronger,faster&#39;&#39; in the end. Thats definitely where I tend to go straight for when doing my practice. This has become a way of life in terms of showing up everyday and really being present with what you said. I lost my job shortly before I found this yoga journey. I was very exhausted. I had been practicing yoga but always really paid attention to little things like the teachers voice but my dear you have the most soothing voice! I also loved being able to pull the legs up with the arms and hands in the lift up pose you did. I did day 18,19 and 20 today. Its amazing that this has become a part of my day and its amazing to realize thats all it takes is to show up and enjoy something. On the way to developing good habits! This practice has saved my life~<br /><br /><br />Namaste<br />&lt;3",Amber Rose LOVE,2020-01-21T22:42:36Z,0
"Thank you so much for this Adriene. I never understood the phrase &quot;home is where the heart is&quot; until I started this journey. I now know that home is me and everywhere I go. I&#39;ve never been so consistent with yoga. I did miss one day (the first day of that* time of the month can be painful and my body told me to be still)  but the next day I did two videos back to back. My body is strengthening and I feel so powerful.  I plan on doing yoga every day for as long as I can. You are such a light Adriene and I feel at peace when I watch your videos.

It is a practice where I cultivate the ability to stay present and alert, be the best version of myself while staying calm and collected.

"My whole entire life I’ve always tried to make myself smaller, if it wasn’t weight it was the amount of space I would take up, or quieting my voice. Or even trying to physically make my bone structure smaller by never fully stretching my body and just crushing myself into a ball. With all that being said, doing yoga with you everyday has helped me start to learn to take up more space. To allow myself room to grow. It’s so crazy but today was the first time I felt my entire pelvis touch the ground while in Sphinx pose ( you said to widen our legs to allow more room and once I did my pelvis opened up.) it felt so good. Just thank you so much. I will never go back to not doing yoga daily.",Nadia Nanette,2020-01-21T20:58:37Z,73
"Today&#39;s practice flew by, I felt like I only just rolled out my mat when it was over. But that&#39;s good I guess. I am becoming better these 30 days at accepting that, besides what I can get better at, there are certain things my body just can&#39;t do, and that&#39;s okay. I am adjusting some poses so that they are less heavy on my shoulders, without the negative thoughts, and thereby avoiding pain and not being able to move in the days after. I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re in the 20s of the 30 days already, I could do this all year (of course I will still be doing yoga everyday once this ends, as always, but this is different).",Eline Castelijns,2020-01-21T20:41:20Z,0

Also had a good cackle as “willingness to touch yourself” 😂😭🤭<br /><br />One of the things I love about these sessions is that in the ‘still’ moments, just behind the quiet, you can hear Adriene‘a heart beating through her mic.

Today I came to the mat with a heavy and cracked heart. My body and soul were restless all night and all morning. It felt lovely just resting for a moment. Listening to what my body needs from me. I feel the love I should have fully given to myself for the past year. Namaste &lt;3,Raynebow 528,2020-01-21T16:15:56Z,7
"Well, over the years, actually through my entire life I noticed this common thing:  - You are so still. - Oh, my goodness, you are so still, I wish I could do so! - Come on, light up some fire, you are so still. - No no, harder. - Hey, faster. - How could you be so still? - Come on, move. - She is so still. And so on, and so on. Sometimes, these comments made me feel sick... You know what I&#39;m talking about? That chamber of stillness was my place to survive hard times... Today, after years spent to unravel the mystery of that chamber and to understand what that was all about, I can say - Oh stillness, I love you in so many ways.

"Hopped out of bed this morning and did this one in my pjs, thinking it would be a cozy session. Well, should have taken the “core warning” seriously!

Day 20! Slowly getting back to the routine I had at the beginning of the journey: waking up before 6 am to complete the practice. And Still was a great one to wake up for. A great reminder that listening and being is enough.,Cara Laviola,2020-01-21T11:12:51Z,0
"I have never committed to and stuck with any type of practice for 20 days. I am SO proud of myself to say that I have not missed one single day. The first 15 days or so I was fitting the practice in at night before going to sleep. Now, I am waking up earlier each morning to get it in before I get ready, before I get my coffee, and what a difference my body and mind feels. Thank you so much for sharing your heart and home with us. Self love is exactly what I&#39;ve needed. I&#39;m so happy to be sharing this experience with you and this entire community.

Good morning everyone. Today I woke up with a headache and it was hard to go to the mat.  I made it and made the practice my own.  The way I was feeling and the stillness practice was perfect because that’s all I could do was be STILL. Thanks Adriene,Rolanda Wilkins,2020-01-21T11:09:23Z,0
"hmmmm an enlightening practice today. I have always struggled with yoga like this though today when in the spinx pose the heat that was building was a nice one. I really felt my hips and back heat in a nice gradual way. The hip side to side rocks were interesting, my breath had to change to help my core which made the sensation build. The guide to lift the hips up and long energetically in downward dog is helping to add softness in my wrists. Hope you all enjoy this type of yin yoga practice. Thanks Adriene and Benji :)",Nicole O Scott,2020-01-21T11:08:47Z,0

"Adriene, Im having some issues with my wrists, mainly my left wrist, and i think likely due to an elbow fracture 5 years ago.  Anyway ive  watched all your hand placement videos and ive also got instruction from my teacher in my class, but depsite my best efforts to stay gripping in the fingertips and suction cupping the hands i still seem to slip back into the wrist and now its really starting to hurt and affect my yoga practice. im feeling quite sad about it and not sure what to do? i think its ultimately a wrist weakness not a placement issue.",Amelia Conway,2020-01-21T10:14:23Z,0

"This practice brought a peaceful clarity. I woke up this morning feeling scared, anxious about not just my day but my whole life. I was tempted to not allow myself the time to practice today - ‘it’s a yin style practice, I won’t be burning calories or toning muscle’ - but I committed and showed up. What I burnt was my anxiety, and what I toned was my selfawareness. Lying in shavasana I felt a wave of guilt and quietly said to myself ‘I’m sorry’; I then replied ‘it’s ok’, and you know what? It actually was. I can find stillness, and I deserve peace. Thank you Adriene 💖",Phoebe,2020-01-21T09:47:16Z,714

"Looking for a tip! Does anybody elses hands <b>slide</b> when they’re in downward dog? I try to ‘grip’ my hands onto the mat and I never actually fall, but when I’m in the position I can’t relax that much cause I feel like I’m slipping 😂 x",georgia victoria taylor,2020-01-21T06:56:41Z,0
"I agree with the first 2 comments that it could be a mat issue. I had a new mat that was quite slippery + warm studio meant I didn&#39;t feel very stable in down dog (and even some of my warriors). A towel for my hands definitely helped.<br />These days, I practice with the same mat w/o the towel because the slipperiness has subsided, but find that some days, I still feel some slide in my hands for down dog. It seems to have something to do with the wideness of my dog, front to back. If I bring my hands and feet closer towards each other just a <b>smidge</b> it helps. Plus, double checking that I&#39;m rotating my elbows &amp; upper arms out.<br />These days, I don&#39;t have much of an issue with slipping and if I do, I can pretty quickly correct it. <br />Good luck!",Jaimie J,2020-01-22T05:39:00Z,0

Day 20! Good morning/evening everyone!!!!! In my busy hectic life it’s not easy to take the time to be still. Today was simply lush remaining still and focused and to empty my mind of all thoughts of the coming day. I feel like I’m starting the day with a blank canvas. Thank you 🙏,Jules Thomas,2020-01-21T06:29:18Z,28

"2/3 of the way there everyone. I&#39;m on the mat and ready for action. This one looks delicious to do on a &quot;lazy&quot; day. I&#39;m just fascinated of how much of roller coaster 2020 has been so far in this first month. Love the yummy positive vibes, Adriene. It really gets me thinking deeply about how much my body needs this sort of self love. We&#39;re nearly home everyone. Time for some gentle self love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2020-01-21T06:07:09Z,252
