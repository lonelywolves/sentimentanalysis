"Hello everyone!  One week in the books! <br /><br />Often when we are met with challenges or when we feel stuck, we feel like we have to work harder, push harder, so today is a beautiful reminder to relax, lean in, and find a softness and an ease.<br /><br />Enjoy this moving meditation. An opportunity to get un-stuck. Lean in and get your sway on.",Yoga With Adriene,2019-01-09T14:05:54Z,478

"I feel like I didnt do much to unload some bad/sad tgoughts passed before &amp; during the session. BUT, with yoga as long as you have an intention, no matter what your were doing, you ARE doing it right. Or at least thats what I hope for 🙈 . I was stiff for this session but it was nice to enjoy the privilege of silence... Thanks Adriene! Peaceful mind to all. Namaste... 🙏",Delan Mezban Abdullah,2020-02-28T07:31:37Z,0

I think this is the best day 8 video you ever made. I keep coming back to it once in a month or 2 months. It&#39;s a secret joint opener and always makes me feel fulfilled. such an experience.,Rahime Alsanğur,2021-04-25T19:04:56Z,0

"I think sometimes I just want a reassuring voice to be with me as I feel all the feels, because not a lot of yoga happened this morning, but tears and just really dropping into some layers of grief did. I kept trying to come back to the yoga but in the end held myself as I cried. And I didn’t feel as alone having Adriene gently talking... holding the space. <br /><br />I know I’m one of literally thousands, but the ‘friendship’ — friendly space that I find here with you...feels safe and good and held! Thank you 🙏🏼 🙏🏽",F • I • O • N • A,2021-04-18T22:32:50Z,1

When I laid on my back all my vertebrae decided to sing a song... I literally felt my back just release in that moment.. I also know that my hips are super tight so had to bring the floor up to me so I used my yoga blocks to help. But a very nice practice today.,Jacki Siddall,2021-04-09T10:30:14Z,0
Thank you Adrienne yes the Crown is brilliant! Your yoga videos are fabulous! I did have difficulty with the exercise today as seem to be unable to put my legs folded like that and lean forward without pain. I could not even get to my forearms but I just did what I could maybe I need to practise this one more. I truly enjoy starting my days with your videos!

"I just remembered doing this one a couple of years ago,  it looks like it’s going to be a nice gentle practice,all soft and whatnot.  But, for me it is one of the hardest of the whole 30 days.  It just lets me know how the years have tightened up my body, I can’t bend into any of the relaxing postures at all.  Never mind, just have to stick with it and hope.",Richard Whitfield,2021-03-12T09:17:16Z,0

Your practices help me not only in my body health journey, but also in my self love experience. To not judge myself during the practices is much more easier task for me now! Thank you!! PS. And when I put the blanket ander the knees in the end of the practice and lay on the pillow I&#39;ve just felt as I&#39;m on a message session.

"...........  Fibroid Treatment ........... As a sign of gratitude to Dr. Taiwa Abu for how he completely cured my wife from fibroid, I decided to reach out to those still suffering from this Disease.  My wife suffered from fibroid for more than 6 year of marriage after our first son and it was really tough and heartbreaking for me because she was my all and the symptoms were terrible, she had irregular and painful menstrual flow and the size of it was 6cm, and she always complain of stomach pain. We tried various therapies prescribed by our neurologist but none could cure her. I searched for a cure and I saw a testimony by a woman from the UK who was cured and so many others with similar body problems, and she left the whatsapp number.. +2349047218377   of the doctor who had the natural cure for fibroid. I never imagined fibroid has a natural cure if not surgery not until i contacted him and he assured me my wife will be fine. I got the herbal medication he recommended and my wife used it as instructed by  Dr.Taiwo , and,after 4 weeks we went to the hospital for a scan and the doctor confirmed that there is no trace of fibroid and now she is fully okay, even up till this moment she is so full of life. fibroid has a cure and it is a herbal cure contact  doctor,  Dr. Taiwo Abu for more information about this natural treatment.......<br />you can contact Dr. Taiwo by:<br />Email: drtaiwoabu@gmail.com ..... OR<br />Call/WhatsApp him on: +2349047218377",Liam Wilson,2020-12-27T07:55:36Z,0

"Adrienne you are incredible.  I have battled plantar fasciitis in my left foot for over 3 years, constantly trying to &quot;stretch it out&quot;, as well as to understand that the issue could be traced back to the network of muscles from my back and hips all the way down to that band of tissue past my heel. Meditation today showed me that my entire left side of my body is much more tight and constricted, and will need lots of attention to be where my right side is on a normal day. <br /><br />Thank you for everything you provide, both physically and spiritually, to those of us on this journey.

"I have practiced yoga for years, but more recently doing it on a daily basis (Day 49 today!). I can&#39;t believe how transformative these Day 8s have been for me in the May 2020 calendar. Today is Friday and even for a short 4-day workweek, it&#39;s been rough lately as an essential WFH employee. It was May Gray all day today, but at 6 pm when I started my yoga session, the sun peaked, I heard the birds chirping and as we got into a comfortable position with our legs propped on a blanket, my eyes teared with no warning.

"Hello Adriene &amp; everyone. I found this challenge a year ago (around the time it was publishe I guess). Back then I was going through a very difficult time. 2019 was the worse year of my life for me and for my family. I thought back then  I need to do this I need to do this. And here I am, after a little bit more than a year later, I AM DOING IT. My day 8 to feel Great! Love to you all. Namaste... 🙏",Delan Mezban Abdullah,2020-02-28T07:25:03Z,0
Day 8 is in the books!! I absolutely loved this practice!!! I was stuck and hadn’t practiced in a few days. This practice totally loosened me up. When Adrienne said “I love you” at the end of the practice I found myself saying it right back to her. I hope one day I can help people like Adrienne does in my own special way. 🙏 namaste.,Up Graide,2020-02-17T06:51:59Z,0

Just finished this one. Crossing legs and folding forward was a huge challenge - now i realise how tight my hips are. My knees wouldn&#39;t touch the floor. But then - i felt burning in my lower back. And by the end of practice while laying down relaxing - it was just hurting with discomfort (my lower back) :(( i wonder what did i do wrong. Cause i want to repeat that position regularly hopefully to open up my hips fully. any advice? thank you!,Anastasiia Kirilik,2019-12-01T20:41:49Z,0

"I first started this yoga practice / journey back in March. I loved it and have continued daily (following different 30 day journeys) until I went away for 4 weeks in October. I missed doing the yoga, and so,  on my return tried to go straight back  to the  True 30 day journey, but found my heart wasn&#39;t in it. So I came back to Dedicate where I started and have fallen for it all over again and remembered why I am doing it. Thank you Adriene for reminding me that this practice is time for us  to just be and to just feel. I am gaining something more this time round. You are doing something so good for so many people.

Hi Adrienne I just want to say hi. I have never exercised before and I started meditating first and then I decided to try it. I went on you tube with people with personalities I didn&#39;t g=feel comfortable with. I am a 44 year old woman with type 1 diabetes on an insulin pump who is rapidly gaining weight. 3 months ago my 21 yr old baby had her 3rd brain tumor and surgery. I have no family help and she&#39;s staying with me in my tiny apartment because she has so many complications she can not be on her own . Between all this an unhappy boyfriend and a super stressful job I look forward every day to my time on the mat with my new best friend. I never new how to even leave a comment but I wanted you to know how needed you are. My neck used to click like six times when I rolled my neck and now it doesn&#39;t at all. I pray I can finish the coming episodes as it gets harder. But thank you Adrienne.,jurkh2,2019-10-25T03:01:11Z,0

"First of all: Thank you so much for your loving instructions. I hadn&#39;t been giving my body what it needed. After a brain tumor was removed, I was forced to retire. I&#39;m 65 years old. I started the 30-day journey in January of this year. It&#39;s October and I&#39;m finally on Day 8 LOL. I practiced the day from the series, then did the Foundations necessary to build the strength and understand better what I needed to be doing. I&#39;ve had breaks with normal illnesses and find that I still have the strength. Today I realized how much I still need the stretching exercises. So, I plan to do more foundation practices until I can do this one with less pain. Before my Yoga with Adriene, I would walk into walls, trip over tiny bumps in the sidewalk. I&#39;m a head person and hadn&#39;t really felt the rest of my body. A few will recognize what I&#39;m saying. Thank-you for helping me to become grounded and to be able to feel my feet and legs when I walk.<br />Again: I&#39;m looking forward to the journey ahead of me and am grateful for where I am today.",Barbara Flegel,2019-10-05T10:09:38Z,9

You are your own architect of your life👌🌈 my mom always told me I was good enough and I was strong, but it only hit me at 22,, my whole life people told me I was stupid and slow and it took a huge toll on my self a steam... So bad that I told myself I was lower than other people... And I won&#39;t achieve great things.... Well look at me now.... 22 doing yoga still havnt figured my life out yet but I will one day I won&#39;t give up, never give up on yourself.",Enise's Journey,2020-07-18T05:20:29Z,8

"Thank you! I&#39;ve been &quot;dedicated&quot; for three weeks yet on day 8. I&#39;m determined to follow through to day 30. Today&#39;s theme was right on time.

I started Dedicate this month and as always I love it Adriene you are such a blessing to bring yoga in my home where I feel connected to you and everyone else practicing. <br /><br />I felt so uncomfortable during this practice. It was extremely difficult for me but I kept telling myself Do what you can. There was lots of tension and pain in each posture/pose and I have no clue why! Either way I honor how my body responds to each video/practice we do. Thank you💕💕💕🙌🏽🙌🏽,Sarina Irizarry,2019-07-19T03:34:22Z,0

Today made me feel more out of shape than usual. I actually found the regular day practices to be easier and more relaxing.  Sitting in cross legged position for more than a minute is very uncomfortable and often painful for me. I have to switch to straight legged or my feet together.  I did my best though and I&#39;ll get there.,Kelly Manalo,2019-06-24T13:48:08Z,8

"This was so far the most challenging day body-wise! That stretch!!! Slow movements uncover in a most beautiful and merciless way how our body is being neglected and uncared for and bring awareness to the parts of my (divine!!!) body, like that massive stretch of my back while leaning down - it was a tortutre, but at the same time - a revelation: so, is it you, my back? Hi there, it has been so long since I last felt you and had contact with you! Thank you for this day Adriene, it was amazing and has opened new spaces of conscious exploration of oneself.

"This one was ON POINT. Been working out the whole week (leg day on wednesday and got super sored) and needed some heavy relax/stretching practice, so it couldn&#39;t come in a better time. <br /><br />Two more things: <br /><br />1 - it felt like 8 minutes, not 28. Amazing.<br />2- I have two cats that fight and play like there&#39;s no tomorrow, but when I practice they get super relaxed and sleep around me.

I was wondering if anyone could offer some advice! When Adriene says to lay your backs flat on the mat and adjust our hips to do so I can never really get my back flat. Am I misunderstanding or doing something wrong?

Hi Sweet @Adriene I Love this one. I&#39;ve come back to it 3 times while finishing the dedicate journey. There is another meditation one you did a few years ago that I listen to almost daily. When I come back to this one it seems shorter and shorter. COULD you and your team do like a hour long one???

"hey Adri.. I ve been practising for 3 months now everyday and sometimes twice,and recently Ι had a fracture on my right quadriceps and I cant, Not to practise daily at this point so I just meditate and do again your more down tempo practises. But until I can get back on the horse can you recommend a routine I can practise to heal or not that heavy routines cause I am an addict and I need my daily fix.. :)",Kicxs Javu,2019-03-28T18:40:05Z,0

"Dear Adriene, as I am going on this journey as the start of doing yoga, I have felt amazing. This past week was so wonderful and I felt a happiness I didn&#39;t feel in a long time. At the same time, I am doing great things in my life, facing fears and being productive and doing awesome. But then today was the first time I cried during the practice, I cried really hard. Maybe because my legs hurt a lot in the cross legged position with one foot in front of the other, maybe because I was struggling and I wanted to be able to do everything, maybe because all the happiness of this week finally let some old pains and fears and sadness through that still had to come out. And then you said &quot;I love you, namaste&quot; and I cried again because of pure happiness and gratitude that you took me on this journey and you help me find a new part of me which I love so incredibly much. Thank you so much for everything. I love you, namaste",Judith,2019-03-24T20:42:43Z,2

"Hi Adriene,<br />I never post comments on videos, but I wanted to thank you. I&#39;ve been having a lot of issues with depression and anxiety recently. I decided to start doing yoga daily and was lucky enough to find this playlist. It&#39;s helped me so much. <br />I really needed this practice to help slow down my thoughts. Yesterday was really difficult – my school had a shooting scare and it&#39;s been really tough to see everyone around me affected, even if nothing really happened. This video helped me relieve the anxiety I&#39;ve been feeling all weekend because of it, and I really just wanted to thank you for that. <br />Have a good day, everyone.",CCX,2019-03-17T23:51:29Z,73

For the past year, I&#39;ve been on a rollercoaster of emotions, I feel like life is really trying me.

Does anyone else experience a sharp pain behind the kneecaps when you pull your legs in for sukhasana (the same pain also shows its ugly face when I do the pigeons pose. Grr)? How do you get around that or what are some good alternative poses to help stretch those hips?  I don&#39;t want to end up hurting myself. <br /><br />On another note:  The Crown is so good!

I worked on this some yesterday.. or on core day?... and I was able to help it soothe into the ground, but I couldn&#39;t today.

"Day 8! Sticking with it over a month after most people. :) I found today and yesterday both went by much faster than their length would suggest. I seriously thought it was only about half way done each time when the end came. I&#39;ve done most of these 30 days of yoga series and haven&#39;t had that happen before.<br /><br />Also, while I have done a fair amount of yoga in the past, I&#39;ve done almost none in the last year. It started with an injury and then fear of re-injury and then just habit. It&#39;s so nice to get back into the habit, but also humbling to see how much flexibility I&#39;ve lost. I won&#39;t get it back without sticking with it, though, so onward!",Nicholina,2019-02-12T16:16:30Z,0

"I had a huge hungover today and obviously felt like shit. I was doing hungover remedies all day that usually work for me but today they weren&#39;t. I realized I hadn&#39;t practice since Friday(2 days) and came to the mat, almost apologetic for feeling the way that I did, and just taking the time to just breathe and meditate took away all those bad feelings. It&#39;s like the mat absorbed them before I even surrendered myself completely. Thank you for your guidance! 🙏❤️",Michelle A. Carrasco,2019-02-11T03:01:41Z,0

"WOW. I don’t know if I’ve ever felt such profound peace and grounding from a single meditation session before. It’s been about 45 minutes since I completed Day 8, and I’m still entirely blissed out - breathing slowly and deeply, smiling gently, walking taller and moving my body more intentionally. Without even trying, I’m finding a level of presence that I usually have to work for... I’m deeply aware of the smell of the soap on my hands, the sounds of my knife slicing through an apple, the glistening of snow on the tree outside my window. I’ve been practicing with Adriene since close to the beginning, and I always feel amazing after YWA, but this is a whole new level! <br />I’m taking part in this 30 day journey a month and some change after the fact, and it feels like it came into my life at exactly the right time. I couldn’t be more grateful for my morning YWA + hot coffee routine. <br /><br />Also, I put some peppermint oil in my diffuser today and set it close to my mat, and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Talk about breathing deeply! Highly recommend. Anyway, so grateful for this journey and this community. Adriene, thank you for the peace you help me find within myself. 🙏",Gretchen Hathaway,2019-02-10T17:24:39Z,1

It’s like Adrienne knows just what I (and we) need! I’ve had a horrible flu the past two days and it’s the first time I’ve been this sick in years. But I saw yesterday’s video was only 17 minutes long and knew I could do it. I had about an hour where my fever abated and I had energy so I took it to do yoga since I haven’t skipped a day this year! It was quick and easy-breezy which was refreshing. I was troubled when I saw how long this video was and wasn’t sure if I felt up to it. But the sweat pants and pillow and blanky? Yes! That’s been my entire aesthetic for the day. This was the perfect practice for someone who is tight from the flu and needs to relax. Although breathing out of my stuffy nose didn’t happen and I definitely dripped a ton of snot every time we leaned our heads forward 😅 just what my achy back needed!!

It almost felt like I was in your class with the sound of your voice. I also love the view you have ( so envious lol) outside your house! Thanks again.,John Yoo,2019-01-30T04:33:07Z,0
"It&#39;s funny because today, I did my yoga in the evening instead of the morning. And I noticed such a difference in my level of anxiety and frustration throughout the day and I was like dang...7 days down and it&#39;s already made such a difference. I got home and I was tired and depleted..but determined. It turned out this was just what I needed after a long hard day 💛",ragingphoenixart s,2019-01-30T01:42:28Z,2
"Dear Adriene, I have been practicing with your videos sporadically since my friend recommended me your channel last year. I just wanted to say I&#39;ve been really grateful for this community and your work. I&#39;m in my final year of university and have been and am struggling to be diagnosed with a conditions/disease that has changed my life this past year - I had to quit the activities I loved, and I often feel stuck and worthless as I try to push through the fatigue and pain to graduate. I&#39;m trying to stay strong and this yoga journey has really helped me do that physically and mentally. I might not be as physically strong as I once was, but I hope rest will help me recover and become stronger in another sense! I keep coming back to this practice as sometimes you just need to stretch and release - thank you for sharing this video with me - with us! Much Love!! Thank you all for making me feel a little more strong!",May Kyaw,2019-01-29T21:23:28Z,9

"This is my first time commenting and I am behind but that&#39;s okay because I&#39;m here!  I just did day *8 directly after 7 and it was perfect.  I feel so much love for all of you and myself right now and my husband.  He and I had a morning where we were loving each other but not getting each other and could not communicate without getting frustrated and it was like can we take a break from talking for a bit but still be cool - know what I mean?  Anyway, day 8 will be perfect for him mentally and physically today AND I think and hope get him perfectly stoked to join the Dedicate 30 day challenge.

It&#39;s 8:35pm and I had to make myself tune in to today&#39;s practice. I&#39;m so glad I did. Those seated stretches really hit the spot.

"you know, i&#39;ve seen a lot of other people post here about having some big emotional release from their practice and i never really got it. i was skeptical. today though, something about that pillow movement just released something in me or maybe around me. idk if hugging the pillow reminded me of something, or if i quite literally squeezed the emotion right out, or if breathing in all that love reminded me just how loved i am purely because i exist, but boy if i didn&#39;t find myself crying into my pillow! i&#39;m not sure this was the intended consequence but it definitely serves as a reminder to listen to myself and listen and be comforted by the energy that&#39;s all around us. thanks adriene!",ash cartagena,2019-01-24T21:59:14Z,0

I put off my yoga for two days when I saw this was a meditation because I was like “mrraa I wanna stretch though”. Counterintuitive since I didn’t do any alternative practice or exercise either day but today I got on with it with the thought of progressing past this practice and back into real yoga tomorrow. This duffer had forgotten there’s something to be learnt in going in without expectations. It’s all yoga! And it was super yummy.

So I came in and thought &quot;I already hurt, not sure that the flexibility I barely have is going to do well after falling.  But it was Day 8 and it was a perfect practice for my body.  Now I totally agree with many, my hips are tight!  I could barely get my forearms on the ground.  Even so, at the end I did feel a relaxation that I hope continues through the evening.  <br />PS I love The Crown!  Impatiently waiting for season 3!",TCcards,2019-01-22T22:21:55Z,0

"It&#39;s currently 1am in England and I just finished up with the practice, for the whole 8 days this has been going on (for me) I have made myself do every practice. <br />Some days I&#39;m way too hyper to function properly, sometimes I&#39;m way too bored or out of it. Today it was late, I had just finished watching crazy rich Asians and I was ready to go to bed, but I made myself get up off my sorry ass and do the meditation practice for today. I lit a candle grabbed two pillows, closed my eyes and listened to Adriene&#39;s voice.<br />I was supposed to be trying (emphasis on TRYING) to write the first chapter of a book I&#39;ve been wanting to write for years now, but instead, I did this, cause why not? <br />I started doing yoga cause my mum said I should (she&#39;s Chinese so she was basically saying I was getting a little chubs and should work out more) so I did and it landed me here, to Dedicate. and let me tell you its super duper hard for me to dedicate to anything. but I&#39;m trying, so let&#39;s hope it works out.<br />Have an amazing day my lovelies and I hope to see you again tomorrow!<br />hearts and kisses<br />~Ange",Angelina_ Allanson,2019-01-21T01:15:49Z,3

Didn’t do the practice in the morning like I normally do and just felt crappy. Finally got to this video tonight and wow! It all worked out. I needed this tonight! So perfect. Sometimes I feel like you’re in my mind because you speak the thoughts in my head. You say what I need to hear at that moment. Thank you Adriene. 🙏🏻😊🧘🏻‍♀️",Jennifer Acomb,2019-01-19T05:15:40Z,1

"For reasons having to do with life, I have just done Day 8. Believe it or not, this is the one that kicked my butt the most so far! Bending forward with my legs crossed set off waves of panic. I settled in as best I could, noticing the panic, taking pauses, and also not quitting the pose. I can&#39;t get my forearms to the ground, my knees were screaming, and my head was nowhere near bubblegum fists! I could rest my forehead on my yoga block, but it was not restful. Very illuminating. Will I ever be able to lean forward like that without panic? I wonder. I shall revisit. Will also do Day 9 later today. I won&#39;t be able to catch up, but am doing bits and pieces of the practice at work during the day. Thank you.",Lorienne Schwenk,2019-01-16T17:46:33Z,0

"I&#39;m loving this series and have been following each episode - bit behind but I tend to do Yoga roughly every other day. I&#39;m fairly fit and slim, have always done lots of sports especially rock climbing but also fall in to the stereotypical &#39;unflexible man&#39; (spend too much time sat at a desk etc) category. Anyway... I found this episode REALLY hard. Up until now I&#39;ve been pleasantly surprised that I&#39;ve been able to follow along most of the way. But in the sitting pose, I can barely extend my leg straight (behind knee feels so tight!) never mind fold over towards toes. Same thing when cross legged, I struggle to sit up with nice straight back form, never mind folding over in front. Any suggestions for &#39;progressions&#39; towards this goal?

It helps. When everything else falls  yoga meditations thaichi and qigong combination works for you. If you didnt give up. So dont give up. Ever.

And during that last move, my cat jumped on my belly and gave me a paw massage. Really, a perfect practice for me today. Exactly what I needed. Thank you!",Darian,2019-01-15T05:07:22Z,17

"Like some of the others I am running a bit behind the pace, but nevertheless I am appreciating the sequence.  Today my lower back was giving me discomfort in the lying position (which I found odd) even though it would seem to be the most relaxing position. I&#39;m definitely not as bendy as I thought either when it comes to the head down stuff. I will definitely persevere.  These are such treats. 💝",Chloe Chelsea,2019-01-14T21:55:05Z,0
"So......honestly, not what I was hoping for......<br />I have loved so many videos in the past, use them when I travel, share with lots of friends, etc<br />With a theme of meditate, I would think more silence would be helpful.

I&#39;ve been trying to soften it as much as possible, but it made the last pose the most difficult for me.

This practice was lovely &lt;3 I am doing them a little out of sync since I got started with the 30 days a little late but I enjoy it all the same. Today I noticed even more than the other days the beautiful surroundings these practices take place in. It was a little foggy and the damp air seemed to cling to those big beautiful trees outside in the garden giving the red pines an even brighter colour! <br />The practice made me relax and look inward which I guess I kind of needed. So even if I was actually looking for a bit of a workout today I really came to enjoy this more relaxed time with myself.<br />I haven&#39;t watched The Crown but now I want to :) &lt;3,Lea Hufflepuff,2019-01-12T12:36:37Z,0

"I always thought it was weird when people said they would randomly start crying during these yoga practices, but today it happened to me!  The mind-body connection is powerful!",Maggie McCann,2019-01-12T02:06:48Z,136
Maggie McCann Got to day 8 today and this practice was also the first time I’ve ever had emotions triggered by yoga ❤️,rhiannonherridgesoprano,2019-04-10T12:01:02Z,2
"Maggie it&#39;s so cool that you had that moment and it was possible thru one of Adrienne&#39;s practices --- this flow definitely had us all set up for emotional success! I had my releasing moment when our heads and hearts were down but our hips were up...reached over and paused the video to give myself some more breaths to make it thru that wave.<br /><br />It&#39;s so powerful to use those moments to cleanse whatever was being held onto inside. I&#39;m so glad you learned what that&#39;s like. You can find those moments again on the mat and ohlawdy, they help the body make it thru the rest of the day! Seek it out and Enjoy!",Laura Thiel,2019-04-03T15:07:15Z,2

"Now, this practice was just what I needed for today.<br />I got home from school and got some bad news from my schoolmates. <br />One of my teachers had been absent for some days, but we thought she was just a bit I’ll.<br />Turns out she died today. She was an amazing old lady who taught us ethics and values. She made us laugh while showing astonishing things about life.<br />My eyes just could resist the pain, I cried .. it had been a pretty long time since I had lost someone important.<br />Despite all of my horrible depression I wanted to do yoga with you. I knew that it would calm me down.<br />Day 8 was just beautiful . Sometimes I think that your practices are coordinated with my mood; you’ve always got something to make me feel better! I’m going to my teacher’s funeral and will obviously cry, but will remember all of the amazing experiences we had while being together..<br />Thank you so much Adriene.

"I was really looking forward to this one, but found it the hardest yet. <br />I couldn&#39;t even get into the first position, let alone lean forward. I found it very hard to relax in such an uncomfortable pose. One (of many) reasons I started yoga last year was to improve by hip flexibility and stretch my tight hamstrings. Its working, and I&#39;ve found the meditative side an unexpected bonus, but I&#39;ve surprised myself with how frustrated todays practice made me feel. I hope I can return to this one next month and maybe get closer.",JackPott554,2019-01-11T21:18:48Z,0

"I&#39;m one of those people who really struggles with corpse pose. I have lordosis and though I actively work to correct it, including with yoga, corpse pose is always at least a bit of a struggle. This practice felt so good. I never felt like I was pushing or hurting myself or doing any crazy openings but when I went to corpse pose at the end, my low back and hips were super stimulated and it took me a good while to get them to settle down. But as they did, breath my breath, I felt my back and hips opening up and slowly, naturally releasing onto the ground for the first time in a very long time. <br /><br />I&#39;ve been sick the last week and taking it very easy (I&#39;m mostly better now) but even so, thanks to this practice, I&#39;ve felt my pelvis tucking and my shoulders unlocking so that the shoulder blades can come together and descend properly down my spine (they tend to sit high on me from a lifetime of trying to sit up straight from my shoulders and back instead of from my core and chest). In short, this 30 day practice is the best of all the years I&#39;ve done it so far and I&#39;ve been seeing real changes. Thanks so much.",Synteis J,2019-01-11T06:39:21Z,0

My neck hurt from time to time but at the end I was completely in a relaxed state. <br /><br />Also, this 30 day yoga journey is teaching me how to be more patient. It’s so hard for me to sit through videos like this where there isn’t much movement compared to yesterday’s video (for example). I’m learning to be more patient and quiet down my thoughts.

Thank you that was a beautiful practice.  I had a moving bolster with me in some of the poses too.  Housesitting a dog.  I found at the end with the lying down practice and the blanket folded under my legs that I felt sore in my lowerback but I felt into the pain and breathed through it.

"Hi Adriene! I&#39;ve been following your videos for a while now and really love them. <br /><br />After this practice though, when we got to the part where we lay on our backs, <br />my lower back hurt so much that I couldn&#39;t stay in the position. <br />I had to change to child&#39;s pose because that felt better. <br /><br />But is there a reason my lower back could start hurting from any of the things we just did before? <br />I know I have a kind of weak pelvis/lower back so I try to not push too much when doing these forward folds but even then it hurts <br />(afterwards, when lying on my back, not during the fold). <br /><br />Should I avoid them or do you have any tips for me? <br /><br />Thank you! <br />With love, Eva",Eva Pieters,2019-01-10T23:27:47Z,0

Great session (as always) &lt;3 I&#39;ve been practising mindfulness for a long time now and I had a question about the Observe session.

As I did this practice around midnight in Bulgaria, I could hear the sounds of my brother&#39;s and my mom&#39;s footsteps walking around the flat and getting prepared for bed and it made me so happy. I cuddled into my blanket that I rarely nap under nowadays, on the cozy rug on the floor of my room from my teenage years. I am home. I am grounded. I showed up for myself.

Due to a knee injury I just cannot bend my right knee far enough to bend forward sufficiently. So I kept my right leg straight and tried to invent my own version of this particular movement. I wanted to ask you though, is there any way you could tell me what else I couldve done with my leg? I really wanted to push it there, but it just didn&#39;t feel right. :) You bring so much joy to my life.

"Woo! That was a rough one for me. Maybe my body is too stiff at 6 a.m. with the chill from the night before still on the house, or maybe yesterday&#39;s fast flow left me a little fatigued, but I was finding myself really locked up through these super slow, long hip stretches. :( I made it through, though, and today is another day! Maybe since I&#39;m a couple days behind I&#39;ll double up, and do Day 9 tonight, to see if there&#39;s any difference.

I enjoyed the practice today and was glad that it was a bit more relaxed as I was not feeling 100%. I did have trouble with this practice though. Sitting &quot;Indian&quot; style (what I was told as a child about sitting this way) is very hard for me and I could not do the stacking of one heal in front of the other. Is there another way to sit to still get benefits from the practice? I guess my hips and legs are just way too tight to sit normally.

My goodness it&#39;s so strange how these slow practices are the most difficult ones! Stretching deeply like this ignites a lil angry voice in my mind &quot;why are you doing this? It hurts!! Its annoying!! Stop!!&quot;  I loved it though :) feels so good to massage my sore muscles while stretching :) cant wait to get &#39;high&#39; tomorrow ;p Haha! Xoxo,spacegrace,2019-01-10T05:54:55Z,0

"I dunno what it is about this journey so far that makes me feel a little bit extra emotional by the end of each practice, but it&#39;s starting to feel really good. For the past 7 days so far I&#39;ve been restless and my mind hasn&#39;t been in it but I&#39;ve stuck with it for the experience. Today I finally relaxed and just moved along and was able to really focus on breathing, and now I&#39;m SO zen&#39;d out. Thank you for sharing this with us, I&#39;m looking forward to the progress we all make together.",Noma Fox,2019-01-10T05:45:46Z,0

"This whole week -- who am I kidding, this whole year -- I have been fighting myself, battling trusting my intuition, constantly using the phrase &quot;I am trying&quot;, so much. On my walk this evening, I found myself tearful and tired after coming to the conclusion: no more attempting to control everything. And then this. This practice happened. I started by battling my mind, as usual. But every time I felt the urge to muscle through, I decided to melt into breathing instead. When we ended, so cozy and relaxed, I found I wasn&#39;t even hearing Adriene&#39;s words. None until this line: &quot;And if you&#39;re wondering if you&#39;re doing it right... the answer, my friend, is: &#39;Yes&#39;&quot;  Only after hearing my own sob did I realize I was crying. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I&#39;ve needed this consistent message of unconditional love and self-trust so much this year as I gain courage to let go of my vice grip. Thank you.",Ellie May Brain,2019-01-10T05:43:53Z,55

"Adriene, today was a really difficult day for me. This evening, we noticed a drip coming from our bathroom ceiling. Turns out the apartment above us had broken the line of their toilet trying to unclog it, and there was literal SHIT water dripping from our ceiling. Yup. Liquid shit. It was absolutely disgusting. Dealing with resident managers, plumbers, on call maintenance--what a nightmare. But somehow, I managed to fit this in. Pacing and fretting was doing nothing. It was all out of my control. So I turned to my yoga practice, knowing that it was the only helpful thing I could do in the moment. I cried, a lot. And then, your comments...I couldn&#39;t help but laugh: &quot;notice the smell in the room&quot;...Well, it literally smells like shit! &quot;Notice the sounds around you&quot;...Plumbing, sawing, boots stomping above, the dripping of water into a bucket in the bathroom...nothing could have been LESS peaceful! And yet, somehow I got through it. Lol. I don&#39;t even know what else to say but thank-you. I&#39;m proud that I managed to show up on the mat even on the worst of days. It helped, even if just to make me laugh when all I could do was cry. Love you Adriene, you&#39;re my hero! xox Jessica",Jessica B.,2019-01-10T04:49:10Z,0

"Best ever....I always would seek the short workouts, rarely practicing more than 18 minutes...with &quot;Dedicate&quot; I do not want it to end. I love finding this part of me....being able to simmer...to breathe...to seek and notice. Thank you Adriene.",Maryann Santos,2019-01-10T03:36:06Z,0

"Today was a difficult day to focus on this journey for many unknown reasons. My day was busy but fine, though when I pulled the video up to focus in, I just couldn&#39;t. Once I started it was a bit better, but still...Ironic that the most difficult one to get through for me will probably be one of the easiest videos to follow",Sierra Nicole,2019-01-10T03:33:05Z,0

"I found that putting the bolster/blanket under my knees actually put a lot of pressure on my low back/sacrum, and was extremely uncomfortable after having warmed it up through the practice. I had to go to reclined tailor&#39;s pose but I was just  distracted by the discomfort, which kept me from relaxing. Just a note :)",Ashley Wilson,2019-01-10T03:20:48Z,0

This was a perfect way to end my day today! Felt so at ease and grounded - your voice was so soothing. I appreciate that you also mentioned about breathing mindfully when you pray - we don’t often hear that from yoga instructors! I often pray in savasana or during meditation and also try to breathe mindfully. Thank you AGAIN for a wonderful practice today! Looking forward to Day 9! Yay! 🙌🏻💕🧘🏻‍♀️ (I have seen The Crown on Netflix and LOVE IT!),Bethany B.,2019-01-10T03:13:40Z,0

"Today was a day at home, without kids, and a to do list and to be lost a mile long. I missed my morning gym class— I hadn’t even gotten out of my pajamas. The next one, I said, but that didn’t happen either. I sat. I ate. I lazed. I zoned. I was just so stuck and unmotivated and in my own headspace. I talked myself into being okay with missing practice today, that maybe I’d do day 8 and 9 together tomorrow. I came upstairs for bed, just feeling an overwhelming cloud of blah over me, but couldn’t shake something. I give up on myself too often, and this 30 day journey is about showing up for myself. So I turned off the lights, turned on the video, and did day 8 in my bed, in my pajamas, and could barely hold on the tears by the end. It was the practice I needed today. The exact practice I needed. It quieted what needed to be quieted and opened what needed to be opened. Thank you.",Jill McK,2019-01-10T03:06:26Z,0
"Todays practice was out of this world, it was really nice to just take time and focus on our self, our breathing, and stretching exp after the core one lol my stomach area is still sore so today was actually very nice and refreshing ❤ thank you so much for making this possable for everyone here today and thank you for everyone that has shown up to the Matt as well I feel so happy knowing everyone all over the world is doing this with me as well💕",Samantha Williams,2019-01-10T03:06:18Z,0

I noticed there was definitely a bit of burn in my low back when we ended the practice. I wonder if that is because I have been working on improving my poster outside of Yoga. I work at a desk throughout the day. I sit more often than I stand. I wonder if the efforts I make to “correct” my posture caused that slight burn...,Terri K,2019-01-10T02:55:37Z,0

"Now 8 days in I can identify the breaths before the journey were constant tug of wars with holding my breath just enough to release instead of enjoying the inhalations as energy, exiting as proof I made it to that singular breath. Just today at work I stepped away from a tough interpreting assignment to simply breathe. I walked away, it melted behind me. What a powerful lesson you are giving us.",Heather Knight,2019-01-10T02:42:35Z,0

"Hi Adriene. My partner and I love your yoga practices and esp. the 8-day Dedicate practice. One bit of feedback I have is about the sound – The music on most of your video intros is WAY louder than the rest of the program. What happens is we have to turn up your voice when you begin and, worst of all, after your final shavasana or any resting pose the music comes in SO loud it&#39;s startling! Just a request to balance your audio tracks so we can fully enjoy your wonderful offerings in a relaxing and seamless way. Many thanks! Stas",Anastasi Mavrides,2019-01-10T02:40:10Z,0

I finally crossed things off of my to-do list today that have been plaguing me with stress for weeks. I can see myself returning to this practice and yesterday&#39;s often after this 30 day series is completed. Thank you for helping to change my life, honest. Namaste :)",Tessa Beck,2019-01-10T02:38:02Z,0
"Day 7 followed by day 8 in my world. Absolutely delicious and AWARE! Smiles, Gratitude and light! I have a question: How high is too high to prop up when sitting? My hips are tight and to get my hips above my knees I have to stack a couple blankets plus. I don&#39;t have a bolster, yet. But I&#39;m also afraid sitting on a full bolster would be too high.",Danielle Baragar,2019-01-10T02:34:43Z,0

"Adrienne thank you for your videos. I’ve started yoga with you by following your other 30 day challenge back in November and December and the change in my everyday mindset and approach to work has shifted immensely. I feel like I’m back to my best self, someone who I thought I lost for almost a year and a half now. I used to feel extremely guilty when I couldn’t make it to the gym and exercise became just another task on my seemingly never ending to do list. I’m not sure which video it was, but you reminded us that this is exactly where we need to be and that has been my mantra going into the new year. Whenever my social anxiety starts to surface and I replay interactions in my head from that day, or I jump ahead to worrying about the future, I remind myself that this is exactly where I need to be and I am instantly calm. Yoga has now made me view exercise in a positive light and I am ready to go back to the gym at my own pace. My productivity is much more intentional and my downtime is much more purposeful as well. I have so much more mental clarity and have been able to fall back in love with some of my hobbies like journaling, music, and reading. You have done wonders for my mental health and I cannot thank you enough. <br /><br />Today was a particularly demanding day for me and I wasn’t able to fit in my yoga in the morning like I normally do. This practice was exactly what I needed to come back to after today. I’m so excited to continue on this yoga journey with you and I’m sending you so much love. 💕",Kirsten Lee,2019-01-10T00:41:59Z,0
Exactly what I needed today &lt;3 Namaste!,Mikeyla Sainz,2019-01-10T00:41:25Z,0
"So, I actually found today’s practice quite difficult, specifically in terms of staying focused and not letting my mind trail off. I thought about why and the only reason I can come up with is that I’m coming out of 2018 with a lot of shame and guilt precisely because I relaxed too much and didn’t do nearly enough work toward reaching my goals. <br /><br />Once the clock struck 12 on 1/1/19, I resolved to be a productive as I could possibly be every single day of 2019, so that I wouldn’t   repeat the previous year’s mistakes. Today wasn’t a very productive day for me, so I was already down on myself because of that and then when evening rolled around and I got into this practice, I kept feeling anxious and antsy, just waiting for something more active to take place so that I could stretch, and sweat and feel my heart race and somehow, in my own mind, redeem myself for not having done enough today. <br /><br />Clearly, today’s practice was the total antithesis of that “active ideal” and I just had a hard time dealing with it and being able to accept that relaxation is okay, even when your goal is to try your hardest every day. No shade at all is meant to you, Adriene, or today’s practice (which felt great physically); my gripe was internal in nature, a personal struggle with my very all-or-nothing mentality. Hopefully, I’ll get over it. <br /><br />Thank you for Day 8. 🙂",bxrosie04,2019-01-10T00:40:22Z,0

Today&#39;s practise was a frustrating one for me and it left me quite emotional.

"Honestly, this practice left me feeling frustrated and dejected. I&#39;m a beginner and I can&#39;t get anywhere close to that siddhasana pose, and folding forward is impossible for me, so half of this video was well out of my realms of possibility.

"Whoa! This was a tough one for me! Besides the mind jumping from thought to thought like a squirrel, my body just did NOT want to cooperate! With my hips elevated, it felt as though they were lifting from the earth when I leaned over. No forearms on the ground either! I just did a shark fin type pose with my hands to hold my head above my bent elbows. Meanwhile, I&#39;m thinking of how tight my hips feel, how my bum seems to be coming off the ground, how my ankles hurt from so much pressure, etc., etc. What a relief when we finally hit savasana! Nice to see earlier comments that I was not alone in feeling tight and scattered! Still - we got through it! Sincerest thanks to Adriene and to all who participate, and post.

I am so glad I chose to do this 30 days with you all! I&#39;m connecting to myself in a way I never have before.

"Adriene, I wanted to do a short practice, and there I was trying to surrender to yoga, to that union of everyting, the Self and the God, participating in moving meditation, trying to surrender, trying to participate, but I was fidgeting and being a nervous mass of muscle and flesh and thoughts. And then I heard your voice in my head telling me to find the ease,sukha, and there it was, the ease, I just felt it, expanding and contracting. And I thought &quot;Adriene is my teacher&quot; with all the depth that the idea of the Teacher brings, and I felt  deep love for my teacher, special kind of love I rarely got to experience in my life.

"One of the greatest things about this journey is that I cannot ignore my impatience. I&#39;ve had to argue with it (not particularly effective), be annoyed at it (again, little effect), accept it and hang out with it. It&#39;s amazing how the mat mirrors life. I tend to rush ahead (I&#39;m one of THOSE people who love planning) and optimise for time. This practice, though, has guided me into gently questioning that rushing. Yesterday we were asked to set an intention and I got quite emotional: I choose to taste this moment. I continue to carry it with me. It was great to be here with you all.",Rosielen Odsey,2019-01-09T21:15:07Z,0

The realization that i&#39;m doing this with so many people around the world is so empowering and I&#39;m very grateful. <br />This one was not that easy for me, I never experience pain during the practice but the last past lying down was pretty painful in my lower back (and I did use a pillow and blanket) does anybody have a tip to prevent this? I was so relaxed, but in the end I got a little bit frustrated by how uncomfortable I was.",Nadieh,2019-01-09T21:14:19Z,0

"Yes, totally normal. There&#39;s the release of endorphins with exercise for a start. And partly it&#39;s down to a sense of emotional support and connection with others as we engage in the practise. There&#39;s a realisation that you are improving your self; shifting the world&#39;s balance slightly towards what is Good. It takes you away from your problems for a time, and you glimpse what kind of person you have the potential to become.<br />Let&#39;s try to remain dedicated  :)",Timmy Gun,2019-01-10T01:02:37Z,4

"Thank you so much for this week&#39;s practice so far. I started my Yoga with Adriene journey last fall and have experienced all the 30 (and 31) day programs. I have since (in my opinion) mastered my home practice, in the sense, I get up in the morning and play one of Adriene&#39;s final days (with just the music) with my headphones on my mat and practice &quot;what feels good&quot; for me that day, integrating everything I&#39;ve learned. This September, I experienced a type 1 manic episode not knowing I was bipolar. I was first able to recognize this was happening because my ability to be mindful and stay in the moment was completely lost and unattainable. I was experiencing a lot of stress, which led me to try more mediation and yoga, only to find that I was not able to practice yoga or mindfulness at all. I have since started recovery with medication and therapy and I have gotten back into my daily yoga and I am able to be mindful, and observant of my breath. I even accomplished my 2018 resolution of a successful headstand (and have been doing more since)! I was very much looking forward to this year&#39;s new yoga journey to help remind me of the basics and integrity in poses and focusing on the breath. Adriene is truly doing some wonderful work for this world and I just wanted to share how positive this experiene has been for me. The 30 day journeys have taught me so much on how to care for myself each day and the repetoire of many other videos are so useful to have as resources for tough days of stress and anxiety. (My favorites are the stress relief practice, and the meditation for anxiety). I have shared this Youtube page with many mental health workers and professors, as well as friends and family. Thank you Adriene for helping me live a happier and healthier life which translates into me being a more positive and productive member of society and in my social groups &lt;3",Nerdy Nat,2019-01-09T20:22:10Z,0

I was wondering when we would have a relaxing day and when Adriene would start the intro with a rhyme. Today was that day. Today I had much energy but was glad that Day 8 was relaxing practice. This year I did not do yoga daily and took a few days to rest. It would be good to supplement my relaxing days with practices such as this to get some practice some stretching in.,Terence,2019-01-09T20:15:59Z,0

You always hit the nail on the head with your words too and I often well up when you manage to tell me exactly what I need to hear at that moment! I&#39;m loving Dedicate and enjoyed today&#39;s practice, but I do struggle with one part. When the pose involves head to the floor (Or the blanket today) like child&#39;s pose, I can&#39;t seem to get air into my lungs properly and start to feel a little claustrophobic rather than relaxed. Should I stick with it and it will improve, as has been the case with my flexibility, strength and general mental health? Or would I be better finding a different position in those moments?

Went to work, had a very hard and exhausting day, came home beaten down by things that happened and then realised I haven’t done my daily Adriene yoga. Went to the mat, done it and am most grateful for it, especially because it was the right kind of practice I needed today. Now I am relaxed and back to being me. It seems like Adriene knew that today it has to be a meditation-day-yoga. Thank you so much for this, 🙏🏻",urssulas,2019-01-09T19:32:16Z,1
"Did I do it wrong? I had trouble breathing with the pillow over the legs when we bent the knees, I know I’m going to write this wrong but I think she said”poshimo tanasana”? Did anyone else had trouble breathing? What did I do wrong? Thank you",princessaome,2019-01-09T19:31:25Z,0
"I needed this practice today as feeling very emotional about many things and having one of those difficult days of quietening the mind. I really enjoyed this practice and although I couldn&#39;t completely quiet my mind and feel more at peace after this yoga, so thank you, you bring love and peace with this practice. Namaste xo",Madeline Prusmann,2019-01-09T19:24:34Z,0
"evening here in the UK and just finished the practice. I loved the mood you created but found this the toughest yet. So hard for me to be still, though I know I need it. Much easier for me to go with the flow in the more active practices.  Also, so much stiffness in my hips that I found it really hard to sit and bend comfortably. Consequently, couldn&#39;t sink into the relaxed state you were encouraging. Clearly an area I need to practice a lot more. Glad to take that learning from today. Thank you",Devon Book Club,2019-01-09T19:23:12Z,0

"Ok, today was super difficult. Meditation is never easy for me, but usually I can put my thoughts to one side for awhile and be in the moment after awhile but I only got brief glances of that today. It’s been a difficult day not having the power to help someone who is really in need which has affected me more than I thought. Still it was good to just breathe and work to find some ease, so I’m glad I made it to the mat.

"I must admit, I was a little disappointed when I saw today would be a slow and gentle practice but in fact it was the most difficult of the series so far. Because I had to stop and be with myself. To resist the urge to force each pose and skip the discomfort of releasing my thoughts. I’m so glad I did though, because I really felt a sense of community and love when I’d finished and I’m so glad I am a part of this journey. Thank you Adriene for your wisdom and for being so genuine and down to earth. You have helped me more than I could describe, to learn to respect my body which for so long I have abused and treated with such hatred. Thank you for facilitating this journey.

"Ah! I just kinda stumbled upon your channel and let me tell you this is a life changer! I have been interesting in yoga for a while but I always thought the only way to get real yoga experience was by going to a studio, I had no idea that at home yoga practice was a legit thing! I don&#39;t usually leave comments or even follow or watch youtube but for the past 3 weeks I&#39;ve been doing yoga for about an hour an a half everyday guided by your videos! I don&#39;t know how to explain it but you make everything comfortable and you can encourage people to just do their best and letting them know their best is enough. Ive been following the 30 day Dedicate, and today was ohhhh just what I needed, I woke up with racing thoughts and couldn&#39;t seem to think about anything other then what I need to do and how I am going to do it and, today you just set my mind at ease and calmed everything in my body, I will definitely becoming back to this video!

One thing that was uncomfortable was when relaxing at the end with the blanket under my knees, I got a pain in my lower back which I imagine was something to do with tension releasing. However, it didn&#39;t pass or melt as I thought it would, so I pulled my knees to my chest to flatten my back, which felt better. Any advice?

"I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m always surprised, but every time I do one of your 30 day journeys or just any of your classes you change my life! When I start noticing the &quot;signs&quot; life is trying to get me to see/hear/feel you almost always mirror or expand on the universes message for me! Loved loved loved today&#39;s practice, woke up with a very stiff neck and when I saw you were in your comfy clothes and socks I paused video to get my fav cup of tea, baggy sweatshirt, and my cozy lamby socks to practice in. After practice no more stiffness, and a larger inner smile! Thank you for telling me to inhale/exhale love and lean in to trust the practice! Oh yeah, I laughed so hard when you said to put your left foot out and meant right foot, that is so me when I teach yoga that sometimes I just say &quot;this leg&quot; or &quot;that foot&quot; and point!

"While doing the last section of this meditation, lying on my back with the towel under my legs and pillow under my head, I know I was supposed to be relaxing but all i could feel in my abdominals and lower back was tension and pain. I wasn&#39;t sure if my lower back was to be flat to the ground, which I often find difficult due to the curvature of my spine. Apart from this issue, today&#39;s session, as always, was a wonderful session and easily the best part of my day. I wish my dog was as quiet as Benji during my sessions though, but I just try to acknowledge it and let it go by. Thank you",Hilda Bailey,2019-01-09T16:59:06Z,0

"Sadly the final pose sparked quite a bit of pain in my lower back and tailbone. I tried a variety of adjustments in my position, like making my back more flush with the floor or allowing it to arch, to no avail. It ended up being less calming and more painful, and I can still feel the discomfort after the video&#39;s end! Nonetheless, a beautiful and calming practice that also highlighted a clear area in which I need to grow, strengthen, and give focus to. I think that&#39;s the beauty of yoga; it speaks to you about your own body, telling you things that you weren&#39;t even aware of.",fiightforme,2019-01-09T16:52:40Z,0

"Hello FWFG friends! I have been following along with Adriene and all of y&#39;all for about 5 years, and this is my first time doing a 30 day journey as its being uploaded. I have to say that it&#39;s barely day 8 and I&#39;m already feeling more grounded and connected to my Self. I have trouble with negative thoughts and feelings quite often, but today I feel lighter. Stronger. I am truly honored to be sharing this journey with y&#39;all. Adriene, I would love to hear you talk about your moods a little more, like how you are feeling that particular day. Are you frustrated, tense, maybe upset about something? Bc I find trouble sometimes in engaging my Self in my practice due to negative feelings, and I would love to see a little more of how you deal with those moments as you&#39;re in them. Thank you for everything you do for yourself, your community, and millions of us. Namaste. :)<br />BTW, great practice as usual and exactly what I needed today. However, due to some lower back pain, I had to modify s couple of the poses. Still connected with my breath and with a sense of ease.",McKenna,2019-01-09T16:50:50Z,9

"This was the first emotional experience I&#39;ve had since starting this journey. When you talked about listening to where your thoughts go, all I was thinking about was yesterday when I tried my wedding dress on and it was pretty snug. That moment broke me. I felt worthless and ugly, and I was afraid that I wouldn&#39;t look beautiful on my wedding day. But then you spoke about honoring where your body is at right now, and I realized that I can control this. I can control if I show up on the mat everyday. I can control my attitude along this journey. I can control my thoughts toward my body. I may not be able to control the food that my college serves us, but I can show up for myself over the next four months and treat myself better.

Today&#39;s practice was frustrating for me personally. I actually cried a couple of times but I know it more has to do with stuff off the mat than it did with the actual practice.

"This was exactly what I needed today. I woke up defeated, thinking I was gonna maybe skip practice today, because I&#39;m not in my house, and I don&#39;t have any space here, or a mat. But I decided to take a look at the practice first before setting things in stone and as soon as I saw Adrienne dressed all cozy I knew I could do this. I did it in bed which isn&#39;t my favorite thing to do, but it allowed me not to skip today, and I feel great. Thank you Adrienne for always knowing what I&#39;ll need :)",Ana Clara,2019-01-09T14:57:50Z,0

I did gymnastics in my 30&#39;s and could put my nose on my knees with legs completely straight.  Can&#39;t do that now either.  Oh, I&#39;m 74 - could that be the reason or will I ever get flexible again?

So chilled out now (as is my cat who is in a similar position to Benji). Could anyone advise me where i am going wrong - after a seated forward fold my lower back is very sore and I need to end the practice in a childs pose to counteract.

"This is the first one I have done right out of bed in the morning (it was still dark).  Usually I do my practice with you between 10 and 11pm and then hop into bed and fall asleep immediately.  Today I found that I hold a lot of tension in my face as I am doing this practice.  Interesting! <br /><br />I am going to do YWA8 again at my normal time and see if there is a difference.  I will let you know.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I did YWA8 again at night.  What I found out is that I prefer doing YWA right before bed.  I feel my body is a little looser, find it easier to quiet my mind, and it is a great way to end my day.",Karon Crickmore,2019-01-09T12:19:31Z,2

"Loved this practice, it was perfect for today.  My gym workout this morning was rough and full of revisions as my body did not feel well and others took equipment.  It was nice to come home to this practice, it was meant to be.  I have lost so much flexibility over the years and I gave myself permission today to accept that and not beat myself up for not attending to it.  And I watched the Crown too, loved it!  Binge watched it while my daughter was in the hospital for a two weeks.",Lisa Smith,2019-01-09T12:16:50Z,0

"This was a difficult day for me, and brought awareness to just how tight my hips and my hamstrings really are.

"I was sooo uncomfortable today.  My hips, my knees, my lower back.  I had blankets, and pillows and I just could not settle in.  Every move hurt, I fidgeted through the entire practice.  Sitting that way is just so uncomfortable.  I could cry. I want so bad to feel this practice with a sense of ease but it was anything but.  Nothing on  Adrienne- it is all me.  I don’t know why this is so hard for me, but the fact that it is bothers me so much.   Oh, and I did watch and love The Crown!  👑 👸 🤴",Sarah Safar,2019-01-09T12:03:22Z,0
"Just keep trying to be kind to yourself. Talk to your self as though you are speaking to a very close friend that needs love and gentleness, care and acceptance. You wouldn&#39;t discourage a friend of yours if they met some challenges, I would assume, so be kind like that to your self when you run into challenges! Keep going! One day when you aren&#39;t as tight or fidgeting, you&#39;re gonna look back and laugh about how far you&#39;ve come. Namaste!",J J,2019-01-09T16:03:09Z,0

And because this is YWA, one modification turned out to be flexing the foot of the outstretched leg while massaging the other foot. Nice! A little thing can have big effects. :)",Phoenix Scholz-Krishna,2019-01-09T10:27:18Z,20

"Very relaxing and joyful. Thank you! I knew today&#39;s practice would be a gentle one when I saw you wearing socks and your hair down. :D I had to wake up early today so this was a perfect start for the day. <br /><br />It was interesting to notice how different the hip opening pose felt on either side of my body. When my right leg was in front of my left leg and I felt the stretch on my right hip, I was struggling and wishing to come out of the pose sooner. And while my left leg was in the front and my left hip was stretching, I felt so good I could have stayed in the pose much longer. This made me notice again how much tighter my right hip is compared to my left hip.",Kirin Tenshi,2019-01-09T10:01:59Z,0

"Sit still and disengage normal activities.<br />Draw energy from the earth,<br />Admit power from the heavens.<br />Fertilize the seed within;<br />Let it sprout into a flower of pure light.<br />And let brightness open the top of your head:<br />Divine light will come pouring in.<br />Your mind is empty,<br />Light seeps into your whole body.<br />Sitting cross-legged, with hands clasped,<br />As if trying to embrace the brilliant flood,<br />Your skin turns transparent.<br />How can a bag of skin hold divine magnitude?<br />Your last vestiges burn away in a torrent of infinity.<br /><br />Only after indeterminate time do you return.<br />Flesh, blood, bone.<br />Were you gone? Or were you never here in the first place?<br />Where is the torrent?<br />It is not gone;<br />You’ve only closed to it once more.<br /><br />- Deng Ming Dao",Ricardo,2019-01-09T09:12:48Z,1

"I felt compelled to comment after todays practice.<br /><br />I’ve followed you for over 5 years and always looked forward to your 30 days of yoga in January. This year I’ve found it so difficult due to experiencing high levels of nerve, joint pain especially hip/groin area brought on from prolonged periods of stress from losing both parents last year, one from aggressive cancer in April and the other from a sudden stroke in September.<br /><br />I have turned up every day and often sat in a kneeling position as seated is so uncomfortable. I have tried not to beat myself up and send unconditional love to my body but today when I tried to bring my right foot in to cross my legs it just wouldn’t give at all, I felt so low and just wanted to get up and give up but something made me stay…..then I cried and I cried some more……<br /><br />This such a tough journey, sitting with myself but one I need to be on…I am not going to give up on myself and I thank you for that ❤️",Amanda Hughes,2019-01-09T09:03:07Z,81

When practice ended, the sun was out in clearing skies, the wind has stilled, and the whole morning was calm and inviting.<br /><br /> The real question is, is this power coming from Adrienne (or Benji), or is her practice awakening superpowers in me?

"It&#39;s true: I was &#39;hoping for a workout today&#39;, as Adriene commented about halfway through this vid, and for a split-second I was disappointed when I realised I wasn&#39;t going to get the chance to pound myself into jelly. BUT I immediately decided to trust that I had been sent what I needed -- and indeed I had; it was so lovely, I wish it could have lasted all day.  And, yes -- &#39;The Crown&#39; is a banger.  I bet even the Royal Family think it&#39;s better than the real thing.",Kris Henley,2019-01-09T06:48:17Z,11

Thanks for the amazing practice. Hope everyone else doing this with me has a wonderful time slowing it down today loving ourselves for we are to rocket back up tomorrow on day 9, is what my guts are telling me. Stay amazing.

"Adriene and Everyone: I&#39;m writing this from beside a friend&#39;s bed in Emerge. She was missing, for over a week, and now is found. Imagine the words not in that short sentence. I had completed Day 7 literally minutes before the call she was found and being taken to hospital. Because of what I&#39;ve learned while on my mat this week and from the many comments I&#39;ve read, I was able to focus on being calm for my friend despite an emerge horror show around us. <br /><br />At one point I put my hand on her upper back and asked her if she&#39;d ever done yoga (one of only questions I asked her). She said Years ago. So I took a deep breath, audibly, and literally thought of all of you and invited her to breathe along with me. It kept us calm and grounded and then she fell asleep. Please understand this comment is <b>NOT</b> intended to be about me but rather the incredible power of yoga and knowing there&#39;s a world of well-intentioned people out there. All you. And Adriene, it&#39;s meant as a thanks to you who makes this all available and accessible in so many ways. I&#39;m humbled tonight, truly.<br />Namaste.",Mixed Media Life,2019-01-09T06:06:18Z,383
