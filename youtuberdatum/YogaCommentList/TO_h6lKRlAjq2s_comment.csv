The breaths were waaaay too fast for me on this one. I&#39;m having a minor asthma attack. The movements just felt rushed. But I loved the alien concept! Would&#39;ve loved more thoughts about the universe and taking care of our human vessel. Something like that. Would love another one of these with a bit more of a slower pace and more care in that way. Thank you for everything you do!,KTnarnia,2020-11-30T08:23:01Z,0

"Watching in July but this video has earned a slot in my favorite practices; perfectly balanced and light-hearted. I have a request (if we are still doing requests in these virus hiatus times): a practice for dissociation/depersonalization. I&#39;ve been struggling tirelessly with episodes of dissociation that now accompany my general anxiety -- which has been turned on to turbo drive in recent months. I am fortunate enough to have access to mental health professionals and I&#39;ve learned to use meditation and yoga to curb those feelings of reality/bodily detachment. Sometimes, however, when I turn to yoga in those episodes, I wrestle to stay focused, present, and grounded. This practice and the new &quot;Shift&quot; video have been the most helpful and I have created a routine from them but having a guide during depersonalized panic attacks is endlessly helpful -- I feel safer and less alone. Nonetheless, I can&#39;t thank you enough for giving us the gift of at home practice &lt;3",Miranda,2020-07-13T13:26:02Z,1

"Hello Adrienne. I am wondering if your costume within the yoga context is a little insensitive. Right now the term Alien on our planet are folks from another country who are othered and put aside and disregarded as humans in our dominate society. As you are apart of the dominate culture (I am assuming you are white) and profiting from someone else&#39;s culture, South Asian and Indian to be precise, you are perpetuating harm in the SA community. You are taking up space, benefiting financially, and knowingly or unknowingly you are causing harm by stating that you are an alien. It may seem like I might be over sensitive but I highly recommend checking out the work Susanna Barkataki has been doing in Honor Don&#39;t Appropriate Yoga <a href=""https://honordontappropriateyoga.com/"">https://honordontappropriateyoga.com/</a> (this is happening and if you are a yoga practitioner you would think twice before you cause harm, or own up to the harm you are causing with your costume in the context of your video). I would also recommend listening to Jesal and Tejal&#39;s Yoga is Dead podcast <a href=""https://www.yogaisdeadpodcast.com/"">https://www.yogaisdeadpodcast.com/</a>. It was made for white folks like us who practice and teach yoga. Please listen to South Asian voices, do not ignored or silence them.",ashley brown,2019-10-30T17:35:43Z,0

You&#39;re SO COOL for doing fun episodes! When I read it in the weekly love letter that this flow will be dedicated to times when you feel like you need to phone home or when you&#39;re not home in your own body I was like it just couldn&#39;t hit any better spot. I&#39;ve been dealing with being disconnected from myself (and the world) for a while BUT luckily I found YOU and I&#39;ve been doing a video (or three) everyday since 7 October. I feel like I learn something new from and by you every single day and that you&#39;re slowly guiding me back to my deepest inner portal. It has been 20 days with YWA without missing a day (!) and I am truly dedicated (first time in my life!) to make it a full year without a break! I&#39;ve been practicing yoga for 7 years and I finally found my YODA. I feel like I began to understand yoga at last. (Hashtag Beyond perfect shapes) Thank you for all the hard work you&#39;re doing for us and stay this awesome alien whom we love to practice with! Lots of LOVE,Susie Ladnai,2019-10-27T18:04:08Z,0

Nanoo Nanoo Adrienne alien thank you for you selfless service .  I have been doing yoga with you from your YouTube beginning and prior.  My brother passed October 3 2019 and he was 46 it was years of drug and alcohol abuse and just not taking care of himself.  Which I too share partly in this drug addicted culture but finally when my father passed Nov 3 of 2014 I quit all street drugs then the psychiatric drugs the doctors put me on now I&#39;m getting off those all 6 different &quot; non addictive &quot; meds that too also have their withdrawal effects they are there own monster.  I&#39;m 43 I now live with my mom who is an amazing woman...you and her are helping me to help her and myself to FIND WHAT FEELS GOOD. to rediscover life    two woman who are very different but I definitely am my mother&#39;s daughter ....but b<br />Beyond the two most important men in my life have gone it&#39;s time to get back WOMAN POWER the F word Feminist   I went to a private womans  college I too my wheels fell off and it was Phish and drugs and music and on and off my mat but I always comeback to you because You are a rock in my life a permanent fixture that helps me get through all the tragedies such as domestic violence rape homelessness prostitution basically my own hells by choice but now I&#39;m back on my mat preparing myself for prison ...because after my brother died I didn&#39;t take it that well and the police got involved 6 of them and me and they said I fought them ...hmm mmmm.....this day in age they would have shot me if I was fighting them and they just so happened to forget in the police report that that tased me plus multiple other things I&#39;ll admit I was sad unhappy mentally unstable it was as if a bomb had been dropped on my mom and my house and she goes internal I explode external anyway I just want people to know the injustices that are happening .people have always said I should write a book and I think prison will be the place to have time and space to write journal and take you with me (I have my 200 he certificate and I&#39;m a massage therapist shiatsu and Thai massage a ballistic health practioner ) I also we t to Heartwood in Humboldt county ca and Maui yoga and dance shala) so I&#39;m pretty well educated and am compassionate caring loving learning to be more peaceful and soft with myself through you AGAIN so Adrienne I salute you I now my head to my heart and say a e feel Namaste thank you on yea it I&#39;m ever in Austin is love to come to a class live in in Oklahoma I never imagined I&#39;d be living here again ...I&#39;ve traveled the world and now because I grieved wrong in the bible belt well they are<br /> Locking my body up but my spirit is free  and that FEELS GOOD MUCH LOVE TRUST AND RESPECT JILL PEMBERTON,Shoshannah Pemberton,2019-10-27T12:29:18Z,0

"I rolled down the floor laughing at the intro, even waking my mom up at 5 am on this Sunday morning. Was looking for such practice to deal with stress caused from a project I&#39;m currently working on. Time to go inwards a bit to see what&#39;s in there even though I&#39;m a four-eyed, 1.5 legged alien. No matter who we are and what we do, we all can sometimes be aliens to ourselves by not going inward often enough. This practice totally does it for me though. Thank you, Adriene for the practice and the laugher. You&#39;ve got this Aliens. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-10-27T05:12:05Z,189
