"Wow halfway already 😁.... Felt that hi5 when you said, &#39;Killing it&#39;🥵🥰<br />My hse mate had me doing burpees, press ups, bicep curls with weights etc after our walk this evening🥵. So when you said feel free to add anything, I laughed and said oh no.. And I&#39;m sorry I swore at you when you mentioned a couple press ups🙈<br />7th 30 day sesh with you-whoop whoop! Yes I feel 💪🏽, look👌🏾and I&#39;m 🙏🏽. Each pose felt great. My head is getting closer to the floor,taking space in star pose felt liberating, my vinyasas feels smooth and my cobra coming stronger in my hips. Still lots to work on. Today felt strong and empowering, thank you❣️",samantha Zabs,2021-03-16T00:51:55Z,0

I had to wait two days after day 14 because of my period, so I did something chill, and came back today. How I missed it! I feel so strong and capable after today, feeling so many shifts and wins.

"Adriene, these 30-day series are exactly what I needed. I took 4 years of yoga classes years ago and have had a very minimal home practice since. But you brought me out of my rut and I truly look forward to these every morning. I&#39;ve added new poses and challenges and I love that you provide levels of challenge. I also love that you include philosophies and concepts to engage the mind as well. I appreciate these so much and will continue. Benji is the calmest dog ever!",Lisa Grossman,2021-04-20T14:26:06Z,0

Thank you so much for this. Yes I know nearly a day later. I am currently training for my first 100 mile race and started to do yoga. I found this 30 day challenge as an easy way for planning so that I wouldn&#39;t have to keep searching for my daily yoga flow. I have enjoyed getting to know you and your style but this one was just amazing. Such a great resetting moment after a 10 mile run.

Second time doing Home and I’m so happy with the shift I’m seeing. Took a few days off my mat for no reason except life got in the way. Normally I’d beat myself up for not doing what I’m “supposed to do”. Today I just felt like “I get to” do my yoga practice and it felt good to get back to it. No bad juju at all.

Loved this one! After 45 days of yoga in 2021 I finally was able to do all the &quot;slowly lower to the ground with control&quot; without flopping all but the first one. I slowly lowered them all and I&#39;m so happy! Also did those side planks whaaaat. I&#39;ve never been so consistent with anything and I&#39;m starting to see the amazing results - thank you darling Adriene!,Jen W,2021-02-20T20:39:19Z,0

"Fitting that today would be called reset. I took a 2 DAY BREAK from yoga and was eating terribly! I could really tell the difference and that my body was missing the movement. Happy halfway point! I was able to do every downward dog today, and even the side planks. I feel so much stronger than I did on day one!",Deztiny Willis,2021-01-23T19:29:08Z,0
Picked this one today as I have a major reset going on. I had to put down my pupper of 14 years Wednesday 💔 We have walked every single day for the last 2 years when we lost our other pupper 2 years ago. We started walking for his grief. Every day 3 times a day for 2 years. 14 thousand steps nearly every single day. I walked once yesterday so not the same. Breath like you love yourself and reset.

"Today I felt strong, though that didn&#39;t come without struggle or shakiness. I was able to do everything but the side planks but that didn&#39;t bother me. I knew I was stronger than I&#39;d ever been today and that I would be getting stronger each day I practiced. I knew that one day I would be able to do a side plank without thinking twice. however by the end of the practiced, I felt rejuvenated...new. So I decided to give those side planks one more try. I rewinded the video and found myself doing them, I was shaking of course but it didn&#39;t feel overbearingly painful. I found myself holding it for almost as long as Adrienne and I know one day I&#39;ll be able to hold it for just as long as in this video or maybe even longer.",Adrenise Parker,2020-12-25T18:59:40Z,0

"So, I started this back in Jan...and it took until end of Feb to complete. Circumstances!<br />But with lockdown, I decided at the start of April to redo it. <br />Um...and then I decided to do it again in May, and then that I&#39;d just carry on. <br />It&#39;s now 23/10/20, and since September I&#39;ve been doing two sessions a day. So by the end of the month I&#39;ll be &quot;caught up&quot; and have done 10 &quot;Homes&quot; in 10 months. <br />Little achievements along the way have been thrilling but today&#39;s was THE one: I lowered to the ground from plank...NOT from my knees but from my toes.<br />It feels like a HUGE achievement. I&#39;m no petite, delicate flower - and I&#39;m very unfit and in my 40s - so this is a total milestone moment! <br />I&#39;ll be continuing to year end.

"Even 15 days into this practice, I am already noticing changes in my body.  The biggest example, which I&#39;m super excited about, is that I was finally able to get into crow, if only for a couple of seconds, a few days ago.  It&#39;s a pose I&#39;ve always been afraid of, but now, with Adriene&#39;s guidance, I&#39;m starting to feel less and less afraid of poses that may have seemed daunting before.

When doing yoga, you&#39;re not going to the mirror looking for abs or weight loss (because you don&#39;t expect it).

A friend and I started yoga for the first time together a few years ago. She used to “challenge” me to side planks-who could stay there the longest. If she couldn’t she would reach over and push me off balance. It was silly fun. She passed away almost a month ago. Doing this today was a really nice memory of her. 😔,Kelly Pawlusiak,2020-07-19T15:10:48Z,0

Today reaffirmed one of the reasons that I love doing yoga with Adriene: her silliness as well as her humanness and of course her acceptance of us all wherever we are. I loved the suggestions for different options of how to hold our feet or pant legs or leg hair (the height of fun silliness right there!) during happy baby.  I feel accepted as she always says &quot; your version&quot; and reminds me that it&#39;s ok if my body can&#39;t fold completely in half yet.

"This is my second 30 day journey, and this has been one of my favorite flows so far! I loved the down dog bind. Also, it was disheartening to read comments of &quot;my feet touched in down dog&quot; of people doing this for a few days. I&#39;m on day 46-ish and today was the first day my feet touched the mat in down dog, and I couldn&#39;t even keep it past my one attempt. Looking forward to the day I don&#39;t have to force it, but wanted to share for anyone else who doesn&#39;t feel like they are getting it as fast as everyone!

"I&#39;ve been practicing yoga nearly every day of quarantine, decided to start this yoga journey as an extra challenge.

Today was an interesting day. Firstly I found a more comfortable downward dog pose which was satiafying and helped a lot. Secondly I was reading about mindfulness earlier in the morning before I started and it stated how mindfulness isn&#39;t just being aware of the self but of your environment and the world around you. At the end of today&#39;s session I had stretched out my hands wide in front of my face and just for a brief moment I could picture the interconnected webs between all things. It was like I could sense the animistic spirit in everything around me. It was a really cool experience.,Jak Ateara,2020-05-31T13:06:49Z,0

Just learned pyramid pose during this video and it felt great. Two years and some poses I sink into completely and others like happy baby are still difficult. I like that I get to be a novice and experienced all at the same time. Glad for all the folks who have found Adriene during quarantine.

"Hi there, I am not one for commenting on each class but just felt like reaching out today. I have been with Adriene&#39;s classes for 3 months now. First the 30 Days Yoga, then the 30 day Challenge, and now I find myself half way HOME . I must say that these classes and Adriene&#39;s easy breezy style makes this the best way to ground and get empowered and energized for the day.  It is the  very most impt. part of my day. I am 71 yrs old and have been doing yoga off and on for many years. There were times in the past when I did little or no Yoga at all, but this year I decided I needed to develop a home practice and this lead me to Adriene.  I am so grateful for this and I would say to any one who thinks that Yoga is too hard or to challenging, JUST KEEP IT UP.  There are some classes where I say Adriene, like NO I cant do that pose, BUT instead of giving up, I modify the pose to the best of my flexibility and hold with the idea that in time more strength and flexibility comes.  I am so grateful for these 3 courses and would invite all who read this to KEEP IT UP. Make that COMMITMENT, that we are all so afraid of , or that seems useless in these crazy times. But believe me you will see a real difference in every aspects of your lives. I love you all, Adriene, YOU ARE THE BEST! Keep challenging us and making us LAUGH , and give Bengi a HUG for me.

"Hey Adriene (or anyone else watching who has some tips) One question: Whenever we do the low lunge with the knee down and then the runner&#39;s stretch, I experience intense pain in the grounded knee and have to go out of it. Is there anything I might be doing wrong/is there a way of doing it that puts less weight on that knee? I don&#39;t have any official medical problem with my knees. You imply that this should feel easier than a low lunge entirely off the knees, but those are much less painful for me.  Would  a modification for this where I uncurl the toes and have the entire shin on the ground work? Or would a low lunge off the knee be a better way to get some of the benefits? I sometimes just skip this part of the stretch since I&#39;m not flexible enough to straighten my leg to do the runner&#39;s stretch anyway, but want to figure out if there&#39;s a modification that I can do that can make me reap some of the benefits here.  Thanks! And thank you for being a fantastic leader through this practice!",Bonnie Davis,2020-05-09T05:13:24Z,0
I am no yoga expert by any stretch (haha) but I do have problems with my knees and have arthritic toes.  When a position hurts my knees I try to double up the mat real quick to see if that makes a difference or try shifting my weight a bit.  I can&#39;t tuck my toes all the time so just lay my feet flat for most poses.  I&#39;ve never had a yoga instructor tell me I was doing it wrong or shouldn&#39;t do that - I think the important thing is to not hurt yourself and to do what feels good. PS I&#39;ve never been able to straighten my leg during runners stretch - my excuse is that my legs are too long but I know its just my muscles are too tight :),B Suvanto,2020-05-28T14:57:11Z,0

It&#39;s actually better in the evenings, FOR ME, because it kind of relaxes my brain. But I have to say one thing... Adriene, I&#39;m pretty sure your toes/feet are the strongest in the world! When you go from plank to downward facing dog, it&#39;s almost like your balancing on your big toes!! How on EARTH is that real HAHAHA &lt;3",_tararoot,2020-04-16T02:20:47Z,0

So I started the home series on april first which was perfect and filled me with joy because april has 30 days and it seemed to be a perfect healthy challenge in this quarantaine period. Unfortunately I started to feel pain in my left wrist 2 days ago and today was the day I knew it would be damaging to continue the practice (this practice to be precise). Ofcourse it makes me kind of sad that I won&#39;t be able to reach my goal anymore but it&#39;s more than that. Doing yoga for the last two weeks (and seperate video&#39;s before) really made a great positive difference in how I feel physically and (maybe even more important) mentally . This morning I did the video for pain in the wrists and I learned more about the right technique so I can be more aware in the future. But for now in the meantime I need to take a rest and let my wrist get back to normal again. So I will complete the series later. For now I&#39;m searching for video&#39;s without having to use my wrists. If you have any yoga with adriene video recommendations about that I&#39;d love to hear! Also if you&#39;ve gone through something similar I&#39;d love to hear how you handled it :)! Kind regards and a big breath from The Netherlands.,Noortje Bosma,2020-04-15T20:23:43Z,0

"Hello Adriene!<br />My name´s Angelika. I´ve been practicing yoga with you since 4 years (with breaks I need to admit). However, when it comes to yoga I always choose your practice. I like the warmth that comes from you towards participants of your classes online. Thank you so much for sharing these classes with us!<br />I am writing to you with one question. My elbows are double jointed. Are the exercises when I need to support myself on one hand safe for me? I mean for example the moment when I need to hug my ribs. The supporting hand is shaking so much and it´s uncomfortable feeling. A lot of personal trainers recommend to me exercising with bent elbows but in this case I can´t maintain the bent arm. I need your advice if I should practice this type of exercises in short periods of times (just some seconds) or in my case it´s better to just give up them.<br />Lots of love and happy Easter! <br />Angelika",Angelika Jagłowska,2020-04-12T18:24:09Z,0

"WOW, the HOME playlist is my first ever experience with yoga and it has brought such a change to my life already!! I never expected to keep up with the daily practices, let alone to look forward to them.. So far, I&#39;ve always done my practice in the morning. Today likewise (day 14 for me). However, I had such an emotionally draining day today that I decided to chuck in a second practice this evening. And OH MY GOSH, this RESET practice was exactly what I needed!! The fast pace, the flow, the lion&#39;s breaths and the little moments of pure pride when I felt totally in control of certain poses that I thought I wouldn&#39;t be able to master.. I know it&#39;s only day 15 but I truly feel like this might change my entire life! THANK YOU ADRIENE!!",Liesbeth De Vreese,2020-02-14T19:31:10Z,0

"Second time falling off the wagon but I&#39;m not giving up yet. Travelling for school put a huge damper on my practice, but the beginning of the semester is a great time to reset. This flow was great, I still feel really stiff and unsure of myself in different postures (lunges are the bane of my existence), but I&#39;m finding greater ease as I continue practicing. It also helps that I&#39;m back on my thicker mat, which takes a lot of pressure of my wrists and knees, making down dog so much more comfortable. Namaste everyone",honey Blue,2020-02-09T15:49:04Z,0

I&#39;ve been so afraid of the posture before and usually fall out of it or don&#39;t even try it, but something about this video made me want to give it another go and I DID IT. Both sides! I felt SO GOOD that I was smiling the rest of the video. Thank you Adriene!!",kizzyneetyan,2020-02-06T15:33:49Z,0

Maybe it’s the fact I had to walk in a snowstorm this morning to run urgent errands and get to church.  Maybe it’s that wheeze in my lungs.

"WOW Return - Reset these titles/intentions fit so perfectly to my 30 Days of Yoga journey! On day 12 I got sick and had to pause my yoga journey. My dry cough didn&#39;t let me sleep or eat properly and I got really frustrated because of all the to dos and tasks ahead of me... But the doc forced me to take a break, to hit the pause-button and come to a rest what I tried out and didn&#39;t feel too bad actually. My mind lifted and I kinda felt energised though being quite sick still. Today was such a lovely day and I felt strong enough to continue my Yoga Journey at Day 13, 14 and 15- Grow, Return and Reset. What a nice coincidence! As if Adriene knew that this would happen to some Yogis at this point of the journey :) so... hi I&#39;m back! THANK YOU SO MUCH Adriene!

And I have to say that this is one of my favorite sequences of all time. It might be because I am partial to standing wide legged forward fold so any time that comes up I&#39;m a happy girl. Still, this class is beautiful. It&#39;s just the right combination of stretch and strength for me. Yesterday was a hideously stressful day and, wow. This did indeed help with a reset.

"Good morning.  Well, it’s still cold here - warming up to -31C...  I woke up, grabbed my coffee, let my dog out and in and headed downstairs to do yoga.  PJ’s and housecoat still on, bed head... and Lonnie looking at me like I’m crazy.  Two sips into the coffee and I’m in a mountain pose.  Realized to be coordinated this quickly after waking, needs more than 3 sips of coffee.  But, continue I must... I showed up and that’s the worst part.  So, I’m slowly getting more coordinated as we go along and all was going good - yes, easy on wide stance on toes...  please with that.  Then did three lions breaths into my pj tops, to find Ms. Lonnie coming to check on if I’m okay, I see my pj’s top move as she tries to comfort and check up on me.  Then as were in some version of child’s pose...  she’s hugging me, giving me kisses, sorry Adriene, but you lost me for a few seconds, while I laugh and scratch her and reassure her that I’m fine.

"Can we take a moment to appreciate how beautiful of a flow this was. Adriene really outdid herself, this was so lovely <br /><br />I did real side planks today! This has been a goal for me for some time. Something shifted and  it just happened. I didn’t even realize what was happening until I realized I actually did it. Amazing",Chyenne Porter,2020-01-17T08:56:22Z,942

"I have been practicing yoga for a few years, relying on gym classes, after a few months of little exercise due to pandemic i discovered adrienne 30 day breathe yoga,  she has helped mentally and physically ( i have copd) in on repeat of this practice,  its amazing . When gymnasium open again i wont be going back. Adrienne is the best .",Barbara Randle,2021-02-25T09:11:20Z,0

Chyenne Porter Yes I felt the exact same thing! I am amazed with how much effort Adriene puts into her practice. Not just the guiding us but also lining up the routines to make everything feel seamless and natural. I dont have proper words other than she’s the best :D,F L,2020-07-11T09:13:58Z,2

"Catching up on day 16 and followed that beautiful practice with this gentle but strong flow! I feel so peaceful and ready to walk in to school with my heart open. I&#39;m feeling so lucky right now that I have a safe home, food in the cupboard, a job where I can care deeply about people and the time to spend on my mat. Thank you Adriene you remind me daily of the power of gratitude! Ollie the dog was crazy after his walk, growling and playing with my yoga blanket but the magic of the practice has him crashed out on the mat now! Thank you so much ❤️",Jo Chew,2020-01-17T08:23:33Z,0

"Yes, I found something new. I found a flow I did not have on the previous days. I also sensed an openness, and an integration between my spirit, soul, and body. But something I can not put words to happened also.  It was like I felt an intimacy....something that I am actually afraid of, but it happened anyway. I guess I was ready for it. You are right Adriene, miracles of transformation is happening! Boy, you and the Universe make a powerful combo!<br /><br />I know that such powerful instruments, as your self, of the divine need covering and protection, and you better believe I am praying the Angle watch over you and keep you covered...it is my passion to do so.",Nickolet Allen,2020-01-17T07:13:16Z,0
"I did this practice yesterday and am still reaping the benefits! Thanks to the hip-opening practice from the day before, I was able to get my head lower than I ever have before in standing wide-legged forward fold... and it felt so good!

Whenever I do my yoga practice, I have my three bunnies and my dog to help me... breathe lots of love in and lots of love out &lt;3",crazycristal25,2020-01-17T07:09:03Z,0

"Not going to lie, today my body cracked more than a glowstick 😂 I love that I could do my best today and be happy with it, despite not being perfect. This session helped to drive home the idea of just turning up to the mat and listening to your body. Thank you Adriene 🙏",Simply Jaala xo,2020-01-17T06:09:56Z,5
"Day 15 done although very very late into the night! Had a super busy day, did more than planned so needed time to recharge before yoga. But I&#39;ve taken a policy of not sleeping before I do my daily yoga and I&#39;ve managed 15 days in a row including days where I was in pain or super anxious or just not motivated to do anything :D But even on the days that I find myself not hyped for yoga, I&#39;m still determined to do the full 30 days and I always feel a little better afterwards, even if I might not be willing to admit it in the immediate aftermath. 15 days done which in itself is an achievement and marks the halfway point of a 30 day dedication to myself",Emily Gleeson,2020-01-17T06:03:43Z,1

"Yes!! All my life I wished there was a reset button-but who knew it would be found in yoga. Haha. <br /><br />This week, I tried some new stuff, met some new people...but I noticed that perhaps Yoga has been increasing my sensitivity to the energy of others. Be it erratic, stable (rarely) or whatever form the energy takes, I feel like I can feel it tenfold now...and lately I end up doing two or more practices to help me ground out all the energies I experience throughout the day. I even went on a long hike this week, and I crave being home even more now. <br /><br />But maybe that&#39;s why resets are important. Love and namastes to all! Going to do this practice again tomorrow with Light-Throat Chakra 🙏",Jay-Ram Rajendra,2020-01-17T05:48:51Z,0

"I was in a not-so-great place physically today, dealing with menorrhagia and since I&#39;m still new to yoga I was a bit concerned about putting too much strain on certain muscles. I was thinking about just bowing out completely for the day and continuing from day 15 tomorrow, but fifteen days in I was surprised to find that the thought of being a day behind the &#39;live&#39; videos was sad to me! So instead I followed along at a MUCH chiller pace than usual, and ended up just sitting and listening during the &#39;happy baby&#39; pose. It still felt so nice to show up though! (And maybe I&#39;ll revisit this video on its own some day.)",The Rowan's Heart,2020-01-17T05:44:26Z,1
"Day 15: Gosh I am doing this on day 16. I skipped a day :(. But, for good reason. I think all this positive intention setting is aligning things for me. I might be getting some new work in February if everything goes right. Keeping my fingers crossed. Thank you so much, Adriene. I am even more determined to continue showing up on the mat. I have started to feel little sad though, now that we are at the half mark. But, I am grateful for everything. Namaste!",rubyveil19,2020-01-17T05:41:31Z,0
"At the beginning of this journey my intentions were solid set on the goal of wanting to live a healthier life style and routine. I was only really concerned about gaining flexibility and toning my muscles a bit more. Now that we&#39;re at the halfway point I realize that it&#39;s something deeper that has really been bothering me. Changes in life that I&#39;m not in control of, regrets of things I wish I had taken advantage of, and saying goodbye to loved ones and friends simply because they are following their own paths. All this in just the last 15 days! This journey has now made me realize what my TRUE intentions are, being okay with me, just me. Taking the time to be by myself and get the self-attention I needed all while accepting every wave that comes my way with a grace and strength that I&#39;ve never found before. This experience has been more than what I needed.<br />      Thank you Adriene for helping me find that true happy place and teaching me to live by my breath; My Spirit. Namaste Sensei.",BronzeRiver23,2020-01-17T05:40:52Z,0
"Today was the very first time since I started practicing with you in November that I was able to do the side planks!! Until today, I couldn&#39;t even get into the posture because my arms would shake so badly. Today I moved through the entire plank flow and once we made it down into cobra I shouted &quot;YES!&quot; Such a joyful moment. A powerful milestone here at the halfway mark!",Courtney Yovich,2020-01-17T05:40:39Z,0
"I fell asleep curled up on my couch tonight under my weighted blanket after a long day.

"y&#39;ALLLL. the magic of yoga is somehow so subtle and next-fuckin&#39;-level at the same time. today, I kept marveling at how different my body felt when I first started yoga, and how a couple years ago, I would have been CURSING my way through some of these poses. I still wobbled and bobbled during this practice (mostly when my attention wavered to thought instead of presence)... but it happens :) &amp; we can just RESET!  <br /><br />Grateful for the opportunity to pay such lavish attention to myself and for this tender little meatsuit of mine. Grateful for this commenting exercise I started, for the space to truly just take a MOMENT and appreciate all that yoga has gifted me and what I&#39;ve gifted myself through my practice, instead of hustling and bustling to get the rest of the day &quot;done&quot; (guilty of this in the past 30-day yoga challenges). Intention and attention...it matters! D&#39;OH. Of course, of course.  <br /><br />No need to be anywhere but here; no one to change but self. NAMASTE TO ALL.",Grace Kim,2020-01-17T04:20:18Z,0

I&#39;m so impressed with myself, I&#39;ve been on the &#39;yoga journey&#39; one week today and I can&#39;t believe how much I can do, on the first day I did a headstand, the second and third day mastered it until I no longer needed the wall, yesterday I had cramps but I wanted to workout so bad so I found a video of yours exactly for that. I mean, I am deeply grateful with you. So thaaaank you, I hope I continue with this for the rest of the year and my life, cuz I feel fucking amazing, inside and out.

"I love this one ! Actually I love them all but this one felt great today. Sometimes it’s not just the practice, it’s HOW this one practice feels perfect for YOU on THAT day. Another day I might not feel the magic like I did today, and the magic will be there with another practice. That’s why doing yoga everyday is such a wonderful journey !<br />And this year for me is special because after doing yoga for more than 3 years, I’ve decided to start running too. For me it feels like a miracle because I used to absolutely hate running. But because of yoga I’ve realized just how enjoyable, how wonderful your body can feel when you take care of it so I want to combine yoga with another kind of exercise and running seems like the obvious choice. You can do it anytime anywhere. And with the pre-run yoga video I have all the tools I need. And Adriene’s smile to encourage me lol !<br />PS:  to be honest I enjoy yoga way more than running but it’s early days for me yet.",isabelleyab,2020-01-17T03:08:44Z,0

"I had a really hard time today-awful balance, frustrated that I can’t swing my leg straight into forward lunge or walk to top of mat from downward dog, too afraid to try any one-handed planks. The only part that felt good was going from deep forward fold to star pose, and I was feeling all around pretty pathetic-until the RIDICULOUS happy baby pose! As funny and awkward as I must have looked, it felt great, I could feel yesterday’s work in my hips, and ending the session with a move that I could easily push myself into was needed. I think now that I’m over the mental hurdle of the half way mark I can be a little more forgiving to myself tomorrow.",Heather Thompson,2020-01-17T03:04:05Z,20
"It took me three years of practicing with you, Adriene, but I finally managed to successfully make it through the side planks! It has been particularly difficult for me because I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (which can cause spontaneous subluxations and dislocations), and I have dislocated my left shoulder at least twice, so it is usually unstable.

"Day 15 reset babe. I always have this nervousness when it comes to side plank but boy was today&#39;s practice good to me😁, I just flowed and taughts came and went and I kept breathing and it was wonderful, it such a wonderful thing to have one of those days where even when thle practice it&#39;s asking us to move out of a comfort zone and instead of letting the fear or nervousness get the better of us we just go with and find that ease and peace of mind. I am so grateful for that today, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s new or anything it&#39;s just that some days it just makes the daily practice  so much more gratifying cause some days when the practice is challenging and I have a bad experience with a pose or in general, my mind tends to carry it and when I am come across that pose again it makes me nervous about being able to practice it but even tho I have been practicing for a while now and I have all this vocabulary I still underestimate my abilities to practice different posture and I know the practice grows my pose cause I can practice posture now that I could not when I first started yet my mind always doubts it and today I had a break from that doubt and I am content and grateful. I have to mention this one thing that always reminds me of my abilities is when Adriene gives us her juicy pieces of wisdom, it could be a joke about &quot;wrapping the hair around your knuckle&quot; 🤣 or that it&#39;s okay to fall of the house but it&#39;s how you get back on it, some times it is such a joy to come on the mat cause I know I will either discover something new about myself or have a good laugh or both and for that Adriene I thank you and will alway be grateful to u for help me love taking care of my body, much love to u and benji and everyone who is practicing with us , Namaste Everyone and goodnight 💕💞💗💓💖❤🙏",Vanessa Morris,2020-01-17T00:45:11Z,0

"I’ve decided to dedicate most of my energy into taking care of myself in order to heal from some traumatic things from 2019. This morning for whatever reason I was feeling particularly anxious, upset, and hopeless, even while spending time with a dear friend. I rushed into this practice trying to rid myself of these consuming thoughts without much luck, which was pretty frustrating, but slowly I started to feel calmer, as I expected. What I didn’t expect was what happened when I decided to pause the video and stay on my back to meditate for a while at the end. It was like my inner voice released itself and quieted my intrusive thoughts. I felt blanketed in self love and I kept seeing this beautiful sky blue color. My mind told me all these beautiful and reassuring things about myself, like why I’m a good person, why people love me, just things I really needed to hear. It ended with a phrase I’m going to do my best to carry with me: “You are everything to me, because you are me.” I really can’t thank you enough Adriene 💗",Shea Ramsey,2020-01-16T22:48:21Z,62

"Yes I found something new: vinyasa except, I could stay more longer in the asana, using the breath as you say, to stay  in the poses for more breath. That is one thing, the second is comparatively to DEDICATE last January, I can follow you with more ease, more gracefully. So that means for me two things :  first my breath is better and second is that my flexibility and my comprehension of the asanas is better. This day15, half way journey, was really a delicious one.",Susy Lacharité,2020-01-16T22:04:40Z,0

"Wow, that was quite a flow! I went into the practice blindly, with only the word &quot;reset&quot; in mind which made me believe that today would pretty peaceful and slow, or at least without me having to think too much about the poses, but NO! I really liked it anyway. The poses felt good, they made me feel like I was working on my strength while giving my body some needed blood flow. I really, really like the &quot;crawling downward dog&quot;, such a nice to go about it (I definitely am going to integrate it!). The side planks were a favorite as well - on the harder side, yes, but in an &quot;hello, pretty body, let&#39;s work this out, ya know you got this!&quot;. All in all, this was a great practice.

Today was eye opening. I was able to really enjoy the flow and see what doing this for 15 days has done for me so far. I felt more comfortable in poses that I used to feel hesitant about; I could sink lower into those squats; I could fold farther into those forward bends. There are still plenty of challenges (I still can&#39;t jump up to the front of my mat) but I am enjoying the growth.,Nora Durbin,2020-01-16T16:10:20Z,0

"I gave up on new year’s resolution few years ago as it only became jargon instead of changing the most important aspect of my life. Years after years, I always look for that ‘reset’ until I finally gave up as well. As today I finished my work at bare minimum with nothing’s so significant for my whole task in general. Anticipating Adriene’s session, I came across thinking about the very ‘reset’ that I need in my life just to jazz up the work I know I’n always capable to do. Adriene, you’re not only the answer but the literal reset to my life, perspective, and spirit to say the least. Xo",Ismi Damaya,2020-01-16T15:53:31Z,0

Curious if anyone else had this happen though... with the more active classes I tend to get a suddenly slightly runny nose 😅I do not have a cold at the moment.

"This was a blast, lol.  The wide legged forward fold was quite fun.  The second time around I almost fell backwards.  This practice was very heat driven, and is a nice way to get the body going.  When you had those side planks pop up, I was like oh nelly here we go!  I didn&#39;t think I was going to make that journey, but I did.  Had an awesome time, and thank you for making this video.  Have a nice day! :)",Justin4life,2020-01-16T15:38:02Z,6
"Oh gosh! I am not sure if the side planks are the same as the hip dips you have done in previous videos, but today I actually managed to hold it (for just a few moments, but still)! I think I was always confused how to place my feet, so your instruction was very helpful! Halfway there!!!",twistedscreamer,2020-01-16T15:37:40Z,0

"OK I hope that people don’t think I’m crazy. But today’s reset couldn’t have come at a better time. I was able to accomplish the side planks on each side and the twist and felt a sense of confidence that I have not felt in a long long time. After my practice I had to head to the dentist to get a filling redone and I can tell you that my trips to the dentist have been spotty for the last 30 years Due to my extreme fear. I can tell you that while I was waiting for the numbing to start, I used the breathing techniques that I learned over the last 15 days when I felt anxiety and fear creeping in. Upon taking those breaths and knowing that I am a stronger version of myself because of the last two weeks I was able to bring my mind to a place of peace and was ready for the work when the dentist came in to start. Thank you to everyone in this community, and most of all thank you Adrienne.",madlibpoet,2020-01-16T14:48:21Z,27
"Best. Asskicking. Ever.  I&#39;ve been doing YWA for two (or is it three) years?  You know when you go from three-legged dog to a low lunge?  I used to think my lower leg was just longer than my arms, making it impossible to step my foot up directly into the lunge.  I would have to sort of nudge it into place.  Today it just swooped in.  Just swooped into place.  I&#39;m nearly 61 years old.  Crying with wonder as I write this.  But, dear dear Adriene, you make me laugh out loud all the time.  You are a treasure.

Strange as I hadn&#39;t had a response planned when I asked the question, but the answer came on its own. The reset flow was a good time, especially when Adriene told us to get low in her rapper voice (please bring that out more HAHA), but I think it reset my mind body connection just as much, if not more.

Lion&#39;s Breath really excites my puppy (Ellie)! We are finally reaching the point where I can practice with her in the room and she stays off my mat for the most part. She does bring me lots of toys when I&#39;m laying on the mat though. Great practice Adriene!,Anita H,2020-01-16T12:35:03Z,0

"Dear  Adriene, This note is to thank you for &quot;being there&quot; .....  not just today, but  for all the many days I have looked forward to opening up what you are sending out to those of us in the world...... keen to feel your energy of kindness as you invite us to stretch into joy.<br />While I have  been teaching yoga in rural communities around the world for several years, ...... as long as  I am fortunate enough to have internet access,  I find that receiving videos and offerings from you and your great team of people always give me a lift and helps me feel that I am part of something  bigger.  Although yoga has  been my practice for more than 45 years, and a great life-line it has been for me indeed, the &quot;delights&quot; that you share are a &quot;sweet&quot; for my soul and a perfect addition to my routines.  When nothing new is coming in, I most often tune into your &quot;Fire Away&quot; session ..... just to make sure my own energy is not slipping.  Muchas gracias.",Kaylaira Lea,2020-01-16T12:11:50Z,0

I hope you all have a wonderful Thursday xxxxx",Sammy K,2020-01-16T08:12:18Z,824

"@KenTerminatedbyDQ literally never even entered my mind. I am here for the yoga and the community, that is all. Thirsty comments are rarely welcome or appropriate but I have my suspicions that since you realise they were thirsty comments in the first plase, that isn&#39;t an issue for you. I can&#39;t see any reason she would reply to you",Sammy K,2020-01-18T06:28:29Z,2
@Sammy K Noticed how Adrienne didn&#39;t respond to my comment.  I guess most women hate thirsty comments. <br /><br />I can&#39;t help it. I like Adrienne&#39;s smile and her feet (act like u guys weren&#39;t into them lol).,KenTerminatedbyDQ,2020-01-18T04:40:57Z,0
I was doing well until today.  I&#39;m afraid today&#39;s was too fast and complicated for me.  I got lost at the &#39;triangle&#39; stage.  I suppose I need to spend more time looking at the individual asanas in detail.,Jane Mackrell,2020-01-16T08:11:29Z,0

Wow. I am so happy. Today showed me how far I have come in just 2 weeks. I managed to do things today that I couldn&#39;t do earlier in the program. I think I am hooked on yoga practice first thing to start my day. I am sure we can do this. Thank you Adriene for your fun and loving style of teaching.

"That was great! Thank you, Adriene. ❤️ Could you please tell me, why there is a square hole in the door. I have been wondering for ages. It absolutely seems to be too small for a cat. And definitely for Benji who quit on us today. 😉😁",Angela from Austria,2020-01-16T07:45:18Z,0
Hi Angela! Kick plates are an addition to the bottom of your door that help reduce the amount of damage and stress that your door takes over time. They&#39;re installed on the push side of the door. The term kick plate comes from the fact that when people&#39;s hands are occupied they often kick the bottom of the door to open it. ;),Yoga With Adriene,2020-01-16T18:13:28Z,1
"@Jamie McDermott I don&#39;t know what that is. But it looks like a hole to me and not a plate. 😉 Not that it is important, I am just curious. I don&#39;t think we have that in Austria. 🙄",Angela from Austria,2020-01-16T18:08:41Z,0

"Beautiful, I really enjoyed this practice.. I&#39;ve never done Pyramid pose before and happened to have my back to the TV the first time so I had to stop and peak for that part and for some reason I never faced the right hand side of my &quot;mat&quot; (I don&#39;t actually have a real one, I just pretend lol).. but ANYWAY 😋.. I once I was warmed up I really got into it..
