"It is the final day of the journey but in every end is a new beginning. <br />And we can always start with the breath. <br /><br />I always get emotional on Day 30 because I think this is such a truly special and remarkable, meaningful exchange.

Thank you Adriene for this amazing 30 day yoga journey .üòÅ I have done all your 30 day yoga journeys and love them all. You are my only yoga instructor I feel like you are me if I was a yoga instructor because I‚Äôm kinda goofy and random too lol and love my fur babies. You are the best. I will say though I am a frequent yogi I do yoga with you every day but I did not make it through the 30th day video simply because of the no instructions I really like the instructions so I don‚Äôt have to constantly look at the screen to see what you are doing. I may be good but I‚Äôm not that good lol it‚Äôs just bothersome to me to have to keep turning my head to look at the video to see what you are doing. üòú maybe do it like your power yoga video where you talk over the quiet practice with like a soothing voice . I know I sound so dumb probably but it is what it is I am a listener and like to just close my eyes and have you lead me through my practice. That‚Äôs just me though. Anywho I love you and Benji to pieces I would love so much to see y‚Äôall at Bonnaroo they always have yoga practices there but I‚Äôve never done them but if you were leading I definitely would go because I love you both so much. üòÅ thank you for all you do ‚ô•Ô∏è,Brooke S,2021-04-30T17:25:01Z,0

"I think this has taken me about 5 or 6 weeks to complete as I haven‚Äôt practised every day.

I know stepping into the mat and be present took a little while to do, but you were able to do it nonetheless.<br /><br />Thank you also, my dear self, for being gentle, encouraging, and strong. I will continue doing yoga, not for its grand poses, but for connecting with my breath and to be with myself.<br /><br />Kudos to Adriene and your team for planning and producing every episode down to the core. And what more is that everything is free.

"Wow, wow, wow! I did it! Total noobie to yoga. Day 1, my upper back muscles were so weak and tight that it hurt to do the sitting pose in prayer. My wrists hurt so bad they were on fire and I thought I can&#39;t do this, my body is too broken (cos of lockdown) Day 30 and my upper back feels stronger and my wrists don&#39;t hurt. I feel lighter, stronger, but what&#39;s incredible is how I feel about doing daily yoga. It&#39;s empowering and rewarding. I learnt discipline in BJJ but lockdown stole it from me. Yoga, this challenge, reminds me of what I&#39;m capable of and to never let them get me down. To keep fighting and to keep moving, no matter what (depression). Thanks Adriene. Perfect intro to my Yoga journey. I WILL do daily Yoga in the AM. I plan to book privates to master basic fundamentals of Yoga as I do not want to injure my back and knees. Until then, I can do the basic poses I&#39;m capable of and will, and i promise myself this, I will be able to stand on one leg (flat feet) by end of the year :D :D :D Congrats to anyone who managed to do the challenge!

"ADRIENE, GUYS, EVERYONE, I DID IT!!! When I started this practice (March 1st), for some reason I decided to really commit to doing it every day this time, even though I can hardly ever be that dedicated and consistent with anything. But I did it, 30 days of yoga in a row without missing a single day!!! I&#39;ve been showing up even if when it was hard, even when I felt exhausted both emotionally and physically, I even created a personal encouragement for such days ‚Äî &quot;Just roll the mat out and start the video, don&#39;t think about what&#39;s next&quot;. It was always worth it, every single time.  And this last practice... It went so much better that the previous 30th day! I really did create my own practice, only peeking at the video now and then for more ideas or just to look at our beautiful mentor. I truly felt like I was meditating in motion, not just exercising. Thank you a million times, Adriene, for helping me transform and improve. Also, now I want to continue doing yoga more regulary ‚Äî if not daily, then at least a few times each week. I love you. Namaste.",Diana,2021-03-31T20:29:59Z,5

"I completed day  30 today. I was completely overwhelmed in the best way. I felt like we had been practising sequences of a dance for 29 days and today we danced the whole song. I did not expect this. I was surprised at how emotional this made me, in a good way. I heard Adrien‚Äôs voice in my head and what she had taught me over the last 29 days even though I could not hear her. I felt connected. I have been trying out yoga for the last year, jumping from one session to another, never finding what I was looking for. I have learnt more in the last 30 days than in the last year.  I look forward to continuing this journey now I have found my guide. I would love some one on one time with this lady. Thank you so much Adriene. I‚Äôll see you on the mat.

I just wanted to say this last session was difficult because I never knew when the movements changed, I am only looking at it from an iPad screen and kept having to take peeks.

It took me a while to accept all the practises as they are. And myself as well. But at the end of the final week, I finally gave in and did not force anything. <br />I have been doing yoga for about three years now and I started from your videos. It has been life changing, I must say. And every day when I come to practise, I learn something new.<br />Thank you again for guiding us with so much love.

"Wow! Out of all my years doing your challenges, this is the first time that I&#39;ve done all 30 days in a row! Each day I felt a new emotion: strength, courage, depression, anxiety, hope, peace, etc. Each day I didn&#39;t know what emotion that I would bring to the mat...but I made a daily promise to myself to make it there. I also have begun to notice how I carry myself/process things differently when I&#39;m off of the mat. I have incorporated the benefits of our practices (especially focusing on the breath and building a loving relationship with myself) into my everyday life. To be honest, today I was a bit nervous since you wouldn&#39;t be guiding us but to my surprise, I flowed through this practice with such ease. Thank you, Adriene, for gifting me a toolbox that I will always have in my arsenal. You are a true gem.

"This was amazing ! I started this journey at the beginning of February and lastly, I got caught in a bunch of things and didn&#39;t get to practice daily but I finally reached day 30. I never thought I could do a whole 50mn yoga session by myself but yet here I am, I have to admit I peaked at the time at 22&#39; something and then got back to it and didn&#39;t feel the other half go by. Thank you for this journey, I&#39;m looking forward to the next.",nola byrne,2021-03-17T18:42:41Z,0
"Wonderful series and thank you Adrienne for the challenge of day 30. It might not have been comfortable but I plan to revisit the flow and learn to let go. I followed the sequence but tried to let go of having to know the instant a transition came, to get comfortable with the uncertainty and trust what I needed.

Did anyone just do their own thing on day 30 and not look at Adrienne at all? It was so fun to just do what feels good and incorporate everything Adrienne has taught us and take extra time on our favorites. Love this idea of a quite practice for the last day.,Mora Ceramics,2021-03-16T12:19:21Z,46
"@Pat Bone I started the Yoga Camp from 5 years ago and I love it! It feels right, going through the basics. I&#39;ve done yoga on and off (mostly off) for many years, but still feel like a beginner. Maybe because I never practised consistently. Now I&#39;m on the 37th day of practise in a row, and it feels so different from going to a studio once a week. I feel my body getting stronger and more flexible every day.",Sara Dixon,2021-04-22T08:44:32Z,0

"@Mora Ceramics  It was bit challenging for me not get directions, but maybe you are correct &quot;doing their own thing and not looking at Adriene&quot; maybe that&#39;s what she wanted us to do, but a full 51 mins of Yoga is a bit much....in my opinion!! I can see no directions for 15 - 20 mins, but.....Even though I felt that way it still wasa GREAT class, and I am going to repeat Day #30 tomorrow as well, and start again the following day!

"Hello Adriene.  Today I completed my first 30 day series with you.  Today&#39;s final practice was lovely, yet I too also would love a version with some basic verbal cues (or even a ting/bell during some of the floor movements, such as child&#39;s pose, to cue so we don&#39;t keep trying to look at the screen).   Because I don&#39;t wear my glasses during practice my vision limits looking at the screen and an auditory cue would be helpful.  Finally, I would like to start another 30 day series.  I notice you have several from the past but was wondering if you, or others, might suggest which series would be a good follow-up to this one.  Thanks.",Mary S.,2021-03-14T19:05:33Z,0

Thank you for this wonderful journey. However I feel as though Day 30 undid the benefits of the previous 29. I could not relax and enjoy it because I was constantly watching to see the next move. At no point could I close my eyes and concentrate on my breathing. A sound maybe to let us know of a change of pose would be good. My neck is now sore from trying to see the screen to see what you were doing.  Apart from that it has been a beautiful experience.,Claire Matthews,2021-03-14T10:27:50Z,0

"I found this journey 11 days late but I started it anyhow and finished today!!  And like others who noted, it was emotional and I was proud of myself to commit each day.  Adriene, you make it easy to look forward to each lesson and I really enjoyed the email letters that came with each days practice and quote at the end.  Sadly, at 59, I wish I had tried yoga sooner.  Always thought it would be too slow and boring as my fitness has always been running, blading, cycling and hiking, etc.  Anything that brings me outdoors.  But the years of strenuous fitness activities have taken a toll on me physically.  Your class helped me so much.  Helped me to slow down and be kind to my body.  Learning the tools of breathing and stretching and posture, have spilled into other parts of my life and have brought calmness.  Your sense of humor cracks me up and having Benji there is so sweet.  I have a cattle dog of my own who loves to be near me when I practice.  Anyways, thank you, thank you, thank you for providing this to the community.  It was fun knowing I was practicing with others even in my own home.  I can&#39;t wait till I can try a practice a studio when it&#39;s safe.  I hear it is amazing.

Moved house, looked for a new job and I thought I needed a new BEGIN. I&#39;d have just waited for the mornings to jump on my mat. I was so motivated, It took me a while to finish just because of my work. I loved this flow but I must admit I am a bit disappointed because there is no voice to guide. It feels like it&#39;s something to watch rather then practise. I had to stop because I couldn&#39;t stand looking at the video ( which I normally don&#39;t do it) and trying and do the poses.

Yoga with Adriene gave me the tools to let my body get into the pose gentely, in a way that feels good, instead of just trying to  do the pose perfectly, even if I can easily do it.<br />So now I also practice moving with my breath in dance classes, and it feels amazing! <br />Thank you so much Adriene and everyone else practicing around the world, Love ya!",adi ofek,2021-03-10T19:33:53Z,0

"At first I like to say thank you very much lovely Adriene. Its been a pleasure to do Yoga with you. You helped me very much to trust and focus on myself. I think you and the breath will help me in the future also. <br />With this last session I have my probelms, it stresses me out to look all the time what you doing. Although I like to do free Yoga for myself, especially on the evenings (or at night haha). <br />Im proud of myself that I did this awesome challenge, but I needed a little more time then a month (nearly two i guess). Sometimes I didnt feel like doing that &quot;much&quot; Yoga and sometimes it just didnt fit in my day. Im a little sad about this part of the journey, feels like I haven&#39;t done what I wanted. But Im happy too because ive taken myself time with this. Does anyone feel the same? Plans are there to change right?",Sophie,2021-03-10T11:50:49Z,1

So disappointed not to finish this final day.... ¬†<br />The practice looked beautiful but I didn&#39;t know the next move and had to keep looking at the screen which totally lost my feeling of peace and breath. ¬†<br />Loved every minute of this 30 day journey otherwise.

"So I cried some big sad sobs as I started my practice. And I kept moving. I let the sadness pass. I trusted myself to find what I needed. I checked in with Adriene time to time to know even though we were doing our own movements, we were still in this  together. So bittersweet.  But smiling as I know I can find a YWA video whenever I need some extra support and on other days I can allow everything to simple flow out of me.

"Hi Adriene, Great sequence and a fine last episode for the 30 day breath yoga journey, but I must say I was quite uncomfortable with the way this video was made. The lack of voice-over means that even if &quot;you know the vocabulary&quot;, you have to twist yourself constantly to see the screen, i.e. what happens next. So please for the future reference: keep the vocal instructions there, so the viewer can concentrate on the main things like breathing and moving along with the breath.",MJ Siik,2021-03-09T08:05:48Z,0

@Yoga With Adriene of course! it was odd too because there was no indication that any commercials would be in the video from the scroll track.

I love these practices sooooo much and have been trying to do the 30 day challenge for years and never been able to complete it or stick to anything in my life. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever made it the whole way through... it&#39;s the 5th of March but have been been doing Adrienes 10 minute sun salutations most days in between. I almost cried when I couldn&#39;t todays one... I started to feel panicy because I didn&#39;t know what to do so just sat there feeling badly. I couldn&#39;t come up with moves myself... which I know is my own fault... and I couldn&#39;t see what Adriene was doing because I have to take my glasses off during practice. I just really wanted to do this!!! : ( I feel a bit defeated. I know that is on me... just wished I could have been brave enough to get there : Z Not all of us have the same skill sets and some of us just aren&#39;t ready to go it alone. I trust I will in time... but yeah ... just wish I&#39;d finished my first 30 day journey cos it meant a lot to me to do so. Still luv ya Adriene : D,Patrice Anderson,2021-03-04T21:02:01Z,0

"I finished the Home Series and now the Breath Series and enjoy them thoroughly.  I would like to say though that while I can appreciate you wanting to take a break from verbally guiding us, I found it extremely distracting to have to keep looking at the TV to see if you had moved on and to what pose.  I would appreciate it if you could just please name the pose you are transitioning into so that I can continue to participate while paying attention to my body instead of the tv.  Bless you and thank you.  I hope you receive this well and not as a complaint but as a concern and wish for improvement.",Dawn Weber,2021-03-04T18:23:23Z,0
"Thank you Adriene. I&#39;ve been doing yoga for less than two months now. I was really scared to start because I am overweight and I was terrified that I wouldn&#39;t be able to do poses correctly or be able to lift myself off the ground. The progress I&#39;ve made with your help in these past few weeks has been tremendous, not only physically but mentally. I&#39;m not scared to step on the mat anymore or try new poses. I allow myself to make mistakes and to try a pose in a different way that works for my body. I&#39;ve begun to accept myself, &quot;flaws&quot; and all. I&#39;m also not scared to admit that I cried once I finished my self-led session today.",Marina Popovic,2021-03-04T17:56:59Z,0

I just like to Thank you for Adriene i have enjoyed every second even when I could  do some of the excise your words and encouragement push me through. Learning power of your  breath  was a game changer for me.  I also liked how you made each lesson had humour at the right time  to take away the seriousness away from me and allowing me to  be. Not  complain that I can&#39;t do this also remember is a journey of small steps not  race. Once again thank you. <br />P.S I did stop when you said that you will not be talking LOL,Ian Lindo,2021-03-04T00:35:53Z,1
"I started on Feb 1 because I was challenged (I know it&#39;s not the best frame of mind for this, but it got me to show up. That counts for something, right?) by dear friends of mine and finished yesterday.<br />This has been eye-opening for me. I have been a martial artist for most of my adult life and that was a journey to my strengths that I desperately needed in my life.<br />It also left a lot to be learned.<br />These past 30 days have been a journey to my weaknesses: my impatience, my inflexible hips, my short hamstrings, the clenched jaw... It was very exciting to be in a space where I felt welcome with how I am right now and where I get to explore without a need to arrive anywhere. It even allowed me to have fun with these weaknesses to an extend that I feel confident to engage with them in the future without getting discouraged by them.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly the warrior poses have been my favorites, especially followed by the counter twist. My biggest achievement was finding a second of balance in crow that surprised me so much I lost it again. This last session I free-styled and I the hair on the back of my neck stand up with excitement about how nice everything was. I will keep on doing Yoga, probably dealing with lower back and hamstring first.<br /><br />Thank you for a little light inside that I get to carry around with me.",David Schmitz,2021-03-04T00:17:47Z,1

"I honestly always have a little disappointment about day 30 because I can&#39;t really do the practice without adrienes voice. I like to close my eyes or just not look at the screen for a major majority of the practice, so sadly, I&#39;ve tried the 30 day challenge with multiple different 30 day challenges and I am just unable to do it, doesn&#39;t work for me :( does anyone else have this experience?",DeShong,2021-03-01T21:14:24Z,1

"just before starting this practice today I was thinking to myself how happy and proud I am of my independence, and then this yoga practice was without audio cues which made it a very independent  practice, which was a little scary at first but also really cool to see I can do this by myself too. somehow every day on this journey the practice was exactly what I needed that day, feels like a little sign from the universe :)",Guna den hartog,2021-03-01T20:36:35Z,1

I am so grateful for the lessons you&#39;ve shared. Best of all, it turns out my cat is a little yoga buddy and loves to curl up beside me while I&#39;m in seated positions, a la Benji.

"Finally completed this today; like...just now!  I know I&#39;m totally late with life happening and all, but I&#39;m here.  One of the small but significant improvements was the cat-cow and the twisting pose (forgot the name), where I&#39;m able to reach further with both, given a tight shoulder blade area.  Will continue to work on that.  Side note: Is it just my eyes playing tricks on me or is Benji a slight tint of blue?  Must be my monitor or the reflection of the yoga mat/carpet (haha).  I also noticed that you have an image of him at the end of every time stamp in all the sessions.  I can see you love him dearly.  Your passion and dedication to your life&#39;s calling shows, especially in today&#39;s class.  For that, I thank you sincerely, Adriene!  Namaste, my friend!  :-)",Owen Chang,2021-02-28T21:44:53Z,1
I started on the 30th of January and ended today (February 28). It was totally awesome to stretch and move my body everyday. The most surprising thing to me was that I indeed did have the knowledge from the past 30 days to flow for the complete time of this video without even looking at what you were doing. Thank you so much for all the mindfulness I had because of this challenge in this stressful time as I start my exam period here in Germany on Friday. Now that I completed this challenge I can finally see myself moving my body everyday with great pleasure. See you in you next videoüíûüåº,Ella Belle,2021-02-28T21:41:29Z,1
Late to the party but congratulations to everyone who did this :) Only just finished this today. I usually never comment on things like this for fear of embarrassment and my own cynicism that creeps in but I think it‚Äôs important to share. I didn‚Äôt make it to the mat some days but I kept going. This was far from easy but it has been so rewarding. A month after the 30 days - getting to the finish with the trust and encouragement to do it ourselves was an extraordinary ending to a lovely journey. Thank-you so much Adriene and to everyone who took part - you are all legends. What an odd but lovely connection we all share. Excited for what‚Äôs next.

"The first time through I struggled to get through a full 50 minutes.   I also felt a profound sadness and tears even flowed.   This time, I completed this session - and although it was still a challenge, it was easier as I turned to the breath and dug deep.   I am going to continue with the Move Calendar and will be exploring other videos for my practice.  Thank you Adriene for providing this space and support.

That&#39;s ok, has been a beautiful practice. I didn&#39;t miss too much Adriene&#39;s reflective moments because I gave voice to my reflections and I even managed to do myself some compliments. Definitely I will return to this practice.

"I ended up being three weeks behind, but I finally finished!! This whole journey has been such an enlightening experience for me, and though Day 30 was an emotional one, it was by far my favorite. I smiled the whole practice because I realized how far I had come, listened to my breath, and told myself ‚ÄúI am strong‚Äù when I started to tire. This year has already been pretty rough and this challenge has helped me get back into the right mind space and awareness of my body and its needs.

"Well that made me cry. Joyously. The initial fear of &quot;what, all by myself!?&quot; subsided once I acknowledged the fear but didn&#39;t let it take hold, and trusted that I knew enough to do it - that my vocabulary was sufficient to do about 50 minutes of yoga essentially unassisted. And once I got started and realised quite quickly that indeed I could, the tears came. As a bonus, I was just lifting my hands to my head, lips and heart (for the right thoughts, words and deeds/feelings) when the video closed. Thank you for this wonderful 30-day journey. Transformative it has most certainly been. I think I might just go right back to Day 1 and &quot;begin again&quot; :)  Namaste, everyone.",Johnny Day,2021-02-26T08:13:03Z,0

I found myself going through old flows trying really hard not to watch you but to just feel my body and listen to what it wanted. I kept today very very low-key on my body because I have felt kinda sick and weak all day. But at one moment I took a peak at you and we were doing the same flow and I got way too pumped.

"Hi Adriene. Thanks so much for inviting me along on such an amazing journey. Have really enjoyed this challenge. I have a small suggestion - although I love the idea of the &quot;mic off&quot; I find I am constantly looking up, interrupting my pose to see if you have moved on. I wonder if a compromise might be to just have a short &quot;ding&quot; go off when you change poses (that would be our cue to look up to see what&#39;s next)... Just an idea.

"As a former yoga instructor, I really enjoyed this series! My daughter in-law got me to do it as a challenge with her. Just to add to Adriene&#39;s amazing teaching, I would like to add a little encouragement. To those of you who had trouble doing a class with no verbal instruction, I understand. However, A is trying to teach you the very important aspects of a home practice. The name of this series, BREATH, is so true. Breath connects your body, mind and spirit. It helps you get through the more challenging poses and it keeps you in the moment. If nothing else, breathe! That is the most important thing. Next, FEEL; you notice how A stops for moments throughout the practice just to check in on how she is feeling. Tune in to your body! Lastly, Trust. You may not be able to do everything in the course. See how you feel and do something else that your body is prompting you to do. It is YOUR yoga practice! Listen to your body and just go with the flow. I have had wrist tendonitis throughout this course so Plank Pose and Face Down Dog were out. I either adapted the poses by going onto my forearms or I stayed in Childs Pose or I just did what I felt like doing! When it&#39;s a home practice feel free to do whatever your body tells you to do.<br />Lastly, Adriene, it was a real pleasure to take this journey with you. I do a lot of your classes. You have a beautiful way of explaining things in a clear fashion that is also soulful. I picked up a lot of nifty variations that are so much fun! Thank you and keep up the great work!

Its a bit disturbing that PEOPLE are not open to the tradition you have at the end of every 30 day challenge of taking YOUR Mic OFF and trusting US to have the tools to do WHAT feels good on the final practice.

"I don&#39;t know if it is because I am new to yoga, but I found the lack of verbal instruction distracting (meaning I could not fully concentrate on myself as I was constantly looking at the screen).

"After reading the comments, I was surprised by how many people requested audio cues for Day 30. I&#39;ve been practicing with Adriene for years and I truly enjoy the tradition of following my own flow on the last day. After all, the process teaches you to trust yourself. For me, these 50 minutes passed surprisingly fast and I loved applying what I have learned in the past 30 days. I barely looked at the video and when I did, I often found myself in the same pose as Adriene, which made me smile. Thank you, Adriene, for your amazing work!

I am so sentimental because I didn&#39;t think I would finish this journey (first yoga challenge of any kind for me) and to think I that I actually did it and reached the end makes me so proud.

I had to overcome feelings of guilt that I should be doing something more intense. There were difficult days- days I didn&#39;t want to sit still and just be. but I needed this. I loved this ending.

"Wow. What an accomplishment for everyone who made it to this day! And thank you Adriene for being our teacher and guiding light thru it all. I really learned that it&#39;s ok to start off a little rocky, missing days yet you can always come back in. Around day 12 was when I finally set in my mind to stay with it and stay consistent - just showing up to the mat is an accomplishment (of course we all know what happens when you get there!). The second most important thing - &quot;my breath is my anchor.&quot; I really appreciated that mantra and find it very useful. Physically, I&#39;m a big, tall guy and very inflexible. I loathe sitting crosslegged and especially getting on the floor. So my intention for my practice is to change that, to get comfortable with these motions. It&#39;s part of my culture, my son loves when I come to play on the floor with him, and I paint murals for a living so I&#39;m always having to be on the floor. This 30 day journey has been a blessing for me. I&#39;m more flexible, more calm, and feel more centered. Fa&#39;afetai tele lava Adriene, namaste.",jaypzl,2021-02-23T17:10:33Z,0
"I think the idea here was to do your own thing, not follow Adriene. It was a whole new experience being truly alone with my thoughts during this- something that scared me at first but allowed me to explore what feels good to me today.

"Just finishing Breath nearing the end of February as I had to stop when I had gallbladder surgery!  To everyone who experienced frustration at the silence and wished there were cues, I totally get it, I had the same reaction my first 30 days of Yoga which was in 2018.  I remember stopping the video and doing a different one instead because I couldn&#39;t &#39;keep up&#39; and &#39;get it right&#39;.  If I&#39;m honest I felt a little cheated!  I&#39;ve continued to do at home yoga with Adriene since and my experience of the final practice in January 2020 and this one in 2021 is so different.  I start slowly, making my own flow and then glance at the screen when I can for ideas of flows or poses to move into in a few minutes.  I love that I can create a whole practice for myself with a little inspiration from Adriene and I absolutely see and believe in the rationale for doing it this way!  My advice is to stick with it and by next January you might have a wholly different experience of the final practice.  Sending lots of love to everyone who has started 2021 with yoga, may the year bring wonderful things for us all xx",Alanna Salter,2021-02-23T10:30:34Z,1

Strained a muscle in my neck about 15 mins in looking to the screen and had to stop :(  I love your vids and done them a long time but having no audio cues really threw me here. Normally I can practice with just audio guidance. I know the eventual goal of yoga is to make your own practice but I don&#39;t think those who can do that would bother with Youtube instruction.

It took me 50 days to do this 30 day challenge. I have such a hard time with perfectionism and was afraid that not completing every single session the day it was realized would give me anxiety and lead to me giving up as soon as I missed a day (which was inevitable as a person with a small child and a baby and a full time job). I even talked to a therapist about this and she said why do you have to do 30 days of yoga in 30 days? I felt like such a dummy. I&#39;m so proud of myself for completing this journey!!!

"I completed my journey today, because I started it a few weeks later. <br />It‚Äôs incredible, I truly have no words. It‚Äôs amazing how one person can create such thing like this. Everyday, I‚Äôm doing yoga on my mat, alone, but I never feel alone. I feel supported, I feel connected, I feel stronger. I‚Äôm so so grateful that I discovered this. I‚Äôm a vocal coach and I‚Äôm telling all my singing students how I‚Äôm such a fan of ‚ÄúYoga with Adriene‚Äù. The connection of the mind, body and voice is so strong, so I‚Äôve already started thinking about implementing yoga in my singing classes. <br /><br />Adriene, it‚Äôs a funny thing to say, but I think that I really love you. From miles away, you feel like some kind of sister. You must know that it‚Äôs very special what you do. You inspire me. Thank you for existing.",Debbie Jacob,2021-02-21T19:31:15Z,6

"(30/365)<br />i&#39;m feeling very emotional right now because this journey has come to an end. it&#39;s especially emotional because this is the first 30 day journey i&#39;ve completed since 2017! there have been a lot of difficult things and I had lost trust in myself to commit to a practice, but I wanted to prove to myself that i was capable, and I did! it took a bit longer, but i&#39;m proud of myself for completing the full 30 days! i&#39;m especially proud because this was the first time i was able to go with my own flow without hanging around waiting for Adriene to tell me what to do next. even though the 50 minutes was daunting at first, i ended up needing extra time at the end!<br />it&#39;s been a pleasure practicing with you all, and I&#39;m honoured to have Adriene (and Benji) as my guide and safe place. here&#39;s to trusting ourselves, and trusting the process. it&#39;s worth it. you&#39;re worth it.<br />love you, see you tomorrow &lt;3",honey Blue,2021-02-21T01:25:31Z,0

"Hi Adrienne!! Just wanted to thank you for such a beautiful month;) It began as such a difficult time filled with hopelessness and grief yet slowly but surely I transformed into the more grounded, optimistic, and aware version of myself I was searching for (all through breathing!!). At the beginning of today‚Äôs practice I was intimidated because I didn‚Äôt think myself capable of curating my own flow without guidance. But with your reassurance and all the tools you taught along the way I stopped doubting myself and just trusted that I could:) I even shed a few tears during my meditation because of how grateful I was for dedicating the time and effort to myself for 30 days to start prioritizing my overall health. Thank you for all the work that you do and I can‚Äôt wait to keep going on my yoga journey&lt;3",Haley Lifrieri,2021-02-20T19:18:11Z,0
"I just did my 30th day - I don&#39;t even know what to say. When the video started and Adriene explained that she wasn&#39;t going to speak and it was all down to me, I panicked and thought, I can&#39;t do that!! BUT I DID!! I took my time, I BREATHED, it wasn&#39;t perfect, but I went with how I felt and moved and breathed freely. I can&#39;t believe the difference in just 30 days. My confidence, my strength, core, flexibility, my trust in myself, everything. I still have a long way to go but I&#39;m so proud of the journey Adriene has taken me on and am so grateful for all she has taught me. I feel so emotional and just fantastic. Thank you Adriene and of course, Benji! The community you have built up around your amazing talents is incredible and one I&#39;m proud to be apart of.

"This is my second 30 day challenge and this last day was the hardest. I kept on thinking what to do next and if im doing it right. Maybe an idea to make one like this and one with a voice over to do it together?<br />I&#39;m doing this because of my anxiety disorder ( and other mental health problems) and every time I do yoga I feel a little bit more peace. I&#39;m not gonna lie, I do this in the evening. But it&#39;s a very big step for me to do this and sometimes it&#39;s really hard to step on the mat and I don&#39;t do it every day but I do my best and that&#39;s the important thing. <br />Thank you!!",VerybigNOPE,2021-02-19T20:41:51Z,1

"I&#39;ve watched your videos for years but I haven&#39;t done the 30 day yoga journey before all the way through and here I am! However I think not doing audio cues is a bit confusing. In passing I was excited to see a 50 minute session at the end woohoo!! If we were doing the same exact routine every-time this would totally make sense to do the routine together (It&#39;s very intuitive and I love it) but I feel like I&#39;m just lost without your voice now, you are so chatty and lovely and I miss hearing your voice. I enjoy the fact that you are holding space for us but that&#39;s not really why I watch your videos and I use other videos to hold space. I took a class on teaching yoga (I do not have my 200 hour yet thanks covid but I am not a beginner) but I feel like if I didn&#39;t have my own routine down already I would be totally lost today.

At first, I was a bit worried but I did a whole 20 minutes of my own routine and occasionally I&#39;d look over and say hi to Adriene. I did run out of things to do, mostly because I tend to rush through the positions, but I think that&#39;s an important thing to notice about myself.

"I remember stumbling upon this channel a couple of years ago and trying to do yoga... and failing miserably, hating myself every step of the way. Blaming myself for not sticking to routine etc. <br />Now I understand that then wasn&#39;t the right time for me. <br />Last year I started my journey of self love and radical self acceptance. It isn&#39;t easy and not every day is great, but I&#39;m still here! So it&#39;s a win! <br />I did this 30 day journey from place of self love and, most importantly, self acceptance. Adriene&#39;s words helped me so much through this month and a half (I took breaks:) ) and today was surprising! No guidance! It was so interesting and freeing letting my body flow freely. By the end of the practice I am filled with such joy and love! And surprising sense of unity? Of being a part of something bigger and better.

"2 weeks late with a few days&#39; break for an injury (not YWA-related lol), and when I first heard this was gonna be an almost hour long one I thought I&#39;d never make it through. Even during the opening bit, when she said it was okay if we laid on the mat the whole time, I thought that would be me for the last half of it at least. <br /><br />Did I stumble a couple times? Yep. Did I fall out of the one-legged poses a couple times? Heck yeah I did. <br /><br />But did I hold out to the end, even when I was sure my forehead sweat was making my mat slippery during child&#39;s pose? Why yes, yes I did. And did I also hold crow pose for longer than I ever had before? Hell yes I did.<br /><br />Thank you, Adriene. After this 30 days, I feel stronger, healthier (mentally and physically), and more centered than I have in... years? decades? Ever? I can&#39;t decide.

"Thank you so much Adriene, you have been my constant companion in UK lockdown for the last 181 days that&#39;s six 30 day yoga journeys! And today I finished Breath, I&#39;m so proud of myself having returned to yoga after a 15 year break! I now can&#39;t go through a day without yoga with Adriene!<br />Plus today is my birthday and I celebrate with all you lovely people...thank you , thank you.",Chris Mumford,2021-02-18T13:30:41Z,0
"Adriene, oh I have got so many things to tell you about. In 2020 I decided to create my own bucket list. Mostly because of things that happened in the world. I realized that I have so many things that I want to do but I have never done. One of them was yoga practice, two weeks straight, at least two weeks. Also in October 2020 I started my first year at uni. And it was the whole emotional rollercoaster. By the end of that year I felt blue nearly everyday. I felt like I was living in the nightmare. Stress and depression were literally my close friends. I thought that I was hopeless, that I can do nothing. I had big dreams that I thought I would never make come true. And that was a time when I noticed that you have just started this yoga journey. It was a sign for me. I joined this journey 30 days ago. Now I&#39;m here, after all of the journey, feeling so good. You helped me, when I thought that nobody can help me. Yoga taught me not giving up. There was many poses that I had to struggle with but even though I tried. Also I noticed how my body strength improved. Now I&#39;m starting to love my body again. And loving myself. I&#39;m proud of myself because I HAVE TRIED. If something is not for me, if I did it wrong I&#39;m not mad, because I know that I did my best. Yoga helped me with feeling down, with my anger issues and show me that I can do everything, but I need to trust myself. Thank you so much for this journey. When I saw that day 30 is 50 minutes long and without your advices, I thought that I won&#39;t do it. I literally panicked because I thought I&#39;ll do something wrong. I did it without any break. When I collapsed, I told myself that I&#39;m doing great and came back to the practice. After these beautiful 30 days, I know that I&#39;ll stay with you longer. I&#39;ll definitely check your other yoga journeys. Maybe it&#39;s time for Home? <br />It supposed to be just two weeks but you show me the beauty of this practice and made me fell in love with yoga. Thank you so much for just being yourself üíï<br /><br /><br /><br />(Sorry for all the mistakes I made, I&#39;m from Poland and I know that I could made some of them. I hope you&#39;ve understand everything I wanted to tell)",Klaudia,2021-02-18T10:32:33Z,0

Is the program good for weight loss and strength building? üòä,Lit Clothing,2021-02-18T10:01:01Z,0
"Some strength building but not for weight-loss. If you are coming from doing no excersie then you will see slight weight loss, but that&#39;s about your food intake as well. (Less processed food and more whole foods) i came from doing almost no real excersie and I lost about 2 inches off my body but I kept my eating habits the same so no real weight-loss, but I can hold a plank, for longer than I could before!",Victoria Gamboa Mejia,2021-02-18T16:37:09Z,1

Better late than never. üòâ <br /><br />I wanted to thank you Adriene for showing me the wonders of yoga and reminding me to find what feels good. You reminded me to remember to appreciate and love myself by making time for myself and by  breathing love in and breathing love out. I also wanted to thank Benji for being a source of inspiration. Seeing him show up to the mat everyday of this journey made me see that I could do it too and that once I got to the mat, I wouldn&#39;t regret it and that the hardest part was already over.

"That was so interesting. We were together and yet separate. I went with some of my own random movements that I remembered from past practices that just sounded good to me. Sometimes I would look up and see you doing something that seemed good to me, so I went with you, a step or a few behind. It was interesting to not have someone to tell me when to move on to the next move--I simply sat in it for as long or as short as I wanted. It didn&#39;t even feel like an hour.

Just wanted to say Thank you soooo much Adriene üíñ<br />I regularly do some of your yoga but I hadn‚Äôt tried a 30 day one before. I was over a week late starting &amp; couldn‚Äôt quite manage every single day but I complete all 30 days. This last one was so beautiful- I felt really emotional. I have been suffering with anxiety and this practice with the breath has helped me to slow down and take time out for myself without feeling guilty. I can‚Äôt thank you enough! Really enjoyed it ü•∞üòò,Stacey G,2021-02-15T08:49:11Z,0

"Hi, I really love your videos and guidance! I have been doing your yoga for a long time and have always found so much benefit in it. I just wanted to comment to ask if you could maybe make a video just like this one but with audio cues or something so I can follow along easier. I find that this sort of video just makes me look at the screen more than usual because I don&#39;t know when you&#39;ve moved onto a new pose. I feel that I can do the poses just fine without guidance of how to do the poses but I like to use these videos as a frame for the sequence of poses. Please consider making a video just like this but maybe just say what pose is next. Thank you!",Jackie Smith,2021-02-14T21:08:11Z,2
This is my last day. Yoga was never my story. Just did not like it. Until one morning my inner message was... find out why! So I made a promise to myself to practise  for 30 day‚Äôs. If you still don‚Äôt like it after that period it is just not your thing. Than I found you Adrienne..... I started 11 days later. But after 2 weeks I did see/feel changes. I became more silenced within. Thank you for the journey. I will continue the yoga journey every day. With love. Suzanne,Suzanne Geelen,2021-02-14T20:36:14Z,1
"This is the first journey I have done all the way... I wasn‚Äôt consistent every single day, but it was the perfect one for me because this year my main goal is to practice more self love and I always remember Adriene asking the question ‚Äúwhat if your breath was your spirit?‚Äù That always felt true to me and if that‚Äôs true than this was the best practice for self love as I got more in time with my spirit. <br />I gotta say this nearly hour long kind of freestyle with no guidance really was uncomfortable and awesome! It helped me listen to me. Adriene you‚Äôre one of the most insightful people I‚Äôve ever interacted with! Your comments always come at the right time and it feels like therapy.

"It&#39;s February 14th, and I&#39;ve just done this - almost two weeks since finishing with practise 29. I&#39;d dome all of them up to day 27 without a break, and I&#39;d been so proud, but then life happened and I&#39;d fallen of track. I worked hard to remind myself yoga is about finding what feels good, about choosing every day what&#39;s best for me and not some perfect score, but a part of me was still disappointed. today I came back to this last practise, and as soon as I sat down in the mat, I started crying. The following 50 minutes I just spent with myself, paying attention to what my body and mind needed. it felt so cleansing, so healing. I&#39;m glad I came back.",Laura,2021-02-14T15:34:58Z,0

"I put this last practice off for 2 days because the one hour time mark scared me off, so happy I got onto the mat to finish this journey. I also didn&#39;t feel guilty about the 3-4 days I didn&#39;t get on the mat, because those were days I was extremely tired and knew I&#39;d be better off heading to bed so even though I stayed away from the final day for 2 days, I&#39;m happy I did it now, it feels so much more fulfilling! This is the first 30 day journey of anything that I&#39;ve followed through, enjoyed and saw myself grow; started the first day in a bad mood, anxious, sore feet and my legs kept on trembling throughout the practice to finishing off the last day feeling stronger, balanced and at peace.  I&#39;m thankful to myself for showing up and taking this time for myself, thankful to the universe (and the YouTube algorithm) for putting these videos on my feed and thankful to Adriene for this journey and the love and calming energy she put into it.

Something new for me happened today in child‚Äôs pose with my arms back. Usually I feel like it‚Äôs just my own little safe space to curl up in, which is wonderful, but today I also felt it as an opening for my back body to stretch and expand, for myself to expand, almost like I was growing as a person if that makes sense.

"To everyone who&#39;s struggling without voice cues and has their experience ruined by looking at the screen: you&#39;re not supposed to! If you can&#39;t do it on your own, you&#39;ve missed all the lessons of the previous practices. But if you trust yourself and try, you might find that you can do much more than you think! Just breathe and move. Everything you need is already in you &lt;3<br /><br />On my first 30-day challenge finale, I was also annoyed and frustrated at the lack of vocal instruction. But now, a few years of daily yoga later, I look forward to it because I really do have the vocabulary, creativity and trust to simply listen to my body and find what feels good. I&#39;ve already been &quot;veering off the railroad tracks&quot; and doing yoga with eyes closed lately, and I don&#39;t need the voiceover because I can hear Adriene in my head anyway, even off the mat. But this time I made the practice completely my own, with lions instead of dogs, deeper focus in certain poses that I&#39;m normally too distracted to truly enjoy and an involuntary pause in the middle because the HOME theme song made me cry, of course.

"I subscribed to this channel the year Dedicate came out. I believe that I made it halfway through but didn‚Äôt finish. This is my very first time completing the full 30 days!! I‚Äôm so proud of myself! I pushed through &amp; only missed one day. I made it a priority to show up to the mat. This was very emotional, I started to cry mid way through this session. I reflected on where I started inactive and battling depression. Now I‚Äôm down 7lbs and losing inches. I‚Äôm stronger and much more disciplined. Feeling good overall and looking forward to continuing the practice.<br /><br />Adriene you cracked me up when you stepped forward without looking down that made me laugh üòä you spoke with your eyes üëÄ",Black_Butterfly,2021-02-12T21:22:00Z,0

"This is my first YWA 30 day journey so I didn&#39;t know what to expect on day 30 with 50 minutes. It was incredible. I did my own routine, putting into my practice all that I have learned this month and finding what felt good. It was amazing. I can&#39;t thank you enough for this gift you&#39;ve given to us. I breathed, I played, I smiled, I felt strong, I challenged myself, I cared for myself, I listened... Thank you so much, Adriene. I never thought this would happen but I&#39;m ready to get into the February yoga calendar. Which is awesome for me, daily yoga? I never tough I could/would do this. And enjoy it! After every practice I feel so much better, physically, mentally and spiritually. I feel like I&#39;m finding silence and stillness. And that&#39;s priceless. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.",Celia Saiz,2021-02-12T20:42:32Z,0

"As someone who is new to yoga and was learning a lot throughout this process, I was really disappointed in this video. I don&#39;t know if the intention was for us to improvise or to somehow be able to follow along without audio but I found it incredibly frustrating as someone who doesn&#39;t quite have the vocabulary yet to create my own flow.<br /><br />I appreciate the knowledge and the guidance so not trying to be too negative or anything but I really think if this is being geared towards beginners, keeping the cues in is a good idea. How am I supposed to know what is happening on the screen? Is there some yoga secret I am missing? A TV built into the floor of my mat? <br /><br />I don&#39;t know, I just found this last one to be frustrating and it was sad for me to end such a positive and fruitful journey on such a flustered and confused note.",Amin Lanseur,2021-02-12T02:15:14Z,1

"Today was my final day. I never finish the 30 day challenge in 30 days because I don&#39;t do yoga on the day that I dance. Last year, when I discovered YWA I did one 30 day challenge after the other, with a few other videos sprinkled in. With dance and a few unavoidable missed days, I figure I did yoga over 300 days last year. If that&#39;s not showing up for myself, I don&#39;t know what is. Who cares about doing 30 days in a row! Yoga, and YWA, is a core part of my life now, I now know the part of myself that shows up for myself, and I AM blessed. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôèAüôè‚ù§Ô∏è",Lisa Buell,2021-02-11T19:13:44Z,0

"I&#39;m going to be honest when you said today was a self-guided practice I was so nervous. For, the first 10 minutes I had a watchful eye trying to mimic all your moves. Then I finally let go and let my body lead me and I am impressed and surprised about how far I have come and how much my body remembers.<br />I started the 30 day yoga days late into January but I have stuck to it and even have a 30-day streak.

"When the closing theme song came up, I started crying. Also, in the middle of the practice, I decided to come to plank pose and I whispered to myself &quot;I am strong&quot;; I started crying as well. I was amazed to find that plank pose is that space I needed after various days of a low episode. I&#39;ve been feeling weak, as well as judgmental towards my need for rest; today, plank pose taught me that I am able to support myself. Thank you.",Andrea Nu√±ez,2021-02-10T13:10:01Z,332

"Man, all I can say is thank you, Adriene. Of all of your 30 day journeys, this is the one I feel I grew the most over the course of the 30 days. Not just physically (although I did find the bravery and ambition to add in a few more push-ups and stick with those core exercises a little bit longer üòã), but as we went along I found myself not just saying &quot;I am brave&quot; or &quot;I am worthy&quot; or &quot;I love myself&quot; but actually believing it. I was spending a lot more time checking in with myself physically, mentally, and emotionally. To my surprise, I ended up really finding that connection to center on day 18 that has stuck with me to the end. And, appropriate for the name Breath, this journey was where I really feel like my connection to my breath stuck with me through most of the practices. I don&#39;t know where the road will take me next, but I&#39;m excited to find out! Thank you again, Adriene. Here&#39;s to the next leg of the journey! üíö",Alex Harrell,2021-02-09T21:21:50Z,45

"This was probably the most challenging and life changing 30 day yoga challenge of all but I am so glad I made it through with y&#39;all!  Around day 16, I fell down some stairs and hurt my knees, hip, and ankle. However, I didn&#39;t take a break, I pulled through. I couldn&#39;t follow the challenge at that point because I couldn&#39;t do the table top position. So, I just did my own little yoga sessions with things I was able to do without causing more pain. After a couple of days, I was able to continue the challenge. So, I technically finished this on day 37. Now, I feel the urge to continue the streak and see how far I can make it. I hope by sharing this some people feel encouraged to keep going even if life throws all kinds of things at you. Sometimes I had to do yoga just before bedtime because I was too busy all day and other days I had a hard time motivating myself.

"On my first 30 day challenge, I was struggling a lot trying to follow her anyway - even though the idea was to do my own thing -and forcing myself, because I didn&#39;t know how to do things on my own and not take commands or instructions. <br /><br />In this one I barely looked and I even exceeded the time.

I have a crick in my neck from straining to see when she would move next and I could not enjoy the rest poses as I had no idea when they would be over. I also stopped at one point and just marvelled at her grace and fluidity moving from one pose to the next. Having said that, I loved the whole series and will continue to follow and practice.

"This was one of the most special practices I&#39;ve ever did. I was caught surprised when you let us ‚Äúfind what feels good‚Äù and I thought I shouldn&#39;t do it because I didn&#39;t feel ready for this kind of yoga. But I dared to try, to blend with your music and sequence. <br />Firstly, it was real yoga. I did those asanas I knew and put myself into this completely. Although we were doing various asanas, I was really pleasant when I looked on the screen and saw you were doing the same exercise that me! This feels incredible for some reason, a gentle flow of our unification. <br />Secondly, when I did all of those dynamic moves, I started to perform the lighter ones. Lying on the back, noticing my breath, playing with my feets... Essentially, this act turned out to be fully meditative and my mind was like still water during this. I felt like the threads between me and my surroundings, things around me were synchronised and we were acting from the same natural way that lies at the foundation of everything. <br />Thirdly... After my meditation, my mind began to rise and bloom with colourful light. I felt waves of inspiration breezing on me, filling my imagination with creative energy like they easily flow into my mind. This was really important for me because I am a novice author and I am going to compose books, so this inspiration gave me answers and keys to the questions about my world building that bothered me for a long time. <br />I noted I became more flexible, tranquil, stronger... This day I could grab my toes in the those asana where we lie on the legs and reach for them but not curving them. Also, I paid attention I could get into the &quot;happy baby&quot; pose and feel completely comfortable in comparison that I couldn&#39;t do at the beginning...<br />...beginning. Each conclusion is another start. When I started, I was inexperienced and open for knowledge you offered, now I know a lot of exercises and have some experience at yoga. Essentially... I realised now I am at the new beginning of something even further, my personal practices and new attribute to yoga. Before I have always been doing it with your guidance and I felt incredible but today... With the freedom you shared with us, I composed something new, my own sequence. Today is the switch between those times. And I got &quot;each ending is another opening&quot; means we exist in continuous process of moving from one point of present into another one. <br />I greatly appreciate your journey you guided us through and cleared our minds for something greater up ahead.

I watched that video so many times before I ventured into others and was from then I became a fan.

I have been exploring for a few years now with you Adriene from the days of Revolution all the way to Breath and all the videos in between, (it&#39;s been a few years). I don&#39;t have the words my darling to say exactly how I felt at the end of this practice, the nostalgia when I heard the themes from the practices over the years and the challenges I faced over the years whilst practicing with you til today. The theme from &#39;Home&#39; almost made me cry so I was already a bit tender, but when we got to the end, whilst lying in Shavasana, everything came pouring out, love joy, sorrow, pride all of it. Adriene, thank you, from my great soul to your great soul, thank you. This post was long but is goes a very tiny way to explain how grateful I am for you and the community..

"I started this on the first along side everyone else, and it‚Äôs was so amazing and beautiful. I missed a few days in between due to feel sick or exhausted, and even though I was two days behind I felt strong and amazing. Towards the end of the challenge I had to miss two more days and I felt devastated, I wanted to show up every day, I felt disappointed in myself. I came to finally finish the challenge today, and I knew the no mic was coming. I came with low mood, as I was sad to finish today and not when I initially intended, but as soon as it started I decided to do my own thing, only sometimes looking for inspiration. It was life changing. I‚Äôve done the other challenges and always strained to follow Adriene, but today I just did what feels good. Looked at the clouds and blue skies, the flower in my yard, and breathe. I didn‚Äôt want it to end! I kept extending it. I felt powerful, and I knew I was meant to do this today. As I cried at the end I said out loud ‚Äú I am powerful. I am worthy. I accept where I am today and I am proud of myself.

"I just finished Breath today and I‚Äôd like to share my deepest gratitude. I‚Äôve always had a negative relationship with exercise and my body. I used it as a punishment, and so I‚Äôve never been able to cultivate a regular routine or a good relationship with myself. I was always down on myself for not meeting a certain standard, not being strong enough, etc. And then a friend recommended YWA. Adriene, the way you carry yourself through this practice helped me see that working out or using my body was not a punishment, but a gift. You don‚Äôt TELL us to do things, you INVITE us. And those invitations showed me how to communicate with myself in a nurturing way. So when we got to corpse pose, I just started crying, because for the first time in my LIFE, I‚Äôve been able to show up for my body every single day in a positive way, and watch myself become stronger without any other emotion other than LOVE for who I am and where I am on my journey. This was my first YWA 30 days, but tomorrow I start HOME. Because in many ways, I have finally found home within myself.",Natalia,2021-02-06T15:56:04Z,0
I‚Äôm staying with my mom for awhile due to the pandemic and we did the whole 30 day journey together.

Going back to my breath, listening to my body, and using what I have learned in this program.  Hard to do but a worthy challenge.  I find myself moving more consciously this month, paying attention to where my body is and how it is working together and with my breath.  It has taken me slightly more than 30 days to finish...but I have kept coming back to the mat and feeling so pleased with myself when I did!

"I found this practice the most challenging of the month. I did it 6 days late, and nearly skipped it completely. I thought I&#39;d be lost without a guiding voice, and at times I was. I ended up going off the &quot;script&quot; and feeling my way through, with a stiff body and period pains to navigate. And by 30 minutes, I&#39;d exhausted myself by going through lots of positions (maybe) too quickly. So I just lay still for the last 20 minutes and focused on accepting my own journey and resting my tired body and mind. Very interesting experience! Thank you Adriene, for this, and for the whole 30-day experience. I&#39;ll certainly continue my practice with you as my guide &lt;3",Lucy S,2021-02-06T11:32:59Z,1
"Thank you so much for this journey. It&#39;s the first 30 day journey I followed almost everyday. I had some difficulty keeping up, because my job and life in general can be so exhausting and overwhelming, that it felt like my body wasn&#39;t capable to do anything more than to go to work on some days. And on other days, I learnt that yoga is the exact thing I need when I am exhausted. I want to be kind and mindful of what my body and my mind needs, and I am still learning what that means every day. But this journey truly brought me closer and I am really grateful to you Adriene &lt;3",Maebh Rabbitte,2021-02-06T11:28:46Z,1

"I¬¥m sure nobody will read this, since I was a little late to this challenge; today was my last day. And I feel like I need to say how much of an emotional rollercoster this whole journey was. Especially today. <br /><br />When I heard I will do this on my own I felt so lost. And the music sounded so so sad. I thought I won¬¥t make it. or at least not without crying half of the time. At this point I need to say that I have a huge problem with ending things; no matter what! Could be a video game too. So that was a surprise that I made it that far in first place.<br />Anyways. I felt lost at the beginning and tend to look up every few seconds. Than I heard Adrienes voice in my head from the other days and began to breath, relax and slowly find my rhythm. It was such a great feeling! And I can¬¥t say how greatful I am to say: I¬¥ve made it!<br /><br />But as I realized the familiar music in the end I began to tear up... man... I wish I could start again. I mean I can, but it¬¥s time for the next journey. I defintley will stick a while longer here on this channel.

My goal, when I started this, was just to be able to prove to myself that I could be disciplined enough to finish this journey. How little I knew back then about how much more I would learn, feel, and embrace in these thirty days. I am so thankful. <br />It felt so affirming to put all the vocabulary and tools in place, and to trust myself to find what feels good and lean into it. <br />This community is so empowering, uplifting, raw, open, and honest , and I am so proud of everyone who made it here (even if it took a little longer than 30 days like it did for me!). <br />Sending you all love. &lt;3",Alana Dyer,2021-02-06T04:01:00Z,1

"I have seen several comments that are critical of this practice without the guidance of Adriene&#39;s voice, and I totally see where your fear and discomfort comes from. But I thought I would add a comment for those coming to this video for the first time who may be scared away by those comments. After doing the 30 days, I promise you are capable of doing this practice without her voice. She follows the same patterns that she has for the past 29 days, so you will certainly be able to follow her flow, only checking in every so often. It also feels so liberating and empowering to do what feels good for you too! It feels so good that I can do movements that feel good for me, then meet Adriene back in the next downward dog and continue back with her when I&#39;m ready. It takes trust in yourself to do this flow without her guidance, but if you honour the principles of the past month of moving from your center, trusting yourself, doing what feels good, etc., you will find value in this. For those feeling a bit lonely in this practice, I totally see that and you are valid, but I also think it&#39;s so nice to just simply do yoga along side her, rather than trying to copy what she does. I would put your laptop somewhere high, like a desk or bed, so you can easily look up and see her. I felt amazing after this, and you will too!",Robyn Christine,2021-02-06T01:03:59Z,7
I think it&#39;s telling that you assume people dislike this video out of fear. You can be several years into your yoga practice and still not be able to create your own flow on the fly. And if you can why would you even be using a YouTube video? Plenty of us had massive trouble with this video because we don&#39;t know what move comes next or how long we should be holding for and that&#39;s why we do youtube yoga videos in the first place.,Prosateuse,2021-02-08T03:27:06Z,0

Thank you so much for this wonderful series, I started this new year with the goal of wanting to feel refreshed in the morning, no more &quot;scrolling through my phone the first thing when i wake up.&quot; so i started doing quick 10 min yoga sessions in the morning, but i was always lost when it came to the breath which i knew was a fundamental part of yoga. i didn&#39;t know that you made 30 day yoga series every year so i was pleasantly surprised to see that you created a series on breath for this year. learning how to control my breath (and the types of breath there are), has helped me tremendously! i&#39;ve used the techniques you&#39;ve shared to help get me through tough exercises, uncontrolled tremors, and i&#39;ve even warned my body up with them. <br /><br />besides the breath, im also really happy to say that ive felt myself getting stronger and my mobility has definitely gotten better. before breath, i was able to touch just my fingertips to the ground while doing forward fold, but i now can almost touch up to my palms on the ground! my calves have also started unlocking. i used to dread downward facing dog, but i dont anymore. my arms, back, core, legs....everything got better! again, thank you so much adriene!",Bryan D,2021-02-05T18:28:53Z,0

"Thank you Adriene for this beautiful experience. I was a complete beginner at the start of this journey and now I‚Äôm hooked. Carving out a small amount of time for myself everyday to pause and share the space with you and everyone else on their yoga journey has changed my whole relationship with myself, my body and my mind.

"Thank you Adriene for an incredible journey! I am not usually one to take care of my mind and body, but as the pandemic wore on both, it felt more and more urgent and your 30 day journey came right on time. I was surprised how much I looked forward to it, and how much I learned about myself. This non-guided practice surprised me too, and though it was a real challenge and I was at a loss for actions every now and again, I did have some moments of flow and sweat and balance and peace. And you helped me do that! I love your guidance because I don&#39;t have a very logical brain so I can easily forget the parallels on each side or the tweaks, but damn, I just did 50 minutes of yoga &quot;by myself&quot; -- kinda ;) love this community. thank you all.",Carmen Hermo,2021-02-04T18:58:55Z,0

Thank you.",Bri Hodgkins,2021-02-04T18:17:55Z,0
"Thank you Adriene for prompting me to realize that I know much more than I sometimes think I do. I  was surprised at how the simple reminder to myself of &quot;breathe in, breathe out&quot; was most constant as I practiced, more than body cues, and that that was all I needed to keep moving. The movements sort of happened on their own. My other reminder to myself, during the second half, was &quot;I&#39;m strong.&quot; I needed those reminders today, and every day. I&#39;ve never done a daily yoga practice but I&#39;ve known deeply that it would be nourishing. I am going to use this inspiration, along with the strength and commitment I experienced this month, as fuel to continue to begin again each day. It&#39;s been good Adriene, very good.

"It&#39;s been a few days since I finished this journey. I loved this last day. The last months and especially January were not easy for me, and as I used to love my own practice, this last months I really needed your guidance. I picked a video every day since October. It felt very comforting to be guided by your voice. This last day of the journey, I was able to make my own movements again. You taught me so much this 30 days. Sometimes I peeked at the screen and saw you were doing the same, a few seconds before or after me, which felt like we were doing a dance, haha. I really loved the music, it helped me to get in my body and in the flow. Peeking at you, seeing you doing your own practice, gave a great unity feeling. Also realizing the fact a few 100 or 1000 other yogi&#39;s practicing along with me.<br />Adriene and all my fellow yogi&#39;s, thank you so much for this Wonderfull journey.

I followed Adriene and did some of my own thing too. My crow didn&#39;t get off  the ground, but felt strong and with more of my body engaged than in the last 30 plus years of practice.

"My youngest son died this past July. I was 41 weeks pregnant.  To realize you have absolutely no control in life, is a debilitating feeling. I&#39;ve had a hard time being okay with silence and my own thoughts. Adrienne, this practice has helped me to feel a bit in control again. It has helped me to trust myself again. It has helped me to find some sort of stability. But, most importantly, it has helped me to love myself again.  Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.",Nicky Archambault,2021-02-04T02:42:19Z,1

"I was disappointed with Day 30. My husband and myself have followed through faithfully the last 29 days, day 30 was too much, looking up at the screen and trying to figure out what to do,  no verbal guidance. I don&#39;t know my left from my right so a little verbal encouragement would have been helpful! We did not complete the last 30 day practice because we got lost.  It makes me very sad, I have challenged and persuaded my husband to do this daily and am super disappointed in the last show off routine. .",Lorna Murphy,2021-02-03T23:07:28Z,1

"I am not gonna lie, it was not an easy final chapter for me as I found it difficult to practice just on my own for 50 minutes.

Let my breath guide me to find what feels good as I remembered that was the purpose. And that&#39;s when I started to fully appreciate this practice. Yes, it was challenging. But it also made me feel incredibly empowered because I felt like I truly knew what I was doing - simply building on everything the last year with Adrienne and this 30 days journey taught me.

Getting used to a certain way of practice for 29 days and then bam, it&#39;s different in the very last day it just made me uncomfortable. What is the point of having this marvellous teacher if she doesn&#39;t guide you? I guess I&#39;m a creature of habit and will find the answer after a few more 30 days journeys with Adriene.

But still you think we are all great and worthy, and I believe I need to see more of that in myself. Always a challenge to go without guidance, to listen not to your confident voice but to our doubtful minds and bodies, to find what feels good for us, for as many breathes as we need not as you cue... a very humbling and powerful experience.

"I&#39;ve been doing yoga with Adriene almost daily since the start of the pandemic and this has got me through some difficult moments. I&#39;ve just finished the Breath series and on this last one I was suffering from a UTI, did the first 5mins with a hot water bottle on my lap and didn&#39;t think I can do it till the end but kept telling myself I can do this, I am strong! I did the whole video in my own pace and honestly feel much better, felt like a little victory! What a journey!

"Thank you Adriene for another wonderful and transformative 30 days. I was hesitant about doing 50 minutes of unguided yoga, unsure if I&#39;d be able to fill the time. But by the end of the video I still wanted to keep going, and ended up in a nice comfortable seat, feeling the gentle breeze on my skin, listening to the birds outside, and remaining cognisant of my breath. This is the third 30 day yoga journey that I&#39;ve done, and for me the most impactful. I feel like I have relearned how to breathe, and learned tools to align my body and mind.

"Adriene, thank you so much!¬†<br />I did the 30 day challenge last year and it got me into doing yoga (almost) everyday for the whole year. Before that experience I never new what a difference it makes to practice daily instead for longer sessions once or twice a week. And how much easier :-) and way more transformative for body and mind it is!¬†<br />Last year on day 30 I followed your every move and was so proud to do that without your voice.¬†<br />This year I am even more proud and touched because I flowed freely, found what feels good (a little tree dance for example) and only glanced at you doing yoga beside me from time to time.¬†<br />I think this is the part of your work I am most thankful for, that you teach how to feel and enable others to do yoga or any other movement on their own according to their own needs.¬†<br />And what a cool thing to practice alongside so many people from all over the world.¬†<br />Love from Germany, A",Blauschwalbe,2021-02-03T09:05:05Z,0

"Thanks Adriene you have given us so much and so many tools to work with.  I admittedly felt a little frustrated in this last class b/c I had a very hard time following along  in my living room (aka &quot;gym&quot;) without your voice guiding me.  I have learned, through your guidance, to trust enough to just listen to your voice and not necessarily watch you, but this time I had to keep twisting my head to see and felt like I was scrambling the whole time.  Despite that, I have extremely enjoyed all of your kind, gentle guidance and cueing and while I could often hear your voice in my head telling me to breathe and relax and to let go of that which doesn&#39;t serve you,  I&#39;ll admit that especially in the resting poses, I kept popping up to look - &quot;what are we doing now&quot; loll  Thanks for spoiling us and giving us your gifts of guidance so graciously throughout these 30 days.  Much love to you and Benji!",Tracy B,2021-02-03T03:50:38Z,1

"I am a bit late adding my comment, but just wanted to thank you Adriene for this 30 day journey. I have followed along each day and found myself gently challenged and encouraged. I am still not able to get my feet off the ground for the crow pose and I suspect it might be some time yet before I do! But while I still sometimes lose my balance, I feel stronger, calmer and a real sense of accomplishment to have followed this through. This final session is always a challenge for me as I find your voice guidance during the class so beneficial to keeping my flow. I understand that it&#39;s to help us begin to see we can guide our own session or journey, however at this stage in my yoga journey I miss the vocal guidance. BUT, I was pleased to learn that I have grown on my journey and was able to lead myself along for a good while before having to resort to peeking for inspiration! Throughout the practice I could actually hear in my head little phrases you use, most of all &#39;remember to breathe&#39;! I genuinely felt quite emotional when the closing music began as this has been such a great comfort and inspiration at a challenging time for us all. It has given me structure and focus...and time to breathe.

"This was amazing. I don&#39;t know if I have ever connected with a yoga practice so much. It&#39;s as if yoga really just clicked. I could observe what was happening, I could focus on the breath, my mind wandered less. I felt so happy and good. I still do.

"this is the first 30 day challenge I&#39;ve ever completed and while on the journey I noticed that I was able to finish it because I loved what I was doing. I discovered a passion that I didn&#39;t know I had. This daily practice has taught me that I don&#39;t need to push myself to soreness everyday to feel stronger the next. It has taught me that fitness and leading a healthy lifestyle isn&#39;t about doing extremely difficult workouts everyday and that instead, it can be something enjoyable and relaxing. I&#39;m really proud of myself and anyone who has completed this journey!! Thank you so much Adriene you are a terrific instructor! &lt;3 (and of course Benji for being the calmest cheerleader and emotional support system to us all)",Daniela Jordan,2021-02-02T22:42:31Z,0

One year later and there is some sort end in sight to this deadly pandemic, love and integrity have prevailed on the world‚Äôs stage, and people are still coming together to practice yoga here on our special little corner of YouTube.

On the 2nd Jan I listened to someone say - do yoga three times a week and you will feel the benefit, do it every day and it will change your life. I remember doing onw of your classes a night a couldn&#39;t sleep and so I looked you up again and was so happy to find this. Its been incredible. What makes it so lovely is you. You have this beautiful gentle way about you with the lovely wicked streak of humour - thank you I have enjoyed every day with you and I feel calmer than I ever have in years and as I work and homeschool my son still - its helped me, us so much.

Maybe I&#39;m missing the intent here, but I don&#39;t get into the flow like I do with the regular classes where I can just close my eyes and listen for your cues. With this one I&#39;m craning my neck every 10 seconds to see where you&#39;re at and what you&#39;re doing so that I may keep up and get the most out of the order of things. I would prefer an audio only class vs visual only for the last one. Unless of course it was something we worked towards, like a specific practiced or memorized flow, where we&#39;re just doing it side by side. The mic-off instruction doesn&#39;t make sense to me.

I followed my breath, had minimal thoughts, took cues from you, found my inner smile, kept it simple and got out of my head with knocking on heaven&#39;s door, found myself bowing as you were bowing, found myself looking at you when you were looking at me. It was strangely connected, and absolutely wonderful. It seems you&#39;ve taught me alot, and I learned and grew in myself and my practice as a result.

If you had told me at the beginning that I would have ended up being able to do an hour of listening to myself and letting my body take me where it needed to be, I never would have believed you. The daily yoga practice and focus in on my breath has really brought a sense of control to my life and faith in my strength both on and off the mat that I definitely felt I was missing.

I&#39;ve been able to keep my yoga schedule mostly consistent with the uploads but I waited on this one. The thought of doing it without any vocal guidance kinda intimidated me. But it snowed here in CT last night and I had a fire going so I decided it was time. I still tried to follow along with the video for the most part but there were times when I guided myself... after our 29 days of practice some of it started to stick. And staring out into the swirling snow in the quiet of night seemed like just the right moment  I had been waiting for where &quot;everything was just as it should be&quot;.<br />Thank you Adriene for sharing with us this special practice ‚ù§ üíï,Ross Tiffen,2021-02-02T15:09:07Z,0

Thank you Adriene (and Benji)!!! My husband and I loved the 30 day challenge. It was so great for us to do it together every day. It&#39;s taken me YEARS to get him to do yoga with me. Adriene gave him the confidence. And it was a new beginning for me too as I had not been practicing regularly for several years. It was lovely to think of the thousands of others doing the practice along with us. Our dogs joined in every day adding some hilarity to the situation.

I&#39;ve learned a lot along the way; being present, finding strength, and the meaning of &quot;It&#39;s not about what you do, but how you do it&quot;.<br />I will defiantly try to keep doing yoga. Also the tightness around my shoulders has been gone since first week, so that amazing. But I must admit that this last practice was quite a challenge for me, because of the missing introductions. Usually I will just close my eyes and follow your voice, so I can let everything out, and just do the patrice. But this time I would have to look at my computer all the time, otherwise I would be to steps behind. That was quite a challenge, especially in downward facing dog!

Hard to describe, please dont think I am mad !<br />I have never considered myself especially talented or creative, I cant dance, paint draw play a musical instrument. but what happened here was remarkable.  I found myself just wanting to flow with the music, incorporating the yoga moves, kind of following what you were doing, but just going with my body, I was a ballet/latin/indie/tai chi dancer, just interpreting the music and expressing through movement what has happened in my life, what is happening in my life, gratitude for all that I have  .

"Oh gosh! As I started this video I thought, in quick succession, <br />&quot;I don&#39;t have time for this.. I&#39;ll just do part.&quot;<br />&quot;I will always look back and either know I did it, or I didn&#39;t do it. I&#39;d prefer to know I did it.&quot;<br />&quot;If I don&#39;t do this now, doing a 50 minute yoga session will become an additional thing on my to do list.&quot;<br /><br />I did the whole thing.<br /><br />It was very interesting to have no talking. I enjoyed being able to follow my breath better by not having to think about the vocal directions and incorporate them in. I did lose my breath as I was wrapped up in my family&#39;s recent judgments about my four year old (and I suppose my parenting). But I .. feel like the yoga and movement worked me through it? By the end I reached the conclusion (for now), that judgment is ignorance, and the antithesis (I believe I heard a monk once say), is observation. And I am upset because I feel judgements direct behaviours and become self-fulfilling-prophecies, however, I can still sift through people&#39;s judgements for any true observations, and take those and TRY to leave the rest behind / try not to engage. <br /><br />That thought cyclone, I feel, would have been a lot more painful and effortful if I hadn&#39;t been doing yoga at the time. I look forward to signing up for the next 30 day challenge. And will be adding instructionless yoga to me, &#39;things to do while pondering issues&#39; list!",Nicole Nasvytis,2021-02-02T11:26:52Z,0

I never would have thought leading my own yoga routine would make me feel so good. I feel like I‚Äôve committed to something and today was when I proved that I really learned. Being able to be able to lead myself for such a long time makes me feel like I‚Äôve really done something worth doing that‚Äôs made me a better person. Then I also just didn‚Äôt realize how nice it is to not have to think about anyone‚Äùs voice but my own in my head. I feel  refreshed and calm in a way I never thought I would have from doing this 30 day yoga challenge. I hope everyone else has gotten some type of fulfillment from this experience like I have and I look forward to doing this all with you in 2022.,Mo O'Rourke,2021-02-02T07:05:05Z,0

It was a long practice and I was really tired from the day, it&#39;s been raining for 2 full days (which is weird here in the summer) some places are flooded and I had to go to the office. But I did it and I&#39;m lowkey amazed. I got through all the practice without falling like a sack of potatoes, when at the start I could barely hold a plank pose with my muscles all weak and unused after my breast reduction surgery.<br />But I did it and I can o ly thank you, Adriene, because the entire month was absolutely perfect. It was the perfect sequence to get me back on track to being active, to get me in control of my own body and trust myself again that I can do more. You and your kindness made me be kind to myself and I will forever be grateful that you exist.",PolliitoAle,2021-02-01T23:45:54Z,0

"Thank you so very much for this amazing journey! For the first time in, I can&#39;t remember when, I  was able to sleep without pain meds thanks to Yoga With Adriene‚ù§ This past 30 days has been so transformational for me and I cannot thank you enough for the positive impact on my life!

"Started off so sad that this was the final video, but as I got going I could hear Adriene whisper &#39;I am strong&#39; and that became a part of me.... the practice just flowed and I could feel how much stronger I have become since day 1.  Thank you Adriene, my friend in this year when we can&#39;t see our friends.... this journey has meant so much.",Suzanne Lisanti,2021-02-01T23:40:00Z,0

"Oh Adriene thank you so much for this wonderful resource that you have created i am super grateful for your guidance. I first found your channel back in 2015 and I was a yoga wannabe but I only motivated myself to do maybe a couple of sessions a year. Then in later years I&#39;ve attended a few classes irl, did your video here and there but it kind of wasn&#39;t sticking or wasn&#39;t regular and then I stopped altogether. I then got a desk job in 2019 and my back was gradually getting more and more painful. I knew I had to do something so last spring I started doing some basic stretches  for 15min each morning and that already helped. Then I finally did some therapy and ayahuasca which I think helped release some old patterns and helped Reconnect back with my body and since then I&#39;ve been able to stick to a daily practice! I&#39;ve switched from my basic stretches to your videos daily back in mid November and km on it since. Might have skipped a day here or there but not frequently. I just completed your 30 day challenge (seemed unachievable even a year ago) and I think I find comfort in a daily practice now and made it a habit, I hope. I also find a lot of comfort in hearing your guiding voice and having your gentle presence on screen (love your random singing too). So thank you so much again because my recent achievement wouldn&#39;t be possible without you. üôèüèº Virtual hugs ü§ó<br /><br />Also, do you have a link to a playlist from this practice cause the music is lush üòª",Agatha Jackson,2021-02-01T23:28:08Z,0
I love everything about what you&#39;ve taught and shared.  Total fan and admirer.  Have been working with you daily!  I only wish this last practice had a whisper version of your voice... I can&#39;t look at the screen and relax into the moves I know so well because I can&#39;t see what&#39;s next.  thank you for all you do,Tricia Krzywicki,2021-02-01T23:26:21Z,2
Finishing just 1 day late. This has to be my favorite 30 day series yet. I&#39;m always amazed to be able to do yoga without guidance on day 30. It&#39;s so special,Mar√≠a Mercedes,2021-02-01T23:25:27Z,0
Thank you so much.  I absolutely love your yoga and especially the 30 day journey&#39;s although I dont enjoy the day 30 as much because I feel I am constantly watching you and not relaxing as much as when I can hear you.,Tracey Wassenberg,2021-02-01T23:18:21Z,2
"Wow, Adrian, thank you! I am so so so grateful for this journey we have taken together.

"I was reticent to do this practice yesterday because of the length, and because I didn&#39;t know how well I&#39;d do without guidance, I didn&#39;t know if I&#39;d know what to do, or if I&#39;d have the motivation to seek out all the poses we&#39;ve practiced in these thirty days, I was afraid I&#39;d just go from resting pose to resting pose and not challenge myself. But, I decided this morning to do the practice despite my hesitations, I did all the other 29 days, I should &quot;trust&quot; myself more to do well, and &quot;believe&quot; that I can stay committed the whole length of the practice - after all, the first practice was nearly so long, so I put my mind to this practice, and let me just say - I&#39;m so glad I did, this was one of the most wonderful practices I&#39;ve ever done. I don&#39;t know what I was so afraid of, I had all the skills and tools I needed, and when I fell, literally or figuratively, I returned to my breath and returned to my pose. I felt that Adriene and everyone else practicing was there with me the whole way and it was truly beautiful. I feel like I have such a deeper love for myself and my breath after this journey, and this practice in particular. Thank you thank you thank you to Adriene for all that I&#39;ve learned about the universe and about myself and this wonderful community for going on this journey with me. Namaste.",Aventa Tumal,2021-02-01T22:53:00Z,11
"I keep trying to think of something to say. And all I can do is cry gently and feel so full of love and gratitude for Adriene and every single person who practiced with us, even if it was just one day, these past 30 days. Thank you so so so much for this experience.",Marisa,2021-02-01T22:47:22Z,1

"I finished this round a day late this year, but it felt right for me!  I‚Äôve been with you, Adriene, since very close to the beginning. I‚Äôve always disliked the silent day 30, but this year, I found it. I peeked from time to time, but you have trained me well. Today, I may have done the sequences in a slightly different order than you, but I was so close to your choreography! My body knows what to do. Today, I felt like a true yogi. Thanks for the ride! üôè",Kara Macdonald,2021-02-01T22:24:20Z,0
"Adriene thank you so much for this gift you gave us. I could hear every word that you would say in different poses eventhough you weren&#39;t speaking. This journey changed me. I feel a completely different person now, more positive, trusting myself and the power of my breath. I am feeling so emotional that this journey is over, but can&#39;t wait for other journeys later on. Thank you so much you are a beautiful soul! &lt;3",Julia,2021-02-01T22:21:39Z,0

Thank you so much for this journey. I set an intention to get more into my yoga practice this year so when my friends suggested your 30 day challenge I knew it was a sign. I looked forward to my time on the mat each day and felt fulfilled after each session. This journey of breath was right on time. Namaste. üßòüèæ,neaseoul,2021-02-01T21:44:16Z,0

"this is my first time commenting on one of your videos and my first 30 day journey despite dipping in and out of your videos over the years. i&#39;ve never really had a regular practice. i didn&#39;t realise it was tradition to do the last day with no mic and was feeling intimidated enough by the 50min long video. but at the end, hearing the closing music, i cried so much. it was such a huge release of tension and emotion and gratitude for myself, my strength, and for you adriene. thank you so much. here&#39;s to next month.",Sophie Morgan,2021-02-01T21:32:20Z,0
"Thank you for this experience, Adrienne! I was able to do an upward dog for the first time in my life, and a warrior 3 first time since my baby was born 9 months ago. Also, didn&#39;t think it was possible for me to do 50 mins of yoga and enjoy it, without someone talking me through it. What a wonderful thing you&#39;re doing for 100s of thousands of people around the world! More power to you!!",fitmasala,2021-02-01T21:31:28Z,0
"Thank you for this BREATH journey. I have really enjoyed it and learned a lot. I feel so good thanks to you. I just want to say that I did not like this last practice. It was too stressful as we did not have your voice to guide us. Yes, I agree that we have learned the language and it makes it much easier, but I did not know what was coming after the poses. Here is an example, if we were doing underdog, I did not know what was next or how long we were supposed to stay because I could not see my computer from that position. Same when I was in a twist position or on a standing position. Your voice and guidance is helpful because in some positions, it is not possible to see the screen and follow the amount of time we are supposed to stay or what comes next. Sorry, I did not enjoy it. See you at the next one.",Alejandra Goyenechea,2021-02-01T21:30:22Z,1
"This little cradle of peace is such a treasure.<br /><br />I have endless gratitude for you, Adriene and your work. I&#39;m right in the middle of a breakup, the peak time where sometimes you feel like you can&#39;t breathe, and the whole first half I was openly and wildly weeping through the practice. I keep waking up in the middle of the night with those great big aching pains reminding me that my person is no longer my person. But every breath allowed me to move with grace through every tear, and by the time warrior came around, I felt strong and whole. <br /><br />I keep telling myself that I&#39;m going to get through this, and now I believe it. I am strong. In the same way I don&#39;t have to look down anymore because I know the earth is there for me, I&#39;m a little less afraid of moving forward on my own, because I know that this and my breath will always be there for me. <br /><br /><br />Thank you for giving me hope.",Alison Chang,2021-02-01T21:28:44Z,0
"Feedback: First off, you&#39;re great. Benji too. I appreciate you. My only complaint is that there are no cues on these final days. I constantly have to look at the tv to see what pose we are heading to. It really takes away from the practice IMO. Even if you did a tone for a cue the switch that would be super helpful. Be well!<br /><br />J",Vreeland Homestead,2021-02-01T21:20:58Z,2

"Last year&#39;s 30 day challenge took me 60 days to complete, and this year it took 31. It&#39;s crazy how far I&#39;ve come this year both in my yoga journey and my life. My biggest response to today&#39;s practice was WOW! Last year it made me uncomfortable and frustrated, but this year&#39;s voiceless practice was fun üíñ I listened to my body and made it up as I went along. Whenever I got stuck I would look up for a visual cue. This was an amazing way to close out this month and I&#39;m excited to continue my daily practice :)",DaniCrayons,2021-02-01T21:18:22Z,0
Thank you so much for guiding this journey. I was surprised with myself when I got pretty emotional during it as well.. but it&#39;s been a pretty emotional month for me and this really helped me on personal and spiritual levels. I&#39;m so proud of myself and everyone that made it!‚ù§Ô∏è This really helped me develop my practice. I&#39;m sad it&#39;s over! I may begin one of the older series soon.

"I loved looking up from time to time and seeing that we were momentarily in tandem, in sync -- so sweet. I was intimidated by the length but knew it was what I needed -- to trust and know that I have the tools to shape my practice -- even if at times I looked up for direction and ideas. Which is not the same as searching outside myself for answers. Knocking on Heaven&#39;s Door with no one but me to listen was a special treat, outside my usual zone, and made me inexplicably teary. Thank you for such a valuable journey Adriene and Benji! I&#39;ll be back x x",Una P,2021-02-01T21:13:33Z,0
"my dearest Adriene, you have done it again.  I completed the 30 days only missing day 8 which I later incorporated with another day.  This final practice found me with greater strength and I did not slack off.  I managed 2  &quot;real&quot; chatarungas  - not the belly flops or quick release to the ground ones -  lol, but also a few seconds in crow....  Moreover, during Shavasana, the tears came with a powerful emotional release which I welcomed with open heart. While I have done all these before and held crow longer in the past year, somewhere in this bizarre and crazy covid journey I lost a bit of strength while adding fluff instead ;-(.   No longer my friend, because of you and your determination to change the world, my world is a much happier &amp; peaceful place.  Namastadriene! XO",Maryann Miller,2021-02-01T21:11:55Z,0
"Amazing, feeling quite proud.

"Thank you for this wonderful series. It was my first one, and I got so much from it, including knowing I can come back to my breath, strength, and establishing a good routine around yoga. However, I found this session to be difficult, as I ws constantly having to look at the screen to see what was next. I understand it is tradition and will keep that in mind next time, but I found this an odd way to end, and rather stressful!",Robin Hamaker,2021-02-01T21:10:24Z,2
"Day 30! I did it! At beginning of this session I thought : &quot;noooo! I need your guidance! I&#39;ll be lost without you&quot;. But then I started and did 20-30 minutes by myself, followed my intuition. Then I picked at you and our gaze met :) My breath was with me the whole time. I feel my core like never before and my back is  strong. I have no pain, I feel supported and loved. I really enjoyed those 30 Days of BREATH.: your voice, your sweet words and your humour.

I was afraid to hurt my back again but the very contrary happened. I am more flexible and stronger. I have better posture too. I want to thank myself too for reaching day 30.

"I&#39;ve been doing yoga for years, but this is my first time doing yoga every single day for a whole month and I&#39;m having trouble believing how my body and my relationship to it has changed in these short weeks. I&#39;m completely shocked at how much more flexible and strong I am and how I can feel and see the physical proof of that during and after the daily practices. I&#39;m also no longer getting frustrated with what my body can&#39;t do. This is my body and it is capable of great things and I don&#39;t get angry when I can&#39;t reach, hold, or balance because I revel in what my body CAN do. Adriene, I cannot begin to express how much I love the way you teach and guide yoga. You take your job seriously, while also bringing a great playfulness and lightness to the practice that I&#39;ve needed greatly. Today felt so incredible practicing alongside Adriene and I felt for the first time that I could completely trust my body and trust my breath. I could go on, but anyway, thank you to everyone involved in this journey. I&#39;ve already printed out the February calendar to continue practicing daily with my best friend, who joined me halfway through this journey and previously said she thinks she&#39;d hate yoga and yet she now loves it.

"I was scared to start this practice - which is funny, because I&#39;ve so often wished for a practice more tailored to me. One where the flows went at the pace of my breath, the holds were longer, the shapes right for my body. And here was this invitation to do exactly that, and I was scared. But when I sat down with my breath, it hit me that the message was that <b>I can be trusted to provide that for myself.</b> I spent a good few minutes just sitting and bawling on my mat, honored to be trusted that way.",Youtube Watcher,2021-02-01T20:19:32Z,0

He&#39;s 14, very arthritic and with dementia, so most days have unexpected turns. Having you to guide me each day has allowed for a small (but emotionally large) regular routine. It&#39;s also very sweet to see Benji with you. Thank you again, and I&#39;m looking forward to continuing my yoga journey with you.",Kathy Lewallen,2021-02-01T20:01:35Z,0

I felt disconnected during much of this practice.  Constantly looking at what I should do next.  I think I missed the point of breathing and flowing into what feels right rather than worrying about what you were going to do next? I had moments where it just &quot;came&quot; to me.  I will have to revisit it. This entire month was such a journey.  I feel stronger than I have in a very long time.  Thank you Adriene! xoxo,A Lochetto,2021-02-01T19:57:46Z,2

"@Alejandra Elizondo you&#39;ve misunderstood me. You say you kept doing what you wanted to do, but I just can&#39;t think up what I want to do. Trying to think up something to do next is stressful and means I can&#39;t enjoy the pose. And you&#39;re meant to balance out each side of the body by spending equal time on them - that&#39;s why people go to classes or watch videos, so they don&#39;t need to time themselves or worry about not matching things up or not knowing what might come next. You say to look at Adriene for inspiration and people here are saying that doing that is a massive drag, that it hurts their neck and disrupts their practice. If I could make up my own practice then I wouldn&#39;t be on YouTube listening to yoga videos.",Prosateuse,2021-02-11T09:05:26Z,2

"Thanks for this beautiful challenge! It helped me so much through the month, to show up for myself. I am going to therapy as I am trying to navigate trough life with past trauma, and doing yoga helped me to breath and be present when I do something challenging. This year has been tough with covid and the challenges I took but it&#39;s so worth it. I&#39;d like to share my thoughts as I was doing this practice and I was a little bit lost in my head, I noticed something. As I was stretching and looking at my knee I saw an old scar, that was made when I was 5 years old and fell on a rock. The memory of it is so fresh, it&#39;s like it was yesterday, but there were no pain and no rock left. My past traumas feel like many scars, but it&#39;s like I still carry these rocks with the memories too attached from it. Like I can feel the weight and the anxiety. I think I never let go of these rocks. I&#39;m still learning but I think I just got one important lesson guys, I can stop trying to fix myself. All this time I just had to let go, don&#39;t pressure myself to do well but instead just be myself, with kindness and good intention. I think I was trying to protect myself from what could go wrong but it no longer serves me. Maybe in a near future I can let go of these heavy rocks, and even if the scars are still there, and I still remember how it got there, I no longer feel it, and I will move past that.",Fanny Auc,2021-02-01T19:39:55Z,0

I will say, after my first 30 day journey a few months ago, I was so frustrated at the silent long practice and made a comment saying as such. I come forward now, humbly apologizing. Now that I know what to do with a bit more confidence, this practice was amazing. I still peeked every once and a while to get an idea of what sequence to do next. But most of the time, my body knew what to do, my breath anchored me and kept me from hurrying along to try and keep up with Adrienne. And by the end I was emotional in a completely different way! It really is a process and a journey and I wish I had understood that earlier. But everything in it&#39;s time. Thanks so much to Adrienne and everyone who came along!

Haha I misinterpreted the instructions and started doing my own practice for the first 30 minutes. Then it dawned on me that I &#39;should&#39; be following the video...anyway I decided to continue with my own practice despite my initial reaction to stop because I&#39;d &#39;messed up&#39;. Now I have this practice to look forward to doing tomorrow! p.s thanks Adriene for all your work creating these videos - my soul and body feel soooo nourished :),corey twyman,2021-02-01T18:15:42Z,0

There are no words for the limitless respect, love and gratitude I have for you.

"Aaaand I&#39;m crying. Like every year. I&#39;m so grateful for this yearly tradition, this wonderful practice that finds me when I need it most. And for all the wonderful people doing it as well who share that incredible experience. Today, by listening my breath and my self-talk, I knew that I needed a more restorative practice, and I allowed myself to have one. I still managed to sneak in a crow practice that turned out way better that anticipated ! I followed my own path and I was so happy to reunite with Adrienne at the end. I was like meeting an old friend. Thank you so much !",Jeanne D√©zard,2021-02-01T18:09:47Z,0
"Thank you so much. This practice has helped me so much to learn to slow down. It was only yesterday, when I did this practice, that I finally learnt to listen to my body and do child&#39;s pose instead of pushing myself to follow the video. I&#39;ve decided to start every practice in a rest position from now on and ask my body what it needs and not what I want to achieve. And maybe, I&#39;ll want to practice handstands on some days, maybe I won&#39;t but that&#39;s ok.

"This one was difficult for me.  I felt a little bit like a bird being pushed out of their comfy, cozy nest.<br />&quot;But I don&#39;t wanna fly!&quot;<br />And. Because my Chromecast wasn&#39;t working all I had was my phone, and it&#39;s difficult to follow silent yoga cues on a small screen... <br />&quot;So how long do I hang in downward facing dog? What is Adriene doing now?&quot;<br />Hit Pause. Rewind. Try again.<br />After several attempted rewinds and trying to do Exactly what Adriene was doing, I decided that letting go of my codependency and &quot;flying&quot; on my own might be what I needed to do. I decided it must be as important to trust myself as much as I trust Adriene&#39;s lead in yoga. <br /><br />The cool thing was.. what I really appreciated... was that I still heard most of the cues in my head. &quot;Relax your shoulders and face. Press into the four corners of your feet. Rise from your core.&quot; Etc etc <br /><br />And I thought. Hmmm. So. This is about learning what I already know, cementing it and learning to trust myself too. Cool. <br /><br />I&#39;m not going to lie. It was clunky in comparison. And I have a tendency, when left on my own, to be less gentle with my body... but I&#39;m on board with beginning &quot;to fly&quot; and trust myself too.",Andrea Hill,2021-02-01T16:46:03Z,1

So I&#39;ve actually done 31 days!  Day 30 was a challenge and a treat.  As most of our classes have been between 15-30 minutes, the 50 minutes was quite challenging.

I‚Äôm very happy to say that with each subsequent series Day 30 feels easier and more comfortable - more familiar I guess.

On the 3-4 series I&#39;ve done so far, I always felt really lost on day 30, sometimes I would start and then give it up because I didn&#39;t really know what to do or I would feel discouraged, others I&#39;d just skip it.<br>This time, I wanted to stick with it, so I did. And boy, was I marvelled that I did almost the 50 min without doubting, trusting myself and with a smile on my face!! (And barely looked at the video!)

Should I start the Breath from day one and complete all 30 days this month or forge ahead and complete the final days. Something tells me that it is special to complete the 30 in a block form and maybe after being ill I need a restart. Any thoughts on this?

"I&#39;ve been trying to complete the 30 days of yoga with you since the beginning of the series. I never did; there was always something - I was too hungry, too full, too tired, to energized, had too much time, not enough time. Searching for the &#39;perfect&#39; moment to do yoga took me more energy than, now I realize, actually doing yoga. This year, I changed my perspective. I did yoga full, hungry, extremely tired, one day I even did it a bit tipsy. I asked myself - What is the worst thing that can happen, if I do yoga in X condition? I knew halfway through our journey, that I will finally do it this year, because my mindset was completely different. But I guess this is something that all the other 30 days and my yoga journey up till now taught me, I just needed more time than I expected :) Thank you!",LaraSch,2021-02-01T07:29:44Z,0

"I don&#39;t usually have trouble with Day 30, but it was difficult this year. This past year has been so lonely, and I think the connection of hearing a voice guide me along - even though I know I&#39;m capable of guiding my own practice - has become such a comfort for me throughout the months of lockdown and working from home and missing just being around people. Practicing without that today left me feeling uneasy and disconnected. That said, the other 29 days of this have been so exactly what I needed right now and really resonated with me and I&#39;m so so so grateful to Adriene for sharing these beautiful practices.",Jojo Orenji,2021-02-01T05:46:01Z,121

Oftentimes I‚Äôd look up at the video and we were in the same exact position, so that was very reassuring. I spent most of the video following my own lead and doing what feels good.

"Definitely a bittersweet practice today. I&#39;m sad that it&#39;s come to a close but I&#39;m so proud of how far we&#39;ve come. I&#39;ve been practicing yoga for a couple years now (pretty inconsistently) but this year was the first time that I was able to practice everyday and complete all 30 days. I was admittedly scared of day 30 because I knew there would be no cues or guide but I trusted myself and felt like I didn&#39;t even have to think about my next move.<br /><br />This practice has opened my heart and has truly helped me stay grounded off the mat when things might seem out of control. Yoga has become an important part of my daily routine and I&#39;m so glad that I said yes on day 1. I successfully held back my tears during the practice but definitely cried like a baby when I heard the outro in shavasana and all could think was &#39;I did it! I did all 30 days!&#39;<br /><br />With all that said, thank you for taking me on this incredible journey.",Kori R,2021-02-01T04:55:23Z,2

"Yoga is such a special and personal thing, and it&#39;s so beautiful that we can share it with so many people around the world.<br />Thank you so much for these last 30 days, Adriene. In the beginning I frequently stopped to cry because it was so hard for me at the time, mentally and physically. This being after so long at home alone every day with my desk job, not getting any movement because of the pandemic. It hurt and I felt weak and embarrassed. Your emphasis on showing up being the hardest part rang in my head any time I felt like not putting in the time or effort- so I did exactly that, and showed up. Every day. I could spend forever talking about how this has changed me, but I&#39;ll sum it up by saying I feel a lot more human and I&#39;m finally strong enough to call downward dog a resting pose haha.<br />Getting back into yoga was one of my three New Years resolutions- Breath really was the perfect thing, and at the perfect time for me. I will be showing up again every day, starting tomorrow. I can&#39;t wait!",Oh No,2021-02-01T04:53:43Z,5

"Thank you Adriene for the past 30 days and being my teacher as I made my first authentic attempt at yoga.  I did not feel comfortable without guidance and didn&#39;t make it through the entire video today, but I am still proud of making it through all 30 days and giving today an honest attempt.  Now I have something to aspire to in my practice.  Normally I would beat myself up over &quot;failing&quot; today but that is an old version of me.  My new story is of a man who shows up, makes an attempt, and accepts when growth is still needed.  A man who is present and is connected to his breath.  You came along at a time of my life where I&#39;m transforming into the person I was always meant to be, and thus you will always be a part of that story.  I am grateful to you, Benji, whoever helps you produce this amazing content, and all of the people who participated in this with me.  I will see you again.

"In a way, this was the most beautiful practice this month. I&#39;m so incredibly proud of myself for making it this far. I&#39;ve never completed a 30 day journey...I usually don&#39;t make it a week. <br /><br />I&#39;m proud of everyone else who stuck this far! It&#39;s sad to see the views dropping so dramatically in the beginning after the first few days, and each video gained less and less... so for those of you that made it here... congrats!<br /><br />There were times I kept up with Adriene, and there were times I closed my eyes and did my own thing. <br /><br />There were even times that I glanced up and saw that Adriene was doing something I just did, like knocking on heaven&#39;s door. It felt so natural. <br /><br />There was an emotional realization about halfway though of &quot;I did it... I did it!&quot; And I felt complete and total freedom. This journey was beautiful, and has changed me for the better.

"dear adriene, I have always loved yoga but gave it up as a practice almost twenty years ago because of persistent and sudden bouts of vertigo - i basically plan my activities around not inverting my head and triggering an attack. Found you in december rather randomly when i was looking for some lower back exercises, and then decided to embrace the 30-day yoga practice. It has been amazing every step of the way - you reminded me of why i used to like yoga, but i also don&#39;t think i have ever encountered an instructor who taught with as much clarity and empathy as you do. <br />3 days ago - day 27! - I had a sudden attack of vertigo during a side twist - and I thought I would have to just give up as I have in the past. But your encouragement to always practice modifications and work with what you have gave me courage to complete the last 3 days, and also not to live in fear of bringing on a vertigo attack. It happens, i still can survive. I can&#39;t go on, I go on. <br />I look forward to many many more days of yoga to come, and also practicing <b>with</b> vertigo as that is part of me, too.

"DAY30. Spectacular feeling to have completed it... our annual 30-Day YOGA Challenge, Adriene. It&#39;s wonderful each year for 7 years now with you, kind of losing count. Always an emotional moment at the end when you bow to us. We bow to you equally. I thought this one was never gonna end, the longest 30 days it seemed. Will you make the next one next year a tad bit more balanced with breathing &amp; exercises combined in each session, please. This felt like sometimes we had only breath and sometimes only packed with asanas, one after the other. I like it more when each session is more equally spread. Also, may we have DAY1 released a day sooner please, beause Australia/Europe are ahead of your time zone. You are an angel. BTW. your SI Joint VIDEO has helped me a lot 1,5 year ago.

"We did it!!!! I have tried to commit to a 30 day yoga challenge so many times in the last few years always starting from the point of hating how I looked and sometimes so determined to change that I would attempt 30 days of yoga on top of daily exercise routines and additional cardio. Usually made it about a week. My body was something to be critiqued not something I even felt connected to. This year after a crazy year I decided to try starting with loving myself for who I am right now and seeing what I could accomplish. This was the first times I‚Äôve been sitting here after a Day 30, successful. Showing up everyday, actually focusing on my breath not waiting for more planks. I could never have imagined feeling like this, able to actually spend a quiet minute with myself with no negativity and no thinking ahead.

"Am I the only one who hated not having instructions today? I am thankful for all you give Adrienne. But maybe just saying clearly &quot;find your own flow&quot; today would be helpful. I&#39;m the type who likes to do things exactly as instructed and this felt like a let down. I was so distracted in this practice trying to look constantly at my phone to see what you were doing. What I thought would be the best one celebrating the end was most stressful session. Again very grateful for this 30 days, just sharing my experience.",Nicole Mahshie,2021-02-01T03:54:53Z,1

I feel the same way. I don&#39;t do well without instruction since I won&#39;t push myself.  I followed along for a bit today but ended up just doing what I like and nothing too challenging.

@Nova Albrecht I feel like some people may have missed her saying this in the beginning. It wasn‚Äôt outright said but she left it for us to interpret how we do the day. I found myself following her as much as I could but even when my neck was turned or couldn‚Äôt see I instinctively knew what to do next or have learned how long to hold from the month of practice. <br /><br />I get the criticism but I think they lack a bit of context in knowing this was meant to be your own session rather than a session you follow.,Albert Garcia,2021-02-03T18:37:42Z,0

"I totally understand that! Normally I substitute for the mic-less practices or just skip, because the first time I did one it was pretty unpleasant.

Would it be at all possible to have Adrienne record the day 30 session with the microphone so we can use this complete practice after!I have really learned to follow her voice when doing her yoga practices and fins it mush easier to follow when she leads verbally as opposed to trying to follow ever move by looking at the screen to follow the practice. -would love to use several of the ‚Äúday 30‚Äù practices post her 30 day challenges ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôèüôèüòä,Karen Brett,2021-02-01T03:35:07Z,0

And I had no idea what to expect today. When Adriene basically told me to trust myself and find what feels good and then took off her mic, I honestly burst into tears. I sat on my mat and cried for a minute, feeling the absolute enormity of not having her voice in my ear guiding me and making me smile and reassuring me. It felt deeply vulnerable, asking me to trust myself for an hour and guide my own practice. So I cried. And then I sat and grounded in my breath. And then somehow I DID know what I needed. I moved through my practice with so much love for myself and for this space. I felt strong and graceful and more connected to my body and my movement and my breath than I have in a long time. This was simultaneously the greatest challenge and the sweetest gift. Thank you.",Sam Bergen,2021-02-01T03:21:16Z,0

"Congrats everyone! This is the first 30 day journey that I completed, though I&#39;ve started a few in the past. Last year I really started doing yoga, but I didn&#39;t really do it regularly till late November. Throughout then till end of December I only did yoga 5 days a week, constantly skipping days because I didn&#39;t feel like it. This month is the first I&#39;ve done every single day without missing a day :) Nothing wrong with missing a day, but any time I thought about skipping I kind of just said, screw it, and came to the mat. Though I didn&#39;t last the full 50 minutes today, I did do my own 30 minute routine and it felt amazing.

Words can&#39;t describe how magical and transformative this last practice was. I found so many tears of joy in trusting and acknowledging myself. Day 30 was my first time sobbing on the mat.

This entire month has helped me to strengthen my relationship with my breath again. Having as many panic/anxiety attacks that I do, the best thing I can keep doing is breathing. My mind needs to return to my breath. I feel more connected to it now than ever. That was the most zen practice I have had in a while. I teared up a little when the theme music played at the end. It&#39;s been a wild ride everyone, and I am so glad that I was able to practice with all of you. Knowing we are not alone in our practices makes them just a little bit more interesting.

Good Morning All. I echo your comments about the audio cues. However I believe Adrienne has placed her trust in us to ‚ÄúDo What Feels Good ‚Äú.

"Day 30...I can&#39;t believe it! This is the first time I&#39;ve actually been able to do all 30 days in a row without stopping. Day 30 is aways a little intimidating for me at first, but I&#39;ve found that once I get started, things start to flow, and it&#39;s really fun to decide what direction to go in! <br /><br />I also flashed right back to this time last year when the Home music played, and I remembered working my way through Dedicate this past spring and True in the summer when I heard those themes. Yoga has helped so much with the isolation over the course of the last year, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who feels that way.

Thank you for this beautiful practice Adriene (and team - that includes you Benji!)! I&#39;ve done 30 day journeys in the past and have always had a little trouble on day 30 when it came to the quiet practice. I typically would spend too much time looking up anticipating the next move. But today I took a BREATH and trusted my body and the practice and it was so invigorating. <br /><br />Thank you to all of you out there in the community - I truly enjoyed this practice with you and reading about all of your experiences and uplifting comments. Be well!,Galloping Girl,2021-02-01T02:25:07Z,0
"First off, we did it!! It wasn&#39;t perfect, but the learning curve is what makes this journey truly worth it. All of our struggles and triumphs are deserving of celebration, and love, and I applaud all of your strength. I teared up in anticipation of playing this video, scared to leave behind what has been such a big comfort through the past 30 days, but we&#39;re not really leaving, are we? There is always going to be the opportunity to return to your breath, to find what feels good to you. I&#39;m beyond grateful for this channel, this community, for all the lessons these videos have taught me.

"This is my first challenge with you and I wept when you said we would be doing it together rather than with you as the leader.

I heard you tell me it didn&#39;t need to be perfect, to trust the ground would be there, to breathe, to keep going and not give up. So many of these lessons are life lessons on and off the mat.

"Great job guys! My fam came in earlier than expected, about twenty minutes from the end and started talking over my silent practice including to me. I‚Äôd already cried once (my heart burst thinking of all of you knocking on heavens door at your own homes) and honestly the end felt like emotional blue balls not having the privacy to embrace the moment. People were literally asking me things mid practice and Jesus that was hard to deal with since it doesn‚Äôt normally happen (I don‚Äôt have kids or sweet fur babies so normally it‚Äôs a bit of peace).

While doing this last practice, so many of the words and mantras from days past kept coming back to me (TRUST the practice, TRUST yourself, move from CENTER, I am strong, everything is as it should be, FLOW, etc.), and I knew you were right there with me. Pranayama is one of my favorite parts of yoga and I knew I&#39;d love Breath as soon as it was announced.

A couple times I looked at my screen to see we were in the same poses! It was a magical feeling to use my breath as inspiration - it really made the time fly and kept me curious during this very long session. It really gives me hope for the days to come, hoping to incorporate daily yoga from now on.

I&#39;ve realized that&#39;s okay to feel vulnerable. that not everyday is gonna be a good one, but that&#39;s not the end of the world. that breath is always there for me. although there&#39;s still a lot to learn, today i feel more mature about my relationship with my mind and my body. and that&#39;s thanks to yoga, and to you as the amazing instructor and human you are. this feels like a sweet ending, but it&#39;s also the beginning of a new journey, and I&#39;m letting you know that I&#39;m taking you with me! I will be forever grateful.<br />sending you, and benji, and whoever&#39;s reading this, all my love. üíå",ana ferreira,2021-02-01T01:28:18Z,0

"And here I find myself at the end of an incredible journey... showing up for myself every day for 30 days without fail. While the physical changes i&#39;ve experience have been great, it&#39;s the mental aspects that have really changed my perspective. I&#39;ve been practicing with you since 2016 (albeit inconsistently) yet this month I noticed an incredible gain of flexibility and strength of MIND. Even without your guiding voice today, as I flowed alongside you, my own voice came to me. Only kind words, words of affirmation, &quot;I&#39;m doing great, keep going!&quot; &quot;I am strong&quot; &quot;I am love&quot;. Adriene I cannot begin to thank you for the amount of worth and love you&#39;ve instilled in me, or perhaps it was your guidance that awoke it and brought it out of me. For the entirety of today&#39;s practice I had a huge smile on my face, amazed by how incredible and beautiful my body is for being capable of doing this. You always thank us for sharing our time and practice with you, but today I was to say the biggest thank YOU for sharing YOUR time and practice with us. Thank you for always being here for me over the past 5 years. Whenever I need a place to relax or clear my head, I always find my way back here. I extend eternal love and gratitude for you, Adriene, and I can&#39;t wait to keep practicing alongside you for the rest of this year, and hopefully for the rest of my life... Namaste.",Viola Bolik,2021-02-01T01:27:16Z,0
"The Day 30 practices always scare me, and I end up watching Adriene the entire time so I know what to do, but this time I trusted myself, and oh my god.  That was an incredible practice.

I began doing your videos last March when the quarantine started, after years of resisting committing myself to yoga. I now do at least one of your videos everyday, often two. Today is my 38th birthday, and as I worked through the final day of Breath with you, I found myself getting quite emotional. I am just so proud of how far I have come during the past year. I have strength, flexibility, balance, and the ability to manage my stress in ways that I never knew I was capable of before you gave me these tools.

"I used to have a recurring voice injury, and I was stunned when the doctor told me I was ‚Äúbreathing wrong.‚Äù How could I be messing up something that‚Äôs instinctual? Apparently, I held my breath too often, or used up all my air before another inhalation (think: stuck in the Kumbhaka).<br /><br />I eventually became a speech-language pathologist, but not before I‚Äôd accumulated years‚Äô worth of compensatory habits (lifted shoulders, strained neck) and psychological trauma from being unable to control my voice and breath (croaking in unexpected moments, fear of singing). All of which I‚Äôm still unlearning even after 8 years after my last injury.<br /><br />Yoga with Adriene was the only thing that got me practicing regularly, after dabbling in yoga for years (even hated it back in college!) Last March was when I did my 1st 30-Day, Home, and have been on the mat consistently since. In the span of one year, I‚Äôve been healing my mind and nourishing my body with every inhale, and not forgetting to exhale!<br /><br />On the last day of Home, I froze and cried when Adriene said she‚Äôd go off mic; I felt sad that it was ending and panicked that I wasn‚Äôt ready to flow on my own. But I found my own pace, and my body found its own voice.<br /><br />At the start of today‚Äôs session, I found myself crying again, but this time from so much joy, and acknowledging how far I‚Äôve come, and thinking about so many people around the world with their own sets of struggles, but all journeying with me. How much more fitting when some of the music from past 30-day challenges accompanied my movement, like a soundtrack to my growth? No sadness now that ‚Äúit‚Äôs ending,‚Äù because so long as I have breath, I‚Äôve stopped deciding where it ends.<br /><br />THANK YOU, ADRIENE!

"Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I think this turned out to be my favorite day of this series.  Breath was difficult for me to land in despite (or, perhaps, because of) the fact that I spent 2020 grounding in yoga and using it as a tool to center myself.  I found myself mildly dreading this day, even though it has always been my favorite, especially once I found out how long it was.  But I arrived, I took a breath, and I allowed myself to land, finally, wholly.  I finally looked at some real fears I have been aware of but ignoring the last month.  I finally surrendered to my intuition.  This day healed me as it always does - always when I need it.  I am so excited to move into February after this beautiful journey.  I know I gained and grew so much in these last 30 days and will be discovering just how much for a while, I&#39;m sure.  I think I&#39;m going to spend the next seven days in a chakra series and then the rest of the month listening to what I need each day and finding a video (or meditation music) to fit it.<br /><br />Yoga has truly taken all the scattered parts of me and made me whole, connected.  Adriene, I have been returning to your videos for several years now, but recently made a commitment to yoga every day June 1, 2020.  Thank you for your support and this community.

I really wanted to love this last day practice as the 29 days were absolutely fantastic!  I will try Day 30 again but I think I need to watch it through first or just minimize the screen so I can&#39;t see Adriene at all.  I know I have the tools to practice on my own but I kept looking at the screen- I was more than a step behind every pose. I couldn&#39;t get myself to relax into this practice even with trying to focus on my breath and trying to go free style. I obviously have more work to do as I&#39;m not ready for a solo flight.

Feeling like I was part of everyone doing this together got me through some of the tougher practises but now I&#39;m not sure what to do tomorrow. <br /><br />I know I&#39;ll return to my mat ( with Adriene&#39;s voice whispering &quot;half the battle is showing up&quot;) but I&#39;m just a bit lost as to which direction to take.,TheSCJA,2021-02-01T00:02:18Z,0

"Thank you so much, Adriene, for this beautiful journey. This last practice was both inspiring and emotional. I feel so thankful for your work and your generosity.

"I found it really hard to keep looking at the screen to keep up with this practice but I did it! I am just SO proud of myself and of everyone here that we actually did a whole 30 days of yoga! It has been a test of my character and I really just wanted to prove to myself that I could commit to something for a whole month. Its hard to believe in yourself sometimes, but I did it! Hoping this belief in myself will transfer to the rest of my life :) Lots of love in, lots of love out. &lt;3",volubleperspicacious,2021-02-01T00:00:33Z,1

"This was my second 30-day yoga journey. Last year I was terrified when I realised that the last day is without Adriene&#39;s voice. But it all made sense, all the movements made sense. This year, I kept checking the video but at the same time this practice let me do the movements I&#39;ve enjoyed the most since I started practising. I could see my improvement, I could see my body taking a more playful attitude. Thank you, Adriene, and everybody for making this possible. Looking forward to next month&#39;s calendar!",maveva111,2021-01-31T23:58:08Z,0

"Knowing that I prefer guidance I switched and did 30 save 29 for the last  BREATH practice to end on a relaxed and satisfied tone. No guidance makes me a bit tense, less this time than last January.

"Wooow combined day 29 and 30. Was an interesting one. Held some moments for longer then I&#39;m used too and found the effort with the ease, the grounding with the grace. Loved my twists and did some dancers pose into tree, and my tree swayed and I&#39;m not ashamed to say it haha. Awww Adriene and Benji Benji and all other yogis who have done this Breath series I hope you found your strength and your sense of self and will be mentioning this in a project I have coming up so shout out to Adriene and Benji Benji on March 6th üòâüòÅ I know that no matter what my breath will be there. And in reflection to the current situation I hope that the souls who pass on everyday due to C-19 thier last breath is a peaceful and calm one. We continue to breath for you. Happy day 30 YWA yogis.

"Wow, that was the most beautiful experience. I did Home last month, and day 30 was such a breakthrough for me, I cried the entire time. But I copied your movements, I followed the video pretty much the whole time. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I got so much from that experience last month, and that was exactly what was right for me in that moment. But today, the music moved within me, today I followed my own heart&#39;s song. It&#39;s like the yoga movements that were right for me just appeared in front of me. It was as if I was performing a dance. Every once in a while I would get a pang of anxiety or a thought would pop up like, &quot;Wait, how long have I been doing this?&quot;, &quot;Should I catch up to Adriene?&quot;, &quot;What if I forget what I did on this side when I get to the other leg?&quot;, but I just moved through them. I continued to follow my heart. A few times I would notice you were at a similar place or pace as me and I&#39;d decide to join you for a nice knocking on heaven&#39;s door, and then I slipped back into my own flow. And I expected to be sobbing through this one like I did the last. I cried in the beginning when you were speaking about new beginnings, but once I got started, all I could do was smile and laugh. I was flying. As someone who struggles with PTSD, who has been long trudging through grief, I never expected this. And I couldn&#39;t be more filled with hope. I couldn&#39;t be more grateful to you, Adriene. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Daily yoga is undoubtedly something I&#39;m going to continue for the rest of my life. I can&#39;t believe I went so long without it. Namaste and Abundant Love to All. üíìü¶ã‚ú®",Kat Abrams,2021-01-31T23:48:18Z,11

"This was such an unexpected gift. Looking back, I feel each session prepared me for this one. While Adriene has been an incredible guide over these last 30-days, I felt like this session Adriene was asking us to guide the practice. I tried to toss off the fears of staying completely in sync with Adriene, and instead, stay in sync with myself and what my body was telling me. I can&#39;t say enough about the music! It was so beautifully on point. I felt powerful and strong moving through the poses and staying connected to my breath. After finishing, my partner asked me how it was and I said, &quot;It was an experience.&quot; Thanks, Adriene! Great work everyone!",Vinnie Casanova,2021-01-31T23:47:23Z,1
"Wow, what an incredible journey this has been!  I followed some of the poses for about 30 minutes and then just took a break and watched the incredible Adriene.  I made it my own and completed the practice my way!  Thank you for your encouragement, grace and  love.  I‚Äôve followed you for a long time but this is the first time I completed a 30 day.  Namaste and I‚Äôll be on the mat tomorrow.",Ann Lumm,2021-01-31T23:47:15Z,0

"This was my first 30 day journey so i was genuinely shocked when you said we were on our own for this one üò≥but it turned out to be such a pleasant surprise and such a needed one. I feel like I&#39;ve gained so much in this 30 days and I don&#39;t think I went a day without wondering how something that was so good for me could feel so good in the process. This journey really helped ground me every day and gave me a chance to self-reflect and sit with my emotions which is so very important for me. The practice today was awkward at times, and I missed your voice, and I spent moments wondering if I should be idling in a pose so long, (until i remembered the flow of my breath) but it was beautiful all the same.  I only did 35 minutes of the practice today and I wasn&#39;t upset with myself about it, I just did what felt right which is such a euphoric feeling! Thank you for your wisdom and your patience and all of the work you put into these videos.

"Amazing, so amazing.  I&#39;ve been doing the 30 day challenge for the past few years and this is my third year doing it with the 30 days straight in a row.  What I&#39;m so shocked by is how slow I took it for myself.  I sat and breathed at the beginning and meditated on my own when that&#39;s normally so hard for me.  I did warriors and held them and held my focus and thought of my breath on my own.  I even did knocking on heaven&#39;s door!!  I always hate that one but today it felt right.  Thank you Adriene for putting this together and believing in us to do the last day on our own.",readingshell,2021-01-31T23:44:47Z,0

"I&#39;ve never made it to day 30 of a YWA journey, and I&#39;ve never done a freestyle flow before. I was considering skipping, doing a different video, or watching Adriene the whole time. But I decided to follow my own path and I&#39;m so happy. Before doing a wide legged forward fold, I caught Adriene looking at the camera and smiling and thought, &quot;I&#39;m doing great Adriene, don&#39;t worry about me.&quot; I teared up when the outro music played and Adriene bowed. These classes have been so transformative physically, mentally, and spiritually. Thank you for this journey Adriene.",Jennifer Dennin,2021-01-31T23:44:29Z,0
"Thank you so much Adrienne, you are an angel. I am in tears and I cried the whole practice today. When you said you were gonna take your mic off today I felt such a pang of panic in my heart as I knew this was the end and you were letting us go, on our own. It felt scary, and sacred. It felt generous, and empowering, and I started panicking in my head because I thought &quot;how am I gonna do this without her&quot;? This is how I have come to rely on your voice, your guidance, your kindness, your empathy, your presence in the past 30 days. You have brought true light and love into my life and you have showed me how it&#39;s already inside of me, and today was the day where you revealed to me that big secret, that I had it inside all along, and I could do this without you. Today, I could see my own strength so clearly, maybe for the first time. I know these are big words and they might sound crazy, but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m not the only one who feels this way. I&#39;m practicing yoga since a few years, and I have never really experienced an opening of the heart like I did today. I&#39;m feeling very emotional right now. With everything happening in the world, in my life, in others life, all the misery, the sadness there is right now, the desperation, the fear... I am just so grateful I got to experience these 30 days with you and the other thousands of people around the world. What a precious gift. I am so humbled by the generosity, the purity of your heart. I feel so full of hope, of gratitude, and love. I feel that I&#39;ve got this. I feel that we&#39;ve got this. We will get through.

"Slightly dreaded being cast adrift again on day 30, I knew this was coming. I managed better than before, but I really depend on Adriene‚Äôs voice to tell me to breathe as much as anything! I don‚Äôt usually look at my iPad mini in practice as I can‚Äôt really see it without glasses, which ain‚Äôt happening in a practice. I suggest two versions for future day 30, one with guidance, one without. This would be so inclusive for many people too. That aside, I loved Breath, my first time following a current Adriene project, and felt really involved. Top quality and yummy. Oh adding greetings to all from West London üôè",Paula Pardoe,2021-01-31T23:39:26Z,30
"Here&#39;s how I do day 30: I start sitting like she does and I shut eyes a breathe for a bit. Then I think about my current favorite pose and start working up to that- usually it&#39;s tree pose- so a few sun salutations to warm up and then I work on my balance and voila! Tree pose time. Then I&#39;ll glance at Adrienne and see what she&#39;s up to. Warrior 2? Cool. I&#39;ll work up to that- down dog, high lunge, warrior one, warrior two- oh I like standing wide legged forward fold, Ill do that for a bit! I just mess around like that.

"January was a tough month, but having this time set aside for myself every day helped me conquer it! I have attempted yoga without any verbal guidance before, but only for short periods of time. This was a challenge for me because I wanted to follow along perfectly, but once I realized that as long as I did what felt good it was very freeing!

"Adriene, I have no words to describe all the gratitude I feel for you, for this journey and this community. I shed a little tear at the end of the video when I starting looking back at my screen and saw you bowing (a little voice in my head were like noooooo no outro, don&#39;t go Adriene!). It&#39;s the third year in a row I&#39;m following this journey and it&#39;s been healing and transformative each time. I could write tons of words and still not be able to really describe the preciousness of all this so I&#39;m going to say just that: thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I had no idea how much vocabulary I had really retained until today. I was nervous going into this but then a gentle voice whispered things like &#39;half way lift, your version&#39; and &#39;let your breath guide the movement&#39;.

"Wow this was such an emotional practice. About 5 months ago I googled free yoga  and found a site that I tried but only 1 session was free and the rest were locked. Their payed videos were expensive. I was so  annoyed I  gave up . Then about 3 months ago I googled again  and found you. I did a few days of your yoga for beginners video and then started 30 days of yoga .I went all the way through and then started your 30 days of home. I finished that and then saw the Breath series . I never missed a day. Today I missed your sweet voice but knew you were there with me and you had my back. Writing this is making me tear up. You are an angel, and I am so grateful to you for sharing all these video&#39;s with us  the time you have put in to this is  amazing . I am 64 and I wish I had found you years ago. You have given me  so many gifts and tools and I am so grateful. I will begin the February calendar tomorrow because I&#39;m sticking with you for the rest of my life.

"Thank you Adriene, just thank you &lt;3 I guided myself through the 50 minutes and at the end of my savasana I decided to roll on to my right side, although I normally prefer to roll up. When I started to push myself up to a seat I opened my eyes a little bit and saw you in the exact same position. What a strange connection, and it filled me with gratitude and a sense of really practicing with you and all the other people on this journey. I&#39;ve been doing yoga with you since I started my practice six years. It is my first comment, but I want to share what a difference your way of teaching yoga has made in my life and helped me find the one thing I can always return to, whether in times of joy or times of sadness &lt;3",MOYA,2021-01-31T23:19:04Z,1

"I&#39;ll be honest. The last 30 days were hard for me. Most days, I didn&#39;t even want to get on my mat. My body isn&#39;t as strong as it used to be and poses that used to be simple were so challenging. I had difficulty finding stillness and there were so many days where I almost gave up. But I was determined to stick with it to the end (I haven&#39;t made it through one of these challenges since 2017). I had to make modifications and take breaks during some of the videos, but I made it. Every day, I got one step closer. I&#39;m proud of myself. I didn&#39;t meet what I thought my &quot;expectations&quot; should be, but I showed up and I did the work. My body might not be as strong as it once was- but it got me through the last 30 days. And I&#39;m proud of it.<br /><br />I loved reading through y&#39;all&#39;s comments after each practice- this is truly a beautiful community. We did it! <br /><br />Thank you as always, Adriene for putting so much work and your heart and soul into each one of these videos. You are truly changing lives.

In many ways these past 30 days have been exactly that, a dying of doubt and excuses and a new born sense of strength, resilience and commitment to self. I am thankful and most grateful beyond adequate expression to Adriene for the daily invitation and support that encouraged me to keep showing up and saying yes to such a glorious journey.

"I love you and this whole 30 day journey, but I was very disappointed in this last video. :( I felt unprepared for the hands off approach.

I glanced over from time to time and either saw that you were doing something I had done earlier, or something I hadn‚Äôt done yet and hadn‚Äôt yet thought to do, so it definitely helped me get all the way through this long practice, but I was so heartened to see that I could do it on my own, without specific instruction the whole time. This was a great 30 days, and I plan on continuing after, taking some time, even if just a few minutes, each morning to feel my breath and my body.

But I pressed play and the idea of freestyle was fun, I ended up doing quite a few different things, learnt from all the previous classes, with all her little tips in my mind at each pose. I didn&#39;t think I would be able to do this, make all the moves flow, but then I realised that it has come to the end of the video and there&#39;s still a bunch of things I want to do, which I didn&#39;t realise I would want to.

That is such a treasure that I take away from this month. Stronger yes, but more able to connect to the breath, that I truly believe was breathed into us by our loving God.

Thank you so much for this journey Adriene! Throughout the process and doing videos with you for the last three years I have at least once a practice found myself saying ‚ÄúAdriene coming in clutch!‚Äù aloud as you guided us through a movement that seemed so perfectly suited to what my body or spirit needed on that day. Exploring this every day this month with you helped me realize that - while I am sure you are a little psychic ;) - it wasn‚Äôt always that you magically knew what I needed but that my body and spirit was doing the work to find something that was already in the practice and suit it to myself! I have been trying to give myself more credit through this process and to take the leap of faith and practice with no guidance today was a perfect way to round off this journey!

"Voiceover practices are my favorites normally, and I always look forward to these freestyle practices. But as soon as I started this practice, I felt a little nervous and sad that I wouldn&#39;t be hearing your cues, Adriene. Not because I felt that I couldn&#39;t follow on my own or move in my own way, but because I was afraid of getting &quot;out of step&quot; with you. This has been such a time of disconnect for everyone, and this series (and this channel, and your work in general) has created a place of unity and safety. As weird as it sounds, I felt like not hearing your voice would make me lose track of my pace, and that we wouldn&#39;t be practicing &quot;together.&quot; But as you said, we have the tools to cultivate our own practice and to move in our own breath, and the intuition to feel what&#39;s coming next in the flow. It didn&#39;t take me long to appreciate the silence, the beautiful music, and the opportunity to be led by you (and my breath) in a nonverbal way.<br />Many, many thanks to you and the rest of the YWA team for creating something that has helped millions of people across the globe. This channel has been such a positive place for me and something that has helped me appreciate my life and my body when times are good and when times are bad.

"This is only my second year of completing this 30 Day Yoga Journey but the first where I have managed to show up for myself every single day. Some days I was able to reach the mat with bundles of energy and enthusiasm whilst on other days I nearly didn&#39;t make it. But I did. We all did. In different ways and constricted by different schedules and time-scales but we did it.<br />It&#39;s nice to be able to compare how I felt this year vs the last. Last year I missed many days and, honestly, ended up completing the last section of &quot;Home&quot; as if it were an afterthought (not to say it wasn&#39;t still an amazing experience).<br />The main difference I&#39;ve noted with this practice is that my awareness of emotion has improved dramatically and I am (slowly!) learning to trust my intuition, which, as a constant self-doubter and walking ball of anxiety, is huge for me! This practice felt sooo different from the others, I can remember last year struggling to work without Adriene&#39;s cues and becoming frustrated with myself if I fell behind. But this session was entirely different. Quite a few times when I took a glance at my screen I was shocked to find Adriene in the same position I thought I had (randomly) moved in to! I&#39;ve never felt a connection like that before. When I felt uncertainty and panic rise up if the screen was vastly ahead of me, I was able to slow myself down and just breathe.<br />I don&#39;t think yoga is quite an everyday thing for me (yet) but I want to commit to showing up for myself more. My favourite mantra from this is 100%, &quot;everything is as it should be.&quot; I never thought such a simple phrase could be so comforting. <br />Thanks for sharing the tears, laughter and sing-a-longs! <br />Namaste &lt;3",theeIzbeee,2021-01-31T22:38:03Z,0

Unfortunately, I feel like I was unable to fully relax and enjoy it because I had such anticipatory stress. I love the no mic practice, but wonder if you would consider doing a voice over with simple commands.

"I wish that there were a narrated version, as not everyone can see what you are doing but would still like to follow along. Maybe there could be 2 versions with one being a narrated video. I really like your videos because you frequently mention that not all bodies are the same and not everyone has the same abilities. That is the reason why after hating most yoga I am getting into it. Your classes are awesome and very aware to individual needs. So it would be so great to see there be an accessibility option for the vision impaired and anyone else who finds your voice the reason they keep going.",Jazmine Peck,2021-01-31T22:35:06Z,15
"I also really enjoyed the flow of this practice and even the length (for some days). Hearing all the cues in my head and discovering how much I&#39;ve learned was wonderful. But I also found it difficult to look up to the laptop from downward dog to see what was coming next. Would love even minimal narration on this -- even just &quot;step right foot back / come to the front of your mat&quot;. In previous years I practiced only with the telephone, and then found these silent practices totally impossible to follow along with.

"I can&#39;t believe it! I actually did it! Thank you so much, Adriene! At the beginning of this journey, I didn&#39;t think I could do it. I have to admit, that I skipped day four, because I had a very bad mental health day, but I did the program the next day and after that didn&#39;t skip a single practice. Evan if I felt bad on some days, I managed to not give up. I can&#39;t express how much it means to me that I did this and how thankful I am. Thank you so much, Adriene, for being such a amazing, motivating and uplifting person and thank you to everyone else, who was part of this beautiful journey. From the bottom of my heart: Thank you, I love you. Lots of love from Germany",L.,2021-01-31T22:24:58Z,0

"I can just feel gratitude for you Adriene and for this beautiful community where i feel that i belong... This is a practice I&#39;ll return to, everything you said in the beggining is a daily reminder, thank you! I first started doing yoga here in the beginning of quarentine, i did your first 30 days journey and it completely changed everything in myself, i needed that so much in that time... And recently I&#39;ve been through a tough experience where i got completely broken and your BREATH journey helped me to pick all the pieces together in myself by simply breathing in and breathing out (even though it could be so hard sometimes), it helped me in my healing process, it made the healing real. It&#39;s just too much feelings to put into words and i think it can look confusing... Basically all I&#39;m trying to say is THANK YOU Adriene and friends that did it with me WE DID IT and yeah it&#39;s the best way to restart, the best way to BEGIN 2021!

"What a journey it&#39;s been. I&#39;ve done one other 30 day series, HOME, and when I reached the final day of no instructions, I was so bewildered. Haha! I had so much resistance and felt the need to &quot;follow,&quot; and &quot;get it right.&quot; After moving through 30 days of breath, I finally realized what it feels like to follow your own breath. To listen to your own inner voice. To march to the beat of your own drum. Thank you, Adriene. I get it now. <br /><br />I also began the practice thinking, &quot;Jeeze, 50 minutes? That&#39;s a long time to keep going on my own.&quot; I got to the end and couldn&#39;t believe it when I heard the theme music going out. I WANTED TO KEEP GOING! <br /><br />I finished on my own - in absolute silence, except for, of course, my own breath. (Sorry this is a novel, but I&#39;m flooded with feelings and thoughts and who better to share them with than this awesome, supportive community!) I watched the flurries falling outside and heard my dog sigh. I felt my heart beat. I smelled the candles I had lit. I felt the sweat on the back of my neck.

I can&#39;t do this without prompts. I get that this is &quot;the tradition&quot; and all but I just got frustrated. It was a disappointing end to the 30 days I invested in. I&#39;m not giving up.

For the first half I found I was unintentionally syncing up with Adriene - I went in saying, I&#39;ll do what feels right for me and not try to follow her without her voice to guide, but it like she was one step ahead of me every time I looked up. Half-way through though I felt my legs and hips and lower back wanted more love - so I parted ways with Adriene and used the &#39;vocabulary&#39; she&#39;s taught me! Every now and then I&#39;d look up and see something Adriene was doing and think ooh, yes yummy I might do that in a moment. I&#39;m just so proud of being able to come to the mat in that new, mindful mindset able to guide myself. Thank you Adriene x",Nicola Todhunter,2021-01-31T21:29:55Z,0
"I‚Äôm over the moon to have completed and been a part of this 30 day yoga journey with all you special people. Day 30 allowed me to put into practice everything I‚Äôve learnt over these heartwarming days. At first, I was a little unsure and kept looking up at Adriene for reassurance but within 15 minutes I came into this tranquil flow with the music and I was in sync. I‚Äôm so proud of myself for being able to complete every move, like the balancing pose and crow pose (even if it was for a micro second, ha) Slowly lowering from plank has gone from torture to like hovering my body weight and with control lowering myself down, -now a pleasure) Throughout the entire practice I kept getting snippets of Adriene‚Äôs teachings coming to me, and words of advice. ‚ÄòCome on, you got this.‚Äô ‚ÄòWhisper to yourself, I am strong.‚Äô ‚ÄòGather strength from your core.‚Äô ‚ÄòLower down with control.‚Äô ‚ÄòTap into that inner smile‚Äô haha I could go on and on. I even smiled at the same time as Adriene when we did the smacking the but move üòÅ Adriene, from my heart to yours, thank you üôèüèº You are the best yoga teacher and teacher in general, I‚Äôve ever had xxxx ‚ù§Ô∏è",Wonder Woman,2021-01-31T21:29:21Z,1

"I love your practices and I loved the whole series up to yesterday so I was disappointed to realize (and remember from last year) that the capstone is a silent practice. I understand the WHY but I am severely myopic and prefer to take my glasses off and do yoga mostly with my eyes closed, listening for cues. It helps me sink deeper into the practice, so needing to wear my glasses AND look frequently at the screen was really frustrating.<br /><br />I&#39;m so grateful for what you did here but I did want to share this feedback as I know I&#39;m not alone in feeling frustrated with the silent practice (I have been sharing regularly about the 30-day on Instagram and have heard the same from others).",Christine Koh,2021-01-31T21:24:00Z,0

To be completely honest, in the previous years I haven&#39;t been able to complete 30 days. I don&#39;t know why. Now I think I just wasn&#39;t ready. But this year I woke up at 6:30 am (Poland) with joy and anticipation to start my day with You, yoga and Benji üòä And today for the first time I complete the 30 days so for me, it&#39;s some milestone, and I am proud of myself. I have my limitations. For the whole of my life I had problems with Achilles. My muscles aren&#39;t strong enough (yet) to do everything. But I tried and do my best.

The last 30 days this has given me something to focus on, some routine to each evening and got me moving. It&#39;s given me time for me, to relax, to forget, to unwind, to breathe! I haven&#39;t enjoyed every session, but I stopped clock watching after day three and have always come away feeling calmer and more &#39;at peace&#39;.

"I made it through the whole journey minus two days (one due to illness and the other due to the inauguration). I overall loved this Breath practice and felt it was so holistic and helped me strengthen inside and out. I must be honest; however, that I realized through this last session, that I like instruction. I found myself not breathing well and struggling with either following Andrienne (and straining my neck)...or getting flustered with what to do next.  I may be the only one who felt this way, but I was hoping for more feelings of unity and closure which was hard to accomplish when I felt I was kinda &quot;on my own&quot;.  I would suggest maybe having a silent option, along with a guided one when completing a journey.  Or maybe, it was just too long for me. I probably could have felt more confident if I was guiding myself through 20 or so minutes.  But again...this does not undermine that great experience I had overall. I printed my bridge calendar and intend to continue. I appreciate Adrienne so much.  I&#39;m just not confident enough to flow through 55 minutes with no instruction (yet).  Thanks for this wonderful experience.",Adina Middleman,2021-01-31T21:16:05Z,0

I really enjoyed the 30 days! Do wish there was a voice over for this last day. Found myself not posing well because I had to keep looking to keep up. I look forward to keeping up a daily practice.,Hillcrest Wanderer,2021-01-31T21:05:02Z,23
"I did too but it sounds like we both had awareness of our posing needing adjustments. I kept remembering little things she would say during the other practices like &quot;head over heart, hear over pelvis&quot; haha",Heather Kangas,2021-02-01T03:13:16Z,1
"I think that the point of day 30 is that you can release yourself from having to follow her, and follow your own intuition to do the moves that feel good. It&#39;s ok if you don&#39;t do the same moves she does, but if you get lost and can&#39;t think of what to do next, you can look up for ideas of what she&#39;s doing.",Bailey Ricketts,2021-02-01T01:37:56Z,15

"I wasn&#39;t going to do this. I was so tired and feeling discouraged. The thought of an hour without any vocal instructions seemed impossible. But I got on the mat, started the video and had one of the most amazing yoga experiences I&#39;ve ever had. I didn&#39;t need another voice to guide me because my breath took over and my body knew exactly what to do. I actually did learn so much more than I realized over this 30 days.

"Practicing with you for two years has been such an honor and privilege .  You and yoga can keep us sane as the world can‚Äôt decide what or how to be.  I, personally think that kindness, honor, respect is a good starting place.  Mankind doesn‚Äôt have to be so complicated .  We just need to be. I‚Äôve had two bdays since meeting you on the mat so at 69 , I feel that I can get myself in poses with much more ease. Plus, this breathing video cinched it all together.  Still working on balance.  Some days are great, other days I fall. And it‚Äôs ok. I love you Ms. Adriene and I will always do yoga with you.  I‚Äôve also become quite the yoga advocate as well.

But being on the mat for the past 30 days, I&#39;ve learned bit by bit to accept the way things are, love who I am right now, and to trust myself and the path I have created for myself.

"It was late at my end, and still I wanted to honour my commitment to this journey by showing up to the mat before bedtime. I had no idea that the class was as long as it was. I had no idea what a treat I was in for either - on so many levels. The beauty of a silent class is, that the teacher gets to dive deeper into their own practice. How precious it is, then, to witness what is possible, and find a potential to grow towards. <br /><br />Thank you for a fundamentally wellness- and health-boosting journey, Adriene - and grandmaster of ceremony, Benji!

"Laying in my chosen ending pose of reclined cobbler, I feel so proud that I committed to the 30 Days for once. I will admit I panicked when you said you were taking off your mic, I was like UM PLEASE SAY SIKE. But! I discovered the beauty of listening to my body and finding out what I really needed, finding what feels good. Just to also share my POV a bit, I&#39;m a Christian, and the meaning of beginning with the breath really resonates with me because I believe the breath is the Holy Spirit. I don&#39;t believe in mere coincidences. Thank you for this journey, especially during this difficult time ‚ô°",Kathy Lopez,2021-01-31T20:40:11Z,0

"There&#39;s something very special about hearing all the soundtracks from the previous 30-day journeys, especially that Revolution one... Revolution gets me every time. I started to tear up a little during knocking on heaven&#39;s door, of all things (it&#39;s such a joyful movement!), but at the closing, the tears came fast and furious. Very emotional in the most beautiful way. Having the sun stream through my window and feeling a cool breeze touch my shoulders in savasana, I felt overcome by how precious life is, and how especially important Breath felt after such a wild and difficult year.

"I didn&#39;t expect to get so emotional today... It is very hard to put into words how much these beautiful daily practices have meant to me, but I&#39;ll try. <br />I&#39;ve always thought of yoga as something very slow, and full of difficult poses. I was astonished with how wrong I was when I started this 30 day journey. What really anchored me to the practice was Adriene&#39;s beautiful, graceful, and mindful presence and soul, and how kindly, and friendly she spoke. I wasn&#39;t sure before I started if I would finish the 30 days, but after I finished day 1, I was sure. I was prepared. I was committed. I was determined. And so, I did every daily practice, and every practice familiarized me even more with yoga, the breath, mindfulness, body-mind-soul connection, and staying mindful and present not only while I was on the mat, but outside of it too. Suddenly, the mat was my safe haven. I felt safe and protected while on my mat, like nothing could touch me, nothing could hurt me. I practiced and practiced every day, and after a few days, it occured to me that yoga had become a habit, and an escape from this crazy reality. I couldn&#39;t even imagine that I wouldn&#39;t show up on the mat every day. And it became non-negotiable. I felt at-peace, powerful, and fragile, calm, and content, and immensely proud for sticking with my practice. <br />When the practice began, I had tears in my eyes, and when it ended as well. I hadn&#39;t realized how connected I felt to Adriene, Benji, and to this beautiful community practicing everyday. So, I very much look forward to seeing you all on the mat tomorrow, and I want to say THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart to you, Adriene, and to Benji ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è THANK YOU SO, SO MUCH ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I will miss seeing a new video every day, but I&#39;m really grateful for the February calendar, which I&#39;ll surely follow!!",ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒ∑œÇ Œß.,2021-01-31T20:36:15Z,2
"I have followed the 30 days and am thankful to have had them.  I looked forward to each practice and am sad that it is over.  For one week my granddaughter was with me every day and nothing like moving from child&#39;s pose to downward facing dog through plank with a 30 pound baby on your back.  SLOWLY!   I&#39;ve been doing yoga now for 10+ years and found new things and challenging moves in this series.  I could do an hour without a guide but would prefer your voice on Day 30 - felt like I had to keep turning my head to see what you were doing.  Other than that, ALL GOOD.

"This was probably my favorite workout ever, with Adriene, who helped me  created it myself.  I&#39;ve done every single series, which have helped build strength in a permanently injured knee (dance/cycling), and when I could finally do yoga squats (toes out), that was a miracle.  But at each of the other 30th (or 31st) days, perhaps I didn&#39;t have enough &quot;vocabulary&quot;, as you say, and though I could create a workout, was not very satisfied with it.  This time, I worked faster, included a couple of binds not seen in the Adriene videos, and worked from top to bottom -- crown to ground.   It was great!  I was hungry and physically tired when I finished!  I think the faster pace made a difference, for me.  I cannot do planks because of 2 different car accidents that did a number on my shoulders, so substitute cat/cow or anything I can think of to build tricep strength.

I only have one minor suggestion.  For Breath daily email, the email title format in the past years was easier to find what day it is.  For example:  &quot;Breath - Day 1 - Invite&quot;.

I&#39;ve been doing yoga for about the past 4-5 years now and done these 30 day yoga challenges on/off but this is my first time really truly feeling the fruits of my practice and consistency I&#39;ve been putting into my health. I plan to incorporate yoga into my morning workouts as a cool down. I remember the first time I saw one of your videos was a time I was in such a bad anxious stage of my life. You really introduced me to yoga and really how it&#39;s the ultimate act of self-love. I&#39;ll forever be grateful to you for that!! 2020 been such a crazy, rollercoaster of a year and I feel like coming back to practice yoga has been the best choice for my mental and physical health.

I lost 50 pounds last year and now that my BMI is just under 25 again I wanted to start being active again as I approach 49 years old.  My mom does yoga and I decided to try yours.  I am so happy I did.  I really love the combo of breathing, stretching and strength yoga gives in all in one pose many times.  Your videos were very helpful and you are great at taking it step by step.  I hope I am able to keep this going but funny enough the other day I started doing some yoga routines for 5 minutes on my own.  And I was enjoying it.  I will continue to explore and embrace the new me.  I am a 6&#39;2 male from Chicago.",Ram4,2021-01-31T19:45:33Z,0

I think one of my favorite parts was when I felt like knocking on heaven&#39;s door (one of my favorite things to do is say &quot;heeeey girl!&quot; to my own behind, haha! and not a second later, Adrienne followed suit and I did a little dance as if to welcome her into the flow!

I am feeling accomplished and proud.<br />Today, when I saw the video is 50 minutes long and it is not guided, I really didn&#39;t think I could finish it all by myself. However, time flew by and at the end, I found myself in corpse pose, silently crying and forgiving myself for everything I&#39;ve been blaming myself for.. This is so emotional and so precious to me. Thanks a million to every nice soul who has been on the mat with me. I am beyond grateful for your kindest intentions and good energy that you brought to our sacred connection.

"How is it that the day I was dreading the most turned out to be the most renewing, blissful and life-altering? I guess that‚Äôs the magic of yoga in general, and Adriene specifically. I will never stop practicing yoga after how much the discipline of thirty days straight has changed me. The peace and contentment I now feel throughout my days is worth every drop of sweat and falling on my face almost daily. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÇü•∞",Erin Johnson,2021-01-31T19:41:18Z,0
"I was so nervous that there wouldn&#39;t be any verbal cues. I think sometimes I trust Adriene more than I trust myself, so if she believed we could do it, I thought I would at least try. And by the end I realised I do utterly trust myself... I guess I just didn&#39;t know it. Sometimes I looked up and I was definitely not where Adriene was, and sometimes I was almost completely in sync. When I closed my eyes, I heard her voice telling me to breathe, to pause, to slow down- she was still guiding me. I loved this practice so much. I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be emotional but when Adriene bowed at the very end, I cried. I really needed to learn to trust myself, on the mat and off the mat. Thank you Adriene! Thank you Benji!

"this is my 3rd or 4th 30 Days of YWA, and I think this was my favourite series &lt;3 and this is always my favourite practice. during the year, when I&#39;m not following a calendar faithfully, I sometimes think that I am not capable of doing a self-guided practice because I&#39;m not good enough at it, or I can&#39;t remember the poses I know, etc etc. this tradition at the end of every 30 Days always reminds me that I am super capable, and nothing encourages me like catching Adriene&#39;s eye peeking at the camera every so often, or Benji moving in and out of frame. <br />thank you for always doing this for us Adriene, and for the gifts you give us all year long. I feel blessed to have found your channel those many years ago, and I will keep returning. namaste beautiful, kiss Benj for me.",Nikki Goerz,2021-01-31T19:16:19Z,0
"Adriene, I can&#39;t thank you enough. Little did I know how much I needed yoga before I started. It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever successfully showed up every day to any 30-day challenge. I practiced in the evening, and each day I looked forward to the peaceful (and challenging!) times on the mat. You&#39;ve helped me believe in myself and what my body is capable of doing, using the power of something that was in me all along - my breath. I feel amazing and I can&#39;t wait to continue this beautifully healing practice. Today is truly a new beginning. &lt;3",raychull88,2021-01-31T19:16:10Z,0

We can be so, so proud üòä it was a pleasure to be in the journey with all of you. Today, all of a sudden, I had this huge smile on my face because I was just embracing it all and it was literally perfect. I teared up a bit of the thought that we think all the time that something in us is wrong and needs to be fixed where in the end, we are all literally perfect from head to toe. It was my utmost pleasure to be together with all of you these 30 days. Have a very good, healthy and happy life on, you all üòä Namast√© ‚ù§",MrsFrappucchino,2021-01-31T19:15:25Z,0

"I&#39;m in tears writing this. I saw a 50min video and got so excited for the last but-kicking LONG flowing session! I heard her say &quot;I turn my mic off&quot; and I pressed pause and didn&#39;t even watch anymore of the video. I absolutely hate looking at the screen as it pulls us all away from our practice to have to kink our necks and look at the screen. I just use Adriene&#39;s voice 99% of the time. This did not end the 30 days as I would have liked, getting that push from Adriene to take with us into the next days. I hope she will consider some light guiding in the future. I have let this go, like she says, but its always hard to end  so positive when your momentum comes crashing to a halt at the last dayüòî",Claudia Evans,2021-02-01T01:25:46Z,5
"I would have loved this final practice so much more if Adriene had given limited guidance.

But somehow, I did the first about 20 minutes all on my own, without glancing at the screen much (except admiring your graceful moves from time to time), and moved as my body told me to. Then, I took some inspiration from your positions and flows and made it my own. This gave me new confidence in my body and showed me what you meant by trusting ourselves... Thank you, Adriene!

"It is so incredible what your work does! I was a total mess at day one, physically and mentally, since July I was stuck in an almost permanent anxiety status, but since the first day of the 30 days practice progressed I felt such a relive in my mind and body for the first time in my life! It is the first time I feel in charge of my own body, my own life and my own mind! The anxiety is not totally gone, but so much more manageable then before! I can‚Äôt thank you Adrienne enough for this beautiful gift you share with us all! You are really an angel! And it was so interesting for me that all the postures today I could do almost effortlessly, which I could not always do in the last 29 days. It is impressive what you can accomplish in just 30 days! I definitely want to continue practicing every day! I see you on the mat Adrienne tomorrow with heartfelt greetings from the bottom of my heart from little Vienna!",NoraErdbeer,2021-01-31T18:59:17Z,1

When I first started this 30 day journey I could not bend my right leg all the way when I tried to do child&#39;s pose.

"I&#39;m not crying, you&#39;re crying! But seriously, thank you so much Adriene (and Benji!). This is the second year I followed through all 30 days and I am so grateful. No matter how many weeks throughout the year I sometimes go without stepping on the mat, for 5 years now your 30 day yoga journeys have made me come back to it (although the first couple of years I didn&#39;t do it in 30 days). Also, it is amazing how this journey always shifts my mindset. One time during this wonderful last session I came out of a twist and saw Adriene flying in crow pose and instead of talking negatively about myself in my head because I can&#39;t do crow at the moment, I instantly felt so proud and happy for Adriene that she can do it so nicely. This is what yoga and this community does! Much love &lt;3",Annika Namyslo,2021-01-31T18:52:37Z,0

I thought I would complete this practice bright and early today but circumstances didn&#39;t allow. I&#39;m glad it didn&#39;t work out because I got to practice with the breeze at my balcony today and when practice was ending and I saw Adriene smile I cried a bit coz I was so overwhelmed and sad this is over. Even though I intend to keep going this journey was so incredible and it felt so good to be connected to other people in this way. I feel blessed and grateful. I came back now a couple of hours later just to watch Adriene again and to express my gratitude for these past 30 days. Namaste,Senthuri Pillai,2021-01-31T18:51:15Z,0

I created a whole 50 minute practice all by myself. I can&#39;t believe how much I have learnt over the past 30 days. Thank you, Adriene  ‚ô•Ô∏è",Billie Hart,2021-01-31T18:37:54Z,0
"I learned way more than I thought I‚Äôd learn from this practice. Not only in terms of exercises, yoga positions but also in terms of identity, myself.

"I did it!!! I am feeling calmer, happier and stronger. I believe in myself and I know I can do daily yoga for another 30 days. Thank you Adriene for guiding me. My only goal was to show up to my mat every day for 30 days. I did as much as I could and surprised myself by being able to do more than I thought I could. I am breathing deeply and calmly with a smile in my face as I write this. That is the effect this daily practice has on me every day, and for that I am truly grateful. üíï",Angela Anderson,2021-01-31T18:37:47Z,0

"This was so beautiful. I just have to give serious snaps for your music over the years Adriene, it felt like seeing old friends :&#39;) the Home and Revolution journeys in particular were so potent for me when I did them, so you better believe when those tunes kicked in I cried sweet tears whilst taking up all the space! Gorgeous music bridging myself and my yoga practice across past and present. <br />Thank you and well done EVERYONE. I imagined us all doing our own yoga dances across this beautiful planet. We are very much the same but also miraculously different. I followed and trusted my breath all the way through and it gives me joy to think that others were following their own unique song too. So much love x",Elizabeth Harper,2021-01-31T18:37:21Z,0
"I&#39;ve always followed along on these as best I could because I crave structure.  This is the first journey I&#39;ve done where I&#39;ve truly just let go, breathed, and moved the way my body wanted to. There was a few panicky moments where I was like OH NO have I run out of things to do? I would peek at Adriene and say &quot;oh right there&#39;s that&quot; and find a way to get there. Like a friendly clue &amp; a nudge to find my own rhythm. I feel so much more accomplished - I was floored I did the whole 50 minutes. I feel strong, focused, and clear. Thank you Adriene &amp; sleepy Benji. Can&#39;t wait to continue.",Amanda Fulmer,2021-01-31T18:36:51Z,0
"Adriene thank you so so so much for this practice! When I have done your other 30 days of yoga, I must admit I often skip a day and I always skip the last day because I don‚Äôt think I could guide myself through a practice. But this month was my first time signing up and getting the emails which kept me so motivated and I didn‚Äôt miss one day! There weren‚Äôt even days where I didn‚Äôt feel like doing it. I have been working from my kitchen/sitting room this past year so it‚Äôs hard to switch off but doing these videos after work has helped so much. I am amazed at myself and that I could do this practice today.

Day 30. I struggled to keep up with you today but realised that as long as I was doing some movement and breathing it didn&#39;t much matter.

"Thank you, Adriene! I remember last year, my first time doing the 30-day journey, when you said that we would be practicing on our own for the last day how I panicked immediately. That practice ended in a completely different mindset, one where I felt proud, confident, and calm. This year, knowing it was coming, I was actually excited to listen to my body for this last day. This was the first time I&#39;ve done a 30-day journey live, and I got emotional during this last practice knowing that I and so many others stuck with this for so long. Congratulations everyone for choosing to take time for you, and I hope we all continue regular practice past this 30-day journey.

"I almost skipped today, thought about putting on a different practice, because I didn‚Äôt want to do it without Adriene‚Äôs guidance. But then, I realized, this is what it‚Äôs all about‚Äîdeciding to take a risk, to breathe deeply, to listen trustingly to the voice within. I did what Adriene said: start with the breath, and then just do what feels good, what the body craves. I went very slowly, listening to the beautiful music, breathing the scent of my candle, learning step by step to trust myself, and whenever I got stuck I watched a bit of the video and there was my good friend Adriene reminding me of all she‚Äôs taught me. I took the video back at the end so we could bow together. I finished with a sense of confidence and hope I had been seeking from others, but now know it resides within, just like Adriene says. Thank you so much Adriene, Benji, the team, and the community for this ongoing gift. Namaste üôèüèΩ‚ù§Ô∏è",Lorinda Toledo,2021-01-31T18:31:18Z,0

As with past day 30s, I sort of panicked at the beginning, especially after I saw the length of the practice.  But then I started and kept on, listening to my body.  I have a shoulder injury that I&#39;m working to heal from a wreck, so I did those exercises and doing them to the music helped me keep a regular rhythm and, as I looked up at Adriene, I could almost hear her saying, &quot;I&#39;m proud of you for doing what you need to do for your body.  Your practice isn&#39;t about me, it&#39;s about you.&quot;  I am planning to continue my daily practice with the monthly calendars, and I added a Bridge pose towards the end (cheated and looked ahead).

"Me: what do you mean you are turning off your mic!? Panic ensues. *note- panic and old age don‚Äôt mix well...<br /><br />Got through it and it was beautiful but, I have to ask .. did anyone else lose their balance or place while trying to peek!? What I learned today is I mostly listen.. i have truly developed that skill..I look up infrequently and then just to make sure I heard right. This would be why I struggled w in person yoga classes.  No cues just flow.  <br /><br />With all that said I found today an emotional journey; sadness that it‚Äôs ending; gladness that I did get through it; joy in almost doing dancers pose; but most of all gratefulness for the gift of Breath. If I have learned anything this year is not to take it for granted.  <br /><br />I will miss this daily ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù of new practices. But, will take a deep breath and figure out where my yoga journey goes next. <br /><br />üôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è to you all and of course Adriene and Benji for an amazing start to this year.  <br /><br />Namaste üßò",Dee Dee Lynch Silverstein,2021-01-31T17:55:41Z,1

I am not sad simply grateful for the breath, for my body and this practice, for the trust you restored within me with myself, with the connection between my body, mind and soul and how honoured I am to have learned the vocabulary to create my very own practice according to what came up for me. I kept trying to show myself compassion for not being perfect and reminding myself that there is no wrong answer. Reminding myself to return to the breath when I felt lost and to focus on what feels good and to not let that end. From the very bottom of my heart and the depths of my soul, thank you Adrienne for creating this 30 day journey. I am so grateful that you opened the door for my own practice.

"Wow! Day 30!<br />I love the fact that this practice is called &quot;begin&quot;. It&#39;s the cyclicality that governs the universe. Like the breath. After an exhale, comes an inhale. And after that inhale comes a new exhale and so on. <br />It&#39;s beautiful that we get to choose our own practice today. It means that we&#39;ve got the necessary tools to be in control and to guide our bodies to &quot;find what feels good&quot;. The first times I was practicing yoga with Adriene I couldn&#39;t let go of the video on day 30, but after some time I found the confidence and courage to explore and listen to myself. This feels great!<br />So if you&#39;re having a hard time letting yourself go today, don&#39;t worry! Trust yourself, you&#39;ve got it! You know what you need and more importantly: there&#39;s no right or wrong. Just let each movement unfold and enjoy the process.<br />Love you guys! Thank you for this wonderful experience.

I realized a big part of it was because it was something to look forward to every day and to count on for being there. Those kinds of things have been a scarcity in my life recently. This journey was so precious and so so needed. <br /><br />Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I wish you all so much goodness it makes your heart sing ‚ù§",Henni,2021-01-31T17:40:26Z,0

"As I began this pracitice, I got totally surprised. I burst into tears. I think it will take some time to understand more about what was happening at that moment. One thing I know for sure. You have helped me embrace new beginnings and honor what has come before. Practicing this on the yoga mat has led to practicing it off the mat too. Lots of healing and retraining has happened. I am deeply grateful. I love that you know you offer so much more than a group exercise class. My soul has been helped by your soul. Thank you. Bless you!

"Oh Adriene. I don&#39;t know where to start.<br />Came to practice today with a sense of hesitation. I never did Day 30 on your Yoga Journey before - because I thought what I loved most about Yoga was to be guided and &quot;switching off&quot; my brain for the practice, just being told what to do next. The idea of you not talking, but just practicing just didn&#39;t make sense to me - I mean, what was I supposed to do then?<br />Still, I pressed play - and oh how much JOY I have found in this hour. Most of the time I practiced along with you - but now and then, I really felt like doing something entirely different, and without much thinking, I did it. I have found so much joy in this practice because I felt you enjoyed your practice too, to me it seemed that not talking for a change kind of &quot;freed&quot; you to just play, move, breathe and practice as well, without concentrating on what to say next.<br />I really admired how this Day 30 practice was crafted as well - I feel like every single pose we did during the whole 30 day journey was in this, every one was like a friendly reminder like, hey, remember that day? Yeah, we did that pose too! You can do it!<br />I did every video of this series, the day it came out. First time for me of not only starting,  but actually also finishing a 30 day journey with you. I am deeply grateful, I feel inspired, and was deeply moved by these 30 days as well. Love to you Adriene, love to everyone practicing, filled with joy, gratefulness, love. All the feels. &lt;3",Lisa Laquelle,2021-01-31T17:32:16Z,1

"Dear Adriene, a (very public) love letter from me to you this time. Thank you for an incredible 30 days. I spent most of the beginning of the practice in tears (happy ones) but moved from that to a feeling of euphoria as I worked through the practice with you. I surprised and delighted myself by remembering so much more than I&#39;d realised but could also hear you, like little Angel Adriene, talking to me from within  - from tapping into my inner smile to smearing honey during the twist, from enjoying my little love cave during child&#39;s poise to  slapping my butt during Knocking On Heaven&#39;s Door! I channeled my breath using it in the way you&#39;ve taught me, I thought about the juxtaposition of internal and external rotations....I could go on. It was an incredible hour made all the more special by seeing that I&#39;d been practicing with almost 11,000 folk. That&#39;s a lot of people taking what they&#39;ve learned on the mat into the world and that can only be a good thing. Namaste. Here&#39;s to the next adventure.

Just remembering to breathe. What a blessing you are to this world, Adriene. Thank you for being you, for being so vulnerable, and for creating this work that changes lives. You‚Äôve certainly changed mine. Namaste.",KBlades,2021-01-31T17:17:07Z,0
"This was my third 30 Day Journey with Adriene so I knew what was coming and it scared me.  I love listening to Adriene&#39;s voice and I usually do most of the practices with my eyes closed. I like structure and so to have none freaks me out.  But this time, I told myself to just breathe and see where the Breath takes you.  I had some achy body parts, so I knew some areas that needed attention and there was a balancing pose I wanted to give one more try.  So I just started in a comfortable seat with the breath and it took me on the journey I needed for today.  I did experience that one amazing moment where I looked at my screen and I was in the exact same posture as Adriene and I smiled.  Thank you Adriene and Benji for being our amazing guides.

It was hard, I wasn&#39;t always motivated, these were times I struggled. I&#39;ve learned a lot about myself back then (still am). And now, here I am, two years later, loving yoga and meditation, feeling flexible, stronger (physically and mentally), feeling whole. And, did the whole 30 day yoga journey without missing a day (the first time that it ever happens!). In these tough and strange times we are all living now, it is really a relief. A light even.

Marcel Marceau yoga - great moves in the last 30 days. Not to be contrary but I go to Ludwig Van #6 - the Pastoral symphony instead of new age tunes. He was deaf when he wrote this and composed it in his mind as he walked through the woods - so Yoga in silence is impossible because my mind hears Ludwig.

I had just come to my meditation room after hearing a bit of news...vaccines, disagreement, one year since covid (etc, etc) and I think it all just hit me!  One year since the day that would change all of our lives dramatically.  But the breath is what connects us to this moment and allows us to surrender, allow, trust and open to it so that we can begin anew in each moment.  I do not know what the future holds for any of us but the vision I saw during savasana spoke the truth.  I saw the light of God/the Universe/the Creator streaming down upon all of us lighting our way with love.

Goose bumps. Very end of practice.  I have been doing theses 30 days as long as I can remember. The silent practice is always my hardest to connect and feel it. This one was different. Breath.  I was able to allow myself to feel it. Breath when I felt lost.  Let it support me and feel.  Thank you so much for this amazing practice.  This was everything I needed and more.,Diane Swauger,2021-01-31T16:57:18Z,0
"That was a wonderful end and beginning. However, now I need a neck message from constantly trying to look at my iPad. Also, not breathing as I should for the same reason.",Don McClarin,2021-01-31T16:57:13Z,18

May the both of us continue to find humility and difficulty in these practices, and remind us that we‚Äôre just trying our best. You‚Äôre amazing, and you‚Äôre so so welcome. Let‚Äôs do this ‚ù§Ô∏è",whitney nicole,2021-01-31T19:21:16Z,0
"@whitney nicole Thank you so much for your kind and encouraging words. Yoga is new to me and I did, in fact, go back and finish the practice, although I was wishing for verbal cues the whole time! I truly appreciate your words of encouragement and do plan to keep on going with the February calendar. Perhaps I‚Äôm wound too tightly, and this practice is exactly the kind of thing I need! Thank you. üôèüèª",Kate,2021-01-31T17:25:22Z,1
"I believe it takes a hell of a lot of courage to make it to the 17 minute mark of this practice. We have been held, so consistently and for so long, by Adriene and her sweet voice. It is totally human of us to have mental stops and hiccups. Throughout today&#39;s practice, I definitely had a couple of mental pauses, &#39;wait, how&#39;d I get into that lunge? oh, I guess I&#39;m not sure&#39;, but eventually, I found that lunge on the other side again. Our journey won&#39;t be perfect, with an equal amount of time spent on &quot;both sides&quot; of the body, or even a perfect replica of what we did the first time. This is how we learn about ourselves, and discover our own inner teacher. The initiation to Find What Feels Good could absolutely be you substituting another video in lieu of today&#39;s practice. So find what feels good, Kate, I think you&#39;ve done an insurmountably incredible job of taking on this journey and being here today. It&#39;s in our goofs and the things that challenge us where we really discover how to persevere, and how to breathe.<br />You should come back to day 30 in your own beautiful, sweet way, with perhaps another ywa video to wrap things up with a big bow. You&#39;re not alone, we&#39;ll all be breathing with you :-)",whitney nicole,2021-01-31T16:49:54Z,0

"I never comment on videos, but I felt I just couldn‚Äôt leave without contributing something to the sea of support under this lovely day 30 practice. Adriene, I can‚Äôt thank you enough. Your positive attitude and energy every day has been so rewarding, especially when I feel like I‚Äôm dragging myself into a practice. I did Home in August and learned so much, showed up every day, and vastly improved my vocabulary. However, on day 30, I saw that the practice was unguided, and didn‚Äôt trust myself enough to try it out. This time, guided by my breath, I decided to give it a try. And guess what? When the music ended, I had just put my hands together and was just about to say namaste. I was so shocked that the fifty minutes were over! YouTube autoplayed another video and I actually said ‚Äúwait what? But I didn‚Äôt even get to say goodbye!!‚Äù out loud to my phone. Then I realized that that‚Äôs just what this practice is all about. It‚Äôs a new beginning. Don‚Äôt decide where it ends. I had so much fun exploring my practice today, and I just trusted myself to explore and be creative. The result? I held crow for longer than I have ever before! Adriene and this community‚Äôs inspiring comments I would read in preparation for or after most practices have been so fun to practice with, but I can guarantee that this is just the beginning! Thank you, everyone. Let‚Äôs all continue to show up. Let‚Äôs all continue to listen to our breath.The journey is only beginning.  Namaste.",Studio Emi,2021-01-31T16:36:38Z,0

I&#39;ve loosely followed your calendars for various months over the years but this is the first time I have followed all 30 and did this final practice with you and the community. It was so satisfying to sequence my own flow for each side and lean into where my body wanted to go. There was even a time when I looked up and we were both in cobra! This month I have felt like my mornings have been reclaimed (I did them before work) and have noticed my breath even more connected/conscious/intentional in my running as well.

"Adriene - today I felt myself fully arrive into my whole being. For the first 25 years of my life, I lived my everyday life as a cisgender gay male. Recently, after my 25th birthday, I realized that these strict gender categorizations were limiting my happiness - being told by society that I am a gay man when I felt this wasn&#39;t quite right. Through my Wicca practice and yoga, I began to feel more aligned with the term &quot;non-binary.&quot; This was a revelatory beginning for me, feeling my years of discomfort with my body, mind, and spirit start to spill out over the edges of societal confinements. Today during this practice, I embrace the beginning of my new journey as gender fluid, queer, and limitless. During this practice, I embraced my body and soul as it is - outside of myself and with the hundreds of thousands of other souls practicing with me. We are all limitless, we are all free, we are all HUMAN. From one Adrian to another Adriene, Namaste.",A D,2021-01-31T15:50:24Z,1

"I couldn&#39;t follow along today&#39;s practice without Adriene&#39;s voice, had to constantly look at the screen in a panic.  Adriene we love to hear you talk and that also provides us another level of mental calmness.",puneet nahal,2021-01-31T15:49:37Z,35
Stiff neck from looking up to see where we were... but I got through it.. I knew she wouldnt be speaking this video so I was prepared but.. sorta  a let down... Still ... I did 30 days! Yeah for us!,Isabel Fernald,2021-01-31T20:28:30Z,1
"I thought about switching to an older video for guided practice, but I stuck with this and found it worthwhile. This is partly being about realizing the knowledge you have gained about yoga practice and doing what feels good moment by moment. I&#39;d still rather be guided, but I appreciate this encouragement to find my own inner voice.",Lokilicious,2021-01-31T19:35:13Z,1
"@Katie Deutsch you&#39;re correct, the point is to not look at the screen and to follow your own intuition. I usually just have a quick glance at the screen if I&#39;m stuck on where to go next but the rest of the time I&#39;m in my own little flow. It can be daunting at first but once you get going your body usually knows what to do :)",MsSmurflover,2021-01-31T18:41:22Z,0
"On the final days of these 30-day journeys, the idea is actually to NOT look at the screen. You have to trust in yourself and use the knowledge you&#39;ve built through this journey to move through a practice that is entirely your own. Adriene is there to practice with you, but not to take you through what she is doing on screen. Try again and let your inner voice tell you what to do rather than trying to follow Adriene, and I bet you&#39;ll have a better experience. It can be scary at first, but it&#39;s very freeing and you&#39;ll feel wonderful at the end knowing that you allowed yourself to take the reins and listen to what your own body needs. Best of luck &lt;3",Erin Noelle,2021-01-31T18:27:51Z,1
"@Seana Yates Same here, been doing yoga for about 17 years. For me the guidance Adriene usually gives allows me to lose my thoughts and let go, I don&#39;t have to think about what to do next as I&#39;m informed of that. Choice can be frustrating. Of course is great to choose between plank or tabletop, modifications are welcome and I frequently make them, but a general guided session is what I crave.",SD Hurford,2021-01-31T18:07:33Z,0

"This has been an incredibly transforming journey for me. I have never fully committed to a regular &quot;exercise&quot; routine of any kind. I went into this with a totally open mind and it has completely reshaped the way that I function on a daily basis. I feel empowered, mentally sharp and strong.

Third year in the bag üôèüñ§. Thank you for always guiding us. Adriene I started and learned yoga because of you. I was always afraid to practice in front of others. Last year I found an in-person yoga community. It had been a personal goal of mine but was still nervous. Of course it&#39;s been outdoor and zoom practices but it&#39;s been so fulfilling. I thought I wouldn&#39;t be good enough to join but what I learned from this channel was more than enough. I&#39;m so grateful that Adriene and yoga have become these positive influences in my life. Namaste.,Alfredo Pasta,2021-01-31T15:45:18Z,2
"I missed half of this beautiful last day of yoga because I felt I had to keep one eye on the screen. For me, it would be better to have Adriene walk us through the poses so we could close our eyes and relax. Anyone feel this way? Can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow and see where the yoga will take us. Thank you Adriene for this wonderful 30 day BREATH journey.",Helen Valenzuela,2021-01-31T15:45:00Z,66
"Erin Noelle this is the first time I‚Äôve completed a 30 day journey to its end. Throughout all of it, I‚Äôve completely surrendered to the process, participating fully, feeling, and being present. Today‚Äôs video took all of that away from me. I feel disheartened. I told myself to surrender, but all it did was make me anxious as I felt I had to try and always anticipate the next move. Not knowing that the silent narrative was a tradition, I had no way to prepare myself mentally or emotionally. This is something I felt could have been trickled in throughout the 29 days somehow. Even if there was a very basic narration, maybe where she did a pre recorded voice over, or had someone else narrate. She is the teacher, who knows each move, so she can surrender into it. To inform us on the last day doesn‚Äôt give us a chance to prepare. I had so much negative narrative going on in my mind, and couldn‚Äôt do the breath work properly. I hate that I‚Äôve come away from such an amazing journey, feeling deflated and disappointed. I felt very emotional at the end, not because it was over, but because after this entire month, I wasn‚Äôt able to enjoy the last day. I know her intentions were very meaningful, but in some ways I feel it missed the mark. I will still do her videos, and maybe somewhere down the track, I will try/try to be more present during the last day, but for now I will avoid the last day videos, as I don‚Äôt want to feel this way again at the end of another 30 day journey. This style obviously doesn‚Äôt work for everyone, and maybe some sort of compromise needs to be made, so some/many of us don‚Äôt walk away feeling like I do.",Cora Augusta,2021-01-31T20:23:53Z,0
"I felt more uncomfortable with it last year (my first YWA 30 Day challenge), but this time it was good. I had to just let go, and sometimes you are in a completely different place than she is. I had some weird ¬´¬†screw ups,¬†¬ª but they also worked for me. I‚Äôd keep peeking, too, but then I‚Äôd just stay a long time in certain poses or guess at the next part and end up somewhere similar. I can see how it‚Äôs not for everyone, but I  actually feel like there‚Äôs something really emotional about the silence. I felt like her unspoken cues and my inner cues melded.",Isabelle Jorgensen,2021-01-31T20:18:29Z,1
"@Erin Noelle That doesn&#39;t work for everyone, however. I am on the autism spectrum and while I get the point of not providing audio cues, my brain works differently. I can&#39;t freeform or improvise or just be creative on the spot. It&#39;s not about not trusting myself, I just cannot &quot;do my own thing&quot;. My brain just does not work that way.",Joanne McNair,2021-01-31T20:04:36Z,0
"Agreed. Besides, I don&#39;t come here to do a freestyle yoga flow. If I wanted that, I would just do yoga without going on youtube. Yoga is a place where i can typically let go of my frustrations and just focus on the guidance, today was the complete opposite for me. Stressful, annoying, and for the first time in this journey, I left the practice feeling worse than i did when I came in. Going to avoid these ones moving forward.",Joel Tietz,2021-01-31T19:35:00Z,5
"Yes. I did not breathe properly, I did not do all the poses, my neck hurt when I finally gave up because I was constantly trying to see the TV. If we have the vocabulary, then we need the words in my opinion.",Michele Lastovica,2021-01-31T19:33:09Z,0

It had a very calming effect on me, and it moved me because I felt more connected to this community than ever before.

"This is my first 30 day challenge and although I understand the emotional and physical impact of a DIY practice, I‚Äôm a bit frustrated. This month has no practices that are this long, so after 20 minutes of genuinely soothing and wonderful practice on my own I checked how much time was left and was shocked and frustrated to see 30 minutes left; I felt prepared to do 15/-25 minutes, as we had done a lot of those, but I felt unprepared to do such a long practice on my own, despite on and off years of (guided) yoga practice. <br />Time cues or an optional audio track would be a big help for those of us who are either uninterested or unprepared for a practice like this. <br />Pretty sad to end a great journey without a guided practice. Would have loved for this to be say 29, and then end on a big note together, guided, for day 30. <br />I‚Äôll be doing old 30 day of yoga months for the next 6 months, but might be skipping the final day of each.",Zoe Weinstein,2021-01-31T15:19:30Z,0

"WOW. Adriene. THANK YOU for teaching me this month what the magic of yoga is. I&#39;ve always struggled with yoga; to be in the now, in the moment. I would always get restless, wishing the minutes would go by quicker. I never thought I&#39;d be able to do a 50 min yoga routine - if I saw that a video was longer than 20 mins I would never go for it, as I couldn&#39;t bare the thought of having to be &quot;still&quot; for that long. It just seemed impossible. I can&#39;t believe that I&#39;ve now managed to do a 30 day challenge with you and all the other wonderful people across the globe!¬†<br />When you said in the beginning of the video that you wouldn&#39;t be guiding us in this one, I panicked. I&#39;ve gotten so used to having you in my ears, guiding me through every step of the way. Holding my hand. How would I be able to do 50 mins without you holding my hand?¬†<br />I cried like a baby the first 10-15 mins of the practice. I don&#39;t know whether it was because I was scared and questioned if I could do this on my own, because of the absolutely beautiful music throughout the whole practice, or just because of the pure fact that you put your trust in me (us) that I (we) can do this on our own. Perhaps it was a combination of all of these factors. I just felt so touched.¬†<br />Somewhere along the middle of the practice my crying finally subsided. I even surprised myself by remembering the names of the poses that we did. And I remembered to breathe. I must admit, it was hard to follow along the practice without having you in my ears, as I like to close my eyes when I do yoga, but I am very happy with my efforts. Once I heard the outro music coming on at the end I started crying again. I am so proud of myself.¬†I did it!<br />This month was so worth it and I look forward to continuing. What an incredible journey you took us on.¬†ü•∫¬†Thank you again, Adriene. üôè‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è¬†(and a special thanks to the cutest thing Benji¬†üêï¬† as well¬†that has made me smile throughout this journey)¬†Sending my love from Sweden!

"After reading the email I thought she would take off the mic but we would still have guidance. When it started, I panicked cause she wasn&#39;t there lol... then when she stepped on her mat, I was like, oh, so we&#39;re supposed to just do our own thing?? I was apprehensive at first but decided to just go with what felt good! Sometimes I was in the same position and other times I just observed and got ideas for positions I&#39;d forgotten about.

"It&#39;s really hard to put into words how I feel after this last practiceüòä I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because of the beautiful background music or knowing that it&#39;s the last day and I really did my best, but it never ever felt easier to do the poses, everything went so smoothly,  no shaky planks, no losing my balance, deeper twists, more flexibility. Downward facing dog was never my favourite but today that was so easy as well, my heels even touched the ground sometimes and I could even stay in crow pose for almost 2 seconds üòÄ I feel amazing, I see real results and I am proud of myself. Of course my poses are not perfect but I trust that I am exactly where I should be. <br />I will miss the live sessions but I will definitely continue with the monthly calendars. üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br />Sending lots of love to this beautiful community, keep it up, you&#39;re awesome!!! ‚ù§<br />And Adriene, thank you from the bottom of my heart! ‚ù§üôè",J√∫lia Bek≈ë,2021-01-31T14:33:51Z,0

I ended up practicing a blend of Kundalini, Yin, and Yinyasa this morning.<br /><br /> Namaste to my fellow practioners, Benji, and beautiful Adriene!",Gina Marie,2021-01-31T14:09:20Z,0

"I&#39;ve done every 30 day journey available so far, but I&#39;ve never finished the last day session until now. Usually I don&#39;t trust myself with my own instructions, but hearing the ending songs from the other 30 Day series made me happy I finally took the chance today. Thank you, Adriene, for encouraging us to trust ourselves. ‚ù§",A. Vigorito,2021-01-31T14:08:27Z,0
"I love what you curate for us and I&#39;ve been following you for a long time and so happy that it has brought so many to the mat. I, unfortunately always dread the 30th day. I like the verbal cues...albeit sometimes a little more wordy than necessary - lol but I lost my breath today trying to crank my head around to try to follow. Finally I gave up and just did my own thing with the poses that help some of the reasons I come to the mat. And yes, I can hear you now Adriene, that&#39;s what I should be doing but it certainly wasn&#39;t flowy. I was proud to be able to push the reset button and stick with a daily practise this month and will continue. (Just skipping any of the Day 30 practises &lt;smile&gt;)",Linda Pogor,2021-01-31T14:06:14Z,0
"Same for me!  My solution has been to watch Day 30 and record my own narration of what Adriene is doing so I&#39;m not cranking my head to look at the video or losing pace with her.  It feels a little like cheating but I did it for the last 30-day series I did before this one, and it worked for me!  I just finished making my recording and am about to get on the mat.  Congrats on making it to Day 30! Namaste.",Lisa Gaughran,2021-01-31T14:13:29Z,1
"Thank you so much, Adriene! This is my third &#39;yoga journey&#39; that I&#39;ve tuned in for...Also getting emotional, here; to think I&#39;ve already spent a couple of years (kick-started by these journeys) fighting weakness and despair (due to mild scoliosis, misfortune, and my first personal exposure to tragedy) -- I&#39;m finally at a place where I can FEEL STRENGTH and inner support! <br />As a superstitious Aries, new beginnings are supposed to be my forte, yet I&#39;ve had such a hard time &#39;getting the feel&#39; of this...THE BREATH was the final piece! (It should have been the first!) &#39;Dedicate&#39; and &#39;Home&#39; allowed me to dig deep within, through all the tensions, twinges, discomforts and weirdness...&#39;Breath&#39; is creating that repetition that continues to pull my spine (and the rest of me) back to center.

Today is last day of January, I looked back of the whole month, it was a bit chaotic but I am glad that I tried to do yoga everyday to give myself a moment of self-care, a moment of peace.

I just did another random video, because I thought I can&#39;t do it on my own.<br />The next year I tried day 30 on my own, but it didn&#39;t feel very good. I looked at Adriene a lot and had to think really hard between poses, what to do next.<br />Then it got better every year! I learned to enjoy it and boy, did I love THIS day 30! 50 minutes, just me and my breath, eyes closed for a lot of the time and IT. FELT. SO. GOOD. I even broke a sweat, although nobody forced me too, just because I wanted to test my limits and see where my breath would take me.<br />Thank you, Adriene and Benji! &lt;3",K.

"I got the invitation. I Arrived on the mat. I anchored on my Breath and my Breath was my Anchor all the way. I Listened to every sensation of the body and my inner feelings and thoughts. I Replenished. I Burnt what no longer serves me. I Synchronized breath and movement. I Snuggled. I Balanced. I totally Connected. I Flowed at my own pace. I Dropped all expectations, control, anxiety. I Felt safe &amp; sound. I gave Space to my thoughts, my insecurities. I Entered my discomfort zone. I embraced Discipline as a means to evolve spiritually, emotionally and physically. I Explored new boundaries. I Centered on my Breath as my anchor. I Strengthened each day. I Paused to breathe and Find What Feels Good. I Controlled my Breath. I Renewed my practice. I Dedicated time to self-care daily. I Rejuvenated my mind, my spirit, my body. I Loved each moment of this journey. I Expanded my present moment. I Healed in ways I never imagined possible. I Trusted my journey, my progress, one day at a time. I Believed. O h. Yeah! I never stopped believing in myself, in my commitment. I Begin Today with profound gratitude for all that I am, all that I have and all that I need is inside me.

"@Anastasia Kalacheva Wow, there&#39;s no need to be so aggressive. Again I really wish you wouldn&#39;t keep saying my mindset is wrong and that I&#39;m being negative. I&#39;m really not. I&#39;m just explaining my experience and I&#39;m sorry that you don&#39;t understand that. There&#39;s really no need to respond in such an aggressive way to someone who&#39;s just trying to communicate her experience. <br /><br />I&#39;m not closed off to feedback at all. I&#39;m responding with an open heart and instead of attempting to understand me, you&#39;re ignoring what I&#39;m saying. You&#39;re not engaging with me. I&#39;m trying to give you the benefit of the doubt by being open and you&#39;re not willing to accept my experiences. Yoga is for everyone and those of us who don&#39;t come to yoga for the same reasons you do have just as much right to our experiences. If our experiences are negative, that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re wrong. That just means something isn&#39;t for us, and we&#39;re allowed to give our honest feedback about our struggles with it. I&#39;m sorry if you can&#39;t see that. Toxic positivity is harmful.",Prosateuse,2021-02-20T11:15:19Z,1
"@Prosateuse First of all, I really do not understand your tone and your wish to take everything as a personal attack. Multiple times in my comment I stated that what I&#39;m saying is a personal view or opinion or experience. I also stated that it simply might not be for some people, and some people do have the wrong mindset. The only time I directly referenced your mindset was when I said &quot;change your mindset that you&#39;re not succeeding&quot;. Which was a direct reference to your previous comment saying that you&#39;re feeling frustrated because you can&#39;t do it. Saying someone has the wrong mindset is not condescending. I myself have had a wrong mindset when it came to many things and was open to being corrected when someone pointed it out. <br /><br />Second - All I am trying to do is help you. Maybe you are in the same place I was a couple years or months ago, and maybe my suggestions will help. That is all. I am sharing my personal opinions, views, and experiences. <br /><br />Third - Adrienne provided a video as a stepping stone to do yoga all on our own. It&#39;s like a step between being guided fully by her, and doing all on our own. I already explained the purpose of the video. And it is not so we follow 100% of what she is doing.<br /><br />Fourth - If you don&#39;t like this format, then don&#39;t watch it. She has a channel rich with different length videos that do have cues.<br /><br />Fifth - You seem closed off fully to feedback. You stated that you do not understand the purpose and feel frustrated, yet when someone has tried to engage with you (in multiple comments), you reply in a manner that makes it clear you only want people of a similar opinion to be your &quot;yes&quot; man. And since I feel like if you don&#39;t understand my point after so many words, you never will, this will be my last comment here addressing you. <br /><br />I&#39;m sorry that you did not find this specific video helpful, but it is no reason to complain or be negative. It is easy to not be stubborn and simply choose to watch another video. Peace out.",Anastasia Kalacheva,2021-02-20T10:41:17Z,2
"@Anastasia Kalacheva ¬†@Anastasia Kalacheva¬† I just feel like you&#39;re not understanding what many people get out of yoga that they can&#39;t get without a set flow. I enjoy yoga because I can move and turn my mind off. So like many others I find this frustrating, because constantly pausing to work out what to do next is the opposite of what I come to yoga to achieve. I have to think about what to do next, and remember what I did before, so I can balance it out on the other side. I have to count to remember how long I held for, so I can repeat that. It&#39;s not the experience that I usually get from yoga. I rush, I get frustrated, and it&#39;s just unpleasant. So I do yoga videos. Asking myself &quot;what do I want to do now?&quot; after every movement is an unpleasant experience. I don&#39;t &quot;want&quot; to do anything. &quot;Want&quot; is not why I come to yoga. <br /><br />What you&#39;re saying is that I didn&#39;t enjoy it because of my &quot;mindset&quot;.  That I should sit and breathe because I can&#39;t look at the video and do yoga at the same time. I want to do the sequence! Adriene wouldn&#39;t have provided one if we were just meant to ignore it. <br /><br />I get that you don&#39;t understand what I and many others look for in a yoga video but we shouldn&#39;t be condescended to as just having the wrong mindset if the video doesn&#39;t work for us.",Prosateuse,2021-02-20T10:19:56Z,1
"@Prosateuse hi again! I never said that you don&#39;t trust yourself or your body. I was just trying to put into words what I thought the message was, and the practice was about. <br /><br />I fully recognize that this day 30 might just be unsuitable for a small portion of people. But I feel like a portion just also get lost in the wrong mindset. I&#39;ve been there myself! I used to think that I had to do a flow that is structured and coherent. A flow that Adrienne would do! But after just finishing my day 30 practice, I realised that it is NOT about that. Like Adrienne said in the beginning, even if you just breathe for 50 minutes, it&#39;s okay! The main point is to get onto the mat and be there for the duration of the practice. No matter what you actually do on the mat. For example, today I breathed for a good 10-20 minutes. Did some gentle twist and side stretches while seated ( just because they&#39;re my favourite moves). Took longer than usual in cat-cow (because I never feel like I get enough during the structured lessons). Then wanted to get into a flow so I did a couple low lunge and down dog series. Arms started to hurt, so instead of doing belly down to cobra, I remembered that I really liked chair pose and other leg-oriented poses. So I did those. Arms felt a bit more rested so I did high lunges (as a step up/ more progressed than low lunges). Exhausted after, so laid in child&#39;s pose. Then did some boats and abs (again, just because I felt like it). Then I ran out of inspiration so I glanced at Adrienne and she was doing crows pose. So that reminded me that I wanted to try that, as well as the low squat and toe stand! So I did those in my own time and when I came down to corpse pose, Adrienne has already been in it for a while.<br /><br />Reason I wrote all that out, is because I never actually planned any of those poses ahead of time. I came to the mat. Sat down and started the way Adrienne did as a way to guide me into the practice. Then from there, after every movement, I asked myself &quot;what do I want to/ feel like doing now?&quot; Sometimes, I&#39;d remember a pose or sequence in the middle of doing another one and just do that one next! When I had a sequence I wanted to do but my muscles got too tired, I just let myself have a child&#39;s pose or other resting posture so I could go into that one next. Or I all-together went into another posture that concentrated on another part of my body.<br /><br />Again, I totally understand that this might not be suitable for some people. And this is not me trying to tell you that you&#39;re doing anything wrong. I&#39;m just trying to give my personal view. And perhaps trying to change your mindset that you&#39;re not succeeding to a mindset of maybe today was just a &quot;sit and breathe&quot; day for you. Personally, every time I feel like I&#39;m not doing enough, I remind myself that Adrienne has given us 10-20 minute pure breathing videos before. And that despite not moving much or at all besides breathing, I still learnt something new about myself.<br /><br />Again, I understand how it can be frustrating. I myself have done the 30 days series for 4 times before finally lasting the whole 50 minutes confidently this time around.",Anastasia Kalacheva,2021-02-20T10:07:03Z,1

I have never been the sort for any form of physical activity and this lingering fear of failure of pain is always at the back of my mind. I&#39;ve been working on it for a while now but only through this journey have I been able to overcome it. I feel ready for more. I will  be on the mat tomorrow perhaps even for the rest of my life. Life is so short..... XOXO.  Please leave me a reply!!To all who have made it on the mat even if once this month, well done. If you have any fears know, y ou can do it.

"What a grande finale this day 30 practice was for the mind, body and soul. Such an honour to practice alongside so many wonderful people across the globe, connected through this beautiful yoga journey. I felt particularly emotional at the beginning, emotions from a tough week bubbling over, but also due to the joy of this beautiful journey. Thank you Adriene, once again for another incredible 30-day journey. You are such a kind, generous and beautiful person to share your yoga joy with the rest of the world.

"Day 30: done! This last day was beautiful! Have been experiencing during this month a improvement in posture and flexibility, and my body feeling lighter. But the greatest thing I can say about this journey is how much it helped me with my anxiety. I can feel a better connection to the present moment and just being alive. Thank you Adriene for sharing such a lovely thing as yoga with us, in your kind and genuine way! I&#39;m taking yoga with me for life.

Anyone else find that completely impossible &amp; frustrating? How are we meant to follow along with no guidance when the positions mean we can‚Äôt see the screen? I couldn‚Äôt relax into any posture because I had to keep my eyes on the screen the whole time. At first I thought the music was going to change slightly every time there was a change (which would have been a great idea)  but it stopped doing that after the first few changes.<br /><br />I love YWA and have really enjoyed the journey but this was a frustrating end. Maybe have a ‚Äòwatch Adriene do yoga‚Äô video as a bonus at the end but not as the final day for everyone.,Rebecca Cartwright-Teakle,2021-01-31T12:52:49Z,0
These mic-off practices are always a bit daunting but I really enjoyed this one! I followed the main structure of your practice but I also made my own decisions.

I had hoped to have the journey end together doing the same poses but as is tradition we end on our own journey.  Kind of a symbol for how things are now we are all having to learn to embrace the solitude and be comfortable with ourselves and that we are on this journey alone people may be on the same path but ultimately we must find our own way.

"Warning: Sappy post!  As we began today&#39;s practice, I started following you just as every other morning before.  Your prompts were whispering in my head as we moved.  &quot;Begin to gently deepen your breath, marry the effort with ease, find what feels good.&quot;  At some point, I stopped and just began watching the video (probably not what we were supposed to do, but . . . . ), I became overwhelmed with gratitude for your beautiful soul and how this practice has grown into a sacred time that I look forward to and can hardly go one day without.  About that time, Benji was at the window and you unfolded your blanket and patted it for Benji to come lay down which he did.  I was almost in tears.  And then I began listening. I could not only hear your prompts, but also my guide within.  From that point on, I didn&#39;t try to follow your lead, but did what came to me naturally and what I felt like my body and soul needed.  Then you were doing &quot;knocking over heaven&#39;s door&quot; and I was like, &quot;No, wait for me!&quot;  LOL!  I met up with you and moved on through the practice with a smile and much gratitude for all those on this journey together.

"Thank you so much Adriene, and to everyone else who&#39;s been along for the ride at the same time. This is my first time doing a 30 day journey in real time, and it&#39;s been an incredible experience :&#39;) This is also my first time looking forward to the traditional no-mic day 30, and I&#39;m very impressed with myself for filling almost an hour hahah. When I saw how long the video was I was pretty skeptical of my own abilities, but hey. We made it. At one point I laughed out loud because I glanced at the screen to see what Adriene was doing and we were doing the exact same thing. <br /><br />Thanks again for these videos. See you tomorrow hehe.",Mado,2021-01-31T12:33:34Z,1

"What a way to end 30 days of YWA. I could feel the shift during this last class...I just followed my intuition and often times I was right along with Adriene as she wordlessly guided us..probably because I could hear her words in my head. The sign of a great teacher. Other times I just did my own thing, and that was pretty empowering.I was a bit worried that 50 mins would be too long, because in Dec I would&#39;ve found even 20 mins to be a long session..I&#39;m not usually one to move slowly or just sit in stillness. But I noticed how I was just marinating and soaking up all the delicious moments, savouring my breath. When the intro music came on in the end, and we brought our hands to the third eye, I felt tears in my eyes. What a way to begin this year.

When I couldn‚Äôt find joy in anything I found myself seeking the mat. Really, thank you Adriene.<br><br>During this challenge I found out that I especially enjoy ujjayi breath. It lets me imagine ocean waves. This last practice really let me explore that. As I breathe in I imagine being the ocean itself and pulling the water back and it makes me feel grand and powerful. As I breathe out I imagine myself on the beach as soft warm waves engulf me and I can actually feel a gentle warm sensation come over my body. It was so beautiful.

Very surprised at how quickly that 45 minute self practice went by. Ive been practicing YWA for 3 ish years now and this was the first year I completed the 30 days in order, adding several other videos to each day to the practice 60-90 mins per day. There were tough days, but feel my practice has grown a lot in the last 30 days. The past three years of yoga have been life changing to say the least. Getting on the mat is the one time I can find unity between mind, body and soul. That exquisite stillness is truly sublime. One of the beautiful things about yoga is that there is always room to grow. Every ending is a new beginning! Words of wisdom from a true master. Thank you for your teachings and insight always.

Thank you Adriene for this beautiful journey !! And congratulations everyone for participating. I personally missed one day because of college but I&#39;m still very proud for showing up (almost) every day ! And It&#39;s only the beginning ! So I&#39;ll be back on the mat tomorrow and every day after (as much as I can at least).  Thank you again Adriene !! You seriously make my life better and more peaceful with the outside world but also with what&#39;s going on inside myself.,Felix Le Chat,2021-01-31T11:29:52Z,0

"Omg it&#39;s actually day 30 ü•∫ This was the first time I tried Yoga and honestly I didn&#39;t think I would make it when I started, because I already tried a lot of other 30 day challenges/journeys where I tried to lose weight or something. But for this new year I found, that I&#39;d like to primarily do something for the soul and my mental health, so I found you. I&#39;m so thankful for being able to do this journey with all of you wonderful souls, because I feel like it changed me so much, everything in life seems more manageable and I&#39;m less stressed in general. I feel like there&#39;s so much more love and piece in my soul, for the people around me as well as for myself (which took a looong time). Also, although this time it wasn&#39;t my main goal, I feel like I got much stronger and fitter! I noticed, that a lot of practices, that were hard for me in the beginning, became easier over time, which just shows me again, how consistency and basically just showing up every day is key. I again just want to say thank you to Adriene and to all the yogis around the world. Thanks for doing this together and all of your supportive and loving comments ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",Cel√§ P.,2021-01-31T11:28:04Z,0

"Day 30: Begin. ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre unsure of how to begin, always start with a new breath‚Äô. Beauty is in essence. The beauty that we are all here. The beauty that we all practiced together. The beauty that each one of us was in this journey together. I have loved every bit of this entire journey and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I started this, feeling emotional. I really didn‚Äôt want this to end. This journey has had and always will have a special place in my heart. These days have allowed to me grow, to become who I am, to love myself, to be in my own skin and to cherish those around me. I couldn‚Äôt ask more from a journey.

"I can&#39;t even describe the way i feel. I&#39;m so emotional and so proud. Of myself. Of all of us who decided to show up and practice. <br />It&#39;s different this year. It&#39;s been much easier to focus and stay still but the way I feel has changed. I&#39;m so grateful for an opportunity to be a part of this challenge again but I&#39;m also a bit relieved it&#39;s our last day. I&#39;m ready for my own practice, I missed it and couldn&#39;t wait.<br /><br /><br />I hope we can meet next year, maybe a bit happier and more free, without too many worries. <br /><br />This is my favourite quotation: &quot;Listen - are you breathing just a little, and calling it a life?&quot; I keep thinking about it a lot. Thank you.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you so, so much Adriene (and Benji). It&#39;s been an amazing journey. And it&#39;s much easier to breathe‚ô•",Osoroshii,2021-01-31T10:55:19Z,0

"Thank you Adriene for the past 30 days, it was an honor to practice with you and even though I couldn&#39;t follow every practice I feel like I have grown so much and learned so many new tools. I was nervous to practice alone today, but it worked out so well and I cannot believe I just invented my own 50 minute yoga practice. I especially loved learning about the breath and new breathing techniques, which I will incorporate into my daily life, especially in anxious moments. I am getting really emotional because I was able to find a new source of joy in my life thanks to this 30 day journey. I cannot wait for new practices and new experiences.

"I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one here to say, this series has gotten me through the month. Without this series I don‚Äôt know how I would have coped with how horrible this January has been. For those people coming to this in the future, where the trauma we‚Äôve been through has faded from recent memory, it was traumatic to live through such a time. Each day brought with it a barrel of negative news, which I will not go into here. But each day also brought a new video. And boy, did I use that time to reset myself. To centre and reconnect. To remember that there is good in the world. <br /><br />To all my fellow participants, seeing your comments each day also renewed my faith that the world IS a good place. Thank you to each and every one of you who took the time to say something. Your words touched more people than you‚Äôll ever know. <br /><br />And finally, to Adriene, Benji, and all the people behind the scenes at YWA, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

My goal was to introduce a new routine to my everyday and to move my body. I recieved so much more. BREATH helped me deal with my grandmother passing away which I didn&#39;t know how to handle. After each practice the first two weeks I cried and felt like I could really let go of the sorrow I felt. It was a complete new feeling to me and instead of only feeling sorrow I felt grateful for the time I got to spend with her. <br /><br />I learned that I can do much more than I could ever imagine and feel so proud of my self for doing this for me. I also feel proud because I&#39;m doing this out of self love, this time is purely for caring for my body and mind.<br /><br />Thank you for creating this for us. For teaching and sharing your knowledge and wisdom.

"It has been wonderful to wake up every morning for 30 days to spend the first moments of my day with Adriene, Benji and this kind community of like-minded people. It was incredibly motivating to breathe and be in it together so of course i feel a bit sad today that it&#39;s come to an end. But I&#39;m looking forward to continue with my practice thanks to Adriene&#39;s 1000s of videos and I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll have something new to unite us again soon. Yesterday i was recommended by YouTube a video of Benji as a puppy when Adriene introduced him for the 1st time 6 years ago. What a treat!

"Just finished the Beginning. I am sitting here crying my eyes out. My first time doing the 30-day-challenge- I freaked out when I heard that there were no instructions today because I just could not trust myself to &quot;think about the poses&quot; without a voice guiding me. The first twenty minutes I almost cramped trying to be in sync with Adriene. And then I started breathing and focussed on what I want, what I need. I am an absolute beginner in yoga and as with every exercise I start I thought I needed precise and ongoing instruction. Today for the first time in my life I found out that I just have to listen to my body and to my mind- they show me what they want. And my breath guides me through. I still am amazed how this went. I don¬¥t think from now on I will just snap a finger and get in sync, but everytime I think I &quot;fail&quot; I can and will remember this half hour I was in sync with my body, my breath and myself.<br />Thank you, Adriene. Although I look forward to do more yoga WITH your voice guiding me, I now know I already have some tools to find peace and moments of calmness when I need them. The most important one: Breath. My breath is my anchor. My anchor is my breath.",Judith Sch√§fer,2021-01-31T10:07:04Z,1

"Thank you for this journey! It is so interesting, whenever I have followed these 30 days of yoga with you, I always get very anxious when we are at day 30. I have a very hard time not being guided when I dont know what im doing. It is very clear that I dont trust myself. Eventhough im all alone doing this, Im still afraid that I cant follow along, eventhough I have practiced yoga with you for almost 3 years now. So this time I thougt, just watched a bit of it, so you have an overview of what is going to happen, and that actually helped. Im so happy that I found my own way of dealing with this. I dont need to be uncomfortable, it is ok to know what works for me. And then maybe over time, I begin to trust myself in the unknow, and maybe not. For me it has been so so important to feel what works for me, and not make it a problem. And this journey of &quot;Find what works for you&quot; has helped me alot. Lots of love from Denmark. See you soon.",A z a d e h,2021-01-31T09:55:04Z,1

Always positive. encouraging, non judgemental with a sense of fun. In the same way I keep my TV switched off these days. It&#39;s on the shelf. It no longer serves.

"It may have been around September of 2015 when I first found your channel. I had wanted to learn yoga to help rehabilitate my body after a significant weight loss and to help kind of smooth everything out, because, at the time, I was working a largely sedentary job. I had no idea, then, that yoga would become such a huge part of my life. I practice daily, now, thanks to you. The time I spend on the mat helps bring a balance into my life, and helps mitigate the stress of working in Emergency Services. This was the first time you saved my life.<br /><br />Towards the end of November last year, you saved my life again. I had taken a fall after a practice (well, during, but the fall kind of cut that short), and had gone to the bathroom to get cleaned up, where I fell again, and hit my head on a radiator. I remember darkness, I remember cold, and I remember a tiny spark of... something, which came to me as the sound of your voice, telling me to listen to the sound of my breath. It was then I realized I wasn&#39;t breathing. If it wasn&#39;t for the memory of your voice... well... I may not be typing this. <br /><br />So proud of you, for being consistent, for sticking with it all through so many years, proud of the growth you&#39;ve made since squeaky old floor.<br /><br />Thank you, for everything &lt;3",Kevin Irizarry,2021-01-31T09:28:49Z,0

By adjusting here and there, missing out the chaturangas, going to knees, then downward dog, this senior yogi could carefully follow through. My side dips in forearm plank were non existent, but that didn‚Äôt matter. So proud to have made it to the end. I was expecting an hour but 51 minutes was just right for this mirroring sequence.

"This month has proved a real rollercoaster for the world and myself personally, with a mental burnout at the beginning of the month, resulting in me ending my relationship and moving from lockdown London back closer to my family in Sweden - showing up on the mat each morning has not only made me find a warm ground to rebuild myself from but it‚Äôs truly brought a whole new sense of purpose to my life. I am so extremely thankful for your work, Adriene, and I‚Äôm so humbled and honoured to be part of this incredible community. The tears that are rolling down my face after today‚Äôs yoga are tears of happiness!¬†<br />Thank you SO much Adriene, you‚Äôve truly enriched my life and I so look forward to continuing showing up on the mat each day.

"I&#39;m about to complete the final day my first ever full 30 days of yoga.... I cant believe I got here, I&#39;m so happy, I never thought I would make it üò≠ I tried last year but I found I was dealing with some serious negative self talk and having to argue with myself to keep going, here were lot of tears...needless to say it was exhausting and after 10 days I gave up. I havent attempted yoga again until this years, even though I&#39;ve wanted to every day. I cant believe how much I enjoyed this year... i have an aim now to complete a yoga session every day this year, however short. I will be moving on after this to last years 30 days as it kicked my butt last year and I want to try again, but after that I will wing it I suppose.

"Thank you! It has been a great 30 days! I loved this last practice too, but as I usually mainly listen to your voice, Adriene, I found it difficult to both do my own thing and let myself be inspired by your sequence. I would love to return to this sequence often and I am wondering if it would be possible to have optional minimal cues recorded voice-over with the music? Just &quot;chataranga to three legged dog, to warrior one, warrior two, triangle pose&quot; sort of thing.

"Every ending is indeed a new beginning. For me, BREATH has been a transition in difficult and happy moments at the same time. I finally decided to go back home for good last Christmas, after 9 years working in different places and struggling to just see my family from time to time. During January I had to get used to be back in a small town, away from all the friends from the last years, close to my family, but without the chance to be with them as much as I wanted to. It&#39;s been quite an unstable period but Adriene, Benji and all this beautiful community has helped me to stop, BREATH, connect, focus and start again. Thank all of you for making everyday unique and full of gratitude. This will be indeed a new start for me, having yoga as my companion for good and bad days. I do really hope to see (and read) some of you around for the next months in YWA or FWFG. <br /><br />Wish you all the best, Namaste.",Angela Santonja Climent,2021-01-31T09:05:39Z,0

Why? Pleas Adriene talk through the flow! If someone wants to make it just with music, they can put it sound off and choose another music! This is so frustrating!

I am not referring to the poses (though I have improved physically so, so much) but I am referring to the mindset.  <br /><br />Especially with &#39;Breath&#39;, I have realized that finally, I have stopped trying to figure out the poses and my body, but I started to observe, to feel, and to get involved with the practice in a higher sense. It really is hard to describe, yet you have been explaining it perfectly, everyday bit by bit. <br /><br />Therefore,  I want to say thank you, you have no idea how much this journey&#39;s meant to us in such a crazy time like this, where everything is changing drastically every second...<br /><br />And, I promise myself that when things get tough I WILL return to my breath and I will send you a silent &#39;Namaste&#39;!..<br /><br /><br />&lt;3",Defne N,2021-01-31T07:37:03Z,1

To practice live with thousands of people everyday has been an inexplicable experience, I feel as though I&#39;ve made so many friends and companions simply by recognising names in the comments day-to-day. This unity has kept me grounded, and my breath practice has brought me closer to something internally that I have never felt before. If you are reading this, I love you. Good luck, and have a great practice !",Esm√© Pathare,2021-01-31T06:06:10Z,88
