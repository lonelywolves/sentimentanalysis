"Welcome to BREATH, friends! <br />Remember that showing up is going to be the hardest and most challenging aspect of this journey. So today, commit to it, write it down, say it out loud. “I choose to show up on my mat for the next 30 Days. I can and I will.”<br /><br />Let me know where you&#39;re practicing from!",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-01T13:20:56Z,2022

"I turned 65 today and I believe in letting people know what an impact they have had on my life. Without you, I can&#39;t imagine where I&#39;d be. Last year i had nerve pain shooting down my spine all the way to my toes. I worked that out with your yoga programs. (I have scoliosis and osteoarthritis.) We worked together every day and I have gotten so strong and proud. Two days with young grandchildren wore me out, but not my back! My bingo wings are gone.

I’m so excited!! It totally slipped my mind that with the new year brings another 30 day journey! It’s been months since I’ve practiced &amp; I felt the call for another challenge to bring me back.. I came on the channel to sift through old ones &amp; low and behold there’s the perfect one waiting! <br /><br />I’ve been struggling with my breath lately. Often breathing into my chest 😕 even when I think I’m breathing deeply into my belly. I have to be super intentional to get that good belly breath. <br />It’s been two and a half months since I’ve started CrossFit &amp; translating my breath work over has been a real struggle! I hope this helps. <br /><br />I thank the divine and I thank you Adriene for your consistency! ✨ <br /><br />Wholeness &amp; Love Always!💕,Nena Netero,2021-03-31T13:34:25Z,0

"Hey Sahana, losing weight and getting healthy is a good goal :) doing regular workouts (yoga or other work out tutorials are great for that) and eating more balanced can help with that goal. Just don&#39;t pressure and starve yourself! Go in for long time and not fast results. And work on your mental health (yoga and meditation is great for that!). Hope that helps and I know these are hard times and changing your routine while living at home with parents is hard, but I believe in you! :)",Lou TheGremlin,2021-03-01T12:14:36Z,1

"Hey guys I have a question for you all. I’m thinking about giving the high intensity workouts a rest for a while as I keep hurting my lower back. I do yoga maybe once every few weeks but I’m thinking about doing it every day. For all you yogis does yoga help strengthen and tone the body as if you were using weights or doing high intensity workouts? I was thinking about for cardio riding my stationary bike in the morning and then doing yoga in the afternoons To keep a good balance of cardio and strength. someone told me that the reason I keep hurting my lower back is that maybe because my abs are not strong enough. They also said that yoga is very good in building core muscles is this true? All I know is things to Covid and losing my job I have had no motivation to really work out and the high intensity workouts, when I do go to do them they just seem to hurt me. Thanks for your help",angems083,2021-02-13T15:20:32Z,0

"Hi Noa. How is the programme working for you? I only started yesterday having completed Adriene’s ‘30 days of yoga’ programme. Showing up was definitely the challenge (like you, I find consistency difficult) but I did it and I feel truly transformed both physically and mentally. Something that really worked for me was putting my yoga mat by my bedside each night, and doing the session before I left my bedroom every morning... Good luck and enjoy the journey 💕",Lynne G,2021-02-28T07:38:24Z,1

"Hi Adriene<br /><br />Thank you for your videos!<br /><br />I&#39;ve just started your 30 day trial. You&#39;ve made Yoga accessible to me so thank you....<br /><br />But what do you mean by &quot;arrive&quot; at yoru breath and &quot;invite&quot;? <br />I&#39;m struggling to visualise how to do that.<br /><br />Also, apart form the plank, I find simply sitting up straight and keeping my head above my heart really difficult.<br />Is anyone else finding that... what do I do?",ant2100,2021-02-01T23:19:12Z,0

They always hung around when I did yoga. A lot of times my cat would sit on the either end of the mat. Miss them both so much.

"I have followed you for so many years now, Adriene, and really want to say THANK YOU for all the great work you do!<br /><br />The Adidas thing is starting to really get to me though......possibly because - if I&#39;m not mistaken - this is the first time that the Adidas logo has been visible throughout the entire video. It looks like they&#39;re beginning to own you.<br />Is Adidas really how you identify? I&#39;m not talking about the aesthetic only (although it feels so off for you), but more importantly the myriad ethical doubts surrounding Adidas.<br />Just wondering if you&#39;ve signed some exclusivity contract with them for way too long......and, if you have maybe you also have an NDA restricting you from speaking openly and clearly on this matter.<br />I hope if that&#39;s the case that you&#39;re on the tail end of both things (contract &amp; NDA).<br />You don&#39;t have to answer these questions, and I guess you may not even be (legally) able to, and that&#39;s fine.<br />Please don&#39;t feel criticised here. That&#39;s really really not my intention. I admire both you and the work you do very greatly, and I totally understand that sponsorship is necessary in order to continue to provide it. I just hope that you can find good sponsorship from a brand more aligned with the values that (I understand) you to represent.

With that being said, I took part in yoga years ago and find that I am thoroughly enjoying yoga again with Adriene due to her high level of skill mixed with an engaging personality. I signed up for this 30 day journey but started Day 1 two days late... Any thoughts on how to go forward?

Humble yourselves in the sight of God and he shall lift you up. <br /><br />The apostles of Jesus Christ preached the way of salvation the day the New Testament began saying “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This promise is to you and to your children and as many as the Lord my God shall call. No man cometh unto the Father but by Jesus Christ and as many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and those that are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God.

Ok so I was planning on not doing the Yoga Journey this year as I have been following a different yoga program in the last few months and I was pretty eager to get working on my handstand practice... More focus on the physical ability. But I thought I would just check out what this year&#39;s journey was about. When I watched the intro and first video I knew it was just what I need right now. Breath to ground us into our reset year! Slow down and ground. I can always get back to the physical focus next month... But right now I feel like I need grounding to bring me into this new year and after the shit storm of 2020. Thank you for all that you do for your community! You sure have created something wonderful! 💖,Kaley Wilcox,2021-01-02T15:41:55Z,0

"Hello! In &quot;the before time,&quot; I practiced yoga 3x/week at a hot yoga studio and was a mess if I went more than a few days in between. Then the pandemic hit, and I started doing yoga at home with the classes my studio live streamed. But, it just wasn&#39;t the same for so many reasons, and my practice frequency, duration, and intensity dropped--and dropped some more. I knew about YWA, but was really committed to using the videos from my studio with my familiar teachers. Well, they had to stop live streaming videos because they ran out of money and had to go dormant until after the pandemic passes. So, I turned to YWA and have really loved both Adriene&#39;s personal style and warmth as well as the ability to find a video to meet any and all of my random, &quot;I wonder if she has one for ____&quot; searches. The most recent: Yoga after a long trip. Bingo! Thanks, Adriene, for being there for all of us. I am a little doubtful I will be able to practice every single day of the 30-day journey, but I am committed to trying. I can and will do this! :) Happy 2021, all!! Let&#39;s do this!

"The hardest part is showing up. It’s so true and some days it feels impossible. But I am always grateful for the calendars because I know I am practicing with a large community and there are many struggling with me. I’ve assumed for many years that I was asthmatic, but last year I finally found a PT who believed me when I said I have chronic and severe back pain and she helped me discover that my pain has affected my core muscles and therefore my ability to breathe easy. My intention is to build a stronger core, cultivate a deeper breath, and make peace with my mind and body. Happy new year from Alabama!",Robin Helser,2021-01-01T23:38:35Z,1

"I don&#39;t even know what to say, Adriene. That intro hit deep and I had a few tears streaming down my face as you were inviting the coming 30 days. I found your channel last year and it has played a big part in trying to instill healthy habits and routines in my life, though I often fall off. But I&#39;ve always enjoyed your sessions as they make me smile and laugh and also reflect. I think its when you mentioned the showing up is the hardest part is when something tipped over within me and the water gates flooded. I struggle a lot in the day to day, just with a will to live and a purpose. Its my greatest desire to find it. My username is Achieve Peace because that is my main goal in life. I want to thank you for your compassion and sharing your knowledge. I look forward to focusing on and practicing my breath these coming 30 days &amp; will do my best to connect with this feeling when I don&#39;t want to get on the mat as its a great reminder as to why I should.. This feeling is love and support. I truly feel you have love and want the best for your viewers and as someone who lacks a support system, it truly means the world to me.

"How a little bit of breathing already made me cry. I don&#39;t know why but at the same time I do. So many ambitious goals that were once dreams but I don&#39;t want to call them dreams anymore, so much change to come and so much I am not happy about at the moment but at the same time am. I can&#39;t organize my thoughts, which clearly makes me very emotional. Third year I&#39;m doing this, though I never did the whole journey the first two years. I am doing this time though. I am going to commit to this thing and I&#39;m excited for tomorrow, probably making me cry again. Your Yoga videos just open something up in me in the best way possible, I feel at home with them, safe and myself, like I can achieve anything I put my mind to. Might sound silly because it is just Yoga (and on some days it is simply that, just a Yoga practice) but it&#39;s often so much more. Thank you Adriene",Greenleaf,2021-01-01T20:12:59Z,0

"Listen to this, the most important thing you&#39;ll ever read.  <br />If you die today will you go to heaven? Have you ever lied, stolen, used God&#39;s name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God&#39;s law, you&#39;re guilty, your headed for hell, ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out for you, God&#39;s son Jesus died paying for your sin.  God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16  <br />God is warning the world. End Time prophesies are jumping off the pages of the Bible, plagues, violence, scoffers, government control, earthquakes, fires, floods, people will be lovers of themselves, money, lovers of pleasure rather than God, evil will be called good and good called evil, sexual immorality, rampant adultery, fornication, abuse... the ultimate in child abuse mommies killing their babies in selfish child sacrifice (abortion), World leaders are prepping for a One-World order, government, religion (please don’t take a number on your forehead or right hand, read Revelation a number means no heaven, and there&#39;s only one alternative) The government is also prepping to have you believe that UFO&#39;s are real... Soon the believers in Christ/Christians will be taken up, away with God, then antichrist will come and fix everything, everyone will love him, he will deceive many... then the tribulation will start, life on earth will be horrific. Today if you hear God whispering to your heart please respond before it&#39;s too late. Say a humble prayer, pour your heart out to God, receive Jesus as your savior, believe God raised Jesus from the dead, and repent of your sins, you are now saved by grace!

I tried to commit last year but I wasn&#39;t well enough and had to stop. This year my intention is to find what feels good within the 30 days of Yoga. I&#39;ll allow myself to not show up or do another, slower yoga practice or meditation instead if I&#39;m not well enough. If there are other spoonies out there - I feel you. Find what feels good for you these 30 days, even if it&#39;s 2 days of Yoga and 28 days of rest ❤️",S. D.,2021-01-01T19:35:11Z,0

"Hi, I never leave any comments under any videos except for some movie trailers or teasers. However as I intent to complete these 30 days of yoga (so not confident enough that I will be able to), I just wanna say hi to all of you. I have used Adriene&#39;s practices for about 2 years now, on and off. Breath focused practices after Covid (bad, bad, bad thing, don&#39;t do Covid, just don&#39;t, haha) in October will be awesome for my lungs and body, I guess :) cheers and happy new year from the heart of Russia.",Aleksandra Alekseeva,2021-01-01T19:22:43Z,14

I’ve had problems with my back since a rollover accident in 2011. But the reinjury took me away from my practice. I want to use yoga as part of my physical therapy and to fill my diet with anti inflammatory food. <br /><br />I am launching my own website and YouTube channel in March to document my recovery and to lend some love to others who suffer from chronic pain. <br /><br />Thank you, Adrienne for the years of free material and a sound practice.

"Joining from South Africa! Fell in love with yoga when I joined the Home journey. I was looking for a way to exercise from home (pre-covid lockdown) because it was too painful to go to the gym where my ex-husband was.. Painful, as I&#39;m still hoping for reconciliation and keeping a soft heart is so hard in the face of rejection. And what I gained from YWA has been so much more than exercise—I learnt how to better love myself and others. So thank you, Adriene ❤️",Linda van der Vyver,2021-01-01T19:08:09Z,0

I set up in the back of the class so I wouldn&#39;t disturb the other attendees.

It was exactly where I needed to be that day and I am still grateful for her flexibility and grace.

"Its my birthday today 🎂 happy new year everyone 🍀 I&#39;ve been doing yoga for over 2 years now. I started efter a nervous breakdown and I was never seeing myself doing yoga. But it has been a game changer. I relax with adriene, I heal with adriene, I stretch with adriene and I see myself  evolving but also accepting where I&#39;m at today. I would never have thought I would be doing a tree or crow pose. But I&#39;m be able to now.

"So excited to be jumping into this next thirty day challenge. I&#39;ve done them all, since the beginning, and have practiced them from different locations almost every year. This year, I&#39;m tuning in from Baltimore, Maryland, from the house I grew up in, the only house I knew until I turned 18, moved away, and started adventuring. Now I&#39;m circling back to my hometown, the house my mother has owned for thirty-six years, the house she will (if all goes according to plan) be selling at the end of this new year as she turns 70, retires, and moves back to HER hometown of Syracuse, New York. My last year in my old home. A perfect place to breathe. Thank you for helping me start my new years off right for so many years in a row, Adriene. I&#39;m tuning in because of the deliciousness I&#39;ve found in previous years: the love, the discoveries, the health. Ready to find what feels good with all of you beautiful souls!

"About 4 years ago, yoga was one of my favorite things to practice. It challenged me and pushed me towards loving my body and finding peace where I could. These last few years, Ive fallen out of that practice and my body is now in a state where I struggle with table top. I stopped doing yoga because I was so hard on myself every time I stepped on the mat... completely going against the purpose of yoga. When you said, “forget all that you know about yoga”, I teared up and it felt like a weight lifted off of my shoulders. I am going into this practice with breath and liberation.

"I am looking forward to starting afresh. Yoga is self-care for me. Yoga helps me to keep my muscles from getting stiff. Yoga helps me to pause amongst my daily chores and focus on my body. Today, you said put your hands together in prayer. To whom? Everyone has someone/something they worship so I guess everyone can fill in that answer differently. For me, instead of saying Namaste, I will whisper &quot;May God Bless You&quot;. I believe Christians can do Yoga too (not all believe that) by focusing on their Creator. The Mountain Pose is perfect for worship. So, thank you for offering a platform where everyone can come, regardless of race, colour or belief system.

"I, like many of you, am SO looking forward to this 30 day yoga journey. I have been virtually hangin with Adrienne since 2015, and though I’ve said it before I feel the need to say it again - thank you for this gift you give to all of us so freely and humbly.  It is not only the way you carefully craft each practice with modifications for every skill level or body type, or the way you gently remind us that “we’ve gotta bring the breath”. It is not only your charisma and warmth and humor that make it so easy to return to the mat (okay maybe not always easy, but once we’re there we remember why). It is not only your teachings on self love and compassion, which remind us to find love and pride in who we are right now, in a world that is so quick to tell us otherwise. It is not only the way you gracefully roll with Mis-saying or mis-steps, or groans from your “breathing bolster” Benji, reminding us that no one is perfect and that there is a humanness, a beauty in imperfection. It is also the community you have woven together, with people all over the world from all walks of life who all share the same desire and pull to practice together. This is perhaps the most beautiful thing you and your channel offer. In a time where in-person gathering  is unavailable, when so many are feeling isolated in a time where we need community most. Thank you for creating a safe, welcoming space for us all to gather virtually 🙏🏻 namaste to all and may 2021 bring more light, more peace, more love, more unity for all. ❤️",shannon mallory,2021-01-01T14:31:48Z,2

"Yes! I’m in. I tried your challenge before, but never got to the end of it. This time, I feel like I’m ready for it. It’s going to be challenging not to compare myself with others, to stay true and to keep showing up, but I choose to commit and to show up. I can and I will. I am worthy of it. We are all worthy of this time for ourselves. Thank you Adriene for this wonderful gift.",Vera,2021-01-01T14:24:04Z,0

"If cross legged position is not doable for you, you can use blankets, blocks, or pillows to sit up on. You can also sit on a chair, or on the edge of your couch when we take this shape. That is a great way to modify and possibly a better spot for you to tune in, work with the breath technique, and warm up before we get moving into other shapes each day.",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-01T15:45:04Z,0

"Joining you all from The Netherlands! A friend of mine once told me &#39;When you don&#39;t want to do yoga, that&#39;s perhaps when you need it the most&#39; and that really resonated with me. Showing up is indeed the hardest part, and I fully intend to do that every day for the next 30 days. Even if I spend most of the video in child&#39;s pose, I will have shown up and taken that time for myself, and I am worth that.",Suzan Elise,2021-01-01T13:53:33Z,7

"Dear Adrien I just started more than month ago YWA 2015 in the hope that my back pain will go away. Your classes are really great at inspiration and I feel I can do better with you. I will do yoga 2020 and yoga 2021 simultaneously and hope for better.  Im having ulcer colitis which is probably the reason of my back pain. Thanks a lot, you are very nice person.

"why are you here... what holds you here. these were so clear questions.<br /><br />Yoga makes me happy, i&#39;m here to (find a) flow and find stilness in my mind, or.. strive to accept it isn&#39;t. Im&#39; here to break chains of thoughts that do no longer serve and to find inner peace when possible. I want to be me unapoli... can&#39;t spell the word. I want to acces the strength in me, that energy that&#39;s always there but for some reason often out of my reach.<br />AND I WANNA DO SOME COOL ASS YOGA POSES,... and maybe, just maybe  i&#39;ll be in touch with my needs, and then improvise, find my flow &lt;3<br /><br />Reality: probably going to be angry for not beig able to follow or going to fast. Might get frustrated at you adriene, nothing personal. I&#39;ll probably do more effort than what&#39;s necessary (ty hard instead of easy). I&#39;m very often going to ask myself if i&#39;m doing it right, and question every inch² of my body. &quot;is my back straight this way?&quot; &quot;is my head at the right angle?&quot; &quot;shoudln&#39;t i be doing this to achieve that?&quot; &quot;am i breathing deep enough?&quot; &quot;am i doing this pose right to get it&#39;s benefits?&quot; &quot;is my energy flowing when ...&quot;<br /><br />What holds me here?<br /><br />There is something about yoga. When i move and follow that flow, it feels so liberating. I honestly don&#39;t get it. it&#39;s very very weird to me just because there is so much that i havent learnt yet, and that i don&#39;t not know. i just love connecting with myself. And i sometimes succeed when doing yoga. Yoga learns me so much about my mind and my own energy, i can use what i learn in yoga in other parts of my life.<br />My curiosity holds me here, my will to move forward and discover inner peace, happiness, the present. But honestly also expectations of succes. Sometimes yoga becomes a tool and that&#39;s weird, i&#39;m going to try and find balance in that. I sometimes try to use yoga to change how i feel... but that&#39;s not really connecting with yourself.<br /><br />Thank you Adriene for spreading this craft &lt;3 i&#39;m looking forward to the creaky floor, tha AYOO&#39;s, the allusions you&#39;re going to make, the references that i sometimes don&#39;t understand.",HeWhoMustNotBeNamed,2021-01-01T12:44:33Z,0

(7hrs ahead of Texas) I moved here in 2011 from Austin, (Actually Buda) Texas. I&#39;m 59 yrs old and I&#39;ve been bodybuilding since age 12. Started yoga with you on Nov 2nd when the gyms here closed due to Covid. Just recently finished the 30 days of Yoga with Adriene and I&#39;m proud to say I noticed improvement from it. Very much looking forward to combining Yoga with my weight training when the gyms re-open.

Keep up the good work and know that you&#39;re helping people around the world. Namaste.",Ken Thomas,2021-01-01T11:55:40Z,0

"Thank you, Adriene, for all your training over last year. You have helped me keep going and stopped me going back into my shell. Your training also helped me regain some lost memories after I lost them due to a mental break down a number of years ago. I can&#39;t wait to see if you help me find more.<br /><br />It has been a hard year for us teachers, doctors, nurses, police, paramedics and supermarket staff and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to get any better for us for some time. Thank you all for everything you are doing for us. This is going to be a lifesaver for me, I am so looking forward to this new 30 days.

"Just did a yoga session and a flash of insight came up inside of me which was quite profound. It said something that the magic of this community isn&#39;t necessarily Adrienne herself as a separate individual and that she&#39;s some sort of authority in relation to her students, but the magic comes from the whole community and everyone&#39;s relationship to the practice.<br /><br />I find that in fitness and wellness circles in general, there is a tendency that you want to find a certain person to be inspired by, some guru to &quot;believe in&quot; or some authority who you should be like. In this community, there is a totally different vibe. Here, everyone is themselves their most important guru and their biggest inspiration. Adrienne is more an intention-setter and a messenger of these techniques, but the true difference comes from every single individual who is practicing.<br /><br />It brought me a great sense of enthusiasm and hope for the future and what&#39;s possible if people get this.<br /><br />Happy new year everyone!",Christian Lindström,2021-01-01T10:51:10Z,0

"Hi Sharon. I think Adriene usually suggests the morning, as a way to start off your day and set your intentions/mindset. (That has also meant that I have time to hop on the mat later if I forgot or life gets in the way.) But the most important thing of all is that we show up for ourselves, whether that&#39;s at the time or the day we originally intentioned or not 😊. Really looking forward to going on this journey with you! Have a lovely New Year 😁.",Nicky Watkins,2021-01-01T11:27:45Z,2

"Yes indeed to wrist issues! I have no left hand, and I got around that with yoga blocks, but I have a lot of wrist problems in my right wrist as it&#39;s my only one. I got to 99 days straight of yoga last year and absolutely loved it so much, but was stopped by a surprise urgent Thyroidectomy! Now my wrist problems are almost completely stopping me from using my hand at all during yoga. Do you use anything to ease your wrists? I have a yoga glove with a silicone wedge and without that I wouldn&#39;t ever have been able to use my wrist during yoga. They&#39;re amazing and well worth it. It&#39;s hard sometimes not being able to complete days in these challenges, or just normally when practising with any video, but I try and still show up, and mix it up with some hands-free stuff or use forearms where possible and join back in when the bit that I can&#39;t do has finished. It&#39;s not competing no, and even just rolling out our mat or whatever and taking five minutes to sit and breathe is enough. And if we miss a day, or a week, well so what?! The intention is there, and that&#39;s more than enough 💚",Carensa Semmens,2021-01-01T13:39:09Z,0

I’ve done several of the 30 day workouts and am pleased to be starting this one with so many other yogis around the world, and of course, with Adrienne and Benji.

"I have been doing yoga for 6 months now. I was feeling bad in my body, from all the chronic pain I have. And my mind was drifting into panic mode. I thought that maybe yoga could help and I started to look for some videos. And then I found one of the old 30 days with Adriene and it was perfect! Since then I have done all the old 30 days, just ended the 2020 &#39;HOME&#39; yesterday. And now for the first time I am doing this together with you! I have found the perfect yoga practice for myself and it is all thanks to Adriene. Sending love from Finland! ❤",Alisa Salonen,2021-01-01T10:09:41Z,0

I practiced daily for 4 months straight before covid19 got too much.  Picked it up again in December and now intend to keep it going for 2021. One day at a time and with hope for the future while enjoying the present. Thank you Adriene and team for this wonderful gift :).

"I started practicing yoga at the end of 2019, as I was recovering from a running injury - I always thought that it was not the kind of activity I needed, as I&#39;m too energetic and find it difficult to just stay and be. But. During the first Italian lockdown in spring, a friend of mine suggested that I tried Adriene&#39;s practice - and it was exactly what I needed. I&#39;ve been practicing almost every day since then, and it&#39;s becoming more and more of a natural part of my good habits. <br />This Breathe journey is a step further, a chance to start every day giving myself permission to really take space to listen to my natural rhythm, to go back to my center and to intentionally choose from there. Thanks for sharing this journey with us! Laura, Milan - Italy",Laura Cerioli,2021-01-01T10:05:31Z,0

"Good morning! Happy new year everyone ❤ This is my second attempt at a YWA 30 day new year challenge, last year I ended up stopping half way through as I was getting incredibly emotional throughout the sessions, i would often end up crying and it was too much the time. This year I&#39;m sure it will bring things up again, but I&#39;m determined and hopeful I can work through them as they come up. After the last year the world has had, I feel like now is the time to push through the uncomfortable and start building for something better.

"In Wellington New Zealand! Adriene, I&#39;m a cynical person so I&#39;ve been quick to dismiss any health and wellness thing as a fad in the past, but when I found your channel I was disarmed. Knowing I have your videos for when everything&#39;s falling down or just when I&#39;m regular degular bored is such a relief, you have no idea. Knowing that just turning up consistently is teaching me, the Grinch, to accept myself is insane! I use YWA alongside my trauma work to begin to get to know myself, finally! I feel the world opening up when I turn on YWA. You are a role model for me, and good role models are in short supply.",Kirstin C,2021-01-01T06:16:43Z,2

"One year ago tomorrow, I started your 2020 30-day challenge. I know you get this a lot, but I just wanted to tell you how much yoga and your teachings saved my life. I had been suffering from chronic back pain from a childhood injury for years. I was only 30 and had days when I was afraid I wouldn&#39;t be able to get out of bed. Over the past year, yoga has healed my body so much—physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. I look forward to continuing the journey. Thank you so much for being the guide. Namaste ❤️🧘🏼‍♀️",Madison Lux,2021-01-01T00:44:28Z,738
"@Michelle Dunstan my son has AS &amp; I wish I could get him to try yoga too. Maybe I’ll show him your comment to see if he’s willing to try it. But his neck is so stiff &amp; won’t turn.<br /><br />As for my set, how can I sit on the floor without crossing my legs Indian style? My knees don’t bend entirely due to a vehicle accident &amp; I want to work on getting that movement back. Any suggestions are welcome from everyone.🧘🏾‍♀️🥰",Ella,2021-01-31T14:48:24Z,0
"@Michelle Dunstan Thanks for connecting! Today&#39;s practice was challenging for me as I seem to be in a bit of a flare with shoulder, hip, lumbar and ankle pain -but it was gentle, and good to LISTEN ;) and I made it thru, feeling better after!!!
