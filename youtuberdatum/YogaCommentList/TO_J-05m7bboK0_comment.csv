Will be doing this for now on, i can&#39;t wait to see how far I come in the next month, year, decade!

"Hi Adriene, I adore you &amp; often during practice wander off in my mind, dreaming of our future happy life together. Unfortunately I&#39;m not a particularly great catch. I&#39;m an old fart who foolishly tends to over exert himself by lifting heavy stuff - which brought me to this video. What a brilliant addition to your output on Back Love -- simple, basic and extremely rewarding, especially for existing pain. You must be so proud of all the great work you&#39;ve complied so far!¬†<br /><br />I was enjoying the stretches so much that I paused the video here and there for en extra couple of minutes, feeling the problem areas in my back, from hips to shoulders, and breathing into them. It felt great. I do have to be careful though, not to go for too long or take it too far - for example, I stayed cross legged for a while, enjoying the forward leaning stretch, not paying attention to my lower body, then experienced the pain coming out: cramped muscles &amp; hurting joints. I had to rest, stretch my legs out, point &amp; flex my feet, circle my ankles before I could switch to the other side. I then proceeded gingerly to the end of the video. Can&#39;t wait to try it again tomorrow. This one is a keeper!<br /><br />Thank you for your wonderful gift.<br /><br />Namaste",Yuval,2021-02-04T19:51:52Z,0

I woke up today and can&#39;t walk due to low back pain and this is my first time experiencing that. It must&#39;ve been all the work I&#39;m doing during my summer break. I decided to do the 15 mins yoga for lower back pain and take a rest. So this is my second yoga sesh for the day and alhamdulillah I feel so much better. I can walk better and bend better.

"Hi Adriene, I regularly practice yoga with your help. Thank you for all the videos. I have scoliosis, and I am 51 years. I would like more practices that would strengthen my back and stomach muscles. I don‚Äôt have back pain, only aches. I can‚Äôt do the half sit ups in which I turn and hold without injuring myself,  and balance poses are hard since my balance is off. I wondered if you could target these weaknesses without using the poses I mentioned.  I especially like downward dog and calf-cow. All of these have kept me pain free this long, but as I age I have noticed that my core is losing muscle seemingly overnight. My daughter also has scoliosis, and I know many others with this genetic problem. I think we could benefit greatly from specific yoga practices for us.

Thank you so much for this. I&#39;m 34 and after years of having a hyper-mobile lower back that I didn&#39;t support enough (I do ballet recreationally and didn&#39;t put enough focus on developing core muscles to support my arabesque etc) I threw my back out last year. Since then I have occasionally back-spasms and I have to be extra careful about how I stand and sleep. I hardly do anything to the back in ballet these days in an effort to not trigger the pain. This was extremely soothing and I feel like my spine is lined up better now. I&#39;ll be coming back to this one!,jankoraven,2020-12-27T23:14:17Z,0

I&#39;ve been back consistently since stumbling upon your channel several months ago. I never thought I&#39;d be that person who does youtube yoga videos, but here I am and loving it. <br /><br />It would be helpful to know how to alter movements when they require bended knees such as sitting crossed legged or sitting on heels such as what was done in this video - have bad knees. <br /><br />Thank you so much.",Gail W,2020-10-26T03:34:23Z,0

"Yoga, or more to the point, Adriene has been my saviour. That may sound dramatic to some people, but I&#39;m confident my fellow yogis can relate. Since having a hip injury back in June this year, I&#39;ve not been able to run. But I&#39;ve always stuck to yoga daily and thrown in the odd strength training here and there. Lately I&#39;ve been experiencing lower back pain and instead of going to an osteopath, I persevered with yoga and the discomfort has subsided dramatically üôå<br /><br />Not only has yoga helped my body in more ways than I EVER thought possible, but it is supporting my spiritual journey too. My mind feels calmer and there&#39;s less noise.

Beginning my day with your videos sets me up for a day where I feel more in control and attuned to myself and my surroundings.¬†I don&#39;t just feel like I am watching a yoga video, I feel like I am a part of a spiritual journey into body awareness and confidence.<br />I am a 25 year old Early Childhood Teacher (0-5 years) and I am constantly up and down with children. I injured my back pretty badly last year and after weekly physio sessions for a year, I began engaging with your videos again. Even though some of the poses in the video were similar to my physio stretches, I felt a million times better after your session than I did with any physio exercise.

"Hey Adrienne I stumbled on your channel as if it was a sign from God to help with the issues ive been having with my body. Before your yoga helped me I had an overextended left leg from putting my body in an extreme position and over a year I was walking this way. About a week ago I was able to essentially shift everything back into place specifically when I placed my right hip towards the left side of my mat and allowed my crossed legs to fall. I literally felt my spine and heard it go back to normal. Since then I have discovered on top of plantar fasciitis that my hips are EXTREMELY tight from years of poor posture and sway back due to plantars feet. Your practice and a posture corrector has really helped but I was wondering what would you recommend to seriously loosen my hips a lot more? I&#39;m unable to even get pass criss cross applesauce with my knees at a 35¬∞ angle. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0&amp;t=25m23s"">25:23</a> i couldn&#39;t even attempt the position without a small sting pain im my right knee, I&#39;m also knock-kneed and have been correcting it consciously for a few years. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0&amp;t=12m56s"">12:56</a> my body wasn&#39;t allowing me to perform the full stretch and had me sorta stuck at my gut half way reaching the stretch.

"Hello Dear Adriene! I recently retired, and started doing daily Yoga with you. My thirty-year -old daughter, Clare, started at the same time, and we try to stay in sync with each other. We both did 30 days of Yoga and 28 days of Yoga camp, then I hurt my sacroiliac, so I&#39;ve turned to gentle lower back videos. So great-all of them! Clare and I love them and love your sweet, gentle, friendly and humorous (isn&#39;t that the funny bone?) ways! We also love Benji, of course. BTW my sacroiliac is beginning to feel much better!<br /><br />The silver lining of Covid isolating is we begin to discover things we can do as an on-line community, and ways we can find that sense of community on the internet. I feel as if I&#39;ve found a new friend in you, and I know Clare feels the same way. You help build health bodies and spirits! Thank you!<br /><br />Russ in Tucson",Russ Healy,2020-07-17T00:01:39Z,0

Beautiful things are also happening during this time as well and I have much hope and even joy in certain moments.

"I&#39;ve been racking my brain on how to show my appreciation for your channel without being sentimental and cheesy, but I dont think there is a way to accomplish that goal. When I was 14 I was in a car accident with massive injuries including crushing my L2 vertebrae and multiple breaks in both femurs. Then two years ago my back started to fail me and no doctor would touch my back because of all the hardware. They decide to treat my pain instead of fixing my back. I lost everything from my back failing even was forced to quit my job. My days were full of numbing the pain with pain pills and drinking to battle the depression. Then watching the joe Rogan experience with ddp inspired me to try yoga. All respect to ddp and his product and what he is doing but I wasnt able to do his routines, which broke my spirits. I almost had given up until one fateful day in October I stumbled onto your video, yoga for beginners. What sets you a part for me is how you advise adjustment for every position, your tempo allows me to adjust myself so I can perform the position correctly before moving to the next, and how your routines are custom built to strengthen specific muscle instead of just full body routines. Since then your channel has been inserted into my daily routine. I went from not even being able to stand or sit straight up for more than hour at a time to as of yesterday jogging/walking for 3 miles. You&#39;ve help me regain my feeling of worth and the back strength to live life again. Thank you",The Creecher,2020-04-11T15:33:20Z,0

Bringing your knees to the chest as well as twisting the knees to the side is the worst thing you can do for back pain. Yes it feels good because it activates the stretch receptors and you get a little rush but long term it is very bad. Twisting and bending the spine isn&#39;t good for back pain.,Ryan Pugh,2020-02-18T17:39:02Z,0

"This one was so bittersweet for me. My senior kitty is getting ready to cross the rainbow bridge.

"13.02.2020. KISS Yoga. <br />I have been doing Yoga for sometime now mostly Sundays as my active rest day and squeezing a class here and there when I had time. Last year I decided to try the 30 day Yoga by Adriene daily. I loved it. I realised that I actually can make time for it. But I stopped there. The rest of the year was back to Sundays and a class here and there. This year I was ready for it coz I have realised I have become stronger, it shows alot when working out as a result of Yoga. I guess I even listened more. There&#39;s always a constant message from Adriene: gratitude   appreciating ourselves, spreading love, smiling...all positive stuff... I decided to take the message with me and am enjoying everything. I have learned to be grateful. What&#39;s even better I love myself more. I look at the mirror and I appreciate my body and who I am. Not always   I need to loose weight here, I need to do this...NOT ANYMORE. I appreciate this far I have come and look forward to where am going.

I am now doing this daily to reduce my back pain and to lead a healthy lifestyle. Thank you!,gopika b,2020-01-28T23:51:04Z,0

Hi Adriene! I just found your account. I&#39;ve only recently started doing yoga and have a very serious back injury. I decided to go look for yoga that might help relieve the pain before I go to bed. It so absolutely did. I subscribed 10 second into the video. I can truly feel your love and warm intent. I can&#39;t wait to do more yoga with you. Thank you so much.<br />üíúüíúüíú,Janine van der Berg,2020-01-27T22:49:12Z,0
I&#39;m practicing in Utah!  I&#39;ve been doing yoga at home since Oct. 1st.  Went to an intermediate yoga class and kept up and did great!

"The title suits the video so well! I don&#39;t know whether I&#39;m imagining it or not but it felt like you were giving us so much genuine love and care, only a billion times more; especially at the beginning with the &quot;hi, everyone&quot;. It made me feel so emotional on the inside. I did the poses/stretches ever so gently, moving slow &amp; protecting my body while taking deep, meaningful breaths. It changed my usual yoga practice in a much different way, somehow. I guess that&#39;s what it means not rushing anything, not wanting to be super active yet not focusing on your(self-) care. I used a pillow instead of a blanket which was a nice, comforting add. I loved discovering (experimenting!) new poses too",Sarah S.,2020-01-27T16:02:14Z,0

"Scotland. Thank you so much for your videos and sharing all that beautiful knowledge with us. 4 months ago, I was using crutches and was facing a life of knee, shoulder hip and back pain due to various lifelong conditions. I decided one day that enough was enough and something had to change.  I searched yoga for beginners and I found you, and myself in the process. Your teachings have changed my life Adriene and I cannot thank you enough. Gone are the crutches,  walking sticks and pills, they&#39;ve been replaced with a yoga mat and the gym. I begin every day with your lessons and I feel like a new man. I can even run and I was told that would never happen again.  I even needed help putting my shoes on, not anymore.

All the yoga vids I can find are geared toward lumbar pain which is not an issue for me, and a lot of the poses that are supposed to help release the lumbar muscles (e.g. supine goddess) are really compressive on the SI joints and don&#39;t feel good for me. I&#39;m sure there are a lot of women in particular out there, who think they have &quot;low back pain&quot; but actually have SI pain, who could really benefit from a video geared toward that!",Jennifer Pilon,2019-09-02T20:45:49Z,1

"Hi Adriene. I LOVE your yoga videos. You&#39;re so incredibly generous and gracious and always encouraging. I have a question. When you say breathe into your belly, but at the same time draw the navel in, I can&#39;t seem to figure out how to do that. When I breathe into my belly I expand the belly, which at this stage of the game for me does not to allow  me to keep my naval drawn in. I wonder if you have some advice for me.",Carolyn Gerber,2019-08-13T21:09:19Z,0

"Dear Adriene I used to do yoga with your channel daily and was also subscribed to FWFG. This past year I&#39;ve suffered a herniated disk and two operations. I stopped my studies (I&#39;m an opera singer) stopped doing yoga and have been having trouble returning to basic things like meditation. I&#39;ve been too scared of more injury that the only sport i&#39;ve started doing is swimming.This past week my back was hurting terribly, giving me anxiety and stopping me from doing basically anything. Today, after months of not being on your channel, I did this video and am feeling so much better. I missed you, Adriene, I&#39;ve missed connecting movement with breath, mind and body. I will try to continue doing yoga again, and would appreciate your recommendations for videos that are suitable for someone healing from back surgery.

"First of all, Adriene, thanks for your videos.  They introduced me to yoga and I am much healthier now after doing it for about a year.  I do have a question for Adriene or anyone.  In that position where we put our heels together in front of each other, when the right heel is in first, I get a sharp pain in my right knee that gets worse when I try to fold forward.  Any thoughts on whether I am maybe doing something wrong?  Or maybe my knee just has something funky going on.  Today I moved my heels out a little so my right knee wasn&#39;t completely bent and that seemed to help.  I just wanted to get some wisdom on this because it happens every time I try to do that one.",David Roberts,2019-06-23T14:38:15Z,0

"I&#39;ve really been rocking out the Empower series on FWFG and feeling so great about how I&#39;ve been working my body and noticing changes in what I can do. Two days ago, though, I attended a little health expo at my work and part of it was a weightlifting demo. I ended up obviously doing something wrong with the deadlifts because I completely destroyed my lower back - like, the worst lower back pain I&#39;ve ever had (and I used to have back pain quite often back when I first started building my practice). I was so upset about the pain, of course, but mostly that I got thrown off of the Empower series and have to wait until my back is healed. I&#39;ve done this video yesterday and today and it has helped so much. My back is getting so much better and I am so grateful. I feel good taking care of my injury in this way and it helps me be patient about getting back to Empower when I really feel ready.",bluecenterlightpop91,2019-06-09T23:27:24Z,0

"Hi Adriene! I absolutely love these videos and my girlfriend and I do them regularly. One thing I&#39;ve always wanted to ask - in some poses I find a certain muscle will start to spasm a little - more than just persistent tightness, there will be a point in the pose where it really seizes. An example might be getting into a forward fold. It seems the more I keep my back straight as I bend, the more my lower back muscles want to tense up. In the past I just ease off and try again another day, but it always makes me wonder what&#39;s going on. I&#39;m curious if the yoga perspective has anything say about experiencing sudden tensions like this? Thanks so much!",smwvogt,2019-05-22T01:57:06Z,0

"First off, I would like to thank you for making videos to help care for our bodies. I am a young adult whose neglected self-care for about 14+ years and overworked my body till its so stiff and tight. A good professor of mine gave me an idea to try yoga since I no longer play sports.<br />When I started with your beginner&#39;s playlist, I noticed how tight and painful each move was. Regardless, I took it slow and tried not to over due it. This is only day four and I&#39;ve begun to notice that I feel left tight after each session, especially my back. <br /><br />Secondly, I find that your guidance and explanation for each video easy, helpful, but most of all encouraging. I didn&#39;t think I could do many of these on my own or given up if it weren&#39;t for you.<br /><br />And lastly, I hope to continue getting better (since I decided to start caring for myself properly) with your help in each session. <br /><br />Thank you truly for these videos. üíúüíô",Trickzter -Esther,2019-05-20T19:13:02Z,1

"Adriene, as always thank you for the wonderful life changing support.  I have a stretching routine that I always start back up when my back is bad.  But then stop stretching when I feel better.  And of course, that is when I have more problems.  So I am going to try to incorporate your low back yoga once a week along with your stress less yogas, and try to stay with my stretching to see if I can keep my back healthy.

All these moves can be adapted for the chair.  Cat/Cow: slump and arch.  Boat pose: sit on the edge of the chair and lean back without resting on back. Seated forward bend:  spread knees and reach to the floor.  Can always stand and put a leg into the chair like for the stomach pose: Stand to side of the chair and put foot into the chair while holding the back of the chair.  Slowly turn foot on chair out and let the knee that is on the chair rotate in.,Stephanie Carter Kelley,2019-09-12T13:37:09Z,0

"Suffering from Sciatica since a week. I can barely bend over for the moment. And walking straight is a bit painful but gets better.<br />Your practice was perfect to move the lower back smoothly without stressing the nerve and the muscles.

"Am stuck on &quot;Greet the Day &quot; - YOGA with Adriene as my Sunday Yoga at the moment. This I did faithfully this morning before I went to work. As much as Sunday is my rest day this practice gives me that boost to face the Day. Coming back home and seeing this, I knew I&#39;d have to do it especially after sitting the whole day in the office. Am glad I did. I feel so great. Am sure I will sleep well too. My best pose was the one in sphinx position and one leg on a blanket. Keep it up Adriene. You&#39;re a life saver. Be blessed.

One of the more difficult practices to understand how to do what is being described.  The rocking up and down the spine is something that is completely out of my reach.

"Hi Adriene! This one was great for me today.¬†<br /><br /><b>**</b>  I have an idea I believe others might love. I know I would!  <b>**</b><br /><br />Briefly, I&#39;d like to begin with how this idea came to me (as I feel it helps support the idea itself!)<br /><br />I&#39;d aimed to do 30 days of yoga. I&#39;d tried this a few times before and kept failing and I was upset with myself for that, so this time I wanted to get it nailed down and I wanted to prove to myself I could do it. Challenges I could foresee that could lead to failure: I&#39;ve gotten a lot of migraines in life or sometimes am just super tired and wasn&#39;t sure how I&#39;d manage yoga on days like this but I sought for answers and then I got the idea to just do super gentle and short practices if those times happened, or even lie in Savasana if I had a super bad migraine. This plan helped me to finally succeed! I only had one headache day during the 30 days (today is day 32!) and it wasn&#39;t even very bad,  and I had a few times where I needed something short and gentle just due to my headspace or body needs at the time. For these, I sought out your bedtime yoga videos that were on the shorter side.<br /><br />A few show up when I do this search and so here is my idea that I believe others would love too: <br /><br />It would be amazing if there were simply more of these stretchy (even like this video here that was posted yesterday) on the ground, gentle practice videos in varying short lengths (7-8 minutes - 10-11-12 minutes - 14-15-16 minutes - 17-18-20 minutes - 22-24-26 minutes) so there could be a bigger selection of the varying length times for this type of yoga practice. These kinds of practices stand out easiest to me when they are labeled as bed-time yoga, as then I figure you really aren&#39;t going to have me doing planks or warrior poses, etc (which I do love as well for those times I love them, but def not for when I&#39;m just not feeling great for whatever reason that&#39;s the case). <br /><br />I then got this idea!!!!<br /><br />What if you did another 30 days of yoga series - but this could be 30 nights of yoga for bedtime! And everything in it could be of different lengths that aren&#39;t super long and they could be slow and gentle and stretchy - just for really calming down for bed for 30 nights straight! We could all practice a nightly routine for 30 days to calm us and center us and help us sleep better and then there&#39;d be all those night-time videos to add to the collection of clearly labeled super gentle yoga practices for times also when we don&#39;t feel our best but still wish to stay with our commitment to a daily practice. <br /><br />Anyway, it&#39;s just an idea and I don&#39;t know how challenging it is or isn&#39;t for you to plan and then execute a 30-day of yoga videoing spree. <br /><br />Thanks again for another lovely yoga practice in this video here!",Holly XO,2019-05-19T14:41:48Z,1

Absolutely can modify with straight knees in a wide leg forward bend.  The goal is to stretch the back with the hips in their end of range of motion.  Stiff hips can limit low back range of motion.,Stephanie Carter Kelley,2019-09-12T13:41:34Z,0

"This really hit the spot today. I do have a modification question. I have knee issues, and for the most part have learned to modify things pretty well, including sukhasana. But the sukhasana sequence here really does need your feet to come in that close and your knees to bend that tightly, which my bad knee just won&#39;t do. <br /><br /><br />I tried two variations: first with my legs in a very wide bound angle (knees at about 90 degrees, soles of the feet together) and second with legs straight(ish) in a seated forward fold. Both were more workable for the knees, but I&#39;m not sure either variation quite hit what you were aiming for with the back. Do you have any other recommendations for how to get the most out of this sequence when the knees just can&#39;t come in that tightly?",Diane Verrochi,2019-05-19T10:33:06Z,0

"I love Adriene&#39;s home practice yoga videos because she reminds us every time to honour our bodies and where we our on our life&#39;s journey, and that&#39;s what&#39;s yoga all about, unity with ourselves and others, because it is only when you honour yourself that you can honour other people, too. So, it&#39;s not &quot;pick your poison&quot;, but pick your path, &quot;find what feels good.&quot; Thank you so much, Adriene! Namaste!",ruzica1974,2019-05-19T06:09:26Z,0

"Truly magical. I&#39;ve got some really spirit draining lower back pain from all the electrical muscle stimulations I had to undergo this week in a physiotherapy session. Thank you Adriene for coming to our aid once again, doing it as gently as ever, and for promoting positivity and love in the middle of all this external chaos that we have no control over. We do, however, have control over our thoughts and what we feed our subconscious mind. That is why I love my Sunday yoga mornings that act as a gate way to tend to my deeper self and rewire my brain for a better life. Loved the core action in this one Adriene. Have a magical day everyone. Keep thriving. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-05-19T05:13:32Z,0
