"Hi Adriene.. Not sure if you ll see my message.. I am new to yoga.. Though I ve been following you in this quest of 30 days, I have just finished today&#39;s 16th day.. And my question is.. I am a bit stiff in my knees. I have problems with my left knee as well.. Though in this position.. I feel I my ankles are burning. I can&#39;t stand in this position for long.. Is it normal? Will the pain go? :( thank you so much for your lessons, much appreciated 🙏 lots of love!!",Paduret Claudia Sandra,2021-01-28T13:46:25Z,0
"Adrienne I LOVE only focusing on the breath and learning new techniques in breathing.<br /><br />I am currently reading “Breath” by James Nestor so this fits in perfectly.<br /><br />Honestly if you did an entire 30 day challenge with no yoga and only expelling your wisdom of breathing and breathing techniques I would do it.  <br /><br />Kria yoga I have read about but hard to find some very in depth info or real practice on YouTube. <br /><br />Love you and thank you so much.  I love your personality,  you glow.",Dan Salamone,2021-01-25T09:02:16Z,1
I&#39;m finally catching up today after a couple of hectic days when all I could  carve out for myself was just 10 minutes of yoga. Lovely practice to get back to BREATH. I feel groundead and ready for bed. Thank you Adriene &amp; Benji. ❤🙏🏻,solumego7,2021-01-21T03:53:35Z,0

"I did the 30 day challenge in January and have enjoyed a daily practice since then. Today I don’t feel so well and have had to spend the day in bed. But I wanted to do some gentle yoga and remembered the breathing exercises of this 30 day series. I just followed this one - still in bed - and  although still feeling strange (I think its a post vaccine thing), I feel clearer and brighter.

"I 100% did feel absolute stillness and just completely grounded,  like i was a little pin on the earth as it spins. after the 8 breath ratio. i found using the length and the core to control the breathe very useful in slowing down and having that as a focus. as if my tummy was letting air in and out of the bellows, or my lungs haha",Michael Roberts,2021-04-21T06:37:11Z,0

this day was the hardest yet. i didnt know how hard breathing would be? i cried like 4 times this video because my lungs cant expand while im sitting with posture. i think my stomach is too fat ? my upper abdomen and ribcage are so tight from sucking my stomach in since i was 10. i couldnt even get more than 5 seconds in and 5 seconds out before my upper abdomen hurt so bad from being stretched. todays the first day im not sure it can happen.,Melissa Barco,2021-03-31T14:41:21Z,0
everyone else in the comments is like “yay i finally found stillness” and today was the first day i felt like i couldnt find it. no truer name than ‘discipline’ bc i feel like i was reprimanded by my own body and mind :( hopefully in a better place tomorrow but i have little hope for my breathing,Melissa Barco,2021-03-31T14:45:32Z,0

"Hi Adriene, I&#39;m doing this whole series, today was &quot;my&quot; day 16. I&#39;ve done Ashtanga yoga for 3 years before this, but I can&#39;t seem to master the long breaths. I struggle to reach 5 counts, let alone longer than that. In this posture it feels like the space in my upper body for deep breathing is very limited for me.

Almost every time you asked us not to fidget I was fidgeting! lol. This practice was great though. At first I was sort of disappointed we weren&#39;t moving much but learned to accept and love giving my body a rest. I do notice improvement with my breathing! Thank you Adriene :),Emily Irene,2021-02-24T17:52:51Z,1

"Thank you Adriene for this lesson! I didn’t expect that we would have a session of mostly breathing but I loved it so much, and I realised how much I needed to slow down my breath. A few times during the session, I was thinking, “shouldn’t I be moving?” I caught myself there, and I realized the discomfort I felt from slowing down and being at ease! So I really loved this timely reminder to take things slowly, one step at a time 🥰 Also I just returned to this 30-day challenge after completing two weeks of it but falling sick for almost a month. I’ve arrived, not early or late, but right where I am 💓.",Qian Hui,2021-02-24T09:50:48Z,1

"This day was pretty hard for me! But not because of the breathing. I don&#39;t know why, but I could have comfortably breathed in and out for 10 seconds each, if I wanted to (Maybe because I&#39;ve been swimming for some years back in school, maybe because I am singing a lot and I need to have a sound breath control for this or maybe it has something to do with my naturally low pulse, idk), but sitting in the &quot;easy pose&quot; for such a long time was really difficult for me, even when I sat on two pillows. I guess I need to work more on my (lower) back strength and hip flexibility...",Maifly,2021-02-22T07:03:05Z,2

"Absolutely love your practice :)) It&#39;s incredible to return to these earlier videos after finishing the series and seeing the improvements, especially with the ratios :)<br />Do you have any tips for middle back pain after sitting in the seat for a while? Or is that just the back adjusting to the upright position? I&#39;m pretty sure its just a tense back from workouts but perhaps you still have a suggestion :))<br /><br />Also I&#39;d looove a video on the basics of yoga (e.g. ratios, belly breathing (especially &quot;breath of fire&quot;), reasons for using the breath, etc.).

(it&#39;s really not the best thing for trauma survivors imo), but this really worked for me because you introduced it well into this gentle journey we&#39;re on.

"Speaking of nerds, if you&#39;re like me and like to understand some of the physiology behind all of this, the extension of the exhale longer than the inhale helps to increase heart rate variability and improve vagal tone, which ultimately helps to activate the parasympathetic response, thus signalling your body to relax and regenerate.",Osa Natural,2021-01-23T05:25:59Z,0

I&#39;m always a bit slow. Last year I was 6 days behind this year only 4. Progress is progress but today I was dreading practicing thinking I&#39;m so sore and tired so it was great to know this was a day of the breath. But how much more challenging it is than the movement. Sometimes I still get stuck on holding poses and forgetting to breath. I have asthma so it is so hard to breath already but I managed to survive to 7 count with a bit of struggling the 8 count I tried but went as far as 6 count by the 2nd attempt. But I&#39;m happy I managed to get as far as I could wow. Thank you really going to this video again just to help control my breath.,MISS DEE,2021-01-22T04:03:13Z,1

My exhale was totally fine, I could stretch that out aaaaaaaall the way. <br /><br />But reading through the comments I&#39;ve seen a lot of people saying they needed to totally empty out the exhale to get the full inhale.

All my muscles are working hard, they&#39;re not used to stay still on my matt. (I usually do my meditation on the couch and my back is bend in comfort haha).

"So much growth in this practice!<br /><br />1) This is the longest I&#39;ve sat in meditative cross-legged! My mid back really doesn&#39;t tend to like that posture; I really appreciate the encouragement to lift hips as needed.<br /><br />2) Slowly learning how to make the cross-legged pose my own. I can&#39;t really tell without a mirror if I&#39;m aligned in head-heart-pelvis, so today I focused on making the posture comfortable. I also permitted myself to pause the video and take some long, luxurious breaths through a repeat of the side twists to soothe my mid-back.<br /><br />3) Speaking of the twist, &quot;inhale to expand&quot; is finally starting to make more sense! Especially the wide lateral breath...I can feel my spine slowly relax into the twist with each breath!<br /><br />4) Finally, counted breathing is near and dear to me, as someone with panic disorder who has counted many, many, many a breath. So this practice was comforting. I checked my heart rate on my smart watch during the 8/8 practice...it was at 60 bpm!",Lauren Smith,2021-01-20T04:47:57Z,0

"Man I was terrified for today. I’m two days behind the releases so I saw “discipline” and felt really anxious about opening this video, and then today I had a nearly top to bottom bad day, I was physically and emotionally exhausted, I was sad, angry, frustrated just this little ball of gross and I was so so so reluctant to come to the mat on a day that said discipline when I was just so ungodly tired of everything but I knew if I lost momentum it would take so long to get it back again so I showed up anyway. To prove to myself I could even if I was taking a seat while trying not to cry from exhaustion. And the absolute relief I felt doing breath work is remarkable, I nearly started crying again because it was like the universe knew I needed to do this two days late. If I had started this on the first I wouldn’t have had this on the day I needed it. So thanks Adriene, for your hard work and being exactly here exactly where and when I needed it. I’m still tired, I’m still not the happiest, but I’m so much better for sitting down for a while and breathing deep.",Samantha Kerger,2021-01-20T00:41:07Z,2

"Day 16:<br /><br />Today was interesting!  I was glad for a simple seated practice today (a bit of my spine has been a little twingy after the past couple of days, so it was nice to take it a little easy), but it was interesting to explore something I&#39;ve suspected, which is that my natural deep breaths are <i>way</i> slower than these practices seem to expect.  (I have swollen allergy sinuses eight to ten months out of the year, it&#39;s a miracle I can breathe through my nose at ALL).  This turned into a great practice in SPEEDING UP my breathing, figuring out how much air I could get in and then back out in only a 3-4 count.  How hard and intentional did my breathing have to be to really properly empty it out in only a count of five?  It was a good challenge.<br /><br />And now I and my dizzy lightheadedness are going to sit down for a while.",Clarity C,2021-01-19T17:00:49Z,0

"I just finished this practice, 2 days late but at least I did it! After the 6:7 breath ratio I felt really frustrated because I was so clumsy with it and couldn&#39;t control it. When she said &#39;notice how you feel&#39; I suddenly felt a wave of emotion and release and started crying. I didn&#39;t end up getting the 8:8 like some others in these comments (well done!) But I just wanted to write this comment to let anyone like me know that it&#39;s not necessarily all about DOING IT RIGHT immediately; the breath is our tool that subconsciously knows how we are feeling before we do and it is simply magical that we are able to use it to discover ourselves. If you didnt get it today, or a few days ago whenever you&#39;re doing this,just keep going,please 💗 the release will come and it feels so liberating in that moment.

"Guys, so many amazing things happened that I got to share:<br />- I was doing the ocean breath from the beginning but it wasn&#39;t until the last cycle that I truly FELT it going through my throat<br />- usually when I practice breathing the hardest part is exhaling, as I feel like I ran out of air before the counting ends. But this time it was the opposite! I felt like my lungs had no more room for air, and again, it wasn&#39;t until the last cycle that I was able to slow down the intake and reach the count of 8<br />- when it ended I felt so much love for myself that I put my head in my hands, then hugged myself 😂 lol. Glad I was alone, it was a little weird.<br /><br />Happy day 16!!!!",Marina Vieira Souza,2021-01-18T12:43:38Z,64

"ooohhhhhh so gooood!! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you! I must have been tuned in today as I came to the mat with my socks on! Got to work on my inhale, it was much harder to breath in for the longer counts than breathing out.....though also think I&#39;m probably not getting rid of all the old air, which would also help the inhale.

"I loved day 16 so yummy with the breath techique and give a bit rest to the body. I actually do yoga challenge every day but yesterday I was so so tired and slept early, a bit afraid of &quot;dicipline&quot; becuase this word is a bit strict for me and I think of doing asanas right and more focus on the physical side of yoga. But this is what I love love love with ywa is the balance, we need the ying and the yand and I wanna thank you so much Adriene for spreading this message. I think this year is the best for me so far, the focus of &quot;breath&quot; is just what I needed. Thank you again! Your amazing and to all of you yogis out there.

Not sure whether that&#39;s how it&#39;s supposed to be or I&#39;m just congested, but in any case it sounded much less like snoring and much more like a deliberate audible breath, so I&#39;ll take it.<br /><br />Thanks for the lesson, as always, Adriene.",Kerico,2021-01-18T08:13:44Z,0

"I found that using a slight restriction in the back of the throat such as in ujjayi/ &quot;ocean breath&quot; that Adriene taught us earlier in this journey came in super handy for extending the inhales and exhales!

Just wanted to comment to say I felt exactly the same. I felt so frustrated that I wasn&#39;t able to fulfil the long deep breaths and found this the most difficult practice in the series yet. But reading some of the comments here has reminded me that it&#39;s a process that may take a lot of time to develop.,A C,2021-02-08T19:22:50Z,2
"Hi! I have struggled with feeling anxious and &quot;bad&quot; when not able to take breaths that fill my lung capacity to 100%. I used to be a smoker and that anxious feeling was a huge turning point for me.<br /><br />(Below is some advice I found personally useful, but I don&#39;t know anything about your anxiety or panic attacks so I also don&#39;t want to overstep. You know yourself best!)<br /><br />However, now I am able to very comfortably take conscious breaths without &quot;bottoming out&quot; or &quot;filling out&quot; so to speak. What helped me personally was acknowledging and recognising that most of the time, I&#39;m never breathing &quot;fully&quot; in a sense of 100% lung capacity to 0%. In fact, trying to force that and sustain it actually makes me feel more ill. The only time I can take a &quot;full&quot; breath is if I concentrate on it and prepare (or yawning also does the trick hahaha). Ocean breath has also occasionally made me feel like I am taking larger and fuller breaths due to me having to put in more conscious effort to fill the same lung capacity I usually do.<br /><br />Sometimes I have down days and can&#39;t take a &quot;proper&quot; breath to save my life. Maybe try ocean breath if you haven&#39;t before! Or this just might not be your cup of tea, and that&#39;s perfectly fine! 💕💕",Anastasia Kalacheva,2021-02-05T20:06:14Z,0

"you showed up! don&#39;t feel defeated cause it&#39;s not easy!!! I felt that way at first to!! the way to do it is to slooooow down your breath.  inhale very little very slowly try doing that ocean breath she taught us awhile back and then exhale as slow as possible. it might take some time to practice strengthening the lungs but it will get easier with time and patience! just like any other yoga poses you may not get right away! don&#39;t feel discouraged xx<br />also i put my hand up to my nose to feel the air come out and it was veryyyy faint.  do this right now put your hand up to your nose and exhale fast and hard, now try again but exhale really slowly and the air from your nose isn&#39;t as harsh almost like it&#39;s not there (idk i cant explain it properly right now but hopefully that makes sense lol) that&#39;s basically the secret behind it i hope this helps",Jadyn Shaylee,2021-01-18T05:52:39Z,1

I just closed my eyes and focus on breathing, and its almost like all my distractions disappear and I’m being purely mindful of my breath and my body.

I&#39;m not sick, not anxious, not stressed but for some reason I can&#39;t seem to pull in deep breaths and this practice seriously helped.

"For anyone who may have struggled with this today: this type of thing is used by musicians as part of a thing called breathing gym. My college marching band would do breathing gym for 15 minutes every single day to build up breath control so we would be able to play calmly and smoothly while marching. It takes a lot of practice and, yes, discipline to really master. So if this was difficult, remember that this is just like a muscle - it must be built up carefully over time. You are far from alone in your struggles, and your breath control will only go up from here!",Avery Adventurous,2021-01-18T04:54:36Z,50

So with the ratio breathing: when it was 8:8 I wasn&#39;t sure I could do it even though I had been doing well with it so far before that. But I did it like a champ! 😃 Pleasant surprise!<br /><br />Did I have a moment of stillness that was exquisite when you did? The answer is most certainly yes! ❤️<br /><br />When you said try not to fidget it&#39;s like you were seeing me because that&#39;s exactly what I was doing. 😂 But I was able to stop right away with the reminder and experience stillness. <br /><br />Overall? Great practice! I am significantly glad that I&#39;m out of my chronic pain flare up today and am back on track with my other exercise.

"This practice reminds me of the exercises we&#39;d have in choir. Some tips that were helpful then and some might keep in mind for this practice: imagine a string coming straight from the top of your head, likes puppet, keeping your head, throat, and torso a nice straight path for the air to flow. Imagine your lungs like balloons, and fill them up starting from the bottom working up to the top.

I was so focused on the breath I didn&#39;t even feel the time fly by (not that I ever do). To be honest, I didn&#39;t make it to 8 while inhaling, I could only do it until 6, but Adriene comforted me by saying that it is advanced.

Then I was comfy to finish it out without issue and, at the end, I thought that the whole world needs to practice this.. right now..  Thank you for these gifts Adriene.

"2 thoughts:  When Bengie kept looking out of the window at a deer, I thought of Blue, our dear departed blue heeler who looked exactly like Bengie. He was a wild spirit and was fascinated by deer all his life.  When Blue was not more than about 6 months old and we were walking up a mountainous wooded trail, he ran off and came back with a living fawn in his mouth!  &quot;Blue!&quot; I said.  I took the unharmed fawn from Blue and we followed him/her back to her mother; then they ran off.  It was like a dream.<br />      I&#39;m glad Adrienne left the counting breath practice until now.  I think it&#39;s more advanced.  As I enter our medical center there&#39;s a sign with instructions for &quot;mountain breaths&quot;, with 5 seconds of inspiration, 7 seconds of exhalation with a 3 seconds of pause in between.  These intervals and this counting is too difficult for most people, at least the young patients I teach.  I&#39;m glad we had 15 sessions of breath training first.",David Gottsegen,2021-01-17T23:52:51Z,12

"Of the seven 30-day series since 2015 I am enjoying this one most of all (I love them all, by the way!) because it is quite literally taking most of us relatively amateur yogis into a realm of practice that is not at all about &quot;performance&quot; physically (as most of us in Western society are obsessed with) but is instead guiding us toward an inward journey of integration, letting go, and accepting all that is good, moving us toward healing and wellness.  The breath, the whole body, the sensations, the effort and the mind are all aligning.  Thank you, Adriene!  Please stay profound and quirky!  You are awesome!",David Woodward,2021-01-17T23:44:51Z,135

"Dear Adriene,<br />I&#39;m so incredibly grateful to you. This is the first time I&#39;m really sticking with your 30 day yoga journey, and at the same time I&#39;m trying to raise a border collie puppy I got on 9 January. I&#39;m learning patience, awareness and acceptance. When I&#39;m trying to get my puppy into a relaxed state of mind, I call it &quot;Benji practice&quot; :) I begin to see very surprising (at least for me) benefits of a daily practice: I am not so afraid to feel emotions (what a strange thing to say), and sometimes I&#39;m paying attention to transitions while trying to find a comfortable position on a couch :) Day by day I&#39;m more stable in high lunge, my toes turn more and more where I want them to in Warrior 1 and 2...I feel confident and proud in Warrior and Mountain pose, humbled and grateful in Childs&#39; pose...I FEEL now, I&#39;m more at ease with myself and - most importantly for me - I&#39;m slowly, veeeery slowly, allowing myself to be proud of how far I&#39;ve come, to accept and love myself truly. As I grew up in an abusive and dysfunctional family, I&#39;m so happy now to slowly uncover myself thanks to yoga and therapy. I will return to the mat the next 15 days and beyond.

"I’m a retired choir teacher. This breath ratio practice is reminiscent of choral breathing exercises, except we vocalize on the exhale. ❤️",Britt Dougall,2021-01-17T22:10:34Z,0
"When the breathing ratio  increased up to 5inhale and 6 exhale, I felt tightness and little painfulness in my lung area. I have asthma and do get anxious every moment so it  made me think maybe I have something wrong with my lung. Still I continued this breathing practice by thinking of discipline and felt suddenly release and freedom of breathing. I almost teared up because I felt so alive and I could only focus on my breathing without any frustration. I could count my breathing until the end and I feel very new and refresh now with so much joy. Thank you Adriene . I truly believe that you are an angel came down from heaven to heal peoples mind and body. Thank you",miha baeg,2021-01-17T22:09:29Z,0

I had a hard day today and had a panic attack at the grocery store.  Iw as needing this. Slow and breathe.  It felt beyond perfect.  2.  If you were in my apartment- you&#39;d smell yogi tea.

"I am learning so much about myself on this journey, it’s unbelievable. Thank you, Adriene, for choosing this topic, which may be one of the most difficult ones you could have chosen for me, and probably for many others, too. It is very emotional for me, which at first is so hard, but then becomes incredibly liberating.<br /><br />With Discipline as the theme for today, I dreaded a very hard workout... and of course, I put yoga until the very last minute. I’d have never expected this practice. It showed me that discipline can be many things, and that there may be room for me to reframe the concept of discipline in order to achieve a healthier relationship to it. Hey-ho, you never know what a good old YWA class may reveal to you! Sending lots of love to you, Adriene, and to the whole YWA community!<br /><br />Sweet day 16 CHECK!",E. P.,2021-01-17T21:08:44Z,0

"Oh, my.  I have been really lucky to have been able to complete every single one of these practices - usually I’m behind by one or two (or more) by the half-way point.  It has been such a sublime pleasure!  Adriene, I have practiced with you for a few years now.  During this morning’s practice, it occurred to me how we have had the pleasure to see you grow and learn - and the good fortune that you have been kind enough to bring us along with you.  Each January brings a new chapter, and so far this is my absolute favorite.  It’s hitting me just at the right time, when I feel the need to practice more wholistically.  And big unexpected bonus- my running is improving by leaps and bounds (pun intended)!  I have found that I hold my torso more vertically when I run, and that makes breathing way more comfortable, which makes running a bit more fun.  I know you have practices for runners (they are in my library) - but I never realized how much cobra and even baby cobra would strengthen my back to hold me in a better running position.  Gifts hidden all around!  Please keep that spark of curiosity for all of us.  Love you! [Apologies for the long message]. : )",Jacqueline Penrod,2021-01-17T20:57:37Z,0

"30 min of breathing was what I needed today. The past few weeks have been super overwhelming and emotional due to things in my life and my family changing a lot in a short time, and yesterday was especially hard. Coming into practice today, I wrapped myself in a blanket cloak, cried a little bit, and breathed with everyone here &lt;3<br /><br />Side note, these ratios were super challenging for me, probably for the opposite reason than most. As a classical singer, I’m used to drills breathing in on 1 or 2 and out on 8, 16, even 20. In singing, I’m trained to be able to take in lots of breath very quickly, so inhaling slowly was a good exercise. Even the first 3 was a struggle, and every one after that proved a further challenge, but a good one.",Autumn Riley,2021-01-17T20:46:25Z,0

"This one felt so good ! I was a little bit afraid when I saw that it was mostly breathe work, because usually I struggle a lot with taking long breathes, but this time I was really able to focus and calm my breath and my mind. Surprisingly, I was able to breathe slowly, and it feels so good ! <br />At the end of that session, I was so peaceful. It was actually a relief to feel that I was able to really letting go, and find that peace of mind. I released so much tensions, and felt so connected with my breath and myself.

"I always expect the more physically active practices to be more difficult... but I think this breathing practice was one of the most difficult practices yet - and I&#39;ve been with Adriene for a few months now! It can be challenging for people with anxiety and racing thoughts to focus on breathing without the mind wandering. This was very calming for me, and I hope that I can learn to better my breathing practice! For those dealing with those things, you&#39;ve got this - allow yourself to breathe. :)",Katelyn G,2021-01-17T20:16:09Z,65

"Had an unexpected moment of sadness and melancholy at the beginning of today&#39;s practice, when I realized we have less than half of this year&#39;s journey left. Focusing on my breath throughout the session shifted that emotion into a profound gratitude - for Adriene, this community, and this time. With each breath, a new arrival. Appreciating each moment as it comes, and having the courage to then let it go. It&#39;s strange to already feel nostalgic for this series while in the midst of it, but I guess that just signals how important it has become to me.

"I love that this practice turned the idea of &quot;discipline&quot; totally on its head - I feel like when a lot of us hear that word, we think of holding planks and warriors and other power poses and pushing ourselves. (I was certainly confused to see &quot;Discipline&quot; along with a be-socked, hair-down Adriene, which usually means a gentler practice.) But of course, the practice that requires the most discipline of mind and body is simply sitting down with your breath.

I didn’t think I would be able to do the 8:8 ratio of breathing and yet, I did! <br />Interesting thought: when we exhale, we exhale particles of ourselves into the atmosphere.

My daughter introduced me to your 30 day journeys a couple of years ago and I have done yoga ever since. Thank you. My breath has gotten so much better as I am able to inhale and exhale for so much longer. Thank you for helping me quiet my “old mind” that couldn’t quiet down for yoga and giving me a new and improved me! Still can’t run and breathe through my nose though!🤣,Ann P,2021-01-17T19:01:50Z,0

I don’t know if it was some repressed emotion like stress or it was because of relaxation. Anyway I will keep on with this journey to the end, I’m very excited to discover my emotions and what causes them. Also does this happen often?

I was in a particularly bad mood when I started this practice today. The first breath cycle had me feeling like an old air mattress. But I stuck with it and it really did improve my general sense of well being-- the movement felt less air mattress and more blossoming flower.

"Feeling sublimely chilled after that. 😎<br />This is completely beside the point, but I&#39;m really enjoying the bits of poetry in the emails, which is exciting for me because honestly I&#39;ve never really experienced the appeal of poetry before, or at least not as much as so many people seem to.

This was mentally really hard for me. I could easily do the exhale but had a lot of a trouble inhaling. At the end i found i need some mental Image for me it was climbing up stairs or a snake movement that helped me reach a higher inhale.

"Oof, this was definitely needed. I have GAD and as part of it, I&#39;ve always had a super shallow, super quick inhale. Slowing it down is such a relief and so relaxing, even if I feel like I&#39;m gasping it in at the end of the count. I also love that it brought my awareness to my regular breathing pattern, and gave me the thought I need to maybe work on slowing it down during my regular day. Pupdate: best day yet! She stayed by my side, either resting her chin on my knee, her side against my body, or just slightly disconnected from me. She seemed super relaxed, and very content.

"My first comment here.  First, thank you, Adriene, for today&#39;s practice.  I had a horrible night&#39;s sleep and was putting off getting on the mat because didn&#39;t think I could make it through today, but of course I did.  I feel vibrant after all that breathing!  This me think of the breathing exercises my choir director would make us do, except of course that inhale would need to be quick and deep, so a ratio of more like <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnw2-SUbcCI&amp;t=2m16s"">2:16</a>.  And can I just say I&#39;m so excited about this series.  It has been years since I have been on the yoga mat for more than a couple days, and I have needed it so much.

When I saw the socks - it took my breath away - and then you gave it back. Lateral breathing and striction in the back of the throat helps me control the volume of air on inspiration and expiration. I like to hiss in and hum out. This is so what I&#39;ve done with biofeedback guy on HRV - this is the kind of breath that swimmers do. We only get to breath in every other arm pull. Took me way back to swimming practice with my eyes closed. Ms. A - you are a time traveler.,Roger Clem,2021-01-17T17:58:42Z,1

"This practice is exactly what my post-COVID body and lungs needed. So incredibly restorative and healing. My lungs have not been the same since COVID hit me at the end of October, although they continue to improve. I can see now that incorporating more ratios will help, and I&#39;ll add the holding at the top, too. To have this series focus on the breath, when so many are struggling to catch theirs, or losing their lives because they cannot, is not lost on me. I FEEL ALIVE after this practice (and after most yoga), and - more importantly, perhaps - I FEEL THANKFUL TO BE ALIVE today to experience the joy of breath.

The idea of discipline often carries an unfortunate dirty reputation in the West that connects it to something more like punishment. But discipline really is about cultivating our best self to awaken higher vibrations. Don&#39;t be scared by the title. This one is all about carving out the beauty of you!,Joe Whelan,2021-01-17T16:32:53Z,1
I feel exquisitely serene after today&#39;s practice. I have been really struggling to be mentally present for yoga lately.

today I found it difficult to stay still and focused- this discipline was definitely a challenge for me as i&#39;ve struggled with really restricted breathing that i&#39;ve been practicing to deepen. during the ratio counts I found it super hard to slow it down and focus- but when the video ended I tried the 8 count on my own and found it a little easier to slow down. this is def something I wanna work on more!,Deanna Smith,2021-01-17T16:19:56Z,0

"Normally this much sitting bothers my back. At about the two-thirds point, I noticed my back start to ache. Normally I would start dwelling on that and lose my focus. However, without much effort, today, my train of thought went to, &quot;Wow, how cool is it that my spine is working so hard to support me right now?!&quot;<br />So what normally would have been a huge distraction, turned into a moment of being grateful.

I&#39;m a Masters competitive swimmer in my 50s. Breathing in swimming is so different from breathing in yoga- we have to snatch a breath quickly at fixed points in the stroke.

First I&#39;ve had enough hat in many months! Can&#39;t prove it of course, but I&#39;m sure your wise guidance and my discipline in returning to the mat every day no matter what is the reason!

We feel restricted, ,limited, hard... <br /><br />As I sit here, crouched over on the keyboard before I run off into the whirlwind of my day, it hits me, the years of shallow breath, the powering through - and I was a professional poet, yo! I mean, the industry of rhythmic enlightened though subject to the same stress as collectively feel as a society. <br /><br />I breathed so deeply I felt it in my heart and it opened. How can we all commit to opening our hearts, exposing our soul a little more? How can we expend into our days and breathe deeply as if we are loved. Because we are.",Corie Feiner,2021-01-17T15:23:15Z,1

Now I’m finding more and more an attitude of “this is the good stuff” where I find challenge. And that translates right off the mat. Truly, daily at home practice has and continues to change my life. Thank you Adriene!",Emily Shippee,2021-01-17T15:17:47Z,0

"WOW! This practice has sailed straight to the top of my favorites list!!!!! So revealing and super enlightening......I&#39;ve tried ratio breathing in the past and it always triggered anxiety for me (the opposite of helpful lol), but today I learned something. I realized it&#39;s about being graceful with the breath. And in order to fill up, I have to empty. I have to be honest, when I heard inhale for 8 that anxiety tried to invite itself back, but I stayed connected to my breath and I DID IT! A little celebratory giggle may have interrupted my moment of &quot;exquisite stillness&quot; ;) Thank you for creating a space that allowed me the comfort to explore and learn! Totally jazzed to carry this away with me!",Amanda Lynn,2021-01-17T15:08:56Z,0
Anyone else sit on a block during this practice?

"Wild.  Who knew controlling your breath took so much discipline!

"I just want to thank you Adriene for all these videos. I&#39;ve been managing chronic pain for a few years now and have always sporadically chosen certain YWA videos. Last year, like so many others I began a more regular practice and it got me through some of the darker days of lockdown here in the UK. The more I practiced the more I began to connect with and realise how integral breath was. I completed a few of your 30 day challenges last year and this is the first time I&#39;ve completed it in real time, as it is being released. It&#39;s keeping me and my husband grounded through another lockdown here in the UK. I&#39;m noticing my body growing stronger and how yoga poses are beginning to show up in daily tasks, helping me to move safely and minimize my pain. I&#39;m very grateful.

"This day was hard for me.  Woke up late after a late night last night and hadn&#39;t had a coffee before coming to this practise so I was ready for some movement to help wake my tired ass up.  Until I realised this entire practise was just breathing.  I&#39;ll be honest - I didn&#39;t want to sit and just breath when I was feeling so tired and instead of using my breath to move through how I was feeling with it, I skipped the rest (after the first breath ratio round).  Some days you are not up for lots of movement and today I was not up for lots of breathing haha.  It&#39;s okay because I will come back to this practise maybe tonight or tomorrow.

Doing this while just sitting was very peaceful. Thank you for bringing this awareness. I look forward to working with the breath. On a side note, I use breathing techniques with my students when they are highly upset over something that they believe is out of their control. Breathing exercises have always been my go-to to calm them down. I might do it for myself bcz I can’t understand what has caused them all that emotion when they’re crying &amp; yelling at the same time. Slowing down the breath calms them &amp; helps them think. “Was it really all that?”",Tosha O'Neal,2021-01-17T13:56:38Z,0

With the start of your e-mail to set the stage and your Mary Oliver (!) poem I allowed myself to slow down and breathe. Thanks again and again and again, Adriene!",Gail Castle,2021-01-17T13:54:42Z,0
"I loved this practice! For a few months now I have been consistently meditating and my breath has definitely improved, slowed, and deepened. It was great to test out how much my breath has changed and also how it was challenged. I definitely struggled breathing in for 8 counts but it was a good expansion. I think I needed some stillness to bring some awareness to how I have been feeling and how I want to feel. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve made it this far and I am so blessed to be here with everyone else on this journey or breath and discovery and healing. I&#39;m pumped for what&#39;s to come! Thank you Adriene!",Melanie H,2021-01-17T13:54:38Z,0

"I had an ex who often, when I asked what he was thinking about, would say &quot;nothing&quot;. I was baffled. How does a person think about nothing? My mind is always whirring with a million things at once. He told me he has a &quot;nothing box&quot; where he can just think about absolutely nothing. <br /><br />When Adriene gets us to focus on our breath, there are tiny flits of a nothing box for me. Tiny moments where I feel like I&#39;m just released from thinking about things. It&#39;s an incredible feeling of just being--just existing.<br /><br />Before coming to the mat I&#39;m constantly ruminating on my to-do list. Whenever we finish I just sit in peaceful bliss, not caring to move, wondering what was so urgent that I almost convinced myself I couldn&#39;t set aside 30 minutes for yoga (30 minutes I would have undoubtedly used to scroll aimlessly through TikTok somewhere else in my day). <br /><br />This is the first time I have managed to be consistent, and I have a feeling just having made it this far will be the motivation I need to make it to the end of the 30 days. But I really hope I have the discipline to continue on after because this has been such a sweet and beneficial part of my days.",watermelancholy,2021-01-17T13:48:47Z,0

"So, fun testimonial regarding this journey; I had planned to do a 30 day diet and workout from Jan-Feb, adding in some more disciplined time for study and meditation, and cutting out some of my worse habits. Part of that study was working through the book of John in Greek. In chapter 3 of that book Jesus speaks with a man named Nicodemus, and Jesus explains the nature of the spiritual life to him. No surprise here, Pneuma (Greek) and Ruach (Hebrew) can mean either Spirit, Breath, or Wind. After a couple years of practicing Wim Hof I was already pretty keen to the spiritual possibilities of breathing, but I&#39;m very thankful to this practice for helping me to really dig into it right as I&#39;m reading about this super enigmatic relationship between it and our spiritual life!",James McLaughlin,2021-01-17T13:42:31Z,0

"I used to feel pretty intimidated by the idea of &quot;discipline&quot; because I guess it made me think of failure: being disciplined is something I have struggled with for most of my life (and I still do in some areas!). By far the biggest benefit of daily yoga practice for me has been the realisation that discipline is in fact something that I&#39;m capable of (although it took a fair bit of patience and perserverance - it was seven months before I finally met my goal of establishing that daily practice!). There&#39;s a video from one of Adriene&#39;s previous series in which she says something about discipline being liberating and I found this confusing at first, but after a year of daily practice, I think I&#39;m starting to understand what she was getting at.",Ellie King,2021-01-18T02:57:26Z,1

"Wow. This was a really special day. As I was doing these breathing drills, I reflected on the types of breaths I see during my shifts as a nurse on a daily basis. I reflected on images of my patients breathing during tonight’s shift. I listen to lungs at the beginning of my shifts, asking my patients to take a deep breath as I listen to the front and the back, each of the lobes. I give them medicines to help make breathing easier, maybe helping to remove fluid from their lungs so they can breathe better. I help them on and off of BiPAP or CPAP to assist them with taking breaths. I pay attention to the muscles they use as they breathe - is there a great work of breathing or is it natural and effortless? When they sleep, I notice the rhythm: is it regular, or are there pauses? And rarely (thankfully), I am at the bedside as I listen to final breaths. During this COVID pandemic my attention to the breath has only become that much more acute. I stood outside my family member’s door while they stayed in my hospital’s Covid unit battling the disease for an entire month, watching the breath, grimacing as I saw how difficult each one was for them. Watching how tired they got day after day just trying to breathe. On my unit, I watched their oxygen saturation while I went about my shifts, pleading with it to stay up high enough. I sighed with relief when they proned and the oxygen saturation improved. While that family member lived, I lost two others to this terrible disease this year. Unrelated to COVID, I watched another family member, at end of life, have their chest rise and fall with the assist of a ventilator. And I watched as the doctor extubated them and they breathed on their own for a time. I remembered how grievous it was to see my loved ones without their chests rising and falling from the breath when their life had gone from them. And as I breathed along with this video, reflecting on the breaths, my chest and belly expanding, my own lungs filling with air, feeling a sense of calm as I slowed my breath, engaging my parasympathetic nervous system, pumping the brakes on the seemingly endless fight or flight mode that is nursing, a sense of complete gratitude washed over me for the gift of breath. Our breath fuels our life. It’s so simple, so astounding, and as we breathe, we are partaking in life. We are blessed with such a gift. And as I finished the 8 second inhale and 8 second exhale, “exquisite stillness” being the how Adriene chose to describe it, i felt something very similar. A moment of complete calm, a respite from the sympathetic nervous system being constantly revved up. That lovely stillness was a gift from the breath. Thank you, Adriene. Thank you so much for helping me find a moment of reflection, gratitude, and peace. My soul was thirsty for that reprieve. ❤️",Rebecca Pecoraro,2021-01-17T12:36:33Z,33

"Hi Rebecca, I am a CNA with some understanding of what you go through everyday.  Although my job is not as intense, I do find myself tuning in to my breath while I chart, standing in mountain pose to stretch the spine.  It’s hard work on the body!  And overall I’ve noticed I’m calmer these days.  Thank you for all of your hard work.  We will get through this one breath at a time.❤️❤️",Ann Marie Mahaney,2021-01-18T00:01:57Z,0

"This was so good!! I always forget to breathe in daily life, which sounds weird, but I just mean that I have dysregulated breathing patterns sometimes. I hold my breath frequently, particularly when I&#39;m anxious or stressed, which leads me to sigh a lot too. I never used to notice this, it must sound like I am annoyed all the time, but I&#39;m not - I&#39;m nervous! Practising this discipline of breathing really, really helps with that, and really helps to calm me down when I can remind myself to breathe out.<br />I&#39;ve also heard that breathing out slowly can convince your nervous system that you are not under attack, and so is very calming.<br />Love this so much.",Sara Evans,2021-01-17T12:13:54Z,0

"A tip for you from a fellow anxiety fighter: when you&#39;re feeling anxious, slow your breath but make sure you&#39;re breathing out MORE than you&#39;re breathing in. It&#39;s actually over-breathing that makes the anxious feelings happen and snowball. If you don&#39;t breathe out fully, the CO2 makes you feel anxious! It&#39;s been life-changing for me to learn and I hope it helps you too. Don&#39;t be afraid to take in less air when you&#39;re feeling like you need to gasp for it. Fight the urge and the anxiety will subside. You&#39;re not alone. ❤",Angie,2021-01-17T22:04:45Z,5

Do not raise<br />your small voice against it. And do not<br />take cover. Instead, curl your toes<br />into the grass, watch the cloud<br />ascending from your lips.

Wow - I loved this - been working on breathing through the nose for a year or so - tape my mouth when sleeping (really its not as dramatic as it sounds) - but also - gave up running as I couldn&#39;t run without breathing through my mouth - (why - google nose breathing and it soon becomes clear) - BUT - today - I felt sooooo super relaxed after the practice - it was like being in heaven.  I think it was the sharing - doing it with so many others rather than just doing breath work on my own.  Thank you Adriene and Benji x,Diane Pedder,2021-01-17T12:00:48Z,0

"What an incredible practice! Also, I swear you have some magical powers and always know what to say at the perfect moment. The ratio was going well for the first couple of rounds, but then I got stuck (empty) at 3 so I held my breath, but it didn&#39;t feel right and I started to get frustrated. And then, of course, you talked precisely about that, and I got magically &quot;unstuck&quot; for the next round, as if you literally gave me a little more air to breathe. For the 8:8, I managed to fill until 6, which is a win in my book after thinking I was stuck at 3 earlier.

"I suspiciously noticed the socks, but still was hoping for a short vinyasa flow. As we started breathing and do more breathing,  I noticed how a little impatience was growing in me. How can this the easiest thing at first glance, BREATHING AND SITTING STILL might be sometimes so difficult to do??  and then it hit me! Ahhh, DISCIPLINE, the art! <br />I&#39;m so grateful for this opportunity to discover that breathing DOES MORE to your mind and body than a physical practice.

"When I started the video, I felt some discomfort in my body which was very distracting, and I thought about stopping and returning to the practice at another time when I feel better. But then Adriene started talking about how we can <b>use</b> the things that distract us, how we can bring them with us to the mat and work with them. That really was an eye-opener for me. <br />I continued with today&#39;s practice, and it turned out to be EXACTLY what I needed! The breathing exercices brought so much calm to my mind and body. And as my nervous system was slowing down, the discomfort I had felt at the beginning also started to disappear. <br />Yoga with Adriene is a true gift. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, dear Adriene. And thanks to everyone in this beautiful community for taking this time for yourselves and for practicing together. You are awesome!<br />Sending love from Germany :-)",Jana K,2021-01-17T10:55:39Z,0

"Hey Adriene, hey fellow journey mates. I promised myself that I would only comment after getting past half the journey, coz then I&#39;d know that I can and will finish the full 30 days, and it&#39;s funny that day 16 is Discipline, so synchronistic 😂😍. I can&#39;t explain fully in words how rewarding and fulfilling this journey has been. I had prepared a lot of words in my mind to tell you Adriene but now I&#39;m falling short. I&#39;d just like to thank you, deeply, for everything that you do, for a world you know nothing about. You&#39;re such a beautiful beautiful person and I hope you never forget this strength and power that you have. You&#39;re saving the world one breath at a time. You&#39;re saving my world. I&#39;m eternally grateful.<br /><br />Everyday I tell myself, if Adriene can wake up every day to do this for people she don&#39;t know, I can wake up and do it for myself. <br /><br />So far my experience is best described as FULFILLING. <br /><br />I am learning to honour MYSELF. <br /><br />I am learning to celebrate LIFE.<br /><br />I am feeling ALIVE, BEAUTIFUL &amp; LOVED.<br /><br />May the sun always shine upon your life Adriene, and to you too, my fellow journey mates. This world is us. Be aware of it. And as Adriene said on day 14, take up space my darling, you&#39;re worthy of it all.<br /><br />ALUTA CONTINUA!",Serena Ndekeremo,2021-01-17T10:52:48Z,33

"I always find the slow practises the hardest but they are the ones that teach me discipline. I was craving popping into a downward facing dog but I managed to just seat and breathe for 30 minutes which was amazing.

"Feeling it in the legs today, being in sukhasana for so long, it’s an arthritis thing for me, but it eased as I breathed. We have done some of this counting breathing before Adriene, and I use it sometimes when I can’t get off to sleep. So today was good. It super slows down the mind and body and I learned to not rush into that breath in, but to even it out for the count and it works well for me. This disciplined breathing is truly awesome and always zens me out and I come off my mat very very slowly with a sort of dreamy feeling. See you tomorrow on the mat for EXPLORE 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💕",Gill Smith,2021-01-17T09:28:29Z,1

"I didnt really get what Adriene meant with connect the breath at first, so everytime there was an inhale I sort of treated it as its own thing and i did a little run up where I inhaled a bit stronger at the beginning. Same for my exhale. While I made the exhales, I couldnt get my inhale to extent past 4 or 5 seconds. <br />Then at 8/8 it suddenly clicked for the last two breaths? If it was just one flow I could actually easily get to 8 seconds inhale!

"Morning YWA friends,  I experienced emotions &amp; grief this excercise. I loved doing it but breathing in for a longer period was really hard and made me emotional. Breathing out was easy. A beautiful lesson to learn from I think. Enjoy our day 🌈",Colette P.,2021-01-17T08:04:46Z,2

"I quite like this lass. However, as I have been practicing hatha yoga since the 1970’s, beginning with “Lilias, Yoga and you”, this is a bit superfluous.<br />I hope you’re aware that there are hundreds of types of yoga. Hatha yoga is well known in the West. Among other types are Raja yoga, an open eye form of meditation. I studied it in the 1980’s at the Minds Eye Museum on Busch Boulevard in Tampa.<br />My friend Cowan studied Kundalini yoga. That focuses on opening the chakras, the seven energy centers of the human body.<br />Then there’s tantra yoga, the sexy one. You can find it for yourself.;)",Jason Bean,2021-01-17T08:04:42Z,0

Was feeling a little overwhelmed with the week to come as I have to prep a lot for my classes and courses and maintaining my home yoga practice as this is the one thing that helps me clear my mind and be able to focus and breeze through my day with the power of BREATH, by DROPPING in, FEELING my breath and bringing DISCIPLINE to my mind, body n spirit.

Thank you so so much Adriene. Each of your yoga journey is special!!! For me it&#39;s year 5 I think. <br />Love from Germany! 💗✨",JK,2021-01-17T06:34:28Z,2

"Fun fact: Discipline comes from the word &#39;disciple&#39; which means student. So as Adriene says let&#39;s take the opportunity to learn each day on and off the mat. :) What have you learnt today? Have a lovely day, people!",Li Stan,2021-01-17T06:14:57Z,397
"I agree - ever since I realised this it changed my attitude to discipline but also to my expectations of discipline from my kids for example. Discipline = we are learning, aiming to be better. Even though we are still far from being perfect.",maveva111,2021-01-17T23:17:02Z,0

Adriene i have been practicing with you since the end of 2019 and its the best thing i could’ve done! I am so grateful to have be able to practice with you for that long. I love your videos so much and they always make my day!,Alexia productions,2021-01-17T06:07:56Z,7
Adriene&#39;s channel is the only bell I have turned on. I&#39;m caught between calling it my Happy Bell or Benji Bell for alliteration,Arthur G,2021-01-17T06:06:14Z,3
"If you want to conquer the anxiety of life, live in the moment, live in the BREATH! Thankyou wholeheartedly, Adriene &amp; Benji 🐾 ^_^",dytto courtney,2021-01-17T06:05:20Z,125
"Agree 100%, it&#39;s all about finding the natural rythmn to your own breath, slowing down and if you don&#39;t find that , nothing will work 😊",Dons forever,2021-01-17T13:07:05Z,3
"Discipline is my favorite theme to explore with Adriene, it brings a little order to the weird world we&#39;re living in. Stay safe everyone!",Laura,2021-01-17T06:05:09Z,50
Indeed! With the world feeling so out of control it&#39;s easy to forget how stopping for a second just to take a conscious  breath can bring back a little  sense of calm/control. Best wishes to you  as well!,Rafield corn,2021-01-17T16:29:09Z,0
I even turn on the notification for this. I always look forward to this daily yoga session <br /><br />After this exercise suddenly I feel like my lungs just expanded if that makes sense 😊,Raquelita,2021-01-17T06:05:04Z,46
