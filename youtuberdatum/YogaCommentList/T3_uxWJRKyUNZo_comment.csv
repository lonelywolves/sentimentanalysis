"Lift your heart, relax your shoulders and let’s celebrate one week together.<br /><br />This program has depth. It asks you to sustain curiosity and extend a kindness to yourself that maybe you are not used to.  It asks you to show up, even when you don’t feel like it, or when it feels like the day is conspiring against you.<br /><br />You should feel proud! One week of showing up for yourself in this manner is no small feat.<br /><br />Let&#39;s keep going.",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-08T13:45:57Z,1386

"Thank you so much for this cycle of lessons! Proper breathing and movement form the essence of these exercises. When performing exercises and breathing properly, we pay more attention to the details of movement. This is very important to do, but even more important to do it right! Nice for everyone!

"I just started my journey here, and i&#39;m feeling so grateful. I have had an emotionally difficult last few days, and during this practice, I felt that &quot;at least yoga is here for me in stressful and painful times&quot;.

I wonder if anyone else feels this way! Thanks Adriene!",Amazonia Artwork,2021-04-20T12:02:45Z,1

"I started with the 30 day breath series in mid January this year, and now I&#39;m on day 90 of daily yoga. Yoga with Adrienne has given me the confidence and skills to practice solo, but I still like getting Adrienne&#39;s &quot;guidance&quot; with my favorite videos a few times a week. I have mental and physical health issues and I have noticed an improvement in both since I started. I&#39;ve watched this particular video so many times, its one of my favorites.

"So, a question, maybe someone will be able to tell me. When I hear &#39;lift the heart&#39; in a seated position, it usually involves straightening the back using back and stomach muscles and then I try to breathe deep, which means expanding the diaphragm, and if I use stomach muscles to keep myself straight... it just doesn&#39;t work.

"I’m doing this on Valentine’s Day, so the pep talk at the beginning about loving yourself is too perfect! This is probably my favorite one so far, the diagonal circles were heaven, I didn’t realize how much tension was in my neck and shoulders, until I worked out the right shoulder and then compared both shoulders before working out the left.

"This should&#39;ve been day eight for me but I missed practice yesterday because I simply had no time to do it and I was so sad at the end of the day when I realized that I didn&#39;t get to have my 30 minutes on the mat. I was thinking about doing day eight&#39;s practice today too, but then came to the conclusion that this journey I&#39;m on isn&#39;t about rushing, and missing a day isn&#39;t the end of the world. The main point is that I came back today and continued from where I left off. &quot;Who cares, life is good.&quot;",Charlie Dakota,2021-02-14T12:48:27Z,1

Hi Adrienne . It’s been a while since I connected . My body is in so much pain . If I do yoga it benefits my body but it hurts other areas. So I take time off but at the same time it ruins the benefit as well. 🙄.<br />Just wanted to share with you that I recently fell on 01-07-21 to my bad side of my body and now I feel like my body took a step back and started to feel stiff again . I try to do as much as I can but I can’t do a lot . I want to stretch my back doing cat/cow but that specific stretch messes up my disk and it creates pain down my leg and my sciatica area. Pls show me other ways to stretch my back hoping it won’t hurt other areas of my body . I wish I can tell u my story but I know u r so busy . <br />Love ur vids kisses from San Jose California,Ruth Carrillo,2021-02-09T01:18:00Z,0

Well I am very late to the trend. Found you on your day like 20 something and was mad at first because I couldn&#39;t do it with everyone but then I said screw it and started on day 1. I took a beginners yoga class in college about 3 years ago and haven&#39;t done it since. So I started at the very beginning. Today was the first day I felt kind of connected with my body which is pretty cool. Can&#39;t wait to see where I am at on day 30. I hope I can keep myself accountable to this nice challenge.

I’m loving this series. It’s very calming and nurturing. Thank you Adriene. I’m still very achy from ‘Burn’ though and the fire breath. I’m supposing that’s a good thing and so I keep working through it. Hopefully the aches will go if I continue and persevere 🙂🙂🇬🇧🌟🙏🏻,Carole Dodd,2021-01-17T16:54:30Z,0
"My upper back gets so tight it&#39;s hard to take a deep breath.

"This sounds so silly but I just have to share. Like many, I&#39;ve had an absolutely abysmal year and I&#39;ve returned to practicing yoga after a few years hiatus to try to restore some peace to my life. I was having a particularly shit day today, super down on myself, super &quot;woe is me life isn&#39;t fair.&quot; It was just a funny off-hand comment, but Adriene when you mentioned how the framing might be off with Benji behind you and then just said &quot;who cares, life is good&quot; I had to laugh and actually it even made me a little emotional. I&#39;m learning to take life less seriously and I think that may be my new moto. Who cares, life is good.",Rebecca Elizabeth,2021-01-17T04:37:24Z,77

"&quot;Our quest for the Breath&quot; ❤ Awsome in so many ways, both symbolic and physical. I´m sure that you have a masterplan (as always) and I just want to agnolish the perfect timing of the BREATH theme THIS year (the sad and crazy time of the virus).  I  had the awful Covid virus a month ago and was very ill. The way back is long but I can feel how my lungs are recovering. Doing yoga with full focus on the BREATH is LOVELY right now. Being ill and away from the mat for a couple of weeks offcourse also shows on your strengh and flexibility so this programe is PERFECT for me right now. Back to basic, building the body, but foremost the mind. The acceptance, the positivity, the letting go and overall the love. &quot;Life is good&quot;.

"Aloha Adriene, i was wondering when is the best time of day to do your routine? Iʻve been starting my day at 6am with your daily dose. I love it. Following yoga I do some calistethics like jumping jacks planks situps high knees and or pushups. Following that I do 4-6 laps walk down 3 and light jog up 3 my steep hill. Following that I do 15min on my Simply Fit Board. I do this daily M-F and take a rest day on Sat &amp; Sun. <br />Is this a good routine to start with Yoga and prep the body for further ex. I donʻt know what yoga protocol is. I love the breathing the breath and opening up. You have any suggestions. <br />I loved todays class day 7 synchchronize. <br />Mahalo have a great day",Ivalee Kamalu,2021-01-14T16:32:36Z,0

Adrienne has some beaut practices for Upper Back Love and also Neck and Shoulders. They aren’t long so why don’t you tack one on to your practice?

It really helped me deepen my practice today and I think this my have been the aha moment I&#39;ve been waiting for!!",Alison Redmond,2021-01-12T11:23:44Z,0

Did this practice while in the same room as my partner while she was on a call with friends, felt a little distracted/not super plugged in, but I found some really nice stretches.

I&#39;ve been having to make a lot of accommodations on this journey and it has been challenging to let go of the idea of &quot;doing it properly&quot;, but today I was in the seated forward fold, which I would normally push myself on, but the pinched nerve in my leg wouldn&#39;t allow me to even lean forward, even setting the intention of reaching forward set off sharp electric pain in my thigh. I expected to feel frustrated, but I just sat there with my head bowed, connected with the breath and listened to Adriene. So I just wanted to say thank you to Adriene for helping me accept my limitations.",Megan Sandiford,2021-01-11T18:09:25Z,0

"This was my first miss :-( I practice in the evenings, because it helps me best at that time, “cleansing” me of the day’s stresses. But my work hours extended last Friday. I joined the program again Saturday, and did Days 7 &amp; 8 back to back. Does that count? Hehe, I understand it’s not about ticking off the days. The two videos were good together though, and it was very helpful for me. This first week of work has been very challenging, and I needed this kind of restorative practice. Hope to not have any more missed days.",ulan25,2021-01-10T02:16:13Z,0
This was exactly what I needed. My Golden Retriever unexpectedly passed away today. I originally was not going to do the session but decided to show up because it might make me feel better. This session started with Benji in front of you and ended with him in back. I couldn’t see him but knew he was there. It is a perfect way for me to view my day. Thank you for all you pour into these 30 day series. This is my fourth and I love each new one. 💛,Katherine Kaye,2021-01-10T01:56:20Z,198

"Yoga with Adrienne always helps me feel better. No matter whats going on, no matter what trauma/stress I may be processing, no matter what harmful urges - Yoga with Adrienne always calms, soothes, &amp; quiets the storm in me. I feel so at peace &amp; connected with my body. I took a few days off bc emotion, but if there&#39;s a next time where I feel so down, I don&#39;t think I will. After catching up I feel like I&#39;ve come back into my true self - my bodies like &quot;Hey (gently). Remember us? We&#39;re a place of calm &amp; safety for you&quot;. I forgot just how safe I feel being present in me/my body since starting yoga with you all. Thank you to everyone, especially the 3,000 (3,000!!!!) people who breathe, practiced, &amp; nourished/made love to their bodies together through this video with me.

"Hi fellow day-behind friends! As an &quot;experienced beginner&quot; (i.e. I&#39;ve been doing yoga regularly for a year... I definitely don&#39;t feel I can call myself an intermediate yet but YMMV!! :)) this wasn&#39;t the most challenging practice at all (which is often what I like) but I have found it the best so far. Something about the flow of the sequence is so lovely, and made me feel emotional in a way normally only a session with a lot of hip openers does (holla if you know what I mean!). It&#39;s a reminder that though for me yoga started as a way for enhancing my flexibility/fitness, in fact the best thing it is giving me is mindfulness. I find meditation etc very challenging, having a very busy mind, and during this weird time it&#39;s been buzzing like mad. These classes really do help me find my centre.

"This week has been a full week even though I am still not allowed to work as a flight attendant from our government. Normally I allowed and could fly but I fell in the risk category for this virus. But I do 3 jobs at home for our company and it is volunteering at three different departments and I am a council for one of our unions and get many calls from colleagues with concerns about our job. So listening, caring, being kind but mostly giving them honest advice because I was chosen to speak for them but mostly to listen and tell their worries. I love doing this and I am always giving but this yoga with Adriene, where I was so humbled to follow a lesson in 2016 when you came to the Netherlands, was an honor to practice in real life instead of always following via this channel, but to get back this is what I need after doing my running everyday just to be for 2 hours to be myself mentally and physically.

"@Kim Mcb 1. I didn&#39;t say anything negative. I said that they were cheesy, and that I had a problem with that, but that is my personal preference and I didn&#39;t say anything bad about a person&#39;s character or that cheesiness is bad. I am cheesy with some things, I just don&#39;t like reading cheesy youtube comments and I was just stating that. Are you denying that these comments are cheesy?<br />2. Clearly struggling? More like clearly complaining and venting their emotions. Whether they&#39;re actually struggling or not, you and I will never know.<br />3. You should not be on a youtube comments section if you&#39;re looking for kindness. My thoughts are not mean, they are factual and if they are not and are simply emotional, I will not say them, I assure you. <br />4. I assume you are a somewhat (at least) emotional person and will not be thrilled with this message. I recommend you do another yoga session to blow off some steam and do not embarrass yourself by throwing swearwords and insults back at me, but if you are not what I assumed you are and can have a logical discussion and not take my words personally, then please, explain to me why what I said was so negative and mean and the evidence that these &quot;people&quot; are &quot;struggling.&quot;",Tiffany & Stevie Freeman,2021-03-24T16:34:54Z,0

"Thank you Adriene!  I really enjoyed syncing up my breath, attention and intention to flow. It was was beautiful lesson, that gave me a much needed sense of peace, after a difficult and anxious day. So the idea of “letting go of the day thus far” really spoke to me.  As I started doing it before bed, it really “saves the day.” I feel proud that I made it to day 7, and congrats to everyone as well! ..I also noticed that showing up to do this yoga challenge every day, with the intention of making time for self care, has given me a more positive sense of self acceptance/ esteem / concept, outside how well I functioned earlier in my day. Yoga is an oasis of “practising” positive human values. It’s also literally feeding my life force,  helping to keep me going!

That my legs function properly then bc dr is saying the veins gotta be collapsed due to pooling. Ikno i over share lol but if anyone out there is going thru what i am I’m jus here to support ya.

Then, when I&#39;m feeling better, I get back onto whatever 30 day video would be up next. This way, I still get my yoga every day and I also get even more than 30 days in a row!

"Very best to you in your surgery. I had vein surgery on 1 leg several years back, really improved my quality of life, though not perfect. I have been doing YWA for about 6 months now and have been amazed at how much the gentle strengthening has improved the circulation in my legs (along with so many other wonderful benefits!), which was something I had no expectation of. Be kind to yourself during your recovery. For me, it wasn&#39;t bad at all, just some discomfort, but the main thing I remember is the strong need to elevate my leg, so don&#39;t plan on doing too much for too long for a while, just a balanced approach to recovery. Since yours involves both legs, even more reason to be kind to yourself. Take care, sending loving thoughts to you.",Laura Barquero,2021-01-11T14:19:17Z,1

I have also put on a great deal of weight.  As we started this week, my Achilles’ tendon was giving me some trouble, and even though I would stretch sometimes, it never got much better.   After this first week, I feel a bit better and noticed the pain in the Achilles’ tendon is almost gone.   Thank you so much for this practice.   Namaste",Holli Vybez,2021-01-09T03:31:35Z,0
Question -- I am not strong enough (yet!) to &quot;lower to the belly&quot; from plank.  I tend to collapse to my knees part way down.  Is it better for me to just move to a plank at my knees at this point so I can lower with the flat back?  Or should I just keep working at it to get the strength?,B.K. Kelley,2021-01-09T03:29:51Z,0

"Been doing ywa regularly since the summer but this is the first time I have maintained a week! There&#39;s usually something that has me skip a day, but it helps my hypermobile body feel much more aligned, despite being advised to avoid it from PTs.

Reading the comments from strangers reminding me that 7 consistent days of practice is something to celebrate was empowering.  My intention for 2021 involves commitment and leading from the heart.

"This is the furthest I&#39;ve gotten in consecutive days of yoga, and I really wasn&#39;t feeling up to it today. I had a slow, unproductive day and I felt extremely exhausted. But I encouraged myself to get on the mat and do the practice and I could not believe how rewarding it was! It felt like everything was falling into place! I finally was able to press into the outer edge of my back foot in warrior two without falling off balance, I could sit with my legs straight out without feeling pressure on my lower back, and I finally felt a connection between my breath and the movement. After the practice ended I teared up and could not stop smiling :) It really is like magic and you never know when you&#39;re finally going to understand what it&#39;s supposed to feel like.

Omg. Today i was doing the vinyasa and I was doing hardly any modifications and my body knew what muscles to turn on and to use the breath.

Your class gives me the opportunity to do daily yoga in a time frame that works for my schedule, and most especially works for my body.  It’s my little bit of zen moment, usually followed by meditation and some Vortex work on myself.

"Day 7. Check! I have so many things to say... First of all, I felt genuinely happy by the end of the practice. Before coming to the mat, I was feel slightly hesitant, but all I needed was less than a couple minutes into the practice to understand the importance of just showing up. I felt elegant doing all the poses, and my body was synchronizing by himself to both the movements and the breath. I felt strong. Day 7 was the day that I noticed a little calmer mind, even though there were still some thoughts popping up here and there. One week later, I feel the evolution, I feel the motivation, I feel the joy. I am so happy. Thank you! See you tomorrow for sweet day 8 everyone.",Alexandra Bob,2021-01-09T01:25:16Z,0

One week down! Proud of a couple of things here. First being able to commit for a full week. Even on days I didn’t want to i forced myself and at the end was always happy I did. A second thing I am proud of is how much better my moods are. Even off the mat just remembering the breaths of invitation and love have helped me remember how beautiful life is in what has been a strange week. Third... for the first time in a decade I can touch my toes with straight legs. Thank you so much Adriene. Seriously.,Mikeylikesit318,2021-01-08T22:10:23Z,0

"Showing up really was the hardest part today, after a long, long night with a sleepless, possibly teething toddler and sore from day 6... but I&#39;m so glad I made myself show up! I learned yoga is one of those things that you need the most when you want to do them the least :)",DarrenaShan,2021-01-08T20:53:55Z,0
Still here! Feeling achy all over and I don’t know if it’s from Burn or if my body is fighting off the coronavirus. Taking deep breaths is a little troublesome. So I didn’t feel showing up today. But I did and I’m so grateful. Looking forward to yummy day 8 😍,Malisa Mendez,2021-01-08T20:53:31Z,0
"Today I wasn&#39;t feeling myself. I was anxious, had intrusive thoughts and it was really difficult for me to turn to the mat. But every time I come out of these practices I feel more at peace with myself. I want to take a time to thank my body since it was a really good day where I felt more at ease and felt more flexible, and I encourage everyone here taking these practices with me to embrace where you&#39;re at, even if it was a really bad day or a good day, thank yourself and your body for how far you&#39;ve come. I also want to thank you Adriene because I had never really found myself liking yoga practices (i was more into kickboxing), and since the pandemic I have been really enjoying the practices and you&#39;ve really helped me get in touch with my body and myself.

Don&#39;t get me wrong it isn&#39;t just this class... it is the ethos and following of the Breath and YWA for the last 1.5 years which has given me the recovery capability(with caution).

"Adriene, I have to tell you - I noticed a significant shift in the way I responded to a busy work day today. I felt calm and prepared. And I know it might sound crazy to some, but I know that it is down to both tending to the body by doing yoga every day and, more importantly I think, giving love and awareness to the breath! I’m also making other positive healthy choices, but this YWA challenge each January is such a special time, and after 2020, it has never felt more sacred or impactful to me.

"I’ve watched 100+ YWA videos, and they never get repetitive or stale— I’m always finding myself learning something new (whether it be incorporating the breath in a certain way, new positions or ways to take pressure off the body, inversions, learning to better my meditation, or form improvements—even when it comes to warriors!).

"I straight up did not want to do this today. I usually get fatigued with any challenge by the end of the first week, and with what&#39;s been happening in the news, my heart has felt 10 times heavier than it normally does. But, as Adriene says, the hardest part is showing up. So, I dragged myself out of bed, threw on comfy clothes, and rolled out my mat, fully intending on just sitting on my mat and listening to her voice. <br /><br />But then she invited us to breathe together, and I took that breath. I realigned. I got in sync. And before I knew it, I was flowing through these warriors and loving the windmill arm stretches, and absolutely living for her saying &quot;Who cares? Life is good.&quot; <br /><br />So to anyone who&#39;s feeling a bit of fatigue (from anything, really), I invite you to take that first breath with us. Start with that, and see what happens.",Alison Chang,2021-01-08T18:26:06Z,1

Then question/request maybe you can speak to this in an upcoming video: I&#39;ve come to the awareness that my left leg is longer than my right leg, making grounding on all four sides of the feet and leveling hips very hard. If you have any organic insight into this, I&#39;d love to hear it. I will continue to breathe and explore with you in the meantime and ask around. Also, community!

"I had to start this journey to realize that I havent been breathing all this time up until now. I find myself drawing deeper breaths throughout the day and even surprising myself with how deep they are, how natural they come and all that jazz. I can&#39;t believe i&#39;ve been doing the most natural thing wrong....its also hard for me to breath slowly, sometimes during practice i manage to do it for 3-4 good breaths and then i&#39;m back to fast and shallow ones that i cant control. But i&#39;m really motivated to get there :) Fun fact - at the dentist chair yesterday thanks to the ocean breath i didnt have to ask for pain relief. I realized 80% of the dental pain i have is due to anxiety, tension and bad breathing. Thank you Adriene :)",Simona Simeonova,2021-01-08T18:14:58Z,0

"Just wanted to check - I find it nearly impossible to step my legs from a downward dog up into a lunge. It&#39;s also really difficult stepping them all the way back in one go, but not quite as hard. Does anyone else find this? Would be reassuring to see negotiate the moves they find difficult.<br />Today&#39;s practice was really yummy though. Can&#39;t wait for tomorrow&#39;s! 😁",Nicky Watkins,2021-01-08T18:14:37Z,0

"It&#39;s getting easier for me to get to the mat, yay! Pupdate for Day 7: Aside from a few mishaps where she hit the computer with her bone and restarted the video, she did pretty well. Getting calmer as I practice all these unfamiliar shapes, which is great! Only real puppy moment was when her santa squeaky toy fell under the bed and she whined and cried until I was able to grab it for her.",Scarlet Winter,2021-01-08T18:12:48Z,0
"Ugh YWA synchronize practices are always my favorite. They remind me to connect my breath to my body, and my body to my breath, and that’s what keeps me going during the tough moments of certain yoga poses. I will carry this synchronization into my daily life when I’m feeling frustrated, anxious, or disconnected. Namaste, y’all. See you tomorrow. :)",Madeline Renee,2021-01-08T18:12:45Z,0

I&#39;m just weird...sometimes at the end of Adriene&#39;s session I spontaneously begin to shed tears - like today!<br />Really enjoyed the fold at the end of session as i gradually loosened up almost to flat legs which is not easy with my &#39;runners hamstrings.

I was looking forward to my time on the mat all day, the first time I&#39;d not felt even the tiniest bit of resentment for it (sorry, Adriene!), and even though it was tough sitting still and turning my mind off initially, this practice was as usual, gorgeous and calming and so needed.

"Hello Adriene, 👋🏿 Thank you so much for this beautiful series of yoga classes. Also, congrats on the new space! I wasn&#39;t sure if you and your team talked about ways to offset the bright sunlight coming into the room, but have you heard of neutral density gel sheets? <br /><br />I used them on productions when I was working for a live broadcast at Linkedin. We would spray water onto the windows and lay the gel sheet so the sunlight coming in wasn&#39;t as harsh. I thought it might help in future classes 😊 Looking forward to more yoga with you and Benji",Elijah Collins,2021-01-08T18:03:39Z,0

"I missed day 5, so yesterday I did day 5 and 6 together. Today I am delighted to be synchronized with the practice again! I am feeling hopeful and joyful after this practice. I had a minor operation on my leg over the summer and I couldn&#39;t do yoga for a several months. When I started again, I found that my strength had decreased a lot and everything was much more difficult than I was used to. I felt really discouraged, and disconnected from myself. But now I&#39;m trying to use rebuilding my strength as a chance to reconnect with my body and my heart, and learn to listen closely.",Anna Broomfield,2021-01-08T17:59:19Z,0

That was so nice. Unusually for me spent lots of the day on computer so the session was perfect. As I do it it reminds me of what my body and I are capable of and also gently reminding me of my extra Covid weight that has snuck on around my middle. Yes something to work on and not to beat myself up about. We all need to be extra padded in the winter don’t we! Week 1 completed and enjoyed. Looking forward to next week.

"I&#39;ve been following this channel for a few years and this 30 day journey found me right when I needed it. I periodically get pretty bad anxiety and even though I haven&#39;t had a panic attack in a few months I realized in late december that I&#39;ve essentially forgotten how to breathe, with everything going on in the world. Far too often I find myself clenching or holding my breath. <br /><br />Now I have a pretty amazing tool to deal with that though so thank you! &lt;3 After every &quot;namaste&quot; at the end of practice I find myself smiling and feeling more chill.<br /><br />Also, I&#39;m a climber, and the more burn-y parts of these practices do help a lot with working on my climbing skills.

"Today I got on my mat with heavy thoughts and feeling like I have no space in my chest and torso. By the end, I found myself in a seated fold with my full palms on the soles of my feet comfortably. I haven&#39;t done that since high school. It was a nice little surprise to myself that I do in fact have space to play outside of the thoughts and feelings I have. <br /><br />When I first started practicing with Adriene, I couldn&#39;t synchronize my breathe to my movements. That was four years ago. I can comfortably do it now, some days easier than others. I just appreciate showing up for myself.

"I feel so comforted by the universal love that exists within this community, as I suffer and sit with my bafflement after my own nation&#39;s behavior in the past few days. I&#39;m coming to be a strong believer in the notion that our individual, communal, and global spheres mirror one another and are inextricably interconnected. Where there is tension and disruption and insurrection in one, there is bound to be ripple effects in the others, even if it manifests in unexpected ways. <br /><br />I am so grateful to have this space to breathe. I have found myself &quot;taking my breath off the mat&quot; in the last week. It&#39;s actually working! Haha In moments of fear and anger, I have found a voice in my head saying the titles of our practices together; &quot;Invite a new breath,&quot; and &quot;A new breath is arriving, Rachel,&quot; and &quot;Let this new breath replenish you.&quot; &quot;Burn away the fear and hatred.&quot; <br /><br />I&#39;ve written a lot, sorry.

"I have been doing all the calendars the past months and it helped me so much ! Yoga is so good for my self esteem because I learn by doing yoga that each part of my body is beautiful, strong and alive inside in it&#39;s own way. One part have more flexibility but is less strong, one part have gracefulness, one part is strong as hell but hey no synchronization yet here and that&#39;s ok. No perfect body, but alive and true body that supports me. Taking care of my breath helps me with anxiety and to stay in the present moment and taking awareness to my core helps me emotionally and I never taught it would do that effect. I feel more supported. I feel that I am enough. So all this paragraph to say I&#39;m so happy this new 30 days yoga journey started because you come generously with a new practice, new moves and new ways to feel the practice (just the diagonal breath and slow movements at the beginning of our practice today... WOW !) and that brings an awesome freshness in my regular practice, it&#39;s like a new start, bringing me back to the basics consideration of breath and quality of movement and to give love to myself for all littles accomplishments. Thank you so much ! 💛",Coralie Dansereau,2021-01-08T16:21:32Z,1

I nearly allowed myself to postpone till morning but said NO at 11:30 pm and found it the perfect sequence for a late night practice. 💜",William B,2021-01-08T15:06:51Z,0
"I just loved this sequence! I was challenged to synchronize life off and on the mat at 7.30 am while I was trying to move &amp; breathe with intention, my son was getting ready for school in the kitchen, cooking his breakfast as well as his take-away lunch and guess what? He came by and gently interrupted my practice to ask if he could still use my pesto sauce on his pasta which looked mouldy. I said yes and this was a micro-journey inside my day 7 in 30-day yoga journey. At the end of the day, how important is this? I am always struggling to synchronize doing with being and today I managed to take some insights. I am so grateful for today&#39;s practice and this beautiful verb, dearest Adriene! Yoga is so much more than just physical workout. It is so much more beyond this and off the mat. Namasté.",Cristina Belo,2021-01-08T15:06:19Z,1

This is my first time on the 30 day journey and I&#39;ve really enjoyed the first 7 days. I discovered Yoga with Adrienne when one of her videos popped up as a suggestion after I&#39;d done a different exercise session on YouTube. I&#39;m not new to yoga but know I&#39;m never going to be super flexible. <br />I&#39;m in England and we&#39;re now into our 3rd lockdown due to very high levels of a new variant of Covid. Throughout this pandemic I&#39;ve found all the online exercise videos amazing. I think I do more exercise than I ever did before. <br />Looking forward to day 8 of our 30 day journey.,Jenny Turner,2021-01-08T10:27:01Z,2

"I&#39;m definitely proud of myself for sticking to this journey and practicing every day for a week straight. After my long hiatus from yoga, I am reminded how important and helpful it is in so many areas of my life. Today&#39;s practice was great, even if I struggled with the elbow over thigh flow, and had a moment of frustration and self-doubt. But after yesterday&#39;s realization, and reading a very interesting and timely chapter in the book about stress and trauma recovery I&#39;ve been enjoying for the past few months, I was more gentle with myself and respected my limits for today. With that said, I&#39;m probably not the only one here who REALLY looks forward to tomorrow&#39;s practice! It&#39;s much needed and will be greatly appreciated :) See you all tomorrow!",Marion Carminelitta,2021-01-08T10:17:47Z,3

"I can&#39;t do the seated forward fold.:( I can&#39;t keep my back straight, it bends instantly and the pose is completely different from what it should be, even if my legs are bent generously. It&#39;s not relaxational, not because I push too hard, but because it&#39;s a completely different pose when I do it. Any ideas what to do to possibly fix this? Or is it just the way my body is and I should accept it?",Jan Neumann,2021-01-08T10:14:22Z,0

"@Ellen Lederman I cry a LOT during and after yoga. Sometimes I know it&#39;s an emotional response, and other times it feels truly spontaneous as if a twist has released something I didn&#39;t know I needed to let go of.

"Hello Adriene! I wanted to let you know, how much your videos mean to me. I am going to turn 20 in march, our country is still knees deep in the pandemic and I cant really say, that we will get out of it any time soon. I’ve been at home (with my parents only) since the 6th of March and I live literally in the middle of nowhere. I graduated in june and got accepted to the university, basically all via zoom. So all I could do for the three months was to sit around and study, couldn’t even meet with my friends and the rest of the family.<br />I struggled with depression in the past, but during this whole pandemic it all got a bit worse. But your videos really helped me to get out of my head and reconnect with my body. I tried some workouts, but I usually struggle to keep up with the girls in the videos. But when you say keep it going (usually while doing the plank pose haha) I do! It’s your kind voice that keeps the body going.<br />I just wanted to let you know, how much are your videos appreciated. I did last years 30 days journey by myself, but now I encouraged my friends to join me and they love tour videos too!<br />Really, thank you. It seems, that I will have to be at home for another semester, but now I have something to look forward to.<br />Hope you and your family are doing well!

"99% of the time my mind is at 99 mph. It’s nice to have a daily intervention with Adriene that says, “You do have a body, you know.”",Alejandro Rendon,2021-01-08T06:02:09Z,508

"There&#39;s a line from the book &#39;Microserfs&#39; by Douglas Coupland where a character refers to his body as a beat-up old Volkswagon he drives his brain around in, like a soccer mom. The older I get, the more I feel that is true; so hurrah for this intervention from YWA!",doglegmedia,2021-01-08T14:48:57Z,6
