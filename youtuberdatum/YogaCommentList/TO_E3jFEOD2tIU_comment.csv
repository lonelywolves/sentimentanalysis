Hi Adriene! I am practising in Melbourne Aus. It&#39;s been a year since you posted this video and I have only just come across it - sign fr the Universe I think!

"So I was just doing this video and I loved it &lt;3 But you know when things dont go as you wish at first and then you get rewarded? At first I was bummed as I suddenly had a problem with my laptop&#39;s earphone jack, when I remove the earphones the sound refuses to come out of the laptop, I never did a yoga workout with my earphones on. At first I felt a bit annoyed but I immediately calmed down with how soothing Adrienne&#39;s voice is but what I LOVED most is that by the end of the video I started hearing a repetitive sound which when I focused with, turned out to be HER HEARTBEATS!!! How awesome is that!! and am literally using the word to mean that I felt awed, be it for a moment, but I felt so happy and intensely connected!! there&#39;s a very special thing about the sound of a heartbeat that I cannot express but only feel! hope to know if anyone else noticed it but wow such a cute experience really! thank you Adrienne for everything you do! &lt;3 OOh and am practicing from Tunisia^^",Hajer Beddiafi,2021-03-18T18:55:39Z,0

"Gee I saw my posting from a few months ago down below.  Today the Abs and Sides got a great workover.  Arms did also, but not as noticeable as the core muscles.  Neck feels alot better.  The neck is another issue since there are bone spurs up and down the spine, but all of your sessions address the neck so its not as stiff as the lower back.

"This was a great practice for my Mothers Day here in England 🌺 low to the ground and super stretchy 😊 it’s the one where we transition to Sphinx Pose, beautiful and with grace, then to yummy Puppy Posture, feeling perfectly stretched 😁 So there was some core work and I admit to my senior version of forearm side planks to find what feels good 😉 and ending with some foot massage for some self love. Benji was so enjoying your soothing voice, so relaxing for us too, until our toe taps. Then he looked quite surprised and  ‘signed off’ in perfect Benji fashion with that beautiful stretch 😍 see you tomorrow for Day 15 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💕",Gill Smith,2021-03-14T09:23:56Z,16
"As I was doing this practice I struggled with the thought that if I’m not “feeling the burn, I’m not getting stronger”. I also though I am just lucky to be able to be on the mat today. <br /><br />I then thought, I need to express my gratitude to my yoga moms Gill and Adriene and all the other people in this community who inspire me to come back and be kind to myself. <br /><br />THANK YOU 🙏🏻",Laura Reed,2021-03-14T13:27:32Z,1

Hello from Seattle! I really REALLY needed this today. Yes my body said &quot;move!&quot; when I woke up. This period of COVID has forced so many changes. I was doing pretty well with the flow of it for a while but now I&#39;m starting to have some real despair and leaning on old unhelpful habits as this stretches on and on. I woke up ready to start turning things around so I&#39;m ready for what&#39;s next. THANK YOU for this practice. And YES Benji absolutely stole the show at the end. I had to watch it like 5 times 😂😍,Melanie Owen,2020-11-30T19:28:26Z,0

"DAY 2 of November’s calendar. I wrote on day 1 that this is the first thing I’ve been excited about in weeks. I lost interest in everything for a couple of weeks now. Today has felt different and I’m so glad.<br /><br />I feel a sense of me getting my power back. I FEEL empowered. I’m so grateful. When I move, I’m so amazed at what the body can do. I give God thanks for so much as I practice. I feel so much more grounded (hehehehe) than I have felt... in a while, actually. Like... months.<br /><br />And I need this armor as I create an intentional tool kit for the times ahead and just for my life’s ebbs and flows in general. I see countries going back into lockdown. Election Day here in the US is tomorrow.<br /><br />I need anything I can get to prepare me for any battle ahead.<br /><br />Thank you for facilitating change. As a coach and as I’ve self-coached myself, I’ve learned that the client showing up is what really matters and for that I’m proud of myself too for choosing change. 💕",,2020-11-02T17:36:31Z,2

"Good afternoon yoga family, Adriene this was one of my favorites.  I have been feeling stress and sorrow from multiple sources.  The practice today has helped me relieve the stress by balancing the sorrow with gratitude.  The foot tapping was exactly what I needed!  I have peripheral neuropathy and it is so rewarding to feel some sensation in those areas, even if it’s ancillary to the nerves primarily afflicted.  I feel great love for all of you in this community.  Namaste.  <br />Michael",Michael G,2020-08-25T01:02:51Z,0

"Like a lot of teachers in August 2020, I am facing some big changes and already feel drained with a school year that hasn’t even started yet. I spent all day making plans for lessons that will need to be adapted for distance learning. This practice today was completely needed. The change up to forearm plank threw me for a loop. I was expecting puppy posture and I don’t like forearm plank. But once I was in Sphinx pose, it was great. I was stronger in plank than I remembered, and that made the side planks kind of awesome. It’s about finding strength and growth in the changes and challenges in life.",sunraye1960,2020-08-11T21:48:11Z,0

"I was injured and could not do your class for months. Was so hard to start again so I picked this one (skipped the plank!). At first the rubbing feet part seemed ridiculous...but then it was such a weird, basic way of reconnecting to something that I got all chocked up. I mean choked up!  You know. Anyway I don&#39;t understand how but you are magic. Happy I can follow again; missed it. Thanks.",S J,2020-05-06T18:27:48Z,0

"Really needed this yoga practice this morning. I&#39;ve done this one before and even though I couldnt quite remember the practice exactly, I woke up with the title Change and Drain in my head and just knew this was the one for me this morning. <br /><br />The playful pitter-patter at the end was it for me. That brought me the smile that was hidden somewhere inside despite all of the crazy changes happening in my life right now, and currently the world&#39;s. <br /><br />I didnt think about it until now, maybe, rather, I didnt FEEL it until now. But we&#39;re all going through this together. We really are. We are connected despite was is going on. We are all connected.

"Dear Adriene,<br />I write to you a bit under the weather.  I noticed via Instagram, that you are too. Feel better friend. I hadn&#39;t gotten on the mat for a couple of days, and it showed in my attitude. But tonight I saw this practice on the March calendar. I skipped Shakti Flow (don&#39;t have that kind of energy ;)) and went here. When you busted out that surprise forearm plank. I got in it. Then you did the second forearm plank. And I layed there. A second went by and I thought &quot;Did I get on the mat or not? Have I not incorporated yoga into most everyday this year?&quot; So I got up and did the second plank with alternating stretches! Basically... thank you, for helping me instil persistence into my daily life. Wish you well friend, sorry for the long letter. Namaste",TMNTsamurai 84,2020-03-19T03:53:18Z,0

"Staying home in quarantine due to coronavirus, with all schools closed (I am a teacher) having to suddenly shift from working face to face with my students and pupils to working online and contacting them via Internet only has totally drained me - and it&#39;s been only 2 days.

My mum is a cancer survivor and I want to get her into some gentle routines as she suffers with alot of pain from the chemo and radiation.  She also suffers from anxiety and depression.  I am hoping you can do a gentle 10 to 15 minute routine targetted at floor exercises she could do?  I am sending her this video now - but she has issues with shoulders so plank is difficult, but she can do cat cow.  I think the way you talk and enjoy your routine will really help her.

"ADVICE WANTED: I just treated myself to a cork yoga mat, and I am completely unable to downward dog D,: 😨 even in extended child pose my feet are sliding out. I don&#39;t have much money and don&#39;t want the mat to go to waste. It is grounding and soft and such a relaxing colour. Aesthetically much nicer than my old mat. Does anyone have any advice please? ❤️❤️❤️❤️",omgitsthatrandomgal,2019-11-06T13:56:25Z,0
"​@omgitsthatrandomgal You are welcome! I have been practicing on a yoga towel spread over carpet and also need to moisten the surface slightly when doing any downward dog poses.<br /><br />A deeper clean could be just what you need to get a grippier surface! Happy breathing, Namaste.",K.C. Wilson,2019-11-20T13:40:46Z,1
K.C. Wilson thank you :) dampening my hands seems to be working and I will put some water and essential oil in an old perfume bottle as soon as I get the chance :) it&#39;s also occurring to me that it may need a deeper clean as it still smells like a factory. There may be loads of dust and grit in all the little crevasses causing it to be more slippy. Thank you again.,omgitsthatrandomgal,2019-11-20T12:08:45Z,0

Cork mats should be cleaned regularly (once a week) to prevent body oil buildup. The cork will be grippier when wet - have you tried spritzing with a spray bottle before starting practice?,K.C. Wilson,2019-11-06T15:35:09Z,0

"Hi! I did this practice a while back and absolutely loved it. I just tried again and hit a snag. I&#39;ve hurt my lower leg somehow – I don&#39;t know how, I had a sudden pain when I knelt down (not while doing yoga), like something tearing – it doesn&#39;t bother me when I&#39;m walking, but it was too painful when I tried to get on all fours, though cross-legged is fine. I don&#39;t want to stop my daily yoga practice, but I obviously need to steer clear of anything on my knees until it&#39;s healed. I wondered if you could recommend something I can do in place of this when following a practice, or if you could recommend some practices that don&#39;t require getting on your knees. It would be so much appreciated &lt;3  Thank you.",Joanne Amos,2019-05-07T20:31:50Z,0

"Hi Adriane and Benji, on the 16th my sweet dog Blai passed away. My family has been going through a lot of nasty changes in the past couple years and I never dealt with the emotions, rather, I kept them inside and let them eat away at me. I used to practice yoga a couple years ago but fell out of sync with it. Only just started it again and your sessions are so beneficial and they get me out of bed every morning. It’s a pleasuring seeing little Benji in the corner grumbling whenever you wake him up ahaha. Thank you for your wonderful lessons. -Grey",Elias Novak,2019-03-26T08:56:24Z,0

Hey Adriene. We love your work here in New Zealand. I have a request. My SNS nervous energy levels have been unbalanced lately (related to adrenalin or as you might call it Adrienelin haha)  deep breathing can help but since I love yoga I thought perhaps &#39;Yoga for Adrenalin Control&#39; could be useful...Thanks Ryan :),Ryan Curd,2019-03-15T01:52:13Z,0

I just finished doing this video and when you said doing something you may not want to do it made me want to share. I started a Dance fitness class at a dancestudio I go to . You go from doing two high energy dance routines to an intense ab work out<br /> as the cool down. And started to feel the affects of it which felt like anxiety but wasn&#39;t sure. didn&#39;t want to do yoga after having already worked out but thought  it&#39;s better to put a stop to it now rather then trying to ignore it. I&#39;m so glad I listened to my body rather then fighting against it because just doing that small bit of yoga made the biggest difference. Thankyou. My dog is always asleep near by lol,emily Janelle,2019-03-14T11:32:27Z,0

I&#39;ve been benefiting from your generosity for about 4 years now - you are my virtual yoga teacher - and this is one of my favourite videos....from the song that escaped early on (like the good ol&#39; days), to Benji melted on the mat, to the surprise forearm plank - love it!!

"Dear Adriene, dear all, whenever a practice resonates as much as this one, I just have to comment. I am moving into my 34th week of pregnancy now and slowly but surely it is physically more straining. I have loved the journey so far, but now the going gets tough at times. Also, I had my last day of work on Friday so I got all this time now to tend to myself and the baby, which is an amazing gift, but will also be an exercise of quieting down for me. <br />I supplemented forearm plank with dolphin and sphinx with Anahata Asana and in the end when Anahata was too long, I went for extended child&#39;s pose. <br />To all you beauties out there: Asana practice can support you every single day, no matter what your body feels like. Namaste to all from the Netherlands :* &lt;3",Christina B.,2019-03-11T08:01:57Z,0

"Although this was more of a simple practice than I was hoping for today, it centered me in a way I wouldn&#39;t have been if I&#39;d have gone straight into a sweaty practice, and this ended up being just what I needed in this moment! Came across a few new things here, as well as a bit of heat. I loved the last bit, really felt great to release some stuff here even if I didn&#39;t know I had stuff to release - definitely coming back to it when I need to. Thank you so much xx",Jasmine Ryan,2019-03-11T07:17:36Z,2

Getting back into my daily yoga practice has helped me handle my second semester of grad school with so much more ease than my last when I had forgotten to take care of myself.

"Dear Adriene, today I first created some space and then did this practice, and it felt just great.<br />a friend of mine asked me to do the dedicate challenge with her, and it was one of the best things that could have happened to me. I never thought yoga would be for me, but boy have I been wrong. Not only have I learnt to love my potatoe toes. Two years now I have been running around with backpain, that no physiotherapy could help. and now, after two months of yoga, I have realised the pain is coming from my hip and not the back, and I am essentially pain free. all thanks to you. you are amazing. I send lots of love out to you and everyone. Namaste",HannyHinny,2019-03-10T16:11:31Z,0

"Adriene, you MUST (not really) do a yoga for skateboarders video.  As a lifelong skateboarder and recent yoga convert/freak, nothing has helped me renew my body and improve my balance like combining a yoga practice w semi-regular skating.  I think if you examine the body mechanics at work in pushing, landing hard on the board, etc., the practice will come together.  Hope you don&#39;t mind the suggestion.  I think a lot of skaters would be open to it especially if it was introduced with even a passing familiarity w their world.

That forearm plank surprised me but I took the challenge and enjoyed it, then it melted into my favourite Sphinx pose which always feels so great, a mixture of power, stretch and a secure feeling fixed firmly to the ground, sooo good for my lower back. Even my side dips were a success today. Then relaxing into that extended child’s pose, breathing deep. My poor arthritic feet loved that foot massage, so thoughtful, beautiful. I wasn’t sure about the foot tapping but it had an amazing effect afterwards ! Thanks for all that fun Adriene, I am all set up for my day 👍🏻     🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💞",Gill Smith,2019-03-10T08:18:38Z,0

Thank you for this video!,Ashley Robinson,2019-03-10T07:21:32Z,0

"with me, I feel like something has changed with my way of feeling or thinking or reacting, and I dont always like what my daily life &quot;did&quot; to me, like not believing in myself, feeling extra lazy, or just looking in the mirror and not loving myself. this yoga today for me is to drain all those bad feelings and changing the way I think and maybe even a change in my style for a good chang to myself",Esty Brandes,2019-03-10T07:02:13Z,0

The surgery that this amazing <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23YWAdedicate"">#YWAdedicate</a> fam right here helped me strengthen from within to get through the scariest moments of my existence. The YWA fam was there for me in January, going into a nerve-wracking Pre-Op appt, and everyone was flooding me with warmth, light, and positive vibes.  Thank you for making a huge difference in this girls life, y&#39;all![<br /><br /> The most genuine of &quot;Thank you&quot;s to Adriene, [&amp; Benji🐶!] + the whole YWA crew❤ <br /><br />Xoxo<br />Love from Florida ❤🌴🌎",LadyPeters,2019-03-10T06:26:35Z,8

Yay!! Just what I need! I just moved from Virginia to Idaho which is a HUGE change and I don’t like change so hopefully doing this a couple of times will help me out.,The Strug Bus,2019-03-10T06:12:02Z,1
LadyPeters Thank you so much ❤️ This was such a nice thing to wake up to. I’ll take your advice and try to just let whatever happens happen. ❤️,The Strug Bus,2019-03-10T14:26:22Z,0
"You got this girl! Sending you positive good vibes your way! 🙏🏼 I&#39;ve literally moved house 11 times in my adult life, haha, just take it slow, and roll with the challenges as they come. You are stronger than you think! Just like Adriene is sayin in this vid &quot;How do we react to challenges like this&quot;? And you got it, hun! Xoxo ❤🤗",LadyPeters,2019-03-10T06:30:24Z,1
"I used to have this tendency to resist change and always compare myself to others in the process untill i listened to an eye opening speech by Tony Robbins, explaining the method of connecting the dots when you look back at a change that has happened. I&#39;m glad to say that i now gladly embrace drastic changes and never give in to compare myself to anyone but me in the mirror.  Really missed the Sunday morning hoga videos this past week. Saving the day with a beautiful practice as always now aren&#39;t we. Thank you for the love Adriene. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-03-10T06:11:38Z,11
@Laura Johnson I unfortunately do not remember what its name is given that i listened to it three years ago when i first moved from the city to the village i&#39;m currently living in. I think i looked up &quot;how to deal with an emotional crisis from drastic change&quot; here on youtube and randomly came across that video.  I apologize for not being that helpful.,Shadan Zahrooni,2019-03-10T09:10:55Z,0
