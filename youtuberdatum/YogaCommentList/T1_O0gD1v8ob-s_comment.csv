pro tip : you can watch series on Flixzone. Been using them for watching all kinds of movies during the lockdown.,Bjorn Oliver,2021-04-30T22:28:21Z,0
"Yeah. I had a pretty unplesant and, to be quite honest, very stupid situation with my closest person today. I want to let go of the feelings it has brought me. It&#39;s easier to resolve problems when you aren&#39;t too emotional about them. Thank you, Adriene, for helping me keep my emotions more in check with your practices!",Diana,2021-02-05T18:12:07Z,0

"I just “let go” of my boyfriend last night. He is an amazing man and I love him so much, but our values and religions were so different we weren’t going to work out. One of the hardest nights in my life but I felt the universe support me this morning through this practice. <br /><br />Couldn’t have been fined more perfectly for me. I told myself I need to keep loving myself.",backwardglances,2021-03-23T12:22:18Z,1

"This practise has been a positive , life enhancing new thing in my rather anxious, too self aware life during lockdown. I finally feel myself remembering the positions and that calm &amp; strong &#39;in control feeling&#39; outside of the mat. It is a massive free gift which is much appreciated.",anna chipch,2021-03-11T18:39:05Z,0

"I&#39;m emotional as I end this practice today. I was very aware, during the practice, how much stronger I am now than I was when I started this journey in January 2021 with the Breathe practice. I am now finishing the Home practice that is sprinkled with Ardriene&#39;s Sunday Love Letter practices and feeling more centered and alive than I have in a long time. I am taking the &quot;What works for you - What makes you happy&quot; into my whole life and feeling my way into coming home to who I am. Thank you so much.",Debra Schooley,2021-03-05T12:01:45Z,2

"Today was extraordinary. I had a really tough time and the day before yesterday, I couldn&#39;t really get into the practice until it was nearly over. After having slept horribly I had such a hard time getting up and feeling motivated today.<br /><br />Then I sat down on my mat, started the video and suddenly was full of joy and excited for the practice and smiling like an idiot.<br /><br />I have never felt so confident, so in line with my body, so enthused like during today&#39;s practice. Whenever Adriene said &quot;You got this&quot; I heard my self repeating - and believing! - I got this!<br /><br />It was beautiful. Thank you Adriene.<br />I also suddenly realized during today&#39;s practice, that after 26 days, I can&#39;t imagine my life without my daily yoga practice anymore. So grateful I got Breath to look forward to right after this.<br /><br />Again, thank you, Adriene, for changing my life and taking me along on this beautiful ride. ❤️",SingenStatt Atmen,2021-03-02T12:51:41Z,0

I want to keep the excitement of finally being able to transition from cobra to plank... no having to do half plank or table top to downward dog... oh my God... for the first time today I was able to push up to plank and ease myself down slowly... today felt amazing. Thank you for this amazing practice Adriene. ❤,Jacki Siddall,2021-02-26T12:31:42Z,6
Day 26 today just 3 more days to go. Noo I completed dis b4 midnyt. I just commented late well 15 minutes late dat is. But hey I done it okay 😂🤗😊👊💯💯,Blue Queen,2021-02-26T11:16:20Z,3
"Every time Adriene asks us to release something, my mind immediately goes to anger I have toward someone or something. Doing Breath, and now Home, I feel so much lighter in mind and body -- releasing that which no longer serves me, my anger. This has been such a painful past 11 months since my area&#39;s original lockdown in March 2020. I just want to release, release, release!",Elle B,2021-02-25T13:23:53Z,8

"I honestly started this challenge a few months ago and I have had some times where I just haven’t felt like I had the time to do it so it’s taking me such a long time to complete. But today, after probably a few weeks of doing nothing (except work and doing homework), I finally did this one and I’m so glad I did. I love the way yoga makes me feel but it’s just so hard for me to start sometimes. I have every intention of finishing this journey and starting another. Thank you Adriene",Aleyna N,2020-12-09T07:10:40Z,1

"Loved today&#39;s practice... I realize that day after day even with regular practice, my hamstrings are always tight at the beginning of &quot;class&quot; and I think I just have to come to terms with having tight hamstrings. That&#39;s how my body is... However, I did have one awesome improvement: when in upward facing dog, I could feel my core support my position, coming from my low belly, my sides... After over ten years of on and off practice, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve felt that level of support in that pose, rather than relying on my low back. Win!!!",Emily Beauchamp,2020-11-26T13:31:39Z,1

"So, I started the Home Journey in January along it came out and although not daily, kept doing it whenever I could. Then I fell off and stopped doing yoga for about 3 - 4 months. Today I was really feeling like I owed myself to take care of me, and so I did this practice. And I couldn&#39;t be happier nor it couldn&#39;t have been a more appropriate one. Reminding myself to keep the good things (like yoga practice) and let go of those that are not. Also, at the end, Adriene kept repeating that this was a DAILY practice, and we should be proud to be doing it daily, I honestly laughed at it being an ironic joke. And that&#39;s okay. So thank you, and Namaste   🙏🏼💖",catalinarojasr99,2020-10-19T04:36:05Z,0

"Thank you, Adriene, for all the yoga days, even one for golfers! I have been enjoying these since March  when corona struck. A little tip I learned  when teaching aerobics many years ago. Since your students are looking at you directly and not from behind, it is a mirror image. Therefore, when you move your left leg or arm, you should say «right» so your students won’t be confused. And when you move the right side, you say  «left». Hope you like this tip. It is hard and awkward for you in the beginningg but you will  quickly get used to saying the opposite.",Gail Sætre,2020-08-27T10:00:09Z,0

Coming to channels such as this that promote peace and love for ones self and others. And then the media that encourages hate and other not-to-mentions.

"This is one of those practices that I wish went on forever... with the state of the world right now being able to just have even just the smallest moment of time to check in with myself and my breath brought me into a whole new mentality. I dedicated my strength and my stillness to all of the black americans today, living in fear and suffering every day wondering if even the most innocuos act could get them killed by the very institution created to protect them. And to all of the protestors fighting for freedom currently being treated like animals by that very same institution. This practice reaffirmed my willpower to fight for them and continue to support every rally, sign every petition, and conciously vote in every local election until we make this country safe for black americans.

"Hi Adriene!  First, thank you so much for your wonderful mission of bringing yoga into the homes.  Yoga is something that has been important to me for a long time now and as a mother and teacher, it&#39;s not realistic for me to have a membership to a studio (although I do miss in person classes).  You are such a great teacher and for the first time in all my years of practice, I truly feel like I&#39;m just now scratching the surface of what a yoga practice means.  Thank you.  I&#39;m nearing the end of my 30 day Home journey with you and I don&#39;t want to lose my momentum.  Perhaps you discuss this in your later videos, but I was wondering where you would suggest going from here?  I don&#39;t want to jump into another 30 day journey just yet, however, I&#39;d love to do another series with you.  Which would be best to build on what we learned in Home?

"Thankyou so much Adrienne. This was one of my favourite practises in Home! Triangle is a favourite and standing splits makes me recognise how strong I&#39;ve become on this journey. I wasn&#39;t even too grumbly about the plank today!🤣 I&#39;ve loved your classes since I discovered them about 3 yrs ago. I haven&#39;t managed a daily practise until now though (helped by lockdown and which has helped me greatly during this time) I&#39;ll be a bit lost once I finish this but I&#39;m hoping to continue with a daily practise. I&#39;d best start looking through your videos to choose one. If anyone has any suggestions on what would go well after competing this I&#39;d be grateful to hear them. Above all I wanted to say a huge thankyou Adrienne, you&#39;ve helped a lot of people get through a difficult time, and of course before this too.

We&#39;re going to meet the same time next week for another YWA session! ☺️",Melody Woodham,2020-04-15T19:22:12Z,0

It has also enabled me to be more mindful about my posture throughout the day. I&#39;m looking forward to continue hopefully with daily yoga after this month has passed! (especially since my body still needs some movement although I may be mainly cooped up in my home!) Thanks so much for your calming and loving guidance Adriene.

"I`m still pretty new to yoga. I decided a while ago that i should find a yoga challenge to see if I could stick with it for a month, and i found these videos! since starting this journey i feel like a new person. literally everything physical in my life feels easier and better to do! The real reason I wanted to comment though was because today, with this video, I had a breakthrough. I was born with missing a toe on my right foot. One in a hundred thousand kids are born missing a toe, and typically along with that they are usually missing their tibula or the fibula meaning that they can`t walk. I was a lucky kid (one in a million statistically) that i had both of those bones, but instead of having a ball and socket ankle joint my ankle is fused and I`m missing a ray of bones in my right foot. my  foot is a full shoe size smaller than my left, and my right leg is about an inch shorter than my left. when i was young i had a surgery to take out the growth plate on my left leg so my right could grow and catch up. whenever you say to center on all four corners of your feet i can`t on my right foot. it feels like i have two and a half corners to balance on. today when we were balancing on our right leg and lifting our left I did it! while i was doing it i thought &quot;Man, this feels good, but it`s gonna SUCK on my right leg!&quot; and then i realized i was balancing ON my right leg! I damn near started crying i was so proud of myself.<br />Thank you so much for your positive energy in your videos!  yoga is my favorite part of my day now<br /><br /><br />...I love your dog",Jillian Meatzie,2020-02-28T19:13:58Z,0

"This is the first tie I felt emotional on the mat. I suffer from triplicate anxiety (social, paranoid and general) and today is BAD. My brain is my own enemy. The mat has become a safe space for me now though, so instead of robbing me of motivation and making want to give up my anxiety drove me here. And this was the best practice for me today. Dealing with a mental health condition isn&#39;t as easy as deciding to let go of something and to keep something else, my brain chemistry doesn&#39;t work like that, but the idea of letting go helped tremendously. I might not be able to let go of my mental health condition, but I can let go of the expectation that I need to appear &quot;Fine&quot; when I&#39;m not. That expectation is not serving me. I&#39;m taking a mental health day now, thank you Adriene",Mellie Eggo,2020-02-06T15:24:54Z,0

During this practice I asked myself what was the things that worked  and not for me again. Well it confirmed how I&#39;ve been feeling about it. I couldn&#39;t be wrong 😉. You don&#39;t wonder about anymore. It strengthens brainpower and builds a firm foundation. Thank you very much for this day 26. I dont complete the program yet but I miss it already.,Fanfan MentalistFictions,2020-02-04T00:58:36Z,0

I was very depressed the past week and then I got sick with gastroenteritis so I missed the last days of the practice but I’m back! I’m gonna end this 30 days challenge even if it took a bit more days to do so. I’m very happy to be back on my mat. And I’m very proud that I’m making efforts. <br />I’m gonna be okay because I’m gonna act for it. <br />Have a nice day everyone 🌻💕🌱,Noémie,2020-02-02T09:47:13Z,0

I had to have a procedure right in the middle of this 30 day journey, so I&#39;m still at it! I love the way these practices build upon each other.

"On this practice, I am reminded of a saying from the Tao Te Ching: &quot;It is that they never hold on to success, so that they never lose it.&quot; I think anything we try to hold on to comes from a place of unknowing ourselves; that we have that thing but we&#39;ve been convinced that it is outside of us. Alan Watts once observed that the objects of our possession become the source of our evil; be it money, love or anything. Because sometimes we will do things against our own nature to keep them. But to let it be lets it flourish and circulate throughout the universe. That which comes to us will leave, and so I have everything when I keep nothing. Namaste 🙏",Jay-Ram Rajendra,2020-01-29T19:07:49Z,3
"I always love some good yoga. But especially when I&#39;m feeling stressed/on the verge of a panick attack, like I felt today.

"I am always in love with the version of my self that makes it all the way to the end of your routines, Adriene. Every time I tell myself: See how great you feel? It was worth it!

Although my left leg shook a lot, but I am sure it&#39;ll be better the next time. Thank you, Adriene. Lots of love to you &lt;3",Noha Basiouny,2020-01-29T06:37:58Z,0

"I stayed a bit longer in the shavasana pose, followed by the cobbler&#39;s pose. It felt pretty good not getting up just after the video ended. I tried to keep grounded as best as I could, especially since the practice was a bit too fast for me. It&#39;s crazy how some notions or vocabulary if you like can get lost during your practice. I noticed that it tended to happen quite a lot with me. I also tend to do and/or remain in a pose in a certain way although it&#39;s not working for me despite all my efforts. I will stop at times but I need to remind myself that it&#39;s okay to make it different if it works for *m*e instead of pushing some strength and being stubborn.<br /><br /><br />Also, I didn&#39;t have any trouble going into downward dog, today. That is a victory! YAY!!!",Sarah S.,2020-01-28T21:52:16Z,0

"Adriene, You are a faithful teacher and guide. Thank you for encouraging me to keep going, to stay present with my breath, to remember my alignment, and to remember to soften. Strangely these subtle mindful practices are cultivating strength in me physically and energetically. I really, really like how you guide us to tend to and be mindful of our soul. Today’s practice, “Keep” kept me connected to all my systems, because I needed them, my core, my breath, and my inner strength. I had to bring it all.  I am being challenged on many levels, and I am SO grateful for this Journey. I feel as though I am not only journeying home, but I also sense parts of me are being resurrected.<br /><br />For instance, after doing Day 24 - Focus, I looked at my iPad and wondered “When did the background wallpaper turn orange?”  It was ALWAYS orange! <br /><br />Thank you again Adriene, for reaching out, and reaching, in. <br /><br />Much Love to You!<br />Nickolet",Nickolet Allen,2020-01-28T06:49:13Z,0

"Today&#39;s theme resonated deeply for me. For years I have been struggling with a very strong inner critic that comes out any time I feel I&#39;ve done something wrong. Especially this week I spent hours getting down on myself. This practice was a reminder that being critical and hateful towards myself is not serving me, and it&#39;s something I want to continue to let go of more and more. It will not make me a &quot;better&quot; person to keep this pattern of self-punishment. I loved this fun flow too and will definitely be saving this one to do many times in the future!

"This Monday was a very emotionally exhausting one at work. I got home late and this is the latest I’ve practiced all month. But wow am I glad I did, because my soul and my heart feel so refreshed. <br /><br />Also tonight I realized that, after having several months of pain in the back of my right heel last year, it hasn’t bothered me in at least several days. I was giving myself a post-practice foot massage and went towards that heel expecting to find tenderness as I have for a long time, but I didn’t. Suddenly I’m realizing I don’t remember the last day I felt pain there. I can only assume daily practice has contributed, as I have also noticed a significant increase in flexibility in my ankles. Whatever nerve or tendon that was giving me trouble there seems to have been eased also! Woohoo!",Rachel A,2020-01-28T04:00:15Z,0

Today was a very numb day for me the fear and depression from yesterday seemed to suck the life out of today. (TMI warning) Yesterday I found my pet in a puddle of bloody urine which scared the crap out of me. We took her to the vet today and got her medicine to hopefully help her. But I’m just so emotional exhausted and numb. Yoga gives me the space to just be and let go of everything. Yoga really helps recharge my emotional and mental batteries so to speak.

I woke up 30 minutes earlier at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0gD1v8ob-s&amp;t=4m50s"">4:50</a>, right away had a lovely meditation and afterwards practiced sun salutation. This first day was as I wanted it to be so I believe it’s a great, strong beginning of the new chapter in my life. Today I really found what feels good on my mat and even though my mind wondered a little bit I still stayed focused on sensations and breath. I’ll keep going and see where this road goes",Kristin St,2020-01-28T03:36:44Z,1

Thank you Adriene! Having this routine and practice to start off the usually glum winter/post holidays is something truly special! Day 26 was a good one :) I don&#39;t think your followers could ever express all of the roller coasters of life that you help get them through. You are a gem.

"I found your channel because I was really struggling emotionally after Kobe Bryant&#39;s death and I wanted to find some way to honor him. I decided that 24 minutes of yoga and meditation, in honor of his number 24, was a good way to practice emotional awareness and center myself. I&#39;m trying to do things with that #24. 24 pushups in the morning and evening. A 24-minute run. 24 minutes of yoga. I guess I won&#39;t always get the exact minute total right, but I&#39;ll definitely be coming back to your videos. Thank you for helping center me today.",James Kurland,2020-01-28T02:54:26Z,6

"Ive always struggled with the low lunge. I feel like my knee doesn’t fit between my arms, if that makes any sense. On a recommendation of a friend/yoga teacher, I picked up some yoga blocks, and it was life changing! Low lunge feels doable, and even downward dog feels better. Now when you say to shift the weight forward and squeeze that knee in, I can do it. Longwinded way to say, Im keeping my yoga blocks. ☺️",christine hayes,2020-01-28T02:18:58Z,0

"Day 26 keep our appointments of love and self care to ourselves, we deserve it. The last few practices I had either came to the mat with a rushed energy or maybe I should leave this practice for tomorrow taught but I never gave into them I still got on the mat daily and practice no matter how late it was and that really reinforces the commitment I made to myself when I started my yoga journey and that was to be consistent and dedicated  even when I had a bad day or when I wanted to quit and today&#39;s practice really reminded me of it and I found ease with a busy mind and that is what I am grateful for today. I had some bone pain cause I have been showering late and I just finished today&#39;s practice and it is literally no longer there, like what Adriene always say, I got the blood flowing and everything else  found that ease, thank you Adriene for another amazing experience today much love and Namaste Everyone and goodnight 💞💗💓💖❤🙏",Vanessa Morris,2020-01-28T01:42:27Z,0

"Because of you Adriene, I trained as a yoga teacher two years ago. I fell out of love with personal practice for a while because I felt like I was getting all the exercise I needed in class, and because of PTSD and trauma it was very difficult for me to connect emotionally to my own home practice. This is the first time in a long time that I have done yoga for myself every day. This week has been tough for me, largely because of my PTSD, but I stayed connected. Today I taught a class themed around vulnerability, and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable. I&#39;ve not felt such connection and love in a room in a long time.

I keep thinking ‘what is it about this challenge that keeps me coming back each day?’  I think it’s so many things - Adriene herself - she has a warm; welcoming approach to yoga and I feel supported by her; the daily moments of quiet on the mat and knowing that I continue to grow in strength - inside and out.

"Wow, this practice was so weird for me! But definietly in a good way. My day was exhausting and I felt tired-drunk. So I decided to flow and let my body take control for the first time ever... And it was amaizing!! The poses were easier and more organic, I wasn&#39;t wobblng in any of the planks and even managed to almost not fall on my belly going down from them! I also had gentle sway almost all of the time :D  My perfectionist side usually takes the lead in yopa and I try to be VERY precise so today was a new one.

"Honestly, I’ve taken up two ‘physical’ challenges this month, and although the home journey has been far more mental and somewhat relaxing comparatively, I am SO burnt out. I’m finding myself wishing the time away and for the 30 days to be up already. However, every single time I come back to the mat, I finish thinking “I’m so glad I did this, I want to do this every day”. I just wish I wasn’t so exhausted, but hey...there’s time to do things more gradually and gently once this is over. I’m proud that I’ve made it this far considering the break in my yoga practice was years long and I went straight into this. Love it!",Taylor Parris,2020-01-27T20:47:01Z,0

Today I figured something out! I realised that it’s ok to have to pause the video if I need to catch my breath. It’s ok to take that moment and recenter my mind and intention. It’s ok that I’m starting my third year of yoga every day and still not able to do a full chataranga because maybe one day I will be able to do it. Until then I’ll keep moving this body and enjoy the small changes I feel and the muscles that ache the next day 👌🏻,Sam Cummings - Writer,2020-01-27T19:44:43Z,1

"Adriene, from my home to yours, I&#39;d like thank you for your joyful and open approach to yoga!<br />The first time my back gave out I was around 10 and it came back once I got older. In August I spent 3 weeks sleeping on the floor, as I couldn&#39;t stand the bed. In the first week, it took me 30minutes of stretches to be able to stand. And then... That even didn&#39;t help. It took a professional  5 hours! Just to get me on my feet. Since then, I dabbled here and there in some yin yoga, but never really committed and have had a permanent back ache. These last weeks have been an improvement. My back is still sore, but now the majority of the time, the pain is gone.<br />Thank you!<br />For further steps after these 30 days, would you recommend using your previous 30 sessions? Will your session x deal with how to proceed further?<br /><br />Also, first time I&#39;ve commented on anything youtube, so congrats for getting me this far 😉",Guy Diels,2020-01-27T19:40:48Z,0

I can complete todays practice! one breathe, one second, one minute at a <a href=""http://time.how/"">time.How</a>, great I felt with letting go of the notion of perfection and comparison and being present within myself,  Loving myself right were I am, with the knowledge ,I  am truly strengthened my mind,body and spirit, with each breath of inhalation and exhalation, wobbling, modifying, this is truly good. I am truly Blessed, this feels good to know this without wobbling, staggering on how Blessed I am. In the mist of all which has taken place in my lives,  and of the world , I know God is good.

"This journey has been challenging in part because often I have the freedom to pick  up to two yoga sequences with Adriene per day because they fit my time and schedule and self-assessed  requirements! But in this journey it&#39;s more that I need to try to accomplish each day if possible because daily yoga makes a difference to me. In fact, I have managed to catch up a few times  because I could not do one per day. It has been extremely helpful though in my learning with this  journey HOME to look at the overall picture rather than the individual details.

"I want to let go of my habit of overthinking! It leads me to to unnecessary actions and thoughts. This 30 day yoga challenge has really been helping me start to take control of my life and create a huge sense of self.

"Thank you for this practice! This whole journey has been a wonderful outlet for me and has really heightened my mindfulness. <br />I noticed that was able to get into the shape of Pyramid pose but I remembered the work we&#39;ve done around <b>not</b> collapsing into our standing leg and I realized that I was totally collapsed. I felt that way even when both feet were on the ground - if it feels like this when my hands are touching the ground in Pyramid, would it be helpful to use a block to bring the floor up to my hands until I can reach the floor with my hands without collapsing into my standing leg/hip?",Maureen Brabec,2020-01-27T17:43:07Z,0

"Today was rough for me. My body is really not doing great atm, I have tons of joint pain and no answers why they‘re there and how to ease them. A lot of the poses today were hard on my wrists and shoulders. Yet I‘m trying to use this practice to find acceptance for what I can‘t change while using the pain as a signal for me to take action. If anyone has any advice on joint pain without an apparent cause and yoga please let me know",Renae May,2020-01-27T17:33:17Z,0

Good morning YWA community!  I’m glad I switched to night shift today because I didn’t realize how much better it feels to do yoga in the morning to start the workday off right.,Darren Knox,2020-01-27T17:10:35Z,0
"I notice that I keep repeating myself about all this yoga awesomeness I’m getting from this practice!  People, not only does it help you physically (even though I still get sore, but it’s a good sore), I’m noticing how much better I am about expressing my love and showing it  in different ways, especially to my husband, whom I thought I could never love more!  He’s so enthused, he’s starting to practice as well!  It’s true that seniors can fall deeper in love than you would ever think possible!  After 34 years, we’ve even deepened our relationship further with the yoga practice and studies!  My only chagrin, is that I didn’t start this practice, in earnest, years ago!  I fell several times today, BUT I managed to do it and I’m going to repeat it tomorrow!  🙏 from the bottom to the top of my heart!",cathy hollaway,2020-01-27T17:10:21Z,314

And deciding what to keep and what to let go of really is a process and not an overnight kind of thing, but what I can say with absolute certainty is that daily yoga practice is definitely something I&#39;m going to keep ♡ It&#39;s been so good for my mind, my body and my spirit.

"I love the fact that thousands of people are practicing when I&#39;m practicing (I checked today and it was close to 2,200 people!). I live in a very isolated rural mountain area and to go to a yoga studio takes at least an hour&#39;s drive - if the roads are even passable, in winter. It means so much to have this community to practice with. Thank you for helping me stay strong and manage sadness and frustration about my location.

"Adriene, I wanted to let you know I found your channel probably 1.5-2 years ago. At first I couldn’t really do more than 10 minutes. And I’d hardly follow along with your videos. And I did them quite randomly. But I’ve been faithfully practicing your, Find what feels good, mentality about it and not pushing myself (a rarity for me!!). In that process I’ve slowly worked up to doing one of your yoga videos every single weekday morning. It’s now part of my daily routine. I can now stick with you the entire 20-25 minutes (20 minutes is the best length in my opinion, FYI) and I usually take the upgrades or challenge you suggest with easy. I mainly do it to feel good mentally. Because when I start my day with blood flowing and walking away standing up straight, I live my day with that. Thank you for that gift! 🙏 I’ll continue to be a faithful subscriber and viewer. If you want to use any of that for a testimonial, feel free. I’m a content creator too (search for Sarah Dale Brave Love TV) so I understand the importance of testimonials! ☺️ Awesome work on this channel.

"This was an interesting session, because I wasn&#39;t working with my usual mat and I had to find other ways to move my body and struggle less. I managed to find grace.<br />What I did notice, though, is that I, once again, focused on the shape rather than the sensation. As soon as I was standing in that standing split and thought &quot;I&#39;m doing it!&quot;, I collapsed. Good reminder and humility lesson 🙏💙",Rianne Cabanier,2020-01-27T10:25:21Z,65

"Day 25 — Unwind was perfect yesterday! I was feeling sick, so I had a hard time showing up at all. But lucky for me yesterdays practice was a gentle one, combined with Reunite the Breath, it was excellent! ❤️<br /><br />Day 26 - Keep was a challenge as I&#39;m still not feeling well. Feel basically the same as yesterday, but it went alright. Execpt for the last balance on the left leg, there&#39;s still some work to do. But compared to the start strength increased a lot and there&#39;s so much more balance. It&#39;s good to see improvement! 💪🏻<br /><br />Namaste world! 🙏🏻",Deborah,2020-01-27T07:06:48Z,27
