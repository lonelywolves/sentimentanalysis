"Dear Adriene, thanks for the wake up call as always! I usually practice to audio directions only, only looking at the video when I need. I was wondering recently if your vocal quality has gone deeper and different in the videos released in 2021? (Not criticism, just observation). People&#39;s voices change over time, and I thought it was just my imagination with breath, but the last 4 videos, esp this one have had deeper tone and sentence pacing that are difficult to follow audio only and not as engaging for me personally.   Just an observation - I have my favorite videos that I&#39;ll return to often and will keep trying new ones!",Vasundhara Sridharan,2021-05-06T13:19:36Z,0

"Hey, I&#39;m in love with your monthly yoga challenges. Amazing content and quite easy to follow. <br /><br />I just had a request. Can you please make videos on yoga for menstruation or yoga to do when we menstruate and don&#39;t feel like showing up on the mat? <br /><br />Because I have been skipping the days of the yoga challenges when my cycle starts and sometimes the procrastination of not doing yoga lasts for more than 7 days. <br /><br />It would have been really helpful if you made videos on easy yoga to do when you menstruate. <br /><br />Sending you Love,<br /><br />Adrita",Adrita Majumder,2021-05-06T08:07:16Z,1

"I am here today, I want to thank Adriene for guidance into a strong core. I changed climates and now in the hot humid South India where I underestimated the lax state of muscles and pull my right pec with some back muscles. I have been doing my own thing so to speak - rolling out mat and doing what I remember without engaging top part of the body, new challenge. Its been difficult to roll in bed and lie down and get up until I realised that my core is strong and working like never before and I can just use that. That&#39;s an amazing achievement. Here I am having done this practice and enjoyed it with no problems while letting the chest and arms relax and only focus on the core and down. Thank you Adriene once again! Hope you guys are doing well. I am going to be not following the monthly playlist as I need to follow my body in the new climate and let my body recover, so I will do what I can&#39;t handle every day❤️",Elvira Byrnes,2021-05-05T14:02:56Z,0

"I&#39;ve always been a super unsportive person and core strength has always been one of my biggest weaknesses. I&#39;ve started BREATH mid-March and I&#39;ve been doing yoga almost every day ever since but I was still kind of terrified of today&#39;s practice. However: to my surprise, I actually didn&#39;t struggle that much. Didn&#39;t even have to take that many breaks in between. I have never been able to go through with a 12 minute core workout and not feel absolutely awful afterwards but here I am, feeling strong, energized and having no idea what happened that made me genuinely enjoy a core practice for the first time in my life xD",Josephine Oess,2021-05-04T05:17:25Z,2
"Core, yeah I thought this is going to be tough.   Going along coping and then Adriene tells us to sit up but must also bring up the left leg.  Right I got this.  But.... didn&#39;t have it.

"Wow! Full disclosure, I almost chose a different practice when I saw that today&#39;s was core. I am a mom of 8 and after having had my abdominal muscles stretched beyond recognition all of those times, core work is normally very disheartening to me. But I was able to complete this practice with little modification. What a boost! Thanks Adriene.",Shana Page,2021-05-04T01:01:07Z,3
"Phew! And yet, so great to be able to do this core session. When I first started doing occasional yoga sessions with Adriene a few years ago, my core strength was jelly all the way down and any core work had me on my back, stuck like a bug. And now its fun to feel my inner support engage and my legs and arms be free to join in. So to all folks who are new here and feeling like jelly, don&#39;t worry, do what you can (just like Adriene says!) and it truly is all good.",Ruth Halbert,2021-05-04T00:42:18Z,1

I may not have the best form when taking most of these moving poses...but damnit I did it! Day 123 of YWA. You&#39;re spoken about in my home like a trusted and valued friend quite often. As someone who doesn&#39;t have a typical yoga body (I&#39;m very plump and round) you have given me the confidence to continue to try. And when I can put my body into 90% of these poses and the other 10% woth modifications I feel like I can do anything. 2021 I have felt a major confindence boost this year.<br />Thank you Adriene❤,vittutatapaska,2021-05-03T17:54:49Z,0

"Thank you Adriene for this yoga practice. You’ve helped me in becoming more flexible over the last 3 years. I have been following you for the last 5 years. I was the girl who everyone compared their child to saying that you don’t want to eat too much or you’ll end up looking like Irene (fat &amp; ugly). I was quite hard on myself in wanting to look a certain way and then I came across your channel. Where the first video I watched of yours is where you explain that you’ve done yoga for about 15 years and when you started off you couldn’t even sit in sukashana properly. So I decided to go and follow your 1st ever 30days of yoga series and although I missed some days I Completed the series and have been hooked to your warm and welcoming personality.<br /><br />I just wanted to write this love letter to you Adriene, to say 🙏🏽 <br />I am not yet at the weight I want to be yet but I am happy with my progress. I have gone from being 207lbs to 147lbs at a slow pace, but have learned to love my journey and appreciate what I’ve been able to accomplish.<br /><br />So thank you Adriene for being the sweet and welcoming rock that guides us in our daily practice <br /><br />Love <br />Irene Victor",Irene Victor,2021-05-03T16:05:10Z,1

I imagine she  has helped you a lot with being loving and compassionate to yourself.   That is one of the hardest lessons to learn, isn&#39;t it?   I have just found Adrienne at age 77.

"@Gill Smith I do enjoy having too many seedlings - and giving them away!  I am amazed at myself.  People tell me I have green fingers but I don&#39;t feel that knowledgeable!  The greenhouse is a real boon.  I think we may need to resort to systemic weed killers for our three (main!) pests.  Yes, both yoga and gardening bring a lot of joy - we are very blessed!  Much love x",Liz Beardmore,2021-05-04T10:39:04Z,1
"Liz, thank you so much for your msg. You are a market garden ! What an achievement from a year or so ago. I remember you clearing your wild garden, quite a challenge. You must be very proud I am amazed well done. I have had a greenhouse in the past but not now and have had to deal with the three pests you mention only dealt with a systemic weed killer carefully on each one. My garden in comparison is a flower garden, small with a palm tree, shrubs, ferns, perennials and curvy edged lawn and pond with overstocked enthusiastic fish ! I have strawberries between and struggling to grow us globe artichokes in the border, successfully in the past but not this time I think 😢 I love that our gardening along with our yoga is keeping us fit and sane 🧘🏼‍♀️🌿🌸🌿🥕 sending love 💕",Gill Smith,2021-05-04T09:27:28Z,0
"@Gill Smith brambles like to pop up here and there but basically dealt with. It&#39;s the lesser celandine and ground elder that are a big problem in the garden. At the moment, in my veggie beds there are: new potatoes, maincrop, broad beans, spring onions, onions, carrots and radishes, also a few remaining cabbage and leek. I&#39;ve also got strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and gooseberries.  In the greenhouse: tomato, cucumber, pepper, more radish, lettuce, sunflower, aubergine and nastertium germinating, also loofah and Chinese bean (from a Chinese friend of mine). So grateful for the rain - not to happy with the strong winds! Our rainwater tank had to be filled up with mains water a few weeks ago!  Sounds like quite a lot when  I write it down.

"Adriene,  I  feel compelled to write to you after this week&#39;s newsletter. <br><br><br>I live in Bangalore (India) and have spent the last 10 days accompanied mainly by the siren of ambulances as they drive past. Each time I hear it, I find the alarm unnerving and can&#39;t help thinking of those that are struggling for help across India. I have oscillated between feeling moments of deep sadness and trying to build a routine for myself to maintain some semblance of normalcy. I was feeling low yesterday when I saw your newsletter, and broke down on reading it. I offer you deep gratitude for calling attention to the crisis in India and mobilizing support for us. Trusting myself and breath, and building community are strong lessons I have learnt this year and the Yoga with Adriene community were a big part of that learning process. Thank you again, and here&#39;s hoping for this storm to pass quickly and for all of us to find comfort and healing in ourselves and our practice.",Divya Titus,2021-05-03T06:32:31Z,309

"@insert a cool name Hello~!!! Yes, actually after DAY 16 or so, the body felt GREAT and adjusted to new moves like a river. I think it is fine if you simply &quot;find what feels good&quot; and work with different videos depending on what your body needs or wants. Does that make sense?",Patrick T.

"Hey, i have just started my yoga journey. I finished 30days of yoga with adriene and are doing the revolution series now. Would you mind, if i ask you to suggest me which playlist I should do next?<br><br>And also, do you see any difference physically? I know i have seen a huge difference in me the past 56days. I was really curious to know how others might feel. Thankhou",insert a cool name,2021-05-03T07:17:19Z,0
