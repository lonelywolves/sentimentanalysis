"I feel like a new human today&#39;s practice 🥰 Plus something crazy happened! <br />Normally I hesitate to bend forward in staff pose because I get a pain under my right shoulder blade...<br /><br />But today for some reason—I leaned into the pain, focused all my attention on that spot &amp; stretched FURTHER... And it was like I BREATHED OUT the pain!! Then my entire spine clicked &amp; released this HUGE amount of energy. It was so intense a wave of nausea swept over me and I started sweating. But as long as I held the pose—the energy just kept flowing out through the entire length of my spine! It was unreal and I feel incredible!!<br /><br />Thank you so much Adriene for helping me release goodness knows what kind of energy—I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this in my life  🙏🏼<br />Now to fill the newfound space with LOVE 😍❤️",Renee Aharon Art,2021-05-03T21:29:44Z,0

"Thanks so much, Adriene! This practice made me a bit emotional... :&#39;&#39; -) In hard times we need to pay extra attention to avoid being so hard on ourselves and practice self-compassion and love instead. &lt;3",Margaret Hoffman,2021-03-02T09:19:12Z,0
"“The love and attention we seek is actually within.”<br /><br />Most nights, I spend time thinking about how I am not loved by my friends the way I wanted to be loved. I long for the same things I do for them - random text messages, small piece of chocolates, or even just a five-minute talk about our lives. I always go to the loop of how I always initiate, I always give, I always care for and how the acts of love I give isn’t the same with what I get. Today, I realized I can do the things I do for others, for myself. I can spend time with just hanging around, listening to music, drawing and writing, buying my favorite candy, and giving myself the kind words I always seek from others. <br /><br />I remember a quote I come across, non-verbatim but it sounded like “Talk to yourself as if you were your hurting friend.” If we can’t receive it from others, might as well give it to ourselves. No one is going to love us more than ourselves because we know ourselves inside out. It’s time to care for ourselves, too. 🤍",Camille Benitez,2021-03-01T00:14:26Z,0

"Loved today&#39;s practice, although I had a little struggle in between, it was a wonderful time with great eye openers. In the pond, I saw myself 3 years ago, as the happiest I&#39;ve ever been. It hurted me to then later, realizing I&#39;ve not been loving myself lately. I started to respect myself again, but loving is another thing. Im trying, but it can be so hard. In the end I decided to go to bed and snuggle in as a burrito. This reminded me of a thing I&#39;ve learned in therapy, to really come back to yourself its amazing to just lay in a babyburrito and spent time with yourself. Thank you for taking me back in this &quot;self cuddling&quot; feeling, was much needed!🤗💛",JoyKirsten,2021-02-17T00:29:30Z,1
"I was doing a 20m meditation before a yoga sesh w Adriene, but i think it&#39;s better to start with this first! The movement calms me down. And the closing of each session can flow right into meditation. So much better. Thx again A and B!",C M Huynh,2021-02-16T23:36:55Z,2

"(25/365) &quot;the attention and the love we seek is actually within&quot; truer words have never been spoken for me <br />today when looking into the pond during cobbler&#39;s pose i told myself to picture what i wanted part of myself i wanted to see (because i still can&#39;t picture my reflection for some reason), and i decided to picture myself when i&#39;m dancing, because that&#39;s when i&#39;m happiest (though i&#39;m not very good at it). and that brought a happy little memory of when an old friend said he liked seeing me dance because i looked happy :) i wanted to share that moment~ namaste everyone ❤",honey Blue,2021-02-16T03:10:06Z,1

"Day 25:<br /><br />You know, I wasn&#39;t going to practice today.<br /><br />I&#39;ve gotten kinder and more understanding with myself when I miss days, and I&#39;ve been pretty consistent for the past several.  I woke up stiff all over, and managed to stretch a terrible crick <i>into</i> my back and shoulder, rather than out of it.  Rounding my back twinged like a bad neck  from sleeping upright in a chair.  A few experimental cat-cows, just to try and loosen it up, _hurt_.<br /><br />But it was the kind of hurt that felt like stretching and loosening up would help instead of make it worse, and I&#39;m better at listening to my body now than I was a month ago, and I could tell the difference.  And I did a bit of stretching, and the easiest thing seemed to be to go for some of the stretches we&#39;ve done together in practice, some of the things I&#39;d learned from Adriene, because after all, I know them now, right?  And then five or ten minutes later, after I&#39;d decided to skip today entirely, I was in tabletop position moving into a twist and I thought to myself, <i>you know, if we&#39;re down here already anyway, we might as well at least see what the day&#39;s practice is.</i><br /><br />And there it was, exactly what I needed.  For my body, which hurts more than I wish it did at my age, and can&#39;t bend or lift or move the way I want it to, but which <i>does</i> bend and lift and feel and work as hard as it can, which has always done its best for me while I&#39;ve tried to do my best for myself.  For my heart.<br /><br />Today was a good day.",Clarity C,2021-02-07T20:02:04Z,0

I have fallen a few days behind and this one tugged at a little hidden place of love in my heart. When I had my son (we’re a week out from 4 years ago!) I had an epidural that failed and I naturally fell into a “horsey breath” to help make it through the transition period immediately before giving birth. This was a beautiful reminder of that moment when I thought I couldn’t do it but I did it.,Kelly Collins,2021-01-31T04:32:16Z,4

Right as the theme is love. I love it.

"I&#39;d often heard that hip opening postures were connected to emotional releases, and found myself skeptical, until I began this daily practice with you all this month and noticed a correlation - the emotional ones are always those hip ones. This was an emotional one today. This theme is particularly difficult for me right now, but I find such comfort in the knowledge that my practice, my mat, this community, has my back. It has become a home for me this month when I no longer had the one I knew. Thank you Adriene for another special practice. Thank you for a safe place to grow. &lt;3",Kate Brown,2021-01-27T23:03:42Z,0

"I had something meaningful stolen from me today, and it left me feeling vulnerable, confused, frustrated, angry, hurt. I don&#39;t understand how a stranger can see my property and think it can be theirs. And I&#39;ve been telling everyone today what happened, and I really didn&#39;t want to do yoga because I knew I&#39;d end up crying (again). But I always get something from this practice, and today I&#39;m leaving with Adriene&#39;s words that maybe the nurturing I need comes from within. Everyone tells me oh no I&#39;m sorry that happened, but no matter how many people say it, I don&#39;t feel better. It&#39;s still stolen. So I&#39;ll keep crying to release these emotions and I&#39;ll look inside to try and find the nurturing I need to get through it.",Nicole Letourneux,2021-01-27T21:56:21Z,0

"I was supposed to do number 17 today, and normally wouldn&#39;t skip, but I needed something thematic today so I made an exception and chose this practice because of the title. I was feeling sad and lonely today, but decided that instead of crying myself to sleep again, I will do something nice for myself, because I am worthy. I took a long shower, lit some candles and spent some quality time on the mat with Adriene and my beautiful body. I moved and breathed like I love myself, smiled and the only tears I shed at the end were happy. I&#39;m still not 100% okay but someday I will be and Adriene is helping me to get there.

"I missed this practice yesterday, and have been being a bit hard on myself as I really wanted to do the whole 30 days without missing any. Well, I got to it today, but was definitely struggling to find the love. In the final plank to belly to cobra move, my shirt slid up a titch so my belly was flush on the mat. Low and behold, when I went to push back up to all fours, by belly made a magnificent sucking/popping sound, like a plunger being pulled off my mat! I burst into laughter, almost to the point of tears. Feeling the love a bit more after that hilarity &lt;3",Rachel Baxter,2021-01-27T17:19:22Z,0
"Trying not to look for a meaning in the fact that LOVE is the first practice I&#39;ve missed in this journey.

"Like many people, this period of lockdown seems to be harder during the Winter months in the UK. I love watching the sunshine through the window in your studio where you are currently shooting this 30 day journey, watching Benji looking out for the deer, birds and the wind in the grass. It is all so relaxing, and sometimes I can&#39;t keep my eyes shut because I just want to reach out and stroke Benji. This particular practice was one of those special ones. I closed my eyes at the end and really understood for a brief moment  about the difference between love and what I thought was love, but was really empathy and compassion. Love is different and that moment truly resonated with me. Then I looked up to see that Benji had sat on you in your burrito blanket! I had to rewind to see that it was just at that precise moment  Benji had decided to sit on you to show you his true love.<br />Thank you for this unbelievable practice and daily love. You and your team, including Benji, are angels in our time of distress. x Thank you Namaste!",Ann Jones,2021-01-27T15:33:46Z,0

"💫💜💫 Love 🌱<br /><br />I sing with you @adrienelouise because I used to HATE yoga...or what I was shown it to be.🙁<br /><br />I arrived 5 minutes early to my very first yoga class and the door was locked.🔒🔒🔒<br /><br />The 3 people up front stood behind the glass door and watched me get drenched and shiver in the torrential rain storm⛈<br /><br />I had taken the bus and there was no where to wait.😕<br /><br />I huddled under a tree and marveled at thier callousness 😖<br /><br />When they opened up the door the lady said it was for &quot;thier safety&quot; that they didn&#39;t let me in 😩<br /><br />My bus home didn&#39;t arrive for 90min so I stayed, dripped on thier floor during a &quot;drill sergeant-y&quot; miserable practice during which I wasn&#39;t permitted to modify poses, drink water nor go to the bathroom.😑 <br /><br />I squished my way home in pain swearing to NEVER &quot;do yoga&quot; again 🙁<br /><br />THANK YOU for showing us true yoga.💜Thank you for showing us love.💜 <br /><br />Now I look forward to going to my mat... and singing and breathing and having fun while moving &amp; loving myself back into wholeness💜<br /><br />Thank you.🌱<br /><br />Namaste y&#39;all 🙏🏽",Dr. DancingLion's Healing Room,2021-01-27T04:30:49Z,1

"&quot;The nurturing we seek is actually within.&quot; Thank you for this powerful statement Adriene. In this last month, I&#39;ve come to the mat, more times that perhaps in the last several months. I show up for myself because I know I have to take care of myself, my body (my doctors tell me so). The truth is I realize too it&#39;s a commitment of myself to love myself. It&#39;s a powerful and beautiful concept.

Today was by far the hardest session yet. Love. &quot;Love yourself. Love yourself for who you are. Look at your beautiful self.&quot; I have a dark past with eating disorders and feel myself slipping back. I love my &#39;soul&#39; but not what I see when I look in the mirror. I cried throughout this who practice and finally just lost it in the end. Today I did three workouts. I always save my yoga for the end because Adriene always has a way with words to make myself feel better. Some days are better than others. But damn am I grateful to have this practice and Adriene to remind myself of what truly matters (as difficult as it is). Tomorrow will be a better day.

"It&#39;s day 25 (check!) and I have something really special to share with you. I had a hard day, where I felt disappointed at myself and not content with a lot of things. It was a day where I struggled to show love to myself, to be kind and compassionate with myself. Then, here I am, doing my usual yoga practice, which, by coincidence, has a theme related to love. Fast forward to the end of the practice, when I felt the need to give myself a hug, so I did it! Not only did I show that tiny little gesture of love to myself, but I also felt my breath slowly lifting my arms and lowering them, and so on... My arms on my chest, my chest breathing, my arms hugging me. It felt magical.",Alexandra Bob,2021-01-27T00:39:21Z,0

How I know myself better than anyone else, and I will always be able to nurture my soul with my Self Love practice. I don&#39;t think there will be a day where I don&#39;t arrive on the mat for my daily practice, I can&#39;t imagine my life without it anymore. ❤️",Kat Abrams,2021-01-26T23:25:06Z,2

"I looked into the pond during cobbler and immediately heard in my head “when will my reflection show....” so I sang it! And it felt good. I’ve been doing yoga with Adriene for a couple years now, and as I’ve been going through this 30 day journey, I’ve had some really negative energy towards myself. I thought to myself “yeah I feel my muscles are sore, but is this improving my body? That was my goal.” However, in the past two days of yoga, I realized what I was missing was LOVE for myself. When I smeared the honey on my stomach, I felt LOVE, not anger or frustration. It was amazing and I am so happy I convinced myself to do this journey. Thank you Adriene and this lovely community! I find so much hope in the comments as well. ❤️",Marisa LaRuffa,2021-01-26T22:02:24Z,0

I can’t think of a better yoga practice for today than this one, even if by the time I got around to it today, I was on the verge (or beyond) of tears. I’m so grateful I showed up today, and despite everything, I’ve been doing your January series since probably 2016 and this is the farthest I’ve gotten actually doing each video the day it comes out. I hope I finish the month strong, and to anyone else struggling right, you’re not alone. And if you’re doing this series, someone else who is probably struggling is also taking time for themselves at the exact same time as you are, and that’s pretty special.",catherinelikespink,2021-01-26T21:22:52Z,0
"Today was not a really great day, I had problems with my professor at uni, the hoodie I wanted was out of stock 2 minutes after the restock and I didn&#39;t feel well in my body today. The second I sat on my mat and Adriene said &quot;The biggest act of self-love is showing up on the mat today&quot; it couldn&#39;t feel more right. I think I am going to cry all along with the practice because I think that my body needs it, but isn&#39;t it self-love? To let my body free itself from the worries and just reset and love itself as it is now, a little bit broken and tired. Thank you, Adriene!  Thanks to you and these 10 months of practice I learned what it was to just feel, breathe and allow myself to love my body and my mind as they are, beautiful and unique in their own ways.

"I think that for the first time, I truly felt what you meant when you said ‘breathe like you love yourself, move like you love yourself.’ It’s made me rethink some decisions I’ve been making to ones where I benefit myself most. Like for example, rather than go on my phone tonight when I’m in bed, and thus find it difficult to get to sleep after, I’m going to read some chapters of a book I’m currently reading and enjoying but have been putting off for, well, no reason. (The Queens Thief series - highly recommend). Lots and LOTS of love to you, Adriene!",Rumaysah Shafi,2021-01-26T20:59:53Z,0

"I love coming to the mat seated cross legged, because it reminds me of coming to school as a kid and coming to learn, every time I come to the mat I learn something new about myself, this journey has taught me that I am always changing and I am never the same coming to the mat or leaving it. But inside there will always be that little bit of love to find, and that little bit of love is enough to last an infinity. I can’t always find that love, I can’t always bring myself to see it and recognise it, but I know it’s there for me to tap into any day. Thank you Adriene for reminding me that this practice has my back. Lots of love 💕 namaste",Zainab Ahmed,2021-01-26T20:43:33Z,0

"As ever, Adriene, thank you. Ms Sonja the little cat joined me for the entirety of the practice, though the singing at the top—which delighted me—gave her a moment of pause. She has been sung to all her life and always seems to have a mixed response, so it’s nothing personal, I assure you!<br />Once we got going in the practice, horsey lips caused her to sit up and take notice, she shifted around to watch the video, then observe me as if comparing. For savasana, she curled up nestled in my arm. I really felt the love!<br />So I hope you take it lightly as we mean it, Sonja and I love you! And Benji!! See you tomorrow",Crystal Rose,2021-01-26T19:52:58Z,0
During shavasana I got all burritoed up and my floppy hound decided that my toes were not allowed to be covered and that they needed kisses.

So much good inspiration that melted my stress from the morning away. It&#39;s almost revolutionary to think about practicing acts of &quot;self-love&#39;, but it felt wonderful to acknowledge that this time on the mat is purely for me (as calls and texts tried to distract me).

"I think those were the fastest 23 minutes of my life, what the heck? Loved it so much and I think this one is a practice I will return to often on days when I am too tired to do a heavy routine or just additionally. <br />Also... I have a question to you all, maybe someone can help... sometimes when pointing my feet (even when just lying down) the soles and insides of my feet begin to cramp really badly and continue to do so when I flex or point them. It goes away in a neutral position but will come again in any other pose, even over one or two hours. I almost couldn’t do the poses where the tops of the feet lay on the mat because of the pain. Has anyone else ever had this problem? It‘s not a new one, but it was really painful today. Happy if anyone has any suggestions that might help? <br />Love to you all &lt;3",dazzzlingworld,2021-01-26T19:25:31Z,0

"Move as you love yourself. Breath like you love yourself. And Each time you show up it is an act of love. These are the lovely words of Adriene. I found my head heavy on thoughts, due to too much information I am feeding in because of my exams, but this yoga time makes me feel myself and think about myself more. Thanks to Adriene.

I have to admit the past few practices have involved me just being angry and frustrated at myself for not moving perfectly (I struggle with perfectionism). BUT... I&#39;m so happy that you decided to make this practice for today - it helps me remember how important love is in yoga and how i need to focus on appreciating and caring for myself rather than looking at self care like a checklist.,Katelyn G,2021-01-26T18:36:56Z,0

"To be honest last year mid November I stopped my yoga practice because I was in test period and then I felt very depressed, when January started I thought I must do this I must complete that in my to do list was obviously getting back to yoga with Adriene. But I couldn’t get myself back to it, just started procrastinating, feeling really anxious and even having small anxiety attacks episodes, but today I thought even if I’m not doing this on day one even if I feel this late... is now or never. I’m so glad I arrived now again on this journey in LOVE day! Because it is love day everyday and I forgot that I needed that. I feel better than yesterday, I’m glad for Adriene existence and for me for clicking the video. 💜",Natalia Padron,2021-01-26T17:41:44Z,0

"Looks like Benji wants to go for a walk...he&#39;s got a great view though :)  Adrienne, I haven&#39;t watched your videos for years. I have my own practice, but came across this. I had an amazing, charismatic cat called Bodhi that was my yoga partner for years like Benji is for you. When he passed a couple of years ago, it was a loss greater than anyone could imagine. I literally felt my root chakra dim - and started to limp because the left side (heart side lost it&#39;s anchor)  - but have got stronger in my practice as a result since I dedicate and summon his connection daily. Your crown chakra and heart chakra and &#39;hands&#39; can be a portal to that energy...and just saying his name grounds me. I have seen your practice and  I know you will be fine in the event of....and your body will guide you through. I am only writing this because it looks like you have a lot of followers and are helping alot of people, so wanted to make sure you have a bit of advice that may help you, when and if you need it.

Totally cried after this one. I just realised how hating and hard I still sometimes am towards myself while I treat all ohter creatures with love and respect.

I did almost the entire practice with my eyes closed imagining I was in my favourite place (on a beach in Malibu, obvs) and randomly the song &quot;I Love Me&quot; by Hailee Steinfeld would pop into my brain and it just gave me that much more momentum and strength to continue pushing forward. How I ever fell out of my daily practice is so surprising to me. Because it has only been 25 days and I feel like I cannot function without it?!

"Growing up I had a very tough relationship with my body, it was all hate and no love. It was definitely conditioned by how my body never fit any canon of modern beauty and fit, the pressure I felt to be liked by my peers for what I looked like crushed me many times and so did the evil comments of young and adults alike. I started doing yoga daily more than a year ago ( a bit later with Adriene) and in this period of time, I felt the biggest change in my mindset. My body got more flexible and a bit stronger, without changing my weight or shape. But the biggest change happened in my mind when I finally learnt to love myself for who I am and started to let go of society imposed beauty canons. It&#39;s been a long and awaited journey but I&#39;m glad I can finally be able to appreciate (most of the times) what my body does for me and how it looks like, too.",Sofia,2021-01-26T12:15:45Z,0

"Adriene, thank you so much for all your hard work! Yoga with you changed my life! Is there a chance you could do a Yoga Journey where videos would gradually get longer? Where maybe we would start with 5-10 minute videos the first week and then build up our strength and stamina to be able to do full-on 50 or 60 minute practices by the end of it? I&#39;d love to do one of your 30-day Yoga Journeys, but every time I see a 30 or 40-minute first-day video I get demotivated and turn to your shorter videos that aren&#39;t part of any programs, but this way I can&#39;t seem to progress beyond anything longer than a 20-30 minute practice :(",Ariel's English,2021-01-26T12:11:23Z,0

Get to the mat today- it&#39;s worth it! <br />Just let go and let her voice guide you! She&#39;s got your back!<br /><br />The gentle/challenging hamstring and quad stretches were so appreciated!  The slower pace allowed me to not force and edge it out.  <br />Another great practice is in the books!  Have a great practice everyone! ☮️+💜,M B,2021-01-26T11:51:02Z,0
"Adrienne, I am a plus size, middle aged woman who started yoga for the first time ever in June of 2020. I have to make some modifications to adjust for my size, but this morning I realized when you  say lunge, I am doing lizard. Is that okay? Do I need to be consensious of anything with that regular modification? Thank you!",Sarah Bailey,2021-01-26T11:50:00Z,0

"On a more serious note...I think so highly of this lesson, as it brought up an issue I have with my left hip. I came with a cushion..good thing cause my knees needed care esp in the last bit with the knee on the floor bent up and grabbing the left foot with the right hand shoulder opener. The left and right knee had issues, not so much with cushion, more on the left. Is that a quad muscle issue, between the knee and hip or a knee flex issue or something in my hip issue? Don&#39;t know. Not sure how to address it. I notice I have this problem sitting in sucassana. I can have the right knee heavy but not the left.. Anyone else have this type of issue? Ideas? ♥️♥️♥️♥️",Caitlin Byrne,2021-01-26T11:20:05Z,0

Constant stress, dieting, beating myself up over why this or that isn&#39;t love. Giving myself a hug while laying on the floor breathing lots of love in and out before closing with a Namaste is loving myself. As always Adriene there aren&#39;t enough thank yous I could say for how incredible you, these videos and this community is. Namaste everyone. 🙏💕",Dia Kirkwood,2021-01-26T09:36:04Z,0
"Sending lots of love your way. When I started practicing with Adriene four years ago, I just needed to work the tension out of my muscles. I did not even realize I was learning self-love until slowly, gradually, there it was.  As I&#39;ve heard Adriene say ... letting go of what no longer serves me... 🙏💕",Tricia Moss,2021-01-26T13:01:05Z,1
"Today i randomly decided to do my whole practice facing the other way in the room and after about 5 minutes I noticed one of my giant African land snails has gone rogue was at my head end, trying to come onto the mat. So pleased I was able to spot her and not tread on her. Had her on my hand for the last few bits and she seems very happy! This could be the time for snail yoga! 💚🐌💚🐌💚🐌💚🐌💚",Jo Homan,2021-01-26T09:33:57Z,0

Showing up to the mat and cultivating a strong and beautiful practice is an an act of love not just to yourself but also to all those around you and that you come in to contact with. <br />&quot;One works on oneself as a gift to other people so that one doesn&#39;t create more suffering. I help people as a work on myself and I work on myself to help people.&quot; - Baba Ram Dass <br />Thank you Adriene for helping us all to create a ripple effect of love through the universe 💗,Katie,2021-01-26T08:40:29Z,1

Important theme today. Unfortunately I felt a bit sad when I was not able to &quot;feel the love&quot; as I viewed my own reflection looking down into the pond during cobbler&#39;s pose. Self love is difficult I find. I guess it takes practice. So thanks Adriene for helping. &lt;3,Petter Jakobsson,2021-01-26T06:57:28Z,1

"on day 25 I finally managed to wake up and do it in the morning. Even though i was used to an evening practice before. I  started 11 minutes after the upload but tomorrow i&#39;ll catch that magic moment :D I feel like i will still need an evening practice because I already created this habit of releasing the day, forgetting about work and going back to myself. But I think I&#39;ll just do one of the previous breath days :) I&#39;m so glad I joined the 30 day journey this time. My goal in the beginning was to show up for myself without the focus being fitness, changing my body, losing weight or comparing myself to anyone. I just wanted a sole dedication of showing up every day no matter what - a habit. And I feel like it&#39;s really happening, it is becoming a habit. 3 days ago I stopped eating sugary stuff but it felt natural without an ounce of force, I suppose change can be gradual :) I love this community and I can&#39;t wait to see what&#39;s next. But I believe, for many of us, it will be a year of daily practice :)",Simona Simeonova,2021-01-26T06:53:53Z,6
She has some nice bedtime yoga videos of varying lengths too if you want something a little different. But this journey has been so yummy that re-doing one of the Breath videos might be more satisfying!,rachelrossos,2021-01-26T07:07:22Z,1

"@stratfordak ohh my pleasure. I just figure it out as I go but I don&#39;t want to spend ages looking for a video as I could have spent that time doing a longer yoga session. I often like to look at her lists of sessions categorized by length of time as you know how much free time you have to squeeze it in. Also, another suggestion is if you find a session that you extra specially love or something like that, to save it on youtube into a playlist and maybe you will end up with go-to videos of your favourites for when you need it most. Choose your own adventure or even pick something while scrolling through with your eyes closed.. orrr.. lastly, pick something with a beautiful title &amp; intention like &#39;yoga to fill your cup&#39; and &#39;yoga for self care&#39;/self love.. you can&#39;t go wrong with those &lt;3",Kim Rudner,2021-01-28T10:24:21Z,1

Sometimes, if I know my body needs a specific thing, I&#39;ll find a video which focuses on that or just pick something at random. <br />Adriene also releases monthly yoga video playlists so you don&#39;t have to even think which videos to pick as she&#39;s already picked them out for you.",Kim Rudner,2021-01-28T09:13:50Z,1

"Yes. Not every trait or always but I accept more and more that it is ok to love yourself, not in a selfish or egocentric fashion but with kindness and appreciation. The most important relationship in your life is with yourself. Nurture that relationship, learn to appreciate all you are and you will be happy and blessed. Namaste Y",mike walker,2021-01-27T02:43:58Z,1
