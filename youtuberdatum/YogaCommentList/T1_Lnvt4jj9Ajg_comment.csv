Other ways : Just let it go...........don&#39;t think about anything too much...don&#39;t think about something or someone you dislike...just let it go..everything happens for  a reason and never forget the lessons....,S.Vigneshwaran,2020-08-02T06:02:08Z,1

Doing a daily practice with you since January 2 of this year has opened.both my body and my soul so much Adriene. On day 28 of home I am on day 58 of practice with you and all the others who continued on this yoga journey with me since January. Whether it is with the home journey or one of your other yoga journeys. We are now living life with an openness that years ago we could only dream of. Much appreciation for this practice up to now and as long as I am capable of doing so :) Namaste 🙏,Jacki Siddall,2021-02-28T12:22:44Z,5

"<b>*Smug post alert!*</b> Today I completed doing yoga every single day of the year! Woo Hoo! You, Adriene, have been in my front room once, sometimes twice, a day since 1st Jan 2020! I&#39;ve done all of your 30-day courses and a ton of random picks too and I feel great! I&#39;ve laughed many times, cried a couple, and I may have sworn at you once or twice whilst holding a pose as you talk about something or other...er, yeah...sorry about that! I did this in conjunction with seeing if I could not drink booze for a year too (Swap one bad habit for a good one) and I bloody succeeded! Hoo rah! Now I know that life is better with a little daily practice and that I don&#39;t really need to be drinking as much booze, if at all. I&#39;m set up nicely for 2021, so thank you so much, and I am looking forward to &#39;Breath&#39; starting tomorrow!",Mark Mathews,2020-12-31T10:40:18Z,6

"I&#39;m so surprised how this journey is already coming to it&#39;s end. How is it day 28 already? This is the first  set of 30days I have been doing actually in 30 days, instead of spread out over a month or 2 (or 3). I&#39;m really enjoying this journey Home. Especially as the crazy year that&#39;s been 2020 is coming to an end, it has felt really suiting and powerful and comforting. So next to feeling really proud for almost finishing this challenge, it&#39;s also making me a little sad that it&#39;s soon to be finished. Practicing at home, but with the love and support I feel from Adriene and everyone in the comment section, has been wonderful &lt;3",Elieska,2020-12-28T09:43:54Z,0

"Adriene I know you get so so so many comments, but I really want to put a big &#39;thank you&#39; out into the universe, even if you don&#39;t see it. <br />I have been practicing yoga since last November by simply searching how to do a move and then attempting it, maybe adding it into a little flow if I felt like it. I had heard of your channel but felt really apprehensive to try specific yoga videos as a lot of other channels I have tried have felt more like a HIIT session and didn&#39;t make me feel great. I found your channel while looking for something to ease my grief and saw you had a session for that exactly. Quite honestly it felt like someone was holding my hand, giving me space to feel sad and safe all at once. I decided there and then to try this 30 day journey Home and I do feel like I am almost there. I don&#39;t feel as if I&#39;m searching for a Home anymore, Home is me. Thank you so much Adriene and Benji, sending you much gratitude &amp; love. - Ella",Florence,2020-09-28T07:15:03Z,1

"Today there was a big earthquake in the morning here and this practice was so hard to achieve for me, since I&#39;ve been dizzy all day long and trusting the ground had a whole new meaning for me today.  A couple of years ago I was in a severe earthquake, I was a teacher and the building where I worked collapsed, we had to rescue kids from the rubbles and since then I&#39;ve been very afraid. But I came to practice, and I discovered that not only did I needed the calmness but the reflection too; hearing you on giving back and not only taking away, got me thinking about the earth and the soil below me, and not being afraid or angry at its life but grateful and serving. It was a very powerful experience for me. How do I give back to the ground that supports me? to the soil that I feed from? to the Earth? In the end I was feeling so moved and thankful that it showed me how this journey has changed my perspective on everything. Thank you so much!!!",mariana campos,2020-06-24T01:14:44Z,66

I would like to ask though, since it&#39;s day 28 now... we&#39;d like to continue with our practice and want to ask where you would recommend going from here? I practiced yoga for a long time in the past, but I&#39;ve fallen out of practice, and my dad is totally new to the practice, so we&#39;re looking for a slight progression from the HOME set to move onto next.

Today was my most successful yet (held for about 7 seconds) which is HUGE for me since when you introduced Crow in a Home video, I couldn&#39;t lift both feet off the floor at once at all. &lt;3",Emma Faith,2020-05-25T14:51:24Z,0

"Emotionally speaking, I&#39;ve been adapting pretty well so far to this whole lock down, confinement situation. Yet today, in the first few minutes of the practice, when Adriene said to bring the hands to the belly, suddenly I noticed the sensation of my left hand on the right one. It felt so foreign and yet so familiar. And for the first time in these past week, I felt struck by a deep and sudden crave for human touch.<br />Gave the back of my hands a few gentle, loving strokes; that felt nice. But mostly, I smiled at the fact that this practice brought this lack, that was probably buried deep for weeks, to my attention. Thank you Adriene! Your practice is always the highlight of my day.

I walked out with a few bruises, pain in my chest from the seatbelt, and as the adrenaline wore off, my neck and shoulders were in a lot of pain from whiplash. I could hardly turn my head. Everyone was telling me I would probably feel worse the next day, but I felt better. Three days later I have no pain and full movement in my neck. I completely attribute my quick healing time to doing yoga (nearly) daily with you since February. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",Megan Cantrell,2020-05-07T16:23:22Z,45

"Just finished day 27, having begun when I was isolating for possible COVID 19 exposure and saw a recommendation on <a href=""http://newyorker.com/"">NewYorker.com</a>. Yoga is already challenging for my understretched and a bit overweight 69 year old body. I skipped one day after pulling a calf muscle when I tried to do one of your more challenging wide squats. Skipped another day cause I could not kick the blues but I am now accidentally in love with the daily ritual, even when I can,t balance that low lunged leg out into free space without toppling, even when my belly intrudes on “framing” that front foot. Yours, dear Adrienne, is a good kind of contagion. Thank you.",bet48h,2020-05-07T03:38:09Z,15

What is a good alternative to the position where you hold each of your ankles behind your back while laying on your stomach? I wasn’t sure what to do during that part because I wasn’t able to grab my ankles behind me.,Candice Keller-Stewart,2020-04-24T00:51:49Z,0

Thanks Adriene I have never been to yoga class... Only through your videos I&#39;m learning it... And I will keep Learning it... But I have a doubt is that okay to start yoga classes through means of online...or it is mandatory should I have to go direct classes??,Indhu R,2020-04-22T03:34:15Z,2
"I really appreciated the reminder to consider that our practices are here to nourish us, to give us something rather than take something away. It’s gotten me noticing how many other parts of my life (my French classes, for an example) are also not there to take anything away, but rather quite the opposite :) so glad to be starting my day with you ❤️",Cathlene Bell,2020-04-21T05:44:19Z,0

"Good session, however the gripping of both ankles while on my belly was quite a challenge. Extending the legs from there was not possible. This might have been a good time to invite the older and/or less flexible of us to use a prop - a belt, yoga strap, etc.. Thanks again for what you do. I realize this is a business but some businesses add to society and this is one.<br /><br />And this is the first time I haven’t missed a day.

I suffer from hypoglycemia, which means I can&#39;t stay too long without eating or with low sugar levels, and I could feel it slowly creeping in as I was practicing.

"Hello dear Adriene,<br />Today’s practice was deeply healing for me. But before practice I read your letter and that’s when the “pre-yoga” began. You talked about staying open to receive the gifts that are coming. And I thought, “I really want these gifts, but how do I get rid of these barriers?” And it occurred to me that I am doing it now. I feel proud of myself for honoring my commitment to journey all the way home, to feel the feels, as you say. Feeling the feeling, I believe is what dissolves the walls, which are unfelt, hardened emotions. <br /><br />I loved today’s practice because it was something about your energy today. I saw your feelings, and I saw you feeling them (oh, the actor’s heart! What a beautiful thing!). So naturally I felt my own soul open and soften. I was able to feel subtle sensations inside, and I continued to explore the sense of expansion I was experiencing, after practice. I got in touch with a very vital part of myself that I hid away...but after today’s practice I allowed myself to “feel”, the way I used to. <br /><br />This emotional breakthrough is so important to me because I am a creative person and I need access to those parts of myself. <br /><br />So, thank you Adriene, thank you for You.",Nickolet Allen,2020-01-30T09:03:46Z,0

I love how every single day is another bead in the chain and helps tie this journey home together. I find that the common thread throughout, no matter what, is returning to your breath. It is the step before the first step in getting there. Hmmm. Maybe our breath is our home. It helps maintain our life in our physical bodies and reminds us that we have all we need right here.

"If memory serves, the practice on day 30 will be an hour long and you will be silent. Will there be an option this year to have audio overlaid the silent video if we want it? I have found that over the past 2 years, the day 30 practice is the most stressful because I can&#39;t just flow through the yoga session and I have to continually look at the screen instead of being in the moment. I love all of the Yoga with Adriene videos so much! Adriene made me fall in love with yoga! :)",diamondust131,2020-01-30T04:24:38Z,0

I did what I could, modified some, and noticed where I could do more now than before!<br />I’m so happy that I’ve been able to continue to practice every day. My next goal is to try to start doing it in the mornings before work instead of evenings. I’ve been trying to set my alarm early, but haven’t been able to get myself up out of bed early enough yet!

I&#39;ve been doing the Home series each day, and it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve done the 30 days with you although most of the time when I practice yoga I do so with your videos. This series is really great, your personality is shining through. I had a great laugh out loud moment when you talked about coming out of a yoga class feeling loco. Anyway!

"Hello Adriene, I hope your day has been filled with peace and kindness. I really love your videos especially as someone who&#39;s not super flexible (yet). I always feel encouraged rather than shamed if i&#39;m struggling with a certain pose when I practice with you.<br /> I am a dance for fun and exercise kind of person. I dance contra (fast passed with lots of spinning) and zumba. I find that after spinning a ton at contra the fronts of my hips just under the hip bone are rather tender and sore. I also struggle with super tight hamstrings.  I was wondering if you had or could make a video specifically for dancers. If not, can you let me know which of the videos you currently have that are helpful for the issues I have mentioned? <br />Thank you so much for your positive and peaceful energy!",Taylor Guy,2020-01-30T03:00:06Z,0

"I learned something beautiful today. I have done yoga on and off for about 8 years now. And I always dreaded downward dog. I felt disoriented upside down and it was a difficult pose for me. But these last few days, I&#39;ve wanted to linger in it just a moment longer every time. It&#39;s a favorite pose. A place of rest and healing. Thank you for taking me on this journey. This is only one example of the lessons I&#39;ve learned about myself. Namaste.",Celairiel,2020-01-30T02:37:20Z,0

"Day 28 woo hoo!!! Anyone watching me while watching Adriene would have thought my practice was a fail..but not I! I know 28 days ago it hurt my knees to sit on them. Now it&#39;s comfortable for an extended period of time. Was I able to raise off my knee to high lunge while twisted? No. I would have had to drop at least 1 hand to raise up. But, I never lost my balance while turning into the twist. 28 days ago I would have. Did my thighs rise in bow? Maybe minutely. But, they did light up and I welcomed the feeling. Knowing that means they&#39;re growing stronger. How much more encouragement and joy can anyone expect to get in 19 minutes?!?! Add to that all the emotional support and love I feel on the mat. I&#39;ve been Nourished is the understatement of the year! Thank you Adriene and Kula. I feel blessed.",kristi shore,2020-01-30T01:03:27Z,0

"Day 28: Nourish. This is probably the most introspective practice of this journey for me. I had read the email and the message this practice carries in the day as I always do. So, the whole time I was on the mat now I was thinking about the many ways I was stopping myself to feel better about myself or a certain situation. The many ways I was not allowing certain people to enter my life because of the fear and insecurity of getting hurt again or being used again by them. This practice allowed me to hold those thoughts, pause and think of how far I have come. I have learned so much from those experiences. So, this was an opportunity to tell myself to stop holding back, keep my head on my shoulders, and face everything head-on. Because maybe, maybe this time around I would be better at handling those people or situations. I would be able to set healthy boundaries and get to the other side of the tunnel. Thank you so much, Adriene, for this. I am grateful. Namaste.",rubyveil19,2020-01-29T14:28:36Z,2

"Wow! Day 28. My body felt so integrated today. The moves came more easily. I realized today that I tend to slump over and put all my weight on my arms in lunge (so I never understood how she could get &quot;light on the fingertips&quot; and take them off the ground), but today I did it! Also, even 6 months ago it would have  been VERY uncomfortable to do that belly hold at the start. While I didn&#39;t love it, the fact that I could do it at all was magical for me. <br /><br /><br /><br />I have also had yoga classes in which I felt worse afterwards than before I attended.

"I&#39;m a combat veteran and am really struggling today. I dont think people realize what we go through and how hard it is to keep it together. When I do yoga it calms the voices in my head. My body and mind ache every day I&#39;m in constant pain. I am angry alot and dont even know why, yoga provides a outlet 20-30 minutes of my mind and body just relaxing. Thank you Adrian for this outlet &quot;rangers lead the way&quot; today is the anniversary of a bloody battle I was in. I feel like the battle has just begun now that I&#39;m retired and out of the army.",Sydney Wooton,2020-01-29T12:56:38Z,0

Adriene has created such a wonderful community here and please know that you have many people here to support you.  If you haven&#39;t already, meditation is wonderful addition to your yoga practice.  Adriene has a bunch of videos you can use for that, too.

"Dear Adriene -<br /><br />This morning I found myself in child’s pose for the first time since starting this 30 day practise. Until now, my left knee hurt too bad when I attempted this pose. Although I had to switch to a cross legged seat, I am thrilled you had helped me heal to this point! It was my reason for starting this practise and to see these results is exactly what I’d hoped for! So thank you, from my whole heart! <br /><br />Looking forward to our February journey, increasing mobility and deepening my mind, body and soul connection. ❤️<br /><br />Thank you! <br />I love you!<br />Gloria",Gloria Simonson,2020-01-29T12:53:58Z,26

"Dear Adriene, I have a confession to make. When this 30-day challenge started I decided not to participate in it each day, but to save all episodes so that i could binge them all in one day. You know kind of like people do with Game of thrones. It&#39;s been hard seeing all the episodes come Up and having to wait but I think it will be worth it. Still I cant shake the feeling that this is a naughty thing to do, am I being a bad yogi? Also, do you think I could skip some of the shavasanas when bingeing? It would really help me save some time.<br />Namaste<br />Adam",Greffwe,2020-01-29T11:19:48Z,1
Yo adriene!     Thanks,The Cactus Creatures,2020-01-29T11:12:34Z,1
"Adriene:<br />I was initially hesitant to begin this Yoga Journey with you; after all, I&#39;ve never been to a yoga class, and I&#39;ve only practiced yoga sporadically (maybe 3 times in my entire life).  However, my hesitation melted away to excitement.  I now I&#39;ve value this time.  I treasure this time.  Yoga is the metaphorical &quot;chocolate cake&quot; I get to enjoy for breakfast.  I now understand the importance of breath, stillness, movement, connection, nourishment, and most importantly: the connection between the mind, body, soul, and spirit.  There is a method to the movement (and even the lack thereof in some of the poses), and I deeply appreciate everything you&#39;ve taught me these last 29 days.  <br />In fact, I find myself down heartened to realize our 30 Day Yoga Journey is coming to an end.  Now, what will I do with myself in the mornings?  Dare I go back to my hectic routine, or perhaps find another calendar to follow?  Thanks for everything Adrienne.  This practice helps clear my head for the day, and it has helped improve my productivity.  Even in life&#39;s most frustrating circumstances, the best thing I can do is focus on my breath.  Thank you again for everything!  <br /><br />With Much Love, Hugs, and Prayer <br /> <br />~ Jen 🧘‍♀️💖🌹🙏📿",Jenny Love,2020-01-29T11:08:22Z,188

"I honestly never felt so good doing yoga and coming back every day. Adriene is now my favorite yoga teacher on YT. She always gives me the feeling of being totally ok the way I am and with how my practice went. On most yoga channels it is so frustrating cause you can´t keep up and even if you do it your way, you feel so frustrated and worthless watching the teachers doing the hardest yoga positions while you are sweating in the easiest ones. I really could feel a lot of changes in my mind and strength in my body, regarding to self awareness, self love, building gentle thoughts and many other things. And I love your funny and relaxed habit of mind, it makes me smile every day. Thank you so much!",Ari Adne,2020-01-29T10:58:02Z,0

"Good magical morning my friends. I am in tears from seeing how far we have come together. I received some big news last evening that my cerebral palsy can be improved to the point of being an almost normal person. It truly is a big breakthrough and this practice couldn&#39;t be a more perfect complement. Thank you so much, Adriene for having been the kind, loving, passionate teacher that you&#39;ve been to me and this community ever since we had our respective starts with yoga. Let&#39;s do this everybody. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2020-01-29T06:09:07Z,642

"Up and ready! Can&#39;t believe we&#39;ve done 28 days now of yoga. In the beginning it was a challenge, something I had to get done every day. Now it is something I look forward to every day and want to keep going with. I&#39;d consider buying the yoga every day of the year plan from Adriene!",Ingrid Marie Kjelseth,2020-01-29T06:06:39Z,2

"Im thinking about restarting and doing it all over again, I think itll be interesting to see the difference doing it a second time",K P,2020-05-09T17:12:37Z,1
"Andrea Childers We&#39;ll find what feels good 😊 Follow her monthly calendars! She also uploads new videos on Sunday. Tbh I would be lost without her calendars because if left on my own, I would choose the easiest practices and never challenge myself. It&#39;s a great continuation of the 30 days of yoga!",GrayLandscapes,2020-01-29T19:28:34Z,3

"I know right!  I was thinking of redoing the other 30-day ones,  too. But yesterday Adriene mentioned in her email that she&#39;ll be dropping a calendar for each month with already available videos and I think I&#39;ll be doing that instead :)",Ina Raykova,2020-01-29T07:53:50Z,8
"You can download her previous 30 day yoga challenges on her website, I think theres about 5 or so to download and its at a donation price I think.",Jason Thomas,2020-01-29T07:29:51Z,2

Anyone else wondering what they&#39;re going to do in three days?,Paul Fairbrother,2020-01-29T06:03:26Z,98
"@Zita M. Photography Dedicate is Adriene&#39;s 30 Day challenge from last year. All 30 days are available on YouTube. I too need to check off and have the feel of a challenge. I have really enjoyed this, but am realistic that I&#39;m a long way from choosing to practice every morning just because it&#39;s good for me and feels awesome. Best of luck on whichever path you choose.",kristi shore,2020-01-30T15:54:28Z,1
"@kristi shore I&#39;ll check it out, but I think I really like the idea of the continuation of one program. It feels like checking off the numbers motivates me more to show up every day than an individual session that I can skip anytime...",Zita M. Photography,2020-01-30T15:41:04Z,1
@Majda Attar See you soon in the comment section under Dedicate. ;),Zita M. Photography,2020-01-30T15:39:20Z,1
"@Katrina Hinton It was my first challenge too. @Zita Marias it took me 3 months to finish too haha x) I am glad I&#39;ve only missed a couple days of Home, and I&#39;ll be catching up on them!",Majda Attar,2020-01-30T13:58:16Z,2
@Zita M. Photography dedicate is where I&#39;m headed. I&#39;ve read really great things on the FWFG app! Good luck and great job!,kristi shore,2020-01-30T00:02:01Z,1
