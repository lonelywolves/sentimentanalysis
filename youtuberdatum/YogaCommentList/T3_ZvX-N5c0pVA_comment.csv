"It is likely you’ll never see this comment what with the 1k+ posts. Today’s practice opened a flood of emotions for me. Not sure if it was the hip work, the “trust” factor or the fact that I’ve made progress to lift my feet from the ground momentarily for crow, but clearly yoga is opening something within and I am thankful I took the leap to trust your guidance and my intuition and that I am trusting the process. Many thanks. ❤️ namaste.",C. Swader,2021-03-21T13:53:38Z,1

I use to be pretty good with yoga back in the day. I got away from it for years and tried some classes at my club. I did not feel confident due to show offs that had mastered some moves including the instructor. Here I feel confident and comfortable thanks to you Adriene. I just adore Benji too. I just lost my beloved baby doggie so coming to this practice is for healing a broken heart and helping get some stress relief. Thank you for making the world a beautiful and better place Adriene and Benji,Monica Buletza,2021-03-18T11:20:11Z,2

I couldn’t lift either legs off the floor in that pose, but I am already excited for the journey and the learning and reaching my version of that pose one day, at the right time. 🙏🏼🙏🏼 <br />Thank you, Adriene, for helping me to bring this beautiful practice into my daily life.❤️",Rae Lou,2021-03-08T10:28:56Z,0

"Hi! I would just like to thank you. Last year around this time I first found your practises. I used to be a person who hated moving but I fell in love with you immediately. It helped me to calm myself and find what I actually want to be doing with my life. I slowly started working out as well and now that lazy person from last year loves moving, getting stronger, getting fitter. And even though I don&#39;t do yoga as often anymore, it was still something that helped me at the beggining which is always the hardest part. And everytime I find the time and come back to your practise I feel peace and love and I finally trust myself. I&#39;ll be thanking you for the rest of my life for that.

I felt strong and graceful and beautiful and even flew for one gorgeous second in crow. I started and finished Home last year, but had catastrophic accumulated injuries that made practice difficult.

"One present moment opens a window to the next. I finally found my way back...to Trust. Trusting my own personal process, knowing that I/we are always exactly where I/we need to be, and, everything is as it should be. It feels good to fly in dancer pose, to be in my body. It&#39;s a practice. Embrace grace. Thank you, endlessly, Adriene. Your energy shines to us the brightness of our own spirit.

Loved that - my practice had lots of breathing, as I wanted to honor the theme - kapalabhati, nadi shodhana, ujjayi...and I definitely went into boat so I could use my breath as my anchor.  From start to finish, this 30-day journey has been my favorite. I highlighted so many of these practices to come back to, and really worked on drishti this time around.

I never know what to do when you are in those positions and end up just standing around watching and feeling like a failure (cant trust thats where Im supposed to be lol).   Ive asked and asked this question and no one can seem to give me an answer.   I dont ever expect to fly in crow, and thats okay,  but I dont just want to be a lump on a log either..lol.

"Hi! So on day 27 Adrienne said “ Try not to look down.” The floor is there and you know it is there. Today whilst out hiking on quite a bumpy trail I heard those words-‘ don’t look down” and I had been looking down trying to place each footstep in a perfect spot in order to avoid twisting my ankle or worse. And my neck was sore form looking down and I wanted to look up instead of looking down. And so I did - look up. And I continued to walk look straight ahead and interestingly I became aware of so many of my senses giving me information about how to keep walking unafraid. My peripheral vision, my proprioception, and even the nerves in my feet all gave me information once I ‘trusted’. The next 5 km of my hike on that bumpy trail rendered my a complete change of attitude and I  looked up ahead the entire time. I get the phrase Adrienne uses, Trust yourself.",Linda Walsh,2021-01-31T23:57:47Z,1

was not at all planning to do this practice but after my warm up I felt that I needed to do something other than my planned weight training so I did this practice and at the start I was already feeling that my neck and traps were sore so I did a short massage then when it was incorporated once again at the end with the Savasana I knew that this practice was calling to me today!

"Me and my little sister have been doing these videos and it&#39;s been so much fun!!! I love bonding with her. Literally during today&#39;s video when you were leading into the crow position we were joking about how we couldn&#39;t do it, and then she just did it she wasn&#39;t even trying to!! Like, we both just stayed in the squat then she leaned into it and did it. We both were :000000 thank you so much I had so much fun today. I love your longer videos. Today&#39;s video also helped me come back from the edge of a panic attack 💕 I feel good again!",Tee,2021-01-30T05:22:52Z,1

"I&#39;ve been doing yoga every day for a little over 6 months now and I think this is the strongest and most sure of myself I have ever felt during practice. I kept falling out of dancer and I still can&#39;t do crow, but I didn&#39;t care. I was way more aware of the things that I could do than the things that I couldn&#39;t, which is what I think this journey is all about. Trusting myself and trusting what I have available to me in this moment. Only a few more days in this wonderful journey. Great job sticking with it everyone! We got this!",Avery Adventurous,2021-01-30T05:14:26Z,3

"After the bad week that I’ve had, I didn’t want to show up for this practice today. But I told myself that whatever I was feeling, I was going to use this practice to try to separate myself from the negativity and just let myself connect with my breath and anything that came with the practice. And I’m very glad I did. I was open to seeing what my body and mind needed, focusing on finding what felt good, and trusting that my body and mind would know what it needed to heal.

I often am inhaling and then I feel like I hit a brick wall - like I can&#39;t breathe in more physically but I mentally feel like I could. Almost as if my mind is saying &quot;no, you should be able to breathe in 10-15% more&quot;. It&#39;s been a big frustration of mine for years. Does anyone else have this happen to them?

I&#39;ve been doing yoga daily for a few years now and some(most) days I still struggle with crow! My advice is to really focus on your core- your weight isn&#39;t so much resting on your arms as it is being lifted by your abs.  It took along time for it to click flr me- it was actually one of Adriene&#39;s videos that made it click for me!,Jessblnchrd,2021-01-30T07:22:59Z,2
"I surprised myself today and out of nowhere I held my 1st crow pose! I only started doing regular yoga on and off for about a year now, but it definitely helps me be more in touch with my body. Honestly, before today I struggled with the pose. I’d say TRUST yourself and your body... don’t force yourself into the pose and keep practicing b/c maybe one day you will surprise yourself too :)",Hafsa Baig,2021-01-30T03:54:06Z,1
"Same for me. If I am resting my knees on my arms it is way too hurtful for me. I shifted my knees to the side and rather than resting on my arms I am squeezing  my knees against the outer edge of my arms...clamping my knees on my arms, if that makes sense. This is the only way I can do the crow pose.",Alexa Ertmer,2021-01-30T02:04:01Z,1

This is a powerful practice today. My mind knows that this practice and finding more grace and flexibility will take time. My ego however is frustrated and whiny and wants to give up. My sense of self however is saying &quot;trust the process&quot;. Today&#39;s practice was physically challenging but I was able to &#39;see&#39; how much progress I have made since day one. Kudos to everyone showing up. It really is the hardest part.,Corina Clouthier,2021-01-30T00:01:46Z,1
"In your previous videos, you have mentioned this mantra &quot;everything is as it should be&quot; that your mom taught you and from that time I carried it along with me and wrote it down on a sticky note and stuck it on my wall so I am constantly reminded that I am where I am supposed to be and everything happens for a reason. Thank you Adriene, sending warm hugs to you and everyone who&#39;s reading this ALSO kisses to Benji! :)",Sarah A,2021-01-30T00:00:35Z,0

"&quot;Everything is exactly as it should be&quot; is an affirmation I&#39;ve been using for a while. But it changed the game for me today when Adriene said, &quot;What if that were true?&quot;. It really softened something in me. Because if that were true, then it would all be okay. And, good news, it is true! We just have to return to the Truth that is right there always. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, Adriene. I feel like you and this whole community are holding my hand through my healing journey. Namaste. 💓✨",Kat Abrams,2021-01-29T23:49:27Z,2
"I am so grateful for this practice today (and everyday thus far). Today was emotionally hard. This idea of trusting the process, trusting yourself, trusting that everything is as it should be was exactly the reminder I needed to help bring me down from the disaster mindset I found myself in. And not only that, but noticing the progress I&#39;m making and strength I&#39;ve built from the daily practice helped to reinforce that trust even further and give me something positive to consider. I love the way you guide us, Adriene. You are an angel.",nixnoxnix,2021-01-29T23:48:50Z,1

But more and more, I&#39;m starting to <b>trust</b> that I can do it, even if 36 minutes seemed like an eternity before coming to the mat. Obviously, it flew by! <br />I have fallen head over heels in love with yoga thanks to the past 28 days, and I cannot wait to continue my yoga journey through the monthly calenders.

"Found Adriene, like a lot of people, back in spring 2020.  I tried a couple of other people first and then stumbled upon YWA and that was it and have not looked back.  I love that there is no music playing. Just silence or her encouraging, inspiring, wise--and sometimes silly--words.  I was slow to get into at first and would sometimes go more than a week before trying another video.   But now it&#39;s become a very important part of my life, helping me find equanimity, and I do the videos a few times a week.  Sometimes if I don&#39;t have time to put on a video, I just plop down on the floor and do some poses randomly during my day.  It&#39;s hard to describe how and why this is so beneficial.  As a younger person I thought yoga was a waste of time when I could be doing cardio or weights.  But, I get it now, and I&#39;m thankful to Adriene for her unique ability to make this feel accessible and worthwhile to so many, including me.  :)  PS--her green soup recipe is great if you haven&#39;t tried it.",Jennifer Morrell,2021-01-29T22:43:10Z,0

"Anyone here who always thinks it&#39;s one day less in the calendar? E.g. What day is today? And you reply &quot;28th Jan&quot; instead of 29th? I usually have FOMO but this practice is also teaching me it&#39;s ok to be behind or to not be where others, or worse you, would like to be. Thank you Adriene for teaching us to trust our intuition.

"Day 28! Trusting myself and you, Adriene, is what brings me here everyday. I know that in giving myself this time is what will assist me in the rest of my day and so here I am. Showing up, not knowing the challenges I’ll face or how I will challenge myself, getting through it, becoming stronger, mentally, physically, surprising myself, just wow. I’ve learned to use these as tools in my everyday life. So grateful for this journey. Thank you so much Adriene. With love and light, namaste. 🙏🏽🧘🏽‍♀️❤️✌🏽",Jessy Jess,2021-01-29T19:55:25Z,0
"The theme of today was about trust and I finally did the crow pose. I really didn&#39;t think I could do it before but I just did. It just happened. I trusted, maybe? Am I stronger maybe? I felt so great when I found out I can do it and how I can. There is a subtle balance point in the wrists and hand muscles that together they learn so easy to hold my weight all and only by themselves. But still, I see her hips are way higher than mine and mine looks like a baby scared and excited crow. Yayy 😇",Pooya Valinataj,2021-01-29T19:53:43Z,1

"I usually scan through the videos in the morning before coming to do them in the evening, just as a little heads up for the energy levels of the practice, and was a little apprehensive at seeing the crow pose again! But stuck with it and although was no where near the pose, managed a one legged crow for a second! Coupled with the standing bow (on one side, my ankle was not playing nicely one the other!)

I just got overwhelmed by a very stressful work day and the never ending pandemic and the tiny space I live in which can turn claustrophobic. I still told myself I would at least do Yoga even through the tears and with tissue in hand. Feel so much better for it. The matt now feels like this safe space where everything is okay to just be. What a beautiful thing to have. I hope you are doing better today yourself and like me, learn to do something for yourself daily. Thank you Adrienne !!!",Marta,2021-02-02T22:04:07Z,1

And as a person who remembers what it&#39;s like to be a little girl, I just wanted to say, I hope you continue to teach and be healthy and safe. You are a role model to me.

I still wasn&#39;t in the mood for doing yoga, especially a 36-minute-long video, but I needed to do at least a few stretches. So I pressed play and made it to the end.

I skipped yesterday because of some trouble I&#39;d been having with a sore shoulder.  Turns out if I had just read that yesterday&#39;s theme was HEAL I would have known it was just what I needed.  I&#39;m still learning to TRUST.  Today I did both yesterday and today&#39;s practice. And by listening a bit more carefully I learned how I injured my shoulder.  It will heal.

"Hi Adriene, thank you for another beautiful practice. I wanted to ask about holding tension in the stomach during breathwork. I had my appendix removed a few years ago and ever since I have found deep breathing mechanics difficult. This coupled with trying to understand if my belly should flow out on the inhale or the exhale, leaves me often tensing my stomach in the process. Do you have any tips on good breath mechanics in relation to the tummy? Thank you! &lt;3",Madeline O'Hara,2021-01-29T17:05:31Z,0

Facing a long window, I laid out my mat,  fire in the airtight stove beside me ,I practiced gazing at the fresh falling snow on the beautiful winter wonderland.  All practiced I had a sweet giggle, not only at myself in my outfit keeping warm, but in the anticipated Joy of what a great day, this day off I have will be . My 60 year old body is sending out a massive   Thanks for this precious month.",Anne Kern,2021-01-29T15:27:14Z,0

"Maybe this is my favorite Breath series video yet. Thank you, Adriene! I didn’t get a supine twist as my lil girl decided to climb onto my chest for extended savasana (more of a brag then complaint 😸). She always comes to investigate when she hears the intro music and your voice. Thank you for being a part of our morning routine. Love your show!",Crystal Rose,2021-01-29T15:20:18Z,0
I was able to lift my toes (a teeny tiny bit) off the mat today in Crow pose. Haven&#39;t done that in years. Have a great day everyone!,shleegar,2021-01-29T15:19:54Z,0

"Breath unlocks so much. And is so forgiving, if you muddle up or forget for a second, it&#39;s always ready. Felt good in that dancer and surprisingly more stable feelingly stepping back into lunge. Who knew? I trust you did. Thank you for today&#39;s practice.",Hanna Lingman,2021-01-29T15:01:45Z,1

"Adrieneee!! I did my first REAL crow pose today! I would always cheat, and have my knees lower than my biceps... hard to explain without showing you. Today felt so good. I felt like I was doing a ballet class, and rocking it. After a month of doubting myself while nothing seems to be happening, Trust was on point (Or on pointe? lol).

What did we do yesterday?  Feeling a little sore deep in my lower belly. Today’s movements were so spot on. I felt and just let the flow carry me along and I cease to think and just BE. ♥️♥️♥️✅  did not even feel like 37 mins. <br /><br />PS the cat cow reminded me I dreamed doing yoga last night.,raelyn earnest,2021-01-29T14:48:46Z,0

"Just as I was practically crying because I could not hold my balance, I heard the word &quot;acceptance,&quot; and I thought, ok, this is where I am, I won&#39;t fight it, I&#39;ll just be. And coming from me, that is a revelation! Thanks, Adriene.",Susan Bodiker,2021-01-29T14:40:23Z,0
"So as we look forward to February, I&#39;m seeking guidance on how best to continue this amazing practice.  This has been my first real attempt at yoga.  I&#39;d like to keep it going at least 3-4 days a week while incorporating running into my &quot;off days&quot;, eventually adding some functional strength training in there somewhere.  What&#39;s the best way to continue this self practice as a novice?  A few facts about me that may help guide answers, I&#39;m 42/M, around 180 pounds.  Have some lower back and neck issues that pop up from time to time (this practice has helped immensely).  I definitely can stand to do more breath work as well.  Thanks for any feedback!",Jason Sandmann,2021-01-29T14:37:22Z,0
"This was quite humbling. Sometimes, in the balancing poses, my right feet tenses up so much that it starts cramping, so I had to rewind the video and try once more, slowing it down, not even attempting the dancer pose but just listening to what my body feels and does when I stand with one leg lifted. But I think I got a step closer to figuring it out, and that&#39;s already a lot. And I even had a little &#39;hey-o!&#39; moment with myself at the end when Adriene said to open the legs out wide. Happy to be here, happy to have done it, as usual. 💜 Lots of love to all! Namaste.",u_k,2021-01-29T14:35:58Z,1

"Beautiful trust and balance poses today. &quot;Everything is as ti should be.&quot; and &quot;I am right where I&#39;m supposed to be.&quot; Day 28 TRUST was an important practice. I could feel that from the start. Adriene is preparing us, leading us toward the end of this 30 Journey and into a new beginning. I am so grateful to you, Adriene.

"Well the crow did not fly today but I did manage the one leg adventure and my kitty was so focused on her stretching!😻😊❤ trust you are where you should be, absolutely!",tina mcewin,2021-01-29T12:57:56Z,1
"I don&#39;t think I was truly aware of the benefits of this practice until today.... I managed to stay in crows pose just balancing on my hands for several seconds and several times. The last time we did crows practice in this program, I couldn&#39;t even let go once! What an amazing experience to surprise oneself with a stronger core and balance!

"Dear Adriene, I wasn&#39;t sure if I would show up on the mat today, I had a bad headache. Anyway, I did show up and it was wonderful.

"Glorious!  I know it sounds cheesy, but today&#39;s practice was just that - glorious!  I thought I had done crow pose before, but never like this.  And the balances were great too, barely a wobble.  Today has started well - chats with three friends, all of us venting our feelings over this covid stuff and daily niggles - and then this yoga practice.  Feeling lighter in mind, body and spirit.

"Breath Day 28! Day 117 in a row. An off day for me. Just did not enjoy the practice although on the surface, it looks like one I could enjoy. Fell all over the place. A bit frustrating as I found myself going through the motions UNTIL, somehow, after all the failing, I managed Crow pose for nearly half a minute until my left leg tightened. Go figure.  Maybe that is the crow secret. Squalk through through the practice and then just go into it with no expectation, just a whatever. Anyways, tomorrow is another day. I am sure most of you will enjoy today!💜",William B,2021-01-29T12:31:17Z,0

"Not only was that a hard practice physically, but mentally for myself today as well. It was another one of those having to get up even earlier so I could fit the practice in and my body wanting to just so badly stay cuddled up in bed. But I did it.

"During this practice I&#39;ve noticed I was a bit in self conflict with my intuition, because I don&#39;t listen to it sometimes. Acceptance and trusting myself was the hardest part. I&#39;ve maintained the synchronization of the movement with the breath, and relied on it&#39;s awareness through the practice, the core... But my mind was noisy on some imperfections during the practice. I did promise myself that I&#39;ll do better, but my mind remained noisy, so I believe my hidden truth is that I&#39;m a bit hard on myself when things aren&#39;t going the way it should.",Milan Brodsky,2021-01-29T11:31:08Z,0

"Wow, so many gems today! Every time you said &quot;trust that the ground is here&quot; during previous practices, and again today, it struck me as extremely simple yet profound. It really taps into the essence of trust and can be applied to so many things in life. Also, being exactly where I&#39;m supposed to be, literally and metaphorically, is something I often think about. I do believe it&#39;s true and I&#39;m really thankful to you for the reminder. As for the practice, it got a bit challenging at times and I couldn&#39;t do everything, but there were a couple of occasions where I was tempted to give up but stuck with it, and that was another proof that I am stronger than I often think I am.

"This was such a fun practice! I always love dancer pose. It really illustrates how much trust you have in yourself, your balance and that core strength. I can’t believe we only have a few days left! Hope everyone is well. Proud of us all :) namaste x",Jess Nolan,2021-01-29T10:15:00Z,0
"Wow. That went by quickly today. Thanks. I lost a bit of trust in the metal work in my left ankle today. Also reflecting how far I have come on it in the last 25 months with massive help from yoga. To think I can do high lunges is pretty amazing. I guess it’s allowed a few tweaks !! See you you all tomorrow. My mind starting to wander to day 30 and beyond. Found I had trust that all will be well and as it should be. Thanks so much for this 30 days. An amazing start to what could have otherwise have been a very challenging year.

"I really loved the practice today.  Super flow at a really enjoyable pace.  I wobbled a bit on the left sided dancer pose and my poor cat Phoebe got a foot on her head.  That put me off a little as I felt so bad, but I managed to gain my balance again for the right side.  Dont worry I gave her lots of cuddles afterwards.  She often joins me on the mat, so I hope this hasnt put her off.",Beverley Fathers,2021-01-29T09:59:53Z,0

"So I kind of procrastinated getting the mat this morning because I knew this was a longer practice and I was nervous. So I was on social media for about 30 minutes right when I woke up. By the time I got to my mat I was so frustrated with myself for “ruining” the start of my day but once I got on my mat I told myself “let’s reset” and then all of the things Adriene said today “you are exactly where you’re supposed to be” etc really helped. Yes, this practice was challenging but did I do it? Yes!!! I’m exactly where I need to be and I have the power to change my outlook on my day, it’s not ruined! It’s only just getting started and I took time for myself this morning, there’s nothing more beautiful than that! Namaste everyone, see you tomorrow 🙏🏻 thank you, as always, Adriene 💗",Julia,2021-01-29T07:19:28Z,1
Thank you for sharing! I felt the same. But I was craving a longer practice for days now and when I saw 36 days I jumped to the mat. You are exactly where you are supposed to be. Keep showing up it will get easier each time. 😊,Μαρία Καρπάθη,2021-01-29T09:43:09Z,0

I&#39;m pretty sure that I&#39;ll do another 30 day journey after this to keep going. I do it first thing in the morning and I love the structure it gives me.
