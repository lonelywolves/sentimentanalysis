"When you invited us to finish the sentence &quot;I choose . . . &quot; I immediately thought of how I&#39;ve been yelling at my kids, and inserted &quot;unconditional love.&quot; I hoped this could be my intention for the coming day of parenting. But the second time you prompted &quot;I choose,&quot; and I inserted &quot;unconditional love,&quot; I realized that it had to be &quot;unconditional love of myself.&quot; And then I started crying. I guess you really have to put the oxygen on yourself before you can assist others with their oxygen, don&#39;t you? Thanks again, Adriene.",April Knopper,2021-03-30T17:34:16Z,3

"My body says thank-you for all the hip opener poses AND the core practice with those fabulous bird-dog movements in the video intro. That thing that looked like a sideways crow pose; well, let&#39;s just say it&#39;s not in my vocabulary yet, so I instead stayed in a squat and worked with that.

Oh, grasshopper, you knew not what we were all heading into in that new year. For some reason, thinking about the poignency of that moment in time and what we have all endured for the past year plus made me weep. Also: I was sort of able to do side crow -- my first time ever.

"I always forget to say thank you after each video, and I shouldn&#39;t forget, because your videos have been so good for me in more ways than I could have imagined when I started yoga to support my horseback riding- it has become a huge transformative experience for me both physically and mentally, I am actually a recovering alcoholic, and I had a bit of a struggle the other day, I have started a job working with horses that is 90% back breaking, joint destroying physical labour, and it is getting to me, I actually bought some whiskey and drank a little until i realized I was just hot and nauseous, certainly no closer to peace or comfort- I realized I truly don&#39;t even want it or need it anymore, yoga fills me and helps me feel what I sought for so long through alcohol (cannabis might have helped a bit too, haha- this stuff can save lives. How alcohol, which destroyed and almost ENDED my life through liver and acute renal failure, can be legal when weed is not baffles me, but this is not the time or place for that argument, sorry! It has really helped me stay sober in the ways that matter to me, though...)<br />You have helped me unearth the tools and strength I had inside me all along, and for that I can NEVER thank you enough, Adriene- you are so awesome, keep doing what you do!<br />THANK YOU SO MUCH!",pariah mouse,2020-11-29T20:44:36Z,0

"This practice came to me at the exact right moment. I have been waiting for therapy for over a year now, and after being referred for a 3rd time it finally seemed that I found a place that could help me. The intake process was heavy and took over a month, but I kept saying to myself that this fight was worth it. Yesterday that place unfortunately told me that they are also not able to help me, and hearing that felt like I was hit with a heavy brick. Now I have to get back on an another waiting list (for the 4th time) and wait for at least a couple of months/half a year to hopefully finally get the help I need. This practice reminded me that this is all part of the journey, and that there will be light at the end of this tunnel. Thank you so much Adriene! &lt;3 xxx",chocolatecurls94,2020-11-20T15:12:17Z,1

"TW: Self-harm/suicide/depression <br />-----<br />Day 19 of November 2020 - Ground: Yesterday I spent the day in bed trying (and often failing) to resist the urge to hurt myself because I didn&#39;t want to live anymore. Today I woke up feeling numb and sore and drained, but Adriene&#39;s invitation to accept who/where you are today and &quot;not who or where you were yesterday&quot; really hit home. It&#39;s a running joke in my family the amount of times medical professionals have suggested I try yoga to cure my depression, and whilst it by no means has, it gets me out of bed most mornings and allows me to forgive myself.

Can somebody give me an advice if this 1 month challenge is okay for me if I am a beginner or should i start with some other videos ?,Kateryna Zhurova,2020-07-11T21:51:50Z,0
"I&#39;ve gone to quite a few teachers and I think Adriene is a fantastic beginner teacher. If you haven&#39;t done any yoga with a teacher before however I would recommend starting with her foundations yoga pose videos. You can also google yoga tips and individual poses for how to do them correctly. You want to make sure you&#39;re not improperly aligned while doing the poses. Always keep a microbend in your joints to protect them. Don&#39;t overstretch. Remember that nothing should hurt or feel uncomfortable. Listen to your body. How you move on the mat can change your neural pathways off the mat (so awesome!). You&#39;ll be totally fine doing her 1 month challenges though. If it&#39;s ever too much, just sit in child&#39;s pose and listen until you are able to control your breathing again. Then rejoin when you&#39;re ready. Child&#39;s pose is yoga. Yoga is the union of breath and body. That&#39;s what you should focus on to reap the best mental rewards. The physical rewards will come. Good luck! It&#39;s fun.",Emma Jones,2020-07-31T16:08:11Z,0

"Hello ywa community, I was wondering if I could get some advice with elevating my practice. I would consider myself an intermediate yogi, I have been practicing yoga as a supplement to my cardio and strength training for a few years now. I’ve been doing yoga more frequently, maybe 4-5 short sessions per week for the last few months. However, I cannot seem to hold any arm balances for more than a brief moment, and I want to start using them as transitions between poses. Since I do believe I have enough upper body strength, I think I am having issues with the mental aspect of it as well as balance. Does anyone have any advice for this?",Lauren A,2020-07-09T18:21:08Z,0

"Hey guys, I just wanted you to know that even though Adriene is super responsible and always tells us to be careful and respect our body, you should be extra careful and do some stretching with your arms if you see that there won&#39;t be much in the practice. I did this video on July the first and when she asked us to go half way down on plank, I hurt my left shoulder blade kinda bad. I couldn&#39;t move for the rest of the day without feeling pain. My boyfriend had to help me so I could dress and undress my shirt! And yesterday I decided to just rest and don&#39;t do any yoga at all, so I could recover.

"Wow, I needed this. So glad I did this session before climbing into bed. Ever since I had to let go of my cat companion after 20 years together, practicing yoga has been so hard for me … because whenever I close my eyes on the mat and breathe I always revisit her final moment and breaths and I tear up. Your constant &#39;you got this&#39; helped me get through. The poses were manageable, except for the arm balance, but the mental part of it all is so challenging right now. I choose to … let go – of my guilt, my I-wish-I-could-have-done-more, my lovely cat. <br />I hope I&#39;ll transition into a new phase with you this month and start to enjoy yoga again. &lt;3 Much love.",Maggie,2020-07-01T22:56:04Z,2

Everything about accepting and embracing who I am today rather than thinking about who I was yesterday really resonated - yesterday it happened that I had barely slept and felt terrible all day, and ended up having a big long cry in the evening feeling really hopeless about the state of so many aspects of our world and so fearful for the future.

It has my favourite sharks fin child’s pose and full extended lizard great for this senior yogi.

"Thank you Adriene..  I met you and your videos at the very hard time in my life. I was going through some loss pain of mine and I started to watch you withouth knowing anything about yoga or meditation. The first time the door of acceptance, observation and grace opened with you. After that every internal approaches to things changed in my life. Especially to myself. Now i realized it was 1 year ago, July is special for me. When you say take care of each other I realized you were the first and the best one took care of me and to my soul at that times and after that I started to take care of myself with &quot;love&quot;. It is journey and it started here.. Thank you and thank universe, I am grateful for your existance.",Merve Sayın,2020-07-01T06:33:22Z,2

And I am so glad I took the leap of faith. This video had that healing love, that space to be who you are and I was pleasantly surprised to learn a new pose, the sidearm crow pose. <br />This only goes on to show that taking a leap of faith with the right people can be wonderful. So much love to you Adriene. <br />I know you like to say this, but allow us to say this to you : &quot; Thank you for sharing your time &amp; energy with us! It means a lot to us.

"Day 1 Meditate! May 1. I started the new month off getting up earlier and finding a section of the river near my house I was previously unaware of. After walking three hours and taking a longer than planned nap, I found the pace of this one a little fast 🤪. I may start the day with YWA before my walk next time. Still troubled by tightness behind my knees. Feels a little better after this practice, but I probably need some advice on how to work out the tendon. Other than that, I have to find some way to practice in my apartment so that I am not so close to the wall when Adriene directs us to put an arm out in front, 😋.",William B,2020-05-01T06:40:24Z,1

But the voice in my head that is on <b>my</b> team said, “this is exactly when you need to stick to your practice!” So with diligence and grit, I faced the mat. Sure enough, monkey mind kicked in shortly after beginning, but I pushed through. By about 1/3, I was focused and breathing like my life depended on it! Thank you, Adriene. Some days are harder than others, but I always love your show!!",Crystal Rose,2020-02-17T17:28:48Z,0

"I have been so busy with life and not having enough energy before work for the past few months. Ill do it here and there which isnt how i am when it comes to yoga. I used to do yoga every day because its my passion but lately its been different. I also havent done yoga on my days off in a while because motivation and i have other stuff i want to do outside of work.<br /><br />Today starting the New Year and knowing this year will be awesome for me, i chose this video. Towards the end when we laid on our backs and said “i choose to be the best version of myself” over and over i had goosebumps and im so teary eyed right now. Im so happy i got myself to do this. I am ready this year and going to get back into my routines, im going to make this year even better than last.<br /><br />Thankyou Adriene. This is my 4th year watching your videos💜💚 you and yoga truly changed who i am and how i am. Have a wonderful year💚💜",Maizy Kuzawa,2020-01-05T16:14:31Z,1

Adriene ... This year I realized it was a perfect gift for my select friends who &quot;get&quot; yoga to share your 30 Day Calendar and explanation of Yoga with Adriene You tube.  I have never sent a message out about a website to friends and children but this was the right time and right gift. The gift of Yoga with Adriene.<br />Thank you for helping me embrace a 2020 full of unexpected drama with our political environment and other drama.  I will be turning to my yoga practice with you to help finding joy in the present moment. Worry about the future creates unhealth.<br />Have joy in the new year and health every day.<br />....

"Adriene, this practice brought me to tears. Doing yoga over the last few months has shown me how strong and capable I am. I choose to take up space, breathe deeper, and grow into the woman I am this year. Much love from South Korea. &lt;3","Allison, here.",2019-12-31T18:12:21Z,0
"Another great stretching video! Thank you Adriene. But wait, side crow?!? I can’t do that! Lol. May I drop a suggestion here, if you see this? Will you make a playlist or quick videos specifically for warm-ups? I like to choose random videos or follow your monthly calendars and sometimes jumping straight into moves my hips or shoulders weren’t ready for make me stop and pick your other videos to warm up. But it’d be so much easier and appreciated if you compiled your warm-up vids or make one meant for warming up before a yoga flow practice! That’ll help a lot. Hope you’ll consider it or that it’s on your agenda! Thanks again for everything 🙏🏻",millennium,2019-12-31T18:10:33Z,0

"At the beginning of this month I was in the hospital after a suicide attempt and struggling with over 20 years of trauma and abuse and on top of that my son having to be in long term hospitalization and the death of a family member and having to cut out toxic family, I had lost everything even myself. All in the last three months. I never felt more unlovable in my life. And I remembered how much yoga and specifically your yoga helped to keep me centered and in the present and just genuinely better about myself. So I’m just saying thank you for your videos since starting back with your videos I haven’t had a panic attack or as many suicidal thoughts in the last few weeks. So thank you. And I choose to live. ❤️",Brittney Crow,2019-12-31T15:28:28Z,0

"Dear Adrienne,<br />I looooove your practices!<br />In this one my challenge goes with my arms, they are shortish in the sense that I do not always manage to put my palm on the floor when is asked for. For this reason those lateral balance exercises are forbidden to me (also because I don&#39;t have much strength in the arms and I am out of shape).<br />But I definitely love the practice! I will follow HOME, and I know it will be exiting.<br />I wish you all the best for 2020!!!",Giulia Vitali,2019-12-31T11:40:55Z,0

As tricky as the year has been, it&#39;s been a great comfort and source of healing to have you living inside my computer, telling me to bend my body this way and that (in a nice way, obvs!) and I just want you to know how grateful I am for you and your videos.

"Hi Renata! There is a Prenatal Yoga For All Trimesters available in the FWFG Membership - <a href=""http://fwfg.com/"">fwfg.com</a> and in the shop - <a href=""https://do.yogawithadriene.com/"">https://do.yogawithadriene.com/</a>, if you&#39;re interested. <br /><br />In general, most women are able to continue a regular practice through month eight if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. <br /><br />As always, consult your doctor/physician before starting and follow their advice. xx",Yoga With Adriene,2019-12-31T11:49:54Z,0

Never judge me always help me to see the bright side:-)<br />I tell everybody that you my best friend ( you just don’t know it).

"This session felt like you were talking to me. I needed it. Been following you on and off for years so obviously already appreciate you but it meant extra today. Went through a life-threatening autoimmune disorder this summer complete with steroids. Anyone familiar knows how crappy the side-effects are. An extra hit given all the weight I&#39;ve gained and how out of shape I&#39;ve gotten because of work. To make a short story long, thank you.",Robin Satterwhite,2019-12-30T19:04:38Z,0

"Yoga With Adrienne I am 65, I used to do a lot of yoga, and want to make this a part of my life again. I signed up for the 30 days and have been trying to prepare myself by doing some sessions before it begins, like this one today. I got 6 minutes in and now am so discouraged..I don’t know how to adjust what you are doing to the abilities I do have :-(  perhaps you could suggest one of your other videos if we are not able to do this yet? You have a massive body of work, which I am so grateful for and I am overwhelmed to look through. Ideal for me, would be if you could tell us what to do ‘if this movement is too difficult’ ?  I want to know how to keep going. Thank you 🙏.",sharon ferguson,2019-12-30T17:01:42Z,0

I think I saw the promo video on the January 1st and thought...”why not try this?” I had been off the mat for over 5 years and needed a kick start. Now as we are closing out the year, I am proud that I have been practicing daily. Your encouragement and instruction is amazing. While there are still poses that I have not mastered, I have learned to be okay with this gradual building of strength and flexibility. Thank you so much!

"Leave it to the Americans to co opt , distort, and misinterpret a thousands year old knowledge. <br />They can’t even get the name right. <br />It’s HATHA Yoga or bodily postures , NOT simply Yoga. <br />Patanjilis Yoga Sutras contain 8 separate  aspects with sub sets containing but not limited to , bodily postures , pranayama or alternate breathing to meditation . <br />It is very misleading and destructive to use Hatha yoga in ways that were never intended. <br />The postures were never meant to be exercise and there is no emphasis on perfection of the pose . <br />They were designed to be done prior to pranayama and meditation as a means of removing physical stiffness and tension,followed by alternate nostril breathing which lowers the breath rate allowing for a smoother more effective means of starting meditation.",Sirios Star,2019-12-30T07:06:38Z,0

"Well that was just what I needed.<br /><br />When you spoke offinding something to be grateful for, my first thought was you. A year ago today, I broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years.  Then, a friend recommended 30 days of yoga and I started in the first day of the new year.  I&#39;ve been practicing daily ever since, most days with one of your videos.<br /><br />Today, I&#39;m in the middle of another transition: that of possibly, in the future, becoming a single parent. It&#39;s terrifying and exhilarating but yoga helps me to stay grounded and balanced. <br /><br />So thank you. Thank you for your kindness and encouragement, your help and openness. Your videos have come to mean a great deal to me and hopefully, they will keep being so in the future. <br /><br />Thank you, and I hope you have a wonderful new year full of love, strength and the ability to accept and bend with change. I hope you feel as loved as your videos make us feel. <br /><br />Thank you.",Ginnyvos,2019-12-30T06:01:49Z,2

I started to step through but I hesitated because the other side looked like empty space. Then some out of focus light appeared - I had this sense that it could be anything, and wondered, what would I need to see to feel comfortable, motivated, to step through?

"I choose purpose. Watch out, long sappy comment coming! 😂 I have been practicing with you for several years now, and it has been absolutely life changing. I found your community when I was knee deep into a degree in chemistry and completely miserable. Fast forward a few years and now I&#39;m taking the plunge from a life as a chemist that doesn&#39;t fulfill me into yoga teacher training. Tomorrow will be my first practice in a studio and in a way I have felt sad as if I&#39;m losing my unique connection here. But while this is a goodbye in a way, it&#39;s not a goodbye to practicing YWA. It&#39;s just a goodbye to the girl who lived for those 20 minutes of peace in the chaos. It&#39;s goodbye to the girl who wished she had chosen differently on so many things. But, it&#39;s a hello to the woman who is living with purpose. It&#39;s a hello to the woman who is going to create that peace every day. It&#39;s a hello to the woman who is going to make choices that are good and helpful to herself and the people around her. It&#39;s a hello to coming HOME. Both on my mat in my own yoga nook, and on my mat in a studio where I will learn to serve peace and purpose to others who need it just as badly as I do.

"Dear Adriene, just wanted to write you all the way from The Netherlands, about how thankful I am for your videos. This year, I&#39;ve discovered yoga and truely gave it a chance to practice it, first on a monthly then on a weekly and now almost on a daily basis. I&#39;ve been struggling with a lot of pain in my back, neck and shoulders for a year now, and no one seems to really find where it&#39;s coming from. It&#39;s been hard to focuss on the good when you&#39;re in daily pain. That&#39;s why I decided to quit my job and get back to basic, by focussing on my health first. The past 2 months I began to do yoga more frequently (mostly with your videos) and meditation, I&#39;ve been walking a lot outside in nature to clear my mind and really focussed on doing what FEELS good to me. And guess what? The pain is getting better. Not only do I see that result, I&#39;ve become stronger mentally, fysically, emotionally, I&#39;ve got more patience and energy and also found a way into opening up to spirituality (which I first never ever did). So by closing this year, I would like to thank you so so much by still uploading new videos and for helping me on the other side of the world to accept, love and believe in myself. I can&#39;t wait for new videos to come in 2020. Namasté &lt;3",Sibylle Dunn,2019-12-29T20:52:51Z,0

"This was an absolutely brilliant session, I did it after cozy flow and should’ve done them the other way round but no worries I enjoyed both equally. They are both sessions you can go back to and repeat. Thank you so much lovely Adrienne for always being my ‘balance’ to wake up to on a Sunday morning here in the UK. I can’t wait for 30 days of ‘home’ in January. Namaste 🙏🏽",NatRisp,2019-12-29T09:41:04Z,1

"I really needed this new practice today. From feeling low, with a little injury, I have been dipping in and out of the calendar this month, missing my core practices. But today was good, this senior yogi has got some mojo back ! There were two moments I specially loved, the transition into extended child’s pose to my favourite sharks fin and the forearm lizard with leg lifted. That did it for me. Thank you from my heart to yours Adriene and for the email today. We are looking forward to an awesome January and HOME 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💞",Gill Smith,2019-12-29T08:47:35Z,1
