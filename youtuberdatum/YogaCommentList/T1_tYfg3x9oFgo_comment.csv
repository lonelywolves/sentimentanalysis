I&#39;m slowly becoming ok with doing some more of the &#39;easier&#39; movements sometimes, choosing the child&#39;s pose instead of downward dog today - recognising what my body needs and finding what feels good . I&#39;ve found myself missing a few days for whatever reason and feeling bad about it but then I think to myself what would Adriene say lol and I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;d say to be gentle with myself and know this is always there for me when i need it.

This was the first day I nearly skipped - yesterday I could only do half since I got a neck pain in the morning from some sort of a click in my vertebrae and couldn’t move much for most of the day. And today I was still in a bit of pain in the morning but after a zoo trip and watching football with beers I realised I hadn’t done my yoga at 11pm and still got on my mat. Feeling proud now and the pain has finally disappeared :) looking forward to the last few days of the challenge now and going to start Adriene’s other challenges after:) I’ve done yoga for 4 years at face-to-face classes but never this regularly and it really is helping as a great support for all the other exercise and work as a source of focus and inspiration !,Jenni Kähkönen,2020-06-19T22:09:56Z,0

"Hello Adriene, <br /><br />My words can not describe a gratitude I feel towards you. I started my journey a little less than a year ago. Prior to that I have never(even in the school due to health reasons) did sport or anything even remotely close to a physical activity. As an adult, I did have some attempts to get fit but i could never commit. About a year ago I started your “30 days yoga”. My journey was not perfect. I started from the beginning at least times. I understood that I’m not going to be able to do it everyday but promised myself that no matter how long it will take - I’ll finish it. It took me 6 months. But eventually I fulfilled my promise. It was a first program that I actually managed to complete in my whole life. Since I started doing this, I also explored other activities like running and dancing. Little by little I actually started loving sport and being active. It’s now really a routine. I never stopped doing yoga though. Sometimes in class, sometimes with your videos. I’m writing this because after this practice today I attempted to do a bakasana. And I did it. It was only for a few second but I still did it. I  cried after this. A year ago I could not do a downward facing dog without being out of breath. And now I’m here. And it’s all thanks to the feeling that I got after your every video. It took time, but eventually I craved more and more. Thank you so much! You really changed my life.",Marina Kotova,2020-05-26T19:22:28Z,0
"It&#39;s such an amazing thing to see that I&#39;m actually evolving in some of the postures! Like the one with the leg lift felt so difficult in day 26(?)  but now, a day later I can already see or at least feel the difference! Thank you so much Adriene for giving me this feeling.",saara,2020-05-26T12:38:55Z,0

"Hi everyone. This 30 day journey is the first time I actually learn and practice yoga in my life and doing yoga with Adriene these days had save me from myself.

"really couldn&#39;t be bothered with my yoga today was starting up the video thinking  I would probably give up. Then I remembered the night before I had been listening to a tennis podcast and this grand slam winning professional tennis player talked about competitiveness and being competitive with your mind when you feel like you don&#39;t want to do something. So this morning my mind didn&#39;t want me to do it for some reason, so i thought, no, I am going to prove you wrong and do a great practice, watch this.

"loved today&#39;s practice. Maybe it was my subconscious keeping Integrate in mind, or maybe the practice is starting to show through, but I found an ease in my practice. I was able to grow taller in my cobras then ever before (felt a little tension in a few and had to shrink them down), and a newfound ease (and dare I say grace??) in my vinyasas. I&#39;m very happy and grateful for my practices, and I definitely want to keep this up. Thank you Adriene, and namaste!",honey Blue,2020-04-24T19:20:23Z,1

"Hey Adriene, I was wondering, you teach with taking the breath in we should think of a downward forth while filling the belly in full of air. Then when breathing out there is this upward force while dropping the shoulders. Both making this up down circular circuit. Is that synonymous with the up/down flow of energy coming from the Earth that you mentioned in one of the videos a few days back? Should we think about both at the same time? I&#39;d like to marry both somehow because I like this circular flow of energy concept. But finding it hard to get my head around it :)",Simon KP,2020-04-20T02:44:38Z,0

"I never did yoga before and now I just finished day 27 (almost) in a row with the Home Journey! I simply love it, and I love the way Adriene makes me feel that whatever I am doing it is perfectly ok. I am so very not bendy but I feel that it has become a little bit better during the last weeks - however I can only still dream of flat feet during downward facing dog - maybe in the next 30 day journey ;-) Today´s practice was awesome - I however did a hardcore legtraining yesterday, and I could &quot;enjoy&quot; that during the practice this morning! I am planning to do more yoga in my life and it will definitely still be with Adriene &lt;3",Mathilde Lester,2020-04-18T08:18:56Z,0

"Had a bit of a shock when I realised at the start that it&#39;s DAY 27!!!!!!! how time has moved, wow. This practise was incredible, I feel so alive and connected with my body.

I feel so much more flexible and mobile during the day, my breathing has improved for the better (but I did quit smoking during the course of this), my back feels so much better and text neck is improving and whereas downward dog felt like a chore at first, it is now a position of repose. Yesterday, I finally managed to touch the soles of my feet to the ground in down dog. Was a deep stretch and I felt it, for sure, but if you had asked that of me on day one? No way.",Kat S,2020-03-22T09:17:01Z,0

"Thank you for this message. I needed to be reminded to &quot;keep the things that make me happy and let go of the things that don&#39;t.&quot; Its been a rough few years and I think its finally narrowing down to a crossroad that will forever change my life. Quite honestly, I&#39;ve already changed so much, my life has already changed considerably. I love myself now. Not just like me, but LOVE ME. And that is such a beautiful thing, it really is. I hope everyone can get to this point in their lives where they truly love themselves. So maybe this impending crossroad isnt the beginning of my transformation but my finalization. Not that all is over, but either crossroad will be shedding an illusion. That&#39;s always a good thing. Whatever happens, it&#39;s for my good. My greater good. &quot;The Universe is for me and so is everything else.&quot;  Thank you for that mantra and all the others you have bestowed upon us.

"Hi<br />I&#39;m new to all this, started about a month ago. I was recommended to start yoga by my Ms nurse. I got diagnosed with multiple sclerosis about 2 years ago with lesions on my brain and spine, I also have a considerable amount of inflammation on my spine, (c2 and c3) spasticity in my legs and arthritis in my ankles . Yep I&#39;m just falling apart lol it&#39;s been a tough 12 months. Previous to this I&#39;ve always been very fit and healthy apart from the issues with my feet. I was wondering if there is any particular yoga sessions that you would recommend to help me build up the strength back into my legs and spine and to help strengthen my ankles as the arthritis is making them very weak.<br />Thank you for all the videos you have done so far. They&#39;re all great and already helping me so much not just physically but mentally. I will beat this but will appreciate any help x",Julie Finch,2020-02-17T21:40:43Z,0

With focused breath and the thumbnail foreshadowing, I was able to hold my standing splits (but not my breath! Thankfully) and even Flash was not trying to knock me off my focus. At the end, I held Flash’s paw and breathed easy, knowing I had nurtured my breath, my heart, my body, and my kitty cat! Thank you, Adriene. We love your show 🐾",Crystal Rose,2020-01-29T20:06:25Z,0

New neural pathways are being created.<br /><br />I had a magical moment after practice as I sat cross legged, hands to heart. I came into stillness, and in that instant I felt something that made me laugh...I touched something, and something touched me. <br /><br />The Universe is saying, “I got this.

"Wow, what a beautiful practice for Day 27! When I first began practicing with you early last year, you were coaching on alignment in downward dog when you said not to worry about the heels dropping down, that one day with regular practice, we’d feel them touch the mat. You talked about downward dog eventually becoming a resting posture, and I remember laughing out loud, feeling the impossibility of that as I bent my knees and pushed my hips up and tried so hard to keep my back from rounding that I shook in the posture. As punishing as my early days in downward dog felt, I remember the satisfaction of sticking with it, even then. I remember when my heels really did surprise me weeks later, as they grounded suddenly and firmly into the mat below me. In the following months, I remember finding a strength and grace in downward dog that I never thought I would feel. And today, TODAY I USED DOWNWARD DOG AS A RESTING POSE. BY CHOICE.<br /><br />Ooh, it feels good to Find What Feels Good!",Abi GoLucky,2020-01-29T05:34:54Z,1

Your HOME 30 day journey is the best of your 30 day journeys for me - particularly since I am recovering from an injury and have had to adapt.,ev hanson-florin,2020-01-29T04:23:25Z,1

"Couple questions: 1) Have you ever done a standalone yoga nidra practice?  I realize most people aren&#39;t accustomed to that long a relaxation but I find it awesome and would love to have you guide such a practice. It&#39;s also a great opportunity to explore the body, mind and spirit/heart/breath and something that can aid healing from injuries. 2) Why is Marjarasana (cat pose) called cat cow in the US when it is simply cat in both Sanskrit and Commonwealth countries where most yoga is derived from its place of origin, India?

"I wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;d make it onto the mat today. I was up until 4:00 am last night with a short-circuited fire alarm and a visit from the fire department to my home. I swapped my normal wake up yoga for some extra sleep before school and was nervous I wouldn&#39;t make it back. Alas, I did and I believe this was one of my most focused and yummy practices.

"I used to be a ballet dancer, but because of my main career goal, I had to change my focus in life. I am trying to become a dedicated doctor. However, I was unable to manage my time and life in a way that I wanted. I became very distant from the world of ballet and dance for about 6 years, and I didn&#39;t really like Yoga despite the fact that my mother always tried to convince me that I needed Yoga. Last year, I unintentionally took a Yoga class at my university, and I realized that how my mind had been very distant from my body in a way that I didn&#39;t really take care of my body. I had even gained too much weight, and everyone kept saying, &quot;Wow!! You have changed so much!&quot; These words used to bother me a lot, but now through Yoga, I am able to find the balance between my body and my mind. I have even started ballet workouts alongside Yoga. Yoga helps me find balance in life, while Ballet allows me to regain my body form before this transformation. Through Yoga, I have also learned to be aware of my breaths, and this fact really helps me with ballet. This journey has been very beneficial to me, and it really allows me to reach my New Year&#39;s resolutions. I am very determined to take care of my body and my mind this time, and I&#39;m very grateful for this journey that has challenged me to believe in myself. Thank you for this channel and this beautiful journey. I hope that you have more challenges for the upcoming months because I really love challenges. Thank you a hundred times more and take care, Adriene!! :)",Anagole Akhavan,2020-01-28T18:26:31Z,0

"Day 27: Integrate. I just love it when the practice starts with the extended child posture. It&#39;s become a favourite. But, I must confess, the wind releasing pose tops the list for me XD Sorry if that&#39;s gross. Anyways, one thing I noticed is that the skin on my face has become cleaner than before. My skin is very sensitive and if I don&#39;t exercise regularly (which purifies the blood), my skin becomes shaded with dry patches. It gets flaky. And no moisturiser can do what regular yoga and exercise can do. (or maybe a mix of both lol). Thank you, Adriene, for this lovely practice. I am grateful. Namaste.",rubyveil19,2020-01-28T14:21:56Z,2

Today I noticed I&#39;m getting stronger, it is very subtle but my chaturanga is getting less challenging to do. I am carrying little things from other days into my practices (taking up space when I reach up, embracing the tremble and fall because that&#39;s what it feels like to be alive, and trying to keep returning to the breath even when my mind disagrees).

We have just moved into our dream home and I thought there is no yoga challenge that could be more apt. With fires raging around our beautiful country and so much stress and sadness, I was able to take a breath with you every morning and prepare for the day.

It is exciting that we are nearly home but also a little sad that we are near the end. I hope I can continue my morning practice with you . Thank you Adriene.

"When I started this month, I was embarrassed that downward dog felt difficult...I felt like I couldn&#39;t catch a full breath in and my shoulders were unhappy.

Now downward dog it&#39;s so easy hehe, I don&#39;t feel pain anymore and I can take many full breaths.
