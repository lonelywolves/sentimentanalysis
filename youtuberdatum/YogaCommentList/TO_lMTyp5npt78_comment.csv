This video in particular is what helps my body back to normal. I used to resist yoga as something that I couldn&#39;t do, because it caused so much pain. But in videos, you&#39;re always sending &quot;do what you can&quot; messages, and they&#39;ve helped me ease into yoga.",Karis Welsh,2021-01-13T14:09:00Z,0

I am a huge yoga with Adriene fan! That being said this was not my first time practicing with her but it was my first time in quite a while. Adriene‚Äòs guidance throughout this entire video was extremely helpful. I was able to control my breathing and truly feel a deep deep stretch in my upper back. I am an elementary school teacher who works from home and I have been harboring all of my stress in my upper back probably because I sit at my desk all day and stare at my screen. This practice was absolutely incredible. I‚Äôm going to be doing it every day until my upper back is a little bit more calmed down. I highly recommend this practice especially to those who are working from home or those who spend a long period of time sitting in an uncomfortable computer chair.

"Hello Adrienne, Thankfully, I want to share with you that my daughter (22years old ) and I (58 years old) have been doing Yoga with you, since pandemia started in Mexico by the middle of March 2020. We started with your 30 day yoga videos, the first time we finished the sequence of the complete 30 days including Saturdays and Sundays, we felt so successful and grateful to you ( you will never know how much yo have helped to our physical and mental health. <br />We live in Cuernavaca , Morelos, Mexico. After the third month of your 30 days videos, we started to pick a different video for each day, according our necessities as you always say ‚Äú listening to the needs of our bodies‚Äù , for lower back, for upper back, to relax, to sleep, etc . We do yoga with you every day, now we are doing it from Monday to Friday but if one of us is in pain or in need we do it even on Saturday or Sunday. What you have done putting your videos at no cost and available to everybody no matter where we are. That is the way we found you and you have really reached to us. We love you Adrienne. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EXISTING, AND DO WHAT YOU DO. YOU ARE AWSOME. We admire you so much. We sent you our very best wIshes for whatever you need. THANK YOU SOOO SOOOOO MUCH.

"After this practice I&#39;ve been saying &quot;wow!&quot; all day. I have been dealing with chronic back pain (typically behind one of my shoulderblades) for more than 2.5 years now, and I&#39;ve done loads of physical therapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, (You name it I&#39;ve probably tried it) to deal with this pain. At this point in my life it is usually barely noticeable, but I still have my good days and bad days.<br /><br />My back was giving me a lot of grief this morning... I felt like there was a big knot behind my shoulder blade and my first thought was &quot;oh no, not again...&quot; I decided to try this video to help stretch it out, and just... wow. This is a powerful practice for sure. I had to be gentle and slow with myself, listening to my body, and I noticed that many of these poses targeted the exact muscles I have issues with. It was kind of painful at some points in the practice, but with Adriene&#39;s help I just breathed through the muscles and asked them to please relax. I am thankful that Adriene constantly reminded me to relax my shoulders, as it is a habit of mine to shrug them up and tense them. <br />I am just so amazed right now because immediately after finishing the practice, my pain dialed down from about a 6/10 to a 2/10. Hours later, it is still feeling much better. Pain is still present but only barely noticeable now. I just had to write this because I have had some relief from my physical therapy exercises, but I have NEVER had such a significant improvement from just 23 minutes of practice. I really felt my heart chakra open up, and I have learned through my healing journey that the key to healing my back pain is keeping my heart chakra open. I think that is part of what was so beneficial about this practice, was that it targeted both physical and spiritual roots of upper back pain. Wow, I am so excited to use this practice whenever my back is giving me a hard time. Thank you so much for this GIFT. I actually have been thinking since this practice that MAYBE with daily yoga, I might someday be pain-free... That might be a bit much to hope for, but I know with certainty now that yoga can make a MAJOR difference in helping me manage chronic pain. THANK YOU.",David Berger,2020-08-03T19:56:19Z,92

"I found Adriene through Harry Smith on the today show. I started during COVID with the home series and now True. Six years ago I injured my right shoulder, 6 months later I was diagnosed with frozen shoulder and then leukemia the same day. Through a relapse and frozen shoulder on the left 3 times, physical therapy helped get most of the pain to go away and a good part of my range of motion, but my scapula was ‚Äúglued‚Äù to my back still. My chiropractor said it needed to be torn off my back. After doing my new am yoga, I found this video in the evening. It worked! Threading the needle got my scapula to release from my back!

"Hi! First, let me say that I love your videos! You simplify the poses, making them easy to follow. I also like how you give different variations on the poses to fit the different needs of your viewers.<br />I have struggled with back pain for years; it has gotten to the point where I hurt constantly. I was visiting the chiropractor, and that was helping some. But I had to stop going for insurance reasons. So I have been kind of learning to live with my back pain (I have slight scoliosis, an &quot;army neck&quot; as my chiropractor called it, and have had countless falls from years of sports). <br />Yoga was always an activity that I wanted to try, but I didn&#39;t feel like I had time with my work and  wifely responsibilities. Not gonna lie, I also thought it was a little bit of a gimmick XD I thought, &quot;There&#39;s no way that works!&quot; <br />I&#39;m so happy to say that I was wrong &lt;3 the few videos of yours that I have watched have given me so much relief in my back and neck. It feels incredible! <br />My mom also struggles with back issues (dehydrated disks, slipped disks) and has had to get nerve blocks to ease her pain. Sometimes those still don&#39;t work. I can&#39;t wait to share your videos with her! I hope that it gives her relief like it has given me. <br />So thank you for making these videos! You are making a difference! :)",Katey McIntyre,2020-03-26T15:27:08Z,0

"Thank you, thank you, thank you Adriene!!!  I&#39;ve had upper back pain for 8 years because I always carried too many things in my giant backpack throughout middle school and high school.  I&#39;m 20 now and still I&#39;ve never found a solution for my back pain.  Since I was a kid, I haven&#39;t been able to sit up straight for longer than a few minutes and I&#39;ve slouched all my life - but finally, after following along to this video just a few times, I&#39;m starting to find relief!  I feel so much better, and I&#39;ve been telling all of my friends to start doing Yoga with Adriene!  Not only are these videos awesome, especially for beginners, but you are so kind and genuine; I love watching because of YOU!

"I can&#39;t thank you enough. I had my second daughter 4 months ago. And this is now the second time I&#39;ve been waking up with debilitating pain in my hands. They go numb, and are on fire, and my fingers are swollen and I&#39;m stuck like that for 30-45 mins until the feeling comes back. This usually happens around 3-4Am every morning and I&#39;ve been having to sleep upright. <br /><br />I used to dance ballet but it&#39;s been about a decade and since everything my posture has gotten worse. Anyways, since doing this video specifically (started yesterday) I&#39;ve been feeling amazing. The knot that was in my right shoulder disappeared and this morning I woke up virtually pain free. I still had some slight numbness but NOTHING like it&#39;s been. Even my chiropractor stretches weren&#39;t helping. Thank you, thank you, thank you! I know you get this a million times but I&#39;m so appreciative of your hard work and kindness to us in continually supplying us with videos! I used to love hot yoga and can&#39;t afford it, this is just as good! I&#39;m in Vegas so the heat is supplied anyways ;-) <br /><br />But yeah, I&#39;m so thankful for you!

"Wow, I have been dipping my toe in the water to try out yoga for about six months on and off.  I have chronic back pain from basically a lifetime of somewhat panicking about things, and then extra stress the past two years and weak back and shoulders, and I also suffer from chronic migraines.  Since I have been doing regular exercise and yoga with you regularly I noticed my migraines decreased and it helps with back pain.  But today when I did this video at the very end when you do the eagle arms moving up and down, I started to cry which was completely unexpected (not sob but just a couple emotional tears).  I am not sure what that is but I think I am starting to heal in some ways.  I am trying to learn to cope with the stress of the situation (and just learning to cope with life in general) as there isn&#39;t anything I can do to change it at this time.  I think maybe the emotional moment was something in regards to a sense of beginning to heal but I&#39;m not sure.  If you have any insight it would be appreciated.

Hi Adriene! You have created such an important space for me in my life to engage in my practice. You are so kind and have such a wonderful spirit! Im so thankful for your channel. <br /><br />I was recently diagnosed with costocondritis which is an inflammation of the breast bone. I work as a child therapist for kids who‚Äôve experienced significant trauma and I noticed that this inflammation started about 3 months ago when I was working with a particular client with conversion disorder. I‚Äôm wondering if there was some sort of transfer of energy with her that I‚Äôm holding in my chest. I‚Äôve found that heart openers are helpful in relieving the chest pain but I wonder if you have any other suggestions? Specific poses or any other thought? <br /><br />Thank you again for your time and positive energy through your work. Namaste üôèüèº,Allison Nachtrieb,2019-06-25T14:12:57Z,0

"i&#39;ve always liked the one where you thread the arm through the gap whilst on your knees, but the added tip of stretching my arm out in front made me audibly moan which i&#39;ve never actually done, i don&#39;t think, haha! i experience extreme tension in my shoulders, for some reason i never relax enough, sit up straight enough, etc. to avoid it.  it&#39;s something that&#39;s difficult to ask people to massage too, because it&#39;s hard to get it exactly in the spot that hurts.  if i don&#39;t take care of it that pain just radiates to my neck and through my arms. the release from that stretch, along with the intertwining of my arms at the end, got the spot a way i&#39;ve not experienced before. i&#39;ll be saving this video so that next time i can quickly find it and relieve my poor shoulders.",Katy,2019-06-06T03:54:52Z,0

In general, avoid twists below the neck, core activation or anything on the belly. Hip openers are good but I advise to go easier in third trimester. Modify core moves with reclined cobblers pose, modify belly stuff with expended child‚Äôs pose or yogi‚Äôs squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. And always consult your doctor/physician before starting any exercise program.",Yoga With Adriene,2019-06-05T14:58:03Z,0

"I have a question for you, Adriene, about my yoga mat: I&#39;m sorry if you&#39;ve already talked about this elsewhere but I&#39;d really like to know the best kind of mat for my practice. I know you don&#39;t need anything fancy but I&#39;d really love to celebrate doing 100 days of yoga (say whaaat?! I still can&#39;t believe this!) by treating myself and I&#39;ve seen rubber mats which claim to be better than foam for anti-slip qualities and more supportive in terms of padding. Is this true? There are also mats with markings to help quick alignment, are these helpful or would I just become lazy with my inner mirror? <br /><br /><br />Perhaps you could make a video talking about your experience with mats and equipment, I really love your talking videos and ones where you choose to share knowledge of other things e.g. your tea recipe is awesome! Thank you so much for sharing these beautiful practices and your beautiful soul, you&#39;re truly an inspirational person.

"Since you asked... My experience was great!  I&#39;ve had a long Memorial Day, and I used my body the whole time.  Gardening, cleaning, more gardening, skateboarding, and yoga -- in that order.  This had me reflecting on how amazing yoga is, in that even when I am exhausted, it is pretty easy to find a video or orient my own practice to suit the state of my body.   This felt great.  You read my mind when you said &#39;[there&#39;s more going on] than meets the eye&#39; with that deceptively simple-looking pose.  Less showy poses like this, that any human being can do, are really the heart of yoga (imho), as much as I enjoy pushing my body and expanding my practice.",Marck Miller,2019-05-28T04:04:09Z,1

I only do home workouts so naturally it may take a while to achieve all the muscle definition as the person going to the gym and lifting heavy. My goal in changing to a healthy lifestyle was to be strong, healthy, active and happy. I have achieved strength and endurance mostly through YOGA. I incorporate all I learn from you in my daily life: during my strength workouts - how to breath, endurance,  at work...how do I sit, walk...as a mother...chores around the house..am healthy and so happy to be alive and what&#39;s more important is that I have learnt to appreciate myself and those around me.

Love you videos. Do them almost every morning. Thank you for this! I tried my best to follow but have been struggling a bit lately as I hurt my wrist and am having a hard time doing most yoga videos. I was wondering if maybe you could make a playlist of your videos that do not involve a lot of wrist pressure as I cannot currently bend my wrist and lean on it so tabletop is already hard. Am finding it hard to figure out which videos I can do. Would love some more standing wrist free practices ü•∞,Laura,2019-05-26T07:19:38Z,0
