"Dear Adrienne<br />I am so grateful to have found your Yoga channel 3 years ago. Since then I tried to do yoga as much as possible, sometimes everyday, sometimes only once in a month but still, yoga has changed me and my manner of acting so much! For now I have a subscribtion to alo.moves because I wanted to try something new but coming back for this short video for a study break at quarantine was so amazing! I really love your way of teaching, your bubbly and inspiring spirit and the way you always make me feel comfortable, no matter where I am in my practice. Thank you for having me introduced in this wonderful world of yoga and that I feel like I have always a friend to join at Youtube. Greetings from Switzerland!

"I have depression and anxiety, and was recommended your videos by multiple people. As someone who is incredibly stiff and out of shape, and who doesn&#39;t have much prior experience with yoga, I found this video super accessible. I like that I can quietly do it at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-8FvC3GD8c&amp;t=3m30s"">3:30</a> in the morning when I&#39;m the only one awake, and when I don&#39;t have the energy or ability to change clothes or clear furniture out of the way for floor exercises. I also like that I didn&#39;t need to use an elastic support band or a chair for balance to pull off these poses, and that you offer a few alternate ways to do the harder ones so I can work my way up to them. This video is meeting me where I am with what I can do right now, so thank you for making it.",Shannon Hoover,2020-09-27T08:38:14Z,3

I have been practicing with you, Adriene, for maybe 5 years now and have done many &quot;Knocking on Heaven&#39;s Door&quot;s with you, I&#39;ve even done this particular practice before, but today when you said &quot;you can call it whatever you want&quot;... I had a moment. <br /><br />The motion or position of my arms suddenly reminded me of a toy I had as a kid back in the 90s, it was called &quot;Sky Dancer&quot;, it was a little fairy that you set on a base, you pulled a string and it shot up and flew/spun around in the air for a few moments before crashing somewhere randomly in the room. I hadn&#39;t thought about that in years and it gave me such a childlike feeling of wonderment, because for a few seconds, doing that motion, I WAS THE SKY DANCER! <br /><br />I finally have my own personal name for this move.

Adriene: Your videos are saving during this WFH quarantine! I start the day with some of your a.m. stretches and then try to find time in the middle of the day for something like this. Your voice is so calming and lovely and I appreciate you always giving variations for those of us that aren&#39;t FT yoginis!  You are a bright star in the darkness right now.

I really dislike yoga that you have to do on the ground. It‚Äôs just not comfortable to me. But I just had this thought - is there standing yoga? So I searched it and did this video as I waited for my oven to preheat and I really enjoyed it! Will definitely be recommending this to my mom.,Liz Rochester,2020-03-21T20:25:46Z,1

"I was feeling so grumpy today and felt overwhelmed this weekend. I have been settling into the a new schedule with getting a job! (yay!), I didn&#39;t have a lot of time throughout the week to mourn and grief my mother passing away as immediately as I needed to when I wasn&#39;t working. I feel like I kind of bottled it up and it released over the weekend. I also have had some hormonal issues too the last month or so. I skipped yoga the last two nights because I was too tired and had stayed up too late, and I didn&#39;t want to tonight. My husband encouraged me to do some yoga today and I ended up clicking on this video. I had no idea how much it would impact me. I feel like all the anger and stress has left my mind and mostly left my body (I feel a little exhausted and stiff from working). I had so much fun with the cactus arms (I love cacti!) and the eagle arms and legs!

"I&#39;m in a phase of my life right now where I&#39;m working three jobs, and am chronically sleep-deprived. This means I often can&#39;t manage to get a full workout in. So glad you have plenty of shorter videos that I can slip in here and there, including plenty of no-sweat ones which I can do in my coffee break, or in the middle of my day when I don&#39;t want to have to take another shower or get changed. At bare minimum, if I can fit in ten minutes in the morning, and ten minutes before bedtime, and whatever walking or lifting I can do during my day, that&#39;s enough to maintain my fitness, improve my level of peace, and keep me strong, relaxed, and ready to go. This morning I didn&#39;t have time to stretch at all before work, but just did this quick one at my desk. I feel amazing! So glad I found your videos. You explain things clearly, so I can feel free to keep my eyes closed through many parts of the workout and still not miss a thing. You&#39;re personable, which makes it feel like I&#39;m doing yoga with a friend, or even have my own private trainer! You seem to understand the difficulties people may be having, and you let them know it&#39;s perfectly fine to start from where they stand. You provide variations for those who are more skilled, or less skilled. You don&#39;t just instruct, you make it fun. For all of this, I thank you.",Jennifer Woods,2019-06-06T17:18:58Z,0

I work in a small lawfirm and my office-mates and I really like doing this video. Kicking off our heels and tending to our bodies for a few minutes in the workday really makes such a difference. I was struck the other day by the fact that we almost all wear high heels every day and how awesome it would be to have a short targeted practice for the end of the day when the pretty shoes come off for good. Something to ease our hamstrings and calf muscles and glutes back into shape. So here&#39;s me requesting Yoga for Paralegals Who Love Pretty Shoes. üòõ,kalquessa,2019-05-09T04:00:05Z,1

"RESET day 31<br /><br />As this session concludes RESET, I started to reflect on what this month of yoga taught me. Some of the highlights of my journey include: Set a time for yourself and reflect on yourself to simply accept your fears and weaknesses, and let go of what burdens you and move forward. <br />The thing that I really liked is this: ‚ÄúMay we all see the truth. May we all speak the truth. May we always feel the truth‚Äù.<br /><br />‚Äî Adriene Mishler<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ywaRESET"">#ywaRESET</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FWFG"">#FWFG</a>",DAWSAC,2019-03-31T20:48:14Z,2

Thank you for another beautiful yoga session :),Happy Minds - Meditations & Sleep Stories,2019-03-31T05:18:56Z,35
Just what i needed given that i&#39;ve had a week of falling asleep on the work desk burning the midnight oil. I&#39;m thinking to do this in the middle of a work day when i need an office break from work and not use it as a morning practice. Thank you Adriene for coming to our rescue once again. Time to show ourselves some love everybody. Projects can wait a few minutes for this is some private time we get to spend with ourselves. Self love for the win. Much love.
