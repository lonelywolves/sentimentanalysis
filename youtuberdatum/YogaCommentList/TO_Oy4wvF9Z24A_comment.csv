"Thank you Adriene. I needed this, this evening. The entire day felt like a 50 lb weight on my shoulders. Possibly triggered by learning of the passing of a friend today. I’ve been struggling with the raw mood and dark energy in the country lately as well. This session absolutely help me settle down. Hopefully it’ll be a good night of rest and sleep. 🙏🏽 namaste.",Marc Titus,2020-10-28T00:17:08Z,0

"Good evening<br />I want to share my experience after doing this practice of reunite with breath. <br />Past two weeks I was in ICU taking care of covid patients. Returning from there I was unable to get into my daily normal life schedule. <br />As you(dear Adriene) always says that breath comes first. I search for it and get a very beautiful starting. I am calm now, feeling new normal and more grateful. <br />Love you❤<br />Khyati from India🇮🇳",khyati sengar,2021-05-05T13:29:55Z,0

"So I&#39;m currently on my yoga journey MOVE day 27 and yoga everyday this year, day 85. I currently have an arm/shoulder injury that is not allowing me to get in the mat like have been. So instead of pushing through this thing, im deciding to let it heal. However, that doesn&#39;t mean stop practicing yoga. I decided to do some breath work and the movements in this practice that I could. This will not stop me from uniting my mind, body, and spirit. I have to briefly (hopefully) take a different path, finding the fork in the road, not getting derailled.  Namaste beautiful people, thank you Adriene. 🙏",TMNTsamurai 84,2021-03-28T04:03:12Z,1

"Hadn&#39;t done this practice since the summer and oh my days I really haven&#39;t been breathing to my fullest recently. Intercostal muscles maybe aren&#39;t geting as much love and actication as I could be giving them I suppose. The arms up and down bit was quite difficult for me as I have issues with the tendons in my shoulder and neck. In the summer when I did this I was all about extending to my maximum length and this time around following your guidance to take the arms only as far as the breath goes gave me a whole different experience. Thanks so much.

I found that once i marry my breath to the movement. Each inhale and each exhale are different every time and that’s totally natural. I used to think that to have a good breathing it only needs to be long inhale and exhale but through this practice i realize to just be aware with the breath however long or short they are each time.

"I have been following this pranayama with you for the past 5 days. Every morning, then again after working out, and once more before going to bed. To be perfectly honest it is the ONLY thing that has been able to keep me away from weed AND cigarettes. But aside from that fact, I feel amazing. My mind has never been so at peace, I cant remember what anxiety feels like. I have more power of will than ever, I have stayed away from ALL sugars for 5 days, my concentration is better, my workouts are more intense, I don&#39;t find myself fighting with my breath when playing basketball. My back aches have damn near disappeared!! I have even revitalized my interest in my professional practice. In just 5 days!!! I wish there was some way I could pay you back. I have yet to try try anything other than this pranayama, but it has already been a life altering decision. Thank You! &lt;3",Max Carneado,2020-10-15T03:31:26Z,2

"My amazing friend Yasmin sent me this link to connect with myself. I learned how to breath only 4 days ago with exercising my soft palate. If you have trouble breathing too where you just keep the breath in your chest. Please try to open your mouth and breath in and out both for 4 seconds lifting up your soft palate. Do this a few minutes grab a mirror to see and the with a closed mouth to know how to lift your soft palate. <br /><br />Believe me it changed me!! as I never really enjoyed yoga as I was to busy to figure out to breath.

It calms me when I’m stressed, helps me sleep when I can’t and it guides me when I’m doubtful to make the right decision.

"Thank you for this breathing guidance. It really has been making a tremendous difference in my life, ever since I started to really connect with my breath, from a place of love, and not superficiality (read: breathing &#39;deeply&#39; just to breathe deeply, etc) and external effect. It really makes such a difference to everything I do, my relationship to every aspect of my life. It&#39;s hard to describe with words.<br />The hands up/down part at the end, I found i very difficult. I was breathing either with the top of my chest, or at the centre, but with tightness, not freely. Had to stop a couple of times to reconnect to what felt right.

"Not gonna lie, the arms didn&#39;t come all the way down in the exhalation so it turned out to be more of a workout than I expected.<br /><br />Btw it turns out I don&#39;t get notifications for these types of weekly videos, I only get them for the Home practices despite the fact that I have the notifications set to all. YouTube it&#39;s doing it&#39;s usual wonky but at least it&#39;s reminding me of the daily practices, it&#39;s as if it knew that I was following it. 🤷‍♂️",Tofol Cano,2020-01-26T21:01:53Z,0

That really spoke to me.  So, here I am day 25, sitting in front of my IPad after finishing Day 25. I am feeling stronger and more in tune with my body and mind.<br />Thank you so very much!",Sheila Pierce,2020-01-26T20:49:08Z,65
"I see a lot of comments that show how common it is to have a longer exhale thank the inhale on going up. I noticed the same in the final vinyasa. After a few minutes pause reading comments, I went back to that last breathing extending the arms just to where the breath stops. I think I had relaxed out of the effort of trying to open my lateral breath from the previous breathing and was allowing more breath through my diaphragm and belly. When I focused on lateral breathing, my Bello;y stayed tighter to emphasize that. I wonder if this is not what is intended? Should we include the fullest breath with belly, of focus on lateral breath for that final vinyasa?",Minna Sellers,2020-01-26T20:17:21Z,0

Though sometimes when I take very full breaths, I have a peculiar sensation on either side of my chest, at the top. It’s kind of unpleasant. I never know what it is. Maybe it’s just me becoming aware of the insides of the tops of my lungs ?! Consciously aware ?! No idea ! I don’t love it though. Anyway, as I said, great practice.

This practice was perfect to calm those thoughts, especially the last bit of synchronisation! Eternally grateful, Adriene &lt;3 Thank you.",Daphne,2019-11-03T19:03:38Z,0
"That was amazing, didn’t think I’d walk away feeling this peaceful, considering the way I walked in. The last bit, synchronization of breath and arm movement was what really left me with a sense of ease and light. ✨💕",Thalia Fernandez,2019-11-03T18:28:59Z,2
"That last breathing section was surprisingly wonderful. I&#39;m extra vocal while exhaling, I startled myself. Lol! But it felt so good. Thank you for all you do Adrienne. Namaste 🙏🏻",Nadia Nanette,2019-11-03T17:43:16Z,2

"As always, love the practice. We breathe all the time so are expert at it, no? No - this practice made me realise how shallow my breaths usually are. Slowing them down, slows me down and I need that. Main practical problem for me is sitting cross-legged and upright for any length of time places pressure on my lower spine. I do use a blanket sometimes but any other tips for opening up the hips so I can get my legs lower much appreciated.",Devon Book Club,2019-11-03T09:54:33Z,0

Mm. Loved it! Didn’t do the last couple rounds of arms up and down with breath. My shoulders were on 🔥 I loved how she talked about being so honest with ourselves in home yoga practice. And even with the shoulder burn. The movement of arms with breath in real honesty was a nice physical representation of how my breath cycle was! Very cool.

"Adriene,<br /><br /><br />I&#39;ve been in a bit of a rut lately. I was going strong this summer taking time for myself through Yoga With Adriene almost every day, sometimes twice a day! Ever since the fall semester started I&#39;ve been so tired, so stressed, and so anxious for weeks and weeks. I showed up today for the first time in a while, and I didn&#39;t realize how much I needed this. It feels so wonderful to reunite with my breath. I&#39;m hoping I can keep going and keep getting back on the mat, but it&#39;s going to be hard. Despite that, I thank you for being there for me whenever I do find myself on my mat again.<br /><br /><br />Namaste♥",Lynora Tolman,2019-11-02T23:39:13Z,5

The last part was really challenging and I may go back to this video in a few days instead of trying different ones like I usually do of yours. I want to get better at making those breaths longer.

Getting back into your videos. Was using some of your routines this summer when I would finish work in the morning with my visit to the beach. The beach doesn’t have WiFi sorry. I enjoyed this one greatly. I like breathing workouts. <br /><br />I like how you worked in a hidden shoulder routine. Going slow like that the burn started to hit towards the end. To be honest I quick paused when I started to feel that so I could keep going with the burn. <br /><br />Also the deep breath while laying got some good pops I think a rib that was out of place found its home again 😂. <br /><br />Finally I get why you choose to end with the prayer 🙏 pose at the end. Much like crossing arm it feels like defending position. Which for myself allows for a little more “protection” while reflecting. Side note many martial artist may seen this in past as defensive entry move cause it gives some blocks the head throat chest upper abs. I had instructor say quick pray before you dive into the fray.,A. O.,2019-09-19T10:54:43Z,0

"Adding the part of only raising/lowering your arms as far as your breath goes made me realise a) how hard it is to really synchronise breath and movement, b) how all this time I&#39;ve been trying to sync up with your movement instead of mine, resulting in holding my breath and thinking that was deep breathing, and c) just how mechanical I&#39;ve been taking my practice. For the past year or so its felt more like something I have to do rather than something I chose to do. So it&#39;s always been about getting one pose done then the next and the next and roll up the mat. <br />But as I enter this very trying period of trying to become the person I want to be, I want to be more conscious of how I move, and the choices I make in my life",honey Blue,2019-08-30T15:21:21Z,0

I watched your most recent “Classroom Meditation” and practiced that while sitting on the couch with my dog. I came to this when I realized Just how <b>Hard</b> it was for me to catch my breath and take at least one full breath. Even while initially laying down during this my body was so tense! From the muscles in my face all the way down. <br /><br />I’ll have to start my day with this breathing and remind myself to breathe when I’m feeling tense. Thank you Adriene!,Alyssa Cardenas,2019-08-26T22:46:48Z,1
"I LOVEEEEE your videos!!!!!!! Yoga in a classroom can be so intimidating and scary, because you feel a level of pressure to be as good as everyone else. <br />Watching and participating in your videos from home is so much fun and allows me to do yoga. <br />I also like the commentary during the videos; telling us to listen to our body and how its ok if you can&#39;t fully do the pose or that its ok if you can&#39;t do the more advance stuff!! Thank you so much for bringing such amazing yoga videos to youtube. You ROCK! :)",Nisha ismail,2019-08-26T18:49:32Z,0

"Love it! Since experiencing a &quot;breathing circle&quot; - a yoga class that was ALL pranayama, I&#39;ve been imagining that every pose is only about the breath. Well not only, but really trying to let the breath be the focus of every pose and movement. Love this experimental challenge of stopping the movement when the breath ends.",Laura Mahalel,2019-08-23T11:00:33Z,0

As always it&#39;s exactly what I needed today.  I&#39;ve started doing yoga in the morning right after I get up and this has been a hard transition from my afternoon practice.

"I have been practicing yoga for a few years now but never fully became actually aware and engaged with mind and body until very recently (not just on my mat). However I was doing this video today and just moved back in with my mom and brother so I practice now in a common area. My brother sat in front of my mat with his dog, I politely as I could asked him to leave me space so I could move more. I struggle with ADHD but notice yoga makes it very easy to cope with even with my innatentiveness and impulses. Anyway..he got up went on the couch and I noticed he kept talking very loudly at me and I wasn&#39;t fighting my focus I was able to naturally remain engaged with the video and my breathing while still being aware of the constant chatter from my brother. I was still feeling frustrated because I already set one boundary with him and struggled to set another boundary with him that I needed him to be quiet because what ended up happening was I was getting very distracted and no longer could hear Adriene anymore even though my brother was still talking in the same loud tone of voice. I eventually gave up and turned the TV off and walked away. Usually the old me would have had a complete meltdown and screaming match with my brother but I just simply left the room quietly but I am still actually feeling pretty irritated because my boundaries weren&#39;t respected and this seems like they usually aren&#39;t or maybe I&#39;m just not heard? I now know that mindfulness isn&#39;t about avoiding but letting go of any distraction because wherever we go life is full of distractions that we simply cannot escape so what I would like to know is how do I really get through this huddle of poor boundaries, especially when I&#39;m seeking to get even more benefits from my yoga practice???",Little_ bit,2019-08-07T18:19:25Z,0

Day 63. I&#39;m reuniting with my yoga practice after a few days of missing it as well so I guess this is a good one to start with. 😂  The little breathing vinyasa was wwow. I was super mindful of how much I was inhaling and exhaling. My hands just kept going up halfway. How is inhaling the first thing I ever did but I&#39;m still trying to get a hang of it?😂 <br />But i can feel the quality of my breath change after the practise and it feels amazing. ❤<br />Thank you Adriene for this video and for all the love and light you share with the world. ❤,Dona,2019-08-07T16:41:13Z,0

I don&#39;t know what I would be doing / how I would be staying healthy (and becoming healthier) without them.  What was interesting to me about this video, in particular, is how much easier it seems to be, to breathe out, than to breathe in. Like, I&#39;ll breathe out A LOT and be able to move my arms quite a ways down. But then, so far (I&#39;ve done it maybe three days so far), it&#39;s more challenging to take a breath that brings my arms all the way up, overhead.  Definitely is great for more self-awareness and body awareness. So thankful for you, Adriene! THANK YOU!!!!!!! SO much for what you are doing!",Spike TV,2019-08-06T17:09:34Z,0

"Thank you for this practice Adriene! <br />I have been struggling to stay true to my commitment to make healthier choices for myself. This practice helped me remember that my thoughts only have the power that I give them. Thoughts are but a river and I can choose to let them come and go without damming the river. <br /><br />The end of the practice was particularly helpful in reminding me to be honest with myself with where I am at. I caught myself doing the full arm motion even though my lung capacity could not match it. I tend to do the same sort of self deluding when I start slipping into my addictions, telling myself that I am fine when I am not. <br />Thanks again, I needed this return to my breath and practice in general ❤",Mark Dean,2019-08-05T19:09:09Z,0

"Really enjoyed this practice. I&#39;ve been dealing with some pretty persistent lower back/psoas pain, perhaps from overdoing it a week or two ago, and it&#39;s really been making it hard to form standing, sitting, or laying forward bend positions. Breathing through this was a simple way to understand how much this is limiting my breath. It was hard to breath to my normal capacity and I was still aware of the soreness in my lower back, but I got through it. I&#39;ll be using your gentle practices in the meantime, I think part of this recovery is staying compassionate for my body but keeping it active.",Varius Kidd,2019-08-05T14:37:00Z,0

"First impression - any practice with a blanket over the yoga mat is always a good one! I really loved this one though. I find when I do more frequent yoga practices and I ever feel stressed or upset or it&#39;s been a long day I remember more to take long breaths in and out. It&#39;s like when we are working or busy we sometimes don&#39;t realize what short little breaths we are taking, and then those loooong ones feel so good.

"Day 4 done...I almost didn&#39;t even come to the video because I am so exhausted from my day but I&#39;m glad I did. 1 a fly flew on my knee as soon as I started and I kept swatting at it at first bc I could feel the tingle of it moving and it was annoying. It wouldn&#39;t go away after the first 5 or so swats I gave up and just decided that, this fly is apart of me. Not only did I stop noticing the feeling, after a minute or so it flew away. Another thing my cat was looking at me like &quot;silly humans&quot; when I did the rocking move. Something weird I noticed, during the last move I couldn&#39;t breath as deep as I could at any other time during the video. It was weird. Something to explore for sure.",Carmen Mims,2019-08-04T23:28:50Z,0

"REUNITE day 4<br /><br />It felt great! <br />The first thing I learned when I started doing yoga is the significance of breathing. Especially how you breath while moving, the inhales and the exhales. Normally when I exercise I make sure to exhale and stuff, but most of the time I end up distracted concentrating on the movement itself. <br />Yoga definitely teaches you to be more mindful about your breath.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ywaREUNITE"">#ywaREUNITE</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FWFG"">#FWFG</a>",DAWSAC,2019-08-04T21:35:40Z,1

I was just present with my breath... no unwanted thoughts. <br />I didn’t even knew my brain was able to be calm again. <br />It didn’t even mattered to me that two minute after this practice all the anxiety was back, because I know that moments of peace will happen again, it is possible, in my reach, and it’s okay not to be able to achieve it, as long as I keep in mind that some days, I can. <br />Thank you for being such an incredible teacher, you do change our lives for real.

"Wow thank you for this! This was wonderful! I found out my exhalations are longer than my inhalations and that I could reach fingers to the top if I went a tad faster than I wanted. But instead of forcing, I went as the pace I wanted and just stopped before I reached the top.  It felt to know I have that control, that power in my life, esp since I&#39;m going through some of the roughest months of my entire life. Knowing I do still have control over me and what I want in life is huge right now.  I hope to take this off the mat, I hope to be true to myself, no matter who or what I lose.

Thank you so much for this practice. The end was helpful. I got better at my breath and movement of up and down after getting into it. when i added the neck i could see how my breath and raising and lowering my arms changed.

"What  a wonderful way to start a Sunday. I did a lot physical work yesterday and my body needed a practice to reconnect and just chill. Breath work is also something that is difficult for me b/c I am always in my head and just going. It&#39;s nice to have a practice that makes to STOP and BREATHE.

"This video helped me to return to practicing yoga more consistently. That last part was amazing. My inhalations were brief, despite my attempts to lengthen them. My arms then only went up so high. But my exhalations were long. My sinuses cleared up so much I felt me nose sting a bit! Can&#39;t wait for the next practice! I wanted to add how much I loved the line about appreciate your breath. (It was something like that and it was said at the end of the video.)  I take it for granted when practicing yoga. Thanks for my yoga so amazing Adriene!",Diana ColAla,2019-08-04T16:23:45Z,0

"So, one thing I would love some advice on. I&#39;m actually pretty good at connecting breath to movement and going at that pace when i&#39;m doing something like this that&#39;s slow. There&#39;s time to breathe deeply. But when I&#39;m in a class or doing a more heated practice, the instructor never, ever breathes as slowly as I need to in order to get that full breath. And if I go at my slow pace, I quickly get lost because I&#39;m 2-3 moves behind and don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming next. I&#39;m not sure if I need help breathing deeply faster, or keeping my rhythm, or what, but I&#39;d love to hear what you think. I often lose track of the breath in heated classes because I just physically can&#39;t yoga-breath as fast as I&#39;m moving, and the faster I move the shorter my breath gets.",Mockingdragon,2019-08-04T16:19:12Z,0

"in the vinyasa part it was weird because my inhales were rather short so I only got my arms to like a 180° angle but my exhales were much longer and I arrived at the floor before I was out of breath, I think that&#39;s probably because I&#39;m a singer and I&#39;m used to quick inhales and very slow exhales :D",anildo,2019-08-04T10:39:27Z,0

"When I first discovered breath practice and it&#39;s benefits I was so eager to tell my friends about it. Obviously most of them were like &#39;no, I don&#39;t need to breathe deep why are you trying to tell me what to do.&#39; I realise now that encouragement can often feel like dictating to some people but its like, animals need oxygen to function, we get oxygen into our bodies through breathing, what have you got to loose by just taking a couple of slow, deep breaths?",Calum Orbell,2020-12-17T09:21:52Z,2

"Hi Adriene! I need help! I love your energy and they way you guide us through each posture. I can not find any other yoga videos I like more than yours. I am now in my second trimester and I don’t know really which videos I should watch. I only found one video for pregnant but it doesn’t feel like a real routine. I did the video and loved it, but there is not much movement and also the girl has a huge stomach, so I don’t feel is for me. Could you create a list of the videos you already have that maybe don’t have so much -laying on the back -twisting -crunches (examples of postures i read are not so great for pregnant women).<br />Can I find that in you app maybe? Thanks for reading! I really miss to do yoga with you. Lot of love, Melina",MELINA LOBO,2019-08-04T07:24:44Z,0
"Hi Melina! We do have a Prenatal Yoga For All Trimesters series in the FWFG Membership - <a href=""https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/"">https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/</a> and in our shop - <a href=""https://do.yogawithadriene.com/prenatal-yoga"">https://do.yogawithadriene.com/prenatal-yoga</a>. In general, most women are able to continue a regular practice through month eight if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. <br />As always, consult your doctor/physician before starting and follow their advice. x",Yoga With Adriene,2019-08-04T14:06:31Z,0
