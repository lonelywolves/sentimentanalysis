"We continue to dedicate time, attention and energy to finding conscious breath. <br />Informing the brain on what that looks like, the body, what that feels like.<br />Finding yourself. Find What Feels Good. <br />Gift yourself this time to search for sensation, for meaning.<br />Maybe it’s time to deepen your relationship with yourself?",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-24T14:38:55Z,594

"Good Morning  to all ,made it to the mat and left it in thought again being dedicated to myself for any 1 reason almost sounds selfish . But the centering on breathing helps to bring the world into a clearer view and it is a nice tool to help center yourself when things go a little weird .",David Cates,2021-04-23T14:14:59Z,2

Today was very special for me, today and for the past e days my son has been in hospital on ITU in the UK, fighting to overcome the effects of too many recreational drugs. It is heartbreaking to sit and just watch him go through such a dark journey alone. I’m not religious so cannot pray for him, but today I felt I was able to dedicate my practice and send him some additional love and energy to help his fight. Thank you Adriene.

"After practice: I noticed a sliight opening in my hips and theighs again which was nice. When you said we are focusing. I giggled. I have a million thoughts during yoga, but you always bring our focus back to the source of love. I find new angles and positions each time and can get feel it stretch deeper aspects of my muscles and that allows for nerve endings to be free again. I am so happy that you decided to make these videos for people with chronic pain, emotional and physical and alot of nerve damage and lung damage from the bad habits I have accumulated over the years and thought I got rid of. My perspective on my life has changed tremendously. Thank you Adriene &lt;3",Amber Rose LOVE,2021-03-30T21:28:59Z,0

If I could just talk to you, The message would be clearer, writing is just not my thing...) I dedicated this class to someone so dear te me... He awakend such strong feeling of caring and love... To be really honest: I couldn&#39;t even see it, although my feelings where so clear about it. So accepting the feelings, acknowledge it was just not possible back then. Today, I can... I can feel it, see it, acknowledge it, and finally: I can let it IN!!! Thank you so much....",Eline Roex,2021-03-01T11:18:45Z,0

"I really love this practice ❤️ I&#39;ve done the whole 30 days, but keep returning to this one, specially when I have a migraine. The first day I did this practice, I had a migraine and it was like Adriene read my mind, with all that head and shoulder stretches in the beginning, in the end of the practice I was migraine free (which is amazing!! I really struggle with migraine, there&#39;s not a single month that I don&#39;t have 2-3 days of migraine, that leaves me completely depressed and not even able to think properly) so to find something that works it&#39;s priceless!

"Another thought-I am doing these practices a little late, its February right now. And when Adriene mentioned sending love to those who need it, I actually immediately thought of Adriene, because she&#39;s the only person I know (of) who lives in Texas. And right now there are these awful winter storms and Texas is the state that&#39;s having a power shortage. So today I focused on sending my prayers to Adriene, and everyone in Texas who is struggling and struggling to keep themselves warm.",DeShong,2021-02-19T20:33:56Z,0
"Todays practice was really special and memorable for me. This is the 4th month I&#39;ve been doing yoga with Adrienne 30 day challenges, and I&#39;ve set the goal to do yoga with Adrienne for one year. And today was the strongest, most grounded, most centered I&#39;ve ever felt on the mat. I started to have doubts about myself the last few days feeling like maybe I should be more advanced in my practice by now but today I felt the lesson surface that I am making progress, because I am coming to the mat everyday. And I am seeing that progress today. I was able to really pay attention to my center in every single move. And I&#39;m finding that all the poses are becoming more healing than difficult. Poses like downward dog, or lunge, or even plank are becoming easier and more healing and rejuvenating than feeling like exercise. There&#39;s still very much more I will be improving on, and there are poses I still can&#39;t do or have trouble doing. But I know now that I am making major progress, and that feels HUGE!",DeShong,2021-02-19T20:29:40Z,0

"I started almost 3 weeks late, but &quot;better late than never&quot; is in this case totally true. I was looking for a way to practice yoga regularly and there you were, waiting for me. It slipped very easily into my routine - put my little toddler to bed and then empty my head on the mat. I could feel the effects very soon and by the end of the first week, I knew there will be Day 31 and so on for me. Thank you so much for this. Also this community is awesome, it gives one a boost to see there are so many gentle people around the world. P.S. That´s my first commentary ever... :)",Lucie Jestřábová,2021-02-11T18:33:51Z,1

"Thank you for guiding me and everyone else on this journey, Adrienne! The focus on breath has been so important to me both on the mat and in my day to day. For the past several years I’ve noticed a tightness in my chest, and I often feel an inability to take deep breaths. It seems very much related to stress and anxiety. Practicing more conscious and “lateral” breaths has made a difference for me, and I feel an amazing change in the deepness of my breath with your guidance. ❤️",Catherine Grossman,2021-02-08T22:26:48Z,0

"I missed yesterday because I ran out of time before church in the morning, and then when I was winding down for the day, I realized that I needed to have that time to go to bed early. But when I say I missed it, I really missed it. There were so many obstacles in the way of today&#39;s practice this morning! I had a difficult time getting out of bed, and when I finally got to the mat, I realized that my laptop had died. So I was running late (am running late), and it took at least twenty minutes for my laptop to start up and load everything. But once I was finally in it, after several moments of considering putting it off once again (and really really not wanting to!), I was just filled with gratitude. This was a strangely emotional practice for me. Thank you for helping me to dedicate myself to this and to me and to God and to life. You have changed my life.",Valaya Hart,2021-02-08T16:43:02Z,0

"Day 23:<br /><br />The down side of getting better at focus, at being in the moment, is that I have less to record at the end of a session about how I did with it.  The up side is that I know I was <i>in</i> it as I was doing it, not thinking about what was right or wrong or what I&#39;d say about it later, simply doing.<br /><br />I&#39;m ok with that being where I&#39;m at with yoga on day 23.

"January has been really difficult for me. One month ago I got the news my parents are getting a divorce. My best friend is very ill and was hospitalised the first week of the year. A dear friend of mine moved across the country. Depression and anxiety(GAD) are things I’ve battled for years. And in all this I’m just an 18 year old girl trying to figure out school, life and myself. I had a cold two weeks ago(didn’t practise) so I’m a few days behind but I’m honestly so proud of my myself for showing up on the mat everyday. Even on the days when leaving bed is a challenge.<br />Today, 30 seconds into practise, I cried. A lot. I tend to keep everything inside so that’s a pretty big deal for me. But it was a well needed release.

"It was much easier to show up earlier on the journey, perhaps because I had more energy. It is more important now to show up for myself as it feels more pertinent in the cultivation of this dedication to myself and those that I will cross paths with.<br /><br />I am freeing myself from the shame of missing some days and instead, I will embody this feeling of showing up for myself.",Landisiwe,2021-01-26T20:09:45Z,1

"During the practice today, there was so much external disturbance. A part of me kept getting a little annoyed and wanted to have a perfectly silent yoga environment. The minute I got into downward dog, a crow started cawing. Usually, that means it wants food so I kept thinking, just let me finish my yoga, I&#39;ll give it after. Then I thought for a second, I paused the video, gave the crow food and continued. The practice was so peaceful after that and the crow was happy.. It&#39;s like Adriene says, you fill your cup so you can serve yourself and others. It was a reminder that even though I live in this body, others also have things going on and they deserve kindness. <br /><br />Thank you Adriene and Benji for this journey!

Dedicate was perhaps the hardest practice to do because we had a bushfire edging closer to us but we had our bags packed ready to go if we needed to and I needed this practice to ease my panic. Thankfully for us the winds changed direction and we were safe but feeling anxious for those now in it’s path and the volunteer firefighters trying to get the fires under control.  After a sleepless night worrying I re- did Dedicate this morning and dedicate to all the brave people fighting the  fires and those helping move animals and offering their homes for shelter.

so grateful to have been on this journey and to find a new community. I am just hoping for any tips.. when I try to deepen my inhales I feel more pain in my chest and it just feels difficult. I just wonder if it gets easier over time and I just need to be patient with myself? is this normal? maybe I am working too hard to deepen my inhale? either way I am giving myself grace and Adriene really makes me feel at ease as I continue to grow in each practice. :) thank you for any help!!,Ashleigh Lea,2021-01-25T04:52:23Z,1

Accountability check: I finished Day 23! Wow..Sunday’s are really hard for me. I usually the dread the practice because of my Sunday Blues.

While it’s frustrating to me to not be able to participate at my usual level, your constant reminders to be here today, with this body, this shape, have helped me to move through some of the perfectionism I thought i had dealt with and accept the humanity of this body and that sometimes, it’s not a failing, not laziness, i am just sick.

"Total honesty: the last two or three days I really haven’t felt like doing yoga. I’d look at how long the video was and be glad it was a shorter one. I came to the mat feeling annoyed and thinking about all the things I needed to be getting on with. Today, after feeling fatigued, I almost felt like crying when I sat on the mat and I realised how important it is to put this daily break for myself in my day. Today I totally lost sense of time and was surprised when the practice came to an end, I was enjoying it so much and was just in the moment. It would’ve been so easy for me to say I was too busy to stick with this series but I’m SO glad I haven’t given up on it. I got an important reminder today of why it’s so beneficial that I carve out that time for myself every day.",h20ellipsis,2021-01-24T23:32:15Z,0

"Hi Adriene, thank you so much for this video. I recently got really sick and wasn&#39;t able to participate in five days of this yoga journey. At first, I was upset at myself  but coming back and restarting my yoga journey feels so great! Your words and calming yoga poses allow myself to appreciate the body I&#39;ve been given, which has gone through so much. I&#39;m so excited to continue in the next few days~ lots of love :)",Claire Jiang,2021-01-24T23:21:58Z,1
Bei dear Adrienne... any chance you could make a yoga session for people with hip impingement? It hurts when you rotate the leg in- and outwards and thinks like crossed leg siting or warriors just don’t work. I try to skip or adapt but at rough days it would be so nice to have a clip where I don’t have to work around...,lalelulyle,2021-01-24T23:14:02Z,0

Today&#39;s session very nearly didn&#39;t happen but I will not be defeated (daily yoga is feeling too good) so have just squeezed it in before midnight strikes and I turn into a pumpkin. And so glad I did - as always. Did a little cardio class today and couldn&#39;t believe how much stronger I was because of this daily practice. I know that&#39;s not the only reason we do yoga but it was a good measure of how far I&#39;ve come on this journey. Thank you Adriene x,Helen Daly,2021-01-24T23:04:38Z,0

Day 21 was a struggle for me. I showed up to the mat with more than I realized weighing on my heart.

"&quot;Finding your breath is finding yourself&quot; Thank you for that, Adriene. I&#39;m in a long period of healing from deep trauma, and often I feel I don&#39;t know who I am anymore, and it frightens me. I&#39;ve been working to soothe myself and remember that I&#39;m not a problem to be fixed. I can&#39;t ever be lost, I&#39;m right here. And even in the midst of endless worries, I can find my breath, and I&#39;m home. It reminds me also of a poem, <br /><br />&quot;Just sit there right now<br />Don&#39;t do a thing<br />Just rest.<br /><br />For your separation from God,<br />From love,<br /><br />Is the hardest work<br />In this<br />World.&quot;<br /><br />- Hafiz<br /><br />I dedicated my practice to anyone who may feel lost. Who is hurting or grieving or unravelling. I see you. We are healing side by side. The light will come. This too shall pass. Love to you all! Namaste 💓✨",Kat Abrams,2021-01-24T22:42:58Z,9

"A place I didn’t expect to gain new awareness (and soreness) in this series is my FEET!!! I think I overdid it a few days ago in a toe stand, and I’ve had to take it easy on them ever since. Having them sore right now helps me realize all the different poses we put our feet in and all the things they are so helpful in. My long lanky feet were always something I felt self conscious about growing up but this week I’ve been feeling particularly grateful to them!!",Courtney Tesh,2021-01-24T22:03:09Z,1

"Thank you so much Adriene for this whole yoga journey, and especially today. I have been feeling a bit low and sometimes sad the last few days and I was very close to not getting on the mat today but I decided that I will do this for myself and not quit now! So I did it right before getting ready for bed and it was perfect. It was just what I needed in this moment. The things you said about dedication and devotion - that really struck something inside me. Afterwards I am just filled with love! I don’t know why and where it came from but all of a sudden I’m just feeling love, for myself and for people I’ve had a hard time with lately and been feeling sad about. Thank you so much for this practice. I think it is extra needed and valuable in these times which are heavy on all of us.

"Thank you Adriene, for being the Yogi that you are, and for creating something so real, heartfelt and special, for us your humble followers.  You are a gift from God.  And to think I wouldn&#39;t have found you or this community if it weren&#39;t for a global pandemic.  Talk about the yin-yang of life. And wow, I thank all you who take the time to share your thoughts, fears, support, dreams and prayers via this comment forum everyday. Reading your words,  knowing you are there, and being part of this community adds immeasurably to the &quot;Yoga with Adriene &quot; experience. Yesterday I turned 68 years old. Today I finished Breath Session  #23. I have started to pay attention to my breathing at other times, not just when I am on the mat.  Until three weeks ago I had never in my life done three consecutive days of yoga classes.  What a wonderful progression. I sort of feel like I am meeting myself again for the first time.   While I grieve for the loss, pains and sufferings of which so many people are having to deal,  having this experience reminds me of mystery of life and the love, beauty and amazing healing power of the earth.

"First of all Adriene I loved your love letter today! So sweet and loving. Also, don&#39;t put  pressure on yourself. You can do it either way. Today I dedicated my practice to my mother. She is suffering from depression and today at the mat I felt like i was sending her all my energy. She needs it more than me so here it is. And as I am saying that, I feel the energy on my body 10 times more than I did before. Wow. I loved the practice today and one thing that I realized is that shavasana is also one of my favorite poses. I like to feel the earth especially on the summer barefoot. So laying on the round breathing with all of u helps me feel the earth, the ground and our roots so much more. Thank you everyone for showing up. ❤",Μαρία Καρπάθη,2021-01-24T21:37:46Z,0

I knew that I was dedicating this practice outside of myself, so I didn&#39;t feel it was in my best interest to reflect poorly on my practice. Pupdate: before practice she was having a super bad day, very anxious and afraid at every noise. Now she is laying down, resting her little head on the pillow I keep on the mat, drifting in and out of sleep.

I&#39;ve been doing yoga with Adrienne for about 2 years and I&#39;ve improved a lot but I still struggle with the transition from downward facing dog to lunge. My leg can only go half way. On my right side I even need to stand and place it. I try to make more space by making sure I move on an exhale but still it can&#39;t go. Is it about flexibility? Or maybe my breasts are in the way since they&#39;re big. Any tips to sort this out. Or must I accept my body can&#39;t do this and find my own way?

One of the main reasons I have loved the Breath series is that breath is the foundation for all the poses. The exhales are so helpful at sinking deeper into a pose. It takes time and practice. Be kind and gentle with yourself. I&#39;m amazed at how much this 30 day challenge has solidified what I can now comfortably call my practice.

That&#39;s what I wrote in response to Adriene&#39;s question today of &quot;what does it mean to dedicate yourself to a practice or project?&quot; I feel like it&#39;s largely a surrender and a letting go. It&#39;s a release of your independent management and allowing yourself to follow and flow. My intention for today has been, &quot;Live to explore, not to get it right.&quot; Maaaaan is it helping.

This session was just what I needed today. I was feeling a little agitated this morning and I wasn&#39;t sure why. So I first meditated for 10 minutes then decided to do this practice. The time flew by and each movement felt great and it was like I was able to release that agitation and I feel so much better now. I am dedicating myself to keep up this practice more regularly throughout the year instead of letting it fade away after the 30 days. I&#39;m actually starting to feel stronger and more flexible and I feel like this 30 day practice has produced more results than the previous 2 or 3 I&#39;ve done. Very thankful for this series of practices this year.,Shayla Herren,2021-01-24T18:19:14Z,3

"Today, I dedicate my practice to my Grandmother. I left my homeland of Poland to the United States at the age of 13. My grandmother was one of my Mother figures. I have missed her and my grandfather every day since. He passed away 3 years ago, but my grandmother is still alive at 83, and remains in Poland, all by herself. Every child of hers has moved to the US, and therefore so are her grandkids. My heart aches every time we talk, knowing that she is there, all by her lonesome. It just doesn&#39;t feel right. I haven&#39;t shared this with anyone in my family yet, y&#39;all are first... BUT I&#39;m 31 years old, still single, with no kids, and have been seriously considering moving back to Poland and spending the last years of her life with her. What a treasure would that be..

I look forward auto it all day and my husband is in awe of the fact that I come in after a day working and say &#39;I must do my yoga practise&#39;. I love it and I love Adrienne and Benji!  Thank you Adrienne for explaining the moves so well - I now understand why I haven&#39;t advanced over the years, but also, I&#39;m getting the mind/body connection so much more, which is making all the difference.  I feel so happy and positive and I am looking forward to a long journey of releasing and strengthening my mind and body looking forward!

"I have been doing yoga for over 40 years.  Yoga with Adriene has been transformative for me.  It is slow and thoughtful, progressive and unique, while being very satisfying.

Very much appreciate the practice and I get the  sponsorship need ...but maybe nuanced ...a little less big  corporate might work better for yoga and Adidas? I noticed before but honesty this threw me off a bit today. And that&#39;s a first for Yoga with Adriene,Michael Rouse,2021-01-24T17:37:33Z,0
"I loved today’s message and practice.  Yes, it is, as Adriene said, a practice.  And I loved the dedication not just to me and all of you, but to some friends who could really use it. <br /><br />But, the best part for me today, was when she said I could balance a hand on something to reach my foot while balancing! And it was ok to be a awkward a bit.  At 68, w extra padding on those legs combined w 🦖 arms I have never been able do do this, which frustrates me to no end.  Today hand on chair back, creeping down that other leg, grabbed that foot!!! Far from graceful .. however was able to straighten, breathe, balance and let go of the chair back. 🙏🏻 for permission to get into that pose my way!!! <br /><br />Yikes we are in the last week.  I will miss you all.  😥",Dee Dee Lynch Silverstein,2021-01-24T17:36:50Z,0

"This practice is working for me because I do so much better with a short daily practice as opposed to the conventional much longer practices 2 or 3 times a week. I am able to internalize the awareness of movement and  breath and retain it. What also works is the Hatha yoga discipline. My experience is that it is slower and deeper, with a wholeness of the combination of breath and asana. Sweating and panting is not my idea of a nourishing practice. Thanks Adrienne for all your hard work. You have invested so much into these lessons. It takes great effort and humility to prepare &#39;seamless&#39; instruction for us all here every day. <br />Salutations!!",Elizabeth Anne Jones,2021-01-24T15:59:16Z,0
Breath Day 23! 112 consecutive days. Got to the mat a bit late today as I was out well into the evening. Picked up a couple yoga blocks that I spied while browsing through some stores.

"This entire series has offered me so much and I&#39;m so humbled in all the things I have learned and surprised at the true connection I have found within this community.<br /><br />I am in awe of the closeness I feel with the people whose comments I read from all over the world.  Especially those who wake up before me.  Their comments make me laugh, touch my heart and give me the encouragement to keep going.  I think current circumstances bind us more together...it is quite a unique energy here.<br /><br />I feel - and that is my why.  In times of chaos and isolation, it is hard to not just retreat and hide.  This practice is like a kind hand reaching out in the dark to help get you to a better place.<br /><br />Thanking all of you and Adrienne for this special time each day to just take care of ourselves.  🙏💜",M B,2021-01-24T15:37:03Z,0

"Thank you for this approach, Adriene! It’s beautiful to realize that everything we do, no matter how small, reflects in everything and everyone around us! 💛 So to go about life with intent and awareness makes it a constant prayer for our own existence and for that of those we care about or relate to everyday! Qué mensaje tan poderoso y lleno de luz! Hoy va dedicado a tantísima gente linda que amo! Dedicating light and love to you all as well, my lovely amigxs del mundo ⭐️",Aileen O,2021-01-24T15:35:55Z,2
"The coffee grinder move made me cry cry cry! The minute I moved my chest forward my heart burst through a wall, and when I moved back it just sort if poured out. I dedicated the practice to myself. I never take time out to allow myself to really feel my Self, to be alone with my Self, and to be sad with my Self. It felt nice to cry my stifled tears and sadness into the Earth and have Her absorb it all. This has totally given me a new breath and energy to face the day. 🌈",J J,2021-01-24T15:35:37Z,2

"I started to notice that push ups (and downs) get much easier and that it&#39;s a slow progress but at some point yesterday I realized it: the small movements, finger wiggeling, changing positions slow and mindful.

This meant I was doing my yoga while my kids were running around me and occasionally joining in the poses with me before running off to  play again.

This made me end the practice with a huge smile on my face and a memory I&#39;ll relive everytime I&#39;m in savasana from now on.

I have the same problem. Had to go to a physical therapist. Apparently muscle tightness is pulling my knee out of alignment. I have to do daily stretches and I also use KT tape to help. It&#39;s slowly getting better with time.,Shannon Pitts,2021-01-24T13:29:10Z,1

"exactly what i needed adriene. i started this practice after getting up later 7am and deciding i could do with committing to slowing down not stressing or forcing myself to do this practice early. i released the &#39;lie-in&#39; had an early breakfast then went for a walk - which initially i was going to &#39;avoid&#39;. Tile-work - my breath/bathroom im sure got me in succint, lets do what i avoid-mode and then slow down again via Adriene. I swear i wasnot as tight or heady as i usually am. im glad there i didnt stress over not warming up because you care about the flow about the grace impact and the pace...i trusted. i did get what i needed. i swear i enjoyed it :-). i allowed more of the right time right place...no nonsense but awareness-sense more.  i swear it was meant to be. with love.

It&#39;s hard to believe there&#39;s only one week left. I feel like I skipped half of it but that&#39;s not true. And it always feels like five minutes and then we say namaste and it&#39;s over.<br />My leg muscles are sooo sore and it hurts sometimes but I&#39;m not giving up. Maybe I should exercise less and focus on yoga instead... <br />Thank you for the practice and I was moved by what&#39;s written in the email.,Osoroshii,2021-01-24T10:22:48Z,0

"What a beautiful practice! When I read the email, I was really happy because it was once again particularly relevant to me and timely, as I&#39;ve been planning and plotting projects in my head for the past few days, especially thinking of ways to bring more meaning to my life, show up as the best version of myself, and being of service to others. This was a reminder that dedication is key, but something I&#39;ve been struggling with in recent months and years. Then, stepping on the mat showed me that it can indeed be difficult, and things don&#39;t happen overnight, as the body or mind (or both) can get in the way of the best of intentions. I wasn&#39;t 100% into the practice physically, as my body felt pretty tired and weak, but I definitely worked on the mental and spiritual aspect of it. I now feel more convinced than ever that those changes I want to make are needed and important, and I&#39;m ready to really, truly dedicate myself to them. Thank you so much, Adriene, as always. See you all tomorrow!",Marion Carminelitta,2021-01-24T10:17:57Z,0

I&#39;ve always struggled with certain moves because of joint problems and weak wrists, but today I did the most planks/dfds since starting, and really holding them too. I think this is exactly what I needed to break through my fog this morning. Feeling proud 🥰",TashaPert,2021-01-24T09:40:05Z,0
"Really enjoyed this practice! It was a nice full circle moment for me: When Adriene said in the beginning dedicate this practice to someone, the first that popped in my mind was to dedicate it to myself. I actually felt quite happy and proud that I was able to prioritize myself and self-care in the moment. I really was able to enjoy and complete this practice for myself. Then when we neared the end, in childpose, Adriene asked to breathe out love to someone else. At that moment I dedicated every single breath out to a different friend. This made me really feel the power of first caring for yourself before you can be there for others. A really powerful realisation, and that in just a short practice, thank you Adriene these practices mean a lot &lt;3",Elieska,2021-01-24T09:40:00Z,2

Practicing with you every day has helped me stay centered throughout the pandemic. &lt;3",rachelrossos,2021-01-24T07:47:10Z,11
