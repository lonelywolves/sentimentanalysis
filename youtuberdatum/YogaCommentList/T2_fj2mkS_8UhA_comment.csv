"I do this video every few mornings - I typcally start my day with a yoga session. I know pretty much all the peculiarities of this one (&quot;get into my car&quot;, &quot;but we can do hard things&quot;). It&#39;s fun to discover new yoga vids, but there&#39;s a value in knowing one really well and following along to start the day.<br /><br />On the plus side, I&#39;ve been improving my tree pose. I can know close my eyes in tree pose for a few seconds without falling. The first time I did this vid, I could barely hang on with hands aboce my head....",logicOnAbstractions,2021-04-27T12:15:30Z,1

"got a little teary today when adriene said thank you for taking care of yourself. i think we usually tend to think of that as something that&#39;s just for ourselves, but there are always times (more or less often depending on the person) when taking care of yourself is incredibly hard work and you would just rather not do it. even though i know i am doing it for myself, and it should be mostly for myself, something about being thanked for doing it struck a chord. taking care of yourself can also be a service and a gift to people around you, especially those who love and care about you. namaste &lt;3",shai,2021-03-25T04:55:54Z,0

I started using your videos about a year ago when the pandemic began and my gym closed and my sister recommended your series. Wow. It has saved me. I so appreciate the way you talk WHILE doing the movements. Not easy to do but you make it work. Thank you for the wide variety of videos and for your low-key down-to-earth approach. I tell many people about your series. Blessings to you and yours.,Gay Eyerman,2021-02-28T15:15:29Z,1

I spent the 5 first minutes crying so much that I had trouble breathing, and then your voice, being on the mat, I started feeling more peaceful.

Man this was a great morning practice.  I have been choosing your rise practices after I completed the Breath 30 day series.  I am continuing to practice every day.  I have gone through all of your 30 day series and I am totally addicted to daily yoga.  I missed one day recently and honestly at my age (64) daily practice is very important for me to stay flexible.  Thank you so much for your awesome teaching style I feel like I am practicing with a friend. It is so wonderful to realize there are so many others doing the same thing in the world.

Not just for food but MORE YOGA 🧘🏻 I really love the combos here esp after just finishing the Heart &amp; Head reset phew 😌 🌯 I certainly earned my lunch today !! lmao 😜 As Adriene says “a little goes a long way”! An hour of my day is plenty to refresh and connect 😍🙌  Thank you so much and I wish the same energy for everyone not just here but especially those who don’t or cant practice something that connects them to goodness.. “There are lots of diff people out there..” but as long as you are growing you can rise above and inspire others to do the same 😆☀️🥰,SG Bene,2020-12-27T20:49:58Z,0

"Thanks so much, Adriene! I&#39;ve been doing yoga with Adriene daily for several years now. One thing that would help is, when you are going to offer an option (you can take a vinyasa, OR you can rest in child&#39;s pose), begin the sentence with the word &quot;either.&quot; That way I know that there is an option coming, I wait for the options before deciding what to do.

"Thank you so much Adriene for all you&#39;ve done for so many. I&#39;ve been doing yoga on and off for the last ~15 yrs but fell off the wagon of daily practice and I&#39;m finally getting back to it (to myself) again... I would practice here and there but it doesn&#39;t compare to a regimen. I&#39;ve also been going to ecstatic dance regularly for several years and get a lot of movement and connection that way, but with the pandemic this year, dancing at home just isn&#39;t the same (though I still try). I&#39;ve been practicing every day with you for about a couple months now (I&#39;ve done 2 of your 30-day challenges so far, plus some) and it&#39;s healing the chronic pain of my right shoulder, as well as generally making me feel better and better with every day, inside and out. I really appreciate that you talk a lot about what to adjust in the body. Finally again I feel like I have so much awareness and connection in my body and my practice.

Does Adriene have a video that teaches you how to avoid injuries?

"Back in august I hurt my back very badly. I couldn&#39;t walk, sit or sleep properly mostly due to me sitting behind my desk studying for a few months. I struggled afterwards getting the control of my body back gaining weight and losing stamina. I&#39;ve been going to the gym to fix that but since a couple of weeks I&#39;ve been watching these videos and I&#39;m making so much progress. My back feels great and I notice that doing Yoga and going to the gym simultaniously really keeps everything safe and relaxed and really helps reaching my goals.

My balance has never been great and whenever I did yoga I would struggle with tree pose. I decided to go back to it a month or so ago and I just finished Adriene&#39;s home practice. Today I was able to hold tree pose on both sides! I had to adjust a few times but I spent most of that move in tree pose and I really never thought it would be a pose I could actually get into!

"I’m not, or at least I wasn’t, the earthy crunchy type when it comes to my health. Give me all the western medicine. But then I was struggling with PPA, during COVID times no less, and Yoga With Adriene is about 80% of what helps me manage it. When it was really bad, I was doing about 3 videos a day, which is no small feat with two little kids and a job but that’s how bad it was and how bad I needed the videos. Still do but thankfully 1 a day does the trick now. :) The meds that help many people with this are an “activator” for me, which is the opposite of what I need, so this is my “medication.” Thank goodness for you, Adriene; I’ve never commented on anything from YouTube but your channel genuinely helps me everyday.

I am hypothyroid Hashimoto&#39;s and the inverted poses are really difficult for me. I can do one or two downward-facing dog&#39;s butt and I like to to stretch out my legs but that&#39;s about it. After that the inverted poses mess with my balance mess with my energy and I need to quit.<br />I am not a quitter but I got to take care of my own body.<br />I wonder if you&#39;d accept this challenge a friendly challenge 2 make a thyroid yoga 30 day series?

Hopefully this comment will reach you well.<br />I started yoga watching your videos during the Irish lockdown back in April I think. I’ve really really taken up to yoga as I’m stiff and it helped me get more flexible + pop up better when I surf + gain serenity.<br />I broke my arm yesterday when I fell from my bike. It looks like I’ll be in a scarf for a bit. The break is on the elbow so full cast.<br />Are there any moves that I could do with one arm? Is that a thing? I would hate to leave yoga behind as I feel like if the mind is at peace, the body will heal faster.<br />Thank you for everything you do xx",Marie Sauvé,2020-11-20T20:36:40Z,0

"Before stepping into &quot; Easy Stretching &quot; of Yoga , Educate yourself , It&#39;s an exercise of Mind, Body, Soul ... It&#39;s going to re-shape your entire Belief system in no time , It&#39;s a cult ...

She&#39;s VERY NEW, and not yet able to get into most positions but has gotten SO much stronger since beginning your practices.  Thanks for any advice in best yoga items to gift her!

I have always had a problem sitting cross-leg  on the ground. I feel like my middle back starts to jut out and my upper back starts to roll forward. It becomes very painful if I&#39;m sitting like that for more than about a minute. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I&#39;ve always been a little chunky and my belly gets in the way or if I&#39;m not doing something right...  Does anyone have any guidance on this?,JimtheCornFarmer,2020-11-04T19:20:36Z,0

Pre-Covid, I would work out 3-4x a week at the gym doing strength training then when covid hit I did fell back in love with yoga. But then a few months into quarantine I fell off the wagon completely when my mom was diagnosed with cancer so dealing with her, my mental health, WFH, etc, I just stopped being physical altogether. I&#39;m trying to do yoga every day now at least 30 mins (if not a full hour) broken up by doing a session in the morning and one at night and it&#39;s helping me so much physically and mentally. I want to slowly incorporate doing more physical workouts and have yoga be my supplement to either the start or end of my days or an off day from working out.

Much appreciation for everyone practicing! 😆🤘🌈,holistic hashy,2020-11-02T02:53:30Z,0

I’ve not been on the mat in 2 weeks.  Today was the day I decided to start a 30 practice to get ready for the January challenge.  This was the perfect practice. I felt so rejuvenated,Rolanda Wilkins,2020-11-02T02:39:22Z,0

"Accountability commenting this time around. I tried the January (?) challenge and really enjoyed it but didn&#39;t finish and haven&#39;t done much since. <br />Decided with the vibe of everything going on, I could really use a comeback. And I&#39;m so glad I did. Something I don&#39;t remember appreciating significantly enough is Adriene&#39;s gentle affirmations and encouragements and there&#39;s something that is so uplifting and great, I&#39;m having trouble wording it, but she just lets you know both that it&#39;s okay to be where you are but also that you CAN do this, you ARE capable of these tasks. <br /><br />Thank you so much for these videos and programs, Adriene. Glad to be here. Day 1/1.",Veronica Martinez,2020-11-02T02:20:55Z,0

"I was introduced to Yoga With Adriene last year by an acquaintance of mine who&#39;d been in a very bad cycling accident months prior. In speaking with her during her recovery after the accident, it came out that she is very well-versed in Yoga and was actively using Yoga to help with her healing process. Having no experience with Yoga and out of curiosity, I asked her for a good Yoga resource and she recommended YWA. Initially, I was surprised by how many videos there are, each with a different focus in mind. On a separate note, at the end of 2018, I gave myself temporary Sciatica on my right side by lifting something incorrectly and that was far too heavy for me to be lifting. Through physical therapy (with, I&#39;m certain, some Yoga positions involved) and strategic stretches (planks) on my own, though, I was able to eradicate the pain. In working through Adriene and Benji&#39;s videos, whatever accomplishments that I&#39;ve made or haven&#39;t made, anger, unease, stress, fear, or worry that I may have, it all goes away for 20 or 30 minutes. It&#39;s incredible just how tense muscles/tendons/ligaments can get by just dealing with everyday life. After Yoga, though, I feel like a rubberband, I feel calm, and I feel like I&#39;ve accomplished something! I remember getting so involved that, after watching the Yogi Tea video, I went out to the store at like 10pm and bought all of the ingredients (sadly, no fresh Cardamom seeds; only dried pods)! It doesn&#39;t matter if one is as skilled at the various Yoga positions as Adriene is; as long as you have the general idea of what the positions are trying to do, that&#39;s what matters. It&#39;s nice that Adriene understands that for everyone. Thank you, Adriene and Benji, for all of your videos and instruction. I&#39;m excitedly looking forward to more Yoga!",Jeffrey Brooks,2020-11-02T01:12:11Z,1
"I don&#39;t know when it happened but I truly look forward to knocking on heaven&#39;s door now. It&#39;s the yoga move I do most often off the mat, any time I need to breathe, or relax, or I can feel the anxious dread creeping in. Knocking on heaven&#39;s door absolutely helps me feel grounded.",Amy,2020-11-02T01:06:28Z,0

Thank you so much for taking the time to suggest modifications and ways to make this work for everyone. I’ve been having really bad sciatic pain and I’m so scared to get started with yoga again because sometimes it triggers the pain again. I’m not sure what modifications I should do to make sure I don’t trigger sciatic pain so if anybody has any suggestions let me know! I’m wear a waist brace thing and I think it’s helping. <br /><br />It felt like there was no judgment with the modifications. 💛🧡🤎❤️,Laura Reed,2020-11-01T22:14:11Z,0

"Adriene- I&#39;m celebrating today: ONE YEAR practicing yoga with you!! It occurs to me that in adulthood, there&#39;s not that many habits that &#39;stick&#39; for a year. And so last November 1 (2019 how I love you), I found you on YouTube. And haven&#39;t missed very many days all year, because I look forward to being on the mat. And I feel good. For a few years prior I kept thinking we needed a better mattress - my body hurt and was so stiff each morning when I woke up. But after just a few months of consistent yoga workouts, suddenly the mattress was no longer a problem. I stopped aching. And then a few more months I suddenly thought, &quot;wait. This plank is not that difficult.&quot; <br />Today&#39;s practice was the perfect way to commemorate my one year. I honestly felt tall during the first mountain pose (I&#39;m 5&#39; 2&quot; and felt I&#39;d say 5&#39; 8&quot;!) :) And I feel strong. And centered. And proud of myself. <br />Plus, I&#39;ve made a new friend: you. <br />Thank you.",Julie Mooney,2020-11-01T19:23:10Z,213

I&#39;ve been practicing daily with your videos since mid August and you have helped me to ground like I&#39;ve never been grounded before.<br /><br /> In early August, my husband (who is only 33) went to the hospital for extreme chest pain &amp; body pain(he has fibromyalgia). I drove frantically after the ambulance because I knew he was scared and alone. I did everything to try and get back to the ER to see him but they wouldn&#39;t allow me back because of new COVID rules. I had a panic attack and cried like I&#39;ve never cried before in my life. <br /><br />That&#39;s when I decided to start doing yoga daily to help my anxiety. I know I&#39;m not alone here, there are many of us here who feel the same, but thank you so much for all that you do. Your videos have helped me immeasurably to regain control over my mind, my body and my spirit. I could never thank you enough for just...being you and recording your awesome yoga videos which help all of us in this new crazy COVID world.",Emily Desautels,2020-11-01T18:18:56Z,0
"Does anyone else have the problem where your legs are always getting pins and needles/going numb in any of the lunges/warrior/leg based moves?<br /><br />Practicing from my tiny little dorm room in NYC today!! Wow, this practice and November guide couldn&#39;t have come at a better time than the day after Halloween - the day of sugar feasts! Feeling extra ready to rock since it&#39;s officially my birthday month and I&#39;ll be turning 21 at last. Though I must say, one of the biggest things yoga has done for me is replace the desire for alcohol! At least outside of the normal 21-year-old amount...in other words, just feeling very good to be alive and have a fiercely reborn breath!<br /><br />Lastly before I go as this is more for my own journaling sake than anything else; practicing with you and the YWA community has made me feel so much more openminded in the sense that I am who I am and I love it! I consistently feel free to express myself and be willing to share information with people I trust, or a loving and supportive community such as this one! Just to say that perhaps a year ago the last thing I would ever do is post a comment under a youtube video (though it seems trivial) for a variety of different reasons, and now here I am posting a two paragraph explanation of...who even knows what, that I&#39;m sure no one will read but that will warm my heart to share. So thank you, Adriene!! You and Benji have brought me fully into my life that I had been letting pass me by.",Hannah Phipps,2020-11-01T18:18:00Z,4

These past few weeks, however, I’ve been finding it harder to stick to my practise. I’ve just been stressed about the current state of the world, I guess.😂😭 Anyway, on a lighter note, my family might be getting a 🐶 dog (❗️), so I might have my own “Benji” soon (although my guinea pigs are good yoga mascots, too 👍🏻💕).

"I can’t wait to do some of this. I never get a full 30 minutes to myself unless my mom’s asleep (I’m a caregiver for her) but I need SOMETHING to ground me now... The past couple of weeks I’ve lost interest in everything. My future feels hopeless and I can’t turn to anything because nothing interests me. I wake up sad that I wake up, because nothing moves me to get out of bed and even exist. So... this challenge will hopefully tap into something this month. Ground me as I’ve recently just felt like I’ve been floating for no reason.<br /><br />UPDATE: it may have taken me 3 hours to finish this, but I did it! I’ve NEVER done a half-hour routine and the movement was SO nourishing after abandoning all movement and my pescetarian lifestyle over the weeks! I feel ease about my path.

"I find myself getting constantly surprised by the wonders of yoga, especially the at-home yoga practice. I swear by it, am a complete enthusiast, tell everyone about how sweet and yummy your videos are, Adriene, and yet, if I happen to skip a day or two, when I return to the mat, I&#39;m yet again blow away by the magic of it. It hits me with a new found intensity and grace. And it feels like a new beginning. As if my journey with yoga had only just begun, once again. Because it does, doesn&#39;t it? Each new day brings an opportunity to renew our relationship to the mat, to ourselves, to those around us.  A set of new eyes to look at things. New lungs to breathe in the air, oh so lovingly. Thank you so much for what you do, Adriene. You allow magic to get in through my door, day in, day out. And it never ceases to surprise me.",Mariana RNS,2020-11-01T09:45:54Z,78

@Lesley Foster The good news has once again come to you today. You can inherit the kingdom of God even if you are a sinner.. after all we are all sinners in God&#39;s standards of justice and holiness (he says that if a man looks at a woman with lust he has already committed adulterly with her in his heart NO MAN IS THAT PURE😅).....All you have to do is to honestly humbly pray repent/turn away from sins (read the10 commandments) and trust that Jesus for his love❤ for you he left his throne in heaven and came to the world he was humbled humiliated betrayed beaten and killed for your sake to pay the fine of your sins and mine so that we won&#39;t spend our eternity in hell but with him in heaven...this might be the last time you read the gospel...Look around🔥 be smart..the end is nigh🔥🔥 ..He is coming back soooon not as the sacrificed lamb of God🐑..but as King of Kings🤴 the judge of the whole world..Your soul is on the line😭.
