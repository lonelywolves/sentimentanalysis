"I know this wasn’t in the calendar for today but I needed something restorative and let me tell you, I full on CRIED. I didn’t realise how much I’d been pushing myself and trying to make my body do the most things. I didn’t know I needed to just stop. This practice made me realise I need to take a bit of time off of doing things and just focus on taking care of myself",Ev O,2021-05-01T00:34:14Z,0

Been sitting all day on my chair to work for a company on the other side of the globe and for the past days I had been asking myself if not living on the same time zone as my family and friends are, if letting my back ache from all the sitting, is worth it. Of course it is and I am indeed blessed to be working when a year ago, I was out of work because of the company closure due to the pandemic. Sometimes it&#39;s just really nice to slow down and think, and be thankful for what you have in the moment. Cheers to everyone on Day 14 of Renew.",itistheanne,2021-04-14T22:25:11Z,1

I suffer from severe anxiety and depression, and have just recently gone through a break up. It’s been a very rough time for me, but you and your practices have given me light. This was the first time I have cried during practice, because I felt so proud of how far I have come mentally. Thankyou Adriene for giving me guidance! x",Reyna Weitkuhn,2020-04-24T12:22:45Z,2

"I get this a lot when coming to lie on my back, especially after seated forward folds - it was especially intense though today with the burrito roll! I ended up just lying flat on the mat. I find bringing the soles of my feet to the mat helps ease it a little, or even just hugging my knees up to my chest a little first.

"Hello Adriene,<br />Thank you for another awesome practice. I just have a question concerning the first few back stretches in this video. I know it&#39;s one of your favorite positions but for me it gets very uncomfortable. the stretch in the upper back is so intense. It gives me hot flushes and I have trouble breathing. I can tell that it is something that I need to work on because it feels so much better afterwards but the discomfort is almost unbearable. Do you have any idea why? Why does it hurt so much when people usually love these back stretches? <br />Thanks. <br />Laura",Laura Cassata,2020-04-17T09:12:04Z,0

"Ahh Adriene!! You are such a bright light in my life, one that was much needed. I started with you in the fall, and have practiced with you every day this year so far. I did Home and right now I&#39;m scrolling through your incredible inventory of practices and &quot;finding what feels good&quot; on the daily. It&#39;s no coincidence that the videos I select seem to speak truth into my life that is so relevant -- what you share is almost always a reiteration of something  I&#39;m already learning in my life. It&#39;s just crazy. I totally agree that there is some magic in this whole operation. <br /><br /><br />I just read your most recent email (LOVE THOSE). I feel you on responsibility being a complicated thing to deal with emotionally. Even in that respect, you are a leader to many as we learn how to become leaders in our own lives as we watch you do the same as you lead this community to new places. Even in the short time I&#39;ve been following you I have seen so much growth in you. And I just want to remind you of what you help me remember every single day: you already have everything you need, so just keep trusting that instinct that got you this far.  This community of people trusts you because you radiate authenticity, honesty and love. Be sure to give yourself grace, because none of us expect you to be perfect. We just really dig your vibe. <br /><br /><br />Yoga has been truly life changing for me, and I find that it&#39;s helping me learn lessons and truths all over my life. So thank you so much for guiding me through the intimidating process of getting started so I could benefit from all the beautiful things yoga has to offer.  You make me feel at HOME in my body, which is an incredible gift and crazy that a stranger on the internet could influence me in that way.<br /><br /><br />You are changing the world  in amazing ways, Adriene!! Thank you for following your own voice and teaching us to do the same. It&#39;s beautiful to see this story continue to evolve. So here for it. &lt;3",Ashley Moon Thompson,2020-02-23T08:06:47Z,0

Obviously loved that practice, it actually came at the perfect time - plus I love my yoga nice and slow! These literal and figurative rolls felt amazing, I&#39;m now feeling calm and at peace. The fetal position at the end also felt like a gem of rest and getting back to my restorative self. As always, thank you Adriene!

"Hello from Québec, Canada. I love your yoga videos. They are helping me a lot to heal since a few months. You have a way to find the perfect words, exactly every time I need them. Love your simplicity, your energy and your presence. Thank you so much for making a difference in my life. By the way, my cat really loves Benji. He talks to him every time I begin a new video and he follows me during the session by relaxing by my side, just like Benji does. It&#39;s always a precious moment for me. P.S. I love your shirt. Where did you find it? Thank you again and lots of love to you and all the yogis who are following you. Namasté :)",Jenny Cadieux,2019-07-11T13:45:14Z,0

"Over the weekend we had a bit of a debate about Yoga.  apparently there is a new study that said Yoga is not good for you.  I said,  &quot;if it&#39;s not good for you, you are not doing it correctly.  Check out Yoga with Adriene!&quot;  She always tells us not to push ourselves into positions our particular bodies are not capable of.  It takes time and it&#39;s not about forcing into a certain pose.  I had another Yogi say, &quot;No comparison, no competition&quot; throughout her class.

"Hi Adriene, I discovered your channel a few weeks ago, and I have been loving doing yoga along with your video’s every day since! I do want to offer some constructive criticism with regards to your t-shirt though. <br /><br />I firmly believe culture/religion is there to be shared, so please don’t take this as an attack of some sorts. I think it’s fully possible to embrace ‘other’ cultures and religious symbols, but I do think it has to be done respectfully by considering the source of the item and with understanding of the symbol’s meaning and origin.<br /><br />I understand that the westernization of yoga makes the Ohm symbol and words such as ‘Namaste’ seem common and detached from deeper meanings, but they are still sacred symbols and words that have a meaning within Hinduism and other Asian religions. As someone who grew up in an Indian/Hindu household and family, I know many people who wear the Ohm symbol in the same way a Christian would wear a cross/crucifix. It carries the same kind of weight for its wearer. <br /><br />Therefore, I cringe a bit to see religious symbols and words being used as fashion statements or puns without (seemingly at least) regard for their origin and meaning. Some people would even say that depiction of the Ohm symbol on certain parts of the body (legs/feet &gt; tattoos or leggings), doormats, would be disrespectful. The same could be said for sport clothes that will be thrown on the floor or in the dirty laundry basket. I understand that is not necessarily the Western mentality (I am part of the Indian diaspora in Europe), but it’s something to consider when choosing to buy items with religious/sacred symbols on them.<br /><br />Maybe a good test for this could be to swap out the sacred symbol with, for example the Christian crucifix, so see if an item (specifically (fast) fashion items) can be regarded as offensive or not. I personally (!) don’t think a t-shirt with a smiley face and crucifix’ for eyes would go over very well, however well intended. But I would, of course, understand if you think otherwise.<br /><br />Again, not hating, just something to think about.  <br /><br />Thank you for making these video&#39;s and lots of love and peace to you!",Samantha,2019-07-02T11:07:41Z,1

"This was such a necessary practice, Adriene. After a full-steam ahead season, a full stop this weekend made me feel like I didn&#39;t know quite what to do with myself. When my towel roll/taquito stabilized my spine, my center was reminded that stillness is a good place to be as well. Thanks to you and your team and Benji (!!) for another timely and ahh-mazing practice. I&#39;ll be bookmarking this to follow after busy seasons ahead!",Faye Mendoza,2019-06-30T14:28:17Z,0

"✨😊✨Good morning from Sao Paulo, Brazil 🇧🇷<br />Goosebumps at the end ✨<br />During the practice I realized that before getting the FWFG path I was not able to relax. I cannot remember any couple of seconds of not having any tensions or concerns or the feeling that life was a crazy spinning plates game in which the distraction of a blink of an eye would cause downfall, crash, catastrophe. With the spinner being responsible for anything less than perfect around, guilty, guilty all the time.<br />Now, looking at that peaceful picture, Adriene+Benji+Mat+Blanket, and being able to just sit, breathe, and fold and roll my blanket makes me feel like having started a new life, like a reincarnation in life. New body, new thoughts, new energy. A fresh present person.<br />🌟 Measureless gratitude 🌟<br />Thank you Adriene &amp; Benji, and YWA FWFG team, and all the pals around the world sharing ✨good vibes ✨ in this amazing community<br />Namaste 😊🙏❤️🌟",Isis Santos Costa,2019-06-30T13:48:57Z,1

"@Anais Atlas Thank you for your comment. I&#39;d been searching for this shirt which is what made me stumble across your comment because I thought it was very cute and honestly hadn&#39;t even considered your point at all. To me, with my limited perspective, it&#39;s nothing more than a nod to something I find peace and value in. I appreciate your perspective and respect that it&#39;s different than mine. This challenge of my mindset has led to my morning studying up on cultural appropriation vs cultural appreciation in  yoga. It never would be mine, or (I believe) anyone else&#39;s intent to offended or disrespect others. I definitely don&#39;t think it was Adriene&#39;s intent either. I understand intent is not always what is received so I want you to know I am going to educate myself and do better. I have a lot to learn about the history of yoga before I present myself to the world as someone in the practice.",rach _,2020-07-22T13:46:27Z,1
"Please consider not buying T-shirts like this. The symbol used is sacred in Indian religions, not a symbol to slap on a T-shirt for a fun yoga experience. It can be considered offensive. Yoga has already been disconnected so much from it&#39;s Indian heritage, and then using symbols in this way.. It&#39;s not the greatest look.",Anais Atlas,2020-06-12T12:44:52Z,4

"Hello Adriene,<br />I&#39;m practicing from Norway and I just feel so strong in both my mind and body after a class like this!! I love what you do for all of us human beings that need a little bit of love from such a sympathetic person like you, Adriene. Each yoga practice of yours teaches me so much, that I wouldn&#39;t have enough space to write it down in this comment section. So big thank you for such sweet and loving practices that you share with us. Namaste.",Miłka,2019-06-30T05:19:31Z,25

"I&#39;ve been feeling overwhelmed by the number of deadlines I have to meet over the past week or so and just how much work there is to do. Was thinking of sleeping late this Sunday morning to get a little break from all this work. Knowing what day it is today, I checked my phone&#39;s notifications, immediately saw this and clicked it. There&#39;s no better way to slow it down than with a brand new video of Adriene&#39;s. Thank you for being by our side on both the hard and happy times Adriene. Truly appreciate the soothing words and positive vibes in the videos as it&#39;s always been. Your magic is spreading rapidly to shift the world towards becoming a better place. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-06-30T05:16:09Z,53
