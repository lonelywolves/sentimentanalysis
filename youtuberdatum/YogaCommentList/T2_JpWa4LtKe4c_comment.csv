"Dear friends, let&#39;s welcome in the new year together. Are you IN?",Yoga With Adriene,2020-12-13T15:38:05Z,2595
"I just finished this wonderful 30 day journey and really enjoyed it and learned from it.  I&#39;m going to redo this journey as I really felt the benefit of daily practice and I&#39;ve started on another journey of running, am training for a marathon in November, its a mind marathon challenge where we strenghten our minds to make our body strong to complete the marathon.  I have found that my yoga practice has really helped with the running as I haven&#39;t ran in over 10 years due to back and hip injuries.  Now I feel strong and ready to take on a marathon challenge in my 50th year so thank you Adriene for your continued presence in my life with daily yoga practice and giving me the courage to take on something totally out of my comfort zone.  See you on the mat.  Love to Benji, my own dog Alfie joins me daily",Maura Hennessy,2021-03-25T08:49:07Z,0

"Dear Adriene, a very big thanks to you for this journey. I haven&#39;t been able to attend yoga classes for some time, and a friend reminded me of your channel, so I came back to where a lot of my journey began. It was a great experience, so simple, so pure and so powerful... I have just completed the 30 days and now going deeper on my own home journey in nature. Thank you, keep doing what you do",Mike Parry,2021-04-20T14:27:07Z,0

"As my town has been in lockdown for pretty much a year (give or take a month or two) I&#39;ve not seen any friends in person for over a year, no routine, no freedom and fresh air and SO MUCH SITTING cooped up in one room- it has taken its toll physically and mentally. I remember the last time i felt good was when i was doing yoga daily, and this popped up on my recommendeds. Thank you! I know I&#39;m a few months late to this particular party but I am here now and I can&#39;t wait to start feeling human again.",I'm Tash,2021-04-03T17:18:37Z,0

Hi Adriene! My name is Emiliano and we&#39;re doing the breathe 30 days w my gf and we&#39;re are loving it and probably will take the subscription! I was wondering if you can recommend some yoga classes in spanish in youtube cause I will love that my mom starts with it. But sadly she speaks only spanish if not I would recommend this channel.

I am so thankful that I discovered Yoga with Adriene. I hadn&#39;t kept up with my yoga practice for quite a long time. I felt it difficult to motivate myself on my own since not going to a class.

I will continue with Adriene forever if possible.,Carol Lundstrom,2021-02-08T20:50:35Z,0

WELL, I&#39;ve been following your calendar- you have literally ministered to me so deeply over the craziness of 2020 and I did this 30 day challenge.  And as I wipe a way tears, it&#39;s cause I did the full 50 minutes and I think I finally understand what it means to find what feels good.  Thank you Adriene.

"My daughter convinced me to do this with her and we are enjoying it! Some things are too hard for me but that&#39;s fine for now. We have some comic moments when our two Saint Bernards try to get involved--they aren&#39;t as calm as Adriene&#39;s cute dog--but maybe they will learn from him too, or at least get used to it. <br />Brava!

"I&#39;ve learned to love my body through yoga, particularly through Adriene. I&#39;ve been regularly practicing for over a year and I feel amazing, feeling myself getting stronger and more flexible. Simple things like Adriene getting us to touch our bellies when breathing has really improved my relationship with my body and love it rather than criticize myself so often. If anyone is in doubt about starting a yoga journey, please do, it has been incredible for my mental health and fitness, plus you have an excuse to buy a cute pair of leggings! It may be hard at first but yoga has got me through some tough times and I really look forward to my time on the mat.",Rachel Turner,2021-01-16T18:03:14Z,0

"I am so very grateful for the opportunity to experience these 30 days at the beginning of the year with the rest of the community! I have spent the past year exploring all of your videos and have done ALL of the 30 day programs, as I committed myself to a daily yoga practice in 2020. It has helped me to work through a back injury, given me better mobility and strength, helped me to find a deeper sense of self as I have worked on really tough stuff in therapy, and given structure to my day that was desperately needed in this pandemic time. I just published a blog post about my journey this past year, and wanted to share it with you: <br /><a href=""https://wellspringenergyworks.com/daily-yoga-practice-reaping-rewards/"">https://wellspringenergyworks.com/daily-yoga-practice-reaping-rewards/</a> <br />Thank you, Adriene, for your beautiful spirit and loving approach.

"So excited to actually do this in real time! I discovered YWA January 2020 and the first 30 day journey I took, along with my partner was Yoga Camp. We were both so engaged by her teaching style and so enriched by the first experience that we cycled through every 3o day journey she has made. Every single one has been a gift and deepened our practice and sense of self connection profoundly. I had practiced yoga on and off over the years but never had a home practice let alone a daily practice. We haven&#39;t missed a day on in the mat in 2020 (okay maybe a day here or there but very few). We are not spring chickens (50 plus) and this is the strongest I&#39;ve felt in years. It has changed our life and changed our bodies (but that&#39;s almost the secondary benefit relative to the mental health benefits.) We are so deeply grateful for YWA and amazed by this community.  Adriene, you&#39;re a Rock Star.Thank you!",Jen-Scott Mobley,2020-12-30T21:37:55Z,0

I love your classes but also your wise and kind words, your awareness about conflicted relationship people have with themselves (and the world). I truly believe that you can spread peace only when you find it inside of yourself. You have helped me find mine. I consider you my good friend although we have never met. Your spirit is with me. Thank you for that! Also thank you for offering free classes in today&#39;s capitalistic society. Namaste. Big hug to all the good people in this community. 🙏🍀",Anonymous X,2020-12-30T20:42:58Z,0

I haven&#39;t been able to really work out or do yoga in a couple of months because I&#39;ve been struggling with my mental health and school has been really hard. Even the basic daily things such as getting out of bed or going out with my friends have been really hard to accomplish lately so I&#39;m really looking forward to January to see if this would be something I could stick to because I know that yoga has brought me a lot of joy and happiness in the past.

So grateful to see this new one to kick start 2021 and a focus on the breath too, from one yoga student/ teacher from my heart to yours.. I honour the love and light that resides in you Adriene... I&#39;m truly learning that the real essence of yoga is within the yama&#39;s and niyama&#39;s &amp; simply being present. Yoga is not about the asanas... and you are a beautiful soul whom I am so grateful for... What a beautiful theme for a 30 day challenge.

"4 Het werd vernietigd, de aarde viel; werd ziek, de wereld viel; de hoge volkeren van de aarde werden ziek. 5 En het land werd verontreinigd onder zijn inwoners; omdat ze de wetten overtreden, ze de wet verdraaiden, ze het eeuwige verbond schonden. 6 Om deze reden verteerde de vloek het land en werden de inwoners verwoest; om deze reden werden de bewoners van de aarde verteerd en werden de mensen kleiner.<br />7 De wijn is verloren, de wijnstok is ziek, alle vrolijkheid van hart kreunde.<br />8 De blijdschap van de tamboerijnen is opgehouden, het geluid van degenen die zich verheugden, de vreugde van de harp is opgehouden.<br />9 Onder gezang zullen zij geen wijn drinken; cider zal bitter zijn voor degenen die het drinken.<br />10 De stad wordt verbroken door ijdelheid; elk huis is gesloten, zodat niemand naar binnen kan.<br />11 Er wordt geroepen vanwege gebrek aan wijn op straat; alle vreugde was verduisterd, vreugde werd van de aarde verbannen.<br />12 De stad was woest en de poort werd verwoest.<br />13 Want zo zal het zijn in het midden van de aarde, te midden van de volken, als een geschudde olijfboom, als nalezingen na de oogst.<br />Jesaja 24: 4-13.<br />-<br />6 En u zult horen van oorlogen en geruchten van oorlogen; zorg ervoor dat je niet gestoord wordt, want het is noodzakelijk dat dit allemaal gebeurt; maar het einde is nog niet. 7 Want volk zal opstaan ​​tegen volk, en koninkrijk tegen koninkrijk; en er zullen plagen en hongersnoden en aardbevingen zijn op verschillende plaatsen.8 En dit alles zal het begin van pijn zijn. Matteüs 24: 6-8 JEZUS.<br />-<br />26 “Net zoals het gebeurde in de tijd van Noach, zo zal het zijn wanneer de Zoon des mensen komt. 27 Ze aten, dronken en trouwden en huwden tot de dag dat Noach de ark binnenging; toen kwam de vloed en vernietigde ze allemaal.<br />28 Hetzelfde gebeurde in de tijd van Lot: ze aten en dronken, kochten en verkochten, zaaiden en bouwden. 29 Maar op de dag dat Lot &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39; (Sodom) &#39;&#39; &#39;&#39; verliet, regende het vuur en zwavel uit de hemel en vernietigde ze allemaal.<br />30 “Zo zal het zijn op de dag dat de Zoon des mensen wordt geopenbaard. Lukas 17: 26-30 JEZUS<br />-<br />9 En wanneer u hoort van oorlogen en opruiingen (protesten tegen hun heersers), schrik dan niet; omdat het nodig is dat deze dingen eerst gebeuren; maar het einde zal niet onmiddellijk zijn. 10 Toen zeide hij tot hen: Natie zal tegen volk opstaan, en koninkrijk tegen koninkrijk; 11 en er zullen grote aardbevingen zijn, en op verschillende plaatsen hongersnoden en pestilenties; en er zullen verschrikking en grote tekenen uit de hemel komen.<br />Lukas 21: 7-11<br />-<br />12 en omdat het kwaad is toegenomen, zal de liefde van velen verkouden.<br />13 Maar wie volhardt tot het einde, zal worden gered. 14 En dit evangelie van het koninkrijk zal in de hele wereld worden gepredikt als een getuigenis voor alle natiën; En dan komt het einde. Matteüs 24: 12-14<br />-<br />22 En als die dagen niet werden bekort, zou niemand worden gered; maar vanwege de uitverkorenen zullen die dagen worden ingekort. Matteüs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpWa4LtKe4c&amp;t=24m22s"">24:22</a> JEZUS<br />-<br />8 Maar God toont zijn liefde voor ons, in de tijd dat we nog zondaars waren, Christus JEZUS stierf voor ons.<br />9 Omdat wij reeds gerechtvaardigd zijn in zijn bloed, zullen wij door hem van toorn worden verlost.<br />10 Want indien wij, als vijanden, met God verzoend zijn door de dood van zijn Zoon, en nog meer, als wij verzoend zijn, zullen wij gered worden door zijn leven. Romeinen 5: 8-10<br />---<br />16 “Omdat God zoveel van de wereld hield dat hij zijn eniggeboren Zoon (JEZUS) heeft gegeven, zodat een ieder die in hem gelooft niet verloren gaat, maar eeuwig leven heeft. Johannes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpWa4LtKe4c&amp;t=3m16s"">3:16</a><br />-<br />18 Kom vlug, zegt de Heer, en laten we op onze hoede zijn: als uw zonden als scharlaken zijn, zullen ze wit zijn als sneeuw; als ze rood zijn als karmozijnrood, zullen ze als witte wol zijn. Jesaja <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpWa4LtKe4c&amp;t=1m18s"">1:18</a><br />-<br />9 dat als u met uw mond belijdt dat Jezus de Heer is, en met uw hart gelooft dat God hem uit de dood heeft opgewekt, u gered zult worden.<br />10 Want met het hart wordt geloofd tot gerechtigheid, maar met de mond wordt beleden tot redding.<br /> Romeinen 10: 9-10<br />--23 Want het loon van de zonde is de dood, maar de gave van God is het eeuwige leven in Christus Jezus, onze Heer. Romeinen <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpWa4LtKe4c&amp;t=6m23s"">6:23</a><br />-<br />12 En in geen ander is er redding; want er is geen andere naam onder de hemel, aan de mensen gegeven, waardoor we kunnen worden gered. Handelingen 4: 11-12<br />-<br />10 zodat in de naam van Jezus elke knie zou buigen, van hen die in de hemel en op aarde en onder de aarde zijn;<br />11 en elke tong belijdt dat Jezus Christus de Heer is, tot eer van God de Vader. Filippenzen 2: 10-11<br />-<br />12 Maar aan allen die hem ontvingen, aan hen die in zijn naam geloofden, gaf hij het recht kinderen van God te worden; Johannes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpWa4LtKe4c&amp;t=1m12s"">1:12</a><br />-<br />23 Jezus antwoordde en zeide tot hem: Wie mij liefheeft, zal mijn woord bewaren; en mijn Vader zal hem liefhebben, en wij zullen tot hem komen en bij hem wonen. Johannes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpWa4LtKe4c&amp;t=14m23s"">14:23</a><br />-<br />23 Maar het uur komt, en is nu, dat ware aanbidders de Vader zullen aanbidden in geest en in waarheid; omdat de Vader ook zulke aanbidders zoekt om hem te aanbidden.<br />24 God is Geest; en degenen die hem aanbidden, in geest en in waarheid is het noodzakelijk dat ze aanbidden.<br />Johannes 4: 23-24<br />27 Vrede laat ik met u, mijn vrede geef ik u; Ik geef het je niet zoals de wereld het geeft. Laat uw hart niet verontrust zijn, en laat het ook niet bang zijn. Johannes <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpWa4LtKe4c&amp;t=14m27s"">14:27</a><br />JEZUS.<br />Er is kracht in DE NAAM VAN JEZUS.,",Walter Zepeda,2020-12-28T06:00:50Z,0

"Hi Wendy, Adriene is pretty good at including guidance for all levels. I think the benefits change with level of ability/time you are practicing. <br /><br />I will say this: you don&#39;t need to be flexible to do yoga. Yoga helps you become more flexible. And that&#39;s not even the most important part. The important part, to me, is being with, learning about, and caring for yourself and your body.<br /><br />What does help though is checking out the beginner videos on the channel, there are some good tips for modification in there too.",Lian Beijers,2020-12-30T20:16:59Z,0

"I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll see this, but i wanted to put it out there if you do. At the beginning of the pandemic, my mental health was SPIRALING. I lost control of my normal life and nothing was helping. Crying every day over literally anything, stopped eating, major depression. The works. Then i found your videos. I developed a routine with yoga. And i couldn&#39;t do yoga unless my floors were clean, so i would have to clean my house. And slowly, I made new routines. So, thank you for existing and putting these videos on YouTube. You truly have helped me so much.",Nicoleclmitchell,2020-12-26T16:51:21Z,51

"📝 note;;; please remind me about this challenge (when it comes out) in the replies so I don’t forget<br /><br /><br /><br />Thank you for being our light💓I remember doing a few days of home, but fell off of it months back. I’ve been responsible for raising a chick these past months, so I’ve also fell off working out. Gonna try doing yoga with the chick, since it’s bigger now 😹 I’ve been very dull this year, as I’m sure a lot of us have. I’ve experienced loss and tbh just a lot of darkness. I haven’t felt myself. So I’m doing a physical + mental reset challenge, and I’ll be doing breath on the 1st of January. <br /><br />I’ve also started journaling. Btw I really recommend journaling whenever you feel all those feelings and thoughts. I’ve only been journaling for a few days, but I’ve found that it really helps clear your mind for the day. (I’ve been doing it when I wake up) love you all, and cya at the beginning of the new year for a “breath” of fresh air!",Ebsfxx edits,2020-12-20T23:50:28Z,0

I’m so thankful to our source and everything known and unrecognized by me that led me to find your inspired work and all that inspired me to grow gently but steadily dedicated to my wellness. (I’m still growing). I usually cry at the end of each of these (this will be my third) but now I’m crying just at this 😂 This year has been a wild ride and for me the last decade has been rough and I’m just in awe and proud to have grown to maintain balance and not lose my mind or give up on living. The ever flowing love from source and my constant willingness to open to it again and again is why I’m still here and I’m just so tender about it right now.

I discovered YWA through the 30 Days of Yoga Journey in the middle of July and now on Jan 2nd I will be starting my 6th Journey!! Throughout the pandemic I have been looking for silver linings and YWA is really more of a platinum one:):) I am so excited to be doing this one in real time with Adriene and our global community. My 2nd yoga journey was Home (kind of a premonition on Adriene’s part that this is how she began 2020), followed by Dedicate. I then was going to do True but with the timing of things leading into the election I figured Revolution was more appropriate. I am now 3 days from completing True. My daily time on the mat with Adriene has truly become my spiritual practice. I am immensely grateful for what she has created here.

"the parts of your practices where you encourage us to connect to our breath are always the hardest, hardest part for me, as my breath reminds me of my trauma (I have a deviated septum/broken nose from sports injuries as a kid that were never fixed due to insurance woes and parental issues). I&#39;m afraid of the &quot;breath&quot; journey. my breath is not something I want to connect to... most often I&#39;m trying to suppress any consciousness of it because in an instant I can fall apart. but this might be an opportunity to try to reckon with some of that trauma and see what I can learn from what will likely be a lot of tears. anyway, thank you so much for what you do, Adriene.",Jenny C,2020-12-14T04:29:02Z,0

"i had a big relapse yesterday and fell back to old, dangerous habits. i called my therapist and she asked me what i used to do to keep myself happy and safe, and my mind immediately went to you. when i was at my lowest of lows, one of your videos popped up on my youtube recommended and i decided it was a sign. i made it my responsibility to do 30 days of yoga, even if it was the only thing i was able to do that day. when i started spiraling recently, before falling into this relapse, i had stopped taking care of myself and i stopped doing yoga. almost immediately after i ended my phone call with my therapist, crying and shaking, i got this notification. your kind soul was there the first time i needed it, and here you are again! i never believed in any sort of &#39;signs&#39; or anything spiritual, really, before you. thank you for opening up my heart and mind to such a healing, life changing experience. you dont know how much you&#39;ve done for me. i will never be able to thank you. i needed this. namaste, adriene 🤍",emme,2020-12-14T01:17:04Z,870

@Pallavi Kothare hey i found your comments a little unnecessary and kind of weird. no offense but no one was talking about yoga being credited to hinduism and there was literally no need for you to mention it. i understand you wanting to spread knowledge but the youtube comment section is no proper place to do it. btw no one makes fun of indians and your comments seem very passive aggressive. calm down please and come back when you feel more mature.,bhavya kumar,2021-01-26T22:37:07Z,4

"It has been 2 months since I have been sincerely, consciously practicing yoga. Adriene you gave me such a boost of positivity and happiness during our sessions together. I can&#39;t be more thankful to the universe for making me meet this great person that you are. I have been recently operated with a laparoscopic surgery for gallbladder stone. I swear, if I had not stumbled onto you, I couldn&#39;t had survived such a trying phase of my life. Thank you for being the amazing person that you are. <br />But can I again restart these yoga sessions and welcome the new year with a new boost of energy? Don&#39;t know <br />But lots of love for you.",anonymous 2.0,2020-12-13T17:41:21Z,0

Home was my first 30 day journey and it was the start to a real yoga commitment. During the beginning of the pandemic I suffered an injury and could not continue. I recently decided to start the Honor calendar as my mental health has been garbage lately with working in healthcare at this time. It was definitely helped to centre my thoughts and I feel more at peace!  I cannot wait to begin the next 30 days of breath!!,Kaitdee Dee,2020-12-13T16:54:34Z,0

Hi all! I have a question to everyone who does ywa monthly calendar videos daily. Do you follow a separate workout routine? <br />I have a busy schedule and I sometimes struggle to do a 30-40min workout on top of yoga. If I don&#39;t do some other workout I am worried I am not gonna be fit. But I can&#39;t let go of Adriene either. Her daily videos are something I adore and look forward to. <br />Thanks in advance ❤️<br />P.S. Please ignore mistakes in my English. I am not a native speaker 😇,Arya Granger,2020-12-13T14:43:48Z,0
"Hi from Germany 🙋🏻‍♀️ I practice the YWA every day, right at the beginning of the day, early in the morning. I try to practice Yoga for one complete hour, so I do the actual video of the monthly schedule and then afterwards I chose any other of Adriene‘s videos, which has the right length to make a full hour complete. So I know no matter what the day brings, I have done a valuable one hour practice to keep body and mind fit, even if I do not do any other sports / exercise. But if I find the time later during the day, I go power walking or biking in addition to keep me in shape and fit. But I don‘t worry or blame myself, if it is „only the Yoga“ and nothing else. Best wishes to you 🤗",Essay,2020-12-13T15:09:53Z,0

"First time i was introduced to your videos was back when you started the 30Days of Yoga, if I am not mistaken it was 2015. Now almost 6 years later, some things have changed but some remained the same! I dont always keep on tract with every yoga practice, but I know that your videos are always there for me...when i want to do some yoga or just when i feel messed up (just like what i was feeling back then in 2015, at the first video of 30days of yoga).<br /> So this year has been tough for me (as for many people across the globe too).<br />Your videos will once again make me find myself and trust life as I always should.<br />So, thank you Adriene....thank you for everything!!❤I am looking forward to practicing a new 30 day of yoga series with you!

"I&#39;m now on 90 days of yoga with Adriene, practising over the back catalogue of your videos between 5-45 minute sessions and loads on repeat and have gained so much from your videos ( strength, appreciation of breath, diminishing lower back pain). I have always dabbled with yoga on and off but you&#39;ve really brought yoga home for me especially during this year. I look forward to actually following a current 30-day practice with you and everyone in this community at the same time. Love your channel, your personality, love Benji. Thank you for all you do Adriene. I love you! Keep well and safe and look forward to this new 30-day breath adventure 🧡🧘🏾‍♂️<br /><br />P.S. Could you make a blooper reel, outtakes etc. I am sure there are moments where Benji decided to step in front of the view or join in some points.

Relieved that I am still here on this path, relieved that this is still happening as it is one of the defining moments of the year for me, relieved that I can just breathe again. <br /><br />The last few years have really been kicking my family’s behinds with my mom being diagnosed with cancer, other serious family illnesses, work stress, as well as everything else that we’ve all been dealing with. Thank you as always Adriene for making this beautiful safe space to just be myself a d with myself for awhile.",Vardagaladhiel,2020-12-13T14:05:42Z,1

"My friend Becky introduced me to YWA at a week-long reunion at the end of February (we fortunately got it in just before we all sheltered in place at our respective homes on the US East Coast!); I started practicing on April 1st &amp; haven&#39;t missed a day since!  I&#39;m basically working backwards, having started with Home &amp; then the other 30 day challenges every other month, filling in the interim months with Adriene&#39;s other individual practices.  I&#39;ve done other routines via DVDs for decades but they&#39;re gathering dust now, as I&#39;m a daily YWA yogi now!  Am looking forward to starting 2021 (it&#39;s got to be better than 2020, right?!) with Breath, especially since I&#39;ve only particpated once in a live International Yoga Day this year.  THANKS Adriene for your huge contibution to the wellness of my body &amp; mind this year &amp; presumably for the rest of my retired life! <br />✌❤🕉",Janey Huber,2020-12-13T13:21:18Z,1

"Yess! I was waiting for this announcement! Starting a new year with 30 days of yoga is my favorite tradition for [i can&#39;t even remember how many - 3-4?] years. Last year I couldn&#39;t finish Home series because of big health issues with my back, so I had to forget about yoga for more than 10 months. Obviously I&#39;ve lost all the progress and I have to start from the very beginning now, but I&#39;m super excited about this journey and ready to rock! Anyway, thank you, Adriene, for helping me discover my better self. And greetings from Moscow :)",Tanya T.,2020-12-13T08:03:47Z,6

Home, Dedicate, Yoga camp, revolution and many other single videos depending how I felt each day..  It was a great experience and a hilarious one (your sense of humor is wow 😂😂)..  It helped me get grounded, connect with my feelings and my breath.. and move my body regularly (i find sticking to exercising much harder).. Yoga became my number one self care habit of the year and I&#39;m planning to continue practicing it more.. I&#39;m so grateful for you Adriene.. You were my best friend this year..
