"It‚Äôs so important that we take the time to check in with ourselves, especially when our relationship to the future brings a certain kind of weariness.<br /><br />How are you feeling after today&#39;s full length practice?",Yoga With Adriene,2021-02-07T14:34:59Z,764
"Thank you so much for this practice. I had been out of touch with my relationship with yoga for months and just picked it up today after getting engaged 2 days ago. While this is wonderful and exciting, there are many other emotions that im feeling as well (among them uncertainty for the future). This is just what I needed for that emotional release. ‚ù§",Mary Schabilion,2021-05-09T02:14:19Z,0

"I hadn&#39;t been able to do this practice because I couldn&#39;t find the energy for 50 minutes of yoga. But I did it right after I got the answer I have been waiting for for over a year. I was shaking throughout most of it, like a dog releasing tension. I feel a lot better now.<br />I so so so appreciate this practice.

Adrienne... I have so enjoyed practicing Yoga with you every morning since shortly after the Pandemic began. I began on Prime and noticed lots of the practices I saved are no longer available. I don&#39;t have a lot of time in the mornings during my work week and hope you will continue offering practices there. This practice was LOVELY and offered so much for me. Grateful for your gentle approach and direction. Your humor is delightful and quiets any thoughts of self criticism. ‚ô•Ô∏è,A Adams,2021-04-25T12:31:29Z,0

"I used to do yoga twice a day. Morning and night, I made such good progress. I got sick at the start of the pandemic and it took a toll on my body, and I stopped yoga. I already have Fibromyalgia and hypermobility and I lost all motivation to do yoga. I have recently started to do the odd day of yoga and im really trying to do it every day after work. I&#39;m so exhausted from work that I don&#39;t think I can even find the motivation to get my mat. This practice is my first long practice. I didn&#39;t even notice how long this practice was, I just did it with no hesitation. I&#39;ve had migraines for the past week coming from my awful back and shoulder pain. I feel so much better after this practice. I feel like my muscles are stronger and looser. Most importantly I feel proud of myself for finally rolling out the mat again. I missed yoga so much. üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",SimplySaz,2021-04-20T20:34:30Z,0
"I like these long videos, though I&#39;m in bad shape so we&#39;ll see how well it goes. <br /><br />If I could do a request from you, I find that prolonged but light exercise does me the most good, so if we could get a few videos that last for an hour but don&#39;t demand too much constant muscle strength, that would be amazing.<br /><br />A big thank you to you from Finland, from a follower of yours for almost since you started making videos on Youtube.",Lawrence H,2021-04-20T19:12:29Z,0

"I&#39;m not sure if Adriene (or anyone) will read this since I was late to this practice, but this is what I needed. 2020 was difficult, but the beginning of 2021 has proven to be just as difficult. As a recent grad, I&#39;m having a tough time finding a full-time job, I&#39;m dealing with toxicity at home, and due to the travel ban, I can&#39;t visit my boyfriend. This practice is shown that I&#39;m capable of making it through moments I perceive as tough.

"Hi Adriene! I LOVE your videos and so does my friend.  Although my best friend, who is an Indian American, had a interesting discussion with me about the importance of yoga teachers making it clear where the tradition of yoga came from, and also making a special point to use more of the original names for the poses. Yoga can be for anyone! but since yoga has become more mainstream, as you can imagine, it could be irritating for this cultural practice to become totally disconnected from its creators. I don&#39;t think for the most part you partake in this but there&#39;s definitely a lot of white people (even some in your audience) who are openly disrespectful towards Indian people (I see it all the time: at school, in public, and family events) and then brag about how they do yoga, totally ignorant to the fact that they&#39;re practicing something created by those same people. I truly mean no disrespect and I love your stuff Adriene, just food for thought.","Kisses, Dani",2021-03-06T19:01:46Z,0

"IMPORTANT FOR ADRIENE TO SEE: I had a great inspiration today while working out and wanted to share with you as something to maybe try in one of videos. A video like this would be outside of your the typical flow of your 30 days journeys and more focused on having a very meditative experience. The main idea is what I was call a Yoga Breath Series - that instead of narrating while posing if you just used a head worn mic just to capture your inhales and exhales as you moved through poses and then you overlayed the narration afterwards. This way the student can really focus on their body-breath-mind connection while moving through each pose. I think this is a central part of the yoga experience but is something that you usually only can do once you&#39;ve developed and memorized a practice but is hard to create during instruction because the instructor is having to narrate and guide during the poses. This would be different from the usual home practice vibe of your videos, but I think a few videos like this might catch on for those looking to really engage into an unfamiliar practice. I wanted to share this feedback cause I love your channel and how much great content you give away for free and hope the idea could contribute in some way to the success of these videos or maybe something you could share with a fellow content creator. Thanks Adriene! Like up if the concept interests you.",nicolasap86,2021-03-02T16:53:19Z,0

"So, I&#39;m an intermediate yogi and I tried this one.  At first I was impatient, saying to Adriene &quot;Come on already.&quot; But then I noticed a shift in me. That I had to really focus on each posture, breathe into it.  And when Adriene said that those who are asking for a more advanced practice,  that the practice as advanced, and we were forced to deeply breathe and stay with each posture for more than a second. I started to shift.  Each posture was deliberate. Each posture was not rushed. And it was challenging. So bravo Adrienne, for doing this one.  I loved it. Thank you.",Elaine K,2021-02-21T22:23:22Z,0

"Hi Adriene, <br />First I want to say thank you so much for making these videos. I&#39;ve been practicing yoga following along with your videos for the last 3 months and it&#39;s truly been such a positive and transformative experience. <br /><br />I know that this is out of left field and not at all the focus of this page, but I was wondering if you would ever consider making a video that&#39;s yoga for trans folks or yoga for pre top surgery. Maybe for June/pride month?  I started my yoga journey on your page because I&#39;ve been preparing for top surgery and I need to increase my upper body strength as well as mobility and stability in my neck and shoulders and upper back. Your videos have been so wonderful for that. <br /><br />Again I know that&#39;s not the focus of your page, but I think it fits really well into the spirit of your page, which I see as self care, self actualization, connecting with your body and mind. <br /><br />Thank you again for such wonderful resources.",Kate Roll,2021-02-19T20:05:45Z,0

"Hey lovely people, I want to start a daily yoga and meditation practice for the morning, something that goes for no more than 45 minutes, it would be great if there was a course I could do. I&#39;m a bit overwhelmed by all the available options, could anyone recommend anything?",Isabel Webster,2021-02-13T06:44:59Z,0

"Hi Adriene and friends! I don&#39;t know where else to post this, but I got a reply in a previous comment from an account that was posing as you and it seemed like they were asking for money/phishing for my personal info in their replies! I reported to youtube, but I just don&#39;t want to see anyone in this community taken advantage of because they thought they got a reply from Adriene and crew and it wasn&#39;t actually them! Please take care, all.",Marisa,2021-02-13T04:37:59Z,0

Life started becoming overwhelming but because of some of the lessons I‚Äôve learned from the sessions I‚Äôve done I‚Äôve strengthened my mind on a complete different level. Today I told myself I was going to do yoga and the very first one I saw was dealing with uncertainty.

"Dear Adriene, our lives in Myanmar can‚Äôt be more uncertain than this month. I love celtic music, table tennis, yoga and watching soccer but it‚Äôs been ten days that I couldn‚Äôt do any of them. It‚Äôs been ten days that I couldn‚Äôt do any practice with you. I‚Äôve never missed more than two consecutive days in a year. The military coup stressed us so much that we couldn‚Äôt follow our passions anymore. They are always ready to cut us off from the whole world and for blood baths. Yesterday‚Äôs blood shed in Nay Pyi Taw within peaceful protest was the proof. So many chosen people‚Äôs leaders and innocent civilians activists against this coup are detained in unknown places everyday. I don‚Äôt know when my turn will come. Now they are trying to build the great fire wall in the country with the help of Chinese Government. I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôd be able to practice with you anymore after that. We are needing international awareness and EFFECTIVE HELP more than ever! Sanctions won‚Äôt do anything. Millions of people all over the country are still protesting daily, trying so hard to get the world notice our helpless situation by using all possible means; most importantly through Civil Disobedience Movement, then memes cultures, reference on Hong Kong Revolution, media attention and etc. I hope things work out right but we can‚Äôt tell our futures anymore. Even I or my friend might get detained by this midnight amidst unlawful military raids. We can‚Äôt let a blood bath like 1988 to happen again. These authoritarians will do whatever it takes to get the power and oppressed people mostly with the help Russia and China. It‚Äôs been ten days that i(we) couldn‚Äôt find what feels good. And I‚Äôm not sure we‚Äôll ever get it back again. I just wish the world study more about current Myanmar, the Military and tricky issues strategically created by the military dictators. And please help us get our freedom back; which would end decades long civil wars, aftermaths, and bring true democracy and federalism. I wish this comment is not going to be a farewell, Adriene and my FWFG fellas.<br />All the best! <br />may you be peaceful and may you never have to face cruel things like what the military is doing to its own people.<br /><br />Love from the other side of the world with so many uncertainties,<br />Namaste<br />K.<br /><br />(I dare not to post with my own youtube acc as I don‚Äôt know what will happen to us after)",Khin Bat,2021-02-11T01:03:50Z,0

"This might be an unpopular opinion, but I find myself getting frustrated when she stops mid-pose &amp; takes quite a bit of time to explain things.  Ruins the flow for me &amp; I often watch these videos in 1.25 or even 1.5 speed because of it.

"What kind of wizardry is this? I noted I started doing all of my moves synchronised with breath. I mean, I do it subconsciously and when you tell us to move with breath, I gracefully pay attention how I always do it by my own. The same way I always trust my ground and space and close my eyes even before you say so. This is something incredible. Even at the end, which is a new beginning, I noted I naturally breath slower and deeper than usual. This is the true magic of yoga that rejuvenates me from inside.",Clara Sirius,2021-02-10T16:47:45Z,0

Adriane&#39;s kindness and guidance really helps me to feel like myself and love myself more.. these practises helps me to think Im a worthy human being, so thank you so very much.",Eva R.,2021-02-09T10:41:11Z,0

"LOVE this practice. I&#39;m so grateful that you teach &quot;simple&quot; poses, because I&#39;ve learned how challenging they can be when I am focused on presence, awareness, engaging with my body IN THE MOMENT. Learned a lot of that from you. And just like my breath is an old friend, I believe that so are you, Adriene. Grateful for everything you offer this world. Grateful for what I&#39;ve learned from you so that I can keep on my own journey with self-love/respect/empathy. I breathe it in so I can breathe it out! Much love, and Namaste &lt;3",mstaffor1,2021-02-08T19:13:12Z,0

You are a great teacher! I really appreciated that lil wiggle you did during one of the last downward facing dogs, it allowed me to get in touch with my hips. And I needed the reminder.

"I hadn‚Äôt time for this practice yesterday, but as a senior yogi who made it through Breath, I felt I owed it to myself and even more to you Adriene for all your loving care to do this full class. I had to really breathe deep through this slow slow workout, building my strength and using my knee-down side planks to do all variations. Yay ! I made it through to that very welcome cool down and savasana, super yummy.

"I&#39;ve been following Yoga with Adriene for quite some time now, however not as consistent as I would want to be (sometimes I do it everyday for a month, then I don&#39;t do it for 2 months like a hiatus of sorts). But this is the first time that I cried in the middle of a yoga practice especially when she was motivating us by saying that &quot;you can do hard things, even in uncertain times&quot; <br /><br />I hope that anyone who decides to accept the challenge of this practice in any given day (whether it is something that you&#39;ve been doing consistently or something you did randomly) will know that more than physical strength, it takes so much willpower and mental strength to choose to love yourself most especially in uncertain times. <br /><br />Thank you for this, Adriene ‚ú®",Maria Aurea Victoria Panaligan,2021-02-08T08:03:33Z,0

As always the universe brought me the things I need most right when I need them. üíï This practice truly opened my heart and brought me to a good place. I was laying on my back in savana and my 8 month old australian shepherd came over and cuddled my right arm and licked my right hand. ü•≤ This caused me to feel a deep tenderness in my chest for his unconditional love. It was profound and brought me tears of gratitude for this perfect loving dog. Perspective changes everything. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thank you from all of my heart Adriene for this experience!

"I am so thankful that I discovered yoga in general and FWFG in particular. I spent 30 years of my life earning a living through grueling physical labor until I transitioned to a desk job after which I jumped into Crossfit which left me a bit battered and broken.

@Shannon Pitts being on the elbow is somehow worse and hurts even more than just trying the hand. I&#39;m not new to any of this though def not an expert either.

"Just meet yourself where you are, and you&#39;ll get stronger and be able to do more üòâ I had to start by doing a side plank from my elbow with my hand on the ground for stability (like an L).

"Thank you Adriene for this practice. I was a bit reticent given I started with a headache, but Adriene&#39;s manner allows room for us to notice we can still find what feels good even when we do not feel our best! And guess what, that Bunny (posture) took away most of my headache. Some of it tried to come back while on the Bridge but the supine twists apparently finished it because when I sat up to comment, it was no longer there. Took me over an hour as I had to stop about four times for short resting intervals but I did it. I thank our community, especially my Breath to Bridge family. Knowing all of you are out there is wonderful given that I do not have a live class and classmates to practice with these days. You provide great support and encouragement, particularly knowing some of your struggles. Not going to let a headache deprive me of the benefits of yoga.<br /><br />Hope everyone is enjoying this journey. üôèüíú<br /><br />Bridge Day 7!

"Excelent practice!!! In time, I found out that what feels good for me are the slow practices because they give me time to actually get comfortable in an uncomfortable posture, they give me time to really follow both my breath and my body and dive deeper into being aware of the link between breath and body. Also, I feel that when I allow myself to slow things down, a new kind of self care emerges from within. Thank you so much! Namaste! üôè",Cacu Cornelia,2021-02-07T12:55:15Z,0

This was a great practice. My only issue is I find it very uncomfortable on the knees for child&#39;s pose and other ones where I have my weight on my knees. Should I just &#39;cushion&#39; it more? Good practice though as I normally do the 15 min morning one,Ruby Rox,2021-02-07T09:18:24Z,1

"@Nikki F  Hi there! Yeah, I was weak. I fell like 50 times during this practice. It was great. Vulnerability is normal. It doesn‚Äôt classify me as ‚Äòweak‚Äô. It classifies me as human. The only thing poor here is you saying these hurtful comments. So please stop spreading these negative comments. We are all here to learn, grow and be ourselves. It takes a lot of courage for someone to come out and express a part of themselves to others. And you shouldn‚Äôt bring someone else down because of that. If you haven‚Äôt got anything nice to say, don‚Äôt say it at all. It hurts a lot of people.",Raphah Raysa,2021-02-09T09:44:33Z,1
