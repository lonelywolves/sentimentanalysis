"Hello friends! As someone who has had vocal surgery, twice, I really have drunk the kool-aide when it comes to the important awareness of this energetic center. Even if chakras are not your thing, maybe metaphor is. <br /><br /><br />What does it mean to know your own voice?",Yoga With Adriene,2019-11-10T14:20:25Z,400
"I’m in grad school for speech pathology, and I’m in my voice class. It’s SO important! Some people say that eyes are a window to your soul, but I think it’s your voice. Your voice always gives you away! Controlling your voice when you have intense emotions is so hard. Pay attention to that energy.",pdille22,2021-05-01T17:16:20Z,0

"I did this video a few days ago because I&#39;m at the begining of a new relationship and I wanted to make sure I&#39;ll be able to speak honestly and freely about my feelings and needs. Today, I sent a text to the person who sexually abused me a year ago to tell him how he hurt me but how I was recovering from it, and that I was hoping he could get some help and info about consent and communication because he needed it as much as me. I didn&#39;t plan on that even if I had somehow thought about it, it just felt like something I was finally able to do and needed to do. As expected he replied with something like &quot;lol k, delete my number&quot;, but I am so amazed and grateful by my own resilience and my new ability to speak my truth. I&#39;m convinced yoga has something to do with it (and therapy, and meditation, and good friends !), so I wanted to thank you Adriene and all this community for healing people and helping them walk through life.

"I&#39;ve been a subscriber for years, but never commented on a video, yet I feel like this one is worth commenting upon. I&#39;m an opera singer and often do little improvised series like this for myself to refresh after a lot of vocal use and/or when I&#39;m feeling off, either vocally or in the connection between my throat and the rest of my body. I feel like the muscular as well as energetic system of the throat is so overlooked, both in its complexity alone and the way it is affected by other parts of the body. For example, tension in shoulders and hands can pull on the throat muscles and diminish their freedom, and, tension in the ribcage or spine can make breathing much more effortful than necessary. There is also so much caught up in the idea of &quot;voice,&quot; our voices as vehicles for expression, as ways of encapsulating ourselves, and how that can so easily get manipulated, manufactured, or stifled by outside influences. In singing, this kind of external work doesn&#39;t MAKE a voice, but I think it helps create an environment in which a voice is allowed to flow uninhibited. I loved this practice and would be all for more videos catered to this important yet little thought about system of the body.

I have my granddaughter who is a runner, her mom, my sister and my youngest daughter all joining in.  Adriene you are Amazing!. My issue is I am just getting back to doing what I can after total left hip replacement just over a month ago.  I can do some yoga like the sitting parts of this one on a chair but not aloud on the floor yet. Has anyone had a hip replacement and give me some suggestions or inspiration  on getting back.

"Ridiculous KISMET today! Although I subscribe to the emails as well as the videos, I didn&#39;t experience either of them yesterday.<br />For the last few days, I&#39;ve been meaning to begin writing a play that has been kicking about in my head for the last week or so, but I suffer from the usual Writer&#39;s Problem of &#39;planning, but not doing&#39;. Today at work, I had a feeling in my throat like I was about to cry. It was completely tight in my throat, yet I wasn&#39;t feeling emotional. I realized that my throat chakra was getting jammed because even though writing isn&#39;t talking per se, its still &#39;saying something&#39;. And I was stopping myself from saying my something.<br />I got home, turned on youtube, and THIS VIDEO was the very FIRST suggestion.... and I was wearing blue workout pants and a blue hoodie too!!!<br />What glorious, random, serendipitous happenstance it was!!! So awesome 🤩🤩🤩<br /><br />Just wanted to share that, lol. Gonna go write now 😜👍",Chrissie M,2019-11-11T14:31:43Z,0

I particularly like the remark about the camel pose, as it is important to have the awareness of when we shouldn&#39;t go in for the poses totally. It&#39;s all part of our experience and connection with the body at that moment.

I am a professional opera singer/voice teacher with a recital coming up in the 22nd, and I&#39;m trying to get over a case of laryngitis after a bad chest cold. Now, obviously I don&#39;t know if this practice would actually aid in that, but it made me feel more powerful and centered, relieving some of the stress surrounding the situation. Additionally, I am going through a break up as we speak and in the process of emergency moving out my stuff, so I&#39;ve been really stressed. Just the other day I was looking around on your channel for a throat practice, and you delivered. Thank you, truly &lt;3",Kristen Keymont,2019-11-11T07:52:29Z,0
"First thing: This was spot on exactly what I needed right now, as always. Thank you thank you thank you. 💙<br /><br />Second thing: I love that you are always acknowledging that certain things in yoga can feel awkward or silly or scary and that’s okay. I’m someone who is a definite “woo woo weirdo,” but I know speaking in pure Woowooweird-inese can be really off-putting for people who are brand new to it. The online yoga community is so fortunate to have you. You already know this, but you are making such an enormous difference in so many lives and making yoga so much more approachable.

"As someone who has nerve damage that makes it difficult to swallow food literally every time I eat, any focus on the throat is so important to me. What was most special about this experience was that it made me feel seen. My issue is so rare that it often feels like people don&#39;t even consider or understand that the throat can be such a complicated area with problems of its own (and that&#39;s why it takes me an hour to eat a meal that for others, it takes 15 minutes). This video is a huge gift in that it pays attention to a unique, important, and misunderstood area of the body. Thank you Adriene!",fiightforme,2019-11-11T04:42:43Z,220

"@Jack Meovf yes Jack, that sounds exactly like a lot of my issues including the sinus and jaw pain. Do you find yourself realizing how much you are clenching your jaw or holding your shoulders either forward, up around your ears or both? And it does usually come and go but it’s been chronic lately. Even some of the yoga is painful in my neck/throat. I started noticing that a few months ago so I now try and not push those poses. I don’t want to quit yoga!

This is totally me. I’ve had agoraphobia for most of my adult life. My throat is my most sensitive area and choking has always been a fear of mine. I can’t swallow pills and chew my food so much before swallowing. I have that lump now again. 10 months of COVID inundation and concerns over my work etc have made my anxiety go crazy. I do take something. I had to or I would never have been able to have a typical life. However with that help I still struggle and really have lately. I’m so glad I found Adriene. Every single day since March I’ve returned to the mat no matter how I’ve felt. Thank you 🙏🏼,Denise Tessman,2020-12-30T01:06:23Z,0

"&quot;The throat chakra is the energetic center that connects your earthly grounded delights with your higher self.&quot; Today, more than ever before I understand my Hashimoto disorder, as well as other issues that have gone and those that are still present. Listen to the inner voice, take responsibility for a meaningful life, trust, to understand light and dark side and accept it - I discovered these truths as core values that hold my mind and body...

YES! I&#39;ve been needing this so bad and been focusing on my throat the past two days. I swear you pull your videos right out of me.,charlelesV,2019-11-10T06:23:35Z,11
"Phew. Just in time to help my sore throat get of the troubling pain it is in due to the cold I recently caught due to changing climates. Time to have some lovely lone time with myself and my body after finishing an intense morning HIIT workout on this frigid Sunday morning. Boy this is gonna be another lovely one. Can&#39;t wait to try it. Thank you, Adriene for helping me realize that I am loved as I am and I should be in love with myself as I seek love in the environment around me. Life is too short to be sad about small things everyone. Let&#39;s do this. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-11-10T06:21:59Z,3
