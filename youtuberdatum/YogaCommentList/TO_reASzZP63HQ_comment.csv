"It was nice to hear someone say ‚ÄúI got your back‚Äù this evening especially when I didn‚Äôt feel that from others, I was starting to feel alone and not supported with where I‚Äôm currently at in my life so I decided to get on my mat.

"Adriene&#39;s inspiring videos have been my daily yoga practice for quite a while now. So when I got home from an upsetting encounter with my estranged brother yesterday, I knew where to turn to help me regain my sense of stability and strength: breathing, meditation and, of course, one of Adriene&#39;s compassionate videos. I typed &quot;pain&quot; in the search box and found this wonderful lesson. Thanks so much darling Adriene for your endless generosity. Namaste from Tel Aviv",dudidas4,2021-05-09T06:05:30Z,0

"we had to put my family dog down a few days ago, and overwhelmed by grief and emotion i haven&#39;t been able to move much or really do anything. this yoga practice was so relieving i felt sad when it ended. tears fell during the practice but i now realize that it&#39;s okay to cry and to let go and to suffer. thank you for making me feel whole in this awful time, sending much love your way and to everyone who may read this &lt;3",Maud Brummans,2021-05-06T14:37:43Z,0
"I&#39;ve been struggling with how I see myself lately. People saying that my suffering is an identity I&#39;m holding on to - and that has made me angry and insecure to my core.<br /><br />We suffer every day but try our best to care for ourselves, only to be told that we love our own suffering. <br /><br />No one has the right to trample over the ground of your life, tearing out the grass with their rude shoes and planting their flag in your soil. They don&#39;t know what you go through every day. You can listen to your pain. It is yours. We have turned away from it too long. It&#39;s time we heard it.",Kirstin C,2021-05-01T05:30:08Z,1

I ended up crying from frustration and am going to go do the yoga for depression or grief one, but I wanted to love this one. On a day when I&#39;m not suffering, this probably would have been great! Maybe it speaks more to what&#39;s going on beneath my suffering, but this wasn&#39;t it for me today.",Jae Henricksen,2021-02-04T19:04:29Z,0
I had to let someone go today. We haven&#39;t known eachother for long. But shared a deep intimacy. One of protection and nurturing. She was outside without boots in the middle of winter. I took her to a hotel to warm up. I held her in my arms. She was shivering for hours. I did not sleep. But I stayed with her. My heart energy warming her. The next morning I arranged for her to get proper warm clothes. She carried on as if nothing happened. I blocked her messages because seeing her destroy herself was hurting me. I let her go... now I am saddened. But this yoga practice helped immensely. Namaste üëê,Kinetic MC,2021-01-29T00:16:23Z,0

My dog was really a part of our family and even though we have another dog the house still feels empty. I know someone else going through these comments deals with the same thing.

"I just love how well you explain the purpose of a pose and what we should be doing.<br />I had a very good teacher who was very keen on telling us those details and it&#39;s helped for my solo journey, but I&#39;d rather follow along than do yoga solo. But, I found it hard to find an instructor online I could really trust while doing yoga.  Some instructors brute through the poses, or maybe assume their audience already know&#39;s whats expected.  Anyway.  <br />Even if a student knows what to do in a pose, during the session when it&#39;s hard, or when they get focused on their breath, it&#39;s always great to have a guiding voice to remind them what the purpose is and aim towards that even more.<br />You&#39;re a teacher with exactly what I need, so I thank you so much.<br />And I really really love this gentle vibes practice that is a little more active than most calming sessions.<br />If any of that made sense hahahah",Candace Farrell,2020-04-15T15:57:48Z,2

What you said at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reASzZP63HQ&amp;t=5m44s"">5:44</a> and ending with &quot;I got your back (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reASzZP63HQ&amp;t=6m03s"">6:03</a>) helped me release some tears and emotions. Being brought up as a male in US culture was not a kind mindset for encouraging self-care or gentleness in my experience. This is a big way to help guide me in that direction and let go. Namaste :)<br /><br /><br /><br />Edit: I also want to be honest that I‚Äôm in pain daily with my lower back to my foot on my left side. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs sciatica, a hip imbalance, or something else. Yoga seems to provide temporary relief. Maybe with consistency, PT, acupuncture, chiropractor, and more I can have physically pain free days again. It‚Äôd be a gift. <br /><br /><br />I just found out you were in the movie Joe, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

"Last week I was on vacation and didn&#39;t get a chance to do this video. I am thirteen years old and I have been doing yoga with adriene everyday for a year now to help ease my anxiety and I love it. But last night, I was on a vacation somewhere else and I couldn&#39;t fall asleep and this may sound a bit silly, but I was having a panic attack and crying and I couldn&#39;t stop. I decided to turn on this video, at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reASzZP63HQ&amp;t=12m00s"">12:00</a> at night, and I laid in bed watching it and it calmed me down completely.

"-Hello Adriene! I hope you get the opportunity to see this comment, as I know it will be difficult for you to read them all. You have been my teacher now for more than two years! Through this whole journey you&#39;ve seen me go through some of my lowest points and helped me through them. I owe so much of my health and happiness to you and your channel. I wanted to reach out to you to thank you for all that you do for people. To provide us this channel for free and use all that you make to continue to give is just remarkable.<br />-However, through this entire time there has been one thing I wish I could tell you. I am &quot;double jointed&quot; meaning my joints are so flexible they can come somewhat out of socket in my normal range of motion. I experience this throughout my entire body. Sometimes it is a huge advantage for yoga and other exercise, but most of the time it is quite painful and is a hinderance. I just paused your video now as my shoulders and elbows began to come out and pinch my nerves. I modify your moves for myself but I&#39;m not the greatest at it as I do not know anatomy as well as a yoga teacher does. I would so greatly appreciate if you could take the time to learn more about what it&#39;s like for people like me and work on modifications to common poses so we can get the most out of these moves. I just know I&#39;m missing out on all the benefits your videos have to offer. <br />-To anyone else reading this would you be so kind as to like this comment so there is a greater chance of Adriene seeing it? This means a great deal to me and has for a long time, and there may be others watching this that feel the same.",Gaje Dayringer,2019-07-17T18:44:00Z,0

Somewhere halfway through, the &#39;magic of yoga&#39; had me in the throes of release, tears coming down, breathing deeply to meet them. What a profound magic. I have always known yoga to be this magical unfolding, but it is tricky for me to find teachers I trust to go there with. This teacher is kind and loving, and home is (finally) the safest zone.

"This month marks the third year I have been doing yoga ‚Äì almost every day I have been greeted by Adriene&#39;s welcoming smile as I stepped on my yoga mat.<br /><br />I am now in my mid-twenties. For me, yoga started as a simple workout practice of shaking during downward dogs and falling out of tree poses, then eventually turned into a habit, and finally evolved into a ritual of self-care and checking in. <br /><br /><br />I never expected a yoga practice through youtube to be so involving and inviting. Looking back on these three years, I realize that Adriene played a significant role in some of the biggest events in my life so far. Through these videos, Adriene motivated me 2 hours before I nervously defended my thesis. She reminded me to have my own back when I suffered from my first heartbreak. She was also there when I met and embraced my first true love ‚Äì my loving boyfriend who has become one of the most beautiful parts of my life right now. Since last year, Adriene is also there while I grief the unexpected passing of my father. As tension frequently builds in my hips, my shoulders, my neck, I still make sure to show up on my mat. <br /><br />And thanks to you, Adriene, I no longer see grief and suffering as emotions that must be fought or hidden. Rather, you have given me the tools to approach these emotions without judgement. After all, how could I ever find peace in these dark places if I am not willing to shed a light onto them? Though I love how yoga has brought me physical flexibility and release, I cannot thank you enough for helping me to allow grief, however difficult it still is, to become a part of my emotional reality. <br /><br />Throughout these years, your presence has brought me so much physically, mentally, emotionally and maybe even spiritually ‚Äì though that is a journey I have not quite yet embarked on.

"This is the best practice yet! Perhaps I am uniquely sensitive as I have been bouncing around your timeline, Adriene‚Äîyesterday I used a video that was more than a few years old and today get treated to something recorded within the last few days. Your growth and development as a teacher shines brightly. I kept pace with you, you stayed focused, I was present for your words, your teachings, and got so much from today. We all suffer from something, a part of the human experience. But this practice helps to redefine how we respond to that injustice of suffering and in doing so, moves us one little step closer to enlightenment, or at least freedom from suffering.

I think a kink in the armor that is mindfulness and its current wave is that to wears off quicker than the inward focus. Like our society is to quick to return to an outwear view as a source of suffering and look at others to be mindful of them instead. It&#39;s a practice not really a cure.,eric wade,2019-07-14T17:38:30Z,0
"A part of knowing mindfulness is understanding that others don&#39;t have the same linking knowledge. It would be presumptuous to expect mindfulness of others, for they don&#39;t share a common timeline or inner wisdom.",eric wade,2019-07-14T18:16:48Z,0

"Hey Adriene..Love your videos. Your yoga exercises really work for me. The video,  yoga for stress and anxiety, that you uploaded, really helped me feel calm and relaxed.",Pratichee Bhuyan,2019-07-14T05:11:29Z,14
"I don&#39;t know what it is but everytime I get the notification for a new practice from Adriene, a big, bright, ear to ear smile sits on my face, automatically eliminating any negativity in a matter of an instant. I guess such spells of wonder do exist outside of the Harry Potter wizardry world. They feel so much better in the real world in my opinion. I&#39;ve started a challenge to tend to myself and go deep inside more often, of course, disconnecting from the professional world as a part of my night routine. And obviously, Adriene&#39;s yoga videos are a pivotal component of that night routine. Thank you Adriene for inviting us to the world of self love and  transforming our lives for the better through the work you do. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-07-14T05:10:25Z,17
