Wow... this should feel good. Nope. Nerve tension completely aggravated :( Lots of breathing through finding what did not feel good at all or just completely impossible at this moment.

"the most challenging practices for me at these monthly calendars are the shorter ones, those which are only 5-15 min long. they are &#39;&#39;easy&#39;&#39; to do and the temptation to miss them is one of the strongest. <br /><br />this month i am doing them all without missing a single one, can you imagine? and i am so proud of myself. when i do an 50 min practice i feel okay, but when it&#39;s only a 5 or 11 min and i feel like a winner. maybe it&#39;s cuz i am! as Adriene always says, a little goes a long way.",Nan Potrer,2021-02-26T01:02:16Z,3

"Bridge Day 25: In the past I wouldn&#39;t have been interested in a session focused on hands, but a few months ago I developed a condition called trigger thumb, which led to an inability to bend my thumb. It has been treated and has mostly been resolved. Anyway, I now no longer take my fingers for granted.  I think it is human nature to not really appreciate the complexity of our bodies until something goes wrong.  Adriene, thank you for guiding us in giving love to these precious joints!

"My name is Yoshikage Kira. I&#39;m 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don&#39;t smoke, but I occasionally drink. I&#39;m in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I&#39;m trying to explain that I&#39;m a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness.

"Hello! I found this video after starting Adriene&#39;s 2020 &quot;Home&quot; series. I used to do yoga regularly, but I have arthritis in my wrist. Any type of downward pressure causes pain, so planks/tabletop/dogward dog are really hard for me. I love yoga and don&#39;t want my wrist to be what holds me back from practice. Any advice?

I have a hip injury hence I can&#39;t do a lot of yoga because my hip flexor has to be relaxed. I&#39;d love to do the June Courage practices as in the calendar but right now I need to rest my hip flexor. However I&#39;m not ending the showing up for daily yoga so chair yoga it is! This practice is certainly good for me because I play the guitar. My hands get to take advantage of this time and yoga really helps me with attitude as well - I&#39;m not freaking out about this but grateful for being in a very privileged position overall🙏🏻😁,Helmi Järvinen,2020-06-07T16:36:00Z,0

"I like this but I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m stretching the back of my dominant hand enough. I&#39;ve been having increasing stiffness in the back of my dominant hand since I started a trimming job. So I&#39;m using my hand in a constant motion all day. What would you suggest to relax the stiffness/ pain in the muscles/ tendons in my hand? I am slightly concerned for the development of issues later on as my mom developed a cyst on the back of her right hand and performed self surgery to remove it. (yikes) I&#39;d love to not ever get to that point, &amp; I&#39;d appreciate any suggestions/ a video for trimmers/ people who are constantly using scissors.

"I started following you early in 2018 to help me create a habit and a self care practice as I was preparing to become a registered massage therapist. I have been practicing since August 2018, and your yoga practice has helped me adjust to the new body aches and pains I feel all over. This practice in particular was fantastic for targeting my fatigued forearms and sore wrists. Other practices I have found helpful as an RMT are all the ones focused on the upper back, neck and shoulders. I appreciate you, I love the work you do. Thank you.

"This is relaxing.  I&#39;m quite a bit older than you (I&#39;m guessing!) and I learned over the years that my wrists, or rather their condition, is very closely connected to shoulder and neck issues.  So wouldn&#39;t it make sense to also focus on correcting problems in shoulder and neck area?  I have a very very bad habit of sticking my neck out, as well as hunching up.  Maybe some exercises for these areas?  Sorry, I&#39;m new here, if you&#39;ve already posted shoulder/neck exercises, please disregard!  Thank you.",Beth Heinecamp,2019-02-09T15:44:47Z,0

I&#39;m reminding myself to be gentle, to find what feels good, and that taking it easy is what my body needs right now... they&#39;ll be plenty of time to ramp things up once I&#39;m feeling healthier again.",Leanne Anderson,2019-02-04T01:16:43Z,0

"Hey Adriene, I was wondering if you could do a mini yoga series aimed at fixing knee, hip, ankle alignment. I love doing yoga, but it can be hard at times since my joints don&#39;t align as they should. A series like this would not only help a lot of people perform the poses better, but also increase their self-confidence/body image! Keep up the good work!",Patrick Keehan,2019-02-03T14:48:12Z,120
"This is very anecdotal, so handle with care, but a few years ago I started to suffer pain in my left knee and left big toe. The two seemed to be related. At the same time, I was starting to get chronic-seeming pains in other parts of my feet too. A doctor told me the knee pain was just the normal wear and tear of age and there was nothing to be done (I was in my mid-40s). I did a mindfulness exercise focusing on my feet and realised that my seemingly comfortable sneakers were pinching my pinky toes and that this was actually normal for me and had been for years. I went looking for wider shoes and found my way to barefoot shoes. With my first pair, all my foot pain went away in a couple of weeks. A few years later, I got a yet wider pair of barefoot shoes that really left my pinky toes unconstricted and also started massaging the muscle near my left pinky toe. At this point, my knee pain went away too. As Adriene says, it&#39;s all connected.",John Moseley,2021-02-27T21:41:44Z,0

"I have patellofemoral syndrome (affects my knees, thighs, and hips). I get a lot of pain and need to strengthen my muscles and practice alignment so my kneecaps and hips and everything can be trained to stay aligned. This would totally be great because sometimes they can really hurt for a few days after doing warrior and lunge type poses.",Melanie H,2019-06-07T04:52:56Z,3

Question for you though: I find that sitting up straight for long periods of time really hurts my middle-upper back? I did all 30 Days of Dedicate and felt it throughout that, and felt it really badly today. Is it possible I’m doing something wrong? Or is this my back telling me to sit at a desk less? 😂",Gabby DaRienzo,2019-02-03T13:25:15Z,0

"I have been having hand pain all day. I even had to take off my engagement ring because it just irritated my knuckle, then this video just popped up on my feed. It was just what I needed. Thank you 🙏",Mikey4Geelove,2019-02-03T07:16:48Z,0
"I just read your email! So excited for this month&#39;s theme, I was just thinking today how I need to care more for myself. Funny how you videos always give me what I need!<br /><br />I have very severe treatment resistant depression. My first episode robbed me of my ability to love and care for myself. I&#39;m in another episode, but this time I&#39;m doing yoga everyday and working on improving how I treat myself. I know now that I am so strong and deserving of feeling good. Thank you Adriene for providing these yoga videos and teaching me how to love myself again.",Rebecca Keller,2019-02-03T07:16:33Z,0

This is super helpful for giving focus (especially on the breath) to warming up my hands (and whole self) for playing violin. :),Cassie Harrison,2019-02-03T06:39:16Z,2
Thank you SO much for this! You must have heard my hands screaming 🙈 I do a lot of skin treatments and my hands and wrists haven&#39;t been keeping up with me lately. I appreciate this video more than you know ❌⭕️❌⭕️,LolaGlow,2019-02-03T06:36:31Z,2
this was perfect but i was very confused when you said “before we come onto all fours” because we clearly didn’t do that! and i’m glad because i was doing it in bed. 😂,lexicaljewel,2019-02-03T06:33:55Z,541

"That was great!. Question? When doing down dog posture, is it ok to slightly &quot;cup&quot; the hands? When I flatten my fingers and palm totally flat onto the mat it seems to create bad wrist pressure. Thanks.",Jeff A.,2019-02-03T12:12:09Z,3
