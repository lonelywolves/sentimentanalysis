"Hey Adriene ! I just wanted to share some feedback with you! I absolutely adore your work and I am stunned by how good of a teacher you are! I&#39;ve been doing your training for over 2 years now and they changed my life! Yoga helped me with so many things I can&#39;t even begin to describe! I l no longer experience such awful back pain, I have a hobby that I am so passionate about and it helps me quiet my mind. Because of the pandemic, I cannot go to yoga classes so home yoga is a great option and your amazing work is what I am so grateful for! Thank you for everything that you do and for sharing your knowledge with us and for helping us understand yoga. Lots of love!",Julia,2021-04-19T11:40:42Z,1

Maybe I&#39;ll do two sets in full plank, maybe I&#39;ll still only do one, or maybe I&#39;ll do all half plank.

I don’t think he likes Zumba 😂 Thank you for all that you do. I am extremely grateful for you. You have been a blessing to my life during this pandemic.

"I jumped ahead on the calendar because I needed a quick practice. WOW! I&#39;m sweaty and triumphant!<br /><br />Adriene, I swear only two months ago I would crash to the ground when lowering from a full plank, but I&#39;ve watched that get little by little stronger, first through 30 Days at Home and then from following the YWA calendar. Started this video in full planks, had to switch to half-plank to find that yummy &quot;edge&quot;; it felt like when I used to lift weights and would find that awesome zone. I was scared to go back to full plank, but I kept up with about 80% of the arm taps! And then was amazed I could pull off the side planks with arm lifted!<br /><br />Thank you for teaching me to laugh and smile when I wobble or have to stop for a breath.

"So i was looking for a yoga practice to help increase my core and arm strength and this feels very promising. I admit, during the shoulder touching excersize, i collapsed for a second(guess ive let my arms get too out of shape :/) but then you said one more minute and I pushed myself so hard. I deeply enjoyed at the end, drawing in breath and letting it out and feeling the energy in my body, feeling the heat in my core and arms, i feel lighter almost and yet weighed down at the same time, its hard to explain. I will probably attempt this everyday or every two days and rejoice the day that i can keep up and actually do full planks without my knees. Thank you for this wonderful video and also your words of encouragement as you go along, I don&#39;t think I could have continued on with  touching my opposite shoulders if you didn&#39;t say one more minute. Also, that one form of child&#39;s pose with the widened knees, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had such a wonderful deep breath, I will be definitely be adding that to my normal routine. Thank you once again.",Kat S.,2020-08-25T02:23:23Z,0
"Really loving all these more focused videos. Definitely feel the fire - i can do the 13 mins on my knees - will start trying one or two in full plank. Technical question - found myself wondering where to focus my attention in my hands as i push back up, especially in the elbows at 90&#39;. Realise that more weight is on the outer hands / pinkie and ring finger. Wondering would it bring more balance to my shoulders if i focus on thumb and forefinger?",Siobhan Power,2020-08-24T20:29:15Z,0

Honestly bitter at PE teachers that made me do full push ups even though i was super struggling and my back and arms and wrists hurt like a bitch because of poor core and arm strength instead of teaching how to gradually build it up. I hated it all to the point of never working on my arms cause i thought i was too weak to even bother. 10 minutes of those half push ups made me undertand how to do push ups properly better than all of school classes,berry,2020-08-12T08:38:05Z,1
"Same, i actually dont think i ever made my neck long and looked forward during school pe, i always hunched my head forward with poor posture because no one ever corrected me.

Does anyone else have wrist problems? Especially when I&#39;m doing the 90 degrees I hear some crackling and it feels uncomfortable (not necessarily painful) and I feel like it&#39;s compromising my form. Any tips?,Sukran Bahar Sener,2020-07-08T00:51:23Z,0
"Just followed this sequence for the very first time. By the end of it I felt both exhausted and exhilarated. Especially during the portion I was touching my hands to my shoulders in full plank. Also, I did a side plank for the first time in my whole life, and I had no idea I was able to do that.

first of all thank you i love taking your classes! i thought the class demanded exactly the right amount of effort. i couldnt do it all what allowed me to get to my edge and learn to do what i can for myself. but i thought that it was miissing transitions  like i think that sun sanitations maybe with long planks and other additions would have make it fill more like yoga and less like a work out at the jim. but again thank you so much i love your classes! sorry for the english  mistakes.

"I&#39;ve been doing yoga for last 2 years on and off with yoga with aidrene. And it has changed my life in ways I never thought was possible. When I went from high school to university in the first year I gained a hell lot of insecurities, weight and lost self confidence completely and then when I found you. No kidding I literally found you when I needed yoga the most in my life. I was never a big yoga lover but since I found you I&#39;ve fallen in love with yoga. It took loads of time and effort but finally I feel like I&#39;m on the right path of finding my true self. I gain way more confidence that I ever thought I could have, still working on my insecurities but I will reach there soon. I lost a lot of weight and also started making healthier choices in food which was so unlike me before. I am calmer and more optimistic than I ever was and finally after all this time I feel like my life is falling into place. There are still ups and downs but I&#39;m stronger than ever and I know I can get through it. <br />I&#39;ve been doing daily yoga in this quarantine and built so much strength in my body. No matter what I haven&#39;t skipped a day because I know yoga is my safe place, it makes me feel happier and so much better. All the changes that I&#39;ve mentioned before took almost 2 years to take action but it&#39;s all worth it. <br />What made me think about all of this was the fact that I was never strong in my arms, like never. I never could do push-ups at all and Today I did this practice completely without taking a break and in full plank that is an achievement in my diary. <br />Thank you so much Adriene for being you and for transforming so many people&#39;s lives including mine. <br />Also I never comment on videos but I just had to you&#39;re literally incredible you are the biggest reason for me finally being on my path of finding my authentic self and finally loving myself for who I&#39;m. ❤️",Dipkona Roy,2020-06-11T05:26:07Z,36
"Well Dipkona Roy, you deserve praise! What a journey you have undertaken. There have been times I felt overwhelmed and while I’ve always been reasonably fit, I didn’t realise the power of regular yoga. So now, combined with regular walking, admiring the outdoors, and Yoga With Adriene,  I feel stronger and I wake up every day excited about what Adriene has on offer that will suit my day. ......Those push ups were something else weren’t they?

What advice do you have for alleviating the pressure on wrists during this? I was able to start off okay but toward the end my wrists just hurt so much. I tried to ground through my fingertips more to try and get that weight off but it didn&#39;t do much. Maybe I just need more practice.,Grace Judd,2020-04-15T16:14:49Z,0

"I started doing this everyday for the past 3 days, and the first time i couldnt even hold the side plank at all.  Today i was actually able to hold it for a few seconds already.  Its hard and easy at the same time, I love it. I would never do pushups for fun on my own but this video encourages me everytime to do it till the end. The goal is to be able to do it in the acual plank position in the end and not the half plank. Also the very last round always kills me.",invullnerablee,2020-04-14T10:20:02Z,3

"I play on a womens rugby team where our practices are 2 hours in length 2xs a week plus games on weekends. 15s season games are 80 minutes long and I know for a fact this video, that&#39;s not even 15 minutes in length, has helped me out tremendously. This was the first video I ever found and let me just say that I follow along at least 3 times a week to it. It has definitely helped me build the muscle strength I needed to push myself off the ground constantly. I&#39;m currently to the point where I follow along to the entire video in a full plank position, which is kind of crazy because when I first started following your videos I could barely do this entire video without stopping once or twice and that was following along in a half plank. I just really wanted to say thank you for posting all your videos because I can&#39;t begin to tell you how much this series and then your videos for anxiety and stress have helped me.",Carrie Price,2019-10-01T11:53:11Z,1

Can you do special yoga exercises for pregnant women?,Mariam Assi,2019-09-10T07:08:15Z,0
"Hi Mariam! We have a Prenatal Yoga For All Trimesters in the FWFG Membership - <a href=""https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/"">https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/</a> and in our shop - <a href=""https://do.yogawithadriene.com/prenatal-yoga"">https://do.yogawithadriene.com/prenatal-yoga</a>. <br />In general, most women are able to continue a regular practice through month eight if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. As always, consult your doctor/physician before starting and follow their advice. xx",Yoga With Adriene,2019-09-10T12:47:41Z,0

I haven&#39;t got this at all, I collapse and watch the video thinking “will she do something else now?” No, just more push ups. I’ll try plank for a bit instead, I can just manage that for a short time. “Oh wait....what’s this now?” Lift one hand to chest, place it back, then do the same the other side “How on earth!” Oh my goodness I am so rubbish!

Does anyone else feel this in their elbows? Wrists don&#39;t really bother me but my elbows aren&#39;t too happy 😥,Simple Happy Zen,2019-09-08T16:45:41Z,1
Have been doing weights along with yoga for a few months now. I got to experience the increase in upper body strength today as I use to struggle coming down half way during planks. My elbows would also get sore as I did not have the muscle strength and was putting strain on my tendons. I love Adriene&#39;s rests after we exerting ourselves and it is something I try to incorporate in weight training as I find it is a lot more punishing. I need that rejuvenating between sets. Also love how this is short. Is a good one for when I need an energy boost that is not too extensive and draining.,Terence,2019-09-08T16:40:17Z,0

This wasn&#39;t fun for me by any stretch of the imagination, but your constant reassurances that half-plank is OK and not a cop-out made it <b>possible</b> (no way could I have done all that in full plank), so now I know that there&#39;s an upper body workout that I can do without feeling like a big clumsy oaf.

But today Adriene placed the hands near the edges of the mat and just differentiated where the elbows go for the two cycles of pushups.

"You know something, any little effort or practice for your own mental health is good. I have been doing yoga with adriene for about a month now. I have built up some upper body strength over my time of slowly pushing myself. My point is, trust me, it&#39;s frustrating in the beginning but day by day, the more you try and practice the better you get at it. I am so happy that you tried. Do not give up, keep pushing girl, you got this!",Maira Saeed,2020-08-02T17:09:44Z,0
