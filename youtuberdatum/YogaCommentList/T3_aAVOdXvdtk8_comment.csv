I am so happy that i started this journey in the middle of the year. I tried at the beginning but was way too depressed to even get out of my bed somedays. Now that i am feeling better this yoga practices help me to get through my days and not to fall into this low again (hopefully). I just want to say how thankful i am for the opportunity of doing that &quot;with&quot; you Adriene. Thank you and the community for making my days better &lt;3,Luna Jarosch,2021-05-06T09:59:49Z,0

"This was great but more of a core workout session than a relaxing yoga session! Also, I would have appreciated some alternatives as these exercises are only safe when you can control your lower back, when it lifts up it is not good for your back - I have an issue with that so did not know what to do half of the workout.

Adriene&#39;s burn asanas are some of the best exercises for actual real burn especially abs. Been to gyms and worked my ass of under trainers but none of them could actually help with the real deal. This is faabamazing. I save every one of your core burn videos so that I can come back later. Doing them all slowly is what causes the burn. I almost scream out but they feel so good. You know it&#39;s working or will work cz of the slow fiery burn. It&#39;s difficult as hell but oh-so-good. Thank you Adriene! ♥️,Diana,2021-04-05T02:29:40Z,1

Also remember to listen to your body and not do anything that doesn&#39;t feel good! I think for me I&#39;ll incorporate the breath of fire on a daily basis since I tend to be tired all the time.

I new type of breathing and crazy exercises where the biggest struggle was to understand which leg and arm goes where... up... down... oh, wait, it is to the side... well it is actually the other leg... and I should reach up with my arm... now touch the knee... whatever. My neck was constantly turned towards the screen, by the time I understood she is doing she was off to a new movement. And then I realized my flexibility is not even close to do most of these.

Me too! I&#39;ve had lower back pain for years and poses like low boat can cause pain especially if your core abs are weak.

it was hard and I skipped a few repeats but the WORST thing was practicing that fire breath at the beginning. It annoyed me so much I was thinking about quitting. It’s nice to use during exercises but alone it makes me very uncomfortable and annoyed by the sound and feelings in my stomach - I feel like vomiting. I won’t stop this challenge because it’s incredible but I wanted to share (or rather vent a little haha).

"In general, I love your videos, but today&#39;s practice made me insanely angry and sad. Actually, it made me cry. Not because I could not do the exercises, quite the opposite: I did them without any difficulty, and yet, my belly is still round. Today&#39;s practice reminded me that despite my strong abs, and my efforts, I cannot get to flatten that belly. It was an unwelcome reminder. That is not why I came for and really, it made me feel bad.<br />I know I should be grateful for the free practices and I am.

Ooof. That was hard. But I came back every time I was asked to finish the set. So there&#39;s that.

Can anybody help? I know I am supposed to accept my body and only do what I can do, we are all at different places yada yada yada but I’m also supposed to accept how I feel, and how I feel is that I’m gonna cry.

"Totally valid feelings! I used to feel like that too, like why can&#39;t I do what everyone else seems to be able to do? But then I remember that not everyone can. Adriene is so experienced and has had years of practice which is why she can do what she does. I find it comforting to know that I&#39;m giving my body what it needs and not pushing it to perform too far. There&#39;s a difference between pushing yourself in healthy and unhealthy ways. So I just come back to the realization that not everyone is going to be at the same level, accepting my body for where it&#39;s at, and knowing that if I continue my practice, I too will one day be able to do what Adriene does. Hope that helped. Sending you all the light and love to continue your journey 💕",Jas K,2021-01-26T00:42:42Z,2

"Hey Denise, sounds like you did great, listening to your body and slowing your breath down.  I&#39;ve had that problem.  We get &quot;woozy&quot; when we hyperventilate, which means we&#39;re exhaling more than we inhale.  There are many reasons why we may not be able to inhale as well as exhale.  I have a physical issue, but it can be as simple as just needing to practice.  You were able to get an even inhale and exhale when you slowed it down, so that&#39;s great!  You may  be able to speed up more as you practice more.  All the best!",Deb,2021-01-16T03:45:58Z,0

I am a little behind - but find I miss the practice and feel so good once I have completed it. Todays burn was definitely a burn - most difficult - took pause . loved Adriene&#39;s comforting if you took a break come on back :) I needed today to get rid of negative energy - found myself crying at the ends guess it worked - letting go.,CATHERINE ALLAWAY,2021-01-13T23:27:06Z,0

"Thank you day 6!  I was struggling with the fire breath a bit, felt like I was running out of air.

"If there&#39;s one thing I have learned through my yoga teacher training it&#39;s balance. In my opinion, this practice was not balancing at all. There should have been more back strengtheners and hip openers, and all around more of a practice. You can burn other places than just your abs.",Tyrus Reidt,2021-01-13T16:26:12Z,0
"@JoyKirsten  I get where you are coming from also, but it can be unhealthy for the body to not be balanced in every class. It doesn&#39;t have to be a full-body class or workout at all. You can totally focus on your abs, but in order to maintain balance and a healthy body, you need to strengthen and stretch opposing muscles. Think about what happens to the body when you do just situps. Your abs get tight. If you don&#39;t also make your back tight, your abs are going to be pulling you forward and stretching your back out. Something to think about.",Tyrus Reidt,2021-01-14T01:19:50Z,0
"I get what you&#39;re saying, although i don&#39;t fully agree. Especially in a 30-day continously, i don&#39;t mind to put extra effort on a focus place in the body one day. If everyday would feel like a &quot;fullbody workout&quot; it will make it so much harder to get through it. The balance is in the 30 days for me😊",JoyKirsten,2021-01-13T21:26:33Z,0

"When I store stress in my body (which nowadays is nearly always), my chest and shoulders get so tight that I feel like the tops of my lungs are somehow constricted. So I can only breathe in for what feels like 80%, and then I&#39;m stuck. Most of the time if I wait at the top of my inbreath, more space will become available. So I have like a two or even three stage inhale.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know if this is what might be causing your issue... But I thought I&#39;d share. And so far, I don&#39;t really have a good solution, other than finding ways to take care of the built up stress... so therapy, yoga, mindfulness, etc. But none of these are quick fixes, and some might even make it worse (if you get anxious while meditating because you can&#39;t breathe, for example). So far my approach has been to try and notice it&#39;s not always the same - some days are better than others, so I try to appreciate that - and to breathe where I can. That means seeing if I can find some space in my belly or the back or sides of my back.",Lian Beijers,2021-03-03T07:25:15Z,1

"I&#39;m on day 10 but came back to this to do an extra burn today. Whaaat? It&#39;s the second year I&#39;ve done this challenge and I&#39;m really feeling the benefits of doing it every day. Considering it&#39;s my main wellbeing and exercise during lockdown, I&#39;d like to make a donation but can&#39;t see anything on the website.

"Wow. I felt the burn very intensely in this practice and it was so needed. Thank you Adriene! When I first started my home practice a couple years ago it was as a part of your 30 day yoga journey. Since then I have been in and out of maintaining a regular yoga practice and when I felt ready to commit again I found this Breath series. I started a few days late however the timing was actually so Divine as I am currently on a deep inner journey of transformation and letting go, practicing the embodiment of the highest expression of the fire element. Also it&#39;s 1/11/2021 today which is very high vibrational and a strong energy for transformation and manifestation which made this Burn Practice absolutely perfect for me today. I honour you for your radiant and authentic expression and am grateful to you for sharing the amazing experience of breathwork &amp; yoga with the world in the most accessible way. So much love xxx",Tish Smit,2021-01-11T07:28:54Z,0

Please! Just stay in bed a little longer.” . I was slowly giving in. I felt I was failing. I felt weak. But, I showed up.

I had been trying to get my mom to try a &quot;yoga with Adriene&quot; for 9 months now and she really disliked it. We do yoga together twice a week and she was a yoga instructor when she was younger. It was way too hard for her and me, too. I will try to keep repeating this practice till I can make it through.

Not interested in my passions, relationships suffering, and, most importantly, I realized I did not love myself. Thank you Adriene for your intuition, mindfulness and honesty in these practices. Every time my mind wanders, or I start to struggle in the practice, you touch on it with beautiful reminders that allow me to focus. You bring me down to earth, remind me that we are all human and that self love is the most important thing. I truly appreciate you so much. xo",Drew Douglas,2021-01-08T16:30:45Z,0

"Without a doubt this is my favorite core workout. It was super hard for me! I loved it because it was slow enough to let me follow my breath and really pay attention to my body and movements. I was able to change, modify, and have fun. Core workouts generally terrify me! I modified it often, but I survived! It taught me something valuable: when I move at my pace, mindful of my condition, I am happy and thrive during hard times.",Sarah McLin,2021-01-08T08:05:45Z,0

"Showing up to the mat refreshed and restored from yesterday’s event by an extended time of rest and meditation.  The breath of Fire leading the way; passive and active, yin-yang, dark-bright, negative and positive. Dualism interconnecting and interdependent creating  energy, reducing my anxiety, and giving a big boost to my brain.  Oh the brain, takes over, the mind starts wandering seeking greedily the heartbeat and it founds it. A smile, pleasure, and excitement “Is there, I hear it”’my beloved heartbeat in sync with yours my teacher. With a swift move there is a shift to mindfulness, the here and now invoked by the burn, the heat of my abdominals, and I let the breath guide each move and the effort to completion. Breathe deep and let go, feel each corner of my body alive, invigorating, and joyful. I transition to Tend and there it is again the sweetness of the beat but this time the mind is resting, there is no greed, just the desire to connect inwards and tend to my need to rest. <br />Grateful for Day #6 and all of you who made this practice a reality",Adriana Franco,2021-01-08T05:49:40Z,0

Does anyone else have trouble with the second to last pose? Where you let your knees fall open? I find it so uncomfortable in my hips and pelvis and tail bone. Wondering if it will get better in time... Not sure if it has to do with loose joints after having babies or chronic pain but it&#39;s really a tricky one for my body. Just curious if it&#39;s comfortable for others or if anyone has suggestions on how to modify.

Gooooooddddddddneeesssss. Today was a mess. Work got in the way of the morning flow and just some other life stuff. Just finished at 9pm after forgetting and having the dreaded A-HA moment of I have yoga to do. But even after eating a bowl of ice cream I still found this one to flow by. Breath was there and only had to take a couple breaks. Not too bad!!!! Hope y&#39;all are crushing it.,Michael McNeil,2021-01-08T02:42:14Z,0
"Hey Adriene, I have been along for the ride since Day 1 but my back has begun to hurt after practices since Day 5.

"ab pain is the worst type of pain... many times throughout the practice i dropped down from the pose because my abs clenched and it was just unbearable at the moment. and i also hated the bit with lifting legs and arms up from the tabletop position, my arms were just buckling down all the time. anyways, i persevered! unfortunately, in order to strengthen the core and arms one has to do poses for them 😅",Анастасия Макарович,2021-01-08T02:39:08Z,0
"I really was not having a good day, everything seemed to be going wrong, and I didn&#39;t want to come to my mat. I am a morning yogi, and I procrastinated the practice all day (Man, did I feel the difference not starting my day with my practice). I was about to convince myself not to do it today, a normal habit that I am trying to navigate, and I instead opened the comments to this video. Reading this community&#39;s encouragement about how good they felt to have completed the practice, I think, pushed me forward to unroll my mat. And once the mat was out, I might as well play the video... And I am so glad I did. A slow burn indeed that made me proud of myself for not breaking a self promise &lt;3 I will see you all tomorrow for morning practice, and thanks to everyone for your encouragement :) namaste!",Justine Harper,2021-01-08T02:38:13Z,233

"That’s really a nice way to encourage yourself! I actually skipped on practice yesterday and ending this video right now I’m kinda okay with it because I don’t think I was ready for this burn yesterday. But sometimes you even surprise yourself by even taking the first step and everything else seems already less difficult. So next time I’m procrastinating practice I’m going to read the comments as well, and as you’re there you might  end up doing the practice as well. Thanks for sharing!!!",Juliette van Beek,2021-01-08T22:07:57Z,2

"My notes from today that nobody asked for:<br />This was considerably less scary and hard than I thought it would be (still kicked my ass at times)<br />Even though I’m at home alone I was really embarrassed about the fact that coming out of low boat made me GRUNT nearly every time. I made myself cry from embarrassment lol<br />Even though this is only day 6, I can already tell a difference in my breath control, and even my strength. I can hold planks longer and it takes a few seconds before I start shaking like a leaf, where before it was right away. And I can breathe through it<br />My neck and chest get really hot and itchy in plank pose:(<br />My arms and neck had a better workout than my core tbh, didn’t know my neck muscles were so weak.

"I didn&#39;t make it to the mat on day 5. What a day that was. But I woke early and did it. It wasn&#39;t the best practice for me, but I did it. Still so emotional from yesterday, I just didn&#39;t want to get on the mat this evening for Day 6. But I saw Adriene&#39;s IG post and headed straight upstairs. I am beyond glad I did. While difficult, my body was able to release some of the tension it is holding. Thank you to this community. It is more than needed in my life right now.",Anna Puryear,2021-01-08T01:20:56Z,1
"I forgot Day 6 is always about abs and like many of you, I was scared. Conversely, I love Breath of Fire!  I do it every morning and it wakes me right up!  I also liked the strong inhales during exertion which helped with low boat.  Low boat used to wreck me, but I&#39;ve worked on it and now it only burns a lot:)  Thanks to all hanging in there with me.  Love to all those in turmoil.  May they find, peace, peace, peace.

My grampa ended up passing while he was in the hospital on Tuesday, and I&#39;ve been worrying about the past some, feeling guilty for not spending &quot;enough&quot; time with him, upset that I didn&#39;t get to see him before he passed, etc. This practice really helped me re-ground and re-center in the present moment. At one point I shouted &quot;she&#39;s trying to kill me!&quot; because it was getting difficult lol.

"This years practice has been hard for me.

"I&#39;m so glad of reading all comments after I completed this session at 11 pm today :P<br />I was struggling and wondering WHEN DOES THIS END, but I felt really good after I finished. I know I will get my periods in a few days, and I feel really annoyed about this. It may seem like nothing, but I always feel weakened, I may have to stop the projects I&#39;m doing, sometimes it&#39;s preventing me from starting a sports program because I know I will have to pause it during the month and it&#39;s not motivating. Maybe I&#39;ll also have to stop the Yoga as well, but I would like to give it a try. My periods make me feel like I&#39;m weak, I&#39;m forced to take a break I don&#39;t always want, to stay in bed and feel low in energy when I&#39;d like to go things. But you said &quot;notice how it feels like to be alive today&quot;, and strangely it made me feel empower instead. I know I&#39;ll have my periods in a few days, but I&#39;M ALIVE, right?<br />They cannot take &quot;that&quot; away from me. I might feel weak, tired, or anything, but I&#39;m still alive.

"Commenting for accountability Day 6: practicing after catching up with Day 5 earlier. Felt concerned at various points that I wasn’t doing things “right,” including the fire breath, but was also surprised that the fire breath felt pretty natural and rhythmic after a bit. I was mad at myself for not being able to hold everything/do everything fully in terms of strength and endurance. Am hoping to return to this practice again as an addition to continue building strength. For some reason, I feel the need to be silent for a bit after doing this, which is interesting, maybe a way of restoring myself?",Grackle Mac,2021-01-07T21:28:39Z,0
"Day 6:<br /><br />HAH.  To heck with procrastinating, avoidance, fear, or giving into yesterday being hard.  I showed up and I did it.  So there.<br /><br />I actually did pre-watch today&#39;s session before doing it, as suggested in the comments yesterday, and oh my gosh it helped so much?  Today was still HARD, but that&#39;s because the poses themselves were hard, not because I was all caught up in my head trying to figure them out while also laying on the floor and not able to see the screen.  Score one for excellent advice from strangers on the internet.<br /><br />The low boat/high boat expansion and contraction was rough because my core literally, physically cannot do what Adriene does there, and it&#39;s not an easy one to quickly notice a good modification to.  I can sink down into the &#39;low boat&#39;, but then I absolutely CAN&#39;T get back up to the center.  The good lesson there, though, was realizing I could set myself up for better success by not sinking down nearly so far to begin with.  Sure, my &#39;low boat&#39; turned out to be more like a medium boat at high tide, but I still got a little dip and it was still high enough that I COULD complete the effort and come back to center once I&#39;d done it.  Which means I win, because I figured out what I needed and did it.<br /><br />I&#39;m going to HURT tomorrow, but I feel a lot better now than I did at the end of yesterday, so go me.",Clarity C,2021-01-07T21:27:30Z,0

"Hello, beautiful and kind yoga family! I am having an inner struggle that I would love advice on. Next week there are going to be 3 long days where I’m moving into a new place. These three days will be strenuous and exhausting and I anticipate the last thing I will want to do on those days is do yoga even though I’m sure it would be lovely to have a nice stretch after 15+ hours of moving boxes. I’m trying to decide if I let go of these three days and understand that I have to place my focus elsewhere of double up videos once I am moved. The letting go is hard since I have committed to this 30 day practice and doesn’t sit right that I won’t complete it. I would love other people’s thoughts and advice to guide me in a direction that feels loving and comfortable.",Rachel Walters,2021-01-07T21:00:38Z,0

The last two days have been hard. Yesterday feeling mentally overwhelmed with lockdown and home schooling and today just unwell and unhappy. I opened YouTube and saw ‘burn’ and my mind went back to ‘back in the day Adriene’ with the tough workouts! I think I was mentally hoping for ‘ease’ or ‘reflect’ or something but then I heard ‘do not be afraid!’ And I sat down and just gave it a go and ok I paused a time or two but made it through and felt a sense of achievement and happiness.

"Ok, I never thought I&#39;d say this: I LOVED DAY 6!

I dreaded, hated, worried about day 6 in the past, but now I just love the confidence core work gives me. <br />Accepting my belly, giving it the attention it deserves with binds and twists as well as hardcore strength building has been one of the biggest changes in my relationship with my body since starting yoga. You expect to become bendier, better balanced and stronger, but what I didn&#39;t expect is the love and gratitude I feel for my body now.<br />To everyone struggling today: keep up the good work! If it&#39;s burning, it&#39;s working ;) <br />To everyone in doubt if to do the video: DO IT! It might just be the tiny spark you need to light that fire. To burn that bridge. To ignite that flame. <br />Love you guys, a huge namaste to everyone getting on the mat and burning what no longer serves.",Neja Žitnik,2021-01-07T20:34:53Z,0

"I loved this practice. My body feels so good and alive but weirdly calm at the same time. Calmer than I&#39;ve been in a while. Every time a practice contain core workout I always dread not the planks or the boat poses but the poses where you have to lift your head from the ground. The burn in my abdomen is hardly noticeable from all the shaking of my neck - throughout my yoga journey I&#39;ve struggled with lots of different poses and lots of muscle group I barely knew I had, but the neck muscles are the only ones that have brought me close to tears with frustration. Does anyone else struggle with strength in the neck? But I&#39;m sure if I remain positive and patient with myself I&#39;ll build up that strength bit by bit. And if my experience with yoga has taught me anything it is that by going bit by bit one day out of nowhere I&#39;ll be able to do it with no effort at all",Laura Hammer,2021-01-07T20:24:14Z,0

I will bookmark this one when I want to get after the abs. The fire breath can lead to hyperventilation if you aren’t careful to be aware of you lung volume. I felt my tummy with my hands and focused on hitting my hands with my navel on the exhale.

This is one of the biggest things I harp on and on about -- the commitment comes with time! Breaks are natural. Pauses help us to appreciate those moments we might otherwise trudge through. You can burn out from too much of a good thing all at once!,peach fuzz,2021-01-09T05:30:54Z,1

"This journey makes me realize that I don&#39;t love my body. When I breathe deeply, and my belly rises, it gives me some sort of &quot;dysphoria&quot;, in a sense that I get panicked thinking how my stomach is so huge, and I don&#39;t know why but I get so much anxiety from this. Even though I know I&#39;m in good physical condition, I keep getting this panicked mind whenever I look at my relaxed belly. Lockdown made me relapse into my old self hatred demons, and yoga is really helping with reconnecting with my body, and loving it as it is. It&#39;s hard but if you guys can do it, I can do it too. And if I can do it, you can do it too. I&#39;m grateful for all this love shared during this yoga journey, and wish you all a good  day/night until tomorrow",Fanny Bee,2021-01-07T18:49:32Z,0

"Hi! Maybe this isn&#39;t helpful, but have you tried to squeeze both thighs in toward the center while doing bridge? I have weak knees and sometimes in bridge they bother me, but then I realize it&#39;s because I am allowing them to splay outward which kind of twists them. It bothers me least when I really maintain a squeeze toward the midline through the whole bridge. &lt;3",Cora McHugh,2021-01-07T18:37:32Z,0

Day 6! I went back to work properly today and as I work with pre-school children my back and neck is always tense and sore after a working day. The tension is gone now after this and as usual I feel so relaxed! I also was so happy to see that I recognised certain core poses / exercises from HIIT workouts but with the yoga version I actually managed to do it a lot better and I enjoyed it! The Simba one especially made me laugh! It&#39;s so lovely to discover a form of mental and physical workout that doesn&#39;t make me want to cry and give up but instead keeps me coming back for more ❤️ ❤️ ❤️,Lauren,2021-01-07T18:06:29Z,0

I can only sustain a few seconds, it takes a lot of co-ordination skills, I feel my breath just wears out after doing about 5 times.

"From past experiences day 6 is usually where I fail myself and my body spectacularly. There would be fireworks, that’s usually how bad I fail. So when I opened the email this morning for day 6 warning me that there will be a fiery burn, I gave myself permission to take breaks, to let myself fail and to take breaks as my body needed them. When Adriene said, “if you are taking a break, join us for one last one...”, I seriously felt like she was talking to me. I don’t feel great after today’s practice...BUT I didn’t fail myself or my body and I showed up... which is always the hardest thing to do. Thank you ❤️",Ayisha Raja-Qadri,2021-01-07T17:06:50Z,0

"Huge surge of anxiety always hits me whenever any sort of core practice is concerned. I&#39;ve never been the athletic type and what stayed with me from school work outs was mostly shame. Because I was not as strong as other, I couldn&#39;t do as many reps as others. Doing yoga on this channel has helped me so much, I&#39;m still anxious because I feeel I can&#39;t do it and I&#39;ll be left feeling frustrated and hurting, but it&#39;s never really anything I can&#39;t take. And bit by bit I see myself getting stronger. As we did the twisted low boats today I realised how far I&#39;ve come since half a year ago!<br />I&#39;m especially proud of myself since I&#39;ve spent a good portion of the day shoveling snow and was worried I wouldn&#39;t have the strength. But seeing it all cleared up and having done this practice – and actually having fun with touching the toes to the ground! –I feel a true sense of accomplishment!<br />Thank you for slowly helping me change, Adriene!",MaddGhost,2021-01-07T16:59:34Z,0

"Not going to lie, I struggled with the thought of showing up to a practice called &quot;Burn&quot;, but in the end I did it. Not sure how I feel about breath of fire, it feels very similar to hyperventilating for me which makes my throat tighten with anxiety, so maybe I need to work first on slowing down that type of breath. Promising pupdate: she got very excited when I laid out my mat, and laid with her body touching my legs and her chin on my knees when we were sitting and breathing in the very beginning. Occasionally she ran in the other room to play, but she mostly laid around by me and either just chilled or chewed on her bone. We are both getting accustomed to this yoga thing it seems. :P",Scarlet Winter,2021-01-07T16:46:43Z,0

I feel like I am reconnecting with parts of my body I haven’t felt properly in probably over a year.

I would recommend keeping your head on the ground but still engage your core when doing these types of practices. Over time you can test if you’re ready to lift your head, just remember to keep your shoulder blades drawn down and to not crank your neck.

Hello Adrienne and Benji<br />Today was so difficult.I loved learning this new breathing technique<br />I&#39;m afraid when it began with working core and abdominals I did it &quot;my way&quot; because my muscles are not strong enough for it and I start to breathe really creatively😝 so I&#39;m happy and feel good because I didn&#39;t quit but a little disappointed because I knew the power of my muscles butt it became very real in action (not sure it make sense) anyway I know if I continue I&#39;ll feel good and will become stronger so I keep gratefull and hopeful <br />This was a really good day <br />Thanks again for this peace new to me and myself<br />NAMASTE<br />🧘🏼‍♂️💚🔆🌎🐾🌞☀️❤️🐾🙏,Pattsy Liloo,2021-01-07T15:53:31Z,0

Well this practice was a learning lesson for me - that I am not as &#39;yoga strong&#39; as I am &#39;yoga flexible&#39;.

"As tough as all the core work was in this one (and I did have to take a couple breaks...) the hardest post for me in the whole practice - something I always find the hardest pose - was the child&#39;s pose.<br /><br />I have a bit of a belly on me, especially after the last few months of lockdowns, and when I try going into child&#39;s pose, my torso feels so restricted my body immediately starts to panic, and tries gasping for air, and I have to come out of childs pose, out of pure fight-or-flight adrenaline. I always modify to extended childs pose with my legs wide so I can breathe.<br /><br />Just a funny experience I thought I&#39;d share in case anyone else can relate. As tough as the core workout may be, that&#39;s just tiring, but feeling that spike of panic in what is supposed to be a relaxation pose is... something I want to avoid until I can gradually get into it without that experience!!",VictorLHouette,2021-01-07T14:55:09Z,0

At the end, I almost thought it was too easy, but then I thought back and realized I was indeed working hard the whole time. This is a nice change from conditioning classes I&#39;ve taken in the past, where I always felt like one of the weaker links, and I often felt ready to collapse at the end, super sweaty and exhausted. There&#39;s something to say for really hard workouts, but I think I much prefer this.<br /><br />Side note, the breath of fire is a core workout in itself!

"I find it incredibly irresponsible of you to teach breath of fire via YouTube with a very poor instruction of it every time. I&#39;ve been practicing with you for a long time now and every time you do this one I am left utterly confused and breathing improperly when I follow your instructions. You are not as skilled at teaching pranayama as you are asana. Breath of fire can be very dangerous for people, particularly new practitioners - which make up the majority of people participating in these 30 day challenges - and you don&#39;t even give a disclaimer that it is contraindicated for many. This is an incredibly advanced type of breath and shouldn&#39;t be taught in this way. I am an experienced yoga teacher that thoroughly enjoys practicing with you but these are times when I deeply question your use of your large platform. This is irresponsible and I believe you should correct and apologize moving forward.",Emma,2021-01-07T14:36:38Z,0

I couldn&#39;t do it last year, and couldn&#39;t do it today after a year of yoga.

"All right. I showed up. After a couple of days with lower back pain, I chose to keep showing up for today with &quot;find what feels good&quot; and &quot;come as you are&quot; are as my mantras. I could not do a single low-boat with legs up, did all of them with legs down, and most of them holding my head  with my hands because I could feel how my body was making up the lack of core strength with preassure on my neck. Anyway, kept moving at my pace and completed the practice. Gracias....!!!",Carolina Iglesias,2021-01-07T14:02:41Z,1

On a yoga note, today is a day to note how much my relationship to my core has changed since I first did a day 6 two years ago.  All my negative feelings towards my belly have gone, and I no longer feel disconnected from my core strength.  I am not thin or ripped by any means, but I have lost my fear of working my core and now look on it as an opportunity to play and learn. Even if I fall or fail, I can laugh.

"Had to stop the practice because I could sense my anxiety rising. It was obviously unrelated to the practice itself, it just was there. I realized that when I feel mentally unstable, I just have to stop doing anything I&#39;m engaging with at that moment and just return to it later. I feel that it&#39;s part of the healing process that I&#39;m going through. Yoga has helped me realize I don&#39;t need to force myself, that it would just be counterproductive.

"Bursted into tears midway of the practice. Mental breakdown thankfully turned into breakthrough. I do have emotional turmoil in my life right now but the practice showed me the ways in which I make it harder on myself. I wasn&#39;t able to do the most advance variasions of poses and was trying to push myself harder instead of accepting where I&#39;m at right now. Then the child pose came and calmed me down with the breathing. After that I returened with love and understanding for myself, started with less advanced variations and sometimes tried harder ones but this time with curiosity and not frustration ;) lets burn what&#39;s no longer serving, thank You Adriene, namaste",Magda M,2021-01-07T11:18:27Z,1

"I’m always a bit nervous about day 6 as I usually don’t work my core very much. I read the comments before doing the video to try to find out whether today was going to be tiring but I couldn’t find too much so I felt a bit relieved. However, today was hard. Just finished and I’m fine again but while doing certain poses I was like I can noooot :D <br />Grateful I finished it and grateful for wonderful Adriene to pushing us out of our comfort zone. 🤗",Sarah Flower,2021-01-07T10:48:15Z,1

"So... starting with the end: when in cobbler pose, my mind was wandering and I was in full-on ruminating, self-deprecating, frustrated mode because I really couldn&#39;t do a couple of poses today, as my body is quite tired, and I simply lacked the strength and energy to lift it. I told myself I was really not fit enough, not strong enough, I had let myself get out of shape, blah blah blah... And then, I remembered today&#39;s email and the idea that we need to meet ourselves where we are. So, this is where I am today: I have a lot of room for improvement, and it&#39;s going to be challenging to get back in shape and strengthen my core again, but that&#39;s a journey I&#39;m willing and eager to take. I will also have a big lunch and try this practice again mid-late afternoon, because I&#39;m sure I can do a little better. Thank you so much for the reminder, Adriene. Once again, today&#39;s practice was exactly what I needed and it came at the perfect time. PS. I do look forward to a little slice of heaven though... :D See you all tomorrow!",Marion Carminelitta,2021-01-07T10:37:42Z,91

Checking in. Had to modify a fair amount to make allowances for pregnancy but really enjoyed the breath work. I&#39;m excited to come back to this program later in the year to help rebuild my fitness and support my emotional well-being in the postpartum period. Thanks as always.

I wasn&#39;t sure I was ready for a Day 6 practise (recovering from covid) but was so buzzed that I breathed my way through it. The programme this year feels especially meaningful and supportive to those of us locked away in our homes and dealing with what we&#39;re dealing with. I&#39;m seeing my daily practise  as an ever more important tool in getting through to the other side of this and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone. Thank you Adrienne and the YWA community. Its lovely to be in January with you!,L Dennard,2021-01-07T10:26:15Z,1

"If you are hesitating to press play on this video because you know it might be tricky, this is your sign that you CAN do it. There are some moves that make a little fire in the belly, but you can take some breaks to breathe and Adriene prompts before the last set so you can come back strong for the final movement :). Some parts were a struggle, but now that I have finished it is not painful or sore - I feel like I am a strong warrior woman with rock hard abs (even though they are covered in their &quot;winter coat&quot;, I can feel them!).

"Soooooo for this whole practice I smiled, at some points I even laughed,  this practice met me a real low point of my life, and everyday since day one my smile has been a really big one. Making me think and feel that I really want to push my self making yoga a permanent thing in my life. Now here&#39;s what I have learned about myself thus far, 1. My core strength is really bad need to work on that, 2. For some strange reason I find my self holding my breath alot so I have to work on my breathing alot. 3. Am slow finding my center am still shaky but not as much as I was on day 1.

I love all Day 6’s of your January adventures Adriene and I save them in my Core List. It’s what keeps this senior yogi strong. Most are low to the ground which suits me fine as it’s off my wrists. This new practice was fun and as always went so quick. It didn’t seem like nearly half an hour. I needed a little neck support for those last moves but I knew you would allow me that 😉. That was awesome. I feel like I’ve had a full body workout. See you tomorrow on the mat for Day 7 🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💕,Gill Smith,2021-01-07T09:28:29Z,0

Got the giggle bad between rounds on the Breath of Fire, no idea why and had to really concentrate on the second round which really woke up my core all round and brought on a sweat... Feeling really strong today and pleased to have kept going all the way through with no breaks or modifications 👍 Loved where we got to lift Simba up and over too...

I&#39;ve been doing YWA for three years now and lately I&#39;ve been pushing myself to get on the mat, get a yoga workout done and &quot;take time for myself&quot;. But I haven&#39;t been able to actually use this time for myself. My thoughts have been wandering, I&#39;ve been pushing myself to quicker and harder practices. With BREATH you really showed me how to peel off the layers, to look inside, to breathe fully and to finally connect with myself again. Thank you Adriene for the unbelievably smart and kind language you use. Thank you for showing me what&#39;s important when I don&#39;t know it myself.

The whole world is watching today in shock to the nightmare that has been unfolding itself in the  US since the past four years leading to the tragedy we have seen yesterday. It is so tempting to be disappointed in humanity and lose faith in times like this until you are welcomed by Adriene on this channel.

"It was intense and difficult. It was centered on core practices. I liked the varieties but I did the last core practices with a couple of breath breaks. <br /><br />At first, she introduces another pranayama technique called the &#39;breath of fire&#39; which was interestingly a bit hard to concentrate on the procedure at times. <br /><br />Doing planks with one leg up is challenging but keeping the balance with also one opposite hand up is very challenging. <br /><br />The hardest part for me was both legs up and lifting the soles of the feet towards the sky. In this move, I needed some breaks.<br /><br />My legs and abs are a bit sore. I enjoyed it.",Pooya Valinataj,2021-01-07T08:17:15Z,0

Felt reassuring and guided me into a moment of ease as well. <br />And if this actually didn’t happen and I’m imagining things then I guess I’m happy to be able to hear my own heartbeat haha,Fleur van den Putten,2021-01-07T07:07:36Z,0

I knew this one was coming and I was slightly dreading it because I&#39;m picking yoga back up after a few months break and my muscles are like a little baby but I DID IT! I took a few breaks but I stuck with it and I&#39;ve found some muscles I forgot I had and I feel GREAT (if a little wobbly) &lt;3,Abi Cooper,2021-01-07T07:02:35Z,0
