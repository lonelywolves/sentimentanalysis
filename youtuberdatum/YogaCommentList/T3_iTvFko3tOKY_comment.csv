"Good morning fellow travelers on this journey today I came to the mat and it looked like January(about inch or two of snow in the yard ) . Thought I had hit a time warp and some how caught up with the first group   but I made it to the mat none the less, see you tomorrow .",David Cates,2021-04-21T14:29:17Z,1
"Adriene, I very much appreciate your videos and your love. You&#39;re a pro and everything you do seems so effortless. However, in my (very clumsy) experience these transitions are waaaay too fast for beginners and heavier people :/",Laura T√°rk√°nyi,2021-04-18T18:19:59Z,0

"I have loved your videos ever since my friend Janina introduced me to you. They are great for people who are just starting yoga as well as people who have done yoga for years. It&#39;s a nice pace that really helps you establish and maintain your base when it comes to yoga (something even experts can struggle with). I love your message of self-love and your attitude of accepting your limits and doing what makes you feel comfortable- one of the main reasons I joined yoga- instead of &quot;pushing past the pain&quot;. In everyday life I always feel like I&#39;m behind in life and that I will never be enough, however whenever I do your yoga videos I feel enough for myself even if I&#39;m not always able to do all the yoga positions in the video. I recommended you to my therapist since I&#39;ve found it a lot easier for self-acceptance whenever I do your yoga videos as a routine for myself. You&#39;re amazing Adriene and I just wanted you to know that :)",Mollie White,2021-04-11T12:32:59Z,0

"Thank you Adriene. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve been on the mat, the longest time since I started, and it&#39;s good to be back. Today I had the time, but could feel myself dismissing the need/desire to do yoga. That&#39;s a bad habit of mine; pushing away healthy habits in favor of cheap comforts. I am grateful that, on session at a time, I am practicing contrary action and building new habits that will build me up and sustain me in healthy way.",Taylor Hill,2021-04-08T00:20:02Z,0

It&#39;s Mother&#39;s Day here in the UK and a friend of mine very recently lost his mum and I dedicated this practice to her and her beautiful family. This practice was so great to commence healing.

"Today‚Äôs the first day I truly didn‚Äôt want to do yoga. I had honestly already decided I‚Äôd skip today. But I know I‚Äôll have to skip another day because of travel later next week, so I forced myself to do this.

"It was ironic that today we were asked to focus on the quality of movement and not the doing.. because the whole active part of the class for me was way too fast.  I found that to keep up with it, I had to fling myself through the postures, unable to focus on the quality.  I got very frustrated &amp; upset.  I need blocks to go from a low lunge to plank, so it just takes a little more time for me to move through those types of postures.  I&#39;m not sure why Adriene chose to move quickly for this one... but... it didn&#39;t work for me at all.  Actually I learned today that I&#39;m really good at moving with intention.",Lesley Mathis,2021-03-11T03:01:45Z,0

"WOW!! I REALLY knocked on heaven&#39;s door today haha. That control, listening to and trusting myself, giving myself permission to veer off the tracks as much as I need, and also trusting Adriene&#39;s guidance in the speed and timing of the practice, all served me well this morning. When it came to the knocking on heaven&#39;s door, I felt hesitant at first, not because it makes me feel silly, but because I felt like I could find a profound stillness in that moment. Instead, I trusted you, and went ahead with it because I do like that movement. I found myself moving faster and faster with the breath of fire to lead me. It was power. Now that was strength in stillness if I ever felt it. I actually just stood there and breathed for minutes after the video ended! Not even choosing to lay down or sit. Thank you for turning my day around. I will listen to and trust myself in all that I&#39;ve got going on today. Thank you, thank you, thank you!",Valaya Hart,2021-02-05T17:26:17Z,1

Good to know the playback speed can be adjusted. I also found it fast paced compared to the previous lessons which made my breath not as in control. I can&#39;t bring my leg all the way forward from down dog to the position between the palms and I need an extra beat to adjust my foot forward.

"I found it especially hard to keep up with this routine today.

But since I need to pad my knees and I can&#39;t physically get into the position where my knee slides under my torso to a lunge with either palms on the ground... I didn&#39;t really know how to modify a large section of this routine. I know the focus was on the breath control insynce with how we move but I got frustrated. I couldn&#39;t keep up with moving the cushion from my knees to come to my belly on the ground and putting the cushion back and adding an awkward movement to the side to get into my modification of lunge. üò© I know each routine can&#39;t be for everyone.",Hallel Tyler,2021-01-23T18:49:47Z,0

"I am so grateful for this program &lt;3 I came to the mat today experiencing more anxiety than usual, worried that I would have a panic attack or be stuck in the anxiety cycle all night. But I showed up, got on the mat, and it all slowly started to melt away. Through these practices my mat has become my sanctuary, my safe place. When you talked about our willingness to let things transform rather than being fixed that was the perfect thing for me to hear. I noticed how much, even though I didn&#39;t want to be anxious, how much I was holding onto that fear of the fear, how stiff that felt, and when I surrendered and chose to let it all go, it all really did start to shift. By the end of the practice I had found that sense of peace within me again, and I had the biggest joyful smile on my face :) A huge weight had been lifted and I felt free to move through my life as my truest self again, not weighted down by anxious thoughts. The very first thing that I wrote in my journal was &quot;my yoga mat saves my life&quot;. These last few years I have experienced a level of anxiety/PTSD that truly did take the life that I love away in many ways. But my practice, and these videos, give me back hours/days that I may have otherwise spent in negative or anxious thoughts and emotions. They bring me back to myself and help me to let go of all that does not serve me, so that I can live this one wild and precious life that I have in a state of joy, playfulness, and comfort; rather than being controlled by or lost in anxiety. While I have taken an active role in healing my anxiety/PTSD through reading books, joining groups, going to therapy, and more, I want you to know that your videos have played a HUGE role in my healing/recovery, and I am just so grateful for these videos and this community. Often they are the only thing that can truly shift my energy when I need it the most. My practice, the practice that you have guided me to, truly is saving my beautiful life in such a deep way. Thank you, all of you who make these videos possible, thank you so much for putting this out into the world so that it can reach people like me. Much love to you all &lt;3 &lt;3",Scarlett,2021-01-23T09:04:10Z,0

Today I didn&#39;t really feel like doing the practice, I was just delaying it, but I did it anyway and I&#39;m so glad! The possibility of lying down in the beggining helped to encouraged me and, by the time we were at that moment just before knocking on heavens door, I caught myself dancing on my own, almost predicting the movement that was about to come. And in the end, the energy that I felt flowing through my body was so worth it!",Andressa Olivieri,2021-01-23T02:16:18Z,0

Adriene ! I would like to know if you have any advice on my mat rolling out ! I usually roll my mat up after every practice. So then obviously naturally when I go to unroll it the end of the mat wants to roll back up lol! Before every practice for like 5 minutes I just put a weight on the one end so then during my practice is isnt annoying ! Is there a better way I should be doing this ? I just can‚Äôt keep the mat unrolled 24/7 unfortunately:( love your videos ! I‚Äôm very proud I‚Äôve made it all 21 days so far where in the past I‚Äôve given up at like 14. Thanks for the great content always ‚ù§Ô∏è,Kaitlynn Healy,2021-01-23T02:04:41Z,1
What I have found useful is to try rolling it a little looser or roll it inside out so when you roll it flat again the curved ends are facing down and work with gravity to flatten.,Earth_Mama Wolski,2021-01-23T02:14:36Z,1

"Today was the first ‚Äúbad‚Äù day i‚Äôve had in a long time. After 2 breakdowns and things just really not going my way, I almost opted for a run instead of doing yoga. Traditionally running is my favorite stress reliever- the mundanity of one foot in front of the other, being able to shut my brain off. But today I chose to continue with the 30 day yoga journey and i am so glad i did. Instead of ‚Äúnumbing‚Äù my mind- i found conscious peace today.

"I nearly burst into tears during this practice because I suddenly noticed a ton of improvements all at once. <br /><br />1. I used to have quite a bit of lower back pain transitioning from mountain to forward fold, today there was none.<br />2. I noticed planks felt sturdier and easier.<br />3. My heels NEARLY touched the ground in downward dog! So excited for the day they do! <br />4. This is the biggest one. I dread three-legged dogs because I&#39;m never able to hold them for more than a few seconds and it&#39;s a struggle to do even that but I was able to do the entire duration of circles in three-legged dog and it only started feeling like a struggle near the end. So pretty decent strength improvements! <br /><br />If this is how far I&#39;ve gotten in just 21 days, I&#39;m so curious to see how far I could get in 6 months or a year of regular practice. I&#39;m a little blown away to be honest.",watermelancholy,2021-01-22T22:11:14Z,1

"I love how all of these practices are so connected, they seem to meet up with my healing journey so perfectly, and grow with me. I often focus so much on everything I cannot control. I can feel like I&#39;m drowning in it, especially as I navigate grief right now. Thank you for reminding me that I can bring my focus to my own power. That there are things that I can control. It&#39;s a balancing act in this healing. I am surrendering to what I cannot control and walking by faith, because we were not meant to control it all, we are held by something bigger. As Adriene pointed out, we don&#39;t have to look down, the earth will be right there to support us. But we liberate ourselves in finding the pieces that we can control. In making the choice to move with love, to show up, to be brave, to give ourselves what we need, and find joy when it arrives in the present moment -- today it was noticing the snow suddenly blowing outside my window in the middle of practice. Thank you so much, Adriene. These practices are saving my life. Every day I count on daily practice with you as my landing place. It is often the best part of my day. I know I don&#39;t actuallyyy know you, but I really love you so much. And Benji too, of course. Haha. Namaste to you both! And everyone here. This community is just so full of love.

"I don‚Äôt want this comment to come across negatively or critical because it is not meant to be. My Breath sweatshirt arrived yesterday and I am wearing it today. It just fits, only just. I ordered the largest size. (I normally wear a size 16 or XL but ordered the 18, hoping it would be a big baggy). I am just wondering if in the future there can be a larger range of sizes for merchandise? Yoga is so great at any size or age(I started my practice in my 40‚Äôs and am now in my 60‚Äôs). There seems to be this myth that yoga is only for the thin and the young. I‚Äôm sure that is not something you would ever want to perpetuate. I‚Äôm just wondering if in the future there could be some larger sizes so that anyone doing the 30 day challenge, regardless of size, would be able to have something that fits comfortably. Thanks for listening and I love your channel and believe you will take this in the spirit it was given. Namaste!",Sally Cormier,2021-01-22T19:59:05Z,0

"This is my first 30 day yoga journey with you, even though I&#39;ve been practicing yoga fairly regularly for the last 2 years or so. I love how your practices are all about connecting your mind with your body, and goes without saying that at a crazy time like this - it has given me rhythm and stability all at the same time. <br />One thing I have found increasingly amusing though, is how one of my cats now likes to be present in the room with me whilst I practice - which is completely new. Perhaps it&#39;s the routine of me unfolding my mat every day, or maybe it&#39;s your calming voice; but she comes and lays near me and I realise because of this I look forward to this practice every day but for a completely unexpected reason now.<br /><br />I just wanted to pass on - as you have a gift and you may not realise how generous it is to us all xxx",Charlotte Hjort,2021-01-22T19:35:40Z,0

I only skipped one day through the whole journey, which I did the day after with the new practice and I must say, I am very proud, because there were a lot of days where it was very difficult to show up, especially this last week. Thank you again, for being there for us! Sending a lot of love to you (and Benji)",Csenge Kov√°cs,2021-01-22T17:30:40Z,0

"Today my uni placement gave all of us volunteers a self-care day. So rather than online training, we got to do something for ourselves.

"I felt like this practice was only 5 minutes long! <br />Loved bringing awareness to the movement and focusing on how I was doing it. To be in control.<br />We&#39;re often on &quot;autopilot&quot; mode and maybe a lot of our concerns and problems start as a consequence of this lack of attention on ourselves, on how we&#39;re behaving and moving in space.

And maybe even more so when there&#39;s was plenty of time to knock on heaven&#39;s door, whereas there had been too little time for all that came before. Perhaps this was the underlying idea, but the control and enjoyment I&#39;ve felt until now, was interrupted by today&#39;s practice. I hope to recover the build-up tomorrow...
