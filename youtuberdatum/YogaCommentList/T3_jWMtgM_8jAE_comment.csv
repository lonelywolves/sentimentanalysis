Day 5 (Replenish) is definitely my favourite so far in the BREATH 30 Day Yoga Journey! I am 5 days in and I loved the pace of this video. I really enjoyed how quickly we got to move between the poses because some days my mind tends to wander when holding a pose for 20-30 seconds but when we moved between the downward dog and the warrior poses all my thoughts left and I could truly focus on Adriene&#39;s voice:)<br />Thank you Adriene for giving us this channel to escape to when we need it!,Kate Moore,2021-04-06T15:52:05Z,1

I already love the slow, but powerful, flow of the sessions. A practical thing: How do you people avoid sliding on the mat in downward facing dog?

"Going through this series my second time I&#39;m so glad I decided to do it immediately after finishing it the first time. It being fresh in my memory with things that initially were slightly harder to do are suddenly slightly easier. Love being able to find new things to work on too. That&#39;s what is nice about those hard beginning days where you didn&#39;t feel good about how it went, you may come back later and have the satisfaction of doing it. Which makes it sweeter than having been able to do it in the first place.",Kerry Kunze,2021-02-09T23:57:08Z,0

I am approaching 70 now and have adapted my practice to more gentler ones over the years. It took awhile to not judge myself when it was time for hip replacement and at first viewed the changes as &quot;I used to do pigeon&quot; or other poses as a failure on my part. I now teach adaptive accessible yoga with Lakshmi Voelker Chair Yoga and help other yogis and those who find getting up and down on the mat challenging.

Well. Today’s practice was very hard because stretching is always hard for my stiff body. Noped out of some poses because I wasn’t sure it would be safe for my back. I just hope that with time the body will adapt and sometime later I might return to this video and find it not difficult at all. Thanks for the challenge Adriene! I’m trying to get back into yoga after a break and your videos are a great motivation boost.,kim taegummie,2021-01-31T11:44:53Z,0

"Adrienne, I just want to tell you, you’re an inspiration. In 2019, I was 230lbs and had to go on a drug to prevent diabetes since I was prediabetic. I began watching your videos and lost 97 lbs. now, with the quarantine and working from homes, I’ve gained 30 lbs back and had lost my routine. I began doing your 30 day yoga journey again and have lost 5 lbs in 5 days! I love you! What you do doesn’t just help me lose weight and build strength. I also find that starting my day off with you helps me to have a better day. My work ethic improves, I’m more patient with my son, and it sets the pace for me to succeed from dawn to dusk.

"@Sara Zonneveldt but just to give an example, today I had a scrambled egg over a half an avocado for breakfast (200 calories) a healthy choice steamer meal for lunch (290 calories) and what I cook for my son and boyfriend for dinner.

I consume roughly 1200-1500 a day depending on the amount of calories I burn through yoga, cardio, etc, and I don’t snack between meals.

"I guess this isn&#39;t for everyone.  I &quot;sort of&quot; got through the &quot;30 days with Adriene&quot; and thought I would then try this Breath 30 days, but surprisingly it is for me way too hard and frustrating.  Too difficult to hear and understand her and when I do look up she is 3 poses ahead.  I really suck at the poses also, and although I know I only need to do what I can, when one is so far off, it tends to be too frustrating to keep trying something that is way too difficult.  I&#39;m going to give up on this Breath voyage and maybe try some of her other videos for runners or climbers or left-handed chess players or whatever, or maybe try the original 30 days again and see if I can find something that isn&#39;t just exhausting and straining and frustrating  I&#39;ve never been flexible so this isn&#39;t much of a surprise, but I hoped it would help with range of motion.  Maybe it has a little, but too little to really tell after just some 5-6 weeks or so.  Anyway, hopefully i am the rare duck that doesn&#39;t fit in here and everyone else is doing great and really happy and energized.  It sounds like it from the other responses.

Also, for me, even when it says 20... it is longer as I often have to watch and listen to what you want us to do and rewind and do it with you.  And I love being able to pause it so if I need to move my computer or it takes me longer to get into the pose or want to stay a moment longer in a pose I can.  Bonus being able to repeat a class.

Omg it’s amazing how quickly your body can regress into a pile of mush. Only 6 months since I kicked my regular workout habit and I had zero core or arm strength to support my planks or downward dogs. I almost cried I was so frustrated with how I kept breaking. But I breathed and got back into position and finished. Hoping by the end of the 30 days I’ll have some strength back and drive to get back into a regular workout routine.,Simone Salmon,2021-01-15T12:55:03Z,0

"I’ve been forced to stop working or being active at all due to a fever of unknown origin during this pandemic.  After months of barely being able to stand long enough to do dishes, I’m finally trying to work on my stamina and begin to cope with fatigue.  I used to be one of the most active people I knew, and this whole thing has been a huge hit to that part of my identity.  Though I can’t do these videos every day because of the fever and fatigue, the gentle way she invites you back makes it feel like it’s okay.  In a way, her commentary makes it okay to be forgiving of myself and the new limitations my body has.  That I’m listening to what my body can handle, and that is the best I can do right now for it.  That kind of forgiveness is invaluable in allowing me to cope with these strange new limitations, and I’m sure it’s like that for everyone, regardless of your situation.",Raven Leggett,2021-01-14T20:28:57Z,0

"Started this on day 1 of my cycle, just to see how it felt (I normally rest and do restorative only). It was a bit too much for my energy levels so I let it play until halfway as I chilled in childs pose. So soothing ❤️ I did my own restorative practice for a few days but kept checking in: day 8 snugglfest was so perfect for my moon time 🙏 Came back to this today and finished the second half now I’m off my period.

Didn’t even realize it was a glitch at first, I just thought it was an interesting choice Adriene made to force me to pay more attention to my body than to hers and to trust my instincts. Didn’t figure out it wasn’t supposed to have no video until I was done and refreshed the page!

I could not do any of the more challenging excercises.

I came down with a severe cold last week and missed wed-fri. And I am glad I decided to do day 4 and day 5 together as day 4 felt like a good warm up to day 5. I found the downward dog twist the HARDEST!!! It goes to show what looks easy in yoga is not. Thank you so much Adriene for these videos.

"Straight up did not want to do this today, but I still showed up. One thing that I noticed during today&#39;s practice, is that despite taking only what I could do (I only held the smaller downward dog at the end I couldn&#39;t do the twists) and achieving what I decided to do, I started crying because of something that I couldn&#39;t do; and I think that is something that relates to overly high expectations of myself. I expect myself to do all of these crazy cool things and strong feats when in reality, I just need to do what I can and that is more than enough-- there&#39;s no shame in any of that and there should never be any shame.

I was thinking during my practice today about how much yoga meant to me when I first started dabbling at the end of 2019 -- how it opened me up spiritually and made me feel alive in a way ive never felt in my brief 19 years on this planet. It took a while for me to get to the point of daily practices and then to 30 day consistent practices -- and thats when it started getting tough and lose its shine, but I knew it was good for me, a spiritual vegetable id avoided for a long time, so I stuck with it. The 2nd go round was easier in the sense my muscles were more toned, but it was harder to feel connected in that beautiful and fulfilling way like I first felt, and a lot of the time i felt like my mind was against me. And when this 3rd cycle first started, I wondered if this was all there is, the luster of a new activity finally good and dull. <br /><br />But no. I was so wrong. I can feel that connection coming back. I can feel the hard work paying off as my mind begins to bend and strengthen in the most loving and sustainable way. As I was in the squat twisted to the right, I felt my legs on fire, and where before I would&#39;ve wanted to straighten and relieve myself, this time I thought to myself and to all of you practicing -- &quot;I know it hurts, but youre right there, you are getting stronger, you are not alone, keep holding on, dont give up!&quot; And I had the most genuine smile on my face as we all released and sank into a forward fold. <br /><br />There were times in the last 2 cycles of 30 day practices id feel so drained and unmotivated, I wouldn&#39;t do yoga that day or maybe several days, and I let myself do it. Perfectionistic guilt would try to eat at me, but I felt it didn&#39;t matter when I got back on the mat, it just mattered that I came back because I wanted to, and not because I was obligated. And I knew that if I came replenished and ready on my time, I&#39;d enjoy it more, and I did. <br /><br />So I encourage you: let yourself have a day or more if you feel you really need it. There is no shame in saying, not today. Youre listening to your body and aligning with a compassionate understanding. You will come back, and you will be happier you did it. And over time, you may find that you need less and less breaks from yoga, but don&#39;t force it. Give yourself the gift of time. You will get there.",peach fuzz,2021-01-08T01:47:29Z,0

"Catching up as I had a manic start to the year. So far loving it, but had two stumbling blocks in this one - first I really didn&#39;t even get close to folding my arms like that, I can barely grab my thumbs with the other hand coming around the elbow. And second when we got into the Vinyasa I had a really hard time sticking to the breathing as Adriene was dicating it, it was too slow for me and I badly needed oxygen so had to take a bunch of extra breaths. Are both of those things just completely ok, or is there something I&#39;m missing?<br /><br />P.s. I&#39;m not at all a beginner, I&#39;ve never gotten into the habit of regular yoga practice for more than a couple of months but I&#39;ve done it on and off for about a decade. But both of those things have  often troubled me in classes.",oflightz,2021-01-07T21:36:17Z,1

So I came to mat with my pants worn inside-out (discovered that half way through) and a shirt so big it almost came off during a downward dog and a mind so jumbled I couldn&#39;t think straight! But at the end I felt as soft and light as all the other times I got off the mat. Thank you adriene and everybody who&#39;s coming along in this journey!

"The mat, a training place, learning, practicing, and gaining strength. Taking it all to my daily journey, my interaction with the world.  Today, more than ever so far, the acquired knowledge and skills from practicing yoga and mediation were intentionally applied to help me through the dark events in the nation and the hurt, fear, and infirmity of those I encountered in the ER.  <br />Are we, as a nation, going to heal after today? Are we going to connect? I feel a deep sadness for us. <br />Practicing Replinish before facing the day was the best part of my day which prepared me to face what was not expected or imaginable.  Refilled, restored, reloaded to face an unexpectedly hard day with deeper breath that gives rise to balance, strength, and a calmed mind. <br />It is difficult today to find the mundane gifts, to find what to be thankful for yet if I look carefully there is much to thank for today in the midst of this trauma.  Thankful today for Yoga with Adriene, for today&#39;s practice, a safe and healthy space to Replenish.",Adriana Franco,2021-01-07T06:38:14Z,0

"This probably sounds kinda weird, but I closed my eyes during the eagle-arms portion of this practice and didn&#39;t open them again until it was finished. And during that time, I suddenly visualized myself in a different place - a different room, a different house, a different time of day. I kept my eyes closed because I didn&#39;t want to break the illusion, because it was so peaceful and slow and quiet. That&#39;s never happened to me before during a practice, but I welcomed it and welcomed my return home when it was finished. Not sure if anyone else has experienced anything similar, but it was nice.💜",Emily Benoit,2021-01-07T06:23:00Z,0

"That is an amazing resolution! I fell like so much changed within me once I started to be more friendly and caring with my own self. Understanding that I am my on home, my on best friend and the one who is always going to be there for me made me try to be kinder to myself. We sometimes treat our loved ones in such a caring and motherly way..but are so rude and uncaring towards ourselves right? But when we try to be kinder and be the ones telling ourselves that its going to be ok..It feels like such a warm support coming from within! Best of wishes on your journey!

I felt like today was the hardest day yet. I was sweating and breathing so heavily and even fell a couple of times but I completed the whole practice. It’s the tiny wins. I’m looking forward to growing stronger over the 30 days.,Bintou J,2021-01-07T02:25:52Z,486

@Sajida J I’m not offended at all. I think it’s great that people are coming to Yoga with Adriene to take care of themselves and not to forget about what happened. I guess I just no longer have that privilege of coming here to take care of myself by momentarily getting away from the politics of the day. It’s just as simple as not looking at the comments😁 I usually love them because I try to make the world a better place by giving nice comments and encouragement. It’s just not worth it for me if it’s going to become another channel with politics.  Have a spectacular day and thank you for being respectful and kind in your response.,K O,2021-01-11T19:43:59Z,4

"&quot;If you can make it to day 5, you can do this whole journey.&quot; What an emotional practice for me today. During the pandemic, I fell out of practice and out of shape. When I would try to pick yoga up again, I was so easily discouraged because everything felt wrong and difficult. I decided to give this journey a try and the first few days still felt wrong and difficult. Today was the first day in months I felt good and powerful and like I want yoga to be a part of me again.

"When you created these videos you had no way of knowing that a terror attack/white supremacist insurrection would occur in the U.S. capital today, but your message at the end about showing up to serve was so welcome.

"Hi Adriene! First I would like to say I love your videos and doing your classes make me feel awesome. I do have a question about the practise (maybe someone else can help me with this too). Whenever you say &#39;hug the lower ribs in&#39; , I feel like when I do that I can&#39;t breath deep into my belly anymore and my breath stays very short and high in my chest because my ribs are in the way. Do you have a tip on how to deal with this?",Silke Rice,2021-01-06T22:36:53Z,0
The first few practices were difficult for me because they moved slow and required you to hold your pose for awhile and I was eager to move on to the next not remembering that holding poses also builds strength.

"I had a rough day. I didn&#39;t even change my pj&#39;s and just sat in bed and watched four 2 hour movies (from the 50s and 60s). I wanted to escape reality so I shut my curtains and let myself be lost in the movies for a day. I didn&#39;t want to get on the mat, but it was still rolled out from yesterday&#39;s practice and I remembered that the important thing was to show up, even if I&#39;d end up in child pose for half an hour. but once on the mat, it became easy to just move with the breath and my eyes closed, guided by Adriene&#39;s voice.  I guess what you should take from this is that it&#39;s important to just show up, even standing still is part of the journey if that&#39;s what your body needs.",Kate,2021-01-06T20:54:13Z,0

Can someone please explain to me what Adriene means by hugging the lower ribs in? Does that just mean sucking in your stomach?

"I&#39;m loving this journey.  I&#39;m learning to love the journey of becoming more flexible in the areas that I struggle with instead of wishing that I could max all the poses right away.  You have been instrumental in this.  I have always had good flexibility in my legs and hips but struggle with some of the arm/shoulder poses like the entwined arms and elbow to outer thigh today.  I&#39;m welcoming the challenge though.  Thank you for this beautiful practise and the whole Breath programme. X ps, such beautiful looking surroundings in these videos.

"This is the first time I&#39;ve got to day 5 in a yoga challenge YAY - feeling the lockdown love and support from fellow lockdown detainees in the UK but also the huge togetherness and compassion from our global family, connected through this beautiful (but challenging) daily ritual. It&#39;s definitely becoming an important part of my day, and something to look forward to as the dark night closes in (I do mine at 6pm UK time). Much love and light to you all xxx",Annabel Daly,2021-01-06T18:44:27Z,10
"Congrats! Yoga&#39;s the only exercise routine I&#39;ve been able to commit to on a daily basis. Sometimes I miss a day or two, but it&#39;s become such a habit that I can trust myself to go back to it. I can get stronger and tone my body in a more gradual, less painful way without feeling like I&#39;m not doing it good enough. And if you stick with Adriene long enough, you&#39;ll start hearing her in your head telling you to breathe or not to crunch your neck, among many of her other sayings. Good luck! You can get to Day 30! :)",InvdrDana,2021-01-07T00:47:16Z,1
"It&#39;s amazing how quickly this journey has changed my yoga practice! I have been practicing for a year now, thought I was getting quite good, and now I am 5 days into Breath and even the &quot;simplest&quot; poses feel way different, better! I loved day 3.

"Right now I feel very lost. I feel like I&#39;ve done things the wrong way for a long time and I want so hard to be better and find my path but whenever I feel I&#39;m progressing, hopelessness and distrust in myself comes again.

Deep down I believe that if I keep trying I will be better and naturally I will interact with beautiful people like you guys. 🧡",Montse Gutiérrez,2021-01-06T18:44:10Z,0

"Day 5: okay, so today sucked and I said some VERY rude things to Adriene and also myself in the privacy of my home, which is unfair and I&#39;m very glad she didn&#39;t hear them.  Sometimes yoga goes like that.<br /><br />I have the most trouble, I think, when I don&#39;t understand what sort of position I&#39;m supposed to be moving into.  There was a lot of pausing the video and clicking back, sometimes multiple times, to figure out what was going on.  There was a lot of not feeling like I had time to listen to my breathing and my body because I had to worry about trying to understand what I was meant to do next.  There was a lot of feeling out of sync, and getting way more out of sync as I tried to catch up.<br /><br />Which begs the question: why is it so important to me to catch up?  Why is it so important that I do every single step and every single pose of every single practice, so much so that I get mad at myself and my very kind yoga instructor if I ever miss a beat?  If I hate pausing and clicking back and getting out of the flow to stop and figure things out and then having to start up again, then what&#39;s wrong with just keeping going and getting back into it a few beats later?<br /><br />It&#39;s yoga.  Doing some of it is better than doing none of it.  There is no grand high Yoga Council watching me try to pass a Yoga Test that says I must complete every single element.  And yet I still feel like, if I don&#39;t get all of today&#39;s practice RIGHT, or at least mostly right, then I won&#39;t improve enough for the future and then I won&#39;t be able to do tomorrow&#39;s practice, or next week&#39;s, or next month&#39;s.<br /><br />Today we are noticing feelings, and those are the feelings I&#39;m noticing.  They exist.  I&#39;m writing them down.  Tomorrow we will notice different feelings, and maybe they&#39;ll be better or maybe they&#39;ll be worse, but they&#39;re feelings.  And it&#39;s good to have a name for them.<br /><br />And they&#39;re a little better now.",Clarity C,2021-01-06T18:39:23Z,0
"@Hearts Love Oh my god, I think &#39;skip ahead and watch how things are done before you start a new video&#39; might actually be life-changing advice.  It&#39;s so incredibly simple.  It fixes so much.  THANK YOU.<br /><br />And thanks for your kind words of support in general.  I started keeping track of my reactions to practice down in the comments threads on Day 1 as a way to sort out my own responses, not necessarily expecting anyone else to care.  I knew there&#39;d be days that ended in total frustration, but it means a lot to hear I&#39;m not alone.  (Which I KNEW--always refresh for the video counter!--but is still very nice.)  &lt;3 Thank you!",Clarity C,2021-01-06T19:14:00Z,0
"Hey, if you are new to yoga, this is definitely a lot! This might sound like a lot of effort, but i actually do it when i want to see what poses will be used in a new video. Skip ahead and watch how the poses are done. But definitely, just hang in there. If you stop a pose halfway, that is fine. You can always come to mountain pose (standing) or child pose if you are a bit off, or stop on squats, with hands in prayer if the arm position is too complicated. These are new poses and terms for you. There were a few I wasn’t sure about, and i did yoga for several years (but several years ago....much stiffness!). Focus on working on improving the basics, like downward dog and your posture there, rather than all the twists. Its a journey, so enjoy this one, rather than try to do everything 100%. As time goes on, you will find many of these basics, like warrior, plank, downward dog are the basis to the others. Hugs to you!",Hearts Love,2021-01-06T18:48:07Z,0
"New shapes for me today. Some lil bit of shakes, but feeling calm and peaceful after. Trying to use my “Uji” breath throughout, doing pretty good.

I have to make some adjustments here and there, but I&#39;m thrilled to be here with all of you! Even more, I know this helps me bring loving energy and movement to a stiff shoulder after all these months of easing back and letting it heal.  So thank you! &lt;3",besty.b,2021-01-06T17:50:18Z,0

I found myself so frustrated that I couldn&#39;t lift either hand off the mat in downward dog I thought I would cry. Having covid last April and dealing with long-covid for over 6 months completely drained me of my fitness and strength.

I watched the intro to the Breath series video and then I started practice with this video because it was the shortest so far and it&#39;s been a long time since I last practiced. A small tear came to my eye when Adriene said to celebrate just showing up. It&#39;s been hard for me to just show up. I look forward to the rest of the series.

During that locust pose my mind shot back in time to my first 30 days of yoga. I&#39;m hit with the thought that I was a completely different person then. It felt like remembering a friend from the past that I&#39;ve grown apart from. No ill will or shame. Just remembrance and reverence for them beginning this journey all those years ago.,Curt Rivadeneira,2021-01-06T16:42:40Z,1

"Oh no, I&#39;ve had back troubles too and wonder if the practice helps or could harm. Take care, listen to your body. I do know that it nurtures my mind and spirit.

I’m a middle size woman and today I felt so self conscious about my body during the practice Some poses where so hard to do because my hanging belly and big breasts were definitely in the way and I wanted to cry because I didn’t know how to modify and my poses weren’t looking as Adriene’s poses so I felt not good enough. But I came back to my breath and I remembered that my body does its own yoga and it’s as good as anyone else 🥰 . <br />I absolutely love doing Yoga with Adriene. Thanks for all the work you do for us to enjoy xxx,Eva Von Lips,2021-01-06T15:59:16Z,643
I had to modify also when I couldn&#39;t do a pose. I just kept doing the last pose  until I got to something I could do.,Frances Bell,2021-04-08T14:39:50Z,1
You&#39;re beautiful the way you are. It is a journey. Dont be too hard on yourself. We all have our own insecurities and body issues. Youre doing great 💕,Grace Clawson,2021-01-20T04:41:18Z,1
"Same! Sometimes it makes it hard to breathe or feel good about the pose, and I get frustrated. Those crunched/crossed over poses just aren&#39;t going to hit the same. I keep trying though.",Rachel Walden,2021-01-09T18:33:36Z,1
"@Shelly Yes, I&#39;ve had some professionals tell me that yoga may not be for me. But I think in general it has helped more than hurt. Listen to your body (easier said than done). For me, I know I have to be gentle in extension and twists. And I try not to be too hard on myself for my core seeming &quot;weak&quot;... it&#39;s all related. Tricky to strengthen core when your back is in pain. Good luck on your journey.",Jen Medos,2021-01-08T04:25:44Z,1

I love the slow flow new beginners thinking approach incorporated with Qigong, Pranayama, slow breathing, relaxing, meditating and working and pushing exercises and positions with control.

"I love seeing how my body changes from day to day and that I get to notice it through the daily practice. Yesterday, planks were hard work and I needed to take breaks even during short ones, whereas today they felt much smoother and stronger. That forearm plank though had me shaking!

"I&#39;ve been  wrestling with a crazy  muscle pudding in the back for the last like 6 months, that&#39;s been causing me lots of pain/troubles. I&#39;m seeing physios, massos etc. It improves, but slowly.<br /><br />Yoga has probably helped too - not that it&#39;s a cure-all (I had so much tension that I really do think I needed some specialized help to get ride of it). However it&#39;s a great tool to help me monitor the improvements and how things evolve. Especially with all the reminder to be very conscious of our posture, of how we place our feet/hands/legs/etc. I feel like my perception of the thousands of little peculiarities of my bodies is much better. I am confident this will help me avoid a rerun of that episode, and not get into huge imbalances like that  in the first place.",logicOnAbstractions,2021-01-06T12:48:31Z,2
That’s great that you are taking the time to relieve and treat the pain and tension. I know that before I started doing yoga and going to an osteopath that I had kind of just accepted that my shoulders were super tight etc and that’s just how it would always be.<br /><br />I hope that your journey continues to move forward and that you experience less pain!,Vardagaladhiel,2021-01-06T12:59:29Z,1

"Not sure whether my room was warmed up or the today&#39;s practice was harder, but I was actually sweating. :D<br />And I must say, so far, this journey feels soo right for me - my body and mind... The flow and everything.... Haven&#39;t felt like this before. <br />I can&#39;t compere it to much of an anything - I&#39;ve only finished the first 30 Days of Yoga, practiced witch some videos for beginners and Foundations of Yoga. And there is so many possibilities why this feels so great. <br />Maybe everything would feel like it at this moment for me being the way I am now - both physically and mentally. Maybe the difference makes the fact, that I&#39;ve been on this journey since the beginning with the rest of the world, waiting every day for the new video and email (and not practice it later on compare to and as I did with the first 30DoY and I&#39;m gonna with the rest of them). Maybe all the 30DoY programs are that great (I&#39;ll see when I get to them after this one). Maybe BREATH is truly that awesome! &lt;3 Or maybe it&#39;s all of these together. <br />I dunno but still, it&#39;s amazing and I am so grateful in general and to YOU - Adriene! &lt;3 In the core of all of your practices, it&#39;s your attitude, your calm voice, your knowledge, guidance and structure, which makes in general all of the videos amazing to begin with. :) <br />Thank you soo much, Adriene! &lt;3 :)",Daniela Mocková,2021-01-06T11:14:13Z,2

Adriene, after the twist on flexed knees: &quot;Alright, halfway lift&quot;, Me: &quot;Alright, child&#39;s pose&quot;. All jokes aside, this was a great practice and I only took two breaks because my body is tired and sore after practicing every day, so I&#39;m pretty proud of myself and deserve that high five.

I always love that gorgeous Sphinx Pose, a feeling of grace, then that awesome shoulder stretch, correcting our Mr Burns 😂 I was a little trembly in that last but one downward dog, meeting my edge, so I relaxed into a child’s pose when it came to the ‘one-arm’ downward dog, I need more arm strength for that one. But I met on our bellies for the cooling down rest and all was good.

"Today I got so excited not about doing yoga but actually reading the comments here after yoga that I felt a little bit impatient and hence unfocused haha. But mostly in a good way, just excited! I&#39;ve been practicing with Adriene since 2017 and it&#39;s my 4th yoga challenge live in January but it&#39;s the first time I&#39;m reading and responding to comments (and writing my own) - all of you guys bring so much positive energy to my day, it&#39;s crazy! <br />Today I was a little bit sore from the last practices (I haven&#39;t have a rest day since 26th of December) but I surprised myself with doing chaturanga (in polish it&#39;s called &quot;pozycja kija&quot; which literally means &quot;the stick pose&quot;, I think it&#39;s quite accurate!) without cheating and actually bending my arms! I have so weak arms that this pose it&#39;s always killing me and often I can&#39;t do it but today I did. My little victory &lt;3<br />It&#39;s 9:30 AM in Poland and I came here straight after waking up (got a restful sleep eventually, yey!) and now feel super energized for the day ahead! THANK YOU!<br />Namaste &lt;3<br />PS my fav moment of this practice was actually the intro when you high five! &lt;3",Lizzy Mad Hatter,2021-01-06T08:32:34Z,1

"Dear Adriene, I have been converted to your yoga sessions for over a year now, and reaping so many benefits from them- thank you so much for being such a light in our lives! But can I just check with you- in your letter for day 5, you say we breathe in &#39;oxygen&#39;, and breathe out &#39;carbon monoxide&#39;, but I&#39;m sure it was just a slip on the keyboard, and you mean &#39;dioxide&#39; in fact?!

"Aww loved this, thanks Adrienne! As just woke up, I had to stretch a lil extra to match your pace. Also, to anyone that is heavier than average, don’t feel bad if it’s hard on your wrists. Adapt the moves to seated or stood. You are holding up a lot more that our slim yogi here. I no way could lift one hand in down dog, as can only just do it with two hands! Don’t let it put you off, plenty still to be gained from yoga and this breath journey. Similar if you have a larger chest, you physically won’t get your arms round as far, as two bossoms in the way! Or laying on front might be uncomfortable cos can’t get head to floor. Don’t worry about the poses, keep the breath and intention, and modify. It’s your body &amp; practice. Much love 💚💚💚",Cat Kimpton,2021-01-06T08:21:23Z,1

"I did Day 3 yesterday morning and Day 4 yesterday evening b/c it was only 26 minutes and I wanted to ‘catch up’ with the largest chunk of the community.  Day 5 is similarly short in length.  Maybe it’s easier to have a double-video day this first week, before we progress to more difficult things we’re conditioning ourselves towards.  I took a screenshot of how many views the video had at the beginning and the end, &amp; it appears 10,000+ people were viewing with me today.  But lots of people will start the challenge other days in January &amp; I guarantee you won’t be alone.  Of course, it’s your practice!
