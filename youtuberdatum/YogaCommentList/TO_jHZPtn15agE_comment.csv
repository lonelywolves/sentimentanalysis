Why do I find it so difficult to do any kind of seated bends? Does anyone have suggestions of how I can improve this area of flexibility?

They’re so easy to follow and I never feel like I can’t do any of your moves because you give options for poses if our bodies aren’t up to a certain pose.

"This has to be one of my all-time favourite Adriene practices, as much as I love the fiery, more sweat-inducing practices! As a self-confessed morning person who prefers morning yoga, ever since I came across this one in one of your monthly calendars, I regularly return to this video in the evenings in my pyjamas, finishing with the meditation section in my bed covered with my duvet. HEAVEN. I never fail to get a wonderful night&#39;s sleep after doing this and, trust me when I say, I haven&#39;t felt truly rested when I wake up for about 15 years now!! This evening, I found something new and did my meditation slap-bang in the middle of my bed, taking up as much space as I can. Felt very strange for me who, even as a single person who sleeps alone, always sleeps on one side of the bed curled up in a foetal position! Sorry for the ramble, but I just wanted to say THANK YOU for this practice and all that you do! Bring on day 1 of January 2020 &#39;Breath&#39; &lt;3 xx",Rosie Allen,2021-01-01T20:30:35Z,0

"Hi Adriene! I do yoga with you n the mornings before work, but as the weather gets colder (and thus my living room gets colder in the early mornings) it’s getting harder and harder to get motivated to do yoga right off the bat. Can you make a 10-15 min video of yoga for cold weather, that maybe warms us up right away? Thank you for sharing your practice!",Celia G,2020-12-03T15:11:25Z,0

"I had a severe allergic reaction two days ago that send me to ER. As someone who struggle with anxiety, fear of hospitals (and right now with COVID I was even more scared than ever)... I found myself being able to stay calm and apply your breathing techniques while the nurses and doctors were trying to save me. In the past, I would&#39;ve had a huge panic attack (which would make the allergic reaction just worst), but the only thing I heard in my head during that time was Adriene sweet calming voice whispering to me that « stay calm, breathing is healing... just breath » . I can&#39;t thank you enough Adriene for your practice and for just being you. You helped me recover faster and come home to my beloved boyfriend also named Adrien. I have 2 amazing &#39;&#39;Adriens&#39;&#39; in my life and I feel so lucky to have you both. Thank you &lt;3",Augustine Pilon,2020-08-09T16:23:29Z,2

Thank you for this beautiful and calming video. working in the healthcare field can be silently draining. I won&#39;t realize how exhausted I am until I am laying in bed. Practicing with you and this wonderful community helps me decompress and release some of the weight of the day - making the next day just a bit easier so I can show up for myself and remain grounded while I care for patients. &lt;3,Samantha Garcia,2020-05-29T02:07:36Z,1

I am blessed right now. Today morning I decided to bake and I did so. After putting the batter over gas I switched to this cozy practice. In between I smelled something different. I immediately visited the kitchen and I found the gas was leaking and I switched off the knob. After that I felt silence in me and get back to the practice with gratitude. Though in between I again visited the kitchen; as now I was little anxious also. Though I did the practice in break but still it served the purpose! Thank you sweetheart and every reader for reading.

Due to anxiety my immune system has been really suppressed lately, and so what would be a &quot;normal&quot; cold turned into an ordeal with an ear and eye infection. Yuck. So I&#39;ve spent the last week or so hunched on the couch or shuffling back and forth from my bed to the kitchen, feeling sorry for myself. Doing this cozy yoga flow brought some circulation back, released some tension in my neck, and even made my nasal passages feel more clear from all the good deep breathing. I&#39;m on the mend!

"Yoga is detaching you from the spiritual connection/world, or the true unseen communication system in other words, in which you should stay inside 24/7 and not some random concentration/focus on whatever you feel good about. That&#39;s not the right source. <br />This should be body stretching only. <br />When you walking on the streets you feel ashamed talking to a homeless...&quot;distant love&quot;. That again brings us back to the idea of &quot;detaching&quot; from others through yoga. More you do it, detaching will become permanent.  Yoga is a way of praying if you are using the yoga approach, and not just a simple body stretching approach. Yoga approach involves spiritual openings. <br />You are opening gates in your body for other spiritual worlds.<br />Love is coming from only one source: God, which you have it I believe, bcs yoga people are kind and loving, but that love is very thin bcs when someone is kind, it means is close..but If you would ask the love straight from God through Jesus Christ, you would certainly even take home a homeless person time to time and help him with a shower and some hot nice meal at least bcs you would understand in your heart truly, that any person is another creation of God. Distant love will fade away.<br /> We are on earth to help and love people bcs we are family from God. This is one of our 3 jobs we have on earth...the other two are to take care of the nature..and animals. <br />By practicing yoga you are breaking the connection between you and other human beings. Is like you are going for a holiday and you don&#39;t give a f*k about the fact that your mum is struggling at home.<br />In that period you are not creating in favour of humanity/earth, you are not bonding with other humans, you are not synchronized with others. Yoga is one of the reasons marriages are less. &quot;Yoga people&quot; will become detached from earth reality but our job is to connect with other people, we must stay here bcs the world needs help...help other people. I know &quot;yoga people&quot; personally and they feel superior.. (in silence)...to others by believing they have power above others because of yoga. They will connect only with same mentality but they are not talking about Jesus ever and that&#39;s the biggest mistake of the all existence.",v1art24,2019-12-28T13:58:01Z,0

"Hi! In general, most women are able to continue a regular practice through month eight if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. <br /><br />As always, consult your doctor/physician before starting and follow their advice. xx",Yoga With Adriene,2019-12-27T13:08:11Z,1

"I haven&#39;t done YWA since last March. I just got busy. And today, I was supposed to go to the gym. I really wanted to go, but a major health issue in my family stopped that. So I told myself I could do jump rope and a HIIT workout from home. But honestly, I&#39;m drained. These past three days have been very rough physically and emotionally and I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to put on a sports bra and then have to wash my hair after. So I told myself to get dressed for bed and perhaps I could do some yoga or stretching. I looked at an app I use, but nothing really stood out to me. Then I decided to just hop on YT and see if YWA had anything short and simple. And what pops up but this very video uploaded today. I always thought people were exaggerating when they say this, but this--this specific--video was exactly what I needed, PJs and pillows and all.

"It&#39;s that time of the year again where we enter the &quot;cozy&quot; state just before we transition into the new calendar year. I can&#39;t wait for Home to roll in in January. I will take this moment to wish Adriene and everyone else practicing a merry Christmas and the happiest of new years. It has truly been an amazing journey this year with Adriene and the FWFG community. I grew emotional at the end of the practice, looking back at everything i&#39;ve done in 2019. I found that I am worthy, excited, ready, and grateful to enter the new year with a new, fresh, deep breath. We&#39;ve all got this everyone. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-12-22T06:49:23Z,1
