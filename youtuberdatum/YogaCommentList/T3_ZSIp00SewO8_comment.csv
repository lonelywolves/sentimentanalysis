"this yoga practice has made me realise so much about my body and health. Because of covid I have been working on my computer and studying 7 hrs regularly without much outdoor time. I developed severe neck pain and upon x-ray, my neck spine has straightened. I have had neck and shoulder pain for months now. I tried various exercises but I could not find the right way to do yoga and truly rejuvenate my body until I found this channel. While doing this practice, I found out how much of my flexibility I&#39;ve lost. Like, while doing the tabletop position my wrists could not hold up, and I&#39;m only 17. This is helping me in tremendous ways and transforming my lifestyle for the better. <br><br>I&#39;m so grateful for this channel for providing such quality yoga practice free of cost. I wish Adriene and everyone reading this all the best. God bless.",aditi solanki,2021-05-08T12:46:37Z,0

I had difficulty holding a few positions but I expect my strength to increase over time. I really enjoyed being present in each moment and being intentional with each breath, my mood feels noticeably better :)<br><br><br>Day 2: seem a little easier and quicker :) I think I improved a tiny bit and as for my mood today it’s okay , I’m not happy nor sad. I’m content :)<br><br>Day 3 : was still a bit challenging but I do sense a tiny improvement in my strength in holding these positions. My mood is the same as yesterday.

"I was intimidated by the length of the video since I hadn’t done yoga consistently for a while. I’m so glad I did it anyway. I struggle a lot with dissociating and depersonalization, and your yoga practices help me so much to be present in my body, to forgive myself, to love myself. Last year I did it much more consistently, and it helped me heal from an eating disorder I’d had for a decade for that reason. I was able to be present in my body, ask for forgiveness and give forgiveness. I recently was diagnosed with bipolar, and I am trying to start my practice again, because I have been so overwhelmed and angry with my mind and body again. I feel angry that the depression I felt isn’t going to go away. But yoga reminds me so much to be gentle, to forgive, and to be in this moment. At the end of this video, when we were in corpse pose, I heard the birds outside my window, and I really heard them, as well as feeling my own breath. It’s the most present I’ve felt in so long and I just started crying because I felt like I had come home. Thank you for all you do and the work you do to help heal people with your spirit of gentleness, and introducing yoga in an approachable and inclusive way. Thank you so much.",rach3vz,2021-04-23T15:15:41Z,3

"I&#39;ve been doing yoga for some time and I just low-key feel this hurry that I need to finish up and move on to my next task. As a result I ALWAYS choose fast paced classes, slow classes tend to give me anxiety lol. I&#39;ve done hour long yin yoga and that feeling still never goes away entirely.

I am looking forward to this and will enjoy the commitment.  I suffered from fibromyalgia for long years and now that I feel better, this practice seems really good for me.

"I&#39;m in the middle of a decently horrific clinical depression / anxiety flareup and I didn&#39;t know if I&#39;d get through the practice (coming back to the mat after a long absence).

Don&#39;t know how many of you follow the old 30 days and came over here? The old days were about 30 minutes was good for doing it before went to work. These new series are 50 + minutes .

"Starting this on April 12th, after a month and a half of daily high intensity workouts (Madfit). While I have gained a lot of strength, I couldn&#39;t seem to focus on my real life and my family during this time. All that I could think about was my physique and my next meal. I need a change, so I&#39;m starting this journey and inviting my two toddlers and my six month old to join me. 😌 Nursing baby to sleep halfway through.

"Thank you so much for this series. I only started this journey today and I am already feeling something ... I am suffering from severe depression and decided to do something for myself for once and it lead me here. By the end of this experience when you said &quot;invite yourself to let go, give your self a moment to do absolutely nothing&quot; I was so overcome with emotion that I teared up. It just goes to show how hectic this world is, not even allowing us a moment to ourselves. Thanks to you, I   dedicated 50min purely to myself, thank you so much for that. I am so excited to come back for the next 29 days and see where it takes me! Stay safe and healthy!!",Anny Huang,2021-04-12T10:43:52Z,0

"Hi! I&#39;m from the future (day 16) and I wanted to share my (summarized) experience with this journey so far. I&#39;m gonna copy paste a comment I posted on day 15 in case someone needs a bit of motivation:<br /><br /><i>“I noticed how has my body and mind had changed since I started this journey. I feel better, calmer. I don&#39;t get angry so easily, and I&#39;m more aware of my body. I think I look prettier than before, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s cause of the yoga itself or it&#39;s me that&#39;s changing. My shoulders are a bit sore, but I feel stronger. It&#39;s easier for me to sit with my back straight (because I&#39;m an artist and I spend hours hunched over the table, painting or drawing) and this is helping me a lot with that. Now I&#39;m more cheerful than before. Today I found myself dancing and singing alone in the kitchen while doing the dishes, smiling and feeling so energetic! I love this feeling. I think that now I&#39;m gonna add this beautiful and wholesome habit to my daily routine for the rest of my life, cause this is absolutely perfect for my mind and body. Every time I finish one practice, I look forward to the next one.”</i>",Daiana Chaves,2021-04-07T02:22:16Z,0

Lol.<br />I may not do this everyday but I plan to do them in order like every other day mostly.<br />So blessed to have found this. My anxiety and stress has been through the roof this past week. I have not felt this relaxed. <br />Thank you. 🙏,Yvette Bennett,2021-03-31T18:19:59Z,1

It felt so soothing, too. I was just moving out for the first time, and it gave me such a feeling of freedom. Now I am just about to move in to my own space, after living a long time in shared flats... Again, this feeling of freedom supports me. Your practice really, really is so valuable. it really helps me to create a safe space within myself. I deeply want to thank you for that. &lt;3",solasnova,2021-03-20T11:02:27Z,0

"Funnily enough, I felt a fair amount of aggression after finishing this practice. The aggro mentality came from my mind persisting to want to rushing through, feeling impatient and frustrated. Afterwards, I took a beat, gave myself some time to think on my feelings, and accept them for what they are. So while it may have felt frustrating in the moment, I&#39;m really thankful that you hold space for every range of emotion that may come out, and allow us to take the time to work through those feelings.",Stephanie Carlson,2021-03-13T06:55:39Z,0

I just started watching again after a couple weeks of positive change for me that I wanted to keep rolling. I used to watch daily years ago!<br /><br />Our heeler had never seen me do yoga since we got her. She was majorly confused 😂 I had my eyes closed in the beginning and smelled stank breath so I opened my eyes and she was staring right at me wondering what the heck I was doing haha,Samantha,2021-03-06T22:31:01Z,0
super thanks for this free yoga workout. I follow Adriene for several years and her workouts are so nice and gentle. They make me relax like almost nothing else can do. How can anyone give this video a dislike? Its free and brought with love. Even if you don&#39;t like it. Then just do nothing with it. But please do not dislike. Adriene doesn&#39;t deserve that! Thanks for sharing al your workouts with us Adriene. All the best for you.,Team Avondje Uit,2021-03-06T22:13:12Z,0

"Right as I was doing the namaste, i had this thought about not giving up on myself ever again, and honestly that made me tear up and it felt so cleansing. <br />For the context, I hadn&#39;t practiced yoga in 9 months and I was ( /am) at rock bottom for the whole time, everything felt lifeless and useless.<br />I am so grateful to you Adrienne for the goodness you put out there.

I&#39;m looking forward to starting Bridge and Move, already have my calendars printed! It really feels so good to check in with yourself everyday. And the perspectives Adriene shares like finding the beauty in your current moment, in the life around you is honestly something that&#39;s saved me through my life. <br /><br />I look forward to growing my strength in that aspect. I&#39;m about Adriene&#39;s age, also half Mexican on my mom&#39;s side, and I&#39;ve developed chronic pain and disorders over the past several years and it&#39;s been hard trying to find a new normal. I&#39;ve used my breath and mindfulness as anchor in my life and practiced yoga and meditation through various means and in several classes but now I feel like now I&#39;ve really found my path to grow in mindfulness and yoga. I&#39;ve never found something that fit this well.

"Well, I broke down and got a yoga mat. I&#39;ve always been doing yoga on a beach towel on carpet, but I got a mat today. I&#39;m not new to yoga, but the last time I showed up was last year... And boy did I feel let down today. I thought - oh I&#39;m sort of beginner/intermediate I can just pick it up and go for it... I felt like today was my first day ever and, not going to lie, I felt super discouraged. Swore at myself, and didn&#39;t understand why I was so shaky, tight and frustrated. Now I remember why I bought the mat, and started again and this is why. Everything today felt super difficult, when a year ago this would&#39;ve been nothing but a warm-up.

"Hi Adriene Thank you very much for your email, yes I did the day 1 this week on Tuesday, I was already on my day 2 when I decided to sign in o your link page. I am enjoying so much this 30 days breath yoga with you and very exciting everyday to show up on my mat.

"Starting this today. I&#39;ve been following you for 5-6 years but haven&#39;t been as focused on yoga for the past few months (who can blame me?). Yesterday I decided to look up the last video in this series, because I knew it would be a &quot;mic off&quot; video and that sounded nice. So today I decided to start the series from the top, and, wow, THIS is the level of detail I can&#39;t find anywhere else. Thank you, Adriene!",Carla Miller,2021-02-26T15:33:58Z,0

I just started today and I felt really good. My head is more clear and I feel more productive. Also while I was doing this my body was shaking and I did fall a couple of times but I kept going. I am literally typing this as I just finished the video for my first day doing yoga. Thank you Adrienne! This made me smile when I usually am not the type of person to smile or think positive. I&#39;m a start again tomorrow for the day 2 video. And this is coming from someone who never exercised my whole life. I&#39;m about to turn 20 years old soon and I want to start taking my health more seriously. So again thank you Adrienne! Also to everyone who just started or is about to start. Kudos to you! You can do it! :),J A,2021-02-25T01:43:48Z,0

My dog Aashka was very excited about day 1 and while I had my eyes closed she laughed her paws up onto my chest and gave me a big smooch then plonked herself very close to my body in the middle of my crossed legs - I&#39;d say that was a big tick of approval.  She also thought it was a fun game when I was raising my arms up and down - until I accidentally elbowed her in the snout while trying to raise my arm around her bouncing body.

Hey Laura.  New feelings are all part of the experience. Feeling nauseous is not part of it as such. You will be stretching and activating parts of the body and organs than don’t usually do this stuff.  Plus think about your eating regime before the practice. Finally I’d suggest not overly pushing to match Adriene’s poses. Do what feels good for your body. Hope this helps; see you tomorrow 🤞🏻🙏🏻,Rich Neasom,2021-02-10T17:34:21Z,0

"hello adriene and friends! I have a question and am wondering if anyone has similar experience. When I am practicing yoga, often times my arms and legs &quot;fall asleep&quot; and get very tingly to the point where it is difficult to hold the poses. I don&#39;t believe I am overextending, I wonder if this is due to a poor connection to the earth/I am not grounding myself in the poses correctly?

The first half of the practice was a struggle, but Adriene’s kind and guiding voice along with these comments from others starting today got me through. If there is anyone out there who needs someone rooting for them, just know that I’ll be here. A healthy and happy you is something worth fighting for. ❤️",Anna Claps,2021-02-02T02:06:08Z,2

"For those who are not sure which to choose between Adrienne&#39;s and Tim&#39;s 30 challenges (My own opinion):<br />1. Both are amazing teachers. You will learn a lot. <br />2. Adriene&#39;s is more spiritual and mental. She highly encourages you to take your time and tune into your body. Hence a lot more breathing, positive affirmations, overall slowe and mindful moving. You will feel positive and balanced. Meditetitive. <br />3. Tim&#39;s is about more body building and conscious movement. He gives good advices about our body anatomy and how not to &#39;abuse&#39; our body. Transitions are faster and more strength building oriented. You will feel energized and positive. <br /><br />My advice: If you are new to yoga, I advise you to start with Adriane&#39;s and continue to Tim&#39;s. f you are pretty good at yoga, I would mix them day by day. Great variation of mind and body focus.",Na Btam,2021-02-02T00:01:20Z,0

Each and every of these programmes was a little bit different and each was amazing. <br />And this one is starting also amazing.<br /> I loved how we had to stay a little longer in plank and twists in lunges... it was quite challenging for me but also so refreshing and putting things in perspective.<br />I have been practising with you for 5 years (I even recorded a video about this but I would add so many new things now ;)) and every practise with you teaches me something new. I am confident enough to say that you, Adriene, became sort of my spiritual guide. Your videos resonate with me on another level. It always is exactly what I need. You taught me so much. I am so excited but also humbled to join you on another journey. <br />Thank you, you honestly change my life (and have been doing so for F I V E years!!!).",Marta's Feelings,2021-02-01T14:42:15Z,0

I started in December  with Dedicate and January with True and here I am in February: Breath). The funny thing is that I had never practiced not even known what yoga was, in my mind it was only meditating stuff, well in case you&#39;re new too I can feel the change in my body and in my mental health. This year has been a tough one and we all need to have a daily time for us and get away from the world right now. It&#39;s one of the best moments  in my day. So let&#39;s keep on.

"Started late and kinda bounced around, doing Days 3-10. I kept looking back at Days 1 &amp; 2 with 48 &amp; 37 min, was just needing more available time, so today a Sunday morning was perfect! Day 2 tomorrow then I&#39;m back on track for Day 11 onward. Love Adriene, her voice and pace works for me, always encouraging us to do what feels good. I&#39;m the most inflexible person and HATE getting on the floor - sitting cross-legged was always painful for me but it was required as a kid in my culture growing up. In my 4th decade now and finally doing something about it! Haha! Love that sense of humor btw, her little freak-ness peaked out on that hand massage part...

"I started today, pretty much at beginner level since I haven&#39;t done yoga since 2018. It was a great workout that brought to my attention areas of my body that hurt and need more stretching. So thanks! I will persevere and see if the pain in my wrists and shoulder blades disappear with time. So looking forward to Day 2!",Cinta García de la Rosa,2021-01-27T10:53:05Z,0

I managed to do this practise on Sunday the first proper yoga session that hasn&#39;t been restorative yoga since I got Post Viral Fatigue a year and 4 months ago and I gave myself a pat on the back because I had no CFS Post Exertional Malaise from doing it. I feel so proud that I&#39;ve progressed this far that I can now manage some form of exercise. Even more I did the entire thing and It was only today that I realised it was a 48 minute session. I can feel I&#39;m making progress slowly but it&#39;s great! I will take a browse over day 2 and make sure it&#39;s manageable for me at the weekend. Loving that I can do things for myself again. &lt;3,Killtocraft,2021-01-26T21:05:56Z,0

"Omg my body feels so much better. Before the pandemic I was looking for workshops and classes to challenge me and incorporate more advance poses and techniques. Then the virus through my life into complete disarray, with a small business and a regular 9-5 that was now home based and no studios to keep me focused I completely fell out of practice. It took a while but my body is stiff and my sternum has been painful and popping constantly from crunching over keyboards or lifting 75lbs or more dogs to where they needed to go. In short not taking care of myself at all. This was a lovely reminder of what I need to do for my body. I accept the 30 day challenge.

"Is this supposed to be for beginners? Also why do you have to waste 10 minutes of talking in the beginning? I think maybe you should put a timecode of where you start the actual session.

@sana I don&#39;t know how to manage. They could be finebat one moment and then there not. My occupational therapist  said I needed to wear wrist braces on both wrists but that&#39;s hard to do. I hate breces on my wrists,Desiree Mathews,2021-01-18T17:04:02Z,0

"hi all! Just dropping this question here in case anyone more experienced has an answer. I&#39;m a beginner at yoga and have had an on and off relationship with it. I&#39;m slowly trying to create some consistency. What I noticed though in poses where the head is upside down is that blood from the rest of my body tends to rush down toward the head way too quickly for my liking, sometimes making me extremely dizzy. Is this a breath thing? Do I need to work with breath regulation more? Hope someone sees this! Cheers xx",Ariana Papastergiou,2021-01-17T10:50:08Z,0
"@Carin G hi there, thanks for commenting. Yes, light headed and like my whole face fills with blood. Sometimes I feel like a tomato about to explode😂 what you describe however used to happen to me too but because Adriene transitions slowly between poses, I don&#39;t experience it that much. I will look into orthostatic hypotension though.",Ariana Papastergiou,2021-01-19T08:02:55Z,1
"When you say dizzy, do you mean light headed or spinning? I experience light headedness when coming up from being upside down. I have orthostatic hypotension which means my blood pressure drops as I stand up. I&#39;ve come close to fainting! It&#39;s more likely to happen to me in the mornings. I seem to do better in the afternoons, and I&#39;ve learned to take it very slowly and make sure I am breathing. I hope you find answers.",Carin G,2021-01-18T23:27:31Z,1

"I&#39;m so late to start but I had the stupid virus. I really couldn&#39;t wait to feel better and to catch up. Although before, some of Adriene&#39;s sessions were too easy for me, I really enjoy following her for her good advice, good heart, great sense of humour, now actually I had to do this session in three consecutive days, to cut it in three parts- that&#39;s how tired I felt after the virus. But, hey, I finished this one and just wanted to say THANK YOU, ADRIENE, for being in my lifetime!!!! Tomorrow I hope I will do a complete session at one go. Keep going all of you and never give up!",Desi Dimova,2021-01-15T17:51:55Z,0

"That was the longest practice I&#39;ve ever done in my own space and completely chosen by me. I loved the gentle slowness of it! But those lunges were especially hard today! I sat on the ground for over three hours watching the Lord of the Rings (extended) with some friends last night, so I&#39;m especially glad to work through some of the tightness from that haha! Sometimes deep breaths are hard. Anxious feelings and flutterings catch on the breath, making it more shallow and uneven. Syncing my breath with movement is so helpful for me to find greater space in my lungs and torso, and I think that is what drew me here. Also, I&#39;m seeing so many comments saying they&#39;re late...but I think you&#39;re right on time! It is good for you _when_ever you are. That is how I feel, even though this is my first time doing one of the 30 journeys :-)",Valaya Hart,2021-01-15T16:44:00Z,0

"Just my perspective: It’s just making the movements your own, not just doing it rote. It’s not just raising your hands above your head because she told you to, but really noticing what you’re doing, as you’re doing it, what muscles are working, what changes if you twist your hand this way or that, or if you consciously relax your shoulders, ect. It’s the small, little movements and thoughts that take it from just stretching and breathing to practicing yoga. Hope that helps! Stick with it and you’ll get it!",Samm Fabish,2021-01-13T15:17:57Z,0
Absolute maximum beginner here strength and stability wise. 2 full-term pregnancies in 1 year wreaked havoc on my body and it&#39;s been rough trying to get back to some sense of core strength.<br />I personally found it hard to continue past 33 minutes. Even sitting still in the beginning made everything burn hard and my legs went a little numb by the end.<br /><br />Do you have any suggestions for further variations for positions like the deep lunge? I can&#39;t position my leg between my hands and remain close enough to plant the fingers on the mat.,FoodingAround,2021-01-13T11:27:23Z,0

I spent the first part of this month doing some of your previous videos  before diving into Breath because I didn&#39;t think I was ready yet. I am obsessed with your bed time/wind down videos. I do one every night before bed and I&#39;m sleeping so much better! During the day I pick a random vid from your various playlists. I&#39;ve started jogging so the pre and post runners videos have been a huge help! Also the videos for neck and back pain have been so helpful because I have terrible posture I know yoga is going to help me correct that! This video was a bit of a challenge for me but I felt amazing after! Why did I sleep on yoga for so long it feels so good I get the hype now.

Put the phone on a stand so you can glance at it. Don&#39;t worry if you can&#39;t match up perfectly. Skip some parts if they&#39;re too hard. Repeat this day one again until it gets easier. Love and accept yourself. You&#39;re trying. ❤️,Maro Sama,2021-01-12T11:20:16Z,0

"I really like this longer day one. Sometimes I have a hard time focusing on getting back into a yoga groove and I am left feeling ancy, half baked and not centered or focused for the journey. (I do fall of the wagon every now and then). I got my fill and I feel very zenny and like I have hit the ground running. A little burn and a lot of focus :)<br />I really needed it (even if I am a little late to the party).<br /><br />~overshare~ I have had a really hard few years beyond just an epidemic. After homelessness for a year followed by being raped by a coworker and being forced to quit my job and then pandemic preventing me from getting another and more I have had a really hard time feeling like things will get better, I am not completely alone and being grateful for what I have. I am trying to wake back up to myself and my life and reclaim my body. I have felt defeated and lost.<br />Thank you for being an inspirational force of positivity and growth Adrianne.

"Very late to this, but this was enjoyable &amp; really helped me to centre myself. Being a bit overweight, I found some of it challenging but in a good way. It helped me to realise how important it is just to do what I can &amp; to slow down. Super helpful for helping me cope with the depressive &amp; anxious slump I&#39;ve been in lately. Thank you Adriene!",GeneralMeow,2021-01-10T13:29:49Z,0

"Thanks Adriene and community. I&#39;m late but I&#39;m going to try! I surprise myself with my strength sometimes and finished the video! PS Does anyone else feel like lunging comfortably is impossible? I can&#39;t put my hand down properly on the side where my knee is bent up unless I bring my arm INSIDE my leg, my boobs and tummy get in the way so it always feels kind of bad including the looking up part. Anyone have any tips for getting around this? I am working on weight loss but it&#39;s a slower journey for me this time around. I have hyper mobility/joint laxity so this might also be why lunging in general is difficult for me.",superdooper,2021-01-10T12:01:46Z,0

"I&#39;m so sore everyone. I&#39;m putting my trust in Adriene&#39;s programming skills and of course my body to get me through this. Ps. I did an extra vid the other day for the spine and i did the crow pose for like .5 second and I was incredibly surprised. But that day I had a really nice moment with a crow, he let me take his photo, and I shared my cinnamon bun. So I&#39;ll remember the day I first managed a blip of crow pose from the metadata on my photo hehe",Tanya White,2021-01-10T06:42:57Z,0

"THANK YOU for having a moment of wrist care during this! I used to get wrist pains that sometimes lasted for a few days bc of not knowing how to properly warm up+ take pressure off of the wrists during down dogs, planks, chaturanga etc. <br />However, now that I’ve made a conscious effort to, one, warm up the wrists and, two, apply pressure throughout my hands correctly, I’m finally free of wrist pain which equals more yoga!😁 <br /><br />anyway all this was to say I really love when a class has a few moments dedicated to wrists. It’s such a delicate part of the body which one doesn’t realize until they’ve got pain there.<br />Much love from Utah to all the fellow yogis 💜",Holly Ashley,2021-01-10T00:40:53Z,0

Thank you so much for this gift of a 30 day journey together. Today is my Day 1🍀,sherilasj,2021-01-09T15:46:53Z,0
"I did it. Day 1. I feel proud. It was more challenging than I thought it would be, taking it slow and being really intentional. Part of me is honestly scared of committing to the 30 days because if I don&#39;t complete it, &quot;I&#39;ll feel shame and it will be evidence that I can&#39;t stick to a goal&quot; (says the part that is afraid of failure and that equates my self worth with what I do or don&#39;t do). It would be a big shift from hardly doing any movement (other than walks) to 45 minutes of yoga EVERY DAY. And, I think, the research on building habits says to start small...like teeny tiny. <br /><br />But what if I treated this like an experiment? How will it feel, what will I notice, what changes might arise if I did this thing I&#39;ve never done before? It could be an opportunity to practice self-compassion, gently encouraging myself to step on the mat even when I don&#39;t want to. And cheering myself on to return to the mat if I miss a day for some reason (which is likely to happen).  I&#39;ve been wanting to get my body moving for a while now...so I&#39;m going to try it. <br /><br />Thanks for the opportunity to think that through! I&#39;m grateful to Adriene and to all of you.",questionNchallenge,2021-01-09T15:32:38Z,0

"Last year I started your 30 days yoga journey in March, when the lockdown started here in Moscow... Not a beginner, but certainly not a regular or advanced yogi. After that journey I kept practicing yoga with you regularly, often on a daily basis. It gave me so much on every level and helped me stay healthy and focused during this very strange year. I started 2021 with a relocation to a new apartment, so after very busy and exciting days only today I am starting this year yoga journey... A little late, but with the resolution to take it all and do my best. New apartment, same old yoga mat and same wonderful Adriene.

"Me either. My feet won&#39;t bend out that way too at all. My left hip will, but my right hip is pretty froze up from chronic bursitis and lack of activity or stretching. I was hoping to start with this. She does have a 15 minute hip focused workout. You might try as much of that as you can do. As embarrassing as it is, I&#39;m now signed up for &quot;chair yoga&quot; at the VA and looking at silver sneakers workouts to try to lose some weight and get active again. Feels weird to resort to geriatric options as a 45 year old, but whatever works, I guess? I hope to try this 30 day routine when I&#39;m more flexible and maybe 30 or 40 pounds lighter (sigh).

"just started this journey today and i feel so good about it! though i wanted to start this on the 1st, the beginning of this year started out pretty rough. from the end of 2020, my mindset for the new year was to &quot;heal myself from everything from my past&quot; and &quot;manifest/grow into the person i want to be&quot;, to work even harder for the things that i want, but after breaking down every single day, i realized that i set up so many expectations for myself and had put too many things on my plate- in just 5 days! i don&#39;t want 2021 to just be huge to-do list, but i just wanted to change so bad and outgrow my old habits. but after talking things through with the people closest to me, i realized that healing/growth will come naturally- when you&#39;re fixated on just that, you miss out on enjoying the smallest moments. i&#39;ll heal and grow without even realizing it once i start enjoying life. today&#39;s practice definitely reminded me to &quot;LET GO&quot; and be present, to be mindful and patient. just wanted to share in case anyone was going through the same thing! i love this uplifting community so much that it made me want to share my experience- first time commenting on any youtube video lol, but we got this!",yanashi,2021-01-07T19:27:27Z,14
"I really feel you. I usually do that same thing of making every year into a never-ending to-do list. I decided I didn&#39;t want that this year. As you said, enjoying life is what matters. And with it growth and healing will come. It&#39;s hard to make up our minds to that but... Let&#39;s enjoy 2021! Let&#39;s enjoy life and it&#39;s little things! Lots of love :) 💞",Celia Saiz,2021-01-10T23:07:35Z,1

"If you&#39;ve also come to this &quot;late,&quot; you are not alone :) one of my mentors says &quot;we are right where we are supposed to be.&quot;<br />I was introduced to YWA years ago. I would call myself a &quot;lapsed yogi.&quot; A friend invited me to this yesterday, and while my initial thought was to be annoyed because &quot;now I&#39;m already &#39;behind&#39;&quot; it was so quickly followed by gratitude. I have been looking for a &quot;good enough&quot; reason to get moving with yoga again and a friend inviting me was perfect. I must say, I think this might be the first 30-day challenge where I sincerely want to commit, do every single day&#39;s vid. even if i skip a day of the week I will continue to the next so it might take me a while to get through this, maybe not all in a row, but that&#39;s ok... being gentle with myself.<br />I found it helpful to reach a bunch of the comments before partaking on this journey. I felt more inspired and like I could actually do this if so many others could. I especially loved reading about how so many people were able to commit based on one person sharing that they were surprised when they saw 48 minutes (super long for YWA) but did it anyway and felt amazing. It&#39;s really neat too to see so many people commenting and sharing from all around the world (hello to you from Pennsylvania, USA!) Thank you all for sharing your experiences.<br />Here are mine:<br />- did this before bed, and it was appropriate. I was concerned I would be too jazzed, but I&#39;m feeling pretty zen RN. Like I could get ready for bed no prob.<br />- looooooooved that this one has a savasana. many YWA vids don&#39;t which is not my preference. <br />- about 33 minutes in I had to pause, I think I had too much fluid in my sinuses, (maybe due to lapsed yoga practice I haven&#39;t spent nearly that much time upside-down lately?) and got a sharp pain shooting up my forehead (but I made it through the rest of the practice just fine - breaks are good)<br />- one note of suggestion, that I hope gets enacted throughout the rest of the month&#39;s practices - I would love for the pauses, for the moments we are encouraged to breathe, to be a little more extended, so that I can actually focus on listening to myself breathe for a few breaths. By the time Adriene was talking again I had barely had a chance to do that, and so it felt a little rushed. <br />- Otherwise, I loved it and am really curious and excited to see where this takes me, and us as a community who are all partaking. <br /><br />Thank you Adriene for making this so accessible! You are doing more than your fair share in helping to repair this broken world &lt;3",Bari Morchower Guzikowski,2021-01-07T03:09:23Z,3

"It was a nice, slow and smooth practice focused on bringing attention to the breath, synchronized with movements. Observing that we are breathing because the world&#39;s fast pace may make us forget or we forget to breathe. <br /><br />She mentioned setting intention for the next 30 days and finding my nuance. Also emphasizing that me showing up is the hardest and most important part.<br /><br />I like how my practice might be at the same time with so many many other people!<br /><br />I feel relaxed and ready for the day.

Worship Jesus Christ and you will be saved from burning in Hell!!!!,Dylan Storm,2021-01-05T21:48:43Z,0

"Hi Adriene I have started with your journey but have a small question to ask. There is a fair amount of sitting in the &quot;zen&quot; position in your routine. I (man) am suffering from CPPS which is Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome, and noticed that this position stresses the pelvic muscles and gives me some more pain at the front of the pelvis. Would you recommend to modify the routine or just stick with it? Thanks in advance. I am sure there is more CPPS sufferers out there so your answer would be useful to them as well.",hhh,2021-01-05T12:28:42Z,0

It reminds me that I dont have to lose my inner child or humour to be sincere. 😇 <br />This is not just a Yoga challenge, I love that this has so much breath work.

"Starting this a bit late. My grandma passed away on New Year’s Eve so the start of 2021 has been quite emotionally hard for my family and I. Finally found the time to start this 30 Day journey and realized how much tension I was holding on my upper back for some of these moves and was starting to get frustrated that some moves were quite difficult but I had to be gentle and patient with myself as I am a beginner to the practice (it’s been 2 years since I’ve taken my last yoga class) and that my body is also dealing with the grief of my grandma’s death. So at the end when Adriene said to let go, I found myself releasing some tears as I had been trying to hold it together for my family, especially for my dad who has been heavily affected by the loss of his mother. But I’m so glad I committed through today’s video and it was a great way to bring me back to the present (and realize how out of shape I am lol) so thank you, Adriene if you ever read this. I’m looking forward to this journey.",AZ,2021-01-05T03:10:57Z,1

"Hi Adrienne, my friends and I found you,your channel during the infamous 2020. In the summer,when allowed(in Wales,in the UK)we&#39;d met up on a quiet beach with a portable speaker every Sunday morning and followed your yoga for beginners. We fell in love with yoga,thanks to your unique way of presenting it. Autumn was arriving with dark wet days and more restrictions,so we started using ZOOM and began 30 day yoga from home. It has transformed our lives. We&#39;re hooked.When I saw that you were starting this new Breath 30 day yoga  I knew I had to give it a go daily. Here I am setting my alarm clock an hour earlier to follow your practice before I start working (from home). I am looking forward to joining you tomorrow morning for Day 2. Thank you Adrienne! 🙏❤xx",Martina Meehan,2021-01-05T00:02:14Z,1

"I love these practices and Adriene&#39;s amazingly calm and beautiful approach to Yoga for westerners. She incorperates the breath and mindfulness in a way that those who have not been raised or taught to have a particularly spiritual mindset can wrap their heads around and imerse themselves in, without negating the mindfulness of the practice. Yoga is so much more than streatching and so many western practices chalk it down to a gym class. Adriene has a great balance for us to enjoy &lt;3 x",hannah hollowed,2021-01-04T11:47:12Z,0

"Yogas teaching (at least Kundalini Yoga) is a teaching coming from Babylon (same as hypnosis) to receive demons &quot;To yoke/bond&quot; with something, same as Mantra, Tantra or meditation. Media is Luciferian propaganda (Hellywood/MTV, thats why women also run around half naked on TV/in music clips and people copycat their false idols ! But not going to elaborate further)<br /><br />Thats why in ancient Egypt the pharohs wore a cobra on their forehead for the 3rd eye which is connected to the spirit world, which you want to enlighten through various techniques as mentioned above.",Bible & Conspiracies,2021-01-04T08:30:34Z,0

"Day 1: I haven&#39;t done yoga in a long time (at least 6 months, and not regularly since 2019 probably), so it was understandably tough. I was shocked because even just sitting up straight had my back muscles working overtime. But at the end of it, I felt a lot calmer, and I think for the first time I was able to marry movement to breath (it helped to imagine one of those breathing visualiser thingies for some reason 😂)<br />Last year was the cause of a lot of stress and pain that I will still have to work through, but it feels good to recommit to my practice and spend time on myself. Here&#39;s to 2021!",honey Blue,2021-01-04T02:45:46Z,0
When we realize the root of the self is the movement of thought in time. When thought comes to an end that is a form of death while living. Every human being has identified himself and so conditioned himself.,Mykola Rieland,2021-01-04T02:44:39Z,0

"I started the Home journey with Adriene last year on Jan 1, 2020 and it was a game changer for me. From being someone who used to do yoga on and off before that, I started practicing it daily, and I can say for sure that 2020 was one of my best years mentally and emotionally, which then translated into physical health as well. The changes were small and subtle. I could feel it inside of me. Now, when I look back I can see that I came a long way <br />Thank you Adriene for now giving us Breath in 2021",D V,2021-01-04T02:25:23Z,0

"This brings so much meaning to my life. To start this next journey with all you already brings a great store of transcendence that will carry me through the less than harmonious moments in this journey that I know will come, because everything is a wave. We have highs and we have lows, but lows make us more appreciative of the highs when we choose to tell ourselves this story. We ultimately have the power to decide our fates with everything or nothing we are given. I feel so blessed to have this freely given resource, the opportunity to develop this relationship with myself, our teacher, Adriene, and all of you developing together with me. Whether you practice day by day, a few days late like me, or stumble upon this weeks, months, or years from now, we are all in this together. We are all here, in our moment as we land on the mat, as one. This connection will follow us, moment to moment throughout our lives, often unacknowledged, but powerful and enduring nonetheless. The light in me acknowledges and desires nothing more than for you to find and cultivate the light in you. May 2021 bring meaning above all else. Namaste.",peach fuzz,2021-01-04T00:44:02Z,0
"I&#39;m a day behind, but I got here.  I was amazed at the power of the observational self and the emotion I felt at the end of class.  Thank you.  Part of that was how challenging some of this is - wrists, toes (bunions) don&#39;t want to tuck under -- and a car injury left me with thoracic spine issues which are flaring up so twisting can be difficult.

The past 3 have presented much about which to grieve. My family has lost 7 people (5 to cancer) and 2 others recieved devastating diagnoses. I have been in a constant state of grief, and in that non stop grief I forgot about self care. <br />Day 1 was a perfect reintroduction back on the road to yoga, and a wonderful reminder of how much my mind and body really do love the practice.",BeKind XIII,2021-01-03T23:57:56Z,0

I&#39;m on year five of the 30-day, and even though I&#39;ve grown quite a bit in my practice, I absolutely love returning to this 30-day journey, and knowing that I&#39;m sharing this practice I love so much with people who are meeting it for the first time. If you&#39;re reading this, good for you, you just did yourself such a kindness by joining this practice!

It was kind of cool actually. I have a very hard time clearing my mind and focusing on my breathing alone, but listening too a heartbeat was kind of cool in a way. <br /><br />I do need to work on slowing down and not feel the need to always be moving.

"I have to say when I saw this video I was  hesitant to start. I felt like 48 minutes was a lot of time and that it wouldn&#39;t do much good. During the video, there was many points where I had to pause or go back to a mountain pose or child pose cause my body parts hurt or would be shaking too much. I felt like I couldn&#39;t do it. But something about the instructor kept me going. She is so encouraging and funny at points. Eventually I got to the end of the video and holy moly do I feel good. Although it was a long and hard journey, I pushed through and feel better. It looks like a long road ahead for this 30 day channel but I&#39;m hoping to make it through. I&#39;m so glad I&#39;ve taken this challenge. I can&#39;t wait for future classes",Autumn Brown,2021-01-03T19:21:51Z,1

Is there a beginner&#39;s class?  the combination of painful symptoms and needing to turn my head to see what the instructor is doing is making it too difficult of a practice for me.  Please suggest a link to an easier and shorter practice. Thank you.,Julie Couture,2021-01-03T17:56:26Z,0

This is year 4 of doing the 30 day journey and the first time I start it on the right day! It took me until Easter to finish it last year but then I carried on and did 2 older journeys throughout 2020. I’m sure combined with lockdowns for many of us, I’ll get through it a little earlier this year, but either way I’m so looking forward to the community and togetherness which is so needed right now.

Have practiced yoga for a number of years now...can always &quot;find something new&quot;, indeed :).

Being a writer I need to be around other creatives and live in a place that isn&#39;t suffocating and stress inducing like Vegas was for me.<br /><br />I guess what I wanna know is from a locals perspective, how does Austin rank as a city for an outdoor enthusiast with an artistic side. Is there a thriving writers community? How is the gay community and is Austin welcoming of those in the LBGTQ community?

Hey Adriene! I used to practice yoga daily for almost 2 years but life has taken over during the last 3-4years. I&#39;ve squeezed some yoga here and there but I definitely had no idea HOW stiff my body has become. This felt like coming home to myself. I usually prefer a more dynamic yoga practice but this slow and mindful movement was AMAZING. I feel SO great now. Thank you!,theAiga,2021-01-03T14:46:40Z,0
"This practice reminded me of Is 52:7, &quot;How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who proclaims peace, who brings glad tidings of good things&quot;.  I&#39;m so happy Adriene that you made these videos for us and you invited us to practice in stillness and peace.  Thank you for the &quot;good things&quot; you bring and I can&#39;t wait to continue this journey with you.  Blessings, my friend!",Stephani Jarnigan,2021-01-03T14:46:38Z,0

Okay that was really hard. I have great difficulty bending my wrists so have a tendency to use my fists which is painful after a while. I did love the circular wrist movements though and will continue to try using a flat hand instead of a fist. I had a lot of cramping in my arm as well. I think  that proves that I need this! I am so tight from head to toe! Thank you for this and for the daily email that reminds me to take time for myself,Sheila Robinson,2021-01-03T14:27:21Z,0

"As 2020 ended I was so proud I had completed 6 of adriene&#39;s calendars from 2018 (True -&gt; Catch A Wave) I thought I was so ready to take on and follow through on this 30 day program. Then life happens. I got called into an early shift at work. Then had a minor family emergency arise that rolled right into a previously scheduled zoom mtg. I might be more proud that I still showed up to do this video at 8pm last night when I finally had time, than all of what I accomplished with adriene last year.",Sarah Radley-Lotito,2021-01-03T14:22:17Z,0

Mat and blankie were at the ready on the 1st.  I was having a cuppa and waiting in excited anticipation for your 0 session to load when calamity hit and I found myself dealing with a medical emergency.<br /><br />All&#39;s OK now thankfully but I&#39;m 2 days behind - hey-ho never mind. It&#39;s given me time to take stock and process how very much my family and our love mean to me. <br />Beautiful. Sometimes we take our people for granted don&#39;t we? <br /><br />Well I just did day zero swiftly followed by  Day 1 which was awesome and very much needed and appreciated. Its fab to see you back in the studio with the beautiful view and Benji was so chilled. See you on the mat tomorrow - where time and space do not really matter - it&#39;s all about the energy of being there with you all. Namaste 💞,Free To Be,2021-01-03T12:00:48Z,0

It got busy at work and I stopped which I should never have done as my body is now aching.  Really looking forward to this 30 day journey with all of you and love hearing how you are all doing too.

"Dear Adrienne,<br />Good, slow, grounding,  gentle practice.  I noticed my hands push forward slightly in cat and pull back in cow. Lifting in a lunge takes core engagement.  Holding a pose means breathing into it and the sensations change. Nuances.  I felt definitely more settled.  It is sooo good to slow down for a veteran yoga practioner, me. I love love love movement.  So slow motion does tune into the appreciation of my body&#39;s capacity. 🌹🌺",Caitlin Byrne,2021-01-03T10:44:13Z,0

"Okay let’s be real, when I saw how long the video is I thought I couldn’t do it. Just because my span of focus isn’t long enough, I thought. Also I was really stressed and I thought to myself ,,this is too much for me‘‘. Then I decided I was just gonna start it and if it stresses me I’d stay in child’s pose for the whole video. And what can I say, I followed the whole video, and forgot about the time completely, and when it was over I was relaxed like hardly ever before.

"I never knew how tight my wrists and forearms were! FeelIn the burn there!  In all seriousness, I’m feeling being proud of showing up for myself today. I lost my mom last November and I’ve felt like a shell of a person since. I haven’t taken a really deep breath and I’ve actually felt a lot of pain in my chest when I’d try. It felt like my heart literally broke watching her pass on a phone screen. This feels like a gift to be reborn into the person that I’ve felt has been coming, the one who has been touched by the deepest grief I can imagine for my 27 years. I’m really excited to watch her unfold in me this next month.

"It’s been at least 8 months and weight gain since I’ve been on the mat. Whew...it was hard and I used more prompts then I’ve ever had to use since starting yoga 🧘🏽‍♀️. My body is so tight, I was nearly 35 minutes into it before I even loosened up a bit. This first week and a half is going to be brutal. I pushed through it, day 1 is complete. 💕 I can do this!",Jbutterfly15,2021-01-03T07:40:44Z,0

"This is my first 30 day journey, and only my second Adriene video. I&#39;m overweight by a good margin and couldn&#39;t hold some of those positions for the full length—more because of my wrists than my muscles—but it was such a calming experience. I am trying to be patient with myself these thirty days and not get discouraged by my limitations. I hope everyone else who struggles as I do is doing the same. &lt;3",Bri McB,2021-01-03T07:19:24Z,0

"Adriene, there is so much love for you here. ❤️ It’s on rare occasion that I have to skip my morning yoga practice, but I knew even after feeling unwell upon waking that I would come back to it before the day was over. Seeing 48 minutes was intimidating for how tired my body was, but this is exactly what I needed. It went by so fast when I settled in. I showed up on the mat right before bed, and even at 1 am- I saw that 24,146 people were practicing with me at the same time. That’s incredible. I’ve been following this community for years, but 2021 feels different; Stronger even. I’m so beyond thankful for everyone who decided to show up day or night- for yourselves. A massive hug to all of you. 🤗 This practice brings us together. Adriene, you are a true light worker and Benji is the greatest example of peace there is. I’ll see everybody tomorrow. 🙏",Unearthed&Unleashed,2021-01-03T07:08:00Z,0

I couldn&#39;t hold a plank. Everything just feels tight and weak. It was demoralizing. I feel like I&#39;ve really let things go this year and it doesn&#39;t feel good to come to that realization.

"I started doing yoga with Adriene during the lockdown. I got lost after completing two and a half 30-day journeys cause life got in the way.<br /><br />Last year, I applied for grad schools, took exams and suffered from anxiety. I remember thinking to myself how yoga has helped me with my flexibility and balance, but also my mental stability and health. Now, having my sh*t back on track, I try to find my precious time for yoga each morning.<br /><br />But, even then, I would imagine how it would feel to do yoga with so many people at the same time. Now, my first new year resolution is doing yoga together with the Yoga with Adriene community! Who&#39;s with me for 30 days? 😍 <br /><br /> I will be a proud part of this amazing and supportive community throughout our journey together!

Of course I committed to this because of the compassion fatigue that come from ignoring my own wellness.<br />Very thankful for this time. Thank you Adrienne for inviting me to practice my word for the year, rest, in such a fulfilling way! See you tomorrow.",Oliverway,2021-01-03T05:58:46Z,0

"This practice felt so wonderful. It was hard to clear my mind at first but it was great to practice bringing the focus back to the breath. I did today&#39;s practice before bed and it made me feel so tired and ready to sleep. I also want to say that as a long time follower and lover of the 30 days of yoga, this channel and this team has come so far. It is so wonderful to see the positive changes and enhancements in production, and the personal and professional growth in leading and teaching. I feel so honored to witness this and be a part of the community.",Chloe M,2021-01-03T05:54:54Z,0

"Day One, done! <br /><br />Something that I really thought about during this practice was patience. It has been really hard trying to be patient this past year. I want life to go back to normal so badly, but it is just out of my control. I&#39;ve learned that there is no shame in waiting and being patient with myself this year, and I&#39;m looking forward to applying that same idea during the next 30 days through yoga. <br /><br />Congrats to everyone practicing!

How do you get a nice flat back when doing poses like downward dog and half fold? Mine always bends upward. Is that just a difference in body shape? Will it come with time and work? Am I just doing the pose wrong?,Sarah Elizabeth,2021-01-03T05:39:59Z,0

"Day one complete!!! Turns out, my cat missed yoga as much as I have. I had about 10 minutes left when she came in my room and started walking around me, laying underneath my cat-cow, and then when we were on our backs I had my knees in the diamond shape and she curled up between my thighs lol. I couldn&#39;t sit up at the end, I just stayed on the ground and did prayer pose from there. Afterwards, I turned on some music and just laid quietly with my cat sleeping between my legs as I stretched. It was incredibly cozy and relaxing. Feeling good about Breath.

"Balance - make sure you&#39;re using your core, that you&#39;re engaging your legs, and keep your eyes fixed on something. It helps so much with balance. Hold it until you tire and then go to a resting pose like child&#39;s pose. You will get stronger and stronger over time :) Everyone starts out wobbly but with regular practice you will improve so much",Prosateuse,2021-01-03T06:16:16Z,1

"Thank you so much, Adriene, for the gift you give us all for free and with so much love and warmth. I usually show up wanting results haha, to do the asanas &quot;right&quot; and work up a sweat or have an epiphany or whatever, so today&#39;s practice was perfect for me. An invitation to pay attention in the in-between moments and be present with my breath when my mind and body are restless. I accept the invitation &lt;3",Caroline Weeks,2021-01-03T04:33:07Z,0
Wow!  That was tougher than I thought it would be.  I think that means I really needed it.  Proud of myself for doing this for 48 (!) minutes.  So inspiring to see people from all over the world breathing with me.  I am excited for tomorrow.,Jonathan Bodow,2021-01-03T04:32:39Z,1

"My family just talked about euthanizing our 15 year old pup for the first time today. Our dog has been my Benji throughout more YWA classes than I can count, always snoring, laying in the middle of my mat, or licking my face in savasana. This class was everything I needed today, it was the return to wholeness that yoga so graciously invites. Tonight, it spun grief into gratitude for me and my mom (who has also done more YWA videos with me than I can count). Even our old boy slept peacefully by us the entire practice, getting a brief reprise from the anxiousness and confusion he’s been living with lately. To Adriene, Benji, and the whole YWA community - thank you.",Summer Doss,2021-01-03T04:32:03Z,1

Worked in the ER last night. So busy. I was on my feet the entire night. What got me through was knowing I would come home to your new video.

9 months of little to no movement.(ive been laid off due to the pandemic)I almost didnt finish these 48 minutes.  I wanted to quit so bad. I cant believe how hard it was for me to hold a downward facing dog. Sigh. But i have been waiting for these 30 days since march. A promise i made to myself. So i kept going. Ive made it through the hardest 9 months of my life. I can handle 48 minutes. So much gratitude ❤,Jennifer Stillions,2021-01-03T04:31:03Z,28

"My breath and heart melted as it synchronized with the rhythm of, what I assume is, your heart.

"Like many people, I started a daily practice with adriene during spring, to find some way to deal with covid-related stress while trapped inside.  My daily practice has made such a difference- reducing my back pain, strengthening my core, and giving me a little time to myself.<br /><br />One thing I have learned is not to force anything.  I remember this summer, I got frustrated that I was not getting flexible fast enough.  I decided I wasn&#39;t try hard enough and pressed forward as hard as I could, until it was painful.  Then I heard a pop and my back was sore for two weeks, lol.  Today, when Adriene said to twist my wrist around I started doing it, only made it halfway and my wrists told me this was a no go.  So I listened, and I happily did what I could.  And I&#39;m proud of myself, even if I&#39;ll never be the most flexible person.",princesskatie331,2021-01-03T03:06:20Z,0

"Thank you for bringing attention to the hands and the wrists, Adriene! I’ve gone all in on my yoga practice and mindfulness journey over the past six months, and this sudden flurry of yoga left my wrists feeling absolutely strained. After a two week break from weight-bearing in the hands, I’m back and working to listen to the nuances in my joints. I love how YWA videos encourage me to create a practice that’s sustainable every day and in the long term. And I’m beginning these 30 days fully committed to my practice and the way it helps me to find ease in my body, to soothe my mind and to nourish my spirit.

"A👏🏻dri👏🏻ene Mi👏🏻shler!!!! This practice reminded me so much of why I first fell in love with doing yoga with you some 4 or 5 years ago. I felt a really deep connection to this practice and I can really feel the love and energy you put into it - palpably. My mom passed a few days ago and the funeral was today - feeling completely numb and drained I just wanted to lay in bed but got my butt to the mat and pushed play. I’m so glad I did. I cried the whole first half of the practice but continued to listen to your cues and notice everything you suggested to notice. As the practice picked up I was able to get out of my head and really be present in the flow and surrender - truly a miracle after the week I’ve been having and this fresh grief. I’m left with peace and deep gratitude for all the free practices and programs you and your team have shared with the world. Truly, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. Namaste. ✨",Valerie Maynard,2021-01-03T02:15:41Z,0

While in the practice, finally unmuting myself, my body told me how neglected it feels and how long I stopped listening to it. These 30 days, and hopefully longer, I promise to listen. To remain plugged in and to take each day as it comes, putting aside long term plans and wishes.

I just watched the intro and the two things I noticed were; Adriene&#39;s new place, and how much slower and calmer she was speaking in the intro. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because of the theme of today&#39;s practice or if that&#39;s her new style (like her place)",Rachlo24,2021-01-03T01:53:08Z,0

Happy to have started today with everyone. I have pain in my hip from a past car accident that has been acting up and when we went into crescent pose I cried. Not from pain but from relief. (It still hurt but that good hurt of healing) this is my second time doing the New Years program as it comes out and I’m very excited to be taking some time for myself. ❤️,angela bleibtrey,2021-01-03T01:33:16Z,0

I am very excited about it and i want to manage stick to it but i have to extract my wisdom teeth on Monday and i remember that hard exercising is not allowed. So, is yoga considered as hard exercising? Should i start again from day 1 when i will be better or pause it on Monday and continue it after?

I hope you can see how excited I was to be part of this. Adriene promised everyone who can breathe, can do this but I couldn&#39;t. I was hoping there&#39;d be variations for beginners or people who find a pose too difficult. I&#39;ll continue to show up on the mat although at this minute the challenge seems bigger than me.",Nasim Akhbarifar,2021-01-03T00:43:52Z,1
"@Sam Crocker Thank you so much Sam for your support. I believe there&#39;s nothing more healing and heart warming than the feeling of connection, the oneness, when we share and care for eachother. I appreciate your kind words so much and hope never to forget the power of a RAK 🤗",Nasim Akhbarifar,2021-02-04T06:15:45Z,1
"I think you need to give it time, this is my 4th year of doing the journey, the first year I started because I had a broken collar bone from being hit by a car. I decided to look for a yoga class I could do at home as I was not able to do all the moves and didn’t want the embarrassment of people in a class staring (not that they actually do). I had a frozen shoulder and elbow but slowly the yoga helps. I will never get complete movement back in my shoulder but I’m nearly there.<br />So be patient and be willing. You will see a difference but it will in my experience take time 😌",Sam Crocker,2021-01-03T16:45:47Z,1

But I&#39;m so glad I sat and meditated with you because eventually with out me noticing till the end, my focus was in the moment and what I was doing rather than focusing on somewhere else I had to be.

"hello! i have a question for anyone who may be able to share an insight 🤍 for a long time now, i’ve noticed that when i practice yoga, random memories resurface. they’re not always memories with significant emotions attached to them, they can be as simple as doing my weekly food shop at uni, going for dinner one time and what the table looked like, my 9th birthday (that one surfaces a lot actually). they briefly visit, and intensely as i can remember them all so well, and then leave as a new memory surfaces. they all seem ‘random’ to me, but i’m also a believer that very little really is ‘random’. so i’m wondering if this happens to anybody else, and whether these memories could mean anything at all please? thank you in advance x",Chanel MacColl,2021-01-03T00:14:38Z,0

At one point I got a bit upset and cried a little, but Adrienne said something along the lines of &quot;It&#39;s ok if this feels difficult&quot; (I do not remember exactly what she said). It&#39;s ok that my body hurts a little or shakes or I feel uncomfortable. I was upset because i felt like I couldn&#39;t relax during some of it due to something feeling weird or my body shaking.

"At a time of uncertainty here in the UK and a fear of the unknown future, yoga is something that grounds me and I know it will always be there to make me feel in tune to my body so I can be the best functioning person I can be. This practice made me feel tranquil, at peace, connected, loved, spiritual, meditated, breathy, soothed, challenged and, as a superfluous bonus, my Fitbit says I burnt 100 calories too. This is just exactly what everybody needs right now. Good luck in day 2 everybody! :) x",Wonder Woman,2021-01-03T00:06:53Z,3

"Day one was so wonderful for me! It took me a few tries to get settled and stick to the video, but this was such a lovely transition into 30 days of yoga. I usually feel intimidated by videos longer than 20 minutes, but this was so soft and sweet that I hardly noticed how long it was. It feels wonderful to have done a full practice again.

I didn&#39;t even realize this was a longer practice until I came out of my sacred space and my partner asked &quot;where have you been?&quot; <br /><br />Super excited to finally be able to participate in a live 30 day challenge with Adriene! She has really helped me to change the way I treat my body and even the smallest of movements I take each day.,Brittney Raley,2021-01-02T23:59:13Z,0
"oh man I hope Adriene can forgive me but I changed the playback speed to 1.25 😂 I know slowing things down is really important sometimes so I feel kinda bad now, but she was talking soooo slowly in the beginning and I could feel myself losing focus. I&#39;ve been doing all of the 30 day series back to back, so I&#39;m not exactly a beginner anymore and it was just the right pace for me slightly sped up. But I probably didn&#39;t hold some postures as long because of that, so I might redo this practice again at some point. I still enjoyed it though and can&#39;t wait for the next videos to come out!!",Vesta's Flame,2021-01-02T23:59:05Z,1

"I looked at the length of this video and thought I couldn&#39;t possibly last the 48 minutes especially with anxiety about the time ticking the day away. However, I laid down my mat, hit play on the video, and just fully let go to the sound of adriene&#39;s voice and embraced every word, breath, and movement. I am thankful these yoga sequences are somehow so perfectly designed to nourish if we keep ourselves open to it because the time was able to fly by with happiness and peace rather than anxiety. This is both my thanks and a reminder to myself or anyone else to invite ease and openness to each yoga session or video because the journey is wonderful and personal and you are capable of each step, no matter how far you&#39;ve stepped away.",Joyce Zhan,2021-01-02T23:15:40Z,1

"Honestly when I got the calendar and saw the length of this practice I was intimidated, I usually stick to practices around or under twenty-five to thirty minutes, but I committed to showing up for BREATH everyday before it even started and honestly this practice completely changed my perception of long practices. I feel so good and so accomplished sticking with it until the end and it felt like the perfect little opening to this month and this year.<br /> I&#39;m so glad I took the time for myself and stuck with it, I feel like promises you make to yourself are the hardest to keep, but I promised myself I&#39;m going to show up on the mat every day this month, and I hope everyone around the world will join in and we&#39;ll all take this journey together! I don&#39;t know about everyone else, but I can&#39;t wait to see where I am at the end of the month compared to now! Good luck everyone! Sending love~",Aventa Tumal,2021-01-02T23:09:06Z,0

"Hello. In the past I have considered myself more an avid trail runner and Qigong practitioner, having tried yoga only a few times in a gym. They have a yoga teacher at my alternative public high school where I provide Special Education. I often sit on a yoga ball in class as do many of my students because it is so good for your core in comparison to being at a traditional desk all day. However, since the pandemic began enjoying the outdoors for me has sometimes been a bit more challenging. I have tried various 30 day yoga challenges via Amazon since March 13, 2020 to keep me healthy both in mind and body. Some I completed in 30 days, others I did not. It was not until late August 2020 that I discovered Yoga with Adriene. At first her practice seemed too easy in comparison to the other challenges I had completed. I had read comments from other practitioners mentioning that they use Yoga with Adriene as a supplement and often add something else. However, every time I completed a different 30 day Yoga with Adriene, at the conclusion I have felt just right. For me not only has it ignited a passion for yoga, but it has brought something for me to share with others during these very uncertain and stressful times. Thank you Adriene and Benji, you have both converted me. I now also consider myself a daily yoga practitioner! I am sincerely looking forward to this journey every day in 2021. Namaste, Edward<br />“Sometimes, carrying on, just carrying on, is the superhuman achievement.” - Albert Camus, writer, philosopher",Edward Teacher,2021-01-02T22:39:04Z,1

"This is my third year of this, and I knew that this was going to be the hardest yoga journey because I basically spent all of 2020 on my butt. And yikes, I felt it in places I didn&#39;t know I could feel it. Even my downward dog and forward folds felt stiff. But it felt so good to move for the first time in almost a year, and I am so happy to be on this journey with all of you for another year.",Anna Kivi,2021-01-02T22:38:16Z,0

"I have been practising with Adriene for around 5 years and I found this one of the hardest sessions. I was fidgety and struggling to sit. It felt hard to be slow for this length of time (at the beginning), just breathing. But I persevered, setting my intention to listen. Listen to my wonderful teacher, myself and the environment around me. Respecting myself for showing up. I am so grateful for YWA and the community, with all the challenges around at the moment, it is easy to distract myself and in turn forget to listen to my intuition. So I am looking forward to taking the time over the next 30 days for BREATH; to guide me and keep me grounded. Namaste &lt;3",Elle Stocks,2021-01-02T22:34:43Z,0

"@KILLJOYS, MAKE SOME NOISE!! My comment wash a bit harsh. And you did not offend me, but I was triggered because in your comment you showed a lack of discernment for a Christian. But knowing your age, and the fact so many Christians follow the blind leading the blind I can not blame you. I only hope you will guard your soul and research the origin of yoga before becoming addicted to it.<br />&quot;Find what feels good - yoga with Adriene&quot; <br /><br /> &quot;Just because it feels good, doesn&#39; t make it right&quot; Hedonism - Skunk Anansie.<br /><br />The other part of what triggered my urge to warn you, or wake you up was you writing &#39;for people who are lost&#39;. If you are lost I believe and am convinced you should not yoke yourself with yoga! But ask and search our savior and honor your parents. <br /><br />God, the one and only living creator of heaven and earth will guide you if you honor your parents, and accept the love for truth.

The interesting thing is that youtube followers are also harmful for the yt idols, in the sense that the adoration conjures up and feeds demons in the channel owner. It&#39;s a channeling of power of which you do not want to be a part because it&#39;s a loose loose situation for all involved. I hope you now understand why I had to warn you.

Maybe it&#39;s time to get away from the notion of harder, faster, stronger, is better. This short flow left had me struggling more than a HITT work out. I love yoga for that reason.

"Adriene reminded us that showing up to the mat would be one of the toughest parts - and she wasn’t wrong! We were short staffed at the hospital last night, so I agreed to stay over into the night shift for four hours knowing I had to be back at work the next day. I’d gone home on my dinner break and prepared a breakfast I could take with me on the road the next day after this first video, set my alarms so I would wake up early enough to do this - I’d committed to give myself this gift. Then four am hit and my replacement still wasn’t there after an hour and they were scrambling to find somebody to match me. I made it home, caught a few hours of sleep, and woke up just early enough to do this first video. All that to say, I am SO grateful I did. Groggy-eyed on the mat (which was just a blanket on my floor), this was the perfect pace I needed today. My soul feels refreshed and my body awake. I am calm and ready to begin another day!

"Thanks Adrienne, you have no idea how much this means to me, how much I anticipate this every year and how grateful I am for this platform. Just two words.... THANK YOU ❤️<br />So DAY1: It was awesome, I was so energetic and excited to get on my mat, and when we fully started at about 6minutes, I was even more pumped. Lol. Today was very amazing cause I&#39;ve really missed yoga a lot, it&#39;s quite easier for me to follow a schedule. Then again, I started getting weak, more like shaky during the plank, lower lunge and down ward facing dog poses because of my weak left arm, the elbow is bent and also completing some of Adrienne sentences or guessing what pose comes next because of how integral this has become to me, it&#39;s my 4th year and I&#39;m glad to be here...but I remember vividly at the ending Adrienne said something &#39;embarking on this journey for YOURSELF&#39; and I hold that as a mantra through this year&#39;s journey because I can only be better for me, to be better for others, which is one of my resolutions for the new year. So all in all I&#39;m so glad and honoured to be doing this with over millions of people world-wide. With hands clasped together I say a Happy New Year to everyone and Namaste.🙏🏼❤️",Ashley,2021-01-02T22:14:17Z,2
"I have been wanting to get in touch with the movement of my body since gaining a little bit of weight, I want to embrace how my body is RIGHT NOW without feeling like I need to change. It felt so good to do that today. The two main things I need to work on are my breath and stability but I know that will come with time. Really excited for 30 days of learning about my physical self.",Julia Rachel,2021-01-02T22:14:16Z,0

"I invited my mom to today&#39;s practice and she joined me. We had an interruption after the first yoga lunge, and she said I could go ahead and finish on my own. Having done the 30 days of yoga last year, I had an inkling the hardest part was nearly over, and invited her to finish with me. <br />She did and she said she had fun, and she was glad she did it with me. ^_^<br />I love all the direction and guidance you give; it gives me confidence I can invite yoga newbies to join me and they won&#39;t over extend or hurt themselves, and I also always am able to go deeper by following it! I&#39;m so happy to be getting back into yoga now that allergy season is past, which put a temporary pause on it last year. xD (I kept trying, but just &quot;drowned&quot; every time I did a forward fold.) <br />Also, during the final &quot;corpse pose&quot; silent moment, my dog was making slumbering noises. &lt;3",Giggles' Vids,2021-01-02T22:07:27Z,0

"Honestly, staying focused was the easy part and what I was excited about, but I am so out of shape... <br />And the small internal movements to adjust the feet, hands, shoulders made it all so much more meaningful. I feel more relaxed.  <br /><br />My biggest problem is so silly: I sweat on my palms and slip off the downward facing dog every time we have to hold more than  2 breathes, I even tried gloves with those gripping thingies, it does not help. :(",Sabrina Araújo Vieira,2021-01-02T21:49:27Z,0

"Now is the time to get in the ark of safety which is Jesus Christ! The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus. Cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded, lament and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy into gloom. Humble yourselves in the sight of God and he shall lift you up. <br /><br />The apostles of Jesus Christ preached the way of salvation the day the New Testament began saying “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. This promise is to you and to your children and as many as the Lord my God shall call. No man cometh unto the Father but by Jesus Christ and as many as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ and those that are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God. Receive the promise of eternal life promised by the Father unto man by his Son, Jesus. Obey the gospel!",The Light Of Life,2021-01-02T21:39:32Z,0

"i am one of the few people i know who still makes new years resolutions - and the past few years i had decided to take a more realistic approach, and invite the help of the universe to guide me toward what it knew i needed most in the coming year. this year, i decided that i need to give myself more love, and the space in my life to do things that bring me joy. this morning, I woke up and i couldn&#39;t get yoga out of my head. finally, after hours of doing chores and checking things off of a to-do list, i have found my breath. i had no idea this challenge would be taking place, but i am very excited and grateful to have found it this gloomy  Indiana afternoon. i look forward to connecting with you all again tomorrow.",ellie mae,2021-01-02T20:56:12Z,0

Thank you Adriene for sharing this journey with all of us. First day was good though my laptop gets in the way of focussing on breathing as it&#39;s the LOUDEST laptop anyone&#39;s ever heard. I wish I had money for a new one but that&#39;s not happening any time soon! I also want to follow instructions but feel like I have to watch you as well as listen and that takes away my focus.

"From February to August last year I did yoga with Adriene every day, then when I went back to work in August  I very quickly stopped my daily practice. I only did yoga maybe a few times between then and now, but I knew I wanted to do the 30 day challenge. I have to say, it was definitely hard to show up today. I found myself thinking, maybe I&#39;ll do it in an hour, and I had to tell myself that if I didn&#39;t get on the mat right then it would never get done because one hour would turn into two, then I would be getting ready for bed and realize I never rolled out my mat at all. Showing up really is the hardest part. Once I heard Adriene&#39;s voice I was hooked in. It was lovely to hear her usual phrases and sayings (hey-oh!) and to feel my body naturally fall back into poses and rhythms it had learned for months previously. Although it&#39;s definitely harder to hold the poses for me now, and I found my body getting tired more quickly than it used to, I really enjoyed doing this practice. It&#39;s like hanging out with an old friend after months apart. While it was hard to initially show up, I&#39;m definitely glad that I did, and look forward to showing up the rest of the month as well! Definitely dreading day 6 a bit though, haha!",elladee,2021-01-02T20:44:29Z,0

For that reason you&#39;ve been my favorite since first discovering your videos here on youtube. As they fit with my introduction to yoga many, many years ago as a therapeutic practice for my body and a chance to focus and calm my mind. I didn&#39;t do nearly as much yoga this last year as my body and mind might have liked and there is an awful lot of tension I look forward to easing over the next 29 days.

"It’s been a while since I’ve started doing yoga with Adrienne. I always pick the smallest practices, because I say to myself “you don’t have enough time or focus for a 50 min practice”. But here I am, smiling after this 50 minutes video (which I was able to finish with enough time and focus). I know this series is called “breath”, but for me is also a new beginning after such a hard year.

Now I&#39;ve completed the first day, I feel so grounded and hopeful for the rest of this month. Thank you Adriene.",lynchetta,2021-01-02T20:06:50Z,0

"Will you or somebody help me please? Every time I do low lunges, on a knee or lifted, like in this video, the front leg starts to feel numb in my hip area. What’s constricting and how do I adjust myself? I try lifting up from my core more and hold that scissoring effect with the two legs but I tend to feel the numbness still at the hip creases. Please help. Thank you! Love you Adriene! This video was very relaxing and slow and beginner-friendly. A bit too slow for my advanced beginner self but I appreciated the time to pay attention and readjust my poses. Always learning 🙏🏻",millennium,2021-01-02T19:56:44Z,0

Great to be back to yoga! Thanks Adriene! I could use some tips on the lunge. I have trouble getting into that position. My body wants to put my leg outside of both my arms instead of in between.

"Invite yourself to let go...I felt myself feeling frustrated. Adriene said to notice any clenching and I noticed it and thought, &quot;Hellooooo, I am saying let gooooo&quot; and it would not release. And then I found another way to let go...I let go of FORCING the clenching to released, of making that a RULE in order to &quot;perfectly let go&quot;. I smiled and let myself be. Felt the clenching, felt the itch on my forehead, and continued to breathe. I let go in my own way.",Kelsey W,2021-01-02T19:42:02Z,0

"Last year I didn&#39;t really take care of myself and I felt like crap most of the time. As 2021 rolled in,  I decided that I would treat my body with the love and respect it deserves. So, here I am. It was a really hard practice for me. I hadn&#39;t set foot on my mat for the longest time and I was stiff. Every pose,  even the ones that had been &quot;easy&quot; once upon a time, were really hard today. But I made it and I&#39;m proud of it. Thank you for this opportunity, Adriene. It&#39;s going to be a great way to start a year of self-care and discovery.

"Happy fDay 1 everybody :). Thank you so much Adriene, I am filed with relaxed excitement. Sometimes I find it a bit hard to follow the faster flows, as my breath is not fast enough but I just take my own pace. In that warrior like pose it really helped me that you explained engaging the inner thigs is like pulling the one foot and the knee together. <br />Thank you so much!

"I&#39;m dropping a comment here for anyone who tried this video and failed to let you know you aren&#39;t alone. I scrolled comments for a while trying to find commiseration and didn&#39;t see anyone else who was frustrated. My back locked up around minute 23, and I had to pause the video and figure out how to stretch myself so I could move again. I had a good cry and started again. But within minutes it was moving too quickly for me to follow and to understand what I was supposed to be doing. I never could figure out if my body was doing the right things. I&#39;m a beginner, and I thought this would be good for beginners, but that was a mistake. So just - if this wasn&#39;t a great experience for you - if you struggled or failed or cried or gave up - you aren&#39;t the only one. Hugs to you. I feel sad and stupid, even though rationally I know I tried my best. xo",Brook,2021-01-02T19:15:39Z,0

I can say I&#39;m proud of myself to make it to the mat today.  I feel areas of my body hurt and I have to break the pose and shake it out before I try and go into the position again.  Even when I cross my legs and sitting on the blanket.  My ankle bones hurt staying in the sitting position for a while.  My posture is not the best but I will do this and continue to keeping up with this Breathe and Yoga with yourself.  It should become easier the more I do it.  I do feel twisted for sure.  I am also a beginner.  :),Wendy Broadhurst,2021-01-02T18:52:00Z,0

"yum!<br />I started a new job 5 months ago and started a meditation practice around the same time, and have really neglected yoga in the meantime. It was interesting to see how different it is for me with my body now having aches and pains from work, and with a better relationship to my breath. I was very intimidated by the length of today&#39;s session - I often start to feel disconnected during longer sessions and feel very antsy. Not so today! We&#39;ll see how the next few weeks go - I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be easy practicing consistently while working a tiring job as well. But I do hope I keep up with it, in my own time at least. I&#39;m looking forward to this year&#39;s theme! I&#39;ve been enjoying ywa videos for six years, and I&#39;m so happy to see the ever growing community and enthusiasm.

"My husband, ten year old son, and I did day O and day 1 this morning. We had just finished round 2 of your 30 day yoga “home”. I’m a big fan. Thank you for your teachings. The yoga, your words, and your loving relationship with your dog. We wondered where you were? We are used to doing videos with you when you are in a house. This seemed different. Thank you for the slow work. I needed the breath and the detail. I still feel awkward with my relationship to downward dog. Especially when we come up from a plank. I also wonder what my neck should be doing in downward dog.",Loretta Foster,2021-01-02T18:50:22Z,0

Then my life turned upside down, I got multiple challenges confronting me and I stopped, I stopped yoga, I stopped smiling, I stopped feeling good... It was all so stressful.

"This was so hard, and I&#39;m so glad and proud and refreshed from making it through.  Last year, finding &#39;Home&#39; got me through the worst parts of spring, but I fell out of yoga in sadness and apathy and frustration some time in the middle of summer.  I think (I hope) (I INTEND) to make it through Breath this year, and to keep going afterwards, because it&#39;s 2021 and a fresh start and this year, we make our own joy.  I KNOW that no matter how hard it is or how much I struggle or even if there are days I don&#39;t make it to the mat at all, every day I get here and work through will be a blessing.  Thanks, Adriene.<br />(And thanks, more-than-thirty-thousand-people who went through this workout with me today.)",Clarity C,2021-01-02T18:49:10Z,1

"Perfect, I  mean PERFECT.  I had been doing Zoom yoga daily in 2020 up until about May, when the tedium (and covid weariness)  overcame me.  I quit cold turkey.  Nothing could get me back to the mat. A mentor and friend suggested I join her in is this journey. The gentle and mindful start was exactly right for an experienced but very stiff and weak 77 year old body. I believe I&#39;m committed for 30 days - maybe 300!",Carlita Rios,2021-01-02T18:48:54Z,5

"I really struggled during this. I felt so much resistance from within, somehow I really could not stay focused and go inward. However, I made a promise to myself and I really want to keep that so I kept going. About halfway through I broke down and started crying, I realized I&#39;m scared I will break the promise to myself (as I have so many times before) and not finish these 30 days. I felt so much better after I cried and I fully engaged in the second half, I completely forgot the time and was only focusing on my breathing.

"Why did I cry a little at the end of this practice lol. One massive way that I can see practising along with a monthly program will really benefit me, is letting go of planning exact times and my need to fit in this and that, but instead, making time for however long each practice will be daily, and I cant PLAN for that as each day will be different. I do yoga with you everyday anyway, TWICE, but I always pick the exact same time-ish slots to &#39;fit in&#39; with a fixed schedule. Now I will be working with whatever times are thrown at me each day, and I NEED that, as this will so help me let to let go and go with the flow. Seeing where the journey will take me, instead of always trying to control the journey. Wow. Thank you, Adriene. xxx",Leigh Taylor,2021-01-02T18:45:17Z,0

Thank you so much for creating such a beautiful platform on Youtube; I have been following you for over 2 years now, trying to do your 30 day monthly challenges--and especially during lockdown it helped me destress so much.

I somewhere read &quot;Keep on taking time for yourself until you are you again&quot; and that has been my motivation.<br />Good luck and stay strong! Namaste!",Laura Gonzalez,2021-01-02T20:27:16Z,2

This is such a great way to kick off 2021! I&#39;m so excited to be on this journey with everyone. This is my first time doing a YWA challenge and I&#39;m so glad. I decided to join.

I needed that today.<br>Anyone else find they were intuitively going to places that Adriene then said 10 seconds or so later? It kept happening in the movement, and then at the end I was thinking let it all go, right before Adriene said it!

Beautiful practice!  Two unique things I hadn&#39;t done yet - twisting the wrists back and then rotating gently and massaging the wrists - very helpful for my fussy wrists.  What I observed and truly &quot;understood&quot; that i hadn&#39;t up to this point  - what &quot;taking the pressure&quot; off my hands/wrists by using the legs feels like (strong!) and how rotating my shoulders out opens my chest and protects my fussy right shoulder.  I cried just hearing the music start and again when we finished.  So grateful for Adriene and for all of you!  Day one INvite in the books!,Ana Analisa,2021-01-02T18:31:58Z,1

"This was such an amazing way to start the day!! I am a student and finished my last exam on December 18. Between Online school and covid, I was more burnt out than I have ever been and have been dreading the next semester and worrying that I won&#39;t be ready to go back. This journey gives me hope in finding and carrying on the rest that I will need to start each day as I integrate myself back into online school. Thank you, Adrienne. You are so appreciated &lt;3 (p.s. the heyo made me laugh out loud;) )",Cassie Peake,2021-01-02T18:13:32Z,0

I found some of the positions while lunging to be quite difficult, I either have to have my arm in the inside of my knee, or be bent way too deep to make it an effective stretch... does anyone have any tips or tricks...<br />I finished the video, but feeling a little discouraged right now",Stacy M,2021-01-02T18:10:31Z,0

"This was def. another challenging one. I wonder how I&#39;m going to get through the next 29 days if they&#39;re all this slow (although I&#39;m sure they won&#39;t be). I find the more slower practices where you move slower, breathe deeper and focus more to be the most challenging (but are DEFINITELY probably) the most beneficial for me.<br /><br />I already can tell this will be challenging but I know it is going to help me grow as a little yogi (I decided GROWTH is my intention) and will change me for the better.<br /><br />Let me know if anyone else felt this is a bit challenging too.

"As I recover from long covid, moving slowly, with intention, was just my speed. I’ve been doing deep breathing and meditation to help me heal for the past 9 months. Your 30 day journey was my invitation to BREATH, but also to try and regain the “old me”.

"Getting back into YogaWithAdriene after a hiatus for many (many) months and I realize now how much my physical body NEEDS this practice. I&#39;ve lost a fair bit of strength and flexibility this year simply by NOT coming to my mat and today was a good reminder that I need to prioritize consistency. Use it or lose it. My wrists definitely need some TLC (that flat-palm turn-around stretch was killer - I could barely do it, so I have my work cut out for me!)

"&quot;Turn your right wrist clockwise toward your right knee&quot; it&#39;s like she knew my wrists needed some love.

"Wow! 34,472 of my closest friends just did the practice with me. So cool! To Adriene: I can&#39;t believe it took 39 minutes to get to our first &quot;Heyo&quot; of this journey. I could see you resisting it! Also, something looks just a little bit different this practice - will you have some special news to tell us at the end of the 30 days? :-D Finally, your new space looks incredible! It was so lovely to see the gorgeous Texas flora outside the beautiful doors and windows as we moved through this practice - it makes me homesick for Austin. Thank you so much for putting together another 30-day journey for us - I can&#39;t wait to see what the next month has in store! &lt;3",Agoraphobication,2021-01-02T17:23:10Z,1

But I also thought about all the things that used to be hard or uncomfortable that I can now do with ease, because for some reason I &#39;kept with&#39; those things.

"I&#39;ve restarted the previous 30 day journey 5 times and never made it past day 11. i had a sports injury 8 years ago and the chronic pain that I&#39;ve had from it has affected every single day since then. my physiotherapist is adamant that the core problem lies in my lungs and the way I breathe, so when I saw the theme of this year&#39;s journey I knew that I  had to try again and I&#39;m really excited to see how it&#39;s going to impact my health :) I&#39;m so ready to change how I feel in my body and for everyone that&#39;s struggling out there we&#39;ll make it through together &lt;3",MeltedGlacier,2021-01-02T17:05:08Z,0

"Wow. My one and only resolution for this year was to SLOW DOWN and BREATHE better. I&#39;m an instructor myself but have been completely disconnected from yoga since the pandemic started and was craving a guided slower practice to get back into the groove of things. Get back in touch with myself and listen to my body. And then Adriene comes up with this. Just perfect. EXACTLY what I needed, when I needed it.

"Wow! Thank you! This is speaking to me in so many ways...Physically it is encouraging me to care for my body; celebrate what I can do and encourage myself to slow down and take it easy when I need to. It also gives me a little push to try something new ;) Mentally it is giving me a place to rest and practice focusing which has become difficult. Emotionally it is giving me a peace and a calm that I have been missing. Spiritually it is tapping into the message that has been echoing for a long time: slow down, breathe, listen. ~ Namaste",Debra Schooley,2021-01-02T17:00:31Z,0

"Thank you Adriene.  Until March of 2020 I had a very active yoga practice and rigorous daily workouts to the point that my body decided it was time to take a long break to recover.  My ROM in my joints had decreased significantly due to bouts of inflammation.  I found myself feeling frustrated and trying to push myself back into some sort of practice/workout.  Finally, I surrendered and have been slowly rebuilding and coming to terms that it is OK to slow down and start over.  I decided to take on this 30 day Yoga Journey - BREATH to ease myself back into a consistent practice with calmer approach.  Thank you for this offering.",Carol Rubino,2021-01-02T16:56:40Z,0

"There were two lovely moments—in the beginning sit and the final rest—where I was having a hard time quieting my own mind, mainly due to internal thoughts and distraction; thanks to some decent speakers and the desire to really try to quiet my busy brain, I simply tried very active listening....and I could hear Adriene’s heartbeat. She has a pretty powerful mic—and the space is quiet—but it was a simple sound that guided me back to my own heartbeat and breath. Not sure if the hot mic was intended for this, but it added a bit of centering when my brain was struggling to quiet. Cheers for sharing your time and heart, Adriene.",Deborah N,2021-01-02T16:56:09Z,0

Wow! I made it through Day 1! doing a full yoga session is a first for me. Really helpful to listen to oneself and our breathing. I felt weak at certain points since I don&#39;t exercise but i kept going slowly with breathing to be able to continue. Just one question: I have cyst in my left wrist which makes it weak and can&#39;t hold onto it for a very hard time - do you reccomend I put a block under my wrists for supports? however the self palm massage helped the tension.

"Forward fold is my villain origin story, no matter how curious and gentle I try to be with myself, it never feels good. I can’t straighten my legs but don’t have the thigh strength to stay with my knees bent for long and somehow my belly and hips are also at war with each other. Do I just have to endure the discomfort and hope that it gets better or am I doing something wrong? <br>Regardless, I’m very proud that I showed up for myself and finished the practice...even if it meant crying in corpse pose because I’m frustrated with myself🙈",bedroomsoliloquies,2021-01-02T16:49:28Z,0

"I found the ywa channel during our first lockdown in the spring. I did the Home 30 day challenge and it still brings me to tears thinking about that experience.

"Thank you for creating another great series. I have done all of your 30 day yoga challenges and am looking forward to this one! Would you consider embedding the videos on your website instead of linking to the youtube page? Reason being, as you may be aware, when viewing the videos on youtube, it automatically advances to the next video or some gnarly advertisement, which is a harsh re-entry to reality from the wonderful places you guide us on our journeys together.

By the end of the video, I felt a sense of peace with myself and my body.

I did all the other 30 Days since the beginning of quarantine and followed them by your monthly calendars. This pretty much gives a clear idea of how much I grew to love yoga haha. My friends also agreed to hop in this month and I couldn&#39;t be happier. The very thought that I could be sharing these lovely moments with my friends and this gorgeous community warms my heart. Yoga has aided me physically and mentally way more than I could have imagined. It corrected my posture, strengthened my joints, and dramatically improved my mental state and overall awareness.

"I&#39;m very hypermobile (to the point dislocations are just a regulat thing- potential hEDS y&#39;know... diagnosis takes a long time), faint often if I&#39;m too active or upright too long, anxious and paranoid as it gets etc etc y&#39;know the whole package- and haven&#39;t done yoga for a long time due to the way it was destabalising my joints and causing pain (originally it was what I was recommended as I had chronic pain, but as I&#39;ve found it&#39;s due to hypermobility, I&#39;ve been advised to stay away from it unless I stay aware of my joints), but I&#39;m gonna try and do this yoga journey not just for breath but to maybe become more aware of how I move my body during exercise- something I miss after having to stop dancing and martial arts in my teenage years and would love to get more active now I&#39;m in my 20s, and especially after the past year I&#39;ve had, hopefully find a little tiny bit of peace. It was really difficult trying to be aware of my joints, aware of my breath, and trying to stay stable in any position, and I had to pause and rest often, if I found myself too shakey, amend my position if I found I was over extending my joints, alter poses to protect my fingers or knees, etc., but it&#39;s only day one, and thought it took me twice as long as the video is, I&#39;ll see how it goes. But it is quite difficult to find length and not overextend and that&#39;s something I hope I can get better at.",lxlliby,2021-01-02T16:26:06Z,0

This was a great Day 1.  I can&#39;t wait to see how we progress throughout the month.,Determined Despite!,2021-01-02T16:18:39Z,1
"I haven&#39;t felt so much resistance and stagnant energy in my body for quite some time... It was really hard to stay present and be compassionate with myself. I&#39;m in a place in my life where I just want to &quot;get there&quot; (get better, feel better, be healthier, be more relaxed, be more creative), so it&#39;s really hard for me not to push myself right now. Yet, there is a strange familiarity to being so immobile and lifeless... I like the term &quot;slow burner&quot;. I feel out of shape, even though I&#39;ve been doing yoga for years. It&#39;s weird how a hard patch in life and many months missed make you feel like a newbie. I am proud of myself. I hope to make it to the end in real time.

Years of running have tightened my hips and hamstrings to a ridiculous amount, and when the gyms closed in December I finally decided to try something new. Your videos have not only helped me physically, but mentally as well❤️",Sarah Scriver,2021-01-02T16:17:11Z,0

"Slowly recovering from painful back. I knew I would not be able to do much more than breathe as I am still fairly immobile. Began Day 1 in tears as even deep breathing hurt my back. It felt like I &quot;couldn&#39;t&quot; breathe deeply - like there was a block there preventing me from belly breathing. But by the end,  there is a smile on my face. I feel as though the breathing has opened things up slightly. I can breathe deeply! So thankful for this!",Rekker Family,2021-01-02T16:16:48Z,0

One of the things I love about yoga is how it grounds me in the moment. In the the world we live in of constant stimulation my focus has been lacking.

During quarantine, I started practising twice a day and kept the routine even when I went back to work at the office. So this year I might need to complement Breath with some other videos to keep my groove going. :)<br />Adriene, you truly change this world for the better, make us believe in our bodies and be kind to our minds and hearts.

"This was a great way to start this journey!  Before the practice, I had washed my hands with a coconut scented soap so everytime we were in prayer position I could smell coconuts!  Since this practice is all about breath I think I will make sure to put on lotion or wash my hands before each practice so I can breathe in a wonderful scent!  The 48 minutes flew by!  Looking forward to Day 2! Namaste",Nancy M,2021-01-02T15:59:04Z,0

I loved listening to Pink Floyd Breathe at the end of day 0 and the end of day 1.. i think I will continue throughout the 30 days. It relaxes me so and reminds me to Breathe.. my New Years resolution is to be more flexible and breath is an important part of that.. thank you for this Adriene!,A J Gathings,2021-01-02T15:58:30Z,0
"As was recommended in the comments, I took note of how many people had viewed day 1 when I started and how many people had viewed when I ended. I can&#39;t believe over 30,000 people just did yoga together at the same time!!! Wow. Thank you all :)",Danielle Smith,2021-01-02T15:58:14Z,6

I am maybe an hour behind most of you and still feel their must me some doing it at the same time ( NY state).  I fell on ice and injured my left wrist a week and 1/2 ago and it is much better but tender and not as strong.  Hoping I can keep up without being imbalanced.

"Thanks so much for doing this! I got a new knee four months ago and have been doing Yoga for Sensitive Knees and walking a lot.  I am ready to let this add this to my growth<br />as I become stronger and more stable.  ALSO, I always blew off (so to speak) the breath part of the practice; this is a great time to tune into that.

Day 1 : Realised I was completely out of shape. My forearms are so stiff that the first exercise with the reverse whists hurts a lot. I&#39;m going to the hand massage more often. It felt good completing the first day. Last year I gave up on day 17 . This year I&#39;m going to write a comment on every video to motivate my self to keep going. Thank you 🙏♾❤🕉,Dalibor Savic,2021-01-02T15:42:16Z,0

8pm at night in China. This is the start of my 6th year with Adriene ! When I started my goal was to do 21 days because I didn&#39;t think that I could even make it to 30 days. Then I made 3 months my goal. Now it&#39;s been five years of (almost) every day with YWA. Adriene has been with me wherever I go and it&#39;s changed my life.

"started 2020 with a sense of who I am and what I want to do next. Then the pandemic hit and I moved back to Europe from Canada to be with family and have been here since last April. My entire sense of self, who I am and what I want, my future plans, have completely collapsed and I&#39;m starting 2021 lost and confused, but also hopeful that things will come together after falling apart, maybe stronger, better and more reassured than before. Thank you, Adriene &lt;3 Love from Prague.<br />P.S. I&#39;ve been waiting for a joke or a &quot;heyooo&quot; all video and then it was so great when it came!

Today’s practice started with some tears on the mat and I found everything more difficult to do than normal, even at the end. It seems to be a definite reflection of my current emotional life. But I’m proud to say I showed up and stuck with it and that I’m grieving in a healthy way. I’m grateful to be part of this community.",Amanda Armstrong,2021-01-02T15:17:00Z,1

I needed this more than I realized at the beginning. It amazes me how Adriane always seems to know when I need to pause and start listening deeply to my inner self - the best gift. Thank you Adriane. So excited to begin the year again with everyone!",Mary Lonzarich,2021-01-02T15:03:33Z,0

"I have been following your practices since I was 16. I am now almost 22 and honestly, you have guided me so much into young adulthood and given me lessons I know I will take through with me for life.

Anyone else doing this whole pregnant. I’m 25 weeks so there’s a fair bump in the way. Be interested to hear what people are doing instead of cobra/folding etc. I’m leaning on my thighs or taking a wider stance for fold and I suppose I could just do cat curls instead of tummy and cobra 🤔🤰🏻,Catriona MacInnes,2021-01-02T14:58:07Z,0

"I have not been taking care of my “fussy wrists”.  Just hearing Adrienne refer to as fussy makes me feel so much better.  All is not lost!   It is a journey. I am going to slow down and take care of them, place more emphasis on core and lower body strength. It is okay that I am taking a step back from planks.  It is even more important to SHOW UP and listen to my body.",Kelly Epting,2021-01-02T14:50:43Z,81
"I&#39;ve been trying to treat my wrists better the past six months or so and for me the most important thing is to just do SOMETHING intentional every day I can. An unusual rotation, a different stretch, even just focusing on hanging them limp! I also really identify with feeling &quot;bad&quot; if I miss a day, but I try to remind myself that no one is giving me a grade on it.

"I think it was about two years ago now, that you truly inspired me to invest in myself, invest in a mat and keep on showing up to it as often as possible. <br /><br />At that time I had recently started to get out of a long period of illness that had me bedridden for a few years. I was tired, weak, depressed, overweight and desperate to find back to life and movement. <br /><br />Two years in and showing up to my mat with your voice guiding me is still a favourite part of my day. I have lost nearly 20 kg. I have become so much stronger and gained stamina. I now go on serious hiking, which is my next favourite activity after yoga. I have found back to my art and even had my first solo exhibition last fall, which did better that what I would ever imagine. I have found so many tools to deal with my chronic illness that I now feel certain that it will never ruin my life again. And I have found so much playfulness in my body that I have regained the childlike vigour that I honestly believe is a key to true happiness. All of this with your voice guiding me through.<br /><br />I was so excited for this year&#39;s program that I dreamt about it all last night 🤣 <br /><br />I have so much gratitude for you Adriene, eternally and ethereal. I would love to send you one of my artworks as a way to share my gratitude and love with you. Take a look at my IG account the_potent_enigma, if you find anything there that speaks to you DM me, and I will mail it to you.<br /><br />All the best, namaste 🙏🏼💜",Gazelle,2021-01-02T14:44:09Z,0

"Thank you Adriene for your beautiful lead on this path.  I have bad knees and have difficulty sitting back and having that deep knee bend and so I found that if I sit on a block turned sideways then I can relax a bit more instead of being so tensed and in pain.

"Sadly couldn’t join you live as just to early for me personally. I started yoga about 1 yr before lockdown here in the uk (3-2020 as mum is high risk) because I have a disabling back injury and so many of the exercises were things my physio, who I was seeing every week, was doing. It meant it freed him up to do other things and I discovered how much I loved it. I tried to carry it on myself in lockdown but I just couldn’t remember enough and to be honest it is helpful in my situation having a real live person giving alternatives for things I can’t do. But when I found you I just loved the way you spoke and had been waiting for you to do another one of these 30 day sessions. I found today real hard, but I adjusted the things I needed to and preserved. I know from experience now that it is hard but it pays off and that there were things today that I had got to the point of them being ‘easy’ before so I know we can get there again if I work at it. And that’s the hardest bit I think as it’s so easy just to not bother. So I am pledging to everyone here to do my best and I hope that there will be community here that will help hold us up to persevering. Thanks for great class one - my dog loved it too, she is is fast 💤 😆",DMG,2021-01-02T14:27:04Z,0

I am a certified yoga instructor.  I love the reminder to slow down in day one as I have had a life time habit of fitting to much in and moving quickly to get even more in. So Thanks!  My regular practice includes sound vibration as I learned the importance of connection with all through chanting.  We are 93 % or more water and our body responds to vibration.  So sing to your favorite song on the radio and have some fun maybe dance a little.   I did 3 om&#39;s to connect with all of you and more at the end of my practice today.

"Showing up today was hard. Really hard. I think I procrastinated for about an hour before taking the courage to lay down my mat and click play on the video. I&#39;ve been doing yoga for 3 years now, but in 2020, and I don&#39;t think I was the only one, I fell into this deep state of pure anxiety/depression/panic, and I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to do anything that was good for me, including yoga. It&#39;s been at least 10 months since I got on the mat, and today I decided to help myself, and allow myself to feel something good after so many months of frustration. I actually injured my right wrist a few weeks ago, and I was a little scared of doing the practice, but how funny, I felt pain for a few moments and now, after completing the practice, it actually feels better (btw, if anyone has any tips for wrist injures, I accept them lol). Point is, if you&#39;ve been away for a long time, like me, and is scared to get back into it, don&#39;t be. Take it easy and allow yourself to feel good :)",Laura Biscaro,2021-01-02T14:13:44Z,0

I am so thankful for Adrienne I don&#39;t know where I would be without her. I got into yoga maybe about 6 months ago but it has been hard for me to commit and find time to practise. I really enjoy doing yoga because I suffer with anxiety and I also have a neck spasm which I go to physotherapy for. Yoga helps a lot with my neck and my mental health.<br />I love this 30 day journey because I feel like Im committed in it. I am so happy with the headspace I am In now all thanks to Adriene xx,sofia De Curtis,2021-01-02T14:11:46Z,1

"Deat Adriene, I first discovered your channel in the fall of 2019 while visiting my niece in North Carolina. I had just retired from a very demanding and high-stress career. I&#39;m in my late 50s and I&#39;ve always taken care of myself in order to stay healthy and strong. Your approach to yoga has opened up a whole new dimension and has added such a critical new component to my health regime. As I sit here, facing the wonderful and promising next chapters of my life, I actually have tears of gratitude streaming down my cheeks. Life has been a pretty incredible journey thus far, and the addition of your calming presence and guidance is equipping me to continue on this path of self-care, self-discovery, and self-enlightenment.  I just wish to thank you sincerely for the dedication you show your community. I can&#39;t begin to express the impact you&#39;ve had on me in the last year since I&#39;ve discovered your channel. You truly are a special soul and I&#39;m so grateful to able to follow your guidance on my journey to becoming the best version of myself. Your channel is a big part of this journey, so thank you again...Namaste.",J.M. Gratton,2021-01-02T13:59:44Z,0

"Heeyy to myself ^^  ~~  <br />to be honest at first the 48 mins mark scared the shit out of me , but then this is Adriene i&#39;m practicing with, and i know it&#39;s gonna be a fun ride, totally worth every second, <br /><br />and not like i was doing some EXTRAORDINARY things with my time to begin with<br />in the contrary, i&#39;ll be doing myself a big favor by sticking to this journey ^_____^ i know it !! i&#39;ll stick to it this time for sure (insha-allah) , because, and even tho i&#39;m ashamed to say it, i have tried the other journeys Adriene made for us, but i&#39;ve always fell behind and end up not picking the mat, making myself sink a little further in disappointment in my own self , and losing other pieces of my confidence , which accumulates with other failures , and promises that i broke with myself , making me unconsciously believe that i&#39;m just a full of talk loser, this despair will eventually blind my eyes towards other aspects of my life , where i shined brightly, where i stood up so strong, where i pulled myself together, it made me blind to the other hopeful and full of color parts of my life, it made me feel like my happiness is only in the faaaaaaaaaar future , which is so faaaaaaaaar that i won&#39;t even move to make it happen; <br /><br />i won&#39;t let myself fall in that trap again, NEVER; since i decided , and i committed to prove to myself how much of an outstanding, incredible and full of miracles person that i am, ONLY if i gave myself the chance she NEEDS and the time it deserves to showcase that potential, to bring that future that seemed so far away right in front of her, right in from of YOU MERIEM ^^ <br />and to your surprise Mereim , the JOURNEY is fun too ^__^ you gonna enjoy every step you take because it&#39;s for yourself , and because finally moving towards your dreams is so beautiful ^^ ~~<br /> <br />what if you fall you ask? well i&#39;ll pick you up right the next day, week or even two weeks, maybe even month, in the end that too is just part of the beautiful journey we embarked in, and in the future it&#39;ll make the picture even more beautiful and magical; look at all the failures i made up till now , do i hate them ? hell no , they were part of me , they make me , so what makes slacking a week any different than slacking for years ?? ... it&#39;s actually more reasonable to hold each others hand and get back to our journey , to the road to our beautiful future as quick , as determined and as happy and excited as possible ^^<br /><br /><br />So yeaah~~ i need to renew my commitment every day (as much as possible) , i need to show up on to the mat and commit to this journey full-heartedly, to see the &quot; my self &quot;  the &quot;Meriem&quot; after this month who finished the whole journey , along side my other 2 commitments that i made with myself ( learning Graphic Design and Draw a box ) so then it&#39;ll be our 1st BIG step towards our dreams and our beautiful future <br /><br />and what is better that having Adriene and all the other beautiful people towards the world that i know have similar and different reasons to show up to practice with me and with us, it&#39;s just the perfect recipe that anyone would ask for to get back on my dream&#39;s road :)<br /><br />and i&#39;m confident to say : &quot; if it&#39;s me i know i can do it ; i will do it for me  , i&#39;ll do it for you Meriem ; i&#39;m my own hero , I&#39;M YOUR HERO MERIEM, TRUST ME . &quot; <br /><br />so YEAAH!!~~ that was about it ^^ i&#39;m so happy, excited and committed to show to myself how an incredible person i am, <b>she is a strong BITCH !!</b> LOL<br /> <br />Lastly, THANK YOU Adriene for giving me a chance, to at least show this type of commitment to myself, and a chance address this inner conflicts that i didn&#39;t really get to address . <br />i LOVE YOU SO MUCH and can&#39;t wait to practice with you, Namaste ~~ &lt;3 .",Mer iem,2021-01-02T13:52:19Z,1

"Thank you so much as always for this! <br />Suggestion: I would love additional modification information, specifically for plus size/ larger bodies. ie in runners lunge when my tummy and boobs are smooshing together so my hands don&#39;t reach the ground, my knee wants to fall out to the side. Is that okay? Or should I move my foot out and open my hips? Or use blocks? Etc. This happens a lot more than someone in a smaller body might realize.<br /><br />Just more modification information in general would be really appreciated.<br /><br />Love this channel and am so grateful for everything you do.",Kelly McKenzie,2021-01-02T13:49:50Z,1

"That was FANTASTIC. I&#39;ve been looking forward to doing a 30-day program &quot;live&quot; with you since I did Dedicate back in May. I was positively giddy for at least the first 7 minutes of the video, grinning from ear to ear. I have to say, I used to be a gymnast, so I&#39;m no stranger to movement and stretching, and whenever I have stretched my wrists  while on all fours it was always forward and backward and side to side. Doing it in a circular motion was a revelation. Can&#39;t wait to see what else I learn on this journey. THANK YOU ADRIENE. We are lucky to have you.<br /><br />As a graphic designer, I also want to give a shoutout to the artist who designed the BREATH logo and selected (or perhaps even designed?) the font for the titles. It&#39;s so airy, simple, clean, and beautiful. What a wonderful job.",David Finkelstein,2021-01-02T13:44:30Z,0

"Thank you Adriene.<br />I spent most of yesterday feeling my entire back aching for some movement, after a considerable lack thereof the past few weeks, and slow and steady was just the ticket. I also surprised myself by how easy lowering to the belly from plank felt. My wrists felt surprisingly fine, until I did the self-massage and I notice a slight soreness on pressure. Gentle is the way forward.<br /><br />But most importantly, I could feel my mind still. I&#39;ve been easily annoyed and irritable lately, and coming back to the mat gave me the space to recognise, accept and let go. <br /><br />Thank you for the invitation to go easy, I look forward to building the strength back up.",Hanna Lingman,2021-01-02T13:42:55Z,0

(As well as February and March...) but yoga will get me through it ☀🌙<br /><br /><br />I was forced to slow down by my computer which decided that it wants to cancell its connection to the Internet in the middle of the palractice by the way.<br />Love when that happens, super relaxing...😑",clara K.,2021-01-02T13:38:49Z,1

"V moving to think of us all doing our best and embarking on this journey together but individually 💖 wishing everyone a healthy, successful 2021. Thanks Adriene 🙏🏻 I also have a question for any people with a fuller bust, or any yoga teachers etc:<br /><br />I have always found it disheartening that runners’ lunges are impossible for me, because my chest getting in the way means my arms absolutely cannot reach over my knee to the floor. The distance of my shin, plus my chest on top of it is longer than my arms! Hope that makes sense.<br /><br />Does anyone know of any modifications for this pose? I’ve tried wearing compressing sports bras and even ‘rearranging’ things, but no luck. It really gets me down when I’m otherwise enjoying my practice and progress. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.<br /><br />Good luck everyone. Looking forward to congratulating us all for completing this in 30 days! 🧡🧡🧡",Chloë C,2021-01-02T13:34:22Z,1

"Thank you, Adriene! In late 2019 I herniated a disk in my lumbar spine. I&#39;ve not done yoga since. It took the better part of 13 months to feel strong and healed enough to give it a shot, as for the longest time I could not bend forward or fully stretch my left leg without a sciatica flare up.<br /><br />Today I gave yoga a chance again and it was a success! Your gentle approach and slow start was perfect and allowed me to be mindful and push myself as comfortable. While I don&#39;t expect all 30 days to be as easy, right now I&#39;m feeling optimistic.",Jennifer TW,2021-01-02T13:33:52Z,2

Self betterment!!!! Gonna be perfect!!!!”<br />Intention- “slow down girl.  Let’s just be where we are.  Be authentic.”",carendale,2021-01-02T12:52:22Z,0

And here I am at the end of the practice. Thank you Adriene. I needed this now more than ever. This isn&#39;t the first time you saved me from losing myself. And I just want to tell you thank you.

"Glad I made this practice as I’ve been struggling to do my yoga since I lost my dog Saffy to pneumonia in November. I’ve struggled on 2 counts, one because I miss her sitting watching me like Benji and 2 because yoga is all about the breath and it brings back the vision of her struggling to breathe. By the end of this practice I had managed to concentrate on my own body a bit, so I hope the 30 days will see me through to a happier place, especially as yoga with Adriene has helped me all through lockdown!",Judith Glover,2021-01-02T12:29:40Z,0

"I did it. First day of the 30 journey. I am doing this for first time... I have done many yogas of Adriene since 2018 ig and before that I practiced a bit from others. But nothing is as satisfying as YWA. I recently around may/june discovered about the playlists. And God!! So helpful!!

"This class definitely didn&#39;t feel as 48 min, it was harder than I expected sometimes (my right wrist seems to be very tight, didn&#39;t know that! Already making new discoveries lol), I heard plenty of cracking of bones but I enjoyed the ease. I woke up early out of nowhere but it was the perfect timing to get up and do this class first thing before it gets too hot down here. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m here, breathing. Day 1 in!<br /><br />Edit: over 20000 people did this class along with me ❤️ we are not alone.",Gabriela F,2021-01-02T12:06:53Z,46

"3 years ago I discovered my love for Yoga thanks to this challenge. But over the last year I started to get lost in all the Instagram type of Yoga, trying to push my body into all kinds of crazy poses and I feel like I lost the spark and the magic in my practice. Returning to this Challenge today in hopes to find my passion for it again by going inwards and this first day was so challenging. I am so excited and grateful to be practicing with new and seasoned yogis all over the world. Happy New year and Namasté ❤️",maggie moon,2021-01-02T12:06:37Z,0

"This slow paced beginning stirred me up deep inside. I started my yoga journey with Adriene back in 2015 with the 30 days of yoga. My practice has grown since then, and today I happily realized how much I still have to learn from mindful breathing and slowing down. ❤️ Gracias, Adriene for your loving invitation to grow our yoga practice from within. 🌺 Thank you, lovely yogis around the world for sharing words (and worlds) of love and encouragement. 💖 Happy 2021 and hugs from a Colombian in Norway!",Kaa 739,2021-01-02T12:04:53Z,0

"I love that the mic pics up your heart beat! It is oddly comforting in the little moments, very grounding to hear another person&#39;s very essence beating along with yours.<br />This practice was tough for me. I used to practice yoga a lot, but have been absent from my mat for over a year. I was filled with thoughts about how I used to be much &quot;better&quot; at it, use to be much stronger, etc...so I was feeling a bit down about myself. But throughout the practice, I kept remembering your teaching of &quot;honoring where you are&quot;. That kept me breathing and moving forward.<br />I am where I am today, and I am very excited to see where the journey takes me over the next 30 days (especially because it aligns almost perfectly with my last month of veterinary school)!<br />Lots of love from Edinburgh &lt;3",Brooke Ann,2021-01-02T11:55:14Z,0

I have been really sick for the whole last year and everything escalated into a bedridden state, where I was unable to even sit for almoust 2 months. As Im recovering and very slowly getting my strenght back I was more then happy to be able to be here. This 48 minute were in some parts like hardcore cross fit for me and I was practicing how to be gentle and grateful for whatever my body allowed me to do. Thank you for your gentleness, kindness, peace, love, light and everything that I deeply enjoy right now.

"Loved this so much. When I saw the first session was 48 minutes I was filled with dread a bit. I usually stick to sessions under 30 minutes because I find it difficult to focus and stay in the moment and it makes me anxious thinking of all the things I should be doing in place of taking time for myself. But today I just allowed myself to focus on each posture and just listen and respond and the thoughts about everything else just didn&#39;t appear.

"I really enjoyed day 1! My first day. I did it first thing after getting up, before even brushing my teeth, it was a nice way to wake up. I&#39;m looking forward to growing the strength in my wrists! And it felt easier than before for me to be really present and notice and listen to my body and what it was saying. When you said engage the thigh muscles to take some pressure of the fingers, it was such a small change that made a huge difference!!",Sara Evans,2021-01-02T11:44:32Z,0

"19300 people did this practice at the same time as me... this is incredible. I am hugging you all!!!! &lt;3 I did yoga with Adriene almost every day since March 2020 and something funny happened to me. 3 weeks ago I decided to go to a yoga studio for a beginners handstand workshop and I HATTTEEEED it so much... I suddenly felt so disconnected from my practice. It was so so physical, like every girl trying to achieve and do all these crazy asanas perfectly... and for me, yoga has a lot to do with spirituality, and with the fact it makes me connect with myself, and my body and my breath. And to accept me and my boundaries. Since then I felt so discouraged and I barely haven&#39;t practiced yoga. I was feeling pretty bad about it. So I want this journey to be a journey home again, to love yoga and overall, to love my practice and the way I understand yoga. I am excited. I love you Adriene. x",souslalune,2021-01-02T11:40:36Z,0
I also hated the first studio class I did because the type of yoga (Iengar yoga) was very demanding physically and not right for me. But then I tried other classes (mostly hatha yoga) and loved them. So dont be discouraged to try other classes. And the of course continue with adrienne at home ! :-),Anne-Cecile Renard,2021-01-02T12:43:42Z,1

"Greetings from Brisbane Australia! <br /><br />I&#39;m finally ready to work on my mental health and yoga is one of the things I am focusing on. I&#39;ve done yoga casually the past few years, but never stuck with it long enough to see any results, and I was never in the headspace to care. But now as the depression fog lifts, I find myself wanting to feel strong instead of just saying I&#39;m strong. This will be the first challenge I&#39;ve been a part of as it happens and it will be the first challenge I intend to finish, and beyond. <br /><br />I am grateful to you Adriene, Benji and the Find What Feels Good team, for creating a beautiful community for people and all the different challenges they face, to have a space to just be and feel some sense of peace. And have quite a few laughs along the way. <br /><br />Here&#39;s to many more hey-ohs, full bottle experiences and baggy sweater love caves. <br /><br />Namaste <br /><br />Nikki 💖",Nikki Boswell,2021-01-02T11:34:58Z,0

"Day 1: I have never done a yoga class before. Your channel was recommended in a newsletter from Caitlin DeSilva and I have always wanted to try yoga so I thought I would give this challenge a try. As a bigger person I couldn&#39;t touch my toes or the mat, I had a hard time being in the plank positions and nearly gave up twice. However, I promised myself I would commit this year, so I altered some movements to suit me and even looked to Benji to help me on this journey. Overall I committed, I didn&#39;t give up on this challenge and I didn&#39;t give up on myself and I&#39;m so excited to continue my journey with you all.<br /><br />Day 2: WHAT IS THIS! I woke up this morning in a Euphoric glow. I felt happy, confident in my body that normally feels like a prison. I was alert and focused and craving my workout and yoga class? It’s only day 2 but I’m sad when class ends. I still can’t do most positions but I’m hooked. I’m already starting to crave tomorrow’s class. Thankyou for this wonderful euphoric trance and newfound love for myself and my body.<br /><br />Day 3: I did downward dog today, only for a second but I did it! I also held a plank for a second there as well, my hands are not hurting so bad when I’m on my hands and knees.

"Just finished.. feel amazing as always.. I’m Australian but living in Greece at the moment, separated from my adult daughter. Yoga calms my soul when I feel uneasy. Adriene’s videos suit me, she has a calming voice and for some reason I don’t feel pressured if I’m feeling off, even though no one is watching, lol. I started these videos two years ago when I was going through some very personal things, it’s the best thing I’ve ever done for myself. I’m stronger, mentally and physically and calmer. I’m currently concentrating on crow pose, it’s a challenge. Anyway thank you Adriene for spreading the love and peace. 💕",Tina Cardwell,2021-01-02T11:11:29Z,1

Toward the end as we lay on the floor (sorry I am new so don&#39;t know the yoga position names, yet) Sofie woke and started to lick my feet!!!! Made me smile so much :)) and squirm at the same time. She never licks my feet. Perhaps she felt my calmness too. Thanks Adriene, that was an awesome start to my day.",Claire Speight,2021-01-02T11:05:32Z,1

"It could be a lot of things, but when that happens to me it&#39;s usually because I&#39;m holding my breath or taking deeper breaths than my body is used to (when we&#39;re anxious we have a tendency to take quick shallow breaths, so forcing yourself to take deeper breaths is good, but your body may need to adjust....kind of like someone that&#39;s starving suddenly eating and then feeling sick afterwards). Also, are you drinking enough water throughout your day? You could be dehydrated. If you&#39;re doing this first thing in the morning, you might also need a small snack, like an apple and some nuts before practice. I also notice that if my sinuses are bothering me I have the dizzy/nausea feeling also. When that happens it&#39;s okay to not let your head hang down below your waste, but modify as needed. I hope that helps ❤️",Shannon Pitts,2021-01-02T11:55:47Z,0

So I work in the Restaurant industry - don’t need to say this holiday season has been a doozy - because of scheduling and dog-tiredness, really fell off my yoga routine and have been smoking cigarettes A LOT because of the stress. This yoga journey was written for me wanting to reset and redirect my energies - and this first video was no disappointment. I need to ease in and go slow and I appreciated all of the time and intention to wake the body back up to movement and listening. I am so excited for the rest of this journey.

"Adriene, thank you so much! ❤ I had no idea how much I missed this and needed that! During the spring 2020 I practiced with you for more than 2 months - the first 30 days of yoga and the videos for beginners and foundations of yoga. But than I stopped and couldn&#39;t get myself to practice again. But this new program with your emails for every day... that&#39;s been the perfect motivation. And maaaaan, how much I am glad. 😊 I felt it - everything. This practice was a stress relief for me and made me feel much calmer and positive. It helped me with my stomach and digestion, too (after all the junk - yet tasty - food I&#39;ve eaten during the holidays 🤣). Today I truly felt a huge impact of being here and practicing on my mind and my body. And I also have a hope for this to be the push I&#39;ve been needing this whole time to get better, happier and to do something with my life. Thanks again! You are may saviour. 🥰 All love from Czech republic. Looking forward to tomorrow&#39;s practice!",Daniela Mocková,2021-01-02T10:49:02Z,0
"First comment to Adriene&#39;s video, just refreshed the views after finishing the practice, so from 32,000 views to 62,000 views, trying to get my head around that. May the deep breath be with you :))) Practicing from Scotland. Grateful for this journey. Namaste",and77top,2021-01-02T10:48:50Z,0

This practice was challenging for me too despite having been doing yoga with Adriene for almost two years now. And yet I am still here because this regular practice has made me feel so much better both physically and mentally. I truly believe that if you stick with it, you will start enjoying the same benefits soon! I&#39;m very happy you&#39;re here! Namaste!",u_k,2021-01-02T10:21:50Z,8

"Thank you so much Adriene for this amazing practice. What a way to start off the year!  ❤ Thank you so much. I&#39;ve been healing from an injury in my toe (I shattered the bones in my big toe...) so I have been able to do any yoga for the past 6 months as I&#39;m still experiencing and healing the nerve damage in that big toe. My toe isn&#39;t as flexible as it used to be, so I have a hard time doing yoga. Any modifications you can think of during the times where we should &#39;curl our toes under&#39;?  I&#39;m so grateful to start this journey again with all of you! I&#39;m looking forward to see what my body can do, and what my breath brings :).

From asking and waiting for answers - to being the observer, and see what happens. Okay! That&#39;s it.

Good morning 🌅 I woke up earlier than expected and wanted to get on the mat even though I did yoga just before bed. <br /><br />This Practise was hard at first to perservere with keeping still but it gradually got easier the more I surrendered and trusted you. <br /><br />I often keep the eyes closed as long as I can and I felt a sense of euphoria and buzz of new energy running though me.

"I&#39;ve never been a &quot;sportsy&quot; person as a kid, at all. I hated sports. For the last five or so years, I started exercising in various ways, but nothing stuck with me for too long. I did go to a power yoga class at my uni for multiple semesters and liked it, although it often felt rushed, was only weekly, and felt boring to do by myself at home. Adriene changed this for me. Doing YWA for about a month and a half gave me so much! It&#39;s such a personal learning experience and growth both physically and mentally! I can&#39;t even stress how big of a role this plays for me mentally nowadays! Also, the fact that there are so many of us doing this together, plus all the uplifting commentary makes it feel so much nicer and personal! Thanks, Adriene and thanks to everyone else here! Wishing everyone the happiest year of 2021! Greetings from the Czech Republic.",Jan Neumann,2021-01-02T09:44:07Z,0
"<b>BREATH 🌬day 1/30:</b><br />Hi fellow yogis and happy new year!👋🏻🌟💕<br />This is the 2nd time I’m joining a YWA yoga journey (in real time). I tried to do 365 days of yoga last year, and I kinda fell out of it towards the end of the year, but now I’m trying to get back in. I’ve been struggling a little bit with my mental health lately, so I hope this will help me ease into 2021 and start it on a better note than I ended 2020.👍🏻<br />Oh, and I’m getting a puppy next Friday, so I’ll have my own yoga assistant soon!🐶💕😊<br />Namaste.🙏🏻",Lea Jacobsen,2021-01-02T09:43:33Z,0

"Hi Relar! One of the most important things about a yoga practice is to meet yourself where you&#39;re at. So if you feel uncoordinated or unbalanced, just breathe and do what you can in the moment. This might mean doing a modification -- maybe you can&#39;t lift up your arm in the lunge today, and that&#39;s okay. The focus can be on putting less weight on the hand (instead of completely lifting it up), breathing, and keeping the core tight. Regardless of what Adriene is saying or doing in the video, first and foremost pay attention to what your body is telling you and find an alternative as you slowly build up strength and flexibility.",Adrianna B,2021-01-02T10:10:27Z,0

"That felt SO GOOD! Thank you. 🧡🧡🧡🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🧡🧡🧡  These 30 Day Journeys at the start of the year are so great for establishing a new habit. And my yoga postures are better than ever, because when you&#39;re not &#39;trying to&#39;, it flows by itself. Because we don&#39;t inter-fear with our bodies, they know what they&#39;re doing, when we let them and work with them, not &#39;on&#39; them  :D <br /><br />Doing THIS to set the tone for the year is the BEST. My intention: I AM CLEAR ON WHY I&#39;M HERE. Feel free to use it  :)  <br />2020 sure helped focus that, but this even more. It&#39;s already powerfully showing itself. Adriene, Benji, Chris, and all you lovelies from our global family, you rock!!<br /><br />Thank you so much for being here exactly as you are - and HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU!  🧡🧡🧡🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🧡🧡🧡",Poetry Powers Prosperity,2021-01-02T09:15:41Z,0

"Guilty of speeding up the video to 1.25 x for some minutes 😅<br /><br />I found it hard to go this slow peaced. I can&#39;t tell why but I don&#39;t feel like getting into deep listening of my inner world these days. Maybe I feel more like doing something physical.<br />To listen to what I felt was good I had to make it faster.<br /><br />I&#39;ll stick to the journey though. I&#39;d like to know why I don&#39;t feel like deep connecting to myself sometimes. So I try to trust the process and see where it leads. <br /><br />One thing is for sure, the community showing up in the comment section is extremely helpful ❤️<br /><br />And for the people that joined us for the first time today: WELCOME! 🌞🌞🌞",Giulia Montanari,2021-01-02T09:14:31Z,1

Day one in the books. It was a little difficult for me to take the time today. I have to work the late shift at the hospital and tomorrow the early shift. So I got a very short day and the practice took its time. It was totally worth it. I feel great to start the day. Feeling calm and breathing deep.

"I also have wrist pain and do some of the palm on floor moves with my fists on the floor instead, staying attentive to my arm posture. Also if downward dog is painful, try puppy posture with forearms on the floor. Keep knees on floor for planks etc to take pressure off arms.

I wish I were young, fit and pain free but it is what it is and I know you will guide me.  I made it through our longest class today, so feeling positive about the days to come and I shall meet my edge, adjust and breathe through as I always do ... awesome !

I really want to keep up with this as I know we’ll feel amazing at the end of the month so I’ll just smooth out the difficult bits and get that feel good factor of joining in. I wonder if wrist supports would help ?

"So thankful for this Yoga Journey. I feel like I haven’t been in the right mental space to follow through with the other journeys, maybe because  I was showing up late to the party.

I sprained my lower back this morning before doing this practice so I&#39;m feeling very delicate and had to take it a lot easier than usual today.. Not the way I was expecting to begin 2021 or this journey but I&#39;m still so thrilled to begin this series and connect deeper with breath practice. It&#39;s exactly what I need right now. Here&#39;s to showing up!!,Kate Champain,2021-01-02T08:18:44Z,0
"I felt so WHOLE during that final exhale. This is my third year in a row doing this challenge and not only am I blown away by how differently I am this year, mentally and physically, but also how deeply comforted I was by the thought of so many people around the world being with me at that moment. It&#39;s so easy to feel alone right now, even in a house full of people you love, especially when struggling with a mental illness that feels beyond me, but just the idea of having all of you with me for 30 days is truly magical. Sending lots of love, peace, and grace! Life and healing is a journey, just as this 30-day challenge will be. Thank you always, Adriene! You have changed so many of our lives and continuously do so - just by being YOU!",Paper Cups and Paperbacks,2021-01-02T08:18:39Z,74

"I  live in Minnesota and it&#39;s chilly here as well!  10 degrees Fahrenheit at 10 pm which isn&#39;t too bad for January! I just discovered Adrienne in March of 2020 when the yoga studio I practiced and worked  at shut down due to Covid. One of my daughters told me about her. I really like her style of teaching and she seems truly kind, and then there&#39;s sweet Benji too! Discovering Adrienne was one of the few joys I found in 2020. Looking forward to this 30 day journey with people from all over the world!",Mary Thompson,2021-01-03T04:52:41Z,2
"I&#39;m here in Maine, USA. I had to bundle up too! Warm leggings, cozy fleece, and big wool socks, and a big wool blanket for Shavasana! I look forward to the next 30 days with y&#39;all!",Noreen Mullaney,2021-01-03T00:19:14Z,1

"I have been on many of your thirty day practices and last year. I practiced almost every day. I wasn&#39;t sure if I was going to join this one but I woke at 6am when the practice went live and I&#39;m glad I did, there is something about knowing that people all over the world are practice with you.

"I&#39;m normally not one to leave comments on videos, but I really wanted to thank you and Benji for getting me through 2020 and all of the covid madness! I&#39;m a college student and last spring term was going to take yoga, but since we went remote, we were pretty much left to our own devices as far as finding activities that we would log in at the end of the week for class credit.  I struggled to find a yoga channel with a series that was simple, yet challenging for a somewhat beginner.  Your 30 day yoga journey for last year really helped me stay engaged, mindful, and on track. I learned so much and felt much more at home in my body. When I returned to campus and took a Hatha Yoga course, I could feel the muscle memory from the journey, feeling in shape and in control. Letting the breath do the work has really really stuck with me, and apply it to many areas of my life, even the non-physical! I just really wanted to thank you, and Benji too!",Taylor Olson,2021-01-02T06:43:47Z,0

"This will be my first time trying this challenge. <br />Any tips from those that have been doing this for years or any wise words to keep me going??? I struggle with energy, not being able to get out of the bed, or simply carry out daily tasks (depression?). And I’m really looking to make a change in my life because I can’t keep doing THIS. I’m so excited to start this and I really hope I can stick to it. ❤️",itskarimarima,2021-01-02T06:10:03Z,6
"When I struggle with my depression I tell myself that it&#39;s okay. As long as I&#39;m on the mat I can spend the whole session sitting or lying down and just breathe. I almost always end up doing at least a little neck stretching and a few cat-cows, because getting on the mat truly is the hardest part.",Anna Sarwe,2021-01-02T10:30:50Z,2
"Like the others say, the most important thing to to focus on is just getting yourself on the mat and pressing play. I always remind myself that whatever happens after that is time well spent. You don&#39;t have to do all the moves &#39;perfectly&#39; or exhaust yourself if you have no energy. Even if you&#39;re just breathing consciously in a restful position, you&#39;re doing something good for yourself :)",Kate Champain,2021-01-02T08:29:27Z,2
"This is my tip! Line up the video the night before - set your alarm for a time when you can do this with no distractions and then just stumble out of bed and on to the mat. Don&#39;t use willpower - don&#39;t psyche yourself up - just get to the already set-up video and mat and just turn it on. Because you will lose willpower and motivation so you have to just trick yourself into getting there. And then just let Adriene take you through the process. Just allow it to happen - don&#39;t fight it, motion before emotion! But yes, set it all up in a way to let yourself win. You can do it! It&#39;s ONLY 30 days out of your whole life but it WILL change you in amazing ways. This is my 4th (or is it 5th??)  30 days challenge and they are incredible. Good luck!",Sarah Woodward,2021-01-02T07:11:12Z,3
"You are in good hands, with lots of friends.  Make this a priority and you won&#39;t be sorry.  You can do it!",Julie Gaumond,2021-01-02T07:07:47Z,1
"If you take a look, you&#39;ll see that in the short time it&#39;s been up there have already been over 7,000 people watching the video. Try to think about that, and how you may be doing it alone in your home but you are not alone while doing it! <br /><br />Also, if I find that I&#39;m exhausted or struggling mid-video, I allow myself the moment to settle into child&#39;s pose for long enough to catch my breath before moving on.",Jaime R,2021-01-02T06:55:32Z,3

"This is my 3rd year doing the 30 days 😍 I&#39;m so excited<br />I remember last year I also commented on the first video saying that I live in Syria and how Adriene helped me through a lot. And I got A LOT of amazing comments from the most beautiful people ever. I keep going back to those comments whenever I feel down and they make me feel great, united and know that I&#39;m not alone.<br />This year I&#39;m doing the 30 days in The Netherlands, I had wished for that last year when I did the 30 days and now it&#39;s happening and I&#39;m very happy 😍<br />I love this community and it&#39;s like a family to me and I LOVE YOU ADRIENE SO MUCH ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<br />Happy new year lovely people 😍<br />amaste 🙏🏻",Hend Radwan,2021-01-02T06:07:43Z,27

"So nice to feel connected, I personally discovered lovely Adriene when I was living in Canada 4 years ago! Now being back in Aus, I do miss practicing live but given the comments I&#39;m going to have to save this practice til the following mornings else sleep may be difficult. So grateful to join you all in a peaceful start to the year, although very challenging for many atm it is far more calmer than this time last year when the bushfires were burning our town here in Batemans Bay. Big love to all the Sydney siders who aren&#39;t buying into the fear, our little town needs you xx",G C,2021-01-02T11:13:06Z,1
