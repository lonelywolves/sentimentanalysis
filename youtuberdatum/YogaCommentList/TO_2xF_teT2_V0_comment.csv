"This yoga practice is such a world community connector.  I work at a Covid 19 vaccine clinic, and was caring for a woman who had fallen on her way in.  So many people come with great nerves.  Anyway a team of nurses, EMT, and supports were gathered to treat her wounds and provide for her.  We talked about what calms us and the ‚Äúwoman‚Äù said, I have done yoga for over 50 years, 10 minutes every morning.  Then all the rest of us chimed in that we were doing yoga most days during this pandemic.  It turns out we are all doing Yoga with Adriene (except for the person who fell and likely does her own thing well).  It was a great moment of connection.   I have many friends and relatives who are also enjoying Adriene‚Äôs teachings daily.  Thank you Adriene for this gift to me and to so many!",Liz Etheridge,2021-02-24T22:16:32Z,1

It also wasn&#39;t supporting my low back and it was all just too much and I gave up on those poses...I do not feel empowered today. I feel like I chose the wrong practice this morning!

Thank you for your videos. I notice that while your instructions are about breathing in through the nose your exhalation are mostly through the mouth. Is there a specific reason why you may you doing so? A lot of people watch your videos and may get the impression that this is the right way to breathe. Although yogic science particularly emphasises nasal breathing on both inhalations and exhalations. Mouth breathing is reserved for certain specific practices. And even top research papers are proving how imp it is breathe through the nose for balancing the nervous system. But many people who watch your videos may get the impression that is all right to breathe out through the mouth on a regular basis. Just curious so asking!,Deepa Bhat,2021-02-22T14:30:33Z,0

This was a little bit more challenging for me. Sometimes the different poses that I&#39;m not really used to (now that I&#39;m typing that it makes sense) are discomforting.

I feel like they&#39;re genuinely thought out really well specifically to help flow through the month seamlessly, and even from one month to another (from BREATH to BRIDGE, etc). What I&#39;m trying to get at, is that my low back has been aching quite a bit the last few days, but after this I feel like all that tension has now eased, feeling decompressed, and like I was a rusty machine that just got a good oiling, if that makes sense (LOL)!

"BRIDGE day 5. Over a month of yoga. I&#39;ve never done yoga beyond the thirty day January session before (this time BREATH). I&#39;ve struggled to complete videos for the past week. Just for today, what helped was actively body-scanning before the session, and then doing what Adriene often says: set an intention. My intention was to be present and to be patient. I thought that what that means is actively doing an audible breath and returning to each breath as a beginning, so in other words actively releasing future-tripping, body-shaming and past-judgments, and treating breaths as an arrival. For patience, rather than &#39;being&#39; patient, I tried to actively release impatience with a mouth exhale. Just for today, that kept me grounded and able to be curious and find play in today&#39;s video. As Adriene said about making &#39;Find what feels good&#39; my own, I&#39;m happy to be finally using as many of the tools that I remembered (from a variety of places) and making them my own collage. My own growth. Just for today. Namaste.",Valerie Kroneanu,2021-02-05T09:55:26Z,94

"Picking YWA up again, day two. Did 16 minutes flex yesterday. Good. Today felt really good. Have had rotator cuff surgery both shoulders, modified the &quot;side plank&quot; a couple of times so my whole arm was on the floor. Have to sit on a bolster off and on. I&#39;m 4&#39;10&#39;. Longer torso, shorter legs and arms. When one of your legs was up and you were grabbing your toe I compared. My arm is straight up to grab that toe and yours has maybe 20% to 30% bend at elbow. I knew my arms were short proportionally, but this was a &#39;grab a second look&#39; awakening. I&#39;m all into options and workarounds. I have scoliosis and recurring sciatica (which always works out completely with Yoga sessions). Time passed, but I always keep coming back.  And may I mention that I am 75. The shoulder surgeries dealt a big blow to my practice, along with a few other things here and there. I think you are a terrific teacher. I count on the patter to keep reminding me about self-care. If I couldn&#39;t do it anymore, I would tune in just for that infusion of meaning, self-caring and intent. Thanks so much.",gessew,2020-10-21T09:45:22Z,0

"I&#39;m super embarrassed to say this but when I did the reclining leg stretch, I felt sharp pain in my back. I&#39;m only adding this here because I have done this before and I have done it very well with no pain. But now I have pain. So I&#39;m wondering what anyone recommends for gentle yoga while my back gets better or if I should wait until its better?? Also curious as to what I must have done? On each side, I had a sharp pain in my mid-back? Using icy-hot. Would love to still do yoga but wont if it just needs to heal up, no matter how minor it is. Thanks for any advice.",Madisyn Michele Schuldt,2020-09-29T19:40:41Z,0

It got so bad today that I was hunched over everytime I got up from the patio chair. I did this sequence once with one more other 20 minute YT yoga sequence by Yoga Dose for the lower back (his sequence is different) and now my lower back stopped spasming.

I‚Äòm pretty depressed today and was thinking of switching today‚Äòs practice on the calendar out with something more attuned to my emotions. I thought I‚Äòd give this one a try anyway and it actually turned out to be just right. Low to the ground and a little challenging but nothing that would make me work up a huge sweat. The side angle leg lifting (can‚Äòt remember what it‚Äòs called) made me concentrate on grounding myself and spreading awareness through my whole body. And I actually managed to get my legs somewhat straight which they usually aren‚Äòt ever lol. I thought this wouldn‚Äòt be right for me today but turns out Adriene somehow magically picked out the perfect practice.

Pain is a vicious cycle.<br />My question for Adrienne and everybody else is : what can I put under my back to support it more when we do poses on our back?

"Adriene, I absolutely LOVE your videos. However, I have misophonia and in some parts of some of your videos you make a clicking sound with your mouth that makes it hard for me to focus and remain calm. Is this anything that you are aware of and think you could maybe work on? I am not meaning this in any way to be critical - I know that you are simply just speaking and making natural noises with your mouth. However, it disrupts me from my relaxed state and I deeply wish to keep enjoying your videos.",Carly Blau,2020-08-12T15:59:19Z,0

As I continue to go to the mat with you it enables me to live life and thrive instead of just survive. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

"Hello Adrienne. I have been doing your wonderful yoga sessions this year and I am really enjoying the variety you offer. Something for whatever mood I&#39;m in. I would really appreciate you a session that focuses on helping reduce &quot;turkey neck&quot;, and will assist with toning the facial and neck exercises. I am 65, and determined to feel and look as good as possible for as long as possible. That is in addition to staying fit and flexible and very healthy into my old age. Thanks for all you give to all of us out here. Suzanne in Australia",Suzanne Wilkins,2020-07-22T22:45:27Z,0

I don&#39;t need help with visualization or feeling a way that you&#39;re trying to guide me to feel. I simply want to know the art and mechanics of the pose. I suggest using your words to guide me through a pose, not a feeling, that way we get more poses and learning in the time spent on the video. Best wishes!",Triya Smith,2020-07-16T06:55:04Z,0

"Thank you so very much, Adrienne   ü§óü§óü§ó <br />My Fit Me coach, Lauren Robertson, recommended that I follow your videos for increasing my flexibility and loosening up some tension in my body.  I&#39;ve been doing your neck, shoulders, and upper back video for a couple of weeks now every morning before work. I&#39;m a pediatric home health nurse. Today, I decided to switch things up and do this video. Just what I needed.  Very humbling, indeed.  Yesterday, I decided I was going to get my body to work towards being able to do splits üòÖ which even as a kid I didn&#39;t ever fully master.  Now, I&#39;m much further from mastering it, but I&#39;m not going to let that stop me.

"First of all, I would like to say: Thank you, Adriene! Your guidance is helping me not only with increasing my strength and flexibility but also with reconnecting to myself, to my inner child and reinforcing my self-confidence. I did this video after finishing the very first 30 Days of Yoga challenge you posted almost 5 years ago and I have to say, it had been frustrating for me sometimes, especially with the Half-moon and crow pose. This frustration was coming from my own expectations of myself: I am quite a perfectionist, so when I am not good at something from the get-go, it pains me deeply. The practice helped me to understand that it is not about the results, but the journey which leads us to them. So, today, after being able to direct my own flow on the 30th day of the challenge, I dropped those expectations. I came to this video to flex my hamstrings for my splits practice and, quite unexpectedly, I reached my big toe and straightened my leg in the lying pose. I am not gonna lie, the sensation which filled me was pure amazement. I had to stop the video for a few seconds and just looked at my body in awe. I was able to overcome one of the boundaries I put onto myself, the boundary of expectations which are probably unreachable for me at this point and my body showed me that it is not worthless, it is able to perform some astonishing deeds already. Thank you for allowing me to re-discover myself, Adriene. Namaste.",Nora J√∫lia Levick√°,2020-05-21T13:30:42Z,0

"i am slowly returning to my yoga practices since being laid up for some time from being sick with covid. In addition to being ill and fatigued and short of breath, my body is so stiff from Being bedridden and house bound and exhausted for the past month.    i stumbled across this one and tried it today and liked it. i usually only do the more restorative gentle lower back ones and i have some favorites i alternate with. this is a good one and will add it to my go to list . my back is particurlarly ginger at the moment so i did indeed adapt the  laying on your side ones at the end and had to stay on the ground and not lift up to the elbow.<br /> I am pleased to have some gentle practices and connectedness through yoga with Adrienne whilst recovering alone at home. . thank you!! from my little corner of the world in British Cloumbia, Canada",Jill Gathright,2020-05-06T19:30:40Z,0

"Can you please help me?<br />Hi,<br />Actually I just need to know where to start with my stretching exercises. My issues are:<br />1. scoliosis (since age 12) no real issues except some rhomboid muscle pain that&#39;s getting better.<br />2. Hyper lumbar lordosis. Kills when I sleep on my stomach.<br />@t joint pain, specifically on the left. Makes it hard to sleep and get out of bed,  that&#39;s stomach or back sleeping ( back is the worst).<br />4. Neck pain, mostly from driving but lately from sleeping to accommodate my back.<br />Hx: I had rt rotator cuff surgery 12/18, 100% recovered and joint pain started 2/19, progressively getting worse. Had trigger point therapy massage 8/19 on my thighs/ hips which made my pain worse. Pt was slightly helpful but had to d/c because I developed an ulcer due to heavy use of NSAIDs which I had to stop taking. Joined planet fitness but canceled the membership in lieu of the park district with a heated pool and yoga classes. I haven&#39;t started yet because of the Corona virus.<br />This morning I did 10 min on this cycle machine followed by lower body stretches and then the bands. I just don&#39;t know if 1 thing is making the other problems worse or if I&#39;m doing duplicate exercises with different things which will make it worse.<br /> Lastly,  I&#39;ve lost 47 lbs since late September with no exercise ( because of pain ) diet pills or crazy diets but no help",ericka moore,2020-03-27T23:18:42Z,0

"My first Yoga with Adrien! What I loved about this workout was how it made me sllllloooowwww doooowwwwwnnn and focus on each small movement and posture. I have a history of pushing myself too far, too fast and re-injuring my back and hip. It kept me away from exercising for way too long, but now I feel ready to start again and take it easy so iI do it RIGHT. Looking forward to getting strong and healthy again with your videos.

I guess we are all built differently but I can‚Äôt help but wonder if I‚Äôm doing it wrong.. I gave both sides a good go but had to pull out and go to seated forward fold, my secret love cave üòâ, which was a lovely way to compensate.

I think it will be really useful for many of us to have this kind of advice available for when you don&#39;t really know what to do but when you want some positive changes in your life. I would kill for that, seriously. <br /><br />By the way, I found your channel only 3 days ago and I&#39;ve been practicing for hours. It&#39;s really really helping me with my problems that I&#39;ve been struggling with all my life.

"I did yoga for gratitude before this video, which helped me to tune in and made me realize how grateful I am for this community and to be exposed to some new poses. This yoga session left me feeling good. The coming week will be a bit hectic, so I am planning to dedicate more time for yoga and thus take care of myself. It brings out the best in me, and sometimes gently nudges me to look at the scary things as well. Yoga has transformed me and my way of living. Along with Buddhist teaching, I feel prepared to help and support others, and to spread my love. ‚ù§Ô∏è thank you so much for being an amazing mentor!

"Hi Rosa! We have a Prenatal Yoga For All Trimesters available in the¬†FWFG Membership - <a href=""https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/%C2%A0as"">https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/¬†as</a> well as in¬†our shop - <a href=""https://do.yogawithadriene.com/prenatal-yoga"">https://do.yogawithadriene.com/prenatal-yoga</a><br />In general, most women are able to continue a regular practice through¬†month eight if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold.¬†<br />As always, consult your doctor/physician before starting and follow their advice.¬†<br />xx",Yoga With Adriene,2019-10-06T07:49:30Z,1

I&#39;ve been diagnosed with chronic tightness of all parts of the body as a result of my cerebral palsy but my back and hamstrings are usually the tightest areas I try to stretch out every morning.

We all pretty much feel and understand each other without saying a word through our practice together.
