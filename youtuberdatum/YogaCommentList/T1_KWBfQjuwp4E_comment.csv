"Hi! I just finished the 2021 Breath Yoga Journey. I have created a great habit of yoga journeying (is that a verb?) in the evening after I have read for my kids, so now they fall asleep to the sight of me doing yoga(-ish) poses and to the sound of Adrienes voice. They don&#39;t understand the words (as we&#39;re danish) but we all find a great calm and comfort in the ritual. I&#39;m greatful to discover that there are so many more videoes. I&#39;m in for the next 30 days - keep &#39;em coming. Lots of love &lt;3",Anne Andersson Boysen,2021-03-22T19:46:34Z,2

"This year, as a celebration of my 10th year on yoga mat I decided to do Yoga with Adriene 30 days challenge. I did Breathe on January. On February I though, that somehow I want to do one of those previous (Dedicate), and today evening will begin another journey with this Home. <br />Even I&#39;m practising on my own for last 8 years, somehow, now, in this awful pandemic times I discovered, how much it helps to hop on the mat everyday with Adriene and Benji. Thank you Adi and Benji for doing this, and I hope, that we all on ours mats feel lifted and less lonely. <br />Much love, <br />Aga from Poland.",Aga Kozłowska,2021-03-01T13:24:55Z,2

Now I do feel moved, but for a different reason - it&#39;s like a strange prediction of the next year&#39;s reality.<br />It&#39;s simply a bit uncanny to see that coincidence. <br /><br />I still enjoy the way Adriene is making those videos, I hope she never stops.<br />Adriene, now you are a clairvoyant as well as a yoga teacher ; )",Сергеи Чернов,2020-11-08T19:44:26Z,0

"I just finished your 30 days, the  series from 5 years ago. Great introduction to Yoga, i really like your way of teaching and encouraging. I had some hiccups along the way and it took a little bit longer to get through those 30 sessions. Been doing Intermittent fasting and really struggling to lose weight, even paired with doing 30 minutes of physical activity nearly every day. But I do notice my strength.... my arms still look flabby as hell when i wave to people from across the room, BUT i locked myself out of the house yesterday and decided my best course of action would be to lift myself up through my bathroom window that sits at chest height from the ground. This was a difficult task and i said to myself &quot;SELF... YOU CAN DO THIS... a month of yoga better count for something Self! LIFFFFTTT&quot;. A few minor injuries later i was through the window and not sure how i did it. Then i locked all the windows, cause that&#39;s just asking for trouble. xD. <br />Now i ask myself, what next? I&#39;m untrained and not ready for making my own way with yoga. I am struggling a little with some of the activities because i have Degenerative Disc Disease, my PT tells me no Bending, Lifting, Twisting,    Pushing, Pulling... every time i do some kind of   twist my spine is like bubble wrap. I&#39;m trying to work through these limitations slowly. I dont know what to do next, so Here i am, about to start your most recent 30 days of Yoga? Any recommendations would be appreciated.",H C,2020-08-28T15:32:52Z,1

"This is my second 30 day Challenge with Adriene.  It was great but just as was done on day 30 of my last challenge, it was done in silence with no cues.  I have been doing yoga for over 40 years and although I know all the poses I have a hard time trying to see what you are doing.  It kills my neck trying to see where we go next. Although the concept is great, it is difficult to try to watch you for all poses.  I would have enjoyed it more with the cues. <br />Having said that, I have enjoyed my two Challenges and will continue to follow you!  Thank you so much!",Jeanne Rupp,2020-08-26T21:17:38Z,0

Sometime later I was diagnosed with some medical problem and am ashamed to say haven&#39;t found my way back to yoga until now. I have been feeling down on myself lately and remembered how yoga helped me find my center and feel better about me as well as brighten my outlook on everyday life.

"no one will probably see this but I’m really putting this out there to keep myself accountable. lately my mental health has been crazy bad. I can go throughout my day fine but at night I just seem to always fall apart and I don’t know why. Social media has taken such a toll on how I feel about myself and I guess without realizing it I let my mental health take a major backseat and now I’m paying the price. In an attempt to fix that I’m going to take things back to the basics and just try to commit for at least 30 days to doing this challenge, meditate for at least 10 minutes, and find what really makes me happy. Usually I always either get suckered in to big workout challenges and burn out really fast or I just go for long periods of hating the way I look or how my clothes fit and eating to make me feel better. I just want to feel good and I think with yoga I can do that and not worry about how big my stomach is or how bloated I feel. Fingers crossed I guess.",nonchalantbxby,2020-08-25T17:34:37Z,42

No matter how stressed, sad , or not so good I feel before practicing, as soon as I get on my mat with Adrienne, I get filled up with joy and love, I remember, accept and value who I am.

"Starting today. I tried multiple times doing something but I was not able to continue with my practice. Because of people around me who makes fun of me whenever I start doing yoga. One person who was fat and now fit, always demotivates me by saying that its for you. If you try hard and even put your all energy to it even then you&#39;ll not be able to do yoga. Its not your cup of tea.<br /> These comments always ruine me. I felt so bad and even I am trying but these word from someone who is very close to me are pulling me down. I am not vocal on this. But,  this is the first time I am opening on this phase of my life. <br />This program is suggested to me by someone on instagram and I am thankful to the person for sending me here.

"Dear Adriene, I cam across your HOME clips by happy accident.  It has become my daily &#39;thing&#39; during this virus situation.  I am not overweight and quite slip but find I cannot get &#39;lift up&#39; in the crow pose and wondered if you had any guidance for that?  I felt very angry with myself for not being able to lift myself, my body seemed to feel like a sack of potatoes or something.  I had always done yoga but stopped for a while and I am older now, in my &#39;middle&#39; years.  I notice my right side is generally more tight and seized up than the left but thankfully I am in excellent health and in no physical pain.  I know yoga is not a competition but if you had any insights into why my body appears to completely resist that pose I would be very grateful.  Thank you for all you have done in preparing and presenting each clip.  I especailly thank you for the kind words of love and your gentle humour during this time.

"this is gonna be my second 30d yoga challenge. Thank you adriene for being here for me. Yes, i started due to quarantine but i stayed because i found something beautifull. i always wanted to pick up yoga, but in the gym everyone was so damn perfect and i felt intimidated. That&#39;s why i pushed myself way too hard and i got too shore each time. so the next time would take a couple days, and everyone would be even more flexible and strong and so on and so forth and the circle never ends... So thank you once again. still i haven&#39;t got great control over my emotions (or my body duh!) but it&#39;s the start for something great!",Faye M,2020-05-16T09:32:23Z,0

"Hey Adriene!! So let me tell you what your yoga videos and your positive vibes means to me: I have been suffering with depression from a long time and even 2020 began with the same negativity- There was no hope left in me, I never smiled from the bottom of my heart, there was always something like a black hole inside me which kept on emptying me, I am overweight for my age which added up to the negativity and I hated myself for probably everything including my body. I was just drifting away in life without realizing my purpose and I even had suicidal thoughts. Then One day, one of my well wishers suggested me to follow your yoga videos while I was having a panic attack. Honestly, At first I thought that she was stupid to tell me to do yoga when I didn&#39;t have enough energy to even get out of bed in the morning. She asked me to take up the 30 days challenge. For her, I thought of starting to do yoga, but I followed your weight loss videos and not the 30 days challenge. And my good lord, The very first day everyone around me (including me) sensed a different kind of energy in me which had been vanished for years now. I lost weight fast which made me happier. I have been my happiest self in ages, all just because of you. And today, I decided to take up the 30 day challenge and i found myself searching for weight loss stories in comments and then I realized how much I have been hating myself just for who I am, And now I have decided to do yoga not just for getting me in shape but also for  &quot;finding what feels good in me.&quot; I am doing it for myself. I owe it all to you Adriene!! Thanks for making everyone feel good about themselves. (I have been waiting for your mail since ages, hope I receive one soon.)",Tina Sheoran,2020-05-12T02:29:49Z,0

Hi Adrienne<br />You are a lifesaver ...<br /><br />I am a single guy in lockdown in the UK<br />I started furlough a month ago and was determined to stay mentally fit even though the loneliness is tough so I thought I need something to keep me fit both mentally and physically and discovered your other 30 days of yoga program<br /><br />I made myself do it every day even though sometimes I didn’t feel like it and made it to 30 days .<br /> I loved your approach to it and the way you encouraged us<br />I have now moved on to the home course and found that my arms are really weak ( they always have been very thin ) and am struggling to even do the pushups section <br />Thank you for keeping me sane under these difficult circumstances <br />Clive x,Clive Dancey,2020-05-11T09:49:58Z,0

Started this series on Monday with two other friends, we&#39;re checking in with each other (remotely) each day to make sure we&#39;ve done our daily yoga. Just wanted to say how much I appreciate your thoughtful videos, Adriene! Your care and attention to &quot;finding what feels good&quot; is what makes me come back again and again. :)",Savannah A,2020-04-01T15:26:56Z,12
I want to take this opportunity to thank you Adriene for helping me to learn more about me in these 30 days of Yoga. I also want to thank you for being so natural and patient. I want you to know that every day was designed for me and my stay of mind. Words that you said for some helped me to face my day with positive energy. Because that is what you are Adriene + Energy.

Along with re-establishing my daily yoga I’ll be working on things that I wished that I had time to work on if I didn’t have that old day job. 1. Yoga. Yay. 2. Finishing a story and submitting to an editor that’s been encouraging my work for years. 3. Gardening. 4. Crafting. 5. Becoming more fluent with my family’s language: Spanish. Who knows where all of these things could lead. But I’m grateful for the time to slow down.<br /><br />Thank you, Adrien for being an encouraging and steadfast companion. This is a period of time I may never see again. I’m glad to have your channel to add to my quarantine repertoire. 😻",Teresa,2020-03-24T03:45:26Z,0

Yesterday sucked for me. I actually said to the man who at that moment was becoming my ex that I just want to find my HOME. I&#39;m a gypsy soul type and just want a place for my heart to call home -- comfort, love, work, support, joy, all the things &quot;home&quot; encompasses. Wanting to take good care of ME now, today I went back to the emails I&#39;d passed up in January to start yoga again and saw that this series is called Home.

"Hi Adriene and everyone. I&#39;ve been having a hard time in Shanghai, China (COVID-19 has shut down everything). My Yoga centre will be closed until...nobody knows. I&#39;ve been going there for 4 years nearly every day. The impact has been really devastating on a lot of our well-beings. I&#39;ve never wanted to do home Yoga. I like the energy of the class and the community of people.  I&#39;m distracted at home. There is always a dish to wash or a towel to fold...something to wipe down. Today I decided I must return to the mat for my mental well-being.  I went deep into my closet and found my travel mat. I am so excited to start the 30 days of welcome home, and in 30 days my dogs will have their paperwork so we can return home to the USA. This is a figurative and literal journey for me.

"Thank you Adriene.  I did your 30 day Yoga journey last year, it was great.  I was able to begin a pretty regular Yoga program for myself thereafter....  The past few months I have been dealing with other things.  For instance: I did dry January which became dry February, I started intermittent fasting and have lost 10 pounds.  But sadly, my Yoga practice has fallen off.  Maybe too many changes at once!  But I am committing to your 2020 journey.  It is just what I need right now to help nurture/cultivate the other positive changes I am making in my life. <br />As others have said, 2019 was a rough year.  2020 hasn&#39;t been much better from a world perspective.

"I want to feel like a person again. For the past few years I have felt like a thing that goes to work and pays bills. Why am I doing this now?  In one of my severe allergy attacks I pulled a muscle when I was sneezing. It hurt but thought it would go away. The pain got worse everyday. I just couldn&#39;t breathe anymore. With very shallow breathes I went to the ER. After 5 hours the doctor asked me if I knew I had scoliosis. My answer was.. .WHAT?  She started to explain what it was. Me being me I said..  I know what scoliosis is. I have had X-rays before and not a single doctor said anything. She answered..  yeah... Sorry about that, but you still have it. That moment put everything in check. After asking the Google gods I ended up here with Adriene. She made me breath better and now I&#39;m ready for the challenge. Thank you Adriene.",Eve Wood,2020-01-27T15:29:57Z,0

I love my flat, but it is not easy to relax and enjoy this new beginning; I keep expecting the next disaster to happen (I keep checking the ceiling for leaks!).

"Hi dear Adriene and all those beautiful souls around the globe! <br />I&#39;ve always felt about these 30 day new year yoga videos, that Adriene could read my thoughts and always chose the right theme for me. This year Adriene didn&#39;t surprise me either and announced it as &quot;home&quot;. Because I took 9 days off from work  <del>this week</del> to take care of myself and my home long before this announcement -in December. <br />And there it was... the right yoga to follow. 😎<br />I have moved in to my own space a while ago and I still have so much work to do.  So during this home organising project this yoga journey will have my back. I know that! Thank you Adriene. 🍀❤ <br />I love being in this community.  <br />Greetings from Turkey.",Sevgi Ekicigil,2020-01-05T06:45:14Z,0

Im starting this practice a little late only did day 0&amp;1 today after doing my usual &quot;wake up yoga&quot; with you hehe but tom i intend to do day 2&amp;3 so the next day ill catch up by doing 4&amp;the current days. I wasnt going to do the whole 30 day challenge just because i didnt start at the right time but as i saw the names of the videos i thought id like to recognize things about myself awaken etc, and in that moment i remembered things come in their time for you so lets do the dang challenge! Well catch up! Work for it a little right anything worth while ya gotta work for and this is just for myself to remember you got this! Anyone else in the same boat YOU GOT THIS! You want something go and get it, fight and work hard for it! I believe in you and so does Adriene and Benji<br /><br />But yeah i closed my eyes cutting that lemon calm as ever. I trust you cant wait for the journey fr fr though theres something about your voice that really projects your life force energy and it&#39;s so comforting and reassuring so thank you for never stopping your channel I hope you never do at least.

"So I guess I&#39;m a day late, I didn&#39;t know about this until a few minutes ago, sipping my coffee before the kids get up. In 2019 my family of five (one still in diapers) moved from the west coast to the east. It&#39;s &quot;back home&quot; for my husband and me but for our kids it&#39;s all new, especially for my oldest who had to face second grade in a completely unfamiliar school. We bought our new house in August and I love it but we&#39;re still working on making it &quot;home&quot; and probably still will be for a while. We just took down our first Christmas tree from this house and I am looking forward to a new year of breathing life and love into these spaces.

"Dear Adrienne,<br /><br />I’ve now been practicing with you for about four years. That spans living in two different countries, three different “homes”, and such a vast spectrum and mental states. This year was bad for me. Bad for my sense of identity and self esteem. Bad for my sense of hope and trust in others. I had the worst job experience of my life that made me question my place in the world. This series being named Home couldn’t be more accurate. The only moments I have really felt home this year were when I could squeeze out a few minutes to hop on the mat with you. Those moments were too few, though, and my mind and body feel weary. Hoping this reset to home will help me find myself again buried under all the doubt, stress, fear, and struggle. I can’t thank you enough for what you mean to me and so many others. May your light shine on forever. <br />Love,<br />Alicia",Alicia Albertson,2020-01-02T17:08:24Z,0

And I&#39;m going to push myself to make every day happen, even with the long travel and jet lag (14hr flight.) I need that accountability, something for me to wind down PROPERLY after a day instead of winding down and doing puzzles on my laptop until 1am. Lol.

"I am forever grateful to my stepmom for opening my heart to this channel. Up until this point, the thought of committing to myself seemed like something I was incapable of doing. The past year has been beautiful, terrifying and totally heartbreaking. There were moments in which I showed myself a bit of love but to be honest, the majority of my loving and effort went into my job and an abusive relationship. Building up the strength to leave was hard but I started to believe for the first time in two years that I was worth it. It has been two months since I left and I am still healing and forgiving. The waves of this past year were intense, I am looking forward to the stillness. I am ready to commit fully to myself to my growth and feminine flow. I am here to support myself and others.

My anxiety and panic attacks and endometriosis has seemed to kick into high gear and I didn&#39;t hear from or was rejected by every job I applied for. I did yoga off and on, tried to do it every day for a month and always failed. I decided that in 2020, I would do the January challenge and start to eat a more flexitarian diet.

"Along with many others here, 2019 was a tough year for me. I struggled with fibromyalgia, a terrible job, mild depression, financial worries, hopelessness about the future and my purpose, uncertainty about which sort of work I want to do, deep fears that I&#39;ll never achieve the things I long for... to be honest, it feels like I&#39;m nowhere near to getting the answers I need and I have no idea what to do let alone where to start but the one thing I know is that I long to feel like I&#39;m home, within myself and in the world. I long for comfort and confidence and cosyness... I&#39;m looking forward to this yoga journey as I&#39;m sure it will be of great support to me (and many others).",joy,2020-01-02T03:54:07Z,1

"I felt like 2019 tore the scabs off a lot of wounds, traumas that I had blocked out started to feel fresh and raw. The latter half I scrambled for healing, not only for myself, but for my children. I saw some cycles starting, subtly, in my parenting journey as I learned that not only did I inherit trauma, but that there was a likelihood that I could pass it on. I&#39;m dedicating my yoga practice to healing this year- in the past I would have looked at it as the type of discipline that is seen as punishment, and so my mat wasn&#39;t associated with safety. Luckily I received a new mat for Christmas, a new beginning, a chance to set new intentions, a new home. Thank you for offering to lead us on this journey. Namaste.",Samantha Patterson,2020-01-01T23:20:49Z,18

It became a year of huge personal and professional growth, and I know it was possible because I truly learned the necessity of slowing down and showing up for myself, taking a break, trusting, and letting go. Once you know how to take care of yourself, and you practice that care on the regular, you can radiate that energy.....and then boom!

"As an airline pilot, I spend a lot of time away from home. I first discovered your channel by accident while looking for some yoga videos and was immediately sucked in by your humor and lighthearted approach to yoga. (and Benji ;) ) I started with Dedicate last March and was initially grumbly about the mantras and the meditation and wanted a more physical, &quot;fitnessey&quot; sort of practice. I stuck with it through Dedicate, True, and some of your other videos and am proud to say that I&#39;m now 100% on board. &quot;Home&quot; resonates so much for me because no matter what city I&#39;m in, I look forward to doing your practices every day as a little bit of grounding and &quot;home&quot; from a chaotic lifestyle. Thank you for that.",Tina,2020-01-01T22:10:45Z,0
late last year I finally got my life back in many ways health wise and others and finding you and yoga was a huge part of it...I am so grateful and want to say thank you I feel very blessed!

I&#39;d always been relatively healthy until my hearing started to go and my balance went off. Despite it being one of my goals for last year, as a consequence, very little yoga got done. Thankfully I&#39;m much better now. I&#39;ve decided to just go with the flow this year but looking forward to joining everyone for this journey xx",Lizzy N-J,2020-01-01T21:20:15Z,0

I have not done yoga before but 2019 was a very intense year and I&#39;m so proud of myself for have done yoga almost every single day with Adriene for the last 9 months.  And more to come!

"Ha, I started my yoga practice again in November, with the 30 days of yoga. Challenge.  I am still working through that 30 days of yoga.  I have 6 more videos to go.  <br />I was so nervous to get back into it, as I had injured my shoulder a while back.    This time I would be extra mindful with my shoulder and the whole of my body.  <br />Also during this time, I minimized everything, and made no commitments to anything other than yoga, work, home, family.  I wanted to see what needs to be added back to life, and what can stay gone.  <br />During my yoga sessions, I built up more strength than I imagined in just 15 yoga sessions.  I was able to think more clearly, and.. My body told me that I needed to come back home, that I was capable of sustaining our family in a more healthful way if I was home.  <br />And then I see the Home 30 days of yoga starting.  Of course.  Of course.  <br />It&#39;s my goal to come back home in February.  <br />I&#39;m so looking forward to this!",Sarah Torgerson,2020-01-01T19:36:17Z,0

This year has been one that has shook me to the core...I lost my dad suddenly at the end of May (he was my best friend), my wife left me two months later, then my birth mother (I am adopted) died on Dec 4th. I am being forced to live a very different path then I thought I would be at this stage in my life. I used to do yoga regularly, and over the years I abandoned my practice for many various reasons. This year needs to be the year I really truly take the time to heal and put myself first..I am a nurse so my schedule is a little all over the map, but I am going to do my best to show up every day for myself. &lt;3 excited to be a part of this family.",sessualiify,2020-01-01T19:05:38Z,0

"I’m super excited to go on this journey with you and with myself! I have been off the mat for several months because of life issues and an injury to my knee (which didn’t help). I’m hoping it’s healed up enough to get going again. I’ll be practicing at home in a new spot I’ve created especially for this “home” series. Thank you Adriene for such dedication to this amazing community you created. We’re here for the practice, but you are an intricate part of why we keep coming back!

"SO Excited! This theme of “Home” couldn’t have been any more appropriate for me. I arrived back to my “physical” home in the USA yesterday after a year+ of international travel (YWA went all over the world with me, (Mexico, China, South Korea, India, The Philippines, Thailand...) and kept me feeling connected and grounded in many new environments, and on many many rough days. I am so THANKFUL for this community, and the encouragement, positivity, and reflection that it facilitates!! 2020 HERE WE COME!

"In 2019, i continuously started and stopped my yoga journey because I always thought I was too busy to be able to fit it in anywhere but now that I look back, there was so much time I had where I could fit in maybe a 30 minute session. Now I’m not beating myself up over it because this year, starting today, I’m going to make it habit to wake up and do some yoga to start my day with a peaceful mindset. And I’m so beyond grateful that you, Adriene, are going to be the one leading me through it! <br />Also, not gonna lie, I cried a little bit watching this video because I do need healing within myself and it was nice to hear I’m not alone here (something I need to remember more often). So thank you for creating such an inviting and warm place to be. I look forward to spending this year with you and everyone else here!",neonbean,2020-01-01T17:49:17Z,1

"Last year I was sitting on my floor watching Dedicate&#39;s orientation video with a bit of hesitation that could I even do this but with more determination to &quot;show up for myself&quot; everyday for 30 days.  I was focused on doing something just for me and my health ( self care). I figured if nothing else I&#39;d get a good stretch everyday. <br />Today as I watched Home&#39;s orientation video I had tears of joy streaming down my face. You see in 2019 not only did I complete Dedicate but also every calendar for the whole year. I not only surpassed my original goal but surprised myself with finishing out the year. Life has been so hard for quite some time now and for the first time in a very long time I can&#39;t wait to start a new year. I know that this community Adriene, Benji and all of you have helped me heal and find joy again. thank y&#39;all from the bottom of my heart. SEE Y&#39;ALL ON THE MAT!

In late 2019 I worked through your 30 Days and was completely blown away by the breathing relaxation calming and physical effects. My flexibility and strength have increased my inflammation has dramatically decreased and I feel like a different person.

"I&#39;m 61 and started following the YWA 30 day programs last summer as a way of keeping me on track with practicing yoga daily. I started last year with a serious fall and a badly strained hip. Once I&#39;d finished physical therapy, yoga was the obvious next step. I had other resources, but when I found YWA, I stayed. Can I do all the balance poses? Between the hip and some other health issues that affect balance, not well. But the welcome and reassurance that is always present in these videos is wonderful. The invitation to breathe and be present has provided the space for some needed and welcome self discovery. I am so looking forward to participating live with all of you.

This stopped me in my tracks and I became very unsure of myself. But I’m here again today and am determined to do what I can, with what I have. I feel so much more in tune with who I am again, just in showing up. I will have to modify some of the moves, which I will find difficult as I will not be able to do some of the most enjoyable moves for me but at least I am here. I feel blessed.

"I can’t wait to start this journey! Dedicate last year helped me so much, and yoga became part of my life. However since August I haven’t been able to practice cause I was living away from home....I’m now back home in rural Canada, I think for good. And what perfect timing for this Home practice 💕 I am home, and am looking forward to becoming at home with myself too. <br />This year has brought amazing things to me, but also the lowest point that i think I’ve ever been. But I’m out the other side of that and ready to start this new year with yoga every day!! 😄<br />Thank you Adriene for doing this for all of us. Can’t wait 💕",robynloveschocolate,2020-01-01T14:45:10Z,0

"Happy New Year from Western Australia.  I travel around Australia in my caravan for the past 10 years.  Currently in Karratha (north west of Western Australia) and I will be doing it outside either before or after work.  Average morning/ evening temperatures 35°C (95°F) so I will be sweating doing the yoga., but I used to it now . Trying to lose excess weight that I gained in the past 3 months, so hopefully I can do this everyday.",Lee-Ann Stevenson,2020-01-01T14:33:19Z,0

I want to thank you with all my heart &amp; soul &amp; every ounce of my being for being such an extraordinary teacher. 2019 was a long, important &amp; trying year for me &amp; I could really go through it all, patiently , largely bcos of your yoga for EVERY OCCASION ever esp when it felt like my body was giving up on me, I have solely banked on your videos to help my get back in sync with it. Your constant insistence on being graceful &amp; grateful has changed me immensely as a person &amp; on my journey of personal growth, your guidance has been such a loyal pal. Thank you, once again, in every language ever &amp; I wanna say that out of many things in the world I am genuinely thankful for, your selfless-chill-easy-peasy yet effective yoga is def one of them.

"2019 was the hardest year in my life.  I found out my marriage of 31 years was ending.  I started depression medicine that  I had terrible (suicidal thoughts) side effects.   I lost my home and lived at friends house and out of my car for months.  I lost my very best friend due to mental illness.  Yoga, meditation, therapy, and most important God’s very personal love is why I am here today.  I moved into a home 3 weeks ago.  God and my church have loved me through all of this and Anriene’s sweet encouragement has help me get up and take the next step forward and find hope in each day.  I hated and never exercised in my 49 years of life.  Now it is part of my must!!  Even if it was outside watching on my phone.  Thanks Adriene and everyone else that has been on this journey with me.  Looking forward to 2020.  Happy New Year!",Reigh Anne Seifert,2020-01-01T14:05:00Z,689

"It&#39;s hard to believe - this is the fourth 30 Days of Yoga I have done with Adriene when it was broadcast (old fashioned word there I guess).  I didn&#39;t do yoga at all until my daughter recommended Adriene; she was doing Yoga Camp with a friend.  It was almost a dare.  So I tried Adriene&#39;s Yoga for Complete Beginners  and lo and behold:  I CAN do yoga and I love it.  <br />However, I have sort of abandoned the mat for several months now.  I am so grateful HOME has rolled around and I feel the motivation to get back into the routine.  <br />For those of you new to the 30 day programs - welcome and you&#39;re in for a treat I can tell you.<br />For those of us who have done Dedicate and True and etc, YAY - here we are again.  I do have to find a way to join the comment section after practice without pretzeling in front of my laptop for an hour or more.  This ringing a bell with anyone?<br />Happy New Year everyone!!",Linda Hart,2020-01-01T13:17:13Z,0

"My friend Gina and I are hoping that if we both commit to 30 days of yoga practice we can keep each other excited, motivated, and accountable. But best laid plans and all. Thank you for setting this up Adriene. I&#39;ve been feeling a little too pushed lately, instead of coming to the mat ready to listen to what my body needs, I keep forcing myself to do harsh workouts and it&#39;s not working for me. I think I need a little reconnect, so this home practice sounds just right.",Amelia Curd,2020-01-01T12:56:21Z,0

I see this 30 days as a phoenix opportunity to live to my truest potential as I remember who I was before I became someone else&#39;s savior. I&#39;ve felt caged from the moment I left school after earning a degree that fit the truest me and feeling like I was locked into others perceptions of how the world should be. <br /><br />I&#39;ll move forward by staying present, return the breathe and to the life of health that I once lived while continuing to seek balance because that&#39;s the way of nature. <br /><br />Nameste .",eric wade,2020-01-01T12:55:09Z,0

As I look forward to kick starting this new year with you and embarking on a new journey with myself, I think by now it’s clear to say I’m here to stay! <br />I haven’t followed a 30 Days of Yoga yet so this will be my first and I’m just desperate to start! I’m a total beginner but I love doing yoga nevertheless. In the last few months the stiffness I experience in my upper body has significantly eased and I feel like my flexibility is on the come back!<br />I wouldn’t want to do yoga with anyone other than yourself, Adriene. You have a warm soul, a soft and comforting tone and I feel so welcome and at peace when I’m here. <br />I have saved all of your previous 30 Days of Yoga into playlists for different months of this year and in between I shall just do whichever practices call me. <br />Thank you ever so much for opening my eyes to a whole new world.<br />I can’t wait to find what feels good this year!<br />Namaste ❤️",Nelly Doyley,2020-01-01T12:24:10Z,1

May all your wishes come true!<br />I rarely comment, but I do want to mention here, how much I value Yoga With Adriene, and how grateful I am for these awesome videos! They&#39;ve helped me a lot. I&#39;m struggling with several health issues and even had surgery just now in December. Sometimes, I can&#39;t practice any yoga for weeks. But I keep coming back to it, because it not only feels so great for the body, but - most important to me - also has such a grounding effect mentally. <br />It&#39;s like a little therapy session every time, and for that I am thankful!

"Last two months I was dragging my body along. I didn&#39;t have any energy and nothing was helping me. But... Two days ago while practicing yoga there was this mantra that showed up from nowhere &quot;I am awake&quot; and in that moment it ment so much to me.... It&#39;s not only that my eyes are open. It means I am open to new things, I am here and ready to be at home and get strong and bold... It took me two months of yoga practice so yoga could kick in again as it always does... And I wanted to thank you! Because I don&#39;t think I&#39;d do it without last two calendars and this hope that comes with new 30day practice! I am incredibly excited, awake and ready!

"Adriene my dear ( as yet un-met) friend! You are such a light! Due to my darling daughter&#39;s influence I have been practicing with you, doing your public monthly yoga programs since early summer 2019. I might have missed one day in July and one in September  but I know I definitely made it every day in October and November and I shifted one day to two yogas in one day and missed one day only in December, due to an unavoidable reason––I try to give myself no out for excuses, because I slide easily. This, YOU  have changed everything for me. I am more &quot;dancy&quot; and spritely than I have been in 20 years! I won&#39;t give this up. I am committed. It&#39;s because you are such an inspiration, such a good teacher, you are so mindful of a positive approach to the body, you are demanding–– but in the best way, you are a leader I can follow and I am not usually a follower. I admire you and your methods to the skies! Namaste and hugs, and love 💞 ❤️ HAPPY NEW YEAR 🎄💖🤍☆",Nan Elizabeth Jorgensen,2020-01-01T09:00:00Z,0

"I just want to say that I hope 2020 will be a better year and I wish you all luck with whatever comes your way! You got this! But 2019 for me has been an absolute year from hell. On our way to Disney world we found out that my grandfather passed away and I can’t describe how close I was to him and how much it hurts me that he’s gone, he’s the last grandparent that I had. We found out that my brother had a lesion in his ankle and that it could have been cancerous(I literally cried till there was nothing left in me), both my parents received the news that they had diabetes and that if they didn’t change their lifestyle they could’ve died. My best friend who is the only person who I was comfortable being vulnerable around moved away and we barely talk anymore. 2019 is also the year that my mental health has been at its worst, my anxiety has skyrocketed, I started having suicidal thoughts(I promise I haven’t hurt myself or have even tried taking action, they’re only thoughts), and one of my biggest flaws: anger. I get angry so easily and I try to stop myself but it’s too much. All I’m saying is I’m ready to let go and head home. I’m ready to embark on my journey back home and to find happiness again. ❤️ <br /><br />I’m really sorry that this is so long but I needed to get this off my chest",Anjali Pattani,2020-01-01T08:59:40Z,1

"Hi Adriene I’ve been a fan for a couple years now and always associate your channel with such peace, calm, and positive energy. Maybe it’s a coincidence but I’m so glad this year’s theme is Home. I’ve been thinking a lot about the concept of home recently after moving around a lot and feeling like I no longer have a home base. I just started in a new city for school and don’t know where I’ll go after and how long I’ll be here. Being “home” for the holidays is also weird because my parents moved out of the place we used to live and I’ve not lived with them for 5 years now. <br /><br />I’ve been feeling like an untethered balloon floating through life because there’s no place or person that I’m attached to enough to draw me somewhere. I don’t know where I want to live or what I want to do. I don’t know how long my life will continue like this, so I’m hoping to find a home within myself in this new year. I want to feel grounded and whole on my own, so that wherever I go, I can find peace. Looking forward to this 30 day journey, and thanks for everything you do Adriene!!",Teresa Wang,2020-01-01T08:55:47Z,0

"Yes! I’m in ♥️🎊🥳 I’m excited and grateful. I need this more than you know. I recently made a huge move and haven’t felt a sense of home here. I caught the flu (first time ever) and the longing for home when you’re sick is normal probably, but to ache to be home when you are home is a terrible feeling. Today is day 8 of this awful flu and I’m not much better, but I’ll be present and working through it. This is for me. ♥️",Kelli Akers,2020-01-01T06:02:58Z,15
