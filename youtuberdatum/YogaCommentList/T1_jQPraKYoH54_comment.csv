About half way through I got my left and right mixed up. It was a little yoga for the brain to have to do it all backwards from what you were saying. I may do it more often just for the challenge. Namaste,Steven Smith,2021-05-04T15:31:49Z,0

"Thank you so much Adriene! Doing these practices with you has improved my being so much!

I was quite anxious during the whole day for more reasons. But after just few minutes on the mat I just felt like part of the weight which is pushing me down today was lifted. Thank you Adruene for leading me on this journey. Hope to practice with you one day on your yoga camp. Its truly  my dream. Namaste &lt;3,Ester Kaňovská,2021-03-29T20:27:05Z,0
Uplift....Let&#39;s get started.,Archangel Revelations,2021-03-20T16:59:11Z,1
"Be aware at 6 minutes in Adriene asks you to lift your left leg into 3 legged dog, but she actually lifts her right leg! Lifting your left leg at this point makes no sense of her verbal instructions as you go forward with the poses :-) I tried and failed twice to follow her before looking at the video and finding out I should have started with the right leg lifted :) Bless her x",Anne Kluczynski,2021-03-17T10:13:41Z,1
"Thank you Adriene ❤️ (why is it so hard to show up on my mat? I love yoga , I love yoga with Adriene videos  and doing  Yoga with you  and I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s hard to get to it every day, but it is)",Juliet Graham,2021-03-16T04:29:55Z,0

"Adriene you have ruined me for other instructors. I tried to do a stretching routine with hubby (he&#39;s just getting back to his fitness) and I had to look at the screen the whole time. I hardly ever have to look at you, I just put my earbuds in and don&#39;t actually open my eyes much at all! Your voice is so calming and I love having you so close to me even though you&#39;re across the world. You&#39;re an amazing teacher and such a blessing to our world ❤",Jen W,2021-03-03T18:03:34Z,0

"Adriene, I can&#39;t thank you enough for this. I was on the verge of a mental breakdown because with my ADHD, I have such a hard time starting ANY task, and it&#39;s been an issue for me lately. I knew if I did some yoga I might feel better so I picked this video randomly from the name. The fact that you opened with saying the hardest part is over really resonated with me. I also felt so strong the whole time knowing that a year ago, I had a much harder time with these poses. My head is much clearer now and I&#39;m not anxious anymore. You have changed my life with yoga &lt;3",Megan O'Neil,2020-06-23T17:39:50Z,1

I had to modify the end of this because I&#39;m about to go to bed and I knew it would uplift and wake me up too much! I felt bad and them remembered to find what feels good and what suits my body.

Before I would&#39;ve gotten upset about this and I would&#39;ve been down on myself, but this time I simply rewinded the video and I did better. The video felt fast-paced for me today, but that just reminded me of how much my mind tends to wander.

"mhmmm I liked this today!! I modified where needed and just kept with the flow. Had a lovely phone call before hand, and I feel like some light was creeping in. I loved when there was a moment when we went to cobra when Adriene said something like, open up your heart. The past couple days I&#39;ve felt a little in a funk in quarantine, and today i felt those feelings when it&#39;s like, you just need to believe, and be open to receiving. Sometimes it&#39;s the belief system we need to address. I don&#39;t know if that makes sense, but It just felt really good! Wish it had been longer hehe :)",musicsummer12,2020-04-23T16:35:33Z,0
"Yes Adriene has put all the other Yoga instructors to shame. She’s quirky, funny yet still emanates this professional tone that tells you she knows what she’s talking about!

"I think I might be holding too tightly to the everyday thing (maybe more ego driven than I want to admit?) and I think I might be injuring myself. I usually roll in my ankles and I&#39;ve been using practice to try to hold them straighter, and I thought they were muscle sore but now I think they are tendon sore (self foot massage helped me realize this). I&#39;m wondering about picking a few slow/gentle/floor/meditation videos to use when I need a rest day but still want to do yoga and maybe insert those practices in between the daily video when I need to be going at a slower pace and letting my feet rest? My state has a stay at home order so I am not walking much, which I thought would make it easier to focus on my feet but maybe not?",Loosh,2020-04-08T11:58:08Z,0

"It&#39;m my 23rd day of quarantine here in my small place in Paris, so I basically only lived the lockdown with you guys and its feels incredibly heartwarming to have my practice every day. It&#39;s now part of my morning routine, its my way to forget the news, forget the anxiety, feel good in my body for the day. When the weather is good, I open the window and it feels like I&#39;m practicing outside.

"Hi Adriene, I want you to know how much you&#39;ve done for me (and it is clear you&#39;ve done so much for so many people!). Your videos helped me get out of a pretty prolonged funk a few years ago. I had never done yoga before, and tried it just because some one else mentioned that they do YouTube yoga videos. Doing yoga regularly has really changed the chemistry of my brain, and helps me feel really good. I live in NYC and have been house-bound for almost two weeks now because of the virus. I continue to practice with you and it is helping me get through this uncertain time. I&#39;m sure you are well aware of the difference you make in people&#39;s lives, but I wanted to share my thoughts with you to say thank you. &lt;3 Elizabeth",Elizabeth Miller,2020-03-29T20:29:09Z,2

The nutrients from this practice are still seeping in... I did this video at 8 pm after a full day- already worked out today- and it brought me so much peace and I feel centered and energized but calm. I feel the magic of this sequence in my body and mind. I had done this video before in the morning once but doing it again tonight I was able to relax into it more. Thank you. Xx,Alyssa Furtado,2020-03-29T02:56:40Z,0

"Now finishing Day 24 - Home - Uplift 9:38 pm Sat Feb 15 2020.  Am noticing easier Downward Dogs.  Am appreciating the mudras you teach.  The directions you give on what to relax and how to breathe.  My planks are getting easier.  Am wondering what exactly is Chuttarunga?  How to place my feet?  Tough to watch you and practice at the same time!  Your gentle and loving, competent instructions are most appreciated, Adrienne!",GoddessLinda1,2020-02-16T05:40:57Z,0

"I love this one! I will go back to this video on days when I don&#39;t have much time or those days when I really kind of don&#39;t feel like doing yoga and don&#39;t feel like going on the mat, but I know I can do 16 minutes at least. On those days I sometimes end up doing more than that anyways, cause yoga feels so gooood! Thank you, Adriene &lt;3",Twin Dolphin Playing in Aquarian Moonlight,2020-02-13T06:52:53Z,0

"I&#39;m a day late to this one, but it was perfect for today. I work three 12 hour shifts in a row and I&#39;ve just finished my second one. Yoga is so hard to find time for when I also have to take care of my dog and the house that my boyfriend never tidies, so this short practice today was great to do today once I got home right before bed. Now I get to sleep for 6 hours, wake up, and do the next day&#39;s video. Thank you for these videos. I&#39;m so happy to be able to do them.",Mushrambo,2020-01-26T14:59:24Z,4

"I have shown up every day and the journey has been a true gift. With family visiting my showing up on the mat yesterday proved to be very powerful and so needed. No matter how wonderful family visits can be so many overtaking my space can cause a lot of anxiety. My husband&#39;s family are warm gregarious people, but know no limits or boundaries. It can all become overwhelming. I am also looking forward to Unwind today. It&#39;s 8am. Close to a dozen will ascend on my home within an hour and stay for another 12. I will unwind first and then be brave and suggest a hike in the woods a bit later. I know only 1 or 2 will accept. I will renew during that time. I will return better for it. Thank you again and again Adriene and Kula for providing me with tools for a more peaceful life. Namaste`",kristi shore,2020-01-26T14:11:28Z,0

I told myself I would do it, and I force myself to get on the mat even when I don&#39;t have much time or don&#39;t feel like it. It has become a part of my routine, and has really increased my self discipline! I&#39;ve noticed my self-discipline for my school work and my business improve. And I am getting stronger!!

"Hello friends! I am here with you on the journey of self-improvement. As the days go by and I slowly change my decisions and patterns into ones that better serve me, there are days like today where things come up. Usually, a day will go by where one or two thoughts will occur and I can let it easily flow, but it&#39;s another thing when everything happens all at the same time. Maybe that&#39;s life&#39;s way of testing us, to see if we&#39;ve truly changed our ways. It&#39;s so easy to drift back into the comfortable familiar. Definitely needed to uplift myself today and restore my energy, because even though I was able to save some of it by saying no to things that I would usually say yes to (which is, in retrospect a big win), I&#39;ve definitely spent time being overwhelmed and dwelling on things that, ultimately don&#39;t really matter. Happy practicing my friends 💪🙏💜",Jay-Ram Rajendra,2020-01-26T03:12:04Z,0
"my family and i said goodbye to our sweet, wonderful, 14 year-old dog today. it was an incredibly difficult day. getting on the mat every day isn’t always easy, but has come to represent a kind of consistency that i now find very comforting—especially when i opened youtube to see that today’s practice was called ‘uplift’. many thanks to you and your channel, and to sweet benji, for keeping me coming back to something positive each day instead of getting lost in the sorrow.",joints4points,2020-01-26T02:49:08Z,2

Have been doing your videos for a couple of months now and I’m absolutely loving it. <br />I do have trouble figuring out which videos are too hard for me for now. Would it be possible to start adding difficulty levels to the videos? I’ve done all the yoga for beginners ones and I want to branch out, I have found that some videos I can easily do and feel great but others are still too hard for me. It would be so much easier with a little indicator so that I don’t have to start a bunch of vids to get to one I can do..... <br />sorry if I sound ungrateful, I’m deeply grateful to u for all the hard work you’re put into this",Rose Tyler,2020-01-25T21:39:29Z,2

"Rose Tyler  if you pay attention to the modifications she offers, and yes, I mean when she’s describing something you aren’t yet able to do, you can “reverse engineer” the difficult moves in other videos. Also, it’s always okay to take a break (child’s pose, downward dog, supine twists) when something is not right for you. I am sure we’ve all collapsed onto our bellies from a challenging arm and core sequence, or backs from low boat! A live class with a good teacher may help with alignment which could be part of the difficulty. I am actually not a friend of studio workouts, and took forever after latching onto my first teacher before trying different studios and teachers, but if you’re lucky enough to find a smallish venue or a not so popular time, you can learn a lot from live classes!

Thank you again for this practice and also thank you for your energy, light and love.  I am a pretty healthy person however I had a scheduled MRI at 1am because of something found in a regular eye exam in October.  Long story short, it was not a super fun party so there was some visualizing during the hour long process.  I literally heard your voice saying &quot;Just breathe&quot; and had a visual of you and Benji on the mat - among other calming things of course.  How cool is that?  You were guiding me and not even knowing it!  Thank you so much for yoga, you and your calm guidance.  Namaste ~",Tamiah Johnston,2020-01-25T19:48:24Z,0

"This practice made realize that I&#39;ve made some progress since day 1. At first I did not get the &#39;cobra&#39; move at all, and now I&#39;m getting into it. My arm and back muscles seem to recognize the movement. My feet are getting stronger as well. I&#39;ve been dealing with strained foot/knee/hip muscles and joints on my right side the past few years because of scoliosis. I have to be really cautious, but yoga really works for me.

"So it was hard to push play this morning,  but I did among the chaos of everyone in my house already up and moving. Interruptions pulling my attention as I bumbled my way through the flow, but I tried to extend grace and a smile to each missed cue or falter. That&#39;s hard though for this  &quot;perfectionist&quot;, but it&#39;s good for me.  I&#39;ve come a long way.  <br />Then as I sat with my coffee and journal,  I opened The Gift by Hafiz, just to where it fell (my mom loaned it to me a month or so ago). And low and behold it fell open to the poem that Adriene quoted in the email this morning. I love how all things come together and overlap. I love that I was aware enough to realize it.  Namaste my friends.",Sharon Minigh,2020-01-25T14:08:41Z,5

I also really appreciated my feet! They have been working very hard for me lately, I am doing a lot of work in the gym to improve my balance as part of injury rehab and prevention and this practise is really supporting me! Thinking about pressing down with all four corners of the sole of my foot, and imagining energy flowing up the front body and down the back body works so well for balance!

So glad you told us that would only be 16mins long before we started. It definitely simulated and quickly woke my mind up as the moves seemed so quick at the beginning. It also energised the youngest of my cockapoos who unlike Benji spent the whole time trying to jump on me as I quickly moved from one pose to the next.

"Thank you for the uplift this morning! Early practice and feeling ready for the weekend. Ollie the dog did airplane ears when Adriene first said airplane arms! It shows consistent practice as he knows what&#39;s to part of the daily ritual. He showed by how unbalanced my knee and step forward is. He was the up and over practice I needed - right strong, left needs some support! Thank you thank you thank you ❤️ Xx",Jo Chew,2020-01-25T08:35:19Z,1

"@Emma Norrby Andersson haha yeah! it started like &quot;hm, maybe I&#39;ll do some random yoga for beginners in youtube tonight?&quot;. and there was &quot;YWA - Day 1. Ease into it&quot;. So I did it and the next day it was just a random idea: what if I repeat Day 1? So I did it again and found it&#39;s interesting: I noticed more in the video. So I decided to do it whole week. And during this week I decided to do it whole month. And at the end of the month I realized that I got into 30th months challenge. It was hard to believe I can do it (I never did anything regularly for so long). So I just kept going, to see how it ends. Remembering, that the hardest part is to unfold the mat. In two months or so I noticed that my breathing is different, my movements are different, energy level is higher. There are real changes in my body. With time I get used to do yoga every day. And it was always fun to do it in travel or in a company or in crazy places.",Илюша,2020-01-25T12:53:49Z,7

I am sad the 30 day challenge is coming to an end, but I’m looking forward to picking another one and treating it like another 30 day challenge - just committing to doing them. <br /><br />On another note, I’m a teacher and I’d love to get my students to make more professional videos and podcast recordings. Do you mind sharing the recording equipment you use? Part of what I love so much about your videos is the sound quality of your voice!<br /><br />Thanks again.",AR,2020-01-25T06:13:43Z,8

"On the mat and ready to rock and roll on this rainy Saturday morning. I don&#39;t know how to put it but it feels like I now know how to sense what type of energy is around me using my breath with my eyes closed. It really feels amazing every time I do it to the point where I incorporated it into my night routine about a week ago now. It has helped me sleep better. That&#39;s even more proof to believe in the saying &quot; Breathe to heal.&quot; Thank you, Adriene for the uplifting practice and for showing me how powerful mindful breathing can be.
