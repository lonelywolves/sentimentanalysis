It&#39;s Day 2! You are doing great. I am proud of you! Is there something you want to cultivate or amplify through this journey?,Yoga With Adriene,2020-01-03T12:02:08Z,1937

"I hope you are having a wonderful day. It was really hard to commit and show up today, but I did and I am proud of that. I came with tears and fears which my stressed state convinced me of, and now I am leaving with the smile and I bit more strength. I would like to cultivate self love and acceptance. I found it hard since I felt a bit neglected by my partner and lonely. He now thinks that I am upset about him spending time with other people, but actually I just feel like I am always initiating all our things to do together, and it is not sustainable for me. I hope whoever reads it finds peace and acceptance.",Polina Kornilova,2021-05-03T07:41:21Z,0

"Love your 30 days of yoga series that I just finished and found this one and Breath. Adrianne I love the way you teach the encouragement to feel what your body needs and follow that is amazing something I have always gravitated too but many instructors don’t encourage. I like that all the videos are different but incorporate some sameness as well that keeps things fresh but familiar. I’ve practiced on and off for several years but I’ve grown stronger, more flexible and more confident as I moved through the first 30 day series and I’m excited to keep going with Home and then it will be on to Breath. <br /><br />One of my favorite sayings is “Do more things that make you happy” this yoga makes me happy! 💜",Cortney Rubel,2021-04-06T11:57:19Z,0

I sat down in front of my wood burning stove and got about 5 mins into this video when I started to smell something bad.... cut to 10 mins later and I was up a ladder and on the roof pouring water down my chimney to put out a serious chimney fire. Suffice to say even the very brilliant Adriene could not help me find inner peace that day. That&#39;s a true story. <br /><br />I&#39;m back now though and really enjoying it.

"This is def not the easiest course Adriene offers, look around on the channel for videos &quot;for beginners&quot;.

Day 2 complete, thank you for another relaxing practice.<br />I have difficulties still with some basic fundamentals. <br />1) Sitting  - Using a cushion while by blocks are in the mail which will help a little but sat my legs poke up at least 45 degrees from the floor, left is worse than right. it&#39;s difficult to sit relaxed as I am constantly using the thigh and back muscles to correct the posture and stay in the position, feels strained in the hip joints.<br />2) Low lunge - Difficult to get into the pose properly as to reach my fingertips to the floor have to press my whole body into my thigh and round my shoulders forward, feels like I&#39;m doing it all wrong.<br />Feel free to share anything that will help if anyone has faced similar issues.",Liam Comer,2020-09-26T09:30:10Z,0

I&#39;ve got lordose and an kyphose, which results in me not being able to hug my knees to my chest. But you&#39;ve got to get creative with it! I fold a towel under my lower back so that it is supported and touching something that I can rest on. That&#39;s been working out on day 2 and I feel delighted",Lise S,2020-09-10T08:05:49Z,0

Okay so...I’m going to need some words of encouragement here...I’ve been doing pretty basic beginners  yoga for a little over a month and a half and the downward dog&gt;plank&gt;lunge sequences are really hard and I can’t ever complete them and it’s only day 2!  Should I continue on or find something easier?,Toni Ford,2020-08-26T23:44:42Z,1
Wade Ronsse  Thanks! Super helpful! 😊,Toni Ford,2020-08-27T23:06:18Z,0
"You&#39;ve got this though. Just remember that even if you skip a round of dog&gt;plank&gt;lunge and just sit cross-legged for a second, you can still work on staying present, breathing, and posture so either way you&#39;ll get something positive about it.",Wade Ronsse,2020-08-27T21:04:58Z,1
"There&#39;s zero shame in modifying things to fit your needs. I&#39;m 5 months in and still drop to knees frequently and even move into a resting position sometimes when my body is screaming at me. That being said, you might check out her original 30 Days of Yoga series as it definitely vamps up more slowly.",Wade Ronsse,2020-08-27T21:03:09Z,1

"Hi Adriene, thank-you so much. you&#39;ve really helped a lot of my friends! Yoga really supports me to cultivate a deeper awareness and to be less reactive and aggressive. Unfortunately, I have a wrist injury and it&#39;s really hindering my practice. No amount of rest is helping me heal and i&#39;ve had numerous cortisol injections. What should I do about my yoga? Is there any practice out there without emphasis on the wrist?  Thank-you and have a good day",Oscar LeStrange,2020-08-25T08:19:35Z,0

"So I have challenged myself that for 100 days I will wake up earlier (5am) and work on me. Mostly mental and preparation for the day. Tony Robbins talks about adding a morning exercise and when I did yoga classes at the YMCA years ago I really enjoyed them. I own a construction company and work it full time so over the years I have developed a very tight back, neck, and hips, plus shoulder issues. Yoga is exactly what I need to mold and limber up this sore stiff body. Adriene is amazing and easy to follow along with. Thanks for all you do!

I go to a physical trainer for a sport I do and when I went yesterday she said that it was actually pretty bad and she gave me some exercises and stretches to do daily. They helped a little but my back still felt tight after them. I did day one before I got injured and I decided to do this today",Sandra Campbell,2020-08-20T01:52:31Z,0

I&#39;m super unfit from quarantine but I keep having to stop multiple times through the practice to catch my breath and I find it super hard to follow along because I&#39;m so new to these poses and my body just does know how to fold that way 🙃 It just feels like everyone in the comments finds it so easy when I feel like imma pass out.

"Thanks Adriene and my world wide yoga fam. I had such an interesting and powerful experience doing this tonight. As someone who has struggled with focus and intention, I can get caught up in the negative chatter, I found the first thing that came to me was ‘kindness’. Even the idea of intention held expectation and that word felt really powerful, to be able to surrender and just be kind. I felt a really solid shift. Both last night and tonight my kitty has wandered in at the end of the video to give me a cuddle...Thanks for your grounded guidance. I’m excited to continue this 30 day Home journey !",Nikki Harrison,2020-07-29T10:38:09Z,0

"I didn&#39;t realize how many muscles I had supporting my spine, but yesterday&#39;s practice had my muscles screaming just from sitting up straight in the beginning! My intention is to be healthy, as I literally never have been. I&#39;m 21 and have been overweight for as long as I can remember, and it snowballed from childhood to obesity in adulthood. I have to lose 98lbs to be a healthy BMI (though I&#39;m actually aiming for 90, I prefer being a little on the thicker side lol). I was going to the gym 3 days a week but then the quarantine hit and I feel I lost all sight of my goals, gaining 10 lbs back. When I was at my healthiest in recent memory, it was because I was doing yoga and truly cared about my body. I want to be there again.",Bree B.,2020-05-02T05:34:22Z,2

The more you practice the more your mind/body will get used to working together and you&#39;ll naturally form connections between the words and the movements - before you know it, it will become muscle memory.

Hi everyone! I&#39;m new to yoga and am doing this journey to better myself and have some fun during this quarantine. I have one problem.

Thank you!,Cynthia Drummond,2020-04-21T23:53:27Z,0
"Hi Cynthia! Maybe this will help? Dumping all of your weight into your palms can be negative on your wrist, which is why you should energize you hands with active muscle energy to help recruit your forearm muscles to take some of the stress off your wrists.<br /><br /><br />You do this by spreading your fingers as wide as you can, and curling your fingertips down like you were clawing the Matt up to activate the top of your hand.<br /><br /><br />Then you actively squeeze your thumb and index finger together, as if you were going to drag them together with out actually letting them move, to activate the inside of your forearms.<br /><br /><br />Sending your weight equally through out all of your finger tips and palm, while doing all the other things mention, will help activate your arms muscles and take the strain off your wrists.",Tayler Bujnowski,2020-04-25T16:06:12Z,0

"I’m sure you have 0 control over what ads are shown before your videos, but a scary commercial came on and knocked me out of a calming yoga headspace!

"day two of my adventure: it went incredibly. Oddly enough, none of these poses hurt my knees, as I worried the child&#39;s pose would. I think the specific position with the hips evened out the stress on my body and made it a lot more comfortable than some other versions are. last time I felt less-than graceful, and there is already a major improvement there. also, if you have a cut on your fingertip, bandage it, as most poses use the hands (I learned this the hard way yesterday haha)",kynn,2020-04-20T02:53:49Z,0

Very thankful to have this journey during quarantine. I&#39;m a graduating college senior and the work doesn&#39;t stop even though classes aren&#39;t in person anymore.

"I intend to move THROUGH things, both in my practice and yoga flows as well as life in general. I have a tendency to rush through, or to focus on the end, not the journey or the movements. I want to get to that final position, I don&#39;t want to move slowly and feel the burn as I move myself into it. Both for my physical health, to gain all the benefits I can from this challenge, as well as my mental health and daily life, my intention for the rest of this challenge is to move through what I go through, not just move past. I intend to flow through, just like a yoga flow. I intend to move slowly from one pose, into the next, noticing how each individual moment feels and taking advantage of them, for it is becoming much easier to recognise that the best parts aren&#39;t the finished pieces but the journey and moments of making them.",rylea jayne,2020-04-17T23:56:11Z,0

"I have just began my yoga journey in hopes of becoming more at peace within myself and truly connect with my emotions and how I’m feeling - without avoiding them. It has been an especially difficult time for me (and everyone else of course) with social distancing, but I’m taking the opportunity to work on myself.  After completing Day 2 I was left feeling emotional - which at first I thought was strange. But (after a bit of research) I realised this is completely normal! I felt completely at peace to the point I felt myself tearing up - a feeling I have not experienced before. I am so excited to continue through this 30 day journey and thank you for the peace you have already brought me❤️❤️",Ashleigh Webb,2020-04-17T11:27:58Z,0

Have ,in past,  been Pilates/stretching, swimming, walking, dancing. This is perfect intro to yoga for me: at this time. Am either in school(we are now on a rota) or working from home. I do your video yoga, when I can, in the morning(sometimes early sometimes bit later) depending on what needs to be done. Second week for me, and just starting on session 2.

I am 55 and not quite as flexible and strong as you but your calming gentle voice and ever present smile encourages me to follow your advice and take my intention further. Today was easier than yesterday perhaps because of that thought being present during the exercises. I listen to your every word and one phrase popped :”Be kind.” so i realised i need to be kind to myself during the exercises! so i was. Tomorrow i shall return for Day 3.

"I think I&#39;m making in progress in my long-term yoga journey. Because usually I would not consider getting to Day 2 an achievement, I would dismiss it like &#39;everyone can do that&#39;, but now I&#39;m realising that actually that kind of self-talk isn&#39;t helpful for getting me where I need to be. The achievement isn&#39;t the end goal of 30 days or being near to the end, the achievement for me is in every day I choose to show up for myself and take the next step. It&#39;s the everyday little things I need to give myself more credit for.

Adriene&#39;s yoga is literally keeping me sane. My dog loves to watch me. He sometimes comes onto the mat or around in the back. He picks up on the peaceful vibe. I am a PreK teacher and learning to do distance teaching which has stressed me as I find the technology hard and to have to do this with parents watching...I am learning to accept myself in a way that I never have as I have no choice if I want to stay grounded.

"We repeated day 1 and will definitely have to repeat day 2 as well.  It went so much faster but with new poses like 3 legged dog that I could barely get into before we were moving on.  I felt like I scrambled to keep up and not fall over for half of it instead of focusing on intent and breathing.   <br />I don&#39;t mind redoing them, though. I&#39;m showing up for myself.

I try to &quot;claw into the ground&quot; but maybe I&#39;m not doing it right? I often have to take a break from that pose (and several others) not because my muscles are sore but because my wrists hurt. I also don&#39;t want my carpal tunnel to flare back up from doing this. Does anyone have suggestions for what I might be doing wrong or how I could avoid this issue? Thanks!!",Savannah A,2020-04-01T15:28:55Z,0
"I think the surest way to keep myself on track is to check in after the session each day.  I am not (have never been) a fan of the low lunge.  There just doesn&#39;t seem to be enough space.

Yay day 2 completed. Today’s practice helped me realize what I would like to work on during this journey physically and mentally. Physically I want to strengthen my wrists. I noticed not long into table top my wrist begin to hurt due to having to hold up all my weigh (I am on the heavy side). I would also love to be able to rest my whole foot on the mat during downward dog instead of having my toes curled. I am feeling better the yesterday about this 30 day journey.

I have had pneumonia and been very ill for the past 3 months, i have been doing lots of restorative yoga and yin yoga to try to build myself back up and this fits in with where i am right now so perfectly. I am truly thankful for the love and energy that you put into these classes,  its like you made them just for me. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

Thank you Adriene for offering us this journey for free (this is a wonderful resource for someone on a low budget who cannot afford yoga classes at this time). i am struggling my way out of a tough depression and i took the commitment to stick to these 30 days challenge. today it was hard taking myself out of the bed and finding the will to come again back on the mat but you seem to work real magic. already feeling better. had some cry again at the end of this session but it was a release little cry this time. i feel i am learning kindness towards myself and this is precious. also your speech through the session is really motivating and it brings me hope. namaste,Adelina Moisoiu,2020-03-01T14:29:51Z,0

Last year she would get up religiously every morning to do her practice with Adriene and now she is going to Cambodia to do her teacher training YAY!

"Started yesterday this journey, today is my day 2 and I feel so good already. The reason I wanted to start yoga (and the intention I had in mind while doing today’s practice) is that I want to be more connected to my body and to my soul, feel my body, learn and feel what feels good to me. I struggle so much to accept and love myself, both physically and internally. But I feel that taking this time for me on the mat is a way of showing love and gratitude to my body, and to myself. <br />Plus I love your voice",Ale B,2020-02-23T21:53:51Z,0

"I had begun to follow you 4 years ago with the first 30 day yoga challenge. I stopped soon after, as I was not in a great place and could not push through and love myself enough to believe in the practice or anything.<br />I was taught yoga almost 19 years ago for an improv class I did in college during my theatre diploma and we started every class with it. For years I thought I hated yoga bc didn&#39;t understand it and could not enjoy it. I tried, several times and got frustrated with my lack of flexibility and the hard poses that I just could not get my body to do. <br /><br /><br /><br />Now, also after several years of frustration and desperation, I&#39;m back in the acting game (didn&#39;t know you were also an actor) and have started to let go and release a lot of heartache and self-doubt as I am on a journey of self-love and de-programming. It isn&#39;t always easy but my commitment to exercise and my deep desire to show up is stronger than ever and I genuinely enjoy your practice. There are certain days that I literally cry on the mat as you dive into intention or talk in the pauses. I am so utterly grateful for your generous and open spirit and that I have found you here. I love doing this practice at home, albeit in a small space...I couldn&#39;t really picture enjoying it with anyone else leading the class even if you&#39;re not in the flesh!<br /><br /><br />I am eternally grateful for you and all that you&#39;ve brought to us in this collective practice. <br />So much love ❤️<br />Antonella (Montreal)",Ella Grace,2020-02-20T17:03:12Z,0
I started day 2 in 2 different times. 14 minutes in the morning at 5:30 am and the second half before bed. And let me tell you. I had very bad low back pain due to muscle spasms I got after I went into a hot sauna. 3 days of yoga and I can’t feel a thing.

The first day was filled with a lot of self-doubt and imposter syndrome and frustration with myself about how difficult these fairly simple exercises were for me to complete. So today my intention was to let myself be imperfect and recognize that it means I&#39;m doing something difficult and positive for myself and the struggle is just part of that.

"Just started after a prolonged illness that rolled me back months of exercise and rendered me weak, anxious and, as it turns out, angry. I found myself yesterday and today as well lashing out, thinking unkind thoughts like “I’m not here for lectures, I just want to move again”. While never keen on philosophy, I’ve always been appreciative of your messages, Adriene, and attentive to them at the very least. I now see that the mental and emotional space I’ve landed in is not a healthy one, not one that nourishes kindness and grace, my supreme values. I will dedicate myself through these 30 days to regaining not just my physical fitness, as I originally intended, but also the mental peace and balance apparently lost to me. Thank you for helping me reach this understanding.",Olga Lempert,2020-01-31T15:34:56Z,0

"I realize everyone here is all on  different journeys and each one is unique and special in their own way and there will be many explanations of their”intent” that you asked us to search for. While, not many will comprehend my “intent”, I am again taking my thoughts with me on this 30 day journey in the comments section so I can reflect back and see where I was mentally on that day.  My “intent” is to stop Sabotaging my success. I clearly now realize that I am afraid to succeed, especially when it comes to competition in a women’s bodybuilding contest. When I begin to progress at transforming myself for a bodybuilding contest, I believe I actually get scared at my progress and I thwart the progress by excuses which my psyche believes. It is because I know that God has given me the passion to compete since I’ve been 14years old (now 48)  and I have never yet had the courage to complete my training and step onstage. (though I must have tried what seems now over 100 times)Truth be told, I am disappointed in my self every day because of this fear of the unknown of success and I pray this 30 days with you will transform my mind, body and soul connection to finally tell my subconscious that enough is enough!!!

"I just started this journey (I know, I&#39;m a couple weeks late). I just moved to New York, and I don&#39;t have anything driving or motivating me right now to get out and start my day. This is already helping, and I&#39;m loving the pace so far! Now, I notice that when my legs are crossed or I&#39;m in child&#39;s pose, my legs fall asleep very quickly. Should I just not sit cross-legged or will this go away eventually? I have inverted hips and sat with my legs inverted instead of cross-legged when I was a kid, so maybe that has something to do with it?",Rebecca Martin,2020-01-14T15:59:00Z,0

Her instruction is so clear I rarely have to pause the video - well I paused it twice today and 5 times on day one! I found day 2 a faster speed than day 1, more than I expected, but I accepted the challenge and it really worked. I hope as I continue this 30-day challenge I don&#39;t have to pause or look up during the sessions and something tells me after this session I won&#39;t. :)",Dawn abelle,2020-01-13T05:01:40Z,16

"Hello Adriene and the community, just a question, but how do you deal with always feeling dizzy when getting up from the ground to mountain pose or other standing positions? It doesn&#39;t matter how slow I go, the moment I stand up and raise my arms, I get dizzy, lose my hearing for a few minutes, and sometimes even lose my vision for a few seconds. I am only 25, so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a condition or anything, and I do live in a hot country and it&#39;s summer right now, so I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s just blood rush from shifting positions, does anyone have an idea of how to not be so affected by it?",Guardian Eris,2020-01-12T16:31:52Z,0
"started again today on day 2, as last week the flu got the better of us. I do yoga together with my husband. After the session, we found out that for both of us, somewhere just before the first deep lunge, it was as if a trap door opened up underneath us, and we went into a different deep state. Suddenly all was soft and flowing, effortless and meditative. it stayed like that for both of us until the end of the session. how can this happen so clearly for both of us at the same time???",Ruth Rozelaar,2020-01-12T13:40:49Z,0

I did one of the other 30day challenges and loved it but lost track since. It wasn’t until the child’s pose today where I just broke down and cried with my breath..

"Loved this aside at minute 16. I&#39;m adding this to my journal for today: <br />&quot;The more we practice moving with intentions and thoughtfulness, the more likely we are to have these tools when we need them the most. On the mat, in a hard posture or on a day when we didn’t really want to show up or off the mat when we become angry or upset — do we have the practice under our belt to be thoughtful; to pay attention to recognize that our thoughts and words are important and our intentions can cultivate or amplify the things we want to manifest. This versus just being in a reactive state all the time.&quot;",Mandy Manley,2020-01-08T14:29:33Z,13
"Dear Adrienne, I really enjoy your videos, but there is one thing, you always speak, and it is very hard to stay focus on our breathing or anything else. Thank you.",Pierre Mlynarski,2020-01-08T13:36:47Z,0
"Thank you Adriene, I &#39;ve only just released I had been a bit reactive and was making my life way harder then its should be. day two has been very good because it&#39;s allowed allot of energy. Usually those poses are ones I tend to give up on, but this time I stayed in them and felt very energetic. I  wanted make a suggestion - Whilst I kinda like the new edited beginning of the video the ending is less favorouble as music is a bit loud. I like stay in a resting position for a few minutes, it would be nice if there were some calmer music or silence then.",Anna Williams,2020-01-08T13:28:24Z,0

Anyone else on Day 2 today?,Divya,2020-01-08T13:02:02Z,0
"A little confession here: I had to do this session twice. Yesterday, while doing it for the first time, I noticed, in the middle of the practice, that I was struggling more with my breathing than with the planks. As soon this thinking came to my mind, I disconnected from the practice and it&#39;s meaning (to intend). And, funny enough, my intention was to &quot;connect&quot;. So when I finished it, I took the decision of doing it again the next day. It was the best decision ever. Today, when setting my intention, I went a little further: &quot;connect with my inner power&quot;. I repeated it like a mantra during the session. I also paid more attention to my breathing and softened my movements. It went amazing. It&#39;s like I did two completely different sessions. Even I got to notice stuff that I didn&#39;t yesterday (like Benji&#39;s little claws walking through the room and some things Adriene said). So yeah, this is my story for Day 2. I didn&#39;t want to fall (more) behind by redoing an entire session, but I knew that it was the right thing to do. When you really set an intention and go for it during your practice, yoga gets a new meaning. Namaste 🙏.",Kristina D'Antonio,2020-01-08T12:56:35Z,503
"As someone who puts really high standards for myself, all these comments really help me to accept that I&#39;m not amazing at this from the start and that it&#39;s okay to slow down and redo days when needed. I just wanted to thank all of you for not being afraid of sharing because it&#39;s really helped me and I&#39;ve decided to redo this tomorrow and that this does not mean that I&#39;ve failed👏",69sleazyshots,2020-08-04T20:09:58Z,1

I too am thinking of repeating this day too. I noticed I struggled so much with the plank position and with downward dog. I haven’t done anything physical in a while and I am really out of shape. I’d like to get a little stronger mentally as well as physically on this 30 day journey.,Brenda Linker,2020-07-18T20:01:21Z,1
Thank you for making this comment! I didn&#39;t really think of this as an option and really helped me to do this a second time.,johanna kravic,2020-04-30T02:53:32Z,2
"Oh guys I&#39;m loving the support here! It&#39;s fantastic and uplifting. I was struggling a bit too with keeping up with the transitions and the breathing, and peeping all the time. I was so hesitant about redoing the cession because I started the journey with the goal of finishing in exactly 30 days. But throughout the practice, I also keep reminding myself to be patient and gentle with myself and I think trying the practice again is a great way to apply it. And seeing the comments encourages me. Now I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the best thing to do. No rush. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a journey, not a challenge. It&#39;s important to trust the process, enjoy it and observe as you learn to trust yourself more as you move through it! Good luck everyone! Namaste.",Adama Wade,2020-04-04T23:27:34Z,11

I am just starting this and feel like I am bumbling through it. Many of the things in the middle are difficult for me to do (hip replacement last year and rotator cuff rebuild 3 years ago that just isn&#39;t what it used to be). Not to mention I am very overweight and have big boobs so many of the poses are uncomfortable as well.

"I missed day 2, and day 3 I did my own flow outside after dancing with friends.  <br />One thing I am actively choosing with yoga, is to be kind to myself if I miss a structured day of it.  I can find moments of yoga in a busy setting, and then I will come back when the stretch of time is available. <br />One intention set, is to make movement a priority, yet in a manner that doesn&#39;t feel like a &quot;have to&quot;, but... &quot;I want to.&quot;<br />Your yoga videos have definitely helped me to just get up and do yoga with or without a structured video. <br />When I was doing another 30 day series, it took me so much longer than 30 days to do it, but I was like, &quot;I&#39;m stronger and 3 days of yoga a week is better than no days of yoga a week!&quot; <br />I say this, because a lot of us can be hard on ourselves when we feel we messed up a sequence, a challenge, a diet, etc..<br />Thank you for this gift of a home practice.",Sarah Torgerson,2020-01-05T20:17:33Z,0

Too much plank for me in this session. I can do it but it create tensions and I want more relaxation. Because I m already so tense in my life. It seems more like fitness than yoga to me.

Each day which I start from yoga with you I find myself better motivated to do things that are best for me all the day long. The best incouragement for me this time was your idea to show up on the mat anyway even if I feel down, lazy and so on. Just be present. Today it helped me to get out of the bed and show up on the mat. And though I thought I am going just to see the video and maybe strech a little bit, I ended up doing all the excercises.

"Thank you, Adriene, for creating this 30-day challenge. Nothing brings me back to my center quite like yoga. There&#39;s something about leaving everything at the door and coming to my mat, ready to quiet the outside noise, and focus on being present with myself. You are so easy to listen to, so kind, and so encouraging. Your words of encouragement throughout this video really came at the best times for me, when I was struggling to hold a pose or starting to let my outside thoughts creep back in. The name of this 30-day challenge really is perfect, because these moments really feel like HOME. Thank you for creating all your amazing videos and helping me, among millions of others, to take yoga with us wherever we go. Much love to you and Benji! xx",flylikexag6,2020-01-04T04:31:57Z,0

Yesterday was quite rough but today I set my intention: grace. My word of the year is Courage and I want to be gracefully courageous as I start to go through tough trials ahead. Grace reminds me to soften my facial expression and that immediately helps. I loved our first child’s pose.

"Day 1 was a perfect pace for me, I’m 51 and been off the mat for three years so I was really happy with the pace and the theme. Day 2 I’m really struggling to keep up and every joint is cracking. Not really fitting in with my intent. I’ve been off the mat so long I need to go really slow and the fast pace is throwing me off. It was just a surprise compared to yesterday.<br />....<br /><br />I stopped and watched the video through. Then I started again. I had to keep it easy and gentle but I still struggled. Somewhere around the fourth half plank my body stopped shaking, I felt my mind clear and a sort of strengthened feeling in my muscles. I was able to finish with control. What I started in struggle today, I ended with strength. Amazing! I’m so surprised at this. It feels a bit like a metaphor for what’s been going on in my life lately.

Enjoyed day 2. I’ve been off yoga most of the year in lieu of other workouts or nothing at all (hey I’m being honest 🤷🏻‍♀️) and I’m hoping to get back to it. I guess that is my intention: don’t beat myself up for not sticking with it and enjoy the process of getting back to where I was and to continue growing. 🧘🏻📿🤟🏻🙏🏻,Runnels Ashley,2020-01-04T02:42:57Z,0

"I really did not feel like coming to the mat today - I had just bought some new plants &amp; wanted to get them properly nested into my home. But I did come to the mat &amp; I am so glad I did. I really had no idea what intention I should set when Adriene first started talking about it BUT THEN I remembered that I have a rather rude awakening amount of alone time coming up &amp; I want to become my own best friend so I do not mind spending time &quot;alone&quot; with myself. So that is my intention: become my own best friend. I&#39;ve done yoga sporadically for years but never regularly &amp; I am hopeful &amp; optimistic that this home journey will be the flowering of a regular practice for me. It really stuck out to me when Adriene said something like &quot;Practice so you can take it off the mat too - be less reactive, be more thoughtful in how you choose to react&quot; or something like that because reactivity &amp; a bit of a temper are something I really struggle with. Anyway, I am looking forward to tomorrow. Thank you, Adriene! PS Give Benji a hug for me.",Kait Mauro,2020-01-04T02:39:07Z,1

"Wonderful day 2 was exactly what I needed even if I didn&#39;t know it, I found myself finding ease without putting a strain on myself to do so, it just came naturally and I know not everyday will be like that, speaking for experience and I know everyone know what that&#39;s like but it make us appreciated the days when the ease is just second nature and that is my intention to always be present with that ease even when it&#39;s a struggle so thank u Adriene for reminding us to be present with our intention, much love to u and benji who saw something very interesting outside in the beginning of the practice so much so that I wanted to see what he was looking 😂 anyways can&#39;t wait for tomorrow&#39;s new practice much love , Namaste 💕💞💓💗💖❤🙏",Vanessa Morris,2020-01-04T01:41:25Z,0

"One of my favorite people to listen to is Alan Watts, and something mind blowing he would do often is pronounce and redefine words that we use often in conversation to give it a deeper context. When thinking about &quot;intend&quot; today, I though of it as in-tend...and the antonym ex-tend. With this in mind through practice, the mantra that manifested was the following: <br /><br />&quot;Whenever I extend myself for validation, I will in-tend to reason of why I seek outside of myself in the first place.&quot;  In-tention of anything becomes an ex-tention through work, and yoga is one of the things I will show up for each day to strengthen my intention.<br /><br />Also friends, if you ever have trouble showing up for practice, something that has helped me be consistent is that just being here is much better than not showing up at all. If you are tired, just lay on the mat and do the best you can. There is no need to hit all the poses perfectly, because it&#39;s not about that in the first place. As Adriene always mentions, &quot;create space.&quot; Love and gratitude for all of you, Namaste 🙏",Jay-Ram Rajendra,2020-01-04T00:47:46Z,0

"Im excited to try 30 days of yoga with Adriene! I am coming off a shoulder injury and also currently have tendonitis in my wrist. I was excited to see in the promo materials that this practice is for everyone even post-injury, with modifications. I havent seen a lot of mod options in the vids that apply - can you suggest mods for wrist and shoulders? Down dog is a problem for both (ive been doing on forearms but that doesnt seem great for my shoulders, although planks are fine for my shoulders). If i sat in childs pose thru every vinyasa, id be sitting out a lot of the video. Trying to be patient with myself but dont feel like i have the tools to make mods safely and am a bit discouraged.... any advice?

"Ahhh I felt so great, so good, so accomplished at the end of the video!!! My intention, in my yoga journey, in the &quot;Home&quot; journey, but also in my life in general, is to be patient. More patient! I need to trust the process. I allow myself to be frustrated, sad or maybe angry, but I intend to take action. To find a solution. Or just be that: *patient*! And today went super well; these planks were intense, my heart was beating pretty fast. I told myself to be patient, to not think about what was going bad, about how I wanted to collapse because &quot;ugh, no, it&#39;s too hard, too challenging&quot; and I NAILED IT FOR THE WHOLE SESSION, ALMOST!

I left my home in Colorado a few months ago to come to Egypt, and it’s been very challenging and I haven’t felt a sense of home since. I struggle very much with leaving my thoughts of past and future to rest each and every day. My intention today was to be present. Was I present throughout the whole practice? No, but when I noticed I was starting to spiral into my thoughts, that intentionality offered a warm reminder to be gentle with myself and allow time to reconnect with myself at this moment in time. I left the mat today with warmth in my chest and a lot of excitement for tomorrow. Thanks Adriene!",Olivia Carter,2020-01-03T20:31:03Z,0

"Post-holiday.. it&#39;s still so hard to manage to feel this lightness when doing yoga, feel like I&#39;m wearing a backpack with tones of stones.. haha😅 .. looking forward to lose one stone at a time when the days pass.. 💪 Intentions: LIGHTNESS and VIBRANT ENERGY! 🧘😇<br />Thank you Adriene!

"I feel like some pieces are coming together for me. I have chronic muscle tension and last time I got a massage, the therapist said, &quot;it&#39;s just not wanting to let go&quot;. That reached deep into my soul. And I asked my soul, &quot;why don&#39;t you want to let go&quot;? The response I got back was fear. So my intention since then, has been to &quot;let go&quot;. I have been telling my subconscious - I know you have been trying to protect me, and you have done a great job. But it is time to let go now. We need to move on.<br /><br />Focusing on the intention this practice, has released something inside me. It is small; it will take the letting go of lots of little bits and pieces before the fear is gone and I make it to peace. But one little bit has released today and it is leaving thru my eyeballs. Thanks again Adriene ❤️",Ayverie,2020-01-03T20:20:27Z,235
"Replying to this really late, but &#39;I know you have been trying to protect me, and you have done a great job. But it is time to let go now. We need to move on.&#39; I&#39;m going to write that down and read it every day. So gorgeous.",Libby Bushill,2021-02-02T21:46:25Z,0

You mentioned the idea of being reactive rather than moving with intent. I think in this fast paced world you do what you need to do to keep up but perhaps not always fully connected as a result. My 2020 challenge is to breathe &amp; re connect again,Kim Dunn,2020-01-03T20:01:13Z,0

Little by little I started to do yoga almost every day, your wonderful yoga videos have truly transformed me in such a profound way. These past three and a half years have been life changing since I&#39;ve gained muscle, I&#39;m extremely flexible, I&#39;m in tuned with my heart and the energy flows freely through my body.

"Adriene - Just a quick observation that I hadn&#39;t noticed before today but the camera seemed at times to be from a high angle using a wide angle lens which had the effect of looking down on you and distorting you somewhat,  I find it more challenging with that camera angle as when and am decidedly more comfortable with the straight on angle shot as you use in the beginning and the end of the video.  There is something about the distortion caused by the high angel combined with the wide angle lens that is a bit unsettling - maybe just me but I wanted to provide that feedback.  thanks",Michael Schneider,2020-01-03T18:47:05Z,0

Day 1 was pretty easy, however half way through Day 2 I wasn&#39;t able to keep up on some of the movements and was worried that these sessions would progress too quickly for me to keep up.

After today&#39;s session I feel energized and ready to go start my day. I am so excited for all the different feelings I will have and things I will discover during this 30 day journey. I added HOME to my miracle morning routine and already am so happy to start off the day with you and have the effects spread throughout my day vs trying to fit in the practice during last year&#39;s 30 days.

I&#39;m so excited to be doing 30 days of yoga again. The last one I did was 5 or 6 years ago. I&#39;ve done yoga a couple times a week in between other workouts since then but theres something about the 30 days. It makes you feel like you&#39;re apart of something. And it&#39;s easier to notice the changes in your body when you&#39;re being this consistent.,Adrift in Midgard,2020-01-03T16:02:03Z,0

"I intend to get back to where I was.  A little over two months ago, I was in a bit of an accident.  I had been in the best shape of my life, doing yoga regularly and commuting on bike to and from work, between 5 and 10 miles a day depending on the route.  I took a notorious short cut and ended up getting hurled off my bike and slamming my knee in to the concrete.  I&#39;m mostly better now, but it has been about the same amount of pain for the last month.  I&#39;ve participated in the 30 day challenge for 4 years now and I was convinced I was going to have to sit this one out.  Then I remembered that Adriene has taught us all kinds of variations and her motto, FWFG.  I&#39;m on day 2, and I&#39;m letting my body tell me what it needs.  I&#39;m glad I&#39;m here and I&#39;m glad all of you are too. Namaste.",Hana Alshahab,2020-01-03T15:57:54Z,0

I have a rare form of ovarian cancer called granulosa cell tumor. GCT. I had a laparotomy October 14th. I had a total hysterectomy and removed a 17cm x 15cm tumor of my right ovary and had a recurrence this past year hence the laparotomy where the gyn onc removed 6 more tumors.  I have had a cath port put in where I now receive Avastin injections once every three weeks.  I can not go in the sun.  I have gained alot of weight especially in my abdomen. I am stiff...and I am sad.  This practice has given me something to look forward to and my INTENTION is to get my body back to the condition I was in before as well as combat the sadness.  I came to the mat on day one in tears..cried to the first downward dog and released whatever that emotion is called.  Today..couldn&#39;t wait..so good to return to your practice Adriene..so very good.  I INTEND to go beyond this 30 day practice and do it every day all year and beyond.

For the first time ever, instead of rolling back over for 8-38 more minutes of sleep (depending on how many alarms I actually needed) I instead rolled out of bed and made it to the mat.

"I just wanted to offer some advice for anyone new to yoga. It&#39;s amazing. You will tone your body while getting an amazing stretch. You will stand taller and feel leaner. Don&#39;t be discouraged if you don&#39;t look like adriene in her poses and postures, just &quot;find what feels good.&quot; Adriene tells us that its your body and everyone is different, we all slept different and have different pains. So modify the poses and moves as needed until it feels right in your body. Also if your wrists hurt you can make a fist and use your fists instead of palms. But your wrists will hurt sometimes, you just have to remind yourself in your head to be light and loosen any pressure you are putting in your wrist. So press into all ten fingers. You just have to practice :) and if the video is too fast for you, you can change the speed. I like to take my time and hold certain postures longer so changing the speed to be slower comes in handy. One more thing you don&#39;t need &quot;yoga clothes&quot; I do yoga in my pajamas every day. I hope this helps anyone new to yoga:) take ur time don&#39;t give up and &quot;Find what feels good&quot;.",Noelle,2020-01-03T14:40:17Z,0

Thank you Adriene. I truly appreciate your classes. They are the highlight of my morning while drinking a berry smoothie. The intention for me was more about letting go and surrendering but also while cultivating some gratitude. Its nice to do yoga slow for once. I found that the mind did intercept and I did get misaligned sometimes during the down dog/ transitioning to plank and then back to the down dog. It was hard to feel aligned in that for some reason.  I suppose its because we start to fixate too much on being perfectly aligned. I guess it will get better the more I slow down and take these classes with you with intentional focus.

"Linda, I&#39;m a 70 year old yoga teacher, and I  hope you don&#39;t mind if I give you some suggestions. Sit comfortably in a chair for the seated poses. Get as much benefit from the wonderful breathing of yoga as possible. Do the child pose and back-lying poses on your bed. Skip or greatly modify any pose that causes pain. Keep doing this every day. We are all in this together, all moving to the best of our ability. Good luck. Namastè.",Terri Walters,2020-01-04T02:23:27Z,0

"Lovely Adriene,<br />Forgive the length of this comment. I&#39;ve been practicing yoga with you for a few years now, but only physically, and always intermittently. Six years ago I lost my leg and without giving it real thought I mindlessly assumed yoga was out for me. Then I found a few seated flows and would only do them if I could sit or lie the whole time. This past year I went back to your videos and decided that I wanted to engage in the yoga that seemed unrealistic for me. Your loving way of guiding us through the practices taught me to be patient with myself, to listen to my body, and I began to emotionally connect with the poses, and truly enjoy the process rather than look to a desired outcome.<br />I can now, without getting irritated as I once did, easily flow in and out of my prosthetic as needed in a practice, find more strength and connection with my body, and the inner and outer growth is tangible.<br />This is the first 20-Day practice I&#39;ve signed up for and my husband and I get right out of bed and do it before anything else. Thank you for your gentleness, the sincere love with which you teach, and for teaching me to be a better student. So much love and gratitude to you, and Happy New Year. &lt;3",Melissa Miller,2020-01-03T12:59:32Z,2

"This was so lovely to do. Most of the time in this video I thogh that I cant do it, but yo kept me motivating so I did it. And this is, what these 30 Days is gonna be for me: I can do this. I can show up on my mat everyday. I can do this. I can control this. <br />Lastly I felt like I lost the control over most things in my life, but this keeps me motivating. I can do this. I am strong. And if i can stand on the mat daily, I can doeverything, right?<br />I did it. Thank you, Adriene.",Elliott Larkin,2020-01-03T12:05:03Z,0

"Hello from New Zealand! Thank you for this wonderful practice today Adriene, the love that you pour into this channel and effectively every one of your millions of subscribers makes me feel a gratitude that I can&#39;t even begin to put into words. I&#39;ll settle for simply this- thank you. 🙏 I&#39;ll admit that I could not at first figure out what my intention was at the beginning of the practice--what it was that was kept drawing me back to the yoga mat (which in my case is the carpeted floor) and was quietly motivating me to show up each day... but it came to me right at the end, when you told us to put one hand on our heart and the other on our belly. I realised my intention was to be gentle with myself. Practicing every day, is my way of effectively giving back to my body and to my mind and to my spiritual self and it is the one time where I am so very kind and loving to myself, mindfully so, for an extended period of time. It is my hope, or my intention that I can slowly integrate that same gentle love (that is somehow easier to give others than to yourself) into my daily life. This community awes me and I am so grateful to be within it. ❤️",Liese O'Brien,2020-01-03T12:03:08Z,1
"BEGINNERS TIP! :<br /><br />Anyone who&#39;s finding some poses difficult or is struggling to hold them for long periods of time, dont feel bad about it! I&#39;ve done Yoga for 2 years now but have had about 4 months of doing none and so these practices feel amazing but new. If you do struggle feel free to go into child pose or stop and take a few deeps breathes and dont feel bad about it, use these practices to feel joy, comfort and relaxation and you can adapt parts to make that fit you! ❤",Grace Kate,2020-01-03T12:02:17Z,3
I choose to intend joy in my everyday life. From drinking my coffee to running errands - I want to see joy in the little things in my daily routine which makes getting up special each day.

"Wow you guys are so good. I started last year&#39;s 30 day challenge (in like mid-Feb or something) and was enjoying it a lot but then I missed several days halfway through because life and then I was worried that I regressed and got discouraged and then didn&#39;t find motivation to start again since. When she started this year&#39;s 30 day challenge, it motivated me to try to follow along with everybody else (I saw it a few days late so I&#39;m already behind lol, but a few days behind still kind of feels more motivating than starting after most people have finished). I did like 4 or 5 days of the 2018 challenge, half of the 2019 challenge, I hope I can get through all of this one!",Momera,2020-01-06T18:08:23Z,1

"Hey Adrienne, first and foremost, I love your videos and they really help me. Since doing dedicate last year I&#39;ve been doing yoga nearly every day, usually work your videos and it&#39;s been so good for me!<br /><br />I have a question for you: I have a big belly and fairly long legs compared to my arms. That means that when I&#39;m in lunge, I can&#39;t reach both my hands to the ground while stacking my leg over my foot. I can do one hand (which means I&#39;m askew on my yoga mat) or no hands (which sure makes it a LOT harder) or lizard variation, but not a normal lunge. Do you have any tips on the best way to adapt the posture? Thank you so much for everything! Lots of love",Ginnyvos,2020-01-03T11:38:36Z,1

Hi Maryse. It&#39;s always best to check with your doctor and follow their advice on which poses to avoid. For now modify the ones you know are causing pain.

"If you don&#39;t think you can achieve these 30 days : this is probably my 3rd or 4th year doing it. Except usually, i skipped day 0 if there was one, started around mid-January, and ended around March. I know this is only Day 2, but this is the first year I&#39;m doing this at the time it&#39;s uploaded, and I&#39;m glad I was patient enough with myself the previous years. I started late, skipped days, I stopped and looked at the video when it felt too hard... But I kept doing it, and this year, it doesn&#39;t feel like such an effort.

Yoga With Adriene I did it and felt awesome for half an hour but now I’ve felt a little bit sick again. I will try harder to listen my body and follow its rules :) <br /><br />P.S.: I’ve practiced with u for more than 3 months. You and Benji inspired me to take care of a puppy. She is 4 months now. First she got angry when I started doing yoga because she didn’t know what I was doing and why she couldn’t join it but now she enjoys it and sleeping next to me while I’m practicing. <br /><br />God bless u! Wish u all the best during this new year 2020!,Лунна Лунна,2020-01-03T13:49:39Z,0

I&#39;m afaid its too advanced for me and I have to stop. Do you have an easier version?,Jürgen Schadeberg,2020-01-03T07:38:17Z,0
"Don&#39;t give up!  It&#39;s not too advanced but perhaps you may need to modify the practice for your needs. For instance:  the Planks - do on your knees (not fully lifted); Down Dog - again, do from your knees (puppy pose); Chaturanga - do from your knees and raise to Baby Cobra (mini-baby - as little lift as you are able).  Any of the poses can be done in the most simplified of versions which can be found online (search YWA and enter a pose - you will find videos that show technique).  At anytime, stop and move into Child&#39;s Pose to rest. If this doesn&#39;t work for you, than just BREATHE and do the parts that you can.  You will get stronger!!!!  Showing up is the absolute hardest part! Namaste!",Tammy Doerrl,2020-01-03T15:53:20Z,0

Ambereen K My recommendation would be  starting with her first every 30 days of yoga series done in 2015. It’s amazing and especially suited for someone who wants to take a first challenge and she walks you through a lot of stuff.

"My cat was super into this practice! <br />I was doing this today morning in our kitchen, cos we have a guest sleeping in the livingroom and i didn&#39;t want to bother them. My cat was hanging out with me, and as i put my laptop on the floor to start this video, my cat first sat in front of the screen, watching for a while. Then she walked around the laptop and went to sit behind the screen, looking at the video from upside down angle and every now and then shifting her gaze at me, like making sure i was doing the same thing as the video! <br />And then she decided to climb up to my lap as i was sitting legs crossed in the beginning. Once i had to start moving i lifted her up next to me on the yoga mat. She continued following me very closely through the whole practice, and at the end when i was flat on my back on the floor, she climbed on top of my belly and stayed there purring.",Venny Chardonnay,2020-01-03T07:03:19Z,0

"@Derek Walker I relate with this ...  I wait until after my shower, as I feel more mobile. Listen to your body and find a time that works best for you personally! Her motto is &quot;find what feels good,&quot; so as long as you keep that in mind, you&#39;re golden! :)",Janna Kindred,2020-01-03T19:09:28Z,2

Hi Adrienne. Loving the series. Any way to publish the videos a bit earlier for your friends in Europe? Love to practice with you first thing in the morning. Lots of love from Amsterdam &lt;3,Allison Gould,2020-01-03T06:27:08Z,0
"Hey Allison, I asked the same question in the Kula app and I got this answer: <br /><br />“The video is released to YouTube at midnight Central Time. <br /><br />We release it 12 hours earlier to members of the Find What Feels Good membership at <a href=""http://www.fwfg.com/"">www.fwfg.com</a> as well as to the downloadable collection at <a href=""https://cart.yogawithadriene.com/products/home-downloadab..."">https://cart.yogawithadriene.com/products/home-downloadab...</a>. <br /><br />The FWFG membership is a streaming service and is $9.99/month. It has the entire YWA/FWFG library. The downloadable collection is just the HOME series and is donation based. Perhaps one of those options would be a better fit for your schedule.”",Marjolein Stots,2020-01-03T06:36:01Z,1
Good Morning Adrienne.  Firstly may I say thank you for introducing people to Yoga.  This will be my first time completing a 30 day journey.  I have only been doing Yoga a short time (August 2019) but the improvements I have seen in my mind and body have been overwhelming! It’s early morning here in the UK my day will be starting with you.
