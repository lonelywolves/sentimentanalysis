"These classes are so lovely! I&#39;ve been taking them for four months now. One aspect among many that is great is that you explain a posture when we&#39;re on one side AND when we&#39;re on the second side, which is super helpful. And you often find another element in the posture that you may not have mentioned the first time.",Anita Aboulafia,2021-03-06T22:06:09Z,0

"Universe is wierd. I wish I could show this, I know I need to work on my heart Chakra and have been struggling with a lot - including this tachycardia that I can not seem to understand (yes I have seen a cardiologist- who has monitored but dismissed me) but anyway I think centering will also help with this. Long story short my mat has an inprint of a  heart❤ from my feet like a reminder of why I am working out again and why I did yoga this morning. I have been struggling with working out, glad I chose yoga 🧘🏾‍♀️",Sweet_Curly_Goddess,2021-02-19T13:26:12Z,1

"I have avoided this Yoga for so long because of its name, sounded too girly for me and as I&#39;m still not very good at embracing my feminity, I kept avoiding it for couple of years now.  But today a cloudy silent Sunday morning, I woke up early and decided to go beyond the name and give it a go. The practice was amazing but man oh man right after I finished I went down to read the comments and I don&#39;t know what happened but a heavy emotion washed over me and I started sobing like a baby. Now, one year before today I would of freaked out but today I just welcomed the cry and the whole emotion. I got my box of tissues and a blanket and wrapped myself like a burrito of love <del>as Adrienne says in one of my favorite practices of her</del> and lied down in my yoga mat wrapped in my blanket and just cried. I have been building myself up this year after leaving a toxic relationship, and I dedicated this practice for me. I also have been harboring so much stress lately and I have been feeling it in my upper back and my throat the past week. I knew it but I didn&#39;t know how to release it but I think this was what I needed today. Thank you is not enough Adrienne, I have been doing yoga with you since 2015 on and off and the past year no day has passed without me getting on the mat with you before starting my day, even if it&#39;s for 5 minutes. Once my friend asked me why I do yoga, I told her, I like the work out and the flexibility but tbh I do it for my sanity and to recenter myself. I&#39;m now in the point where I can&#39;t imagine my life without yoga and without these practices with you. Your gentleness and guidance is priceless thank you for your hard work for yoga, for your gentleness and light spirit, for being the best , for providing us all such amazing practices for free, and for bringing us all together from all around the world♥️♥️ And if you ever struggle with purpose please know that you have changed my life for the best.

"your yoga videos have seen me in many a state thru the years, and I&#39;m grateful and constantly reminded of all the positive changes I&#39;ve seen happening in my life since starting my practice and honing in on the things that made me a little bit crazy, working out the kinks one day at a time and being patient, trusting and enjoying every step of the way. That&#39;s what you&#39;ve taught me. You are a truly kind and generous human and it shines thru in all of your videos, you give people who are vulnerable the space to grow, and accept and love themselves without forcing any kind of &quot;way&quot; or regimen. Seriously we need more of that in this world, you are inspiring a future community of yogis, who I think will pass down your messages and the messages of many before you that emphasize personal practice, introspection and &quot;finding what feels good&quot; I don&#39;t usually comment on these videos, but I was tense today and I&#39;m getting back into my practice after a month on the road working non-stop, it feels like coming home in a way.

"so i&#39;ve been playing a Dnd campaign with some friends for two years now, i play a Light Cleric who&#39;s holy symbol includes a rose. I&#39;ve learned a LOT about myself through her and her archangel, who was made from roses. With everything going on in the world, i&#39;m finding i have to learn how to control and direct my anger and remember to act from love, just like my cleric (who is now a barbarian champion of her archangel! Woo!). This video came up as a suggestion on a day when i was feeling particularly lost, so of course my Pisces brain saw it as a gentle reminder from Tadriel to control and direct my anger and to always act from love, and to take care of myself in the process. Thank you for this flow.",C darieal,2020-08-31T01:18:11Z,0

"Thank you for this practice. <br /><br />When waking up this morning, I felt powerless, low on energy and generally I&#39;ve been mostly feeling depressed these days. <br />A couple of weeks back I have decided that it is time to love myself just as I am. (Easier said than done) I hated myself most of my life and it&#39;s been rough (even though I&#39;m sure it&#39;s been much rougher for other people) <br />I started this practice with the intention to let go...to let go of all these negative thoughts, all the pain I carry within. <br />A few minutes into the practice I started crying and I just wouldn&#39;t stop. With each heart opener tears just started flowing out of my eyes. <br />I realized I feel lonely...I don&#39;t know how to change that and I know I&#39;m not alone but at the same time I do feel like I am. I feel lost.<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t want to destroy all your positive vibes. It&#39;s felt good to cry thank you for all the love you give and the support you provide. It is truly inspiring. <br /><br />Sending lots of love &lt;3",Diana Horvath,2020-07-25T11:10:27Z,0

"Hi Adriene, I enjoyed this class, but sometimes thought came that you speak too much and I stay too long not doing, when I came to practice Hatha Yoga. Other times, for me, and according to the American College of Sport&#39;s Medicine, you take too little time on certain important poses, certain important areas of tension where you are too fast. Finally, there was no final relaxation which was very disappointing. Anyways, thank you for your effort and have a great day regardless!",André Periquito,2020-06-12T11:21:49Z,0

She loves me nevertheless and I cried thinking about how lucky I am for people forgiving me despite my mistakes. So I should forgive myself too, move on, and love more openly. I cried a lot especially in the cactus arms because they meant surrendering, opening my eyes to my deepest darkest regrets so that I could free the way for my hopes and dreams for a brighter future, in which I can give love more freely.

She usually get&#39;s scared when people move but not when I&#39;m mindful or doing yoga!! She stayed there for the rest of the practice (I had to skid squeeze your knees to your chest😄) and seemed to really enjoy!

"Loved this Rose Flow-THANK YOU!  Was raining today, could not walk, and it was my birthday so tried this and am so appreciative of Adrienne.  Been a devoted yoga practitioner for many years and when my yoga instructor was unable to teach AND then we had to stay home did the 30 Day Home and now started the True series.  Adrienne is amazing and at 66 doing yoga everyday I am amazed at how much stronger I can be while continually learning to breathe!!!!  You are an angel Adrienne!",Laurie Redel,2020-05-11T19:51:41Z,0

"My mother told me to go upstairs and do some yoga as I looked like I needed it. It has been a very overwhelming few days in lockdown in the UK and i think this is having a big impact on well being, self love and love for life. This session really helped ground me to the warmth within myself and that the earth can give us. I was quite emotional. My mantra was self love and I love myself for rolling out my mat, knowing that it is ok not to be ok but that I have found something that can help and utilizing that. Thank you Adriene, you bring comfort and warmth into our lives even in these dark and confusing times. Namaste",Holly Sophia,2020-05-11T10:46:41Z,15
"Just saw your newsletter today and followed the yoga link to here. So sorry you had a nose mishap. Wish you better soon and thanks for this wonderful rose yoga. Rose for the nose? That just came into my head! My heart feels lighter both physically and emotionally. I have been dealing with grief and heart issues for the last couple of years. I will make this one a regular part of my yoga practice. I feel a real shift in my energy towards healing. Thank you for all that you do to promote yoga. I dedicated this morning&#39;s practice to myself and a friend called Rose, not because she is called Rose but because she also struggles with grief. However, I like that Rose is her name. Such a beautiful flower and resonant with symbolism. May we all heal through these difficult times.",Adriana West,2020-05-11T10:31:09Z,0

But this practice made me feel better. Also the vulnerable, honest love letter in my mailbox from Adriene made me feel warm and safe. I love how there is no fancy expensive yoga pants, exotic beaches, &quot;juice cleanses&quot; bs, but just our lovely Adriene, in her home with her best buddy, teaches us how to love the world and ourselves.

I am worthy of unconditional love. Thank you for this practice on Mother’s Day. I really needed the self love. Mother’s Day is always hard for me as I am no longer on speaking terms with my mother. Growing up with a narcissistic mother warped my perspective on love for a long time. Her affection was always conditional. Now I have a husband who loves me unconditionally and a mother in law that shows me what a real mother’s love is. ❤️🌺,Rachel B,2020-05-10T20:56:59Z,0

"@Yoga With Adriene Hope your sweet nose is better. 💚 🍀😘 Love to you and nose! I hate pain in the face from anything–- like fire.This was the second time I have done this exquisite practice. Last time I did it with my beautiful daughter in France. And this time I did it after watching a movie for Mother&#39;s Day with my darling son, here in California! The great thing was I noticed with pleasure that all my practicing is paying off. ( I don&#39;t think I have missed a day this year, and since last July I  have probably missed only 2 days...)  It wasn&#39;t so difficult and was much more gorgeous  this time! I teeter less and I burn less but still feel triumphant, and graceful!  So happy. Happy Mother&#39;s Day to your Mom. Shelter well, and be safe, you International Treasure! ❤️💞",Nan Elizabeth Jorgensen,2020-05-11T11:13:04Z,2

"I&#39;ve shied from this particular practice, and like others, I thought it would be soft. But adriene and my body proved me wrong. Being feminine is hard regardless of gender. It requires strength to stay open and tender without getting hard to the darkness. I dedicated this practice to others who have yet to find their footing, who feel broken, sharp and dangerous, and every shake of my body, every time my mind said quit quit youre not strong enough, my heart said I was, that I can. Since I first started yoga, I&#39;ve changed. I never believed in change, never knew anyone who could change especially for the better. But now I believe. I listen with my heart and accept my mind in its chaos. I move with love on the mat and it transfers to love in live too. Ive struggled with anger and depression all of my life, wrestling questions about right and wrong, and I&#39;ve lost myself to addiction -- to people, to drugs, to school -- but now im addicted to life. Im addicted to love. And it is my greatest wish to help others reach this same conclusion. Adriene, you had a wonderful mother. Im sure she wasn&#39;t perfect, but she was perfect for you. Im so grateful to the mother in you nurturing the hurt child in me and teaching her to dance again. Namaste",peach fuzz,2020-04-30T20:58:56Z,12

"I cried on the mat for the first time during this flow. at the very end when I pressed my hands to my chest, I started crying because I wasn&#39;t prepared for the warmth and gentleness of that simple gesture. I find myself resisting love when it is offered to me, even when I show it to myself, but in such a vulnerable space all I could do was to let it in. I dedicated this practice to myself most of all. you can&#39;t love anyone else with your whole heart until you love yourself, right? this flow made me realize that taking care of myself by maintaining a near-daily yoga practice is an act of love. thank you for the catharsis and for helping me open my heart, adriene 💗",charlie rose,2020-04-28T18:27:46Z,1

"This practice had me sweating bullets, but it&#39;s also unseasonably warm right now for April on the west coast.

"Bonjour Adriene. J&#39;ai suivi votre challenge des 30 jours de janvier 2020. Je trouve cette pratique quotidienne plutôt inintéressante en effet. Ce qui est dommage pour moi c&#39;est que mon anglais étant plus que limité j&#39;ai du mal a  pouvoir vraiment suivre tous vos mouvements . Ne pouvons nous pas trouver une solution pour autoriser une sous titrage ou un doublage en français pour ma part . J&#39;imagine que d&#39;autre personnes se retrouve dans la même situation et se trouve obliger d&#39;abandonné au bout d&#39;un moment. Merci à vous pour vos vidéo de grande qualité et pleine d&#39;humour.

And this yoga practice was a wonderful way to end it. Though I would like to do my yoga a little earlier in the day and get to bed a tad earlier ! 🥴 Benji is really so adorable ! Some nice stretches today, but a gentle practice nonetheless. Considering the time, good job ! Right, bedtime for me !! Thank you ! 🙏 Much 💖 love… deep blessings… ♥️🌟🤞🌹 PS. I love you, Mother Earth… or Great Rose, as I prefer to call her ☺️💜 PPS. Everyday when I look in the mirror after yoga (with Adriene), that is when I see the real beauty in me.

"Omg. Adriene. I just had to share as I feel so connected, inspired and in sync. I chose this video a bit at random today out of the kiss playlist knowing that whatever it would be would be just what was needed for me today. I didn’t read the description about Mother Earth or it being dedicated to mothers. <br />Anyway. I started my yoga journey with you after the birth of my first daughter, she brought me to yoga through pregnancy yoga and it has become my passion, along with my daughter it saved me from my own destructive behaviour and has united me with my true self. I thank you for being the vessel of yoga into my life during the days spent at home with a baby, sometimes feeling alone and overwhelmed. She has started school this week and today was very emotional for both her and I as she is a very sensitive little soul. I have recently started doing angel cards and last night I asked them for support in this situation and the card I received was Mother Earth, Gaia. The card thanked me for the work I have done as a mother which reminded me I have done an amazing job and we are both supported by the universe. When you mentioned Mother Earth at the end I felt so emotional, and then you also said you felt emotional. Sure these things could all be coincidental but to me it just seems like amazing reassurance that everything is good. Thank you for sharing this tool of connection.",Mishaela Daken,2020-02-07T00:58:43Z,0

I just want to start off by thanking you for taking your time to record yoga sessions and allowing everyone to have a free access to yoga. It is a great gift. I am most grateful for you and your videos and your benji. I also do yoga with my dog around and he likes to do similarly things that benji does. <br />I just want to give constructive criticism. I don&#39;t post this with the intention to hurt your feelings or anything and I apologize. I just wanted to tell you that while I often do love your silliness and your commentary there are times where its a hair too much. I find that it disturbs the flow of your beautiful poses and sometimes it is hard for me to zone you out because don&#39;t stop talking. this is also only my perspective!! others might not feel this way. others might absolutely love it. I just wanted to voice my opinion with in no way telling you this as something negative. Thank you again for posting your videos and doing what you do.,Linda cobas,2019-12-18T20:43:38Z,0

"I love how gentle your yoga is. I&#39;ve tried many different kinds of yoga before, and I find that fast-paced calorie burning yoga really frustrates me because it moves too fast for me to sink into a pose and transition between poses easily. I feel like I don&#39;t get as much out of it when it&#39;s fast paced. I love your videos because even the more &quot;fast paced &quot; ones that I&#39;ve done are still focused on gentle transitions, not pushing your body to a point where it hurts, and really developing self-love. It&#39;s exactly the type of yoga I love. thank you so much :)",laurenchantel14,2019-10-28T11:33:18Z,5

worked up quite a sweat with this one. i have to admit that there were times when I kind of cut things off for myself a little early--you were in lunge and i was like &quot;no mas&quot; and just moved through the runner&#39;s pose into a vinyasa. i&#39;m glad that you said that it was okay to move at our own pace in the beginning because it alleviated a lot of the guilt i might have felt in &quot;giving up&quot; too soon. <br /><br />it&#39;s funny that this is called rose yoga when i felt like i was making little hearts the entire time.,J.A.

"I wish I had gotten interested in yoga before my mom passed away. We always said we would someday go and take a yoga class together but unfortunately, we never did get the chance. And now, that&#39;s she&#39;s gone, well it&#39;s a strange thing, being suddenly motherless. Like, I can&#39;t help but think at times like this, something as simple as the lady on my YouTube yoga class I chose to do this morning, dedicating the practice to mother&#39;s, mother&#39;s day mother Earth, and all the other beautiful mother&#39;s enjoying this heart opener vid, well it just takes me right back to the day she died almost, that fear, that unknown, because my mom should be right here by my side or in the background guiding me so I don&#39;t fall. <br />But thank you for the heart opener &quot;Rose 🌹 flow&quot; twas beautiful &amp; any chance to think about my mom and let my mind play that dangerous &quot;what-if&quot; game I&#39;ll always take it !! <br />Blah rambling now geez 🧘",Kassandra Kron,2019-09-29T12:07:29Z,88

I made my peace with sobbing on the mat, and every time I practice I light a candle in honor of my mom so she is with me. It&#39;s helping me as I try to heal.

"I don&#39;t know how the feeds of the practices works, but it definitely follows a path that builds up. I started with &quot;Dedicate&quot;, then I finished the &quot;Yoga Camp&quot;. I came here thinking what now, and I saw the Rose Yoga. I thought it was going to be an easy little thing.  I love the suggestion to dedicate the practice to someone and I said it aloud: &quot; I dedicate this practice to my friend having triple pass surgery right now and to my son in recovery for one more day of sobriety&quot;. It was a beautiful practice, not so sweet and easy, but challenging and rewarding, like life itself.  And I am thankful for sticking to it. If this had been my first practice, I would be so disappointed in myself, but after 2 months I was in awe of myself for being able to do things that I never thought possible!!",Viviane Van Giesen,2019-07-05T12:58:20Z,0
Thank you adrien :) I&#39;ve started doing Yoga on a daily Basis last year in January it was a time when I was utterly destroyed and since then I have grown sooo much. other things were playing into that as well but your Videos gave me a daily Routine that I didnt have at that time. &lt;3,Zoey Stein,2019-07-04T09:56:32Z,0
"This was so frustrating for me :( All the things we did here I already knew and I felt so comfortable during them. But now.. it&#39;s been 4 months since my surgery, and after a long long break, I started to move again, and I still feel pain inside my belly whenever I stretch too much, so I can&#39;t really enjoy it, I have to be careful all the time and very mindful. I was so close to crying today (and it&#39;s only morning,and I know this would ruin my whole day, because I am like that) when Adriene said <b>**be sweet**</b> and then I got it! I hope I remember to have this sentence in my head and heart also after the video is over. My body is still healing, the smallest parts inside of me. And I just have to be more patient. <br />If you are still reading this comment and you feel like you already knew better and you have to go back, do not worry, I am with you, and it sucks yes, but now we have to be more mindful and even more sweet as we were before! 🌹<br />Namaste 💜",Bambooocha007,2019-07-04T06:39:01Z,1

"This was so much fun and really nice. I think its going to be my new favorite practice.

"Honestly I struggled greatly with this practice. Maybe it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t practiced yoga in so long, so my body and mind aren&#39;t used to slowing down. But I found myself getting so angry and wanting to cry as soon as my body started trembling. Or feeling like I wanted to hurry up and get it over with. I don&#39;t know why. I usually love doing yoga and especially your videos, but today I found it so hard to let go and just surrender to being in the moment of each pose: I just wanted to get out of them instead of breathing through it. I feel invigorated and it definitely made me sweat, but I also feel frustrated with myself that I couldn&#39;t just drop into it at all today. Maybe I needed a softer practice.. thank you anyway for always sending out such an uplifting and positive message in all your videos. &lt;3",Jacqueline K,2019-06-14T22:55:59Z,0

The week ahead is feeling overwhelming and sad for me.   I am moving to Colorado for three months while my husband (and his 80 year old father) ride their bicycles from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean.   This will be the first time in 30 years I have been away from him for a significant amount of time.   And I will also be leaving my granddaughter who has been over to stay at my house every week since she was born.   Doing the rose yoga this morning brought peace about all this.   It reminded me that my heart will always go ahead of me to guide and that the connection of love will always be present no matter how far away everyone is.

"It&#39;s been two years since I did my first Yoga With Adriene practice. I&#39;ve already read some comments of people that get emotional about it, but I have never felt like that until today. During that last bridge, I inhaled and I felt so emotional, so strong, and mostly - I was loving myself with kindness. I cried a little. However, at the and, when she rubbed her hands and said that it reminds her of her moms gesture I started crying for real.<br />These moments when we stop to feel ourselves, to love ourselves, and to remind the ones that love us are so rare, but they mean a world. I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about all of the times when my mom rubbed her hands to warm my feet, to warm my face. And I acknowledged my strength as we leave 800km away right now, and even though I get to see every three months, I am right now loving her as if she&#39;s warming me with her loving hands.<br />These yoga practices are a huge gift from her to us. But our practice is our best gift from us to ourselves. Thank you &lt;3",Isabel Britez,2019-05-18T23:49:05Z,4

"Adrienne, I discovered you right in the midst of a brutal, excruciating divorce.  I needed to find something that would help all of the emotional energy move through and out of my body, or I would be consumed by the pain and grief.  I continue to practice almost daily with your youtube videos.  Thank you so much.  I wanted to ask whether you could create a video for people with shoulder problems.  I have not one, but two, impinged (frozen) shoulders.  And am trying my best to modify.  But it would be so wonderful if you could put together something for those of us dealing with this particular limitation.  ps...it&#39;s very common in middle aged women, like myself.

I do yoga daily now, and it has impacted my life on so many levels. I suffer from eczema and severe chronic stress. I want to thank you Adrienne, because I think I found one the thing I like the most in life : self empowerment through yoga. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

My jaw dropped when I saw &quot;rose yoga&quot; today...I was craving one of your videos all day today and had just come from a spiritual store where I was trying to find rose essential oil (I couldn&#39;t). The idea of the rose has been speaking to my soul lately...today was an especially rough day emotionally and this practice was just what I needed. Thank you.",A McCarthy,2019-05-13T23:27:01Z,0

First yoga session in a couple of weeks after a horrible cold and lots of long journeys. It always amazes me how much better yoga makes me feel. I feel calmer and stronger and my dodgy back feels well stretched!

"I was going to do one of the sessions in Revolution (Opening) when I saw this new video. I dive into it right away. I like the way you called it Rose yoga, because when I was doing the pose where you open and close your arms while on lunge, I felt like the rose blooming ~ opening my heart to possibilities and experiences this day will offer. I dedicated my practice today to all the moms around the world, because being one is such a hard job. Sometimes, you can barely make time to stretch because we&#39;re too busy catching up with our errands and our kids&#39; schedule. But we gotta love ourselves too so we can be there for our kids, our family, so take time each day to nurture yourself. I read before that a rose is considered a symbol of balance. So, let&#39;s be like this beautiful flower, where we can maintain balance in our everyday life.  &lt;3",Myn La_Gasca,2019-05-13T18:18:45Z,0

"That was amazing. Just waht I needed to cleanse a mass of negative feelings I&#39;d been bilding uo for the last six month re a certification course I just took the final exam for yesterday. I thought when the class ended, the negative junk I was harboring would end with it, but was distressed to find out it was still swirling about my brain, heart and spirit, I always do you Sunday  posted  session, but didn&#39;t have time yesterday. Doing it this morning, I could palpably feel the tension seeping away and the bad feelings with it. I&#39;m now ready to move forward and pan for the nugets of knowledge I gleaned from the class with an open mind and heart filled with the love you gave me to exhale the neg. so there&#39;s room to inhale the pos.<br />Shanti, Shanti, Shanti",ericameadow,2019-05-13T15:06:00Z,0

"Thank you Adriene for this practice. I woke up this morning feeling lethargic, 5 hrs of sleep, work up at 615am drowsily to make take-away sandwich for my daughter and send her off to her school bus. Got back to bed at 715am, woken up with noise &amp; tried to sleep till 10am. Feeling lethargic. As my body feels cracked up and resentment to all the disruption of a much needed sleep and this sequence helps me to be mindful of my feelings and to change the energy. Your sequence helps a lot! It changes my energy flow! It is also well-paced for one to feel the sensations as my left QL is very tight. My knee hurts making me not able to stay long enough to enjoy the opening of my chest and groins.  Is it ok to disrupt the flow to use blankets to provide support for the knee? Would this improve as i progress with practice?",Esther,2019-05-13T04:49:05Z,0

"after 7 months of yoga with Adriene i tried another coach and it felt sooo weird without your guidance, no benji no adriene&#39;s songs no adriene&#39;s wisdoms, but you know what i felt like i know what i&#39;m doing cause you taught me everything literally, i hear your voice your laugh in every pose it feels like you&#39;re with me all the  time, i don&#39;t care about how i look in poses anymore, all i care about is how i feel and what does yoga give me and i learnt all that from you! i learnt how to except myself the way it is and how to find what feels good😄 you&#39;ve been with me all this time and i really don&#39;t know how to thank you for that, i&#39;m so lucky that i picked &quot;Day 1 Ease Into It - 30 days of yoga&quot; on 2018 October 9, i can&#39;t imagine my life without you, and without yoga!

"Thanks Adriene for the yoga I managed about the first 18 minutes before it became too painful on my hands and wrists, I have ME/CFS so just a little of this is a wonderful start getting back to yoga again, although I had to put a board on top of my bed as no floor space here at the moment! Best wishes and much love to you and Benji ❤️😘",Jacqueline Walters,2019-05-12T11:13:05Z,6
"Jacqueline Walters I just wrote a little blurb about modifications for troublesome wrists, but they may be a challenge for you yet. Remember it is always ok to go into Childs pose for a rest during yoga or even shavasana. <br />For my funky wrists, I place my hands into fists and put my weight through the first and second knuckles (never the pinky side as it leads to injuries). I learned this from a master years ago, and it was challenging then—I only lasted a few seconds before it was painful. Now I can keep up with the practice (with my modification) without trouble. Maybe try that, maybe take Childs pose, you do you the best you can do. The community with Adriene is so supportive and loving, we are just happy you could join us today!",Crystal Rose,2019-05-12T19:35:34Z,1

I must admit this year my practice has been very irregular and I&#39;m just starting to realise even more how much I need that time on the mat for myself.

"brace yourself for an emotional comment (sort of):<br /><br />today I woke up with the intention to do some of your older yoga routines but the I saw your newest upload and at first I was like &#39;what rose yoga? what the heck? that sounds so soft and way to feminine&#39; (me being an absolute tomboy with the occasional (once a year) outburst of girly-girly). but I was still curious so I decided to start the practice to see if I like it (I could stop it anytime I wanted, right?). 38 minutes later I was lying to the floor after an absolute perfectly balanced practice which made me feel so wonderful and loved. But I had some hard times during this practice, like I was trembling during bridge pose, you almost completely destroyed me when you said &#39;like you love yourself&#39; because as you said this I realized that I actually do love myself. and let it be said this is not something that comes easy for me to admit, I hated myself for so long that I almost couldn&#39;t believe my own thoughts. and as I am already completely off topic right now I can just as well tell you, Adriene, that you probably don&#39;t realize how much your yoga routines change others (my) life. and it almost feels not enough to only say thank you. so, if you ever struggle with purpose be sure that you at least changed my life for the better. not much, but for this I am beyond grateful.",꧁nevermind꧂,2019-05-12T07:58:49Z,797

"I honestly avoided this practice for the same reason. Not that I&#39;m a tomboy, I&#39;m pretty conventional in terms of femininity, but I am wary of the kind of yoga branding that&#39;s too simplistically inspirational, in a cheesy and gendered kind of way. But this practice was not only amazing for opening up and lightening, it also felt really strong. That stretch from the low lunge with lifting the foot up, holding it and leaning back was one of the best things I&#39;ve ever experienced. A little tough on my knees at first but I enjoyed it so much I didn&#39;t even want to stop to fold my mat for a knee rest. Adding this one to favourites &lt;3",Anushka Sen,2020-04-29T22:05:50Z,0
