"I decided to give a try to this 30 day journey and after a long and tired work week I was not feeling like doing it today, But I came anyway. And I am tired, and sore and crazy low levels of energy but I made it. And, for my surprise in the end, I had my eyes closed and bowed my head in the &#39;namaste&#39; moment, the end song started playing and I BURSTED INTO DANCING, LIKE A BALLERINA (I don&#39;t know how to dance). I have absolutly no idea why a did that, I&#39;ve never did that, but it was fun and I felt beautiful doing it (I had my eyes closed but felt beautiful). So I just wanted to share. <br />Thanks, Adriene for helping me feel beautiful today.",Bibiana Azevedo,2021-04-17T23:40:27Z,0

"Sharing a milestone...I first did the Home series at the beginning of the pandemic last year, mostly for my mental health. Your videos have been such a lifeline during these difficult times. I’ve done all of your 30 day challenges at this point and recently started again with Home. This video happens to be my session today...after having received my second Moderna vaccine yesterday. Woke up super-sore (yay, immune system!!) and this gentle practice was just the right thing. Sometimes the universe gives you exactly what you need ❤️ Many thanks 🙏🏽",Animal Medical Center of Charlottesville,2021-02-17T12:29:50Z,2

"Hi Adriene,<br />Just wanted to let you know this:<br /><br />I started this journey as a challenge to myself. As a &#39;come on, get off your ass, you don&#39;t even need to choose a video everyday cause they&#39;re handed to you on a silver platter&#39; kind of thing.<br /><br />In other words, I was going to &#39;force&#39; myself to pull through. Now on day 7 I realized that it has already started to become something I look forward to, am grateful for and enjoy.<br /><br />And the times just flies by so quickly with you, I notice myself really enjoying your humour and your spirit by now and talking to my tablet (aka you). It puts energy in my body and a smile on my face everyday and I am so grateful.<br /><br />Can&#39;t wait to keep it up tomorrow! Thank you so much for sharing this with us for free - I usually have such a hard time sticking to things but you make it easy. Namaste!",SingenStatt Atmen,2021-02-11T19:33:36Z,5

Not as much as the back and shoulders and I kind of need that even for the warrior posses. Maybe you are very stretchy there ... but maybe build in a few extra leg stretches into your routines just before lower body work.",mjferroni,2021-02-06T10:10:09Z,0

"Adrienne-This stretch practice was fantastic for me this morning.  I have low back pain and right hip pain which started at the beginning of February and it is now almost October!  Your various different practices are so easy to follow and find what works personally on any given day.  I especially likes the attention to breath and &quot;old school&quot; gym stretch (which I think you referred to it as), wide legs, arms stretched to opposite feet.  The number of those was really good.  The ballerina pose was a gauge for me.  I practice weekly and normally can reach a good stretch with a long hold.  I could not get there on the right side.  Love your sessions with uplifting beautiful plants, (Ive noticed how they have grown over time) AND of course the cute and loving Benji.  I always wonder do you go jogging with Benji just before filming?  He is so calm and seems to relish the relax and refresh as we all do.  THANK YOU",Brenda Courtney,2020-09-30T12:03:59Z,0

During the last part of the practice when we were inhaling and bringing our hands up to the sky I listened to my body and felt an energy in between my arms as I brought them up and then I felt it come to me as I brought my hands into my chest. On the last round I closed my eyes and I felt/saw a gold/yellow energy as I inhaled in and exhaled to bring it down it entered my chest and gave me an energetic feeling in my heart.<br /><br />Sorry if that didn&#39;t make sense, I don&#39;t know quite how to describe it but it was a super interesting experience!<br /><br />Thanks for sharing this journey with us!",George Roros,2020-06-05T16:45:00Z,61

Seeing colors when I would breathe, feeling vibrations through my body on OMM.  I would then tell the teacher and he would explain it to me. Those experiences would freak me out a little but I loved that they were not weird to him and I just started accepting them as they come!

"Hi Adriene &amp; everyone else who has found you. Thank you so much for these videos. As my weekly local lesson had to stop because of the lockdown I needed some other way of getting me on the mat. Now that my working day is also home based &amp; therefore computer based (I&#39;m a catering college teacher so used to walking around a LOT!) I find I need something to keep me relaxed both mentally &amp; physically but also keep the muscles toned. As an enthusiastic gardener with both my own garden and a large community garden my back often needs a little extra help as well. This was actually how I found you, looking for relief for lower back pain. I am now doing a daily session with you (no longer traveling to work gives me the extra time;-)!) and find it energizes and helps my back, am also maybe even starting to find I have some Abs;! So any way, thank you, if you have any special tips for gardeners or chef&#39;s or waiters I would love to be able to share them with my friends, colleagues and students.

"Almost didn’t do today. Been very busy for the past two days and have only slept an hour in total. So extremely tired, but I knew that even tho I was extremely exhausted I needed the practice to get in my own quiet space for those 25 minutes. It is now midnight and I am pleased that I didn’t skip. Starting this journey was the best decision I have made in LONG and I am actually showing up for myself. The only downside to this practice was that I couldn’t inhale deeply at all. It was like my lungs just couldn’t and because of how tired I am I yawned way too often lol. Plus, somehow in the middle of it all I forgot how to manually fix my posture and spine. It was like I couldn’t feel the part",Sebina Timm,2020-05-08T22:02:40Z,0

"It is interesting that you said “what if breath and spirit were the same thing?” because in Hebrew, they are the same word — “ruach.” And when you say it, the “ach” sounds like when you exhale in yoga (hard Ch like Chanukah.) So breath and spirit have always been linked since ancient times.",saveyak,2020-04-28T19:05:03Z,0
After yesterday’s session my muscles hurt and I didn’t want to do anything today.

"Day 7 completed today! I&#39;ve never really given yoga a thought. I&#39;m not much of a workout or exercise person. I started this 30 day journey to help keep me sane during this isolation. I must admit I am loving it, I look forward to my yoga time and I&#39;m always surprised when the session is over, feels like 5 minutes! You&#39;re awesome and so are these sessions. I&#39;m going to continue doing yoga forever now! Sending love to you hope you are keeping safe :)",Maxine Gale,2020-04-26T13:47:12Z,8

I really enjoyed Day 7 I did question whether I could continue on Day 6 with the boat pose as I wondered whether the poses would get increasingly too hard for me at this stage. Today felt so good and Adriene does create a feeling of light and is uplifting and funny she doesn&#39;t take herself too seriously which is a good lesson.

"Hello all! A little question: I have had back pain ever since an incident in high school, but have never really been able to pin point a specific problem. I also suffer from chronic migraines that only affect my right side, and seem to throb all the way from my shoulder up through my eye. I usually roll around on a tennis ball when it&#39;s really bothering me. Today, doing the alternating toe touches, I could really feel a sharp pain in my mid back around the bottom of my scapula; the pain felt close to the spine. I only felt it when I was bending to touch my right does, and it was on the right side of my back. Would that be a rib out of place, or something else?? Thanks!",megorain,2020-04-24T17:02:14Z,0

"Thank you for these videos, Miss Adorable Adriene! ❤️ The &#39;food for thought&#39; of breath being spirit is super interesting!! And, for any Christians out there, it&#39;s biblical too!  When the Hebrew scriptures uses the word &#39;spirit&#39; it is translated in English as &#39;breath&#39;!  The book of Genesis specifically records that when God created Adam and Eve, He created them in His image, meaning that He created them to be spiritually alive.  He breathed within them the &quot;breath of life&quot; and that is what gave them &#39;spirit&#39; or &#39;life.&#39;  In fact, the construction for those words “the breath of life” is the Nishmat chaim; which is a specific construction for the very Holy Spirit of God. (I learned that from a renowned Hebrew scholar.) 😃😁☺️",Mom For Freedom,2020-04-22T16:32:19Z,0

Morning Adriene this yoga is perfect for me to get back in my practice after I got vertigo at my gym doing yoga plus being Quartine.Sometimes I get to much heat going and I can feel myself start to get dizzy again so I have to be careful on so twists where my head is on the ground.

"Yesterday, i had a really rough go. I could barely get out of bed, my appetite was gone, and my depression was taking over. But I brought myself to the mat to do day 6. by the time I was half way through the session, I already felt so much better. Seriously, doing this for my mind and body has been great so far, and no matter how i show up on the mat, I always leave feeling better.

"2 and a half year ago I did the first 30 day yoga challenge on your channel. I started it because I wanted a &#39;better&#39; body and I fell in love with yoga and your teaching. After each session I would feel amazing and it really helped me pull myself together in a hard time in my life. However, at some point after that 30 days I fell out of my schedule of doing yoga everyday and I have been trying to get back into it. I know it is easier to take time to do yoga while I&#39;m inside the home all day because of the virus, but I hope when(if) this is all over, I can continue to practice daily. I always recommend everyone to start doing yoga if they want a positive change in their life, because I feel that yoga gives me the strength to do more.  Also, the balance practices are my favorite!

"The quarantine caused school to convert to online education. The instructors assigned overwhelming amounts of homework to make up for missed class time. The stress from having extra assignments, more deadlines, confining at home, and feeling purposeless has caused me to feel very depressed and fatigued. This morning, I woke up at 6AM to study for an exam tomorrow, and a sense of hopelessness overcame me. The exam was set to be 45 mins for 60 questions, when normally, we are allotted 1.5 hours for 60 questions. This was done so students cannot cheat, but it also leaves very little time to read and answer the questions thoroughly, thus adding to the already-overwhelming levels of stress. I did three videos in a row, day 5, 6, and 7. Adriene&#39;s voice was very soothing, constantly reminding me to breath and be myself. I cannot be perfect, I cannot meet everyone&#39;s expectation, it&#39;s okay if I don&#39;t do well on the exam that is worth 25% of the grade, I can do the class over again if I fail, it&#39;s not the end of the world, and I will be okay.

I got frustrated and broke down crying. The thing is, had I not been on this journey with you, Adriene, I would&#39;ve stopped and not done this practice today. Instead, I paused the video, sat down, closed my eyes and just breathed. After 5 minutes I got up and started over.

I had a pretty different experience to what I&#39;ve read in the comment tbh. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s uncommon but I know it&#39;s normally something people find in the physically harder videos. I was fully in the attitude to get zen and stretch as I started the practice but about 10 minutes in I found myself getting super frustrated. <br />I realized it was because the moves were less physically challenging so I was thinking more about my mental headspace rather than &#39;ow this really hurts. I hope she says we&#39;re moving into a new pose soon&#39; lol. And all that focus on mind just brought out all these negative feelings I reckon I was burying even from myself or at least from the forefront of my consciousness. <br />It was definitely a new sensation for me to be pushing through that mental distress (rather than the physical one we&#39;re usually in) to overcome it and not quit on the practice. Looking forward a lot to tomorrow&#39;s practice! Thank you Adriene x,robear12,2020-04-06T18:24:57Z,0

"I&#39;ve been practicing regularly for over 10 years now, and still yoga suprises me, it keeps me curious and open to whatever comes. No practice ever feels the same, and sometimes you&#39;ll find magic in the simplest pose, and it will feel as fresh and new as walking barefoot on grass after a long winter. Today as I did this star pose, I felt my body become fluid, and the breath gently rocking my upper body like a small boat on the ocean, as my arms reached up to the sun. It felt so sweet and unexpected it made me laugh.

Hi! Love your channel - you&#39;re an amazing (!) instructor! I wondered where your mat is from? I struggle to find just the right one (I find that my hands slip easily on the one I have),SØVIK,2020-03-24T21:03:47Z,0
"First of all, time really flew by! Second, I&#39;ve always struggled with keeping my balance standing on one foot. But today, when Adriene said &quot;Ground yourself through all four corners of the feet!&quot;, something shifted. I actually paid attention, really felt the ground and stopped swaying back and forth.<br />Can&#39;t wait for Day 8.",K M,2020-03-24T11:13:25Z,0

"I wonder if I can ask a question? I am late 30s, super inflexible (touching toes is a challenge and downward dog is almost a crouch!) -  I have a bump on my spine if you run your hand down it - I notice that when I do spinal rolls there is a kind of bump in the roll as - my lumbar spine to my hips - my spine doesn’t bend forward, so it is just straight while the rest of my back bends. I can do it nearly smoothly if I concentrate quite hard. Does anyone have any idea what this means or is? Is it common? <br />Could it relate to the bump (which an Alexander technique trainee told me once was an injury but which my mum a physio disagreed with and just said it’s just a difference in my back)? Is it learnt because I stick my bum out as a habit, connected to poor posture, so those muscles are tight? Thanks 🙏 to any who can answer!",Rachel N,2020-01-13T11:49:44Z,0

"fun fact: in Hungarian, the verb &quot;to breathe&quot; is &quot;lélegezni&quot;. However, originally it was spelled &quot;lélekezni&quot;, with a &quot;k&quot;. &quot;Lélek&quot; means soul, or spirit.

"And in swedish the noun &quot;breath&quot; is &quot;andedräkt&quot;. &quot;Ande&quot; means spirit or soul, and &quot;dräkt&quot; is an older word for shape. So the shape of the soul. Interesting that it means kind of the same in so many languages!",Terez Bergfeldt,2021-02-23T10:45:59Z,1

About 3 different places, none of which were upper back, cracked and released tension. I love it how by stretching one body part, the whole body adjusts and releases.

"This was kind of tough for me. I prefer more movement and flow and hate balances as i am so awful! I can barely stand on tiptoe without falling over - the joy of hyper mobile ankle joints. Really puts me of going to class as i always feel like i am the only one really wobbling all over the place! i did it though using the wall and chair when i needed to. I also have freakishly tight quads so the standing quad stretch is so painful for me. I did it though and this is probably the longest period i have ever gone doing something every day and starting to feel benefit. Abs sore from day 6 but in a good way.

"@ktglick Not so sure I agree. I have being following her for quite a while, and I found this video with way too much talk, almost not lecturing, but rather annoying, and taking away the focus on what was going on in my own body in moments of stillness. I don&#39;t mind her talking but this was too much.  I didn&#39;t manage to finish it and found someone else for today to take the yoga with.",Jallalla,2020-01-12T06:01:50Z,0
"esther it’s something that it may take a while to get used to, I think. Once you get used to the teacher and have practiced with them enough, you start to know their patterns and it makes it easier to keep focused on your own body and movement when they are talking about other things and not just giving pose/shape instructions.",ktglick,2020-01-12T02:14:34Z,0

"I started this 30 day challenge as part of a weight loss journey for 2020, and one thing I wanted to say about yoga: as an obese person, yoga makes me much more aware of my body, and my size and I really love that. When I do yoga and I compress myself or twist, if my body has changed or gotten smaller, even just a little, I can tell by how it feels in the pose and in yoga. No other exercise allows me to be this aware of my form and it helps motivate me on days when my belly gets in the way, and gives me a sense of accomplishment on days when I realize I can move more easily because my body is changing.

"Day 7 was particularly difficult for me. My arches are very high due to CMT muscular dystrophy and my calves weak, so balancing is difficult.  CMTers have a tendency to lose balance and fall, or trip over their own feet and fall. Hard to ground all 4 corners of the feet with high arches. I practiced  yoga when I was  younger and learned to balance. I am 61 and hope to do so again.

"First day I&#39;ve handled my time well enough to join in a practice BEFORE work! A MILESTONE!! Am joining in from Oakland, CA.<br /><br />With great respect for you, Adriene, I know many people do not realize the reality of the spirit and the soul, but since you emphasized both during the practice, I feel led to share that the &quot;spirit&quot; is the essence of the person; what makes YOU uniquely YOU and unduplicable, even if you are an identical twin. The &quot;soul&quot; is that eternal entity residing in each person that contains one&#39;s WILL. That WILL is either under the direction of the Lord GOD Almighty as He reveals Himself in the Bible or by default under the direction of satan. There is no in between. Each &quot;soul&quot; will be judged according to its walk here on earth in either deliberate and direct engagement with GOD according to HIS precepts, statutes and ways or by default remaining outside God&#39;s presence and guidance. Thus, I must push back on the notion of &quot;the soul or spirit or whatever you want to call it&quot;. Falling to this seduction leaves the person without knowledge of who they really are and how they fit into the overall plan for both the Earth and the universe.",The BLACKboard,2020-01-09T16:00:54Z,0

Around Thanksgiving I got the opportunity to start an employee yoga group before work hours. Twice a week, we get together and follow along with your videos. Sometimes it&#39;s a group of 6 or more, sometimes it&#39;s just me and another person. Either way it&#39;s nice to take the time together to recenter and take care of ourselves before we spend all day taking care of others. I&#39;ve tried to do the 30 days of yoga Journey in previous years and have never stuck with it.

I love your energy, the way you make me laugh from deep in my belly in the middle of practices when you say &#39;a-oh&#39;. I love how you can bring me to tears and then back through to a loving inner smile.

"I just got back home to the U.S. from visiting my family in the Netherlands. It&#39;s bittersweet as I consider both places to be my home. This yoga journey connected both homes for me as I have done every practice each day. Today I was joined by my ferret Chauncey. It used to be my birds, but since one of my beloved birds passed away, I haven&#39;t been able to bring myself to let the other three join me, as it was Bengeltje who was the one who prompted the rest to come down from their cage and scurry around my mat. Still, it was fun to see Chauncey wonder why my mat felt like all of his toys and watch him jump around with me as I did my practice. He is on the older side so he ended up crawling back up into his hammock about halfway through and now he is fast asleep.

"I loved, loved the stretch, but I need help in one thing: I have Chondromalacia (knee problems, under control but still kinda fragile) and I had a hairline fracture in both feet. At different times lmao The thing is, doing balance poses like this one sometimes hurts my feet and calf. What do ya&#39;ll recommend? Do I make the pose for shorter time or so I replace it??",PolliitoAle,2020-01-09T02:07:54Z,0

i live in Australia and was introduced to Yoga with Adrienne by a lady who gave me a neck massag. That was about 6 months ago now and I have been practicing daily since. i love feeling into how I feel and then choosing a practice that matches.. Yoga for stress or yoga for digestion etc!! I&#39;m really enjoying this 30 day practice.. I&#39;m noticing how my balance is gradually improving! Today while practicing I had this thought&#39; everything is energy&#39; while  I was focussing on moving the energy up the front and down the backbody as we did a couple of days ago I think. I really appreciate the in depth description of each movement which helps to know that you are getting the movemnt correct for the best use of breath and energy. Anyway.. just a little feedback and a big thankyou from Melbourne australia. :-),Jools Jeffery,2020-01-09T00:23:39Z,26

Day 7  done! Today I really needed the slow no ab use yoga as I got my period so yesterday&#39;s ab intensive video would have been even more difficult haha. I felt like today was both great and slightly disappointing for myself as I found myself losing my grip on my knees/ankles a few times so will have to look into ways to help avoid that going forward as I loved the ending dancer&#39;s pose even though I had to use an object to help balance when bending. I found such a great stretch in my right side body as that was the side I managed to do the full pose :D,Emily Gleeson,2020-01-08T23:56:37Z,0
"That was a good one today! Thank you for reminding us to do what our body tells us to do! :) I have a disability, I have to wear leg braces (AFOs) pretty much all the time. I don&#39;t have any muscles in my calfs and it is very nice and refreshing to hear you say &quot;use a wall to balance&quot; I always get frustrated with myself because I can&#39;t do a lot of poses like other people can, but I have to remind myself what you tell us, &quot;listen to your body&#39;.

"I so wanted to lie on my back to stretch it today, although the stretches felt good. I really loved the neck massages at the beginning. I&#39;m also always amazed at how (some) stretches can be so different when you put yoga into the mix - they&#39;re more &quot;precise&quot;, they&#39;re done slower and are very in-depth.  They tend to be a bit more difficult to do, or at least you feel all the muscles, all the tension, all the work that&#39;s being made to feel the stretch, not just physically. It&#39;s super weird. I hope I&#39;m not the only weirdo thinking that lmao. And I hope I am making sense.<br />(I had a big smile at the beginning of the practice, had some laughs and giggles too.

I think when this series closes I might do last year&#39;s &quot;30 Days&quot; series directly after and see how I feel. It would be nice to practice enough to become familiar with myself so I can stretch out on one leg feel secure.

"You should have seen my face when Adriene said thank you for day 7😂. I don&#39;t know when those 25 minutes passed. It was such a relaxing and pleasant training. I don&#39;t know how but since my period began 2 days ago, Adriene adds the right practices for &quot;the days&quot;. Like she knew or something 😂 I was worried that with my pains I wouldn&#39;t manage to exercise but she somehow knew 😂❤🤔 Thank you too for the today&#39;s meeting. I can&#39;t believe that I&#39;m still here. I am a quitter 😂😅but not this time. I felt so happy today when at one moment I was standing straight with my shoulders back, as they should be. For years now I have scoliosis and other problems with my back and I don&#39;t remember when was the last time that I caught myself standing straight without me thinking about doing so. But it happened today with you ❤❤❤ Thank you for all your effort and for being natural.",angelika angel,2020-01-08T21:22:36Z,0

Today’s practice was a little bit..... interesting. Started the practice and then my husband starts talking about clips for our blinds so I pause and go in to check what’s going on...come back to the mat and he then goes outside does another project comes back in and heads our sons bathroom to find out there’s something going on with the sink. Started to fix it when the line bursts with water all over....I pause again and run in with towels. Back to the mat flustered and kind of wanting to laugh.

Though yesterday was difficult for me I&#39;m back with a renewed sense of peace. I absolutely love the idea of respecting the breath and picturing the breath as spirit. With each conscious breath we respect our highest selves. We need not feed into our minds voice in an effort to do away with the perceived worry or struggle ws face when we are not holding tenderness with care. <br /><br />Thank you for yet another beautiful practice! This has been a solid reminder of the interconnected nature of being that I had been forgetting up until this point. Thank you for your loving attention and intention and for sharing it with everyone of us who are seeking greater change and inner peace as we surrender to the stillness and unfolding.

I learned how to time my breath with my workouts at the gym and at home a couple months ago and not only did it make a huge difference physically but mentally, emotionally and even spiritually has made such a difference. I have gotten so much results physically and also with my healing it gave me an extra push. 💕🙏",Andrea Leal-Velasco,2020-01-08T17:40:32Z,0

Finally a slower soothing practice that allowed my sore muscles to recuperate. The expansion I get from stretching feeling wonderful. I was a bit in my head when I started but now feel more focused and centered.I love balancing poses to get my focused and aligned. I also have anterior pelvic tilt so I work to hug my stomach in at the ribs and straighten up the right way.  I also like how Adriene mentioned to change your energy if you have a slippery mat. That is what I use to do with my old slippery mat. One must pay extra attention not to slide too much. I have a new mat now so it is all good.,Terence,2020-01-08T16:59:26Z,0

I also found myself holding onto the wall for balance as I have good balance but its a little wobbly these days for some reason.

"Phew, I rocked on my feet pretty much the entire time I did the foot in palm and kick. My balance is not great which I knew before even going into the practice, it’s part of the reason I want to do yoga to gain my flexibility and balance back. Also I couldn’t lift my palms together behind my back. It feels like my shoulders are so tight glued to my side that I can’t do it. The rotation behind is not good, I Sumer that continuous practice e will help free the muscles and loses them so I can actually lift my arms behind my back. You learn a lot about your bodies limitations during yoga, but you also learn where the possibilities are. I. Remain hopeful. Sorry if I seem to be sharing the negative I am experiencing.

"Adriene: Use a wall...Try not to be discouraged<br />Me: <b>Already using a wall</b><br />I love whenever she says &quot;Whatever this/that means to you&quot; because we are all coming from different beliefs and places in our lives. As a Christian, I&#39;ve read in the bible many times about how breath holds the spirit of life. So when she said: &quot;What if your breath was your spirit?&quot;, I was all for it lol. Yayy Day 7",Raven Brinkley,2020-01-08T15:49:39Z,216
Same here! I love the grace and kindness Adrienne holds! I am also of the Christian faith and I feel yoga practice has really strengthened my spirit/soul. Such a bonus for me that has changed everything  &lt;3 Thanks for sharing! Much love from NYC Xx,Cynthia A.,2020-03-30T21:11:56Z,1

"I love that you so frequently tell us to not be afraid to take up space. I recently have been telling myself, &quot;Stop making yourself smaller to make other people more comfortable.&quot; I figuratively have demeaned myself and my accomplishments for years because I didn&#39;t want to seem &quot;better&quot; or &quot;haughty&quot; compared to others. I&#39;m a female doctor in a male-dominated field with years of intensive study and hard work behind me, and I used to flippantly say that the hard work was &#39;not a big deal&#39; or not really that big of an accomplishment when speaking to others. I&#39;m now trying to metaphorically take up more space by speaking proudly of myself and my work. Thank you for this more relaxing full-body practice and I look forward to day 8 with all of you!

"Have to share this little magical story with your team and the community. <br /><br />I asked my sweet non-yoga practicing Colombian husband if he wanted to join me for Day 5 the other day and he reluctantly agreed. We had many laughs during that practice, but afterwards he said he liked it and &#39;it was different.&quot;<br /><br />Then this morning to my surprise he ASKED me if he could join me again so we practiced Day 7 together in our living room with our 11 month old daughter next to us happily playing. It was such a sweet magical memorable moment that I will never forget. I wish I had taken a photo, but I just smiled and soaked it in. His job is pretty physical and afterwards over breakfast he said, &quot;it&#39;&#39;s really nice to move my body in a different way than I normally do. Even though it&#39;s hard sometimes and I can&#39;t hold all the positions for very long it feels good and it will take time for my body to get used to it, but I like it.&quot; ❤️✌🏼",Emily Sweeney,2020-01-08T15:01:00Z,0

"Every year I try to accomplish your start of year practice. Some years I am able to, some I am not. <br /><br />This year my chronic illness and I have come to an understanding so far and I have made it through this week! <br /><br />No matter what I practice yoga every day that I am able to get out of bed, it is often with you and I want you to know that you have yoga out there for everyone! <br /><br />Before becoming ill I was very advanced in my practice and you have space for that but after my illness, you provided plenty of videos that I could not only follow along with but find humor and another Texas girl who also dealt with an injury of her own. I&#39;d often wake up Sunday morning to a video and think &quot;this is exactly what I need today!&quot;. <br /><br />This is all to say that through the years you, your team, and the community have always been there for me as a go-to on YouTube, and I thank you so much for providing these gorgeous free videos along with your personality to everyone who needs a bit of get-up and go!<br /> <br />Hoped to be at Red Rocks this summer but missed the event due to illness, hopefully, another opportunity will present itself soon to share in this awesome community IRL! <br /><br />May this year bring you and the community ever more blessings and happiness!",Rancor OhFour,2020-01-08T14:59:15Z,0

I didn&#39;t realize it until I wasn&#39;t doing it... On previous days I was watching the time bar at the bottom of the youtube video to see how many minutes I had left. Today I was surprised when we finished the session. I realized I was not watching that time bar today. It felt better to tune out of that. This session also felt great after the deep intensity and challenge yesterday.,feraldoom,2020-01-08T12:12:24Z,0

"Good morning every One. <br />I&#39;m not gonna lie: I 100% did NOT want to practice today. And so this was a hard one for me, mentally. Still, being on the mat with Adriene is good. The singing and the bits of kidding around bring joy.  And to be fair, I felt a lot tired and a little weepy before I began.  <br />Le sigh. Glad I did it.

It’s been amazing, but I need to say something and I don’t know how to say it, because I don’t want to sound bad, but sometimes I feel I get lost on the movements because there are times when you start talking and kinda feel the times passes without any workout, I love the videos when you get right away with the excersice and while we are moving you explain, don’t like when I feel I’m waiting to start, and it’s been 13 min out of 25 and we have done 2/3 excersices.",marione fiszman,2020-01-08T09:40:30Z,0

"Ohh yes!! I can still feel my abs from yesterday&#39;s practice so I figured why not give everything a break and get stretching instead. My calves are the worst when it comes to tightness, and the most stubborn as well. Looking forward to growing at least an inch taller after this practice. My body and I thank you, Adriene for this delicious treat of a practice after a major butt-kicking yesterday. Enjoy the ride everybody. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2020-01-08T06:14:05Z,89
