"For me, one of the biggest signs of growth from daily yoga is that now when I inevitably sometimes fall out of a balance pose, I find myself laughing and rejoining rather than getting frustrated. The biggest changes are internal! I have been practicing with your videos for 5 years now and my inner dialogue is radically more kind and gracious than it was when I began. Thank you Adriene.",Brittany Whitlock,2021-03-07T20:10:11Z,0

"I didn&#39;t plan it out, but my journey Home will end tomorrow on Christmas eve. This is a hard one for me. I know for us all. Among other things to grieve, this will be my first Christmas without my beloved Sadie, my cat that I&#39;d had for almost all of my 19 years of life, my best friend. Thank you for walking me through this darkness, Adriene. It seems so appropriate that I am ending this journey right after the solstice. Walking into the light. Holding onto Hope. Things will get brighter. And right around the corner will be Breath. I&#39;m looking forward to practicing live with you all in January. Namaste, Friends. I love you, Adriene. I love you all. Love and Light. We can make it. To anyone who feels lost, keep going. You can never be lost. I promise you. You are whole as you are. You are here. Divine. It&#39;s gonna get brighter. The sun surely rises everyday. Even behind storm clouds. It&#39;s still there. For you.",Kat Abrams,2020-12-23T22:01:09Z,3

"Thank you so much Adrienne, these last 29 days have been incredible. This is my first time sticking to a yoga programme. I hurt my lower back in the gym and its forced me to be less intense with myself. Coming to the mat everyday has helped me take care of myself, learn to breathe better and set an intention for the day. I’ve loved every moment. I am going to do another 30 day playlist after this one ❤️",Sam Omokan,2020-12-08T10:38:39Z,1

I just need to say THANK YOU for this 30 day practice. It has been my favorite one of all of them. I didn&#39;t get to do it until October due to some major things going on in my life this year (death of my mom/not getting to start new job in another country due to COVID/having to move in with my Dad due to everything/major depression) and I&#39;ve now finished it for the second time and plan to do it again in December. The start of 2020 was tough but it is ending with some major positives in my life and this 30 day journey has been a huge part of that. Thank you so very much!,Ali Crain,2020-11-29T15:31:57Z,1

"I found today really hard, I think I brought a lot with me onto the mat that was hard to let go. I fell out of half moon despite usually finding the balances easy and the flexibility challenges a nightmare- and was so frustrated. I couldn&#39;t keep up with the boat poses to the end and started crying- for the first time ever from yoga frustration but I carried on to the end. Some days are harder than others and looking through all the lovely commends I see I&#39;m so not alone and we all struggle at certain points. Guess it just hit me hard today but it&#39;s okay. Tomorrow is a new day and onto the next after that, beyond this challenge. Thank you Adriene.",H,2020-06-22T22:53:19Z,3

I’ve been like a robot all morning, doing things but not really wanting to, not really feeling. But with those words, I belly laughed right out of boat pose. And I made it fashion.

I felt weak and and broken not to mention angry and frustrated at not being able to push myself. But I feel over come with emotion realising here I am on day 29! Your gentle and loving approach has made me see loving yourself is key to recovery and building strength. Real strength comes from loving not pushing.

Us doing these yoga practices really are acts of self-love. In the past, I would beat myself up during exercise because I wasn&#39;t doing as well as others or because I wasn&#39;t where I wanted to be, but now I&#39;m learning to instead appreciate the fact that I&#39;m taking this time for myself and that I&#39;m trying my best.

The one move that I cannot bring myself to do or improved at all  is coming into a lunge from the downward dog position in one step......I have to help my leg with my hand every time .

"I have been loving my every day yoga with Adriene. But I know I&#39;m still really out of shape and I can&#39;t move from positions very fast. So this one I felt was very challenging for me. I felt like I was two positions behind the whole way through, and didn&#39;t really get to enjoy the movements as much as I wanted to because I felt slightly rushed. For example, I can&#39;t step forward from downward facing dog. I have to drop to my knees and then pull one leg forward. By the time I&#39;m getting there, we&#39;re already standing and moving onto something else. So there&#39;s stuff in between I&#39;m actually missing or skipping entirely. Or when we&#39;re in a low lunge and doing warrior one, I can&#39;t always stay up like that so I have to drop to my knee and create modifications for certain moves, which takes time. Or something as simple as reaching for my foot or calf and stretching out, I have to use a strap, so I&#39;m having to get that all set up, stretch for maybe a few seconds and we&#39;re already moving on already. Again, this is my body and such and I know it&#39;s my issue. But I just wanted to make sure I provided some feedback!! I know I need to be patient with myself but I also feel myself getting frustrated with myself also. Does that make sense? Eh. What a day. Thank you, Adriene, for creating a safe place for all of us. &lt;3",_tararoot,2020-04-30T02:52:59Z,0

"What an interesting practice today! I felt so immersed at certain points today, and particularly felt my body working as I attempted half-moon. Cultivated some heat, kept with the breath, felt so GOOD. Then, I attempted boat pose and was like woah! I think I can do it! And I did one, but then pulled something attempting it a second time. It was a bit frustrating, like, &quot;Really? I put in 100% to try this movement and feel pain?&quot; But I realize that happens off the mat too! Sometimes we can&#39;t control the outcomes, but we can foster our responses to those outcomes. So I just kept breathing, and finished out the practice, and the pain is no longer there. I am so looking forward to tomorrow, and hope to continue to do yoga with you all. &lt;3",musicsummer12,2020-04-28T17:01:15Z,0

"Today I think I started to hear my inner teacher, normally in my everyday actions I would always try to choose the difficult option cause I thought it was a way for me to not be weak. But today I understood that being strong is also listening to our little voice inside guiding us to what feels good for us now, and I think that can make me grow more than fighting myself. Thank you Adriene for being my guide, thank you the community for holding my hand 💛 Namaste ✨",Fanny J,2020-04-25T10:28:17Z,28

"Y&#39;all, I&#39;m just feeling so good today. I started this 30 day yoga journey after getting furloughed from my job due to COVID-19 and after taking a yogic hiatus for about 2 years. At the beginning of this 30 days, I was tight and majorly lacking in strength and I was feeling so doubtful of myself. Yet, I persisted, and today I managed high boat to low boat for the first time ever AND got my first ever full chaturanga. I&#39;m planning on going straight into another 30 day challenge and I could not be more excited. If I could accomplish all that in just a month, imagine what can be done in two. I&#39;m so grateful to Adriene for providing such a safe, positive, and encouraging space to explore. From the bottom of my heart, thank you &lt;3",rebeccakathleenmusic,2020-04-20T22:51:54Z,81

"Thank you so much for this series, I am truly forever grateful for this journey! 💖 Yoga has been my absolute favorite tool to help me find myself again! With simple small goals, of just showing up on the mat, I am helping myself get back on track. I am going to be where I want to be by the end of the year and I want everyone to know!! (No matter how vague I was!! 😅)) Anyway, thank you Adriene so much for what you have done for this community and thank you everyone in this community ❤️ I honestly love you all, you all give me hope and happiness and make me want to strive for the best version of my self. Thank you 💖 Namaste 💖✌️",RayAnne Marie,2020-02-20T02:53:22Z,0

"I am about a week behind on this journey but still been loving every minute. I haven’t practiced in three days and today I knew I needed this time for myself. It was difficult for me to find my breath and I felt frustration and resistance to letting my intuition speak. I kept feeling angry at myself for not finding the poses but towards the end Adriene you led me back to home. I thanked myself for even getting on the mat during this time, my busiest semester yet. I’m going to keep trying to show up for myself daily, and I know it will be worth it. Thank you Adriene, I cant wait for day 30 tomorrow",Allyson Hyndman,2020-02-07T02:13:17Z,1

"These have been so magical, and even as I&#39;m finishing the challenge &quot;late&quot;, they are perfectly timed for the energetic space in my life. I started crying way earlier than later [feld like shedding, happines] , as I was cradling my head. 🤷‍♀️ It dissipated pretty quickly as I dropped into what was a truly transformation practice. I wrote moments before this that I was learning to date myself again. Listening to my needs and follow my own path. Trusting that path. &quot;Dont decide where it ends&quot; WHOAH. Let it ride, let it go, let it be. SURRENDERING feels so much better. So many beautiful nuggets in here. Always &quot;finding what feels good&quot;, ah. And FASHION!!! Did I hear that right?!!!

"Boat pose crunches = instant disengagement. Both times they&#39;ve come up in this course, I&#39;ve felt immediately alienated, and it&#39;s taken many days to come back to not having a &quot;yeah right&quot; attitude to the whole thing. (It took me most of day 6 to stop feeling physically ill from attempting them, so this time, I just switched off instead). I feel exercises like that forget the whole &quot;teacher staying in touch with beginner&#39;s mind&quot; thing. This course has felt more like an advanced core fitness class with yoga on top rather than the inclusive style of yoga I&#39;ve previously experienced from Adriene. It reminds me of every other yoga class that I&#39;ve left feeling, &quot;well I guess yoga just isn&#39;t something I can do&quot;.

"Today, a very overwhelming day, it was very difficult to show up on the mat. I felt like giving up. Then I realized that I had practiced everyday for the past 28 days! I couldnt believe it. I finally got my mat out and started the sequence. Halfway through, I was crying from emotions so I curled up in child&#39;s pose and focused on my breathing for the remainder of the practice. I was really hard on myself at first, and mad that I couldnt stick with the routine. But then I decided to be kind to myself, and breath lots of love in and out. I have come so far on this journey. Thank you Adriene, for helping me to be kind and patient with myself. And helping me to realize that some days will not be great, but the power of mindfulness can help guide me through any situation. I am so very grateful to be along for this ride with the wonderful YWA community. Remember that kindness, to ourselves and others, can change the world.

This series taught me about discipline and showing up everyday. I&#39;ve really enjoyed it all even through the tougher core exercises. A big thank you!

"So, the last &quot;normal one&quot; of these 30 days... I always cry on day 30, so that&#39;s going to happen tomorrow I guess. Today was great, although I was in my head a little bit. But as with all the other days, it was great to be on my mat and I feel like something has changed in my body over the past 4ish weeks. I felt more strength in my body today than at the start of the month, while also being mindful of, but not frustrated with, my limitations. I kept wondering during the practice how much 6 inches was though from that half moon pose (and yes, I looked it up afterwards and it&#39;s about 15 cm apparently).",Eline Castelijns,2020-01-30T22:14:26Z,0

I don&#39;t want that journey to end just yet. I&#39;m not home. Not yet. I&#39;m only just getting back to a sense of home and I need more.

"Oh, I enjoyed that freestyle at the beginning! I got to do what I needed to do. I was in line with my intuition as I listened to it to treat my body. The warrior pose bit was hard but I really loved the boat pose(s) one(s), especially with our own twists, that was funny!

"Now, that the 30 days are coming to an end, I would like to ask something that has been on my mind the whole time. Actually, I have 2 questions: 1. Are most of the people on this journey yoga-newbies? 2. Are most of them young, for me that is in their 20s or 30s. I am curious about that because stepping on the mat every day was never an issue for me, but then I have been practicing yoga regularly for about 12 years now and I can really acppreciate the benefits of a daily practice . But it took me time to get there, approx. 2 years. So I have good news for you: stick to a little bit of yoga every day and soon it will be like brushing your teeth. ;-) The second question is because I myself have turned 60 last december and I just would like to know if I am surrounded by young people only here or if there are others that, like me, are older. You can do yoga for a long time but with Adriene&#39;s loving guidance you can always learn something new. These last 29 days really were like coming home for me.  With love to you all.",Angela from Austria,2020-01-30T16:03:31Z,0

"Day 29:Intuit. Adriene! This was such a good practice. I fell so many times during the half-moon sequence. But, I kept getting back up. And the boat sequence definitely has become a favourite. I think we have done the boat 3-4 times during this journey and it was different every time, stronger with every repetition. Thank you so much, Adriene, for this practice. I am grateful.

"I found day 29 uncomfortable in the beginning. My mind was saying, &quot;no, Adriene,, lead me. I&#39;m not ready to make my own decisions on the mat.&quot; But, by crescent I was relaxed. I was unsure what she was actually doing, but I knew my legs were correct and I had integrity in my neck. When I would try to raise an arm I felt the extended leg lose its momentum of pushing against the wall and a slight  collapsing in the standing leg. &quot;I&quot; decided to keep my legs strong and my neck long. I will rewatch the video after work. I will watch the teacher and learn from a comfortable seated position. Maybe next time I will master more pieces of the pose or maybe I will again rewatch later. I intuitively kept the integrity for my best me. Thank you Adriene and Kula. This is a beginning not an ending. Nmaste`",kristi shore,2020-01-30T13:18:16Z,1

<b>Home - Day 29 :</b> Late morning<br />I had* to do today&#39;s practice earlier than usual cause I had a very difficult morning and needed to wind out the stress. <br />I don&#39;t know how well or how bad I did on today&#39;s exam but I figured there&#39;s no need to keep thinking about it now. So I&#39;m actively trying to lift my mood. <br />It might be one of those days today... A &quot;Learning Day&quot; a &quot;Day full of lessons&quot; where everything seems to go against you....
