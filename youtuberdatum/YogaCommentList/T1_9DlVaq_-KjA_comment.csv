I just need to brag a little...I have not been a fan of core practices...every time we start them I get irritated...but today I took the grow piece to heart and I did the whole thing and I am just so proud of myself and what I accomplished today. Each little growth moment leads to a stronger sense of who I am and what I can accomplish and I am thankful for this!,Debra Schooley,2021-02-16T11:20:21Z,1

"No matter what I do, I can&#39;t seem to target my abs! Whenever I do any kind of reclined core work, like boat pose, crunches, Russian twist, windshield wipers, etc, I find myself using the muscles in my hips/hip flexors, not my abs. What am I doing wrong?  Any advice? :(",Julia Taylor,2021-01-28T05:00:54Z,0
I just thought I’d share that I have a hard time doing boat twists! My solution so far has been to separate the two regions ( doing legs and then twists )! The thought is that maybe eventually will be able to do this move! Love all other moves but that is a real challenge for me!,Marguerite Losinski,2021-01-17T17:17:13Z,1
"Not doing it day by day, more like going through the whole library to see what I might feel like doing. However, i keep circling back to the 30 day home challenge videos.

"Hello from the future-past. I am participating in the November 2020 Root to Rise monthly challenge and today is Day 13, where I&#39;m supposed to be doing a 45m yoga practice. Just not feeling that today, so I decided to take a peek at my other options and landed on this day 13 of another challenge. <br /><br />This is an excellent practice. Gentle and tough at the same time, I really loved doing that practice and the way that I feel right now after doing it. <br /><br />Definitely want to echo the comment Adriene made about how quickly things can evolve. I&#39;m not even two weeks in (boy, how long some months seem to take in this year) and I genuinely feel stronger, in everyday life and in my yoga practice sessions. <br /><br />I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve been acknowledging this in my comments thus far, but if not, I just want to reiterate (it can&#39;t be said enough, honestly) how beautiful Adriene&#39;s technique as an instructor is. She pushes you to your limit while acknowledging and encouraging you to embrace your own current position, no matter where that is. I wish we could distill that element and give it directly to every teacher in the world. Thank you so much for your work Adriene.",Veronica Martinez,2020-11-14T02:03:13Z,1
"Day 13, done! I was actually wondering about my boat pose because it&#39;s always so uncomfortable... I did some research and realized that my hamstrings are really tight which makes my hip flexors cramp up almost immediately in boat pose, making it hard to remain on my sits bones without collapsing onto my tailbone (ouch). I finally understand why this position was a challenge for me, and now I&#39;m doing a super easy very of the boat pose which doesn&#39;t strain my hip flexors as much... Learning every day with this practice ♥︎ With each practice I improve...",Emily Beauchamp,2020-11-12T13:46:19Z,0

I have polycystic ovarian syndrome and I struggle a lot with my menstrual cycle, stress and a bunch of other things that pcos brings along. I have been practicing yoga since 3 years. Couldn&#39;t go for my class in the lockdown and that led me to you, and boy, you have given a whole new dimension to my practice. I have never practiced like this before, with intention. It&#39;s almost like you don&#39;t need to sit and meditate, these practices are meditative. ❤️ This journey means so much to me, made me realise how it&#39;s not always the advanced asanas that do the job. Lots of love to you. Thank you for being so kind, caring and supportive. ❤️❤️",Sukhman Khehra,2020-06-28T05:30:02Z,1

While I was doing this every day just to get this amazing feeling you get during shavasana in the end, throughout this time I watched my body and my life transform. Literally every part of my body changed: arm muscles, flexibility, I am even able to to sit straight while I`m meditating, which I thought was unachievable without exhausting workouts.

"I remember when I first started yoga at university, Adriene mentioned how much pets love the &quot;vibes&quot; during yoga. Today my cat joined me for the first time and my goodness was he a happy boy. He loved sprawling out on the mat (what a challenge some of those downward dogs were haha), purred loudly the whole time, and decided whenever he wanted rubs - no matter what crazy position I was in at the time! He even watched the video for a good few minutes. At first, I thought he must love the soothing sound of your voice, Adriene, but he then proceeded to attack the screen. 😂 You gotta love how quickly cats can go from zen to frisky.",Paper Cups and Paperbacks,2020-04-15T06:48:51Z,0

"Hi Adriene! I have been casually doing yoga for a number of years now, but never have I taken the time or had someone guide me through the basic practices such as starting movements from the core. I know I should be doing these in theory but haven&#39;t been committed enough to teach myself. This program so far has been wonderful to establish these practices and I&#39;ve been actively working on it even in my movements off the mat. Today when we were going through the motions and you reminded us to claw through the fingers and engage through the pelvic floor, I found in some cases I was already doing it, which to me is a breakthrough. Loving this course, thank you so much!",Katharina McCurdy,2020-04-06T05:36:46Z,1

"Hi, Adriene! <br />Let me begin by offering my sincerest thanks to you for creating this incredible at home yoga journey. I was diagnosed with a pretty nasty case of Lyme disease a couple of years ago and have been struggling ever since to find a form of exercise that my body could handle. Do you have any tips for people trying to do yoga while struggling with Lyme? Joint pain is one of my worst symptoms, so any type of repetitive motion is difficult for me. I had tried many yoga classes, but none did a good job of addressing modifications and ways to be kind to your body. Thank you for making this such a big part of your practice! The 30 Day Home practice is my favorite so far, as is the Wind Down practice. You are doing truly incredible work and I am sure I am not alone in offering my gratitude. I did have a couple of questions for you: <br /><br />-I have noticed my right shoulder is a bit sore, and I notice it the most when I get into down dog. Do you think it is an overextension problem? Do you hear people having similar trouble? I don&#39;t want to push it, but I am guessing it&#39;s just a matter of building the shoulder strength? <br />-Do you have any recommendations for long legs? I&#39;m finding that whenever I get into my low lunge and I am bracing my knee in the  crook of my armpit that I cannot fully plant my hands on the ground. I have long legs, so I am guessing there is no fix for this problem, unless you think I am doing the pose incorrectly? <br /><br />Thank you for everything, Adriene. Truly. Such an inspiration! <br />Emma",Emma Adler,2020-03-16T17:07:02Z,0

"Sometime this month (wish I could remember the exact day, but I didn’t start logging my yoga until June)  I celebrate a year with yoga . Thus, in celebration, I did some research and decided to get my very first private lesson in a studio close but far enough for a couple of days get away with my lover.  Though I’m looking forward to this, I feel like I’m cheating on you Adriene. I want a private lesson with you!lol.  However, I’ve practiced a couple of times with other you tubers but they shore ain’t my little Texan lady! I only did that because you make fun of yourself, when you go into your roots! It’s not so different from my own rural Southeast Missouri upbringing.  Matter of fact a native Floridian has a very distinct dialect, as well.  Anyway, I will always follow you, my lady. I don’t think I’ve mentioned it, but I’ve only missed a yoga practice when I’m injured, two days in a row , at most. I’m on day 14 of home.  I’m repeating the whole month and loving it!

Good news is the hip pain seems to have mostly cleared up, and having done one of the practices for hamstrings a few times I&#39;m also noticing real improvement on that front to :)",Paul Convery,2020-02-05T19:21:56Z,0

"&quot;Space to grow.&quot; I&#39;ve been scared of some space that I&#39;ll soon be getting. I&#39;ve been fearful of it, of what that space means, of what it could mean, and of what it will feel like (both good and bad). I&#39;m shaky, nervous, anxious.... fighting this overwhelming sensation of bugs crawling up my back to sit on my shoulders. With all of these negative feelings and emotions toward this space, I never thought of it as &quot;space to grow.&quot; Thank you for that cue. I&#39;m going to work to flip my perspective a d see this as a space to grow, to fill, the ability to fill it instead of seeing myself in my dark little corner of my world and the space being full of monstrosities that will crush me without someone else to keep them at bay. &quot;Space to grow.&quot;",Merissa Kelley,2020-01-29T17:32:26Z,1

"to travel<br />Good morning FWFG,<br /><br />I&#39;m only reaching out to you because I&#39;m pretty sure yoga is allowing me to predict, and I use any of this loosely, the future.<br /><br />It feels so strong in my head, but when I try to talk to the people in my life I get the most bazaar reactions.<br /><br />I feel like nobody can hear me now. Like I&#39;m in another world or demotion.<br /><br />There&#39;s times when it gets overwhelming.<br /><br />There&#39;s times when I&#39;m working on a project and a wave of emotions engulf me and I know that I shouldn&#39;t move forward with the project, or there&#39;s a hidden mistake.<br /><br />I work for people, so it&#39;s not like I can tell them that we shouldn&#39;t bid the building, because I have an overwhelming feeling of dread or mental pain.<br /><br />I see things in my environment that I relate directly to the thought running in my brain, or here myself say something out loud for no reason that resistance with what the tone of my thought stream was.<br /><br />There&#39;s times where it scares me and I wonder why it&#39;s happening to me. I also know I&#39;m not the only one.<br /><br />I&#39;ve had people come through my life that seemed like they could help me through, but it never felt like they were. They could only help me to understand what it was, and I&#39;m grateful for that.<br /><br />I&#39;m just trying to figure out a way to make it feel less aggressive. I understand surrender to an extent, and I&#39;m sure I have more to learn. <br /><br />I&#39;m pretty sure where the discomfort comes from is a control issue. I&#39;m used to running the show.<br /><br />I guess all I&#39;m trying to do is share with someone who I feel actually believes me, and I don&#39;t really have that. Well at least it doesn&#39;t feel that way.<br /><br />Really from the bottom of my heart I&#39;m grateful for you and your people and all that you-all&#39;s do. <br /><br />Sincerely yours,<br /><br />Eric wade",eric wade,2020-01-17T02:40:04Z,0

"My back has been pretty awful the past few days, so I had a difficult time with the boat pose twists. I was able to activate my core leaning back but once I was twisting I definitely noticed a lot of back pressure and stopped after a few. At first I was disappointed in myself for &quot;giving up&quot;. Then, I remembered all of the beautiful lessons Adriene has taught about honoring your body where it is today and felt like I succeeded in such a huge way by accepting that this pose was not beneficial to me today and allowing myself to rest. Thank you Adriene, not only for the physical practice but also for the mental and spiritual growth you give to us!",EJ2894,2020-01-16T15:13:23Z,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DlVaq_-KjA&amp;t=14m39s"">14:39</a> “You’d really be surprised how fast things evolve when you take time to show up on a regular basis.” Beginner yogis, I can’t tell you how true this is!! I started a daily yoga practice in June 2019. Before that I was completely sedentary, out of shape, weak, feeling awful all the time.<br /><br />Yoga gave me a chance to dedicate myself to moving my body for the first time in my life. And now, only 6 months later, the improvements are dramatic. I’m more toned, lifted, and muscular, but the spiritual and mental benefits matter even more than physical results. Adriene is one of the first instructors I discovered on my journey. she really got me feeling enthusiastic and comforted with any doubts or insecurities I had as a beginner. <br /><br />If the boat pose at the end killed you, don’t worry - practice as much as you can and soon, you’ll have enough core strength to tackle it!!<br /><br />Good luck to everyone and congratulations on starting to do yoga regularly 🥳",lucette5,2020-01-16T02:33:32Z,328

"Lucette, this completely relates to me, thank you!! I really needed to hear this. I am 25 years old and have gained a lot of weight over the years (I&#39;m at my highest weight and it is discouraging) and I am very very out of shape. I would have achey pain in my body that creeped up on me and I couldn&#39;t figure out how to start to fix it. I don&#39;t want to just lose weight, I want to become toned and strong mentally and physically. I heard of Adriene&#39;s videos through a friend and I decided to finally start to get my body in gear. No excuses! This is my first 30 day yoga journey and I could not be more excited to come to the mat every day. IT TOTALLY DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE DOING A LITTLE BIT EVERY DAY. I can&#39;t believe after 13 days how much stronger my body has become. I can feel each move getting a little bit easier and easier every day. It&#39;s amazing!! I am so thankful for this journey. And it&#39;s so great seeing everyone in this community all coming together and being there together. &lt;3",Kayleigh Ashworth,2020-05-14T00:58:58Z,10

"Good morning friends! 🙏 As yoga is helping me continue to get stronger, I&#39;ve been more proactive in my personal life and getting busier...which means I have to be even more mindful of what I do with my time. Whenever I take on too many things, I notice that I crash and burn, and often it&#39;s because I end up making certain things less of a priority (not consciously); I literally have to write down and start scheduling things that I normally just did because I had time--I now have to consciously makentime--oherwise I end up getting swept up into the arms of adventure. Haha. Fortunately, I&#39;ve been taking time to solidify the roots of my daily yoga practice, and at worst, I&#39;ll miss a day of practice that I make up the following day. A quote from Stephen Covey that often came to mind this week is the following: <br /><br />&quot;The most important thing is to keep the most important thing the most important thing.&quot; <br /><br />It&#39;s easy to love something if that&#39;s the only thing in your life...but that seems passive. I feel that love is active: that if you choose something despite many other things in your life that may also interest you or pull your attention, you pick it every time. And I always will choose you 🙏💜🕉️ Namaste.",Jay-Ram Rajendra,2020-01-15T16:53:39Z,0

"The previous practices really do add up, I came to the mat today with a sense of peace even tho I had little taughts of nervousness about the boat pose I did dwell on it at all and that sort of kept me so relax in my practice. I tell u don&#39;t get me wrong the boat with the twist kicked my but but i gave it my all and it was great, my hip bones felt it and that always happens with me my hip bones feel it when I am in boat, not all the time but most times, it thing it&#39;s when I am not activating my core enough I put the pressure on my legs and maybe that&#39;s why my hip bones feel it. The previous practices really made today&#39;s practices enjoyable and I thank you Adriene for each practice, much love to you and benji and everyone practicing with us, Namaste 💞💗💓💖❤🙏",Vanessa Morris,2020-01-15T01:37:56Z,0

Day 13 done! I found myself having a super anxious day and the yoga helped slightly. Amazing to feel the effects of even the modified poses because that boat pose had me completely engaging my abdomen even if I had my legs on the floor the entire time. Looking forward to my second attempt in a month to see if I go farther back or have my legs joining in with my upper body twisting,Emily Gleeson,2020-01-15T00:04:46Z,1

I was in the middle of last years 30 day yoga with you and became too sick to continue. It took me 8 months to fully heal from that flare and I felt like a pile of poo.  Starting this 30 day challenge with you was a great reset for my mind. You have no idea how your teaching and words help me.",Sarah Grossbier,2020-01-14T23:14:15Z,0
Woah I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m growing so much already. Thoes forward folds are getting better without actually pushing to get there. And today I managed to get my foot up into the lunges on either side which I normally  have to shuffle my foot up there. I don&#39;t want this to end. It&#39;s been transformative spiritually too.

Oof! Day 13 down and that was a toughie. I&#39;ve been showing up physically every day but today in particular I did not want to. After seeing it was only 18 minutes I decided that I might as well get it done and over with. This ended up being the most present I&#39;ve been mentally with this 30 days so far. I didn&#39;t judge myself for not getting the poses &quot;right&quot; or for my breath being shallow. I felt the love and joy and happiness and I found what felt good and that was to just smile the whole time. I&#39;m so grateful for the time and energy I get to put into this practice and for everyone in the community showing up with me ❤❤,WavyPiggy97,2020-01-14T22:03:06Z,0

"One of my favourite days so far. Not sure why because I’m so burnt out, but this really energised me. ‘Grow’ is so applicable because I went through this flow going “oh, wait! This is easier than it use to be, look how high my leg is going today, look how far my foot made it back into that lunge”. So exciting to feel and see some progress, some ‘growth’.

"I only started doing yoga last year, and I remember someone told me that, in time, I would come to love downward dog, and it would become a resting posture. At that moment I thought they were delusional: my hamstrings were extremely tight, my scoliosis made it super hard to press equally onto both sides of my body, and I found the posture exhausting! But this morning when I first checked the video I got so happy seeing it was included in today&#39;s practice! I have truly become a fan of downward dog, who would have thought?

"HELLO! back at it - with it being this little freewriting practice I&#39;ve cultivated alongside this YWA journey. the last comment I wrote was for &quot;Inquire&quot; - I&#39;m glad to find myself back here for this practice, since Adriene&#39;s words in the description suggest that Inquire -&gt; Growth represented a mini-arc within this 30-day journey. be curious as to what&#39;s happening within you; ground yourself in your own truth/reality; dig deeper to expand yourself; be kind by nurturing yourself along the way; and grow! <br /><br />I feel like I&#39;ve had some mini-breakthroughs in the past couple days, and I&#39;ve been sitting here for a bit, trying to wrangle it all together - but I find myself wrung-out-and-content, in that sort of way, after you&#39;ve done good things for yourself (exercised, showered, cooked) after a weekend of, hmm, less than optimal choices - so instead, I&#39;m just going to let it be and enjoy this moment and this feeling. may everyone here, by shining the light of consciousness within, grow -- and like sunshine on a plant, may that growth bud without force or maneuvering. &quot;the creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn.&quot; namaste! xo <br /><br />(cuz i&#39;m about to DIP, baby, dip!)",Grace Kim,2020-01-14T19:33:54Z,0

"had the house to myself for practice today, so i took my mat outside of my bedroom and sat with my 3 dogs and rabbit. a little harder to stay focused, but in downward dog I kept petting my rabbit with my feet and kissing her head whenever I came to forward fold as she nibbles on my mat. got some nice face licks from my pups when sitting and doing the core work. very nice encouragement. I’m falling in love with the daily practice as i feel myself grow mentally and physically stronger and more open, and I can’t wait to take it with me to college as the semester starts next week. thank you 💓",Isabela Dunlap,2020-01-14T19:18:48Z,0

"What a great way to start the day!  The wide stance where we put our head to the ground was fun.  It sort of felt like Jean Claude Van Damme in Bloodsport when he rises up, lol.  The Boat Pose was fun also.  I was leaning back, like yeah I got this.  Raising the legs up, and doing twists is where you got me.  I had fun doing those, and even did a little more to compensate for taking a little break.  Great video, and thank you for making these sessions for us!  Have a nice day! :)",Justin4life,2020-01-14T17:17:07Z,4

I liked these shorter videos in the middle of Home that are short but activating. This practice was great for waking me up. I love the challenging move at the end with our legs up. Reminds me of Yoga Tone which was one of my favorite videos when I starting out.

"Hi Adriene, I want to start by thanking you for being you and building this community and your amazing ability to reveal light in people they might not have even seen! I recently discovered that I have diastasis recti which happens to women and men but commonly to women after they have babies.  My abs have always domed up when doing most ab workouts but then I realized it was a big problem.  I have been doing yoga with you for 5-6 years and I trust you. Could you do a video on how to heal this?  There are resources online but again I trust you.  (P.S. if you can&#39;t or decide not to, you have still helped me, because I discovered this issue on my way HOME ❤) Thanks Adriene and Team",Cassandra A.,2020-01-14T16:38:49Z,0

"Dear Adriene,<br /><br />I just want to take a moment to thank you. On day 13 this journey already has changed my life so much. I did the practice this morning and yet now, during the day I keep wondering if I can still do the practice today. I look forward to it so much and if I do in the morning, I feel sad I already did it. On the other hand, I just love doing it in the morning because it‘s sets the tone for my day perfectly. I have been so much more relaxed and calm during the day and I can feel that I‘m getting stronger. I work a job where I have to be standing all day and normally I would get bad back pain in the evening but now I don‘t any more. Thank you so much, I will definitly keep this up and I‘m planning to do all your other 30 day challenges as well. <br /><br />Thank you from the bottom of my heart and greetings from Switzerland❤️",Drew the cat,2020-01-14T16:21:02Z,1

"I have a question that I&#39;m wondering if anyone can answer it, do you believe that yoga is sacreligious to Christian faith?<br /> I myself, am Christian.<br />I have been practicing yoga on and off for about a year.<br />however lately I&#39;ve been questioning if it&#39;s roots would affect my faith, even if i&#39;m practicing with prayer and God on my mind, is it still against God&#39;s word against doing everything with the intent of strenghtening your relationship with God and the Lord??<br />i can&#39;t seem to shake the feeling that it&#39;s worshipping something against my beliefs and i&#39;ve found more arguments against it rather than for it, however that may be due to keywords in my google searches.<br />to whoever is reading this, thank you, I&#39;m proud of you, and i wish you luck in your yoga journey.<br />God bless you all &lt;3",Vega Cassady,2020-01-14T15:01:03Z,0

"Day 13 and feeling pretty keen! I executed boat twist much better than the previous practices. Maybe because my pup&#39;s rump slightly supported mine on the right 🐶🐕 but I have definitely grown stronger on this journey. At 55 knee pain going down stairs has been a growing issue, but without thinking I ran down more than a dozen on Sunday!

"As I’m going along this journey, I’m learning about not only knowing when to go for the gold where needed, but also listening to my body and take it easy. I have a tendency to push myself in general to meet my edge, and sometimes I sacrifice myself in the process. Applying the lesson of listening to my body even in a yoga practice can help me with more self love.  <br /><br />This practice is particularly special for me on my birthday, Thanks Adriene for helping me kick it off right! 😊",Michelle,2020-01-14T12:52:51Z,0

I’ve always had tailbone pain when in boat position. I fold my mat up to cushion it. Today instead of the prayer position with hands I found support by placing my hands behind me when doing this work. I just have to be gentle so I don’t hurt my shoulders.

"Is it just me? I get very grumpy when I&#39;m trying to do difficult moves that challenge my lack of core muscles... and when Adriene starts meandering in the middle of the count and then says this is the last one and then gives us one more... I get mad and start swearing at her. Then I laugh. sometimes. Please tell me I&#39;m not the only one cursing Adriene when she gives us hard stuff to do. This is my second year of doing the 30-day challenge and it&#39;s been way harder this year, even though I do yoga almost every day anyway. I&#39;ve just been very bad-tempered about it.

"I remember many years ago when I tried doing a daily work out and I use to hate every single core thing I&#39;d do. Just absolutely moan and groan through every second of it begging for it to be over. But, this journey, man it&#39;s completely changed my mind. I get excited when I see a core pose on the videos thumbnail and really enjoy the shake and warmth of a good core engaging pose.

I want to point out, I&#39;m super glad all the practices have been 30 or less minutes, it makes it super available to busy schedules to adapt everyday :) I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll have longer practices later, but having at least these 2 full weeks of shorter ones to get used to do yoga everyday has been the best thing ever.

"I signed up for the challenge this year. And honestly every time I saw a video I was like. I can’t do it. Then yesterday I tried and did half the work out. Today I woke up and did the whole work out today!! I never knew how challenging yoga can be!! I can’t do the poses correctly yet. I probably wouldn’t have the confidence to do this in a studio. I am thankful You make these workouts on <a href=""http://here.you/"">here.you</a> make me feel even I can do this. Being over weight and all. Thank you so much!!❤️",carie A,2020-01-14T09:33:37Z,0

Such a wonderful lesson &lt;3 Btw I&#39;m using a Gaiam yoga mat and after coming out of the second warrior 2 the mat got damaged by the turning of my foot. I weigh 71kg and am fit as hell so I find this kind of weird. Anyone knows if yoga mats should withstand the turning of a foot?
