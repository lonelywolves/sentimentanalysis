"This is my second 30 day YWA challenge and I am loving it!  Prior to this, I had never practiced yoga. Adriene is the right kind of teacher for me - she keeps it real, challenging and fun! The Day 6- Core practice was rather intense and my core is burning,  but I was able to power through it and I feel accomplished. I am thoroughly enjoying the growth and daily commitment to better myself - mind and body. Namaste Global YWA community!",Joy D'Costa,2021-03-06T20:03:21Z,1

I don&#39;t know why, maybe I&#39;m getting stronger or it&#39;s this one particular practice, but usually when it comes to the boat pose I start to shake and feel frustrated. Now I embraced the shake and felt those energy vibrations all over my body, I didn&#39;t give up halfway and made it through!

It does feel so good to feel the strength in my core and finally starting to think positive on this area after twenty years of just negative thoughts and comments.

I certainly had to stop for a breath or two, but I got right back in. I actually felt proud of myself today. I didn’t look at my watch, didn’t beg for it to be over. I just accepted the burn as emerging growth, met myself where I am, did the best I could. I ended this practice in the best kind of tears.",Meagsnan,2020-05-28T04:42:09Z,4

Completing day 6 of &#39;dedicate&#39; has seriously made me understand the huge physical change I have under gone in the last month. Although this flow was hard, I could do it. Unlike the day 6 of &#39;home&#39;, where I gave up half way through, this time I pushed myself and I feel so good now I have done it.

"After my pregnancy and Caesarian I haven’t practiced yoga for a while. For the first time in three years I missed the 30-days. I’ve started the Dedicate series last week, 8 months after giving birth. Right away I remembered why I wanted to start yoga again. My head cleared and my body relaxed. Even without sleep, without proper me-time, with a baby on the mat, I breathed love in and love out. However, my wrists started to hurt real bad, so before today’s practice I watched and practiced the Yoga for wrist pain. Imagine my surprise when this video zoomed in on the wrists as well! It felt like it was meant to be. I’m here and I’m stronger than I thought I would be. I made it to the end of the practice and I’ve never been more grateful for my body and what it’s been through the past year(s). Thanks Adriene, for giving me back myself.

"I am so glad these videos are free. They are EXACTLY what I am looking for and help me stay on track through 30 days. Whenever I finish 30 days I always get stuck and end up getting off track. Its like finishing a book series and then not knowing what to read next... Thanks for keeping me on track, Adriene!!!<br />Also... Song about fire would be “Light the Fire” ... a hymn we sing at church. 🔥🌅💒",Summer Fleming,2019-10-18T16:31:02Z,0

"Wheeeew!<br /><br />This was a tough one but I&#39;m SO PROUD OF MYSELF! Core is my big struggle, I&#39;m very long of limb so my core despite being strong often struggles to keep up with the rest of me, but I did it! I got through this! So happy with myself &lt;3",Chronically Crafty,2019-10-11T22:14:25Z,1
"I don&#39;t do yoga often, but now that I am doing it, it sort of feels like the other ballet. You need to have balance in order for you to not fall over, and strength to take on the amazing and breath taking poses my body can actually accomplish. I love doing this challenge and finding muscles that have never been unlocked and strengthening muscles that have been dormant for a long while. Your way of counting down makes me laugh and want to do more, wanting to see what other silly things you come up with as we go along, and hoping that we don&#39;t drop baby Simba off the cliff.",Evie Thayne,2019-10-07T21:28:03Z,0

I had days where I&#39;d be crying during the session, but giving up on myself is something I refuse to do so I carried on with tears rolling down.

"Today was really hard.  I was feeling selfconscious about my body and the weight that I gained.  But my boyfriend encouraged me to do the practice and to keep practicing as it is the only way that I will become more healthy and fit.  So even though I felt really angry and mad at myself, I got my mat and sat down to start the practice.  And my boyfriend joined me for the first time. I feel so much better now, and I am glad that he got to experience the practice with me.  I am looking forward to tomorrow&#39;s practice and to living a happier and healthier life.",Michelle Janse van Rensburg,2019-09-25T18:40:26Z,0
"5th time on Day 6! yay! My struggles have been my wrist and my back, each day is different. Some days I can do with ease other days not so much.

"I just started doing this and I usually quit any exercise routine after a few days. So when I got terrible cramps this morning and I saw today’s video was dedicated to core almost skipped.

"This was pretty intense but I loved it so much! <br />What I realised, however, is that my shoulders always come up and I have to actively bring them down again. My neck also tenses and it&#39;s hard to keep it long. <br />Do you have any advice on how to keep an upright posture without also collapsing down again? It was better and there weere days when I didn&#39;t have to actively pull myself up but I automatically kept an upright posture and when I collapsed I automatically raised my crown of the head and the rest of my body.",BeyondTheBop,2019-08-08T22:18:46Z,0

"I’ve been doing these 30 day Yoga journeys on and off, always finding reasons to get distracted or demotivated and not making the time for myself. Today was the 6th day, and honestly the furthest I’ve gotten, and today was hard. I felt a little demotivated when I could barely do any of the moves. At the end when we were doing the one move I’m great at, lying on my side, I realized that the demotivation I felt was also just my body not being strong enough, and if I practiced Yoga more often, I would be able to come back to this video and get through it. Adriene, you inspire so much, not only Yoga for me, but as a person. The things you say resonates with me at all times during the day.

Sorry to resurrect an ancient thread. I&#39;m &quot;new&quot; and I just tried to do this. The other five days were wonderful but I had to take rest days between them due to chronic fatigue. I have staples all through my large intestine and a couple vertical scars from emergency surgeries plus a small hiatal hernia. It was all I could do to keep my feet up and just lie there breathing listening to you tell me I was doing great. I was in so much pain I was about to cry. <br />Is there a junior version of the core yoga for people with especially bad ab muscles? Is there something I ought to do to work my way up other than just lying there with my hands behind my head and my feet up but not able to crunch?,M Pezzulo,2019-07-05T05:21:33Z,1

In the past I would have shrugged 🤷‍♀️ and excused myself today because I had no mat with me. Not anymore! Thank you Adriene for being selfless enough to make this available to us for free. <br />I can’t afford to go to a yoga class, but the few I have been to made me feel lost and useless. You are so supportive of every person and their limits, celebrating our differences and encouraging us to keep going.

I really don&#39;t like it when she has crunches integrated in the yoga. Doing crunches is an outdated form of exercise. Now I&#39;m just waiting for that part to be over before i resume with the practice,ctrs,2019-05-30T04:03:07Z,0

Hi! That was killer especially after a week off! I didn&#39;t think I could do the extended leg and raise the shin off the floor on the other leg but I managed to do it for a little! Loved this workout! One visual I do to get my shoulder blades behind my heart (when laying down) is to do the western gunslinger pose (elbows bent finger guns pointed to ceiling) really gets my shoulder blades flat :D &lt;3,Jen Heckenbach,2019-05-28T18:21:23Z,1
@Azurae I will admit that I could do it easier on my one leg than the other so I touched the toe down of the extended leg to help get my shin up then put my foot back out and extended. Eventually I will get there on both sides :D,Jen Heckenbach,2019-05-30T02:26:53Z,0

"I have become so addicted to your channel. I tried to watch one other person’s yoga video as I was just curious what the format was. They were fantastic but I just didn’t connect the same way with myself during the practice- I turned it off after a few minutes and came back to yours! It was really interesting too- the comment section lacked all the personal stories, love, and kindness we see in your videos’ comment sections.

Oh my, there is a whole colony of muscles in my body that I haven&#39;t met yet!!  I don&#39;t even know how to communicate with them and it seems they want nothing at all to do with me!!

I realized that to truly build strength I had to give my body a day to recover. I really missed doing this in the morning - it threw my entire day off kilter.

"Today was hard, but I completed the whole thing and it made feel really good. In 2 weeks I&#39;ll turn 59, and about 15 years ago I was so sick with Lupus I was in bed unable to move. I quit the gym and started to do yoga by myself at home. But it got horribly boring and difficult to challenge myself. And I was lucky to find Yoga with Adriene! Today it was the first day I really felt challenged, but I learned a great lesson: keep your belly button close to your spine, keep your lower back close to the floor. This was such an amazing piece of knowledge. Adrienne, you inspire me to feel gratitude for the things that sometimes I took for granted. Now, I am always always grateful for being able to move my body, , my wonderful belly that carried three kids and could do the core yoga today, my wonderful boobs that nourished three babies, my whole wonderful body that enjoys yoga with wonderful Adrienne every morning. A million thanks!",Viviane Van Giesen,2019-03-08T20:11:43Z,0

"Day 6 in the books! This was for sure the most challenging day for me so far. My core has never burned (in a good way) the way it did today. The bit about how we are always trying to change and zip away our stomach hit home. I’ve wanted to love my core more and I always thought that meant I had to make it “better”, flatter, stronger. I had forgotten to love it for what it is and as it is because it is a vital piece of me. Thank you Adriene for being a constant reminder of patience and self love. I cannot thank you enough for this series - I started this journey thinking I didn’t like yoga and because of you I’ve come to understand yoga on a different and deeper level, making me a lover of yoga!",Chloe Colette,2019-03-06T14:06:23Z,0

"Thank you for another great class! A couple of things. I have been following the 30 day practice from day 1, which I am enjoying. One thing though - I haven&#39;t Heard you mention for people to breathe through the nose as I hear in all classes I go to - is there a reason?<br />And I have carpal tunnel syndrome, thanks to over doing it with handstands a couple of years ago, I was 50 at the time and it&#39;s really messed with my practice and I now find it difficult to stay in downward facing dog for more than 3 breaths or any wrist weight bearing postures. I like your instruction to &#39;claw the mat&#39; which I&#39;ve been mindfully doing all week, the great news is I haven&#39;t woken up once from tingling hands this week and my wrists actually seem to be managing okay. Fingers crossed that you&#39;re instruction is going to be the beginning of the end of my wrist problems. Thank you ❤️",Camilla B,2019-02-24T08:18:54Z,0

"When I first did day 6, I was crying from anger. I was soooo mad, I was swearing and hating you &quot;how do you think it is possible?&quot; and the only thing that made me through the day&#39;s practice was the thing, that I felt, I love you Adriene, and I trust you so much, that I could hold to this trust, that it&#39;s good to do this, if you tell me so. The only thing that led me through my hate and anger was love and trust. And you know, though it may sound strange, it is how love works. It holds all the paradoxes in an embrace of acceptence. So after the first time, I wrote it into my diary, to repeat it 2 weeks later. And this is my second time, I&#39;m here.  14 days later (doing everyday the yoga), it&#39;s still hard, but no anger and much much more strength. The only time, when tears were coming, when I released from one hard posture. It was tears from relief and gratitude for the ground to hold me. Quite a change, hm?! Thank you so much for doing it, for giving your shine and love for us. Much Love! &lt;3",charliecsiga,2019-02-23T09:17:49Z,0

"I’m here, way behind the pack but I got sick shortly after dedicate began in January, then I got sick again, then I fell on ice but I’ve now managed to do 6 days consecutively and it’s the most I’ve done for myself in months. I almost didn’t do it, today day 6 landed on a Sunday and it took everything I had to push play. I almost negotiated with myself to repeat day 4 which was so short and gentle but I didn’t. I got through day 6, I didn’t drop simba, and I’m ready for a nap now haha",Stephanie Sochan,2019-02-10T17:35:05Z,0
"this is by far the most difficult session. I couldn’t hold the poses. My belly was screaming. Although I couldn’t get everything right, I still did it and now, I feel great. Thanks a lot Adriene! 💕",jaebin,2019-02-10T15:42:42Z,0

"Wonderful comments about the wrists today Adriene. I broke my left wrist 3 year ago and have struggled with my yoga practise since. But I&#39;m loving your options in this series, I&#39;m giving loving attention and options to my wrist. The more I give them to do the more they&#39;re able to do. That left wrist is definitely getting stronger and more resilient. Thank you for your wise words.",Dianne Graham,2019-02-09T22:57:15Z,0

"Now I know that when we do poses and switch from one side of the body to the other side there are some differences, well this was really challenging for me to lift my right knee off the ground when the left leg was extended and had zero difficulty lifting my left knee off the ground when the right leg was extended. And I&#39;m glad to hear there&#39;s hope for my wrists as I always struggle with this. Sometimes I hold my self up with my fists or I just go down onto my elbows.",Stephanie Compton,2019-02-08T21:53:39Z,0

"I always hated core practice because my lower back gets so much pain and sometimes it cramps up, but today I followed your guidance and learned to protect my lower back. I was still shaking and wasn&#39;t able to get through most of the moves but I felt my muscles working and getting stronger. I hope with more practice I can get a stronger core to fix all my back problems that everyone in my family has. Thank you so much Adriene for all your great videos.",bbjessz,2019-02-07T13:14:27Z,1

Felt the burn! And I definitely relate to the weak wrists but it’s definitely listening to you body and knowing if it’s right or wrong. Favorite “Fire” song that comes to mind is “Fire Under Water - Girl Blue” must listen if you have time! Thank you for today’s session! Day 6 done!,Glenn Ballesteros,2019-02-07T02:01:14Z,0
"Day 6 on the books! When I saw it was core today, I was excited and fearful because my stomach area is so weak and sticks out. I couldn&#39;t do all the positions exactly, but continued and tried to keep up the best I could. The other challenge I experienced today was laying on my back, it feels stiff and sore and like I could not get flat, kinda like its full of inflammation or kinda like I have fat pockets back there and when I lay flat it squishes and I can&#39;t get flat. I continued with the lesson and the breathing helped me release and the rubbing of my stomach also helped. It was like I was releasing old ideas, thoughts, and build up of the stress out of my body and praising myself of what I was able to accomplish today.  I am 52, long time smoker, quit now 2 mos.and haven&#39;t exercised in a few years, plus I&#39;ve never done yoga before (My old idea about yoga is its too hard and I am not flexible enough, I am too out of shape to do it) these last 6 sessions have changed my thinking into Yes I can do this and so happy I found Adriene to teach me. I finished feeling confident and praising my body thanking it for staying strong for me when I haven&#39;t treated it with care in so long; ready to do more strengthing each day I practice my yoga. I feel as though the dedicate 30 days is building upon each day of strength and confidence. I&#39;ve never felt so good and want to keep working on strengthing my body until I found yoga with Adriene.",Gina Rogers-Santos,2019-02-06T19:23:53Z,2
"Just finished Day 6 and loving how I&#39;m feeling! You mentioned sharing our favorite song about fire...shameless plug, but I recently released a song called &quot;Friend of the Fire&quot;. <br /><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/track/34PTy3T1iZBMN7RJNHsniI?si=-X66Y8gjQjGiYKULNmXWFA"">https://open.spotify.com/track/34PTy3T1iZBMN7RJNHsniI?si=-X66Y8gjQjGiYKULNmXWFA</a><br /><br />This was a song I wrote about my battle with alcohol, which I kicked to the curb 5 1/2 years ago! It&#39;s things like music and yoga that keep me grounded, so I thank you for sharing your videos with us. The song is heavy in nature, but is grounded in belief and inspiration to change our lives for the better when things get tough. My only intent in sharing this is to hopefully reach someone else that needs that belief and inspiration in themselves. Thanks again for these great videos!",Kevin Horan,2019-02-06T19:06:36Z,0

"Love this!! I have done all of your core videos, and have most of them saved into playlists that i&#39;ve made on here. This was my absolute favorite. I loved the One-legged hovers on all fours(super techincal term). I also loved your random improvised air punches, I did them too and they made me feel like a strong warrior or a martial artist.. haha. I forget the other parts that I loved, because I did it yesterday. Definitely saving this one too so I can do it again and again. &lt;3 thank you",Natalie Eve,2019-02-06T05:06:04Z,0
"Hi Adrianne, thanks one more time I love your dedication for us :). Todays practice reminded and helped me to articulate into words some issues I would like to work with. When I do core work my shoulders ( on the back side kind of close to the neck) of tension and pain. I would like to know what can we do for upper body tension and pain in the back. Also, I feel my right big toe and ankle with lots of pain and tension because I injured 2 years ago trying to do a handstand and I lost the balance and came back strait into my right big toe. Since then my flexibility in the right feet and ankle are 70% less. I have been doing physical therapy but nothing helps me to be able, for instance, sit on my feet while I have the toes engage in the floor as you do in this Day 6. Any ideas? Merci!!!",Paula Cifuentes,2019-02-06T04:16:25Z,0

I love how she’s slowly helping us beginning yogis get a strong foundation before tackling any of the more intense poses. I’m so excited to complete the 30 days of yoga! Today’s core focus was rough but her comments really motivate and I actually got through the entire video, which is so shocking to me because I have a weak core. I feel stronger everyday. I’d definitely recommend beginning yogis to do the 30 days of yoga with Adriene, I’m going to be sad when the 30 days is over!.",Annie Jung,2019-01-28T01:31:47Z,0

I&#39;m a little behind everyone as I just recently found the dedicate series and made a decision to take care of me.  I practiced Bikrham yoga  for about a year and loved it but lost my way and have never really tried any other type of yoga.  So I am excited.<br />I made it through the first core day within my own edge but found at the end when I turned to the right ..laying on my side my right eye just started tearing and then I was crying for really no known reason..?? any suggestions as to why this may have happened...not sure if it was tears of pride of making it through my most challenging part of core (in bad shape)..or just unlocked overwhelming feelings..IDK  has this happened to anyone.  Its all good it was a sweet release but just interesting way my body responded.   Thank you for taking me on this journey with you Adriane.,Elizabeth Wilcox,2019-01-25T18:12:40Z,0
"Even if I can&#39;t make it to the mat every day, as soon as I do I feel so much better in my mind and body. Literally, that first moment when I hear you say &#39;just take a minute to connect with your breath&#39; or &#39;see how you&#39;re feeling today&#39; and all the anxiety and stress just melts away for however long the practice is. I&#39;ve been watching your videos for almost two years, never having done yoga before and suffering with anxiety for most of my life. You don&#39;t know me, but honestly you feel like an old friend, and I just wanted to say thank you for being there for all of us and sharing your knowledge and kindness. Hoping you&#39;re having a wonderful day wherever you are! Much love &lt;3",Caz9,2019-01-25T17:21:22Z,0

"By the way, I made it through this one on my second attempt (a couple weeks later). The first time I gave up partway through. This time i made it despite being interrupted by a german shepherd puppy pulling my hair, his paws under my head when I tried to lie down on the mat, and his loud barking that caused me to miss some of the instructions. Long story short it wasn’t perfect but I did it! 💪🏻💪🏻",Tasmanian Devil,2019-01-24T06:03:00Z,0

And laughed at &quot;that just happened!&quot;.<br />But the think I&#39;m most proud of is the softness with which I moved - particularly the release. I didn&#39;t rush.<br />And at the final Namaste tears appeared. Cleansing, I&#39;d say.<br />Adriene taught me well.",KSoloviev,2019-01-17T06:37:28Z,0

"Today was the first day where I could feel my control over my breath helping me get through something I would have normally had to stop and rest from. We were doing the crunches with our legs straight up and I was about to stop and rest because the fire in my abdominals was KILLER. But instead, I realized I had lost control of my breath, refocused my mind on that, and the fire was tolerable enough for me to finish without a break! I love seeing how much I progress everyday. Day 1, I was a little embarrassed that even sitting up nice and straight while cross-legged and activating my core was making me shake and feel a workout. But it has become so much easier.

Hi friends! I am just searching for some words of advice here. Construction has been going on at the back of my house for the last few months and it isn&#39;t going anywhere anytime soon (we&#39;re talking this continuing for the next 10-15 years - help!!). It has really started to get on my nerves when I am trying to chill and meditate or focus on myself and my yoga practise. The noise and constant beeping from 6 -6 every day is starting to get the better of me. Any advice for how to handle it when trying to focus on my &#39;me time&#39; or other ways to block it out?

"I&#39;ve paused the video to write this comment. Hopefully its helpful. Without sounding rude, sometimes I think there is too much talking in the videos.... We have done of the poses in previous days and they are explained repeatedly. I find it a bit disruptive to my energy. Sometimes the best teachers allow silence for you to find your own inner sound. It can leave me feeling more chaotic than peaceful during some of the videos because they are almost too noisy? I liked previous days because it was clear, there was pauses, there was more silence. The space between is where the learning happens. And sometimes silence is our best teacher.",Kit Radford,2019-01-13T08:07:22Z,0

"I missed all of this week&#39;s lessons on account of the flu, so this was the first lesson I came back to. I don&#39;t know if that infection that went through all of my body was the result of stress or some internal resistance as I never get sick. Either way, this lesson was a butt kicker. I&#39;m trying to do at least two more tonight to catch up.<br /><br />I quit on pretty much all of the sets of pulses, and I suspect I wasn&#39;t supporting myself properly for the poses. So we got one good diagnosis out of this: my core is in dire need of some attention and training.

"The &#39;baby pulses&#39; and short, sharp breaths really freaked out my dog – she was so worried about me! I spent a lot of the floor practice with a pooch laying on my torso 😂 I could have just said &#39;get off pup, I need to work on my abs&#39; but actually, it was so loving and fulfilling having her hug me and try and lick my face &#39;better&#39;, whilst I did the moves (well, a variation of them), that I just embraced it. I made it to the end; not necessarily with a tighter core but giggling and happy nonetheless. ☺️🐶🤷🏻‍♀️",Joanna Cranwell,2019-01-12T18:55:44Z,155

"Day 6  and there were probably about 4 different times during today’s session I had to remind myself that it’s okay to use the pause button, and to listen to my body and be patient with it. I finished today’s session feeling really proud of myself because when I didn’t feel like i really nailed some parts, I rewinded and tried again. <br /><br />It felt so good to take a moment and thank my body, (especially my belly) in this practice. We always tend to aestheticise our love for our body, which i suppose is fair because we all deserve to feel an appreciation for our bodies’ own beauty. But our bodies are so much more than beautiful! They do so much for us. Thank you for reminded me of that. One of my resolutions for the new year was to appreciate my body daily for the things it does for me, and to learn to tend to it like a garden. I’m so excited for the next 24 days!!",Izzie figueroa,2019-01-12T17:57:17Z,2

Whenever I tried to train my core, I felt all weak because I couldn&#39;t keep up with the speed or couldn&#39;t do certain exercises but today was different. Even though I still couldn&#39;t do all exercises due to horrible pain in the neck when I lift my head, instead of feeling my muscles working, I didn&#39;t beat myself up for it but instead was proud of had my core has done up to that point! I felt really happy with my stomach for being as strong as it was right now, a feeling I had never really had before.

"I wasn&#39;t going to comment at first but maybe someone else will see this and feel better because of it.<br />I couldn&#39;t get through most of this video without crying. I found it incredibly hard. I&#39;ve been doing yoga pretty regularly for about 3 years now and despite Adriene&#39;s loving words, I&#39;m still terrified of Day 6 and of core. I usually skip these videos altogether or don&#39;t even get halfway because I give up on myself.<br />Now I never cry on the mat. But halfway through there I was, crying because I couldn&#39;t do it and I didn&#39;t feel strong enough or brave enough etc. But I did it anyway. I had my moment, I kept the video going and I tried to pick back up where I could for as much as I could. And that&#39;s okay. And when I got to the end of the video I went and cried some more.<br />I realised then that I wasn&#39;t crying because I couldn&#39;t do it, I was crying because I made myself feel so worthless and bad about it. For too long, my first instinct has been to hate myself, to feel less than other people, than myself. So here&#39;s me not shying away from that and saying it&#39;s okay to feel bad and like you&#39;re doing it wrong. You&#39;re not. It&#39;s just part of figuring out how to love yourself.<br />So here&#39;s to you, and me, loving ourselves throughout. Namaste.",shanalah,2019-01-10T19:41:12Z,998

"@unboredhands hey just want you to know theres no need to beat yourself up over this.

If you don&#39;t feel up to this, I suggest getting into a restorative pose that works for you,like extended childs pose and focus on your breathing and some positive thoughts on what you CAN do/accomplish/control. It&#39;s okay to sit out a move, a session or a whole day. You have so much power! I hope you wont give up and try the next one tomorrow or when you feel up to it. Sending you lots of good vibes ♡",shanalah,2020-08-30T16:28:48Z,0
"Honestly this is one of the first videos I completely abandoned and made me rethink whether this was the right series for me. This was so discouraging (and I say this as someone that had done a large number of these videos.) This one wasn&#39;t for me and felt so out of place. It wasn&#39;t a &quot;challenge&quot; - it was impossible, it was pretty much just throwing pie in my face and laughing at me and calling me a fatass. If I had chosen to start with this series as an intro to yoga, if I encountered this on day 6, I would likely never do yoga again. As someone that is a little larger, I&#39;ve struggled so much my whole life doing &quot;physical&quot; things and was often reminded I was dragging everyone down, that no one had time or cared that it sometimes took me way more work to get to a &quot;easy&quot; exercise that is easier when your weight is distributed differently.  I hate that this video is making me seriously reconsider this whole series.  I honestly don&#39;t think I could every do these moves without losing a massive amount of weight and even the arthritis in my toes is making me question if weight loss would even help.<br /><br />I would not put such advanced moves within the first 10 minutes of a video. Like I said, I&#39;m seriously reconsidering whether this is the right path for me.  I&#39;m here because I want to learn, but jumping so far ahead with no warning, with it being day 6 out of 30, I feel so unsupported, so discouraged, and like I just walked into a class for a pHD program and being expected to do the work when skill-wise, I&#39;m still in pre-school and I don&#39;t see the path between here and there.",unboredhands,2020-08-30T15:21:43Z,1

"Love how you always bring a humble outlook to a yoga practice. I know I&#39;ve always had issues with what my stomach looks like and have battled issues with body image and relationship with food. I&#39;ve been on a good path these past 6 months and let me tell you, it wasn&#39;t a new diet or exercise, it was learning to love myself and all my body does for me. Learning that our core muscles do so much (just ask any athlete or anyone who has pulled a core muscle) and our stomach and entire digestive system does a hell of a lot more than we give it credit for. This one I can attest  to personally having major digestive issues throughout a period of my life. Your body is you, your spirit is you.

Try using your hands as a &quot;neck hammock&quot;. Place this hammock where the head and the neck join (try different positions to see how they feel) and dont push up your head when doing the pulses but rather rest it in your hands when you lift up. Also do this when the instruction is to reach towards your feet or something similar - you can do all these exercises with your hands supporting your neck and head! Hope this helps! :),Carmen Kälin,2019-01-09T17:33:39Z,0

"I&#39;m gonna get a little real and a little long here. <br />Today was hard. Physically and mentally. I&#39;ve never felt my core was strong, I&#39;ve never really trusted my core or the muscles there despite knowing logically how much of my strength comes from there.<br />I struggled with this practice. I struggled with day 6 last year but this year I knew what was coming and I thought I was mentally and physically prepared because I&#39;m stronger and more capable than I was this time last year. I was not. Never in any practice have I been so stuck between &quot;I can but I can&#39;t&quot;. I was okay for the hovers and the three-legged dogs because I felt like I could trust my legs and my arms to support what my core couldn&#39;t, I had a safety net. Then I got onto my back and started working. I&#39;ve never felt so weak during my practice. Not last year when I was new or in any other workout I&#39;ve done in my life. Laying there trying to hold my legs and my shoulders up and knowing logically that I can do this, that I&#39;ve done it before, that there&#39;s no pressure to look good or get it perfect, and that I could take breaks if I needed to, but feeling like I was fighting with myself to get there and that feeling of weakness through my core, through my very centre, in comparison to the rest of my body was so in conflict with my logical mind that I felt like I was going to shake apart. <br />I&#39;m not gonna lie. I burst into tears. Free flowing, lying on my back in the middle of the floor sobbing because the conflict in me felt like it was gonna break me. Stuck between &quot;I can but I can&#39;t&quot;.<br />Well I can, I did. I took my break. I cried, I let myself rest. Gave myself a hot minute of feeling like crap, dried my tears and then I rewound to where I fell and I started again. And I did it. I finished the practice, I did the last little obliques work, I reached towards the end of my mat, I put in that extra work to prove that I cam capable of getting back up after falling. <br />I want to say &#39;thank you&#39;, Adriene. Truly. From the bottom of my heart. Thank you for doing these videos. Thank you for being patient and kind and caring. For making me and others feel like it&#39;s okay to fall and that everything is just practice and that we are perfectly imperfect and capable. Thank you for being there and teaching us and guiding us into taking care of all parts of ourselves. <br />You probably won&#39;t see this, and it&#39;s super long so I won&#39;t be disappointed if you don&#39;t read it but I wanted to tell you and anyone else who reads this what this practice was for me. That sometimes these practices are hard not just on your body but on your mind as well, but that we are all capable of getting back up after falling down.<br />Thank you.<br />Namaste<br />&lt;3",Sienna Monique,2019-01-09T02:35:03Z,59

"by walking a lot. if you are close to the nature, go for a long walk - by yourself, when you need to be by yourself. with somebody when you want to be with somebody. the food is mostly a habit - you sit in front of a computer and probably grab food because it&#39;s a stress relief. instead of food put a glass of water or, even better, a cup of green tea in your reach. have reaching for that glass replace reaching out for food. allow yourself a bad food day, but try eating healthy. don&#39;t forget, a large amount of food is still full of calories, no matter how healthy that food is. lastly, don&#39;t stop eating or restrict your diet to a thousand calories or something - you won&#39;t have energy to move. eat less and make sure that you burn more calories than you eat. and don&#39;t expect quick results - it takes time.",Dragi Radovanovic,2019-01-16T05:16:02Z,2

"When I first began doing yoga I thought my wrists were weak. I had trouble holding down dog for long at all, as my wrists would hurt, especially as down dog would be repeated through a session. I didn&#39;t even have any thoughts that it might be that my wrists could get stronger. I really thought they were just weak and I was bummed because I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever be able to fully do yoga with ease in terms of any asanas using wrist action. But, to my happy surprise, one day I noticed my wrists no longer hurt or were sore and I could do down dog for however long and however many times it would be repeated in a session. I would push my wrists to hold a pose longer than it felt safe to back in those earlier days of yoga, but just holding the poses however long felt safe did lead to my wrists getting very strong and now they are not an issue. Namaste.",Bella Jordans,2019-01-08T15:03:17Z,37

"@Christina Keasler What I had to do was simply hold a pose such as down dog as long as I could but without it getting to the point it hurt. I&#39;d hold a pose that put pressure on my wrists such as down dog a little longer once it got to the point my wrists began to feel &quot;worked&quot;  (like I&#39;d hold just a little more to try to strengthen) but I&#39;d go into extended child&#39;s pose once my wrist felt like any longer would become too much (and if the instructor was still having a pose like down dog held by everyone else) and I&#39;d just rest in child&#39;s pose until a different asana was cued. I hadn&#39;t even hoped it would change for me in terms of how my wrists were feeling regarding this and then, one fine day, I noticed I could hold down dog longer without even feeling like my wrists were being &quot;worked&quot;! I was very pleased. Now I can hold something like down dog for quite some time and my wrists don&#39;t feel strained or sore at all.<br /><br />In terms of digging in fingers, the proper alignment (as I&#39;d heard it explained repeatedly in classes led by an instructor who was a stickler for alignment) for the hands is to think in terms of pressing into that knuckle on your palm that&#39;s right under your index finger and then coming down along that edge of the hand (to the fleshy part by your thumb) and then pressing into the knuckle on the palm just under the pinky and coming down that edge of the hand on the outer edge of your palm. You then &quot;rest&quot; the two inner knuckles down that are in between those to anchoring knuckles. The rest of the palm (the center portion) is a little hollowed in shape so the whole palm isn&#39;t smashing into the floor. A friend of mine became yoga instructor certified by that same teacher who knows alignment like she channels it or something and she went over the proper hand alignment, again and again, stating that if it is done incorrectly carpel tunnel can be brought on by holding poses too much that put pressure on the wrists if the hand position is not done correctly. At least that is what that instructor said about it. It may or may not be factual but I have to say I&#39;ve seen many yoga certified instructors who actually don&#39;t do the alignment&#39;s properly (on much of any pose) and I imagine how adept an instructor is with that is largely determined by how well their instructor understood it, taught it, and then how adept the subsequent instructors are at taking it on. (It took me a little while to get this hand placement down. I had to think about it over and over as I&#39;d place my hands down. In time, it became natural. It might also be a part in why my wrists did better over time, but I do know they really did get stronger by repeatedly doing yoga over some months.<br /><br />One thing I&#39;ve noticed about my body, in general, is if I&#39;m eating animal products, sugars, and processed foods I have a lot more aches in my body and migraines. And, most helpfully, I&#39;ve noticed if I have a lot of fresh-made juice that I make each day (like  2 or 3   16 oz servings each day - I&#39;d make some juices that were all green - like cucumber, celery, ginger, or cucumber, celery,  kale or parsley and others would be something like orange, apple, lemon, or watermelon, or watermelon, cucumber and mint {super yummy} and I&#39;d have a green one at least one time each day) I have relatively no aches and pains and hardly get headaches. I&#39;ve gone back and forth on my diet many times over the years and this pattern began to emerge consistently. (I typically dilute my green juices with an equal amount of water, and kale hardly tastes like anything so you get tons of nutrients without much flavor. By diluting the green juice it tastes a lot nicer, in my opinion.)<br /><br />I also tend to be in far happier moods (thoughts/emotions) when having all that juice and eliminating the things mentioned in the first group. It&#39;s like the foods that are far more natural and mostly raw seem to support everything (physical, mental, emotional) while the other side seems to cause issues to varying degrees in all areas as well. It does take some time to notice the improvement if going on the juices and changing the diet. It&#39;s not like I can ever tell right away. I usually can begin to notice improvement after about 2 weeks and it keeps improving from there over several more weeks. <br /><br />A tip also - juicing and raw or vegan foods tend to have people thinking it costs so much to eat like that, but my S.O. and I have noticed over the years of going back and forth dietarily that it&#39;s actually cheaper to have all the juices and produce because, once our bodies are acclimated, we are so nourished that we hardly need any food and we, therefore, don&#39;t keep feeling like we need a snack here and there and another meal over there, etc. (It only cost a little more at first when adding the juices, as we need to eat more at first until our bodies adjust. Then, the price drops significanltly.) We&#39;ve also noticed tremendous health support from Dr. Schultze&#39;s Super Food.

"Usually, any video focused on core turns into a video of pain and suffering I just have to get through. But today in the middle of one of the sequences I found myself slipping into the &quot;role of the observer&quot; for a few moments and noticing and accepting the sensations rather than simply enduring them.

"Every year for the past four years, I&#39;ve started the year doing this 30 day yoga challenge. The first year, I&#39;d lost a fiance who was living 5,000 miles overseas. The second year, I&#39;d started seeing someone new and dove into it quickly. The third year, we&#39;d just moved in together, I was recovering from a broken my arm, and our relationship was falling apart. Year four, I&#39;m crying every day doing this damn yoga because I finally found the strength to move out and begin moving on. From all of it.<br /><br />These 30 day beginning-of-the-year resets are always reminding me that life has ups (like my dope chaturanga dandasana) and downs (like that awful hovering-three-legged-posed! wtf!), and that in the midst of one I can remember the other to find balance. I cried in each of the last three videos because you&#39;re always reminding me how to find love in myself and for the fourth year in a row when I needed to be guided there most. When I&#39;m too depressed (and poor) to make it to the yoga studio and be social with hundreds of Whole Foods yogi types, these videos give me a means to care for my body, my soul, and my self. I can&#39;t thank you enough for these videos, Adriene (and YWA team). They make me laugh, they make me cry, and they make me wake up looking forward to something every day. So grateful to be able to start each year this way!",Amy Chamberlain,2019-01-08T07:04:14Z,0

"I am so grateful for this challenge and for myself for &#39;dedicating&#39; my time and energy to be here. a couple days ago someone left a comment about how yoga has helped their PTSD. I am so thankful for that comment. Today my husband and I were in a car crash. we are bruised and sore and possible bruised or broken ribs. Throughout this experience I breathed. I just breathed. That comment came to my mind and helped me feel more at ease. I also remembered and felt the support from everyone here in this yoga community and knew I was supported and cared about. I couldn&#39;t wait to get home to experience today&#39;s yoga journey. You are all friends I haven&#39;t met yet. I have always loved and remember when Adriene says &#39;lots of love in, and lots of love out&#39;. People always tell you too imagine good things in and bad things out but I never connected with it. One of the first yoga videos I did of Adriene&#39;s she said lots of love and lots of love out and it rung true to my soul and has been with me since. I am a being of love who accepts love and shares love. And every day I find new meaning in those words. Thank you Adriene. Thank you friends. Thank you Benji.",Melanie H,2019-01-08T06:35:20Z,1

Last month when I had a tumble and hurt my wrists, I couldn’t do day 6 of Revolution with you. So instead, I did my own practice. 40 minutes of what felt good.<br />I prefer to practice with you, of course. Cause you’re funny, wise, and a good friend and teacher. But I don’t ‘need’ to.

I felt stronger, more at peace and a sense of pride for not giving up. This challenge isn&#39;t just for working out my body, but even more so for working on my mind and inner peace. Namaste all! 💕",Mary-Katherine Gozemba,2019-01-08T05:07:16Z,0

Hi everybody! Keep up the good work! <br /><br />Adriene and yoga family: my manduka mat has gotten really slippery and I find that I want to use my old mat because my wrists are hurting (they are sliding in downward dog) ...Should I salt it again? I got it a year and a half ago and haven’t really done any maintenance on it since ...aside from yoga mat cleaning spray wipe downs after practice. Anyone have any advice?!?

"Today I was gentler on my body because as soon as I got to the mat I realized I had pain in my lower back, and during a couple breaks between I did some other poses that felt right and spent extra time in poses that felt right and I feel better (also cracked a lot of bones). When we did the three legged hover with my right leg in the air, I had my leg back, lifted my knee to hover, my left leg cracked in three different places and I came back down onto the mat. And yes, that just happened! So didn’t quite get that post but was interesting none the less XD <br /><br />Also I’m really excited to come back to this later on. While I feel I did good today for where I’m at in yoga, I also know with improvement I’ll be able to do so much more with this practice.",Amelia Rose,2019-01-08T03:40:51Z,0
"I was extremely close to “letting myself off the hook” today and skipping yoga. My Monday was a shitstorm. I woke up to my cat peeing blood and have spent the last 9 or so hours back and forth to the animal hospital and on the phone with veterinarian. We’ve ruled some scary things out, and my sweet boy Charlie is snoozing while his antibiotics kick in. I just finished this yoga session and I feel so much better for it. Interesting how skipping something like this can feel like something you “deserve” to be able to do on a tough day, when what you actually need is to do the complete opposite and follow through, to feel better. ✌️ Feeling grateful tonight for family support, furry friends and Adriene.",Jess J.,2019-01-08T03:40:03Z,0

Does anyone know if its okay to go onto my fists during table top? Like good for the position/connection/flow? My right wrist has been an unhappy camper for like almost a year now and I really struggle with too much time in table top specifically,Isha Sharma,2019-01-08T01:41:28Z,0
"I have the same issue with my right wrist and on some days can&#39;t even get it bent for tabletop because of the pain. In those cases my yoga teacher once told me to go on the forearms. It will be a bit of a different pose but one that also strengthens the arms (which will help the wrists in the long run) and puts absolutely no pressure on the wrists. It feels weird at first but it&#39;s even a good practice for headstand, so I am telling myself even though I can&#39;t do the tabletop I will be able to do a headstand eventually ;D",Co,2019-01-10T02:36:03Z,0

My song would be &quot;She&#39;s On Fire&quot; from the Scarface soundtrack. 🙏🏽",galukya1,2019-01-07T21:23:49Z,0

"This somehow really made my neck hurt and cramp up, because I don&#39;t have a lot of power in my core muscles so I tend to lift up from the neck. Anyone know how to take better care of this? Because it&#39;s also making me feel really dizzy :/<br /><br />Besides that, a great practice! Thanks a lot Adriene. That thing with one knee hovered and the other leg lifted up high was so cool.

I think the your neck might be compensating for the core which was struggling.

Two questions:<br />•for the exercises in which our legs are suspended above us, I tend to feel it more in the groin and top of my thighs instead of my lower abs; am I doing something wrong?<br /><br />•when it came time to straighten the legs above me and then crunch, I got a <b>huge</b> cramp in my upper abs and had to make the crunch motion a lot smaller so it wouldn’t happen again; is this acceptable (at least until I can work up to doing a bigger crunch)?<br /><br />Thanks for an awesome day 6! <br />❤️🧘🏻‍♀️👍",bxrosie04,2019-01-07T19:59:48Z,0

"I have to admit that I wa kind of afraid by a &quot;core&quot; video. I kind of traumatized myself with core/abds workout some years ago and I always have difficulty working on this part of my body even if it is important (not in a physical way but for the posture, to protect the back, etc...) My danse teacher always tells me that I should work on my core but I don&#39;t XD Today&#39;s practice has been hard. Because of the posture, because of the complicated history I have with core things and because of my thoughts. But I&#39;m trying to embrace it. I went trough it anyways and I think I can feel... proud ? Thanks Adriene &lt;3",Mathilde Berg,2019-01-07T19:36:25Z,0

"This was an amazing one of discovery for me. First day back at school I was already tired when I remembered it was core day. However I rolled out my mat bravely and clicked on the video. When adriene said &#39;&#39;trust&#39;&#39; in the video I broke out in tears. Trusting for me has been a difficult thing since long but here on the mat I feel safe to do so. and then when we went into the V shape I found how strong body had become since last time I did this position. I didnt even shake! and then I broke out in tears even more. Thank you, I didnt know I would feel so successful with todays video but I do. So Thank You &lt;3   <br /><br />And all the while, My pet rabbit was sitting calmly next to the yoga mat giving me his companionship. He used to be fearful of me when I adopted him 1 and a half years ago. First time he saw me do yoga he bolted out of the room and hid under the table.

"This was wonderful. I love your emphasis on compassion especially for the core as often the core is &quot;blasted&quot; in regular exercise.

"Today as I readied for Day 6, I already felt a positive energy and was eager and willing, which is great in contrast to days that PTSD got me down. I love how Adriene adds variations to poses that we already such as lifting the knee with the other leg extended. It made me feel challenged and strong to get this done. The rest of the core exercise was challenging and rewarding. I realize I need to work on drawing in my navel to my spine. Adriene, your core practices have really changed how I use to do core exercises. It was such a slog in the past. Now it is a loving practice in which I am focused on the present. Having a strong core and abs are a result of being present in the practice, as opposed to the manner in which I use to only focus on the end results. Thank you!",Terence,2019-01-07T17:19:36Z,0

I&#39;m learning how to apply this to my time off the mat and it&#39;s full of hits and misses and it&#39;s harder to not blame yourself when you feel you should already know better... but I&#39;m not letting that discourage me :D",Celeste Podeswik,2019-01-07T16:13:04Z,0

Somehow this allowed me do the WHOLE practice (which I had been dreading). Everytime I breathed in love and breathed out love, I was so aware of the positivity and love of our community. Tears of happiness as we bowed namaste to one another.    I&#39;m a sap, but I&#39;m a happy sap 🌳😂. Namaste ❤",Nicky Watkins,2019-01-07T16:11:42Z,0

I absolutely adore you! I sing your praises to all my potential yoga loving friends (and the ones who practice all ready too!) I fell out of the practice 2 years ago and a recent breakup made me realize I need more self love. What magically popped up in my inbox...? YOU and this beautiful video which is exactly what I needed in my life at the moment! Thanks for always being here for us and for doing what you do 🧘‍♀️🤗😘,Lisa Lou,2019-01-07T16:10:26Z,0
"This is my first ever a 30 day journey with you. I began doing yoga for the first time back in December and just watching different videos of yours to explore what yoga can do for me. So far it&#39;s been amazing. You make me feel empowered, relaxed, and thankful all in one go. When I&#39;m having a hard time on the mat you help me to stay relaxed, breathe, and to laugh a little with your jokes (they&#39;re very helpful btw). I&#39;m excited to continue this journey with you until January 31st. At the end of this dedicate I&#39;ve decided to dedicate myself to staying with the yoga practice throughout this year of 2019 and beyond and see where it takes me. I just wanted to say a quick thank you for what you do and that you&#39;re deeply appreciated. Namaste 🙏 also quick sidenote...what is the music that you use for the intro and the ending of these videos. I love this it&#39;s so relaxing 😍",Dustey Steward,2019-01-07T16:05:59Z,0

"Okay, so today was the hardest struggle I ever had coming to the mat. I have a slight flu and canceled some appointments today. Been feeling sick and sad all day. Then I decided to try this practice with a kind beginners mind. So to just see what my (feverish) body could do and see what was too much. And I was quite surprised. I took an extra happy baby in the first round of back core work. And stayed down at the end when you suggested. But all the other things went quite well. This is such a big achievement for me, to just do what IS possible instead of focus on what&#39;s not. Usually I would just skip yoga on a sick day, but I do feel like I conquered something. Feeling very grateful and a tad emotional. Thank you, adriene, for this opportunity to learn!",Marleen Ton,2019-01-07T16:03:16Z,0

"Think this is the fourth day 6 I&#39;ve done out of these 30 days challenges, and it&#39;s been by far the most comfortable I&#39;ve felt doing the a day 6 workout. They normal kick my ass a bit, and I normally end up getting frustrated with my lack of coordination by the end. Not today though! I&#39;m sure my core will still be feeling in later though! Lol<br /><br />I will say, the first half today I really enjoyed. I always like hovering cat when it comes up and I feel far more comfortable doing that than I do something like downward facing dog, so those different version today felt like a really exciting treat.",Paul Convery,2019-01-07T16:02:53Z,0

Almost one week into this year’s 30 day challenge and I just have to say, thank you Adriene. My body is transformed. Yoga is my happy place. I even do it when I have kids trying to knock into me/talk to me/making lots of noise around me. I just smile and breathe. I now know what my body can do, and it is such a joy to see it continue to transform. So, love you Adriene. And, love you bod 💜💚💙",Emilie Marsolais,2019-01-07T15:50:22Z,0

"Relight My Fire - Take That :D<br />I often struggle with core work because it puts strain on my lower back. Whenever I lift up I feel it more in my lower back than in my abdominals. I thought this was because I had a weak lower back, but was told it&#39;s the whole lower trunk that needs strengthening. The corset. Is this true? Will my lower back get stronger the more I work on my core? It did feel better to focus on the zipping/kissing of the upper and lower abdominals. I also sometimes get a tight chest. I think this is from trying to follow along with you Adriene as best I can with the breath. It doesn&#39;t always seem natural to me though to breathe when you do, so it&#39;s something I need to work on I think.<br />Thank you and happy 6th day! X",Alison Harris,2019-01-07T15:17:45Z,0

"Not sure why, but just after the start of this (somewhere around the first downward dog) I realized that much of my life, I&#39;ve always wanted to be someone else. I realized yesterday how strong my tendency to compare myself to others is, but this new awareness further opened my eyes. It made me a little sad to see that there&#39;s been many times where I (thought) I preferred someone else&#39;s being, to my own.But also awoken in me a new reverence for myself and a promise to honour myself more fully. I&#39;m constantly amazed by what the yoga mat has to teach me, how it assists me in letting go and supports me in my journey to wholeness.

"So proud of myself that I&#39;ve stuck with it 6 days in a row! I wake up looking forward to my morning practice.  Adrienne&#39;s comments really help me to understand how to best do the movement.  One question... what does &quot;turn upper arms out&quot; when in table position mean? Is that the same as opening my shoulders and bringing my shoulder blades closer together? I&#39;m very loosely ligamented,  so I can rotate my arm from shoulder to wrist without changing my wrist or shoulder angles. This is not a good thing to do, so if anyone can clarify where I should focus my attention I&#39;d greatly appreciate it.  Thanks!",Karen B,2019-01-07T14:34:42Z,0

"First time I comment on YWA (finally, yay!). It&#39;s been more than a year that I&#39;ve been practicing more or less regularly and I&#39;m so grateful to you, Adriene and the whole community to share your knowledge and love with us for free on Youtube, thank you so much! I&#39;ve been loving Dedicate so far and today I just burst out laughing cause my core was screaming like never before. I don&#39;t know anyone else who inspires me to work so hard and with so much care so I had to write this comment. Thank you so much again, everyone, I wish you all the best in your practive and in your life. Love",Mel Levin,2019-01-07T14:30:53Z,0
Boy this was great. So different than I expected it to be. The best part was when she asked us to lift on one foot. I shouted whooooahh then not a second later so did Adriene. Got a good laugh with that. Lovely and strong practice. And no feeling connected to my tummy.,mythought96,2019-01-07T14:30:20Z,4
"Woah, you sure knew how to make me sweat today! Hovering on one leg was a killer for me.

"Good morning/evening/night to you all. I would like to thank Ms Mishler for this excellent work and content. I  do not normally share my views but this channel has been an anchor giving me stability and a reason to keep coming back. My story is probably alot like many who find themselves here, due to my job I herniated my L4 &amp; L3 in 2011. The pain is a constant, unless it flares and learning that the pain will not dissipate can be a hard thing to comprehend let alone accept. Some days the pain beats me but more often than not I can stay above it. Please excuse another maritime metaphor but  this practice encourages me to kick harder against the waves of pain and to feel stronger. My practice is done by myself and even if I have not yet looked for a more meaningful, deeper connection, it  still gives me strength developing and strengthening my lower back and opening up my spine. Thank you for the instruction and the encouragement. I wish you all well in your pursuits in 2019.",Martin O'Malley,2019-01-16T12:16:04Z,0
"I tried the 30 day challenge two years ago and stopped right around Day 6 - it&#39;s been such a great experience to actually do this practice every day, rather than trying to &quot;catch up&quot; on 2-3 practices at once and not getting into the consistent daily rhythm. Today was challenging but I did it! And now I feel much more awake and energized to start my day. Thank you Adrienne for helping me reconnect to my body, and also giving my boyfriend and me an opportunity to connect to our health together.",Emma A,2019-01-07T14:15:22Z,0

"@ArtGirl Creations yea... I&#39;ve been there! Just focus in the contraction of the abdomen and don&#39;t force your neck. If you can&#39;t lift as high as it should be just do your thing, you&#39;ll get there in time.",Gabriela F,2019-01-07T14:57:11Z,2

"💜 You are so right about the wrists! When I was younger I was in gymnastics and sprained my wrist to the point that I thought I would always have wrist pain, or weak wrists, but after sticking with my first year of yoga, my wrist never bothers me at all. I couldnt even go bowling because of it and now I am on a bowling league playing three games a week.  Its all about  consistency and sticking with it to build that strength, and same with the core so thank you for this practice and all the free yoga you offer.. it is so appreciated! 💜  &amp;  🔥As a Colorado girl, my fire song is Fire on the Mountain by the Grateful Dead, also covered by The String Cheese Incident 🔥",Khaira Waite,2019-01-07T12:19:02Z,0

"I have a question. I&#39;ve heard Adriene mention the wrists throughout all her videos. I don&#39;t have any problems with my wrists, but when I&#39;m in table top position, I start to feel it in my shoulder musles after a while, they start to burn. Is this also normal or is my posture off? I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s normal, I have very weak arm muscles and I feel they&#39;re getting stronger. Just wanted to check, cause she always talks about the wrists and not the shoulders 😁❤️🙏",Sabrina Gust,2019-01-07T12:07:15Z,0

Hi from Germany! 💗So thankful for everyone&#39;s comments and positive vibes. This is my first time committing to a 30 day yoga challenge and I&#39;m so happy it&#39;s with such an amazing teacher and such a supportive community! Sending much love and positivity to everyone as we go on this journey together. I too find myself needing to grab a tissue before each practice because it really gives me such a release of emotion. Let&#39;s keep going strong everyone- we got this! 💪,Gyovanna Monreal,2019-01-07T10:14:41Z,14

"Today was the first time I woke up and felt some apprehension rather than excitement to come on the mat. I had to work very late to finish a project, I&#39;ll have to work very late again today because of an exam tomorrow morning, and I thought &quot;my core is so weak, this is going to be hell, is it really the right choice to do this today instead of getting an extra 30 minutes to sleep or work&quot;? But then I realized two things: 1) I was scared of &quot;failing&quot; at yoga.Which is ridiculous, because you can&#39;t &quot;fail&quot; or &quot;do badly&quot; at a practice, you can only get stronger and feel better. And anyway, this is Adriene! I trust her, and I trust the process. 2) Yes, showing up at my mat just for me, even when it isn&#39;t easy is the right choice. It is self-care and we need some more than ever when we feel tired, stressed and overwhelmed. So I did it, I got on the mat, and I actually enjoyed myself a whole lot! I even let out a surprise laugh at the one-knee hover because of how different it felt from both 3-legged dog and the normal hovering on both knees. I am so happy and energised right now! So anyway, this extra long comment just to say: to anyone feeling like I was today: let go of that fear, that frustration. Trust the process and go in your practice being kind to yourself, without judgement. It will be amazing. Thank you Adriene, you are magic &lt;3",Noannelle Sky,2019-01-07T08:00:05Z,115

"I totally agree! Wow today was TIRING, I didn&#39;t wake up early to do my yoga because I was exhausted, and almost didn&#39;t do it after work because every ounce of energy was drained from me. Then I just showed up and did the practice anyway, and I feel SO much better and SO much more energized. I felt like crap going in, and feel so calm and awake coming out.",Pia Edberg,2019-01-08T04:51:05Z,3

"The others are totally right, you did an amazing job by taking time for yourself.<br />And remember what adriene said in the third video, sometimes you need to hear that;<br />If you, we&#39;ll catch you, don&#39;t worry. Falling is part of the game. In yoga, you learn to fall with grace, you learn to love yourself through the fall (easier said than done, i damn know..), instead of feeling shame or embarrassment.

I have lost over 100lbs in the last 2 years but my belly stil is round. In forward folds i run out of space before coming to a full stretch because my rolls get in the way. Yet todays practice filled me with a sense of strength and selflove for this part of my body. I’ll get there...,Igmutanka Nagi,2019-01-07T07:25:45Z,53
"My tummy makes it hard to bring my legs up to the front from plank or lunge. Adriene teaches us that any yoga is good yoga. Love yourself. My tummy enjoys cookies and made two babies.

I am the opposite--I&#39;ve gained about 60 lbs in the past year due to PCOS. I&#39;ve got so many rolls that I&#39;ve never had before--learning to love them and trust that I am strong even with rolls. So happy for you and your newfound self love &lt;3,Andrea Martineau,2019-01-08T03:41:10Z,0

Found myself weeping helplessly and inexplicably at the end of this one.....I have decided to tell myself it&#39;s a GOOD thing -- maybe the release of some of the negative emotion and self-doubt I woke up with. Adriene&#39;s gentleness and specifically her comment about hating the tummy area triggered something.  Shall bring kleenex to the mat tomorrow! See you then x,Kris Henley,2019-01-07T07:03:32Z,67
