"Hello dear friends! Today we activate the body, yes, but remember - the breath always comes first. Day 4! We got this! xx",Yoga With Adriene,2020-01-05T13:55:18Z,1015
I loved today&#39;s yoga stretch! So grateful for you Adriene and your commitment to giving back to the people. I honor you today xoxoxox Namaste,Cheryl Barker,2020-11-21T15:12:49Z,0
"I find the most difficult part of yoga (you being my first instructor) is trying to follow watching my phone while doing some poses. I feel incredible, but as I go I’m starting to remember positions so it becomes more natural. But yes phones make it challenging like everything else.",Paul Amoratis,2020-10-08T09:54:33Z,0
"This session made me shed a tear (or 6!). I really vibe off you Adriene, I love how honest you are, I love your confidence to share your little quirks and nerd-outs. You say a lot of simple yet profound things. The bit that tipped me today was the idea of there being bumps in the road but that we&#39;re all in this together. You seem like such a truly kind lady, I feel you talking to us as individuals but also to yourself as you perfectly model self-love. Thank you x",Georgie Baldwin Burchell,2020-08-14T09:22:45Z,0

"Day 4 today Adriene! Believe me when I say you&#39;re an absolute blessing. I&#39;ve having tough time in my life due some personal issues and top it off with crazy thyroid, I was an absolute mess. I used to workout but I don&#39;t have the strength to do it anymore alone. These 20 min yoga sessions have been so good for my mind and body. Your voice and little funny anecdotes in between bring cheer to my life. Thank you ❤️",Vanshika Garg,2020-07-11T15:34:21Z,0

Great yoga but so sad that Americans still cut tails and ears off their pet dogs.  This has been banned in the UK for years. Hard for a dog to really express itself without a tail. Awful,Carol Lamb,2021-02-06T13:39:04Z,0
"I am doing this in 2021 after Breath 30 day yoga. I missed yesterday for the first time in 33 days due to a family emergency. I had trouble coming back today, but I&#39;m so glad I did. Coming to the mat today with Adriene and Benji felt like coming home and it&#39;s the support I need right now.",Coreen Davis,2021-02-05T12:42:33Z,4
"Being new to yoga and having completed Breath in my own time,  I seem to be out of synch with others but getting there in my own way. I find that when I miss a day of yoga now, I just feel more drawn to do it the next day. We are coming home to our own body, mind and spirit and that&#39;s very individual and unique.

"Hello! I&#39;m on day 3 of the 30 day Yoga-Challenge. I&#39;m loving it so far! Looking forward to tomorrow morning already, set this video already up to press start tomorrow. Anyone else on the journey right now?",Dania,2020-10-31T09:13:54Z,0
"@Dania I totally understand what you mean by not being a routined person - I was never one either! I enjoy freedom so much and I think what can be &quot;toxic&quot; with them is that shame that we can begin to feel (from our own conditioning) when we miss out on something - at least that was my experience. But I&#39;ve realized that if I could put that aside, and simply recognize that how much a &quot;light&quot; routine in the morning can provide a certain stability to keep me grounded in my day and to ultimately support me, I feel so much more invested in doing these daily practices and it comes rather naturally. :-)  Good for you, for having recognized the inner critic and hearing beyond that voice, the world needs more kindness and compassion, starting with ourselves. :-) It is all a process... Every day is a process. I&#39;m honestly grateful to be exchanging with you throughout these practices and would love to chat at the end of day 30 as well! :-) Hope you&#39;re having fun and also being inspired on and off the mat. ♥︎",Emily Beauchamp,2020-11-09T13:50:51Z,0
"@Emily Beauchamp Wow, that is really inspiring thank you! I wanted to try to incorporate it into my morning routine anyway now I&#39;m even more thrilled to try. I&#39;ve been having struggles to have a routine ever since I moved into the place I live in now, also I am not a very routined person. Recently I have been realizing, though, how much stability a routine can give, and now I want to try. Also, yesterday I skipped a day because I was on the road all day, spending the night at a friend&#39;s place. At first I wasn&#39;t very happy about it, but then I thought, &quot;why bother?&quot; and I will just continue with day 10 now, I simply skipped a day. I don&#39;t want to be too hard on myself. Your message reminded me that it is a process and I am very grateful! Wishing you a very inspirational and fun time on the mat the following days! Would love to chat at the end of day 3ß, if you&#39;d like to ;)",Dania,2020-11-08T19:18:45Z,1
"@Dania Hey Dania! So great that you replied too. It&#39;s so comforting to know others are practicing too. ❁ Thank you for sharing with me. ♥︎ Hmm I can totally understand how committing to doing it consistently can be challenging, especially when there are so many other things to do in the day! The yoga practice has actually become part of my wake up ritual since I started the challenge. After taking a few sips of water and brewing coffee, I prepare the space for the session, and before I do anything else in the day I start on the mat. I struggled so much to commit to this kind of thing in the past when I was working full-time from home, as choosing oneself becomes more challenging. I have since stopped working and slowly, by making small decisions to support my well-being on the day-to-day, this practice tends to come more naturally for me now. I hope that this can help in some way, but if not, know that everything is a process and it&#39;s all ok no matter where you&#39;re at today. :-)",Emily Beauchamp,2020-11-06T21:56:42Z,1

"Adriene is exactly right. It is all about Discipline. We are all great at starting but not so much on finishing. Today (day 4) I did not want to get up, but convinced myself to do it. And feels amazing. Remember this feeling we are all having at the completion of the set. Jocko Willink - talks about discipline- when you’re struggling to make the choice. Visualize how you felt with the task completed- feel it. And the visualize the feeling you have if you skip it (unfulfilled, build up, day behind, stressed, unsatisfied) - put yourself there and feel it. And then decide which feeling you would rather have. And then attack the task at hand. Love the community here, hope y’all have an amazing day.",Mathew Watson,2020-08-25T10:43:30Z,0

"This practice is helping me so much during quarantine. I was really struggling to keep it all together, work, family and living in a city which is experiencing a second wave of COVID. It&#39;s helping me carve out a time of calm, and its starting to ripple through to the rest of my day. I have had a strong practice in the past, but this year has totally thrown me (and the world) off balance. The idea of returning home is resonating really strongly with me. I can feel my nervous system responding, and it&#39;s powerfully good. Thank you Adriene, you&#39;re just what we need right now. Love to you",Nicole Mercer,2020-07-24T01:12:08Z,0

"I so appreciate your videos. Discovered them when I spent 3 weeks in hospitals and was bored to death. And really anxious and depressed. So I had to fill time with something. There was a spare room that was not used and asked if I can use it to di yoga. So That started my yoga journey. This is my first month. What got me attracted to your videos, to be honest, is Benji. He is so cool. You are lucky ta have him. <br /><br />I also like how your videos are more about stretching than strength. Cause I have no strength :)<br /><br />Greetings from Estonia",Helen Golovin,2020-07-17T19:32:04Z,0

"Hearing you mention discipline a lot was reaffirming, because my mantra for the intend session was ‘discipline and motivation’. I’ve been reminding myself of that intention for the following sessions now and will keep reminding myself. I’m going through a depressive episode currently, and usually I just end up a lump in bed, unable to do anything - but this time, your channel has really helped me. There’s been days I’ve not worked out or done yoga, but the huge thing is that I always end up doing it the next day. I used to be someone who did it for a week or so, skipped a day then didn’t do it for months. Those months have turned into just a day or two and that is HUGE for me. So, thank you, Adriene.

"Hi Samson, Adriene has said in other videos that it&#39;s absolutely fine to bend the knees as much as you need in a forward fold - it should be a more relaxed position.

And i just think it&#39;s really cool that we don&#39; t even see and know each other to have that effect on me. This is my old soul speaking haha. But i&#39;m so grateful for these video&#39;s. I learn a lot from them, i see you following your intuition while doing yoga and using your empathy to guide and support us through a video. And even from observing that, i learn. Most of the time i&#39;m just crying though because finding yourself is very emotional. So thank you for the laughs and cries, i feel very alive. &lt;3",Hannah T,2020-04-28T10:08:25Z,0

Day 4 completed!! Had to get to it a little late since I had to write an essay but still made this a priority. I definitely had a bit of an awakening today during the low lunge. My upper thigh was on fire not even 4 seconds in. Normally I will in bend my leg or fix myself in some way to make it easier and for the pain to go away. But today I told myself breath through the pain and let it hurt. And oh my god the pain started going away on it own with out me having to adjust. While it didn’t completely go away it was bearable. Definitely mind over matter. Namaste everyone 🧘🏻‍♀️,Crochet Streams,2020-03-30T09:44:38Z,0

Anyhoo, it took me 2/3 of the video to stop having thoughts about all the corona-digital-teaching I&#39;ve been doing.

"Sooo even though I was super excited to start day 4 today, I had a bit of trouble focusing and started the practice over after 7 mins of solid fidgeting(urgh), and it led me to smash out a great practice! <br />I just started the Home program while under lockdown in China. I feel completely at peace when I finish each day. My cat is fidgety at the start but she calms down with me as the minutes progress. So happy I found this 😊 I will be doing all of your other programs as the year progresses. I&#39;ve done yoga very sporadically in the past (with the help of your Videos) and never really thought about the benefits or how it affected me and my mental health. But after ONLY four days of continously doing yoga, I&#39;m already hooked. <br />THANK YOU ADRIENNE! I think I&#39;ve finally found something my body loves to do and appreciates me doing it and this is something I can see myself continuing with and would love to practice it every day! <br /><br />Oh side note: I was wondering if you have any programs or ideas / practices for asthmatics?

I was getting so frustrated with myself in the first 3 days with an ongoing shoulder issue and I couldn’t push into plank or downward dog. I actually cried during day 2 out of sheer frustration. Today I got to the mat and kept with my promise to show up for myself and be the best version of myself and OMG I was able to do a plank and push into a downward dog! It was such a huge confidence boost. Thank you Adriene for your gentle encouragement and all that you do in this amazing community.,Meghan Foster,2020-02-14T01:48:16Z,0

Guyss is there anyone doing this yoga challenge who is over-overweight ? For me it gets more and more impossible to do the exercises cuz of my belly and very thick tights. ALso my balance is very bad so today i basically couldn’t even do half of it. Gonna give it a day or two more and if it will get even more complicated then i just choose sth what im actually able to do. As a totally beginner and very overweight this might be just not for me.,Erika Simon,2020-02-10T09:05:36Z,0

"Already my second 30 day challenge I do with you and I love it, of course 😃 only thing I wish you had, would be a journal. Something where you have for each day written down your thoughts — your Mantra of the day. After the yoga session we can write our own thoughts to it, and reflect a bit on it. Cause what you say during the lessons are so valuable thoughts, and sometimes I wish I would read them up somewhere, without watching the whole video again.

"So, I’ve never ever really exercised...at all really, besides going for long walks. While I knew yoga was good for the body and mind, I never expected it to be as soul searching as it has been for me. And it’s only been 4 days! Not to get ahead of myself, but I think yoga will be a part of my daily routine for a long time to come. The stretches feel so good. And the meditative aspect really makes me feel whole.

"Today&#39;s practice for me was about pain. The pain of doing my best. To chase this pain. To treat this pain as if it were life itself, because life is pain, and pain is life (but in a positive way!) When I stayed longer in low lunge than what I&#39;m used to, it hurts, the muscles start to tremble, but it feels good at the same time. My day today, together with this yoga session, has taught me this: Chase pain. With pain comes joy. Treat pain as a compass. (But within reason, of course.)",Looi Jo Ping,2020-01-29T16:38:23Z,0

"I have done 4 days in a row! Despite migraines, and tiredness. I kind of decided to treat this as an experiment. My doctor wants me to be doing yoga, and i thought well,  let&#39;s do it even though disease is causing pain/exhaustion. And quite frankly I&#39;m very proud of myself. I feel uplifted and like I accomplished something after, (which is a really good thing to feel as a lyme spoonie). And I really think I&#39;m actually detoxing faster (which is crazy good),.

"I seem to be the only one when i say i very much disliked this lesson? I can&#39;t connect with any of this mumbo jumbo you&#39;re saying and i hardly feel any stretches during 90% of this exercise. (I am a beginner)<br />The comments are flooding with emotional responses but i&#39;m not feeling much of anything. Does someone maybe know a different challenge with less &quot;connecting&quot;, &quot;believing&quot;, &quot;trusting&quot; etc.<br />If this works for you, great! But i&#39;d much rather have you explain to me what we are doing with the muscles instead of finding my &quot;integrity&quot;?<br /><br />I am here to stretch my super tight muscles from poor posture and little exercise i&#39;ve had in my life, but this seems more like a therapy session? I love to meditate so i&#39;m mentally relaxed, it really feels like i&#39;m wasting time laying on the ground being told that im not wasting time laying there. I do not mean to insult anyone here, but i&#39;m just frustrated looking for what i want. Can anyone maybe give me some advice as to where i can find a great stretch routine (without these spiritual buzzwords?). Thanks!",Zennin Mina,2020-01-19T16:08:50Z,0

"Being an Indian I have been surrounded by Yoga since forever. But I always assumed it was all about postures and flexibility. <br />I have trained in the gym too for quite some time but I always struggled with upper body strength. Haven&#39;t ever been able to do a single pushup (properly)<br />Everytime  you asked to do a cobra pose, my body would just fall to the ground then I had to lift it up. Today it just flowed. I never touched the ground and just went straight up. I was so surprised I had to pause the video and do it multiple times to believe myself. <br />Thanks a lot Adriene!

Deeply listening to how MY body WANTS to move with my breath.  Breath is the Foundation!  The flexibility comes with regular practice.  Ideally daily.  There are days when it’s hard for me to show up first thing in the morning, or last thing at night.  OH, the people and things that must be put off, due to this Commitment!

Wow. That chair pose at the very end was so powerful. I chose to ground in with both feet so my left and right forces were as balanced when grounding down as much as possible. Lovely experience. I appreciate all the steps you composed to lead up to that. I don&#39;t think i&#39;ve had as effortless and strong warrior or lunge poses.

I&#39;ve never experienced yoga like this before. Usually, the dogma turns me off. But you bring a humour and lightness to the room (I think you call it humility?) that I&#39;ve been longing for.

"Ok incoming incoherent rambling. <br /><br />When you said make the transitions your own, it dawned on me that most of my life hasn’t really been about making my own decisions. Even in little things. In the past if someone says hop to the front of the mat, I would even if my body wasn’t feeling it. So little things like choosing to do baby steps if I need to is helping me listen to my body more. I’m seeing how these tiny things that we wouldn’t really think about are starting to show up in my life. Like you said, how you do things on the mat is how you do them off the mat. Thank you for the lesson. 🙏✨",Smiling Flowers,2020-01-14T11:50:15Z,18

Then last week with one news event after another of my people in Iran, I felt so helpless, lost, glued to the news 24/7. It&#39;s nothing new, but it just felt relentless last week. I woke up everyday with such heaviness and deep deep trauma. Then, I said I couldn&#39;t delay anymore. Now on Day 4, the pain doesn&#39;t stop but I can breathe a little easier.

"Yogi Adriene, <br />I am 58 yr old male 6 ft 265 with a budda belly. While I am down 10 lbs and been working out I struggle with the forward fold in the HOME series. I get to my ankles at best. Beside using blocks what advice do you have for getting more flexible so I can get my hands touching the mat?  It&#39;s also a struggle going from a downward-facing dog into a runner lounge. I have to cheat.   I was doing well after a 30-day camp then got away from the daily practice. my daily routine was shortened to some stretching with some yoga poses. I am now paying for that.  advice besides keep at it?<br />Thank you for all you do  I would have never been brave enough to try yoga before if it wasn&#39;t for this channel so I joined FWFG to help support your efforts.

I have realized that I also want (and need) some intentional movement everyday, which is what I have chosen to call it. I think I have also heard you say &quot;move with intention&quot;, and that&#39;s what makes these moves different compared to what I do at work. Although only at day 4, I already find myself looking forward to coming home from work and moving intentionally for a little bit. Thank you, Adriene, and everyone else practicing around the world.

"Adriene, do you feel as if our daily yoga practice alone is enough to be healthy and strong? <br />I’ve always been so focused on going so hard on my body and lifting weights to the point where I would choose that over yoga. <br />This year I’m trying to take a more gentle approach and I realize now that it might have been more of my ego self just trying to look a certain way but it’s not about that anymore. It’s about loving my body and more about how I treat it. But I just didn’t know if yoga alone was enough? <br /><br />Much love, <br />Kelly.",Kelly Beth Mcgrath,2020-01-09T14:14:56Z,0

"Hi Adrienne, I just want to share this...........I&#39;ve been doing your routines off and on for a little while and joined your 30 day HOME when it started. I&#39;ve been practicing with you daily for the last 3 weeks. I woke up this morning and it is remarkable how great my body feels. I simply love it. I had to idea I could feel like this. I also never knew one could feel so many different energies through yoga ie I could feel the difference in this workout as opposed to the one yesterday. A little thing that I think is special is the number of times I smile during the routine at your suggestions. That is surely special. Your call to have fun is wonderful. I just want you to know how much I appreciate your routine and spending time with you. Love, respect to you and  Benji. He/she&#39;s so cute :). THANK YOU!!!!!!!",Kavir Mootoo,2020-01-07T09:52:27Z,0

".my dog unlike Benji is not great at sitting quietly in the corner and believes forward folds equal belly rubs, and yoga mats are for sharing.<br /><br />My New Years resolution was to finally complete a 30 days of yoga series in the 30 days, previous attempts have seen me make it 17 days or completed the 30 sessions in 46 days, however this time I’m making time to do yoga, remembering each day is one day, allowing myself to do what I can and just be.",Jocelyn Raine,2020-01-06T14:54:51Z,0

"Adriene, I had a kind of spiritual experience in today&#39;s practice, something I have never ever encountered before. When you said to imagine a current or flow going up front body and down the back body, I immediately pictured white balls of light moving in a current around and around my body in an endless flow, almost protecting me. I immediately started grinning to myself and closed my eyes. I don&#39;t know how I knew but I knew the white balls of light were spirits, I don&#39;t know what kind of spirits, just that I know that&#39;s what they were and they were protecting me and it made me smile through the whole practice.<br /><br />At the end of the practice in mountain pose, I was smiling and crying and had this overwhelming sense of happiness and joy. I&#39;ve never experienced anything like this before and I&#39;m not a particularly spiritual person so it was a little overwhelming. I had a sense of nothing else being present in the room except me and the white lights protecting me, guiding me, looking over me. It was a serene and profound experience. I&#39;m fairly new to yoga and this is my first YWA 30 day journey and I am thoroughly enjoying it.<br /><br />Have you, Adriene, or anyone else ever experienced anything like this while doing yoga (or at any other time)? I&#39;d be very curious to know.<br /><br />Thank you for your videos, Adriene, and all your words of support and kindness and wisdom. I love your videos, they are becoming the highlight of my day. Thank you &lt;3 <br /><br />Bridie",Bridie Cook,2020-01-06T09:43:07Z,0

I love how articulate and silly you are, along with how you have different variations for all levels. I&#39;m sure you know how much of an impact you&#39;ve made on people&#39;s lives, but I just thought I would chime in to let you know as well. This Home series is such a great way to start of the new year/ new decade. Thanks for all that you do. :)",Cassie Danskine,2020-01-06T04:19:04Z,0
Felt much more fluid today! I was happy to hear you say that we could abbreviate certain points because I was starting to feel down on myself for not being able to keep up. Thanks for predicting my disappointment in myself and making sure I knock it off!,Jennifer Gambacorta,2020-01-06T04:18:22Z,0

"As I stood in mountain pose hands out I imagined holding hands with others on this journey (like the commenter from Day 3&#39;s vid said!) And promptly had tears in my eyes. I felt like I was connected to other souls. <br />Yoga has never made me emotional but I&#39;m leaning in. Allowing myself to see emotional responsed not as weakness. <br />This is so different. Thank you so much, Adriene. ❤",Writers_Revenge Gamer,2020-01-06T03:57:33Z,1

I feel like superhero powers have been activated inside of me! I really feel that energy loop coursing through my body. I am alive.<br /><br />I looked to see this time and 17,362 people and I were all doing yoga together around the world! WOW!! <br /><br />What a beautiful thing you have created, here. Thank you Adriene. Namaste.",Libby E,2020-01-06T03:50:46Z,1
"Hello, Adriene! I have a question for you: do you think the practices on this journey will become too intense as to not be beneficial to do them at night before sleep? Or do you think it doesn&#39;t matter doing it during the day or the night?<br />Loads of love!",joy,2020-01-06T03:50:26Z,0
Day 4✔...I was definitely sweating tonight but it felt amazing! I&#39;ve only been doing yoga consistently for 26 days and I absolutely love it.

I know that I need time to feel like myself again and I&#39;m gonna make it.

"HELLO! first of all - the new Benji in the corner icon is THE BEST. everyone should go watch the Good Morning America clip! Benji GOES IN on licking the host&#39;s face. he&#39;s usually so Zenned out during yoga, so the contrast was a delight. <br /><br />I practiced &quot;ACTIVATE&quot; this morning although I felt fuzzy and sluggish from the night before - so I felt a bit out of sorts and misaligned with the theme (at least in the AM). <br />this day brought some stressful situations. I was projecting some anxiety on to what should have been an occasion for joy (catch-up with friends); my best friend, who lives across the country, was going THROUGH a family crisis; my phone broke, which turned into a 2.5 hour ordeal at the Apple store; &amp; I missed my stop for the train, LOL. <br />when I got back, I was ready as hell to ride the Relaxi Taxi, and I got a little toasty, peeled myself an orange, cracked open a beer...and was about to get out my brand-spankin&#39;-new iPhone 8 to fiddle around, set things up (...and we all know how the spiral goes from there), when I thought... WAIT! Activate! <br /><br />so, with a little pause and with a little presence, I activated my choice to sit down to write this instead! <br /><br />It reminded me of the end of this practice, when Adriene is sending us off with her final message, then takes us into that last chair pose - a little push and, in reward, a generous surge of energy. <br /><br />...sort of like this! This reflective part has been super-fun and rewarding, as it gives me an opportunity to express myself and a fresh lens through which to view the day - I wasn&#39;t really intending to &quot;stay&quot; with the theme, but it popped up at just the right time, when I was making an &quot;easy,&quot; more unconscious choice that would have ended up with me feeling a bit &quot;blah&quot; and drained in the long run, especially as my relationship with the Internet and devices is a habit I&#39;m trying to manage (consumption vs. creation!). so often, it&#39;s the littlest things that can prevent us from starting (i.e. not taking my laptop out of the backpack), but once it&#39;s in motion, it&#39;s, like, oh, DUH!!! THIS IS WAY BETTER<br />(...aaaaand can still be enjoyed, even enhanced, with a lil bit o&#39; green, hops, n a healthy snack :)) <br /><br /><br />N A M A S T E to all, and to all a good night! <br /><br />(P.S. even with its mishaps, the day came with plenty of tiny blessings!)",Grace Kim,2020-01-06T03:32:16Z,0
"I almost didn&#39;t show up today. I was so distraught with what has been going on in India and the government just being mute spectators and enabling it, I felt mentally exhausted. I didn&#39;t want yoga today. But then I realised that&#39;s exactly why I should do it. And I was correct. Thank you for the peace you bring in our lives, Adriene. I just wish I am able to thank you enough someday, for everything good you bring in my life. Namaste.",Tanya Rawat,2020-01-06T03:25:59Z,0

"Day four - I have practiced yoga for at least 10 years, yet have never committed to any every day practice. At 63 I feel strong and even though yoga has changed me physically,  it saved my life and it has changed the way I do everything else in my life. Like showing up! And to always remember the breath. I have a lousy virus so it has been a challenge to start this 30 day journey yet I know it is part of my healing journey. My word for 2020 is to renew - Thank you Adriene for your gentle guidance and practice that will lead us into the unwritten pages of this year!  Namaste",Jane Henson,2020-01-06T03:22:53Z,0

"Hello Adriene. I&#39;m joining you on this 30 day yoga journey for the 3rd year in a row from Australia.

"Thank you, one thousand times over, for today&#39;s practice.<br /><br />This morning, I woke up to my mare lame from an abscess. While rushing out to get the means to begin treating it, the transmission crapped out on my car. Got that bandaided enough to get what I needed and get home... only to have the radiator go out, as well. Today did its absolute best to defeat me and I kept telling myself, &quot;It&#39;s okay to not knock out your to-do list. You did what you had to, and that&#39;s going to have to be enough.&quot;<br /><br />But then I thought about how I <b>can</b> control whether or not I show up to the mat. And so I did.<br /><br />This was the most peaceful, most fulfilling practice I&#39;ve had with you yet, and I kept thinking that it was because I was already so emotionally worn. But at the very end, when you said &quot;There will be bumps in the road on your way home,&quot; and then &quot;You have everything you need,&quot; the dam broke and I wept out what remained of today&#39;s tension all the way through our Namaste. <br /><br />I needed this, and you brought it to me.

They charge 15 dollars a class but allow the class to get so full that I can hardly move without hitting someone.

"Day 4 done and I can feel myself getting stronger with each day! I know that would not have been able to do this video on day 1, either due to mental or physical strength lacking but I feel like the journey is making me stronger, making me more capable. I can feel my muscles engaging more and can feel myself slowly getting the hang of things. I swear at one point, my hand had the weight distributed equally in the fingers instead of just in the wrist and it was such a small but significant thing to me. It means that my body is learning and adapting to do things to best help it and I just feel so proud of my hands haha",Emily Gleeson,2020-01-06T00:39:49Z,0
"As someone who hasn&#39;t ever been affected by the spiritual/emotional stuff of yoga everybody always talks about, I was shocked to notice right near the end of today&#39;s video (day late because timezones) brought up some thoughts that had me in tears. I think it was a good realization, and hopefully continuing this practice will help sort out more things.<br /><br />Thank you, Adrian, for making us all feel like a part of something, like you&#39;re personally welcoming us every time we open a video. I&#39;ve been watching you off n on for a good year or two, and I&#39;m really glad you&#39;ve touched so many people and gotten so much support.<br /><br />If I could ask a question for a moment, assuming that this won&#39;t be the last downward dog this month, how in the heck do you hold onto your mat? I don&#39;t know if mine is old or cheap or what, it seems rubbery-ish and my mom&#39;s mat feels the same, but my feet edge back and my hands slip; I have to grip the edges of it and dig in with my fingernails to feel secure. Could I be doing the pose wrong, or maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m overweight without much muscle? Any advice?",sunshine ley,2020-01-06T00:38:24Z,0

"As I rose to standing with my hands together at my heart, I could feel the prana pulsing through my being, my physical body shaking, my soul ignited, like a spark held to old kindling. A surge of emotion took over, and after taking in another deep breath, I surrendered to the emotion and began to cry.<br /><br />So there I am, body trembling, sobbing, breathing, being. For a moment, I was so caught up in this surge that I completely forgot about where I was and what I was doing. I cannot recall a time that I have felt alive in this way before. It stirred up an intriguing curiosity that I am so excited to explore. <br /><br />Tomorrow will mark my 250th consecutive day of YWA. My journey has been indescribable.

"Hi adriene. I can&#39;t do a forward fold  , it&#39;s more of a halfway fold for me. To practice forward fold, should I just bend the knees a bit until I can reach the floor and then sorta paddle it out?",Kas,2020-01-05T22:30:08Z,0
"I&#39;ve done yoga with several youtube channels, and some focus on the stretch, some focus on the journey to the pose, and I am getting more out of yours than the others - I think it&#39;s because you sometimes go very slowly from one pose to another, especially yesterday&#39;s.  When you move super slow, it&#39;s like you&#39;re getting the benefits of multiple poses in between each official pose - the muscles get more out of it, as do the joints.  It&#39;s like the super slow calisthenics, that takes real strength and control.  I used to not think I liked yoga instruction with the instructor talking during their own poses, but you have changed my mind.  Thank you for what you do, I am truly enjoying this series with you..... and last year, when I had massive wrist pain in the downward facing dog, one of your videos helped me position my hands more correctly so I could continue my practice.  You aren&#39;t just awesome today, you&#39;ve been awesome a long darn time.  Thank you from Tennessee.",Chickens Don't Surf,2020-01-05T22:28:55Z,2

An invitation to face old demons tucked away in the background of my mind, silently operating &amp; influencing my life. I&#39;m scared. When I stepped on the mat today, I was scared.

"I have been honoring some heavy emotions that came up since yesterday after I practiced and I just have to say, your work is so transformative Adriene! <br /><br />A romantic relationship I&#39;m having may be ending and we are currently taking space. In these situations I have been known to get down on myself even if I have done nothing wrong. This yoga is helping me surrender, to honor myself in my process by showing up for myself when it&#39;s difficult to do so. <br /><br />I&#39;m so grateful I have made the commitment to go on another 30 day journey with you and all those who have chosen the same commitment in the YWA community! I feel honored to be a part of a community where we can hold ourselves and each other accountable from a place of pure love and wanting to uplift collective energy! Thank you for helping me shine my brilliant light in dark places. Practices like these remind me that in times of darkness we need more love, not less. I have all the tools I need within but I wouldn&#39;t not have been able to access these tools if I hadn&#39;t found your channel nearly two years ago!

"Adriene! I became a member and used your videos everyday for four years but had to stop my daily practice about a year and a half ago due to chronic stress and pain that I had been attempting to force out of my body with physical practices. I still use your restorative and gentle videos often but have been afraid to do more for awhile, learning to go slow and really listen and care for my body. I decided to join the 30 Days this year even if I were just to show up and breathe and listen without actually following the physical asana... but I’ve been finding it’s possible to follow along so far. And today was the first time I’ve felt relatively safe “activating” anything. I don’t know if it’s  because of my new found ability to stop gripping, accept where I am and rest when I need or if you have mastered the ability to lead a class that feels both challenging and accessible (it was always that way but seems extra refined now). <br />Thank you so much for guiding us all to find home in this community and within ourselves.",Sara Hanlon,2020-01-05T19:49:07Z,0

"Had a bit of trouble &quot;gettin&#39; to it&quot; - a little procrastination perhaps...BUT I did it and YES I cried too! It was one of those &quot;I&#39;ve got this!&quot; moments.  I know many of you may be feeling the same. If there is one thing I&#39;ve learned from Adriene and one thing I know to be absolutely true:  Just...show...up!  Really, truly, it is that simple. If you just lay in Savasana and only listen, Just...Show...Up!  We all have the tools we need - we had them before we started and will continue to uncover them on the journey.  I know you may be achy in the shoulders or sore in the abs - the result of commitment in the days before.  This practice seems to loosen up those spots and makes you feel better then when you started.  It especially improves your mood!  As my Ayurveda Teacher once told me:  &quot;At some point you become tired of your own excuses&quot; (for why you can&#39;t... fill-in-the-blank). This is the mind controlling the body. It is only when you step back from that voice and view the thoughts as the observer of the thoughts, only then, despite the difficulty, can you do what you know in your heart to be true. Don&#39;t give up...don&#39;t give in....just...show...up! Namaste!",Tammy Doerrl,2020-01-05T19:32:12Z,0

"I&#39;ve been doing yoga for years and I&#39;d consider myself an intermediate level (if you&#39;re measuring by Western fitness standards, I suppose ... in the bigger scheme I&#39;d call myself a novice) ... and I love doing these 30-day series because YWA has taught me a lot about slowing down and listening. I used to be one of those &quot;show-off&quot; yoga class people who felt like I needed to do every pose &quot;right.&quot; I don&#39;t think about it like that at all anymore and I&#39;m truly grateful for the openness (in mind and body) I&#39;ve gained here. Today, I found something new in chair pose. I love that yoga is a never-ending exploration. And I love the idea that I&#39;m practicing with those who are totally new to this experience ...

I&#39;ve been doing body scan meditation and it reminded me of that as I look a breath, imaging the energy flowing from the toes to the head and breathing out as the energy flowed down.

"It&#39;s a miracle.. I&#39;ve got my boyfriend joining me every morning to do the 30 days. He NEVER does any sort of physical activity so it&#39;s amazing to find something he&#39;s willing to do. He&#39;ll even be the one to say first thing in the morning &quot;we doing this, or what?&quot;. My mind is blown, haha. He is far from flexible and his body creaks and cracks as he goes so it&#39;s definitely not easy for him but I hope he sees some changes after a month! It&#39;s been such a great new habit to start forming together. I really hope it lasts! Thank you so much for this!",Laura Napier,2020-01-05T19:22:04Z,0

"WOW! Just wow.  I started 30 days of yoga in mid December to get ready for this practice, so technically this was my 19th day of yoga with Adriene.  I can hardly believe how strong I am getting.

<b>Home - Day 4 :</b> Evening practice<br /><br />Showing up today was much easier than yesterday. I really needed to sweat it out. I think I had an anxiety attack a bit before the practice and it&#39;s funny that as soon as I identified the &quot;weird feeling&quot; I thought of your channel and that it&#39;s time for today&#39;s practice. <br /><br />Thank you again Adriene! Today&#39;s school-related stress and my long distance relationship&#39;s related anxiety? Sadness? Whatever that feeling was...

I have been living abroad for several years now and am finding myself in a relationship I&#39;m not sure I still want to be in, while taking back up hobbies and passions I excluded due to comprises I made in this relationship - and everything within me keeps telling me to go back home. So when you talk about a &quot;journey home&quot; it affects me on just so many levels... Hopefully these 30 days will help me find my way back home to myself and provide insight on how to solve these issues. Thank you Adriene.",Julia F.,2020-01-05T18:42:50Z,0

"This practice helped activate the soreness from the practices the last few days. I also got to pay attention to how activating poses like lunge are. I sometimes just fly into these poses but when you pay attention to the energy going up from the front, and down to the back, from ground to up, there is this expansion I feel when tuning into that flow. There is also a transformation in my energetic body that I get to take with me when I step off the mat.",Terence,2020-01-05T16:50:58Z,0

"Day 4 is done and my head cold is clearing up! I really loved today&#39;s practice. I started yoga about 3 years ago with a trauma-sensitive class specific to survivors of sexual assault. I was very uncomfortable at first, but the class was so compassionate and kind (the teacher reminds me of you, Adriene!) that I stuck through the discomfort.

"Today I feel much more awake moving into Day 4. One known tenet, that I had not necessarily forgotten, but has definitely been dormant within myself for much too long, was love. Instead, despite many achievements in the past several years, I consistently began to loathe aspects of myself. Like how long it would take to get things done, how forgetful I was getting, how much of my time was being used up. It was a slow process that took me out of myself, and then I would look in the mirror and be shocked at what I saw. Yesterday I awakened and remembered that loathing activates sickness and pain, whereas actively loving brings healing and well- being. So that is how I entered today’s practice! From the first focused breath I activated the energy slowly and lovingly to each joint and muscle! The pace was precisely what I needed and the instruction was wonderful! My mind still likes to think that I can do, what I could do, just four years ago when I was very fit! Remembering and practicing the beginning forms is what will strengthen me and build the flexibility I need. That is what will actively get me to where I want to be. Just yesterday I would have loathed not being able to keep up in high lunge. But today, staying in low lunge, I lovingly focused on breath and form to activate a positive flow of energy within myself and healing. Thank you Adriene!",Sandra Nadeau,2020-01-05T16:25:50Z,0

My mind was just observing, not directing.  It was such a magical moment as though my body was waking up after a long slumber.  Thank you.",Jennifer Corwin,2020-01-05T16:19:47Z,0

Day 4 Activate.  This was a hard concept for me as activate usually meant that something bad was going to happen and I needed to prepare which always meant holding my breath.  I had to focus so hard to breath to support not hold my breath to protect.  A lot to unpack after this practice. Thank you for this practice today!,Amanda Mott,2020-01-05T15:31:10Z,0

"literally i just got home from outside meeting a very good friend of mine.I am base in shanghai, china and now it is 11:25pm in the night. i should be in bed already but I can&#39;t skip any of the yoga practice with YWA community. it&#39;s basically my everyday thing now unless i am really really feeling sick or if i am on my period. otherwise i just get it done. PS. to be fair, i usually just do it in the morning as early as possible. but knowing the  fact the home series this time designed to be upload each video after central time which in China time is every day after 2pm. so sometimes if i am out and come back late then this is how late i manage to do.",Linda Zhang,2020-01-05T15:28:02Z,0
"The feeling and image of energy traveling up the front of my body and down the back and around again is going to stay with me. It&#39;s a powerful, and, yes, activating, feeling to be the center of that flowing energy. Thank you for that and all of it.<br /><br />During the last mountain pose, I heard in my head Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz saying, &quot;There&#39;s no place like home.&quot; Then I realized how appropriate for this 30 day Home practice that my husband, daughter and I began the new year by starting to watch Wizard of Oz 19 1/2 minutes before midnight so that when Dorothy opens to the door to her house that has just landed in Oz and the film transitions from black and white to color would happen just as the new year/new decade began. It felt like a good way to symbolize the optimism I want to embrace about this new year. I didn&#39;t think about it at the time that the message of the film is that what you&#39;re searching for was right in front of you all the time. A very yoga, very Yoga with Adriene, kind of message. So, thank you for another wonderful day of yoga, Adriene and everyone else sharing the journey.",jonorry,2020-01-05T15:27:59Z,0

"My exercise induced asthma really started getting the best of me during the taller warrior poses. Instead of gritting through and probably starting an asthma attack, I released, sat on the mat, and put my health first and directed my energy to connect with my breath. I always feel silly to not push through something, but this time I let my pride go and listened to my body. Thank you Adrienne for validating that sometimes all you can do is breathe. ❤ learning to forgive myself for my short comings, and to stop the constant push for excellence is an obstacle I didn&#39;t know I would face in the first hour of my day. Thank you for your warm heart and validating that it&#39;s ok to listen and just breathe ❤",Tory Pisarek,2020-01-05T14:56:55Z,0

Never flowed into a chaturanga with this much ease and confidence before :) I&#39;ve also started to become more playful at transitions.

"There are so many comments already expressing how I feel about this practice today, but as we&#39;re encouraged to make our practice our own, I&#39;m going to make my comment my own too. :) <br />From a physical standpoint, this was a wonderful practice. Loved the pace, loved the moved, loved that I had to pause it midway through to take off the sweatshirt I was wearing. <br />And from an emotional standpoint, I love that I can laugh and cry through the course of almost every one of these videos. <br />I can&#39;t remember right now what it was that made me laugh... But it was &quot;like you love yourself&quot; made me cry.  That&#39;s what this season is for me... Acting like I love myself. Pretending, trying, practicing to love myself. And most days I still don&#39;t... But there&#39;s a glimmer. And that&#39;s what I&#39;m here for. The hope. <br /><br />Thanks Adriene. 😊🇺🇲",Megan Amato,2020-01-05T14:11:54Z,2

"Day 4 and this is where it starts to get tough to maintain the discipline for daily practice. I&#39;d like to offer this tip to the community. I have two yoga practice times scheduled in my day. Plan A yoga is first thing in the morning when I wake up. This works perfectly well most days. Then there are the times I get in bed late, I have to get the car to the mechanic at 7am, my cat wakes me up three times in a night.... you know how it goes. That&#39;s when I go to Plan B yoga. The window of time that works for me is 4-5 in the afternoon after I finish work but before I have to start dinner. I don&#39;t schedule any appointments during this time and I arrange my schedule to have that time open. If I missed am yoga, I have this backup plan. Bonus for me is that if I have done my morning yoga, I gain this nice space to read, garden, craft, call a friend, or (let&#39;s be honest) troubleshoot some daily crisis, which is a great motivator to do morning yoga!

It was rough this morning a bit because I was determined to get up early no matter what and I was a bit tired but I moved purposely, slowly, and carefully and I made it through.  That is what was Activated for me this day, sticking to it and making it through, and I feel better in the end.

Good morning from London 🙂<br />I usually do my Yoga in the evening but at weekends I start with it into the day.

"When you said “Stand up nice and tall like you love yourself“ with such a sympathetic and sweet voice I felt bliss, I actually felt that love and appreciation for my body and myself, and that made me to broke into tears of joy. It can be so hard to feel that way when you come from a place of anxiety and constant self deprecation. But it’s a process, like you said, and every time I will find myself talking in a cruel way to myself I will return back to that memory of bliss and understanding. <br />Thank you so much for this, and a big hello from Bologna - Italy to all the amazing people all around the world keeping me company with today’s practice!!!!

"Day 4/30 <br />Activate - It&#39;s almost 5am here in Texas, and I just noticed something about my body. Before I say what I&#39;ve noticed, I should mention something else. I&#39;m 23 years young and I have Fibromyalgia. When I was 14 years old, I started getting sick not knowing. Experiencing so much pain and being completely clueless to what was going on. I didn&#39;t get diagnosed until I was about 20 years young. That being said, this morning, I woke up and noticed my posture. I usually have this bump in my neck (fwd neck). I&#39;ve had it for a very long time, but it&#39;s less noticeable now. I feel taller, like my crown is lifting higher. Less collapsing on my chest and ribs. <br />I know it&#39;s because of Yoga with Adriene. I will continue my journey with you all because I want to see how my body will continue to reform itself throughout this &quot;challenge&quot;. <br />Thank you, Adriene and fellow yogis. <br />Love and light from South Texas. &lt;3",Lizzie Dawn,2020-01-05T10:58:47Z,44

Only discovered the lovely Adriene in December 2019 but already hooked.  It is really helping me here in London.

"Really nice activation this morning, Adriene!!! What is more, today&#39;s practice really made me smile since, last night, I spoke to my sister and, for certain reasons, our main subject was the breath. You&#39;re anxious or nervous or upset: Breathe! You&#39;re on your bike, on the run, hiking up a mountain: Breathe! You&#39;re struggling with a demanding asana: Breathe! And, in those moments, always try and do it consciously!! It makes all the difference!! And there you are, today, setting the focus on the breath! What a lovely coincidence!! :-)<br />I really love the journey &quot;home&quot; so far! Thank you so much for it and: Namasté!!",Uli Trost,2020-01-05T10:28:20Z,0

"I lost my Nan-in-Law in July last year, the day after her funeral I found out my other half has cancer and I lost my amazing Dad last November. The grieve is unbearable but these videos are helping me process my emotions and to be kind to myself. I wish I could do more than say thank you. Yoga has shown me my inner strength and that I have a positive spirit even through tough times. Once again THANK YOU Adriene 🙏😍",Claire Miller,2020-01-05T09:04:49Z,30

"Adriene, I came to the mat with grief today, and not so easily tbh. While I was doing the day 3 yesterday, we lost our dear cat, Lokum, to a heart attack. And it was only when I finished and took off my earphones that I realized it with my sister’s cry from the other room.. He has been sick for two months, but was improving according to what the vet said the day before. There’s no easier way of losing a loved one, even if they’re an 11 yo cat. The best pal to my sister and all of us, the spirit of the house.. I’m trying to be my sister’s rock, always at her beck and call rn. However, I’m mourning too, and I wanna thank you for being my rock♥️ even if it was really hard to return to the mat today, after missing his last moments while I was on the mat yesterday, I’m trying hard to avoid the guilt and letting yoga heal me. Thank you and lots of love...",Işık Büyükçelik,2020-01-05T08:26:32Z,0

"I&#39;m so sorry for your loss... it&#39;s always hard to lose someone you love. Continue mourning as long as you have to. Honour and cherish the moments you have had with them... but don&#39;t feel guilty. I know you must have wanted to spend those last moments with your cat, but you didn&#39;t know in advance that these would be their last minutes. Forgive yourself.  Why don&#39;t you dedicate your next couple of practices to your cat? That way you can send a little extra love, gratitude, peace and energy to yourself, your sister, your cat whenever you step on your mat.  Might be a silly suggestion, but it was the first thing that came into my mind.. Sending a little bit of extra love in these difficult times. 💜 Take care.",Phoebe Summer,2020-01-05T08:56:46Z,1

"Day 4: As I carry out this practice at &quot;HOME&quot;, I feel rejuvenated. I came on the mat, lied down, and realized I&#39;m a little sore today. YAY! I take that as a sign that my body is reacting to the 3 days of practice. Yet, it didn&#39;t hinder today&#39;s practice. But, I also realized that my thoughts were wandering. I wasn&#39;t as focused today as I was yesterday. Tomorrow being Monday, my mind was already planning all the tasks that I need to do. But, by the end of it, I was able to close my mind. Not in the sense that I would forget my goals for tomorrow, but for now to put them on the side and to commit to today&#39;s practice and be present on the mat. I am thankful for this :).

My Obstetrics and Gynecology theory finals tomorrow. I am not halfway done. I had studied everything beforehand but I don&#39;t seem to remember anything at all. I have been cramming for the past three days and I have about ten hours of cramming to do. This yoga break is so much looked forward to. <br />This whole month will be an exam month and I am glad Adrienne is here to help me see it through.<br />I will be a doctor after this and hopefully I pass.,Epshita Manashi,2020-01-05T06:16:26Z,5

On Day 1 of this journey I felt annoyed and had to force myself to come to practice, on day 2 I felt better on the mat and more connected, on day 3 I wished practice went longer and I know day 4 will be amazing (writing this before I do it!)
