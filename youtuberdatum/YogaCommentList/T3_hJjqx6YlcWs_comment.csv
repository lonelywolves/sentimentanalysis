"Hi Adriene! I&#39;m really enjoying your yoga. You have a very soothing voice to listen to and that&#39;s important when practicing yoga. I have a question for you. You said in one of your videos that you are from Austen, Texas so I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s where you&#39;re taping from with your 30 day challenge.

"regarding what you were saying about the breath: i recently finished your first 30 day series from six years ago before beginning this one. the first thing i noticed when i began this one was how much your voice dropped, which i would attribute to the practice with the breath and relaxing of the muscles around it. it would seem you have leveled up üòä",Joel Vining,2021-05-06T20:13:25Z,0

"Day 3 complete, yay! This practice was exactly what I needed today. I am in a period of transition in my life, where my fear of letting people in is slowly slipping away and I am letting go of my past neuroses, negative thoughts, and loneliness. With this new openness and connectedness I am experiencing comes an officious voice of dread that says I will never be good enough for any of it. New experiences and new people are coming into my life, which I am so grateful for, but at the same time it all strikes a familiar fear into my heart and the urge to perform for these people or things, or to cower away from them, often comes to the surface.<br /><br />Spending this time on the mat, connecting with my breath, feeling the energy flow within me and really paying attention to the nuances within my body, and knowing that others are on a similar, beautiful journey, all helps me to realise the weight of what I&#39;ve carried throughout my life and what I no longer need to carry. Thank you, Adriene, for your amazing presence here and for this soul-serving series!<br /><br />P.S. I am really excited to listen to your upcoming conversation with Russell Brand!",H Spikey,2021-04-30T09:03:18Z,0

I felt an overwhelming feeling that it&#39;s ok to love yourself, even while I&#39;m so imperfect in so many ways, it&#39;s ok to love myself and be kind to myself.<br /><br />Then... when she talked about the miniscule muscles we&#39;re are using with our breath... it reminded me of the lesson on cells I was giving to my kids... how we have trillions of tiny cells composing our body, little universes within my body working hard to give me life and energy... and I felt grateful for all the hard work, all the life, all the joy, all the stretching and reaching in the middle of the opposition of life that my body has given.<br />And I thought... it&#39;s ok to love my body... <br />Not like I love my body because of whatever shape it&#39;s in(which is fine), but I love it because of everything it gives me and does for me. Constantly.<br /><br />See. It&#39;s not just a physical workout. It&#39;s something more. And I&#39;m incredibly grateful for that.",Andrea Hill,2021-03-12T16:52:54Z,0

"I find the ujjayi breath sound very distracting instead of anchoring, but in its place I focus on &quot;clean&quot; breath and the rolling movement of my body, and find an amazing connection to my body&#39;s energy in that. Focusing more on my chest&#39;s movement rather than the throat / inhalation also helps me make my breath more natural too, as I usually breath at a different rate to Adriene!!

"What I love about home practice in general and Adriene specifically is that it&#39;s ok if I can&#39;t do the whole routine some days.  My knees aren&#39;t great, and some days the lunges are too much and I sit on the mat and do ground poses until we can &quot;meet&quot; in a pose I&#39;m feeling up to.  I like Adriene because she reinforces that idea of &quot;do what you can, and listen to yourself.&quot;  There&#39;s definitely a place for a motivational &quot;push push push&quot; instructor, but that&#39;s just not what I&#39;m looking for!",Shadlyn,2021-01-14T23:01:47Z,0

When you sit on blanket or block cross legged to breathe and relax, my hips are screaming.  Can you suggest some alternatives besides getting up and sitting in a chair?  I can do that but it doesn&#39;t help loosen my hips.   Ouch is all I can think.",Dee B,2021-01-14T16:07:03Z,1

I love yoga with my whole heart and it does wonders for me, but I (silently and slowly) injured my hamstrings years ago in high school when I first started my practice. I thought I was much more bendy than I was. I now have high hamstring tendinopathy (pretty much tendinitis where my hamstring inserts into my glute). I am on Day 3 and I can&#39;t do a forward fold comfortably without pain. Does anyone have any remedies for this or has anyone experienced this?

"Thank you, thank you, thank you Adriene!!! I am on a healing journey, have been for about 5 or so years. I was relinquished for adoption at birth. This trauma and the subsequent trauma of being placed into a new and different family impacted me spiritually, physically, and emotionally. My body has stored that trauma until now. My adoptive parents chose to not tell me about being adopted because they said I was a very sensitive child. They had 2 biological children right after I was placed with them. They did not wish for me to feel less loved and wanted than my brother and my sister. But even though I did not have the knowledge of my relinquishment or my adoption, my body knew.  A confusing place to be for sure. At 20 years old I accidentally found out that I was adopted. The impact of this knowledge is difficult to describe. Honestly, for the next 25 years I think I was in shock from this new information about myself and my reality. Denial is a powerful thing, it was my native language. Anyway, recently I have been working with a somatic experience therapist trying to learn how to be more &quot;in my body.&quot; I was completely disconnected from my body, my feelings, and my self. She is an incredibly gifted therapist and has helped me tremendously in learning how to experience my feelings that I have always up until about 5 years ago kept numb because I did not think I could feel them and survive. SE therapy and yoga (with breath work and mindfulness) have changed my life. As an adoptee, being in my body has always felt unsafe. I am slowly learning how and experiencing being grounded and growing in feeling safe. The slow, gentle, patient, and endearing way that you lead yoga is enabling me to actually feel relaxed in my body. Hyper-vigilance is one more gift that my relinquishment gave to me. I have tried so many different ways to not hold my breath and my body so tense, but I have had no success until yoga. But who you are and how you speak and what you draw attention to is like magic. It truly is a balm and an aide assisting my body to not hold the tension. Thank you.",authenticity 68,2021-01-07T06:49:53Z,1

It felt good but I have been wondering if this is safe way to do it or the correct way to do it idk.

"Today&#39;s anchoring meant to reach my thoughts to the breath every moment, like acknowledging it. Also introduced Ujjayi breath, deep breathing with lips closed, which the sound of exhaling is like the sound of the ocean.

"I&#39;ve done several of the 30-day yoga journey (always started but never finished) and although it&#39;s only day 3, I&#39;m feeling SO positive about this time, and this is definitely my favorite bit of yoga videos so far! The breathing exercises are SO helpful and I think really making the most difference in my practice. Even though I&#39;ve been practicing syncing breath + movement, these videos thus far have been so so clear and helpful to finally feel like I&#39;m finding that synchronization. Thanks for making such stellar videos, Adriene!",Emma Bauer,2021-01-06T03:22:19Z,0

The only input I have: In the beginning of the videos, where we should arrive and focus on our breath and settle in, it is really hard to actually be still and focus on the breath with so much vocal input from you. Everything you say is good input but at the same time it gives almost no time to relax and focus on the breath.

"Namaste Adriene! I feel so happy to have learned this new Ujjayi breath from you. At first, I felt that I could not get it, but I kept practising. Also, I watched your recommended video to learn more before today‚Äôs class, which helped (practise before practise, lol). <br /><br />My Ujjayi breath with my mouth closed was quite exaggerated, and I made all kinds of odd sounds, including a gurgling sound in the back of my throat. Then, I realized that maybe I was trying too hard (a usual problem for me, along with forgetting to breath). So my breath became a whisper soft form of Ha, of the way that I did it with my mouth open. I felt so gently happy with this outcome. üòä <br /><br />I also found your visual of my breath fogging up a window when my mouth was open, with a heart drawn on the glass, to be so appealing. It became a good visual image and memory cue for me, for how I could make it happen again, once I caught on. So I mentally repeated this, a few times. <br /><br />Also, it was a great challenge for me, to sync up the breath with movement. So in order to keep my focus on new breath going as much as possible, I found that I need to do the movements very gentle today. Which was good as I am sore and tired. I also incorporated many mods, inspired by all the wonderful modification advice, kindly posted by people who took yesterday‚Äôs class.

"First, these sessions have been incredibly helpful for me as I have chronic joint pain (gout) at the young age of 29 and so these have been helping me stay fit while not putting to much pain on my joints. I have really enjoyed doing them everyday. <br />Second, for the ocean breath, are you breathing through your mouth with tightly pursed lips or your nose? I was having issues following along past that point.",Ethan Scott,2021-01-05T05:28:16Z,0

After yesterday&#39;s practice, I shared with friends the importance of returning to ones breath when your mind/body are fighting poses - it&#39;s like I knew what today&#39;s session would hold! I find that asking Google home to play ocean sounds as I practice really helps with Ujjayi breathing. You always know just what we need. Thank you for seeing us through the beginning of 2021!

"I can totally relate. I started doing Yoga last year and I started with another of the 30day challenges with Adriene and I could only do 10 to 15 min of practice. <br />I dont know if this helps you but what I did was take breaths. I would pause to video and take 5 long breaths. When it felt my body just couldnt do it any longer I stopped and promise myself to come back another day and finish it. This practices have been long but something that could help when there are short practices is complement the practice with one from Adriene&#39;s foundations series so you can better understand the pose. <br />Also if you dont want to quit the video you can stop when your body is done and wait in corpse pose to the end. The important thing is to show up, as she says, is to get your body to the mat cause with just that movement you are fullfiling your commitment to your body. <br />I hope this aids you a little going forward and it isnt to preachy. I just relate cause I literally didnt do any type of movement before this.",Paulina Ortiz,2021-01-05T01:48:04Z,0

"As always, thank you for this lovely practice. For anyone like me who has asthma, Ujjayi breath can be a little helpful at slowing and potentially preventing an oncoming asthma attack when it&#39;s triggered by activity. When I hike, I always make sure I have my inhaler handy (as you should too!) -- but I have noticed that if I start to struggle with breath on a steep incline, I can stop and often calm my lungs down until I can get a full breath again, using Ujjayi breath. Something to try and see if it helps you too. (Obviously, you know your own asthma and if you are past the point of no return, use the inhaler or get help! But using this technique may help you, as it&#39;s helped me, to reduce my inhaler needs.)",Valerie Fenton,2021-01-05T01:16:19Z,0

"Here&#39;s how Ujjayi breath changed my life. Because of my deviated septum I used to have a cold every winter, several times a year actually. And I was used to struggle with breathing during very hot, humid summers, and when doing exercise, and when it was cold and...well, you get the gist. Since I started practicing Ujjayi breath I slowly ceased to have all these issues. I haven&#39;t had a cold in two years now, and every time I find myself struggling with breathing I turn to Ujjayi and it literally opens my lungs and nasal cavity. Where lots of medicines and thermal baths failed, simple breathing made it.",GiudittaVonKleist,2021-01-04T23:19:57Z,0

"During day 1 and 2, I found it difficult for me to really take deep breaths and focus on my movement and breath, because I&#39;ve been going through a lot of anxiety and OCD and my mind couldn&#39;t help but wander into dark places, no matter how hard I tried to focus on the practice. When breathing in, it felt like I was stuck at a certain point, as if my body or mind didn&#39;t allow me to breathe in any further. Today I still had troubling thoughts but felt much lighter when stepping onto the mat. I really loved that we were practicing ocean breath today because it was new to me and I focused on it much more. I smiled a lot throughout the practice. By the end of the video,  I was able to take the longest breath I&#39;ve taken for quite some time now, I think. I was surprised how I wasn&#39;t stuck at a certain point and instead really felt the air I was soaking in through my entire body.

"Got to say I was not looking forward to another longer one today lol really wanted a short and sweet one today .....but wow this was wonderful and it hit all the feels for me. Got me sweating and saying a little &#39;oh come on adriene&#39; at the screen when holding those planks lol but wow that breath work in this one was exactly what I needed !!!! And this one actually ended up feeling short cause I was so concentrated and just really in the ZONE with the breath ! Gotta say first 2 weren&#39;t my fav but thats mostly my fault for letting myself sary off my mat for months so I am out of shape and with chronic back pain it feels extra hard but I&#39;m determined I&#39;m going to get back what I once had ...the strength   the flexibility, the breath...all the things AND hope its therapeutic for my pain again once I&#39;m past the really hard begining! This one was spot on and just what I needed to tell my mind we got this, even when my body is screaming no we dont üòâ I can do this!!!! <br />And also it really is something to check numbers when I start video and again when I&#39;m done. LOVE the idea that I just did this with 20,000 others around the world! This 35 year old lady from Ontario Canada is waving at the rest of yas saying we got this WOO HOO!!!!

I started a daily practice with Adriene over three months ago just after my cough showed up, and within a few weeks, the cough was gone with no sign of it since! I spoke to my doctor about it and she believes that all the breath work Adriene has taught me basically worked as therapy on my lungs. She got incredibly excited to recommend this to other patients, and is going to start doing yoga with Adriene herself. I&#39;m so grateful for this practice for so many reasons but I wanted to share this one small thing that has made such a big difference in my quality of life.

"Day 3: oh, this one felt GOOD.<br /><br />I had to stop and start three different times during the first eight minutes of practice because of other things going on, and even as I was finally settling in, I found myself wondering, am I going to manage to keep focus at all?  And then I started picturing the ocean.<br />Keeping focus is SO HARD for me with yoga sometimes!  I can take my body through the movements, but being present in the moment is so difficult.  But today, I found myself visualizing some combination of every beach I&#39;ve ever visited in my life, the swell of waves up and down, for the whole practice.  Sometimes I was still as a rock with the waves crashing around me.  Sometimes I was laying on the beach listening.  Sometimes I was the water.  But it WORKED.  I was here with the practice rather than off in my head churning over anxieties or other things, not distracting myself by focusing too much on Trying To Focus.  Things flowed together.  I didn&#39;t keep getting messed up because Adriene&#39;s breathing rhythm was slightly different than my own, because it was easy to picture the ocean just changing tempo a little and flowing with it.  I kept plank pose way easier than usual (way longer than yesterday!) because I wasn&#39;t concentrating on trying SO HARD to keep all my muscles in place, I was just being a steady pier surrounded by water.<br /><br />Heck.  If I can keep remembering this technique, I think I can DO this.",Clarity C,2021-01-04T17:10:26Z,0

"So... I have this anxiety when it comes to audible breath. I think it started when I was a kid and I was a mouth breather LOL. My anxiety got worse  when I went into theatre school and all we did for the first year was focus on the breath. Theatre school was a competitive environment and I would constantly perform with my breath, because well... it was theatre school. Anywho! What Adriene said about the Ocean Breath not about performing, it really resonated with me. I find that I perform for others and myself a bunch. So to allow myself to find this time to let that go was so satisfying, albeit scary. Thank you for this wonderful day three. Can&#39;t wait for tomorrow!",Lisa Alves,2021-01-04T16:35:12Z,0

"Hey Adriene, <br /><br />Long time viewer of yours but recently something has been brought to my attention. Yoga being ‚Äútaught‚Äù by white people is cultural appropriation. I‚Äôm ashamed to say that I wasn‚Äôt aware of this until today and I haven‚Äôt been able to put my phone down since I came to this realization because I am having one consistent thought continuously swirling around in my mind ‚Äúhow did I not know this sooner.‚Äù My phone is no longer being used today for social media, calls, or texts, I‚Äôm using my phone today to start on my research journey of yoga and cultural appropriation specifically, in the United States. I encourage you to do some thinking and research on this topic yourself being that you have such a large platform with SO many viewers and subscribers. I am concerned that your not aware of this and I hope I can raise awareness by typing out this comment to you. It‚Äôs my job as a white person to raise awareness to other white people...it‚Äôs your job as well. I really hope you read this.",Lexi Marie,2021-01-04T16:33:12Z,0

Most importantly, I loved practicing Ujjayi breath, which is something I do naturally and unknowingly. When you talked about taking fewer breaths but extending the inhalation and exhalation, I thought: &quot;Yes!&quot; This is also what I started doing recently, as I&#39;m working on stress management and trauma recovery.

This is the first time I am trying to do the the 30 day series in 30 days. I am really enjoying it but my wrists are not. I have had problems with my wrists and elbows before. Today I could not do all the downward facing dog poses. I took breaks and modified a little. Any suggestions for the days to come?  I am afraid if it gets worse I won‚Äôt be able to continue. üôÅ,Sarah Dolislager,2021-01-04T14:58:37Z,0
"Thank you so much for your encouragement!  I, too, will spend time in child pose instead of downward facing dog to give my wrists a break. I will remind myself to show up and breathe.",Sarah Dolislager,2021-01-04T17:27:48Z,0
"I&#39;m by no means an expert, but I do have trouble with my wrists and now shoulder due to injury and what has worked for me is to try the pose as is first then modify as my body tells me it&#39;s approaching its limit. I&#39;ve spent many times in child pose as a result or doing plank with my knees down. But with time, my wrists have slowly gotten stronger. I always modify as a general rule to meet my body where it is, but this series specifically is excellent for mods because the focus is the breath. So I figure as long as I&#39;m breathing and staying in my body, it&#39;s OK if some days I spend the entire practice in child pose and mountain pose. As cliche as it sounds, the point really is the journey. Hope you are able to continue yours. Sending lots of positive healing vibes to you.",gtrisha,2021-01-04T15:16:01Z,1

"Is there a foundations of ‚Äúcomfortable seat‚Äù.  Even seated on a blanket, it is not comfortable in my hips.",Gina A,2021-01-04T13:00:28Z,0
"It took me a really long time to become comfortable sitting on the floor and occasionally my back is still unhappy about it. On those days, I simply lay down instead (there&#39;s also the option to sit on a chair/couch, though I personally prefer to keep close to the mat).  <br /><br />But generally, I think it just takes the body some getting used to (and the more flexible I get with yoga, the more comfortable it is as well). <br /><br />It might be helpful to begin each session with a bit of sitting so your body can start getting used to it, then transition to lying down when it gets too uncomfortable. From there, you can increase the amount of time you stay in a seat each day.",Nikki E,2021-01-04T13:49:06Z,1

"Adriene I love using the Ujjayi breath, it‚Äôs something I use often to focus on my practice or even in bed to get to sleep, counting 5 in, pausing, then 7 out, better than counting sheep üòÇ. I notice as we go through Day 3, we are slowly building on the previous days, adding a little more and gaining strength. As we flow through those vinyasas, I think it‚Äôs perfectly ok for us senior yogis and maybe some less able, to use elbows and knees to help us transition through. I made it fine and my cobras are improving. Instead of feeling hopeless it makes me feel positive and satisfied. Early days, but we can do this, each day an adventure.

"Although I was intrigued by yoga for years, several trials of intimidating military-drill-style power classes, parades of fancy yoga merch and eye contact avoidance left me feeling I just wasn&#39;t cut out. I tried Adriene&#39;s videos in April 2020 as an attempt solely to address back pain which was becoming a constant. Yoga then felt like a doorway to joy in being in a way I never thought was possible for me. It has helped to foster an openness and flexibility of mind beyond ideas of fitness and strength. A real game-changer. So so grateful &lt;3",Salma Hassan,2021-01-04T08:46:08Z,41

"The first day was pretty challenging for me. I was having a really hard time synchronizing my breath to my movements and also to the video (I think because of my asthma; my lungs felt constantly full so my inhales were too short and my exhales were too long; so my mouvement was always shifted from the rhythm of the video, which I know I&#39;m not bound to following but it was still very unsettling). Yesterday was a little better but I still felt really frustrated because I couldn&#39;t do the entire practice (tight schedule). Today, however was great. Ujjayi breath is a great great tool that I haven&#39;t had the occasion to really dive into (pun intended) despite the fact that I&#39;m not so new to the practice (good reminder of how we always, always have something to learn). <br />Anyways! This was long! Thank you for your time if you&#39;ve read this far. <br />Thank you Adriene for this yummy practice.

"@Natalie Passant I&#39;m sorry to hear that, that must be very scary and frustrating for her, and you. I started a bit ago and early on was consistently going into child&#39;s pose as the movements would advance or sometimes on even basic maneuvers as I built my strength. No shame in taking a moment. I never pushed unless I was ready and tried to remain patient as I grew. Given all my aches and pains, sometimes hidden also, I have been having to learn my body and finding its weaknesses. My hips and joints are very tight and the nerves love to say hello in each session. The good news is in time for me I&#39;ve seen myself grow stronger, less muscle spasms, nerve reactions, and soreness. My only advice is for her not to push anything that isn&#39;t comfortable and allow her body to speak to her comfort. Chiropractic adjustments have helped as well in realignment on areas that have had years of abuse, especially my sciatica and low back. Good luck and I hope the practice helps in time.
