"Adriene, I did this practice a year ago and see that your name is spelled wrong.  That disappoints me to know that I take pride in trying to spell your name correctly, due to Cathy and Catherine commonly getting spelled with a K, but that’s not the way I spell it.  For that , I apologize. No need to obsess over it, Cathy!  Loved this practice as I saw progress in myself, although balance is something that I will always have difficulty.  Just as you say, some days my balance capabilities are very pleasing but other days, not so much.  ❤️🙏",cathy hollaway,2021-04-03T15:56:11Z,3

"Had a pretty rough morning today and wasn&#39;t feeling the best about myself and my body (adolescence has its interesting ways of interrupting my daily mood) and these 36 minutes really rebirthed me. It amazes me how much yoga manages to sink deeper and deeper into my consciousness with every practice. A few years ago it meant nothing but (and excuse my language) half-assed movement, but as I matured so did my approach to this art. I still have a long way ahead of me, but I am so glad to see how attached I am getting to something that I used to not understand.  It gives me a sense of belief that yoga is something that grows with me, not a habit, duty, or task. And oh, how lovely it is to look forward to something that helps your body and mind grow healthier and stronger!<br />Hope everyone had an amazing practice!! And to all my April renew friends, we got his!",Una Stanković,2021-04-03T10:04:07Z,34

Thank you Adrienne.  You&#39;re incredible.  I love how calm and peaceful you are all the time while doing these videos.  I was in the dark dark place last January and I found your YouTube videos on anxiety and depression and those videos changed my life and my future.  Now I am in the light and I inspire others to live a healthy balanced lifestyle with your yoga practice.  Great work.  One day I would love to practice yoga with you in person and tell you in person what an amazing life I have thanks to you.,Margaret Evolve,2020-09-03T00:16:38Z,0

"wow, this was just absolutely perfect for today. My whole life I have struggled with body acceptance and was just feeling so mad today to the point of tears about all that diet culture has taken from me in my lifetime and am really feeling ready to let go of the expectations I have put on my body. I decided to do yoga while feeling like this just to help give me time to process and I&#39;m so glad I picked this practice cause it was just perfect.",Liz F,2020-09-01T23:28:26Z,1
"I just love your opening video to all of your practices. You in your black outfit (on the green mat) reminds me so much of photos I&#39;ve seen of my Mom when she was young (in her one piece bathing suit). You have a bit of a nostalgic look there. Since my Mom passed away about 7 years ago, it is a daily reminder of her and brings a smile to my face every time :) Thank you Adriene for this lovely practice today.

"Alright, time for my first comment after almost two months of doing yoga with you every day. The first weeks you were my only safe place, as my anxiety attacks were at their worst. When even eating was a struggle, you got me back to daily routine, back to wanting to get up and do something everyday. So thank you so so much. I love you and everyone in these comments, they&#39;ve been an enormous help too. <br /><br />But today especially I felt some need to tell you how much of an impact you&#39;ve had on my life and my body. Yesterday I did the &#39;Yoga for Stress&#39; since, well, you know. I got SO frustrated, almost angry at myself during that practise; I couldn&#39;t  hold still and everything just felt like exploding. And I saw that as a good thing, since almost all my normal emotions have been pretty much absent. Today though, I woke up with the weirdest pain on my right side skin. It was like someone had punched me but there wasn&#39;t any visible signs of injury. And I got anxious again. And came back to my daily practise, to this video. Half way through, I realised something; the pain was fading. I felt like crying, and I did. You are literally a healer, a medicine, and I&#39;m so grateful – thank you Adriene.",Mari,2020-08-19T17:51:47Z,2

"I loved this practice.  I&#39;ve been doing your classes since April during the pandemic and my body, mind, and spirit crave them everyday.  I used to teach back in the early 2000s and have since had rotator cuff surgery and a hip replacement.  I was a little nervous that I wouldn&#39;t be able to do the yoga, then I took my first YWA class and I was (am) hooked.  So many people post about all the good you are doing and I am now one of them!  You are amazing and are making a difference in so many people&#39;s lives.

Loved doing this on Sunday afternoon in the backyard. I  particularly love whispering &quot;I am strong&quot; in plank when feeling ... kinda not. But the best parts are being in bridge and lifting chest to chin and chin to sky when all I can see is blue sky... and of course that beautiful guided earth based shavasana. Tomorrow is Monday and I say Bring It. :),Janette Morrow,2020-08-09T23:45:17Z,2

"It’s quarantine day... ha! I couldn’t tell you the day of the week without looking it up first. Well, whatever day it is, thank you for helping me stay disciplined in my yoga: about half way through, I was “bored.” I even paused the video to peek in the fridge ... for nothing. Not hungry, not thirsty, just bored. Then I remembered dozens of life lessons about boredom and looked in my eyes as I walked past a mirror. Yep. I had to finish the video. I wasn’t bored, but beginning to lose my discipline. If I gave in here, it would weaken my discipline in other areas, too, and before I knew it, I would be miserable and short attention spanned and perhaps clouded as to why or where it began.<br />So, thank you, Adriene. You help me keep the promise to myself during quarantine to not lose sight of what matters to me.. love your show.",Crystal Rose,2020-05-08T21:33:04Z,0

NURTURE Day 19 practice is my favorite so far.  I finished it with tears in my eyes because this practice was beautiful and it made me feel so much better about myself. I think &quot;inhale lots of love in and exhale lots of love out&quot; is a beautiful mantra and it motivates me to do hard poses like plank and it gives me hope when I feel upset or find myself in a dark place.

"It has taken a lot of work and dedication to keep coming back to yoga. I love the feeling and the mental clarity I get from it. I&#39;m often busy so it never stuck as an everyday practice sadly, but since this quarantine has offered me more time and let me wander with my spiritual side, I&#39;ve returned to it with this month&#39;s theme. I&#39;ve started about a week into it, but within just 2 weeks I notice huge changes, I haven&#39;t missed a day yet so I think I&#39;ve got a routine with it.

"I&#39;m a big man, and I&#39;ve been doing yoga for about a year now. I&#39;ve been athletic my whole life but have always struggled with my weight, especially now that I&#39;m in my 40s. I try to be as healthy as possible and do an ok job. I just like food and I&#39;m trying to teach myself to like healthier food, but will always have the occasional pizza and Chinese takeout. I&#39;m also a practicing martial artist, I do a traditional Chinese art called Wing Chun. I just wanted to share the biggest thing I&#39;ve gotten from yoga. That being acceptance of where I am, how I am and to just enjoy the journey. I&#39;ve really been feeling good this past year that I&#39;ve added yoga to my routine, it&#39;s lower impact than what I&#39;m used to but an intense workout non the least.

"First off I want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart. On Wednesday I celebrated 120 days of daily yoga! That being said I’m still struggling with one easy pose and that’s the downward dog. If I spend too much time in that pose it makes my upper arms and elbows achy to the point that I have to stop holding the pose. I do a lot of physical work, lifting, pushing, pulling etc and I don’t feel it’s particularly a strength issue. For instance my planks, cat/cow, table etc anything else using my arms for support I don’t have the issue. It’s just the dog. I’m wondering in all your travels if you’ve come across anyone else with the problem and how one may be able to work on it besides just grinning and bearing it. A friend of a friend said my arms are weak which is fine if that’s the problem, I was just hoping for a second opinion. I know you’re extremely busy, working extra hard to bring us lovingly curated videos each week and I appreciate this more than I could explain.

"Hi Adriene. Thank you for this practice. You introduced me to yoga 3 years ago and it&#39;s made my life so much better.<br />Last six months, I find I have to skip a lot of parts, mostly that have to do with push-ups/sideplanks... because of recent diagnosis of spondylosis at the ripe old age of ... 21 :)<br />It&#39;s been a serious struggle, I find myself in doubt and worried about the future, and paradoxically doing so much less yoga because I&#39;m afraid of being careless when I&#39;m tired and making it worse... Would you ever consider doing a video on spondylosis?

So I wanted to say thank you. I’ve been a roofer/musician for many a years so I’ve put my body through unimaginable damage. Work hard play hard has always been the motto until you fall 3 stories and break yourself then dance with the devil and someone opens up the gates of hell to let you out and there’s yoga with adriene standing there. So thank you adriene for being a part of saving my life 4 months clean and 4 months of yoga everyday and juicing who woulda thunk it????,Michael Cartwright,2019-04-19T17:06:03Z,0

"Many thanks for that.  That&#39;s the most intensive Yoga session I&#39;ve had for ages, helped by doing the Wim Hof breathing method beforehand.  I really appreciate that you say things like Utkata Konasana can be called God Pose.  My experience of Yoga is that it can be gynocentric, which is fine for people who identify as women, but for us men, and especially us men who were sexually abused (by women) and/or come from the poverty class, we also need empowering.  I do yoga with my five-year-old son and want him to know that God&#39;s divine energies is within him.  I am really emancipating in this year from past traumas and self-limiting behaviours, and daily yoga with you (I&#39;ve only missed about 4 days this year due to travelling) is part of that.  I am very grateful.  Namaste.",Janick,2019-04-17T09:25:38Z,0

"Hi lovely Adriene! Thank you so much for this gift of providing me and so many humans around the world with your yoga practices, your words and your dedication. I absolutely love them and since many years now they are part of my morning routine and so part of my life.<br />If i can make a suggestion, there is just one thing i personally would wish for – a longer (guided) shavasana at the end as part of the videos. Because once the video ends, the relaxation is also &quot;disturbed&quot; or lets say finished and it feels weird to say namaste stop the video and continue laying down for shavasana. Maybe its just me. Would love to know what you think about that idea of including like a 5 min-shavasanas to the videos though.<br />Lots of Love from Berlin and again, thank you for your being!",Pia Held,2019-04-15T06:49:23Z,1

"Wow today I had so much doubt in my mind about getting on the mat but once I did and I really anchored in my breath , my mind just gradually started to go with it and be present,  that kind of control the breath gives is really hard to circle back to when it&#39;s lost unless I really center my mind and that what happened last few days I lost that cycling back to the breath and my practices became a struggle rather than a learning process in becoming a better me.<br />Your email really helped set the tone for today&#39;s practice Adriene so thank you so much for that and for helping me change my life for the better, no amount of thank you will do it justice so love yuh , hope u had a relaxing , epic weekend and Namaste to you and everyone 💕💞💗💓💖🙏🙏",Vanessa Morris,2019-04-15T02:35:08Z,0
"Hi Adriene,<br />Thank you so much for starters.<br />It&#39;s funny, I tried to start this video earlier this afternoon and I couldn&#39;t because...let&#39;s just say my brother and dad were having a pretty heated debate about something in the room directly above my yoga space. I didn&#39;t know what else to do at that point besides stop my flow...I couldn&#39;t concentrate! <br />After many hours and words between us, I came back to the mat and picked up where I left off. <br />It was magical...and I wasn&#39;t focusing on anything else fro the day besides what I was doing presently.<br /><br />So I thank myself and I thank you. Sincerely, you are just too good. I&#39;m trying to plan a trip to Texas soon to visit my best friend...cant wait to experience the energy there &lt;3",Julia Leonetti,2019-04-15T02:30:03Z,0

"Are your practices good for pregnant yogis? I started a daily practice with your Dedicate series in January, and also discovered I was pregnant with my second child.

I did this practice this morning, and was fine to handle all of the movements, just wanted your opinion🤰🏻❤️🙌🏻🧘‍♀️",Mears Green,2019-04-14T13:28:12Z,0

"Hi Mears! Most women are able to continue a regular practice through month 8 if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. And always consult your doctor and follow their advice. xo",Yoga With Adriene,2019-04-14T13:43:52Z,0

Lotta Larsson they say that the poses are worshipping false gods or something. I&#39;ve done yoga in the past. It&#39;s not really a deal breaker.

"@Chris I&#39;m sorry but no. Yoga comes from religious practice and more than religion has meditative techniques.

"I for one have always been an advocate of environmental awareness, that said, Earth is our mama, one that we not only gotta respect and praise for its sense of tolerance and kindness towards us despite what we&#39;ve done to it over the ages of time, but also protect and ensure its cleanliness. The air in the room feels like high quality wine today, a toast waiting to be made by getting a breath or two while limitlessly loving ourselves. Can&#39;t get enough of the magic these practices work on me each and every day Adriene. Thank you for reminding us to love ourselves and mama Earth. Much love.
