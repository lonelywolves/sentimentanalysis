"Hiiiiii * I have done this practice a few times before.  After many injuries in life’s adventures, there is a lot of pain in my neck and back (not to mention all the other places that let me know when a storm is on the way).<br />However, two days ago, I slipped on a steep and wet concrete hill.  Feet flew out and up.  Head landed first with my back just after.  This was the hardest that I have ever hit my head.  But, my skull is thick (thanks Mom🧡). <br />48 hours later, I can hardly move my head and neck.  <br />Let’s see if this practice can teach me something new this time.  It will be just like starting over. <br />I will reply to this post afterwards🌀🌈🌊🌅⛵️🏜🍦🌍",Justin Baumann,2021-05-07T10:49:52Z,0

"I did this video every day for about 2 months. I always felt fantastic. I keep almost all of my stress in my neck and shoulders. Life got hectic. I didn&#39;t follow this Fidel for like 4 months. I just did it again for the first time today, and it&#39;s so much harder again! My posture looks so much better after doing it. I love this video and I will try my hardest to do it everyday for years from here on out.

"I woke up with pain on my left side, from my neck to my left shoulder.  I&#39;m a big fan of Adriene&#39;s yoga videos, which I follow every morning. I wish I could say that this practice cured me of my neck and shoulder pain and stiffness. That is not the case. Maybe a hot shower and ibuprofen will help.  In my experience the best cure is time.  I believe this video was helpful, but it was not an instant cure.  I have to be honest.",Joanne Katzman,2021-04-08T14:17:35Z,1

Hopped onto Bridge after the 30 Day Breathe journey.  This practice has been saved in my favorites since it came out. A perfect little ditty to help with the chronic upper back pain I deal with.

I am in the same situation. I thought this working remotely would be temporarily so I didn&#39;t really bother to set things up ergonomically at home hence pain in my neck and shoulders.

"Opening my laptop to do my daily YWA, there was a button calling for computer update. I pushed it, and of course, the machine went black for a loooong time... But then, sitting on my mat, I just started. Breathing, &quot;hearing&quot; Adriene voice inside my head. I did all the tings I remembered, and for the first time I managed to do a yoga session all by my myself! Proud! I have been doing daily yoga for 2,5 years, and today I realized I really have a vocabulary internalized. Although I prefer doing yoga with the videos, this was a nice experience. Thank you Adriene, for the beautiful BREATH series, and for being a wonderful guide, a supportive friend and a daily inspiration! Wishing you all the best! Love from Norway!",Kristin Brynjulvsrud,2021-02-03T09:13:35Z,128

"Whos merc - respectfully, I&#39;m not sure that there was any need for the tone of your comment. The reason for the black screen isn&#39;t the point. It provided an opportunity and Kristin found that she&#39;s learned more than she realised, and can practice without guidance. That&#39;s an awesome part of the journey.",Cheryl M,2021-03-25T10:07:32Z,14
The reason your computer went black is because it turns off the screen when it&#39;s updating. There was no need for an entire paragraph in a YouTube&#39;s comment section.,merc,2021-03-10T17:12:05Z,0

One thought I have always had - have you read much about the idea of decolonising your yoga practice? Google yields much on this topic.

I am currently recovering from an injury in my leg and was looking through your videos.This was fun and I was wondering if you have any more that are focussed on a sitting on the ground position (chair is difficult as the injury is on the leg...) but that are perhaps a  bit longer and more intense for the upper body? Thank youuu ❤️,Julia Jaensch,2021-01-19T07:57:34Z,0

Great to add on to the end of any practice, before bed, or if youve been feeling couch/computer locked. This and the “Yoga for Hips and Heart” are two of the best practices for people with neck pain.

"Adrienne- Thanks so much!! I found you on 11/24/2020 after suffering for a number of months with continuous pain in my upper back. Your 10-min Yoga for Neck, Shoulder and Upper Back was EXACTLY what I needed. You were so welcoming and made whatever I was able to do just fine…and 10 minutes that was very doable. I did the stretches 3xday &amp; within the week I was much better. Now after 4 weeks I have no pain and I have memorized the movements and do the yoga stretches whenever I notice the muscles tightening. Another fun thing… I was out on a walk with a friend and I was talking about the yoga…and then she said she’d read a NYT article about a yoga instructor who was doing all these free zooms. And as my friend talked about the instructor I knew it was you!! So happy to read your NYT interview!! Thanks for your gift to me and to so many.

"I have such intense anxiety around yoga sometimes, I&#39;ll go months and months beating myself up for obsessively telling myself to practice and obsessively scolding myself for not doing so. But my brain is full of ideas to distract me emotionally when I think I might get on my mat. Telling myself I cant do it because I haven&#39;t been pacified enough from my difficult reality yet. So go smoke something, drink something, eat something,  consume some meaningless media, sleep, heck maybe even go be productive in some other way instead if I have to. Just dont get on the mat. It&#39;s a perfect system through which I erode my self esteem and acceptance because it becomes remarkable how much I resent myself for this pattern and i hold that resentment tightly inside because i need to stretch and breathe to release it. Well not today... i did some breathing and stretches on my mat and I was like you know what? Adriene is my favorite go-to yoga instructor and she doesnt seem so scary right now. So I did this bloody video and it was very pleasant. It&#39;s such a lovely thing to do and yet I harbor so much negativity around it. What a joke! I am free today because I broke the streak... how long has it been since I last did yoga anyway? Oh yeah, like 2 minutes. CHECKMATE, ANXIETY. Begone from me.",meow444,2020-12-22T09:04:43Z,0

"If anyone is feeling empty, lonely, depressed etc, I want you to know that Jesus loves you, and He is the Only one who can make you feel true love, happiness, joy and peace. We need to repent of our sins and turn to Him and start living for Him and He will be there with you every step of the way.<br /><br />When you do yoga, you are actually making yourself an antenna for demons to enter your body and possess your body,",Christian Girl,2020-12-05T18:32:44Z,0

"Sitting on the mat, I was struck by sorrow. In these times of solitude, Adriene is actually the person I see the most. I wake up to her voice every morning. I go to her when I am desperate for relief, and whether I&#39;m feeling joy or pain. She has become so important in the lives of so many. I mourn, in a bittersweet way, that we can&#39;t all link hands and extend this love fully to one another. We go through our experience alone. It&#39;s sad, but it&#39;s also a wonderful mystery, life is. When I lay on my mat, I can feel the weight of my body pulling down and the support of the floor taking up that weight, sending it back to me. I notice the places I am tense and where I&#39;m at ease. I feel my chest expand with breath. Miraculously, I&#39;m alive :) And I know that others also bear the weight, the counterweight, the expansion, the contraction, the pain, the pleasure, and everything else. I&#39;m grateful for many reasons to Adriene: teacher, friend, and mother of this community.",roxy,2020-11-25T18:05:04Z,384

I have been to 3 doctors and they have only made things worse. Please accept this gratitude from the bottom of my heart. I know this is such a simple thing, but I don&#39;t think you could possibly understand what this means to me. I am going to do this every day. Thank you for making thoughtful stretches and making living with chronic pain easier. I am going to be able to work more because of this, and be able to live with less pain, all because of the right stretches that I found in this video, Thank you to everyone who helped make this, and for the people who created these stretches, whoever you are.

"I struggle with back pain, partly caused by a motorcycle accident, and partly caused by obesity and anterior pelvic tilt. I tried to sit cross legged through this entire thing, and tried to keep my back straight, but the muscles on the inside and tops of the thighs were killing me, and I couldn&#39;t seem to sit tall and straight when my legs were crossed. Any idea what this is and why? And how can I fix it? I&#39;m trying to get medical help, but with Covid everything has been stopped, and it&#39;s awful.

"Hi all, firstly, thank you Adriene for your wonderful channel, it&#39;s been such a gift to me. A few weeks ago I started &#39;Home&#39; and got to Day 21 before going on holiday for a week. I came back aiming to carry on, but on doing my first downward dog, felt a sharp pain in my left heel, right where the sole of the foot meets the achilles heel. I don&#39;t know what this is or what to do - has anyone else experienced this, and does it go away over time? I get it when I flex my foot, or do a full forward fold too. I haven&#39;t continued with Home as I&#39;m worried about hurting it further, and now have lost loads of flexibility and am reduced to doing simple practices like this one with little or no stress on the legs. I plan to do a little and often to gradually test it and hopefully rebuild it, but I would value advice from this community. Obviously I&#39;ll head to the doctor if it doesn&#39;t seem to be getting better in a week or so. Thank you!",Jo Davey,2020-10-04T18:18:49Z,0

"I&#39;m testing this on my bad, double jointed shoulder. I messed it up trying to do milk jug weights. It&#39;s been a month by now and I&#39;m still waiting for it to heal.<br /><br />So far so good. Any yoga I do makes my shoulder feel better. This is only my third time doing an Adrienne video.<br /><br />Update 10/29/20: I used to exclude this &quot;neck and shoulders&quot; video because I hurt my shoulder trying the first time, instead focusing on the&quot;full body flow&quot; which includes my shoulders anyhow. Made my shoulder feel better.<br /><br />Now I do specifically this shoulder exercise if I&#39;m short for time, or I do it right after the full body flow. And it&#39;s working great. If only I did this before I started gardening.",Garrett Carlson,2020-08-07T02:17:10Z,0

"Although I know people mean well usually doing yoga to achieve a higher balance, it actually does the opposite. Unfortunately, people don&#39;t know the true occultic roots of yoga. It&#39;s about union with certain spirits, or in reality, demons. This is why it&#39;s very addictive and takes over peoples lives so often. The specific poses in yoga actually are paying homage to certain demons that people aren&#39;t aware of. It&#39;s a spiritual signal actually. Not only is it somewhat dangerous physically with studies to back that up, mentally and emotionally it&#39;s like a drug. <br /><br /><br />It also leads to hell. Yes, hell is real and more horrific than you can ever imagine. It&#39;s not anything doing with a religion or dogma, it&#39;s a very real place in the afterlife that so many tragically end up in because they don&#39;t know how they&#39;re being deceived. Yoga opens spiritual doorways to forces that are against the human soul. Hard to believe I know, but our eyes cannot see the spirit world, which deceives in the physical. Demons are real, so is Jesus Christ, who is literally God. Christ is the ONLY way to escape hell, I promise. Sin is real and doorways are opened through many means for demons to enter our body, area, space, etc. <br /><br /><br />At the moment of death, if we don&#39;t have Jesus Christ and are not cleansed of all demons and sin, they pull people&#39;s souls down with them and people are so unbelievably shocked the first time they see demons and hell. God/Christ can no longer help you after your time is up, but Christ so eagerly wants to show you deceptions and help people escape hell, but THEY have to choose with their own free will.  It is NOT about religion. Jesus will give you true peace and show you what yoga and so many other deceptions truly are. What we see in the physical is often a spiritual trap and deception.",soul desire,2020-06-10T04:46:56Z,0

"As my regular yoga class has been cancelled due to the lockdown, I&#39;ve looked for yoga videos to do in the meantime. I had a hard time following any of the videos because it felt distant and made me aware that I was by myself rather than in a class with an instructor (which helps me to stay focused) . Hence, I couldn&#39;t get back into it. But Adriene&#39;s videos have really helped to keep me engaged and present because she makes you feel like she&#39;s in the room speaking directly to you.

THANK YOU SO MUCH! &lt;3  How long do you think I should this routine for? I&#39;ve doing it for about 4 days in a row :D",felipe eduardo gomez lizama,2020-05-15T13:22:59Z,0

I can pull my right knee straight toward my chest while sitting on the floor, but I can&#39;t then stretch it down toward the side to make the cross sitting position.

"Adriene, I just had to send you a comment today and tell you how much I appreciate you and your yoga channel. <br /><br />I am a high school counselor in Napa, California and have been practicing yoga for many years, usually at my gym or friend’s yoga studio. <br /><br />During this time of sheltering in place, I’ve been spending my days reaching out to students, trying to keep them going and encouraging them not to shut down during this challenging time.  <br /><br />You and your channel have helped me create a “new normal “routine,” with yoga in the morning before I start my day and more yoga in the afternoon or evening. It is helping to keep me grounded and grateful and I think – more able to be present and there for my students right now.<br /><br />You are a wonderful yoga instructor and you have a beautiful energy. I’m so glad you’re doing what you’re doing, for me, and all the rest of your viewers. The ripple effects of your work are making a huge difference!!<br />Thank you!!",Stefanie LaMarca,2020-05-07T16:38:09Z,7

Only one draw back here  - those circular neck moves ( drawing circles with the nose ) are an absolutely big NO no,Reality & Perception,2020-04-08T16:49:31Z,0
"@puppybon3z <br />hmmm I will give you just 3 reasons ... however I am almost sure you won&#39;t read it. Wait ....what? ;) <br /><br />Reason 1.  Nerve impingement. Because of its delicate nature, the spinal cord needs to be isolated from bumps and blows – the task accomplished by the vertebral structures and surrounding ligaments, tendons and muscles. In addition, the spinal cord needs to be protected from the surrounding bony wall of the vertebrae themselves. The bony spinal canal normally has more than enough room for the spinal cord, but sometimes it can become smaller/narrower (called spinal stenosis). When that happens the bony structures of the vertebra can compress or pinch the nerves, which will show up as weakness, numbness or pain in the neck itself or anywhere along the nerve’s pathway.<br />Why would it become narrow? There are several reasons:<br /><br />Some people are born with a spinal canal that’s narrower then normal, which puts them at a greater risk even from a minor neck injury.<br />The effects of aging (thanks, Mother Nature!) – wear and tear on the spine can cause all kinds of degenerative changes, including disk herniation, bone spurs and cartilage degeneration. Any of these conditions can narrow the spinal canal.<br />Too much movement between vertebrae, which can cause the neck bones to shift and close off the spinal canal.<br />Here is the thing – you never know what’s going on in your students’ cervical spines. They might not know it themselves (many people have stenosis without any symptoms). Rolling your head back puts the neck in the most vulnerable position  – the combination of hyperextension and twisting and/or rotation. For somebody who has spinal stenosis this can lead to nerve compression and impingement.<br /><br />Reason 2. Damage to facet joints<br /><br />Your vertebrae are stacked on the top of each other and their bone protrusions fit together kind of like Lego pieces to form facet joints. Those joints move in a hinge-like pattern and their surfaces are covered with cartilage to make the movement smooth.<br /><br />These joints allow flexion (bending forward), extension (bending backward), and twisting motion and prevent excessive bending and gliding movements between adjacent vertebrae. The spine is made more stable due to the interlocking nature of the adjacent vertebrae. These joints play a major role in the preservation of “normal” range of motion. Since the circular motion of the head is not a “normal” movement and encourages the vertebrae to “glide” against one another, it can destabilize the facet joints and cause unnecessary wear and tear on the structure. This is made worse by the fact that these joints are weight-bearing, which makes them more susceptible to degenerative changes. Neck circles can cause further damage to an already degenerated cartilage surface. And didn’t we say earlier that spinal instability could also lead to the narrowing of the spinal canal? Doesn’t sound like a responsible thing to do.<br /><br />Reason 3.  Restriction of the blood supply to the brain.Your brain, with billions of neurons, is an extremely active organ with a continuous demand for nutrients and oxygen. These demands are met by an extensive circulatory supply through the internal carotid arteries and vertebral arteries. In the extreme case, a stroke occurs when the blood supply to a portion of the brain is shutoff.<br /><br />When you move your head back beyond the point of just looking up, you can put pressure on the vertebral arteries and with that reduce the blood flow to the brain. The situation gets worse if the arteries are clogged. The result – dizziness, maybe even loss of consciousness.<br /><br />It seems obvious that neck circles are not safe and can cause all kinds of problems. Certainly, the likeliness of that happening depends on the variety of factors: student’s age, underlying spinal issues, the frequency of the activity, etc. But it seems that in this case the potential risk far outweighs the potential benefit (neck stretching). And to tell you the truth, I am not a big fan of isolated neck stretches, even if they don’t involve head circles. I just don’t think that they are very effective. There are better ways!",Reality & Perception,2020-04-14T10:15:44Z,0

Good Morning Adrienne and friends..  I&#39;m feeling real cramped and pinched in my right shoulder blade today and did this workout twice as part of my morning workout. I started with the 8 minute &quot;get your juices flowing - morning yoga&quot; went out to some light weights (which I mainly used to stretch out my shoulders some more. Went for a small bike around my block and a tiny 50 jog. Then did this beautiful workout. Now to finish it has just got light enough to take my dogs for a walk. <br />Making the most of this NZ COVID-19 lockdown. <br />I hope you are well. And if not I hope your are resting and taking care of yourself so you recover. My heart goes out to you all. And those of you who have lost someone. Stay strong and don&#39;t give up.

"Follow her in the video, it doesn&#39;t need to be more than that.

Don&#39;t rush it when she says &quot;inspire&quot; or &quot;expire&quot;, you&#39;ll put unnecessary stress on your breathing.",Fannie Rivet,2020-04-05T09:19:53Z,0

"I have an herniated disk in my neck. I have been experiencing neck and upper back pain for the last 3 months, also I have a numb feeling in my right hand (my fingers). My neurosurgeon wanted to operate or use cortisone on the hernia. But I opted for resting and natural healing. It was going better and better with time, but than I started working again and I probably started working too soon. (I have a desk job). So my pains were slowly getting worse again. I was scared of doing any exercise or stretching because I didn’t want my nerve in my arm to get irritated (+ my neurosurgeon wasn’t keen on massage or exercises because if you do anything wrong you can aggravate the situation. So his opinion kept me from trying anything to ease my pains.) I have been taking pain killers for the last 3 weeks in isolation because of the lockdown and didn’t dare going to a physician. Anyway, long story short. I did this practice yesterday and slept without painkillers and without any pain for the first time in a long time. Normally I am a healthy person and besides a headache on occasion I don’t have any other physical worries. I did it again this morning. I don’t overdo it and try to be very careful. I feel my nerve in my right arm isn’t as flexible it used to be. But I cry every time on the last part when I say thanks 🙏.",Sinem Duman,2020-03-30T09:42:54Z,0

I have been doing yoga with you for last ten days and today when my back started aching, I immediately searched for relevant video by you and followed this one. I&#39;m feeling a lot better. And I can finally focus on my studies. Thank you so much!!",Sai Kolhatkar,2020-03-26T11:15:41Z,0

Hey my   name.   Is.   Taniya,Michael Bishop,2020-11-13T23:47:50Z,0
"Although I know people mean well usually doing yoga to achieve a higher balance, it actually does the opposite. Unfortunately, people don&#39;t know the true occultic roots of yoga. It&#39;s about union with certain spirits, or in reality, demons. This is why it&#39;s very addictive and takes over peoples lives so often. The specific poses in yoga actually are paying homage to certain demons that people aren&#39;t aware of. It&#39;s a spiritual signal actually. Not only is it somewhat dangerous physically with studies to back that up, mentally and emotionally it&#39;s like a drug. <br /><br />It also leads to hell. Yes, hell is real and more horrific than you can ever imagine. It&#39;s not anything doing with a religion or dogma, it&#39;s a very real place in the afterlife that so many tragically end up in because they don&#39;t know how they&#39;re being deceived. Yoga opens spiritual doorways to forces that are against the human soul. Hard to believe I know, but our eyes cannot see the spirit world, which deceives in the physical. Demons are real, so is Jesus Christ, who is literally God. Christ is the ONLY way to escape hell, I promise. Sin is real and doorways are opened through many means for demons to enter our body, area, space, etc. <br /><br />At the moment of death, if we don&#39;t have Jesus Christ and are not cleansed of all demons and sin, they pull people&#39;s souls down with them and people are so unbelievably shocked the first time they see demons and hell. God/Christ can no longer help you after your time is up, but Christ so eagerly wants to show you deceptions and help people escape hell, but THEY have to choose with their own free will.  It is NOT about religion. Jesus will give you true peace and show you what yoga and so many other deceptions truly are. What we see in the physical is often a spiritual trap and deception.",soul desire,2020-06-10T04:48:00Z,1

"On a side note Adrienne and her videos have helped me so much for the last 2 years or so, I didn&#39;t really start practicing until the last year though, I had only been watching to learn and when I started it was a breath of fresh air that had really helped me learn how to self-care so much better than I had ever managed to before, i failed to do so very often in the past so I just want to thank you for your amazing Channel because it helped me through a very, very difficult time and I hope it can do so again",Heartshapedbox81,2020-03-14T01:36:29Z,0
"I&#39;ve been following this channel for a while now and gradually getting better at practicing yoga because of it but for the last couple of months ive fallen off of my routine and the reason for that is because I&#39;ve had to fall into the caretaker routine for my sister who recently developed an autoimmune disease and it&#39;s been very difficult to see her in such pain, I haven&#39;t gone through every single video on the channel so if anyone can point me in the direction of practices that could be done by someone with arthritis and who is suffering from joint pain so that I can maybe try and help her build her strength back up because the swelling and being bedridden has caused some atrophy and I know that not every exercise type is doable when you have joint inflammation but they say some yoga practices can be so any help would really be appreciated because as I&#39;m sure anyone who has ever had a loved one who is forced to be bedridden and cared for and not able to do things on their own power can attest to, it is a miserable mindset to be in and a really helpless one so anything I can do to help alleviate her pain and help her treatment to better work so she can go back to some semblance of normal is my goal",Heartshapedbox81,2020-03-14T01:32:02Z,0

good routine but too much and too fast talking by the instructor which is a distraction to the mindfulness component of yoga. You dont need to explain the pose each and every time you do it.

"Hi! In general, most women are able to continue a regular practice through month eight if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. <br />As always, consult your doctor/physician before starting and follow their advice. xx",Yoga With Adriene,2020-02-10T16:45:36Z,1

"I had my back cracked last year. It’s never been the same since, I’ve struggled with muscle stiffness for that time. Also, the inability to take a deep breath. I believe it’s my muscles causing that, a few times I was able to breath through and take a deep breath in the summer during a meditation but it was forced breathing it felt good but didn’t fix anything. That is what’s making me depressed. During this yoga exercise I got emotional half way through the video, my upper back muscles were getting really sore and tired. It’s like they were taking my breath away, I stopped and cried. I just want to thank you for all these videos. I’m going to try them and see if they can help release that tension to help me breath. Any feedback or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. ❤️",Andy R St. Paul,2020-01-08T23:59:42Z,1

"Hi Adriene ! I keep coming back to this amazing video as I tend to collect a lot of tension and pain in those 3 areas, neck shoulders, upper back (in my jaw as well), so this is really perfect. Do you have any advice though about posture and daily habits to prevent and reduce those tensions ? I try my best and sometimes give myself a little neck massage but it doesnt always help. I am only 20yo and I&#39;m afraid those tensions might get worse and worse throughout my life. do you think it&#39;s better to sleep with or without a pillow ? anyway I guess every body is different and there are no strict rules... but I would be very glad if you answered my question :) thank you for all you do! love you xx from France&amp;Hungary",Baptiste Borie,2019-10-24T20:31:20Z,0

"@Victoria O Hi, I discovered that when we get a reply from anyone or even a heart from the video poster, that YOU TUBE HIGHLIGHTS OUR POST  FOR OUR EYES ONLY, NO ONE ELSE SEES IT HIGHLIGHTED BUT US.  That is done so we can easily find our place on the page where we had commented and and are returning to see the comment from someone responding or a heart from the video poster.  It was a while before I finally found that info. out,  when someone mentioned about how that highlight works.  I had been thinking it was an amazing coincidence that whenever I got a comment or heart that my comment would be highlighted.

I always have stuffed nasal passage so its kinda hard for me to breathe through nose without little huffing.  I don&#39;t see how yoga could help that but maybe it&#39;ll regularize the breathing pattern. Other than that my mid upper back base of neck has been tensed for  a very long period. This helped a lot. Thank you so much . 🙏,Tabussum Sehar,2019-09-26T16:31:00Z,0

There are so many yoga channels out there but I stopped on yours because of the doggo.  Silly but true. I love the idea of a short 10 minute session.

"Hey Adriene! Great videos, I’ve become a big fan. One problem though. Every time I try to sit in Yoga pose my lower back is killing me. The extreme tightness prohibits me from executing some of the straight back exercises as it simply hurts to much after a while. I’ve always been a competitive footballer, that’s probably the cause. But how do I solve this, or is there a good way to do the exercises without yoga pose.",Joey Steengoed,2019-06-11T07:55:29Z,0

It&#39;s definitely my favourite video on Adriene&#39;s channel, I&#39;m super grateful for it. If you have trouble with your posture I recommend it - I promise you will be shocked at how much it helps. I try to do it a few times in a week, because I feel the best then, and to keep the results (when I skip it for a while I see regression). I&#39;m 22 and I had a really ugly posture all my life and just these 10 minutes were able to fix it. I&#39;m still amazed. :)",Mircia M,2019-06-02T14:49:37Z,1

"I did this a second time, the first one being yesterday and I love it. I had pretty back neck pains for about 4 days, which lead to different other pains. I had a mild headache, my eye hurt, my ear hurt and even my jaw hurt quite badly. I tried other exercises, but nothing really helped. I had some pain killers, but didn&#39;t want to reach for too many and even the pain killers didn&#39;t help too much. So i started looking for a specific neck/back exercise and found you. All of the pain I went through for 4 days is gone now. I feel great again, still a little tired, but that might be because of my lack of sleep. I&#39;m going to continue doing these exercises! Thank you :)",K Maria,2019-04-10T17:07:41Z,0

"Hey Adriene, I dont know how u are doing this but the energy I can feel from the screen is just amazing. I watch ur videos in Slovakia, Central Europe (yes, u have fans even there and I am not the only one), so u can imagine how many kms there are between us - yet, the energy is here with me, as if it was palpable. Ur videos make me smile and despite my terrible migraines, they inspire me to go on. U are a real treasure. I watched so many yoga tutorials, but none of the trainers were like u. U explain everything in detail, the way I need to breath, and ur voice is so calming. Many, many thanks. I am sending u lots of love and good vibes :) Namaste!",Mariana Zeleňáková,2019-02-25T21:38:03Z,0

"Dear Adriene 🌺 And dear subscribers🌸<br />Please ✨, give me an advice what your practices is better to do in my situation!!!🤲 <br />I think that the problem is in 2 chakra (in the 1st place)... <br />I really need to turn on my feminity✨: I lack tenderness, sensitivity, warm and comfort (I want to provide comfort and warm not only me but my husband also). But I am too tense and worrying... So I have problems with love expression (not just sexual, but at 1st place through warm, sensitivity to my husband’s feelings and needs, creating harmony and peace at home), I don’t cherish love 😔<br />I’ve just understood the problem, and I am asking with all my heart the Universe to help me! And I really want to make quick changes, life won’t wait, we are living here and now✨<br /><br />Thank you, Adriene, for the knowledge that you share with us! ♥️ It greatly affects the life, this is why I am asking for advice here, because I know that mindful yoga makes great changings)))<br />Namaste 🙏",Анна Карпова,2019-02-15T07:18:33Z,0

"Thank you for sharing this video. I enjoyed following you.   I am 62 yrs. young and have severe to moderate back pain. Mostly in the lower back.  I love doing yoga stretches as they do help with the pain. However, I cannot sit in that position anymore, (didn&#39;t have a mat), because the bones in my feet hurt, my tailbone sticks out and my right knee can&#39;t take it. I was able to sit in the &#39;indian&#39; position not long ago without any issues.   Some of that could be arthritis too. (?)   I was hit by a car while walking across the street two years ago in Feb. My right knee needed surgery and I also got scoliosis after the accident.  Is there any other position I can use to do floor yoga?  Would a 1 inch foam be o.k.?  or a blanket?  Mats are too thin.  I really need to do as many different stretches but feel limited.  I would appreciate some suggestions from you about my issues.  One more thing. My right leg is a bit shorter than my left therefore, my whole alignment is off. I believe that continuing with yoga stretches can realign some of me. I think young and need to do things without so much pain otherwise I fear it will age my mind and heart which is a &#39;no no&#39; for me.  I will remain forever young regardless of the years gone by and will go by.<br />I am looking forward to your reply.  Sincerely, Carole",Carol Legault,2019-02-14T17:28:40Z,0

"Hi Adriene, which yoga of yours do you recommend for pregnant woman?",Sangeeta Prasad,2019-02-10T17:45:47Z,0
"Hi Sangeeta! Most women are able to continue a regular practice through month 8 if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose and modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat. I do have a Prenatal Yoga For All Trimesters available in the FWFG Membership, if you&#39;re interested. <a href=""https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/"">https://yogawithadriene.vhx.tv/</a>",Yoga With Adriene,2019-02-11T17:42:49Z,0

"This is going to sound so silly, but I started crying in the middle of the video and had to pause. My neck has been a huge issue for weeks, I even had to have someone come in and take over my shift at work because I strained it which made it worse on top of that and I had to literally just lay in bed for a few days. I hadn&#39;t done your videos in a while and started doing them again last Monday. Today, in the middle of yoga, I realize my neck didn&#39;t hurt for the first time in about three weeks and most likely it&#39;s thanks to getting back to stretching with your videos every morning. Just goes to show that this is a must do for everyone. It helps you from straining your body throughout the day by even the simplest of movements which is what happens to me all the time.  Time to go back to telling people Im busy in the morning doing sessions with my trainer. You&#39;re doing awesome work. ♥",Null,2019-02-10T17:01:47Z,944
"This sounds exactly like my story! I started crying halfway in and had to pause too, because I&#39;ve been going through an entire year of pain, could not even work for 10 months of it! It is so cool to see how many people this has saved",Amaris June,2020-10-19T16:07:32Z,1

First time ever following along. I subscribed but forgot because I have a brain injury. Then I see so many notifications when I remember to look I&#39;m overwhelmed and don&#39;t do any because &quot;my brain feels too full.&quot; So to speak. Today? I decided whatever it was - I was going to force my brain to focus for 10 minutes and at 7 I knew I was wandering but paused for a moment and then finished up the final three. <br /><br />Thank you. <br /><br />Thank you for the gentle and encouraging way you have about you. I&#39;m setting a reminder to check once a day and I created a playlist with this being the first and only one there. For this week my goal is to do this in the morning and in the evening. <br /><br />Thank you.,pvz2 geekgirl,2019-02-10T16:40:47Z,0

"Thank you so much. I am trying to get into yoga but trying to fit it in around work and study is so hard. This video has helped so much  it&#39;s short enough that I knew I had time but also targeted the areas I absolutely needed, especially as I am spending almost every day at a desk. Thank you again.",Chibikate_,2019-02-10T07:44:50Z,0

"This video came at the EXACT time that I needed it! The past 2 or so weeks has involved a lot of hunching over due to illness, abnormally cold weather, and full-time desk work, resulting in some extra neck tension. This was a perfect quick practice that was easy to commit to, just the boost I needed to let the yoga take off into more poses for other things my mind and body need today. Thank you for somehow reading my mind yet again!",leighakayleen123,2019-02-10T07:41:39Z,0
