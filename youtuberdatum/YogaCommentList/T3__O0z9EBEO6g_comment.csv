"Today I felt annoyed, my back was killing me and that bummed me out. Desided to have a lunch hour date with my yoga mat.  None of that previous feeling left. And I think I discovered something with my breath. Not sure what though. No pressure on my lungs as usual during  day time. Thank you so much Adriene.",Elina Suomalainen,2021-05-03T10:38:14Z,0

"Hey 👋 I’ve started this 30 day yoga journey April 2021 and have shown up every day but today my get up and go was nowhere to be seen, feeling fed up and low. Anyways I made myself show up and I felt like you was taking directly to me when you said laugh, cry or sob. I really wanted to sob today for no reason really but couldn’t even part with one! Even though I love a good cry 😢. <br />I’m rambling now but just wanted to say after practice I am feeling so much better and it is true, we really aren’t alone.

Day 13: I started this journey on 21 March. I am inspired by all of you lovely people and I got this idea (on day 4) to leave a comment every day after each session.

"I don&#39;t know if anyone else is doing this now in March instead of January but here I am! I tried to do it in January but my excuses and mental health got the better of me and I fell off. But the last few months have been horrendous. Anxiety is so bad. I can&#39;t focus on anything. I&#39;m worried about everything, but when I get in a mood or feel disconnected from my body I&#39;ve been coming here and it&#39;s helped so much. It doesn&#39;t take away 100% of the fear but I have to believe that if I keep showing up for myself everyday that the anxiety will break. It helps to put me back into control of my body. I will come out on the other side. And I will be able to actually live life again. So, thanks Adriene!",Morgan Lee,2021-03-18T20:51:20Z,4

I study so I don&#39;t get to go outside for work plus I don&#39;t meet people; n my private time because I take the Coronavirus situation serious. BUT the longer it goes on the more and more I have been starting to break.<br />This yoga journey gave me something to look forward to every day. I start here on this channel, because I find Adriene so sweet and even though I have been practicing yoga for years on and off I really enjoy learning things here. And after this yoga practice I normally go to &quot;Boho beautiful&quot; and do her 14 day yoga challenge, because its a bit more difficult and i just love to combine both practices. I really want to try 365 days of yoga, because now after just 2 weeks I already notice a difference 💜",alena,2021-02-27T09:10:55Z,2

I couldn’t do a hand stand or a headstand  before COVID anyway.I also am a firm believer of letting the basics teach you and the rest follows at your own pace . 🙏",kikt kikt,2021-02-22T15:20:46Z,0

"The Pilate style boat pose or pike ups I called them in diving activate the clunk in my lower back. Just the leg, left side does it. But I just can’t with that. I always have to do something else during those ones. My degenerative disc disease makes a lot of things more difficult. I just came back from 3 weeks off after throwing out my back followed by my neck. I find after 3 weeks I don’t know how to breath anymore and should probably start over at day 1.",H C,2021-02-21T05:38:27Z,0

And that sitting V pose, man, that was very hard but I got it at the end! Whew! Being a big tall guy and very inflexible, the two things I loathe are sitting cross legged and doing things on or near the floor. This journey has been helping me overcome that.

"I loved today&#39;s practice FEEL. Whenever I practice my yoga it is all abut how my body feels and I am almost always moving within a pose. In fact it is kind of tough for me to find a stillness. It takes ultra concentration. Even at the end of the practice when we sit in a small meditation heads bowed, I find myself rocking back and forth. Sometimes I don&#39;t even notice until I;&#39;m rocking pretty aggressively! But yea we all have things that don&#39;t come naturally for us.

"Hi Adriene, :)<br />I find that no matter where I am coming from, if I want to move a lot or wind down, your videos always help me to come back home to myself. &lt;3<br /><br />This is my second time trying 30 Days of Yoga. Attempt 1 was in spring and after 2 weeks I started to skip a bunch of days. For this round, I haven&#39;t missed a single day yet!! :D Between now and the last attempt, I&#39;ve been doing any random videos that suited my fancy, sometimes everyday and sometimes a few times a week. :P Now, I miss when I can&#39;t do some yoga. <br /><br />Do you know if yoga eventually help to correct my hip hinge so that I can touch my toes in flat back? Also, I&#39;m always curious what plant you have in the background. It&#39;s adorable. <br /> <br />Thank you so much xox",butterflypoo,2021-01-30T20:29:47Z,0

I was scared I&#39;d stop when I&#39;m on my periods as I do with many other excercises which I&#39;ve tried in the past but this was different. I wanted to do more and more. I love yoga so much and I&#39;m so thankful for Adriene.

"Did anyone else just feel a ridiculous amount of unadulterated joy at the end of this practice? Sometimes yoga helps me become aware of and slowly accept sadness, stress, anxiety, and other unhappy emotions. But I am also realising that yoga helps me see when I&#39;m happy; I don&#39;t think I would have had the chance to savor this feeling the way I am now if it weren&#39;t for this practice.

Day 13 🌬🌬🌬,David Smith,2021-01-23T10:26:38Z,0
"I&#39;m nine days behind, but it&#39;s okay, because every practice I do is exactly what I need that day. Recently I&#39;ve been putting myself through a hard time by overthinking a situation, I was numb, stuck in a loop of negative thoughts with no way out, crying myself to sleep every night and yoga (with Adriene) is the only thing that can get me out of my head when this happens. Even if I just lie on the mat and cry. Yesterday&#39;s and today&#39;s practice really helped me sort it out. I needed to Drop it and then allow myself to Feel good again.<br />So today, I&#39;m feeling gratitude. (however cliché that sounds)<br />Mantras are not my thing, but I&#39;m a sucker for good quotes, and somehow, every single one of Adriene&#39;s sayings ends up rooting into my brain and becomes a part of my everyday inner dialogue. Some of them I don&#39;t understand right away and it takes a while until something happens and suddenly they become more then just pretty words and everything clicks into place. <br />Today, it was &quot;Find what feels good&quot;. I always liked this idea, but only took it in a physical sense. Today I realized that I don&#39;t want to listen to the doubts that only bring me down anymore, because they don&#39;t feel good. But there are also good things worth fighting for, giving me hope and that&#39;s what I should focus on because that&#39;s what feels good. I have hope that I can fix the mistakes I&#39;ve made, and if not, then that I can learn from them for the next time. <br />Thank you, Adriene, for helping me fix my moral compass, replacing my negative inner dialogue with positive thinking and helping me become the best version of myself that I can be each day. You have no idea how many times a day I tell myself to breathe, lots of love in and lots of love out, find length and grounding, smile... and it works! :) <br />Thank you sincerely for being the best yoga teacher in the world and reading our minds. <br />Namaste &lt;3",Yuzik,2021-01-23T09:39:52Z,0

"You got me in the end there, Adriene! <b>shakes fist</b><br /><br />Laying on my back thinking how deceptively hardcore boat pose is, you ask me how I was feeling, and I actually paid attention. I felt proud! It was far from perfect or graceful, but I did it. And I smiled. And then cried, but it was because I was happy. Thank you.",Lady Mondegreen,2021-01-23T07:28:14Z,0

"I&#39;ve been suffering from long covid for 10 months now and haven&#39;t been able to return to any of my former workouts. My lungs can&#39;t even handle going on a walk now, much less a run. Being unable to do any cardio activity or really even leave the house, I turned to your yoga channel. Previously, I&#39;d always found it frustrating to sit still and try to breathe (much harder than it sounds!), but yoga has now become an incredibly meaningful part of my day. When I&#39;m here doing the practice, I feel myself healing and growing strong and learning to understand and love the body I now find myself in. This has become a highlight of each day.

But oh boy how I needed it. You helped me realize that if I&#39;m in pain it&#39;s because I&#39;m alive, and you helped me feel how the pain faded away during this practice. And of course I took your invitation to cry. I feel so good and grateful that I can&#39;t even find words, but thank you Adrienne ❤️ and thank you Benji in your beautiful shavasana :) Your work is unbelievable awesome, only spreads love and health.

I’ve had to take a couple days off due to my sinuses and period exhaustion and I was nervous about coming back to the practice. This morning my head was still hurting too much when I held it down but I was feeling fine at work all day (and took an aspirin earlier 😅) so I just decided to try again on the mat and it felt so good!! Thank you Adriene!,Jennifer Lina,2021-01-18T16:42:33Z,1

"I&#39;m sure that those with severe depression who are embarking on this journey can understand and sympathize with those days where even getting out of bed can be a challenge. The last two days have been exactly like that for me, and I missed both days of yoga. As I came back onto the mat today, I expected to feel shame and disappointment - and yet the moment that I sat down and took the first breath, all I felt was gratitude toward myself for choosing to come back to the journey, and gratitude toward Adrienne for creating a space that celebrates the fact that you&#39;ve showed up in the first place. To my friends on this video who are dealing with feelings of shame and self doubt, who missed a day (or three), or who just struggled to show up at all - it&#39;s my wish that you can extend some love and gratitude toward yourself for choosing to show up for yourself. &lt;3",Alana Dyer,2021-01-17T17:31:18Z,624

When I first started this journey I would best myself up over not doing the practice just because I simply couldn’t get out of bed and then try and do like 3 videos worth in a day. Then I told myself how insane that was and there’s no reason this journey can’t take more than 30 days. No one sets the rules but myself 😌,Hailey Austin,2021-03-02T04:16:55Z,2

I cried through most of today&#39;s practice. And I discovered an entirely new way to be in boat pose - focusing on the upward current of energy on the front body and anchoring with the downward current in the back body changes everything. So rewarding!,GoldenSaviMonkey,2021-01-17T13:57:38Z,0

Feeling grateful for this journey. Can&#39;t believe we are almost halfway. So glad to be here. <br /><br />Does anyone else feel pain (like a stretching pain but still quite sharp) in the rest pose during the boat session? I&#39;m just curious what that&#39;s all about... tension in the back of the neck I suppose.,Jen Medos,2021-01-15T13:54:50Z,0
"I&#39;ve been following Adriene&#39;s channel for around 5 years, on and off. Whenever she said in a video that some poses or meditation moments may make you emotional, I always thought I didn&#39;t see that happening for me, personally. Today I was smiling trying to find my balance in boat pose, but as soon as she said &quot;if you need to cry just let it out&quot;, I immediately started crying. Instantly, like someone flipped a switch. I didn&#39;t realize how much tension I had bottled up inside. Reading the comments I see I&#39;m not the only one. Thank you so much for helping us take care of ourselves :)",Elena I. C.,2021-01-15T13:48:09Z,65

"I am so grateful for this practice! <br><br>Today was hard to show up for. I was busy all day and then sometime in the last hour or two I got really nauseous. Normally, I think I would have tried to force myself through my regular workout and burned out by the time I got to my yoga practice but with the daily reminder/emphasis on self love and self care I.... took the night off. <br><br>Which is new and different, for me. <br><br>I decided to come to show up for &quot;Breath&quot;, before relaxing the rest of the night. Today&#39;s theme of focusing on how we feel was especially interesting because I think I actually feel considerably better than when I unfolded my mat. Physically, I DO feel really tired, I DO feel nauseous. I apparently have a little bit of a headache too, and some of my joints are stiff and bothering me.  I think I have a little nagging anxiety floating around somewhere in the background. But I realized how much I need to ACTUALLY let myself rest. And now I will do just that. Because I deserve it. I deserve to rest and recover.  More importantly, I intend to make more of a conscious effort to stop everything when I&#39;m checking in with myself moving forward so I don&#39;t &quot;steamroll&quot; over my own needs like I nearly did tonight.",Taylor Gilstrap,2021-01-15T04:34:44Z,0

"I used to hate yoga before I found your channel! Mostly because I always felt inadequate for not being able to “do” the movements, so I’d get frustrated and say it wasn’t for me. Then I did your 30 day program in 2019 and realized I had been wrong. You taught me to feel the movements and do what feels good in my body—but most importantly, you have helped me to be more loving and caring with myself even when I struggle. Now I love yoga. I love the way it slows me down, and gets me to connect and appreciate the effort. You gave me that gift. Thank you for the constant reminders of that throughout this series, and especially today. I needed it! ❤️",Debi M,2021-01-15T03:30:12Z,0

"feeling feelings hehe Yesterday&#39;s practice was tough; there are some poses that are very challenging for my inflexible body. But I&#39;ve been thinking about these two seemingly simple concepts that Adriene keeps repeating: listen to your body, find what feels good. So I&#39;ve been frustrated a couple of times during this program &#39;cause my body cannot do some stuff, but just connecting to my body is such a win for me. I listen to it, and I adapt to what feels good. I now try to be very mindful about what my body is saying, and I can feel tightness in some parts, soreness, where I put the most amount of pressure, even some sinus pressure (lol)... but just that by itself is huge for me. Is a deeper way to love oneself and one&#39;s body. So thank you, Adriene, and the whole YWA community. I&#39;ll keep practicing, though, so see if I can become better at some poses.",yarielisa,2021-01-15T03:23:40Z,0

Even in my yoga practice I am often stuck in judgement if I&#39;m doing it &#39;right&#39; or the &#39;right/perfect&#39; way- it makes difficult to find what feels good (and I&#39;ve been practicing a long time!).

"Hi, Adriane, and thanks for making available and for free all this awesome yoga programmes. I have just a small suggestion of something that I found useful for me, maybe as a non native English speaker and as someone very new to yoga. When you do poses that involve  repetition on both sides of the body, maybe you could start not facing us, so with your back toward the camera, so we can face the screen and better see the pose. I found that sometimes when my back is turned towards the screen and I don&#39;t totally understand your verbal suggestions I tend to do some movements wrong. This is easily corrected when you repeat the pose on the other side. So why not start with the back to the camera so we do the position correctly from the start. I suppose other people might have noticed that. Of course in time you grow to learn the positions and you don&#39;t need to watch the screen all the time, but there&#39;s always something new that you notice, so, sorry, if my comment is silly, but I do hope  you will consider my suggestion. For me it will make an improvement. Thanks again for everything, namaste",Ioana ALBERT,2021-01-15T11:41:02Z,1

"2 things, show up, breathe.  For 12 days I have done both. Today my body wanted on the mat. Huge success, though on first rising to our feet the body needed a chair for strength and stability. The rest of the session was show up, breathe and do discrete small movements of postures.  I finish day 13 with great love and appreciation. See you tomorrow.  Healing continues. 🙏🏼",Patsy Ruth,2021-01-15T01:14:29Z,0

I took it easy, drank a lot of fruit juice, rested, and today I felt better and was able to do days 12 and 13. whatever kind of energy these two practiced moved, it was just what I needed. I had been feeling so sad I couldn&#39;t even manage to cry, and today as soon as the practice ended I got the emotional release I needed. still sad, but my chest doesn&#39;t feel as heavy. thank you as always &lt;3",yumekai1,2021-01-15T01:09:13Z,0

I just want to survive and I want yoga to help me survive for my kid. I&#39;m sorry but this is pure ideology of the times, the world has gone to sh.t and the kids will pay the price. and I think I&#39;ll migrate to another channel, as this one has become painful for me. especially now that it has become an empire of its own.",michelveben,2021-03-18T07:28:11Z,0

"Wonderful session as usual.  <br />      A modest suggestion:  A friend of mine with spinal stenosis like me, but worse, so she had surgery said she tried this program but stopped because she couldn&#39;t do &quot;half of the moves&quot;.  I replied I couldn&#39;t do about a third of them but I still enjoyed it.  I thought about how tonight I could do a boat with no problem, I have trouble with simply sitting cross legged for any length of time because I tore an ankle tendon two years ago.  Adrienne, you&#39;re great at presenting alternatives for many postures, but maybe you can include options for even simple things - like sitting or doing a cobra (again tough for people with back conditions).<br />     Thanks for reading this, and for all that you do.",David Gottsegen,2021-01-15T00:33:49Z,1

"Day 13. Check! Today was very special to me. First of all, it was the day I felt most aware and present. I could tell that in the boat pose, where I felt extremely strong, the strongest I ever felt in that pose. I did everything as I wished, as I felt, and I noticed a huge difference. At the end I even enjoyed the meditation part, which usually feels bitter sweet to me, because even though it makes me feel good, it also makes me feel frustrated and impatient.<br />Second of all, this practice got me thinking about feeling fear. Sometimes I struggle to control my thoughts, and at times they can fill my whole mind with negative things, mostly related to my fears. So here I am, asking this question to myself, Adriene and everyone else reading this: how do you cope with this feeling, with fear?<br />This is an important subject to me.<br />Thank you everyone, see you tomorrow.

"Hi Adriene, <br />I know you said there&#39;s no cheating for the boat pose, but form wise, and health wise for the spine, is it okay to balance more on the low back rather than right on top of the tailbone? Balancing on the tailbone kind of hurts.",Mr Chickie,2021-01-15T00:22:00Z,0

Thank you again Adriene, you truly are in tune with so many people.. the timings of your words are in perfect sync to how many of us feel at that specific moment. <br />To everyone else on this magnificent journey, I say it most days but you really do motivate and inspire me. <br />Can&#39;t believe it&#39;s day 13 already!

"Dear Adrienne, I started this video with a very heavy feeling, after having a bad breakdown this evening and I was so scared to show up today, thinking I will just skip today like I would normally do when my head starts playing tricks on me... I normally just give myself in to this helpless feeling. Well I remembered your words and how the hardest part is showing up so I promised to myself to at least try it. I started with tears in my eyes so when you said we could wipe some tears I most definitely did that but before I knew it I was smiling at your comments and suddenly it felt like I had a friend next to me, comforting me on this challenging evening ... I’m so very grateful for your work and for being so real and authentic. I keep dreaming to see you one day in person. Sending you so much love from Belgium ❤️",Boyana Atanasova,2021-01-14T22:43:56Z,0
Every time after finishing my practice I ask my self what I&#39;ve learnt and how I feel. today I set and told myself well I don&#39;t know what I have learnt but I feel soo good I guess that was the point😂❤️if I&#39;m making any sense thank you again &amp; again my best friend 💜and thank you my sweet fam😍,Aya Aly,2021-01-14T22:43:47Z,0

"I really hope that my comment is seen as constructive criticism as I am a fan of Adriene&#39;s practices and have been following them for over two years now. <br />In this 30 day journey there have been many moments where I have felt that Adriene&#39;s small-talk/chatter/singing(in another practice) distracts from the practice. As these practices are more focused on breathing, the chatter has me distracted. Maybe I am the only one. <br />Really hope this comment isn&#39;t perceived in any negative way, as I do appreciate being part of the practice with a worldwide group.  :)",Sabeena Fatima,2021-01-14T22:39:47Z,1

"I’ve been practicing yoga for about 7 years now on and off, and for several years following some of Adriene’s videos. Today was a challenge getting to the mat. I was a bit low energy and had already went for a jog today so I wasn’t very motivated. This was the perfect practice that I needed. I don’t think I’ve ever felt so deeply rooted in either boat pose or the yogic squat. I’m not naturally very flexible and always struggle with core-centered poses, so both of these have come such a long way in my time doing yoga. I used to have to hold on to my legs for dear life in boat and couldn’t even come close to a low squat (it looked more like a high squat with heels raised). Now I can fully extend my boat pose with relative ease and come down completely in the squat with heels down and no support from my hands. Yoga is all about the small moments that make you feel connected and accomplished. Thanks for another great 30 day journey, Adriene! Namaste, y’all!",saxamaphoneguy1,2021-01-14T22:31:17Z,0

"At the end i burst into tears when I bowed to myself. At that moment I felt so proud of everything that I am doing and have done and how strong I am for making it through a very tough last year and starting a new year with open arms and an open heart. I really felt so much love towards myself and I cried because I felt proud for the very first time in a long time! I always underestimated and doubted myself and that seemed to pull me back from a lot of opportunities and challenges. Now I am able to embrace and welcome what is and let it go. When I cried i felt so relieved because i know I&#39;ve been holding back my tears. It&#39;s this time that I begin to accept, embrace and welcome (with love ofc). Sending so much love to everyone.

"My body had a lot of aches and pains today :( I thought I would need to do additional yoga after today&#39;s video but the freedom to move and create our own routine helped a lot today. Adriene is a mind-reader. The practices are always exactly what I need on that particular day. I can also see a huge difference in my mentality since starting my personal YWA journey during the 1st lockdown. I would beat myself up for not being able to have perfect posture in a position or for falling out of a position. Today, I fell out of the yogi squat (despite being able to do it during yesterday&#39;s practice) and, instead of taking it as a failure, I rolled on my back and laughed because today is a different day. I shouldn&#39;t beat myself up about such small things.",Catherine Simpson,2021-01-14T21:40:26Z,0

"Feeling so grateful for this journey so far! Never felt that replenished and filled with love and energy, especially in that time of the year! Definitely feeling the stress, anxiety and a heavy weight going away, while being lifted by love with you kind words! I can&#39;t believe how peaceful I leave the mat each day, and that is a blessing knowing the negative energies surrounding me lately! Thank you for every single video! And thank you for that moment you mentioned humility : It touched me so deeply and brought peace to my insecure heart that I know I will cary it with me from now on! <br /><br />Lots of love! Namaste!",Adeline,2021-01-14T20:44:29Z,1
"Today is my 24th birthday : ) I wish I could feel happy but all I can feel is an overwhelming sadness - at being quarantined, about dropping out of school, and being helpless to ease my sister&#39;s chemo sickness. But Adrienne gave me permission to be sad today, to feel my heartache and cry a little during yoga. I accept my sadness today and look forward to a day in future that I can celebrate becoming a year older. Sending love to everyone from California. Hugs and kisses.",Sasha Albano,2021-01-14T20:44:21Z,0

I&#39;ve got some fluid in my inner ear which makes me dizzy and I&#39;m on a heavy dosage of steroids, which makes it hard for me to breathe but I&#39;m learning to honor every moment and every breath, no matter how difficult it is. :) Thank you Adriene for another beautiful practice.",Tracey Bureau,2021-01-14T18:49:16Z,0

"My cat conveniently set herself in just the right spot for luvvies during those first &quot;feel your way through&quot; twists,  they involved lots of cat petting.

"Not only do I have a lot of fat on my stomach and thighs getting in the way, I have short arms, so some of these poses are hard for me to even get into. For example: coming out of the squat and into boat, I can&#39;t put both my hands on the ground behind me, I can only manage one. But I still come to practice, and I&#39;m learning to love and accept that my body has some extra plush on it. That plush doesn&#39;t change how strong I can be, nor does it change my worth. It may inhibit some flexibility, but that&#39;s okay. As I do more yoga and slowly do more activity I will find ways around it and it will slowly go down, allowing for more movement.",Elizabeth Schwartz,2021-01-14T18:05:02Z,1

Stress about last minute scheduling for classes was eating me up, I didn&#39;t feel well which was leading to a horrible lack of energy and I just dreaded getting my mat out to move around today. But I&#39;m glad I made it for myself. I needed to check in with my body, and I needed to let go of that stress, even just for a bit. Pupdate: by far her calmest day, which is phenomenal since I haven&#39;t yet mentioned that she has some pretty bad anxiety issues from her life before I adopted her.

"Hello from London, my lovely friends! When we were in boat pose, it made me think of something I heard recently from Roshi Joan Halifax, a Buddhist teacher. She says, ‘Strong back, soft front.’<br /><br />In her own words: ‘All too often our so-called strength comes from fear not love; instead of having a strong back, many of us have a defended front shielding a weak spine. In other words, we walk around brittle and defensive, trying to conceal our lack of confidence. If we strengthen our backs, metaphorically speaking, and develop a spine that’s flexible but sturdy, then we can risk having a front that’s soft and open, representing choiceless compassion. The place in your body where these two meet — strong back and soft front — is the brave, tender ground in which to root our caring deeply.’<br /><br />Just thought it was wise and beautiful, and seemed fitting. I’ve had a very chaotic day so far, but this practice felt like a total energetic reset so I can move through the rest of my day stress-free, amongst the chaos 🥰🙏🏻",Chloë C,2021-01-14T17:27:28Z,220

However, the fitness side is nice too and what I thought of today, was that working out, exercising, moving your body (which ever ecpression you prefer) can be sooo much fun! The process of putting in the work and seeing your practises grow is so rewarding. I wish more people could see it this way because the fitness culture kind of makes us see what&#39;s missing, what we need to get rid of, how we can shrink etc. What if we, instead, thought about how we could grow and noticed how far we&#39;ve already come? That&#39;s my spiel, namaste!",Helmi Järvinen,2021-01-14T15:30:20Z,1

Thanks for this wonderful day of play today. One of my resolutions for this year is to play with failure and humility.

Also, when we were doing the twist on our knees and you mentioned the arm not being able to get all the way up, I have never felt more seen.

Today’s session found my mind drifting to the security guard at my local small grocery store &amp; how appreciative I was of her for helping me with the breads. I have seen her forever but never had a reason to speak to her. She offered to assist me. She didn’t know why the bread hadn’t been available for weeks. She liked it too (whole wheat 30 calories per slice) and noticed it hadn’t been stocked lately, but we connected in such a warm &amp; genuine way that made me feel good. 💗 I’m empathic so this must mean I need to go check on her.",Tosha O'Neal,2021-01-14T14:23:16Z,1

"I used to do a meditation and short pilates video every morning leading up to this yoga journey. Then I decided to just do these videos especially since some of them are longer than 20 minutes. Even though I still do like meditation and pilates, this yoga journey is exactly what my body and soul have been needing this month! I am reading a book right now about how to let go of shame and how about embracing your vulnerability actually gives you power over your feelings. And it really aligned with today. When we were in a seated pose in the beginning and Adriene was talking about letting go what you think you know about yoga and how we need to just feel it out, I realized I was not feeling it. I was feeling shame for being hunched over and not having enough energy to sit up straight as much because of my back and neck tightness. I realized though that, that was what I needed to feel, not shame but feel how my body was feeling today. When I wiggled my way into what I was actually feeling and not what I thought I should be feeling, the entire practice changed for me. And also with the wiggling and finding how my body moved in cat/cow and then to downward facing dog, also helped me just feel for myself. Thank you Adriene! Each day I feel a little stronger, a little happier, and a little more myself.",Melanie H,2021-01-14T13:20:05Z,0

My dog Pepper was my companion for today&#39;s practice which I loved. He wanted me to play with Elmo his little toy who has tried to destroy but can&#39;t.

"Breath day 13. Day 102 of return to YWA. Felt rather unmotivated today. Finished all my grading and was home an hour and a half earlier due to a temporary change in my Tuesday, Thursday teaching schedule. But as Adriene says, the toughest part can be getting to the mat. A little of the edge of the bla-ness has come off because I managed to do just that and complete the day. Enjoy everyone! 💙",William B,2021-01-14T12:08:14Z,2

"I&#39;m sooo glad you said that about humility, because I was frustrated with my body that is recovering from thyroid issues and has a bit more to it than I&#39;m used to.  I wasn&#39;t able to be in the squat for very long and when you talked about humility I was like, &quot;Hey that&#39;s right, I&#39;ll take that.&quot;  Then I really felt the upwards and downwards currents in boat, which I&#39;ve struggled with in the past! Thanks Adriene, and thanks to the 4, 000 other yogis that did the practice with me! And all of you practicing.  Keep on showing up!",Anna Maspero,2021-01-14T11:49:19Z,36
"So loved to read this comment! Often I find it’s with the poses that hold more of a challenge to fully express, ow actually where the magic is if I just allow myself to do what I can in that moment and then be present, I feel the energy.

This practice allowed me to feel so much, it hit home hard. But mostly I felt gratitude, cause I know no matter how much time we stay apart, the connection we have is stronger than any distance, in time or space. I love them and and they love me back, and this love is what gives me strength to move forward.

Thanks Adrienne. I so appreciate you. Over the years I’ve been interested in yoga but never stuck with it until now. Your ‘ find what feels good’ was just the permission I needed. I’ve found that over time with you far more things start to make sense. The breathing which was so difficult at first is really helpful now. I find that it kicks in throughout the day to combat moments of stress. You are a star and a real blessing. God bless you xx,Moira Pinches,2021-01-14T11:34:49Z,0

"This may very well be my favorite practice so far. Of course it was as timely as ever, and it really helped me focus inwards and &quot;give the thinking mind a break&quot; (something I should definitely do more often). Your words were once again confirming things I knew but needed to hear again, and feeling myself through the practice was a great change that allowed me, surprise... to lean into the poses and find what feels good. Special mention to the yogi squat, which is hands down one of my favorites, and allowed me to feel very grounded and connected to the earth. Also, I <b>almost</b> managed to straighten my legs for the last boat and stuck with it all the way through, incontrollable shakes and all. PS. In hovering tabletop position, Adriene: &quot;Maybe you lift the right foot&quot;. Me: &quot;Hahahaha&quot; :) See you all tomorrow!",Marion Carminelitta,2021-01-14T10:46:29Z,0

"Just loving this series 💜 I found a couple of the first few days quite tough - reminded me a bit of how I felt with Dedicate 😱 But having settled into my breath, I’ve found the last week to be really yummy (even core day 6!!) and am feeling so much calmer and grounded. Thank you Adriene, and Benji!",Ellen L,2021-01-14T10:03:43Z,0
Hey Adriene.  Thank you for a wonderful practice this morning.  I have to say that&#39;s the first time I have completed boat pose with a smile on my face!!!  Feeling proud :-),Jenni Phillips,2021-01-14T10:03:26Z,1

"In the squat.... Adriene: &quot;Ground through the back body&quot; Me: grounds so hard I roll over backwards! <br />Seriously though, today brought me to a little revelation. I started looking into yoga a couple of years ago now as a way to stretch and improve my flexibility, having always scoffed and turned my nose up at it before as some sort of hippy thang. Adriene sold it to me so much I&#39;ve lost count of how long I&#39;ve been doing a video (almost) daily, sometimes even twice a day. And although I&#39;ve gained some flexibility and can get into poses I couldn&#39;t to start with, I&#39;d never really stopped to think about the mental aspects. I&#39;ve lost count of how many times my husband has complained that I&#39;ve changed over the last couple of years, moaning that I stand up for myself now and don&#39;t just bow down and take s**t like I used to. Hadn&#39;t put the two together until I listened to what Adriene was saying today and the penny suddenly dropped: yoga has taught me to care for and about myself! It has changed the way I think about myself, and that has changed the way I act and react to the world around me. Possibly not good for that world, but good for ME!",Eleanor Hawkins,2021-01-14T09:51:01Z,35

"Hey Eleanor. Thanks a lot for sharing. I´m sure, in the end it´s the best for the world that you show up for your self. Maybe this beautiful quote by Marianne Williamson is just for you:  &quot;....Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won&#39;t feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others. &quot;",Sam Wild,2021-01-15T06:32:26Z,1
"It’s the first anniversary of my ex-husband’s death today.  Thank you for the invitation to sit in stillness and just notice how we feel.  We feel and continue moving.

"‘Notice what it feels like to be alive today here. You might just smile or laugh a little here. If you need to cry, just let it out.’ To be honest I did all three. I smiled, laughed and cried. My emotions were quite out of control today and I didn’t really know how to deal with them. The mat is...truly a comforting place, isn’t it? It really allows you to be who you are and connect with the present moment.",Raphah Raysa,2021-01-14T09:40:47Z,4

What?! I can extend my legs from the boat pose! I&#39;ve never been able to do that.

Today I learnt that Yoga is much more fun if I fail at least once in a posture - because then I have to smile and can&#39;t take myself so serious anymore :D And I hope this will continue throughout my day - letting go of always wanting to be perfect and instead connect to myself and smile and be humble :),Lio Lioness,2021-01-14T09:27:16Z,1

"I burst into tears when you said the word humility. It has been a tough time for all of us. I have been stubborn and trying to go against the current, and it has been exhausting. I forgot to find what feels good, because I have been in survival mode. I forgot to be grateful because there are so many things that didn’t turn out the way I wanted to. I forgot to be graceful because, well, there is no one to present myself to. But this, this practice made me realised there are so many ways to take care of oneself and others, there are so many things that are worthy of my gratitude, and most importantly, I am here for me. So I can choose to be graceful for myself, because I have been showing up for myself every single day for the past five years or so on the yoga mat. I am proud of myself, and I am ready to face the challenge. Whatever life throws at us, we are stronger, at least together, you guys give me the strength! Thank you for this practice!

"I have been doing Yoga with Adriene for a little while now (I finished Dedicate in December), and I am noticing how much more aware of my body I have become. I started noticing - off the mat - how I feel in my feet and toes while I am sitting on my bed, or how my legs and chest feel while I am moving around my apartment. And the more I notice, the more I understand not to take my body for granted. It almost reminds me of my childhood, when I was a kid and would enjoy doing all kinds of stretches and exercises because doing them felt like a discovery of my capabilities. It&#39;s strange how our mindset shifts to &quot;exercise as a health chore&quot; later on in life and we don&#39;t even notice or question this shift.",Тамара Солтис,2021-01-14T08:20:31Z,0

"I&#39;m now addicted to YWA. <br /><br />When I first started a few months ago, I struggled to get through the moves. Now I&#39;m able to float through most of them. This has taught me about patience and the importance of trying again and again even when the expected result is not how I&#39;d imagined it to be the first time. <br /><br />I celebrate the small successes that build up to larger goals. <br /><br />For those of you that feel this is a struggle, you&#39;ve already succeeded by showing up. Pay attention to the littlest changes during your daily practice. They really add up.",Aisha Abdi,2021-01-14T07:55:02Z,1

I meditated and the feelings didn’t surface, but when I sat on the yoga mat and you asked us to feel, it all came flooding out and I felt overwhelmed by so many things and the tears fell, but after I released this feeling, I could move on and I felt all the moves in this practice and felt grounded by this and the connection of breath. Thank you. I feel strong and centred and ready to embrace my day. Namaste xo",Madeline Prusmann,2021-01-14T07:50:41Z,0

Im a senior in high school right now and needless to say it&#39;s been a rough year and my grades haven&#39;t been doing so hot and with everything going on in the world I don&#39;t really feel comfortable going out of state for college anymore. I actually managed to stumble across this channel by accident since I was just trying to find something to do in quarantine and I&#39;ve been overweight since 6th grade but I never thought about doing yoga and I can say with certainty that this is the most motivated I have felt in a while. When this first started I could barely hold plank and downward dog but I can tell how much I&#39;ve improved and it&#39;s a GREAT feeling. So thank you Adriene and thank you to everyone out there doing this challenge the second week is almost over and I honestly didn&#39;t think I&#39;d make it this far!!🥰🥰,Katsrule All the time,2021-01-14T07:14:13Z,666

Love your body right where you are and see how far you’ve come. You will grow into being an amazing woman with self confidence and love for your body regardless of the shape or size. Your comment has touched me deeply. 🙏🏻💞 <br />Best of luck to you the rest of your senior year and in college😊🙏🏻,Rebecca Palmer,2021-01-16T17:47:27Z,0

Hope you find joy in small moments today. &lt;3,Jen Medos,2021-01-15T14:00:52Z,1
"Once in an old video Adriene said, you don&#39;t start loving yoga until you start loving downward dog &amp; for me it was so true! At first yoga felt like a chore unless it was the short 6 minute bedtime videos, mostly because my downward dogs were so difficult and I felt so weak. Once I started craving them at the end of a long day (lately everyday), my whole relationship with yoga changed. Welcome to the club friend :)",Jade Boyd,2021-01-15T06:31:14Z,0

"Adriene, there was a time in my life where I was in pretty bad shape with ptsd. See, I am a paramedic, or at least I was. The stress was getting to me. I wasn&#39;t sleeping, I was so on edge at work that I would become really unwell even when I heard other crews calls come in over the radio. I was in the worst shape and had to make a decision on how to move forward. Either deal with my mental health, or... well I decided the alternative wasn&#39;t an option. <br /><br />I found Revolution. The 30 day challenge you did back in 17 (I think). And I think it was in one of those videos, when holding a plank far longer than I thought I could, you said &quot;find your inner smile&quot;. I don&#39;t want to oversell this, but those four words and the practice that they represented, well, it may have saved my life. <br /><br />Thank you for being your caring, authentic, amazing self. Thank you for sharing your practice with me, and millions of others. You&#39;ll never be able to know how grateful I am. I know that the opportunity will likely never come where I am able to repay you but I want you to know that because you were able to help me, I&#39;ve been able to help others. <br /><br />Keep being awesome.<br /><br />Edit: fixed the misspelling of Adriene&#39;s name ❤️",Randy Conrad,2021-01-14T06:31:43Z,2104

"Doing yoga has helped me implement breath and balance into my life as an equestrian. I find myself working on my breath when a horse isn’t listening or is scared. Telling my riding students to find their center or find an upward current of energy up the front body  and a downward current down the back. I love that these simple ideas are a great help to something as intricate as horseback riding, which has a lot to do with posture, balance, and emotions.

"You know being on the mat has really made me reflect and realize each day that this isn’t just a workout for me anymore, but it’s become more of a safe calming place for me, a very therapeutic place. I love it! I feel this is truly a gift, especially regarding how Adriene is not forceful in her approach with us, allows each of us to be who we are (at our own pace) on this journey and to be happy in that.  It’s all ok.. just show up on the mat, do your best and that’s enough! <br />Adriene you’re truly a light in this world and I can’t thank you enough for this special time you give us each year to do these yoga practices together. It’s really the best feeling and I can’t think of a better way to start the new year right. 🙏❤️ Sorry this was long, everyone enjoy today’s practice.😊",Holly,2021-01-14T06:02:43Z,353
