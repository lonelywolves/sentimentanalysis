"The thing about at home yoga is, it’s all you, baby. <br />The orchestra of science and soul that play out when you choose to show up, press play, and just...<br />Begin again.<br />Wherever you are,<br />With whatever you’ve got.<br />It’s heroic. <br />Really. And you have it in you.",Yoga With Adriene,2019-12-08T15:13:41Z,674

"I’ve been doing your flexibility video for two weeks, and did the beginners for the first week.<br />I’ve noticed that during the first week I was really motivated and managed to not only do it everyday, but workout everyday too. Then the second week I slacked a little but still kept motivated, and this week I’ve found it really difficult and my sleeping pattern has started slipping.<br />So, I did the flexibility routine and wanted to do some more and as someone with depression, even though I don’t feel depressed mentally, my body is acting like it does when I’m starting to spiral, so I thought I’d do this routine. <br />What I did not expect was to cry almost immediately as soon as I was in extended child’s pose. It’s as if my body let the emotion out, and then allowed the rest of the practice to heal whatever needs to be healed. I’m still quite weepy as I type this, but it feels like it’s emotion my body needed to let out but was holding back. I think now, I’m going to add this routine in to my daily yoga practice. It was really cleansing. Thank you, Adriene.",Bea X,2020-05-07T13:01:21Z,1

"Dear Adriene,<br /><br />I&#39;m so grateful for your gift of sharing yoga and welcoming me as I am. Somehow, each day that I hit the mat, you seem to know the exact words that my heart and soul need to hear.  I feel seen, held, connected and like I can breathe.  I can remember my breath.

"Dearest Adriene, the moment where you brought attention to Benji putting his paw on your hand made me a bit teary.<br />My dog Gloria often comes up to me sometimes and lays her head on my leg. I think its her way of giving a hug.<br />My poor puppers got a terminal colon cancer diagnosis earlier this week, and its been tough. I live away from home, and since we all need to do our part during this odd time in history, I&#39;ve not been home to see her.<br />There are worse things going on in the world than my dog having cancer, but this time has (hopefully) made us realize that its the outlets of love and happiness, however small (or furry) that get us through the tough times. And the thought of losing my dog at all, let alone at such a time, kinda shattered my heart.<br />So oddly, my stress went up a bit while watching this video, but it also let me cry as well. By the end, I was breathing steady, and though still crying, I was ok. She had lived an amazing life after we got her (poor girl is a rescue, and was horrifically abused and neglected before we got her), and as long as she goes to her final sleep without much pain, I will be grateful.<br /><br />So thanks to Adriene, thanks to Benji, thanks to yoga, and thanks to my Gloria (as in Gaynor, because she will survive 😊)..... you are all outlets for good and love 💖<br />LOVE AND GRATITUDE 💖🐶💋",Chrissie M,2020-04-28T09:18:16Z,3

"I never used to &#39;get&#39; yoga and I always used to find it so hard to focus because I&#39;m so used to multitasking and being busy, so when I used to attempt yoga I&#39;d be constantly thinking about all the things I had to do and hoping this would just hurry up and be over with - even when I tried super hard to stay focus and clear my mind it gave me too much anxiety that I was going to forget about something important I needed to do. Long story short I did a week of yoga on the trip as it was free and it helped me understand it more, and feel what it also does to your body physically. So every now and again I do some yoga (particularly yours Adriene), when I&#39;m feeling particularly like I need it and I can&#39;t believe how calm I feel afterwards. It&#39;s amazing. I&#39;ve recently started a workout regime so am mainly focusing on that during lockdown, but am going to try and add some more yoga to my time as well. Thank you for sharing all of your videos and practises with us. Very grateful.",Olivia Baker-Smith,2020-04-26T11:44:57Z,1

"Yesterday was a particularly stressful day.<br />Since the beginning of the lockdown, I&#39;ve come to notice that I&#39;ve reached a point in my life where I&#39;m comfortable in my own skin, in my professional environment, and where I want to keep going on the directions that I&#39;ve discovered through my regular introspection.<br />At 28 years old, I&#39;m extremely privileged, lucky and grateful for everything life has come to offer me. And I shall never forget this.<br />Yesterday might have been harder, to the point that it turned my stomach to stone, but I&#39;m alive. I&#39;m happy. I want to do my best for me, my family, my friends, the people I can help and this planet.<br />I feel at peace.<br />Thank you, again, Adriene 💙🙏",Rianne Cabanier,2020-04-20T17:42:10Z,49

"I have really terrible anxiety. I feel like YWA helps a lot. Of course, I have my days where my anxiety is so bad that I am even unable to do some simple yoga. But I also definitely feel the powerful benefits it has when I do manage to complete it. I originally started with the 30 days of yoga last year. I managed to pull through for 30 days and I actually completed it to my own amazement. After that I felt lost, and sadly ended up doing yoga as in when ai wanted, which was almost once a month. Now I&#39;m currently trying to get back into the habit of yoga again and started the playlist TRUE current made it to day 6. As Adrienne says, a little goes a long way. Even if I give up at least I know I can always come back to yoga. ☺️💚. I can&#39;t say my anxiety has improved, it may have but maybe I haven&#39;t noticed. But I can say that it has made me established more goals such as being able to do the splits and be flexible. I can finally almost touch my heel to the floor in downward dog!! This is definitely thanks to Adrienne. Also, after doing 30 days I was very much strict to what she was doing, but now in true I like to add my own stretches if I feel it&#39;s missing something. Which I love. Also, because of my anxiety and OCD I sometimes give up 5 minutes in, but I&#39;ll leave it an hour or 2 and try again and carry on 😂 it may sound a bit like a cheat but I feel accomplished if I at least complete the video. Another thing I really love is Adrienne&#39;s way if talking about yoga. This may sound stereotypical of me but a lot of the yoga teachers of YT I find talk as if they are some enlightened spiritualist who believe they are also psychic healers or act like fitness instructors and are sort of full of themselves in my opinion. When it&#39;s Adrienne she is so comfortable and calming and down to earth with it. Explaining don&#39;t worry if you can&#39;t do this or that, or everyone starts somewhere. It makes me feel so much at ease knowing i don&#39;t have to push myself or work myself to hard. I feel like imthis has taught me life lessons to not push myself to hard. So THANK YOU so much Adrienne. I hope to carry on my journey with you.<br /><br />Can you please do yoga sessions for students? I am a student teenager and would love to see one on exam stress or students stress which could work things like the back, the neck, wrists, feet, cramps. Things to keep you awake but also things to help you sleep because a lot of students panic beforehand. Maybe even a back to school/work yoga session? etc. <br /><br />This was long I&#39;m so sorry to who reads this 😂🙏",Ambers Utopia,2019-12-26T01:21:39Z,57

I am sure people around the World are so grateful.   <br />I have after a lot of thinking.decided to share my story and How your help. makes me in contact with feelings I have hidden away for so many years.. <br /> . I have a narcissistic mother I had alcoholic father, i suffered a traumatic sexuel rape when I was thirteen, and after seven years it came cleare that i had become psychiatric sick.. obvious. I was iin different treatments. hospitals, etc. For 30 years I was dianosed with scitzofrenia, and of course i was descriped medicin conected, to this, about five years ago, they relized that i had bipolar, that gives heavy depressions wich was finally discovered. , I was so happy ,, I had to survive on wrong medicin so it was important to keep my feelings in control.

This week has been rough. I had finals and my father was diagnosed with high blood pressure and Diabetes type 2. I have been feeling so much stress that I had shooting pains in my neck and down my arms. I thought to myself I need to get this tension out of my body. I started this lesson by crying. I ended it relaxed and feeling more centered and like myself.,OhSoAshley0,2019-12-11T07:12:26Z,17
"OhSoAshley0 sorry about your father but there are better medications out there now for your dad’s condition. My sister has had very high blood pressure all her adult life. She is now 75. Has had pneumonia twice this year, recovered nicely then her daughter died. She struggled with that and her blood pressure did rise during this time but her doctor worked out effective medications. I think your dad will be fine but will have to adjust to a new normal. Good luck with your college classes. I have a B.S.E. And received a M.E. While working full time. In college I worked part time so I relate to the stress you can feel during finals. But, I solved that problem by studying everyday, doing my homework then going over all my other classes’ notes. A friend taught me this because I never had to study in high school. By doing this every night, I really didn’t have to study much for tests or finals. I was on the Dean’s list or President’s list every semester. I so appreciate my friend taking the time to teach me how to study. I also learned shorthand to take notes.",Shelley Thompson,2020-09-13T12:25:03Z,2

"I stopped doing yoga for a month or more because I had an onslaught of health issues. Unfortunately this time it was my knee, I had a weird joint problem that doctors couldn&#39;t figure out. I tackled this month&#39;s challenge with a fresh motivation, and I&#39;m proud of myself for being relatively on top of sessions. Tonight, after doing the video for neck and shoulder relief, as well as this one, my knee hasn&#39;t felt this great in a long time. I did experience the old muscle twinge from my past knee injury but it only resulted in a bit of discomfort, no pain this time. I&#39;m so happy that I can always rely on you to encourage me to be better, even when I&#39;m stuck in a cycle of telling myself that I suck. I feel so refreshed now and cannot wait to tackle the next video.<br /><br />On an off topic note, what kind of plants do you have?",Emma Fish,2019-12-11T00:08:05Z,0

"Oh, this was SUCH a beautiful practice and it came at the exact right moment for me. I&#39;ve been pretty sick with an acute gastro-enteritis for about a week and a lot of the normal core, bending or twisting poses just felt really painful in my poor belly, so I had to surrender to that and only do very short stretching practices with at the most some leg work. But now I&#39;m getting a bit better again and my body was asking me for something a bit more in-depth. And then this popped up: gentle, loving, and healing! Everything I need at the moment! Thank you so much, Adriene, for being there for me once more :-) and the Benji paw moment had me laughing out loud with joy on my mat. Wonderful times.",katelijne sommen,2019-12-10T17:25:46Z,0

"As a 24-7 environment activist, life is sometimes less pleasant. We see the polar caps and glaciers melt, the rain forests are on fire and the oceans are souring. Smog everywhere. The indigenous population expelled or killed. The exploitation of our still beautiful planet has been accelerating in recent years and people still don&#39;t want to see it. Well. People need to wake up, but that should not be at the expense of ourselves. Yet that does happen. As a child I did breathing-relaxation exercises when I was in bed. I could not understand and still cannot understand why people deal with our biodiversity in this way. Two years ago I became exhausted. My patience was and is being tested time and time again and that was okay but I saw and see around me how other activists are collapsing. That would never happen to me and I will never give up. We only have 1 planet, so making every effort to keep it liveable here seems logical. There are simply no other options. But nobody is helped with a struggled activist so I started yoga at home and soon found Yoga With Adriene. Thank you so much. What would yoga mean for the world if it were given as standard in schools daily before the start of further classes?<br />I wonder to what extent other followers are committed. This yoga has helped me enormously.",Ecopowerr,2019-12-10T10:38:28Z,0

I always wonder what you are focusing on when you look towards the camera...  are you speaking to a person in the room or just toward the cameras as if they were an actual person; does someone operate the cameras, or are they stationary and unmanned?  wait, what if knowing such things would take away from the mystery and &#39;tv magic&#39; of such an otherwise, lovely experience of Yoga With Adriene...

"Ahhh, about time I got this type of practice to combat the overwhelming load of stress that has been pounding upon me particularly over the past week due to a struggle with getting my schedule in order after being bed ridden for a couple of days. Thanks, Adriene, for reminding me that there&#39;s still hope to heal no matter how messy things get. Knock knock Mr. Stress, i&#39;m coming to get you off my head and out of my body because your rent is overdue. You&#39;ve got  this everyone. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-12-08T06:09:41Z,38
"Shadan Zahrooni You’re welcome. Yes, stress is definitely something to continue to sweep out daily so it doesn’t sideline you. I teach restorative yoga, and have found that I need to stay consistent with my practice to truly receive its healing. Small, daily commitments add up! 🙏🏻",Caren Baginski,2019-12-13T19:15:42Z,1
"@Caren Baginski I appreciate the encouraging words. Yes, I have tried some of Adriene&#39;s restorative yoga videos and they&#39;ve proven to be practical. I guess i&#39;ll have to learn to catch myself being stressed and kick the stress out or else it will constantly be creeping up on me every once in a while. Yoga in bed is a great idea i need to try though. Thanks alot.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-12-13T15:23:26Z,0
