Interesting you mention about noticing the effects of the practice. Just 5 days in and I already feel way way stronger and more in control on my run. I felt like I could have ran forever today and actually enjoyed the run....rather than counting down the minutes until it&#39;s over cuz i&#39;m so tired or my legs feel so heavy.

Missed a few days of the HOME practice (my body was telling me so these last few days) and came back to Day 5. There was something in this practice that was so needed in my body: the lifting of the body with the breath &amp; the child&#39;s pose -- it was just what my body needed. Thank you Adriene.

"I never comment on these videos but I just wanted to say how much this one spoke to me about working more than I need to. I broke down when she mentioned that it could also be mentally. I’ve been struggling with that lately. With always thinking about my stressful job, my significant other moving out and more recently my struggle with my body image and trying to lose weight. I realized that all this negative thinking is making me work more than I need to! And I initially took on this 30 day challenge to focus all that bad energy into something productive. It’s only Day 5 but I’m very optimistic! This has been more therapeutic than anything else I’ve tried before!",Mae Tacata,2020-12-06T03:15:19Z,0

"Hi Adriene, I just finished today&#39;s practice. I wanted to express my deepest gratitude for your offerings. I have done yoga on and off for about 10 years and for different reasons, in these past few years, I&#39;ve found it challenging to practice. But after experiencing burnout, I have stopped working completely and am now building my days as it feels good and every morning I start with you. I&#39;ve done enough yoga to be able to guide my own independent practices, but I love practicing with you and easing into it again, as I tend to want to overextend myself (in every sense of the word), something I am unlearning. Thank you for this journey, and I&#39;m so grateful that you&#39;re guiding me on this path back into conscious movement and connection to the breath and heart.

I didn&#39;t realise how hard I&#39;ve been on myself lately until you invited me to soften. When I let my breath lift me right near the end I felt so free. Namaste Adriene - you are a blessing.,Kara Dodson,2020-10-30T03:41:19Z,1

This is the first day I struggled with cuz I was trying to force myself into pigeon pose before the session and I strained my right leg real hard. Which is kinda exciting. Knowing that it&#39;s not gonna always be me nailing it and it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m thanking my body for keeping up with me and my anxiety and I&#39;m softening on and off my yoga mat.💜,farida tamer,2020-10-29T18:48:00Z,2

"Where do I even begin? how awesome is it that so many here started &quot;HOME&quot; during lockdown when in fact it was filmed before Covid-19 went rampant?<br />I started a few months ago, decided to begin at the beginning (30 day yoga camp from 2015), and have followed all the 30 day sequels since, without skipping a day. Yes, Adriene is magic and this is just too good to miss. I thank you all for this. This beautiful community, the footnotes, the sharing.<br />So today I share. <br />Went through a colonoscopy yesterday, and doing the preparation and cleansing, stuff came up. I took the opportunity the clear up the emotional baggage I had been carrying (like many of us, I grew up in with a lot of abuse. used to carry the stress in my belly). So today as my belly kept rumbling and everything felt like it was moving around rearranging itself, I knew I wanted to go down deep and break that &#39;spell&#39; (Brain Ridgeway, another great recommendation from one of the talkbacks here) . It was time to stop feeling unloved, unworthy. and Adriene&#39;s words reached out to me like so many loving hands - &quot;practice softening in hard times... activate your breath - and let it do the work for you&quot; and so I did. with sukha. I let the breathe carry me. Here is was I received, and I share it with all of you: <br /><br />You were always loved.<br />It is safe to be loved.<br />You never deserved that sh*t.<br />They never did it to hurt you<br />You are already forgiven<br /><br />I took it in.<br />I sent it out.<br /><br />And when I came out of it, blessed and filled with gratitude, I realized something else. The word Deserve was always there, always carried great weight, ominously. that I was underserving of love. I flipped it a couple of times and understood part of it was sadness, and another part of it was anger because I sure didn&#39;t deserve the way I had been treated either. And then finally something else dawned on me. Its not about deserving at all. I don&#39;t need to earn being loved. It is not a reward for good service. <br /><br />May we all love ourselves and other, with kindness and an open heart.<br />Namaste",אורי ליפ,2020-10-15T13:56:19Z,3

"I can&#39;t be the only one that still struggles with downward dog. In every other pose, the most struggle I have is slight trembling but something about the way my weight is shifted back in downward dog hurts my hands so much. Not only that, but they also always slowly slide forward no matter how hard I push into my mat. I haven&#39;t done yoga in years and I was hoping it would get better by day five but it still hurts as much as day one. I&#39;ll feel better if I&#39;m not alone in this, because the poses that Adriene thinks will be hard for us in the video are nothing compared to down dog for me and I feel silly struggling with such a basic pose.",Maija Shea,2020-10-08T14:03:44Z,0
"I can see posture as a result of breath and another posture with improper breath or no breath at all, and then can lead to outburst or irrational thought.

"This may sound sappy, but here it goes. This is my lil&#39; Canadian yoga story.<br /><br />I started doing yoga with Adriene in early August, so this is my second 30 Days challenge with her. I started because my 27th birthday was at the end of July and upon seeing a picture of myself, on my birthday, sitting in a lake and enjoying myself, I burst out crying. COVID-19 has been hard on all, myself included, and seemingly every summer I do get body image issues more so than the rest of the year and this summer was particular bad due to the added stresses of Miss Rona.<br />So in retaliation, I bought myself new walking/running shoes, a yoga mat, and yoga block.<br />Now this marks my 35th, or so, day of yoga and I&#39;m also walking a few kilometres everyday.<br />I&#39;m not overweight, (27F, 5&#39;9&quot;) a bit chubbier than what I would like and I know that I want to tone my muscles more. My weight, per se, has not changed, though my goal to start would be to lose 15 lbs. I know that it&#39;s not good to focus on the numbers, for as I lose fat and gain muscle, the numbers won&#39;t necessarily go down.<br />All in all... I&#39;ve noticed how much my flexibility has improved, for instance: now I&#39;m able to do positions that before made my arms shake. These days, I WANT to do yoga, I WANT to go for my walk. Routine and habit achieved!<br />Today, as Adriene was near the end of this video and was saying to inhale and &quot;lift&quot; yourself, whatever that might mean, I admit that I started to cry. NOT sad tears, but HAPPY tears!<br />I feel great! Sure I&#39;m not at my ideal weight and sure, my thighs are bigger than what I&#39;d like, my belly has a bit more pudge than what I prefer, but I feel great! I have an incredibly, loving, and supportive boyfriend, we&#39;re moving to Niagara Falls next month, I&#39;m a Masters student at Western University, and okay, the world might be on fire, but I feel fine!<br />I can&#39;t wait util I&#39;m able to say, &quot;Oh I&#39;ve been doing yoga nearly every day for [3 months]/[6 months]/[A YEAR!!]&quot;<br /><br />Thank you for coming to my TedTalk.",Bethany P,2020-09-16T16:03:45Z,2

"Feeling very sick today, not sure if im on the verge of a migraine but I feel such a great pressure at the front of my head. I didn&#39;t want to let myself (or you) down by skipping a day. I tried to keep up but around the 18 minute mark started to feel very faint so i sat out a lot of warrior pose feeling guilty and joined back in with the childs pose.<br />What you said at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVeNMX8WDeQ&amp;t=21m30s"">21:30</a> made me feel so proud of myself, how do you always know exactly what I need to hear? <br />I&#39;m proud I showed up with intent to look after myself physically and mentally, thank you adriene, excited to try again tomorrow  xx",Jo Jongin,2020-09-10T14:11:27Z,0

"The sense of &quot;enough&quot; is such a valuable commodity. I have been brainwashing myself that only long and draining yoga practices count as &quot;proper&quot;, and even as I am trying to recover from shoulder pain caused by intense lockdown workout schedule aggravating my scoliosis, I still struggle to dial back because I tell myself that a short yoga practice is cheating. I dialed back today, the acceptance of for today, less is more / less is helpful / less is enough gave me peace of mind, and instead of torturing my body, I got the meditation and condition I needed for my brain. Long and steady wins the race &lt;3 Thank you, Adriene.",veiyi liang,2020-07-20T20:45:45Z,1

I can downward dog with feet flat on floor and I can froward fold to the palms on floor.  But I cannot sit cross legged and bend forward Anywhere....My fingers walk forward about 3 inches tops and I can barely fold forward at a;;.  I do have arthritis in my knees, so there is pan there, but it is the Hips that are fixed.  Sitting cross legged has never been a natural thing for me, but now as I am older, it is very uncomfortable.  I really enjoy yoga, and always have, but this never seems to get easier.

By doing this, I actually did what was expected.",Quentin Chaboche,2020-05-12T08:51:07Z,0

Soften? This was deliciously challenging. Loved every minute of it. I the beginning I said &quot;yeah right elbows on the floor in front of me.&quot; To my  surprise I was able to sit legs crossed and elbows on the floor in front of me!

"I was feeling so extremely low today and I didn&#39;t feel like I had it in me to even move today, but I knew I would need to honor myself and push myself to do it anyway. I definitely felt pushed as far as I could go, but made it. Child&#39;s pose was the moment when I just couldn&#39;t help getting emotional. There is a lot of my heart that has been needing &#39;softening&#39; and it has not been easy. Thank you so much for this.",Allison McCormick,2020-05-08T00:36:44Z,0

"Today was really touch mentally. I had a big headache and was scared I would disappoint myself by not doing it today and then end up never doing it again. At 11:30pm I pressed play while crying. I also ended while crying. I may not be able to do most of this as good as many others, bur Adrienne reminded me that even tho I’m feeling bad and am struggling I actually showed up for myself. It felt like Adrienne knew today was going to be extra tough and focused more on the ‘lighter’ parts. When no one else is there, Adrienne is❤️",Sebina Timm,2020-05-06T22:02:41Z,0

Found this practice super challenging today! Bringing up a lot of panic / awareness of where I&#39;m twisting and working hard that isn&#39;t serving me. Very worthwhile but must take it easy after the emotional labour that came up personally for me. x,Madi O' Carroll,2020-05-06T10:57:34Z,1
"Day 5 changed something in me and throughout the practice I felt like crying out of gratitude.

Much love from Pakistan. Bless you!",Humna F.,2020-05-06T10:29:28Z,2

"I struggle immensely with health anxiety. It consumes my mind all day, everyday. I am constantly so anxious that my shoulders are tensely rounded up to my ears and every breath is from my chest. Sitting up straight and breathing from my stomach requires a sad amount of effort. Doing yoga with Adriene is when I am finally free from my own mind. By the end of the session, I can sit up straight, breath comfortably from my belly and let go of the tension in my body. And for the rest of the night, my anxious thoughts are gently laid to rest. Thank you Adriene for helping me heal my mind and my body🙏",Lily,2020-05-06T04:47:15Z,0

One question I have for everyone, does anyone else look forward to when Adriene says, &quot;Now take the deepest breath you&#39;ve taken all day?&quot; It&#39;s not in every video which I think makes it more special when it happens. Thank you, Adriene for the peace and awareness you have helped me achieve, well most of the time anyway. :)",Nicole Elmasry,2020-04-30T21:25:58Z,0

"I&#39;m enjoying doing a 30-day challenge, but I personally don&#39;t like listening to Adriene herself--she takes me out of a lot of the more peaceful moments I experience with yoga and makes me SO much more aware of the time passing. Plus, she uses a lot of non-specific terminology and moves too fast when she does so, so I end up having to mess up the position I&#39;m in to look at the screen to figure out what she&#39;s doing, which just ends up straining my neck.<br /><br />Anyone have a recommendation for another 30 day challenge that uses more specific terminology, and doesn&#39;t try to be cute and funny?",jessicahoffman123,2020-04-23T19:10:10Z,0

It hasn&#39;t felt like it as the day goes on, but I feel like a spring compressed. I need to get rid of this pent up negative energy.  It became most apparent when I lost balance, and I sat on the ground in frustration, cleaning a scrape on my foot from my less-than-graceful landing.

Day 5 was just what I needed.  I have to say I loved the way you talk about how we have a tendency to work against ourselves.  I have learned so much about myself in the past 2 years of practicing yoga almost daily. I am 63 and yoga has changed my life for the better.  It is such an enlightening experience to really get out of your head and realize how wonderful life can be if you just learn how to breath and walk thru life with a more positive attitude.  For a while I was telling everyone I knew about how life changing it was for me.  I decided most people have to find it for themselves when they are open to it.  I wish the entire world starting with children would practice yoga daily.  I think we would have a much happier existence if all could experience the beauty of the peace and strength you can find within yourself. So much gratitude to you for providing your expertise and guidance to all of us in this trying time.  Namaste!,Ellen Maher,2020-04-19T15:08:28Z,0

"Every time I practice, I am filled with frustration! I think, &quot;this isn&#39;t going fast enough&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t hold that pose for that long&quot; or &quot;WHAT&#39;S NEXT?&quot; It&#39;s amazing to me how much mental resistance I have to practice. Even more so than physical resistance. I write before and after every practice to observe this state of mind. I didn&#39;t know how much I was withholding from myself by saying &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; until I started practicing. I want my body and mind to work together, but I feel that I am mentally fighting myself every step of the way! Anyways, I&#39;m going to stick with the practice to try to chip away at this mental resistance.",Ashley Jacquette,2020-04-17T14:03:10Z,35

"I am really enjoying doing these practices and I look forward to them everyday! But I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m doing a couple of the most used poses correctly as a complete beginner. <br /><br />Firstly, the Forward Fold:<br />What is the main focus of that pose? straightening your legs fully or nicely folding you back? Also, do you need to support yourself on your arms or are they there just to stabilize yourself? <br />Secondly, the Downward Facing Dog:<br />Is it more important to straighten your legs and flatten your feet or do you need to try and straighten your back more? <br />Thirdly, a general question:<br />Is it better to breath with your stomach or your chest or are both fine? <br /><br />Thanks in advance, really loving this so far :D",The Only Artifex,2020-04-16T18:46:40Z,0

"On day 5 and so proud of myself for getting up and doing this every day for 5 days now. I have never been into working out at home but with the COVID situation, I have no choice. I tried some of Adrienne’s other work outs before starting the 30 day program. I have to say that the yoga is starting to feel less like work and more like meditation. That being said, I thought I was softening  and easing into poses that felt too tight. However, my back and legs are really aching today. What did I do wrong?",Ayisha Raja-Qadri,2020-04-14T02:43:49Z,0

I tried sitting with legs extended  but that makes me want to bend forward , not extend up. Lol I also can&#39;t sit in my class because my right knee is injured and that hurts it. I&#39;m a mess.

"Happy Day 5 All, <br /><br />I am drastically late to the party as usual, but have to ask - has anyone else had a minor manly squeal of joy when they see Benji? :) <br /><br />Equally so, I in a weirdly vein way have been avoiding yoga the last few weeks / months. Fear of not having enough time, being too tired, etc. But in real truth. I kinda suck at yoga. I don&#39;t have the best balance, it tires me, and I have to do a lot of alternate moves but with that said.... it is good for me. It helps my mental health and gets me back to the person I know I am :) <br /><br />Love you all, and hope to see any super party over late comes on Day 6. <br /><br />Namaste :)",CoDLover7771,2020-04-07T22:12:35Z,0

This practice was perfect for me today. Right before coming to the mat I noticed how efforts to improve each pose where making me tense and it frustrated me that my heels still don’t touch the floor in downward facing dog. But during this practice I actually softened and came closer. I recognise my journey thus far and how these practises make me feel so much better ❤️ Namaste my fellow Yogis 🙏🏻 May you have a great day and thank you to Adrienne for taking us on this journey ❤️,Tamara Weil,2020-03-27T12:45:58Z,0

I think it is very hard in these days when I have to stay inside most of the day to get clarity on how I feel. The part where you asked &quot;am I working harder than I need to?&quot; made me realize that this week I have been pushing myself too much both for school, exercise, but I&#39;ve also been hard on myself when I feel I have done something &quot;unproductive&quot;. I need to remember that it&#39;s not only okay, but it&#39;s also healthy to set off some time to just do something relaxing or &quot;unproductive&quot;. Thank you so much!",Mattea Z.

"I had an okay day; spent it doing usual pandemic things - walk, homework, lounging around, but then I felt sad. I didn&#39;t want to do this session and most of it felt like a chore. I wasn&#39;t present and I was looking forward to just lying in bed after and doing nothing, but then child&#39;s pose came and I rushed to get into it like a motherf*cker. I took the deepest breaths I&#39;ve taken all day, melted into my mat and somehow visualized myself in an incubator. I was born extremely premature and this pose in that moment connected me to an image. It was amazing and strange and needed. Thank you, Adriene &lt;3",Jess,2020-03-25T04:21:48Z,0

"Dear YWA community, I feel like writing something myself today. This practice was hard for me, I was nervous for a small failure which had just occurred and I hoped to find peace in this practice, but I didn&#39;t. Sometimes softening doesn&#39;t come easy to me and usually when I have tension in my body, I find it hard to breath properly. So, in this practice I faced both of these personal small difficulties and after some minutes I started crying. I didn&#39;t expect that, but I took a break from the practice and went on crying. I needed to cry because I&#39;m going through something difficult: a long distance relationship. I live in Italy while my boyfriend lives in Germany, but since 6 weeks he&#39;s on holiday in his country, South America. He was supposed to come back on the end of March and we had to meet and the beginning of April. The plan was to spend 10 days together finally. But because of the virus all flights from his country to Europe has been canceled and right now I&#39;m feeling really bad in some moments. Suddenly I feel the urge to cry and I do it so desperately that I have pity of my own heart. I know we&#39;re both suffering about this painful situation but we show it in different ways and we don&#39;t talk about it. I guess both of us are scared.<br /><br />I&#39;ve always appreciated reading the comments of some members of this community, sharing they&#39;re personal life experiences, but never really understood why they were doing it. I think I&#39;m now starting to understand one of the reasons why some members do that. I&#39;m sharing this because I hope that telling someone about the small load that my heart is bearing will make it easier to cope with it. And a part of me also hopes some of you could have some suggestions for me 🙏<br /><br />Thanks for reading this, I wish you all a good day and hope you all are feeling good in this caring community, that I personally first started to appreciated in September 💗 Also thanks Adrien for creating it and for all your good words.",Giulia Montanari,2020-03-18T09:32:38Z,64

"Hey Giulia. Maybe by this time you are feeling better, but I will tell you about how I survived for 8 months far away from my (at the time) boyfriend. It was not easy, I felt lonely, we were not on lockdown like nowadays, but it felt like that for me. I was in a foreign country, I had no friends and very little language comprehension. But we talked every day over the internet, we shared everything, just as if we were close. We supported each other and talked about our feelings a lot. We did get to meet for a few days during the 8 months. Maybe this situation will last more than that, maybe less. We don&#39;t know. But if you believe in your relationship, you will do everything you can to keep it alive and thriving. Yoga helps with the anxiety, so I hope you will stick with it until you get to meet again. Hugs.",Andrea Crețu,2020-04-08T06:12:11Z,3

"Balled my eyes out  in today&#39;s childs pose, I know i&#39;m following this journey late but its a much needed one. so far this day of softening has placed the largest mental challenge for me, perhaps also why I was struggling through the poses and losing focus of my breath. The question of where and how do we soften the hard edges, how does breath guide and soften. Still in emotional disarray but, a path of question I had seldom asked myself prior to this",Noah Holder,2020-02-18T15:01:04Z,0

"I was delaying this one 3 days. I was mentally preparing myself. I live with post-chemo sickness and fibromyalgia. Softening, in the basic, physical meaning is what i desire the most. At the end of session I wasn&#39;t feeling &quot;softened&quot;, but I had the hope that I can soften gradually. I wanna remember what being pain-free felt like. I want to enjoy the feeling of a good, loose and stretched limb. I promise myself, I will and can have this. And it is okay if it doesn&#39;t happen instantly. It will happen softly instead.",Zerinda Ella,2020-02-17T18:50:34Z,0
"Not really sure why, but at the very end the first “let your inhale lift you, whatever that means to you” kind of made me tear up a little. This practice was oddly the hardest one yet for me, maybe it’s because I’m not actually doing them every day, more like every other to do on my days off of running.

Adriene thank you so much for your guidance. Is it because I&#39;m chubby that I can&#39;t put my foot between my hands after plank? Usually it takes me like 4 seconds to reposition myself so that I can get one foot between my hands and the other extended behind me. Will this come in time?  It doesn&#39;t seem to be an issue with flexibility. Also the knee to nose and elbow from downward dog is impossible for me. Is this because of my belly or ?,Englishwithjess,2020-02-04T11:11:52Z,0

"I have loved this practise. It helps me to feel more &quot;alignée&quot; (I don t find how to say in english, maybe line up?). I have balanced strenghts and weaknesses with my breath and the will to soften my body and my mental. I felt my core and sometime my jaw was tight. I have exhaled to release the tensions.

"Today&#39;s practice was absolutely wonderful. I realized that I just had to let my body move with the flow and surprisingly I didn&#39;t shake as much. My breathing has also gotten so much better. Like even before Adriene says to breathe in, i&#39;m already doing that and loving it. I know i&#39;m a bit late to the party but i&#39;m really glad that there are so many of us in this community.

"I saw today’s theme , when I finally got home from work ... “soften” .. and thought - oh good !! , she’s going to go a little easier on me today ,yay!!<br /> WRONG! again . All this time I had a disillusioned, preconceived assumption that yoga was something that required very little effort , just stretch and relax, breathe ... wrong again , I didn’t see those planks coming .<br />   I FEEL AMAZING !! I’m getting it now , and looking forward to starting tommorow’s theme , the take-aways are gifts .... and I’ll try stop looking forward to the music gently starting up at lesson’s end <br /> Thank you so much !🙏🏼<br /> You have no idea how much I mean that.",Gerald MacInnis,2020-01-24T04:01:18Z,16
I found this harder today than any other so far. I&#39;m frustrated to the point of tears with myself that I still don&#39;t seem capable of quickly and comfortably moving to positions that we have done plenty of times now and annoyed with myself that I seem so slow. I do these sessions alone and no-one can see me but I&#39;m still embarrassed that I&#39;m not good at this. Aaaand as I type this I realise I&#39;m being harder on myself than I need to be when was the whole point of today was to soften 🙄 point well made 😂,Antonia Collings,2020-01-23T21:20:49Z,0

Thank you, namaste. ❤️",Carrie,2020-01-23T15:17:26Z,0
"I continue thinking: I need a practice to just be and relax. Often, I will find myself in a place of resistance. Yet, once I start the practice of the day, the magic unfolds and I trust everything so fully. I know each day is exactly what I need AND I know that if my body tells me to pause, I will find a position and go there. Again, my past mindset would have been to follow EXACTLY what Adriene says, even when the voice within me is yelling because it knows there is something I need more. I feel so grateful to be in a place now where I can honor and listen to that inner voice without hesitation. When you said &quot;let it lift you - whatever that means&quot; it brought a new awareness of what the breath can do at any moment throughout the day. Thank you &lt;3",Kelsey Yoki,2020-01-23T13:55:57Z,0

"I&#39;ll be honest, I started day 1 about 2 weeks ago. I started college this past week, and things have been a little hectic. I woke up late today, turned on this video, and it is just what I needed. Every move felt so nice against my tense, stiff body that has been holding in emotions and experiences since returning to school. Anyways---it&#39;s okay to take breaks, even from 30-day challenges. Because sometimes, the break is exactly what you and your body needs, and you can return to the video that was made for you on that day you returned.<br />I hope that made sense. Basically, this video is just what I needed to release tension. Thank you, Adriene :)",Brittney Kristina,2020-01-18T18:12:21Z,0

And today during yoga, I was able to lift my back knee off the mat for the lunge, and I only nearly toppled over once on each side. I&#39;ve also noticed that I&#39;ve been taking deep breaths and long exhales at random throughout the day, rofl, and my breathing is better during my other exercises.

Hi I put on some weight and noticed my habits were not reflective of where I wanna be so I decided to pick up yoga again. But I find it so much more challenging with the extra weight 😩😩 especially the lunges and warrior poses. This practice helped a lot by reminding me to allow the breath to do some of the work.

"I really enjoyed and appreciated the questioned you asked, &quot;where in your body, or mind, are you putting in a little more effort than necessary?&quot; it opened up so many realizations for me. Like, for example I am such an introvert and can have social anxiety from time to time, asking too much about myself in my mind and my body starts to stiffen, which leads to me avoiding the issue at all costs. But just being conscious about it, can soften things so much already. Thank you for your beautiful wise yoga video, yet again Adriene &lt;3",Chelsey de Nijs,2020-01-13T19:19:04Z,16

I can never thank you enough for teaching me to &quot;find what feels good!&quot; I have crohn&#39;s disease and I was having a pretty painful flare yesterday. I started to do day 4 and realized it wasn&#39;t going to happen. In the past, I would have just got off the matt. This time I stayed and let your video keep playing. I, however, did moves that felt good to me and kept doing them for the length of your video. After an adjustment with a chiropractor that evening and your video today I feel so much better!

"This day was magical and hard in contrast to its title, that&#39;s why it was special probably. It really hit a weak spot on me. Made me really wonder if I was expecting too much from me, if I was trying really hard sometimes when I don&#39;t have any control on some people or situations. And made me doubt if I&#39;m capable of soften that mental rigidity, all that I find hard every single day.<br /> My body struggled too with this particular one, but I could accept that. I realized I couldn&#39;t accept that struggle so easily in my mind. I couldn&#39;t help crying during that final swaying plank. Surprised me because it was a weird moment but I guess I got the message. Thanks so much Adriene. Really looking forward to get home.💙💙💙",ManderleyDreams,2020-01-10T19:05:56Z,0

I think one of the most powerful things that has changed and shaped how I move in yoga is the idea Adriene reminds us of is creating a whole body experience🙏🏽 that has deepened my practice in so many ways",Alana Fraser,2020-01-09T02:35:18Z,0

This practise actually taught me much more about my body than yesterday. Places that needed a little TLC. So I spent some time in the poses sending some breath and love. <br />And hopefully I won’t die tomorrow doing the core workout 🙈😂,Jenna Goldsmith,2020-01-08T21:08:41Z,0

I failed so hard at this one.  I attempted this after working 16 hours.  I might have been too tired and tense to soften.  I did bedtime yoga instead and got my yummy stretches in and remembered tomorrow is another day.  I can always try again,Melissa Arsenault,2020-01-08T19:30:12Z,0
At the end of my practice I thought of a friend of mine who was treated like crap by a friend of ours and I prayed for her to find forgiveness.  Then I recognized in myself the need to let go of fear with how this same person may treat me.  This is a great way to soften.  I didn’t try to find something it just came to me.

"Thank you so much, Adriene. I&#39;m a little behind, but after just 4 days of yoga, I&#39;m already feeling more like myself. Feeling stronger, shedding excess weight, and overall enjoying life more. I&#39;ve missed yoga. I don&#39;t know why I ever stop... it&#39;s so good for me. And I loved ending in this pose as I meditate right after yoga and this was a perfect transition &lt;3 Thanks to you, I started yoga 6 years ago with your first challenge and, I may stop every once in a while, but you know how to motivate me back to it :)",Eva Boyd,2020-01-08T17:22:09Z,0
My journaling today I was questioning a cycle where I am attracted to unavailable individuals. One aspect talked about worthiness. Feeling worthy of affection and connection.

"I have been doing yoga with Adriene every day for a month now! I have suffered lower back problems all my life, especially in the last few years and just accepted that low levels of pain and stiffness were going to be my every day reality, I&#39;ve been to the physio and ostepath many times and it never really helps me long term. When I started in December, I hadn’t done any exercise for 2 years, I couldn’t even sit up straight while cross legged, I needed a tall block to sit on and I was still slouching. Today I was sitting tall and strong, without any blocks! I can do a strong plank now without the shakes, I even surprised myself with getting my feet flat on the ground for the downward dog (and not rounding my back). The back pain has slowly disappeared, today there has been no pain at all. It’s been a real breakthrough day/session today. Weirdly I think the hip opening exercises in many of the videos have really helped with that, I used to be so tight in the hips. Thanks so much Adriene, finding you has literally changed my life for good, being able to practise at home makes it so much easier to commit to regular practise which I’ve always longed for. I feel like I’ve come home to my body. xx",Christine Wehrmeier,2020-01-08T11:46:47Z,0

Do I put in a little more effort than necessary?&quot; – I felt so caught. I do, yes. I&#39;m a good and ambitious student. I&#39;m working hard.

"5/30 <br />WHY WAS THIS SO HARD FOR ME! <br />that was crazy! I had to stop the video and for a moment I felt so weak...my ego started telling me I couldn’t do it. I started reading the comments and some of you have beautiful stories of overcoming illness and it inspired me to keep going; to soften my doubts and to believe in myself. I was getting so frustrated because I just wanted to feeeeel into it but I couldn’t because I felt ‘off’ in my spine. When I do the extended child’s pose, on my exhale I get a sharp pain in between my shoulder blades and that’s usually a relaxing position but lately it’s been a feared one. Hopefully it gets loose soon. Anyways!! Namaste, good softening practice.",Ariana Elaine,2020-01-07T23:25:20Z,0

So I&#39;m going to take a break and do the yoga quickie for hands, fingers and wrists. I was already a day behind because I was really sore after day 3 and decided to take a break that day too. But this is part of my intention for this journey was not pushing myself too hard. I have had an almost daily practice for years so I felt confident I would hold myself accountable. And I&#39;m 8 moths postpartum so I want to be careful of my healing body. I tend to push too hard instead of not hard enough. So I&#39;m going slow, honoring my intention of being gentle.

So..wake up this morning, thank good ness for habit - did my morning ritual rode bike in coma, readings/meditation,  then set up mat on pad outside as sun coming up.   Here&#39;s my point...THANK YOU.  Total peace and release. I so needed this and I assume you didn&#39;t know when you made it.  So important for me.  As I got to about 20 minutes, as the transition into seated pose - the songlist I have playing in the background softly plays Jeff Buckley singing &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.

"Another thought came to me this morning. When I was 18 I had surgery on my left knee which left me with a chunk of bone below my knee, in the centre. I am working with an Athletic Therapist to strengthen and build functional mobilization in that leg but there are certain poses that are awkward because of the bump. For example, Head to Earth pose I struggle to press the top of my left foot into the earth without altering my hips. Considering the bump, what should I be focusing on when you ask us to press through the top of the foot into the earth, on the left side?

I&#39;m amazed, actually, and very excited to find out how I&#39;ll be feeling once I&#39;m halfway my yoga journey.<br /><br /><br />I just wanted to thank you, Adriene, for sharing this positive energy with all of us; you truly are one of those beautiful people who make this world a better place, and I think you&#39;re helping us all becoming better versions of ourselves as well.

"&quot;What can you soften?&quot; I kept asking myself, after your offer. My shoulders popped during this practice. It was an energetic release, as I was raising my arms up in high lunge. Watching myself wanting to push harder, before necessary. Obsessing, instead of being present. Small, and subtle moments. Realizing, I need to soften. Lol..A LOT. This sure helped. Be present. Dont force it. Not everything needs to be hard and serious, or perfect. Soften. Then release. So good. Namaste loves.  See you tomorrow. 😘😘",Spoonzspins42,2020-01-07T08:47:03Z,1

"is something wrong with me because I have to breathe, pant even, very hard when doing this work? I not able to pull my belly button up because my stomach is so big and it feels like I am not able to take long inhales because my stomach is big and preventing me. Is that normal? I am carrying an extra 80lbs that I&#39;ve been working to get off for 7 years, hormones/menopause has messed me up completely. I used to be able to breath in on a 20 count but now I have to breathe faster which seems to make my yoga practice so much harder to do. Will this change? will I lose weight and be able to do the moves like pulling my belly button up and arms into runners stretch on either side of my thighs, or pull my also large butt back into baby pose.. I&#39;m having a rough day with all of this, maybe tomorrow will be better.. I didn&#39;t want to miss doing the class so I made myself do this before I went to bed (very early and very long day) its 11pm where I am.

I’m so excited for more yoga ❤️",Jennifer Gambacorta,2020-01-07T03:59:20Z,0

"I&#39;ve had an extremely long day between work, jetlag, work for my freelance business, and a tough run at the gym. I came to this practice at 8PM exhausted, begrudging the commitment I had made to myself to do the Home practice every day in January, dragging myself onto the mat, thinking of it as one last task to be completed before I could fall into bed. As always, Adriene, you made me so, so glad I came to the mat today. Every time you say, &quot;Let go of the day thus far,&quot; it&#39;s like you give me permission to breathe, to relax, to remind myself to appreciate being alive and in my body. I appreciated my body today, that it does everything I ask it to do even when it&#39;s exhausted. Thanks, body. Thanks, Adriene.

Day 5 done! I found this video so informative about my body and the progress I&#39;ve made even in these 5 days in using my muscles and gaining strength as a result. I went from barely 1 second planks to a 3 second plank today before I had to stop and such progress in less than a week! I can feel my inner thighs activating for warrior and lunges and it&#39;s just so amazing going from being rather obtuse to the going ons in my body to actually feeling the muscles at work and feeling that improvement too!

We had a great time and conversation was natural. We both moved on with our lives and commiserated on both ups and downs and bonded like old and new friends. I told her about doing g yoga to feel better and she told me her plans to swim for health. When I came home I was riding the happiness of the day and did this practice and felt wonderful. It continues to be a good challenge and I feel like I&#39;m achieving so much in my physical wellbeing and personal life. Thanks for being an inspiration.

"I lost my sister 10 years ago and today is her birthday. I&#39;ll be the age she passed away next month. I came to mat with tear-stained cheeks and an unwillingness to move from that dark place. Both my breath and your gentle encouragement stirred up a little joy for me and allowed me to escape my own mind for 26 minutes. I learn something new about life and myself every day that I practice with you. You truly have changed my life for the better. Thank you thank you thank you, Adriene.",Hailey Goodale,2020-01-07T00:46:52Z,0
"Day 5. Soften.  This practice really helped me focus on the quality of my movement..easing into each move rather than making it work.  This is not work, this is a practice.  Ywa has helped me in my cardio/strength workouts as I coordinate that ease of movement and awareness of how my body is working with me.  Big breathe in and a long breathe out.  Feeling great.",SJ&DDsMOM,2020-01-07T00:42:19Z,0
This practice was so beautiful thank you adriene. I&#39;m in the midst of what I&#39;m assuming is a nerve injury in my right leg (dropped a log on my knee a few weeks back) and have been really struggling with this idea of softening. Although this practice was very difficult (and sometimes a little frustrating) with my injury I appreciated the very fact that I was still doing it and brought along a pillow for support.,The Process,2020-01-07T00:38:42Z,0

I have enjoyed the first five days and have been encouraged by my growth and comfort with poses in such a short period of time. 2020 is the start of a new decade and a new and slightly more flexible me. We have enjoyed spending this time practicing yoga together.

I couldn&#39;t finish this one. How do you deal with not finishing? Do you complete it a different day? Do I accept that I only made it 12 minutes in before I was in tears because I was lacking sleep? Do you keep going while you cry and just start breathing through your mouth?

"Hey I think the most important thing is to be kind to yourself - and don’t give yourself a hard time. This is meant to be something that helps you so if you did 12 minutes - that’s great! Especially if you were exhausted. You can try again later or tomorrow, or just move on to the next video. It’s all ok. There are no rules - just listen to what your body needs.

"Today&#39;s practice was shitty which made me feel shitty. I&#39;m holding back on my... back and neck. It&#39;s funny-crazy how some moves are done so differently depending of the theme of the practice. How your feelings can shift so fast. Or maybe that&#39;s just me. Maybe I un/subconciously put a lot of meaning in my practice, in the theme of the practice. So, yes, maybe I made it worse by not being able to soften myself, which I wanted to. I need to soften myself, soften my negative thoughts, soften my body instead of making it harder for me. I will do my best to integrate that vocabulary in my everyday life!!! <br /><br />Just as I was telling myself &quot;that&#39;s okay, calm down, soften yourself, don&#39;t be too hard on yourself&quot;, you said &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter what happened on the mat, what you achieve&quot; &lt;3 Definitely made me feel better.",Sarah S.,2020-01-06T21:49:57Z,0

So I managed to get a sore knee AND a stiff neck from practice yesterday. Clearly today’s ‘soften’ was exactly what I needed. We really don’t notice when we’re overdoing it or tensing unnecessarily.

"It&#39;s interesting how our mind works. In the beginning of the practice during a nice comfortable seat, I felt that I wanted to feel supported - for my to be able to lean on something, feel ground under my feet, got the picture in my head of me sitting with my back against the wall, my knees bent and feet on the ground (I never sit this way normally). My brain told me - no, you can&#39;t sit like that, that&#39;s nor even yoga. I hesitated for few moments, but then replied, of course it is, it&#39;s totally yoga, just to find myself transitioning into a different posture to find what feels good.

"during this practise i thought a lot about how things matter less than i think they do. one of my un-official new years resolutions this year is to put less energy into things that i don&#39;t get energy back from. i think this idea of softening these areas can help me a lot, instead of thinking about it like i have to push them away. thank you adriene, for unintentionally teaching me a valuable life lesson.",Freja Rosing-Schow,2020-01-06T18:41:33Z,0

"I&#39;m glad that this is a core part of this journey. My intention that I set for this practice is to be gentle with myself, to be compassionate. It&#39;s a struggle for me, but the reminder and the chance to practice it makes it easier. The thought of &#39;where am I tensing in my mind, where can I be gentle in my thoughts&#39; is very helpful. I often feel like allowing myself to be present in the moment is the most strenuous task in yoga. But when I do achieve it, it is worthwhile. I still have a long way to go, but I&#39;m learning to accept where I am on the path.",Anna Broomfield,2020-01-06T18:34:40Z,0

"Usually I do my YWA sesh at dawn when the house is dark and I&#39;m alone while the sun rises and coffee brews. Needless to say it&#39;s THE BEST! way to start each day. But today I woke up late and was doing yoga in the the middle of the living room while husband was scurrying to get to work, kids waking up and humming songs working on art projects... it was a bit of comedy to try to be still and quiet and not react to the buzz.

"I am so grateful for today&#39;s practice. Last Summer I suffered two concussions and my brain is still in the process of reconstructing itself. This is called post-concussion syndrome. Basically my brain becomes overloaded (neuro fatigue) and I become nauseous and confused. Yesterday I overextended myself and as much as I wanted to complete day 4 my body would not let me. I was hopeful that a good night&#39;s rest would remove most of my symptoms but sadly my brain is not done resting yet from yesterday. However I know that exercises wonderful for the brain and I wanted to complete today&#39;s session anyway.

"Today I was able to soften enough and give space (for 26 minutes) to my sadness &amp; disappointment. I was able, within the private &amp; safe boundaries of &quot;the mat&quot; to just allow myself to feel the things I&#39;d not given myself time to fully acknowledge. In doing so, I could envision the process of my tears gathering together in a beautiful swirl that slowly transmuted into a precious pearl. Love is a beautiful gift to give your self and you sadness. Thank you for creating a space, and being a part of my space, to do that.",Gregga J. Johnn,2020-01-06T15:32:31Z,1

"Wow! For some reason, I feel such a relief after this practice. Instead of doing it in the day, I chose to do it in the evening. And it could not have been better. Along with starting &#39;HOME&#39; I also started walking+mild jogging for like 1 hour each day. And then Adriene makes us ask ourselves if we are doing more than we should be. Thank you, Adriene for checking in, for reminding us to take care of our bodies and to soften. I am grateful for that. :) Namaste.<br /><br /><br />P.S. Adriene, can you please tell us where you get your music? Pretty please!! :D I have loved all of your music pieces, be it the 30 days of yoga or Dedicate.

"I absolutely love the practice of softening or encouraging softness. We all hold tension in such small ways that a practice like this really helps to bring awareness to that tension, even if its unconscious. Our bodies remember things and this is meant to protect us but sometimes that protection makes it hard to surrender to stillness. This has been an everyday practice for me, knowing when you let my body protect me and when it the right time to give in to all encompassing peace. Thank you body for moving with me, taking me on this journey. Thank you for protecting me so much. Thank you for showing me where my physically and energetic attention needs to go in order for me to best honor you and my highest self. 🙏🕉 a fantastic mantra I&#39;ve been using was taught by beloved Baba Ram Dass. It goes: The power of god is within me. The grace of god surrounds me. This is the perfect example of that protection followed by allowing softness. Saying the word power with powerful energy, and softening when saying the word grace. Incredible alchemy of the heart. This practice has been fantastic, it has reminded me of my presence and loving awareness I am capable of bringing to the table through out my day, off the matt. There is strength in vulnerability and softness. We need not run from it, as we embrace tenderness we find our way home to ourselves. 🌌💫 Namaste my dear friends!",Connor,2020-01-06T15:23:12Z,0
"Day 5, yess, yesterday with only activation (masculine energy, like you say in your email) was really challenging, but today, with softening AND activation, was the perfect practice! And I am SO excited that we have all made it this far, five days of consistency!!",Tanvi,2020-01-06T15:19:21Z,0
"This practice brought up so many emotions for me. Maybe because we&#39;re all taught not to be soft, not to slow down. Thank you for the freedom that your practices bring. We already have what we need inside, it&#39;s just a matter of realizing it.",Alli As Always,2020-01-06T15:16:52Z,1

Please be sure to listen to your body and not try to push past any pain or discomfort. Modify and take breaks when you need to. Double up your mat or use a folded blanket under your knees for more padding - many people need to do this to eliminate knee pain during lunges.

I don&#39;t know why but today&#39;s practice was harder than yesterday&#39;s. It&#39;s hard to know where to ease beacuse I&#39;m not sure how to do the pose in the right way.<br />And I&#39;m excited to learn more about it as I continue going through this journey 😁,Sports,2020-01-06T13:30:54Z,0

"Today’s practice was totally overwhelming. The past 4 days I only got through because if I could make it to “soften” I could have a stretch and sore muscle release kind of practice. But this was so intense for me I had to adjust every single pose and even just tap out in child’s pose multiple times. I broke down crying at one point. I’m feeling super discouraged and not sure I can go on if the schedule is going to keep using the asanas where all my muscles are so sore (even with making adjustments). I might not be able to follow along with the 30 day schedule, which is disheartening because I’d been able to do it with last year’s dedicate series. This doesn’t feel like home. 😢",Harp Soup,2020-01-06T13:12:36Z,1

"It&#39;s ok to have off days in your yoga practice, just like in life. I encourage you to keep going. Taking breaks to rest and modifying as much as you need. Even take a day off if you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed and come back to the practice the next day. You are going to be amazed at how much stronger you are after this 30 days. And there are soothing practices coming up! Promise. xx",Yoga With Adriene,2020-01-06T15:19:20Z,1

I just want to be and I will allow myself to be. To take up space and live my life with joy and curiosity first. No more expectations that came from my past or conditioning I didn’t even fully realize was there. Today you helped me soften enough to see this and to accept a life of being.

I have a lot of stiffness and pain in my hips and lower back and that goes up to the rest of my back, shoulders and neck (probably because of compensation).

I feel I need some motivation for the next days coming, because especially today the pains are rather intense. The yoga helped a bit though, also to try to be soft in my mind.

"Waiittt just a second.... Wait.... What did I just feel?  I have just ended today&#39;s practice, and wow..... I&#39;ve only startes doing yoga last month, last 2 weeks on December.... And I have never felt this light before, and by light, I mean, physically, emotionally and mentally light.  <br /><br />Today was a little hard for me if I am being honest, my period came in for its monthly visit, I have a flu so I can&#39;t really breathe, I am stressed, my wisdom teeth are currently growing so my teeth REALLLYY hurts, and for some reason my colon isn&#39;t really feeling okay, but I still wanted to do today&#39;s practice.<br /><br /> It was pretty hard on my thighs tho had to, if I am being honest straighten for a few seconds or lower my back knee for a bit, I am currently also sweating heavily. But here is the thing, after I finished... I felt so accomplished and happy, like... I did that!  I REALLY DID! And after sitting down while sweating, I had my windows open and this breeze came by.... And oh my god, I felt a small little chill, I felt my body vibrate with energy, my mind just became so light nothing weighing it down, I felt like I was one, and like I was connected to myself, my brain, my surrounding, to you, to every single person doing this right now. Yet, I felt so light... So so so so so so light. Not just light, I felt like I was surrounded by light..... I don&#39;t know how to describe this. It was I myself was a breathe, going with the wind.  <br /><br /> This feeling, it was amazing almost, magical.... This has to be one of my most favorite routines so far. <br /><br />Thank you, Adriene!",Mirna sh,2020-01-06T11:22:41Z,0

I&#39;m not sure if it was because I tuned in at 5:30 am today but my favorite part was the child&#39;s pose at the end and the little talk about expecting too much from ourselves.

I live in Melbourne Australia where the city is blanketed in smoke and my news feed filled with images of destruction and loss.

Struggled with this one today- not the movements but the stillness aspect. Which is something I REALLY want to get better at so that&#39;s no surprise. <br /><br />Two pro tips <br />1) do not drink your coffee RIGHT before this 🤦‍♀️<br />2) try to create a silent environment if you live with other people <br />Lol,Rea Mills,2020-01-06T10:44:15Z,0

"“Minimum effort!” was something the best boss I ever had used to say to us, especially when we had a big task or important project - encouraging us to do our very our best but without overstretching or pushing harder than necessary.

I have sobbed after each  session so far . The emotional release for me is amazing! As soon as I hear the music too! I have moved so many times in the last 9 years and have not felt stable or truly home. I have very few friends and my family are not like me at all so feel very alone most of the time. I am truly lucky to have a very strong connection with my partner and daughter though but have still felt very lonely for so long. The connection I feel to you and the community is so strong and I most definitely feel at home. Thank you so much. Eternally grateful 🙏🏼🌸💕❤️,Debbie Dawson,2020-01-06T10:37:35Z,798

"I&#39;ve always loved January but since being part of the YWA community for the past few years, I love it even more. There is no better way to start the year than taking time for myself and practising yoga with people all around the world. This year&#39;s 30 Days of Yoga strikes a prominent chord with me - I travel full-time as an international house &amp; pet sitter so &quot;home&quot; has been an elusive concept. My daily yoga practice (especially within the YWA community) is where I truly feel at home, no matter where I am in the World. I couldn&#39;t think of a better way to re-explore what the concept of &quot;home&quot; means to me than through my practice - thank you Adriene once again for being an inspiring guiding light 🙏🏻 xx",Deb Southie,2020-01-06T09:39:30Z,0

"I&#39;m not sure why but I find I get a hot and uncomfortable feeling in my left shoulder blade after a few days of practising yoga. I&#39;m wondering if my alignment is off or I&#39;m not listening to my body. Last year I had the same thing and it was painful. I went to a doctor and he said it was a muscle spasm. That happened After I took a yoga class on a cool day (I live in Thailand where it&#39;s hot all the time), and I pushed myself too hard into a position, I knew it as soon as I did it. This pain now always comes back whenever I practice yoga, perhaps I&#39;ve permanently injured myself.",Lisa K,2020-01-06T07:35:11Z,0

"What an excellent practice today was!!! Thank was so beautiful for my mind, body, breath, and soul. How funny it is to believe that working harder and forcing ourselves into continuous pressure will eventuate to more success ?! Crazy<br />&quot;Am I working harder than I need too?&quot;<br /><br />Also, please if you have not considered or are unaware of what is currently occurring in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia with their disastrous scaled bushfires, it is an incredibly stressful situation. More land is currently burning that the country of Belgium and it is only getting worse with our Southern Hemisphere summer has just begun. <br />Half a billion animals are believed to have perished, 28 people are believed to be dead, C02 (Carbon Dioxide) emissions that have been released over the months of burning are believed to take the atmosphere a century to be absorbed and processed. <br />Here, in New Zealand, the smoke has crossed the Tasman, a journey of 2000kms, and we are now also suffering the effects with breathing problems, polluted skies, and drastic weather shifts. <br />We are now beginning to live within an era of climate change.<br />The best way to help those in Australia is to please donate. <br />-The Australian Red Cross<br />-Any Australian wild animal base (particularly NSW or VIC animal hospitals)<br />- to the Kangaroo Island Mayors relief fund<br />Anything, please.

"I hurt my foot today, but will still be getting on the mat. I&#39;ll just be taking things a bit slower for this one.",Holly,2020-01-06T06:02:05Z,25
"@Yoga With Adriene Thank you Adriene! I&#39;m definitely listening to my body and today it was modified for me some, but even if I just showed up to breath and relax, that is my much needed &quot;me&quot; time. You&#39;re the best, thanks so much for this journey home.❤",Holly,2020-01-06T14:03:29Z,1
"Hi Holly! Listen to your body and don&#39;t push. If you need to take some time off to heal, that is ok. The practice will be waiting for you when you are ready. x",Yoga With Adriene,2020-01-06T13:44:44Z,4
