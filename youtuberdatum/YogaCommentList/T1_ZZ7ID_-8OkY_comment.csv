We have five days left on our journey HOME. You are doing great! How do you feel about today&#39;s practice? Were you happy to relax? Do you find it difficult to relax?,Yoga With Adriene,2020-01-26T15:00:46Z,485

"I really loved this practice. Some sweet TLC for the mind and body. I did have some trouble with the body scan.<br />As I have trouble grounding, the bodyscan is sometimes very challenging. It would be very helpful Adriene, if you would guide the scan per body part. I tend to live in my head and every word you say that is not about scannen a specific body part, I find it very hard get out of my head and enjoy the benefits of the bodyscan. <br /><br />Thank you for everything. <br />Namaste.",Iris elisabeth,2020-07-26T06:02:26Z,0

"I was happy to finally relax and pay attention to my movements after a week of more intense practices.  Noticing every sensation made me feel aware and connected to my body.  The second me believes that in a fast paced world, today&#39;s practice was very soothing and relieved all tension from my intense HIIT workout from yesterday.",Radha Tanwar,2020-06-24T15:42:47Z,1

"Adriene, I have been severely disabled for more than seven years, to the point where I could not exercise at all. In the last several months, when I began to recover my health and look around for movement to strengthen my body, I found your channel and started trying shorter practices. My fiancée and I did the BREATH journey earlier this year, and we are now this far into HOME. I wanted to share how amazed I am to find that I can do this; I can practise and grow stronger and more centred. It is profoundly empowering and deeply meaningful. <br /><br />The first time I ever heard you say &#39;put one hand on your belly and one hand on your sweet heart,&#39; I reached over without thinking and put my hand on my partner&#39;s heart. Tonight as we laid on our mats we held hands and softened together in gratitude. This really does feel like coming home to myself. So for all your work, I sincerely thank you. Namaste.",Wynne Whitten-Holmes,2021-05-03T23:25:12Z,0

Also, I&#39;m noticing muscles in my body that definitely weren&#39;t there before... lol<br />As far as the psychological benefits go, Yoga has helped with my anxiety, and the fact that I&#39;m seeing the 30 days through is doing wonders for my self-confidence. Due to mental health issues, I&#39;ve had a hard time finishing what I start (I&#39;m bipolar), but it&#39;s been a lot easier to maintain a routine now that I finally found meds that work and I like what I&#39;m doing.<br />Thank you Adriene for your classes, they make such a difference in our lives &lt;3",Johanna Cowell,2020-08-29T02:55:48Z,0

"There was a lot of heavy energy today, and I noticed that everyone around me was tired, even my dogs! I was  exhausted and incredibly afraid of skipping practice, since it would be my first in this journey. I have been having trouble committing to basically anything and seeing it through for the last two years, so being here for 25 days in a row means the world to me, and I didn&#39;t want to quit. I was already in my pj&#39;s when I decided to give it a shot before going to bed. It was as if everything in my day was meant to happen so I could practice at this hour and in this mood. What a beautiful, relaxing and deep practice, now I am ready to go to sleep, and I am not feeling tired anymore. I am so glad I didn&#39;t skip today&#39;s practice! Can&#39;t wait to wake up early tomorrow for day 26! Just wanted to share.   Thank you so much Adriene!!",mariana campos,2020-06-21T03:32:26Z,0

"Good morning Adriene, Thank You. Please forgive me but can I address the Yoga Nation to see if they have an opening at their workplace for me? I have always enjoyed waking up to go to work but lately I don’t feel happy going to work, being at work. I am doing my job, I like my Customers but I don’t want to be there anymore. I work in imports, freight forwarding for the last 13 years and worked for the same company in 1998-2002 when I had left due to moving far away. My Employer has been good to me but when they speak to you in front of your co workers disrespectfully and they don’t realize this you are uncomfortable and realize that the yoyoing has been enough. At my age and at this stage of my life I want to work the best I can and not be stressed. I thank You for listening. I live in Rockland, Ma and have been looking for another job but it is not easy. Happy Wednesday everyone. 🙏 ☀️Breakfast awaits and then work.",TheGraziella1987,2020-02-26T11:20:21Z,0

It was Adriene&#39;s let it go flow. No idea why I was doing it, I just felt the calling from with in me. That was 3 years ago. I was suffering from depression at that time. Over the years yoga has helped reconnect with the essence of my being. The pure joyful innocence I felt I had lost growing up. I&#39;m deeply grateful to Adriene for her hard work. She made yoga accessible to a person like me, someone who&#39;s insecurity about how her body looks would never allow her to start yoga at a public class and continue it.

"Cozy sessions are my favorite, mainly because I’m not looking at yoga as an exercise or a way to burn calories- I do different workouts for that. This form of yoga compliments my routine.",Elissavet Motoshige,2020-01-31T23:58:03Z,0
"Oddly for a couple days now I haven’t really been enjoying yoga as much. I noticed how much it helped ever time I did it but for some reason I just wasn’t as present as I wanted to be. This practice today brought back that love and excitement for yoga (even though this journey is almost done). I have never done yoga daily so it felt kind of repetitive. But this practice brought back my spark. Also little note, at the end of this video my third eye started vibrating 😃",Still Emo,2020-01-31T20:29:21Z,0

"I often find that these practices are the most challenging for me, having to train my mind even more than my body to stop, slow down, and be still. This has been a practice of changing my exercise mindset from on of fixing and changing and molding my body to be what I want it to be to taking a breath and noticing my thoughts and body and how they connect. Thanks Adrienne for this practice and your kind words and permission to slow down and to be.",Shari Landry,2020-01-28T13:35:23Z,0
"Finally able to do Unwind today. It was perfect. We had family arrive from NY on Friday. A visit we were all so excited for as they have an 11 month old. This was our 3rd time of seeing him. The fun turned quickly South when it became apparent the baby wasn&#39;t only fussy, but had most likely contracted the Norovirus on the plane. By the time we realized it we&#39;d had a party of more than 20 guests who all but 6 or 7 became ill in varying degrees. My husband and 2 of my adult children violently. Boooo! So, coming back to Unwind today was perfect. The invite to hear and recognize our thoughts then let them go. I am so human and was actually harboring bad thoughts bordering on anger from the visit. Even though I knew it was not their fault. Unwind. The breathing. The relaxation allowed me to move beyond. At least being end of semester I had no school yesterday and could take the day to rest. Thank you Adriene and Kula for helping me through. I will double up practices before and after work today and tomorrow and finish strong. Namaste`",kristi shore,2020-01-28T13:31:45Z,0

"I waited to do today&#39;s practice until I&#39;m getting ready for bed. I felt very present although I noticed I was trying to plan things out in my head a few times. Either way I feel so relaxed and fulfilled today! Last night I have a very intense, vivid dream that presented me with an important spiritual lesson. I woke up in the middle of the night and wrote it all out, went back and read it today and I feel like the self doubting habit I&#39;ve carried for so long died with that experience. I feel more sure of myself and my abilities. I feel I have unlocked some new potential within me, new strength I didnt know I had. It&#39;s hard to explain really but I just feel so good in my body but also like ik starting to understand what it all means. I was fully in the place of the witness for the first time and for an extended period. It felt as if I unlocked a new view of my own reality. I am do blessed and grateful for everything, this journey, tonight&#39;s practice, for divine love and for trust. Has anyone else had experience like this? If so I&#39;d love to connect!

She has lived a long and happy life but that doesn’t make it any easier for me to know that she will soon leave us.

"Dear Adriene, Even after a 90 minute Iyengar class, I knew I had to come Home, literally and spiritually, to do this practice with you!  I can&#39;t believe there are only 5 days left. This is my first year completing this practice (I knew I would from day 0), even though I&#39;ve been practicing with you for at least 6 years now. The past few years have been extremely rough and I&#39;ve been working on my mental health to not only make it stronger, but to find the love that I have for myself and to offer to others. Every time I&#39;ve stepped foot on the mat, with your guidance, I&#39;ve felt the strength of my body, the resilience of my mind, and the balance and cohesion between the two. I can&#39;t express how much this has served me. For the first time in a very long time I actually feel like I have solid ground beneath me, and I&#39;m grateful that the mat also has my back. My love for Yoga has deepened, all because I&#39;m starting to love myself again. I just wanted to thank you for helping me along my journey.<br />Love and Peace to you.",Aisha Shaikh,2020-01-26T23:44:19Z,2

Late night double yoga for me. Combined day 24 and 25. Was nice doing a sweet explosion session then letting it all go straight afterwards. I found that arm twist swing in 24 really interesting. I closed my eyes and felt as if my tummy was being ringed out. Then in chavasina just now the more I went inwards the more my light spread through and did a inner body check. Also I felt really peaceful. I like that pose as it helps me to really check inwards. Sometimes I fall asleep in that haha guilty of falling asleep on my yoga map haha. Thanks Adriene and Benji. Hope that other yogi&#39;s are nice and zen right now! Xx,Nicole O Scott,2020-01-26T23:16:33Z,0

"I&#39;ve had a very though weekend, full of things I had to do, people I had to meet,... So I wasn&#39;t able to do yesterdays session and thought about doing it now that it&#39;s sunday evening and I&#39;m finally home again. But at first I was like okay I&#39;m just gonna do yesterdays session and just be one day &quot;behind&quot; and that&#39;s okay. But as I saw todays theme it was clear that I would just do both even tough I just wanted to go to bed so badly. After these two very full days I literally felt the whole stress clinging to my body. So I just did as if yesterdays and todays videos were one session. And it was the best I could have done. Yesterday&#39;s gave me a bit of energy back and today&#39;s was just perfect for how I felt. Throughout the whole session I felt the stress falling of my body. It was so amazing. <br /><br />Adriene, I am SO thankful for you. These Yoga-Sessions are my highlight of the day. You motivate me to look after me, listen to myself and my body and to take care. So I did today. I&#39;m so thankful that I&#39;m even writing this comment even if I&#39;m not an comment-person at all and even tough before these practices I just wanted to go to bed. Thank you, Adriene. For everything. You make this world a better place.<br />Lots of love from Germany!!!",Marianne B,2020-01-26T21:07:43Z,9

"Really felt the need to unwind today,I can&#39;t believe that I actually have tears in my eyes, I haven&#39;t cried since the very last time I had a very heated argument with my mother.... But, I really was piling up the stress throughout tbese last few months,and I hadn&#39;t noticed any of it up till now.<br /><br /> I am so tired, stressed, and I feel like I am not fully committed to my studies as I should be, but I am rather taking more care of myself and my physical body, so I have started Keto and I am daily doing yoga, while I don&#39;t guilt myself for that..... I don&#39;t even know what I am guilting myself for. But I am just so distracted, and I feel like I am working in all directions and aspects of life, and I am not really going nowhere.<br /><br /> Although in the last week and 2 days I have lost 3 kilos by doing Yoga and Keto, I should feel accomplished, I should feel happy.... But instead, I am so scared? I am so scared of all the what ifs. And the fact that no one is helping me and I am always busy, just leaves me 3/4th of the time starving myself, because I don&#39;t have time to do something healthy for myself to eat. It&#39;s wrong, I admit. But, again I don&#39;t have time, and it kind of stresses me out, because this isn&#39;t how I wanted my experience to be.<br /><br />And then there&#39;s school and all the courses that I am doing, 2 courses and 7 subjects at school, and I feel like I am just not the same me, the same nerdy, hard-working, curious, good old me...instead it&#39;s like I am shell of my old self and boy do I feel so bad. It&#39;s because there&#39;s just so much of everything, that I actually can&#39;t catch up on everything, that I can&#39;t excelle in all 9 topics and it&#39;s so unnerving because they&#39;re all so important, and again I don&#39;t have much time for myself anymore to read, to draw, to write.... To put it simply. I don&#39;t have time to live.<br /><br />I have reached a point in which, I don&#39;t talk about anything except school and everytime I open my mouth I just start vomiting a load of information, I have forgotten what it means like to have fun, and I just want to cry, because this is so much.<br /><br /> Then there&#39;s the fact that my phone doesn&#39;t open anymore, like it just went &#39; sorry baby, can&#39; t take your life anymore, do it by yourself &#39;. And my father isn&#39;t planning to buy me a new one, and I used to heavily count on my phone, on doing yoga, searching for my research topics, doing my projects, taking some extra programming courses, because the curriculum isn&#39;t enough.... And actually having a breathe every now and then but now that it&#39;s gone too. I don&#39;t know how to feel.<br /><br />So this routine, was absolutely needed, I would have cried if my siblings weren&#39;t everywhere around me making noise, and I had every 2 seconds to shout at them to shut up, yet it still did its magic and I am already feeling so much better. Thank you.",Mama Nono,2020-01-26T19:24:44Z,0
"Mama Nono, wow, this is a rough time in your life. You have the best intentions in taking care of yourself, but you seem to spread yourself thin with your studies. I understand that it may be the best choice for you and your future, but it&#39;s taking its toll on you and the way you experience life. I&#39;m sorry you experience that. I hope you can find each day a little something to nourish and relax you (breath, yoga, a moment of stillness, good food, a positive interaction with a nice person...). You do your best, you try very hard to do it all. It&#39;s ok that&#39;s it&#39;s hard sometimes, it&#39;s ok to &quot;fail&quot;, it&#39;s also ok to change what weighs on you.

"<b>HOME - day 25/30:</b><br />This did NOT feel like 18 minutes. I deep-cleaned some of my room today and got completely new and fresh bed sheets and clothing for the first time in a looong time which I can’t wait to sleep in. My room’s been a mess for several years, and as an introvert, I spend most of my time in it and can definitely feel the effect a messy space has on the mind. When I was in the deepest of my depression, I almost didn’t leave my room. It feels good to finally be in a place where I have the energy to start creating a space for myself that feels like “home”. Just wanted to share.😌 Thanks for another lovely practise.💕",Lea Jacobsen,2020-01-26T18:43:25Z,433

Days 20-25 have been done while on vacation in Los Cabos. It has been an amazing experience here watching the whales out in the ocean while practicing my yoga. Most times when you tell us to close our eyes I have kept them open to watch the water spout up and the tails splash the water.

"This was my favorite practice of the journey so far! I felt that I was less distracted and could really focus on my breath and sensations in my body. Home has absolutely changed my life. It has been a very emotionally turbulent year for me, filled with grief and anxiety. Yoga helps heal these feelings and helps me to feel grateful for the people in my life that I love. This journey has transformed my mindset from upset and negative to feeling positive and grateful for this precious life. Thank you, Adriene. You are a gift to this world. I am going to continue practicing yoga daily into February and beyond! Namaste to everyone. ❤",elena conklin,2020-01-26T18:27:54Z,1
Done with Day 25!  I&#39;m sad there are only five days left on our journey home.  I was happy to relax today.  I got emotional in Savasana knowing that I&#39;m on the right track.  This is where I&#39;m supposed to be at this moment.,Lori Lippert,2020-01-26T18:18:06Z,0

"Today, I looked back and saw that on day 1, over one million people watched the very first video of home.  Today, on day 25, just over 16,000 people are still here.  If you are one of them, I have enjoyed every time Adriene has said, &quot;Think of all the people practicing with us all over the world.&quot;  I don&#39;t say this because I feel &quot;better&quot; than anyone else.  After all, I have joined the January practice for the last three years, and this is the very first time I have been able to stay with the calendar.  <br />What I am trying to say...except I seem to be having some trouble spitting it out already...is that we each really do need to &quot;find what feels good&quot;.  I think comparing yourself to anyone in this journey can knock you off track more than any other thing.  Missing one day can shake confidence.  Our own minds can be our worst enemies, and we often cannot turn of that negative voice.<br />Anyway, I appreciate you and am sending well wishes to everyone who is still on track and to those who may have another journey that is more important right now.",Robin Asher,2020-01-26T14:00:53Z,23

"Dear Adriene, Thank you very much for these yoga sessions. (I&#39;ve been meaning to say that for a long time.) You are a great teacher, motivator and instigator of positivity. I&#39;m 75, with a slightly dodgy back, so can&#39;t do some of the moves and postures, but I know what not to attempt, and I find that what I can do is of great benefit. I did the &#39;Dedicate&#39; series last year, although it took me up to April to complete it!

"Nice sentiment, but not necessary. Psychiatrists and psychologists are but another facet in the diamond of healthy self care.  It might help to look at them not as Shrinks, but as Feelings Doctors.

It slowly became so conspicuous in this 30-day journey. I also started to notice it in my sleep. I definitely need to take care of this and buy a mouthguard.
