"This practice fell between my work appraisal and my &quot;motherhood&quot; appraisal (for mother&#39;s day) . . . both leave me feeling vulnerable. There were many tears and emotions during this practice. I enjoyed the ending hug, as I realize that I am indeed proud of who I am both at work and in my family. I do not need the praise of men . . . I have my own integrity and the love of God. The rest is a bonus! Thank you Adriene!",Cheryl Carlson,2021-05-09T02:33:33Z,0

"Here for TRUST - May 2021 and Adriene... the last three days of practice were SO much needed... Idk how you do it/always seem to know which practices to place on which day, but the combination of Yoga for Beginner&#39;s Mind, then Find Your Center, and now Yoga for Vulnerability... I felt like I haven&#39;t been myself for the past few weeks and the past three days&#39; practices brought me right back down to earth. Thank you so much always.

"I feel this to be one of my favorite practices with Adriene. It is definitely not one of the 30 plus minute sequences to shy away from. One pose in psrticular I like is Baddha Konasana, which starts around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5CEOjPY_uw&amp;t=19m00s"">19:00</a>. That pose always brings up emotion for me, especially as we move forward into it. I find it to be the highlight of this vulnerability practice. One can feel their way, and allow. I also find it wonderful for being present. <br /><br />Mid-afternoon here. On my way soon to buy coffee at one of the large stores here. Been doing most of my shopping local and online, but coffee is one I buy farther away. Seems to be a nice day outside so I will walk the 50-60 minutes. Maybe even do so on the way back, provided it is not one of those shopping trips that expands from one or two items to many, 😝.<br /><br />Trust day 8. 216 days in a row.",William B,2021-05-08T06:36:42Z,8

"Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us....so warming and affirming - and also for sharing your day.  Sounds like a wonderful idea and &quot;practice&quot; to take the time to enjoy a long walk to do your shopping (definitely worth it for good coffee!).  I loved this practice - my first time doing it since I started with Adriene a year ago, and with Home for the first month.  I was filled with gratitude for her and for you all throughout.

"The nightmare I had last night hit too close to home and left me feeling vulnerable. This practice found me when I needed it the most. Thank you, Adriene, for providing so many useful tools for us to recognise what we need and be empowered to fulfil that. I have benefitted so much from a 35-minute practice. Loving and tending to yourself is such a simple gesture but so powerful. I pray that all my fellow living beings can do the same for themselves! Lots of love, Mei",Meiyue Liu,2021-05-08T05:51:51Z,3

I just finished this practice... and I had to say this... that hug yourself part near the end... I did it kind of half heartedly at first but then something shifted and I hugged myself with real love and compassion like how I hug others when needed and I tell you it felt SO good to be so loving with myself. Thank you Adriene. I love practicing with you (and Benji). Much love from Australia &lt;3,Reeni Rubio-Martinez,2021-05-07T22:40:43Z,6

And doing it one leg at the time, I cried on the first leg, stopped, and then cried on the second leg too. It just feels so loving, like a hug. I&#39;m trying to see it as funny. This was a really helpful and loving practice, thank you. 🙏❤️",Tialiq,2021-01-17T14:01:33Z,0

"I have been practicing daily for a few years. This year I have done consecutive 30 day challenges. But right now I&#39;m struggling to get on the mat a lot, because I have been struggling in general. I find myself drawn to more soothing videos like this. This is a good opportunity to let go of expectations and ideas I have about myself. Perhaps I&#39;ll not be able to use the tools of yoga to maintain my muscles for when the climbing gyms open again after the lockdown. That&#39;s okay. Even if I only do one of those 7 minute videos a day, as long as I&#39;m listening to what I need most right now, it&#39;s a valuable practice.",Lian Beijers,2020-12-23T08:07:38Z,0

"Thank you so much Adriene. Even if you never see my comment, I still have to thank you for sharing this practice with us. I used to practice yoga nearly daily pre-pandemic, but I fell into a depressive episode during lockdown, and I haven’t been able to shake that state since. I still can’t practice yoga in a studio, so I came to this video tonight to practice. I was feeling fatigued and discouraged, but the self-hug pose largely changed my perspective. I’ve had a very emotional session tonight, but I’m so very glad I still stayed on the mat. Thank you for being a safe space in all the continued chaos",K S,2020-12-17T05:56:55Z,0

Really helped me to take care of myself and show some love. The extra hug at the end was so unusual and unexpected feeling:) It was really good, I will include it in my routine.

"This was therapy in the disguise of yoga &lt;3 Adriene thank you so much for being your kind, considerate and loving self. When you said &quot;lift the corners of your mouth only if it feels appropriate&quot;, what is this level of consideration? I&#39;m in awe.<br /><br />I love it when the practice aligns with my mood, I&#39;m following the November calendar and woke up a bit down so was considering skipping my morning yoga, doing all sorts of rationalizing as one does, then I checked the calendar and saw today&#39;s practice was yoga for vulnerability, it felt like a call to practice like somehow you were saying &quot;it&#39;s okay if you&#39;re feeling down let&#39;s do this anyway&quot;. <br />And then in the practice when you said &quot;if it feels hard to even hold yourself up today know that you&#39;re not alone&quot; I could not stop my tears. <br />Sending love and support to anyone else struggling to even hold themselves up today, you are not alone and we&#39;ve got this even if it doesn&#39;t feel so at times.",Saziye Tasdemir,2020-11-18T10:08:53Z,8

Hi Adrienne. Thank you for all of your Yoga love. My nervous system was destroyed and I didn&#39;t want to exist any more. Your Yoga videos and platform saved my life. I have been restoring my nervous system through PTSD vids and your medicine movement and I&#39;m finding self love and connection for mind and body. Your words have also replaced my negative internal dialogue. Yoga has changed my life and I am learning gratitude and reprogramming all the bad thoughts I have taken on board about myself from other people through out my life. I am building my relationship and trying to free from self sabotage. I am so grateful for you making these delicious vides accessible. My Yoga journey will be the biggest part of me for the rest of my life. A sincere thank you.,Wildflowers & Puppies,2020-10-12T05:01:09Z,0
"This was the first yoga when I was constantly crying. I am doing these YWA calendars at my own tempo, so now is October and I am doing only the April calendar and I dont care 😀 But this was very touching for me. I am at the beginning of second lockdown in Slovakia and I had found that I am pregnant. With my third child. Unexpectadly. First lockdown was the thoughest time for me, caring of two small children and sick husband, making everything... And now? Here we go again even more harder. So when I got to the fetus position I was completely broken, tears were falling down my face... And didnt realise anything special, but I am more calm, more self-confident? I dont know but I have hope that I will get through this. Yoga heals. Thanks Adriene ❤️",Anna Čelko,2020-10-11T19:24:15Z,1

"I&#39;m somewhere around 85 days of yoga (every single session was with Adriene). I really feel like these have been life saving sessions, especially while dealing with being a single mother, going through the pressure of college, while trying to also do online schooling for my kids. To top it off I have generalized anxiety Disorder and panic attacks. But I swear everything has felt better since doing these sessions. Less panic attacks. Less headaches and body stiffness. More smiles. Thanks again Adriene for being an awesome person to spend time with each day! :)",Shiloh Silveira,2020-09-28T05:11:19Z,3

"I am social distancing solo as well. And broke up with my ex-bf right before pandemic. He started seeing someone already and that girl posted on facebook like &quot; hotter than your ex and better than your next&quot; and my ex-bf replied &quot;for sure&quot;.... I feel hurt and I cried. I know I have a lot more to offer and I should not care much about what they say or how they think of me. I am trying to cut off the minds that I hate them so much and I am trying to wish them happy. I feel vulnerable but I am looking for ways to feel better. Thanks Adriene for this video. I will keep in mind that whenever I feel down, I should try to find ways to get better instead of whining and crying . She is hotter becuz she wear a lot short skirt and revealing clothes and posted it on ins with heavy makeup. yes she is hot. but I am not ugly as well. and I will work on myself to pefect every aspect myself. I will prove to them.",yi zh,2020-08-27T22:59:55Z,0

Your personality shines through so naturally. I have so much admiration and gratitude to everyone who has engaged with this video. I could read these comments all day. This is a truly gorgeous, resting and helpful practice in these awful times just now. Much love 💕",Holly Forgan,2020-08-27T18:56:57Z,0
"Adriene, it has been 6 months since I&#39;ve gotten a hug from one of my adult sons because of covid. I am really feeling hug deprived at this point in general. When you had us hug ourselves at the end, it was a powerful moment for me. I am never alone! I am here for myself, like I would be for others. Thank you for gently leading us to this truth today!

"This was such a beautiful, soothing practice  -- it gave me great comfort, and I&#39;m very grateful. I received heartbreaking news today, all alone in quarantine and in the middle of a work blitz. The news stirred up a bunch of other painful issues, and I had a good ugly bawl between conference calls. I muddled through the afternoon and evening in a total haze, but I landed here, on my mat and with all of you. And I won&#39;t say all is right with the world, but I do feel renewed peace and a definite grounding that will make it so much easier to move ahead and face what&#39;s coming with greater strength and serenity. Thank you from the bottom of my heavy but hopeful heart! Namaste 🙏🏻💙",AdeAiye,2020-07-21T03:45:19Z,0

After finding out that my Thursday morning yoga was canceled this morning, I thought I would see what I could find on your site. Your Yoga for Vulnerability was the first video that showed up on my search. The timing couldn&#39;t be better! I was laid off yesterday and now need to start the journey of recreating my life. It is exciting and scary at the same time. This practice provided everything I needed this morning. Bless you!",Lynda Knaggs,2020-06-04T12:41:06Z,0

"I cried today when you had me hug myself and tell myself that it’s okay to feel what I’m feeling. My anxiety has been really set off by everything that’s happening all at once. I told myself that a friend wouldn’t tell me I couldn’t feel what I’m feeling, and I wouldn’t say that to a friend either. A friend wouldn’t tell me I had to do more even though my mental health says otherwise, and I wouldn’t tell a friend that. My heart is with those fighting for a more equal and just world, even though I mentally cannot take it on myself. I wish I could. Part of me feels guilty for not being able to. But, I just mentally break down when I try. I’m sorry. I support you.",AmandaonMaui,2020-06-03T21:39:27Z,0
"HI Adriene, You are the BEST ever Yoga Teacher, I mean it!  I&#39;ve been practicing Yoga for 40 years - not always consistently mind you as life gets in the way.  I love the Practice. BUT, more particularly in these extraordinary times of Covid19 Lockdown.  I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for the wonderful you tube sessions I enjoy on a daily basis.  You have helped my sanity and my mental ability to deal with these &#39;new normal&#39; times! I&#39;ve been to Austin too, and I love this beautiful Art Deco city.  You have a beautiful soul and you certainly speak to me, its as if you a my personal Yoga Trainer.  I feel privileged to have been introduced to you - I&#39;m not going back to the gym!

"Adriene I hope this comment comes to your sight. I have been following you for a couple years now and your guidances have accompanied me through many days of my life. Today this video seems to be tailored for me as I just lost my loved one few days ago. I keep telling myself it is okay to feel upset, but I just can&#39;t find a way to let those emotions out. The piped emotions turned out to be insomnia, loss of appetite and fatigue. Yoga released me and your voice comforted my helpless soul.

In dressage, the rider needs to be very supple, relaxed, mindful, and flexible while maintaining breath, balance, straightness, and engaging several muscles at once. I&#39;ve found that so many principles of yoga translate so well to dressage riding. Thank you for all that you do to help me achieve my goals and for surely helping others everywhere achieve their goals through yoga practice.

"Eventhough this is a chaotic period it is also a catalyst for change. A whole new period is starting and we will be experiencing a big shift, both internally and externally. This will be the fall of the old paradigms and social systems that didn&#39;t work. And internally we will be so much more awake and empowered. <br /><br />While all of this is going on, please try to practice self care, be introspective, face your shadows and don&#39;t forget to nurture yourself with self love.  <br />Try to let go of judgement and fear as these energies will hold you back in the old. <br /><br />We are not doing this alone. <br />I wholeheartedly wish you all the best. <br />Love. <br />-Miyu",Miyuki,2020-05-13T18:21:11Z,0

"I&#39;ve been having an extremely difficult time mentally and emotionally throughout these past 5 weeks with wanting to break down or actually breaking down every single day. Death, uncertainty, anxiety and a number of things that aren&#39;t even related to this pandemic/quarantine period; so many things one after the other, with what&#39;s happening in the world as a cherry on top. <br />I&#39;m relatively new to yoga and I don&#39;t practice it daily but when I do, it is always with Adriene. This one, like others have said, really did help a little for me...the first half of the practice I was just crying, and then when it came to hugging ourselves at the end, I started crying again.<br />Sometimes things feel like it&#39;s just way too much and that you&#39;re utterly alone...and Adriene brings comfort in knowing that you&#39;re not.",EmpressViridian,2020-05-13T10:11:16Z,0

Will take some yoga practices with me.  Will be home every day when I come home from work.  Will cook and eat meals with me.   Will workout with me.

I often wondered too if because you were or are an actress if it was all a show.  I have to admit i have little respect for self absorbed people in Hollywood.  You seem to be the opposite and keep your life and personal life separate and not in our face all the time.  I just watched an interview from 2018 and they asked you a potentially explosive question were you could have gone on a super rant but you didnt&#39; (thank you) you instead were sweet and respectful and kind.

Hi Adriene. I love your videos! In was wondering if you could help me figure out this problem I have in my wrist. I never notice the pain until after I practice yoga for a week or so. It will then start stinging when I put any amount of pressure on it in my daily life. It was an old injury from yearsss ago. I don’t want to give up yoga ever so I was wondering if there’s a solution? Will it just get better over time with practice? Would love to hear back from you ❤️,Lauren Mckinley,2020-04-21T19:16:28Z,0

This really helped me deal with some emotional stress. Although I was not completely comfortable in the fetal position (I have autism and I tend to seek more compact spaces) So I did as Adriene recommended and followed my body&#39;s signals and wrapped myself in a blanket which made me feel more comforted and less left out in the open. Maybe if you have similar issues you could try this.,Kristin Vlogs,2020-04-20T09:52:43Z,2

"A practice that made me tear up as soon as I&#39;ve started. Sometimes you just have to allow yourself to let it out. I could feel something was brewing inside of me since yesterday, and during this practice, I received the answers. The pain was coming out, and although hurtful, a beautiful experience. <br />I&#39;ve been quite good at stuffing down my emotions, and only now, at 35, am learning to truly experience whatever comes my way.<br />Life has given me that chance with an abundance. I am getting a divorce. I&#39;ve moved to another country, and I&#39;ve lost my job. <br />I am starting my life over, which at the moment means spending all the time building my coaching business. I&#39;ve been quite good at feeling grateful for everything that happened because it is giving me the chance to live more authentically. However, at times, the emotions overflow, and I feel weak.<br />I&#39;ve started doing Yoga with Adriene a few weeks ago, and it became such a significant addition to my morning prayer. It&#39;s really been helping me feel grounded and loved.<br />I&#39;ve taken the time today to read through the comments under this video, and it made me feel so connected with all of you. This crisis is a blessing in disguise. I do not remember seeing so many open and beautiful hearts as here in the comments today. We will come out better. God bless all of you.",Katia Craig,2020-04-20T08:07:16Z,1

"Processing childhood trauma (with the help of a therapist). I felt particularly depressed and defensive today. I managed to do a small low-impact workout and wanted some yoga to stretch and let go. It was impossible not to cry from the first pose - foetus. There were lots of moments in this video where I felt overwhelmed with resurfacing emotions. I really appreciated how you took me on a journey from the acceptance of my feelings to finding the power and inner strength to support myself through such challenging times. Doing the plank after child pose, for instance, was a really powerful exercise of letting go and trusting oneself that it is possible to rebuild. It gave me some faith that I can be OK right now, and I will get better. Thank you.",FreakyBo0o,2020-04-17T20:27:15Z,0

You are truly lovely. Having said that I have a question and would truly appreciate any response, from anyone! God bless and I hope and pray everyone is truly well🙏🏾☺️❤️<br />I have followed along with a few videos now and despite having a yoga mat I find that the hardwood floor/carpet causes pretty significant pain during any pose that requires me to lay on my hip or that puts extra pressure on my lower back, such as bringing my knees up to my chest (I don’t know the proper names of the poses, sorry). Does anyone else experience this? Is this normal or does it go away with practice? I admit I am quite overweight (obese actually 😣) so I acknowledge that my weight is a factor. I’ve just noticed that you are so fluid in those types of poses and I wonder how to get your body to a place where the hard floor doesn’t cause such pain.

This time they were very intense and pretty powerful. First I thought I can handle this powerful emotions this time, they felt so good, I felt an innerer warmth, a soft itch, I smiled. But I was wrong. Suddently I begun to weeping and screaming again, my body was shaking.

It&#39;s been a rough week for me due to personal feelings and issues but it has also been a week of realization. I realized this week that during my 19 years of life, I&#39;ve never learned how to love myself and that I&#39;ve always lived for others and I cried when you allowed us to hug ourselves because I&#39;ve been so mean to myself for so long, especially these past few days. I even attempted harm towards myself earlier this week but this practice has made me feel something other than sadness and worry. Relief. Thank you sincerely, Adriene.",kandra,2020-04-12T02:35:13Z,0

"I would like to share an important story with you, both for you and all those practicing with you. I have struggled for 3 years now to get my foot anywhere near my hands when transitioning from downward dog to a lunge. Spent years just dragging my foot up to place. Well, my Yoga with Adrienne 1 year  anniversary is upon us, and I&#39;ve worked steadily to get unstuck in that area. This morning, early, coming out of a store my sandal tip caught on a dip in the concrete which flipped myright foot upside down and I found myself in a misstep fall. In seconds, no thought involved, I found my self in a nice low lunge with that left foot all the way up, caught myself and pushed back to standing with my hands which don&#39;t have a MARK ON THEM! I have a small bruise on my foot is all. I am 48 years old, and as you know falls to concrete can be very serious. I know that I did the work, but I FEEL like you literally enabled me to float above a fall rather than crash into it. Bless you my friend!",DeAna Derrick,2020-04-10T17:17:15Z,0

I wasn’t feeling my best today and I was feeling kind of frustrated so I decided to try one of your videos and honestly it was such a joyful and peaceful experience. I didn’t practice yoga in 2 years. I felt my soul and body relax and calm down. Embrace the inner beauty of being a human. And also had a very nice stretch. My body feels so amazing and mind feels like as if it has flushed out all the unnecessary negative thoughts and stress. After finishing when I say that the video was 35 minutes long I couldn’t believe my eyes because it felt like 10 minutes.

I would appreciate such a video very much. Lots of love from Lübeck, Germany",Lilly McTuron,2020-04-09T13:47:26Z,0

"Thank you Adriene. <br />My nan passed away three weeks ago and I have been doing yoga to get me through (although I&#39;ve been practising for about two and a half years now). I honestly believe it has helped me bounce back quicker and control my thoughts, by coming back to the breath. Todays practice seemed perfect timing and I did it in the garden with the sun on my face. Safe to say, I smiled at the end. Thank you, I am so grateful that I found yoga ❤",Lauren Jade,2020-04-09T12:47:33Z,1

"Just a general comment, not on this video in particular.  A great deal of your videos start of seated on the ground cross legged.  This is incredibly hard/impossible for people like myself who have extremely tight hips due to spine injury.  Yes I could do the excercises seated in a chair, but there seems to be no half way house between very passive (chair) and very &quot;active&quot; (cross legged on the ground).  Could you please either do a video for people who are  injured (but not necessarily seniors needing/wanting a slow pace) that doesn&#39;t focus so much on being seated cross legged, or do some videos focussing on loosening the hips for those who have a problem there?  Many thanks!",SpiritWing,2020-04-09T10:18:44Z,0

"A lot of guilt building up from not having the mental space to get a lot of work done or finish school work. Lots to improve upon, but these flows help me create space in the mind and clear out some of the clutter. Acknowledging the clutter and allowing it to settle so it&#39;s not always right in front of my eyes. One thing I&#39;m doing well committing to in these weird times is doing yoga everyday.",Gabrielle,2020-04-09T07:44:26Z,1

"Thanks Adrienne. Home with the kids during this coronasolation. Trying to work and teach my kids and help my husband work from home and keep us all fed and safe. Some days I feel up, some down, some days I’m sad and feel like I need to cry but I can’t. I try to keep it together for the kids and give them a sense of “normal”. We talk about our new normal and the reality that they might not see their friends for a while. While providing for everyone it’s been tough to remember to fill my own cup. I’m so glad your here. When I remember to, I sit down on my mat and have quiet time with you. It makes me feel better and thankful that we can connect, even if we don’t know each other personally. I’m fortunate in my circumstances and grateful I can get breaks. Thinking of all those out there that have medical, financial, and other isolation difficulties. Reach out if you need someone. We’ll get through this together.",Lisa Dymond,2020-04-09T01:41:03Z,0

"Thank you for this, Adriene. I have been struggling since late November of last year. Had to leave a toxic job unexpectedly and floated in limbo until mid March when I got hired at my new job. I spent most of that time living as a hermit, dealing with anxiety, depression, and a sense of worthlessness. I went to my workplace&#39;s orientation and things felt on the up and up, and then the next day we were told the place would be closed for two weeks thanks to quarantine. Two days ago we were placed on furlough and the place is still closed until further notice. It&#39;s hard to catch a break. I felt something urging me to try yoga, and I&#39;m relieved to have been able to find your offering. If only for a while, this is comforting. Thanks again. Much love. &lt;3",**Nethery **,2020-04-08T04:03:31Z,0

"About 5 days ago I turned off the news. I realized during this time of self isolation that watching the 24 hour cycle of news media was pulling me into the darkness to watch it wasn&#39;t contributing anything positive to my life or my mindset. We have this idea and addiction that we have to know what&#39;s going on at all times but maybe right now we don&#39;t, maybe right now we just tune into what&#39;s going on inside of ourselves and stick with that. Instead I&#39;ve been focusing on myself, doing more self care (YWA), watching good news stories, and examples of humanity and coming together on social media. I feel a thousand times better already. It&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t have my moments in the darkness because I for sure do, but they&#39;re not artificially generated and amplified because of media consumption . This collective struggle is bringing out the humanity in people all over the world. There&#39;s a global connected energy of compassion and caring right now. Let&#39;s tap into that instead.",Queen Bee,2020-04-07T17:51:30Z,0

And I’ve only really been doing the ‘chill’ practices.

"I work in a daycare, but we&#39;ve been closed for about 3 weeks now. When we were in extended child&#39;s pose, it brought up a memory of one day when I was playing with one of the kids. I went into extended child&#39;s pose, and when I looked up at him he had mirrored my pose. I was so funny and cute, but the memory today had me crying. There were tears streaming down my face the rest of the practice. I miss my kids so much. I want to get back to singing for them and playing with them and caring for them. I want to see all their bright little faces and beautiful smiles. Yeah there&#39;s days when they drive me crazy, but I really love those kids, and it&#39;s starting to get hard for me to be away from them. The self hug at the end was hard too. I miss their hugs and cuddles. These thoughts have been weighing me down for the last few days, and I&#39;ve teared up a few times, but I haven&#39;t let myself cry about it until now. It felt good to let it out. Hopefully it won&#39;t be too long until I can see them again, but for now I know it&#39;s okay to be sad and miss them. Thank you Adriene for encouraging me to be vulnerable, and that it&#39;s okay to feel what I feel.",elladee,2020-04-06T03:19:14Z,34

"good theme..feels good to let go some sadness and already stuck anxiety, that seems never vanishes fully.. little - yes.and it,s hard to describe that feeling.. adaptación process maybe..you have time to relax and you vonder in thoughts of how can I escape this..but the reality in patient..you might hear only the confusión from my voice..but I try to stay strong..As I break over and over again..I still try to stay strong..Where the tears drops.. I hope healing starts..¨From my heart to yours¨ Namaste",Lina Vaisnoraite,2020-04-05T21:45:49Z,0

"I never enjoyed yoga in spite of trying many yoga classes (hatha, sculpt, hot) until I found your channel, Adriene. Extreme heat, loud music, unclear instruction, and pressure to complete tough poses risking injury to keep up with the person next to me totally turned me off of yoga. I didn&#39;t see how other people found it relaxing - I just found it superficial. But once I tried your videos, I realized that yoga can lead to a wonderful connection with the body. I&#39;m sleeping so much better after doing your videos before bed, and the Nurture challenge month is giving my days structure and movement opportunities that are much needed, as I transition to working full-time from home. <br>Ps. When I found out you were inspired by Mr. Roger&#39;s Neighborhood, I knew I&#39;d found a kindred spirit. He&#39;s my lifelong inspiration. Adriene, are you an introvert? I am, and I feel like you get me :) <br>- Natalie (and Luna, the Cattle Dog mix/budding yogi)",Natalie Powell,2020-04-05T21:27:23Z,2

"Dear Adriene, I woke up this morning at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5CEOjPY_uw&amp;t=6m30s"">6:30</a> disturbed by the dreams. Both of them with violent content – one like a shockwave, and in the other, my vulnerability turned into, literally, The Joker (latest version – Arthur Fleck) speaking furiously into my face and chasing me. The end of the dream was interesting - I managed to get into the yard and to lock the yard door, but that was nothing, he approached the door and totally effortlessly began to pull the door out of the hinges. Awaked but still with that frightened filling I thought that there is no escape from the truth and one should not run away from it… At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5CEOjPY_uw&amp;t=7m00s"">7:00</a> my phone rang and I said ‘Oh, it&#39;s Adriene’. I started to read and once again I was fascinated by the fact that the content of your love letter matches with mine inner flow…  Yesterday, while I was sitting at the front yard I noticed that my breathing was low, I remembered your words – take a deep breath, one you haven’t take a whole day. “Are you remembering to breathe?” Yes. “Absolving to be gentle?” Yes, my dear. Thanks &lt;3 Wish you a nice week ahead. Namaste &lt;3",Jelena Nedeljkovic,2020-04-05T17:03:55Z,0

There was like an absence of sensations. And your practice of today help me reconnect with my lower abs, my muscles inside my pelvis and this was sooooo liberating!!! I know now my intuition was right and that a part of my back problems comes from this lack of sensation. I&#39;m getting my sensations back and it is &quot;yummy&quot; like you always say.

"Although now I am an Animist at best (on account of my wise dog and horse)  I went to catholic school, where the nuns tried to instill in us some values. Interestingly, important were humbleness, meekness and purity. i was very young and had no problem with purity and understood humbleness.  But meekness was a great mystery, welly until my middle age years. Finally through yoga and meditation I started to understand meekness, which is closely there with vulnerability. For me It has to do with striving  and accepting that I will not really get there, calmly accepting the reality of my imperfection.    Always with you, from sunny Bavaria. A perfect Sunday. Thank you sweetie.",Franzie Pethal,2020-04-05T10:27:22Z,0

"Hello from Turkey? My friend has recommended your channel. I tried yoga with a group a couple of months ago but I couldnt continue. I can say yoga isnt for me. But I know how beneficial it is for my body and mental health so I just wanna try one more time. However, I dont know where to start, how often I should practice etc. And, I have flat neck sendrome, so do you think practicing yoga alone can be dangerous for me?

"So this was an interesting practice for me. I didn&#39;t feel much during the practice (I always try to find what feels good - you&#39;ve really naled the phrase! 👍😁) and I was about to get up from the feetus position right at the end and I suddenly started crying. Not a lot, but real honest tears and for a moment there I felt like myself when I was a child and it felt good. Not sure what&#39;s still there that triggered this reaction, but that was definitely a surprise. Thanks Adriene! 😘",Ilona L,2020-04-05T08:07:38Z,0
