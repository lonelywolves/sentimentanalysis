I need this to decompress from my 8 year old son who is giving me a hard time about doing his online class work. I really wish he could attend school. I really don&#39;t have patience with him at this time. So yoga Session. Yessssssssss!  Very much needed.,Archangel Revelations,2021-03-10T15:31:09Z,1
"i finished breath in jan, and ive missed a few days on breath and within this journey, but this time i missed five days in a row and i felt awful about it, i almost missed today, but i told myself that i&#39;ve come to far to give up now, so i got on the mat and i&#39;ve never been more proud. I used to think that missing a couple days mean failure and that i should just not come back because i&#39;m not strong enough to stick it out everyday, but i&#39;ve realized how much strength i have for showing up after five days without yoga. When you said &quot; don&#39;t let anyone rush you&quot;, i almost cried because i always feel like i have to keep up with everyone on these journeys, and that why i always fail, but now i&#39;m learning that everyone has different journeys and paths they go on.",Savannah Buckner,2021-03-02T02:21:17Z,1

Any recommendations on how to improve or strengthen the neck muscles?",Tatiana Hernandez,2021-02-18T23:42:19Z,0

"Day 18.. feeling more open in my hips but still struggling with abdominal work. My ankles are loosening up.. to a point where I am almost resting my heals down on downward dog.  I know attempted to lift my legs up and back but ended up keep my toes on the ground for stability.. as I gain more stability I will work towards that but Rome wasn&#39;t built in a day right? I am exactly where I am supposed to be, where I need to be.. Practicing daily yoga 🧘‍♀️ to feel more like the me I know I can be.",Jacki Siddall,2021-02-18T09:09:58Z,1

"Happy new year to everyone who is one this journey! Today I found myself unable to keep up with the practice, which is strange as usually I can (while sweating buckets but still). So I decided to do what Adrian keeps saying and listen to what my body was saying; I paused the video, and meditate for the rest of the time. After listening I realized I forgot to eat supper last night and had yet to drink any water or eat this morning. I was running on autopilot, which is not how we obtain results from our practice. now that I&#39;ve taken some self car I&#39;m beginning to feel much better! Honestly, listen to your body, if it&#39;s saying stop or pause, there is good reason!",Michael S,2021-01-02T18:54:31Z,2

"Good morning yoga fam! I am doing the HOME series during our second lockdown here in Hamburg and as usual I am having a hard time sticking to a routine, showing up every day because I have the most chaotic squirrel mind that wouldn&#39;t let me rest often. Sometimes I &quot;forget&quot; to show up to the mat for one or two days or I think I can&#39;t make time (which is wrong) and then I tend to get frustrated the next time bc I didn&#39;t stick to my routine. So, to me doing yoga poses often isn&#39;t the hardest part - but to keep the promise I made to myself, which is to try to simply show up and relax my mind :&#39;D I don&#39;t know who can relate to this feeling, but I thought I&#39;d share my struggle for anyone who might be in a similar state of mind. Anyway: I showed up today and I am feeling so much better after waking up with a full head again. Thank you, Adriene for being the coolest virtual yoga buddy in isolation &lt;3",Harbour Violet Music,2020-11-29T09:16:41Z,5

"Adriene, you should know that an ad at the end of your yoga videos was played at the end of a session I did this morning. It was an ad for a young rapper showing images of a strip club with strippers bent all the way over, no underwear, and twirking. It was explicit. I could see their anus. Thank GOD there were no children in the living room! I&#39;m reporting the ad to you tube. They clearly aren&#39;t screening their ad content. It was completely inappropriate and especially the wrong kind of content to play at the end of a yoga video. I know you have no control over the ads being played but wanted to make you aware of it.",rrh31,2020-10-04T14:16:12Z,0

It is late, far later than I like to do this practice, I have a sore shoulder and I almost skipped. But when you want to skip tends to be the time you need it the most, right? <br /><br />When Adriene said &quot;wherever you are today...everything is as it should be&quot; I felt a huge release and just bawled my eyes out  (and   continued to do so throughout much of the practice...not something that has happened before). I couldn&#39;t find my balance today, I felt sore, and just so exhausted from the day and yet this was one of the most rewarding days of this Home practice...because it was exactly as it should have been, warts and all. <br /><br />Thanks to this channel.

"Today was a rough one for me. I wrote a very important exam yesterday and it went okay, but today my mind just went all over the place and I just can&#39;t stop thinking about all the things I didn&#39;t know and I keep on asking myself &quot;What if you failed, you didn&#39;t know this and that to get all the points for this question?!&quot; I was crying the whole time ...part of because I was so stressed the last couple of weeks without really recognising it and now I could release it ...part of because I struggle with letting go of my anxiety and just worrying way too much about the &quot;What if&#39;s...&quot;! Irony has it, this day is called Believe and I almost laughed out when I read it. On the bright sight, I notices my left feet got closer to the ground in Downward Dog and I didn&#39;t struggle with keeping my balance ...weirdly, because my mind was/is not in sync with my breath.

I struggled with balance today which is unusual for me but it is also extremely hot and humid and so it was hard to concentrate. Had sweat rolling in my eyes and my glasses falling off my face. I did the whole thing despite those hiccups and now I&#39;m quite proud of myself.  I&#39;m gonna cool off in the shower now. See everybody tomorrow!

Great to be able to do the high lunges and balance pretty well on the reconstructed ankle. Love it when you say ...you’ve got this ! Yes I had.  I like the option to ease off, not always given so you feel that you need to push.

"Am i the only person that still cannot really do downward dog? I&#39;ve been doing yoga with adriene for almost two months now but I&#39;m still collapsing or shaking and can&#39;t get my heels near teh ground and it&#39;s really discouraging and takes me out of the practice. It seems like it&#39;s supposed to be an easyish resting pose but i just can&#39;t get the hang of it and now I think im overthinking it and beating myself up. Does anyone know of any adjustments for downward dog I can do? Sorry, don&#39;t mean to complain, I really have been enjoying these practices but I have noticed a pattern where whenever downward dog is mentioned I just check out mentally.",princesskatie331,2020-06-29T02:09:53Z,1
"I think it can take a while for DD to feel like a resting pose, and there&#39;s people who&#39;ve been doing it for years and can&#39;t get their heels on the ground yet! It can def be frustrating when you struggle with a pose, but it&#39;s important to work with where your body is at right now, rather than where you want it to be. I would maybe just try doing it for as long as you can each time, without pushing yourself to stay in the pose as long as the video. You might be surprised at how your strength can build up over time with patience and perseverance :)",Ellie King,2020-08-19T01:19:22Z,0
I took a almost 2 months break inbetween day 16 and day 17. Today I really noticed what progress I had made before because today was so hard. I got kinda weak but it´s actually really really nice to notice that in my body. I´m excited to get stronger again :),Hallifaxv,2020-06-27T21:26:08Z,0

It&#39;s the little things. It&#39;s hard work and persistence doing something so enjoyable you barely notice the progress over time.

"This one was so tough. I lost my balance and toppled a bit, but just tried to bring it back to what felt good and comfortable. As a newbie it’s a steep learning curve, remembering to breathe is vital. I started with silent breaths on day 1, day 18 and I’ve got louder as I’ve owned my own breath and used it to anchor me, help me move. I cannot wait to see where I end up.",Samantha Tyler,2020-06-05T15:04:42Z,0

But halfway through this practice something hit me and I paused the video, picked up my phone, and texted her to apologize.

I absolutely love these faster-paced practises. They fly by but I never want them to end. Anyone else struggle with keeping thins in parallel during some of these balances?

"I did couple years of dancing and gymnastics when I was little, but balance always seems to be a struggle for me. I&#39;ve improved with this program, but this session was hard when she had us lean forward and lift our back leg off the ground.",Wannabanauthor,2020-05-07T17:55:15Z,0
"This practice was such a blessing for me today. It&#39;s just beginning to get hot where I am and I have some  physical issues that mean that I easily pass out or feel ill in the heat. After a discouraging walk that had to end early, this was a reminder that my body is strong, that I need to listen to my own limits, and that I can have grace for myself even when I can&#39;t do everything I want to. Thank you, Adriene.  :)",April Klooster,2020-05-03T22:31:29Z,1
"I am getting so frustrated. Is it only me or the practices are faster and harder each day? I really struggled to keep up, but pausing and rewatching the video takes me out of this zone where I really focus on my breath and my body... So I try to keep up but it makes my breathe harder and then trying to move with my breath should probably look like a cardio workout... So yeah, I am annoyed.",Monocerosik,2020-05-02T21:50:58Z,0
"I am really new to Yoga after wanting to give it a go for years. I am on day 18 now and so in love with this practice. Post-session reflection/thoughts and I just wanted to say -  thank you so so much Adriene (and Benji &lt;3 ) for being you, putting these sessions together for us and making it such an enjoyable experience. I may be alone at home whilst I practice, but with these videos I feel I could be anywhere. I look forward to them all day and it has really sparked a love for Yoga and started a new journey that I am so excited about. Thank you so much for inspiring me to move and breath and just be me &lt;3 Love to you all &lt;3",Merkira,2020-05-02T21:32:16Z,0

Didn&#39;t sleep well but this is exactly what I <b>didn&#39;t</b> know I needed to get up in the morning. One note - I&#39;m left handed so my left leg has always been stronger and better balanced. Lifting my left foot first knocked me over and I thought I couldn&#39;t do it but then on the left side I was golden! Can we start more things left side first?

As I settle, I start smiling to myself and enjoy wiggling my fingers and grabbing my toes like a baby. Life is taken so seriously and the amount of pressure we put on ourselves daily turns us into machines, not people. Thank you rekindling the inner child and for making me remember that life is fun, life is play, and ultimately that we should be proud of ourselves for being here and even trying.

Doing this during the cuarantine in Spain.... to be honest im a day behind and have been throughout the 30 days with doing two sessions in a day to catch up and  I know thats exactly what its not meant to be a rush to get it done but Ive never been good at consistency -i hope this is what this will teach. This session was tough and i thought it was becasue i was pushing myself with doing a million other things but I read some comments here and I see that some of us have found it difficult to. I hope to actually catch up with 19 and start getting into a consistent flow. <br />Thank you Adriene!,Shalima Khan,2020-04-19T09:52:22Z,0

"Dear Adriene, I’m so glad I found your channel! I decided to start this journey with the 30 day yoga challenge, and all I can say is thank you! I always wanted to start to try doing yoga, but the fear of not being able to do things right always pushed me backwards. But by following your videos and seeing how you encourage us to embrace the stage we are in and to keep showing up, I understood that it’s ok if we struggle, and if we continue we eventually start seeing some small changes happening. Thanks to you, I started to really enjoy this practice and realized that by not being so hard on myself I could actually learn new things that seemed scary at first and keep growing. <br />❤️ Lots of love for you and Benji  ❤️",Beatriz Martins,2020-04-17T19:00:05Z,0
"This is my second time doing &#39;home&#39;, I usually do it daily but with a day off a week or something. I find this one incredibly hard, my shoulders and arms are weak, my left hip and thigh did not enjoy to be solely responsible for keeping me up, and holding my hands behind my back makes my fingers feel swollen and it&#39;s so uncomfortable! This was the first time in a few weeks that I&#39;ve actually felt a bit crap after yoga, but reading comments is always nice and I never gave up, just took a few childs poses :)",No Head,2020-04-17T11:55:46Z,0

"Day 18 completed! I am so happy to be back on the mat. My allergies got very bad for the past few day. I was to the point where my nose was so stuffed I couldn’t breath. Thankfully with the help of some allergy relief medicine I have everything under control. While it was a little hard to sync up my breath today, I am still so happy I am back on the mat. But this goes to show that your journey is your own. If you miss a day that’s okay! All the matters is you get right back on. That’s the beauty of at home yoga you go at your own pace. And even if you miss a day, the yoga will be right here for you when you get back. I am so proud of all of you who have made it this far. Namaste everyone.",Crochet Streams,2020-04-17T06:02:27Z,0

"Today&#39;s practice was surprisingly emotional. I woke up today with a familiar feeling of melancholy but couldn&#39;t do yoga at all in the day. Instead, I spent time with family and connected with them helping bring my spirit up. When I got to the matt and hearing you say that this is the exact time we&#39;re meant to be here it resonated. When it got to warrior 1 and lifting my leg on the left, I just shook and couldn&#39;t find balance. Instead of getting upset and angry at myself, I paused the video and just told myself to breathe. Through breath and not allowing myself to fall despite my mind telling me to, I flew. It felt really powerful too. I couldn&#39;t have done that a year ago. Even if today started sadly, I can end it happily believing in the strength I possess. Thank you, Adriene! :)",chi chi,2020-04-13T12:55:50Z,0

"Manila has been put on enhanced community quarantine (or lockdown, as some call it) from March 15 to April 14. Entering our 4th, and hopefully final week, today’s practice, aptly titled “Believe” (Day 18 of Home), got me a little bit emotional. Adriene usually encourages us to have an intention when we practice, or to commit to something for ourselves. I never took it seriously. This morning, I’d like to think I tried — as I believe (and hope &amp; pray) that the world heals and recovers from Covid already. <br /><br />Stay healthy &amp; safe everyone.

I kept trying to catch up, but couldn’t. During these trying times, I’ve been able to find my way Home, and it’s been so fulfilling. I’ve been doing your practices for almost a year now, and they’ve completely changed my life. You have been such a blessing to the world through your practices. Every time I get on the mat with you, I feel the love and compassion you put into every video. I’m truly grateful for you and for what I’ve found in myself during my yoga journey. Through you, I’ve been able to love myself again, fully. I love you (in a totally not creepy way, I promise), even my husband knows 😂, and I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy.

"Hello Adriene this is Amelie from West Yorkshire in the U.K. I’m about to do Day 18 of your Home practice in preparation for the day ahead. I’m a 61 year old voluntary flood warden and we are bracing ourselves for the impact of Storm Dennis, having already been battered and flooded by Storm Ciara last week. I personally haven’t been flooded but 200 homes lower down have. You might ask why I’m doing this practice when I could be out checking drains etc. The reason is that through this practice from your videos I’ve learnt that I’m set up emotionally for the day. I have more resources to draw upon and today, I’m going to need a lot of inner resources as folk get stressed and upset. Thank you Adriene. What you so generously offer here has affects you can’t imagine and I feel privileged to pass those on in the form of what I hope is calm, compassionate care of my self and my community.

"This was my first return to the mat since mid-late January, and what a one to hop back on with. I feel energized and reminded that all of the things I learned and grew with over the first 17 days are here for me, and I can finish strong, even if it&#39;s February now! Hoping to finish in time to do a few videos off the February calendar. Sending love and strength to anyone out there who, like me, is still journeying home.",Allie N,2020-02-02T17:26:28Z,1

Today was a little bit harder for me  I get really bad foot cramps randomly and about a couple of hours before I was going to get on the mat I had one. I was a little nervous but I just followed your saying of listen to your body and when it didn&#39;t feel quite right on my foot I just modified the pose or went to child&#39;s pose for a bit.

"I really didn&#39;t feel like showing up today... Such a long, torturous day. Kids in the school I subsitute in were exceptionally violent and loud today, been called every foul name in the book and had my shines kicked multiple times by frustrated pupils... It&#39;s hard having to force punishments (sitting in a chair in the break time and such, nothing violent or oppressive on our sides) when you haven&#39;t given them and technically it&#39;s your hour off, but since it was a schoolmeeting in the evening I didn&#39;t get to leave to home and I wanted to help instead of going to the grocery store or just outside for an hour. Sometimes I think I&#39;m too good for this world. It was hard keeping my balance, keeping my composure and not going in the argument. I&#39;ve been holding a pupil back from stabbing another pupil with scissors yesterday and still I felt more balanced doing that than what I did today. What a crazy job I have sometimes.But how they need me to show up everyday, stay grounded, stay calm. Be their center when they can&#39;t find their own. So glad I showed up. Because if I can show up for them everyday, I better show up for myself too. Or I&#39;ll lose it oneday and they will be the victims. Selfcare to care. That&#39;s what I truelly believe.",Naamah Notorious,2020-01-23T21:48:22Z,0

I also believe that believing is the reason why I&#39;m alive. Now, about that video.. I couldn&#39;t do the &quot;Spiderman Abs&quot; move as I call it on my right side. Mostly because my right lower side was sore. I did my best nonetheless. I liked the balance exercise at the end. I did much better on my left side than on my right one, though.

I guess that this home journey is makeing me realise all this. Wasn&#39;t expecting this when I strated the journey.",Miranda,2020-01-21T18:39:26Z,0

"Hi Adriene, I was able to do this practice with you yesterday but the comments section was not showing. I just discovered that when my iPad is in portrait mode the “comments” section is hidden. I turned the iPad in landscape mode and, Voila! Comments section reappeared. :)<br /><br />Believe. Boy, did I need this message yesterday. There was this energy on me yesterday, like two hands were around my neck trying to choke my joy, hope, and love. I wasn’t even planning on doing yoga yesterday, but my inner life-force, plus my Angels, inspired me not to give up. <br /><br />So, I squeezed it in after a shower, and an hour before the Y closed. I am so glad I made it! I sensed that my body, and my energetic body are in rhythm now with a flow of ease when I get on the mat...it doesn’t take long to surrender.  I also felt a nice rinsing away of any heaviness and doubt. Believing the “Yes” that is in my heart even when there is a “No” staring back at me. <br /><br />You are a great partner on this journey with us, Adriene. And I trust You.",Nickolet Allen,2020-01-21T04:32:54Z,0

"I was feeling cheery when I got on the mat, then started tearing up within the first couple minutes... it wasn&#39;t sad, per se, and I&#39;m not sure where it came from, but I thought &quot;well, maybe it&#39;s just what I need right now&quot; -- right after which Adriene asked us, gently, if we could believe that we are exactly where we&#39;re meant to be.<br />...which, I think, speaks to the moment in the present and the &quot;meta-moment&quot; in time. where we are right then and there, and also, where we are in our lives. I&#39;ve struggled a lot with this in the past (as I&#39;m sure many of us have) especially in context re: narratives about how successful we &quot;should&quot; be - and that fear, that &quot;not enough&quot;-ness keeps up stagnant. Learning to let go and believe is so key to letting energy moving with freshness, vitality, and faith. <br />Parts of today&#39;s practice felt very intuitive to me - my body made natural adjustments, without thinking, to make the movement strike the right balance between challenge + listening. I met my appropriate edge and listened to my body at the same time. <br />Now, I&#39;m at that strange place between happy and sad - a bit raw and exposed, but alive and here. So -- namaste to all, and may we honor where we are now while still moving forward. The paradox of growth...",Grace Kim,2020-01-20T19:57:06Z,0

Anyone else been experiencing a lot of Headaches since starting this journey?  Adriene - is there some reason for my headaches as a result of the yoga this month?  I can&#39;t think what else i&#39;ve done to cause them?  I&#39;m not stressed or tense yet feel a build up in my shoulders?  Wondered if this was a release of toxins from the routines or whether we&#39;ve done something that may have caused traps to tense up?  Going to try and get a massage!  Just wondered if there was a link?,Lisa weston,2020-01-20T11:03:56Z,0

It&#39;s 2am. I just got home from a long day of studying (for a test that is important for my career)<br />I get down to the mat. It starts raining outside. I feel loved; I felt it throughout the day.. I felt &#39;blanketed&#39; in grace. Am I surprised that the theme is Believe? Not at all! I am smiling! Namaste!,Majda Attar,2020-01-20T01:11:40Z,0

"Day 18 Believe there is good in the world even when all you see is the evil.<br />I posted on the fwfg community about what happened this morning, I awoke to mom tell me that my 2 lovely bunnies were missing and it turns out early this morning a man that lives in our area stole them for meat and I think I am still in shock and I feel like this world has so much curel people that I can drown in all bad and the entire day I keep hoping that my bunnies are okay and maybe I will get them back but it&#39;s so unlikely. I spent so much time taking care of them and loving them I don&#39;t know how someone could kill them, I angry and sad and hurt but mostly I feel vialated cause he came into our place and took them and maybe it seems petty but if you love something and spend so much time and effort and money on it and it become family and some just rips it away, trust me you would feel the same.<br />I was not even able to get a recent picture of them cause I didn&#39;t think I would have to let go of them so soon.<br /> Today getting on the mat was just me going through the motions and I had to anchor myself both mentally and emotional in breathing staying present, I a little less burden but everything is still fresh and I don&#39;t think I will be okay for a while  but hopefully I will heal from this in time.<br />I hope everyone had a better Sunday than I did and if not just breathe you got this and things will get better with time. Adriene thank u for this practice and the meditation practice much love to you and benji, Namaste Everyone and goodnight 💞💗💓💖❤🙏",Vanessa Morris,2020-01-20T00:55:46Z,0

"A caution - in the crunch position do not “give your neck a gentle tug” never, never, never pull on your neck to bring your shoulders up.  Use your abs to bring your shoulders off the mat and towards the ceiling.  Your hands cradling your head are their to support your head Never to pull your head, neck up.

"I have been practicing Yoga with Adriene almost every day since the year that 30 days of Yoga came out, have NEVER once commented before, but want to share something happening on Weds Jan 22 2020 (at 8 PM EST (3 days from now): <a href=""https://www.ramdass.org/"">https://www.ramdass.org</a>. <br />It&#39;s a moment of BEING HERE NOW to honor the spirit of Ram Dass and ourselves and each other!<br />I&#39;ll be there and I betcha Adriene will be too!  <br />Not to be annoying, but I&#39;ll post the same thing on more of the recent Home videos, as I&#39;m sure many people who love Adriene would also love to be a part of this, and some people are still catching up.<br />Since this is the first, and probably last time, I&#39;ll ever feel moved to share something like this, I just have to say, as so many others have, how miraculous Adriene&#39;s influence has been me. Practicing asana with her has truly changed my life. It has led me into a meditation practice and honestly, a complete transformation of both my inner and outer worlds.<br />Adriene is truly a guiding beacon of light, and I thank her profoundly in my heart at least once during every practice for being who she is and doing what she does. <br />Namaste everyone!<br />Zoë",Zoe Kovel,2020-01-19T18:30:29Z,0

"Loved today&#39;s practice rolled out of bed onto the mirror of my mat. Again, filled with gratitude especially as I could feel a mood that could have easily stayed the day. The yoga practice today  helped me shift a mindset after a disagreement with partner about dog! I stayed stewing for a short while.  Thankfully, time on my mat this month has served me to find my breath, I was able to recognise the woods around me and soften. I believe in Yoga and this is a special programme of finding inner resources and strengthening them.  All together we are making change that on the collective is powerful. I read that 144k people doing something positive together creates a shift. Thank you and to Adriene for building this movement over the years! Looking forward to Monday knowing if I wake up exhausted then I can lie down on my mat and breathe through 33 mins practice tomorrow! It&#39;s good to have that option as it softens the showing up into an invitation. I&#39;m great at falling off after bells and whistles at the beginning so that is something that holds me steady. I appreciate hearing that early on.",Jo Chew,2020-01-19T18:12:50Z,0

"I was so focused on breathing that I didn&#39;t think about anything else. It doesn&#39;t happen too often so it was such a relief for my mind. <br />I hope someone caught me because I couldn&#39;t keep my balance at least twice :) <br />It was such a meaningful practice. I still can&#39;t trust that I&#39;m exactly where I should be but I&#39;m on my way and it&#39;s the right one.<br />Thank you so much for today&#39;s practice, I feel a bit calmer.",Osoroshii,2020-01-19T17:51:09Z,0

This was absolutely perfect! I noticed so many positive changes last week that I was becoming borderline prideful. The difficulty I found lifting one leg off the ground while clasping my hands behind my back and gazing into the pool was VERY humbling. I eventually accomplished the pose. Not fluidly. Not beautifully like Adriene and I&#39;m sure others in the Kula. Instead I did it slowly tentatively like me. That&#39;s ok. If I had been born able to do it I wouldn&#39;t have to practice. Thank Adriene and Kula for sticking with me right where I am. Namaste`,kristi shore,2020-01-19T16:55:39Z,0

Your Sunday letter hit right at HOME 😌 today. Words I really needed to hear and appreciate. I’m really looking forward to both the meditation and the practice today to let it all sink in. Thank you always Adriene.,Reconnect with True,2020-01-19T14:30:07Z,1
My breath and movements were not flowing with you today. Following your guiding message to find what feels good helped. For some reason clasping the hands behind me and leaning forward makes my arms tingle so I switched to airplane arms. Next up your meditation on Kula.,Kimberly Marqui,2020-01-19T14:27:36Z,0

"Double bill again with day 17 and 18! poor Benji getting scared awww sweety don&#39;t worry your mum didn&#39;t mean to scare you. hehe :)  <br /><br /><br />ok so todays session I had to modify warrior 1 as my left hip was pinching for some reason (think it might be my bed messing my alignment), and though i retracted it back it twinged abit so i had to do the modified closer to the ground one which actually felt really nice. My shoulders were burning and I had to take the 3 legged dog easy as my energy was up and down and my hip was hurting me. so important to take a childs pose if needed and i lifted my hands up out in front to my finger tips which gave my tummy more space, then i changed to extended as my tree trunks (aka legs) are big so its hard to breathe in the normal childs pose. I really had to push through this one today and listen. I literally have the space of my yoga mat length wise and that&#39;s it so have to modify alot of the open arm and leg movements but its ok, work with what you got ey !<br /><br /><br /> I wanted to do a forearm headstand to relieve pressure off my left ankle as my varicose vains have been hurting my ankle and leg but it didn&#39;t happen i wasn&#39;t focused enough. Maybe tomorrow.<br /><br /><br />Thanks again Adriene and Benji! Xx",Nicole O Scott,2020-01-19T14:15:13Z,0

Today I woke up almost dreading getting on the mat. It’s Sunday. I’ve done 17 days in a row I can skip today. I try to go back to sleep. My mind wouldn’t let me. So I got on the mat and I’m so glad I did. Just like every other day. My conditioning is telling me to stop doing this. It’s “hard” it’s “early” you deserve a day off. But this is good for me so despite what my conditioned brain tells me. I’m going to stick with it. I hope you all have stellar days ✌🏼👽,Mrs. Demarco,2020-01-19T12:45:13Z,375
"This is exactly what happened to me today! It&#39;s now 1.15am and I knew it would be challenging. It was. I still have to work on not being afraid to fall, not being angry with myself that I can&#39;t go further, do more, that I&#39;m not as strong as I want to be, not hating the fact that I shake. But it&#39;s day 18, and I have showed up every day so far, no matter what. I KNOW I have come farther, I know I will continue to make steps forward even if today I wobbled, physically and mentally. But I was here. On the mat. All that matters. Thank you, Adriene.",Maria Theresa,2020-11-01T01:18:30Z,4

"I’ve been going through a lot in my life and I’m at a real breaking and crucial point right now that I need to make a huge decision that is gonna change a lot of things. Yoga and practicing and learning Buddhism are helping me so much not only to endure this, but to transform my life views, my emotional strength, test my limits. Through this practice I had a lot of feelings: at first, I was happy to be doing everything well and in pace, and then frustration came in when I started to lose confidence in not snatching everything, losing focus, feeling irritated. But I still pushed through. I still believed I could finish this practice, that I could carry on this year and do what it takes to change my life. Thank you so much Adrienne.

It&#39;s okay to take a child&#39;s pose break when you need it! Everybody&#39;s body is different. Some days I&#39;ve taken several child&#39;s pose breaks that weren&#39;t in the scheduled practice the past year because my body needed it.

"Namaste from Southern France, to everyone practicing on Day 18! 🙏 And thank you so much, Adriene! I had a horrible night with my littlest one having night terrors for 2 hours, then the neighbours having a loud party until the wee hours... Was so tired and honestly, very cranky this morning. I decided to start my day with your practice, and you have turned my mood around completely. Thank you for saving this day for me! Your final words of showing up on the mat each morning to believe in oneself spoke deeply to me...",Fluffy Fibers,2020-01-19T07:40:28Z,15

"Day 18 - Believe! I swear when I saw the title yesterday I was a little hessitant to believe this was going to be good. When I showed up, I tried to flush away those insecurities and apply what I learned so far. And oh boy it was so good! 😍 Nice movements, a great challenge to find what feels good and just go as far as the body allows you too without pushing your boundaries. My expectations where totally different to what I achieved, just because I surrendered and believed! ❤️ Awesome practice! 💪🏻 Namaste! 🙏🏻",Deborah,2020-01-19T06:59:36Z,36
Yes! I did more in the balance work than I expected to....but just let expectation and pressure go and surrendered and believed that my body would go as far as it was able and it surprised me ☺️,Helen Brunner,2020-01-19T09:57:28Z,2
"I have endometriosis, so some days of the month can be a bit of a struggle. Today is one of those days. In the past I&#39;ve usually just not done yoga on particularly painful and lethargic days, but I decided to try this one out today anyway. I love that Adriene always reminds us to listen to our bodies, and to take &#39;softer&#39; options if we feel that&#39;s what we need. I think I really realised how important and kind that is today (a lot of child&#39;s poses for me). It&#39;s weird, but despite all the difficult symptoms these times of the month bring, they do actually make me slow down and listen a lot more. It&#39;s kind of a gift (though a somewhat barbed one XD). Anyway, much love to everyone! Enjoy today &lt;3",Ilinx,2020-01-19T06:57:53Z,184
"I haven’t got a chronic condition (deep respect to those who do) but gardening today gave me stabbing lower back pain, to the point I couldn’t bend over to put socks on.

"I wasn&#39;t sure I was going to do this today. But you reminded me I can do other things if something is too hard. I have chronic lyme, so not the same thing you&#39;re dealing with, but I am in a massive amount of pain today, especially my legs. But your comment spurred me on. Here I go! <br />Thank you. &lt;3",Fyre Heart Studios,2020-02-05T03:09:43Z,3

Not Endo for me but cysts and I feel ya.  You are proof that body and mind can work together to allow you to do what you&#39;re capable of in that moment and not struggle unnecessarily. Lots of hugs to all.,Carrie Meadows,2020-01-19T21:25:45Z,6
