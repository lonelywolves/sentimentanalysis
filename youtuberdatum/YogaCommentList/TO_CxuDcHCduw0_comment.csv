"This sequence is an absolute favorite of mine. I started doing yoga at home (and found Adriene shortly after) around the time I started seeing a nutritionist for eating disorder recovery. I didn&#39;t intend for yoga to become a part of my recovery-- I just wanted a way to stay active during quarantine. It wasn&#39;t until I started doing videos with Adriene every day that I realized just how much my eating disorder and PTSD head kept me from existing in, experiencing, and connecting with my own body. Videos like these are so accessible (in so many ways! physically, emotionally, spiritually, intellectually), meeting me where I am while also gently encouraging me to push past my perceived limits. I genuinely love my body for the first time in my life-- not because it looks good, but because it is strong and powerful and capable of so much. I still struggle with feeling too aware in my body but yoga has become key to overcoming the fear and trauma associated with my body, and I&#39;m so thankful for this online community for helping me do what years of therapy couldn&#39;t.",Annabeth Mellon,2020-11-09T12:53:45Z,2

"I wish I had read the comments first. I desperately needed something light that would NOT make me sweat today. Feel this was mis-labeled - to me ‚Äúgetting to know‚Äù your body means taking your time. I have been doing yoga every day for years, but I still need time for transitions and this was way too fast. I could I let get ten minutes in and will have to find something else to undo the knots from this. Just wish the high intensity ones came with clearer warnings instead of the other way around.

I realized last time I did yoga that my elbows are weird and whenever I&#39;ve attempted downward facing dog in the past my elbows hurt, but I think it&#39;s because my inner elbows were facing up. Not sure how I manage to do that (like I said, my elbows are weird!!) but I made a point to have my inner elbows pointed towards my body this time instead of up and it was MUCH easier!",butterfly17095,2020-01-18T19:21:56Z,0

I was studying to become a personal trainer when I got rear ended, resulting in a herniated disc in my cervical spine. Unable to go back to my regular routine I started practicing here with you. Leading me to a studio, a life changing practice, and a passion so big I made it my life‚Äôs work. I am now a yoga teacher who focuses on accessibility, safety, mobility, and empowering others to connect and feel good in their body. I have had many teachers along my journey but all great journeys start with a first step and that my friend is you. And now I understand how crucial that first or first few experiences with yoga and a teacher can be.

I thank you Adriene for my ability to no longer worry about how I look but enjoy how I feel in the poses and for realising that it`s no biggy if today I am not as `good` as yesterday and to know that tomorrow will be different again.

I totally neglected my body and, more importantly, my mental health. Over the past two weeks, my back started to hurt, my hips became tight, and my jaw was always clenching. The neglect of my body and mind started to leak into my school work and social life. The video was a wonderful reminder to take care of the body and mind. I was starting to get lost into the cycle of self-neglect, indulgence and procrastination, but this video grounded me. As of right now, I have clarity and peace of mind to focus. Thank you Adrienne!

My surgeon said the worse thing a person with lumbar spine issues is cobra or anything the involves reverse hyper extending the back.  It&#39;s probably what caused the fractures.  I think it would be great if you said it&#39;s not good for people with spinal stenosis disc degenerative disease herniated disc...

"Hello, Adriene! I started doing yoga 4 years ago and got really into it but then I got really sick and almost bedbound for a year. Unfortunately, it really affected my general body tone and my state of mind in a bad way. Two months ago, in June, I had a surgery that fixes my condition. The recovery has been slow but sure so now I&#39;m finally allowed to get back to yoga. It&#39;ll take some time to reconnect with my body after such a harsh year, not expecting any quick results or dramatic changes but that&#39;s fine.<br />I&#39;m just truly thankful for all your wonderful thoughts and practices. You saved my life.<br /><br />I live in Russia and it&#39;s insanely hot here in August, it&#39;s about 36 C. Can you make a video for hot weather please?
