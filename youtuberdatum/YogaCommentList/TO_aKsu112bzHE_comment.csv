"@Maral Ghiglia I think it also depends on your mood and current Situation so question is, if the vid is right for you this special day. If you would have chosen the video because you struggle with neck pain both physically and psychological induced, then her words are no jabbering but calming and comforting. If you search a happy-start into the day video with a little sporty Challenge, you are Better served with a different Video. So good we have so many to choose for each mood :)",A.

Hi Adriene<br />First I want to say Thankyou for your video. Whenever I have felt I just can anymore I turn to your videos and it gives me some relief. <br />I was just wanting to ask I notice in your video when we do the head side stretch and then raise the other hand I felt some popping sensations within my ear (not an ear pop) but like around the ear area. Is this a sign of relief tension? <br />Thanks Isabela,Isabela Oliver,2021-03-03T07:53:02Z,0

"I’ve been dealing with pretty debilitating low back pain/strain the past few weeks as a result of overextending during a hard sculpt class, and it has been a huge struggle for me to patiently wait for my body to heal and not go back into the workouts I am used to/wanting to do. I have multiple times over the past weeks felt like my body was close enough to being back to normal that I could go back to these workouts thinking I’d be okay.... but then end up making the pain worse/re-straining my back😣. I gave this video a shot today in an attempt to do something more gentle, mindful, without overwhelming my body.... and I feel so much more relaxed by taking it easy while I’m not quite at 100% physically. I think what Adriene helps me with the most is being more in touch with my body - and that reminder to “find what feels good”. It’s so important!!! Thanks Adriene for giving me and so many other such valuable content!! You are a Godsend 🙏🏻",Mallory J,2021-01-09T01:07:28Z,0

I tried this video, but when I sit in sukhasana properly I have a horrible tightness on the top of my thighs, running from my hip bones to the top of my quads (I think my hip flexors). I can barely sit in the sukhasana position because of it, and my feet go numb as well. My heart rate is over 110 because it takes so much effort to hold it. Do you have any recommendations or know how to fix this?  I have lumbar lordosis, and I am already sitting on blocks, if that matters. Thanks so much!",Lily Strehlow,2020-12-26T19:23:38Z,0

"Adriene,<br /><br />I just wanted to drop by and say thank you, from the bottom of my heart. For the past few years I haven&#39;t been too well physically or mentally, and most of the time I&#39;ve felt like my illnesses have completely taken over my life and my personality. The worst one is my panic disorder, which often prevents me from, for example, being alone in fear of another panic attack and causes me daily physical pain and suffering due to the severe symptoms I experience. I&#39;ve been trying to get into yoga on and off for a while now, but only recently did I manage to muster the strength to finally attempt to make it a habit, in order to slowly heal both my body and mind. Luckily, that&#39;s when I stumbled onto your channel, and your videos have been nothing short of incredible.<br /><br />I&#39;m currently doing one of your 30 days of yoga -series&#39; along with whatever other content that speaks to me on that day, and today it was this video as my body felt completely tensed up and very sore once again. As I found the sense of calm you were talking about around the beginning of the practice, I felt my eyes start to water. My body was finally letting go of, if not all, but most of the tension and pain that I carry every single day. This happens a lot with other videos too, I always feel much better and lighter after practice but today it just went to a whole other level, and I felt like today I actually realized the impact yoga is having on me and my journey to recovery after all these years. And it&#39;s all thanks to you. I just can&#39;t comprehend the fact that you are giving out so much relief, comfort and pure hope to me and so many others completely for free and that it&#39;s all so easily accessible. My life is finally starting to get better, I&#39;m starting to get stronger and little by little, even if it&#39;s for half an hour at a time, I&#39;m able to let go.<br /><br />Thank you so much &lt;3",sp0ksonat,2020-07-20T09:56:57Z,0

Amazing how 45 minutes can make such a difference. I feel so much calmer now and though my mind wandered in both videos it wandered to such trivial things.

This practice was so helpful for me today. This whole month I’ve been in a slump. The summer blues are real right now. Thank you so much for this nourishing and relaxing practice. I get a lot of neck pain so to health issues which leads to my neck and shoulders being tight which leads to my whole body feeling tight. This practice was just enough to help loosen my muscles and ease my mind. As always love you Adriene! 💕,Annika Ewing,2020-07-01T01:06:33Z,0

I was not listening to my body for years and my problems continued to get worse until a couple of days ago when I had to go to the ER due to a panic attack combined with the pain of severe inflammation. I decided to change my lifestyle and refocus my energy on healing internally. I watched one of your videos recently and found this one today. I was not expecting to be so emotional but by the end my entire body felt so relaxed and I felt in control of my pain. i just wanted to thank you so much and share my experience so you can know how much you have helped me.

I just found this channel and it has saved my life. I suffer with chronic pain everyday of the rest of my life. Which has not been easy. Being able to listen to someone who just really gets relaxation and the importance of taking a breath is amazing. My tension was gone. My pain decreased. And you made me feel like I did something right today. I pushed forward and made the decision to do something about it. Hearing someone say they are proud of you for something feels unbelievable. I tried to hold back tears at the end but decided to let it out. Thank you for everything you do for people. &lt;3,shelbs bells,2019-09-11T23:56:17Z,1

I&#39;m truly enjoying your weekly emails and am slowly making my way through your July calendar. An injury had me limited to chair yoga for some time and then I pretty much abandoned practising all together for more than a year. You&#39;re outreach could not have come at a better time!

"Just wanted to say... I&#39;m a few weeks late trying this one because I&#39;ve only been making about 10-15 minutes for yoga most days. I finally carved out the time for this one tonight and it was heavenly. Thank you, Adriene. 🙏<br />That said, Adriene has had a huge impact on my life ever since I first heard her say &quot;A little goes a long way.&quot;  This was a new concept to me, that even if you only put aside a few minutes every day for yoga, it can have a huge rippling effect. I used to be of the mindset that if I can&#39;t do at least 25-30 minutes it&#39;s a waste of time and not worth doing. Adriene made me realize this is wrong and I am so grateful. I guess I just wanted to let people know that yoga can change your life even if you only have a few minutes a day. Even 5 minutes matters. Just remembering to breathe matters! Thank you so much again. Adriene, for all that you do and for being you and leading so many people to a life of healing and hope. Namaste.",Kerry Melanie,2019-07-21T01:57:47Z,85

"Hi Adriene. I’ve been practicing with you for the past six months. I’ve found when I’m sitting in a position (cross legged, blanket underneath or not) my back tends to start hurting about 5 mins in when sitting up straight. I end up continuing the practice either on my back or in this case I leaned forward and put my elbows to the ground and modified the movements. Any tips to help me strengthen my back or for there not to be any pain so quickly?",Jennifer Culin,2019-07-10T00:31:29Z,0

While it helped my body with tension I&#39;ve been holding for a long time but also with depressive feelings I&#39;ve been struggling with. I was crying about family circumstances and this pratice reminded me that I have so much strength even if I havent been feeling like it lately. ☀️ thank you Adriene fornuet another healing and beautiful pratice.",Connor,2019-07-09T22:24:50Z,2

Starting to practice ujjayi breath has been such a game changer for me. I&#39;ve struggled with a lot of panic lately and the first strong physical reaction is the uncontrolled restriction of my breath.

"What a yummy practice this was !<br />I’ve been doing yoga in the morning for the last few months (I used to do it in the evening after work but it was getting too late for dinner afterwards so I’ve switched to mornings) but tonight I’ve decided to do one more video before going to bed (I did one this morning before work). I had forgotten how different morning yoga and evening yoga feel. I wish I had time for both every day !<br />I’m off tomorrow so I had definitely 30 mn to spare before bed tonight and I’m so glad I did. My upper back was so tense the release feels amazing. I’m off to bed now and I know I’m gonna sleep like a baby thanks to you Adriene. Thank you and “Oyasumi” as we say here in Tokyo . Or bonne nuit (I’m French).

When I put my hand out, Flash slid his body right along that outstretched hand, and when I laid down, flop he went next to me—rolling into my side body to make sure I knew he was there, supporting me. A proper cuddling after shivasana lead to side lying (fetal position) in which he tucked  in like a little spoon, purring!! What was that about stress and tension?? I totally forgot!

"What a beautiful practise. I felt like I gave myself a massage both physically and mentally. One thing I did notice and wanted to ask, the movement with the head tilted on the side and then lifted the arm, it made my middle fingers go numb on both sides.

"POWER day 7<br /><br />Thank you Adriene for this profound gentle practice, it puts the body and the nerves at ease. Most of the tension and emotions are stored in the upper back/neck region which tends to be tight as a result, the side neck stretches were POWERFUL and loosens it up a bit.<br /><br />Namaste.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ywaPOWER"">#ywaPOWER</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FWFG"">#FWFG</a>",DAWSAC,2019-07-07T23:29:00Z,0

Adrienne. I really hope your read this message. Thank you for being you. You&#39;re a perfect teacher for me. I have been watching your vids for some time. I used your guidance when I got married in 2014. due to my regular yoga sessions with you I was able to relax and enjoy the day - properly conscious in the moment . I&#39;m getting back into my yoga again now and I can already feel the benefits from just a couple of weeks. I found myself smiling and laughing at nothing earlier. This tends to happen to me after a few weeks on the mat:)  I have told so many people about you and recommended your channel to them but I dont think any of them have given it a go...never mind I&#39;ll continue spreading the word.  ages ago I checked out your site and you had a quote by Carl Jung &#39; Until you make the unconscious conscious it will direct your life and you will call it fate&#39;. This is one of my favourite quotes - not all can understand it sadly but when I read it on your site it struck a cord with me! take care Adriennexx,m4ck m4n,2019-07-07T15:49:00Z,0

"Wow! I just can&#39;t put this feeling I have into words, that is to say it feels amazing knowing that Adriene sensei somehow nails it with a video I need every single time. I can&#39;t thank you enough for being my go to guide, teacher, and friend whom I consider one that listens to me patiently; of course i&#39;m not the only one who feels this way and I know it. My tight back will definitely thank me for this sweet, magical practice. Thank you for being in our lives and impacting them the way you do. Much love.
