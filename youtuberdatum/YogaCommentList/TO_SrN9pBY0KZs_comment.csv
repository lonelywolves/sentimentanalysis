"The &#39;core&#39; is the skeleton; hug all muscles to the bone 360 degrees around -- <br />the trick is, all bones are anchored to  (by some joint or another) the spine, which is highly held up/supported by the abs...<br />Having rock hard abs sucks if your limbs are soft, and having rock hard limbs sucks if your abs are soft. <br />Often, &#39;balance&#39; is viewed linearly on a right/left spectrum, but I&#39;ve found it much more helpful to view it holistically when it comes to &#39;core&#39; work. <br />This sequence is so powerful!

I am 62 and about the tightest person around and I was told by a friend Betsy Markle, my Dragon Boat team mate,  nutritionist, yoga instructor and owner of Sunshine Wellness in Indian Harbor Beach, Fl  to try your videos.  I started out strong with the yoga for beginners and I truly felt so much better!  I fell off my routine and just watched this core strength and can‚Äôt wait to be able to do it, but I know I have to do the basics first again. This week I am in Colorado Springs with my Dragon Boat team, Heart and Soul for the National Championships! My teammates are all above age 50 to 70‚Äôs and have all worked so hard to get us here and I am so proud and honored to be with them and I owe it to them to get my flexibility and core back to Strong Strong and am committing myself to following you at least 3 times a week!  My boat has already qualified for the World Championships in France 2020 and our breast cancer survivor boat needs to qualify this weekend at Nationals!

I&#39;ve done your Dedicate series, the 30-day challenge and now I&#39;m doing the 30-day yoga camp. I just wanted to thank you. I&#39;m doing quite a bit better and you are an excellent instructor for the mind and body. Any suggestions for videos for my particular issue? Mentally, I don&#39;t let the things I can&#39;t change bother me, but my body doesn&#39;t always follow along with what my mind says. First, it was headaches, then sweating, now shaking!

"This one was a bit of a challenge for me in knowing and respecting my own limits. I&#39;m in the middle of moving to a different country, and because of that (the stress but also just carrying a lot of boxes), my old shoulder issues are playing up, which I felt today especially in the second half of this practice. I tend to get really frustrated when I notice the pain and that I&#39;m limited in what my shoulder can do, so today I tried to just pay attention to how strong the rest of my body is and how I can modify my practice to support my shoulders.",Eline Castelijns,2019-08-11T08:40:38Z,38
