"To the yoga community, I&#39;m so glad to be in this journey with you. I now understand why many people are loving yoga. ❤️<br />This is the shortest session so far, but one of the most meaningful sessions I had. Today, I just realized that the gist of my 3 intentions I set for this yoga journey is to drop the emotional and mental baggage that has been with me since last year. This yoga journey that I started 12 days ago was a blessing in disguise as this is the most peaceful state I have been since last year. This is also my first yoga experience, and I’m happy I did it with you, Adrienne.",Faith Gazmin,2021-04-26T00:52:16Z,1

"Great session... at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sTZMSGurlg&amp;t=12m15s"">12:15</a> you say the upper arm bones are externally rotated. What do you actually mean by that? I actually struggle to know what to do with my arms in down dog ie are the elbows locked or slightly bent? Are the palms facing a little outward or forwards? Are the elbows rotated into the body or more outward towards the edge of the mat? Need help :) thx",Andy J,2021-04-22T08:08:03Z,0

I&#39;m doing this challenge in March/April and am not doing it consistently every day but doing it most days. I&#39;m learning to be kind to myself. It&#39;s ok to not do them everyday. Just as and when you can. I hope you can all be kind to yourselves too!,Lisa,2021-04-04T20:29:34Z,11

Day 12: I started this journey on 21 March. I am inspired by all of you lovely people and I got this idea (on day 4) to leave a comment every day after each session. I rarely finish things like this so if I can do it then you can do it. Look for my comment each day and remember you&#39;re not alone. Breathe.,Stefana Lavinia,2021-04-04T11:43:23Z,1
I&#39;m 3 days behind (it&#39;s been 15 days since I started but I&#39;m on day 12) and I&#39;m trying not to let it bother me. I need to remember it&#39;s not about the streak it&#39;s about listening to my body and showing up as much as I can.,Stefana Lavinia,2021-04-04T11:50:00Z,0

I do Spin, walks, &amp; just started Callisthenics in the afternoon, and other body weight stuff during my days, so this weekend I was like REST, please, haha. However, yesterday I did my Yoga and now I&#39;m doing this class. I am so determined to complete this 30day challenge, with the intention of doing Yoga daily. I do BJJ, a martial art, and a lot of practitioners do Yoga. I can see why. The movements in Yoga are similar to what we do in BJJ. I think Yoga could be life-changing for me. Thanks Adriene. Your introduction into Yoga has been enjoyable and mind-opening. I like your energy &amp; spirit :)",Belle Princess,2021-03-14T07:57:48Z,2

Like many others, I was kicking myself for not finishing the 30 days within the 30 days of January, but when I jumped back into practice, it kinda felt like I never left. Today&#39;s practice challenged me a little but I ended up feeling really proud of myself by the end. I can tell that my body is getting stronger and seeing that is motivation to keep going. I didnt really struggle with the yogi drop which shocked me because it was my first time doing it. I still can&#39;t get my feet flat in downward facing dog yet.",Brittany,2021-02-12T16:20:31Z,1

I&#39;m a yogi since 2011 but because of work recently and my yoga studios that I frequented shutting down in 2020 - Covid! :-(  - I am trying to pick back up after a few months of no practice.  Tomorrow is Day 12 without a miss!  I&#39;m really enjoying the program but find the classes too short; I always have to add some of my own vinyasas and asanas at the end to feel justified in logging the activity LOL.  I will have to try some of the other YWA classes later on that are around an hour or so.  It is really fun to refresh the page and take note of all the others around the world who having been doing the same yoga class with you - I wish everyone health and peace!

"The first three days of the practise, my muscles were really sore and I felt exhausted. Now, it&#39;s like I can barely feel a thing when I&#39;m done. I realised I&#39;d gotten used to thinking about pain as evidence of something working, because I was wondering if the workouts had become easier. But they haven&#39;t because it&#39;s still not so easy to drop into some of te poses or follow the transitions or link my breath with my movement the way she dos. I still worry that I&#39;m not getting the poses right. Nothing has changed beyond the absence of muscle soreness. <br /><br />And I simply wonder, in life, do we use pain as a marker for growth? And how do we change our thinking to view only the right metrics as a marker for growth?",Oke Ekpagha,2021-01-23T08:00:24Z,1

Besides the twist on the left and walking back towards the feet, i was able to still do all of it! And it even made me practice dolphin pose instead of downward facing dog, so who knows, there might come something good out of it.😊 Thank you for this drop back in the body 💛",JoyKirsten,2021-01-19T22:52:51Z,0

I was never able to keep the attention on the breath the whole time before,  but now I can! Even when I hear you breathing deeply, in my head I’m like: ‘ already there! ‘ , so cool!

"I overindulged earlier today and was giving myself a lot of grief for doing so. Instead of giving into the negative energy and contributing to that inner conversation, I instead listened to what my body needed in that moment. I drank water, took a rejuvenating nap, and woke up to roll out of bed and do this muuuuch needed practice. A little really does go a long way. Now it&#39;s time to close out and go sweat some of these sins out at the gym! Consistency is key-- thank you for being an anchor for me to keep showing up and move this body and spirit!

"I’ve been practicing on an almost daily basis with YWA since July 2020...while I supremely appreciate the short, playful sessions, her chatter today (Day 12 of new release) was distracting.  She is instructing us to listen to our breathing, to “drop in,” but I found that almost impossible to do today, because I was listening to her instructions.  I know this is beneficial for beginners...maybe it’s time for me to move on?

"This is the second day that I’ve done the practice right before bed.  Both yesterday and today, I found it took a long time to move my brain from the external workings of the day into the “internal” working of my yoga practice.  I got there, it just took longer.  But, and this is huge, I dropped off to sleep last night really quickly!  Hmmmm, I’m saying to myself, perhaps this is the secret to easier sleep.  We shall see.  Namaste Adriene.  Shhhhhhhh.",Quilter Nancy,2021-01-16T03:46:28Z,5

"I am so very happy! For the first time in a very long time (20 years?) I haven&#39;t been able to squat because my knees have been so painful. It used to be one of my favourite ways to &quot;sit&quot; on the floor... and after doing Yoga with Adriene almost every day for almost since we were locked down (in London, England) I felt brave enough to try. And guess what? Yessss: soles on the ground, knees fully bent, chest up, hands pushing in and knees pushed by the elbows. I know it&#39;s not about the shape, and this triumph isn&#39;t about the shape, it&#39;s about really feeling that my body is remembering its youth, and overcoming. I don&#39;t mind getting old, but I do mind the limitations. I think the limitations aren&#39;t as many as we may at first succumb to. Viva la vida (y las rodillas).

In fact for the first time in my life, I actually look forward to this exercise, and that is a complete about turn for me. So thank you SO much Adriene.

"I&#39;m doing Breath along with four friends and family.  We created a little Messenger group so that every day we can report in, encourage one another, and comment on how we found each day of Breath.  It&#39;s been an amazing experience in these isolated times.  While the bigger YWA groups are fine, being accountable to people I already know well is particularly motivating.  Already more than once someone messaged that they were just too tired or stressed to do Breath, and the rest of us encouraged them to the point that they found the time, and then posted that they were so thankful for showing up on the mat!  We get to laugh together, too--when one of us complained about how they kept blowing snot out during alternate nostril breathing, or another about the fact that we can hear your heartbeat through your mike during the quieter parts of the practice :)  This is the next step for me with yoga--one of the friends in this group told me about you at the start of the pandemic, and I&#39;ve been appreciating your approach and your wonderful videos ever since.  Doing Breath live, with others, is helping me get more comfortable, as well as stronger and more flexible, in my own skin and muscle and bone...and spirit!  Thank you for always reminding us to listen to our own bodies and not discouraging us with impossible pretzel goals.

"I am just trying to get into this one today but I am so distracted by my feelings about my body. I am currently isolating with covid. Before xmas I put on some weight. I thought I would do the 30 days of yoga as a mindful way to move my body and hopefully connect with breathing, love for myself and moderate eating etc. So with being isolated and moving less, and having no taste or smell, I feel very depressed. I just sat on the mat and could feel my boobs and belly hanging over and crushing together and I feel so disappointed in myself for letting my body get to this level of discomfort. However, I also know that wellness begins in love. Does anyone else struggle with this? I will just push through it but needed to reach out. I am sitting here just so upset with myself for letting the fat onto my body. With love",Shonet Hockley,2021-01-14T17:24:29Z,0

Day 12 done!!! Yaaaayyy<br /><br />Question for Adriene: do you have bloopers of Benji blocking the camera while you&#39;re recording? He seems to be used to seeing you doing yoga in front of a camera so he&#39;s always chilling at the back 😆,M,2021-01-14T11:20:23Z,0

Thank you. Once more. 911pm day  12. Jan 14. It feels different in the evening than the morning. I will now move knee to center in that lungie twist. Good for me to integrate that into other practices.  I&#39;m always doin&#39; the lungie twist.  ♥️🙃,Caitlin Byrne,2021-01-14T10:15:20Z,0
"Since this series is all about breath, it may be interesting to note that the diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle of inspiration attached to the bottom of the ribs - when you  inhale, the diaphragm actually contracts (not expands) and pushes the abdominal contents down and outward (hence the feeling of expansion). When you exhale, the diaphragm relaxes and the abdomen is naturally drawn inward.",R Al-Mutairi,2021-01-14T09:59:30Z,0

Squats.&quot; &quot;Ugh, my knees are not going to let me do this.&quot; and on...but then during the practice, my thoughts turned into, &quot;Wait, this feels strong.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m totally doing it!&quot; &quot;OMG, my heels are even touching the ground...whaaaaaaaat?!&quot; and &quot;I think I just enjoyed a squat. Who even am I anymore?&quot; Sorry for doubting you, Adriene! (Sorry for doubting you, body of mine!)

The weird small victories of yoga - for the first time ever I just did the transition from 3-legged-dog to low lunge on the left side without having to grab my ankle! I&#39;ve always been able to do it on the right side no problem but that left was just a little bit too stiff. So exciting! :),esmith22015,2021-01-14T01:40:34Z,115

I don&#39;t know what I would have done during that time without having yoga to look forward to every day. I hated yoga prior to this and never thought I&#39;d be able to say that I&#39;ve practiced almost daily for 9 months.

At first I was kind of mad at myself, because I really really wanted to do this properly, but I&#39;m trying to not put myself down so much.

"I came to the mat with such a heavy mood of pure anger and impatientness for no reason and I tried my hardest to just be present and move feeling the beath and movement with having to think too much and just listening to u helped pull me out of that mind set so much, it&#39;s still bugging me a bit but I centered myself through the practice to the point that I can find the ease mist the mental battle so thank u Adriene for another amazing practice much love Namaste 💞❤🙏",Vanessa Morris,2021-01-13T23:39:21Z,0

"Today I had so much going on with the picture of my life and I am very tired. I am also doing this before midnight which makes it harder as I am tired. The practice felt like actually dropping into the conversation with the breath. I felt like she was talking to me sometimes, even mentioning what I might have felt today. Maybe I was already feeling good. I am so happy I did this session. So happy that I continue doing it. Love her.",Pooya Valinataj,2021-01-13T23:06:02Z,0

If anyone else had the misfortune and got sick during this 30days. (like me) Don&#39;t be sad/mad! Listen to your body/mind and just continue this 30days when you are well. Just to uphold the spirit /routine of the daily practice you can still check in with yourself every day and see how you feel and do some of the breath exercises.  Although an awful congested nose might make breath exercises awful.  So I guess even that is optional. Time to exercise our minds while our bodies rest.,Kat,2021-01-13T23:02:22Z,0

"Namaste everybody &amp; thank you, Adrienne!  My thoughts today are around our commitment to practice. Tapas. While the end goal is to have no separation between the yoga mat &amp; the outside world, it is a lofty goal. Still, even 22 minutes counts as practice or 1 conscious breath. Baby steps count, we got this. A beauty of our human condition is the ability to begin again with each breath. Sending love &amp; light",Stacey Carr,2021-01-13T22:54:57Z,1

"Hands on the belly really helps to focus on the belly inflating on the inhale. It is not easy to do what seems counterintuitive.  This practice helped me focus on that.

"I have been struggling so much this past day - ever since the previous session - due to my  inability to &quot;drop it&quot;. I got caught up in anxiety and self-judgement which caused me a lot of stress, lack of sleep, and extreme mental and physical fatigue. I&#39;ve always struggled with self-care and being kind to myself because I tend to judge my mistakes very harshly and my first reaction to any personal failure is to extremely self-deprecate myself (calling myself lazy, stupid, a failure etc). This session was so extremely relevant, timely and on-point! I almost feel like crying a little bit. It was so gentle, sweet, and short which is exactly what my exhausted self needed today. Thank you so much Adrienne. I don&#39;t know how you do this, but what you are doing really helps! &lt;3",Тамара Солтис,2021-01-13T22:44:41Z,1

Ya&#39; Allah - so fine. I&#39;m a swimmer - have been swimming competitively since I was 7 &amp; when a chap was teaching me tummy breathing for stress management it did not come intuitively. I examined how the diaphragm works in breathing &amp; I had to imagine that it going down and pushing my tummy out and the air was sucked down to my belly &amp; I put my hands there to feel them pushed out.

"Yogic Squat Hack! So, I&#39;ve always struggled with yogic squats. I feel like when my heels are on the ground my centre of gravity is a bit behind me, so I end up either having to reach my hands way out in front, or curving my spine to reach my head forward (neither of which feel totally stable, or comfortable). But today I got a little towel and put it under my heels, and BAM! I was balanced, I could lengthen upwards through the spine, and I felt good!

I love this routine; makes me feel time/space open up inside, opening up in my life and I feel softly proud for being so committed.

"This is my sixth year of joining your yoga journey but still there&#39;s days where it feels almost impossible to get on the mat. This was one of those. I felt more dedicated than ever to not miss a single day this year, but I&#39;m so sore from a workout yesterday I can barely walk and tired from a full day of moving around my weary body.<br />I was reading the comments and it reminded me that I can show up just as I am. So I did. This practice was the perfect way to drop into where I was. Tired and in pain. I dropped into what felt good, what was nourishing to my heart and body, I simply showed up and then the rest was so gently guided by Adriene and Benji. Just showing up as I am, today, is always enough. And boy am I grateful I did, and that this is available to us all. 🌱",Joy Aileen,2021-01-13T19:18:47Z,2

"I have been struggling with some internal conflicts recently and I&#39;m currently trying to figure out &#39;me&#39; again. The crazy world that we&#39;re all currently living in right now has stripped back many of life&#39;s luxuries, almost leaving my soul completely naked and exposing me to all things that are not helping me serve my truth in life. Every day I find myself fighting these mental and emotional battles, and yet everyday when I come on the mat, yoga practice with Adriene helps me to clear my mind and brings me back on track. My next goal is learning to take my breathe and practise with me off the mat. <br />Thank you Adriene, you are truly a blessing. Especially in current dark times.<br />And thank you to every single one of you guys too - i often read the comments after I practise and seeing all your stories about overcoming hardship and difficulty with yoga really helps me believe that I will overcome this too.<br />Namaste xx",Melony Costa,2021-01-13T18:53:37Z,0

"This was a good session for me. I had a bad night with my blood sugars, went very high and I’ve been struggling to get them back down today. I’m feeling icky and glad to have a shorter session. I’ve noticed that yoga helps bring them down from time to time. Not only because of the exercise/activity but because I feel relaxed afterwards. Which, I think, helps cleanse the cortisol, a stress hormone which can make the body insulin resistant. So relaxing helps the insulin become more effective. 💛 Cross your fingers for me 🤞",Kelly Pawlusiak,2021-01-13T18:44:27Z,0

Seeing a lot of comments about people feeling down today/needing to really talk themselves into coming to the mat. I am with you too! Very monkey-minded today in the beginning. My emotions are all over the place and it was hard to stay focused at first. Yoga is the one place that helps me feel connected when I&#39;m all over the place. Just want to say love you all and I&#39;m right here with you!

What a solace it is to come here daily and nourish my body and soul. I knew the yoga would be good for me-- I used to practice regularly- but I had no idea this community would be such a comfort. In these dark and troubling times, it&#39;s a joy to read through these comments full of love, gratitude, courage, hope, encouragement and compassion. Communities take their cues from their leaders, and those are the qualities that Adriene radiates. Blessing to Adriene, to Benji, and to all of you.",Kathryn Lodato,2021-01-13T17:41:53Z,0

Have you ever done something that your entire being just goes “omg yes that’s what I wanted”? Hitting the mat was that for my body today. ❤️ <br />I think the mind body connection is really starting to happen for me this week. I’ve been able to realize when I need to make adjustments to protect my knees which I’m sure my body is super grateful for. 😂 <br />I usually like to end my day with yoga but I’m thinking I might give starting my day with it a shot. So I’m going to try to get up with the sun tomorrow. Wish me luck 🤞🧘‍♀️,angela bleibtrey,2021-01-13T17:35:26Z,0

I have practiced with you in that time at least 3 times per day with your calming flows and PTSD. You have healed my nervous system, my spirit and my body.

"🎵 Drop it like it&#39;s hot 🎵 Adriene, have I told you lately how much I loved you? Your practices have this way of always providing me with exactly what I need on that day and in that moment. I arrived on the mat stressed out and tired, after an early start, multiple train and tram journeys, errands, complicated and emotional family situation, etc. but also having looked forward to my Breath practice all day, because I had a feeling it would be particularly helpful today. Well... it was more than that! Your words really hit home and the practice itself made me move my body and nourish my mind in ways that definitely felt good. I also really enjoyed the yogi squat, which was surprisingly natural and almost effortless to me, and a beautiful anti-stress balm for the body and mind. Thank you so much! I hope everyone else enjoyed their day and practice, or at least found a silver lining somewhere. See you all tomorrow!",Marion Carminelitta,2021-01-13T15:57:52Z,0

"I may or may not have fallen out of the squat a fair few times, but instead of getting frustrated, I just giggled and tried again. This is not something I thought I was capable of as huge perfectionist. Glad I was able to enjoy it without feeling down. Pupdate: All calm the whole time! She decided to join us on the mat when doing the squat, sitting in front of me and letting me keep a hand just touching her back at an attempt for some stability. Other hand was on the earth so she was bearing no weight, but it was more of a comforting stability :)",Scarlet Winter,2021-01-13T15:40:14Z,0

I love practicing with Adriene but I cannot stand the way the mic catches her smacking her lips and gulping all the time. It makes me not want to watch the videos at all or just put her on mute. No one else has that problem with mics I watch. And I love these journeys every Jan but I cannot take those sounds!,AWL,2021-01-13T14:30:16Z,0

"Woke up this morning with a bit of a stomachache, and was nervous for today&#39;s session. I often feel like I have to &quot;maximize&quot; my time on the mat, challenging/pushing myself and digging as deeply as I can into every pose and flow. Adriene&#39;s words to &#39;drop what we know about yoga&#39; really helped me take it easy today without feeling like I was being lazy, and made me realize that I can ease up in my practices more generally. It ain&#39;t a test that I&#39;m trying to get a perfect score on, it&#39;s the intention and the time itself that matters most. Namaste &lt;3",Carolyn Kegel,2021-01-13T13:43:44Z,0

I woke up in a difficult mood this morning and wanted to do absolutely nothing but pushed myself to make YWA the first thing I do. I was pessimistic and frustrated for the first few minutes but something shifted during the twists and I found some ease. It wasn&#39;t a miraculous transformation into a positive mood--and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the objective of yoga--but I was so gratified that following through with my daily practice and following Adriene&#39;s guidance today shifted me more than I thought possible half an hour after my cranky wake-up. It reminds me of the practice last week that every breath is a new arrival. I&#39;m feeling very grateful to Adriene and this community.,Erin S,2021-01-13T12:48:07Z,3

"Another tough morning coming to the mat, but I made it. Finishing the practice strong at 7:13am EST. Man, yogic squat is such a challenging pose for me physically (in the sense that I can really feel the stretch deep into my hips) and mentally (holding stretching and focusing on my breath to get me through is quite the challenge). I took it in baby steps today, but I know that if I keep practicing I will get there and make vast improvements! Thank you for the short, sweet, but firey practice today Adriene!

"I missed out on 9 days of this challenge because of my own personal insecurities that I considered a bad start of a new year and wanted to say it’s gonna be a bad year just because these couple of days were not perfect as I imagined. Then I remembered that i don’t have to wait for the new year to become a new me, I can do it anytime and drop in anytime I want to change my life. Yoga alongside dance changed my day and yesterday I made a promise to give myself this time to be vulnerable, to practice with my emotions and feel my body performing what I feel deep inside learning how to be a better version of myself, I wish to transform this year mentally and build a good relationship with myself, build my outer world with my attitude that can change everything. So that I practiced yesterday, did yoga video from day 9 and then I turned out to be on my Matt this morning as well and am already feeling gratefulness for doing this two days in a row. People, be proud of your small accomplishments, do not give up straight away and let yourself find truth inside you. Thank you Adrienne for your guidance and practice.

"Hi community! Dropping here only to say Hi :DD<br /><br />I&#39;m also self-celebrating that today&#39;s my birthday and I&#39;m happy I was already given 22 years of life.<br />It&#39;s definitely not been always easy, as for all of us, but it&#39;s got better since I&#39;ve found a way to be with myself, and that is Adrien and her yoga guidance. <br /><br />I&#39;m so glad I found her channel and that there&#39;s such an amazing community. The comments you leave have been helping me getting back every day during this challenge.<br />I&#39;m super proud of me and also of you. I&#39;m happy that we&#39;re being good humans together ❤️ it gives faith in the future, right?<br /><br />Hugs,<br />Giulia",Giulia Montanari,2021-01-13T10:15:41Z,2

"Today was the hardest day yet for me, not in terms of  the practice being physically challenging, but emotionally. I really didn’t want to come to the mat today, I am feeling all the feelings and spent most of my practice getting distracted and feeling frustrated, but I kept going, I kept trying to arrive at the breath and bring myself back to the present moment. <br /><br />In that dedication I found myself so grateful that even through the hard times I have learnt to show up for myself and within that practice I am forging an even deeper relationship with me. I strive to never abandon myself again, especially when I’m needed most. So I will continue to show up and continue to be here. <br /><br />Thank you for reading yoga family and for being on this journey with me! I hope you have the most magical day and have a wonderful practice. BB x",Benjamin Blak,2021-01-13T09:57:18Z,704

HOWEVER me and downwards facing dog are NOT friends (yet) I get really clammy/ sweaty hands and find my hands always slip around on my Matt making the move that much harder to get in to.

Thank you first and foremost for what you give Adriene. Was wondering how the Adidas brand fits with your ethics. It would appear Adidas is sponsoring your clothing which to me doesn&#39;t fit with the person I see you to be. They have work to do on increasing the wages they provide to their workers and reducing their impact on the environment. Would love to see you explore clothing options with a more ethical company than Adidas.,Sandra Rudge,2021-01-13T09:08:37Z,0

I made it to the mat first thing (UK time!) this morning!

Could not keep up with any of this from day one. Is there a beginners class for someone whose never done yoga with not so great knees?🙄,Li,2021-01-13T07:47:44Z,0
"Hi Li! You could check out her Foundations of Yoga series, in which she goes through individual poses. It&#39;s a great place to start if you are new :) (Some of the poses are more advanced, but you can skip those for now and focus on the basic ones). You could also check out her &quot;Yoga for Beginners&quot;, &quot;Gentle Yoga&quot; and &quot;Yoga Quickies&quot; playlists :) She also has a &quot;Yoga for Sensitive Knees&quot; video, though I remember that being a bit more physically challenging.<br /><br />I remember getting started with shorter videos like &quot;Yoga to Get the Juices Flowing&quot;, &quot;Yoga Boost&quot; and &quot;20 min Bedtime Yoga&quot;, and then gradually moving on to longer and more challenging videos. I also always put a folded towel under my knees and focus on aligning the joints (ankle-knee-hip) to protect my knees.<br /><br />Hope you will find something that you enjoy doing :)",Ginatus,2021-01-13T08:02:25Z,0

Day 12 - Drop done ✅ This practice stirred up emotions for me today... I tuned in to all that Adriene had to say as always but when we brought our hands up to our third eye and she said &quot;May we always see the truth&quot; hands to lips &quot; May we always speak the truth&quot; hands to heart &quot;May we always feel the truth&quot;  it brought tears &amp; I don&#39;t know why?! (Not sad tears though!).  So proud and excited to be sharing this journey with so many. Namaste 😊💕🙏🏻,Daisy Dillon,2021-01-13T07:28:47Z,1
"I&#39;ve done it! I stressed so much about wether to do this before going to work in the office for the first time in a very long time or after work - after work seemed reasonable but if left me feeling uneasy, really wanting to do the yoga. But I was scared it would make my mindset or energy somehow bad (I have a burnout issue so that is always something I need to keep in mind but I also stress unnecessarily much about it xD). But I decided to go with the feeling, learning to trust my intuition more every day. And since it was a slower and gentle video, that fit perfectly. I feel good and at ease now and hope your and my day goes along wonderful, I love you all 😊",MrsFrappucchino,2021-01-13T07:28:37Z,20

"Wim Hof breathwork and cold showers has been brilliant for me. Anxiety almost gone, migraines greatly reduced, brain fog lifting.  Breathwork, meditation and yoga with Adriene are my morning trio.",Kelly HayesCrook,2021-01-13T15:38:06Z,2

"Something super random I&#39;ve discovered in dropping into my truest self through yoga is that I hold a lot of my anxiety and tension in my neck...so much so that when I&#39;m super stressed I literally cannot burp! It&#39;s often very uncomfortable and painful as I just can&#39;t let go! During these yoga sessions, well...let&#39;s just say I burp a LOT hehe but seriously, it&#39;s amazing how good I feel and how when Adriene says &quot;...beautiful&quot; after certain poses I often chuckle as it seems like a response to my massive burp!! :P",Rachel Hinkley,2021-01-13T06:34:17Z,0
Sometimes I&#39;m pushing myself to do the best in everything without even realizing it just because of the expectations that also pull me through deep stress. I think that&#39;s why I felt more relaxed and easy with today&#39;s practice than the others. Lots of love from London. ❤️,Gizem Kayan,2021-01-13T06:33:57Z,0

"Wow!!! I could actually do the more advanced option on this practise lol not by forcing my body into it but because my body actually chose it, apart from making my legs press back into my arms.. that was definitely forced :D I&#39;m slowly learning which poses come naturally and which I really need to work on like the low boat lol that dang boat :D",Aquarius Macpherson Heta,2021-01-13T06:29:16Z,0

"i&#39;ll be honest i struggled at beginning, i had a few uni papers due at start of year so missed a few days, but adriene keeps saying the most important part is showing up and commiting and i really am commited. i got a really nice comment last week from someone encouraging me and after my papers were over i got back to it and there&#39;s been two days where i felt it right to do two videos at once and it&#39;s now 6am and i&#39;m back on the right day. ready, commited, had a takeaway treat last night and this making me feel fresh again. support each other and keep going everyone. thank you everyone, thank you adriene x :)",ken,2021-01-13T06:08:21Z,258
