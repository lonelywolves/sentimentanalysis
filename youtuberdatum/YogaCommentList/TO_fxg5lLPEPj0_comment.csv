"This practice was one of my favorites of this series. It really connected with me today.For a while now I&#39;ve been on my awakening journey and for the past few months I have been self learning about water and how it is connected to us, I have it all confirmed for me while listening to tao te ching. It makes mention of so many water qoutes and how it is used as a perfect alogory.<br />Yesterday i was auto playing Alan watts and i heard him speaking of the breath of the ocean and then he did it for a while. I was hardly paying attention but just enough to remember it, today of all days I do this practice and low and behold there it is again. <br />Everything is connected up in my so perfectly. <br />&quot;You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop&quot; ~Rumi. <br />Thank you so much for being a part of my journey. I absolutely recognize myself in you. We are one.",justine Hampton,2020-06-19T20:22:33Z,2

"Not a negative critique (and maybe it was just me) but the cues and flow of this particular practice seemed to be a bit sporadic to me - anyone else?

What would&#39;ve been day 19, I had sunburn from a day of fishing, so I went to bed early (I usually do yoga before bed time 😊) but, I reminded myself of what you said in day 17 I believe... Whether you do 30 days of yoga in 30 days, or in 365 days, is still worth it (or something like that) really left an impression on me! I&#39;m still dedicated! And that&#39;s all that matters!

"You have always told us to &quot;Find What Feels Good&quot; and although I thought that was a good piece of advice, now I&#39;ve discovered I&#39;d never listened to it carefully. I mean, yesterday I was feeling encouraged and did yoga by myself, but I endend up a little bit physically hurt. So I realized that I was looking to doing it perfect, to do yoga right, as those people I watch in social media. However, today (I did it), and in the coming days, I&#39;m fully going to listen to that &quot;Fing What Feels Good&quot;. Thank you Adriene. Namaste.",Paula,2019-05-19T08:12:56Z,0

Day 19 “in the books” ... so close to 30. I like how some chill easy flows are incorporated throughout Dedicate. I felt like the movements here went very well with the “Listen” title because when we truly listen we usually don’t have intense or quick movements ... just smooth flowing.,Zeynabu - Le'Von,2019-03-27T03:48:19Z,0

"I ended this tonight! I had a tough day and at the end of practice you said to surrender and that’s exactly what I did. I know I can’t control everything, so I have to surrender to that and strive to control my reaction to things not always being on a high note. That’s life and we’re here to learn the best way to navigate this thing. Earlier today I told myself that all I need is yoga, bob marley music, and my family to be alright. <br /><br />Also! I never thought of my breath as my soul before, but to me it makes sense since we’re literally hearing one part of what animates us (the other being the heart). Beautiful imagery and I’ll have to ponder that during tonight’s full moon. Love to you all! Namaste 🙏🏾",AK B,2019-01-21T05:01:26Z,0

"Wow! I reached a point of total change today. A shift. In my consciousness, yes, and my body. I fell into a little bit of panic thinking - &quot;trapped&quot; was the word that came to mind and my body fell into that word like a hole opened up and swallowed it. And then I stuck with the breath. I kept going. I found little places where I didn&#39;t feel so caught up, where the claustrophobic thoughts could wander a little further until that pose felt like a hug instead of a strangulation.

"Day 19 was beautiful practice to sustain my growth. Before this practice, I decided to do weights for the first time in years. I exercised my biceps, and hamstrings to counter the quads and triceps that I tend to work out when pushing out on the mat. It has been years since I did weights. When I use to do weights, I was never mindful and would not breathe properly. I did 20 minutes and focused on my breathe and was mindful of the practice. Then I did this practice and it was serene. Time flew. That was an easy 40 minutes that I spent working on my body and reconnecting with myself. Namaste y&#39;all!",Terence,2019-01-20T19:19:59Z,0

"Your yoga is syncing so perfectly with my workouts at the moment. I loved that we connected with our breath in such a different way today, envisaging it as our soul or spirit. So beautiful. Thank you for opening up our eyes to so many different ways of looking at our lives through yoga. Namaste xo",Madeline Prusmann,2019-01-20T14:23:24Z,1
"Wow to learn new things about myself today was eye opening. In the beginning my try at the breath sounded like growling, or maybe snoring. Then it/I calmed to like a wave sound. And in the childs pose I noticed like a whimpering. So nice to give up control and just trust. Thank you all for practicing with me &lt;3",Kara Quartz,2019-01-20T14:18:05Z,0

"What a great way to start the day. Many thanks. Yes, yoga connects us to our best selves and it’s great to share that with others in a similar place. Too true that the right and left are different! Doing this challenge I see how much in myself! My left hip pops and my right is so much tighter, but I’m loving them both. Best wishes to all.",Sami Ansley,2019-01-20T13:52:53Z,0
"Adriene—this is one of the best practices I have done. No joke. I used to teach Yin Yoga. Dragon/Lizard is not an easy pose, and it took me years to appreciate the benefits. Combining it with an almost foolproof way to use the Ughi (sp) breath is so good. I plan to share this with others. Even if they don’t want to do the 30 days of Dedicate, I would like them to see this. Thank  you for your generosity and your great yoga teaching.",SpeedofLight1,2019-01-20T13:48:52Z,7

"Good Sunday morning, amiguita. I read in your letter that you continue with your focus on language — learning Spanish, I imagine. My little bit of advise is this: listen to the music of the spoken word. Every language has its own tonality, range and rhythm. If you get the music, you get the language. Pues escucha el canto de la voz y verás lo fácil que son las palabras. Un abrazo. ❤️",Raechel McGhee,2019-01-20T13:20:38Z,0

"I really enjoyed today’s practice using the Ujjayi breath throughout. I love this breathing technique which I often use because it gives me such perfect control over my exhale, especially when we count 6 or 8 in and 8 or 10 out, such amazing effect. This variation on the Lizard Pose today was SO good, when we’d finished I wanted to do it again .... what an awesome stretch that was with knee raised and with my Ujjayi breath ... total benefit 👍🏻 ? Super yummy ! I shall return to this practice often. See you tomorrow for Day 20 ‘Lead’  🧘🏼‍♀️🧘🏻‍♀️🙏💞",Gill Smith,2019-01-20T09:06:17Z,1

hey there! this is my first 30 day challenge and me and my boyfriend ( who was sooo hesitant at first but has since been SO STOKED on it) have been doing the 30 day challenge for the first time we feel great. i know you are always looking for different practices to develop. i was wondering if you could maybe do a yoga for body dysmorphia. i have trouble looking at myself while i do my practice and have struggled with that for a long long time. thank you for everything!!!!,Taylor Bour,2019-01-20T08:23:03Z,0

"We&#39;re on it people. Day 19 is in the book. How amazing it felt today to smoothly flow through the poses and learning to listen along the way, to Adriene&#39;s surprisingly calming voice of guidence, as well as the sound of my own breath. So proud of myself to have done this with no struggle whatsoever compared to when i first started this challenge. I&#39;m now adopting the skill of keeping an open mind and listening to people from every background/ field with different opinions to expand my knowledge and thrive towards a bright future. Morning yoga routine complete; way to commit to 2/3 of the challenge everyone. Only 10 days left to go. We&#39;re getting there so don&#39;t give up. Much love. Peace",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-01-20T06:42:22Z,163
