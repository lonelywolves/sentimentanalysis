"Connecting to your breath can be as simple as tuning in to listen to the sound of the breath, to anchor a busy mind. <br />It can be about getting still and noticing the quality of your breath in the moment. <br />It can also be an opportunity to connect to something bigger, much larger than your brain or body, but perhaps a reflection of an energy, or a greater spirit.<br />May you enjoy connecting the dots of each present moment today in practice… via your breath.",Yoga With Adriene,2021-01-11T14:40:43Z,609

Day 10: I started this journey on 21 March. I am inspired by all of you lovely people and I got this idea (on day 4) to leave a comment every day after each session.

"This is my favorite practice so far in the Breath journey. I am working through it slowly at my own pace, not every day but still going in order as I feel up for it. I loved opening in child&#39;s pose, the variation between stretching up in the beginning, strength in the legs in the middle, and balance at the end. I felt overall more open and connected, both physically and mentally, by the end of this practice. Thank you Adriene :)",Abby,2021-02-14T01:20:06Z,1

"&quot;Falling wit grace&quot; this definitely hit me deep today. I accidentally ran over a kid yesterday at the elementary school of the kids I au pair for. I don&#39;t remember everything but I had checked if there was anyone on the pedestrian&#39;s cross walk and there was nobody so I kept on going and as I looked back from the right (to check if there was someone coming from that direction) the kid was already on my car and I immediately hit the breaks but the poor kid went flying. The other side of the road was basically a traffic line of cars wanting to leave the school area and this kid had just assumed it was safe so be just ran through the cars and across the street. We both didn&#39;t see each other but he has a broken leg now and needed stitches on his forehead and jaw (as I was informed later). He is otherwise doing well and will recover well based on what I was told as well. I am so glad and relieved that he will be fine. This definitely has taken a toll on me too, mentally of course, I am not physically hurt. My mind keeps wandering back to that awful moment when the kid was practically already lying on my car and then being catapulted through the air. Horrible, horrible, horrible. It sends a shiver through my body every time but of course this situation is mostly about the boy. I&#39;ll have to see what happens next (lawyers, police, etc.). It depends also on the parents of the boy but I have told myself that I will accept what will come my way and take this as a learning opportunity to do better in the future (aka learning to fall with grace). I should have driven even slower knowing that kids roam the area but I can also accept that it was also a huge amount of bad luck on my part, if he had arrived 5 seconds earlier or later, he would have collided with the cars in front or behind me (not that then I wouldn&#39;t have minded obviously). It is human to doubt our behavior excessively but there is always the component of luck or bad luck when we drive. I would be lying if I said I was fine because it is still difficult to deal with, especially when I have to go back to school today and every other week day to pick up the girls, knowing that pretty much the entire school saw it but I have told myself that I won&#39;t hide myself away and if anyone wants to stare or ask questions then I will face this head on. We gotta keep pushing through the fire.<br /><br />Thank you so much Adriene, for these videos. Yoga is helping me a lot mentally, especially now in this situation. And to anyone who might read this: please be careful when you drive and if you are running late then so be it. Don&#39;t rush and take those extra minutes to drive safely. For your and everyone&#39;s safety. Life can change so quickly from a normal routine day to the most horrible thing and afterwards we regret it. Take that extra look and slow down even more. Please all be safe!",Julib Tulip,2021-02-02T12:07:13Z,0

Thank you for making your gift available to us all. I so look forward to the thirty minutes I carve out for myself at the end of my day because your voice and your spirit are like a balm to my oft frazzled soul. And when you broke out in Boot Scootin&#39; Boogie I found myself grinning like an idiot because it connected me to my youth when my family was learning how to line dance. Great memories!,Janelle Smith,2021-01-16T03:29:11Z,1
"Even though I don’t always make every day’s  practice, I pick up from I left off the next day. I appreciate the many shorter workouts as I usually end doing it between 9 and 10 p.m.  they make me feel good, relaxed and focused. What would I be without this yoga program. Benji, your constant presence is a reminder that if you can show up, so can I!  😀",Diane Tanski,2021-01-16T03:15:11Z,0

But I know I wouldn&#39;t be able to after work so I decided to show up and do my best. This was everything I needed to reset and feel refreshed.

"I love you Adriene so much!  You have brought so much to my life these past 5 months. I have so many loving thoughts about you, and what you are sharing with the world, and yoga.  I have so much respect and admiration for you! <br /> I want to share a thought, a small suggestion that comes as a gentle request. Today during the tree pose, I found myself a bit distracted by your talking.  And I know that you are only trying to encourage and instruct everyone with the love and attention you do each day.  But I wonder if perhaps cultivating silence, once everyone is in the pose, might help everyone to help keep their pose.  I know we all must find balance, even during distraction, perhaps especially in distraction. This is just a simple thought I hope you might consider.  But again, I send this wrapped with so much love and respect for you.  These past 5 months and committing to the practice has had enormous impact on my life.  So I bow to you. With love, Namaste.

"I&#39;m a couple of days behind on Breath, but felt like I needed to share something today... I&#39;ve been practicing yoga nearly every day since last March when the UK went into lockdown. I started with the original 30 days and have been following Adriene&#39;s monthly calendars since. Today was the first day I genuinely felt like I could hold a downward facing dog properly, due to wrist pain and chronic issues with my hamstrings and calves (thanks to an old roller derby injury and metalwork in my ankle). It seems like such a small thing, but I feel quite emotional about it. Thank you Adriene!

"Commenting for accountability Day 10: Catching up, did this practice right before Day 11 with a friend over FaceTime. It was nice, very grounding, not too intense, so it functioned as a great warm-up combo with Day 11. Want to mark this practice as something to come back to specifically to ground myself and reconnect to stability. The tree pose was challenging, more so on the left than the right, but I mainly felt grateful for the opportunity to work on my balance/bring both sides of my body into alignment, since I’ve struggled with left/right side differences since my concussion two summers ago.",Grackle Mac,2021-01-12T20:54:43Z,0

"Day 10:<br /><br />I&#39;m absolutely trying to push myself to write the little check-in reports on GOOD yoga days too (because if I&#39;m going to write big long self-analysis essays to figure out my own reactions on bad days, I deserve to feel good on the days when yoga feels good.)  Today was a good yoga day!  Why is is so much harder to figure out what to say for that?<br /><br />Okay, a concrete success: I am getting better at downward-facing dog.  I&#39;ve never felt good about my downdog.  I&#39;ve always felt a little unbalanced, and a lot like I&#39;m pouring too much weight into my shoulders.  Today it felt okay!  Today it almost felt GOOD.  My hips were high!  I had good weight distribution!  I wasn&#39;t resting my whole body on my wrists and sagging into my shoulders!  It sure the heck wasn&#39;t perfect, and lord knows my heels will be sky-high on my downdog for as long as I can still bend into one, but it didn&#39;t feel weird and off and obligatory today, and that is WORTH CELEBRATING.<br /><br />And actually, extended child&#39;s pose didn&#39;t suck today either.  I think I&#39;m finally getting the hang of it.  (Why is it that the low lunges and warriors and twists and even cobra always feel right-if-hard, and the &quot;resting&quot; poses are the ones that always feel off?)  Go me.

I’ve really been loving this series. I’m a day behind so it’s day 10 for me today and I don’t think I’ve ever done anything everyday for 10 days.

I was able to do modifications today without as much struggle, being more mindful of my breath, my lower energy level and tendinitis in both arms that need TLC. I caught myself once, wishfully trying to do more than my body wished to... I stumbled and accidentally spilled my water from my tea cup, on my yoga blanket. I see that as symbolic. Aa I feel like accidents happen, when I am not being mindful of my breath, body and self care. This practise was wonderful, as I was able to gently strengthen my body, as well as my sense of peace and spiritual self acceptance.

"I almost didn&#39;t show up today because I had a terrible day. But, I noticed, my mood was high, despite feeling low altogether. This made me realize how daily yoga has greatly influenced my mindset. I allowed myself to experience my emotions without any hesitation. Yoga has allowed me to absorb my (very sensitive) feelings, and understand them. I don&#39;t expect to experience gratefulness and have a healthy mindset daily, but the idea that I could maintain the feeling of balance while I was on a rocky road is something I really appreciate.

Adriene! Thank you so much for BREATH and for this practice! I’m a freshman in college and classes started today. I changed my major to something way different and extremely difficult. I had a hard day of crying and doubting myself. I was going to skip this video. But it was 11 pm and I felt like i deserved to show myself some love. This practice made me smile and laugh for the first time today! And reminded me that school and my grades aren’t everything and that I’ll be okay &lt;3,Harsitha Kalaiarasan,2021-01-12T05:30:11Z,0

This physical and mental practice of yoga is highly respected and considered very spiritual in my country which also happens to be the country of  origin.  Will appreciate it if we can take that into this and any yoga journey.  Anything contrary to this is highly disrespectful to our Indian culture and heritage.    Unrelated singing and conversations would disconnect the mind from body concentration. Appreciate if we can all withhold that respect to the practice of Yoga.  Otherwise its good to be on the mat with you.  Thankyou,Bettina Benjamin,2021-01-12T00:08:09Z,0

"I really felt the difference between practicing in the morning or the evening. Today I completed the practice in the evening and could not find a steady breath. But I laughed heartily when you started singing and my internet died during the forward fold at the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upiiNyibfF0&amp;t=4m50s"">4:50</a> minute mark and I was just hanging there, waiting, enjoying while petting my cats that walked past. For about 2 minutes until I wondered why the forward fold was so long and Adriene wasn’t saying anything.

"I love the kind and embracing manner of Adriene&#39;s yoga videos. She is teaching and guiding well but unlike the other yoga teachers, she is not showing off her flexible body and not making us feel bad about not being that flexible and not being able to do the poses completely perfect. Her warmth and &quot;whatever you do, its okay&quot; feeling she radiates makes us feel interconnected. Thank you Adriene &lt;3",Ahenk,2021-01-11T20:01:35Z,242

"Thank you once again for a great practice. I had to stop my practice a few years ago due to a broken wrist and then problems for a couple of years which made vinyasa or hathha difficult, so I just quit. Now my wrist is better and I felt so bad not being able to step back into my old practice. I feel like these 30 days are going to help me get back into a routine and I can build up into a practice I want without judging myself. Also the thought of energy up the front body and down the back during tree pose was really helpful. So thank you, Adriene.",Taste Georgia,2021-01-11T17:39:19Z,0

So here I pause to reopen my air ways. <br /><br />After practice now and I have to say, it feels like I&#39;m doing yoga with a friend, not a &quot;TEACHER&quot; with all your little interruptions and songs and I love it! 2 more things: 1) I always feel goofy, goofy and anxious are my default states.

I have felt so tired the last few days so I am hoping this helps!

"I am a teacher and it has been rough this past year. I am actually using some of the practices in this 30 day session to help me through the more stressful moments of  my virtual days. And last night, while doing Day 9 (which I did not do very well, but at least came to the mat) I found myself subconsciously envisioning waves as I took my breaths. Not consciously!

I’ve been disappointed in my balance. Last night when cooking dinner I tried a pose I tanked on yesterday and had no problem. When we started balancing today I moved from the extra padded carpet in my living room to the tile in my dining room. That was the ticket!

I live in Bucks County,PA so there are a lot of old barns here. What I mean to say is that I have been getting away with this all my life - pretty enough, thin enough, authentic enough.. with compensation to allow me to keep going. <br /><br />And now, I have stopped and looked at the bad patch jobs, if you know what I mean. And now, Adriene, thank you for offering this tool you have learned to help me restore my mind, body, soul back it its original self - if you know what I mean.",Corie Feiner,2021-01-11T14:27:41Z,0

Each and every practice is unique and special on its own... 10 days flew by fast but with the lovely remembrance of the breath as an anchor...

I really connected with what Adriene said about when she feels drained. About how sometimes she needs to rest and sometimes she just needs to reconnect with her body.

It was a wonderful reminder that each of us is beautiful and capable and that I am beautiful and capable. I am so happy to be here to discover more about myself and to sync my breath and intentions. Today was a bit of a challenge to stay in tune with my breath and let my breath guide me. I had to consistently remind myself to breathe and move with my breath. At first I was feeling frustrated with it but then I realized without struggle you don&#39;t get stronger. So today I was able to not only strengthen my image of myself but also my ability to move with my breath. Thank  you Adriene!",Melanie H,2021-01-11T13:20:18Z,89

Amazing session!<br />I thank you for helping us acknowledge that we find ourselves in balanced days but also imbalanced at times too (which is what I feel like since the end of week 1) ... <br />But showing up day by day yoga with you helps me get out of my head more gently and reconnect to the sense of what it&#39;s like to feel great ( funny thing is that today I actually felt so tall standing on the mat because I saw you as a tiny You on my phone screen in front of me haha),Suraschai Amphonephong,2021-01-11T07:18:38Z,0
