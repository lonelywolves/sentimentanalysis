It has benefited them and we have laughed more often than not. We would LOVE you to make more videos that are 7 - 14 minutes long.

"It’s now the second day in a row I did this Yoga Video as my morning routine. I am trying to get into a healthy habit together with a friend and even so I felt like not wanting to do anything at all, because of being a person with an uterus can make life hard some days. But I still did it and I feel so much better today. Thank you for your videos. I love your way of explaining and also the way that this is for my opinion really beginner friendly. <br /><br />It’s not to fast not to slow, or makes me feel like: what did she do , I need to google the names first to understand. <br />That I really like about your videos in general. In the morning I don’t want to exercise like I am running for my life, like some “beginner” videos do. I want to start slow and wake up slowly enjoy the morning. I will be looking forward for more videos I can try out 🥰",AkiraFireAngel,2021-04-10T08:43:20Z,1

First time doing my own thang half way through the video. I learnt today that human wrists are quit weak, ordered WAGs gloves seeing someone using them to elevate the wrists. Going to give the Downward Dog some sleep for a while. Time to focus on legs. Very interesting learning curve. Feeling damn strong though.

This year has started out very challenging. I had to put my pupper down in Jan. At the end of January I went out to my folks in Arizona to help with postop care for my dad he contracted Covid while in the hospital brought it home to me and mom I was OK mom and dad went back into the hospital two days apart and 10 days later they died seven hours apart from each other 😞 they are true soulmates. I’m finally back home after six weeks of being there clearing out their house and I now have a new pupper an 11-year-old Afghan who’s poor world has been turned upside down and today I decided that I had to get back into my yoga practice ❤️ Much love to all of you ❤️,SOMEBROAD1 Limited,2021-03-17T15:06:58Z,0

"Well, where to start. I&#39;ve been doing yoga every day since Breath and I was devastated to have to stop for even a few days because of a knee injury. Yoga is such a constant in my life and I felt adrift without it but it was so painful I had to rest for a few days and this was just the perfect practice to come back with! I remember doing it once before when it first came out but not since then so it was an exciting reintroduction into Move. A part of me wants to go back to the 5 days or so that I missed of Move and do them but I think just Moving forward and starting renewed is probably less straining. Long ramble to say thank you Adriene and have a good day all my Move calendar people!",Ashby,2021-03-17T07:54:33Z,0

"Good day everyone. Breathe, Move....<br /><br />Somewhat gentle practice today, although I have to admit when I turned my windshield wipers on, I found them to be a bit like those on some twenty year old cars. The wiper arm (in this case, the leg) just made it about 80 degrees. Both sides. At least it is not raining inside my apartment. As for the paint brush, on my side facing the video, no problems. On the reverse, well, I tend to get paint all over myself.<br /><br />How was today&#39;s practice for you? 🤔<br /><br />Move day 17. Day 164 in a row.",William B,2021-03-17T04:09:21Z,5

What I really like about saving the playlist is I can scroll and find a practice that is the length that I&#39;m able to do in the morning. Because Saturday&#39;s practice is like 40 minutes and I didn&#39;t have 40 minutes this morning. And I always do this first thing in the morning. But the 17 minute one that I just did is perfect. Because breakfast is almost done in the oven and so now I can go finish up breakfast. So love being given the entire month&#39;s playlist at once so I can really practice how I need to practice!!!,Jackie Budde,2021-03-06T13:11:11Z,0

We have been doing a video a day for the past 6 weeks!

Your wisdom and love touches me on and off the mat and I just want you to know everything you&#39;re doing is incredibly profound. In the least creepy way possible, I consider you a close friend. If you ever get discouraged or feel alone, think of all the friends like me you have and you&#39;ve never even met.

"Dear Adriene,<br />I have been experiencing some seasonal depression. It always happens this time of year. I’ve done a lot of self deprecation, and in turn, have been very hateful towards everyone around me. Even strangers. I absolutely hate it because I know it’s not like me to do that. I chose this practice randomly, maybe it was divine intention, but it touched my healed my soul in a way I didn’t know could be healed. When we bowed our heads and said namaste, I instantly started crying like a baby. I allowed myself to cry, and felt a huge weight lifted off my shoulders in the process. Thank you for showing my soul the light again. 💜",Jaime Pagano,2019-11-20T15:36:47Z,1

"I pulled up Yoga with Adriene and was planning on doing a longer practice, but my four year old demanded I do the rainbow one. She only did a little with me, but she likes to pretend to talk to you. Today she kept telling you that she’d like to visit your house some time. I tried to explain that you kindly let us into your house whenever we want because of all your yoga videos. She didn’t like that answer.🤣<br /><br />She said she’s a rainbow butterfly because that’s my favorite color (she’s a pink fiend herself so that was generous of her). I’d probably be a rainbow butterfly myself, so we’re twins. Love this practice and would do a longer version of it all the time!! <br /><br />🌈 🦋 From one outside the box to another, thanks for being so quirky and fun, Adriene.",Elise Barker,2019-03-25T17:50:01Z,1

"Funny story. Just before rainbow yoga I did day 17 of Revolution. But I craved a little more, thinking that a few more different poses will add beautifully to my day.

"I was talking to my mom a few weeks ago about you, Adriene. We were looking back on how long I had been following you. We think I had been following you since around 2014. In 2015 you traveled all the way to Asia with me and were a part of my mornings and in Africa I woke up to the sun rising over the ocean with your videos. At the start of 2016 I unexpectedly had to return home and again found comfort in joining you each morning. Last year I was blessed with a wonderful classroom teaching 2 and 3 year olds and we often use things I&#39;ve learned from you to &quot;calm our bodies&quot; when we are feeling crazier then normal. So, today I write you from the end of a long day in the RAINBOW room where I teach. Your videos have always been the right thing at the right time for me :)<br /><br />p.s I would be an orange and brown butterfly!",Bethany Wright,2019-03-19T01:43:45Z,223

Thank you. And I thought about what color butterfly I’d be and my initial response was one of those bold light, almost iridescent ones, and then my sensibility took over and thought I should be a dull moth so I could blend in.  But as I thought about it I decided blue it is!  Thanks for bringing the playful side to yoga. Oh and tight hips here  in Michigan will be doing this one regularly.

"I love how your calendar practices usually align exactly with how I&#39;m feeling. Today is the 1 year anniversary of my 15 year old dog, Butterfly, passing. I&#39;ve had her since I was 11 yo and she has always loved joining me on my mat as I practice your videos. I have so many fond memories and photos of her making herself comfortable in my practice. This marks the first year practicing without her and I cannot believe how perfect this video is to celebrate her life. As an 11 yo, I thought Butterfly was the perfect name for the perfect little puppy. She was my unique unicorn of a pup and always bringing rainbows to my cloudy skies whenever needed. If she were an actual butterfly, I think she would be a tiger butterfly or monarch, one with a lot of orange, black, and white. Today, I feel I would be the same as her but I think everyday is different and every step in life is changing what type I am.  I just want to say thank you for making this day easier. THank you for having Benji in your videos as you practice. I have been on this Earth longer with her than without her and I&#39;m still navigating the obstacles of grief but your videos have definitely helped create a bond with my pup as well as yoga that I wholeheartedly appreciate and will never forget.

If I was a butterfly I would be the colors Blue and Gold. Why?!?

"This was just what I needed! Been really down for about a week with health concerns, my thoughts spiraling down to my lowest of lows.  This morning upon awakening my back was hurting and I thought &quot;I need some yoga!&quot; (I&#39;ve neglected to practice regularly for a couple of weeks...) I found the &quot;Rainbow Yoga&quot; email and thought, &quot;I wonder what Adriene has up her sleeve on this one?&quot; It was perfect! I loved your colorful garb, the flowers, Benji&#39;s curiosity about what was outside the window, and the simple but profound practice of envisioning and painting rainbow colors all around me.  Love love love it!! I will definitely be coming back to this again.  My butterfly was periwinkle blue, coral, yellow and lavender, maybe inspired by your socks, haha! &lt;3 Thanks, I feel so much better.",Dawn D,2019-03-18T15:33:43Z,1

"Thank you so much for your time and energy and experience and love, Adriene! 💖 Found your channel last year, after several failed attempts to take up various physical activities for my health (especially mental)... and almost instantly managed to get into a near daily practice. Came at a time when I really, really needed it too, and has really helped me so, so, SO much. Fell out of practice for a few months because of some unfortunate/unforseen events, but I&#39;ve been at it again for the last week or so, and already starting to feel it. It helps so much. YOU help so much! My anxiety, especially is, like... once I&#39;d been practicing for a month or two, I started to wonder if I had actually ever been anxious in the first place, because I almost stopped being anxious altogether, despite going through some incredibly anxiety inducing times! I can&#39;t thank you enough. I really can&#39;t. Keep trying to gently pester everyone I know into taking yoga up too, now so they can feel this awesome too ahaha. Thank you so much! 💖<br /><br />Also, I reckon I&#39;d probably be some kind of baby blue butterfly. What about you?",Adorkasaurus Rex,2019-03-17T23:35:16Z,1

Hi Adrienne :)  What a lovely class!  I will definitely be coming back to this to work the hips.  Wow!  I had no idea how tight they were.  I want to tell you that I finally got the weight out of the wrists and and started pressing into the palms.  That makes such a huge difference and also really strengthens the arms.

Great video!  Was wondering if u could do one for hip (trochanteric) bursitis?  I’m trying to figure out a routine to alleviate the pain but haven’t found a good yoga video so far.  I’m learning that this condition has a 15 percent prevalence in women and that it is caused by an imbalance of muscles and tendons in the hip.  Would appreciate any advice you could give in lieu of a video.  Thanks!!  &lt;3,Elizabeth Engel,2019-03-17T22:52:00Z,0

About a year ago when I was just finding yoga I would have been a brown moth hiding in the dark searching for the light. Now I’m a shy periwinkle blue butterfly enjoying the warmth of the sun.

"Good Morning and wonderful to be able to sort of getting back into the swing of things.  I am still recovering from abdominal surgery and healing well.  This was a wonderful stretch and I had to definitely stretch very carefully and although it was painful to do the open your heart posture and cobra posture and I had to immediately abandon those two, the strumming of the guitar, windshield wiper legs, and butterfly felt amazing to do.  I actually started to do this Yoga After Abdominal Surgery by another yogi on Youtube, found it while searching which is one seated and if there is something that you offer that can be of ease, can you please direct me to those particular ones.  I notice any stretching of the stomach area particularly by my navel is most painful right now, that is the largest incision was made.  Other than that I am really happy and grateful to God that I am on a path to wellness once more.  Jai Namaste lovely Adriene and I have missed you, my friend.  I am a gold butterfly. 🙏🏽😘💖🤗",galukya1,2019-03-17T17:38:42Z,0

"Hi Adriene! This was a nice one. 🌈❤️ I felt happiness while doing it.<br />It’s funny. I have become somewhat obsessed with rainbows recently. Reason is because during Dedicate I realized one day my solar plexus was talking to me. So besides following you with yoga, I began using sound therapy for balancing my chakras along with tapping working from the root and up. One night while listening to an hour and ten minute track for balancing chakras with my eyes closed, as soon as I reached between the third eye and crown, rainbows began just showing up. I had a excited/panicky/blissful feeling. Since then I see rainbows 🌈 every time I close my eyes, and more during yoga, sound therapy and tapping. That is when I see bursts of color too. It’s crazy, RIGHT!? 🌈🌈🌈 I can’t say it is a bad thing.",Leah Kelley,2019-03-17T12:48:40Z,0

"As usual, superb! This one was VERY SPECIAL though. Sharing with my Tickety-Boo Yoga Tribe, and i think this is great for ALL ages, including the kids. I&#39;m working through Dedicate now, but I have a lot of mature peeps in my Gang, and so I really appreciate the ones you do for seniors, beginners, and LOVE the wheelchair/seated yoga, as i do have Members in wheelchairs. I&#39;m pretty psychic, and I getting a Vibe that you will be doing Yoga pregnancy classes in near future, maybe a Bubba&#39;s on way to you, or someone very close to you... I hope it&#39;s You, if that&#39;s what u want of course. My friend, who I just reintroduced to Yoga, started with the Seniors one of yours, and then we tried someone else&#39;s class, even though I usually only ever do you-TBH. Luckily, I was with him, as he she didnt talk about breathe or guide as masterfully as U do, and I had to keep giving him the breathing, and tips like turning elbows or grounding through feet. He&#39;s hooked on you too now! We all are. Our Tribe is built around your teachings! <br /><br /><br />For YEARS I thought u were an Aussie! I think it&#39;s because you so down-to-earth, so REAL, and so damn FUNNY. There&#39;s no-one like you, I have never laughed and giggled during Yoga before you, and I find myself laughing to myself all day as i recall your witty comments as I go about my life...... The Rainbows, right up my ally! I have soooooo much more appreciation and personal testimony, I have been following you for many years, and am 20year Yoga practice, but I dropped it recently and my life literally fell apart with Stress. Yoga is, quite literally, saving my Life, and you are a BIG part of that. I utterly ADORE YOU, and I wish you so much SUCCESS in Life.

"Lady, I think I am in love with you. Please marry me. Or suggest me a yoga which is gonna help me forget you. Or else I am gonna spend my whole life doing nothing but watching your yoga videos !<br />No no no , just kidding ! You are awesome ! Best wishes !<br />Or am I serious ? Don&#39;t know.<br />But yeah I like you. You are cute. Actually I have never had a gf so am always a bit curious about women.<br />Ok, ignore everything I said.<br />Kidding again !

"Hey yo. I&#39;m turning 19 this coming April. I&#39;m surprised how ove the past 3 years that i&#39;ve been doing Yoga practices with Adriene sensei, no matter how old i actually happened to be, i always felt like a happy 6 year old during each practice, wanting the play to never end or the practice to stop. I wonder if i&#39;m the only one who feels that way. As is said, happiness has no age and i&#39;m now happier and bolder than ever, ready to take on the challenge and emerge victorious with the widest smile set on my face. Time to wake the kid inside ourselves everyone. Much love. Namaste.",Shadan Zahrooni,2019-03-17T06:11:35Z,32
"oh I love your comment Shadan, and Oishee! However, I think you are still kids (and I mean that with the most respect and admiration and frankly, envy) LOL ?!! But from someone more than twice your age, you are right on! I think being connected to and expressing the child inside is one of the keys to experiencing happiness and joy in a lifetime.  Keep up the good work, kiddo!;)",Dawn D,2019-03-20T13:46:19Z,0

"Wow, Adrienne! This was so short, but oh so worth it! You completely read my mind regarding this video<br /> I had a complete meltdown and could not stop crying for days last week. The only thing that kept me going was yoga, I have been doing your yoga video for anxiety, last week&#39;s video you posted sometimes twice a day and now this one; it was short and sweet. Thank you for your healing videos, I truly appreciate it A LOT! Day 114 out of 365; I vowed to do yoga every day, no matter what and so far so good!  <br />I can see the changes. You are amazing. Truly appreciate your abundant generosity and I hope to meet you in person, when ever you come to Sacramento, California.",Par Grewal,2019-03-17T06:03:28Z,0
