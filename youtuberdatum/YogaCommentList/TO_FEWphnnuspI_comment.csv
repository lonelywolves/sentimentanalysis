"I always like to read the comments after the video finishes. It’s so lovely to see comments from just 20 minutes ago from other people enjoying your video too. It makes me feel even more connected. I’ve felt a bit under the weather today, but still showed up and did the best I could. For this, I feel better already. <br />Thank you Adriene for your wonderful presence. 🙏🏼 xxx",Rae Lou,2021-04-30T01:46:21Z,0
I love doing yoga with you. After a hard day at work it is so great to focus on myself for a little while. After 29 days I have seen a lot of changes in my body and mind. I can feel how my body feels after a great yoga session. I cannot wait to do another 30 days with you!!,Lisa Brittain,2021-04-30T01:21:48Z,1

"I hit such a yoga rut these past few videos. I did not wanna do em. I didn’t even complete some of them. But I did it all today! I finally felt connected to the warrior poses. I thought of Furiosa from Mad Max, Rey and Leia, Elizabeth from Pirates of the Caribbean. Basically my movie nerd came out. But envisioning those badass warrior women made me connect to my warrior. I finally feel great after practice instead of this slump I’ve been in. Not giving up 💪",Rebekah Finley,2021-04-19T23:07:18Z,1

"Your years teaching yoga to kids turned you into the best and most FUN teacher we’ve ever had!  😁 Your 30-day series are totally addictive!  One more day, and I will have come full circle.  I began with the 2020 “Home” journey last April during quarantine; can’t wait to do the 2020 series again in a few days. I never imagined I’d be doing DAILY yoga, but the habit has been built little by little over the past year. Thank you so much, Adriene.",Mom For Freedom,2021-02-23T18:15:21Z,1

I lost my sweet cat Casper last night.... in the day 29 video you said “every end is a new beginning” which was exactly what I needed to hear. Then you instructed us to “write” the name of someone we love on the mat! I wrote his name several times and sent him so much love at the Rainbow Bridge. 💝🏳️‍🌈,Ruthi Cass,2021-02-09T12:44:55Z,0

"I am a few days behind, but I stopped keeping record. The other day, I did two of the dedicate sessions in one day, morning and evening, but I didn&#39;t force it. I really love the balance of meditation and movement you&#39;re providing here. The temperatures right now are murderous, but I keep going and I am already thinking of cycling through the Dedicate Program a second time.",Murmurs of Blaustein,2019-06-25T20:12:34Z,0

I LOVE THIS. Second 30 days challenge I do. I noticed though that the first days are a bit too easy after doing all the other challenges so Im not sure where to go next. Skip some of the first days or go into different playlists...,Nera,2019-06-22T12:10:10Z,0

"Adrian, you are a great teacher. Your knowledge of when I&#39;m holding my breath, or position incorrectly amazes me! I am taking longer to get through the 30 days, but have been doing a practice of some variation daily. Even taking my mat with me for work travel. Might catch some flack from the other guys, but I proudly exclaim the progress made and how wonderful you are! Fun fact: &quot;Yogi&#39;s choice&quot; is my favorite phrase for some reason.😂",Jason Klawonn,2019-05-31T16:04:56Z,0
Again made it to the mat though my back protests every step and again the practice seemed aimed at helping to heal what was damaged. I was bummed to discover that my injury prevents me from any movement in my favorite cat/cow pose. But I do celebrate that I can still move and for the most part move through the entire practice today. My hips are yelling at me quite fiercely but we got through it.

I can&#39;t believe it, I still have bat wings but maybe that will clear up a little too?? Wonder if there is a yoga to help bat wings?? LOL!!",Gina Rogers-Santos,2019-03-18T17:02:03Z,0

"Feeling good. Something I have to share with the YWA community.  I have just started practicing with another you tube at home yoga teacher.  Since I found Adriene ( years ago )I have only done her videos. When the other suggestion popped up I gave it a try on a whim and while I don’t get as much out of this new teacher i do like to mix it up.  The crazy thing is that both times I have done both in one day Adriene has   Introduced a pose I rarely, if ever  do and so has the other yogi. It’s like they say, “ you are exactly where you need to be and doing exactly what you need to do”",Tammy Sack,2019-03-07T22:33:37Z,0

"Today was tough but also satisfying! I found it very fun to play with more challenging variations of poses we&#39;ve been working on since the beginning. It was awesome to see how much the knee to nose table top variation had grown and likewise with chair and warrior 3. <br /><br /><br />As the rest of my body has caught up strengthwise, these last couple of poses have finally started to properly challenge by strongest muscles aka glutes and thighs. I&#39;m noticing that I&#39;m activating them in all sorts of posture now as well as in every day gestures. The bend over the sink first changed in that I had a flatter back, then a more actiavted core (and so a flatter back) and now I am activating through the legs as well. This has made some of these everyday gestures much more comfortable and also it&#39;s nice to feel myself building strength in these moments too.<br /><br /><br />But man now that my legs have joined the party they&#39;ve joined the soreness party too. The bound forward fold was ouchy today as it stretched out some hardworking muscles.<br /><br /><br />All in all a very satisfying practice.<br /><br /><br />Thank you very much!",Synteis J,2019-03-06T04:44:49Z,0

":) I&#39;m personally celebrating the fact that I didn&#39;t give in to my own sense of laziness and showed up in the 11th hour to do this. I&#39;m being consistent, which is something I&#39;ve always struggled with when it comes to working out; I get sore, give myself a day off and then a day becomes three days. So, yay for that!<br /><br />Also, while I am terrible at standing poses, I was better this time around--which is good because it&#39;s exactly what I was to work on.",J.A. C,2019-03-03T07:48:16Z,0
My quads were burning a bit today between running and this journey...but sooo worth it! Really enjoyed the challenge of the final sequence! I also learned today that it&#39;s okay to have some negative feelings of frustration and impatience.

"Fri., 2/15/19: Today is hard to celebrate, but I will try to frame it that way. Celebrate the awareness I have of my actions, my more experimental mind. Celebrate that I keep going, even if I don&#39;t feel proud of myself in this moment. Celebrate the realization that if I don&#39;t forgive myself then it will be harder for me to get back to self-love, self-care and therefore being there for others. Celebrate the realization that my choices are what create my reality, and sometimes I&#39;m going to make bad choices, but I have to accept them to move past them and make better ones. I celebrate the fact that putting on this yoga everyday is automatically a good choice, no matter what. At least I made one good choice for 29 days so far.

"In my opinion, standing on the first leg just before the jumping part was for a little bit too long. Or, it was just me but the other leg wasn&#39;t for so long. Usually, you give explanations first in the new asana (hence the first leg) and I think the first leg (arm or whatever it is) takes longer than the other. Maybe it&#39;s something worth paying attention to. :)",Karolina Dubiel,2019-02-12T09:21:33Z,0

"Had a very bad feeling last night, bad self-worth, self-image, everything about me. So to get up this morning was hard when the feeling was still there. I almost procrastinated with my yoga, but I think because I&#39;ve done it for so many mornings it&#39;s become more automatic to reach for my mat. And wow, what a fun practice! Suddenly I was smiling - felt a bit wierd to celebrate when feeling like shit, but it helps when it&#39;s yoga! Thank you, Adriene!!!",Maja,2019-02-10T09:32:01Z,1

"Cried three times during this practice, in the beginning twice out of sadness and at the end out of happiness and forgiveness for myself. I told a friend&#39;s secret yesterday and regretted it the second it happened. I&#39;ve been living in a state of self hatred and fear that I&#39;ve lost her today. I was suppressing all those feelings untill I started the practice, it flooded out. It helped me so much today to celebrate myself. I know she&#39;ll forgive me but just needs some time and in the meantime I can&#39;t live every day hating myself for breaking the friendship. It&#39;s okay to celebrate. We are worth it.

"I felt out of sync today and sad, was holding back the tears on my mat this evening.  It took a few minutes of struggling through my practice to fInally recognise emotion for what it was, I am already grieving the end of the journey though it’s only day 29 and one more day to go. I’ve done the other 30 days programme with you but this is the first time doing 29 days in a row (albeit a week behind😁). Rather than ignoring my feelings of sadness I decided to just stay with my emotions and just honour them as I went through the practise. Today also showed me  that I have things I need t work on in my life. I need to learn to stay in and enjoy the  moment rather than always racing ahead to achieve the next thing....if I’m also honest I feel anxious about not keeping discipline of doing daily practise. But as you said,  with endings come new beginnings! I will hold onto this thought. Thank you Adriene, it’s been an amazing experience❤️💗🖖🏾",Lonley Pxnda,2019-02-05T23:27:51Z,0

I told him, with all my heart, calm and not angry, that I am not going to tear an apple of a tree. that I rather wait until it falls by itself in my open hand or that I am not gonna have it at all. Wake up inside and do whatever, but I am done shaking that tree, now.<br />That I can wait for so long and then be prepared to simply let him go, unkissed... now THAT is one achievement of my inner 5 year old girl  (and all the other wonders) that I am so proud of like I have never been proud before. <br />Thank you so much, adriene, for being a part of my life that helps me integrate stuff that I have never thought I could.",The Lindenbaum,2019-02-05T08:53:22Z,0

"January has been a  particularly tough month. Dedicate has helped me to stay sane and come back to myself from all the nonsense around. <br /> Must be the fourth January in a row with 30-day challenges of finding what feels good. <br />I am happy to see the life unfolding, challenging all of us on every corner. <br /><br />Adriene, I am so thankful for this opportunity that helps to find and building strength within. Then share it with others.<br />I am also pleased to see your own growth throughout video series each year. <br /> <br />Dedicate saved the month.",Lita Mežavilka,2019-02-04T21:46:39Z,0

"Whoa, I really needed this. I’ve been really stressed out, my car broke down, med school is tough, work is a lot and my grandma is in bad shape, and it’s felt like I’m sliding down the slippery slope back towards depression. But yoga, it’s keeping me here. <br /><br />Thank you from the bottom of my heart Adriene, for helping me through it all. The dancing at the end caught me with tears of gratitude and relief.

I practice yoga at 5 am, I have a decent breakfast, I set myself up for greatness. A week later she told me that she was doing something and that she wanted to tell me and she said &quot;I am very happy, I found this youtube channel&quot; and then I recognized the look in her eyes and I screamed &quot;YOU ARE SEEING ADRIENE!!&quot; and then she screamed &quot;YEES OMG WHAT THE... HOW DO YOU KNOW?!?!&quot; Me: &quot;YOU ARE DOING DEDICATE!!!&quot; her: &quot;YES!! BUT... HOW...?&quot; <br /><br />And then I said: you have the look. The look in your eyes that you get when Adriene touches your soul.<br /><br />Her: I Know, right?!?! How did you find her?<br /><br />Me: you don&#39;t find Adriene. She finds you.<br /><br />I am sharing this magical journey with a wonderful human being it was soooo epic.<br />I just knew the light in her face had to be because of this gift.

"I feel alive and I feel like I am on a journey that has progress. This year, is a year of intentional healing for me. When you said, unpacking your past at the end of the video, it brought me to tears. This was an affirmation to keep going. To keep showing to the mat, keep showing up for yourself and allow what we are practicing here to transform all the areas of our lives. I loved todays practice and the fluidity from thr Warrior poses to the Peace pose to the &quot;lunge twist thingy&quot; lol, I forgot the name lol. But yeah, thank you thank you thank you for guiding us.. guiding us to close our eyes,trust your voice and to trust ourselves as you remind us that we are capable of doing what we are setting out to do all while listening to our body and breaths.

"I&#39;ve tried 30 day challenges before, whether they were 30 days of squats or 30 days of planks. The challenges always felt so isolated, targeting one spot of my body and leaving me feeling so bored. I guess that&#39;s why I never follow through with them. But this challenge, this month, with you, Adriene, has caused a total shift in my perception of my strength, wisdom, and inner light. I&#39;m more connected to my body and breath than I&#39;ve ever been and this challenge has been the catalyst for that change.

"I have been doing yoga for over a year and still can only do beginners levels.  I have tried to do more vigorous classes but can only handle 10 minutes before I completely loose energy and flake out.<br /><br />I like this 30 day series as you have picked it up to next level without beasting me although I still cannot do standing poses for long as my knees hurt.  I am not overweight or anything and class myself relatively fit but I don’t know why I cannot handle more energetic classes.  I am peri menopausal and want to feel like a pro but often feel useless if I cant connect to my inner self and then often give up if standing poses are involved.  Other days I feel amazing especially doing yoga flow because the pace is flowing without being too fast.  sometimes you talk too long causing me to loose focus on connecting.<br /><br />I also still find it hard to connect to core, I know I should do more exercise for this but I do love how you incorporate this into your class.  Especially where you get the mind to connect to it then the body, it really sets the stage but how do I do this all the time when i have very little core strength to begin with?<br /><br />Can you please do more moderate classes for people like me?",Fiona Cook,2019-01-31T13:02:14Z,0

"you said at the first day, &quot;maybe you don&#39;t know why you are here&quot; and so on. for me everthing was clear, i want to help my brother to lose some weight, make some sports together, challenge us. after the 5th day or so he droped it. i liked it and realised that i had way more problems then him (some things you might not see at first). so every day i showed up on the mat i felt a little bit better, and in that process i really challengend myself to become more. the last 2 days i was really down and i didn&#39;t know why. today morning i have seen a video about &quot;how to love someone who is avoident&quot; and saw myself being that avoident person. i wrote something to help myself, see it in other directions and get happy again. then i made my morning yoga like i did for the last 29 days and really wanted to say thank you. you change some peoples live in ways you can&#39;t even imagen. you give insides to ourselfs and make this world a much better place.

"There have been several days throughout this journey that I have had to double up some sessions. Today was one of them. Having Dedicate and then Celebrate on the same day, back to back was really powerful. A few days ago I lost a childhood friend to stomach cancer. Her husband and 3 children are now in the midst of this heavy loss. I dedicated this practice tonight to her and her family. And I found that having celebrate immediately after allowed me to focus on celebrating the life we have in this moment. Each breath was a celebration of the life that her children have to hold onto. The celebration of the love we get to share with each other and need to remember to do every day. Thank you so much for this and for getting me to get back to my mat.

"Today was AMAZING. after doing the running man at the end I was ALL smiles. Funny enough my power went out due to a snowstorm in the northeast and I told myself I would still do it by candlelight to the sound of my phone. and on that first Tadasona the power magically jumped back on. I never dreamed I would really be able to commit to myself as I&#39;ve &#39;failed&#39; time and time again in the past. BUT none of those times were reallyfailures. I had lessons to learn before I got to this point. these moments, when I was READY to let go of the past and surrender and dedicate time to me. from the bottom of my heart thank you Adriene and all the gorgeous strong rockstars out there that have been on this journey together.

"This has been a wonderful journey. The past 5 days have been a struggle, as I’ve had to modify because of an injury.

"My first comment! Adriene, I have been following you for a couple of years now, dipping in and out and picking workouts that resonated with me by the title or sometimes by the length. When you offered DEDICATE, I knew I had to embrace the entire enchilada... challenge myself to stay with it, not miss more than 1 and making up the missed one the following day by doing 2, which actually was nice so have a longer workout and more time spent with you and Benji! I am someone who gets all gung how and then I just trail off, feeling oh so shitty about myself for quitting. NOT THIS TIME! I am so super proud if myself for sticking with it that I am sad it is over tomorrow 😔. But I know you will have more 30 dayers, so YAY for that! And I just have to say that I think you are just the most precious human on the planet and YOU make this journey of practicing daily yoga so much nicer, better, sweeter, FUNNIER, dog lovinger, easier etc etc etc and makes me want to show up just to hang with you and Benji! One final story....I am a human/dog trainer and your love for Benji and all creatures is a page out of my heart story. One class Benji was pacing at the window, making me feel almost anxious, so I was saying to the screen, &quot;Benji, settle baby, settle, go lay down on the blankie&quot;, and his next move was straight to the blankie and BOOM, down he went for a few calming minutes! I felt like he heard me even though it was recorded, lol! Anyway, thank you for offering your beautiful self to all of us...my gratitude is endless. NAMASTE 🕉️🧘🐕🐾💖",Julie Ever After,2019-01-31T01:25:23Z,0
"Adrienne, I only missed twice this month due to shoveling the snow. YUCK.... Lol.. I have doing this in the evenings. It helps me relax and sleep real well at night with my doTerra oils. This is also a deaf friendly. I am able to follow you real well. Thank you so much Adrienne and I LOVE Benji being around!!! I look forward to continue 365 days!!

"I’m so sad Dedicate is coming to an end. For 2019 I set a goal for myself to become stronger and healthier mentally and physically. Now I’m not reaching for an instagram model body, but for myself to feel stronger and healthier. I want to be the best version of myself and this 30 day journey has helped me start to attain those goals. Thank you Adrienne for creating this platform for people to feel like they are not alone and for creating a space where I don’t feel judged. I learned more than just yoga from this journey. I’ve learned to make time for myself. I’ve learned to be more patient and calm and I overall just feel way more happy. This journey has helped me start to have self confidence again.

"I feel kind of sad today... Just one more day of Dedicate. I will miss it. This month has been so different, and unfortunately not in a good way. My fiancé was in a bad bike accident 26 days ago, and is still at the hospital (in another country). Hopefully he will be transported back to Sweden in three days. Adriene, Dedicate and the community has helped me so much to get through these days. The time spent on my mat has been the only time of day when my mind has been in my own body. Thank you 🙏🏻🌍💞",Katarina Åström,2019-01-30T17:44:17Z,0

"I absolutely loved this practice! It is one of my favorite of Dedicate! It made me feel so happy and lighthearted! Personally, among the other things, I celebrated the fact that since a while now I do the &quot;extend and squeeze&quot; while keeping my balance all the time, while when I first started yoga some months ago I was all wobbly, and I would wonder if I&#39;d ever manage to keep my balance with that 😂<br />I also loved hopping and dancing around on the mat, it was so fun! We all need to let our inner child out like that from time to time! 💕<br />I must say half of me is already starting to feel nostalgic because Dedicate is about to end, but the other half is so proud of myself and all the yogis who came this far, going through this journey together!<br />Waiting for traditional day 30 tomorrow! Namaste! 🤗💖",Princess,2019-01-30T17:36:53Z,0
"(picture is of my husband, I don&#39;t know why!)  This 57 year old woman has been doing this series as my FIRST EVER yoga experience! Haven&#39;t missed a day...29 with 1 to go!

"I&#39;m kind of a broken record it seems in the comments I&#39;ve left during Dedicate - but I really LOVE Adriene&#39;s Yoga Camp,  It&#39;s the 30 day journey from (I think) 2015 - her second one.  I&#39;m on Day 9 of camp because I wanted to not even remotely allow myself to say &quot;well, that&#39;s over....now lots more sitting in my chair reading...&quot;  That&#39;s good too but as a retired teacher I often have TOO much time to do that and not enough physical activity in my life - and at 69, I can&#39;t afford to be lazy.  I&#39;ll turn into a big lump!  You might want to consider Yoga Camp after tomorrow.  Or her calendar for February... or other 30 practices.  It&#39;s wonderful how much she really DOES have our backs.",Linda Hart,2019-01-30T18:50:57Z,0

"Thank you, Adriene, for this challenge. It kept me in touch with the outside world this month. Me and my closest friends have had our final exams of med school these last few days, so it was what you might want to call a stressful few months and weeks especially. Yoga and this challenge in particular have helped with anxiety, low energy levels and motivation to keep on pushing through. February 1st is our last exam and I feel more than prepared also thanks to you! Namaste &lt;3",PLHappines,2019-01-30T17:18:39Z,1
"I&#39;ve really been coming up against my resistance the past few days. I&#39;m doing a Whole 30 along with Dedicate and and I&#39;ve found myself craving things that I&#39;m choosing not to eat right now and resistance to getting on the mat. But I&#39;m still showing up and sticking with it all. And even though I allow my resistance to delay me, I&#39;m still here each day, and feeling stronger for it.

I&#39;ve done Pilates once or twice a week in the past, I&#39;ve done yoga once or twice a week in the past, I&#39;ve done Cross-Fit a few times a week a while back, but I&#39;ve never been so motivated to come back here every day, looking forward to what you have in store for me. I love your channel, and I think you are an amazing teacher, and you sound like such a lovely person. I will continue to practise everyday because it makes me feel sooooo good. Merci beaucoup!

Choosing to celebrate even in the tough times reminds me how much my mindset affects my experience. :) I woke this morning to a text with a picture showing me my BRAND NEW NIECE was born last night and a notification that today&#39;s CELEBRATE practice was waiting - what a perfect combo!

"Oh my goodness.  What an incredible joyful practice! Today I celebrate me- the 20th anniversary of becoming a Mom.  My son has his birthday today. My daughter turns 18 tomorrow.  I celebrate them, and their wonderful lives, but also me- Mom has been soooo much of my identity.  And I have been a fantastic Mom.  I know my role as Mom is lessening, and I celebrate that I am finding new ways to express myself and be.  So, today was such a fantastic celebration of that.  I danced with abandon, and choked up with emotion in the final tadasana - tears of joy falling down from my eyes. Blessed.  Love this.  Namaste. 🙏",Sarah Safar,2019-01-30T15:04:11Z,55

"Thank you, Adriene. For this series, and for everything, most importantly for putting yourself out there and not being afraid to show us who you are. You have a lightness about you, and it is infectious and inspiring.<br /><br />I&#39;ve been going through some trials, and having trouble with where I am in life and understanding how I feel and what I should be doing with myself. Today, I was like, what do I celebrate, what does that even mean?? But by the end, when my thighs were burning, and I was laughing with you in the Knocking on Heavens door, I thought, Thank you, Adriene: I&#39;m feeling something. Maybe that&#39;s all I needed. There are neither beginnings or endings, but maybe this could be a beginning.<br />Peace and love, always. From Michigan ❤️",Emily Morgan Ellis,2019-01-30T15:03:42Z,1

I&#39;ve been practicing yoga on and off for three years now and this is the first time I really stuck with thirty consecutive days of it. It hasn&#39;t been easy showing up on the mat every day, and I&#39;ve been having such a hard relationship with my body, but today during practice I was smiling and laughing the whole time. I can&#39;t explain the joy of finally sticking to it, even if some days (like side plank day) I just pretended to do the poses with Adrienne or gave up halfway through a posture. Thank you so much everyone for going through this with me, let&#39;s finish it together! Thank you Adrienne for guiding us through this journey. Also side note, I have a job interview today.

Realising I never take the time to celebrate the things I&#39;ve done or the way I feel. We get so caught up in life, only seeing the things we still &#39;have to do&#39;, that we sometimes forget to celebrate the fact that we&#39;re alive in the first place. Great reminder 💛",Anna nas,2019-01-30T12:10:00Z,7

"I’m burning up and it’s -20 outside!! This was tough for me! I couldn’t keep up which always frustrates me, but the wiser me sees that the mountain is much taller and the valley is much deeper than I knew. Both there for me to explore and learn and grow! Thank you for speaking to my soul right when I needed it! It’s amazing how you always do! This journey is so much fun with you! Can’t wait for tomorrow!",Marc Grim,2019-01-30T12:00:36Z,0
Today was an off day for me. I was so tired during the practice and chose to do child&#39;s pose during a few moves because that&#39;s what my body was craving. My balance was off and I just needed ease. I was gentle with myself and took modifications. Hoping tomorrow I feel 100% for. I can&#39;t believe day 29 is done!,Leanne Anderson,2019-01-30T11:59:48Z,0
"Today I saw myself in a whole new light. Not just the person that I want to be, not the person that my past actions have made me, but truly, inevitably, me. The daughter of my parents, the sister of my siblings, the aunt of my sister&#39;s children, etc. These are the simple things I tend to forget about in the ride of becoming who I hope to become. I truly saw myself as a child again, just in time for the end when I let loose and danced around my living room with no shame and a huge smile on my face. This is celebration. Celebrate what truly makes you YOU. Thank you for guiding me through it, Adriene. Love you, friend.",Catherine Weber,2019-01-30T11:56:06Z,0

"I never share comments BUT I had a couple of amazing moments today and I can’t keep it in! 1: I just felt the need to put my hands to my third eye just a fraction of a second before Adriene said to! It felt so cool! I feel like that’s a great sign I’m tapping into my intuition now Second thing was that for the first time all month I decided to see what would happen if I did it in front of my little son- he’s a year and 10 months- he did a few little poses but basically ignored me until just at the end when we were knocking on heavens door our own way- after a little while he noticed and loved it! He was on his feet, giggling and frolicking with joy! It was such a beautiful moment! It felt like a true celebration!",Gracie Hardy,2019-01-30T11:30:38Z,162

"Yahooo!!! One achievement on top of the other today, it is totally worth throwing a party pushing myself to the limit. I gotta say it right now, this practice perfectly blends in with today&#39;s events. Currently dancing my way up to the sky off of joy and this practice is the perfect remedy to relieve some hip pain and tightness. This day cannot get any better. Will have to do the practice a litle later today cause i was up for an early ride to the capitol city to a very decisive affair and it was by far the biggest success i&#39;ve ever had in the last five years. Just got back home and am preparing for the fest right now. Tonight&#39;s gonna be an all nighter. I feel boundless right now. Who&#39;s down for a party? Thanks for the energizing practice Adriene.

"Adriene, your quote by Iyengar this morning was me. My yoga light with you was lit in April 2016 and has NEVER dimmed. It grows bright and strong. This practice was again thoughtful and building, loving the extra pause breaths in between, flowing through, repeating right then left, we knew what was coming, enjoying the moment. Super yummy practice ..... “how lucky are we ?” Your Cruella mention made me laugh, no vinyasa through forward plank today, just step up to forward fold , so laughing it messed up my halfway lift. We had fun together, thanks Adriene, awesome. I am approaching our last day tomorrow with a mixture of sadness and excitement, will it be one of your beautiful unspoken flowing practices to music ?

"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! I&#39;m eternally grateful for this practice, this 30 day journey, for your channel and for you. Just after last year&#39;s TRUE, I found out I was hypermobile and my doctor said I shouldn&#39;t do yoga anymore. I was heartbroken. I cried. I took a bit of a break from the yoga mat but after about a month I decided to ease my way back there. And it was like a whole new practice. I was so much more aware of my body. I made sure I didn&#39;t overbend my joints, I listened to my body the way I always should&#39;ve listened to it. 2018 was a year of figuring out what yoga meant to me, and about finding what truly felt good for me and my body. Starting out 2019 with Dedicate has been magical and so beneficial. I enjoy yoga so much more now and Dedicate has taken my practice to a whole new level. I&#39;ve been doing yoga for 6 years, but I was doing it in the wrong way before.  Now that I truly know my limits and what truly feels good,  magic has started happening on the mat. I see myself making remarkable progress and my mind is calmer than ever before. So thank you, Adriene. Thank you for teaching yoga in such an accepting and loving way. Thank you for Dedicate. &lt;3",Elina Nilsson,2019-01-30T08:26:10Z,37
"Elina Nilsson me too! I’ve known about my hypermobility for years but it took a great yogi to teach when I should stop my over stretching. And it gave my awareness to my body a whole new meaning. I, too love yoga too much to stop and so does my body and mind :-)",linda Christensen,2019-02-24T06:48:49Z,0
I love how Adriene teaches and reminds us to know our limits and that it&#39;s OK and better to just do what our current body is really capable of and give ourselves that grace :),Lisha Yost,2019-01-31T18:47:43Z,2
