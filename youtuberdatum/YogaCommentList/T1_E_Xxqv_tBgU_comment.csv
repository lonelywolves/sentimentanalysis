Not happy at how I let it get under my skin, but this helped, and everyday that I start with yoga and you, is making a difference.

"Adriene, thank you.<br />My best friend and I have been doing HOME and Dedication during quarantine, and it really kept us sane during these times and also strengthened our relationship so much by simply talking everyday (even if it was only over FaceTime). This particular day though is special to us. <br />When we first did this practice we found it so calming that we joked we would always do it prior to exams (the high school graduands in Germany still have to take the full A levels).<br />And that&#39;s exactly what we did, today was our last time, she has her history final today, and I decided this comment would be perfect to round things off. <br />I have been writing this in my head for the last five days or so and I just really wanted to thank you, for you and this practices being a social connector, a glimmer of hope during long learning days, for not making us feel shit about our bodies, for being the calm before the exam and for being there for us.<br />Thank you and namaste",blooming lulu,2020-05-25T05:56:36Z,1
"I am late to the party but so enjoying this journey Adriene. Thank you. I had knee replacement surgery a year ago and have been so focused on strengthening my quads that I rather let everything go by. This had been a wonderful reintroduction to my previous yoga practice. I admit today was particularly challenging for my knee, but fortunately, there is always tomorrow to slowly and surely get flexibility back. Thank you again.",Connie Harris,2020-05-23T16:47:16Z,1

"“A moment of self care.. There’s so many of you out there that I know are caretakers, some of you really intent, beautiful, almost HEROIC caretakers. “<br /><br />Shoutout to every single doctor, nurse, caretaker, anyone that is helping others get through this tough time. I teared up when Adrienne called caretakers heroic during this practice today, because during this whole pandemic, they really have been our heroes! <br /><br />I hope you can all take a moment to nurture your own bodies and have some quiet time to yourselves, you all deserve it.

I just felt the need to express my gratitude to you Adriene. Thank you with all my heart. This past year Ive been on a wild journey. I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I did 6 months of chemo Had a double mastectomy and just completed radiation therapy. It has been a healing journey for mind body and spirit. I was so terribly out of balance and I believe that is how the cancer was able to come into being. Your videos have helped me bring yoga into my days and it has been such a blessing. Easing pain and bringing me into a balance. I have noticed a body awarness that was not there before and it has been a wonderful addition to my healing journey. Thank you so much.,Finding My Balance,2020-05-06T18:45:20Z,1

He carries his country with a supportive, positive attitude that means vast majority feel good about themselves and can look forward to their day.

I can do it all my own way!!&quot; etc. Maybe it would help to do these more frequently, this is turning into Around the Home in 80 Days...

Doing the 30 days of yoga for myself while being in full-time nursing school and working as a healthcare worker.  Listening to you talk about self-care and those of us who are caretakers and all of a sudden I&#39;m like &quot;why am I crying?!&quot;.

This one was tuff. Crossed legged sitting  is so hard for me to do but I  think its helping. I&#39;m seeing a little more movement. It still hurts though.

I could bow my head all the way till ground is that normal too?",Aryaa Rai,2020-04-16T16:12:34Z,0

"Adrienne I love you and usually I think you do an ace job with modifications and taking possible beginners into account but when it comes to felxibility stuff I really feel like you don&#39;t realise some of us really have zero flexibility. I can&#39;t even touch my toes without bending my knees. This doesn&#39;t make my body feels nurtured, a lot of this actually made my body feel pain. Please please consider how inflexible people may be in future and provide mods so we don&#39;t end up feeling defeated and/or like we might actually be doing damage to our bodies.",Harriet Sarah,2020-04-14T00:55:13Z,1

"This practice was actually a really tough one for me. I felt so insecure - especially in cobbler&#39;s pose when I was bowing my head to the ground and inside this circle my legs built - I just could&#39;nt help but cry. In this moment I felt so much grief from losing my mom that i have been hiding for almost a year now. Not only I&#39;ve been hiding it from people surrounding me, also from myself. As I am writing this now I can&#39;t stop crying and also sweating because I start to feel the emotions coming up now. I know that this sounds quite terrible but I thank you so much Adriene, you help me feel my body, feel myself - which I never thought could ever happen again. Love you Adriene.

Does anyone else experience lower back pain when you lie down for the last pose? It&#39;s so painful that I sometimes can&#39;t lie down for more than a few moments. But it also doesn&#39;t happen every time! Just sometimes lying down causes me some problems.,Catherine Root,2020-02-19T01:33:38Z,0
"Yes I have a similar problem, and I did feel it today particularly. Personally I need to crack my back whenever I lay down (yoga or not), so I generally do a few supine twists on my own when going into savasana. Thinking back to this practice specifically, I think I tend to overstretch my lower back in head to knee pose- feels great in the moment, but those muscles then have a hard time contracting/relaxing for a while after that. Your situation may be different, but you are definitely not alone!",Seekay Hui,2020-02-20T20:42:43Z,2

You have brought me back to a more frequent practice, which is a welcomed benefit in my life, I feel better in my body, and my spirit, and so am a more grounded/centered loving person to all.   Sometimes my favorite sessions with you are in the middle of then night, if I wake... I may just get up and do a session.  Delightful!   Your Home series is fantastic. Uh....

"After looking forward to a new 30 days of yoga for months, I managed to get sick not once but twice since day one (so I am on day 12 on day 24). I would usually try to push myself to get caught up with everyone else, but I decided to listen to my body and do just one session per day. Amazingly, there was a low to the ground practice on my (second!) first day back and again today after what was a challenging week. Sometimes G-d/the Universe/the Force 🙃 knows what’s you need and when you need it! I am grateful to be back on my mat with my two kitties (and the toy mice they drop on the mat) by my side.

I&#39;ve been through the motions of not wanting to show up and finding the commitment really challenging, and now I honestly look forward to it! I never thought downward facing dog would be an enjoyable pose and some how now it is! haha! Also Day 6...man that was brutal! I had friends round for pizza and it got super late but I was like &#39;I still have to do my yoga today, I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be that bad...&#39; well it was the most challenging day so far for me and I don&#39;t think the pizza helped! haha!

"So, I’ve been following this, a couple days behind. Grandma died 2 days ago. Had to pause the practice cause I had to travel 700 miles to get to her. This is a place where funerals take several days, long prayers in latin, lots of food, lots of visitors and people paying their respects. Is exhausting for the family, since everything happens in the same house where grandma lived, died, where the family is staying. So I just came back to the practice, and the burrito practice is just what I needed for my grief. I thank you, from my sore, tired little heart ❣️",Rocío Álvarez,2020-01-19T15:08:50Z,334

"As one of the new year&#39;s resolutions this year I decided to lose weight. I always wanted to do it, but I was give up each time. So I sat on the diet, which is quite hard one to endure. And today the clear thought came into my mind &quot;Why I have to torture myself and my organism just to look toned for someone? I can do it in a much loving way than it is now and I better love myself as I am, because it is me after all!&quot; And today was this amazingly beautiful practice which showed me that I am right and I better enjoy this all that I have and not to try to change it just that somebody liked me. <br />Namaste, Adriene. You helped me out again, thank you.",Ирина Петрова,2020-01-19T04:10:35Z,99

This is supposed to be nurturing!!!&quot; comment was way too funny, way too real hahaha! I wonder if I&#39;m the only one who loved the boat pose. I love working on my abs and I love feeling these little fires. Makes me feel like I&#39;m doing something good for my body. I&#39;m giving it a good shock; it feels alive!!! I used the &quot;Ground&quot; practice to help me stay longer +  balanced on the boat pose too. I need/want to be nurtured (or blanketed as you said) with love, care, attention, peace and faith - pretty basic but very important in one&#39;s life in my opinion. I really like the sound of the word *nurture*. We live in a society where we are always feeding, always consuming but does it bring you love? Hope? Happiness? If anything, it weakens you...",Sarah S.,2020-01-15T18:34:18Z,0

And that’s actually GREAT! <br />I came to the mat this morning soo looking forward to picking back up, absolutely CRAVING it and feeling reenergised to continue. <br />And I’ve decided to do day 12 and 13 today because whyyyy not?! <br />Xoxoxoxoxo lots of love everyone! <br />P.s i NEED a breathing bolster",Alys Ffion,2020-01-14T22:29:53Z,1

"Wow, yesterday was a very hard day for me and I wasn&#39;t able to do the practice. When I got to my mat today the first thing I thought was: I should have done yoga yesterday, it would have helped me with my mental state... Even though... tomorrow I will do two practices so that I can go at the same time with all of you! xx",Weronika Mlocek,2020-01-14T22:23:22Z,0
"This one was apt for me today, I’m a day behind due to having a poorly baby who is needing a lot of tlc at the moment! I imagined being blanketed in sleep!!!! It’s hard to focus on the yoga the way I would like when a lot of my attention is directed to listening out for a wee cry or snuffle or cough from the next room! But I got through the practice with no interruptions so I will take that as a win!",Alanna Salter,2020-01-14T22:06:59Z,0
"In poses like head to knee and cobblers pose, where we are folding over, do we keep a flat back? Or can it round? Also do I let my head dangle? <br /><br />I also want to say I felt the cobblers pose in my lower back today and when I sat up I felt a familiar lower back pain. But then we did boat pose and the pain in my back immediately disappeared. I learned today that it&#39;s important to follow the sequence of poses in order. Also if you have back pain, having a strong core helps a lot. ❤️",Orkdoop,2020-01-14T21:49:55Z,0

"Hi Adriene! This practice made me think that it would be a great thing if there was a series of practices for fighting social fobia and anxiety issues. I teach English as a second language to adults and a good share of my students miss their opportunities for learning because they have too much anxiety to do the things they want and need to do. I know you have made some practices for anxiety, but a series would be a real opportunity for change, I think. I would give them as homework!

"Hi Adriene, I really appreciate all that you share with us and I love that you read our comments. Every comment I have ever written has been liked and read by you which I find amazing and quite heart warming. You may remember reading about a little ferret named Chauncey, he joined me again today and was just lulled to sleep by your voice. I wanted to share his story with you and the community because it fits into this theme of &quot;Home.&quot; Chauncey is a rescue, he was first found abandoned in the Garden Center of a Home Depot when he was just a kit. He was adopted out by a family and for three years was a companion to another ferret. Sadly, when that ferret died, the owners decided they no longer wanted him. He lost both his best friend and his home. He returned to the same rescue shelter as before, but now he was 4. He was considered an older/elderly ferret, which many people don&#39;t adopt. He was placed in a separate area from the rest of the ferrets at the rescue because he was excluded from the group. He spent about 6 months after that in solitude, until I adopted him. The fact that this energetic and loving animal was abandoned twice breaks my heart, but I know that he now has a forever home and I spoil him as much as I can so that maybe someday he can feel secure. This journey &quot;Home&quot; is as much of a journey for me as it is for Chauncey. It&#39;s suiting that my first yoga journey with him is called &quot;Home&quot; as I have found my new home at college and he has found his new home with me",Madeleine Carey,2020-01-14T03:25:04Z,0

Each semester has thrown my self care to the side and had me barrel head first into assignments and run myself down, growing irritable at all around me.  My goal with this challenge was to keep my sanity and nurture my well being in times when it isn’t natural for me.<br />All these challenges have changed me just a little and left me better than it found me, but this one is working for deep, real, cellular change in how I treat myself and treat others.

"Hi guys! Can I get some help? After doing some yoga, my low back feels so uncomfortable for the first five or ten minutes of shavasana. I have a huge gap between my low back and the mat. Like so unbearably uncomfortable that I have to hug my knees into my chest or flex my abs and push my lower back down onto the mat. I’m really careful to always draw my lower ribs in when I practice so I’m not sure what is going on.  After five or ten minutes of alternating between grinning and bearing it and some relief poses, my lower back settles down and I’m fine. Any ideas re what is going on? What can I do? Thanks!

"Day 12 Nurture - I had a rough start to this week starting from this morning and it really got me down to the point where I felt like I was not enough and I kinda just spiralled into this sadness and lack of faith in myself. I friend of mine she really encouraged me and it help me get out of that frame of mind and then I come to the mat and this practice was the cherry on the cake like I literally told my friend when she ask how i was after that I okay but I will be better once I practice my yoga today and boy was I right. This practice was for me, no doubt about it and you were so right Adriene we can&#39;t sweep things under the rug and expect to be okay and for I felt like I needed so I can get on with my daily tasks and keep moving but it just kept me occupied but my mind was hurting so thank u for this practice Adriene I feel lighter now and more at peace.

"I&#39;m so glad to be back on schedule after missing two days of the practice. You most likely pre-shot all these videos and automatically have them being uploaded everyday, but the psychologic effects of this are very real. Thank you for showing up for &quot;me&quot; daily, for keeping that promise, for always having my back! You keeping that promise and showing &quot;me&quot; that love makes me want to appreciate that by showing myself the same love and showing up for myself daily. I also know that making this free is a good way to draw a lot of people to your channel, building a community and with that making money elsewhere. But this psychological effect is also very real. You made this for &quot;me&quot;, no conditions, you just want to give me love and healing and don&#39;t expect anything in return. With you there&#39;s never a catch, I can just fully let go and trust. I don&#39;t know if I can even really express this in words, but that&#39;s deep! At least for me.

And now, wrapped up in blanket, I was thinking about the view, and I was thinking about wanting to be active, wanting to be better runner, wanting to be more healthy... and the thing is, I never will be the perfect person I dreamed up, but I&#39;m already doing something. I went for that run, even if it was only 3k, I showed up today on the mat, even if I can&#39;t properly straighten my leg, and I remebered to eat that 1 piece of vegetable.

"I initially had to hold out on day 9&#39;s practise due to chronic illness wanting to mess with me too much all day and felt almost defeated when I had to give in and end the day without any yoga that night. It felt as though I had to give up on the challenge now due to circumstances that were out of my control but the next morning, with fresh energy, I decided not to let this force me to give up  but to simply keep going with the slight delay of a day. Tonight, I started out with day 11 and mindfulness finally kicked in to an extent that I felt absolutely invigorated after my practise and actually craved more – so half an hour later, I am still sat on my mat, just having finished day 12 and suddenly being back on schedule again without initially trying to be. Looks like I technically only get to do 29 days of this challenge that way but I&#39;m hopeful I&#39;ll get to make up for it by continuing on as regularly and for as long and as I can once this challenge comes to an end. Thank you for getting me there in the first place 💕",lola in bloom,2020-01-13T22:08:05Z,0

Being a heroic care giver really resonated with me. Not only in the job I do as a nurse but how that tips over into trying to help everyone else with everything they are having issues with. My biggest lesson to date is that you can not give from an empty cup and this yoga experience I am reconnecting with again this year more solidly into my care routine really brings home the importance of helping yourself,Samantha Tapscott,2020-01-13T21:38:32Z,0

"I&#39;m trying to get back into yoga and I&#39;ve remembered why I stopped. Everything annoys me and distracts me from the routine. I find I itch everywhere, I&#39;m hyper sensitive to noise and other stimuli - even feeling my pulse in my finger tips or the feeling of my tongue against the roof of my mouth drives me insane. Whenever I&#39;m supposed to stretch my hands out wide, I want to clench them into fists. I know I&#39;m a highly strung person by nature and I want to get into yoga to calm my nerves, help me be mindful - i.e get away from all that because I know it&#39;s bad for my mental health - but it&#39;s kind of doing the exact opposite. If a position lasts any more for a minute I&#39;m desperate to move on. How do you get over these sorts of feelings and not allow these things to bother you?",Semantic Samuel,2020-01-13T21:30:11Z,0

I&#39;m not the most agile or well balanced but flexibility is one of my more strong suits and favourites and just that little bit of full on flexibility on the mat today made me so happy.

"My breathing bolster Reggie was mirroring Benji as per usual. &lt;3  Loved today.  This practice has really been changing my life. For years I&#39;d been searching for that &quot; thing &quot; that truly embodies self love, exercise and feeling good and when I&#39;d started a few years back with your videos I loved them, but struggled with finding the self love to completely give myself over to the practice. Finally, over the past little while I&#39;ve been giving myself over to yoga. Practicing daily along with you, but also combining meditation,  listening motivational speeches, eating healthy, and being positive in my outlook in life.  This month instead of consuming alcohol which I used to &quot; de stress&quot; multiple times a week, I instead joined a hot yoga studio and am excited to be making new friends and new habits. Thank you so much for empowering us all to be the best version of ourselves. ( Best version meaning not the ultimate top yoga star, but loving ourselves where we are and honouring our bodies and minds.) Love you!!!",Bianca Colangelo,2020-01-13T19:25:00Z,0

"I thought I was missing something; reading the comments that mention someone becoming so emotional from one of these videos and how the moments really effected them.  I&#39;ve found peace and happiness, but I&#39;ve never cried with Adriene...until today. My Gram is in the hospital and her health is rapidly deteriorating. My heart hurts. At the end of this practice we rubbed our hands together and made warmth with the friction - and then placed our palms on our heart-center. I cried. I&#39;m still crying. The warmth felt like a hug for my heart (if that makes sense) and now I&#39;m an emotional wreck as I await more news about my Gram.

I live in a remote place in Northern Ontario (in Canada) and it has been cold and miserable for the most part this winter. I am going through a really rough time regarding a small business as well as major family turmoils and I am not sure I would have an ounce of positivity if it wasn’t for your yoga and specifically this 30 day journey home. I feel nurtured today and I can’t help but feel so lucky to practice with so many people around the world and I am certainly inspired by you and all the other people on this journey.

"This was fun!  The stretching was fun, and the cheerleader pose, your fav, was fun to do.  I did notice my left side was a bit more different than my right.  When you said notice any differences then you did a facial expression like wow, then I was like dang.  It was a little bit difficult to hold there, felt a little resistance that wanted me to shift to the right, but I held it down.   For Boat Pose my sail sort of snapped  towards the end, but it was still up.  It was smooth sailing for the most part!  Great vid, and have a nice day! :)",Justin4life,2020-01-13T17:09:54Z,0

"About 21 mins of this practice were indeed the calmest minutes of my day this far but about 20 seconds were the most hectic ones: I was rubbing my hands against each other with full effort and freaked out because I heard my mom shouting &quot;No!&quot; to our cat because he almost managed to sneak upstairs where he isn&#39;t allowed to go to. I began to laugh and those ended up being the funniest 20 seconds of my day as well😂👍🏻 I wanted to be planketed in peace and it was like the universe had told me not to take things too seriously...

"Today was the first time that I have ever cried during a practice. I don&#39;t restrain from crying, it also is not rare for me. When tears come I let them flow. But I&#39;ve never cried during yoga before. When we were asked to blanket ourselves with things that we want to nurture and &#39;community&#39; came up, that hit me. That was the moment of tears. <br /> <br />I ended up meditating in child&#39;s pose afterwards and more tears fell on my mat. I thought about drying them, but I let them be. I&#39;m glad that I&#39;m starting to be a part of this community and that I&#39;m not alone. None of us are alone. I still feel pain and isolation but those feelings aren&#39;t who I am, they are just things I&#39;m experiencing. I meditated for a long time, just breathing in love and breathing it back out. I&#39;m glad to be here.",Anna Broomfield,2020-01-13T16:52:11Z,0

Back at the practice again this morning! It seems fitting that on a day of nurturing and softness I&#39;ve come to the decision that may seem harsh to some. I&#39;m deciding to end a romantic connection I&#39;ve been pursuing because I feel I have lost trust this person and can&#39;t see myself returning to the connection with the same openness and vulnerability I had when we began seeing either other. It is through nurturing and homding space for  my being that I am realizing my love needs to be fully directed toward spirit and those important I hold dear on this physical plane. I tend to lose myself in a romantic partner but I would rather abstain from romantic connections than settle for a connection that isnt aligned with my highest self and her way back home. I am excited about reintroducing myself to spirit with a new form of devotion but also nervous to tell this person that it&#39;s over as they have fear of abandonment and a fear of rejection. I just wont be with someone who plays games. If someone wants real I&#39;ll be over here but I would much rather focus my effort on what&#39;s truly important now. Through this nurturing practice I am learning more about myself and my priorities in life. Thank you all for your openness and support. Thank you Adriene for creating such a healing community. 🙏🕉,Connor,2020-01-13T15:24:23Z,0

"Still here! It gets easier and easier to show up every day. Daily yoga does wonders for my mental and physical health, and today brought tears of joy to my eyes as I realized how nurturing I was being towards myself. I&#39;m happy that you mentioned that caretakers sometimes struggle with self-care, as that perfectly describes me! My lack of self-care led to a burnout so severe I almost abandoned my field (and life I&#39;d established) entirely. Thankfully, I quit the job that wasn&#39;t serving me, started a different job in a different organization, and am now feeling much more satisfied. I can show up not only at work, but at home and play as well. It&#39;s amazing to feel more balanced. Looking forward to Day 13. :)",PhoenixPinion,2020-01-13T14:55:51Z,0

"I’ve been trying to put into words what YWA has meant for me..<br />It started back in January 2016; I was newly single, getting used to being on my own and living by myself, and per recommendation of a friend I decided to join this 30 days challenge. <br />I was really looking forward to this (‘Yeah, self-care!’), but quit after just 5 days.. <br />I was impatient and I couldn’t be present. I got so nervous worrying I wasn’t ‘doing it right’, I rewatched and redid the poses countless times which, after too many downward dogs, resulted in a weeklong headache. <br /><br />Fast forward to 4 years later; I find myself in a similar position, and I’m doing a second attempt at this challenge. The first 11 days have contributed to a better sleep, newfound strength and appreciation for my body. The challenge is helping me to get out of my head (I’m HSP) and I feel more grounded every day! I look forward to the new videos, knowing that so many others are committed to the same journey, and I’ve even joined a weekly yoga class to get a little more confident in the poses. <br />Thank you, Adriene, for building this beautiful community and giving us all a comfortable platform to learn and grow without judgement (and with warmth and a sense of humor)! <br />Couldn’t recommend YWA enough :)",Annie Beers,2020-01-13T14:36:33Z,0

"I’ve never commented before but I’ve been following you for quite a while and I love having you as my yoga guide :) today in particular pulled at some heartstrings as I no longer have my breathing bolster pillow, we recently lost my 85lb mutt (to cancer), my Harley barley, my yoga partner, so often my tummy warmer in shavasana ... I have many pictures, so many memories but oh how he is missed. Love on your fur babies extra today for me.",Audra Turner,2020-01-13T14:30:25Z,0

This practice was amazing! I was skeptical at first as I wanted a little fiery practice. But this left me feeling so good and astonishingly bendy 😂 that my namaste went all the way to the floor without any effort!<br />But Benji is Spectacular!!! I couldn&#39;t stop laughing out loud at the face he made when he realised he was the bolster!!!<br />Thank you Adriene.. you are amazing,Aparna Samarakoon,2020-01-13T14:27:46Z,0

"something I&#39;ve noticed in yoga videos occasionally is that when we&#39;re taking a few cycles of breath, I&#39;m still on cycle two (taking long, slow breaths) and the video&#39;s already moved on to the next thing. I wish a little more time were given for nice, long deep breaths. Just something I&#39;ve noticed, not just in this video but in other yoga places on YouTube. I know I can pause the video, but it&#39;d be nice to just be given that time to fully breathe nice and long.

"I have so much to say after that delicious practice. First--Wendell Berry&#39;s poem has become a mantra for me very often through the last year or so: &quot;What we need is here.&quot; It weaves itself into my endeavors to create a hyper-local life full of art and good food and community and care. I am in the midst of two inter-related and completely disparate projects. One is imbuing my 2-acre cultivated land with perma-culture practices, and the other is producing a performance of Missa Gaia: Earth Mass created by the people in the Paul Winter Consort and now performed in a lot of different versions all over the world. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksWvElS_-nE&amp;list=PLw9KcFk9OmsDGrxBRiej-xrYItlXktaGu"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksWvElS_-nE&amp;list=PLw9KcFk9OmsDGrxBRiej-xrYItlXktaGu</a> is where you can hear one of these community versions. These projects come out of a time of healing I was encouraged into by my wise body--crying our for more nurturing. Somehow that time I gave myself last year has resulted in the energy to engage these two projects which feel so right.  But that&#39;s not even all: I&#39;ve had the privilege of playing for several church services lately and this lyric from a hymn I learned as a child keeps coming up. &quot;On the stormy sea, Jesus speaks to me, and the billows cease to roll.&quot; Marry all that with some recent study of Aramaic through books by Neil Douglas-Klotz:  What I hear is the essential unity of what Yoga, and Christianity, and probably every other wisdom tradition teaches about finding the king-dom, or queen-dom within as a well of strength from which we can draw as we walk about in our world shining our light. Thank you so much, Adrienne for being our guide. Love and Light to you all.",Ellen Schwindt,2020-01-13T13:43:48Z,0

"Today is my 66th birthday and this year is the first time I’ve ever attempted yoga.  I am hanging in there, and yesterday I was actually starting to feel like I’m getting stronger. That is, until she did that crow thing and lifted her feet off the ground.   OMG!!  That blew my mind, and my body would not do that. I felt sorta deflated at that point.  Did anyone else experience that? I’ve been able to do most everything else....but not that!  Haven’t done today’s yet......hope it is not as challenging....",PK Texas,2020-01-13T12:59:19Z,2

So needed this practice morning and the feeling of the room infused with what I need.  Lovingly followed by wrapping up in a blanket of love before going out for some fierce care giving to the young people I support.  Ollie the dog was jumping up on the blanket trying to pull it off my shoulders to play with! A good metaphor of what life does off your mat and how to stay with that energetic nurturing that we create in our yoga practice. <br /><br />Thanks for Nurturing us all today Adriene and Benji ❤️,Jo Chew,2020-01-13T10:54:38Z,0

"I would like to thank you, Adriene, for making this yoga journey achievable for even someone, like me, who for the last 3 days was in hotels, tired and sleep deprived. The videos are short, I never felt like I couldn&#39;t fit it in if I didn&#39;t try just a little, and they never asked anything of me, I wasn&#39;t able to give. Which helped with not giving up. The practice is building me, instead of making me feel like my commitment isn&#39;t enough, or I am not trying hard enough.<br /><br />Thank you for teaching me, that 20 minutes is a valuable amount of time, a good enough contribution to give to a new skill or a new practice. I often forget that. <br /><br />Namaste. From my heart to yours. 💕",Zsilye,2020-01-13T09:55:12Z,161

At 66 I find it really really hard to do those hip opening moves. My knees go nowhere near the floor. So leaning forwards in the cobbler pose is well nigh impossible. Not sure if there is something I could do to make these easier. Any suggestions?

"I&#39;ll be practicing when it&#39;s not the middle of the night my time, but I wanted to pop in and say something I&#39;ve been meaning to say for a bit --- hello everyone! As someone living with a chronic, life-limiting and life-threatening illness, beginning yoga at the beginning of this month with you all has been a really beautiful process. My body,  slowly being eaten by my illness, is not very strong. But Adriene, I cannot thank you enough for letting me find these moments of strength, and of peace and serenity.

"Today is the first day I did yoga before going to work. After 3 weeks of holiday this is the best start of the day before rushing into work. Even better, before my yoga I even managed to do a little meditation. @Adriene and all, please have a look to the app InsightTimer, and search for the course “Coming home to yourself” of Sarah Blondin. She has a beautiful voice and I believe this is a perfect add to this yoga journey and above all, allows us even more to come HOME. Enjoy the ride and have fun, every day ♥️. Thanks for all doing this together with me, I can feel the power of the universe, motivating me every day to continue this nice adventure 🙏🏻.

"Day 12: I needed this today. It&#39;s has been pretty cold here. I mean, it does not snow where I live in India as it does in so many places around the world, but it&#39;s cold enough. So, the blanket was warm, fuzzy, and soothing. Again, I was a little sore because of running last evening. And come on Adriene, &quot;breathing bolster&quot;, I mean come on. How much cuter can the yoga practice get? Sigh! When will I have a breathing bolster? XD. Well, thank you for this practice. I am grateful. Namaste.",rubyveil19,2020-01-13T06:38:58Z,0

"I think a lot of the best things in life are things that make you feel. As I was burrito’d and Adriene asked about what we’d want to blanketed in my first and only thought was love. I didn’t realize until just now that I don’t feel very loved in my life - and that can very much just be my impression and not how the people in my life feel - but knowing that I feel a lack of love I think will be helpful. Moving forward I will look for love, I will spread more love, and I will wipe these tears off of my face. Thank you Adriene, your videos really are life changing.",Kimberly Loftus,2020-01-13T06:35:22Z,4

Adriene has helped me come to this realization that seriousness without softness doesn&#39;t always work. I know this practice is gonna help me get closer to my goal of nurturing discipline.
