"The hardest lesson for me still is cutting through the inner voice of striving for perfection against my wobbly stomach and wonky left leg!  I love the lesson that it is self love, the journey, acceptance that are the goals and  this is much harder than any &#39;perfect post&#39; to achieve for me.  Goes against all we are exposed to for most of our lives - acceptance that your journey is the perfect one.",anna chipch,2021-01-09T10:26:05Z,1

"I am truly thankful for you and for your videos. No matter what kind of day I&#39;m having they always leave me feeling better than I started. After day 9&#39;s practice, I am left feeling proud of myself. In the past, I have been amotivated when it comes to physical activity. Yoga (specifically your practices) has helped me to become intrinsically motivated to tend to my physical (and mental) body. Unfortunately, as a 21-year old I have lots of joint issues (most likely due to high school sports), but your videos have helped me to gain strength (physically and mentally) and I am noticing such an improvement already after having done your videos for a little over 2 months. So again, I am so grateful for the time and effort you put into these videos and the incredible attitude and energy you bring with them.",Kaitlyn Tracey,2020-12-06T00:46:25Z,0

"Started these 30 days during a holiday and I notice how distracted I was yesterday and today as my days were full of work and related questions. I wanted to make room for the yoga video for today because I set myself the challenge to make it, no matter what and I am asking myself if it was better to skip one day and really mean it or to do it however distracted I am. I guess the latter works for me because a) the continuity gives me a security and a chance to hope tomorrow will be different and b) as you pointed out - it is about inquiry and about learning about myself. Why am I distracted? What keeps me from granting myself the time for yoga? Am I maybe also a little rebellious? I feel a little rebellion in me, as in &quot;I did yoga for 8 days now, can&#39;t I have a day to rest?&quot;...

"In my 2nd round of 30 days and loving it. Ive only started yoga on my pregnancy the did the baby yoga and had to wait almost 3 years to do it again. I never had the time, now I wake up at 06h30 and do a class before starting to work. The best part of these classes is I love them, they feel natural so for a change I&#39;ve found a routine I&#39;m seeing myself keeping daily even if we ever go back to 2019 normal standards.

"This is my first experience with yoga.  Had thought about it for the past year, but it took the quarantine to get me focused.  So many people from my work and church were talking about Adriene and what they were getting from the 30 Days.  Indeed, I kept hearing her name over and over.  Now I know why so many people have come to yoga practice through a teacher like this.  What a joy Adriene is.  I&#39;m a teacher, so I enjoy watching another pro with such passion!",Bradden Weaver,2020-06-08T04:11:33Z,1

WHY is downward dog so difficult!!!,Ellen Cosgrove,2020-04-09T12:44:24Z,0
"I am not a yoga teacher but I do care a great deal about mobility. If it is extra difficult and you feel a deep stretch in the  heel cords and or hamstrings, you could get a lacrosse ball, sit on it  and smash out the restricted tissues in the booty and the hamstrings working down to the heel cord and calf area for about 10-15 minutes before your yoga practice, this helps to feed slack into the tissues (it hurts like crazy but you learn to yoga breathe and deal). Once the tissues are less restricted you can sink deeper into this pose, and once there chill out in a heel cord stretch pose like down dog  for about 8 min to cause real long lasting tissue change. The science supports 8 mins a KEY Doing this Physical Therapy practice has led me to label it Super Yoga as it allowed me to make tremendous gains in a relatively short time. Hope that helps.",David Spies,2020-04-11T14:43:45Z,0

"In high school, I used to do color guard, and I was decently flexible. I&#39;m twenty-one now, and honestly I thought that flexibility was gone. I couldn&#39;t even touch my toes before I started the home program. I was always tight and holding so much tension in my muscles, but, man, after nine days, I&#39;m already seeing such an improvement in my flexibility. With my feet together, I can fully put my palms down onto the ground in forward fold. My feet are close to  being able to press into the ground in down dog. I can put both legs up quite high in three-legged down dog. This is heckin&#39; crazy. I can also feel myself growing stronger to. I held myself up in chaturanga which I&#39;ve never been able to do. I&#39;ve been doing crow practice, too, and I was able to hold it for about five seconds today. I feel so much more connected to my body than ever before, and I still have so much room to grow.

Doing this during  this during the Covid-19 lockdown in Vienna. I skipped two days on which I did other workouts but came back here again today :) oh... is it just me that starts yawning everytime I take a deep breath?

"Hello again! I have to admit that I left my yoga practice behind for a while. In fact, this session was the last that I had (spoiler alert: it didn&#39;t go very well). But, between all the anxiety and craziness of the last couple of weeks, I decided it was time to reconnect with it, as part of a new routine system I&#39;m trying to create for myself (anxiety is hitting very hard, believe me). So, here I am, coming back, redoing this session, and trying to find what feels good during this whole pandemic-quarantine-self isolation-lockdown situation. Some true revelations about myself and my practice came out from this, btw 😁. I hope you all are finding the peace you need. Stay safe. Namaste 🙏.",Kristina D'Antonio,2020-03-30T12:19:50Z,0

"Good morning,  after recent world events that have taken over, ( COVID-19) , yet another blip in missing yoga days.<br />Although our families are isolating, Mothers Day is here upon us and celebrating in different ways.<br />Mine was a lovely long walk followed by, Yoga sessions 7, 8 and 9. Feeling stretched, warm and slightly smug😊.<br />Oh, and unfortunately the hair salon where I work is now closed for business until further notice to protect our employees and clients alike. Very sad time.  But will make the most of your Yoga Adrienne. I 🙏 stay well and safe !",SUE HARPER,2020-03-22T09:58:45Z,0

"I deal with neck and back pain most of the time due to stress, and these practices have been helping a lot. However, today was the first time in a long time that I laid on my back so relaxed that I couldn&#39;t feel any pain or discomfort AT ALL. I couldn&#39;t believe it.

"&quot;you know when you&#39;re doing it right.&quot; that sentence concluded my night yoga and i have never felt more stretched! i got a good feeling on my lower back and hip parts so i am more comfortable sitting down now. it is refreshing that this self-study is truly not aiming for you to be always right, but it is aiming for you to do what feels right for you. I&#39;ll admit that my balance is getting better from the 3-legged downward dogs and it gave me the confidence to continue this journey. thank you Adriene!",Mica,2020-03-21T15:33:29Z,0

I’ve been finding myself in patterns of negative thoughts, but today with your “love cave” comment really hit home. I was so annoyed that my baggy shirt was falling in my face during practice that I purposefully started wearing tighter tank tops. You truly helped me to see that small adjustments in my mindset (literally from annoyance to love) can make all the difference, so thank you so much!",Shantae Choubey,2020-03-20T06:06:16Z,0

"“When you go out into the woods, and you look at trees, you see all these different trees. And some of them are bent, and some of them are straight, and some of them are evergreens, and some of them are whatever. And you look at the tree and you allow it. You see why it is the way it is. You sort of understand that it didn’t get enough light, and so it turned that way. And you don’t get all emotional about it. You just allow it. You appreciate the tree.<br /><br />The minute you get near humans, you lose all that. And you are constantly saying ‘You are too this, or I’m too this.’ That judgment mind comes in. And so I practice turning people into trees. Which means appreciating them just the way they are.”<br /><br /><br />― Ram Dass",Rob Coulter,2020-03-18T16:08:48Z,383

"Hi Cserei! In general, most women are able to continue a regular practice through month eight if they avoid twists below the neck, core activation and anything on the belly. Most will find they will know when something isn&#39;t right. Hip openers are good but go easier in third trimester. Modify core breaks with reclined cobbler&#39;s pose, modify belly stuff with child&#39;s pose or yogi&#39;s squat and modify standing twists with wide-legged forward fold. As always, consult your doctor/physician before starting and follow their advice. xx",Yoga With Adriene,2020-02-19T17:28:28Z,0

I had a question, my right wrist is hurting a bit - i&#39;ve always had weak wrists especially my right wrist, but i never put pressure on them so never usually feel a discomfort. What can i do to healthily do yoga and strengthen my wrists rather than do any damage? I&#39;m 31, healthy.  Thank you. Namaste x",kimberley wright,2020-02-07T08:43:20Z,0

Namaste family. Today I sat on the mat with a really painful lower back and couldn&#39;t sit cross legged for long without collapsing my heart space. At the end of the session I am feeling grounded and supported. I need to incorporate a night asana before bed because most of the time I wake up with a painful body. <br />The journey continues....<br />Blessed day to all,Mmabatho Motlhako,2020-02-06T04:59:36Z,0

"Now completing Home - Day 9 - Inquire.  9:56 pm Mon Jan 27 2020.  Am noticing progress not perfection.  The Chair is helping me with Downward Dogs!  I commit to doing this DAILY until I complete all 30 days of Home!  I have been skipping days.  I have a lot of daily or frequent practices!  I have my own business, and walking is my main mode of transportation.",GoddessLinda1,2020-01-28T05:58:06Z,0
"A nagging concern if I&#39;m doing it right - yep, this is me all the time! <br />I get caught out with these knowing comments in every practice - I swear my mind is being read 😂 exactly the right thing is said that makes me feel better and okay about how I&#39;m thinking/feeling too 💙",Antonia Collings,2020-01-27T21:16:55Z,0
Let me be completely honest to you: I have commitment issues. At the beginning of this journey I was full of motivation and joy. <br />I was sure that I&#39;d follow the journey and do each practice accordingly without skipping any. A few days later I told myself it&#39;s okay not to pressure myself to follow the practices strictly and do them every day. So sometimes I did two practices and sometimes I did none. Now I feel terrible due to my lack of discipline.<br /><br />A whole lot has happened in a few days and I&#39;ve been overwhelmed by all the unrest and tension in my mind and body. There always appears the thought that if I&#39;d followed your practices and if I&#39;d done one every day it wouldn&#39;t be that bad.<br />My mum told me that I&#39;d looked after my body but not my soul and she&#39;s absolutely right. I tend to have self destructive behaviour a lot. Doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m hurting myself physically and/or intentionally but I feel like there&#39;s a voice in my head that doesn&#39;t want me to be happy. <br />The weirdest thing is that I do know what I need to do in order to feel better but most of the time I can&#39;t and I just don&#39;t know why. <br />Hopefully I can find some peace though your practices. They&#39;ve worked before but still I can&#39;t expect them to be the magic remedy to all of my problems. There simply is none and the only thing that can help me is to solve it myself. People always tell me the same stuff over and over again but they&#39;re right: they can only support me while I need to find peace within myself on my own. <br /><br />Still I want to thank you again for all the love you express in your practices. I&#39;ve already learned a lot through you while you&#39;ve also helped me through some tough and dark times. This is just another rainy season that&#39;s going to pass. <br /><br />&quot;The rain hardens the ground&quot;.,BeyondTheBop,2020-01-27T21:09:46Z,46

I felt very different. <br />I was focus on the quality of move ,not just hitting a pose.<br />I felt free to do the adjustment my body needed<br />I push myself as much as I wanted that day <br />I was carefree to improvise and listen to what my body was saying to me <br />I used the class as I do with you as a guide not a rule <br /><br />I must thank you for that cause doing things at home gave me the freedom to explore and now I am very happy when it happens in a share space to explore and experiment .<br /><br />Just wanted to share this experience with you <br />Xx",Paul Oyamburu,2020-01-26T13:18:04Z,0

"Hi Adriene, <br />I have been loving your videos particularly because I have a hearing loss and can access the captions. <br />Today, day 9 does not have captions embedded. There is an automatic captions option but it is not as easy to watch as the captions from days 1-8. Thank you to you and your team for including captions in these videos. It has made such a HUGE difference to my experience.",Alina Houghton,2020-01-17T08:26:23Z,0

"Day 9 was fantastic! I noticed tonight that bringing the knee in from 3 legged dog was a lot more controlled. It was hard  though! Especially bringing each knee up to the elbows! At the same time, I do feel so much stronger ❤",Anjee Campbell,2020-01-17T04:26:16Z,0

I did not feel fine when I started this practice. Anxty after a day cooped up with Eeyore weather and cranky kids. I feel so wonderful after this practice. It wiped the anxty away and reminded me why I keep coming back to the mat and to a Adriene. Thank you for this practice it was the perfect remedy.,KoniecznyFamily,2020-01-17T00:40:19Z,0

"This practice, I finally started letting my inner teacher guide and the breathwork followed.

"Today i felt more aware of my left &amp; right and being at the center. As you said how different they are and the moment you focuse both sides each, i felt which parts that i need to work on. You are really amazing Adriene💕 you say the right word at the right moment and my whole perception changes right that moment. I am so thankfull for your guidance. Its been nearly 4 years since i started yoga. At the beginnig i went to a yoga class for a few months but that class happened to be over and i keep continue with at home practise with you. I hardly can discipline myself but i keep on doing. Your way of teaching is attrackting with me in a lot of ways. Not to worry and most importantly being gentle with myself. When doing yoga, it is so amazing how you discover small things right that moment that leading to impprtant changes and illuminations.

"Dishes! Groceries! Appointments! Oh my! I was SO distracted this practice and almost left the mat. I am a few days behind and my mind is so busy. But I’m here. And collectively I experienced 3 minutes of blissful connection to my hot self-teacher! That is doing it right, even though I was telling myself I was doing it all wrong.

I remember when I started ywa series a few months ago and I couldn&#39;t touch any knees to elbows. Eventually my knee could &quot;kiss&quot; the elbow on the same side. And today was the first time I could &quot;kiss&quot; the opposite elbows too. I love this kind of growth and progress!,Nicole Letourneux,2020-11-09T19:52:47Z,1

I am not anchored through the heel as Adriene says. Should I continue to do that (and feel my calf stretching instead of feeling anchored), or would it be better to get down on one knee?

So needed this tonight. Really busy and stressful day at work and normally i would have come home and slumped. I had to force myself to get my mat out and so glad i did. I think i may have hurt my knee doing pigeon though! Oops! it is so nice doing this at home and not having to worry about what anyone else is doing and having as much space as i need for myself. Really proud of myself that i have got to day 9 with only one day off. I have one question though and wonder if anyone can help. When i am in high lunge and am up on back foot I tend to get a lot of pain at the top of my right foot. Bit worried that maybe i shouldn&#39;t be doing it. Is there an adjustment i could make?,Anne,2020-01-13T22:01:53Z,0

"Honestly feels like this practice was just perfect for my day today. I&#39;m on a business trip, in a hotel room at night and working with strangers during the day. It has been so challenging but I feel like my inner teacher is thriving right now as she uses this opportunity to help me see this situation for what it truly is. This flow cultivated beautiful energy within my body and provided a greeeeaaat stretch in the glutes (thanks pigeon). Also, don&#39;t know if you&#39;re into compliments based on physical appearance but, your booty is goals. I appreciate it hahaha. Thanks again Adriene &lt;3",Liandra Kirchner,2020-01-12T10:33:34Z,0

"I had a cut at a finger today, which meant I couldn&#39;t use it; spreading the fingertips for the force and the downward dog was a bit more complicated than usual, it was hard for me to find my balance. So for me, today&#39;s lesson is that every part of the body, even the tiniest, is essential to our balance. It may seem obvious, but I&#39;m glad I realised it. <br />Awesome work as always, Adriene! ♡",OcarinaMystique,2020-01-11T23:38:35Z,1

And I want to exude love as purely as I can while I am fortunate enough to be in this flesh vessel.

"I started practicing Yoga with Adriene 41 days ago. (I did the original 30 days of yoga and an individual video before starting Home.) At that time I had been away from yoga for at least a year. I felt very stiff and not in tune with my body at all. Now I am noticing my movements throughout the day are effortless and pain free. Even though my intention for the practice is to accept what I can do today, I find my heels coming lower in downward dog, and my easy pose is much easier. So when you said &#39;creaky body&#39; today it made me smile with recognition. Very grateful for this practice. &lt;3",Kelly Savastano,2020-01-11T16:53:35Z,0

"I&#39;ve been allowing Adriene to lead my yoga practice for roughly four years now and I swear... we are in sync. I naturally tend to flow/shift/breathe to her next step/sequence before she announces it! Not to mention the theme of each practice magically comes to my rescue to solve the day&#39;s needs. It could be coincidence, or muscle memory from my experience with her. But I&#39;d like to think a subconscious and spiritual part of the practice connects us as well. Thank you, Adriene.

"I broke my spine about four years ago and had to learn to walk again. I couldn’t put on my own socks or pants or clip my toenails or bend down or lift anything. I’ve got a lot of metal in my back and it gets sore very quick. I noticed that with a regular yoga practice I don’t have pain in my lower back like I usually do, I can walk for longer without pain, and I can (and this is important to me) put on socks without having to sit down, just balancing on one foot. These things are amazing to experience after years of mild pain all the time and having to make adjustments. My back feels warm and steady. Not to mention the peace I feel knowing I’m taking care of my body and preventing more pain as I get older. Thank you Adriene, I appreciate what you do so much! It’s changed my life!

The titles of your videos in this program are all verbs, each to call in to action our self love. Yesterday I haven&#39;t been loving myself much, but I showed up on the mat still. I was unsatisfied after, not at ease with myself. But then, today, while drinking tea and eating fruits, I was wondering what verb would you call day 10 (the one I am into), so that made me remember of all the ones that are: inquire, ignite, recognize, heal etc. and then it struck me: love is a verb. You have to let that love call you into action. It is a practice, it is a natural yet forgotten state, I sense it deep in my soul. You and the practice of yoga (and any kind of self love) is showing us the way to ourselves by activating Love through verbs. Thank you. Words do matter. Prayers do have an effect. It&#39;s beautiful.",Hélène Juan de Mendoza,2020-01-11T06:02:41Z,0

"Okay, I missed yesterday because I was really really depressed and I only slept because I couldn&#39;t got up from the bed, and I almost missed day 9 too because the sleep that I was feeling, but now at night I couldn&#39;t sleep and got up to do yoga instead of be in my head with bad thoughts. The thing is that I am passing through the end of an abusive relationship, and girl, when you said &quot;you know when you are doing it right&quot;, I felt it. Because even though I have lost some friends, and sometimes I believe when he says that I am crazy. We know when we do it right. And yeah, I am crying since you said that in the video.

"Did day 9 at 8 p.m. a little late.. and loved it! I took a late aft nap after a hella busy day and woke up feeling groggy and weird. This 25ish minute yoga journey brought me back to awake and aware... think I might&#39;ve &quot;closed the gap to how we feel and how we want to feel&quot;. More present and clear. Gonna be up late though cuz I overnapped.... also has anyone else worn a loose shirt, creating a little cave to peer into while in downward dog or plank? Thank you, Adriene!  I do this all the time at home.. without a bra... hello boobs! :D :D Feel much better now. So wonderful to share this practice with everyone, even though it&#39;s night time.

To the more experienced Yogi&#39;s; I am finding myself drifting off and not staying present when I do the practice at night. Any advice?,Rea Mills,2020-01-11T01:54:04Z,3

"I would call myself a middle experienced Yogi, but I know your problem well. A lot of reason could lead to not being present in the pratice, so I will just list some ideas of what may help and with what you can expiriment: <br />1. Is it maybe not the &quot;right&quot; time for you. Maybe try different times, if possible and see what difference they make for you.<br />2. The breath. I took me some time to get it and to get to know myself better. When I drift off know in the practice, I try to concentrate more on the breath, then on what my body has to do (does not always work, but helps). This needs practice, I think, at some days it will work awesome and others my head just runs away. <br />3. Take your time before the practice to really be present. Maybe pause the video at the beginning at just take more time to arrive. Don&#39;t judge yourself at days were you need more time, it is part of yoga to aknowladge how you feel. <br /><br />And the most importent thing, I think is: at some days my mind just is not present and sometimes I&#39;m not able to change that. I still do the practice than, even tho it doesn&#39;t feel as good as when I&#39;m really present. But that&#39;s sometimes how it is, like a bad day. At least I can be proud, that I did my pracitce, something for my mind and body. So listen to yourself (sounds so easy, is so damn hard) , find out what helps and don&#39;t go to hard on yourself, if it doesn&#39;t work sometimes.<br /><br />Hope some of this helps!",Swandi,2020-10-02T12:26:19Z,1

"Yet another amazing practice! Chauncey, my ferret, joined me yet again today. This is his third practice with me, and I love having him by my side doing yoga. Yesterdays practice put me right to sleep after, however during was a different story. I wore baggy pants, which Chauncey thought was a little tube, so he ended up crawling into my pant leg as I was folding myself over my pillow. My mom heard me laughing and questioned what I was doing during my yoga session. Today, Chauncey was even more playful so I had to put in some extra work by lifting my opposite hand while doing the three legged dog to play with him. It was worth it because hes all tuckered out and had a blast. I think yoga with Adriene and Chauncey has become part of my new routine",Madeleine Carey,2020-01-11T01:51:48Z,0

"The pigeon pose is beautiful, I really liked how I felt with this practice. The thing that intrigues me the most is the smoothness of your transitions from pose to pose, it is hard to achieve! <br />Today I felt very angry, I had a little gathering I decided to not attend because I felt nervous of the things going on at my house that I felt responsible of and just stayed with that torned feeling of being in all my right to go out and enjoy with friends but not feeling secure enough to leave everything on it&#39;s own. I blamed lots of people during this processing of feeling, and I kind of know it&#39;s not because of them... it just felt like I was going to get in trouble if I wasn&#39;t supervising here at home, I was not confident enough nor trusting enough to do so. This was a lovely time to let it go and then reflect a bit with a clearer mind. Thank you!",Celichan905,2020-01-11T01:15:47Z,0

after the first three legged dog i almost stopped the video because i had just completed a leg workout and my leg was too tired to lift as high as i am used to. i&#39;m glad i stuck with it though because i finally understood what it means to listen to my body. what felt good in this case was not lifting my leg as high as physically possible and i definitely found some humility in my practice today.,Meghan Maulucci,2020-01-11T00:37:09Z,0

"It never stops amazing me how much choosing to meet our appropriate edge and inquire how far or how much we are willing to give and put into postures really changes the quality of the action and of the practice all together. The thing is that we know these things cause Adriene u always keep reminding and encouraging us with It but some times we forget or a mood or the days evens affects us and we get on the mat and blow through the practice and it&#39;s not as good as it would have been if we had centered and really dive into the practice, don&#39;t get me wrong I know that everyday I&#39;d different and some days are so much harder than other and it&#39;s not easy but it&#39;s practices like these that help is return to our foundation and reminds us why we come to the mat everyday to practice.

"That was lovely and just what I needed. Am snatching my practice in between my niece’s naps, who I am looking after which is totally perfect.

"Day 9 complete! I worried slightly that I wasn&#39;t doing my absolute best at yoga and wasn&#39;t doing all the poses to the fullest difficulty and I had a sort of revelation after this practice - Half assing your yoga practice is still more yoga and more beneficial than not doing any yoga at all. I&#39;m hoping this is just side effects of having my period and that I&#39;ll be as eager as I was days 1-7 <br />But yeah, even if I pause for little bits to rest or get a drink or roll my wrists, if I complete the practice even while feeling all that negativity, I&#39;ll have completed 25 minutes of yoga as opposed to 0 and giving into the negativity",Emily Gleeson,2020-01-11T00:12:56Z,0

"Thank you for doing what you do here on YWA. I started last year with Dedicate and pretty near cried my way through the first seven days and then skipped day 8 only to learn it was that beautiful relaxed practice. It felt better to try than not try so I kept at it fairly regularly all through 2019.  Earlier this week I realized I can do sukhasana, which surprised me and today, today, I could do pigeon.  First time in ten years, I could do that. I also stayed physically healthy all year, no physio! First time in years for that, too. Much better than all that, though, is listening to your encouraging, positive energy and learning from it. I&#39;m a kinder, more open person after hours and hours of breathing and being with Benji and Adriene and the quiet cameraman:) Thank you for making such a restorative practice available to so many people!",M G,2020-01-11T00:03:24Z,0

I really enjoyed today&#39;s practice.  Already I&#39;m noticing a loosening of the muscles. My heels are getting closer to the ground in 3 legged dog.  I&#39;m finding it easier to reach the elbows when drawing the knees forward. And the tightness in my inner thigh that&#39;s preventing my left leg being able to sit comfortably cross-legged seems to be easing.

"Great practice. I found myself rolling my eyes and fidgeting and not listening to her at the open of the session. Then she contorted me, raised my heart rate and made me appreciate a chance to rest a little more. At the end of the session when she was closing things out with her final thoughts I found myself right there with her.<br /><br />It&#39;s kinda special how much your attitude can be adjusted in fifteen minutes.<br /><br />I do enjoy these session with a little more heat. I can feel little promises of anger in some of my leg muscles already and I&#39;m happy to know they&#39;re getting some attention. I wish I knew how to activate my core a little more since I can&#39;t access it when she tells us to pull into it for certain poses/transition. That&#39;s on me though.",pendulousphallus,2020-01-10T23:30:06Z,0

So show up I did and guess what: my hips are very grateful for this routine. That&#39;s where tension tends to sit these days, it moved residence from the upper back and shoulder area.

"I&#39;ve been experiencing resistance these past couple days. HEAL was lovely, done in a dark room with the full moon above. I dozed off in savasana, then had a night of insomnia. I never have trouble sleeping, so it just threw me off-kilter. Some good came of it, but my energy was just...agitated, overall. <br /><br />Today, I approached getting on the mat as a &quot;checklist&quot; item, anticipating a lackluster practice, because I felt like I&#39;d gotten the day off on the wrong foot by waking up late. I did run before practice, so my muscles were warmed up, and actually, it all flowed incredibly well. I connected to my breath and my pigeon was on point, so I just put some attention on the fact that I had come to the mat with some ickiness. <br /><br /><br />aaaand I&#39;m about go FULL DEAR DIARY up in here, I can feel it coming - but I&#39;ll take the theme of inquiry as an invitation to feelings vom everywhere :) <br /><br /><br /><br />some of what I came to the mat with -- after I rode the &quot;SHINY NEW DECADE!&quot; energy into an auspicious beginning for 2020, I&#39;ve been slipping into some old habits...and it&#39;s only been a week! of course, the place to strive for is self-forgiveness -- but perhaps I was jumping there too quickly, without also acknowledging the (quote-unquote) negative emotions of disappointment and letting them exist. so that disappointment/ickiness ends up getting projected on to other areas (i.e. YWA) that I&#39;m subconsciously associating with transformation. (i.e. &quot;what is even the POINT, i shall forever languish as a useless BLOB&quot;) <br />and of course, with inquiry, we can choose to see our experience with curiosity. in regards to some of the &quot;old&quot; habits (a sticky, interconnected web of ego stories about procrastination, internet browsing/surfing + phone use, being a Productive and Useful Member of Society) -- yes, I don&#39;t want to be manipulated by the endless dopamine quest, but also, I did have the thought that maybe it can also be a signal that I&#39;m seeking connection in my life. I&#39;m quite independent, but I was traveling a lot for the first half of 2019, then resettled into a new city, where I&#39;m still getting on my feet, and...just. it&#39;s okay to feel some type of way. <br /><br />sigh. wherever you go there you are! <br /><br /><br /><br />I feel better with the opportunity to untangle some of these thoughts. writing this out for more public-facing consumption does encourage me towards clarity, rather than just purging everything through journaling, but maybe not necessarily critically engaging what&#39;s &quot;true.&quot; I feel like I&#39;ve mined some useful reminders for moving forward, as well - (1) process, not perfection; (2) let the negative &quot;be&quot; without judgment (3) take some time and space for gratitude + wins.. today, I ran longer than I ever have in my entire goddamn life! and it was done almost automatically. &amp; i&#39;m still here, documenting my journey! just a reminder that things ARE shifting and chang; celebrating the small wins will light the way. <br /><br />thank you, Adriene, for the invitation to inquiry, and to the YWA community for the space! namaste and see you tomorrow :)",Grace Kim,2020-01-10T23:01:28Z,4

Today felt a little bit like a losing battle. Feelings about my recent move hours away from family and friends and applying to more jobs with no word back yet. Insecurities and fears galore for this rainy Friday. Trying to find a million reasons to skip the practice today but none of them kept up with my need for something more. 26 minutes of yoga in interview clothes with a whining puppy over my shoulder (that very coincidentally couldn’t find his squeaker just as I was starting today’s practice) later and I have found the gratitude I needed for today. Making my new home while participating in Home seems very fitting recently. I hope everyone finds the peace they are seeking for today.,vixtoria elix,2020-01-10T21:37:18Z,0

I am, however, struggling to find and control my breath more than ever before most likely due to the extreme and continuing congestion, but also the mental challenges. I’m anxious and aimless.

"So here I am - really tired after a long week, with knees nagging because I did something wrong running. And I still went to the mat - and I can’t do pigeon “properly” because my hips are so tight. And I’m in tears of happiness and thankfulness. Because sukhasana is actually starting to be a little more easy. And my body is loving all the gentleness and attention. To say nothing of my soul. So thank you ever so much.",Svanhvit Reith,2020-01-10T20:34:36Z,0

"Had an aha moment yesterday off the mat about my struggle with perfectionism and how that shapes the way I live &amp; make decisions.

The 25 minutes passed and I couldn&#39;t believe it was over, my head was somewhere else. Still, I&#39;m happy I showed up on the mat, what matters is to be consistent, not perfect!

"Hello, I loved day 9. I had the worst morning as I was rushed to get a phone charger cause my phone stopped working. I came to the mat with lots of backround noise going on and I found myself easily surrendering to the moment. I was able to discover deeply and  For a second I could reach back and touch that toe while in pigeon pose. This is one of my favorite poses to do. Thank you!!",Amber Rose LOVE,2020-01-10T18:46:39Z,0
"&quot;I love you, body&quot; <b>gives it a kiss</b> haha, that was sweet! I did not pay too much attention to my breathing, today, which might be why I collapsed a few times. (ROOKIE MISTAKE. YUP!) I need to do things slow instead of going fast or at a quicker pace than I should. No wonder I can&#39;t keep up afterwards! The energy flow felt great, as always. The latter can feel like too much for me at times <del>it can turn into cardio that I didn&#39;t welcome in</del> but I always get excited when I feel that rush. The bent knee felt like a happy, peaceful breeze on my right side rather than on the left. Probably because I didn&#39;t prepare my body well on the left side, since my abs weren&#39;t really squeezed in. Other than that, I loved the pigeon pose which was perfect at the end of the practice.<br /><br /><br />Also, the love cave when in downward dog kinda pisses me off haha.

"Today was a surprise to me. I had a traumatic childhood: alcoholic parents, absent drug addicted dad, poor living conditions, neglect and emotional abuse. I spent my early twenties trying to drink my way out of the pain. Spoiler: it didn’t work. About eleven years ago, I tried to kill myself. After that I began the long hard journey to true recovery and healing: through therapy, exercise, yoga and meditation. Ive come so far from where I started and I feel strong and contended almost every day. Because of that strength I am now more equipped to process some of the pain from my childhood and today it emerged on the mat, there for me to observe and feel, to accept and integrate. It’s amazing to me that it is becoming something I no longer have to run from. But it’s also scary because it’s something that almost destroyed me. Thank you for sharing your tools with us.

"Good morning all!  The zip, zap, zop reference in Day 6 and the the emphasis on being honest with what is present encouraged me to take a leap and share this link in case anyone in the YWA community wants to engage in a random act of kindness by donating or sharing: <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-a-lesotho-doctor-with-medical-expenses?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&amp;fbclid=IwAR270rEiWxlL0Xsj87HtbC6C6FggucpqKwsajMMyTV9phIELoLLqsog1H-c"">https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-a-lesotho-doctor-with-medical-expenses?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&amp;fbclid=IwAR270rEiWxlL0Xsj87HtbC6C6FggucpqKwsajMMyTV9phIELoLLqsog1H-c</a><br /><br /><br />I work as a teacher and mentor in a family medicine training program in the southern African country of Lesotho. In a country where there is only 1 doctor for every 15,000 people, our trainees have an incredible opportunity to serve their community and make a huge impact. Unfortunately one of our kind, funny, skillful trainees, Dr Mac, was found to have a mass in his esophagus which is likely early cancer. He and his family are struggling with the expenses associated with diagnosis and treatment, largely b/c since these serves are not available in Lesotho and he must travel to South Africa for this healing journey.  We use &quot;zip zap zop&quot; as a energizer practice during our teaching sessions (Dr Mac is pretty good at it!) which was why Day 6 reminded me of him during my practice.  I apologize if this is not the appropriate forum but we are all just a few degrees of separation (or no degrees at all of separation in some ways) from eachother and I figured I&#39;d take a risk and share here in this new community I&#39;m happy to be a part of. <br /><br /><br />Happy day 9 all!",Chelsea McGuire,2020-01-10T15:37:32Z,0

I focus my mind on things like meditation, yoga, healing foods, avoiding toxic energy (people, busy places), and loud sounds/musics. Your yoga series is something I look forward to that really helps to ground my mind and my body for the day. I feel that my body is being challenged (stretched and worked) while at the same time the focus is really on connecting my mind to my body with deep breathing. Thank you so much for this series.

"I had an awesome a-ha moment mid-pigeon pose! I was telling myself to breathe through the pain. &quot;Pain is just a feeling. You just breathe through it... feel it all... let it stretch your muscle and at some point it&#39;ll be over.&quot; And I immediately recognised the parallel in our every day emotional pain! If we breathe through what ever it is we&#39;re going through, feel it all, let the pain do what it needs to do... eventually it will dissipate. We&#39;ll inevitably stretch ourselves and become better equipped and more flexible in life. It&#39;s one and the same! Thanks Adriene - these videos are giving me such peace every day.

"My mom, twin sister and I are all on this yoga journey together. I thought I’d share with y’all the text I sent them this morning! <br />I just finished day 9.

Often through transitions to different poses and how I can play with that to not feel this automatic « brace yourself for knee pain » reaction when I go through a pose I’ve felt knee pain in previously but instead always be present to modify as needed since my knees always need different things lol. <br /><br />Thanks for the opportunity to inquire Adrienne :)",Danie Harris,2020-01-10T13:05:15Z,1

"I&#39;m kind of repeating myself in these comments, but what can I say, it was another amazing practice and so much fun! I loved it ♡ And I just gotta mention two really funny coincidences (or maybe not coincidences? ;)) I was wearing a rather baggy sweater to this practice and it came sliding forward in downward dog and I was just thinking how I kinda like that feeling and then you made that comment on the love cave, so that made me smile :) Also, halfway through the video I noticed your white nail polish and I put on white nail polish just this morning (and I rarely ever paint my nails white), so that was kinda cool :)",Alena669,2020-01-10T10:02:27Z,0

"Loved hearing that comment about the worries around home practice and whether I’m doing things right. I’ve never done a class...just started with YWA in September and flowing with it. I’ve been debating doing a class because of just this worry. But hearing “you know, you know when you’re doing it right” was so affirming. I figure, if it feels good while I’m doing it (even if it is hard 🙃), and it feels good afterwards, I can’t be doing too much wrong 🥰🥰🥰",Helen Brunner,2020-01-10T09:17:52Z,1

I found that more difficult today especially at the beginning. At one point I could even feel a few tears. However with awareness I know my body is already doing a lot more than I thought  possible so early in my practice and that feels good. I now feel a sense of achievement that I am still practicing every day and that I am learning to be aware of my body as I move it. I am definitely feeling more connected with my own body. Thank you Adriene. Have a great day everyone. Namaste xx,Karen Lynne,2020-01-10T08:17:36Z,0

"Day 9 - Inquire! I noticed during the poses where strength or balance is required I kept saying to myself, I can&#39;t do this! This of course led to me not being able to do it. So I tried to focus more on your voice, on my breathing and saying to myself just do this! And boom, I did it! It seems like I am very insecure about my own abilities, which is making me to be my own demon. How about that? This gives me a lot to think about, cause I&#39;m seriously confused to why I am doing this. It&#39;s basically self sabotage and that&#39;s just stupid. Anyone else sitting in the same boat?

"I loved today! Been feeling older in my body even though im young because of my spinal condition flaring up, this practice reminded me that I&#39;m still strong even when I don&#39;t feel like it. Really warm and fuzzy now 🥰 thanks so much Adriene. Namaste to you all 🙏♥️",Roanna Kowal,2020-01-10T06:31:19Z,47
"@Amy Cuaresma hi Amy, thankfully I am not considered a candidate for surgery and I wouldn&#39;t be willing to move forward with it even if it were offered to me. I am even hesitant to accept the offer of steroid injections in my spine to be honest. Thanks for your input :) sending you love and light too 🌈✨",Roanna Kowal,2020-01-11T08:46:17Z,0
@Caitlin Adair it wasn&#39;t my intention to suggest older people can&#39;t be strong :) I hope to be strong as you are and still practicing when im 70 too!,Roanna Kowal,2020-01-11T08:43:03Z,1
"Thank you for sharing this information so freely.<br /><br /> I&#39;m not sure what your diagnosis is, but I have degenerative  disc disease in my neck and as an RN, who works in orthopedic surgery, let me tell you that for myself surgery is never going to be an option. Having my joints fused together will only impede mobility and isn&#39;t worth the risk.   Degenerative means degenerative, fussing my spine together won&#39;t cure the arthritic degenerative changes every human being alive experiences. All adult humans have spinal degenerative changes, generally 50 and over but many as early as 20s and 30s. And all spinal decompression and fusion procedures are considered elective until a patient faces loss of bowel or bladder functioning, or is  facing paralysis or loss of strength.  Until one of those happens on me  nobody will be operating on my spine. &quot;Friends don&#39;t let friends get fusion&#39;s&quot; is what we half jokingly say to one another at work. <br /><br />Adriene&#39;s content is perfectly suited for any level of fitness. I have to adjust alot of the the positions where we look straight up and or Cobra. I hope you know I am sending you love and light 🕉️ namaste",Amy Cuaresma,2020-01-10T23:10:19Z,1
"Roanna, it is possible to be old AND strong! I am 70. Strong and flexible, perhaps as strong as in my 30s?",Caitlin Adair,2020-01-10T18:24:59Z,2

"@Maude Matte good to know this news from u. thx for sharing otherwise i wouldn&#39;t know. thats why i dont buy and thats why i feel they are just strongly interested in PR and marketing for their brand instead of truly appreciate or understand what it means for yoga, meditation or mindfulness in general. it is so simple to spot a company if they are there for its people or use people for themselves. most of times, our instincts won&#39;t lie.",Linda Zhang,2020-01-12T02:08:07Z,0

"As we&#39;re now done with almost a third of this journey, i&#39;m beginning to ask myself the question:&quot;What is different about this moment compared to yesterday, or any other day?&quot; I hope to find my answer in this practice. My lower back is currently really cold and creaky. So far so good with the consistency in doing the practices. Thanks, Adriene for teaching me how to tune in deep within myself and enjoy doing it.
