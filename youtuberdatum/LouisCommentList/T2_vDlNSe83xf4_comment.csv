Oh PLEASE do not sacrifice your chance at recouping your money for the sake of the kickstarters getting to see it a touch early.

Wow ! Consider my mind scrambled !  Congratulations on so many levels. I greatly enjoyed the journey in the rough cut YouTube episodes and can&#39;t wait to see the polished version. I find it hard to believe that YouTube TV didn&#39;t want it for original content on their new platform ... seems like an obvious natural extension of the concept.
