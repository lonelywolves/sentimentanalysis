So if 15 million trees are destroyed a year. Then doing this type of thing 1-2 times a year will be adding 40 million trees a year. So 15-40 is remaining 25 million trees. So we would be adding 25 million trees a year! Why don’t we do this? If everyone in the us donated a dollar we could plant almost 400 million trees a year.
