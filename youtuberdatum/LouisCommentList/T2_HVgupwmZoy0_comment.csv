Shouldn&#39;t your battery boxes be pretty much water tight when you mount them below a car? Especially when you choose a HV motor?

"About 40% of California&#39;s electricity comes from fossil fuels. The carbon footprint of the batteries, motor and other parts is huge, so much so that a Tesla car on average takes 8 years to break even with a conventional car. Cobalt used in the lithium ion batteries is mined by child labour in Africa, and seriously impacts their health. Finally the aura of a VW van with its 4 pot boxer engine is being lost to posterity by vandalising it like this.
