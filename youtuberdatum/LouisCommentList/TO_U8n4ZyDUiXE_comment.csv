I just watched something on tv today about a real estate scam. People buy blocks of houses in a bundle and selling them off one by one but not all of the deeds are legit. Some of the houses in those bundles aren‚Äôt even for sale. They are basically selling peoples homes out from under them. This was in Detroit. So be wary üòí,Katie K,2019-08-11T17:55:52Z,0
