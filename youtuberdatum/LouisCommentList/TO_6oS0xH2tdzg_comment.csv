When you land on the elbow or bang it hard you may damage the bursa. It will swell up and eventually go down. When it does you may still have a misshapen elbow with chunks floating around and it may be sometimes awkward to lean on the table. I have done both in bike accidents and basketball and yes martial arts where I was losing the move. Never had surgery and they both feel fine. They may not be so photogenic in the future but unless it is a snake or spider bite in Canada they never did much for me. Fortunately I had medical coverage in Canada so no charge to me. I am not a doctor but listen pointy elbow I think you&#39;ll live. But run off and see and American Doctor but bring your wallet. They will probably want to do plastic surgery.

"Yeah that is a Olecranon Bursitis a elbow inflammation of the Bursa( latin for pocket/sack) this pocket contains synovial fluid to keep the joints nicely lubricated. When you overload your elbow (also very common on the knees) you body produce a lot of synovial fluid which is trapped in the bursa/pocket. The bump on it could be the firestarter  and if you sat a lot at the desk and rested the elbow joints on the desk, the joints/bursa got even more irritated which led to the inflammation and constant swelling.

Think it&#39;s olecranon bursitis. Basically it usually goes by itself. But you can get it like drained by a doctor. But even if you do it may refill. So it&#39;s just time really. But get it checked out anyway coz can&#39;t tell from just seeing it,Ethan Taberham,2019-03-06T22:00:28Z,2

Hi Louis! The thing on your elbow is bursitis! It can sometimes go away on its own...otherwise you&#39;ll have to get it drained and bandaged until the inflammation dies down. Peace!,Raemie Brown,2019-03-06T21:46:35Z,99

@damaris reid  not true. if the cause is removed (in this case trauma) it shouldn&#39;t return if left untreated to become chronic yes it can become chronically inflamed which is where it is an issue long term. if the cause is something in everyday life such as typing on a laptop and leaving on the elbow then yes it can become a problem but bursitis will often dissipate when it chooses to,Pixie Lale-Klasicki,2019-03-07T20:55:37Z,1

it will just take antibiotics i had that before its an infection mine went down by it self without medicine even tho the doc recommended antibiotics. draining it can actually make it worse the only time they drain it is if the antibiotics doesn&#39;t work and it keeps getting worse draining it leaves a big risk to make it worse,spearki,2019-03-09T18:41:33Z,1
