Hi Louis! Amazing job! But I think most of the credit for this should go to the Pilot who basically did all the work to make this possible. Your only job was to sit next to him and  put together the bunch of videos you took over the course of this journey. I hope the Pilots efforts are highlighted as you as the YouTuber took huge some of money from bunch of naive people promising early dvds etc. But still congratulations that you were finally able to finish this.,Nick Julian,2021-01-08T17:47:54Z,0
"G&#39;day from Australia! Any inside knowledge on when Discovery channel will have it available on Foxtel? I would love to see the final product, but signing up for yet another paid subscription service is something I would like to avoid. May just rewatch the YouTube series again instead!

"@showmoke I&#39;m not sure about what you say about the IP address. There are only so many to go around, so ISPs allocate them dynamically, unless you pay a premium for them not to do that. And if you use more than one provider, such as your home cable router and IP over your cell phone provider, would that not be an issue? What VPNs do is create a virtual &quot;tunnel&quot; that allocates you one of their &quot;local&quot; IP addresses, and I think that, because they are quite &quot;well known&quot; certain streaming services simply black list them.",Julian Idle,2021-01-11T23:21:02Z,0
"@Julian Idle Some online companies seem to know that you are using a VPN, for example most UK bookmakers. If your IP address is different to the one that they have in their records which they tie up with your email address, then when you activate your VPN, then their software will automatically block you access to their website, That may of course be the same as the online streaming companies, but I&#39;m not sure.",showmoke,2021-01-11T23:07:30Z,0
