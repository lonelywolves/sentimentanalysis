why not instead of cutting the small block   drill the holes in first so have a longer peice of metal easier to drill not to move  then  cut in to small blacks<br />would have thought  you put in place and have Jay double check before putting in place<br />at least if it messy  its in a place no one sees<br />how about making an electric boat  cant be as hard ???<br />???   you took the side back off to put the terminal connector on  it  just seems we make boxes then undo them over and over to fit the cables etc,David's World,2020-12-24T19:30:25Z,0

I have to wonder if they will fit some sort of skid plate to protect those delicate assemblies. Also, mounting directly to the chassis as such is going to subject the batteries to some unappreciated vibration and shock loads. It&#39;s not like these old buses have the supple suspension attributes of a modern Tesla. I know because I traveled extensively for years in a 1965 model in the early 70s.

You MUST research safety measures for using the tools you are using.<br /><br />The table saw without a guide after the blade is a serious risk of kickback. Cutting metal plates like that is a serious risk of having it flying in your direction at 100km/h and seriously injuring you, specially if you stand directly behind the blade.<br /><br />Welding, grinding and cutting without proper clothes is just wreck less.<br /><br />If you don’t care for yourself you should at least warn viewers in the beginning of each video that you are NOT following basic safety rules.",Ricardo Silva,2020-12-24T16:09:51Z,58

would after having all fitted be best to underseal or put some type of metal paint the whole area to aid in waterproofing <br />but you would think the when attaching the bottom sheet on there would be rubber washers to help stop water getting in via the bolt holes,David's World,2020-12-24T19:33:53Z,0
