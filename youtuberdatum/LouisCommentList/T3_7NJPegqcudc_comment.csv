"Years ago when I drove a Baja on the Oregon Dunes we&#39;d break CVs so often I&#39;d carry a spare set in my Baja every time I went out!  Changing CVs on the sand without getting sand in the grease is a challenge!<br /><br />I&#39;ve seen comments below saying you can use Drums brakes in the back <b>if</b> you set up your Regen.  I&#39;d still encourage you to go to four wheel disc brakes because:<br />1) Disc brakes are a simpler setup than drum brakes.  Much easier to diagnose, much easier to work on<br />2) Disc brakes don&#39;t need to travel as far as drum brakes do.  Much easier on your master cylinder, no need to worry about adjustment valves or boosters.<br />3) Disc brake pads are cheaper than drum pads!<br />4) Disc brakes are much easier to adjust than drum brakes.  Just tighten them until you can feel the wheel lose free spin and you&#39;re done!  No springs or clips to worry about.<br /><br />With your knowledge and experience, I think you&#39;d appreciate four wheel disc brakes better over time.  <br /><br />Also, all commercial EV vehicles have four wheel disc brakes... just sayin...",Craig Chatterton,2021-04-23T22:08:35Z,0

The brake servo that you wish to fit does not make the brakes better. What a brake servo does is allow the driver to use less pressure on the pedal and thus gives the impression of &quot;better&quot; brakes. All you need is some form of vacuum operated pump to work the servo. As soon as you mentioned the rear brakes locking up and overheating I knew straight away that it was the load-sender valve. Very common fault.,trevor deane,2021-04-13T21:02:35Z,0

"Dude, transforming such an old car to a modern powered by electric motor requires upgrading or at least checking and maintaining gearbox, breaks, drive train, suspension etc. Now in such powerfull car, completely different forces are at work. Therefore there will be some faults all the time. You shouldn&#39;t drive it until you maintain it. Also driving a fully electric car requires from you constant checking battery power level (I assume you have a gauge witch indicates it) and carefully plannig yor route from point A to B considering location of charging stations.

Second, you don&#39;t notice when your brake is braking while you are driving so that is causing heat. You need to be sure that is braking when it should, and also that is free when you don&#39;t brake.<br /><br />It causes lot problems yes, but that is prototype, once it&#39;s ready you know how to make a better one üòâ.

"After rebuilding the brakes and installing a new CV shaft:<br />1.  Replace the deleted brake proportioning valve. You&#39;ll get better braking performance with a good working one (about 60% of your braking should be up front)<br />2.  I would replace or at least repack the rear wheel bearings<br />3.  Replace the rear wheel studs<br />4.  Not drive around with brake shoes all the way backed off, they should be readjusted<br /><br />---I know it&#39;s a bit late, but I can give you a bit of a &quot;How to the why&quot; this happened.<br /><br />Drum brakes are effective when adjusted properly, but drums inherently do not dissipate heat as well as modern disc brakes.<br /><br />Heat is the enemy of braking force, wheel-bearings/cv shaft joint bearings and tires ;)<br />The stock brakes on a VW bus are already asked to do quite a lot for their purpose, but are sufficient for a stock bus.<br />A failed proportioning valve can cause all sorts of issues and pressure build-up in parts of the circuit.<br /><br />On setup: <br />Drum brakes require specific attention on setup and on initial installation to ensure correct location/drag/break-in/etc.<br />-Too tight, they drag and generate lots of heat and can seize<br />-Too loose, they&#39;re weak/spongy, they can bind up, generate lots of heat and can seize <br />-Too loose, the CAN even allow the wheel cylinder to push the piston straight out of the cylinder - losing all pressure<br />-Left to Right imbalance of adjustment can cause pulling while braking or over-working one-side and effectiveness is reduced<br /><br />Drum brakes without the automatic adjusters require regular adjustment as they wear in (not sure if yours had them)<br /><br />Brakes in general are prone to sticking/locking up after overheating, especially if any of the components warp.<br /><br />Likely reason for CV shaft failure and the smoking was dragging Brake Shoes:<br />The electric motor will produce enough torque to overcome the initial drag easily.<br />A little bit of heat will reduce the effectiveness of the brakes and/or cause gas build-up in the system (feeling spongey)<br /> <br />The &quot;snowballing&quot; of heat: <br />As heat builds up &quot;heat soaking&quot; the drum and bearings, it will cause the above, plus...  Can thin the grease enough to leak from the seals or even smoulder if hot enough in the hub and outer CV joint. Burnt-off/leaked grease reduces the ability of the bearings to stay lubricated, increasing heat &amp; wear and weakening them... This is how the grease, rubber seals, tires, etc can catch fire. <br /><br />Repeat this cycle enough or get it hot enough, the metal will anneal. Once cooled, combine the sticky brakes, weakened metal components and the torque from the electric motor, you can snap things super handy.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Ken (Busters Garage)",Busters Garage,2021-03-16T12:22:28Z,0

"Hello. Sorry about my bad english. But i think i had the same problem with brakes at the back some years ago. Sometimes they work fine but if i was using the &quot;handbrake&quot; the weels always geting hot. After i took a hammer and used it on the wheel/brakes it was possible to drive again. Sometimes it was heating up without using the handbrake on the highway. So i need to cool them down with water and use the hammer again.<br />Yes i i installed new brakeshoes, zylinder. And again the weels geting hot again.<br />But now they are working!<br />I changed the brake hose on both side at the back.<br />I changed them in 2008, my T2a Bus ist from 1971 (first brake hose i think).  I found some people in the internet wich was talking about the brake hose can swollen inside. So if you use the brake the fluid pushes the zylinder, but the spring force of the brakes at the back cant push the fluid back. After some days or using the hammer...it could push the fluid back till you use the break again.",mehrWissen Woller,2021-03-13T15:43:52Z,0

"When I was a young bloke I had a Cortina. My Dad decided to adjust the brakes. He adjusted them too far and they were on all the time. I drove into town and by the time I go there, my wheel was on fire, the rubber of my tyre was melting, and the brake pads were white ash. I ended up having to replace a ton of stuff all because Dad thought he could save some money. SO watching your massively torquy Tesla motor try to drive a wheel that was stopped by the brake pad, well first you break the drive shaft, then you cook the brakes. I feel for you. Keen to see this all sorted. I&#39;m ten minutes short of the end of the video, so I might be writing a comment prematurely.

"Louis, part of your regen problem is based on the pressure transducer that you have plumbed into the rear brake lines that are currently holding pressure. That same pressure is holding your brake shoes against your drums and creating friction(heat). Replumb the brakes, install the proper proportioning valve, install the proper master cylinder(no more interference with the draglink) and program the controller for regenerative braking. You can do the math for a manual master exchange, caliper volume, wheel cylinder volume verses master cylinder volume  and then correct the mechcanical advantage of the brake pedal to master cylinder. Disc/drum manual brake systems are not unheard of, Ghia, Super Beetle, Chevrolet Camaro, etc. Until you resolve the brake line residual pressure the transducer will never give you the proper voltage signal to control the regen braking. Don&#39;t forget to research the electric power steering conversion, it makes driving much better. Hope to see you soon.",Christopher Spicer,2021-02-28T23:46:15Z,0

What I watched from the video is that that connector is not crimped at all and it is really dangerous to leave such connections on the high voltage side.

I&#39;m not going to say exactly how it&#39;s done because there will be a lot of people in the gas industry that won&#39;t like what I&#39;m about to say<br />But if you at an alternator to your electric engine with a decent size pulley you can charge your vehicle  while you drive your vehicle which could increase your driving capabilities by a third or two times roughly and anyone who tries to go against it is going against the laws of electricity done by Nikola Tesla also the Tesla coil,LEO Selin,2021-02-27T18:21:30Z,0
Sorry for all the long list of things loctite goes a long way or if you don&#39;t have loctite you can also use nail polish and if you do that on all of those different bolts or as many bolts as you can find in that back area this will prevent it from slowly wiggling out,LEO Selin,2021-02-27T18:46:42Z,0
The only thing that I could say to look into for your brakes is look into getting rid of the drums and using the actual brake caliper and rotor setup but maybe something with lots of holes in it to keep air flow in that area<br />The other major downfall to those drums is heat so with the motor producing heat in that back area will in turn make things disintegrate so if you add brake calipers and rotors that have holes other across them that dissipates heat better also creates more air flow it&#39;ll just be a little bit more challenging when it comes to running brake lines or making adapters so that you can actually do that but I feel like at the same time it shouldn&#39;t be that hard to find inside of the Volkswagen community to do it,LEO Selin,2021-02-27T18:43:41Z,0
I&#39;d also recommend putting some solar panels on your vehicle but if you want to increase the power that it brings in in between each cell connect a nine volt battery and just strap it to the underneath your little 9-volt battery going to each cell which will increase the power to each solar panel which will in turn make it so that you have more power into your batteries in all Sun conditions,LEO Selin,2021-02-27T18:31:45Z,0

Just for future reference. DCP (powder) extinguishers are extremely damaging to electronic components. The powder is super fine and corrosive. It gets in everything and will slowly destroy electronics.<br />They are generally the best to carry in vehicles but I&#39;d consider a C02 in this thing.

"The brake bias compensator on the bay window was meant to reduce the front brake pressure under hard braking, when the nose dips down. The idea being that as you pushed the brake pedal harder, it would apply more braking force to the rear drums and make the braking safer and more even. Because they are so old now and no one knows how they work, they are rarely working correctly having siezed up or filled with gunk and stop working effectively. Either causing permanent rear brake bias or not evening out the force and making the nose dip and risking front wheel lock.",Neal F,2021-02-24T22:40:10Z,0

I‚Äôd put lots of solar panels on this van.,Russ Lewis,2021-02-24T16:47:02Z,18
The modules most likely are the old ones from Tesla. There are 16 modules with 5kWh each in the Model S 85. He fitted 12 of those so I think he has about 60kWh battery capacity by design. Usable capacity surely is lower as the batteries loose capacity with age and charge cycles. On top of that you might want to have a energy buffer. So I estimate about 50kWh useable capacity.<br /><br />By that I guess a highway range of (if not going too fast) of about 150km or 95 miles.,Torben R.,2021-03-14T15:47:55Z,1

@Norman Boyes my father had a VW bus when I was a kid. He can definitely get at least 3 panels up there. 3 times 365 is 1095w. That would be a trickle charge for those Tesla batteries but those PV panels would pay for themselves in no time then it‚Äôs free energy from the sun.,Russ Lewis,2021-02-25T20:09:31Z,2
"@Russ Lewis I bow to your superior knowledge - however on VW camper he might only get 2 full size panels on the roof and I do not know the capacity of his battery installation, but let‚Äôs say it was 40 KW/hr and required 30 KW to fully charge then, 2 panels will take about 4 days to charge it up.

You need a full disc conversion and I  also don&#39;t knowhow you drive but with the electric motor having you foot on the throttle at all while your braking will just light your breaks right up. Especially the drums they don&#39;t have anywhere near the friction to overcome the torque of the electric motor. Thats why you can drive through even sized brakes* should see if you can have a switch attached to the break that cuts power to the motor so there I no drive while you brake.
