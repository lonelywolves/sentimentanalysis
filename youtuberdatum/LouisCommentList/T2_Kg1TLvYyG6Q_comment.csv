"&quot;These vehicles are extremely unreliable and extremely difficult to maintain?&quot;<br />Well, You seem to have a pretty funny concept of &quot;unreliable&quot; and &quot;maintenance&quot;. The Bully, as the Bug, is dead easy to work on, engine gets out in an hour to work on it from all sides, and back in a bit over an hour again after proper work was done, engine is forced aircooled and has no problems whatsoever with everything that recurrently goes wrong in liquid cooled engines, undercarriage is straight parts (integral though) mostly, so repair welding and even building Your own repair paneling does basically need a straightedge, three to four clamps and a stable table only (besides pincers, a way to cut tin, and a couple hammers of course), and the common problem of &quot;recurrent breakdowns&quot; generally is an aftermath of no proper maintenance done for literal <i>decades</i> (while they still ride along well enough after those decades to sell &#39;em to keen buyers &#39;as is&#39;!) plus by far not enough knowledge and understanding in repair-shops when it comes to maintaining aircooled Boxer engines. <br />Anyway, Jehu Garcia&#39;s way of converting a Bully into Tesla-electric is a cool and budget route to get to an electric Super-Wagon You still can not buy on the market in this size and configuration because carmakers incomprehensibly do not produce anything alike.<br />I&#39;m all in when it comes to modernizations or conversions. <br />I have stark doubts, though, that Your reliability and usability went UP compared to a well restored/maintained Bully, in terms of ease of repair and remote places to reach (plus get back into civilization from there).",manfred schmalbach,2021-04-03T08:16:49Z,0

We have an actual Tesla and its range is 320 miles.

"@Duffs 9 It really depends on how much you drive and how long you keep the car for, but in most cases the electric one pollutes much less. No doubt that the production of an electric car is more carbon intensive but considering that each time you drive a gas car it pollutes much more than the production of electricity needed for an electric one, several studies have shown that after some time they are equivalent and after that point the electric one becomes much more sustainable",hugo pires,2020-12-13T15:56:22Z,1
