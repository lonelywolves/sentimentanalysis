What I need to know is how you get the video from the MAX with all the 360 effects to export to Youtube or other social media. I also need to know how user can interact with the video (the same way you can within the GoPro app) after exporting up to social media.,David Kurtz,2020-08-30T15:49:10Z,0

"The Go pro max not only serves as a fantastic action camera from what I can tell but also has other amazing uses, it has limitless uses outside of action, if you take into account those who want to sing and dance and can only do it out in there backyard, just take a tripod and slap it into the middle of the yard and you can do your dance videos without it being cut off screen.",YamiAnubisZX,2019-12-31T05:19:06Z,0

"Everyone thinks this stabilisation is so amazing, but it was the French company Parrot who pioneered this accellerometer based stabilisation back when they released the Parrot Bebop drone in 2014.. The drone used a 180 degree FOV fisheye lens and cropped within this view based on information received from the XYZ sensors.. You could turn the drone upside down and the view on your smartphone from the drone was still right-way-up and fully stabilised.. Take a look at this video recorded in 2014 with the Parrot drone, WITHOUT the use of a gimbal, using ONLY the fisheye lens - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPL60CEo_rk"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPL60CEo_rk</a>",Funkteon,2019-11-01T04:57:41Z,0

What sorta grip are you using with these shots?,Charles Netzler,2019-10-29T10:14:14Z,0
"Sincerely confused... The video in all those jumpy/bouncing/swing shots is really really poor quality. (From like :22 seconds to about <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV7P4AdOduo&amp;t=2m23s"">2:23</a>) It seems like every time you move the camera (maybe it&#39;s in post?) that the quality of those fast moving pieces (spring line or ring or human spinning) goes to total crapola... like blurry... I am hoping this is just because I am on a really lame work laptop, but your video that is shot in the review other than that of just you, is really crisp so I can&#39;t tell what is going on... Some of the not so fast moving stuff is clean from the MAX but a lot of it is really really soft/blurry... I was really psyched on this thing but now I am worried. Hopefully it&#39;s just my laptop. Later in the video when you are editing on the phone even on the phone it looks super clean. Guna have to check this out on my rig at home.",SIECIKSuc,2019-10-28T21:18:20Z,0

"I think the final footage looks way better then in the Fusion and even the 360 one X. Nevertheless when you are changing angles in the overcapture (or what else it is called now) it gets strange, like looses sharpness for an instant and gets better short after that, kind of out of focus. Nevertheless I think this are the best results out of a 360 degree consumer camera so far.",Thoughts on Tech,2019-10-22T19:14:49Z,1
"Re: &quot;like looses sharpness for an instant &quot;, that was a creative choice by the editor.  Adding motion blur to keyframes is available in some reframing effect filters (slightly too much was used here, I agree), it is not within the current mobile app, so most of this was edited elsewhere.",David Newman,2019-10-22T20:31:18Z,1
