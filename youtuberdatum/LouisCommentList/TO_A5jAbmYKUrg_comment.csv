"Great, man! That&#39;s really a lot of work <br />Cold is painful... <br /><br />I want to notice for others that the important point is to include your arms and fingers also, <br />because fingers suffer first and we should train their cold resistance too<br />Also without socks, because they lower the water circulation around your toes (another weak point)<br />If you don&#39;t, it will be a significant disadvantage during your cold water swimming in an ocean or a lake",Erik More,2020-01-03T08:43:45Z,0

As a wim hoff method practitioner for almost 5 year’s So your mindset is important don’t think that you’re doing this for yourself think of this as training for if one of your children fell in the ice you’ll never be as strong for yourself as you will be for someone else mindset is important and And relax and long exhalations he’s not doing the long exhalations is why he’s having so much trouble and it looks so hard for him relax and breathe long exhalations and your body will automatically start to heat up so the quicker you relax the quicker you get the warm,Micheal Klee,2019-12-27T00:55:17Z,1
