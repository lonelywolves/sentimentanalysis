Jennelle watched van life videos when she was in high school.  <br />She probably learned how to create a better video by watching alot of videos.  <br />She practiced making  videos for a year until she was happy about the quality of her videos before posting her first video on Youtube. <br />Practice does improve the quality of a video.,Alexander Richardson,2020-05-25T12:29:13Z,1

"@jennelleeliana Did I call it or did I call it? And just wgen I was going to ask if I could call you. Oh well! Anyways, now that you&#39;ve given more details about the whereabouts of where you work you should be just a tad more careful out there. Trolls live looking people up. If nit just so they can say they found you. Here&#39;s a tip though. Before exiting your van why not check your mirrors furst? Safety first after all. I live in my truck. I travel over the road. The cirrent company I work with doesn&#39;t deliver on your side of I-35. Therefore I couldn&#39;t visit you anyways. Yeah I could because I sometimes get invited to Hollywood for exclusive events. The Saturn Awards is bext week &amp; I&#39;ll have to decline this year. Maybe next year will be better for me. There are still a few venues coming this year though &amp; I might just take them up on their offer seeing tgat wintertime is coming. If I was still with my other company I could get loads to bring me out that way. They still want me to come back too! Us truckers are always on the watch out for things out of the ordinary out here on this road. You never know when you might pull into a town hust like Hoboken! If you haven&#39;t heard of Hoboken then think Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Hills Have Eyes. You got a lot of serial stalkers &amp; killers out here. Some are cannibals. Some are sanguinariast or vampires. I&#39;m not saying to live life sxared. I&#39;m just sating, Eliana, be careful. I want to replace your boyfriend one day!

When you look at how she rose you can see Youtube promoted her show. either way she does not look like any full time person living in a Van I know... everything is so perfect there is no way you live in that space 24/7. , this snake does not  like extreme heat 78- 80 degrees  In the S.

"He is cute!  Now his appearance of looking drained and sun kissed from living this type of daily lifestyle for years is the way I would think a truthful van dweller would appear - Not Jenelle&#39;s fresh polish glowing looks after over two years.  Wow! I do love her beautiful white bright teeth!  LMAO!  His facial expressions towards her is priceless, especially when he asked about feeling safe, traveling and being a Youtuber!  Even he isn&#39;t buying her fake BS, and crazy ridiculous answer to all those questions, especially owning a snake while living in a gas guzzling van. Like he said, &quot;he would own one in a house&quot;.  Who purposely wants to live in a van, and say they plan to keep doing it, especially if they have money.  And who put, first she said someplace else it was $10,000, here she said, &quot;btw $6,000-$9,000, in renovating an old van. What I mainly do not like is how she is glamorizing this very dangerous lifestyle causing young girls to think about living this way when SHE CLEARLY DOESN&#39;T LIVE THIS WAY HERSELF, NOR DOES ALFREDO.  So if you do have a job or plenty of money until you find a job, and you are thinking about pursuing this lifestyle - DON&#39;T!!!!!! This world has a lot of mentally unstable people in it, plus sex traffickers and you may end up getting VICIOUSLY attacked OR WORSE!  So think wisely!",Cookie S.,2019-08-13T05:32:04Z,2

And can‚Äôt we just escape from our 9-5 desk job and imagine how bliss life will be when we buy our own van and travel the world, meet another roady, have babies, become vegan etc. Gosh.
