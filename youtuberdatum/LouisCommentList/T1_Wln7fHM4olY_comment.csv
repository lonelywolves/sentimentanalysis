"How everyone was describing their audiences expecting them to be a certain way, and be a certain version of themselves, is exactly how I feel with my close friends.

"From a higher consciousness perspective. An overall awesome awareness. A striving overcoming spirituality. A wonderful wisdom of soul. A life of self exploration. This conversation content is a convergence of fragmented consciousness. Clearly moving away from the corruption of consciousness. Now opening up again to the universal truth of all is one within the all of all source. Separation is the illusion. One of many illusions designed to explore, experience and expand consciousness throughout eternal energy in of infinite love. Many wonderful blessings of higher consciousness, awesome awareness, overcoming spirituality with wisdom of soul. What more can I be? Be love. Be of service to self. All life is truly sacred.

"There are a couple of thoughts that might be useful:  &quot;What you think of me is none of my business&quot;  This has to do with recognizing out own innate self worth, and therefore not making others responsible for how we feel about ourselves.   Second, the light of joy dwells within us, and as we reside within this joy, we radiate it out to the world, and as we are radiating joy which is an eternal font of expression, our life expression in the world is joyous.  Where attention goes, Energy flows.  At the center of a vortex, there is stillness while at the same time, there is a flow surrounding it.  As we move away from the stillness, the flow seems to become more turbulent and chaotic, so that we are buffeted about in our life expressing.  Returning to the stillness within, via meditation, brings us to a place where we recognize the external flow springs from the stillness so that we may always return to the center of our being where stillness is ever present.<br /><br />I&#39;ve share this before via other venues, a saying which came to me years ago: &quot;The joy of life is to be found in each moment lived.  NOW is the moment.&quot;  Joy, as well as the stillness resides in the HERE NOW moment by moment unfolding. It is ever present, and as we are present within IT, we contribute to the joyous expression of life in life.<br />Blessings to us all!",Jerome Dechant,2020-01-29T18:09:24Z,0

"god how honest and amazing is this. to me it seems ever sense youtube and creators hit the peak of financial and social success and everything plummeted afterwards it made everyone take a step back and be shown what there true intentions behind creating is and now that all of that has passed people are so open about how much of it was maybe not originally but ultimately turned into very egotistical, damaging and fear based that a lot of people where operating with. Louis is such a legend, I remember I saw a interview with him awhile ago where he said I never really started anything with the intention of making it my job I just followed my passions and a opportunity always arose, and that&#39;s exactly what he did even now after huge youtube success once he realized it was no longer something organic and genuine but actually unhealthy and addicting he took the gamble on his own personal and finical security to search for something else and look at this video now a unique amazing piece of content in a age of copying advertising money and fame hungry world. If there&#39;s any inspiration I think people should take from this, is go about your future in a un fear based state and let there will always be something next that come along don&#39;t stay in toxic situations, identify it and work on letting go.",Tanner Thibert,2020-01-27T07:53:51Z,2

"For the longest time I had adopted that widely accepted view of ‘success’ being equitable to material worldly gain e.g. high paying job, nice car, big home. It caused me a lot of anxiety because I would doubt whether I had the ability to do attain those things. <br /><br />Being on this spiritual journey of mine, I’ve realised how important it is to re-define our own idea of ‘success’, and not just accept what society tells us. Success is nothing more than a successful present moment, because in presence we feel connected and loved with ourselves and everything around us.",Zahid Chowdhury,2020-01-24T05:19:23Z,1

@FunForLouis The world needs more sensitive people if we want to thrive on mumma earth. Loved this. Thank you ☆♡☆,Priestess Peaches,2020-01-14T21:12:28Z,0
"Hey Reece, I&#39;m sorry that&#39;s what you took from this video. <br /><br /><br />Everyone has their own experience of suffering and the intention of the group was to have an open and honest conversation rather than undermine or draw comparisons between one persons suffering compared to the other. <br /><br /><br />And as for being sensitive, that&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of 🙂 people are different and that’s a good thing! <br /><br /><br />Hopefully you’ll take a more positive message from the next video we put out.",FunForLouis,2020-01-14T14:52:36Z,8

"Bit of a disjointed context for a conversation however Russell in any context expressing himself is  interesting so just listening for anything I can relate to I guess lol, bizzare",R g,2020-01-13T22:38:59Z,2
R g I get where you are coming from. I was curious to know the purpose of actually filming and sharing this? There was no context. I definitely enjoy real talk. But is this to introduce followers to a program to deal with issues? Or was it just to demonstrate some reality with these people?,RJCOutdoors,2020-01-14T11:14:29Z,0

"It&#39;s important to get to know yourself, your intended journey on this earth. We all have a blue print and we must live that destiny through. I love you Russell Brand as you tell it like it is in many ways but there is a hiccup. I&#39;m not religious but believe in a higher power such as God. He is guiding us all along with his almighty angels! Believing in God is not a religion, it is the  BREATH and LOVE of GOD through the HOLY SPIRIT!. Anyone searching for wellbeing and peace through other channels i.e. yoga, meditation, fake religion etc is not of Gods will. God Bless! 🙏❣",Peace Justice,2020-01-13T19:22:14Z,2

So interesting hearing about the realness behind the lense and after the conversation around the table I totally see how it can envelope a person . I always looked at youtube as a relationship of sharing ones world from another point of view. It becomes a escape for the viewer into worlds and understanding of the world on ways the viewer may never live in there life be it for financial reasons or passionately taking steps to do it themselves.

I was wondering if they had to pay Russel Brand for doing this podcast. I would very much doubt that he offered his services for free here.,showmoke,2020-01-13T11:49:46Z,3

"sfranklin10 - yes, quite so. I don’t believe that Russell’s intentions were 100% honourable here. He was clearly trying to sell his product here, ie. his 12 steps to good mental health course.",showmoke,2020-01-13T12:56:12Z,1
"This is clearly an advertisement for Russel&#39;s new product he&#39;s selling, his 12 step course. He is most likely paying Louis for platforming it for him on youtube.",Shawn,2020-01-13T12:50:53Z,1

"I just want to say that I loved this interview and everyones opinions on ones addictions , per say I use to be once addicted to alchol, which I am not anymore and just focused on my self and how I can get better without hurting myself so much that I get back to beging damaged in a altercation. But instead to look back and say what I can do better and change then what I did and brought me to that situation.  It was a very great interview and group chat loved it 100% .<br />Happy new years to everyone. 💚❤🦖",Nick Pollastrelli,2020-01-13T10:38:33Z,2

"There is such a fabulous collective knowledge and experience abound that table and such genuine vulnerability and desire to help others. The collective messages and the new recovery course from Russell offers such hope for the new year and the new decade. We are all a constant work in progress trying to be our best versions and if we can all see how we can help each other as well as help ourselves the world will surely become a better place. We must try and ween ourselves off all the distraction and addiction to the news, look inside through meditation 🧘‍♂️ and see if the new course that Russell is starting today ( which I am really looking forward to) will help. I have found that the messages from Kyle Cease, Russell Brand and Wayne Dyer to be wonderfully helpful to me of late and look forward to a more balanced year ahead. A big thank you 🙏 to all of you that sat round this table and shared so openly especially Louis and Russell for your insights and thoughts.",Sam and Janes Bubble,2020-01-13T08:49:03Z,3

"Is it ironic that extensive use and engagement with social media, although very social, can alter our feelings of isolation and depression.  Fear of missing out, depression when comparing your lives to the flamboyant lifestyles of others, narcissistic egocentrism.  All of which  was heavily influencing my life until I gave up my personal social media accounts in 2016 since the birth of my first son. Was using since Facebook and YouTube inception.  Now my life couldn&#39;t be better!  Just have to stop getting too deep into the news sites and live a bit more and it will be like the pre, 2008 days of Nokia cell phones and generally a better time out with friends and family in my opinion.  Just my opinion.",LMK2,2020-01-13T06:37:30Z,6
