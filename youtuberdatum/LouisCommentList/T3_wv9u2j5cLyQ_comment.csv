I initially used the same green coolant but ran into some literature references that caste shade on it. I went to the ASTM Standards website. Green is acidic-not good for aluminum. Red is phosphatic - not good for aluminum. Pink or blue is pH neutral recommended for aluminum which is what our cooling modules use for internal channels. Obviously the same applies to the chill plate.under your inverter. I flushed my coolant with distilled water and am now running Xerex Asian Vehicle. It‚Äôs pink. I liked the green Gatorade in the D5 pump but looks aren‚Äôt everything. The ASTM standards are ASTM 3306 and K2234.

"Louis,  what you are doing is truly remarkable.  On the one hand we commend you for your desire to do something new and pioneer the EV revolution.  On the other hand (as VW Owners)  we know the limitations of machines and the inevitably fail.  We only hope you are able to have many many miles of adventures in your EV bus and that what troubles you do have, you&#39;re able to fix.  :) <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23vwlife"">#VWLife</a>",VW Life,2021-01-20T15:36:03Z,11

Its almost the same leap as from carburetor to fuel injection some people just got left behind and never understood it. Others embraced it and were successful. If shirtless hippies are not doing it for you why watch?,Hokir Winsor,2021-01-22T07:45:15Z,1

"Water cooling without any water cooler ?  i just saw the pump, the lines and the batteries.... but no cooler ? <br />also the flow rate of that &quot;PC&quot; Pump must be terrible! i think you should look for some better ways for the cooling.  <br /><br />Also Great work. nice to see that you try to do every thing on yourself. Keep it up men",KidModi,2021-01-20T15:06:40Z,18

the cooling system showed in the video won&#39;t cool anything ü§£ it just circulates warm fluid in a loop,E620SE,2021-01-20T16:19:46Z,11
Whats the total kwh for all 12 packs.<br />I am confused about the coolant system. Where is the heat dicipatet. Are there radiators somewhere?<br />Also i couldnt tell if the coolant is flowing through one pavk after the other or in parallel. <br />How much watts of heat power will each pack produce when disscharged ?,rok rok,2021-01-20T15:05:15Z,0
"Clearly he is still testing the system, he is cutting some corners but at every key change he is testing the operation, if he just connected it all and then ran the system and one of the pipes or batteries leaked then he would be in trouble, the next stage i am sure will be installing a proper circulation pump and radiator system, the interesting part will be if he can make it intelligently monitored and run the cooling when required or even heat if he travels somewhere cooler! This does get complexed especially as we are talking self build, many of which don‚Äôt have any in built cooling at all!",russell bosley,2021-01-21T12:03:06Z,1

Be very careful because you&#39;ve never seen an explosion quite like a shorted lithium battery pack. It can vaporize a metal wrench almost instantaneously.,Robb403,2021-01-20T13:15:53Z,53
@Harry Goodman a small puncture over a high bump or something to a battery his entire thing is gonna get vaporised and burns for days,Smithy of 98,2021-02-17T00:40:47Z,0
@Harry Goodman no he won&#39;t. There&#39;s no protection or proper structure to it.,Smithy of 98,2021-02-17T00:40:10Z,0
"@Harry Goodman Or the cheapo cooling pipe could get damaged or fall off the barbs and damage packs that way. I&#39;d have used some automotive-grade pipe. It looked like there were loose BMS wires inside the boxes which will be fine for a while, but if there is too much movement then there could be abrasion and a short eventually. It feels like there is a shortage of failsafes in this design, but he&#39;s not gone into much detail so it&#39;s a little hard to tell. I&#39;d have put some more isolation in, and indeed some insulation to make it easier to keep a good battery temperature. <br />The tesla packs do have a transparent insulating layer  and he did insulate the busbars, so bashing the bottom won&#39;t necessarily short things, but it could. Maybe he&#39;s going to put a guard-plate underneath to make it more robust, especially at the front edge. It&#39;ll &#39;probably&#39; be OK, but like I say, shortage of failsafes so it might end badly.",. Wookey,2021-02-03T21:55:39Z,0
@Fernando Sguera ok if you are thats great but the only bad scenario would be if he hits the bottom and the whole thing goes boom? Correct? So yes he is taking on a risk but i said if he is careful with his driving he should be fine? Correct? And since you are an aeronautical engineer I&#39;d love to know what you think!,Harry Goodman,2021-01-22T15:25:47Z,0
