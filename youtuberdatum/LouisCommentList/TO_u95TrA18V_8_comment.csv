The historic old city is really marvellous. But unfortunately extremely crowded with tourists....<br /><br />The rest of Cartagena - mainly Bocagrande where all the big hotels are - you should better avoid. The beach isn&#39;t nice and you will be cornered by hundreds of guys that want to sell you rubbish. Horrible!,GlobalTraveller64,2019-11-21T20:53:30Z,1

"Maybe one of the worlds most beautiful cities but that includes some of the worlds worst people and corruption as well. You will not be left alone a second in the old town. The police works with the prostitutes, drug sellers and what not. Be especially aware in Getsemani, where most the hostels are. Media Luna is one of the worst streets I´ve ever stayed at. I was in Cartagena 4 months so I have seen alot of the bad sides which I didn´t expect after having lived in Medellin for 6 months. I think I had to pay off the police 4 times plus the maffia. One Australian guy I met stayed in  hostel in old town, he was extorted and robbed the first day. Around torre de reloj, clock tower, are around 100 prostitutes and drug sellers which sells you drugs that will make you sick, the girls try to drug you and rob you if they can since the police backs them up. My advice is take a taxi to where you are going at night and leave with it or you´ll be severely herrased. Twice the police tried to take me into alleys where they can shot you or rob you, but hey! Who gives a shit about reality. Manga has some nice hostels and calle Arsenal in Getsemani is way better than Media Luna. Enjoy your stay!",Music Of Sounds,2019-08-14T16:59:26Z,0
