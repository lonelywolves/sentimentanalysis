"I literally flew the Mavic mini, in a harbour which was a &#39;no fly zone&#39;, had to enter my details and mobile number and log in but was all sweet 👌. Obviously not doing anything silly, just wanted golden hour footage",James Otto,2021-03-26T11:07:03Z,0
Wonderful review. Thanks very much indeed for sharing. I was torn between the DJI Mini &amp; The Holy Stone HS720-E....I&#39;m going for the DJI Mini....I think....😯 Which would you recommend please.,"Head The Ball,",2021-02-02T00:47:52Z,0
"I’m so glad I got this drone! I purchased some range antennas for it also as I live in the U.K. and we don’t have no way near as much broadcasting power than the USA so I was suffering from poor range and was lucky to get to 500m with the mavic mini.... now with the range extenders I can get 5,000m 👌🏼",Marco Giovanni,2021-01-15T04:34:20Z,0

I just bought a Air - the mini struggles in the wind and I wanted better video quality - great video a well deserved like from me 👍,DroneN,2020-03-21T20:41:20Z,0
"I have wanted a drone for 2 yrs.  When I found the mini I quickly looked online and found a great used one and took the plunge.  Because of our weather I only have 3 partial batteries through it and 2 full batteries but so far, it’s amazing.  Flown in -20 celcius and strong wind with easy and new pilot ease.  The day I got to fly at -0 cel. was awesome.  Can’t wait for spring.  My advice.  Before your first flight. Everyone will tell you to Update controller and drone firmware.  Also do all calibration tests. What some ppl forget and I did and it caused me a ton of unnecessary grief was to update my phone firmware.  Amazing drone.!!!",FORDEVR,2020-03-18T14:57:25Z,1
"Another useful tip I found.  It seems there are inexperienced and experienced ppl that loose there drones.  This often results in them having spare batteries, controller and charger.  Put wanted ads on kijiji or Craigslist and you can get spare equipment for reasonable.  Here in Canada the drone is $650(fly more) and I got mine for $450 slightly used.  I put up a wanted ad and also got 2 more batteries  a spare case, extra controller and charger for $200.<br />Unlimited fly time now.  You do have to bind the controller any time you switch controllers but this is easy.",FORDEVR,2020-04-17T14:08:10Z,0

"actually there are drones of other brands that at a similar price range give 4k, follow me and way point navigation, is not the price, is the portability where you can not beat it, at least not with its video and fly capability. and this is true at that price range, but also being willing to spend much more. nothing that can do what the mini can is so light and small.",Andrea Chinaglia,2020-03-07T19:57:40Z,0

"it lacks also of way point gps navigation, obstacle avoidance and has limits in the control of the camera settings, but as portability nothing beat it. a buyer should know what he really need and chose his drone accordingly, is impossible to have all at once, if you want more functions you lose portability, if you want more video quality, i am not talking of 4k, i am talking of control on color balance and other advanced features, you have to be prepared to pay more.",Andrea Chinaglia,2020-03-07T20:04:20Z,0

I realised that 90% of shot are done in a distance of 500- 700metres from my position on the ground, 200 m above , 2,7k is my resolution but most of all - portability  and since 1 Jan 2020 - 249 grams is a huge advantage. hmmmmm....",sirnefyorq,2020-02-25T13:57:52Z,0

"Hi Louis, Great video, thanks. The part where you rank the various drones by feature really helpful.<br /><br /><br />However, sorry to put the dampers on this but, you can&#39;t fly drones outside the regulations (approx. 8m53s), even if the drone is outside the registration criteria 😌....well, not in the UK anyway.<br /><br /><br /><br />Here&#39;s an extract from Civil Aviation Authority&#39;s site:<br />“You do not need to pass the test or register if your drone or model aircraft is less than 250g, or you’ll only fly indoors or in a securely netted area. You must still follow the rules and regulations when you fly.”<br /><br /><br /><br />See <a href=""https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/"">https://register-drones.caa.co.uk</a> and <a href=""https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/drone-code"">https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/drone-code</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Happy flying/filming to all :)",nithakorn,2019-11-24T10:56:15Z,1

"Thanks for the review. I wonder if it will get an update to allow manual control in video mode. Is it possible to exposure lock and to lock the WB? If it had active tracking I would probably buy it to take it on my bike travels. Is it possible to lock the controller and have the drone stay stationary, throw the controller in a bag, ride through the frame and then get the controller out again? That would at least be a kind of workaround to get some footage of yourself moving along.",ickeausberlin36,2019-11-08T19:09:14Z,0
"The thing that stood out to me most in the image comparisons was how the Spark image looks the best straight out of the camera. The Mini is way too bright. Dropping the EV may have helped, but with no manual ISO and WB, it&#39;s not ideal. Obviously, you&#39;d be able to get better post-grade stuff with the Air and the Pro 2, but it has to be said, that straight out of the camera, the Spark is damn good.",Andy Schär,2019-11-08T10:03:37Z,2

Finally a review based on real world everyday requirements based on average users..that probably never use the 4k quality and majority of the functions on the higher specced drones Highlighting the basic needs for every day hobbyist use... I seriously see this drone as not an entry level or toy drone but a drone that has the right balance of spec that majority of the buyers will need and use.. Ease of use Brilliant flight time.. More than adequate video quality and an affordable price tag.. Less than half of the air... This leaves me to wonder the future or the need for the air... Will DJI increase the flight time and drop the price on this.. I see the Mini as a go to everyday drone and if you become serious and need more spec and video capability then you UPGRADE to the Mavic Pro 2,Rodrick Ewing,2019-11-07T05:10:10Z,73

"Nice to see all four in same screen. Thank you for that demo. This was very good for me to see. What editing software do you use for this four videos? <br /><br />Have you noticed any problems with the video chopping during panning when it comes to panning with your various donors? When you see cars pass, do the cars usually hack or flicker when they pass? <br /><br />I know that these negative effects may be due to poor editing software, but I also know that it may be because the camera is not capable of recording well in higher resolutions or with higher frame rate.",Björn Bergerheim,2019-11-01T17:48:25Z,0

In germany sub 250g means: <br />- no &quot;numberplate&quot; - over 250g there has to be a fireproof sticker.<br />- still insurance needed BUT drone insurance is already included in a lot householdinsurances  - over 250g there are special drone tariffs. (80$ p.A.),Gtaplayer325,2019-11-06T01:15:48Z,0
"James Moxley that’s exactly right. In Canada, with a basic operations license, you cannot fly a drone over 250g:<br />- within 30 meters laterally in any direction from other people<br />- over or near any advertised event<br />- for at least 24h after consuming any alcohol<br />- without registration<br />- etc etc<br /><br />Having a drone under 250g changes all that. The only rule to follow in Canada for a 249g drone is not to endanger or likely endanger people (i.e. fly responsibly).<br /><br />Based on that alone, the Mavic Mini is the absolute best drone for Canada!<br /><br />Cherry on top: it sells for $50 USD cheaper for Canada ($349 USD for the drone or $449 USD for fly more combo) 🇨🇦",Alaincopter,2019-11-06T00:56:31Z,0

can&#39;t do it with a Mavic Mini. You&#39;d need a FPV drone for stuff like that.,That Francesco,2019-10-30T15:03:07Z,0
$399. I&#39;m getting one for my next travels. That is so cheap for the quality and I doubt customs will even spot it in luggage,Matthew,2019-10-30T14:03:40Z,11
this is size of the Iphone...just put in your carry bag and on the tray next to your phone and watch...I was traveling with Mavic Pro this way - never heard a word about it from the customs.,sirnefyorq,2020-02-25T14:00:30Z,0

It <b>is</b> however the smallest drone in the world with these kinds of features.,"Oh, It's Tyler",2020-05-26T01:03:23Z,0
@Jessada Hawley Tello is not a DJI drone. It is a Ryze product with technology licensed from DJI,Mark Dutton,2019-11-05T09:51:56Z,3
"Plus, this is a flycam, not a drone. This way it can be marketed as a toy and not a drone, allowing it to be sold in more countries",Pietro Corsellini,2019-11-03T09:43:05Z,1
"Christian Filippone No it is not smallest drone DJI has offer, it is DJI Tello that is smallest drone from DJI",Jessada Hawley,2019-11-01T22:25:08Z,4
