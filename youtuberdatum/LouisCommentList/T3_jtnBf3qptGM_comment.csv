"Hey Louis you do not have to do much to run SVO or straight vegi oil in any diesel. On your bus, change out fuel lines with ones that can handle vegi oil since original ones will melt and go bad quickly. Second, add another fuel holding tank for the vegi oil because you need to heat up the vegi oil before it gets pumped to engine, You always start the bus with regular diesel and then you switch over to SVO system and run from there. You will need to change out fuel filter more often the first few times you run on SVO as it cleans out the lines and fuel system. Good look!",GreenTechFusion Renewable Energy,2021-04-22T14:12:11Z,0

"Having had one of those VW campers, I would say that 60 mph is unsafe under any condition. Just from your video, the suspension sounds as rickety as they always were. They are very hard to control at high speed and the original brakes are barely enough to stop it. Before you go pushing the limits, make sure you have a way to closely monitor your battery temperature and a way to quickly disconnect it if it overheats as well as an impact detecting disconnect in case you are in an accident. Of course, if you hit anything head on, you&#39;re as good as gone anyway. There&#39;s very little front protection. You would be wise to put an upgraded brake system with larger calipers and disks on it.",Robb403,2021-04-22T12:36:12Z,2

"@Ryukachoo Unfortunately, whilst the carbon offset schemes are a good start, we can&#39;t rely on them. There are a few studies which show that a forest the size of Brazil would be required to meet the 1.5C target which isn&#39;t attainable in a reasonable timeframe, if at all. This is alongside a massive reduction in carbon-based fuels. Behaviours and habits need to be altered first and once we limit CO2e output, we can then look into direct air capture using tree planting schemes and technologies such as those being developed by Carbon Engineering.<br />On a more personal note, I&#39;m not a huge fan of these tree planting schemes as they allow the (usually) wealthy to pay a bit extra to travel &#39;guilt free&#39; using a highly polluting method, rather than encouraging them to change their travelling habits. <br />Sorry for the long response!",Seb Hudson,2021-04-23T09:42:00Z,0

@Different not by a lot actually. Commercial airlines and cruise ships are the biggest polluters by far per person per mile. Heating houses and commercially is the other big contributor. <br /><br />Cars are just much more local and visible (see Shanghai or LA for that matter) but unnecessary moving about is the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù not a 50 year old petrol van with a barely big enough engine.,devisionhun,2021-04-24T07:09:10Z,2
@devisionhun correct me if I am wrong but aren&#39;t planes emitting as much as a car for the same distance traveled.<br /><br />Adjusting for the shortcut a plane takes compared to a car zigzaging on streets it seems like a plane has less carbon emissions than traveling by a typical car.,Different,2021-04-24T02:19:46Z,0

"@Gin probably much less than him, even without a fancy 40k electric van.<br />Zero flights in 4-5 years, 18 solar panels on the roof, driving a Chevy Volt 90% just electric... so yeah, maybe converting a van electric and a schoolbus to veggie oil is not nearly as carbon-conscious as simply choosing to not fly.",devisionhun,2021-04-23T14:20:44Z,5

Yeah the question is that a car + made electric at a total of $ 35.000 is worth it as best environmentally option for that money üí∞ ?? ü§î,Lars Stougaard,2021-04-22T14:51:41Z,0
