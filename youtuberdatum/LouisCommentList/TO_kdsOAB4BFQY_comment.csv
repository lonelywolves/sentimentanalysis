Of course you can create some sort of solution to bring the mic to the side but it¬¥s a workaround not a solution made especially for vloggers.<br /><br />And the rolling shutter at around <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdsOAB4BFQY&amp;t=3m18s"">3:18</a> is the worst I¬¥ve ever seen.<br /><br />Some other specs are nice but I don¬¥t get why Sony released such a camera. Anyway it will find its friends and that¬¥s fine. But it¬¥s not a sensation at all.

In my opinion....im listing to the voice mic test through headphones as i normally do when watching youtube. I find the Audio to be fine while your talking to it as close as you are. Crystal Clear!!   Now i wouldn&#39;t trust it to record any music bands or loud sounds or conversation happing out side of two arm lenths. But in general it sounds fine. Not just in your test...but in all of the other reviews. I say go without the external mic if all your doing is walking and talking.,RichbergEnt,2019-01-17T01:01:31Z,0

"If this is targeted at vloggers, then flip up screen that gets covered by a mic is a huge fail. I suppose you could get a cage and mount the mic to that, but that only adds bulk and weight not suitable for vloggers. And the in house mic is very poor, adding to the fire that now you absolutely need an external mic for decent sound quality. Only thing it has on the M50 is better 4k but with it losing out on the other features important to vloggers, plus the M50 15mm stabilized kit lens and $350 cheaper, why would anyone buy this over the M50?",firpofutbol,2019-01-16T08:38:21Z,1

"Here is the reason Sony went backwards. It&#39;s why Nikon failed with their mirrorless attempts too. It&#39;s to keep the value of their other gear in tact. All these camera companies know the majority of people now follow the crowd on youtube and will buy whatever the reviews say to buy. This camera is an a5100 and a6300 that had an affair. They finally gave you the flippy screen but had to take other features away so they can sell them in the next model. It&#39;s called strategic marketing. Now, if Sony had added a better battery, 2 card slots and IBIS 90% of users would only use this camera from now on and all their other stock is useless. Why would you buy anything else?

"Gonna be a LOT of talk about this camera.  People wanting features like IBIS and such will just have to wait for the a7000.  The 6400 is an interesting camera.   the problem is it has incredibly potential as a camera for photography, but they&#39;re trying to cater to vloggers as well, which is hard to do with the microphone port being where it is.  Has anyone seen the monstrosity they posted where it&#39;s a pistol grip on the bottom, a plate, then the camera and mic side by side?   You tested the on camera mic, but the issue is when using an external mic, and where to put it. Also the rolling shutter was REALLY bad.  Wonder what codec you shot in.  anyways, I&#39;ll have to make a video on it myself when/if I get my hands on one.

"@Mohsin Sait I actually don&#39;t think so. The a7III is going to sit, and probably stay at $2000.  The A7000 will be at the most, $1500 (I hope). $500 is a brand new lens, so that&#39;s quite the chunk of change. Also there is a clear cut difference, and that&#39;s the sensor.  One is built for APSC lenses, and the other is built for FE lenses. Obviously you can use either type of lens on either body (the beauty of the E mount), but some people want full frame vs APSC. I myself, don&#39;t want to go full frame yet.  I hold near and dear to my heart the lighter weight system of the a6000. If the a7000 is a little heavier, but I can stick with lenses like the sony 35mm f1.8 (APSC) and have featurs of the bigger/heavier A7III then I&#39;m sold!  You are right, but I don&#39;t think it will be too hard for people.",hikyletaggart,2019-01-15T21:54:49Z,0
"@hikyletaggart hmm, you&#39;re right. That $300 extra is worth a lot more but, again for another $200 you get an a7 mk3. Full frame, big battery, better evf, and probably better weather sealing.

"@No One You can get amazing handheld shot on a M43 (GH5, G85, G9) camera because the sensor is so small, its easy to stabilize. Not so much with APSC and FF. The IBIS in the A6500 is not good at all for handheld video (I mean for walking around etc) its still jittery, even with an OSS lens (i.e 10-18mm). Also the DJI Osmo is fucking garbage why would anyone use that crap. The video quality looks worst than Minecraft graphics. Nobody want a shitty looking vlog video, all the top vlogger use 2000$+ camera setup,",Benoit L√©vesque,2019-01-15T23:52:56Z,6
@Benoit L√©vesque For vlogging already have DJI osmo pocket. This is a very strong camera. Sony needs a camera for the semi-professional segment. It will be more profitable to buy a6500. Without sensor stabilizer will increase the cost of the final equipment for a good picture. With sensor stabilizer you can shoot video from your hands.,No One,2019-01-15T23:15:31Z,3
