"California sources of electricity generation 2020. Natural gas (fracked) 54.6%, solar 21.3%, wind 8.1%, hydro 7%, nuclear 5.5%, coal 0.2%. So in total 54.8% of the power for your electric vehicle comes from fossil fuels. Bearing in mind that the whole life carbon footprint from manufacture, running and scrapping an electric vehicle is considerably higher than a petrol driven car, there is unlikely to be much if any emissions saving, so what is the point? For all of this you have to suffer range anxiety and long journey delays for charging time. However, it is an interesting project, and I congratulate you for conquering that steep learning curve to achieve your goal.

Plus not rust proofing the welded parts the battery boxes are connected to and bolting aluminum and steel parts together which will suffer from galvanic corrosion when wet.

I cant quite believe that the small radiator and pc water-cooling pump is sufficient enough for the model s battery ... But i hope you know what your doingüòÖ,Ryan G,2021-02-06T14:13:59Z,7
"have a look at a model S radiator.. not much bigger than what Louis is using and he is also not using the same amount of battery packs as a model S, or running the same controller and motor, so not the same current draw. I would duct the radiator so the hot air is exhausted to the rear of the car to increase efficiency, but it will work fine....",Nilezy,2021-02-06T19:05:01Z,0
