ah hi
i am spending the next two nights at a
place called the retreat
in costa rica having a little medication
it is
a solo trip two nights just for me this
mama this is the longest time i've been
away from kai
in the past year and a half i think the
longest has been like
eight hours up until now it was hard to
leave her
but once i got here i was like okay
over the next couple of days i'm going
to be pampering myself just taking time
to relax recharge
work undisturbed um sleep
and be treated to the many many
things you can be treated to here at the
[Music]
retreat
[Music]
i went to the global wellness summit
about four years ago i went there and
the question was what is wellness this
is interesting it's a global wellness
summit and the question is what is
wellness
if you're looking for a transformational
wellness center
where you can escape the daily chaos and
stress to regain your sense of balance
the retreat is the place you've been
searching for
this slice of paradise was brought to
fruition by best-selling author
health and wellness coach diana stobo
and is perfectly located on a crystal
mountain
overlooking the nakoya peninsula and
pacific ocean
so the retreat was built on uh how i
healed myself
the basis is food everything starts with
food even in ayurveda everything starts
with the food
so the first thing we do is anybody who
arrives here gets an anti-inflammatory
diet whether they're detoxing or not
they're detoxing
they don't have to go the juice cleanse
they don't have to go that deep unless
they want to go that deep
but just eating our food here is a detox
in and of itself
but as you know the food is delicious
you would never know you're eating an
anti-inflammatory diet right
so people come here they rave about the
food it's like you know considered the
best restaurant and this
area and all this stuff yet they leave
i'm like
my pants are looser this food is
absolutely
unreal it is some of the best food i
have
ever had and it's so healthy and so
flavorful and so fresh
you can request vegan raw vegan if
vegetarian pescetarian whatever works
for you
i did vegan and it is unreal everything
was organic
something like 80 of the ingredients are
grown here on the property but
everything is local
organic fresh so flavorful it's
unbelievable
[Music]
[Applause]
we have an open kitchen so people can
you know
hear and smell the food as it's being
made the
the staff comes out and greets you the
staff is as you know very very warm here
and they love it they love being part of
this they're not here to
you know get a paycheck they're actually
here because they care
i just finished like an hour in 45
minute yoga session
and it was more of like a restorative
session um
a lot of like focusing on different
parts of your body and how you're
actually moving them
it was it was informative and good and i
feel refreshed ready for the rest of the
day
we do have exercise programs we do have
trainers but
the yoga we do is really for alignment
and for
moving your body in a gentle way to
really find balance
in your body and then we hike in nature
so they talk about
um forest bathing well there's no better
way to force bay than actually walk
through the forest
i'm on a hike right now the retreat
offers daily hiking it can go
anywhere from like an hour to two and a
half hours long depending
on you and what you'd like you have to
always do it with a guide
because it can be dangerous there's
poisonous snakes
there are cliffs and if you're down here
there's no way of connecting with
anybody else because there's no one else
around
on this hike we are visiting the organic
coffee plantation
which they use to brew the coffee for
gas
and we're also visiting the farm where
they grow
the organic produce for the food that
they make for gas
here are the coffee beans that they've
picked and laid out to roast in the sun
letting the sun do the work i love it
so it's like you're living this life
that's there it's not scheduled
to where you're rushing to get to every
class you're not you know doing pilates
on the floor
it's not it's not like a regimen it's
literally
flow and free here i want people to be
able to take that time to heal the rooms
are extremely cozy
we make them really really cozy the beds
the bedding everything is lush we have
aromatherapy in the room we have
crystals that absorb the negative energy
everything is designed for the healing
experience
you can go as deep or as light as you
want but that's basically the premise
here and we have programs of course that
are designed for
a specific goal that helps people
because a lot of people don't know what
they want
in fact i would say the majority of
people who come here say
i don't know why i came here
but i was called to come here and when
they come here they're like
wow my whole life changed i didn't
expect that
[Music]
[Applause]
i am about to have an aerobatic massage
followed by a hydrafacial
i've had a hydro facial before but it's
been years but i remember
how amazing my skin looked after so i'm
really excited about that
the aerobatic massage i don't really
know what to expect but
that's really exciting to me so yeah
pampering time ayurvedic treatments
combine the 5 000 year old indian
principles
using warm herb essential oils and
targeting pressure points
they are designed to create balance
among the mind body
and spirit and help the body heal itself
so this is strawberries yeah
it smells so good you want to eat it
and i smell like a
delicious fruit vegetable salad
[Music]
so this is a different type of hydra
facial than i typically
typically gotten it's a more natural
approach
an aerobatic approach to it and
using all like organic natural products
so good we'll see if i look 10 years
younger
feels good nonetheless
[Music]
a little post-workout epsom salt
sunset chili time
there's no one else around
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
the question was what is wellness this
is interesting it's a global wellness
summit and the question is what is
wellness
so here was the four seasons the ritz
carlton uh techno gym all these big big
big big big corporations
asking the question what is wellness and
they would have these you know everybody
would sit around and talk about
trying to figure out what was bonus and
what they came down to
is authenticity
community conversations good food
a nature and i was like wait i got all
that
so i knew then that i had a life purpose
and i knew that i had a reason
to be divorced i knew i had a reason to
move forward why i bought this property
it wasn't just to save a family member
from
you know bankruptcy it was literally
because this was my destiny
[Music]
it's so important to take me time it
could be a day
it could be a weekend it can be a week
whatever it is
just take time for yourself it's showing
yourself love
and when you have more love for yourself
you have more love
to give to others when you have time to
relax
and recharge you come back the best
version of yourself
for yourself for your sanity and for
your family
and that is so important
you
