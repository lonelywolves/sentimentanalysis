costa rica has quickly become one of our
favorite places in the world
so much so we purchase land in an
eco-community in the country
where we are in the process of building
our dream home
as we explore every corner of costa rica
as a family we'll be sharing what we
discover with you to help you plan your
next escape to this super diverse
and adventure filled country
[Music]
in this video we are in monteverde
we'll be sharing our favorite things to
do in the district as a family
we'll be spending time in a hummingbird
garden at a coffee cacao
and sugar cane farm doing a night walk
and spending time with a bunch of sloths
in a sloth habitat
we're in a sloth habitat right now so
there's
20 sloths in here and they've either
been
injured in the past or their parent was
injured and they were abandoned as a
baby
so they were brought here they were
rehabilitated
and this is where they live in the
safety of this habitat
[Music]
isn't that cool
[Music]
they're fed they're taken care of they
can interact with other sloths
and if there are other sloths that do
get injured
this place is contacted and they work
with a sanctuary
that that fixes them with a vet and then
rehabilitates them and introduces them
back into the wild
kai has taken the role of uh a tour
guide so she is showing us all the
sloths i hope you
enjoy the show
where kai where is it where's the sloth
where is it yeah tell me all about the
sauce show me
where is it here where
oh there it is
[Music]
the other one's moving show me show me

females so it's sisters
over here i think i see them
they're moving they're moving
they're moving okay show me show me show

hi what's the sloth doing baby
mingle
[Music]
it's so tiny so tiny
so tiny you cannot leave salvatura park
without visiting the hummingbird park it
is
magical
this is a pretty magical experience
i thought visiting the hummingbirds is a
little lame but this
is this is a cool experience they're
landing on our fingers
and eating
so light and so
light i feel like i can feel his
heartbeat
through his legs and it's like
as fast as someone can beat a drum
like it's so fast
you want to try by yourself
for you okay
oh so magical
i like them i like them too
it's so magical right look at that kai
wow no you don't pet him
but you can put your fing you can put
your finger there and he'll want to pet
him you put your hand under like dada
[Music]
today is an exciting day i'm extra
excited today we are on a farm and we're
going to be learning about sugar cane
coffee and chocolate but not just
learning tasting
that's the best part let's be real
robusto is a better plant to grow is
easier
faster more um
resistant to diseases and all that kind
of stuff
right so it's an easy plant to grow that
makes it pretty cheap compared to
arabica
arabic is the opposite it's so
complicated and difficult to grow but
produces better coffee
when you're doing first class coffee
when you're doing gourmet coffee will be
100 arabica and that's what we're trying
to do in costa rica
[Music]
this is the coffee bean and the whole
thing is edible so you can actually eat
the fruit around it as well
you want to try
do you like it it's a little sweet huh
and then there's like a
some of the fruit around the bean itself
and you can suck on that do you wanna
try see here
so much sweeter than i expected
here is where all the magic happens to
make
that cup of coffee that you so deeply
enjoy
so first this is where they wash the
beans and it washes off like the red
skin
then they gotta take it and dry it once
it's dried
they come on over to this second coffee
peeler and it peels off the second layer
so this is before the
second peeler and that's after yeah kind
of like
that's what happened in there
and then comes the weighing machine
and this weighs the coffee beans and
separates them that way
and then this is the size the sorter by
size and it sorts out the coffee beans
by their size
because there's first class and second
class coffee and
the small tiny beans and the larger
beans are second class and then there's
like that
that really sweet spot size of a bean
that's the first class
and then comes over here and this is the
coffee roast
and then it goes into a bag and then you
buy it and then you make your coffee and
voila locals didn't make chocolate
before they used to eat the beans for
example into drinks
something very popular it was a drink
that was called sopolatel
which it was a fermented drink from the
top of it actually
is the origin of the word chocolati
it's not what you would expect i guess
from
[Music]
he loves cacao i love
raw cacao more people don't eat the
inside don't bite it
but it's very bitter but i really like
it yeah this is this is chocolate
so you would you get the bean on the
inside and then you would roast it and
crush it
and then if you want to add sugar to it
so it's not just raw cacao so it's not
as bitter and it gets more sweet
um you can do that or some people add
add milk to it so they get milk
chocolate but
then you're getting further and further
away from the real taste
look the inside is actually purple
this is how they grind up chocolate to
make your
much-loved chocolate bars still today
burn off those calories before you eat
them
i can do this this is pretty sweet
back in the day they used to use an oxen
uh
and it's called this whole like system
is called a uh
and that's how they used to squeeze the
the cane juice out of the sugar cane
nowadays they use this water powered
mill and it turns so the water
powers the mill makes it turn and then
powers the
rest of the machine which crushes the
sugar cane and crushes out the water and
the sugar
into this bucket and then they can take
that sugar cane juice
melt it down into a molasses and that's
how they they get the the beginning
process of making
sugar depending on if you want brown
sugar white sugar there's more to it but
that's how they make the molasses
these ox they do this twice a day to
show like how they used to do it and
then they get you just room for you for
the rest of the day so that makes me
happy
well this is a sugar cane that has been
melted down into like molasses
and put spread it on um do i know this
is the best part of the whole tour this
is like why we came here
really it's fun to learn how it's made
but it's better
to even eat it he's made that
he made it yeah so it was melted down
kai
and then put on a table pound it a
little bit and then it hardens and it
makes this delicious treat
one of the most popular things to do in
monteverde is a night hike
it's a great opportunity to see some of
the most incredible wildlife
in the country
what kind of animals are we going to see
monkeys what else kai
um
wow this is gonna be fun yeah so i'm
jason um
i have been living in monteverdi for
about 10 years and then i have a
background on forest management and
wildlife
night tours in monteverde are one of the
main activities that people like to do
yeah because most of the species are
active in the night uh
talking about the bigger animals like
most of the bigger mammals like the
slugs
porcupines armadillos and you know
different species
also many amphibians and reptiles can be
active at night
it's also nice to feel the photos in the
night like
which is another different experience
like you can hear a lot of different
sounds and also
when we get a nice clear sky you can see
the nice stars on the moon
what do you see kai beetles yeah
it's up there
little birds
it's so neat to explore the jungle at
night i've really been enjoying this
night hike
we've seen two cans we've seen frogs
we've seen
monkeys and uh even an armadillo we saw
an armadillo we didn't get a chance to
film it but
i definitely i saw it with my own eyes
we're gonna turn off the camera now and
continue this jungle mission
thank you guys for tuning in and next
week we're going to be exploring
a whole new part about costa rica and
showcasing
our favorite things to do
