- Hey everyone.
My name is Siya Zarrabi.
And if you're new to this channel,
you've never watched our videos before,
we make travel content.
We have over 500 videos
teaching people how to travel.
But we've never made a video like this.
This video is going to be about
keeping your home safe when you travel.
And the last thing you want is
you go off, you have
this amazing adventure,
you go on vacation, you
have an amazing time,
you come home, a window's
broken and your TV's gone.
Now using the information in this video
hopefully we can avoid
these type of situations.
(upbeat music)
- [Narrator] Here is how
to keep your home safe
when you travel.
- Ring has partnered with
us to make this video.
It's their mission to
make neighborhoods safer
and it's our mission in this video
to help make your home
safer when you travel.
Now they have video doorbells,
they have floodlights,
they have security systems,
they have cameras for inside your house,
and we have a whole system setup here
so when we're away we can check in
we can make sure that things are good.
And the video doorbell, so handy!
Like if someone comes to our
door and rings the doorbell
I get a notification on my phone
and I can see who's there
and I can talk to them.
I was never able to do that before!
So, so handy.
Ring also has a special
offer for you guys,
so stay tuned to the rest of the video
to find out what it is.
Without further ado here are
15 ways to keep your home safe
while you travel.
- [Narrator] Ask neighbors
to pick up your mail.
- This is the simplest thing to do
to make your house not
look like it's vacant:
like no one's around; no
one's handling the mail;
no one's picking anything up.
If you have newspapers just
piling up on the front porch,
if your mailbox is overflowing
and exploding with letters,
that's a key indication
that nobody is home.
Have a neighbor pick this up,
keep it in a pile for you
for when you get back.
That way it looks like
someone is coming in and out of the house
and cleaning the mail.
- [Narrator] Have a friend stay over.
- If you have a friend with roommates
or they're living with their parents
or they have just a place
that isn't that nice
and they want to stay in your place,
offer it up to them
because it will be used.
Lights will be going on and off,
people coming in and out,
cars going
(car starting)
in and out of the driveway,
that way, you know,
if someone is looking at
your house to break in,
they won't,
because they see that someone
is coming in and out of the house.
- [Narrator] Leave a light on inside.
- Not just your front porch.
If your front porch is on at night,
sure that might deter some people.
But if it's on all day and then all night
and then all day and all night
it's a little obvious
that no one's turning off
this front porch light.
So what I recommend to do
is turn on a light on
the inside of the house
so that you kind of see
like through the window
or through the curtains
that a light is on inside
so someone must be inside.
You can also have a
light that is on a timer.
So at a certain hour it goes
on and then it goes off.
Kind of like your Christmas lights.
You can probably use the exact same timer
for just a lamp or something else
that it turns on and turns off.
You can also use this
for a radio too.
(radio tuning to channel)
So if you want some noise
that's inside the house
that way, you know, it
can deter some people
if they're approaching your house
and they hear noise coming from inside.
Some of these tips are going
to seem like common sense,
others you have probably
never heard of before.
- [Narrator] Lock
all doors and windows.
(doors locking)
- It seems obvious!
I know that my parents lock
their doors and their windows.
So I thought, until I lost my key
when I was like 15 years
old and I needed to get in
and like half the windows where unlocked.
So, make sure that all your and
all your windows are locked.
Try and break into your own house.
And if there's a sliding door
and you need to put like a piece of wood
in front of that sliding door, do it!
Make sure that nobody
can get into your house.
I know, it seems like common sense.
But people aren't doing it.
- [Narrator] Don't tell
people you are leaving.
- If you're on the phone
(phone rings)
with a telemarketer
and they're like, "Hey, how're you doing?"
And you're like, "Yeah, great!
"I'm packing for a trip
to Mexico for two weeks."
That's telling a stranger
that you're going to be gone,
you're house is vacant.
If you have a plumber
come in or a repair guy
and they see that you're packing bags.
You tell them, "Oh yeah,
"I'll be gone from this day to this day.
"I'll be back on the 18th."
They're like, "Oh, okay.
"Interesting, this house
will be completely empty
"until the 18th."
Don't tell people that you don't know
that you're leaving.
- [Narrator] Leave a car in the driveway.
- I did some research before this video
to look at what people
who break into houses
are looking for.
What are key indications that a house
is going to be good to get into
and leave without a trace.
Often it's houses that are vacant,
when there's no car in the driveway,
when there's lights off,
when mail's piling up,
when all this stuff is going on
that indicates nobody is home.
So, leaving a car in the driveway
is a key indication that somebody is home.
If you don't have a car
to leave in the driveway,
if you left on a road trip,
ask a neighbor to leave
their car in your driveway.
Tell them that they can park
it there at the end of the day
and leave and take their
car in the morning.
- [Narrator] Make it look occupied.
- So you can leave dirty shoes outside.
You can leave the blinds
open on the second story.
That's a key indication
that someone's upstairs
and they might be looking out of a window.
If everything is closed all the time
that might seem like it's
obvious nobody's home.
But if some of the blinds
are open on the top floor
where no one can can actually
get and see through a window
that way it might deter someone
from coming into your house.
- [Narrator] Get the lawn
mowed or shovel the driveway.
- Make sure your lown is being mowed
while you're away.
(lawn mower revving)
If it's in winter and you're leaving
make sure someone is
shoveling your driveway.
Pay the kid down the street in advance
to mow your lawn or shovel your driveway.
That way it's obvious that, you know,
the house is being
maintained, someone's home.
- [Narrator] Have security cameras.
- We currently use the Ring system.
So it creates like a ring of
security around our place.
We have cameras setup so we
can always log into our phone.
We can make sure that
everything's okay at home.
We can just check in on stuff,
which is really nice that, you know,
Ring's cameras are setup
to be on our cellphones.
So I can check in right here
and I can see different rooms,
I can see the outside.
I can make sure that everything is okay
while we're away.
Ring also has a doorbell camera feature.
So if someone comes to
your house with a package
or they ring your bell,
you actually get notified on your phone
and then you can check
in and see who's there.
You can talk to them.
Sometimes people will try
and see if anyone's home
and ring the bell.
If no one answers the door
they know nobody's home.
But if you can answer remotely,
they don't if you're home
or if you're in Thailand
or if you're in Chile or
if you're in South Africa,
it's all the same thing.
You can pick up your phone,
you can see their face,
you can even screen capture
it if you really want,
but you can communicate with that person.
That is a huge, huge deterrent
from anyone thinking that nobody is home.
As a listener you have a special offer
on the Ring starter kit
available right now.
The kit includes a Video Doorbell
and motion-activated Spotlight Cam,
which is actually everything you need
to start building a ring of
security around your home.
To get this offer, you just
have to go to ring.com/htg.
It's great that some of their cameras
are also battery-powered.
So you put it in a specific
location that you want.
If you want it aimed out the window,
if you want it aimed
at a door, a back door,
a basement door, whatever,
you can do that because
it's battery-powered.
So if you're gone for
the day or the weekend
it's easy to just move a camera
and you don't have to deal with any wires.
- [Narrator] Cancel deliveries and mail.
- So you can actually
put your mail on hold.
If you call the post office
and you just say like,
"Hey, can you hold on to my mail
"for the next like two weeks,"
That can be done really easily.
You can also, like if you
have Amazon orders coming in,
you can just put them on hold
or make sure that nothing
is being delivered
and left at your door when you're away.
That being said, with the Ring system,
if someone rings your doorbell
and you get a notification on your phone
and you're not there,
you can just tell them
to take the package,
you're not going to be
home for the next hour
even though you might
be gone for a few weeks.
Remove the package so
nothing's left at your door.
- [Narrator] Disable garage door opener.
- If you guys have
a remote garage door opener,
(garage door opening)
did you know that there are
universal garage door openers?
I know, I was just as
shocked, I didn't know.
Someone could just drive around
with a universal remote opener
and try and open my door.
That's, that's scary.
A lot of people's garages have
a lot of valuables in them.
And some of them actually
lead into the house.
And how often do you lock that door?
- [Narrator] Keep valuables
safe and out of sight.
- If you have a window
without curtains in it,
well first of all get curtains
but if you have a window without curtains
don't have anything valuable
sitting on the other side of that window.
Someone can come in and see.
You could peek in, there's
a fancy watch by the window,
or, you know, there's
a phone sitting there.
You forgot your phone
and you went traveling,
oh my god!
Don't leave your valuables sitting around.
- [Narrator] Label your luggage safely.
- When I'm traveling I put a luggage tag
on the outside of my luggage.
I put my address there, I put my name,
I put my phone number,
I put my email address.
Everything, all my information,
is sitting on this tag
on a piece of luggage that tells anyone
that sees that piece of luggage
no one is at this address.
I had never thought of this before.
But anyone who handles my luggage
knows that I'm not there.
What's recommended is that
instead of putting it on the outside,
you can put your name on the outside
but put your address on the inside.
Put it in on piece of paper or somewhere
so that if it gets lost
and they open it up,
they see your address on the inside
and they can get it back to you.
If you're concerned about
putting your home address
on this piece of paper at all,
then I recommend putting it somewhere else
where you regularly go.
Put it to a gym that you go to.
Put it to your work address.
Somewhere else that isn't your home.
- [Narrator] Don't announce
you're leaving on social media.
- Because that opens it up to strangers
and friends of friends
and friends and friends
and friends of friends
to know that you are away.
People like us,
we take pictures of us packing,
us at the airport, us leaving real-time.
Maybe I shouldn't have said that.
We have security cameras
and a dog.
(dog barking)
- [Narrator] Move the
spare key from outside.
- Yeah, a lot of people have
their spare key under a mat,
on doorsill, in a windowsill,
under a plant, under a fake rock,
just people leave a key
within like five, 10
meters of their front door.
You know how easy it is to
have like a little magnet
and find the key?
Or to look under stuff?
It's pretty easy.
So make sure not to do this.
Anyone who wants to break into your house
is going to see a plant
and try and pick it up
and look for a key here and there.
And then easily just
(door unlocking)
get in.
I hope that these tips
really helped you guys out.
I want you to be safe when you travel.
And I want your home to
be safe when you travel.
Home is a temple, is a safe place.
I want all your stuff inside to be safe.
And using some or all of these tips
can hopefully deter somebody
from entering your house,
stop a dramatic situation from happening,
because the worst thing
at the end of a trip
is to come and now you
have to deal with a problem
at home.
So use these and prevent
a possible situation
from happening.
If I missed anything,
if you guys do things
that I didn't talk about
let me know.
I'm sure that there's way
more out there in the world
to deter someone from coming in.
So, thank you guys very much for watching.
And I'll see you next video.
Bye.
