[Music]
we have begun
packing up for our move to costa rica
for the past year we have lived in this
house
we actually haven't shared much about
this house
but this is where we spent our
quarantine and we bought this house last
year
with our friends and their two kids and
we've been
here together for the past 12 months now
we're ready to move on to the next
adventure so
we're actually going to be renting out
this house we have a forest
in our backyard we have a fire pit down
there
huge barbecue so it's like awesome for
hosting people
this has been hopscotch headquarters
this
right angle triangle here under the
stairs like harry potter if he had a
business online
one thing we loved about this house was
this massive balcony
because we could have like 30 people on
here well that was a plan
until like we got restricted and then
nobody could visit
and we also had a place for luna so luna
was
able to stay here on our property which
was super
handy what are you up to um
just cleaning up the kitchen putting
some packing our stuff away that we
don't want to leave here because we have
this place up on airbnb
um and other sites we're renting it out
full-time so
i'm just getting it ready for that yeah
looking for my phone i know i left it
nope kristen's packing in this room
this is our first suitcase that we've
ever owned that's
larger than a carry-on we've always
traveled with carry-ons
or just backpacks like backpacking
backpacks now that we have a kid
and we have to pack more stuff we
decided to upgrade
it's crazy after 15 years of travel this
is our first
large suitcase i'm actually kind of
proud of that
there's my phone
[Music]
okay now to the airstream
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
okay i'm going to be storing
the airstream in like an hour from now
so i got some stuff i need to do in here
to make sure that it's safe
for storage i have to remove the
batteries because the batteries are
connected right now
i also need to make sure that this
fridge is cleaned out
and it looks pretty clean
i had to make sure that the water is
disconnected and drained
there is no water in the pipes so that
it you know won't freeze over winter not
that it would we're storing it indoors
and it's heated but i still want to like
drain all the pipes just to make sure
that it's it's good
i guess then i just need to hitch it up
to the truck and drive it to the storage
unit
of all the updates we did to luna this
season
this is the one thing we didn't get to
this is a brand new ac
unit from dometic and they sent us the
new fridge
the dc fridge which means we could be
off-grid and still have our fridge
running and a new ac unit because the
one we have
is pretty old and not that efficient
was really hoping to do it but then the
weather started getting cold and then
we couldn't install it but at least we
have it so at the beginning of next
season
when we take luna out of storage in like
three four months
we'll have this brand new ac unit i
can't wait
i couldn't wait i was too excited i
cracked it open
it's not exciting for a lot of people
but for me this is pretty exciting
bye-bye ugly old ac unit there's our
carpet
this is like a big tent for outside
there's our camping chairs
boosted boards kai's little balance bike
espresso machine
oh my god you guys have never seen this
before
what could it be i have not
had this open in years oh
wait we get gas what do you think it is
what do you think it is
[Music]
hercules dj console steel
this thing was in the lowest class of
dj gear you could possibly get this is
how i dj'd when i dj'd weddings and
events for years
what is it special special
oh more surprise
wow what a good surprise
yeah yeah
our batteries are under this front bench
so i'm just removing all the pillows and
then i can access the batteries and then
i can
detach them here are our batteries
we got four agm
deep cycle 12 volt batteries
these batteries were not cheap i think
it was like
400 bucks of battery i definitely don't
want them to
get wrecked when it's in storage
[Music]
that was it not so scary nobody died
okay ready to hit your up and hit the
road
and we're off hitched up the airstream
have a two hour drive to get to the
storage unit
so far so good
i'm gonna miss you luna that drive was a
lot farther than i expected
i'm like an hour behind schedule and i
still have to drive all the way back
home after unhitching
luna
goodbye luna be safe we'll see you
in a few months we're off to costa rica
avoid the snow avoid the dampness avoid
the cold
this is heated in here so luna will be
safe
we are on route to costa rica first time
in an airport
in like eight months yes
and first time traveling with the
toddler
this is the most empty i've seen this
airport that was a
mad dash
very excited for this trip we made it
costa rica
