how do you afford to travel the world
full-time
it's a question we get asked all the
time
we're kristin and sia the faces behind
hopscotch the globe
we've recently partnered with airbnb to
bring you our new series called
meet your host we'll be traveling around
the world visiting unique airbnb stays
and learning the stories from each host
that brought them to life
in this episode we're sharing our story
of being airbnb
house and giving you the inspiration to
become one yourself
this is meet your host
we're currently staying in a jungle
lodge in costa rica
surrounded by the forest and that's
entirely being paid for
by our house back in canada in the last
two months we've made twenty thousand
dollars with this new business venture
now you don't need to be a social media
influencer or have
a following at all all you need is a
unique space
or some land this new business venture
of ours is being airbnb
house we have been guests for years
traveling the world staying
in different places but now we are house
renting out our
own home even if you don't want to rent
out your home you want to stay in your
home if you have land
you can build something unique on your
property as an additional guest house
it can be a tiny house it could be
renovating a trailer or an airstream
or a van that stays put you can like
honestly
the possibilities are endless and you're
gonna get so much inspiration from
this series as we dive deep into
different hosts around the world who
have unique airbnb stays
their story their successes how they
even started
and how it's given them so much freedom
[Applause]
last year in 2020 our industry took a
huge hit
travel just shut down planes were
grounded people were not crossing
borders
yeah and that's that's like our form of
income we lost a lot of business
yeah plans that we had um tens of
thousands of dollars
just you know like taking back basically
because it couldn't happen
right thankfully a few months before the
entire world shut down
we had purchased a house with our
friends so we purchased
a four bedroom chalet on top of a
mountain
in like a cool touristy area near a ski
hill
and we realized shortly after moving in
that
it's an awesome rental opportunity i
didn't really understand how much money
we could make off of our place
but when i saw two months worth of
rent from one person equal twenty
thousand dollars and it just like
went into our bank account my mind was
blown i was like
i can't believe like we've been sitting
on this much money
for the last year and i just want to
create so many more unique stays so i
can
also put those on airbnb because the
possibilities are really endless and
it's
fun this is such a new fun venture that
is
not completely separate from what we're
doing because it still like has to do
with travel
but it's separate from hopscotch the
globe and it
it's created more of a passive income
for us
and the great thing about all of this is
that anybody can do it
[Music]
our house is in one of the most
beautiful areas of ontario in canada
called the blue mountains now blue
mountain is
famous for being a top ski and snowboard
area
of ontario and up until recently i
didn't even know that there were houses
built
on top of the mountain it's about a five
minute walk to the top
of the ski lifts which means you can
walk from our house
with your skis or your snowboard and
literally
ski down the mountain the house is on a
half acre property
backing on to 25 acres of protected
forest the house is a four bedroom two
bathroom space
with everything you need when you rent a
space
when you first walk in through the front
door there's a huge mud room
when you make your way into the house
there's two bedrooms on the main
floor the other room we had set up for
the kids
[Music]
making your way up the stairs to the top
floor
this is the main area this is where we
spent most of our time
this is where the full-size kitchen is
where the dining room is
where the living room is there's a
fireplace that
keeps the entire house warm the main
living space has
20 foot high ceilings which really opens
it up
attached to the main living space is an
enormous deck
enough for probably 50 people to be out
there
you can have barbecues out there you can
sunbathe out there you can say hi to
your neighbors
and on some days you can overlook
georgian bay
the house has not one but two master
bedrooms
each equipped with their own unique
feature the first bedroom
has a king-size bed it has a large
ceiling
so you really feel that openness and it
also has
its own private balcony the balcony
overlooks the bonfire in the backyard
and the 25 acres of forest that are
behind the house
[Music]
the other bedroom is my favorite space
in the house
it has so many cool unique features it
has a huge closet
but it also has a little space under the
staircase
for a working desk and the stairs lead
to a loft
in the same room so this is the loft
room
and up above is a king bed is a skylight
is a beautiful circular window that
overlooks the backyard
and you can see birds and woodland
creatures it's a
really fun unique space the house has
two bathrooms a smaller bathroom down
below with
a shower and a toilet but the bigger
bathroom is up above
which also has a bidet we didn't use the
bidet but
if you want to you can
using airbnb as a host is super easy
just as it is
as a guest we signed up that same day we
took photos of our house
and we put up the description and
listed our place and within a couple of
weeks we had
several inquiries of people wanting to
stay in our place and this is during a
pandemic
so you can imagine the inquiries we're
going to get when all this is you know
over and done with and people are
traveling even more
it got us really excited to see the
possibilities of what this
new business venture could do for us now
you guys have seen our home it's a
pretty cool space right
and a great business opportunity and if
this hasn't given you enough inspiration
