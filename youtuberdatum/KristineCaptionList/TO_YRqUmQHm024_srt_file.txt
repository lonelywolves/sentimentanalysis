- It was no surprise to me to hear
that Toronto has been named
one of the top destinations
to visit in 2019 by NatGeo.
It is one of my favorite
places in the world,
in the world, because
it is so multicultural.
You can travel around
the world in a day here,
so today, I am taking part
in the Interac $100 Challenge
where I'll be spending only $100,
going around Toronto in a day
and visiting some of my favorite places.
(calm accordion music)
We're starting the day off
right with an espresso.
I'm in Little Italy at a Sicilian cafe.
I'm also gonna have a cannoli.
You can't have an
espresso without a cannoli
and I know this because I'm Sicilian
and I gotta do it right.
I don't even add sugar.
You don't need it if you
are having good espresso.
Zing!
If you've never had a cannoli before,
you're missing out, first of all.
Second of all, go get one, now.
Now.
Mmm, oh, so good, mmm.
What I love about this place is,
you get authentic espresso,
authentic cannoli,
hand-made here, good quality
coffee right from Italy,
using Italian espresso machines.
I pretty much feel like
I'm in Italy and I've been,
so I could close my eyes,
sip on this espresso,
eat this cannoli, and be like,
where am I again? (laughs)
I'll pay Interac.
(register dings)
(calm accordion music)
That was delicioso,
and when you only have one
day to explore a place,
you don't wanna waste any time,
which is why Interac Flash is so great,
'cause you just touch to pay and go
for any purchases under a
hundred dollars, and also,
you're paying from your own account
when you use Interac debit,
so you don't have to pay
any bills or interest later.
(calm Indian music)
I'm now in Little India.
I'm heading to an Indian
wedding later this year,
so I'm actually looking for
some sort of item of jewelry.
Something that's gonna make a statement.
This is the place to find just that
and also, for cheap.
There's a store right here.
I'm gonna head in and see
if I can find something.
(calm Indian music)
There's a hidden gem in this shop.
There's actually an
upstairs and they have more
bridal stuff and jewelry, so
that's where I'm gonna head
and see what I can find.
(calm Indian music)
I love India for many reasons,
but especially how colorful it is
and the fashion is unbelievable.
Look at the work here.
So unbelievable.
Can I see that one?
Thank you.
- [Woman] Are you guys done?
I just finished too.
- I got these bangles!
So pretty.
Five bucks, that's a steal.
There's this restaurant across
the street called Moti Mahal.
Supposed to be really good.
Been recommended by people
who work in this area
and people who live in this area,
so that is where I'm goin'.
I'm gonna get myself some Indian food.
Yeah, so I'll get the veggie thali.
Yeah.
I'll do a mango lassi.
- All for here or to go?
- For here, yeah.
- Anything else?
- Nope, that's all.
(register dings)
That's a lot of food for $10.
My god.
And a mango lassi!
Indian culture, you use
your hands when you eat
because you don't want the
taste of metal in your mouth
and it's just like more of an experience
when you're eating with your hands.
You get to feel your food.
It's just a more intimate experience.
That's what I love about it.
The intimacy of it all.
I got some malai kofta,
palak paneer, aloo gobi,
got some naan, we got some rice.
Damn good!
Holy crap, that is good.
I love malai kofta.
I love that I was just in Little Italy,
having an espresso, and now,
I'm in Little India, having Indian food.
It's like I traveled across
the world all in a day
and it's all in Toronto.
I love that.
I love that about this city.
So multicultural.
Mmm, and it's like real authentic flavors.
Real authentic India.
Authentic Italy, mmm.
(calm Indian music)
I was just in Little India,
now I'm in Korea Town.
I jumped on the subway, I'm
here, very short travel time,
and I'm gonna do some
karaoke, some shopping,
and there's even a poop cafe.
We're definitely going to that.
Because poop cafe.
(calm music)
Getting some of these.
I wonder how much they are?
1.50?
Sweet, they're so cute!
That's what I love about Korean culture,
'cause it's like being
a kid forever. (laughs)
As an adult, they appreciate
this type of stuff,
like Pikachu!
There's even a popsicle stick.
I've never wanted to eat
socks until now. (laughs)
This is so cute.
A little moon light for Kai!
Yeah, she'll like it, yeah.
That was so much fun.
That was like stepping into Korea.
So much fun!
I ended up getting a light, some magnets,
and some nail art tattoo thingies
that are just super, super cute
and now I'm gonna go eat some poop.
(upbeat music)
Let's go!
Oh my god, that's awesome.
The fact that it says have
a nice poop makes me smile.
(upbeat music)
I wanted to go to Korea
for years, so I've done
a lot of research on cool
places to see and things to do
and when I came across an
article on a poop cafe,
I was like, that's just the only reason
I need to go to Korea.
And I heard that they had one in Toronto.
I got so excited.
Here I am, about to experience
my first toilet ice cream.
If only my poop actually looked like this
when it landed in the toilet. (laughs)
It's so weird, but I love it.
Mmm.
I love the weird Korean culture.
Awesome, so fun.
(calm music)
(laughs) Well, this is
gonna make me sound better.
Karaoke is super popular
in Korea, so here I am,
in Korea Town, singing karaoke.
All by myself.
That's all I see, despite the camera.
Yeah!
