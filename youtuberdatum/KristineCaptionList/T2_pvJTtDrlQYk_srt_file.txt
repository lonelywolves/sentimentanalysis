we are on route to costa rica first time
in an airport
in like eight months yes
and first time traveling with the
toddler and during coven
this is the most empty i've seen this
airport
this is one of the biggest airports in
the world looks like there's a lot of
flights on the board but
not that many people
we have a mask for kai she uh isn't
required
to wear it she likes wearing it for a
little bit and then rips it off
so i'm not gonna pressure her good job
hey kai
you like daddy's mask
[Music]
wow look how big it is
protocol in the airport during kovid was
they checked their temperature i also
stood in front of some like
huge camera that i guess was taking
the entire reading of my body
temperature we had to prove that we had
travel insurance um it was mandatory and
mandatory that it was
covered for covid up to i think thirty
thousand
fifty fifty thousand fifty thousand u.s
um covered for cloven um like medical
expenses and stuff
and then two thousand at minimum two
thousand for uh
logic so if you get sick and you need
somewhere to stay right and that was
just for costa rica every country
is gonna require something different on
a positive note i have never seen a
plane
so clean i don't see any crumbs i don't
see any dirt
nothing wow and still
listen okay extra precautions
hi hi
hi this is your first time flying and
remembering it i bet
right are you on an airplane yeah
where are we going
costa rica
what do they say in costa rica um
yeah very excited for this trip
we're going to see our land we're going
to meet some of the neighbors that
bought into the community
we're going to eat so much good food
amazing fruit
be in hot weather avoid winter
the key to keeping a toddler entertained
and happy on a plane is bringing
presents you want your present
and this i think was a great idea
oh you know what this is what is it
[Music]

pocket
there's a whole adventure world in here
ready one two three
right here whoa
we need to be careful we don't drop them

this is gonna keep her occupied the
whole flight yeah
that's right
[Music]
the weather conditions as you're
probably aware of beautiful uh sunny
skies down there
gonna be a high of 28 degrees with
probably just the odds of cloud maybe a
chance of a thunderstorm but
overall beautiful conditions we have a
great crew today so sit back relax
we hope you enjoy the flight here
in on this guys and uh kai's been
sleeping
