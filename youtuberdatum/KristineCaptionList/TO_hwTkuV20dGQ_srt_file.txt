- Oh my God, Siya.
You're gonna die.
It's so good.
- Mm, wow!
- Yeah, happy cooking!
Look at that, we are experiencing Thailand
in our own kitchen.
- Yeah, my mouth is like,
my mouth just traveled.
- If you just close your
eyes, it's like you're there.
(upbeat music)
Hopscotch the Globe isn't
just about traveling
halfway across the world
to experience a culture.
We want to show you
that you can bring culture
into your day-to-day life
in the comfort of your home
and one of the greatest ways
to do that is by cooking food
from different cultures.
Thailand is one of our favorite countries
and one of the reasons why
it is, is because the food
is so delicious.
I love being able to cook
it at home and kind of
reminisce about our experiences
that we've had throughout
our travels in Thailand, and
get a taste of the country
just in Canada.
In my own kitchen and that's
what I wanna bring to you guys.
These recipes are really easy
to make and super delicious,
authentic, I learned how to make them
on the streets of Bangkok.
So let's get cookin' some
Pad Thai, we're going to make
some mango sticky rice,
and some Thai iced tea.
First up, we're going to make
some street style Pad Thai.
This is a super simple, fast recipe.
You can make it in under
20 minutes, easily.
So, if you're looking for
something to cook tonight,
that doesn't take long,
is super delicious,
and very cultural, Pad
Thai is the way to go.
For the Pad Thai itself, you
are going to need: shallots,
fresh chives, tofu, rice
stick noodles, bean sprouts,
palm sugar, an egg, some
peanuts, and sesame seeds.
Okay, so I'm gonna chop up some tofu now.
You wanna rinse your tofu
because it's got all this,
liquidy stuff, and we don't want that.
Yes, you might hear a
baby in the background.
She wants Pad Thai, she's
like, "Mom, Pad Thai, now!"
And she's only three months, what?
What's really cool is Pad
Thai, the whole history
of it is very interesting,
it was during World War II,
there was a shortage in rice.
So the government was encouraging people
to use noodles instead.
And then, there was this, at the time too,
the prime minister, was
wanting to make Thailand
more independent, and
more, like, Westernized.
So, one of the ways he
wanted to do that was to hold
a cooking competition.
They held a competition,
a cooking competition,
and one of the dishes was Pad Thai.
That is when it was made.
And it became the national dish.
The government even gave
free food stall carts to
restaurants that were willing
to cook and sell Pad Thai
in the streets.
So, that's pretty cool.
Now it's a national dish,
it's like people travel
to Thailand to have authentic Pad Thai.
It's a staple, it's on every menu.
To save time, soak the rice
noodles before you start
cutting everything else up.
I forgot to do that.
So, you can just soak them
in some filtered water
before you throw them on the pan to cook.
As they get soft, I'm just
gonna push them down more,
but I'll set that aside for now.
Before I get cooking
everything, frying all this up,
the onions and the tofu and
that, I am going to make
the Pad Thai sauce.
For the Pad Thai sauce you're
gonna need: palm sugar,
fish sauce, tamarind concentrate.
I'm using this ginger tamarind sauce mix
which I really like, 'cause I love ginger.
And sriracha, sha-ra-ra-racha.
You know what I'm talkin' about.
You're gonna wanna bring
the sauce to a boil.
So, we're gonna turn that up.
As soon as it starts
bubbling, I'm gonna turn it
right off and take the
sauce off the burner.
Does that smell yummy?
You can't try it yet though.
Maybe a little bit, a
little bit of the sauce.
What do you think?
This part happens really fast.
So, I'm just taking some coconut oil,
so I can fry up the onion and the tofu.
I put in the shallot and
I'm gonna add in the tofu.
Not the green onions just yet.
Hey, green onion got in there.
Sneaky guys, that's okay.
Okay, while that tofu gets a
nice golden brown, I wanted
to share that you don't have
to constantly be traveling
to experience a culture.
That's not realistic for most people.
Most people only have a
couple weeks, three weeks
out of the year to travel
and experience a new culture.
But, you can do it in the
comforts of your own home,
and a great way to do
that is through food.
So, that's why we are
cooking today and we're gonna
be doing more cooking
tutorials and cooking videos
on this channel.
I'm just gonna drain out this water.
(water splashing)
That's pretty good for right now, yeah.
All right, I'm gonna add in the noodles.
Whoop!
(sizzling)
Along with 1/4 cup of water.
Just let the noodles get nice and soft.
Do a little dance, make
a little love, and wait.
I'm letting the noodles cook
for about five minutes or so.
If you're adding egg, which
you would in the traditional
street Pad Thai, you push
the noodles and the tofu
to the side and then just
crack the egg in the other side
of the pan.
(sizzling)
I'm just gonna let that cook up.
Now we're gonna add in the sauce.
(sizzling)
Mm, that looks so good.
It smells amazing.
Buying all these ingredients
isn't that expensive either.
It's a very affordable dish to make.
Especially if you have a big
family or you have friends
coming over and you want to impress them.
(baby cooing)
Yeah!
Throw those in, bam!
Thai, Thai (laughing) Ky is
getting a little impatient
she wants her Pad Thai.
That is done, we can set
it aside and move on.
(upbeat music)
The hardest part about this
is (laughing) not eating
all of the mango beforehand.
Maybe just a little piece is okay, right?
Oh, mm, mm!
We also have some water
boiling for the Thai iced tea
which we are gonna be making.
I'm gonna add four tablespoons
to two cups of water.
You can add more depending
on how strong you want it.
I find four tablespoons
to two cups of water
is perfect for my preference.
It smells heavenly in here.
I can smell the rice
and I can smell the tea.
The mixture of the two, the
combination, is like making
this whole place smell so delicious.
So sweet.
Now that the coconut milk
and sugar/salt combination
has come to a boil, I turned it right off
and I'm going to transfer
the rice, the sticky rice,
into this pot.
And also, make sure it's
taken off the burner.
I'm gonna let the rice
absorb the coconut milk.
I'm gonna leave it covered, in the pot,
for about 30 minutes.
I'm gonna finish off the
Thai iced tea and then we can
have our Thai iced tea, eat
our Pad Thai, and by the time
that's all done, our
dessert will be ready.
What I'm gonna do is, I'm
gonna pour the tea into
my French press.
You can also use cheesecloth to do this.
I just find that the french
press is a lot easier
and a lot less messy.
So, then I can sift it
through, right away.
That is some dark tea,
just the way I like it.
And look at that beautiful orange color.
It's so pretty!
Ooh!
And I can actually add some
more ice to this because
it's already melted.
(baby fussing)
So good!
Oh my God!
Mm, I might not share with Siya.
And that is it, we got
three Thai experiences
for my taste buds to dance over.
We're gonna devour it in a sec.
