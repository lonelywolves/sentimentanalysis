- Ever since our lives have
become one big road trip,
a lot of you guys have reached out to us
asking us how you too
can live life on the road
and how do you go about choosing
the right vehicle to do it.
In this video Siya and I
are going to be exploring
three different vehicles.
The first one is going
to be a van that is ready
to be converted but has
not been converted yet,
and that has enough space to create
some sort of living space
and if possible, even a
shower and toilet area.
The second vehicle we're
going to be looking at
is either going to be a truck or an SUV,
something that can either pull a trailer
or you can add a trailer-type
cap to the back of it.
The third vehicle is going to
be an already converted van,
so something that's ready to
go, you can move in right away
and it might need a few
tweaks here and there
but it's ready to hit the road.
We've partnered with Auto Trader,
who is sponsoring this
video, autotrader.ca
as well as their mobile app, makes it easy
to search for vehicles and cars in Canada
and there's such a wide variety
of vehicles to choose from.
You can search for
vehicles by postal code,
by budget, or from distance
where you are located.
Another great thing is,
you can set yourself up for
email alerts, so when the vehicle
that you're interested in,
the price drops for it, you
get notified right away.
You can find the best
deals for your own vehicle
on Auto Trader, when we
were looking for a truck
to pull our Airstream, we
checked out autotrader.ca first,
and when it comes time to sell our truck
we will be selling on Auto Trader.
(gentle music)
And now, the fun begins.
The treasure hunt for the
perfect conversion vehicle.
So I'm on autotrader.ca right
now, the desktop version
and I'm gonna enter in
the make of the vehicle,
as well as the model, and our budget.
Our budget we're going to make
for the vehicle that we're searching for,
is going to be 40 thousand dollars,
and that will include the conversion
if we have to do a
conversion, or a trailer,
a cap or whatever.
40 thousand in total is our goal,
if we can go lower than
that, then that's great.
So, let the hunt begin.
So we are on our way to Arlington, Ontario
where we're gonna take a look at a van
that has not yet been
converted but can be converted.
It's a newer van, so it's
gonna be up and running
pretty smoothly, but we
still have to consider
that you have to put money
in to covert the vehicle,
as well as time to convert the vehicle.
(gentle music)
You're just such a good
driver you just like,
drive me all the way to
sleep, it's so smoothing.
That actually got me, I
should have expected that.
- We're now at a car dealership
and this one is within the
budget, which is great.
It leaves some space for
renovations on the inside.
It's a cargo vehicle, so I'm gonna see
how the the interior looks,
I mean it's pretty much
a brand new vehicle, so I think
is should look pretty good.
But just how complicated it would be
for you guys to renovate, if
you were to get this vehicle,
so let's go take a look.
(upbeat music)
Okay, so this is a Ford
Transit it's a 2016,
I think it only has like 30
thousand kilometers on it,
which is great.
So it hasn't gone on a crazy road trip.
It's not ready for a road trip yet.
This car would be very easy
for repairs and finding parts,
especially if you're road
tripping throughout North America,
'cause it's, you know American-made Ford,
so it would be simpler to like,
find parts and stuff for it
and there's dealers all
across the countries
and repair shops that
would have these parts.
Okay,
huge, huge open space,
I mean I can't stand in here,
I'm about like 5'9", maybe like
5'10" with my shoes and hat.
I can't really stand, but
I mean that's totally fine,
that's not that big of a deal.
You spend a lot of your
time outside, not inside.
Once all these seats are out,
and it looks like it's just a few bolts
and you can take them out,
I'd say you have about,
like maybe six by nine feet
to work with, so that's
decent square footage.
I mean you can put a twin or
maybe a queen bed in here.
Having so many windows is nice to see out
if you're at a beautiful view,
but for insulating purposes
and for actually building,
the windows might get in the way.
- [Kristen] Right.
- So I can see a pro and
a con to both of them.
- The back here, these doors are awesome,
I've seen them on other camper vans,
like, converted vans and
just like, having these open
and you're like parked on a
beach somewhere and you wake up,
'cause this part I would
assume would be the bed area,
and you wake up in bed
and open the doors easily
and your view is the ocean.
I got chills.
That is the life, is it not?
Okay, so let's take it for a drive.
Test drive!
- Oh that's cool.
You've got like, built
in reverse cam here,
into the mirror, that's nice.
- [Kristen] It's good to give these babies
a test drive, right Siya?
- Yeah, it's important to test drive.
The engine is important, whereas like
for our Airstream, we didn't
have to think of the engine
because it was the truck
that was pulling it.
So, you have to consider
that, you're getting a home
and a vehicle in one.
- Hello friends, so we are now off to see
a F-150,
it's a 2007, it is very
much under our budget,
but also we are looking into
maybe like getting a cap,
like an Eagle cap, put it on the back
and it basically becomes a trailer.
And those run anywhere
from, used, like 11 thousand
can go all the way up to like
60 thousand dollars plus, new.
So we're gonna go check that
out and see what it looks like,
how it runs and just give you
a better idea of that option.
(upbeat music)
- All right, this is another
vehicle, this is a 2007 F-150,
and our concept with this
is that this is the vehicle
and then we can add on
one of those truck caps.
- [Kristen] The Eagle caps.
- One of those Eagle caps,
so that you can actually
live in the back part of the pickup.
We drive an F-150, that's
how we tow the Airstream
so we're comfortable with
these type of trucks.
So there's lots of space at the back,
that could be, I guess that would be...
- An extra bed.
- Extra bed, or baby or
dog or whatever you've got.
- If we want to pull something
instead of putting like an Eagle cap,
you should get a truck that
has a tow pack, like this one.
We got the plug here to plug in
and I guess this comes off.
- [Siya] Yeah.
- Yeah this comes off,
and you just put in your hitch.
This is great if you
work like a nine to five,
or maybe you just don't want to live life
on the road full time but
you want to do weekend trips,
especially like when the
weather gets really nice,
then it's a really good option.
Especially with trucks, I mean
you can drive over anything,
you just feel a lot more safer in a truck.
Really in a good condition,
and he just put it up.
I would assume that that's
gonna go really fast
for the price, 'cause
it like, what was it?
Under, it's under 8000
dollars which is really good,
for the year, for the
mileage, for the condition,
there's no rust on it, he's
taken very good care of it,
you can tell he's got
like eight other cars so,
he loves his cars.
That's another option if
you want something to use
on a day-to-day basis as
well as take on camping trips
on the weekends, that's the way to go.
- We're en route to see
a conversion vehicle
that's already been done,
so if you are looking at
a conversion vehicle and you
don't have the skills to,
you know, build and put things together,
then this is you know, the best option.
So we're gonna go see exactly
what work has been done
to this vehicle and you know,
how well it suits our budget,
if anything needs to be done to it.
And it's in Downtown Toronto,
actually close to where we
used to live, when you know,
we still lived in the
city and not on the road.
- If you are looking for a vehicle
that you just wanna get into
and start road tripping right away,
something that's already been converted
is the way to go so that you
don't have to put the time
and energy into converting one yourself.
- This Toronto traffic though,
I hate Toronto traffic!
- [Kristen] You gotta deal with traffic
when you live life on
the road, my brother.
- You do, you do but I hate traffic!
(upbeat music)
- This camper van we're gonna go look at
would be, in my opinion, great for someone
who wants to do this full
time, one or two people,
if you have a dog too that's great,
because there are two seats so,
and it's already put together for you
to live in it right away.
- [Siya] That is not a
good conversion vehicle.
- [Kristen] Is it?
- [Siya] But it's sweet.
- This one doesn't have
a toilet or anything.
- So this is the fridge, looks
like there's a little pin
so that it doesn't accidentally open.
It looks good, I mean it's a small fridge.
- [Kristen] Yeah well it's
- We're used to it but it's
a small you know, small van.
- [Kristen] Yeah, basically
like when you're living in a van
you just shop every few
days couple of days.
- Yeah.
- [Kristen] Right?
And then you can use like
one of these cupboards
this cupboard over here
and this cupboard over here
for like pantry stuff.
- Yeah looks like there's a couple of
electrical outlets here too.
Not bad.
Okay we got a spare tire, this looks like
a brand new spare tire, that's nice.
And I think the exterior looks
like it's in great condition,
like I don't see any rust,
I don't see any dents,
I don't see scratches.
- [Kristen] You're gonna wanna
check underneath as well.
- [Siya] Yeah check underneath for sure.
- [Kristen] And under the hood as well.
- [Siya] The engine is
actually under this like,
center console right here.
So you can be driving,
you can change your oil,
keep driving,
that's very cool.
- The 2016 Ford Transit Passenger Wagon.
That was the one that could be converted.
- Yeah.
- It would need a lot of work,
'cause you have to completely gut it.
- [Siya] Right.
- [Kristen] And then
create your living space.
- [Siya] Yeah, you get
to fully customize it
which is awesome, it's pretty
much like a new vehicle,
- [Kristen] Yeah it's a 2016.
- Yeah, it was
- Mint condition.
- Right, so like the engine
won't have any problems
and it's a Ford, so
like if you are going to
run into problems that there's auto shops
and there's Ford dealers
all over the continent,
which is very handy for
the parts you may need.
- It had low kilometers.
- Yeah.
- Under 40 thousand kilometers
so it obviously has not had the adventure
that is should have.
- Right.
- Not yet.
- It was about 34 grand,
which only leaves us with six grand
for the conversion if we
want to hit our budget.
Six, it's doable, totally totally doable.
- Especially if you have the
skills to do it yourself.
- Right.
- Or you have family or
friends that can help you out
and you want to just make
it like a simple conversion
and be really crafty and handy with it,
then you could definitely
stay under budget,
and it had enough space
for you to stand up
if you are under like 5'9".
- [Siya] Right, right, yeah, yeah.
- You're 5'9" so he was pushing it.
But it was definitely
more room, head space
and also more room than the
already converted vehicle
so you could probably fit
a compost toilet in
there if you wanted to.
- Yeah I'd say so, yeah totally
and you're customizing it
so you can do whatever you want to it.
- Right.
(upbeat music)
- Ford F-150, that
- Okay.
- Was a really good choice
because first of all
it's like, in mint condition.
The guy obviously really loved
vehicles, he had like 10.
(baby noise)
I know.
- And if you were to
put an Eagle cap on it
you could essentially
detach that Eagle cap
and still have a truck.
- Yeah, if you're someone who wants to do
just like weekend road
trips, camping trips,
but you want also a day-to-day vehicle
then it's a really good option.
And the budget was crazy good, 8000 bucks.
Not even 8000 dollars.
- Oh yeah.
- So you could leave a lot
of room for that Eagle cap
if you wanted to attach something
- Tons of room.
- A trailer, of some sort.
- You could get a brand new Eagle cap.
- Yeah, yeah it's a great choice.
(upbeat music)
- All right, the 1996
Mercedes-Benz camper,
it's that one is ready to go basically.
- [Siya] Right.
- [Kristen] It needed
some love definitely but.
- Yeah, it probably needed, what?
Three to five grand,
maybe like seven grand
if you wanted to give it a cool paint job
or if you wanted to do more to it.
- Right.
- And it's still under budget.
- [Kristen] The downside
is it's a foreign car.
- [Siya] Right.
- [Kristen] So finding parts
is gonna be really difficult.
- Like it still does take some work
it's gonna be like a week of work
but that's way less than
doing a whole conversion
that could be months and
months of grueling work, so.
- We know that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah so that's definitely a plus.
It has a cool factor to it.
- [Siya] Yeah.
- [Kristen] Like super
unique and interesting and
- [Siya] Right.
- Yeah, it's got the fun
Instagram-worthy factor to it.
We didn't get to test drive it.
- Right.
- So that was a downside, perhaps,
we don't really know how well it runs,
the guy told us that it runs good,
but we'd wanna test it ourselves
if we decided we really
wanted that vehicle.
- Right, right, definitely
test drive vehicles.
(upbeat music)
We found three great vehicles,
that are great contenders
for conversion, all
within like 30 kilometers
of where we are, and you
found those right away.
Like, you found those
within like, 20 minutes.
- And we were able to see the vehicles.
Find the vehicles on the
same day that we went
and checked them out.
We want to thank Auto Trader
once again for sponsoring
this video and for making the hunt
for the perfect conversion vehicle,
to hit the road with, so much fun.
It was like a treasure hunt.
Now it's up to you, we've
given you three options,
we've outweighed the pros
and the cons for each one
and ultimately the decision is up to you
and what best suits you and your lifestyle
and we hope to see you on the road.
