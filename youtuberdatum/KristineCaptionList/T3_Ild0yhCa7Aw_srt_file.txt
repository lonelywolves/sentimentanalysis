[Music]
i'm kristin sarah and today i'm in
montezuma costa rica and just down this
dirt path is one of the most
magical places i've ever seen in all of
my travels it's katrine's place it's
called green moon
lodge and it is truly an artist's
masterpiece
katrine is an artist and she really put
her her soul and her creation
into this project and i cannot wait to
see it
[Music]
hi nice to meet you welcome nice to meet
you too
i am so excited to be standing in front
of this amazing creation this is
gotta be not if the coolest but
definitely one of the coolest
places i've ever seen thanks that's for
sure
i i just wanted to build something i've
always been fascinated by round
buildings i always enjoyed
i don't know it's just so very different
to just the straight rectangular walls
and everything so
yeah i really wanted to build something
different something where i can also
bring in
some art and then i found out about
aircrete and
it's a really great material it's like a
mix of concrete and
basically detergent foam and you mix it
all together you make your own blocks
and it's very lightweight lightweight
material
but you can form it the way you need it
so it was just perfect for this
a friend of mine he's an architect he
was super curious about it as well so he
educated himself on how to build
something like that
and we got started so this was the first
time for both of you
to make something for everybody in the
team it was a very hands-on project i
was at the construction a lot as well
and in total we had to make 1 200 blocks
um to get all of this together i need to
know more about
the actual design like how you came up
with this as well as the colors
well the the base of it was the dome and
um the idea was first to just build one
dome
and basically try to have everything in
there uh but then i realized that if i
want to separate spaces inside that one
dome
then again i have to build some walls or
so so that's why i said i wanna three
domes
and i'm gonna connect them through the
arches and that's also where my
architect helped out a lot
to um to see how we're gonna do this
best and so that's why one dome
is the center the biggest one um which
is this
here and that's the living room and the
kitchen and then we have one on the side
which is the bathroom and then the other
side is the living room
the the bedroom sorry how long did this
take to create from
the beginning so from the design all the
way to the last day of building yeah
from the really the moment we we started
construction to finish
everything ready to rent it out it was
six months only
and then there was like there were two
months or so before that which were kind
of planning phase and designing and
thinking things through but yeah it went
really fast and well and
i was really happy that it went so quick
i am really excited to go inside and see
just show everyone around so let's just
go yeah i'm excited
through this amazing door by the way i
need first we need to talk about this
door
the the design is based on a painting
that i made about
three four years ago because i was a
queen um
and yeah it's this woman with the wild
green hair
and it's kind of like a jungle lady and
flowers and leaves
and um yeah i kind of wanted that at the
entrance as the entrance store so i made
like a basic version of it just black
and white
uh made it on paper and then i have a
friend of mine he's an artist
and he's working with iron and yeah he's
making gates and
um and he made this for me which still
amazes me how he managed to get like
from a sheet of paper that was that big
and
basically just a sketch how he managed
to make this
amazing iron door out of it are you are
you happy with that i'm super happy yeah
it's beautiful yeah he did such a great
job and he also
um the all the windows inside the round
windows
um it's also his work and yeah it's it's
really great what he did i really love
in the morning um
or whenever the sun is peering through
like you can see the patterns on the
ground
yeah sometimes even at night when the
moonlight
is shining when you have full moon and
you see the moonlight and you have the
patterns inside it's really nice yeah
it's amazing it adds a lot obviously to
the building yeah
absolutely well i am excited to go
inside okay let's go
yeah please this is just
like i feel like i'm in another world
yeah
it's like a fairytale to me and i also
kind of feel like i'm underground
yeah as i feel a little bit because it's
the round structure
and you feel like you're a little bit in
the cave and also it's you most of the
time it's really nice and cool in here
so i guess that adds to that feeling as
well yeah the first
thing that attracted me as soon as i
walked in is the artwork
yes specifically in the bedroom but even
on the doors
and on the shower and i'd love to learn
more about that
yeah this is one of my favorite pieces
of artwork here this is
um a friend of mine manuel made it he's
a local artist
and yeah i think i gave him like a rough
idea of what i wanted and he
he came up with that within not even two
days
and yeah i i just love the whole um the
feeling it gives the bedroom and the
whole dome house really in general
and then the rest of the artwork is um
so for the window frames and the door i
made the designs and then a friend of
mine he
he made the metalwork and and the rest
is
um stencils like on the ground and
also in the bathroom basically
everything is mine except for the
for the couple kissing above the bed and
and also this
this was part of that as well but then
the rest is mine
yeah when guests walk in here what's the
first thing they say or
the first look they have on their face
um most people i think they're just
looking up first to
to take in the whole um yeah how how the
room feels and yeah definitely the the
artwork above the bedroom
is one of the things most people are
very impressed with and then also the
the main entrance gate
the door does this place attract certain
people
i guess more yeah creative people as
well
i have a lot of couples but also single
people who
just want to take a time out and and
some quiet
and sometimes there they used a place to
create something i had musicians here
who really liked the acoustics like if
you're in the center of the dome
you have very interesting acoustics and
the sound travels
um around you um yeah so i guess
yeah a little bit creative artist people
but
but in general really um it's a wide
range of people i've
i've had i like to go to the bathroom
yeah because
everywhere here has its own like little
special place so
so this room as you probably noticed
most of the house is green
um inside and outside but the bathroom i
wanted to make it more in blue
colors um yeah related to water and
everything
and also the rest of the the other two
domes they have the really big windows
but here i have the little ones so also
that you have a little bit more privacy
inside
um but still have good ventilation yeah
also the windows i put
like elements of water and flow
[Music]
well actually the first time i came to
costa rica i came directly to montezuma
and it was to teach english and to
volunteer
and yeah i don't know i i just arrived
here in montezuma and i've really
traveled a lot
but yeah this place it just felt so
special to me from the
first day i got here and yeah after a
little while i bought property here
and yeah then i still lived back home in
austria and then actually moved to
france for a little bit and i worked
there for some years
and and then at some point the moment
arrived where i'm like okay
i need to go to costa rica i need to do
something with my land
and yeah i built my house and then after
a little bit then
this dome house well i guess becoming an
airbnb host
it it has really opened up a little bit
my
um well it's it's a little town that i
live in here so it's very nice to always
be welcoming people from all parts of
the world
and i have a lot of people from the
united states but really i've had people
from everywhere
and so it's it's very nice for me to be
able to
to welcome guests from everywhere and
also to
share my love for montezuma and for this
place with them
and yeah it's it's really great for me
every time i have guests here as well
financially it really helps me to have
like
um it's it's my main income and it it
helps me to
be able to work on other projects that i
really
love for example i'm making natural soap
from coconut oil and with essential oils
and i'm selling them at the local
markets and some of the hotels around
here use them
and i have them in little shops so
that's something i really enjoy doing
and um yeah i'm also
more and more um i have more time for
painting
which is something i did only like a
little bit before i moved to costa rica
but since
i got here i have more time and i guess
also more inspiration
because yeah if you work an office job
or so it doesn't really
it's not very inspiring sometimes and
and here i feel like
there's so much inspiration from all
parts and
i've been painting a lot and i think
it's really great to be able to do that
and to have more
to have that possibility to focus on
that as well
this building with everything finishing
like really with the furniture and the
kitchen equipped and all of it cost me
around forty thousand dollars
so it's it's not like super cheap but
it's also still
affordable and yeah if
i think it's great to be able to create
a very unique space with that amount of
money
i guess i chose airbnb because it's
first the one i'm most familiar with
because i've traveled a lot and i've
also used airbnb and
most of the time it's really a great
experience and you get to
see really incredible places and also i
like the way the platform is set up it's
like that they
process the payment easily i don't have
to
collect the payment when people get here
and the payouts
are easy made and and then also kind of
the
the safety you get on both sides you
have the reviews
um and um i can also rate the guests
which is important i think
monkeys are passing by almost every day
both the halo monkeys but also the white
faced monkeys
the hollow monkeys most of the time you
hear them in the morning they're always
around like around 5
00 5 30 or so when the sun rises and
yeah they're loud
but i it's just one of the things i love
about living here that
you get woken up for wildlife that's
something very special
and and then i guess that combined with
the beautiful nature that you have the
rivers
the waterfalls and obviously beaches
wherever you look so that's that's a
great combination
for me i love like hiking in the rivers
for example
and just exploring and finding
waterfalls
is actually one austrian artist that i
really love his name is hundadvasa
and he built some he's in like a painter
but he also worked as an architect and
he built some incredible
structures in austria and surrounding
countries where you don't have
any not even the floor is straight
everything is curvy
like there is a church that bends a
little bit like this there are spas that
he built where everything is just
flowing wavy and he also uses like a lot
of intense colors
so that for sure that that inspired me
as well
montezuma is like a little beach surf
town
but it's it's very hippie and there are
a lot of artisanals living here
and for me it's very special that um
it kind of draws people also who are who
are very creative who are very inspiring
so it's just it's it's a very welcoming
atmosphere so even if you travel by
yourself and you
you go to town you're gonna meet
somebody and you're gonna chat with some
people
and a lot of people they come and um
they don't want to leave again
because yeah
[Music]
thank you so much for for sharing your
magical place with us and i'm really
excited that i get to spend a couple of
nights here
yeah i'm excited for you to stay here
yeah i hope you're gonna enjoy it i
think we will yeah yeah thank you so
much thanks for coming yeah thank you
this unique airbnb has given katrine the
money as well as the time to focus on
her
art as well as other creative projects
and what artists wouldn't want that
