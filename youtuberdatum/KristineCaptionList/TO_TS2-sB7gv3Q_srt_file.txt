whoo we're feeling a little anxious this
is our first time okay I'm lying she's
feeling anxious I'm I'm pretty chilled I
think everything's gonna be fine but we
are traveling with our four month-old
baby
she's never traveled before and we've
never done this before
we're big time travelers but traveling
with a baby is new to us so we're gonna
take you through this experience
firsthand what it's like traveling with
a baby from Toronto to London it's like
a seven-hour flight and we're going to
show you every step and problem and
highlight along the way
[Music]
[Music]
family check-in if you have never done
this before
family checking
what prep work did you have to do before
going near the airport
just packing ahead of time basically
starting like a week before just to make
sure I had everything and didn't feel
stress today up and checking out other
blogs people who have traveled with
their kids seeing what they fried and
what they didn't need so this is gonna
come with us until we you could check
the stroller and car seat now but we
want to have it to the gate because you
can bring it right to the gate and it's
free so you have like three two hundred
three things you can bring our car seat
stroller and playpen so you can choose
two of those but the stroller has to
fold so we're choosing to put on the
stroller on the plane so we can take it
through the airport yeah we're gonna
check it when we get to the gate got it
so right now we're going to check this
bag in that bag okay so we just checked
in our big suitcase with both of our
clothes and our smaller suitcase with
all of caius stuff with our daughter
stuff
I don't know why people would check
their stroller because it was super easy
to just walk through the security like
took us what five minutes tops
yeah so I took kayo and I held her walk
through and then see you went through
with the stroller kind of wall behind
the stroller so this shoulder went
through by itself you can see it
followed in the x-ray in the metal
detector right and then they just patted
it down right yeah it was super easy
super simple and because we're family
and American Express card holders we got
to
yeah it wasn't busy about but if it was
and she actually doesn't have a ticket
I was checking because she's under two
years old in your office she's gonna be
on your lap on my lap she's gonna be on
her lap then she has a bassinet but
we'll talk more about that when we get
on the plane
[Music]
if it is 70 you
all these lathe sounds
[Music]
usually we would take the escalator down
now
we take the elevator
[Music]
we booked our ticket and included under
two years old so that means that she
could fly for free yeah but it was that
simple I think it costs another like it
was like $60 and you I'm talking so much
you like quiet feed me woman it was just
like some airlines charge a little bit
some airlines won't charge anything at
all but it's pretty much just taxes for
her though we had to pack
now leaving the lounge we're there for
like about an hour it was really nice
Kristin breastfed she changed chi how
was the changing situation it was
actually the person I change in a public
space I just we brought doggie pee pads
just laid one down over the plastic you
know change table thing yeah that kept
it sanitary yeah and that way if that
gets dirty you can just like wrap that
up and throw it in the garbage which is
really nice keep it sanitary how you
doing guy you don't okay we're now at
our gate we're about to board our flight
was delayed about an hour which kind of
sucked but luckily we were at the lounge
so it didn't really matter Chi is passed
out right now but we will have to wake
her up for takeoff and we'll see how
this goes well we have never done this
before boarding when they say children
and families
why between the show where the for
mental oh now she'll be been brave enjoy
it thank you keep saying that you're
brave you're brave it's like I'm I am
dying am I missing something
is it really that difficult I guess
we'll find out but really well the
person may be nervous yeah cuz you
weren't nervous before that nervous I
don't even know why to be honest I guess
her ears I'm gonna notice of every year
[Music]
hey we're on the plane now baby's first
flight and she's getting sleepy
which is good so we have front-row seats
which means we have more legroom and we
ordered a bassinet ahead of time for
airline which is also free for infants
under - I'm gonna breastfeed on the way
up to help her with her ears so these
are the seats that we got so Kristin was
upgraded to be here because she's with
the baby and then I assume that they're
going to put a bassinet here on the wall
so that guy can go to sleep and then I
had to pay to upgrade to sit next to her
we brought some disinfectant wipes so
I'm just gonna wipe down positions so
the I'm gonna breastfeed er okay so just
hold ahead in the back just in case take
something out
you know won't make a head
backward yeah safety seat belt on you
not on the baby
yep if dumbass drops you're gonna put
your maths person after owner right okay
we're gonna bring the bus in it once a
year
okay if the CPM come on you're gonna
have told the baby don't think the baby
in the basket
any questions nope should my life for
like what two hours two and a half hours
now not fun with a baby but she's like
so good thank goodness I think this is
her fussy because I'm waiting to feed
her cuz I don't want to feed her and
then she doesn't pick my boob for
takeoff cuz we're just sitting
waiting
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
okay so we're halfway through a flight
to London between India for like three
three and a half hours
Kyah was asleep like before takeoff so
she's been asleep the entire time this
is the change table and so it just comes
down it looks like it's supported over
here and in that side of the wall so
that's not the wall this is strong and
it looks pretty clean up ever going to
use this we haven't used it on the plane
we haven't changed there yet but we
probably won't change here before she
goes back
and this looks like a clean surface even
though we won't put like a peep hat down
so that it's a nice perfectly clean
sanitary service so far so good
every time I would get up back in
Toronto to pump because Isaac
really well for my books
they need to release
there is nowhere to plug in the puppet
the washrooms
so I had to
fiddle around with my pumps
drape a towel over me
but I don't really care do it
success Lippman now I'm going to go and
see
their fridge or get some ice
usually it's good at room temperature
for a couple hours I would see if I can
make a lots even longer
[Music]
she didn't even feed when we went up
word went down roller and our car seat
it's a good thing we got these cases for
our stroller and car seat because they
are wet but the car seat in the stroller
are not because they're productive yeah
you can see like this is water here cuz
we're in London and it's raining but on
the inside perfectly dry it rains rains
it rains in London
[Music]
