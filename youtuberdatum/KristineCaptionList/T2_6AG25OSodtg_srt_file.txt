we're currently on the twin bridges
trail and it overlooks this beautiful
river
we're surrounded by spectacular autumn
leaves
this is one of my favorite times to be
outside to be in
parks around canada just because of the
seasons we're so lucky to have seasons
here that we can
see the changing leaves like everywhere
you look is just
just spectacular colors all over the
place as
the forest prepares for winter we're on
a two hour hike right now
baby is asleep in the back
and hopefully she stays asleep and
doesn't want to run around halfway
through
this air is so fresh the perfect type of
air to have
amazing peaceful sleep she's gonna have
the best nap right now especially
listening to the water
like this is a natural sound machine
just look at these colors like this it's
green
yellow red orange brown
and like all of these are the same
plants like it's the same
type of tree it's like a walking rainbow
you know like skittles commercials where
like
everything is skittles that's what
autumn is like
taste the rainbow with everything that's
going on in the world i feel like we
could all use a little bit of therapy
and the best therapy
is nature just getting outside and
immersing yourself
in nature it always makes me feel
so good and with someone who suffers
from anxiety
yeah this one over here just being in
nature
for half an hour an hour i just feel
so much more calm relaxed recharged
my brain just feels you know not
scattered with crazy thoughts
just kind of comes back you know and i
feel more present
and i feel happy so if you're feeling
anxious if you're feeling worried if
you're feeling like
just overwhelmed just get out in nature
it's the best medicine
