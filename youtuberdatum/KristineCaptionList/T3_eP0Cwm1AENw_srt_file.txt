if you've been following along this
series you know that we just bought a
slice of the jungle in beautiful costa
rica
in an up-and-coming community while our
community is being built
we're staying in a neighboring community
learning the ins and outs of community
living we want to learn about all the
positive and the negative sides about
community living
so we can apply those skills and
knowledge to our new community
i'm very interested to see in this video
we want to dive into how this community
gets and grows its food i'm standing in
the communal garden
you might recognize this place from a
netflix series called down to earth
we're going to meet some top eco
innovators this is the community fart
bank this is the community
burns like the olympic torch yeah down
to earth
good morning from la icovia in
san mateo costa rica we're going to be
moving
very close to here to a new community
but for the next month we're going to be
living here and we're going to be
exploring this community
and seeing how things run seeing how
daily life is seeing how the kids play
i'm seeing how the houses are built
because we see a
big variety of houses and essentially
seeing how
people live
oh hello welcome welcome welcome to the
place you've been in the last
over two weeks now and it's been
wonderful
it feels really comfortable here the bed
is amazing which really adds to the
comfort
and uh it has everything we need it's
beautiful
lots of windows and balconies freshly
cut papaya
banana we got bee pollen and some
granola
doing a little muesli action i love that
we're just surrounded
by beautiful greenery everywhere
there's a gardener attending to the lawn
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
good morning buen dia from costa rica
it's lush it's beautiful the sound of
the
the birds i heard two cans this morning
the river you can hear it running around
me right now
and the smell of the air is sweet
we are staying in place called la ikovia
it
is just about a 45-minute drive from
san jose the capital and it's a
community and intentional community
and we're staying here we've been here
before
it's nice to be back and just soak it
all in
[Music]
so
[Music]
this little adventure
definitely like her mom and dad you can
do it
yeah you can do it you can do it okay
i'm here i'm here you can do it
i'm right here no you want to climb kai
you're gonna have to climb
come
on i got you okay okay now climb this
way look
climb that way okay so step here
i'm standing in the communal garden so
there's a lot of greens especially that
are planted here and grown here
and then all of it is dispersed amongst
the community
every week they get a like a basket
delivered to the door
uh or they come down and pick it up but
everyone gets a basket of produce which
is amazing and then everyone has
fruit on their on their property as well
as all in the communal areas there's
fruit that people can just come
and grab and eat indulge in oh
it's the dream so it looks like all
these are lot numbers of all the
different houses
baskets get filled every single week
they can come and get
all their fresh produce and today's
vegetables are
bok choy lettuce and green onion is that
say swiss chard i don't know
maybe but it looks like it looks
pretty scrumptious
since we're staying in lakovia for a
little bit of time
we get a basket of the produce that's
been growing
in the community garden so it was
dropped off at our door
doorstep today and we got carrots and
radish and bananas and kale and
some other types of lettuce some many
types of lettuce
and plantain it's beautiful all organic
grown right here and all of the
neighbors get some
so this is really special in this
community there's an hoa feed which is
a homeowners association fee so that
goes towards
road maintenance and that goes towards
the garden
that you know you get your produce from
so it's just like a condo fee
so rather than the condo fees playing
paying for you know windows to be
washed and air conditioners to be fixed
it's going
partly towards your food which i think
is pretty phenomenal
fresh local super super local like
a hundred feet away organic organic food
grown from the land that gets delivered
to your door
spicy radish that is spicy
but good it's spicy tastes fresh
fresh and i like picked today or
yesterday
amazing amazing amazing to like walk the
gardens
and then to eat that food that prana a
good energy
whoa that's spicy
give you guys a look of our compost bin
we got coconut
here there's watermelon there's orange
peels and papaya peels and
oh it's so good there's something so
satisfying
about eating food that was grown
so close to where you live
and i think the food knows it too you
feed it good energy
and love and respect in turn it's gonna
give you more love and respect and
energy
the community garden in ecovia doesn't
supply everyone with
all the produce they need extra rice
beans
grains breads any meats or fish that
people
eat has to be purchased outside or they
have delivery services
there's a service here that you can get
there's a lady who goes into san jose
every wednesday and she'll get you
organic produce and other groceries and
deliver it right to your door here in la
igoria
cilantro
coconut oil which is rice
fresh oregano oh my god
it smells heavenly what a service you're
getting organic groceries delivered
right to your door
and it just feels a little different
than back home i just feel like this is
more connected to the land because
everything's probably for the most part
it's local
um and in canada it's from kind of all
over the place
especially the stuff you want like the
exotic stuff
so we're gonna definitely be using the
service when we move here permanently
we're just admiring the jackfruit tree
there's so many
the tree is just off the main road and
it's planted that way
so that you know people who live in this
community can
forage their own food as they're walking
around
it makes sense and like there are birds
and squirrels and i'm sure bugs that are
just devouring these things because they
know it's good it was balanced
yeah there's a couple that fall on the
ground i wonder if those are better to
grab if
they're not eaten already you can smell
it
there's so many it's just saying
anything about like
how you know yeah so the more brown they
are the
sweeter they're going to be look they're
even falling on the ground
if you want to use them like a
vegetarian dish i always loved climbing
trees and now i got to climb trees and
eat
what's dad doing kai is he climbing the
tree like a monkey
yeah wow yeah that's amazing
how heavy does it feel like uh it's got
to be
40 pounds wow i would say like this is
wow there's your workout i don't want it
to just
break but i guess
it will unless it's really soft
okay
this is my favorite fruit in the entire
world if you have never tried it before
it tastes i think like a mango and a
peach combined which is heavenly
if you've tried juicy fruit gum that is
what a jackfruit tastes like it's pretty
pretty accurate
jf jf oh yeah juicy
fruit jack fruit they can get
humongous like you might think this is
big but this is really
nothing compared to how big they
actually can get
hola amigos today is the day we pack up
we've been here for two weeks in this
place and
we're headed to a new location and then
we're going somewhere
very fun
oh you got ice that's
fun
put it in your hand and do you drink it
no no you can drink it
[Applause]
with water yeah you can drink water
we're gonna be spending a month here
in january and that's so that we can
explore our land a little more
we're talking to some architects and
designers and make a plan
for our design and actually building our
house and our timeline and
our dream for our houses is a little
scattered we have ideas that we want for
it
but we need someone to put all these
scattered ideas together
okay we are packed up ready to go
ready to hit the road there are
jackfruits
that we harvested yesterday so we just
have them in the sun they need to sit
there for like three to five days and
then we can
cut into them and extract all the juicy
goodness
[Music]
we've learned so much from staying in
ecovia and we have a lot more to share
with you guys
but for right now we're headed to punta
mona which is on the caribbean side
of the country and home of the largest
private collection
of plants on the planet
you
