our renovations are complete and we're
living in luna again and this time we're
gonna be exploring
more of our own backyard more of canada
we grew up in this province of ontario
and
it's so beautiful it's full of lakes and
forests
and beautiful woodland creatures there's
places that we've never seen before
and that's what you're going to see in
this video
[Music]
welcome to little current
well their motto is keep it current keep
a little
i don't know if that's their motto
welcome to the big city
at the corner of manitowining and
vancouvernet
we really came here with very little
plan
we basically planned where we were going
to stay with the exception of one night
i have no idea where we're going to stay
somewhere on a beach
and just took people's recommendations
when we got here
and started looking at photos and
people tagging locations and then going
there
and basically letting
you guys control where we eat and where
we go
i miss traveling like that i miss just
landing somewhere
without a plan and just going with it
i can see that a lot of these shops are
closed
and this is like the biggest little town
here
on the island little current most
probably couldn't support themselves
through kovid and either had to close
permanently or just
temporarily closed it's a little sad but
things are opening up we did see one
place open
called the anchor inn and hotel motel
hotel anchor in hotel and they have a
restaurant here
so a lot of people sitting outside so we
thought we'd sit and
order something
not gonna lie it feels a little strange
to be on a patio again
we've been like cooped up for the past
like five six months
you want
now we have been eating mainly
plant-based for like
at least me for the past year kristen
for much longer
but when i'm by the lake or the sea
the ocean i like to eat some seafood and
this is
cajun trout caught right here
made right in-house the water's right
behind you
yeah when i can like see the water
that's when i know the seafood's going
to be good
you can't just eat sauce my love here
want some of this
cauliflower
you just want dip
just hurt myself pretty bad um
i was getting our bikes ready for a bike
ride
and i was making sure that the tire was
on right
and my finger got caught in the spokes
and it like
tore off the whole top layer of my
middle finger
it uh hurts pretty bad i think my body's
a little bit in shock
because it like there's you have the
most nerve endings
on your fingertips and i think a lot of
them were hurt and
i almost feel like i'm gonna vomit even
though it's such a tiny
wound thankfully we have like a
massive first aid kit this is part of
life on the road
like you're gonna get hurt and you have
to be able to treat it yourself
[Music]
how did that hurt that hurt a lot
alright
i bandaged my finger up from previous
bike
accident let that heal for a few days
and hopefully it'll be better
but right now we're gonna cook dinner
and i have
waited months to open this up well i
kind of i kind of opened it up to take a
peek but
it's been on our shelf and been waiting
for
when we're out and camping on the road
and tonight we're going to barbecue up
some
some vegan sausages this is a biolite
camp stove and it basically takes like
twigs and branches and stuff from nature
you throw it in the stove
and you can cook your food with it but
it also charges a battery
using the fire the heat from the fire
charges a battery and you can charge
your devices charge your phone charge
all this stuff
this is not a sponsored video by biolite
i reached out to them because
i bought their product like five years
ago and i loved it so much that
recently i reached out and said hey your
products are awesome
i love your brand i love what you guys
do and it very much
suits our lifestyle and i want to be an
ambassador for you guys
so they sent me this they also sent me
this like headlamp that
recharges through usb so you can use
fire to recharge this
headlamp and this has come in handy
several times like walking around the
airstream at night and doing stuff
oh thank you baby i appreciate it open
your marker
yeah now you just draw in your book okay
you don't draw on anything else
sometimes when we were camping we'd run
out of gas we'd run out of propane and
like we couldn't cook dinner and it
would be a big drag
this product solves that problem this is
where you put your firewood
your twigs your pinecones this is the
battery
and it also has a fan at the back that
keeps your fire
blowing hot and usb port at the bottom
to charge your devices
camp stove
this is exactly like the one i have
this is a canister to rocket heat
your water this thing right here is what
gets hot and actually charges the
battery that's it this is
basically your stove but this is what
i'm going to use it for today
it's a little stove top like this boom
so you
open the lid throw in your sticks get it
going
and cook food super fast
[Music]
so we're going to turn sticks into
electricity
while cooking our food i have a lighter
so i could get this going pretty fast
but i i feel
more like nature inspired so we're gonna
actually use
this concave mirror and sunlight
to start the fire this is a totally
separate product this does not come with
that i bought this
online because i thought it was cool and
i haven't used it that much so
i want to use it now that was fast wanna
tell them what's happening that was
almost
instant so it's it's using the sunlight
to
act like almost uh like you would with a
magnifying glass
but to focus that light into the center
and then hopefully we'll get a little
flame here
[Music]
looking good does anyone else get as
excited as i do about
cool products like this cool inventions
and ideas
the flame is charging the battery and
then the battery
is powering the fan that's keeping the
fire going
in a cycle bon appetit
enjoy it colorful beautiful meal
yeah vegan sausage you have some
nachos when mom made a dip what's in
this dip
uh cashews nutritional yeast some
paprika
vegetable broth that's it amazing it's
delicious thank you
it tastes very like cheesy nutritional
yeast baby
how do they taste on that barbecue it's
actually tastes really good and
i know it's a huge difference compared
to like barbecue we have at home
yeah because that's like gas that's
propane right versus really good
mm-hmm oh my god that's good okay
good morning from manitoulin island
how are your pancakes it's good
[Music]
[Music]
can you see the horses
kai what do you see
you see horsey are you excited
yeah this is a big first experience to
merge with an animal and ride together
is like avatar
[Music]
we want to support and feed pai's
passions and interests
and right now she is really passionate
about animals and specifically horses
she just gets so excited whenever she
sees one when we're driving
hold on you gotta hold on kaikai
hold on yeah you have to hold her
and what we have really noticed on this
trip specifically
is that we are doing things for kai
we are doing activities that we might
not have thought of
if it was just the two of us or us alone
we're doing things
that we think she'll be interested in
and it
brings us a whole other level of
excitement
we're getting to also do things again
for the first
time it feels new to us to
relive and experience through our
daughter's eyes
[Music]
[Applause]
who's more excited
my mom used to tell me and my sisters
stories of her back in iran
riding donkeys and i'm also stepping on
donkey poo during the story so this
feels like an appropriate setting
donkeys don't like to be ridden and
they're smarter than you think so what
they do
or what they did when my mom was riding
them on the mountainside
was they would walk right on the edge
like all four hooves were touching the
edge
of the cliff and you would be afraid you
didn't want to fall so you'd
get off the donkey and they would do
this over and over again
just so that the person riding would get
off
i like donkeys they get what they want
one stop we didn't want to miss on
manitoulin island was bridal veil
falls and it did not disappoint our
adventures in luna are just getting
started and we can't wait
to share more of these experiences with
you but we don't want to just share our
travel experiences with you we want to
teach you how you can live this
lifestyle too
it is accessible to everyone and it has
given us so much freedom
so much passion such a connection with
nature we absolutely
love it if this is part of your dream
you can make it happen and we want to
help you get there
you
