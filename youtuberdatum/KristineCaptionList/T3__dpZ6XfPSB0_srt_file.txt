[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
big day today we are going to see our
lot
so the little piece of land that we
purchased here in costa rica
we're gonna go walk the land and explore
and see what trees are there and
make a vision for our dream home
[Music]
so
[Music]
today we are taking a tour of the future
community we're going to be living
in now it's still going to take you know
at least
a year or two until everyone's here and
people are moved in and they have their
houses and everything
today we're going to scope out our land
get a feel for the size of it i know
it's like
about half an acre which isn't massive
but
we're on 180 acres of the community so
where our land is
is just where our house is going to be
but there's going to be other gardens
there's going to be fruit trees
there's going to be places to hang out
and mingle with everyone
a workstation there'll be a pool
there'll be a hot tub there'll be like
community living areas there's a lot of
construction going on building the roads
and the communal spaces
things are happening it's really
exciting especially to be here
during it to see the process because we
were here before
any of this started and now we're here
during the construction
and then we'll get to see our house
being built
this area that i'm standing on and in
front of
is going to be a communal spot called
the hive so there's going to be
a lap pool which is awesome and
there's going to be like a kitchen work
spaces just places to
lounge and enjoy life yeah this is where
everyone's gonna like hang out and get
together
so here at the hive is where we're gonna
have our big industrial kitchen for the
whole community to gather and share and
cook together
we're gonna have a children's pool as
well as a jacuzzi
and we saved the best part of the whole
land to share as a community with the
most amazing views
welcome every time i come here and i
feel
the purity of the land and the amazing
just like really good
vibration of the land i feel at home
and i just can't wait until we're all
here it's so nice to just walk the land
in its untouched form and just to see it
all unfold and what we create together
and how we paint the canvas together and
it's just so beautiful to be a part of
it
before anyone ever gets here and see
just like the beautiful creation that we
all make together and that we were all
called from
all over the world from all over the
globe to come here and create this space
together and how
incredible it would be to see it
finished and ever evolving and then
leaving it to the kids like
kai who will one day take over the
community they're the futures of alegria
and i just think it's so beautiful to
see how
it'll grow and expand over the years
that's so exciting
today we're going to get a vision for
our dream house
on our land this is like a bigger deal
than like i think i've actually
thought about we're building our dream
home designing it from scratch
getting rid of like earth and rock and
starting to build a foundation and and
creating a space for
us and kai and our family to come visit
and our friends that are watching this
video that know that they're gonna come
visit
uh it's it's just a special day
standing along some papaya trees on our
land this is like communal
papaya trees and i just found out too
that we have three miles of road in our
community and along the road is just
gonna be filled with food for us
so just pump in out all the fruit and
i can't all the fruit
i can't all the fruit that we can
imagine
and it's like as organic as possible
like you can't get any more organic than
that
oh my god oh heaven
[Music]
walking our land right now with jai
it's a lot bigger than than i thought
and there's a lot of bush to clear
whew
wow
hello rock you're mine
wow yeah okay so this is the edge
of our lot and there's a little walking
trail
and then our friends are staying on the
other side
wow oh going all the way
up here you just get more expansive and
even better views
even this is jungle bush so this will be
removed and
people will plant fruit trees and sort
of really get into their
landscaping and pretty phenomenal
so you would probably like building
looking this way but then there's that
view over there too
so put your house up there and you'll
have that's true 200 degree view
so that's the edge of our property so it
goes all the way up here
and then all the way up this main road
standing on our land and incredible to
be like at this point
it's hard to process it all i mean it's
gonna take time it's just so
it feels so incredible and to manifest
something to really want something and
then to actually
see it come to life it's yeah wow what a
journey
oh and this is our land they're dirt
it's beautiful dirt too and the views
oh my god and the fact that we're on a
hill
is amazing because we can build right at
the top of it as as high as we are
able to and just be able to get these
crazy views of the mountains
and there's the highest mountain peak in
costa rica
i gotta get that right
so our land starts here and goes
all the way there's sian kai all
the way down to that pole here and like
back
oh the possibilities are endless
[Music]
we're walking our lot right now and
getting a vision for what we want
in our house right now there's there's a
lot of earth and rock and
rubble but that'll all be cleared and
flat and that's really cool to see it
this way and to just imagine
and to get it and to really document
what it looks like now and what it's
gonna look like
[Music]
i give you credit because a lot of
people would see this and be like super
scared because it's a little scary
a little messy right now the mayhem
before the beauty yeah
huh so many boulders so many boulders
yeah
there's a huge beautiful rock right here
i mean the house might already be here
yeah
would you have any do you have thoughts
to placement of the house it's hard we
want it changed so much
yeah yeah it'll start around here
that's what i'm guessing i want to
utilize this rock somehow
it's really flat really nice right now
it's just a jungle in here
but we're going to be clearing what we
can
and then rebuilding from scratch
planting
you know plants that we want fruit trees
that we want
produce that we want and
that way we customize our land we've we
customize our lives
you know every step we can
oh yeah oh yeah in a few days we're
gonna get this lot cleared
so that we can see more of the land and
that'll help us uh determine what we
want to do with it
but we got the expert here we got
stephen
i mean the reality is this view is
really effort
so our lot is about 2 000 square meters
half an acre exactly half an acre yeah
okay
yeah so that's that's plenty of plenty
of land to play with and have fun with
and
create some open space for us to be
outside
maybe a fire pit and then enough space
indoors to have like you know four
bedrooms and four washrooms and enough
for
all my family to come visit all
kristen's family to have friends that
live in the area come visit
yeah amazing awesome amazing all right i
think we'll go this way
yeah so you would clear you'd clear
everything
except for those like the big trees at
the front the back end
the back edge oh cause that's privacy
you know and this is just gonna all get
clean and yeah i mean look
like up there is even better this is
your view
oh it's spectacular yeah i think that's
i think this is the way we want to
orient the home
yep less than that way more like this
way like up there facing out this way
and that's facing sunrise that's facing
sunrise
[Applause]
teresa and okay we bought a piece of the
jungle
that was amazing it's good it's it's a
big jungle
yeah but uh we're gonna clear it all
we're gonna try and get it cleared in a
few days
and then we'll have a better idea of
what we want to do with it
and steven was saying to make our
driveway from
the side road right so coming from that
one they just kind of go in
yeah because our lot our lot goes from
all the way up here guys and then
it goes all the way down this road in
like a triangle shape kind of
so this is like the point of the
triangle goes up and down
and then goes back like a hundred feet
and across
so it's a huge huge lot
so we're gonna make the driveway
entrance from this direction
i don't think we would lose much of the
view because we're also building up
so even here at ground level like it's
spectacular
views like you guys see behind me but
our house is going to be
two levels right so you'll be able to
see a lot more
yeah wow it's happening
guys happy just playing in the dirt
[Music]
the water here is beautiful hello
everyone and welcome to punta mona
i've never heard about this fruit which
i still don't know the name of
spent the last hour and a half driving
through san jose it is
massive this has been where we've been
sleeping and
where we call home right now
each day we've had a itinerary
