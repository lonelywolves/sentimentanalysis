[Music]
[Music]
after a stunning four hour drive
we have made it to pancake bay
provincial park this is where we'll be
spending the next three nights
and it's raining but it's so beautiful
i just want to go out and explore i
don't care about the rain who can't put
the rain anyways it's just water
surprise come on
we were filling up um our tank because
the place that we're staying at right
now they don't have water um like on
site so you have to fill up ahead of
time
and our truck isn't starting
so we're like stuck
maybe i spoke too soon well i didn't
speak too soon it actually wasn't
starting but
someone helped us give us a boost and it
finally
looks like it's finally running oh my
god so
i guess we're not going to be stuck by
the water fill up
it started oh my god yeah
thank you i appreciate it
thank you we've been dealing with a lot
lately and just like
we're recently saying today like we just
need a break and then this happened and
then
have a good day i guess
the universe was like just kidding
here's a break
i've spent a lot of time this year
around forests and surrounded by trees
i read a book called the secret life of
trees
and oh i listened to it on audiobooks
and it was
fascinating to learn about how
the forest communicates there's a lot of
chatter
amongst the forest most of the
communication with trees happens in
their roots
it's pretty fascinating so i have a
deeper love and understanding of the
[Music]
forest
[Music]
so

oranges and reds and browns and greens
and yellows
and then we're surrounded by lakes on
both sides
and just a beautiful bedrock
canada is really really pretty guys if
you haven't been here if you have a road
trip you got a road trip across canada
you got it and it's not just all about
the west coast it's the east coast
it's ontario it's all of it but people
tend to skip out on other parts of
ontario they just like go toronto ottawa
and don't go on the outskirts you know
the wild
wild parts of ontario and it is so
special and very unique especially
in autumn well we made it to lake
superior provincial park

so
[Music]
people think that when it rains the day
is over the day is wasted
because they can't go outside it doesn't
get wet but it's just water
you like showers don't you at least i
hope so
but it's so nice and there's something
so peaceful
about hiking in the rain or hiking right
after it rained
everything is so lash and bright
and the air smells heavenly really
oh
this is for horse bathing at its finest
if you don't know what forest feeding is
look it up because
it's an incredible medicine
[Music]
so
[Music]
oh my god it's so pretty
you just saw me do um a anxiety release
technique that i
kind of came up with where i breathe in
all the relaxation the goodness and i
exhale all the anxiety and worries that
i have into nature
and it absorbs it and turns it into
positive energy it's
really effective
[Music]
waterfalls and rapids aerate the river
by mixing oxygen from the air
into the water
trout and oxygen demanding fish thrive
in the well-aerated pools below
the rapids the ojibwa fished in similar
pools using
basket-type dip net on a long pole
today anglers are attracted to the same
pools where the ojibwa
precariously dipped for tripped
[Music]
