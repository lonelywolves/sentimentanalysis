- This video is for you, because you're
the future generation,
we've gotta protect you.
Make sure you have a good future, right?

Over the last couple
of years specifically,
there's been this new wave
of eco-conscious living,
also known as the Zero Waste revolution,
which I think is absolutely fantastic
because it means people
are waking up and realizing
that what they do matters and they have
an impact on this earth
now, at this present moment,
and for our future generations.
There's so much waste
all around the world.
By making small changes in our lives
we can make a huge difference in this.
We can encourage and inspire
others to do the same.
Let's talk about the title Zero Waste.
First of all, I don't
think it's realistic,
I think it's intimidating
for people to feel like
they have to eliminate all
waste out of their lives.
I understand it and I
totally think it's inspiring
for those who are actually
doing it, but for most people
I find they think it's intimidating
and they don't even want
to try because of it.
I think its more important
to just start little.
Start with one small change
that you can make in your life today
to reduce the amount of
waste you are making,
and eventually you'll wanna keep doing it.
You'll wanna do more and more
and more and more and more,
and you're gonna be inspiring
others as well in the meantime
and as a whole we're
gonna make a huge impact.
We already are, so without further ado,
I'm gonna get into some of the changes
that I have been making when it comes
to my travel essentials and zero waste.
Here are my zero waste
travel essentials. (laughs)
All the products I'm
gonna be talking about
in this video, I'll leave a link to
in the description box below, so be sure
to go and check those out.

A reusable water bottle,
probably something
that you are doing already.
It can seem a little bit more challenging
when you're traveling to
find a fresh water source
in places specifically
where it's not encouraged
to drink the tap water
because it can leave you sick.
It's easier to just go to a
store and buy a bottled water
than to find, sometimes, a
clean source of drinkable water
you can fill your water bottle
up at, but more and more
I'm seeing hotels and
restaurants all over the world
have a fresh water system where you can
fill up your water bottle, so just always
bring it with you because
most likely, you will be able
to find a fresh water source.
(missile whistles)
Reusable straws, I got some bamboo,
I got some metal ones
here, I bring them with me
when I travel, or just day-to-day
living back home, as well.
Screw the plastic straws, we
do not need those anymore.
I was first inspired to use
reusable straws when I saw video
you probably have seen
as well of a sea turtle
who has a plastic straw
stuck in it's nose,
and these people pull it out,
and it is one of the most
heart-breaking videos I have ever seen.
Makes you realize that
this way of being senseless
when it comes to waste
and just buying things
that are packaged in plastic
and aren't recyclable
and take years and years to deteriorate
are in turn hurting our planet
and hurting other living
things in our planet.
So if you haven't seen
that video, I encourage you
to watch it because
it's a real eye-opener.
You'll be able to find it,
just type it in YouTube,
turtle and plastic
straw, but anyways, yeah,
these are great.
(missile whistles)
Blendjet, because I love having a smoothie
every single morning, I've
been doing it for years.
It's how I start my day, and I
get my energy, and instead of
trying to find a smoothie
joint in the destination
that I'm at, I now just make
my own using local ingredients,
local produce, fruits and vegetables.
It's also budget friendly, and the blade,
let me just turn it on, is decent.
It is no Vitamix, no Ninja,
but it definitely does the job.
And you can bring it with
you throughout your whole day
and just keep adding things to it,
because it's a cup as well.
It's got this little filter,
the top, let me show you, ugh.
It's this little drinkable filter thing,
so no big pieces can come through it.
Keeps your smoothie nice
and smooth and creamy.
You can just keep adding
to it throughout the day,
and just keep blending it as you go.
(blender buzzes)
Pretty cool.
(missile whistles)
A bamboo spork, yes, a spork,
if you haven't heard of one,
is a spoon and a fork
mixed together in one.
I found this a few years
ago during my travels.
I can't remember where I was,
but I fell in love with it
and I have been using
it and traveling with it
ever since then, it's
great, so you don't have
to use any plastic cutlery, you just
have your little bamboo spork with you.
Super easy to just throw in your purse.
It's light, it's small,
easy to travel with.
(missile whistles)
Reusable pads, these are from
a company called GladRags.
I actually talk about periods
and travel way more in-depth,
and different products you can
use, eco-friendly products,
in a video I will link up
somewhere, that's gonna pop up now
as well as in the video description below.
These are really, really great.
I use reusable diapers
as well for my daughter,
so I can just throw these
all into the wash together
and use them over and over,
and also it's a huge money saver.
I'm more about the pads, I have
yet to try those underwear,
the period underwear,
if you've tried them,
let me know how they are, but
you can also use Diva cups,
or menstrual cups, I should say.
Diva cup is actually a
brand, this is the Diva cup.
And this is another menstrual
cup by GladRags as well.
And this is what it looks
like, basically you just
put it in, it fills up with the
blood and then you empty it.
It's good for if you have
normal flow kind of day.
For up to 12 hours, so this is
great when you're traveling,
you're out and about and don't wanna have
to deal with the mess.
You just, at the end of
the day when you're back
at your hotel or hostel or whatever,
you clean up, you're good to go.
(missile whistles)
A mason jar, if you're gonna
choose any one of the things
I mention in this video, first
I would choose the mason jar,
because it is multipurpose.
I like to fill this up with
yummy goodness for my flight.
So I can put a meal in here for
my flight to my destination.
I can use it as a coffee
mug, I can use it for water,
or any other type of beverage,
I use it for leftovers
after I've eaten at a
restaurant, there's so many
things you can use a mason jar for.
(missile whistles)
An electric razor, this thing
is great, C and I both use it.
We've had it for two
years now and have not had
to change the blade yet,
it's still goin' strong.
You don't even need
water and soap to use it,
which is great, and we use it
with reusable, chargeable batteries.
Rechargeable batteries,
if you don't have them,
go get yourself some
because they are awesome
and we use them for
all of our electronics.
(missile whistles)
Bar shampoo and conditioner,
I was first skeptical
about bar shampoo and conditioner
because I have a lot of
hair, very thick hair
and when you look at it, take it out.
When you look at it,
this is the shampoo bar,
I thought it wouldn't
last more than a week.
I have been using this for
a month and a half now.
The lady at the store told me
it would be good for 80 washes
and I completely believe her
because it lathers up so well.
I just tend to wash the roots
of my hair and leave the ends
of my hair, I don't really
wash those, I just rinse them
with water, this is gonna last me so long.
Cost me $12, and you can
put it in your carry-on
because it's not a liquid, so great.
The conditioner, on the other hand,
I go through a lot faster.
You can see here, I bought it
at the same time as my shampoo.
I am more than halfway done, I use a lot
of conditioner in my hair,
but to me, even if I have
to buy it more often, I
still feel like it's worth it
because I know I'm making a difference
in buying plastic conditioner bottles.
Smells so heavenly too.
♪ Ah ♪
And it works really well.
(missile whistles)
Bar facial and body moisturizer and serum.
I use this serum on my
face, it is so hydrating.
This will last me probably
about four to five months.
This is also from Lush, it's
almost slipping out of my hand
because it's so creamy.
It smells so delicious,
you just wanna eat it.
But you shouldn't, don't eat it.
Maybe you could eat it, it's all natural.
(missile whistles)
Reusable make up wipes,
these things are great.
I got them at the Green
Living Show in Toronto,
which happens every year,
it's a place where you can get
eco-friendly products, really cool event.
These are made, one side made
from a face cloth material
and the other side's a
little softer material.
I just use a little bit of coconut oil
to wipe off my makeup,
throw these in the laundry,
and you can reuse them over
and over again, they're great.
(missile whistles)
A day bag, I never leave
the house or hostel,
or guest house, whatever,
hotel, without a day bag.
One, because I'm always
carrying my camera with me.
Also if I want to shop,
whether it's grocery shopping,
clothing shopping, whatever, I
don't wanna use plastic bags.
I just put everything in
my day bag, so anything
that I collect throughout
the day goes in here,
and I don't have to use
any type of plastic bags.
(missile whistles)
A bamboo toothbrush, I
transitioned from other types
of toothbrushes to bamboo one
about a month and a half ago.
I love it, I have sensitive
teeth, sensitive gums,
and the bristles are super
soft, they're plant-based.
The base of this is made from bamboo,
and the whole thing is biodegradable.
(missile whistles)
And a cloth napkin, this
is actually a face cloth
that I stole from Ky (laughs).
But you can use a hankie or whatever.
I just throw it in my purse or my bag
and use it instead of a
napkin throughout the day.
You can use it when traveling,
use it when you're at home,
you can use it at any time and just use it
over and over and over again, don't have
to throw anything into the garbage
after using it once, this is good forever.
(missile whistles)
Bringing snacks from home for your flight.
I highly encourage this, so
you're not buying anything
and spending so much
money, too, at the airport,
buying snacks that are in
plastic bags or whatever.
You can bring your own snacks from home.
You can put them in your mason jar,
which I highly recommended, and then use
the container over and over again.
These are the changes
that I have made over
the last little while and I am
really feelin' good about it.
I wanna keep making
changes, but once you start,
you just want to keep going and going.
It becomes a fun game and
something that feels good.
You know you're making a difference,
and I hope by you watching this video,
first I think since you
clicked on it, something
that you're interested in, and I hope
that this inspired you in
some way to make small changes
in your life that will, in
turn, make a huge difference.
Now, I want to know, what
small changes have you already
made in your life to reduce your waste?
