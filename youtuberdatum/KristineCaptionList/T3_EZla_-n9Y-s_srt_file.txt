over the past decade we've stayed in
hundreds of unique rental properties
around the globe so we've partnered with
airbnb
to create a series called meet your host
their platform has seen
tremendous success for hosts of unique
stays we'll be visiting these unique
properties around the world
and hearing from the people who brought
them to life
[Music]
i'm kristen sarah and welcome to another
episode of meet your host
i am in nosara costa rica where i'm
going to meet up with jack who is
originally from the uk
moved to costa rica and has set up a
thriving business based on not one
but two airstreams
[Music]
hello jack nice to meet you lovely to
meet you guys too
i'm so excited to be here i feel like
it's going to feel like home in a way
because we also live in an airstream you
know
half of the year so i'm excited to see
the table yeah i'm very excited to have
you guys all right
come on in
[Music]
first of all the like the atmosphere
here is beautiful it feels like i'm
standing beside luna our airstream but
then we're in like this tropical
paradise
and there's two of them not just mine
this is our 1978
uh airstream ambassador i found this guy
in
ohio at all places yeah
this is amazing and i'd like to know
more about like what first of all why
airstreams and wine asara
i first came to costa rica and asar in
2008
and my early 20s i used to be a surf
instructor
so i came out to work for one of the
surf skills here in costa rica
spent almost two years out here left
came back left came back um
and yeah i found myself uh in 2017
uh with some time off my job back in
europe and
yeah longing to be back at the beach
back in the jungle
and i decided to come back out and and
figure out how i could
spend more time here we actually first
started to get tourists from costa rica
from san jose the city folk who
who needed a break from from their lives
and the lockdown which was much more
serious in those
urban areas um so we had weekend
visitors and it was a great soft opening
and then as
things started to open up and we were
ready for
for for what came next which was a
popularity on airbnb which is great
all right i am dying to get inside to
see so english yeah great
this is amazing
the first thing that comes to mind as
soon as i stepped in is just how
spacious it is i
love how open it is yeah both the air
streams are different
we designed them differently um as you
know from your renovation
uh you kind of have to work with with
the space you've got
i love how you kept some of the like the
original vintage pieces
like uh-huh yep original cabinets yeah
and
the bed is this a queen-size bed yeah
it's at least a queen is a little bit
bigger
obviously the corners are curved in it
was a challenge in itself just finding
finding the bed to fit here we ended up
having to get
a custom foam square so it's a
it's a temper paddock
foam mattress super comfy all the sheets
are from
from a company in san jose the hotel
quality sheets it was really important
for me
um as a pilot uh i've spent a lot of
time in hotels and
and i took my experience in all these
different hotels the things that i liked
the things i didn't like and
the things that were really important to
me and one of those is really comfy bed
with
really comfy sheets another thing i'm
look i'm
seeing are these like cabinets under
here it's for
luggage specifically right yeah um
obviously the limited space you need a
place to put your suitcase once you've
unpacked
um so i made sure that the cupboards
under the bed were big enough for for
luggage
um surfboards aren't gonna fit in here
so we had to build the outdoor storage
for those
um but but yeah obviously people aren't
traveling with a whole lot of stuff but
that big bulky suitcase you do need
somewhere to put it so that slides right
under the bed
you've got plenty of drawers under the
sofa for all your clothes and the
wardrobe towards the back
um but yeah once you've unpacked you
need somewhere to tuck that away until
it's time to go home you know some of
those important things especially for
for for my demographic which is
generally solo travelers couples maybe a
young family
everyone who's here is usually got to
stay connected to home or to work
so both our streams have a desk this is
a sitting desk the other airstream has a
standing desk towards the back there's a
stall as well
um but a nice workspace and then the the
internet we we use a local company here
and
and they're pretty good i mean we're in
the jungle it does go out occasionally
but
i try to make sure that the speed is 100
meg plus
just so people can work and stay
connected a vintage
trailer just in itself is is iconic you
know
and and people fall in love with them
i found you guys very early on in the
process and saw your renovation and
and it was a a good bit of inspiration
for me
so i took my favorite parts of everyone
else's renovation and kind of
mashed it into my own this is like
as soon as like we saw this we're like
okay we need to renovate our airstream
again because
this is amazing it's such a feature uh
yeah let's open it up
cool all right you want to get that
sauce sure all right
he's like hydraulic yeah it sounds like
a spaceship opening huh
oh my gosh when i found the airstream it
was completely bare inside
the guys who had it before me had
started a food kitchen renovation i
guess they had the service window put in
but that's as far as they got um i toyed
with the idea of maybe opening an
attack at a stand or a small restaurant
but i i sort of steered away from that
and went back to
the airbnb which i'm glad i did and it
works great
um you know as i mentioned previously
you want to be outdoors you want to be
in touch with
the nature here in costa rica and and
this is ideal you can sit on the sofa
read a book you've got the window open
there's already a nice breeze coming in
um yeah i love the window it's a great
feature
it wasn't my idea but i'm glad i found
it yeah it's it's definitely like
one of the first things you see when you
come in here like what's that
the choice of using airbnb over
other platforms is just the the ease of
use
it's so intuitive it's so easy just to
set up
you can literally set your account up in
a day and be hosting you know
within a week as soon as you get your
first bookings and the
the payment methods like everything just
flows it works really really well
there's a lot of platforms out there
won't know many names but uh they're
they're just not intuitive
there's a lot of work that goes into
them and and not much help
from them either you know if you have
any questions or things like that airbnb
has been really helpful
so full-size bathroom almost um regular
toilet
we've got our sink we provide you know
hand washed hand sanitizer
shampoo nice big shower hot and cold
water and you can fit in this
way how tall are you i'm six foot
so yeah i can i can stand easily in the
shower the other bathroom's a little bit
smaller but
that's impressive for an airstream yeah
[Music]
you know even staying in a caravan it's
not the same as staying in an airstream
especially an older one these are both
from the 70s the the windows are
original
a lot of you know the light switches and
things like that the places that they're
in it's just
it's not super intuitive yeah they loved
it though
every everyone who's come and stayed a
lot of them haven't
been in an airstream or a caravan
there's not many caravans in costa rica
let alone airstreams
so um yeah it's it's a real uh novel
novel experience for for people to come
and stay in the airstreams and
everyone's really enjoyed it
i felt like there was a bit of a gap in
the market here in nassara you've
probably seen all the
huge million dollar homes there's not
much for like a young family
a solo traveler a young couple other
than a hotel room
and sometimes you know when you're
traveling especially if you're doing a
longer trip
you want your own cooking facilities you
want your own space a little bit of an
outdoor space too and
traveling in the pandemic it's it's kind
of perfect it's your own little capsule
of
fun down by the beach i'd love to see
more of the properties can you show us
around a little bit of course yeah okay
[Music]
on the bike yes right
yeah we're so central here that once you
arrive you don't really need
anything other than a bicycle to get
around you can get to the store you can
get to the restaurants they each have a
lock if you want to leave them on the
beach and go for a swim
and they're free for everyone to use
we've got our
ping pong table it's uh
fabricated in san jose and brought down
by um a local
uh metal worker don gerardo he built
this for me it's quarter inch steel
we went a little bit over the top with
the ping pong table um
quarter inch steel and and it's gonna
last forever just like the airstreams do
so in costa rica there's not many
caravans
um there's definitely not many
airstreams so i ship both of these guys
down from the states
i'm british so that was an experience in
itself
i haven't spent a whole lot of time in
the us um
so i i was searching on craigslist
ebay and and found uh this guy
in ohio and the other guy i found in
connecticut
when i found both the airstreams they're
in sort of different states of repair
this guy was pretty good the other one
was was basically like a barn find
it didn't have a floor it didn't have
interior walls so
i spent a little bit of time working on
them in the us
um i found a workshop up there that let
me park them up and go spend a couple
months we did some wiring
the subfloors things like that shipped
them down
it was a challenge in itself
there was a lot of hurdles to jump over
roadblocks just things that came out of
left field
yeah it was it was an experience for
sure with the with regards to the
renovations
um back home uh i'm actually a
commercial pilot
so the electrical things i had a bit of
an
understanding of woodworking carpentry
i brought in the professionals um
and i really wanted to do that here
having been in the states you know
you've got everything you need
five minutes away regardless of where
you are here in the jungle
it's a little bit different so with um
the
the interiors i i designed them i kind
of
chose different things that i liked from
from other renovations including yours
um and i had some local carpenters come
in
and and help me with the renovations but
one of the things i wanted to do was was
use
local materials uh the the floors are
teak floors
teak wood floors the countertop in the
kitchen is is guanacaste the national
tree of costa rica
and and yeah the the local guys who came
in to help
awesome did a fantastic job never seen
an airstream in their lives but
they're so talented that that they found
all these like crazy work arounds for
the curves for the for the floor
not being there's no straight lines in
there so yeah it was a challenge and and
they all said they really
enjoyed it the renovation took probably
like
between 6 and 12 months there was
different phases where
different things were ready obviously
with um
everything that's happening with the the
kovid 19 pandemic
um we sort of tapped on the brakes a
little bit we were
we had a deadline um blew through it
completely
we weren't ready and then uh with
everything that was happening
it kind of helped me just sort of tap on
the brakes
relax a little bit make sure everything
was was done perfectly so we slowed down
and
finished it slower than than we had
originally planned to
um but yeah we we got it done in about a
year
for me obviously just owning land here
in costa rica
being able to just live here sustain
myself is
is in itself the the reward for me you
know that was the ultimate goal is to be
able to be here and
have an income um and provide something
a little bit different
i think with the airstreams they're so
made for airbnb the platform is is
all about special unique places staying
in somebody's home not
not a blank room or you know a sterile
environment
um it was like the obvious choice for
the airstreams
and and they've done so well on the
platform
yeah it's it's been a good experience
[Music]
everyone's here either surf or do yoga
or you know just take a break from
from city life so yeah we've tried to
create like a nice
calming environment you can surf you've
got space on your deck to do yoga
we've got the ping pong table and the
fire pit too so you can
have a grill hook up you're down here in
the jungle
i mentioned it before you're outdoors a
lot you really don't need that much
i think we live in a society now where
we have a lot of material things and
you know these guys are like almost 50
years old we upcycled them we reused
them
you know we we could tow them away and
the
you know pull up the planks off the deck
and and it would look just as it did
when when we found the place
you know i want people to leave knowing
that they can live
a nice simple easy life by the beach and
hopefully it inspires them to do
something similar
although there were several hurdles to
overcome it's apparent that there is a
thriving
business here people want to come from
all around the world to spend time in
these two airstreams
by the sea and it's also given me some
inspiration and ideas to bring our own
airstream to costa rica
i hope you enjoyed jack's story as much
as i did
[Music]
you
