products

with that has made
our luna 2.0 these companies that i'm
going to share with you
you can use them to redecorate your van
your rv your airstream your home your
dorm room
whatever it is but it's good to keep in
mind that it's not just what we put into
our bodies the food that we we eat
but it's the water we drink it's what we
put on our bodies
it's what we breathe in it's all of
these things
are important it's not just the food
that we eat so as
i have tried to swap out things in my
life that for like
organic non-toxic um options
i have also been doing that with my home
decor my
what i put on my body my clothes the
towels i use
the the pillow i put my my head down on
the at the end of the day
all these things are important so i'm
gonna be sharing these with you
so that you can incorporate them into
your life no matter
how you're living let's talk about
bedding first home of
wool this is the company that we went
with to
create kai's custom bed her mattress is
custom dimensions home of wool makes all
natural one-of-a-kind wool mattresses
they make duvets they make pillowcases
they make other home decor and the
quality
is just really really good
the futon shop makes non-toxic
mattresses
bedding decor you name it anything to do
with like sleeping
we went with the eastern king moonlight
organic mattress in a medium
firmness and it is perfection it is so
comfortable
i i really don't want to sleep on any
other mattress
the futon shop also made the cushions
that i'm sitting on here and they are
custom
made when we decided to re-renovate our
airstream we cut
the front part of our seating area our
dining area in half
so we needed new cushions and we needed
also
new um covers as well even the covers
are completely organic
naturally dyed inside it's made of um
coconut fiber and not spam like spandex
no latex
latex or organic non-toxic right now i'm
sitting on what would be
an extra bed or just like an extra
lounging area but
i can take this piece off here the
middle piece that i'm sitting on
and then bring up the the dining room
table so we can eat
it's really really really easy to trans
transition from one to the other
and the cushions allow you to have both
a bed
and a dining area which is really nice
when we were building kai's bad that's
when i really started thinking about
paint she was going to be sleeping so
close
to this like in this confined area that
would be surrounded by like because i
wanted to paint it
surrounded by paint so the paint that i
was using
i wanted it to not have any chemicals in
it like she's this
small little human breathing in you know
i don't want her breathing in chemicals
every single night it took me a good
month to finally decide how i wanted to
paint
in a non-toxic way i tried flower paint
first and it didn't really turn out
anyways i ended up going with a company
called homestead house and they make
milk paint it's literally
milk protein clay chalk limestone and
natural pigment to make
the paint it is non-toxic zero voc
it's organic it's biodegradable and it
is
beautiful to work with then there's a
company called earth pigments i found
and they make natural
pigments that you can add to paint to
get like your ultimate color so
i bought a couple of those and i added
to
paint as well as the stain that we have
on our
one of our feature wall with the
apothecary cabinet that is also milk
paint stain
and then we added some natural pigments
to make the color that it is
and then i use a hemp oil to protect
both kai's bedroom where we did the milk
paint as well as a milk pink stain
now let's get to the kitchen almond cow
it has become
my new favorite appliance i drink
plant-based
milks so that's oat milk almond milk
coconut milk uh cashew milk
and like there's other additives put
into these milks that you can get in the
grocery store
but with the almond cow it's literally
like you put in your ingredients you
press the button
and it makes this deliciously creamy
plant-based milk and it costs so little
to make
a liter of milk that you would pay at
the grocery store store like five
dollars
it would cost maybe one
to two dollars depending on what kind of
milk i'm making in the almond cow
so i'm saving money it's better for the
environment it's better for my health
because there's no additives to it it's
just simple
straightforward water that i use for my
berkey
which i'll get to talking about and
um oats or nuts i add some dates
sometimes i add some chocolate chips
sometimes i had some bananas sometimes
i get to just like be creative and milk
to make different milks using
real ingredients i will leave a link to
all these products including the almond
cow
in the description box below and as well
as a
link especially with a special offer for
you guys you can get your own
almond cow which i highly recommend the
breakfast pantry
is another local company that i found
and they have these beautiful mason jars
i'm all about having mason jars in my
pantry with
different things from nuts the cereal so
pastas in it and there and my potions
for my smoothies
and these ones are just like a little
fancier berkey
yes or berkey i am in love with our
berkey
it is a water system that filters
all the crap out of the water like uh
chlorine
fluoride pharmaceuticals and other crap
that's in the water yes
what you put into your body is so
important we often just think of like
food
but what about the water we drink so the
berkey gives us nice clean water
everywhere we go we've also added in
minerals extra minerals
into the bottom of our berkey just to
give us extra minerals
in our drinking water which is important
grund they make
organic towels that are like
the biggest warmest softest hug when you
get out of a shower
and why would i get an organic towel
well
because when you are taking a shower
a hot one if you're like if you're like
me like hot showers then especially this
is especially important
it opens up your pores and your skin is
the
biggest organ on your body if you're
putting on a
normal towel a towel that's been like
dosed and chemicals
then that's also going to go onto your
skin and into your bloodstream so
i decided to get organic towels because
that was important to me
soul organics is where we got all of our
bedding so our bed sheets our duvet our
bed or do they cover
our pillows our pillowcases everything
is our 100 organic
and just feels so clean and healthy and
gives me the best sleep of my life
i was on etsy pretty much every day this
summer i just
love seeing what people are creating
just unique pieces
from different artists around the world
and i wanted to
bring them into luna to have like these
accent pieces that people would come in
and like
stare at and remember my mountain shop
is the perfect altar for all my crystals
and my sage i absolutely
love waking up and looking at it we have
it just at the foot of our bed
and the quality of it is just spot on
i love that a father daughter duo made
it from
bc canada british columbia and it's just
like
great craftsmanship and supporting local
supporting these small artists
making really quality stuff maywoven is
the brand i decided to go with when it
comes to decorative pillows
this is one of them that i'm holding
this is a mud cloth pillow
i have some other designs behind me as
well the company
works directly with the artists who are
from different parts of the world
and they hand make these these pillows
these pillowcases i should say the
pillows i chose are all
made from natural materials there's no
chemically dyed materials added to them
they're all handmade one of a kind and
they're just
yeah they're exactly what i was looking
for another thing that was really hard
to find was
a natural carpet finally found one
and the only thing is it came in a very
light color i do absolutely love it it
is a wool carpet
anything that i thought was going to
become a stain was actually really easy
to move with
like a simple non-toxic stain remover
that i have
and um yeah i really like it i'm so
happy that we went with the black carpet
and lastly
stickwood which is a company that makes
reclaimed wood planking and that's what
we use to
build kai's treehouse bunk bed stickwood
is made from both responsibly sourced
reclaimed wood
and sustainably harvested wood found
throughout the us
it is super easy to work with it was a
little bit trickier here in the
airstream because of all the curves of
the wall
but it is really easy to work with you
just need a table saw
and it's got like the sticky the
stickiness on the back of it already and
with the protection on it so you just
peel off the protection
put the the piece on the wall and use a
rubber mallet that it comes with and
bang bang
bang it's as easy as that and it's like
putting all these puzzle pieces together
to get your final product and that is it
for this video i feel like
i feel like there actually might be some
other companies that i miss but i try to
think of all of them
um this gives you definitely a start and
it's something to
maybe think about if you haven't before
about the other products and
items that you have in your house are
those
the best choices for your health for
your life like it's your home it's
supposed to be a safe place
so it's not just the food we put in our
body but it's everything else that we
surround ourselves with and breathe in
and put on our put on our skin
etc that we have to think about when it
comes to our health and our well-being
so
this is kind of just to get you thinking
and um
i hope you enjoyed it and yeah i'll see
you in another video
bye guys
