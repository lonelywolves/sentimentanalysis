(crickets chirping)
- Good morning, it is our
first day waking up here
in the mountains, and this
is where I spent the night.
That was my bed.
It was a very cold night,
like close to freezing
temperatures, maybe like four
or five degrees Celsius.
And I think last night
I caught a stomach bug
or I got food poisoning
or something, 'cause,
I couldn't sleep.
I went to bed at like 10:00 p.m.
I couldn't fall asleep
until like 4:00 a.m.
It was brutal, it was very, very brutal.
But today,
hopefully, I feel better.
It's kinda hard to feel bad
when you wake up to views like this.
Okay guys, this is mountain Nanga Parbat,
and it's the ninth highest
mountain in the world.
This is our view for breakfast.
It's pretty incredible,
and it's right here.
So they built an entire
village here in the mountains,
so anyone who wants to do a bit of a hike
and stay here and have a hot
shower and have a hot meal,
and have electricity, you can do that,
and you can rent out one of
these cabins for about $50-$60
US a day, which is great,
and you can also have cheaper options.
You can even tent it here.
I don't know if I would recommend that
just because of how cold
it was last night, but,
if you're a mountaineer
and you can handle it,
I mean, go for it 'cause
that's the cheaper option.
But it is really nice, and
the cabins are actually,
they're beautiful.
I had pretty low
expectations from the cabin
when they said, "Oh,
we'll stay in the cabin
"and in the mountains," I
didn't think it was gonna be
as nice as these are or have,
at least have a washroom.
There was running water
and a washroom, and,
hot water in them, so pretty phenomenal
for considering where we are right now.
Okay, having breakfast in the mountains.
We have omelet.
How's the omelet?
- Nice.
- [Siya] Is it good?
- Mm-hmm.
- [Siya] Paratha?
- [Man Eating] Mm-hmm.
- [Siya] And what's the difference
between paratha and, like, naan or?
- [Man Eating] Basic, paratha's fried.
- [Siya] Okay, so it's
put in a pan and fried?
- [Man Eating] Mm-hmm.
- [Siya] Okay.
We have some porridge that
we had with some nuts.
What do we got here?
- [Woman] Deez nuts (laughs).
- [Siya] Deez nuts, looks
like some mulberries,
some peanuts, raisins.
- [Woman] Apricot.
- [Siya] Apricot, dates.
(rock music)
- This is the point where three mountain,
greatest mountain ranges meet.
This is Hindu Kush,
Karakorums, and Himalayas.
So all these three greatest
mountain ranges of the world,
they converge at this point.
We'll stop and take some photos there.
(rock music)
- Before we get to the second
half of this Pakistan video,
I want to take a brief minute
to thank one of our sponsors,
so when we're traveling and we're away,
it's important to keep our stuff safe,
and it's important to
keep an eye on our place
when we're not traveling here,
so we've partnered with Ring.com.
So they have security cameras,
they have doorbell cameras.
They have cameras all around your house
to essentially create a ring
of security around your house.
Since we got this system,
we've been more relaxed
when we're traveling
about our stuff being safe
because we can check up on it.
These are all connected
through wifi to our cellphones,
so no matter where we are in the world,
we can check in, we can make
sure that our place is safe.
If someone drops off a
package to our front door,
we can actually see that
they rang our doorbell,
and we can see them on camera and ask them
to leave the package, that
we'll be back later on today.
The whole system is super easy to set up
and very easy to use.
Honestly, I wouldn't be saying that to you
unless it was true.
It took us like an hour to set
up like five or six cameras,
and because we're
partnering with Ring.com,
you guys are gonna get a special deal.
So if you head on to Ring.com/HTG,
you'll see that special offer.
So Ring.com/HTG.
Now, back to Pakistan.
Kay, so now we have started our descent
from the mountain.
We're going back down to where we started,
and then I guess we're gonna
hop in those jeeps again,
and do our treacherous
drive on the cliff edge.
Make it back to the
city where we can bathe,
change our clothes, get a nice meal.
Woo, can't wait.
(rock music)
(running water)
(rock music)
I can do this
hiking-down-a-mountain thing,
I mean, if that's all the
hiking I had to do in mountains
was down them, that would be great.
Just take like, a funicular
up to the top, hike down.
It's way easier, you definitely
don't feel the exhaustion
that you feel hiking up.
But it does take different
muscle groups to walk down,
and it's harder on your knees,
so if you have bad knees,
don't go hiking down a mountain.
I am shocked that these guys
are just walking up and down
these mountains carrying
over a hundred pounds
on their back, not even breaking a sweat.
They don't even care, they're
not even slowing down.
When you grow at high altitude,
you body gets accustomed to it,
so if these guys were to
go to sea level and train,
they would excel, they would dominate.
'Cause their lungs and their heart
are used to high altitude.
Okay, we've made it back to camp.
What are you excited for?
(laughs)
- We made it!
- We made it (laughs)!
- I'm great (laughs).
- My butt definitely hurts
after all the van rides
and bumpy jeep rides and
riding on the roof of the car,
and then hiking, it's taken a toll.
Definitely needs a little butt massage.
I'll give myself a butt massage later.
So we got back to the jeeps.
This is our jeep, the very first one,
but there is a line up of
jeeps all the way down there.
And you obviously can not drive
the first jeep around, so.
(men talking in foreign language)
I don't know how they're
gonna figure this out,
but I'm sure they have it worked out,
or we'll have to take the
jeep at the very front.
(man shouts in foreign language)
Pakistan problems.
(engines idling)
I'm not sure how long
this is gonna take.
- There's a traffic jam here.
- But there-
- Who woulda expected
a traffic jam in the
middle of nowhere?
- You're on a mountain.
Exactly, who woulda
thought there was gonna
be a traffic jam?
- And I don't think I can call an Uber.
I don't think that'll work here.
It's amazing, so much open
space, and there's a jam.
- There's a traffic jam.
- Yeah.
(men talking in foreign language)
- [Man In Hat] Thank God I
lost that weight; otherwise,
I would never have made it through there.
(engine idling)
- Okay, so what we've done is, we've,
kinda bargained with the
guys at the front jeep
to let us take this car
to where we need to go
so that we don't have to wait
for our jeep at the very back
to get out, which could
take an hour or two.
(horn honking)
(Pakistani music)
(man shouts in foreign language)
- [Man In Hat] He's close man, that's...
(engine revs)
(soft Pakistani music)
(engine humming)
(soft Pakistani music)
- Woo, how crazy was that adventure?
Heading down the mountain, way easier!
But just like so spectacular, Pakistan.
I was lovin' the jeep rides,
I'm lovin' the hiking.
I'm loving the adventure.
I'm loving meeting the locals.
The locals were some of the
friendliest people in the world.
Pakistani people, you guys are incredible,
you're so welcoming, you're
so open, you're so loving,
you're so curious, and
you're very hospitable.
Nearly everyone we met
wanted to give us chai
and cook us a meal, and
introduce us to their family.
I mean, you don't really get
to see that anywhere else
in the world.
I just loved the
hospitality of the locals.
The footage we captured on this trip
was all very collaborative.
Everyone was a creator, a videographer.
People had drones and
GoPros and a buncha cameras,
so we got a lot of angles
of every situation,
and some of the footage that I
took, I gave to other people.
Some of their footage, I took and used.
So I just wanted to thank
everyone that was involved
in creating this piece and
capturing these moments.
There were some beautiful
moments that were captured
of me or other people that I couldn't get
because maybe I wasn't there,
or they got footage of me,
which was great to see.
One of the main guys that
was capturing footage
for everyone was Zooby.
Zoob-ziggidy as I called him,
and he is an incredible DOP.
He is an amazing cinematographer,
drone pilot, everything.
I'm gonna put his handle,
so show this guy some love,
'cause, he's a little shy.
He didn't wanna appear
on camera very much,
but off-camera, super fun guy.
He was actually my roommate
for the entire trip,
so we got to chat at night,
and we got into some really
cool deep conversations,
so yes, I just wanna
thank everyone on the trip
that helped put these pieces together,
including the next videos that are coming,
and oh the next video.
We have a lot of fun, so.
We go from Hunza Valley,
spectacular, amazing,
to Gilgit, and Gilgit is
another amazing place.
These places I've never
heard of in my life,
I'm shocked because
they're just so beautiful.
And we even go to markets, we go shopping.
I buy something pretty cool for myself
and for my wife Kristen.
So I'm excited to show you
guys us all in the streets,
in the markets, shopping,
and mingling with locals,
trying on local outfits.
It's a lot of fun,
so tune in next week for that video.
Take care, guys.
