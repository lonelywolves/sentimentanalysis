and we have some big news i am so
excited i feel
so on the on the right path and uh i
am just so excited to share with you
guys one two three
we might land in co-study
[Music]
you guys heard correctly we are moving
to costa rica we want to help reforest
land we want to
live in the jungle we want to be
surrounded by plants and animals
and super fruits of the earth before we
get into all the juicy details about our
move we want to take a moment and talk
about one of our partners
amaru mayu and they have very similar
values to us
at reforesting the amazon and protecting
indigenous communities to not just
reforest the land
but sustainably harvest two super fruits
that are in the amazon these two fruits
are the buriti fruit and the kamu kamu
i've heard of kamukamo
i haven't heard of buriti but i'm about
to learn
more about them because we're having a
video chat with jorge who's
leading up this movement i want you to
hear from another expert
that loves super fruits around the world
i am obsessed with fruits absolutely
obsessed that is one of my top reasons
for wanting to move to costa rica i'm so
passionate about learning about
different fruits and
you'd be surprised there are so many
fruits i still don't know about or i'm
learning currently
finding out about today amadi mayu's
mission is to prevent deforestation in
the amazon by creating a commercial
market for these superfoods
by creating drinks using these
superfoods that you can purchase
online and therefore take part in this
big mission
the trees that bear these fruits to make
the drink already exist
in the jungle therefore leaving the
natural state of the jungle as it is
they're also empowering indigenous
communities by giving them
jobs to go and climb the trees to
collect the fruit
something that they have been doing and
already know how to do
c and i have a call with jorge from
amaru mayu and he's going to tell us a
little bit more about the company and
above the drinks
and we're going to let you in on this
call so come on
this is how important it is to stop the
fire station
mother nature has created a superfood
that comes from here hundred grams of
pudi
has more vitamin a than 3.5 kilos of
calories
vitamin c omega 3609
potassium calcium phosphorus avocado has
in 60 times more vitamin c than a lemon
or 50 times better than that
and the carbohydrates it will be an
aluminum bottle
beautiful not only recyclable but
reusable by
directly from them
we are working with nikon ladies more
communities will be involved
more area will be protected from
deforestation
wow that was a great call it was really
informative amazing
amazing what they're doing and i'm so
glad to be part of it mm-hmm and

remember of waking up in the morning
stepping outside of my own
home and just being immersed in a food

felt the jungle
the jungle is like where my food comes
from the jungle has medicine the jungle
has
life the jungle has oxygen it has all

that yesterday talking about our vision
how we want our structure to look i
would love to get luna there

be super cool that we would have her but
we have to figure out logistics for that

doing it
with other people from around the world

in costa rica
creating a community together and we all
have this same
grand vision and a lot of similar
qualities traits skills but also
different ones that we can share with
each other just like life values
