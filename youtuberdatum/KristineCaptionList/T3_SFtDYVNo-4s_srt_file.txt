if you are an organized person you just

good on ya if you're like me not very
organized i've been
told my by my family for years how
disorganized i am
but i'm trying my best to be more
organized and
here are six ways how i'm keeping my
suitcase organized when i travel
i'd also like to thank light travel for
sponsoring this video i'm going to be
talking about their deluxe
packing cube set which is my ultimate
favorite
packing cubes i've ever used and i've
used many i've been traveling the world
for
15 plus years i've been to over 70
countries i have a lot of experience and
expertise on the subject especially when
it comes packing because i've
used backpacks to carry on suitcases to
big suitcases duffel bags and all
sorts of packing cubes the light travel
packing cube deluxe set comes with
large packing cubes just like this one
also comes with smaller packing cubes
like this one it also comes with a
toiletry set
a two-part toiletry set a cable bag
and shoe bag
what i love about these packing cubes is
there's this hook and hang system
so you can hook it on the back of a door
a doorknob even in a closet on a hanger
and you can easily access your clothes
from the front zipper like so and open
and if you fold your clothes like i have
not mess up the rest of your clothing
this packing cube also has another
zipper which is used to compress your
clothes so right now the zipper is open
and you can see the bag is as expanded
as it's gonna get and this is
how i like to have it when i'm packing
my clothes because i like to put as many
as i can possibly get in here and then
you take that zipper
that compression zipper as i zip it's
compressing
the clothes inside making the bag
smaller
which means you can fit more in your
suitcase but you're not taking less
clothes
a shoe bag as soon as i started using a
shoe bag
i've always used a shoe bag while
traveling because it's a great
way to keep your shoes first of all in
one place in this light travel
shoe bag i can fit my running shoes
hiking shoes a couple pairs of sandals
as well as a couple pair of my
daughter's shoes as well in here so
that's quite a bit
and it keeps everything you know
contained that because your shoes get
dirty from hiking
doing whatever there's sand there's mud
they get wet
just keeps everything all the dirtiness
contained in one bag
so the rest of the stuff in your
suitcase doesn't get wrapped or dirty
[Music]
a good toiletry bag is essential because
usually toiletries are a bunch of like
little items and having them just like
randomly put throughout your suitcase is
not very practical it's not very
organized and we're staying organized
here
so i've been using the light travel
toiletry kit it comes with two bags
they are velcroed together but you can
just rip them apart because
in this bag here it's just a simple bag
water resistant again
i like to keep shampoos conditioners
body creams body wash
in this bag here and then in this one
and i can put this like right by the
shower
and this one there's a hook as well
so this one is where i like to keep this
is actually sia's
but i like to keep all of my makeup in
here as well as my toothbrush and my
toothpaste
and you can even have it like this
because there's that velcro system
if you want to attach everything
together to keep it all organized
you can do so just like that this is has
been
really great and i love that you can
just hook it up the material used to
make these packing cubes
extremely lightweight very durable it's
really hard to wreck
and it's also water resistant i was just
on a boat and
my suitcase got completely wet inside
the suitcase also got wet
packing cubes got wet but because it's
water resistant none of the clothes got
wet
cable ties my husband really likes these
especially because i have been known to
you know have
so many cables because of what we do we
travel the world we film
we have our computer our cameras there's
a lot of cables going on
and i would just take all of my cables
and just throw them all together and put
them
in my suitcase and they would just get
tangled up in a drive my husband
absolutely crazy now we have these
reusable rubber cable ties just
we just got them off of amazon they come
in different sizes as well
and you can just take your cables like
so
easily wrap the cable ties around
like so and light travel also comes with
the deluxe set also comes with this
cable bag which is really cool
it has these all these all these little
compartments with elastics
so you can now just take your cables and
stick it behind these little elastics
here
and it keeps it even more organized you
don't have to be traveling international
to benefit from packing cubes you can
also just use it if you're going to
the cottage for a week or on a road trip
with friends
just nice to have all of your stuff
organized and they do a great job of
doing that i'm gonna link the like

moving on to a couple more items
a traveling jewelry kit i have tons of
jewelry it's like one of the things that
i absolutely love
to collect when i'm traveling around the
world because it's small it's meaningful
it's a great way to express yourself and
different countries
have different techniques when it comes
to jewelry making i love this
little tiny case because it is little
but it also
can hold quite a bit i'm just going to
open it i got off of amazon as well and
i've used whoops
i've used several my daughter was
obviously in here because
she loves it and it's a little
disorganized so hold that thought
i've used other ones before but i found
that they were just like
they just weren't they didn't really
hold as much and there weren't all these
compartments for different items of
jewelry
this one there's a place for rings
there's a place for earrings and
bracelets and necklaces and studs which
i obviously
need some because i don't have any i
love it it's great
it's small but it you know packs a lot
a wet bag for the first year of my
daughter's life we were using reusable
cloth
diapers and this wet bag would be the
place that we put all of the
stinky pea and poo diapers
the used diapers just keep all the smell
contained
and it worked really well so now we use
it as our laundry bag when we travel
because
a lot of the times we have wet clothing
and we're traveling from place to place
and we don't have time to like
let it dry before we leave so we put
like wet items in here for at the beach
for the day
or just smelly items in general it's
really durable the other
other ones that i've used have ripped or
just like they're just not good
quality this one is definitely good
quality
