- The vision behind us is to change
the global perception of Pakistan.
We have an opportunity today,
through these social media influencers
who've got followers in the millions,
we can show a real and
true image of Pakistan
to the entire world.
We are bringing global influencers
from the travel sphere to Pakistan
and taking them on tours
across the country.
Our first tour, we went to the areas
of Swat and Chitral,
and the Kalasha Valleys
and down to Karachi and Gwadar.
And now on our second trip we're going
towards Hunza and Skardu, and
the Gilgit-Baltistan area.
This initiative we have completely,
privately funded it, as CPIC
as a private organization.
There's been no government
involvement in the initiative,
we are doing this fully ourselves,
arranging it all ourselves,
it is just a passion project.
Through tourism, not only
are we attracting money
into Pakistan, the economy
of foreign currency
into Pakistan, but we are changing
that global perception
people have of Pakistan.
We are changing the country's PR.
And the knock on effect
of that is so significant,
that alone, if we can just change
Pakistan's global perception,
if we can change the country's PR,
the country can make
a complete turnaround,
both in terms of the economy,
in terms of foreign direct investment,
everything is a domino effect,
it's all linked to this one factor,
and the way we identified it,
our shortcut to changing
Pakistan's global perception
is by bringing these
social media influencers
from across the world to Pakistan,
to enjoy the country, and
to share their experiences
with their followers in
a real and organic way.
You know, these people are not actors,
these are real people sharing
their real experiences.
Something which cannot be reenacted.
Let's take the steps to be the change
that we want to see in the country.
Let's take the steps to make
the Pakistan that we want
and show the world a true
and real image of Pakistan.
(birds chirping)
- Day 3 in Pakistan.
Okay, so yesterday we started
in Islamabad, in the capital.
We were supposed to fly
all the way over here,
but that didn't happen
because the weather was bad.
So instead of a 45 minute flight,
we had to do a 12 hour drive.
So we drove from the
capital all the way up
through these winding roads,
over the river to end up here.
Here to here took 12 hours.
Today, we're driving from here,
from where we are right now,
like Besham, all the
way up here, to Chilas.
This is gonna take another 12 hours.
And then, we're going to drive
all the way up to Hunza Valley.
It's all mountains from
here, all spectacular.
Also, we're gonna see K2,
which is the second highest
mountain in the world.
What?
(upbeat music)
- Say Nankhatai.
- Nankhatai, what is it?
- This is it.
Yeah, that's Nankhatai.
- Nankhatai, okay.
Should I make a commercial?
These are really good,
you should try them.
It's like a mixture between
marshmallow and biscuit.
(upbeat music)
- Okay, so we decided
to hang out on the roof
while we drive through
these beautiful mountains.
There's no seat belts on the
roof, that's part of the fun.
- Honk it, honk it, honk it, honk it.
- Sorry.
- What highway are we on?
- Karakorum Highway.
- And is this a safe highway?
- Yeah, I guess, yeah it's pretty safe.
- But there were a lot of deaths.
- Yes, so when they
were making the highway,
812 Pakistanis and about 140 Chinese died.
- Wow.
- Yeah, so that's pretty bad.
But, it's safe, yeah,
it's safe for travel,
but yeah, there's landsliding,
so let's hope that doesn't happen. Hello!
- So, possibility of landslides,
possibility of rocks falling,
possibility of us falling.
- Possibility of cameras falling.
- Cameras falling.
- Cameras, that's the worst.
- Risk is high.
- Risk is very high.
(upbeat music)
(group cheering)
- Yeah, this is awesome.
- Yeah?
- I love it, I love things
that are a little dangerous.
Things that like get
your heart pumping a bit.
Because these are the
stories you remember, right?
- Yeah.
- The time you were on the rooftop.
- On the Karakorum Highway.
- On the Karakorum Highway.
- I've never done this, and
I've been here many times.
- Yes.
(upbeat music)
Okay, so we've been driving
for three or four hours,
just through the mountains nonstop.
And it's just been
breathtaking, like spectacular.
When I came out, and
there's this huge waterfall
behind me, I have goosebumps.
Like I literally got goosebumps
just seeing it for the first time.
And moments like that
are why I love traveling,
seeing something so spectacular
that you get chills, right.
- (child yells)
- (man speaks in foreign language)
- Is this it?
- Yeah.
- Okay, so we have been
stranded on this road
for five hours, we've literally traveled
maybe two or three
kilometers in five hours.
We've been stuck because of landslides,
and multiple landslides, so
they had to get them cleared.
But it's been a slow, slow
creep through these mountains,
and we still have like
another, I don't know,
six, seven hours ahead of us.
And we have barely had any food.
We had some cucumbers and watermelon.
- (man speaks in foreign language)
- (child speaks in foreign language)
- (man speaks in foreign language)
- How's the lunch?
- Lunch is fresh, but there's
no restaurants around,
there's barely any water,
we're not gonna make it guys,
we're not gonna make it.
But luckily, we bought some
cucumbers from a guy driving by,
so this is lunch, and it's not bad.
We stayed at high spirits,
which is most important.
Whoa.
The views have been so spectacular though.
(serene music)
- (man speaks in foreign language)
- That was delicious.
- We're ready.
- Great, all right.
- The adventure continues.
- Onward we go.
- What an adventure this
trip has been so far.
- No one could have predicted
what was gonna happen.
Flight getting canceled, landslides,
being stuck on the side of
the road for like five hours.
It's just been non-stop adventure.
And real, like raw, raw adventure.
That's what we experienced in Pakistan.
And the next video is
just gonna get crazier.
We drive these Jeeps on
the side of a mountian
next to a cliff, it's
like the most dangerous
highway in the world.
And I can't wait to show you guys.
There's just incredible footage,
there's incredible sights,
we go like hiking up a mountain
and we go camping on the mountain.
Aw man, so much adventure ahead.
Okay, stay tuned, next video is coming.
