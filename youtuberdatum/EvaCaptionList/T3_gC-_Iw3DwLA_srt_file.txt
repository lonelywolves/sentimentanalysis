have been dealing with a bed bug
infestation
how the heck do you train for an
ultramarathon i've been thinking about
my channel
and the future of travel vlogging for me
let's do this
it's day three day three
of trying to make this vlog i've been
feeling so
uninspired i mean so uninspired that
over the last three days i've just been
staring blankly at the camera
unable to say anything so finally
after three days i remembered that
inspiration is
totally overrated and that if you're a
creative
you can't rely on inspiration to just
drop down on you from heaven
blessing you with words and ideas
no actually most of the time you just
have to learn to rely on discipline
good old discipline so that's
what i'm doing here in the osambara
mountains in tanzania
learning again to rely on discipline
over the last week we've been staying in
this beautiful little hotel called mambo
view point which
literally sits on top of a mountain on
the side of a cliff it's actually
quite unbelievable and i don't really
want to leave and i'd
love to show you around i'd love to show
you inside
but we've had a little problem here
there's mike with his drones and this
is part of our problem so you're gonna
have to excuse the mess but over the
last week that we've been here we have
been dealing
with a bedbug infestation
and no it's not what you think it is
this place is really really nice and we
didn't pick them up here at
all in fact we picked them up on our
trek last week you know that last video
that i made about
trekking in maasai villages yeah that's
where we got them i guess part of living
remotely for the maasai
people is that they have to deal with
various kinds of parasites and
travelers like us sometimes unknowingly
end up picking them up and
tagging them along so it hasn't been
particularly pleasant
and although it's the first time that
i've picked anything like that up on my
travels
my body hasn't really reacted very well
here's what my
feet looked like just three days ago and
here's what they look like
now after being covered with
antihistamine cream and after i took
some anti-allergy medication and here's
what my shoulders looked like
three days ago and literally my entire
back was covered with
bites and redness like that and here is
my hand right now much much better than
a few days ago but
that's a tattoo that's a whole different
story that i still need to update you on
and that is coming at the end of the
vlog but the tattoo is quite
quite big it's like this big
all right on to my next subject
of conversation now let's talk about
running
250 kilometers that's 150 miles
i didn't actually think that that was
humanly possible to run that kind of
distance
yet a few weeks ago i signed up to run
an ultra marathon of exactly
that length so i want to tell you about
how the heck
do you train for an ultramarathon and
just when you thought that running 250
kilometers sounds
crazy wait till you hear this in your
training
at no point do you run that kind of
distance
not even like a quarter of that distance
so it's actually
really only on race day that you get to
find out
what it's like to run 250 kilometers and
whether you're even
capable of it this
is nor nor has a broken jaw
some really crappy human smashed it some
years ago
no she's been adopted she's quite happy
and she usually comes running with me
you gonna come today
hey
[Laughter]
i think she's coming
[Music]
i've been running five to six times a
week
between 10 and 15 kilometers per
and even with that training i already
feel my life changing
i've had to reset my priorities change
my travel plans
to fit my training schedule but i also
get less stressed
and i'm much stronger than i was i can
keep going for much longer
and that's amazingly rewarding here's a
village
all right all right all right
all right bye the downside is that in
this tiny little village of a
mountaintop in tanzania
i think people have started to see me as
the weird
white girl from zungu who goes running
every day
with their local dogs it's true
coming back from iran always feels
incredible but going for a run
that's a whole other story even with
this lofty goal in mind even given the
fact that i
love running it can still be extremely
excruciatingly difficult
to motivate myself to go out for a round
because i'm just too lazy sometimes
sometimes i just can't be bothered
but you know what i think with running
it's a bit like with this magical thing
we call inspiration
you can't rely on being inspired or
being motivated all the time
to do the things that you should do or
the things that you want to do
sometimes you just need to work on
discipline
and habit and simply doing things even
when you don't feel like them
if they're good for you that is my
running philosophy
so obviously with this new shift in
focus
in what i do in my life because running
has really changed
the way that i live and prioritize my
travels i've been thinking about
my channel and the future of travel
vlogging for me
and whether travel vlogging per se is
really something that i want to be doing
for the rest of
my career here on youtube or whether i
want to change things up a little bit
and i'm still processing that so i'll
get back to you
in a few minutes
[Music]
yeah you guessed it right we're just
about to leave this beautiful slice of
paradise
and oh all the doggos along with it this
is banan
he she i think she is pretty substantial
in size and i'll miss them all hey
more and
[Music]
all right so ahead of us is a nine hour
drive to
arusha our next destination
[Music]
no more
just arrived in arusha but this is not
the end of the journey in fact
the journey continues for another eight
hours tomorrow to an incredibly special
place
so i'll see you in the morning
good morning it's a beautiful morning
here in tanzania and i'm just off to run
a small
errand right there after running around
town for a little while i finally found
myself here in this
little room in a private hospital in
arusha waiting for my coping test
let's do this
[Music]
we've been driving for the last four
hours and finally
we're taking a quick lunch break
sorry man calls this a lunch in the bush
is that right solid lunch in the bush
lunch so what do we have here we have a
veg box nice guys this is the key to my
next update my next big life update
veggie box
yes i've gone vegetarian i went
vegetarian about eight
months ago for environmental and ethical
reasons i mean i
love animals and i realize that i just i
can't eat my friends
and also the environment suffers because
of animal agriculture and i felt like i
just can't participate in that
so over the last few months as i've been
traveling through europe and various
other places i literally never had any
trouble
saying no to hosts or participating in
local life just because i'm veggie and
on that note
this is chips my eye tanzania's favorite
street side snack basically
chunks of potato dipped in egg omelet
it's delicious do we have some guests
hello you know it's never boring in the
bush we were just having a very casual
lunch and then we were joined by these
three gentlemen and then this entire
herd of
cows with a couple of maasai shepherds
[Music]
along
i'm here in this massage village in the
heart of tanzania
spending a couple of days with a friend
of mine called stephanie
who has invited me over to film a video
about
masai marriage which should be the next
episode on this channel
but for now i wanted to talk to you
about the end of
travel vlogging for me why are you
laughing it's not funny
i think it's funny you think it's funny
you think it's funny
this is a calabash this is a masai milk
container so when women here in the
village
milk the cows they milk them straight
into
the calabash inside it's very very smoky
they actually
smoke it out with fire so all the milk
that you drink in massive villages is
likely to have
a very smoky aftertaste but that's not
why i'm here
i'm here because i was gonna talk to you
about the end of travel vlogging i've
been in the space
travel vlogging for the last three years
i've been making videos about my travels
on youtube obviously in that time my
style of storytelling has
evolved a lot and i've i've been
learning a lot and i've been realizing
that
a lot of the things i used to say a lot
of the situations i used to portray
i would never express them in that way
anymore i feel like they were
i was being simplistic in my narrative
of the world
and i hope that that's been changing and
evolving and i hope that
with every new vlog or video that i make
in the future
it will continue to evolve because see
travel vloggers i believe
have a very big responsibility
and i didn't realize this until quite
recently until about a year ago
travel vloggers have a responsibility
because they are often
our window to the rest of the world you
know we watch travel vloggers because we
like to see
their natural interactions like this one
the people around them there you go take
it take it
as opposed to a journalist's view on the
world which of course is going to be
focused on slightly different kinds of
issues so we trust travel vloggers
but at the same time as a travel vlogger
with now a really big audience
i feel like i have a bigger
responsibility than ever
to tell stories in
good and bad ways no to tell the good
and the bad
of every story and that's actually much
much harder than you might suspect
so here is my statement going forward i
want to bring you
videos that are more than just travel
vlogs i want to bring you videos that
are thought provoking that are
eye-opening
that hopefully give you new perspectives
videos that stand at the crossroads
between casual
fun vlogs and documentaries of course
i'll probably still make fun casual
travel vlogs here and there
because why not but i'm feeling an
increasing sense of responsibility
and i'm also feeling that travel vlogs
just on their own
at this level and at this size are no
longer
quite enough i just got a makeover from
claudia
thank you very much thank you thank you
thank you
with the coronavirus pandemic tourism
has been put on hold
but soon enough is going to start again
and i hope
that when it starts again it undergoes
some fundamental changes i really hope
that we start traveling
more slowly
i really hope that we start traveling
more slowly more deeply
in more conscious and mindful
ways and i
want to be there to take you on
slower more mindful journeys
through my travel vlogs because i'd love
to pave the way
towards a better more sustainable
more mindful kind of travel
for the entire world in the future and
there is one more thing i promised to
show you in this video which is
my new tattoo which is quite big i like
it
so let me tell you about this tattoo
it's a pretty big one
and there's a lot of symbols which maybe
i won't explain all of them
but just so you know this here in the
center
is the dragon blood tree a memory from
my time in socotra island in yemen
during
the loch coronavirus lockdown earlier
this year
the roots of the tree are connected to
the universe because after all we're all
connected
here we've got the mountains because as
you know i love being in the mountains
they're like my spirit animal
and here this heart we spent a lot of
time with the tattoo artist
thinking of the true symbol of the
traveler and we realized that the true
symbol of the traveler
it may be the compass or it may be the
suitcase but actually it's the heart
because you
follow your heart as you travel there's
a few words in here as well
be to be to be in the moment to be
present
feel to feel every moment and to tune
into
your heart and feelings and here i am
the storm
whatever happens in my life i
am i guess i have the power to keep
going
the power to withstand anything
and with this beautiful audience around
me i bid you all
goodbye and i'll see you in the next
video right here
from this village called lesoids in
[Music]
tanzania
you
