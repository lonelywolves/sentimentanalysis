this vlog is all about the amazing
people i got to meet in an eastern
european village
in a remote corner of romania in this
episode i meet local ladies who try to
teach me to cook romanian style
and dress me up as well as a local
celebrity
as they say in romanian merjem let's go
hey ava here today i'm gonna tell you
a secret something i actually haven't
shared with anybody before
was born and raised in a small town in
poland
and no that's not the secret when i was
seven or eight
my mom and i moved away from that town
and for the longest time
i wouldn't admit to anybody that i came
from that tiny little
polish town i would always say i'm from
a city
it's like i was scared that people would
judge me for not being
urban or cosmopolitan or sophisticated
enough because i was just a small town
girl
but the older i get the more i realized
that
i actually crave the country life and
the more i travel around the world the
more i realize that people who live in
villages and
small towns around the world have
something that people living in cities
really do not have
for a week i made myself a cozy nest
in the village hotel in a tiny little
village called
breb in rural romania during my time
here i want to meet with some of the
people that make this village so special
and find out about the secret of what
makes village life so appealing
[Music]
do
we're just about to arrive at eureka's
place this is the lady who's going to be
teaching
me how to cook traditional romanian food
all right here we are at eureka's place
in eureka's kitchen what are we going to
be cooking today what's
next
let's do it
[Music]
we bring some onion okay
[Music]
oh wow we went on a very quick mission
to find some onions but
the crazy thing that we found here are
these cheeses
amazing so we've got a big massive bag
of
sack of cheese kind of draining and the
liquid is seeping out into
this pot on the ground here all right
we're just about to take part
in a very important cultural ceremony
here in
a village in maramores which is
it's a magic liquid super tasty and
really dangerous
it's called affinate here we have two
very important elements
of local life here in the village this
is horinka
and this is afinata they're both very
very strong lickers
locally made homemade everybody makes
their own
at home now i don't think i can drink
them both but
thank god we're so busy enjoying uh the
local delicacies that we almost forgot
to cook
let's get back into it
[Music]
if you don't have salmani in the house
on a sunday that means the family is
really
hungry
[Music]
so now the
[Music]
eureka's nephew just swung by the
kitchen asking her if he can borrow the
horses to do some work
so i'm gonna see oh my god
[Music]
hello
this is the village live here in rural
romania
[Music]
grandma if you're watching this uh i'm
sorry
so we take a leaf a cabbage leaf
all right here we go put it in your hand
in the palm of your hand
then grab yourself a nice big spoon of
this stuffing exactly
fold it in fold it in fold it in
uh-huh keep folding no no
no no okay fold it like that
this side and then
in oh my god guys the rolling process is
really difficult
okay or simple depends on if you have
eureka or ava
here is the thing every single cabbage
leaf has its very own
shape which means that every single
stuffing session is going to be a little
bit different
this is why you leave it to the pros
[Music]
you know here's one funny thing that i
can tell you as an eastern european so i
was born in poland and we have a very
similar dish in poland called gowampiki
it's also basically cabbage leaves
stuffed with
some sort of filling and it's funny
because in mediterranean countries like
in italy or in turkey or in lebanon what
you get a lot is these like
really fancy grape vine leaves with
stuffing
and they're really sort of stylish and
elegant little bites but
in eastern europe we don't really have
grape vine leaves
at least not in poland so we make a
similar dish
but with cabbage eureka has just put the
samala on the stove to cook for a little
while and
in the meantime while we wait we're
gonna go on another
special little mission oh
this is a special room
[Music]
camera what does that mean room for
holidays
person in bread has a room like this all
nicely decorated
and they always keep it for special
occasions they never sleep here they
never do nothing here
wow only for special occasions and it's
stunning it's so beautiful
oh my gosh it's so beautiful
[Music]
look at this so beautiful so
the skirt is sumner and this is blues
oh my god this is all handmade
this is a typical maramura shirt and a
typical
flower skirt and one last
touch but ah there we go oh
that's so cool i was asking vio earlier
why women in some of these villages here
in romania
continue to wear the scarf it's not very
common in europe
and she said it's just part of tradition
and of course it looks pretty cute
that means i'm a girl from maramures so
this is the traditional coat collection
made from sheep's hair and it's
extremely warm these coats weigh like
five kilograms each so it's serious
stuff
[Music]
you know it's funny because in most
parts of the world if you
like go to church if you're religious
you just kind of go to church in
your everyday clothes but here you know
people
truly dress up they wear their most
special
dresses and blouses and coats because
they're going for a meeting with god
right that's the idea you're not just
going to see your friends or your family
you're going to a really special place
and
this tradition is really disappearing
all over the world but it's still
very much very much alive here in
romania
[Music]
wow oh my gosh let's go i'll see it is
finally ready
[Music]
the first the placenta
all right here is the fruit of all of
our hard work actually not my hard work
vios hard work sarmale filled with rice
paprika mushrooms and other kinds of
vegetables
home made cream oh my gosh
as thick as it gets to complete the dish
you've got some pie
oh chinta amazing placinta and sarmale
all right it's time to try i'm ready
oh my gosh it's so good they're so soft
and delicious such a gentle flavor
oh look at this this is amazing
and it's still warm and crispy on the
outside and soft on the inside and
creamy and cheesy on the inside
oh i'm in food heaven merely
missing from me she wishes you the best
of her good luck
and health and yourself
thank you
vo's cooking session was my introduction
into village life but there is so much
more to come i was really looking
forward to meeting the next lady that
andrea and i
had been invited to visit
i'm here in bread today with andra and
pusha
hey and we're all a little bit moody and
gloomy today because it's been raining
for the last few days but we're about to
see how a village lady
from breb makes bread
hello this is going to be a fun
the moment that we arrived in lenoxon's
kitchen she was already
preparing the bread all this flour is
enough to make
four or five big big loaves of bread in
a traditional brick oven so
how did you learn how to make bread
from her grandmother
[Music]
[Music]
she would never ask about how much money
one person has
so it's pointless to be greedy lenita
has just sent
us out for a mission we're gonna go into
her
vegetable plot and we're gonna pick up
some apples apples for the pies that
she's going to make for us
no pesticides nothing like that just
pure and
natural apples that have just fallen
from the tree
[Music]
that's the next step of our culinary
journey today
slicing up the apples
[Music]
[Music]
this is hyper natural
apple juice and as lenses says our
reward for peeling
and grating the apples oh it's so
[Music]
delicious
lenota has just lit the fire right here
in the oven and this
is the fire that's going to bake our
bread very very soon yes i know you're
very hungry yes yes yes
maybe you'll get some
that's huge wow
the dough in the meantime has really
grown quite a bit in fact it's like
flowing
out of the pot
than say but if you have something bad
to say to a person then keep it for
yourself
[Music]
it's my turn to try and make a pie okay
like this so we've got our flour base
and then we grab some of the dough
this is amazing i know it looks like
cheese it's not
okay i start rolling this one no
okay and now i can roll it great
the shape yeah
[Music]
nothing is perfectly round everything is
a bit
well said so it has to be really flat
around the edges
so basically what laminster is doing is
she's adding a bit more weight
and a bit more strength this is my
favorite part adding in the cheese this
is the easy part
this is where you take the sides
okay so one by one corner by corner
each one sticking in the exact same way
okay okay voila
and then you put your belly
and here it is
here's a placenta cubrinza fresh from
the frying pan
oh my god super soft on the inside with
a crispy edge right here
oh wow
by the way this is the car that i came
to romania in
it's a 17 year old ford focus that i
bought in poland
for fifteen hundred dollars that i
called stefan
still serving me pretty well
there was one person that everybody told
me to visit
a local celebrity a man of great renown
an artist working in a local village of
global fame
this is our spot right here the arts and
crafts
guest house
[Music]
hi i've just arrived here
at daniels atelier he also runs a guest
house here
and i see that he's busy teaching
someone
ceramics we're about to go into dan's
atelier his
studio where he creates all of his
really really famous works of art so i'm
going to hand it over to him
[Music]
[Music]
from
[Music]
my portrait actually a couple of days
ago i came here to see dan and he was
just
working on this self-portrait wow
dan is a real artist he creates
everything from sort of like
useful pottery to these beautiful
figurative works that are just so
symbolic and
haunting this is the shop where you can
actually come and
buy some of his work so beautiful i am
definitely coming out of here with at
least one piece this is
gorgeous you know walking through this
actually you really
feel a sense of local culture
that's it all right dan is going to show
us how he
makes some of his famous sculptures so
we're right here in his garden
and i guess we're going to see something
made from scratch
wow first of all i didn't realize that
being a ceramicist
for in order to be a ceramicist you need
quite so much energy
wow
[Music]
you know it's amazing because he
literally took
a lump of clay and is forming it into
a beautiful object that someone will buy
and
take home and have forever ultimately
that's what creation is all about it's
about making something out of
nothing oh my god
wow
and it's gone again apparently it's my
turn to make something out of nothing
right water yes
okay upper water
and like this oh oh my god this feels so
cool it's like the smoothest
thing i've ever touched it's beautiful
water
okay i think i need to focus fingers
inside
to create a little hole easy
[Music]
oh like this okay so now it's trying to
create
a shape a bowl i think yeah this is the
gentle touch
down down down down
this is amazing you know what working
with clay is so beautiful because
oh wow now my task is to create a little
pattern inside of the play
wow
[Music]
amazing i'm just thankful
thank you all right like this
very very good it's good yeah really
oh look at that i made this dan just
said something that really struck a
chord with me
that clay making and poetry is like
therapy
and you know touching that beautiful
piece of clay and making something out
of nothing really feels like therapy
i guess that's the role of art somehow
unexpectedly i've just been invited
for lunch here at dan and dana's place
and here we have a beautiful table
full of traditional homemade food
this is this is uh whiskey and malamute
it is uh just after noon uh on a friday
though
rock rock nostrovia
i think this is a dj's thief which
basically means that um
all these vegetables the mushrooms
everything that you see here on this
table is
organic and natural and a lot of it
comes from the village itself
which is amazing i mean this is true
like
farm to table food it's so rare
these days
[Music]
so i think i found it the thing that
makes village life so special
and here i think is the secret
people who live in villages unlike
people who live in cities
are not just anonymous bodies out there
on the street
if you live in a village then you're
part of a very tight-knit community
a community where everybody plays a role
so whatever work it is that you do
you have an identity you contribute
towards the community
in some way and your life and your work
have a visible
purpose in a city can be really
difficult to feel like your life and
your work makes
any dot of difference and it can be
really hard to find
your tribe your community
human beings are social creatures and as
much as we think that we find company
and entertainment on the internet
it's really the offline interactions
that i think make the greatest
difference if you've ever wanted to live
in a village away from the
chaos of the urban sprawl i totally get
you and i know it's not an easy decision
but
remember the world belongs to the brave
follow your heart and if you enjoyed
