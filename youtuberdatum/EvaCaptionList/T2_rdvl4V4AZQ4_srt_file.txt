[Music]
camping for me it's one of life's
greatest pleasures
i've camped in a lot of incredible
places around the world from beaches to
mountains
and i've camped alone more times than i
can count
but there is one challenge still waiting
for me because you see
i've never camped alone in the forest
well until today
hey
[Music]
hey like i feel my heart racing
i feel scared
[Music]
i just heard some steps in the bushes
like there's something about forests
that makes us feel small and vulnerable
we call forests creepy or scary
well i decided to spend the night in the
forest all by myself
to see what it would really be like but
there's
one more thing before we dive into that
adventure and trust me it didn't go
quite as smoothly as i had hoped i'm
really excited to say that for this
video i've partnered up with dji
to test out their new and upgraded
gimbal camera
the pocket 2. i've been a massive dji
fan for years and i use their products
on a daily basis i filmed a lot of this
vlog
on the pocket too so you'll be able to
see the results for yourselves but
here are three three of my favorite
features
the camera itself is light tiny and
ultra portable which means that you can
bring it on
pretty much any adventure without
sacrificing space
and with the hdr video quality being so
high
i would definitely consider bringing the
pocket too on like a minimalist
adventure
instead of a bigger and heavier camera
the motion lapse feature is
insanely cool i had actually never
really been able to integrate motion
lapses into my videos before because
they just require
so much know-how and equipment but
with the pocket too it literally takes
like a tap on the screen
and your motion lapse is ready to go and
then there is the sound
i had always been underwhelmed by the
sound quality
of smaller cameras but the pocket 2 has
something called the dji
matrix stereo i know it's a bit of a
mouthful
but what it basically means is that it's
capturing sound using all these
microphones placed all around the sides
from various different directions
including background sound
and it reduces wind noise and it even
enhances sound as you
zoom into the video while you're filming
other cool features
include a great tracking tool called the
active track 3.0
which basically focuses on and follows
even
fast-moving objects like people or pets
and with the 3-axis
mechanical gimbal your footage will
always come out really nice and smooth
and stabilized
and there's also the app dji mimo which
allows you to create
small and shareable little clips using
its ai editor
a massive thank you to dji for
supporting this video and
let's dive into the solo camping
[Music]
adventure
oh yeah one other very important thing
pepper gel is basically
bear spray all right well i'm about to
leave the comfort of this lovely hotel
room behind and go and sleep on the
forest floor
i see sometimes i don't know why i come
up with these challenges
but there's some great news and it's
right here in this little bag
yesterday we found some wild mushrooms
these are called
slippery jacks and this is amazing news
because it means that tonight
we can cook these right there in the
forest
[Music]
so i'm currently driving down this
pretty bumpy
super steep mountain road um but this is
the forest and i'm gonna
be camping tonight it's about an hour
away from the city
and just driving around trying to find a
good spot
what you doing mike eating lunch
what's that on your sleeve
lunch it looks like we may have just
found the right spot
which is this forest right here
check this out
[Music]
they're home for the night honestly i'm
getting a little bit nervous seeing it
it's so
huge and serious looking
[Music]
oh
[Music]
i'm here with mike today he's helping me
film some bits and pieces and get set up
and everything
how do you feel about this have you ever
spent the night alone in there i have
so i am the resident expert but tonight
you're gonna be all by yourself
i know you think i can do it yeah of
course watch out for the bears
what all right there's our
spot it looks absolutely perfect so
we're gonna put the tent
somewhere there so we also have space
for a fire
we're gonna move these logs around so
that we have natural seating
and we're gonna put on a time lapse so
that you can see the entire process and
if we mess something up
oh i guess we'll see that too let's do
it
[Music]
all right we're all set up and ready to
go the
firewood is ready the tent is ready so i
think we should stop cooking those
mushrooms
let's do it
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
so far so good i'm just keeping myself
busy here with the cooking
and it's beautiful out here but i'm also
painfully aware
that in just a couple of hours when it
gets dark
mike is going to leave and i'll be here
all alone
in the dark with hopefully the remains
of this fire
and that's the real test for now let's
just focus on the food
[Music]
wow what have we got here some black
truffle
we picked with some roma people a couple
days ago
wow and this is the kind of luxury that
you honestly
never get while camping but here in this
forest there's plenty of mushrooms and
truffles
so we're gonna add some truffles to our
pasta
and our wild mushroom sauce
oh it's bubbling up almost ready
[Music]
oh my god this looks absolutely divine
wild mushrooms cream garlic
onions truffles all cooked over a fire
in the woods dill these are truffles
and of course grana padano
what i'm gonna do with the cheese is i'm
gonna slice it into these tiny little
slivers so the cheese just
melts right into the sauce
[Music]
ready three two one
all right let's try it
um good eh
success what's what's like the the thing
that's the most dangerous dangerous
thing in the woods that i
should be aware of tell me tell me
honestly
the main thing is exposure like
hypothermia getting too cold
that's a real thing it's a big problem
that no one really thinks about so
making sure
you're well prepared before you go in
and having something to sleep on because
the ground is actually really cold
and can suck your heat away that's
that's the big thing and with animals
i like the most scary dangerous animal
in the world is us
yeah and every other animal doesn't
really want to be around us so as long
as we keep your food away or we don't
have any open food
you don't i'm out of here and if you
want to walk around or if you hear
anything to make a noise
so you have to decide what noise you're
going to make like
yeah that works or like
sing some 90s pop song or speak in
polish
that one's scary stick with that one got
everything yeah i think so
do you realize the amount of people who
are going to get mad at me for leaving
you in the middle of the woods by
yourself
guys i'm okay this was my idea
all right i'll see you in about 12 hours
yeah all right eight o'clock or so
yeah let's do it wish me a good night
have a great sleep
you know if he goes
back to civilization have fun sleeping
in a comfortable bed tonight
night good night
[Music]
so i guess this is it
my night roasting marshmallows over the
fire
in a forest solo
i don't know why it's such a scary thing
to be alone in the forest i think we
just
tell so many scary stories around the
forest that it becomes like almost a
reality and
i'm feeling a little bit nervous i know
i shouldn't be
[Music]
but this is the way to fight those fears
you know
to actually dive into them head-on
and see that there's nothing to be
scared of
so i guess i'm just gonna sit here and
roast my marshmallows for a little while
[Music]
go go
go go just in case
oh my god look at that look at
this guy amazing amazing amazing
simple things
you know it's so funny because when
you're in a forest
alone like this yours your mind kind of
starts to race it starts to kind of like
try and
look out for signs of danger so you
start to like really tune into it
i feel my mind really tuning into every
single sound that i hear in the distance
and thinking like oh my god that's a
scary sound
obviously like i'm like like i feel my
heart racing
i feel scared even though i know i
shouldn't be
go go
[Music]
hey
hey
and of course i could count on mike to
send me an obnoxious picture
of him in a nice comfortable bed in the
hotel
i think this is a good sign but i should
probably go to bed soon
i'm gonna wait for the fire to die out
make sure that it's properly
extinguished
and then i'm gonna head inside and
honestly i have no idea what to expect
i don't know if i'll be able to fall
asleep straight away or if i'll just
lay awake for hours listening to every
single sound
around me i have no clue see
[Music]
[Music]
ready
it's getting really really cold
well i'm really glad that i brought my
super thick socks from
mongolia camouflage socks i'm really
glad that i brought my big sleeping bag
and of course my little woolen hat from
nepal
it's still pretty chilly though but um
yeah i'm a little bit less nervous being
inside my tent
because i can't see all the trees and
all the space around me i guess
this is like my little comfort zone um
so i hope that i can fall asleep soon
i'm still hearing so many sounds and i
get anxious every time
i hear a dog barking in the distance
because i'm like ah isn't a wolf
obviously it's not a wolf with a dog and
even if it wasn't what we probably
wouldn't
come here and bother me so yeah
let's see i'm gonna read for a little
bit and then try and
get to sleep and hopefully not stress
too much
[Music]
i just heard some steps in the bushes
like twigs cracking
either someone or an animal in the
forest nearby
what's going on
it's getting a little bit late so i
think it's time to go to sleep
you know hearing all these little noises
and sounds and twigs breaking
all around my tent it feels scary at
first but then
i kind of realized that it's mostly just
small animals like mice or
rabbits you know and i think
that helps with the stress levels
anyway wish me a peaceful night
and see you in the morning
okay i'm just about to arrive back
where i dropped off eva last night it's
been
oh it's been a bit over 12 hours
actually since i did so
and we were able to chat a little bit
last night on dms but then the
the connection cut out and so i haven't
heard from her so i hope she's okay
she's okay
but i mean it's hard not to worry
sometimes even
you know even if i know she's okay let's
go find her
marco
kaka
[Music]
kaka
[Music]
[Music]
hot chocolate in the morning
in the forest still alone
hey there
how was it
you're alive how was it
really cold really cold wow
it is freezing out here yeah yay
mission complete
[Laughter]
hey again and welcome to a very
different kind of setting
i'm back in a very comfortable apartment
now sleeping alone in a forest may not
seem like the greatest challenge ever
but for me personally it was
a fear that i wanted to overcome and i
do think that part of the human
experience is all about challenging
ourselves and
pushing ourselves beyond our limits the
world belongs to the brave after all
doesn't it once again a massive thank
you to dji for partnering up with me
on this video and i hope that you all
enjoyed this vlog and that
inspires you to try out some of your own
little or big adventures see you all in
the next vlog
