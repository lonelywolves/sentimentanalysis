[Music]
this is jamalabad
a small village in the mountains of
pakistan it's home to a few families
from the wahi community
an ethnic group scattered across these
lands
a lucky coincidence brought me close to
one of these families
and they invited me to attend and
document their eldest son's wedding
but first we had a mission to complete i
accompanied said
one of the youngest sons on a wedding
invitation run
sayad so what are we doing here we are
here to invite our relatives in fave's
wedding
[Music]
no it's not easy in culture it's
basically kind of impolite to call
someone
to invite them to your wedding you have
to send a relative
a family member in person to your family
members homes
in the other towns and villages and
invite them personally
now we don't always know the exact
address
of a family or a home in a village so we
literally
are walking around some of the villages
and asking people
do you know this guy do you know that
guy where does he live where do we go
and that's how we manage
and trust me not every village was easy
to get to
oh my god i did it we did a break
our invitation run took us far and wide
into many villages and valleys in the
area
and then disaster struck of course
something like this had to happen
on our errands and invitations around
flat tire my very first puncture in my
life
i'm gonna take it as a sign of good luck
okay
it looks like this progress being made
we're fixing something this is the spare
tire
which looks really tiny to me and here
we are starting to lift the car
how exciting and back on track we had so
many more invitations to give out
we found out that kumaris is somewhere
over there
keep on driving
apart from a punctured tire all had gone
according to plan
we managed to invite everybody to the
upcoming wedding
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
i forgot to iron my dupatta and knowing
my ironing skills
this will take a while
[Music]
this small kitchen ceremony right here
this actually marks the very start of
the wedding itself
this is where we make seven flatbreads
or shoppies to say welcome
to the wedding
[Music]
all the shoppings that we've been making
over the last 24 hours they have been
scrunched up and now they will go into
making a traditional dish called
chamurky and this dish is shared as a
kind of breakfast
on a couple of days before the wedding
to welcome guests
into the wedding itself
the milk that you see being poured into
bowls here most of this milk has
actually been brought by
guests this is traditionally a way to
say
best wishes to the newlywed couple or
soon to be welcome
[Applause]
the preparations have finally ended
their final stages and now we're
starting to slowly see
a trickle of guests who are coming in to
wish the family
all the best for the wedding yes this is
technically day one of the wedding
but nobody is getting married just yet
today
is a day for the local families to get
together share food and bestow blessings
on the ceremonies to come
[Music]
so it's finally my turn to try the
famous
see how it tastes
it is basically like a very milky smooth
soupy kind of thing with spongebob bread
inside
it's probably good it's a lovely way
here in the ceremony to start the
wedding celebration
at the end of the meal come the prayers
[Music]
it's expected of friends and important
people in the community to give their
blessings and wishes to the family
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
bye
[Music]
so
[Music]
the work on the shepherds has continued
well into the morning
we're on the next day of making lemon
finally it's my chance
to try and make one as well so i'm just
about to start making one of the shapix
one of the
typical local breads that we make for
weddings and that we have been making
for the last
24 hours i believe i don't know how many
have been made
but i estimate about four to five
hundred
okay while i've been trying to make this
one
this lady over here has already made
three i think
grandma see i'm learning like this
yeah okay all right
ava's
imperfect but done
okay now we put it on the stove it's not
a perfect circle
but it's edible good good food
meanwhile outside the men are busy with
a very different kind of towel
[Music]
the cycle of life and death goes on as
the bride prepares for the wedding in
her house
[Music]
[Music]
meanwhile back in the groom's house the
preparations are in the final stages
there's one more very important ceremony
to come
[Music]
throughout the duration of oahu wedding
there's quite a lot of different rites
of passage and different
ceremonies in this particular one which
is called
this one takes place just before the
wedding one day before the wedding
and it takes place at the group's house
there's a separate ceremony at the same
time in the bride's house
this is where both of them get ready and
get dressed for the wedding
and where the initial blessings are
bestowed upon them
[Music]
are you happy and just when you thought
it's all serious blessings and stern
faces
the groom's family lined up a slightly
less formal event
so now that these blessings have been
bestowed and
the official part of the pre-wedding
preparations are done and finished
people start to party in honor of the
happy couple and the lucky people sure
know
how to pass
[Music]
[Applause]
hey that is a power cut
and now we wait let's hope that this
party didn't finish before it began
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
hey
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
finally it arrived the third day of the
celebrations
the day that everybody's been waiting
for today
praveez and parveen finally tie the knot
wahi people have their own language
music poetry and traditions
these drums and trumpets you won't hear
their music anywhere else
only here
my host family explained some of these
traditions to me
the wahi symbol i love the most is the
eagle that soars
high above the palmer mountains
traditional wahi dances
always mirror the movement of the
graceful eagle
[Music]
next step the groom and his entourage
drive over to the bride's village
this is where the marriage will be
sealed formerly in the jamaat khana
the gathering place of ismaili muslims
[Music]
we've just arrived in the village of the
bride gilcha and this is where the groom
and the bride actually get
married formerly in the jamaat
that's just about to happen the new
chapter is about to begin it's so
exciting to see it
[Music]
[Music]
oh wait that's not the kind of music
they play at weddings in pakistan
before we get to the big wedding party
there's just a couple of formalities
that we need to get out of the way
first there's food the newlyweds first
meal together
this dish is called rajuntik and
basically
the sharing of the dish starts with the
bride and groom they first get to try
this smoky soup after them everybody
else in the room
gets a little spoon as well basically
symbolizing
that they get that they're getting a
taste of the love
from the newlyweds
[Music]
too
foreign
[Music]
this is only the beginning we haven't
even arrived at the big party yet
for now the brides village celebrates
the new union
it's all very symbolic today is the day
when praveen leaves her family village
for good
and that's why everybody gathers around
her home to bid her
a bittersweet farewell
[Music]
and just like that a new beginning the
big party will take place in pervase's
family home
let the real celebrations begin
[Music]
[Music]
and we're back the boys managed to fold
up the tent faster than the wind and the
party resumed in
full swing
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
so i think now you can see what wahi
weddings are really like there's a lot
of dancing a lot of music
a lot of pretending that you're an eagle
high up in the palmyra mountains
and a lot of fun and everybody takes
part so
that's what makes it so nice
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
you
