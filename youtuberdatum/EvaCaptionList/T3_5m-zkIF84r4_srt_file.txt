[Music]
i've come to the north of afghanistan to
witness one of the most violent games
known to man
and i'll be learning how to play it too
welcome to mazari sharif this is where
many of the great buskashi tournaments
take place
but today i'm spending the day wandering
down the alleyways of the city's main
bazaar
good morning everybody today i am here
in the bazaar of mazari sharif with my
friend
reza who's taking me around there he is
we're having a little look
at some of the local clothes what people
are selling how people are spending
their days at the bazaar
[Music]
this here is dough so dough is basically
i think it's fermented milk
but it's a very kind of sour kind of
milk that shepherds
it's really really popular in
afghanistan so we're going to try some
of this for the first time here we go
it's so sour it's so fresh oh my god
i'm pretty sure that this ain't with
your digestion
i can taste it
this is olani one of the most popular
street side snacks
in afghanistan i've had fulani i don't
know how many times countless times
because it's one of the few vegetarian
options available
so good perfectly fresh from the tandoor
right here
so so delicious
[Music]
one of the main things that you should
know about afghanistan is that it's
inhabited by
so many different peoples communities
ethnicities and each
one of them has its own set of
traditions even outfits music
language and we're about to try some of
the local
ethnic hats this is an uzbek hat
apparently
from san martin kandahar
here we go
[Music]
we've just come here to a shop that
sells workers and exclusively
blue burkas now you might recognize
these because
in most pictures that you might see of
afghanistan you'll probably see
burka clad women now the burka is a very
important piece of clothing
to afghan women and in afghan
traditional culture
of course not every single woman in
afghanistan wears a burqa
but those that do do it for religious
and cultural reasons it's to cover up to
be
very very modest and i guess in some
interpretations
invisible in the crowd even though i'm
not planning on wearing a burka here in
afghanistan i am actually quite curious
to see what it feels like to
wear one and what it's like to be on the
inside of one
how much does this one cost
uh it's uh 750.
so about ten dollars yes exactly about
ten dollars
mr dowd here is the shopkeeper and he
sells forecasts to women
in need or alternatively lets tourists
try them on
oh my god i can't even find the
beginning
somehow
okay okay here we go this is it
the moment of truth did i put this over
my head
oh my god hurry up
[Music]
oh my god you know what the crazy
the crazy thing is that the burqa
doesn't actually have like um
an opening for your eyes it has only
this net
see this is where you see through
and you don't see very well there's
literally a net in front of your eyes
at all times and it's quite heavy it's
quite big
i can't really imagine wearing this on a
daily basis
and i don't really know how women who do
feel but certainly uh
it's a very traditional piece of
clothing here in afghanistan and you see
it everywhere if you come here
[Applause]
[Music]
all right one more super quick stop we
are at the blue mosque here in malaysia
if
this is probably the most recognizable
symbol
of the season but we have
to go we're in a bit of a rush
[Music]
all right i'm thinking of buying this
scarf it's quite pretty
and yellow and it's traditional to the
northern parts of afghanistan or
in the older place how much is it come
he said 450
but i'm sure that it's the first price
i think 200 is enough for this one 250
is enough for this one
yeah yeah so 250 would be about
three or four dollars yeah i guess all
right let's see if we can bargain this
down
all right i got the scarf the pashmina
that i wanted and now we're about to get
out of this street bazaar
all right so we're off
[Music]
i am here today in afghanistan about to
try something
very very special afghanistan's national
sport and probably the most
dangerous and craziest sport that you've
seen in your life well i'm
here with zara maybe you can tell us a
little bit more about where we are oh
sure hi guys
i'm zahra and we are in northern of
afghanistan this is
one of the most famous districts of
afghanistan his name is tashkorgan
and we have here mr aminola big
he's very famous person in buskashi it
is one of the most famous
sports in afghanistan amazing it's going
to be
a wild day all right let's go and meet
our host
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
a
okay he said if you want to become a
chopandos or a busquishy player you have
to
have practice you have to be brave and
you have to
you must have self-confidence if you
have these three things
you will become a chop and dose
okay you know guys how i always say that
the world belongs to the brave
well this is probably a great
opportunity to test
that sentence right let's go and play
some puskashi
[Music]
welcome to the buskashi field
these are the grounds where we're gonna
where i'm going to be learning how to
play
muskashi and this boy is called
which means red like deep red
quite red i don't know exactly what it
means but he's a beautiful boy
all right let's do this
ready to play no i'm not ready to play i
still have no idea what i'm doing
this baby is so fast and so playful
he just wants to go
[Music]
right now that we've warmed up a little
bit one of the boys is going to
show us some of the basic moves of the
chappandas a buskashi player
i'm really excited for this this the
move of a char pandas
is in the most important one actually
the one that really only counts
is picking up stuff from the ground all
right
how do we do that
he makes it look so easy it's not easy
wow
[Music]
i've got assistance here which i
desperately need
[Music]
[Music]
you can do it
i told you it's not easy it's really not
as easy as it seems
all right this is this is the one
this is the one i can do it
yes after picking up the bowl let's call
it that way
i had to learn how to throw it into a
[Music]
golf
[Music]
again now
finally
amazing this is amazing
as the old saying goes a chappandas
wasn't made in a day
armed with my new appreciation for just
how difficult this sport is
together with reza i headed back to
mazzari sharif to witness a real game of
buskashi
honestly though nothing could have
prepared me for what would come next
okay i'm here at the buskash again it
looks like i'm ready to play
i'm not but i'm gonna go for a quick
little ride all right
okay i think i'm gonna get off because
it's early men here at this game and
it's very much
a men's game so probably not a place for
me
to go on a casual horse ride
[Music]
this is the warm-up this is the moment
where everybody gets to walk around the
grounds with their horses
showing them off that's for sure you can
see how people are trying to sort of
figure out who's who what's what and
which horse is going to win the game
there's so many i feel like this is
going to be a really intense match
okay so here's the thing about buskashi
it's not played with a ball
like most other team games ah muskashi
is played with the headless carcass of a
[Music]
[Music]
goat
[Music]
the goat carcass is up for grabs and the
game begins
if you want any chance of winning you
have to be the first to grab the carcass
and gallop away with it towards the goal
watch the guy with 89 written on his
[Music]
[Music]
shirt
[Music]
that is insanity that is pure insanity
everybody
crowding together with their horses
around
the carcass to start the game
so exciting i remembered what amin
ulabeg had told me about
emotions running really really high at
buskashi matches
garments
[Music]
all right the winner just came over to
claim his prize
[Music]
[Music]
this battle is fierce
[Music]
each time they announced her and some
horse owners and the merchants and
some big persons from government or army
or commanders
okay announce some price maybe it starts
from 10
to 500 maybe sometimes so you can
probably imagine
that in a country like afghanistan where
the daily wage is something around three
or four dollars
winning a hundred or two hundred or five
hundred dollars
for a single goal is a really really big
deal
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
yes
[Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
i'm actually quite curious about the
injuries how often do they take place
and what kinds of injuries do people get
the most of the time when they got off
from the horse when they
during the competition they hit each
other by horse
they got up from the horse and they
could become injured but
it has a regulation and the referee may
be announced about the fall
and stop the game and these are the most
common injuries
and sometimes maybe they mistakenly or
by intention hit each other
we've just announced that i'll be giving
away a thousand afghani to the next
player who manages to put the goat
in the goal
[Music]
so they're announcing that ava from
poland
is giving away a thousand afghani to the
next winner
you know this time because japan does
want to get price from you
the competition is more more tough for
them
look at them
[Music]
my choppa does here
it's a joker
[Music]
this is definitely one of the roughest
sports i've ever seen in my life and
it's rough for the riders because
there's plenty of guys out here with
broken noses and broken knuckles and
fingers
it's just for the horses as well even
though the horses are extremely well
taken
care of you can see that they're strong
and healthy healthy animals
but yeah it's wild it's raw it's a sport
in a very very pure and raw form that
hasn't been changed for
centuries honestly i had mixed feelings
about buskashi when i saw the game in
full swing
i watched the whips and the crashes and
couldn't help but feel bad for the
horses
despite knowing that they only play
sometimes and otherwise enjoy
extraordinary levels of care
my conclusion well at the end of the day
we are merely guests
passing through these lands and i'm not
sure if it's our place to judge another
culture's customs
without really examining our own first
hey
[Music]
you
