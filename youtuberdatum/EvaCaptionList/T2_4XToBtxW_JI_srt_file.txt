over the next two days
i'll be living right here with the
family that lives at this
sheep station here in the mountains of
romania
and of course their canine entourage
[Music]
the next three days turned out to be
full of new experiences
ah a lot of sheep milking see when i do
it it's just like a tiny little stream
traditional cheese making and of course
partying i'm in romania
one of the wildest countries in europe
i'll be spending the next three days
living right here
at a remote sheep station experiencing
the traditional
shepherding lifestyle of my hosts the
petru family
it's just before 6am and this is how a
typical day in their lives
begins
italian espresso
[Applause]
[Music]
so this is proper italian coffee
made on the fire mixed with super fresh
goat's milk from last night's milking
coffee like this every morning please
[Music]
after our first cup of coffee and before
breakfast
we head out to milk the sheep
[Laughter]
this goat has not been taught any tricks
literally he's just trying to fight me
i'm about to see how your nuts the
eldest son in the family milks the sheep
first thing in the morning
and i might try it for myself too
[Music]
much
yes
[Music]
does he think that anybody can do this
[Music]
job
[Music]
[Music]
this process takes place every single
morning and
every single evening without fail
300 sheep that need to be milked twice a
day and look
i mean the guys are milking and walking
over there
in that part of the shed but there's
still so many sheep left
it's like sc of sheep
it's a never-ending job day in day out
but some of us are still very much
learning the ropes
myself included this is my
real test i'm gonna try and milk the
sheep right now next to me is my teacher
all right see how this goes
i have a feeling i'm gonna make an idiot
of myself
but all right okay
cool
all right there we go yeah i did it
that's your notes
that's me just for comparison
what's your notes professional opinion
of my milking skills
[Laughter]
[Music]
all right
[Music]
the reward comes only after the work has
been done
first the frontline workers get their
feed
and then it's out of us
[Music]
this food is as local as it gets
the milk is literally brought from 20
meters away the cheese is made
right here on the spot like the
definition
of farm to table incredible
i can't wait to taste this amazing
cheese
it looks so good
this breakfast is looking incredible but
before i dig in there is one more thing
i need to try
ask for local custom
[Laughter]
but it's definitely got some buzz to it
i think i'll stick to the cheese for
breakfast
[Music]
and here we have our breakfast mamaliga
which is polenta with cheese oh
this looks like breakfast of the
champions
[Music]
league
[Music]
my
after breakfast everybody gets back to
work the men get busy moving the sheep
enclosure to a new spot
anna mows the grass with a scythe the
traditional way
while i follow the eldest son yanuz to
the pasture
with the flock this place is just
beautiful no fences no limits
just nature
[Music]
these dogs are trained to place
themselves
strategically around the herd so that
they're evenly spaced out so that
they're hurting
the sheep as well as protecting them
from wild animals
like wolves
this is what it feels like to be in a
river
of sheep
but we have an exciting day ahead of us
back at the sheep station
first i want to speak to the family's
youngest son mihai
do you like to live here
[Applause]
for now though we just filled our day
with crushing hazelnuts and collecting
berries and
my favorite part making local artisan
cheese
so what's the verdict is it ready
first process
i is anna how she feels about mihai not
wanting to continue the shepherd way of
life
[Music]
[Music]
how does she get the like the strength
or the motivation
to do it is
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
i get to try the first taste of this new
batch of cheese
brinja
[Music]
here it is freshly made here
in this tuna by anna
um wow this is the freshest cheese
you'll ever try in your life
[Music]
right the petri family
they don't have it easy up here it's a
beautiful place but
it's hard work but you know what every
single person i spoke to today
said to me over and over again if you
love what you do it's easy to do it
every single day
day in day out that's
a beautiful to remember them by
tonight they've invited a bunch of
people from the local village to come
over and have a little party right here
up on the hillside
so i'm really excited to see what that
will look like
we've got the sheep coming into the
[Music]
station
and this is where the hard day's work
for the shepherds
finally ends this is the time that they
actually get to eat
and rest once the sheep are safe and
back at the station
and you know what no weekends here seven
days a week
[Music]
back in the kitchen anna and andrea were
busy preparing dinner for our upcoming
party
[Music]
the magic salt
[Music]
this is traditional mountain gula
straight from the
sheep station served in these beautiful
little bowls
perfect for cold mountain nights
the sheep are nearby oh yeah
all right let's try this
[Music]
wow delicious this is exactly the kind
of meal
that you would imagine a shepherd eating
at the end of
[Music]
so this is an amazing miracle doughnut
it's made here
at the sheep station we call it gogosh
and it's filled with something magical
and creamy and amazing inside you want
to see check it out it's not just the
steam it's the cheese inside it that's
melted
not real check it out
come on have some all right
wow absolutely delicious super
convenient
[Music]
oh
but i totally get this place and i've
lived in a lot of places in the world
i'll tell you
i totally get it
it's a good place for good people and a
good energy
this is existing but it's real it
can raw
as night began to fall i started to
wonder about the wild animals here
what about the wolves the wolves are
coming
really but the dogs will protect us
no that's not true the wolves are not
coming
the army this is the army the army of
dogs
well the army looks a little bit sleepy
to me but i wasn't going to question
their trusted methods
singular enough
while our foot soldiers rested before
taking the night shift
it seemed like the evening was far from
[Music]
over youtube
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
foreign
in florida
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
and this is andra who was with me
at the sheep station we're back here in
the village hotel
in brem it was an amazing experience
living with the petri family wasn't it
it was yeah it really it was i feel like
we learned so much from it
yes i feel charged in the soul yes yes
we're charged our hearts and souls are
challenged
i spoke to all the members of the petru
family independently
but they all told me the same thing if
you love what you do
it's easy to do it here's the thing
people often say that if you love what
you do you'll never
work a day in your life i think that's
completely
not true yes it will be hard work yes
you will work probably
harder than anybody else but every
single day
you'll be getting closer to your goals
and every day will bring you joy
and that's a really beautiful way to
live
but it's a very brave way to live you
