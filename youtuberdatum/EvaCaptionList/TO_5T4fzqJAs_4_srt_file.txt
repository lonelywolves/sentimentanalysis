this is how beautiful the world is this
is how beautiful this island is
everything about being here feels raw
raw in the purest sense of being a part
of me wants to keep this a secret the
island that is beyond all time the
island that breaks all your civilization
of chains
the one that sets you free the one that
makes you feel so wild
this island stole my heart and soul and
I know I'm not the first person
not the last to lose in my heart
[Music]
to its prehistoric wilderness
the story untouched I'm
the dancing waves of the
the theory of the winds that caresses
the elements that for so long have kept
this place and closely guarded
[Music]
welcome to Socotra
