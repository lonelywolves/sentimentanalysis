in a world that's cushioned and
protective
this is a way to experience something
raw and unfiltered
in a society that pressures you into
eternal busyness
this is a way to disconnect and hear
your inner voice
in a life that tends to make you
uncomfortably numb
this is a way to feel alive
and the adventure begins right here in
the town of arusha here in tanzania this
place
is the gateway to mount kilimanjaro and
honestly i can't believe i'm here it's
all happened so fast so
just a few months ago i got a message in
my dms from kelly warrior
a company that operates tricks to
kilimanjaro that's locally owned here
and they invited me to come over and
join one of their treks and
suddenly i'm here and suddenly
tomorrow we start our trek
to the top of africa's tallest mountain
life
how does that happen we were due to
leave civilization behind for nine days
so the day before our trip we came out
to arusha's central market
to get some last minute supplies some of
them
were very local okay i'm here with
joseah
at the local market in arusha and we
have
come to a look at
i would love to get something to help me
climb
the manjaro to have energy and strength
so let's ask what they can recommend
so what should i take this over here
that is a powerful smell
okay well let's see if this special
local hub
helps me limit one of my greatest
challenges yet
when the snake bites you didn't think i
needed the snake anti-venom but there
was one more essential purchase i
definitely had to make
but in addition to the magic route i
think
it's just wise to get some more
conventional
uh energizer kilimanjaro coffee
from tanzania after our little shopping
spree we rushed back to the hotel to
finish packing for our big adventure
okay so mike may have started packing
all this stuff already and he did a
pretty good job you did a pretty good
job
i think i did a pretty good job did i do
a good job
there's nothing there it's all still
smashed up in your bags
right i better start packing currently
this is what i call a creative chaos
hmm the most difficult part is i
don't actually know where to begin i
share my packing tips as well as my
favorite hiking items in another video
you can find the link in the description
box it took a while to arrange it like
that
but all the stuff that you see behind me
is my entire wardrobe for the next
nine days it's not actually that much
but like let's face it i mean
kilimanjaro is not a place
where you're gonna be changing your
clothes every single day so
i'm gonna go and pack all this stuff
away into a duffel bag for the porters
to pick it up tomorrow morning
all right wish me a good last night
before the big hike
here we are at lemosho gate behind me
you can see the outline of what's coming
up over the next few days
i kind of don't want to look at it but a
really really
really important part of the track is
this one uhuru peak that is the summit
and guru means freedom and it's 48
kilometers away
that's quite far the guys that you see
behind me are part of our team
they're the porters they're the guys who
actually carry all of our supplies all
of our food
up the mountain for the next nine days
they are the real
heroes kilimanjaro gives jobs to
thousands of people from the region
porters support staff guides and so on
that's why even if you're strong enough
to carry your own gear
it's good form to hire a porter and
support the local economy in the process
how are you how are you good good good
luis i'm eva eva
nice to meet you so it's a rule
and according to the kilimanjaro portals
association project to make sure we
weigh all our portals back at the
starting point
and the maximum is they should be not
more than 20 kilos for everybody it's
really not an easy job to work as a
porter
but those who work for outfitters
certified by kpap earn fair wages
sometimes even twice as much as a school
teacher in tanzania
their strength and tenacity just wowed
us every single day for the rest of the
trek
good to go good to go ready let's go to
zanzibar
[Laughter]
[Music]
alright here we go the first steps of
our kilimanjaro hike
and behind me is mike with his
watermelon
in order to understand what's happening
here you really have to go and watch his
video
i'm not even gonna bother explaining
here we go
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
we are here we made it day one
done this is camp one well
i'm gonna get changed get some water
have some food
and rest ready
[Music]
ugh
[Music]
it's day two and so far one of my
favorite things about this hike
has been the fact that the landscape
changes all the time
so we've just left that beautiful lush
rainforest and we're about to enter
a much more rugged rough terrain for the
next two days
[Music]
we've just woken up to well probably
the most beautiful view i've seen in my
life outside my tent
here it is
ah this is the coffee i got at the
market today
i'm gonna try this for the first time
this is the masai medicine
that i bought from well the herbal
medicine practitioners
at the same market i'm really curious to
see
what it tastes like but mostly what it
does
oh it's powerful it's pretty strong
they said no more than half a teaspoon
with your morning coffee
and your evening tea here it is
morning coffee infused with maasai
medicine what do you think is going to
happen to me let me try it
anything special well you'll turn masai
obviously obviously
this is meant to make me stronger and
give me more energy
and immunity for the trek so cheers
thumbs up
[Music]
no pretty good even if it doesn't give
me super powers
it's tasty so if only i had known what
would happen later
few steps brought us to a higher
altitude and with the altitude
everything around us changed too
the views the weather the nature
some of the landscapes here are just so
stunning
i mean look at these this beautiful
valley right here
and these rocks behind me it honestly
feels like
something from a movie it's so moody and
duh epic
but the more epic the views became the
worse i started to feel
i'm really not feeling great today all
day today
my body has been trying to flush
something
out of the system you know both ends
it was pretty bad vomiting just now and
we're at 4 000 meters so i really hope
it's not
altitude sickness but i think i know
what it is
[Music]
those herbs that i got at the market
those masai
herbs that's what could have caused
these
side effects and uh
our guides here at kelly warrior agreed
oh my god
[Music]
how are you feeling yes a little bit
better yeah
[Music]
the guides here have been so so helpful
and since i couldn't stomach that
aromatic fragrant rice
they brought me something else which is
just plain bread
and peppermint tea plus a bowl that's
outside in case i need to throw up in
the middle of the night
and i hope that this is where it ends i
really hope that
this is the worst of it and that i wake
up tomorrow feeling better because
i would be devastated i would be
devastated
if i had to end this track
at 4 000 meters the only solution was to
rest and hope that i would feel better
the next day
[Music]
actually i'm feeling really really good
i'm feeling super fresh
super light today i mean after last
night's ordeal
i feel like i'm a newborn we tested my
oxygen levels this morning
and they haven't been higher all along
this trip so maybe maybe
there's something in that massive
medicine that actually helped
i don't know it's hard to put into words
just how relieved i was that i could
actually continue my journey
towards the summit of africa's tallest
[Music]
mountain
me
this is lava tower formed millions of
years ago when kilimanjaro exploded
i couldn't believe we'd be camping here
in fact
let me show you the scam from up close
all right the magic tower oh
oh my god this is
look at all this delicious fresh food
we've got everything to give us energy
yeah
for the trick yeah everyone i talked to
told me that mama luis makes the
best food on the mountain i know i know
they may be biased but
watching him prepare everything from
scratch really made me think that
there's some truth to the rumor
there was also something else i was
really curious about
why do they call you mama louise because
i'm cooking
like a mama like a mama yeah
seeing this food being made by chef
louise makes me so hungry it smells
delicious it's so aromatic and i'm just
i'm just amazed that we're having food
this good at four and a half thousand
meters in altitude
amazing thank you very much all right
the first try of tonight's dinner
wow it's perfect
zanzibar spices
[Music]
i'm getting spoiled out here meanwhile
on the other side of the kitchen tent
[Music]
if you find one literally like now the
leading seat is
spared spade let's say so no matter what
color you put
the spade will be the top number so then
the spades will differ
which one is the highest number on space
not sure if i understood
all the rules but robert did warn me
that this was a complicated game
managed by luis this kitchen tent is a
lot more than just the kitchen
after mama luis makes us some delicious
food in that tent over there which he
does three times a day and sometimes we
even get three courses can you imagine
at this altitude and in these conditions
we then move into the mess stand
and here is kanini yeah who helps us out
with all the food
every single day yes all right
the best food on the mountains yes
everything is
here comes kanini's famous daily
introduction of the dishes
we have super good
and cheese and a green banana a
vegetable sauce
[Music]
taste test oh yeah always
delicious thank you mama louise it's
good whatever
i slept like a baby that night and
we had a pretty amazing surprise
awaiting us the next morning
foreign
[Applause]
[Applause]
so this is absolutely incredible the
killer warrior crew
and the entire team they have their own
dance their own songs
that they perform on every single track
for extra motivation and inspiration
just before
the summit and i'm just so excited that
we got a chance to witness it it was so
so cool
and it makes you feel like you can
conquer any
mountain any mountain yeah actually
these are the maasai traditional songs
and
summer the swahili songs and all the
songs are the solidarity songs of the
what you're gonna do and so like skip
everybody courage and give everybody
power that's we can do it
today we're setting off on our very
first proper
acclimatization hike what does that
actually mean that sounds really
technical i know
basically being at this altitude is
pretty unnatural for the human body i
mean four and a half thousand meters
so that means that we need to give our
bodies a little bit of time to adjust
to such an environment so that we don't
get headaches nausea or
altitude sickness which is a really
serious problem among mountaineers
so acclimatizing means
going up to that ridge that's where
we're going to be going today
a few hundred meters above our current
camp position
and then we're gonna be coming back down
to this camp and sleeping here
mountaineers often say hi kai sleep
[Music]
so
being here just feels so completely
surreal
you know we're just standing here tiny
little humans
on this giant side of the mountain
that's covered in snow
and rock i can't believe i'll be going
even higher
even higher than this the next day we
hiked back up here and set up this camp
hidden under a blanket of white mist
nestled among jagged rocks at over four
and a half thousand meters in altitude
summit day was fast approaching and we
knew we'd have to scramble up these
giant walls in order to get there
this is the night before the big day
tomorrow we wake up at
3 a.m and we start climbing towards
the summit tonight for some reason i
just
i'm so stressed out so anxious and i
just don't know what to expect
of tomorrow's journey and
it feels like a test of some sort even
though i know it's not
it's not it's a journey it's part of the
process
so i think tonight i just need to
i don't know figure out why i'm here
what i'm doing here what this means to
me
before i try to get to the top
in the meantime i'm gonna try and get
some sleep
all right see you at three
just go woken up it's 3 15
am still very much the middle of the
night
but we have to get going walking up the
western bridge
right now in the night so that we get to
the top
as the sun rises i think
i'm ready mike are you ready
still sleepy
good morning
[Music]
really really freezing and the fact that
the sun is not out yet
it's really not helping
[Music]
looks like we're ready to go off that
giant
wall of snow and ice and rock
good luck to us
[Music]
[Music]
we're in this we're doing this the
western bridge
is not the easiest route to the top but
we're here
and we'll get to the top i hope
[Music]
[Music]
uh
[Music]
i wish i could say something deep right
now about the mountains and about life
but nothing comes to mind all i can
think of is
getting to the top right now
[Music]
i actually can't believe it i've always
wanted to see
the shadow of a mountain at sunrise and
it's
right there this beautiful perfect
triangle reflecting off of the
entire horizon it's just so gorgeous
oh my god i can't believe it
[Music]
no pretty exhausted by now we're at
probably five and a half thousand meters
if not more
we've been climbing off the western
bridge for the last six and a half hours
and the end is in sight but it's just so
freaking cold
and i'm so so tired and so hungry
how much i love you
[Music]
i
[Music]
this this
[Music]
is probably the windiest place i've ever
been to
guys maybe
an accessible mountain but kilimanjaro
is a real mountain
here we are at probably 5
700 or 5 800 meters this is the final
summit push we're waiting in deep deep
snow
and hopefully we'll get there the next
half hour
mountain
we made it boyfriend
congratulations uh our lips are so
chapped
it's like two two pieces of tree bark
we ah yeah we uh here we have made it
after a week
of camping hiking trekking
in the rocks in the snow and the wind
on the roof of africa and i can't
believe
i'm finally here kilimanjaro
thank you for letting us be here
this is the most incredible feeling
you know i always ask myself why do we
go out to places like this
some of the most remote coldest spots in
the world
why do we do this to ourselves we could
be sitting comfortably at home
warm and cozy and yet here we are
i think i know why because these places
are the ones where feeling comfortably
numb
is simply not an option
[Music]
these are the places that make us feel
raw
and fully human and fully alive
i think that's why we come out here
and doing that that takes courage
because it's easy
to never leave our comfort zone but it
takes courage
to go in pursuit of adventure and to
seek
our own limits and you know what
i always say this and i will always say
this
the world belongs
[Music]
all right i'm back in the real world and
now kilimanjaro seems like a distant
dream but
what an amazing adventure that was
if you'd like to find out a little bit
more about the practical side of
climbing kilimanjaro i've actually made

your most commonly asked
questions like how long does it take is
it difficult do you need to be super fit
in order to climb it
will you get altitude sick who did i go
with what's the best way to take all
those questions
i answered in a video for my newsletter
subscribers so
