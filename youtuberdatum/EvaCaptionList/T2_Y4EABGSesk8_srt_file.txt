It's 7:00 a.m.
somewhere in the middle of Mauritania,
somewhere just on the edge of the Sahara
Desert, it's still dark outside.
I've been up since 4:00 a.m.
after about four hours of sleep because
I went to a wedding last night.
And right now, we're sitting here,
lying here, in fact, hey Mike
Hi!
waiting for a bus, apparently
that should take us to the starting point
of the roughest train ride
of our lives.
What is it in human nature
that would make someone spend 24 hours
on top of an exposed cargo train
speeding across the Sahara Desert?
I guess that's a question I'm seeking an
answer to as well.
We're sitting in a pretty crowded bus,
the gentleman behind me asked me to put on a hijab  
and we're on our way to Zouerat
Two hours late
let's see if we can even catch the train today
This is not the train, 
this is a washroom, this is a toilet
in a tiny little town before Zouerat
I needed get out and use the washroom, 
but there wasn't one anywhere here, 
so a family let me into their house 
to use their bathroom. 
And this is how it looks.
This is the toilet and this is the water
that you  use to clean yourself.
This is the door.
The window.
The courtyard.
That is the little girl who brought me here.
I'm gonna switch off the camera now.
We finally arrived in the city
town of Zouerat
It looks like this.
now waiting for a taxi, which our
kind bus driver ordered for us
to take us to the train. 
Hopefully we're on time.
I should also add this comes in really,
really handy while travelling around
Mauritania. Our passports were checked
I think six times 
just on this one stretch of the journey.
Time for adventure!
That was actually our train
but for some reason 
we are now in the passenger carriage, 
just temporarily to sort out our stuff 
and then go to the real thing.
I don't know where it's gone 
Just passed us at a pretty high speed
What's the plan?
we don't know.
I think we move a bit and then we connect.
Then we we jump quick.
We hop on to it?
Jump quick? Hop on?
But as you can tell, it's not
OK.
We were just rushed out of the passenger car.
The gentleman here is taking us to the... 
The mineral wagons 
are the ones that carry the iron ore. 
They're just right up ahead
The train is moving, 
we are on it, 
and there's iron ore everywhere.
There's black dust everywhere.
Oh my God, we're in the middle of Mauritania
on an iron ore train
crossing the Sahara Desert
 in the night!
What am I doing??
What am I doing, Mike?
This was only the beginning 
of a very long journey.
I know it all seems completely crazy 
but we tried to prepare as much as possible.
In an environment as harsh as this, 
you need to find ways to protect 
your frail little human body  
from all the elements that surround you.
My God
these jolts are so powerful 
(Mike) Just 20 hours to go
Oh, there it is.
You OK? 
It's like the train is gurgling
all these weird, primordial noises happening, 
taking place, the train is moving 
back and forth, vibrating,
you can hear thump, thump, thump, thump,
thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump
BANG 
That's what it does.
Oh, that is....
That's terrifying
There's one more coming!
Do you hear it? Thump, thump, thump.
Yeah.
Oh, my God.
The anticipation's the worst part.
Oh, my God, you know, it's coming.
Huh?
This is how they set up the train, by the way, 
they connect all the carriages to each other...
they connect them to each other
by clamping them together.
And the forces are just so immense,
they push the train back and forth.
Oh, we're moving.
We're moving smoothly.
Oh, my God. We just missed the police car.
We'll just tuck  back down for a minute.
To be continued
This is true adventure. 
Unpredictable and wild.
You know it when you feel your stomach sinking just a little bit, 
when you feel that lump in your throat, 
and your heart starts racing,
and you think to yourself:
 it’s impossible. 
And yet, you do it anyway.
What's it really like 
to cross the Sahara Desert 
on a coal train?
Well, I think this is one of
those once in a lifetime, bucketlist
kind of experiences. 
I mean, granted
I haven't lasted a single night yet
but so far, 
this pristine, wild and raw landscape 
that I see around me,
it's just something else.
It's like something out of a different time,
a different era, something that would have
happened 100 years ago 
but not today.
It's one of those last remaining experiences
that are so truly raw 
so truly pristine 
and completely unfiltered.
This is the real deal!
This is the real deal.
And that's why I'm here.
That's why we're here.
Did you just fly your drone here??
Can't believe it!
There it is!
This is amazing, guys!
Starting to get cold.
The sun will set in about half an hour.
And after that...
It's just the dark, deep night.
Bread and butter
done.
There's literally no way to make anything else.
Can't cook here.
No restaurant delivery service.
Gotta deal with it, huh?
I know this doesn't seem like the most
conventional kind of bed.
But there's no other choice
we gotta make yourself comfortable somehow.
So this is what we're doing.
Little mat. Mike's got a cushion.
A bit of a luxury here... 
and two sleeping bags.
That's it. This is how we're spending
tonight.
That over there, that's not Mike, 
Mike's right here.
That guy...
just climbed into our car,
said 'ca va?'
and went to sit down there.
Unexpected guest.
I know it may seem hard to believe, 
but this train is used by a handful of locals 
for their daily commute to work.
Quite different from your standard metro train isn’t it?
A day and a night
on an iron ore train
Bet you guys wanna see
what my face actually looks like?
I can't see.
You tell me!
It's breakfast time, finally, 
my favourite part of the day.
This is what we've got.
Beautiful
We didn't eat much last night,
so we still have pretty much everything
that we left with,
which is amazing.
I'm starving.
It's been a long, cold night.
I just need to get some food in my belly.
This Canadian 
maple butter from Mike.
I might just eat it before he does...
This is my breakfast sandwich.
It doesn't look great, 
but I'm sure it will taste amazing.
And just like that, 24 hours later, 
the Sahara cargo express 
emerged from the desert, and so did we. 
It was hard to believe that the world 
was once again becoming quite normal, 
quite predictable, 
the bittersweet feeling of returning to civilisation 
from the depths of the sandy ocean.
Oh, my God, I can't believe we've arrived!
this guy has been chasing the train 
for the last kilometre.
I think expecting us to hitch a ride with him.
Why do we do this to ourselves?
I think it's to feel raw.
And real.
Feel that power of the elements.
Something unfiltered.
To get in touch with ourselves 
and to feel that we have conquered
something within ourselves, 
I think that's why we do this.
And this is where the journey ends.
