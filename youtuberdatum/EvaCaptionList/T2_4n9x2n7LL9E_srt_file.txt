hey guys eva here if you've been
following my channel then you'll know
that last summer i went to mongolia to
do a seven
day horse trek all alone in the
mongolian
wilderness now that journey ended a
little bit
unexpectedly you can watch it here um so
after i recovered i decided to rent a
car
and drive it to the gobi desert to
continue
the adventure this is a video about
getting lost and then
being found it's a video about going
nowhere but actually finding somewhere
quite special
it's also about finding beauty in places
that aren't
conventionally beautiful but if all that
sounds way too romantic for you then
it's also just the story of a girl who
made the mistake perhaps of renting a
tiny little
two-wheel drive city car and drove it to
the desert let the adventure begin
the plan was to drive from ulaanbaatar
the capital of mongolia
to stay with a family of camel herders
who live in the gobi desert
that's a 2 000 kilometer round trip and
of course it had to start with some
unforeseen trouble
so my road trip vlog begins really well
here in mongolia with my car being
stuck in between these two cars
how does this happen how do people do
this
a couple of local guys tried to help me
out but let's just say that their
methods weren't
super effective
luckily one of the drivers blocking my
exit had left a note in her car with her
number on it
problem solved yes hello sanbano
yeah your car is kind of in the way of
my car
that that wasn't actually making that
call i had just made that call a little
bit earlier but this is a dramatic
recreation of how you deal with
situations like this in mongolia
apparently half an hour later and things
we're looking up again
and we're out let's go
the first stop on my way to the camel
herder's home in the gobi was the town
of
mandelgovi around 300 kilometers away
[Music]
okay the asphalt road has ended
and now i've just entered a dirt track
the next 70 kilometers
it's this
in a city car
average speed 20 kilometers an hour
average comfort
low average traffic situation cattle
all right first day of driving done it's
around 7 00 pm
and uh i'm kind of hungry and there's
this
slightly odd looking town here let's
find a place to eat
i'll show you what it looks like
mongolia is huge
half the size of india but has a tiny
population of just 3 million people
half of whom live in the capital the
other half live either nomadically
or in small remote towns like this one
[Music]
[Music]
i mean honestly this looks pretty good
it's like sizzling
fresh i'm happy let's try
kimchi that's all i understood and
obviously meat because this restaurant
is called seven meats
hmm that's good
it was really really meaty and now
to find a place to sleep
i am pretty sure i'll end up in the car
the first of its kind challenge for me
because i had never before
in my life found myself
in a rather odd
mongolian town in the middle of nowhere
and tried to find a place where i can
pop my car and sleep
because there are no hotels here this
place does not exactly inspire
trust let me put it that way
i was wrong there is a hotel here but
it's shut
all the windows are completely dark the
door is locked so i guess i'll just use
the hotel's parking lot
for its appropriate function and i'll
park up here and i'll sleep here
let's do that shall we
trust me when i say that any vaguely
flat surface can become a perfectly
acceptable bed
for one night
i was starting the day by driving 200
kilometers south to a place called
the white stupa ready let's go
[Applause]
true story i have no clue where i am
right now
but it looks like this is the definition
of the middle of nowhere
being here reminded me of a poem by t.s
eliot that really famous poet
it goes something like this the eyes
are not here there are no eyes here
in this valley of dying stars in this
hollow valley this broken jaw of our
lost
kingdoms in this last of meeting places
we grope together and avoid
[Music]
okay i think this may involve getting
lost
in a sandstorm but i really want to see
this place so
oh my god so we should go let's go
wow i guess i was really determined to
meet that camel hurting family in the
gobi desert huh
which is an amazing rock formation of
these
amazing cooperation
it's the next morning there's less wind
there's no rain no sandstorms
[Music]
look at these colors it's completely out
of this world it's like
mars it's like a different planet it's
just
astonishingly beautiful
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
next up 200 kilometers west to my next
destination
so guys listen this place just a few
hours south towards the kobe woo
that was pretty intense this place is
called the flaming clips and why is it
called the flaming eclipse or because
the cliffs seem to come
a light when the sunlight
[Music]
motivated me next was the last stretch
of the journey
just over 300 kilometers to a settlement
in the gobi desert
that was meant to be my final
destination where i would stay
with my fabled camel herding family
got lost three times i drove to like
this mountain range instead of the
desert
i had to ask in like three separate yurt
camps where the hell i
am and luckily luckily the peop there
were people there and they explained to
me in mongolian
which i don't understand by the way how
to get to the dunes
so they drew me little maps they showed
me symbols and stuff like that and
i think finally finally i know how to
get there
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
okay i've just arrived this is very good
and i've arrived at his camera herding
camp here right next to the
mongolis hungarian el sandules
been a really long journey on the tracks
across stats and mountains and i'm just
really keen to
stretch my legs see my gear
see what this place
[Music]
how beautiful is this
wow
oh thank you by the way in mongolia you
always
has a guest enter on the left side right
oh
what's this yes tabak oh tabac

thank you well i've never done this
before

um
that is strong it's kind of minty more
yeah
i don't know if i can handle more
oh wow
oh gosh this stuff is baking my eyes

and this is milk which is you know
something
that guests are typically welcomed with
here in mongolia

yeah thank you
wow hmm
sorry just took my camera
there's amazing snacks there's fresh
cow's milk here
and i'm just wow this is like the
perfect welcome i'm so happy to be here
thank you
many nomadic families in mongolia live
in yurts like this one
locally they're known as gurs they may
look simple on the outside but that
changes the moment
you step inside
[Music]
this is where i'm gonna be spending the
night this is a traditional nomadic
camp belonging to a camel herder we're
gonna go and check out some of the sand
dunes over there tomorrow morning but
for now i just want to spend some time
with the family
[Music]
so today since we are in the middle of
the mongolian countryside and it's a
little bit cold we decided to make a
traditional dish called
which should keep us nice and warm and
it's a lot of meat
like this i'm gonna be cooking this for
the next few hours
[Music]
the hot hog is known as the king of
mongolian cuisine
yes it does have some veggies in it but
mostly it's really about the meat
which is cooked with hot stones for
several hours
until it's tender and juicy
[Music]
mind you this was all filmed before i
went vegetarian
[Music]
so
this is eric which is horse milk mass
milk
apparently it's it's not
entirely sober
[Music]
just have a little bit oh wow it's good
that's great it's sparkling cool
and i feel like after a whole cup your
stomach might be
like new
[Music]
so
[Music]
so this is the famous
it's basically a pile of really nice
juicy fresh meat with some vegetables
scattered around it and this was
cooked over hot stones for about
three hours super traditional mongolian
dish
this is the louvre by the way
it's pretty basic but it'll do
after all we are in the middle of the
gobi
i can't have too high expectations
after all that driving i didn't just go
to sleep i
pretty much crashed besides zoroku told
me that we had to be
up really early the following morning
zorigo and i
are about to go on a camel ride of
course
that's why i'm here the cameras are
already waiting
good morning good morning here they
are pretty big creatures
hello good morning how are you
zory goo gets up before sunrise every
day to drive his head of camels to a
nearby oasis
this is his work his life
out here in a remote corner of a very
remote country
[Music]
the dunes where zorigo lives and works
are often called the singing sands
because of a haunting whistling sound
that rises over them on windy days
as the sounds shift and move about
[Music]
[Music]
i like to think that this vlog is also
partly the story of zorigoo
king of the singing sans
and that's my solo road trip to the gobi
remember
even if you feel that you are going to
the middle of nowhere
that middle of nowhere could very well
be the center of everywhere
for someone it could be their home
their everything they're everywhere if
