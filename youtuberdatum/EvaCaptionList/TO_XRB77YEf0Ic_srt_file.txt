just one word of warning before i start
this vlog
iraqi kurdistan is probably not going to
be what you expected it to be
because when i first visited it six
months ago it certainly shattered
pretty much all of my preconceptions but
i'm not going to tell you about iraqi
kurdistan i'm going to show you
its capital urban here's a quick lowdown
on where i am right now
kurdistan is an autonomous region in the
northern reaches of iraq
despite tensions in the recent past it's
pretty safe to visit these days
in fact i like iraqi kurdistan so much
that it's my second time here in just
six months and erbil the capital of
iraqi kurdistan
overflows with history yet few people
outside of the region know about it
see it's one of the oldest continuously
inhabited cities in the world
people have been living here for over
seven thousand years
and all this history and culture still
survives here very much survives here in
iraqi kurdistan
there's probably one really good place
where i can show you some of it and that
is the main
bazaar
i have this theory about bazaars i
believe them to be the true and
authentic gathering places for people
and cultures anywhere in the world the
bazaar always seems to be the busiest
and liveliest spot in the city no
and here in erbil it's no different
see on my very first visit to erbil i
went past this little shop
and i bought myself a pretty stunning
cap and shawl right here
still one of my favorite items probably
one of the coolest things i own
hi how are you good excellent
i still have my hat let's try this on
all right the traditional kurdish cup
good how about this
embellished caps and turbans are a key
part of the kurdish traditional dress
and they're still widely worn here
especially by men
my thread is me yeah yeah it's my
favorite
peace thank you bye
they remember me that's so nice but
there is much more to kurdish culture
than fashion
in one of the side alleys of the bazaar
i noticed a tiny hole in the wall
carpentry shop
and its owner invited me right down
i got a check i got a seat in this shop
you make it
this gentleman here makes me all these
this is
one year this shop is 100 years old yes
my favorite this
this is this
okay no no no no no no no
no no candy you have to say
thank you there's one more place here at
the bazaar
that has a really significant history
that i'm really keen to find
it is called mam kalili
but where do i find it this bizarre is
huge it's like
a maze
oh wow what's that gold
do you know where mam khalil is mam
kalili
here no next one yes okay thank you
okay that was easy let's go every city
in the world has a tea house like this
the cultural anchor the gathering place
the living museum that sport your
grandfather would visit every week to
meet with his buddies
for a long and slow cup of tea that one
spot which holds tradition in place and
preserves
decades of memories cafe is called
and it's been in operation since 1963.
i'm getting myself
the walls of the mamkali tea house are
aligned with photos of all the famous
kurds who have come here
it's the oldest cafe in the entire city
and the locals love it so much that many
have been coming here
since childhood the owner claims that
everyone who sits down at mam kalili
must drink more than a single cup of
chai
well that's definitely something i can
get behind
right here in kurdistan in general
chai is drunk very simple
strong no milk plenty of sugar
yep a whole lot of sugar cheers
perfect this stuff really wakes you up
all right halas with the tea and let's
take this vlog back to street level
this is one of the traditional kurdish
[Applause]
floofs
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
who is telling me about all these
traditional kurdish flutes
tell me again the name
that's a balaban yes
this is traditional kurdish accomplished
i'm getting a personal lesson and flute
playing from back here right here
we also have an audience doing a good
job thank you
thank you hello this is my flute oh it's
so beautiful
thank you so much okay
thank you look at that what a lovely
souvenir from iraqi kurdistan one of the
traditional
kurdish flutes straight from back here
also taught me how to play but
i think i'll just leave that to him and
while for bakir the flute is the way to
preserve his kurdish heritage
there's something else i want to show
you and this is something i've seen
almost every kurdish man engage in there
is one little quirk about iraqi
kurdistan and you will notice this
behavior
very very frequently and it's related to
these these are
prayer beads now a lot of older
kurdish gentlemen more specifically can
be found
playing with these beads the entire time
just fiddling with them playing with
them just
constantly in their hands and nobody
really knows where it comes from
because it's not always related to
prayer let's put it that way some say
that it's related to simply relieving
stress people got so used to playing
with these beats
that has become a national hobby
and you can find them in all kinds of
patterns and colors and qualities
some of them are absolutely exquisite in
their craftsmanship
and will set you back a few hundred
bucks
some of them are factory made others are
hand sculpted and painted
but the main thing is that you will find
these prayer beads absolutely
everywhere in iraqi kurdistan a true
national pastime
and towards the end of the day in the
evening families and friends gather here
on the main square of erbil drink tea
and juice
simply enjoy now i think a lot of people
don't quite know about this side of iraq
or kurdistan or iraqi kurdistan in fact
i think a lot of people don't even know
that you can
come to iraq and kurdistan but this is
such an incredible region
right it's a great region
people are really really friendly and i
highly recommend that you visit
oh ava oh look he remembers my name
how are you i was speaking to these
gents yesterday
good morning good morning good afternoon
good evening
shortly after filming this vlog i
learned from my local friends that bakir
the flute maker
passed away in the meantime i'd like to
dedicate this vlog
to his memory and to the hearts of all
the people
preserving kurdish culture all around
the world
oh
