oh my god look at this
holy
[Music]
i had been in albania for a couple of
weeks when some local friends invited me
to come visit a village
hidden high in the mountains
this doesn't seem to be the most
promising start to
our next adventure here in albania audi
where are we going
well we're following google maps isn't
it so
we're ending up in ibiza in this village
the reason why this village
is hard to get is because of
the wrong direction from gives mainly
so do not take this relative it didn't
seem so
bad at the beginning but i really
couldn't have predicted what was still
to come
we're just making a quick little stop
here oh to have a coffee
and i noticed something really strange
these
odd strange creepy teddy bears with
garlic
wrapped around their neck apparently
they're here to protect people
from the evil eye
oh my god did you hear that thunder
this does not bode well i don't know
about this
we reached the mountain road just as the
weather started getting progressively
worse
the asphalt suddenly disappeared and in
front of us were miles of dirt tracks
this place is so so wild it looks like
we're really
about to reach the edge of the world
so what i'm doing here i'm putting on
differential lock so i have full control
of the car
it's just a plastic fancy thing sounded
[Music]
so the warm-up is behind us right
i really wanted to see this mountain
village that everybody had told me about
but i wasn't going to risk my life
just to get there okay what do you think
is it possible
it is possible but it's getting pretty
dangerous oh my god look at this
it's so rainy but there's that
little bit just ahead of us that looks
extremely slippery
and extremely risky i don't know about
this
no i'm afraid of what's going to happen
is landslides
adi has just run to the edge of the road
to the next stand to see whether the
rest of the road is possible
i mean to me this looks a little bit too
dodgy i have a feeling we're going to
turn around
yeah all this rain
is creating these little streams
in the road and you know that makes
the rock extremely loose check this out
wow
i don't know about this
we're going to keep going no seriously
oh holy oh
my god
oh my god we're still here we're still
here
oh my god this road is too much i've
been
on a lot of crazy roads in my life but
this i gotta say
definitely ranks in the top three i will
change that
he's saying it's gonna be the top one
oh my god sorry i have to speed in these
things
all right i'm just gonna open the window
so i can jump out
so this is my emergency exit right here
thank you very much
the craziest thing about this road is
that it's on google maps
yep google maps recommends this road as
a standard way to get to the village of
nivita
as for us not only were we armed with a
rugged 4x4
adi is a specially trained off-road
driver can you imagine
accidentally taking this road with your
family in an average city car
i have a feeling that adventure wouldn't
end very well
[Music]
i can barely believe it after all that
craziness
we're just about to arrive
does it yeah oh my god
wow
oh my god this place okay it's so rainy
it's still cold and windy but check out
this place
it's so beautiful hello
how are you
nice to meet you
[Music]
we had arrived i almost couldn't believe
my eyes
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
oh my god it's warm
and pretty and cozy
and there's a fire
in addition to surviving this is
probably
the best thing that can happen after an
insane
windy rainy cold hailing
dangerous risky drive like the one
that we just survived
[Music]
oh
thank you very much
[Music]
check this out what do we say in albania
because
oh my god there's more coming
[Music]
[Music]
oh my god it's so strong it's so strong
it's so strong it's so strong
outside the storm was still raging but
we had found
a really cozy shelter at patrice and
douche's place
the weather is quite unusual so we might
lose electricity
but at least we'll be warm because of
that
[Music]
to me this is the essence of family life
it's as simple as switching off the tv
and spending time just being present
with each other
petri even roasted some chestnuts for us
[Music]
and sure enough power went out in the
entire village the moment
it got dark outside
okay the wind has been so strong that
it's blown
out the electricity so now we're sitting
here
in the dark with this camera
[Music]
oh my gosh this sauce
[Music]
divine fresh vegetables i bet from the
area
[Music]
delicious
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
good morning today for breakfast we're
making patula i'm not really sure what
they are but apparently they're very
traditional here in albania so let's see
how they're made in high season ducha
uses the freshest of local ingredients
to make food that's famous across the
canyon
[Music]
so what exactly are these so it's a
simple dish i guess all it has is flour
water and salt all mixed together and
you fry it it's a common
breakfast thing in albania after the
coffee and the rakia
[Music]
here is one of these famous petula i'm
really curious to see how they taste
because they do seem quite simple
[Music]
first bite hot
fluffy on the inside crispy on the
outside
a perfect tiny little pancake let's add
some honey
[Music]
oh my god this is the goodbye
rakia
[Laughter]
is
[Music]
okay
you could tell that petrie and duchess
missed having visitors around
their village is far off the tourist
trail and yes
it takes some time in guts to get there
but before the pandemic
they would welcome a small but constant
stream of intrepid travelers
as for me i know i'll be back there
again hopefully
in warmer weather
[Laughter]
[Music]
you
