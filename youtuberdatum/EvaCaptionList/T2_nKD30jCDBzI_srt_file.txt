welcome to mongolia
my sole spot
i've come here twice before once on the
trans-siberian railway
then to work at a horse trekking camp
last summer i came back a third time to
trek
in the wilderness just me and my two
horses
two weeks in the mongolian wild
it might sound crazy my family and
friends thought it was
but it was an idea that had been brewing
in me for years and finally
i felt it was the right time to give it
a try
[Music]
i had just been through a difficult
breakup i felt defeated by all the
pressure i was feeling from social media
i was exhausted just felt like i needed
to get away from everything for a little
while
do something that i had always dreamt of
that's where horses
entered the scene i feel a kind of
serenity when i'm around them
to a horse it doesn't matter if your
heart is broken or your spirit spent
it will give you a piece of its own soul
horses for me are healing and that's
what i was hoping to find
out there in the wild
[Music]
but of course when a dream becomes a
reality it can bring you crashing down
to earth
it's finally hitting me it's hitting me
that my gps device is not working that i
can't log into my gps account to sync my
maps
it's hitting me to that like that
is the most fundamental part of my track
and teaching me that i probably don't
have enough food to last me for two
weeks
and i feel like crying
i needed help to get ready enter buena
buena is a mongolian horseman he's
probably the best rider i've ever met
[Music]
and he offered to teach me some of the
tips and tricks of mongolian horsemen
that included fixing saddles which i had
a feeling might come in handy on my
track
this is my first time riding and
practicing with two horses
so i've got this guy here on one lead
and this guy
is moving already this is is what riding
with two horses looks like
yeah it is just as tricky as it looks
thanks to buenas help i finally plucked
up the courage to go ahead with my plan
[Music]
all right i guess most of everything
is packed just a couple of tiny things
remaining like cables and wires and
chargers
but i think i'm ready to go
i should say that i'm nowhere near ready
to go actually i'm really not
but i think the best thing to do is just
go for it now i mean
i'm done i'm packed i've got everything
i need
why am i scared i think this is probably
normal
um so yeah i've just gotta go now
i'm gonna go i'm gonna go
[Music]
i'm just moving all my stuff into the
truck
uh together with the horses we're going
to be driving
all the way to the teddy national park
which is one of the national parks here
probably takes about two hours and that
will be the starting point
it's getting kind of late it's already
2pm
by the time we get there before by the
time we get off the truck it'll be like
five
so i don't know how far realistically i
will go today
but the point is i am packed and we are
ready to go
[Music]
bye see you in two weeks
thanks hopefully
hopefully i can do it we can do it right
all right we're going in
bye now
my driver advised me not to go ahead
with the trek
he said i might encounter some bad
people on the way
he said it wasn't good for a girl to do
it alone
but my mind was already made up well
we're getting closer and closer to
that which is the place where i'm going
to be starting our trek and suddenly
there's rain from beautiful blue skies
and
have an amazing sunny day we've got a
rainy day
that's the start of my trek i may have
put on a brave face but really
i was petrified
just arrived at the final stop
the horses are fine they're a bit wet
because it has been raining quite a bit
so now i just need to make sure that
they get off the truck safely
i need to get them all set up and geared
up and
and then i guess we go and the first
obstacle that i see on our way
is that river over there which we will
have to cross
this is an interesting start
[Music]
[Music]
oh yes
yes good boy
bye and from now on i'm all alone
well not quite alone because i've got
these two guys to keep me company
[Music]
i got lucky a local host man helped me
cross the river safely
i rode for a little while on the other
side of the river but soon realized that
sunset
was already upon me
[Music]
so i didn't manage to get very far it's
quickly getting dark i got here pretty
late
but um yeah i decided to just camp out
in the town or at the i'm just on the
edge of the town the first town
i guess i was in luck because i got
invited to
um edgar and here are some booze
and buzz which are the mongolian
dumplings
oh wow
wow this is a beautiful family girl wow
i just asked if i could camp here and
they invited me in for some dumplings
how lovely
[Laughter]
i hadn't expected to be meeting many
people along the way but that very first
evening my hosts welcomed me to their
home and made me fresh
salty milk tea the traditional way
here's a mongolian soup recipe take some
dumplings
pour salty milk tea over them and you're
[Music]
done
which is
[Music]
these rivers and streams were about to
become my guides
i knew that i couldn't lose sight of
them throughout my trek
i needed to have access to fresh water
every day for myself
and for my horses the rivers could
become my nemesis if i had to cross them
but they were also essential to our
survival
i was setting off beyond the settlement
beyond any permanent human habitation
once you reach the end of this track
it's just forests and hills
all the way north to siberia and the
arctic
[Music]
[Music]
okay it's been about three hours of
riding
the boys are doing well they're being a
bit stubborn from time to time
especially the pack horse
just tends to stop and rip
the reins out of my hand but
otherwise it's pretty amazing
it's beautiful out here my plan was to
settle from the entrance to the park and
trek northwards for several days until
the hagen hanoi
the black lake once i reached the lake i
would turn around
and head all the way back out here in
the wild
the days began to grow longer and more
majestic
[Music]
[Applause]
i've been traveling for about three and
a half hours and decided to stop for
a quick lunch break this is my lunch
it's dark bread dark rye bread with tuna
and cherry tomatoes it's actually pretty
fancy
if you think about it the horses are
getting some rest they're grazing
so far so good it's been pretty smooth
apart from the pack horse suddenly
stopping the entire time and
pulling me along apart from my road
horse freaking out a couple of times
because he saw a bird
and almost throwing me off yeah
apart from that it's all good
at that point i was just hoping that the
horse is spooking so easily
wasn't a sign of things to come
[Music]
so
[Music]
do
[Music]
do
[Music]
do
[Music]
you
so
um
you know i haven't met a single soul
today it's just been
me and the horses nobody else
not a single soul yep places like that
still exists in this world
imagine being so deeply alone so far
away
that all your fears all your worries all
your insecurities
dissolve into thin air
that's freedom
[Music]
it's a pretty big storm just down that
way above the lake where i was
originally meant to be headed
and uh the horses are freaking out a
little bit because of the thunderstorm
and
i mean the clouds are very dark i don't
particularly want to get
stuck thunder again
i don't want to get stuck in a storm or
in rain or
you know the entire ground becomes
really boggy when there's heavy rain so
i think
it's time now to head back
this wasn't part of the plan the plan
was to keep going but
i just don't think i can risk it alone
so i'll turn back and i'll figure out a
different route somewhere else
i guess part of the journey
just to adjust and be flexible and adapt
right
well i think at least they're happy
powering ahead
their hooves get really really stuck in
this stuff
it's moments like this where you have to
have a lot of confidence
in your horse and these guys are just so
short-footed and they're so
confident across this terrain
unbelievable
i wasn't having the best of days a
couple of hours later
my saddle broke
[Music]
i fixed it all was good again for a
short while anyway
[Music]
my horses were nameless mongolians are
some of the world's most skilled riders
but they don't give names to their
horses
some say it's to protect their horses
from evil spirits
and according to others it's because a
horse's soul should not be bound to the
earth
by an earthly name
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
wow
yeah the riding horse got spooked by the
pack horse's saddle and it just reared
and backed and
saddle slipped and i slipped with it and
i fell on the ground and it was a rocky
patch
so that's how i broke my eyebrow
and uh
i feel like i have a concussion this
time which is probably not something
that you want to be dealing with on your
own
as much as it really pains me to say
this
i think this is it i think i have to
stop because this is the second time
i've fallen and
[Music]
it does feel a bit shitty like
getting up
this is what it is
[Music]
right after i got back to the closest
settlement
a local family welcomed me into their
camp and i got to spend the night
with them the next morning i called up
my local friends who sent
in a horse truck to pick me up pretty
much the next day
after that i just took some days to
recover and thankfully i had
no lasting injuries nothing like that
apart from
headaches this is not an experience i
would recommend
to anybody not at all now keep in mind
that i've been
riding since i have since i was a child
i've been to mongolia before i've done
group treks in mongolia before
so it wasn't exactly new yet the
experience was
revolutionary in my life it took me a
year to
just even sit down and edit the video
and decide whether i wanted to share it
with
the big public world of youtube and
here it is i guess i went out there
seeking solitude and
a test of sorts and what i found was
a lot of solitude a lot of personal
challenges
a lot of time alone where it's just you
and your fears
and the best and the worst of you
it was mentally emotionally and
physically the most challenging thing
i'd ever done
every single night i went to bed
emotionally
and and mentally drained even though i
had no distractions but i guess that was
one of the biggest challenges is that
when you're alone like that there are no
distractions nothing to take your mind
away from
your thoughts and your feelings
and physically i was so tired every
single day
that i just came crashing down every
night
falling asleep at eight o'clock barely
enough energy to even
give in to my fears which i guess helped
because
i felt a lot of fear
on my own out there and in the wild
the the main thing that the trek did to
me was it showed me
how insignificant my ego was in the
the grand scheme of things none of
this means much and none of this
is particularly significant and i think
that's something that definitely crushed
me but in the long run
elevated me and turned me into a better
person
immediately after the trek i remember
telling myself that i would
never do it again never that i would
never go on a solo horse track
ever again i promised myself that
but i'm already planning the next one
thanks for watching guys this was a
really personal journey for me and a
super personal video so
please be kind please be understanding
and
um yeah thanks for watching
i guess i'll see you in the next one
you
