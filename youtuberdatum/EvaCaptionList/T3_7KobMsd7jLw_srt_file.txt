[Music]
there's a lot of different muscles that
are aching right now
a few k left until i'm there
[Music]
guys we've made it we've just arrived at
socatra island and in a couple of days
we're gonna be attempting something
that's never been done before
if you've been following my channel for
a while you'll know that i spent three
months on this island as the pandemic
shut down the world in early 2020
well this vlog is a kind of a prequel it
tells the story of why i came here in
the first place
i'm also going to be making a huge
announcement so make sure you stick
around
until the end all these people around me
everybody here has come for the very
first marathon to ever be held in
ireland socotra island is ultra remote
and
really difficult to reach definitely not
your typical running destination
the truth is i hadn't been doing much
training since my last marathon
in iraqi kurdistan but i couldn't pass
up on the opportunity to complete a
marathon here in yemen
little did i know that this trip would
change my life forever
t-minus two hours it's pretty quiet out
here
just two hours before the race i'm
having some chai
the camp is looking amazing
let's take a look at what these guys are
up to what are you guys up to
well i'm blowing up my tires before the
marathon
ready we'll try and pump that too
[Music]
that's it good all right abdullah was
helping me today
it's nice to have him help are you
looking forward to it yeah i
am i can't wait this will be a fun fun
time with everybody
yeah but at night can you imagine
yeah that's the thing it's part of the
race a big part of the race is at night
so it's going to be dark
[Music]
[Applause]
yes
[Music]
one of the main issues with running a
marathon on an island like this
there's a lot of sand everywhere
in your shoes in your socks in your
clothes
everywhere and trust me you don't want
sand rubbing against your feet or other
parts of your body if you have to run 42
kilometers
that's right abdullah yes exactly
welcome ireland okay
it's time to go gonna get in the cars
and we're gonna drive up to
the starting point of a marathon i
signed up for three days ago
and have no training for this should be
[Music]
fun
[Music]
that's the starting point over there
this is getting more and more real guys
now this is not a big marathon by any
means it's it's not huge so the means
that we have here are relatively modest
but we're making it work
and this is looking pretty good we've
got soft drinks here we've got
dates and fruits as snacks we've got a
paved road we're going to be running
that way
so i'm really excited but first i think
i need to do
a couple of runner things 73 that's the
number of my bib that is my runner
number which i now have to attach to my
t-shirt
okay the number's on so i've come here a
little bit before everybody else
to give myself ample time to uh prepare
my muscles for for a marathon
[Music]
everybody else is coming now wow this
stuff is getting real
got a bunch of cars filled with runners
and for all of us it's our first time
running a marathon
in yemen all right you guys ready
how many marathons have you run
this is his 106th the baby's intense
[Laughter]
so guys this is the socrata challenge
2020
the first marathon ever in sokotra
and possibly the first marathon in yemen
anyway
[Laughter]
ready
one of the short ones and we're done so
basically we cannot run a full 42k
just one way here on this island so what
we're going to be doing is making
a lapse there's kind of six and a half
laps that we're going to be making
along this road
what's going on but we're here to make
it happen
how's everyone feeling
[Laughter]
[Music]
now
[Music]
the coolest thing about this race is
that there are some people here
who are running to get a good time there
are some people here who are trying to
run a marathon in every country in the
world and there are people here who are
just doing it fun
and it's just and no pressure
kind of friends get together community
style
[Music]
marathon
lap mini lap one done
we got some locals here to cheer us on
there's a few families over there and
there's a few
girls over here hello hello
this island belongs to yemen and that's
going through a really difficult crisis
right now
but that doesn't mean the country's not
beautiful
and those people are unkind
hey team
[Music]
[Music]
7k
[Music]
[Music]
it's getting a little bit dark in fact
it's completely pitch black
already just a little bit of a whitish
grayish haze up on the sky
so i've got myself a head torch
all right the rest of the race is a
night race
so the restaurant is all been for you 24
hours
don't worry and then when you're done
13 and a half kilometers still alive
just about here
this is the part of the race
when things get
apart between 20k and 30k
kind of just past the halfway point
that's where your legs really start to
feel like they hurt and that's where
your mind starts to tell you
this is too much this is definitely the
hardest part of the race
but once you're past 30 the adrenaline
begins to kick in again and you
know that the finish line is not that
far so
a few k left until i'm there
fell off the road
ah it's a lot of different muscles that
are aching right now
it feels like i need to stop you know my
body's just telling me
it's 200 meters left until the finish
line
i see it right there it's
so close this has been really difficult
physically
and mentally but
this place is so beautiful and the
people here have been so welcoming
just amazing i'm so happy i got to do
this
don't want to fart the finish line
almost there
oh my god
[Music]
is it true
yes i did finish the marathon but no i
have
no videos no clips no footage of me
finishing the marathon zero in fact all
i have is this
really bad really dark photo of me with
the medal
honestly when i realized that i don't
have any clips of me
finishing the marathon of actually
crossing the finish line i got really
upset with myself i mean come on i'm a
professional travel vlogger how can i
not have a video of the most important
moment
of the marathon and then i cooled down
and i thought about it some more and i
realized that finishing a marathon is
not actually the most important
thing about running a marathon the most
important thing about
running a marathon is running the
marathon it's the process
of running it's the pain the struggle
the journey the resilience the
perseverance of it all
42 kilometers is a long distance
speaking of resilience and perseverance
if you've been around here on this
channel for a little while then you'll
probably know what happened next
after that fateful marathon in march
2020
i ended up spending another three months
on sarca island
as the world went into pandemic lockdown
and then eventually made my way back
home on a cargo ship amidst
a global pandemic but let's not dwell
too much on the past
there's one more really important piece
of news that i want to share with you
right now and it's
all about travel in 2021 and my biggest
project i think ever to date it all goes
back to this funny idea that i have
about life
basically i believe that if once in a
while you decide to
face your fears leave your comfort zone
behind
that is a sure way to grow and expand
your horizons
and open yourself up to new
possibilities and realize that you're
capable of so much more
than you thought you were so my plans
for 2021 are very much related to all
those ideas
in 2021 i have decided that i
am going to run an ultra marathon
right now you're probably wondering what
on earth is an
ultra marathon well an ultra marathon is
anything
any race that is longer than a marathon
i.e
longer than 42 kilometers ultra
marathons can be
anywhere between usually 50 kilometers
and
i believe 3000 is the longest one on
earth
but i will not be running that one
not yet the marathon that i would like
to run in 2021
will be around 200 or 250 kilometers
and spread over a period of five to
seven days
that basically means that at some point
in 2021 i will spend a week
running a marathon a day
i can't disclose the location just yet
because i myself i'm not sure of it
because of the covered travel
restrictions
but i have a very very important
question for you
would you like me to share snippets of
my journey of
my training towards an ultra marathon
here on youtube
let me know in the comments below i
would love to hear your feedback
and yes i'm absolutely terrified of
running an ultra marathon i mean i don't
feel ready at all and i feel like i will
never
be ready but you know what i know that
it's possible
people have done it before me and people
will do it after me
and if i train hard enough and if i
prepare myself hard enough
i know that i will be able to do it
and you know what else the world belongs
to the brave
if you never try you'll never know what
you're capable of
well that was a lot of talking anyway if
you enjoyed this video make sure that
you give it a like or subscribe to my
channel if you haven't already in the
meantime
i'll see you in the next vlog
