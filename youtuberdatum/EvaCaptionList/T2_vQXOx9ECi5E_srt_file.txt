it's going to be my home too
for a short 24 hours but this harsh
stretch of desert
is a permanent home to many people
living in the sahara
good morning it's a beautiful crisp
morning in the middle of the desert in a
tiny little desert town called cinquity
and this is the obersch zarga
which is a tiny little guest house that
we were staying in last night let me
show you
this is one of the rooms it's very
simple
very rudimentary this was our room
right here this is the beautiful little
courtyard
this is after after we'll be taking us
to the nomadic
people living in the desert which is the
whole reason why we came all the way
out here but first a tour of chinguji
i know it may seem hard to believe but
this town now covered in sand
was once a vibrant city on the
trans-sahara trading route
to abdul how many people used to live
here
now five families wow ten thousand
people
city of rubble in the middle of the
desert
in mauritania nothing happens without
tea and especially not a long journey
into the desert like the one that awaits
us
all right our tour of the town is done
we're leaving to get you behind
in this tiny little jeep look
sitting in the boot we got two youtubers
four bags of gear and about 35 house
flies
we left the town behind it soon
disappeared into the reddish sandy glow
that rises over this land there was
nothing around us
no points of orientation no signs to
tell the way
for over an hour our drivers simply
spread across the desert towards the
destination that only he knew
we're here
and here it was the camp that was to be
our home for the next 24 hours
[Music]
and here is soliman our host the head of
the family
a man of few words abedu he calls
himself
he is a desert nomad
[Music]
we're going to be making a traditional
bread it's actually a bread that you
make
in the sand with hot coals but first
to prepare the bread mix the dough
i guess that's what it's called
[Music]
making the bread is a pretty long
process it takes 30 minutes alone just
to knead
the dough and prepare it for the fire
pit
this is where it's going to bake
[Music]
oh wow
[Music]
oh wow and this is the end result
beautiful
hot bread straight from a sandy fire pit
it's your bite they're into it although
it's super hot
it's got this beautiful softness on the
inside crunchiness on the outside
absolutely perfect i could definitely
eat this every day
we wash our hands why because we're
about to eat
with our hands in fact with the right
hand right yes
with the right hand because this is the
clean hand according to the quran
and in the entire islamic world people
eat with their right hand
grab a handful squeeze it up a little
bit
and eat super delicious
it was a great honor to share this meal
with soliman and his family
it's not often that they eat goat meat
out here in the desert
in fact it's not often they have guests
here
i want to show you guys inside this tent
this is where the family lives it's
pretty much their
their eating space their dining space
their cooking space they're sleeping and
relaxing space it's
everything in this one tent so basically
here we've got the space for the guests
this is where we would normally sit if
we're visiting
over here this is the place where they
would sleep everybody just alongside
here and mattresses this here is
the kitchen space this is where the
women
make the tea this is where they make
breakfast
lunch dinner pretty much everything that
can be done
inside a tent there's another cooking
space just outside which i'll show you
in a second
but this is it this is where most of the
action happens for the entire family of
six people so that was the the main tent
just over there
and here this is the storage unit
this is where the family stores all
their food things like
vegetables right here we've got tea
we've got some coals we've got gas this
is a
natural organic fridge
it's actually the remains the skin the
hide of of a goat
squeezed into a little parcel you put
water inside
and it keeps cold amazing
these are all the important things that
the family needs to survive
out here in the desert south
self-sufficiently
and right here this area
sorry too much wind noise this is the
outdoor kitchen
and this is the main cooking spot and
the fire goes underneath there
there's one more part of the camp
these wooden shafts these shacks made
out of
branches and straw they're very very
modest
pretty well insulated there's even a
little solar panel here
and if you go inside
the nomads build these shacks themselves
all by themselves so here we've got the
tree branches which are
sort of support structures there's a lot
of sand everywhere by the way
and the entire thing is just filled
fill out with this with straw to
insulate it and to protect it from the
wind and
the elements and of course the sand
which still if you just
do this it's absolutely everywhere
they call it the silent killer and i can
definitely see why
there's actually one more place here in
the camp that's of utmost importance to
the family
and this is the one this right here is
the goat enclosure now the guts are not
actually here because we've gone away
to the desert to grace yes we can graze
goats in the desert
as unlikely as it sounds however
there is something here right here in
front of me i'm looking at right now
that i want to share with you
[Music]
ah okay it's a bit of a quieter spot
we're a little bit sheltered from the
wind here and you know it's pretty crazy
to think that containing animals like
this
and humans can survive in an environment
as
harsh as this not only is this desert
it's also a place which is so
windy and cold and
far off from our urban centers of
civilization you know and yet
people and animals survive here
they have to
[Music]
guys mike just noticed that i remember
and i was like did you burn your hair
but now it's actually chewed right off
[Music]
my go gave me a haircut i don't know
what to think about it i should probably
be mad but
the title of the vlog i got a haircut by
a ghost
oh my god unbelievable there's a lot of
families all around the world
who live in the desert and one very
important part of their lives is of
course
getting water most nomads like solomon's
family
live around deep water wells where they
can get their water straight from the
bowels of the earth
it's hard and time-consuming work to get
the water out of the well
and transport it as we were about to pay
a visit to the neighbours
we thought we'd do the work for them and
bring them a couple of buckets
there's a great culture of hospitality
in this part of the world and especially
with the nomads you kind of have to rely
on each other once in a while
[Music]
these two ladies live here completely on
their own so they kind of rely on the
support of the neighboring families to
survive
and thrive but they are making us some
of that famous mauritanian tea
as we speak let's try it
abdu taught us a very important lesson
about tea
and mauritania he said that the first
taste is soft like life
the second is sweet like love
and the third is bitter like death
[Music]
that's exactly how the taste evolves in
your mouth it's pretty amazing
well cheers to life love and death
[Laughter]
the other shoe where's the other shoe
we lost the shoe we lost two shoes we
found both of them
as they turned into night we found
ourselves getting ready
for sleep the place that we're sleeping
in
is has a character of its own
and this is the interior
of the hut this is where we're sleeping
tonight
in the middle of the desert
so this is our breakfast here today
we've got some
local bread called hoops got some fruit
so what the the lady is doing here
unfortunately i can't film her
um it would be disrespectful of me to do
so
but what the older lady the the matron
of the house of the camp is doing here
is she's making
cheese and butter out of goat milk
and the way that she does it is through
a traditional method of swinging around
some milk in a goat's skin
and this here is goat's cheese fresh
goat's cheese so what you do
you take some hopes
and we dip it in the cheese
and voila here's a little cheese
sandwich
well it's my last few minutes here at
the camp and
honestly it's taken me a little while to
digest everything that i
saw you know staying with this family
for a short little while
look i know i'll never be able to
understand what it's actually like to
live in the sahara desert
it's beyond the imagination of most of
us watching this video
on a phone or computer screen but this
is life in all its softness love
and bitterness this is life
just like a cup of mauritanian tea
you
