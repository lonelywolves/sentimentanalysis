over the next three days we're going to
be trekking
right here in the romanian mountains and
trust me
this place is extremely wild and raw
no hotels no shelters no restaurants
nothing
i'm gonna have to be completely
self-reliant and from what i've heard
the trails here are not very well marked
so hopefully
in three days we'll make it back to
[Music]
civilization
[Music]
welcome to romania not many people know
just how beautiful it is here
[Music]
i was tempted to keep romania my little
secret
my personal hidden gem but i can't help
but
share its beauty with the world
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
our main challenges over the next three
days would be
finding our bearings to follow the right
way and finding water
to sustain us
[Music]
just before the dirt track ended we were
lucky to find some locals who helped us
out
with last minute directions
[Music]
got it i guess you just keep going
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
oh
so
[Music]
oh
oh yes
[Music]
[Music]
what do you think sauce and are putting
pepperoni in
[Music]
yeah so good
that's exactly what you need
after a day of tracking
[Music]
good morning
[Music]
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
the plan was to start the day by
summiting this peak
and then continue trekking all along
these ridges
until beyond the horizon
[Music]
where are we
okay you're the one with the map vape i
have no idea
here somewhere here
where is here exactly romania
the carpathian mountains nice try
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]

oh
this place right here the feeling of
being here is
indescribable you feel like a
tiny ant walking along the backs of
sleeping giants
[Music]
[Laughter]
[Music]
[Applause]
ready the goods
straight from the mountains
you go first
really
tastes like poland right
night cap
sleep well after this that's the truth
all right
this was to be our last day on the trail
and this
is the view we woke up to
you know mountains have this uncanny
ability to cast
spells on you
[Music]
[Music]
there was just one more surprise
awaiting us at the end of the trailer
[Music]
hi everybody i'm finally back from my
mountain trek
here in the rodney mountains it was
beautiful refreshing revitalizing
that trail leads on for another 40
kilometers or so
and i only did a small part of it but
what a beautiful place
as you've probably figured out by now
i'm currently in romania which is my
favorite european country now traveling
during covert times
is of course not easy or obvious so for
me personally it involves a lot of
regular covert testing pcr testing as
well as
slow slow and regional travel sir i'm in
romania for about
six weeks bringing you a series of
videos about the country's beautiful
culture
traditions places and people the next
video coming up
is about living with a shepherd family
high up in the mountains
of the wild region of madame
anyway i hope you enjoyed the series and
i can't wait to see you
in the next vlog
[Music]
you
