hey guys today I want to share a story
with you that's a little bit more
personal see when I was just a little
girl I had this dream this fantasy and
it wasn't like the dreams and fantasies
of any other little girls that I knew
because I wanted really badly to find
myself on a desert island somewhere
really far and really remote and really
isolated like Robinson Crusoe I guess
sailing across the ocean only to find
himself completely alone in the middle
of nowhere away from pretty much the
entire world now this was just a
childhood dream so I forgot about it and
vari the way well I did until today
because today I find myself in a pretty
special place a pretty remote island
very isolated from the rest of the world
and civilization in a remote part of the
Gulf of Aden between Somalia and Yemen
lies the secretive island of Sumatra
until today it's one of the world's
hardest to reach places
I came here for two weeks camping and
with almost no electricity or connection
to the outside world I feel like I got
to know the island and its people quite
well this is what I've been like
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
now I know this is quite a lot for an
isolated desert island but I want us to
go back to day seven because it was day
seven that truly changed my perspective
on what it means to be a modern day
Robin zone cruiser my boat is just ready
now so I think we should get going shall
we let's go right over there
Nick what do you expect from this my
childhood fantasies of Robinson Crusoe
being around the world are about to come
true we're actually on our way to show a
beach a really remote part of the island
there's someone living there that I
really want you to meet but in the
meantime bye for now
has happened everywhere
founded hoppin surrounded section my
very first time seeing dolphins in real
life though I practically cried on it
the beauty of this Islands just never
ceases to amaze me in fact it only
strengthened my vision of how amazing
[Music]
there's someone really quite special
I suppose most people would call this a
beach paradise perfect for relaxing
swimming and sunbathing but actually to
some it's home yep this is a house and I
really want to take you inside this is
the real Robinson Crusoe
mr. homage of Socotra by most standards
you would consider Hamid a hermit he
lives on his own on this beautiful
sweeping beach isolated from the rest of
the island
not sure about garage
oh hey Noah right I saw with it okay
ready - with it - tell your luck with
you I found today
oh I learned a guy yet but Hamlet hasn't
only built this house he's had to fix
and rebuild it many times over the years
even the ceilings here are made out of
driftwood which is covered with bits of
fabric to prevent rain from getting
inside the shelter it's a pretty modest
life but the room that Hamid is most
proud of is the guest room which is
perched up against the giant rock oh my
god
why dish yeah
oh my god nobody here a
Oh Maria Matt wha the surprising thing
is that Hamid is just the most gracious
host and welcomed us to his home with
the most amazing feast see he lives here
not out of choice but out of necessity
for his goats and for his work as a
fisherman but he loves to have guests
around that nobody though he insists
that he doesn't get lonely up there he
seemed really happy to have us around
[Music]
after spending a whole day with Hamid
and talking to him about his life
I experienced a bit of a reality check
to be honest with you guys in reality
this is not an easy life at all this is
not the kind of life where you get to
live and relax on an island and stare
out at the sky and the sunset every day
that's just a fantasy that Hollywood has
sold us in reality people living alone
in places like this have it really tired
it's no fantasy life involves a lot of
hard work and none of the romantic
solitude that we sometimes fantasize
about being surrounded by people all the
time I think that childhood fantasy that
I once had it's not quite right and I
see that now and
I feel just that little bit more
grateful for the fact that I get to
choose whether I'm alone or surrounded
by people who care and
who love me in return so no Robinson
Crusoe fantasies for me anymore but we
will keep on traveling so I'll see you
in the next vlog bye
[Music]
you
