i've been planning this trip for over
two years and i can't believe it's
finally happening
i'm about to travel to afghanistan on my
own
yes the same afghanistan that you always
hear about in the news
the devastation is everywhere eight
people have been killed female
journalist was shot dead eight
kilometers away from kandahar city
the political history in afghanistan is
extremely complex and very very volatile
and it's way beyond the scope of this
travel vlog
but let me give you a couple of quick
historic facts that could help you with
the understanding of what's actually
going on here in afghanistan
afghanistan has been in a state of war
to varying degrees over the last few
decades and a big pivotal event in this
history is the 1979
soviet invasion which gave rise to a lot
of instability
all across the country and then of
course an event that you might all
remember
the 2001 american invasion
of afghanistan now the most important
key player in the politics of
afghanistan today
is the taliban a terrorist organization
responsible for
countless bloody attacks all
across the country the taliban's goal is
to take control over afghanistan and
implement a very extreme very strict
version of the islamic
sharia law so given this volatility and
all the conflict
why would anybody want to travel to
afghanistan well i hope that this series
shows you that there is a different side
to afghanistan the one that you don't
really see in the news
one that is inspiring and beautiful
where afghan people are fighting to
build
a very different kind of future for
their country but before traveling to
afghanistan i had to spend some time
preparing for my trip all right i've
just come out here with
nina my friend who's from syria so what
are we doing right now
oh we're bang them
basically a safety um outfit
so i need to be wearing an abaya for
most of my time in afghanistan
and also ideally a hijab which is a head
covering we will teach you how to do
that
after 10 days of self-quarantining in
istanbul and two coveted tests
i was finally ready to pop up
this is where the journey finally begins
i'm just in
the taxi on my way to istanbul airport
here we are this is the airport and i'm
about to say goodbye
to istanbul and turkey
[Music]
oh my god i'm so excited i feel like my
anxiety levels and excitement levels
are going up to a degree i haven't
experienced in a really really long time
or if there's just the fact that i'm
going to afghanistan where i've been
wanting to go to for
years i was there almost boarding
just arrived at the airport in kabul and
i'm about to go through immigration
and this is probably a good point to
blend in a little bit more
[Music]
i'm finally through immigration my
passport has been stamped
i'm officially
[Music]
they'll be helping me and taking me
around not just kabul
but afghanistan in general
so cool what's the safety situation for
tourists coming to afghanistan
for tourists the safety is not so bad
so because the tourists are is always
moving
so it's not staying in one place a
diplomat
or a person who is working in
afghanistan for
he cannot come to to to this place
as we as a tourist do because he's not
allowed
because when he people know him very
well when he come out
he has to be careful but tourist
low profile you gave them the local
clothes going
low profile cars that's
not so bad for toys
so yeah but taliban
as everywhere at the countryside on the
big
roads if we travel to other provinces
there is
big risk and there could be tolerant
checkpoint
so that's why we use most of the
destination
flight not by road
compared to tourists how would you say
is the safety situation for
normal people living in afghanistan yeah
normal people uh also have uh
concern when we are like traveling to to
another province
we are not using our uh
android phones with what has
and so we have we don't use we don't
take our documents what has that
if you have official documents that show
that we are working for government
for international organizations so we
are very careful
so we we we are local clothes we don't
go
with the genes and this so still it's
it's a challenge for afghans
but afghans knows how to
all right here we are look at that gate
there's no sign no sign that this is
uh only they receive a
guessed through emails through wow
advanced booking is that for safety
reasons yeah so this is
why we are here wow look at that
two gates i think this is the first time
that i've seen security this tight in a
guest house
oh welcome to my crib this is my room
but i'm not staying here very long
actually i just need to quickly get
changed into an abaya which is
a long black cloak to blend in even
a little bit more i mean kabul is not
the safest of cities in the world
in fact it suffers from regular
terrorist attacks
usually by the taliban and so
you know even though tourists aren't
usually targeted it's always good to
just
err on the side of caution
all right and here is the headscarf
which is the finishing touch
all right and this is
the final look done let's go
today ghul and i are planning to just
walk around kabul and get to know its
streets and its markets a little bit
better
and i am super super curious what it's
going to be like because i have
so many expectations because i've been
meaning to come here for such a long
time
and i'm just curious to see if those
expectations
will match up to what kabul is really
[Music]
like
[Music]
just randomly found ourselves in a music
shop where these guys make
instruments by hand one and a half
months used to make
one
you've just entered a kite shop you may
associate
afghanistan with um kites a little bit
if you've come across the novel
the kite runner by um hosseini probably
one of the most
famous books about afghanistan my hobby
i love every village every street of all
children love guiding and waiting for
the season
so love
[Music]
that is a kite with two messies
on it
since we're in a kite shop in kabul
offered to teach me how to fly a kite in
his house
so we're going to choose a couple of
kites here and then later on today
we're going to play
[Music]
so you can control it
[Music]
it's ready really perfect
so this is a bone fixing doctor
apparently i don't know if i need any
bones fixed but i'm gonna go inside and
check it out this is you
really oh wow look at you
amazing good tell me what do they do
here
what what happens in this little shop so
the
this shop it's a boom
so they come here traditionally
different cities
wow and why would someone come here and
not go to the hospital
so this is from a
long time ago from so people used to
also they are very experts
on this okay people believe
so if i had a broken bone could this
gentleman fix it yes
in case you guys ever need a bone fix
just come out here to kabul
[Music]
you know what i've read about this bird
market in so
many books about kabul and about
afghanistan that it feels completely
surreal to actually
be here for real and see it with my own
eyes and it's exactly
exactly how i picture it
[Music]
walking through the bird market honestly
is an experience
unto itself there's birds absolutely
everywhere you hear them you see them
you smell them
never been to a place like this
insanity
[Music]
is taking me to probably the oldest cafe
in kabul
17 yes
[Music]
ah that's why this is my first
cup of proper afghan tea here in kabul
cheers
[Music]
oh it's so delicious super fresh sweet
amazing
this here is a local bakery with
a beautiful tan door right there
this is like an actual little factory
line so
there's a boy here who needs to go
into little balls there's another guy
there who rolls it in some flour and
then passes it on to
this guy who molds it into a beautiful
little bread and he passes on to the
back
that guy who then does something else i
don't know exactly what he does and then
that guy passes to that guy but then
puts it in the tandoor and then the last
guy passes it on
to the guy who sells the bread
on street level amazing it's a whole
system it's beautiful simple efficient
fresh bread
okay honestly i don't know how this
happened but here we are
dressed up in these beautiful clothes
all of us
doing a little photo shoot at the
queen's palace
just because welcome to kabul
so tell me about this area okay so i
live in this park
around there so i remember
20 years back when i we were coming to
this
hill and this this part was
all green agriculture trees
but after the taliban gone
so this place now become houses it was
all builded
in 20 15 years
and now there's no land left no
agriculture
you don't recognize it no no i i
remember
the green how green it was but not
anymore
[Music]
it's been a really really long day of
walking and exploring the city but we
have just arrived here
in front of ghoul's house where we're
gonna try and
fly some kites and have dinner let's go
after ages do you still remember it
yeah i'll try
is it ready
all right
[Music]
rules of this game what's going on
so now we have to find someone to fight
i have just learned that the purpose of
flying a kite
is to make it a battle with another kite
so you have to find another kite
somewhere up at this guy
and to fly into it and fight with it for
the domination of the sky he's an expert
and it looks very very hard so i don't
know if i'm gonna be trying out
it's like a hundred meters away
how far can it go as long as
oh there's a tree in the way
we have one more kite only so we gotta
make this one count
here we go again
future
check that out there's an actual battle
happening in the sky right now
i don't know who's winning no idea
what's going on
but something's happening
[Laughter]
oh no
oh there it is no
[Music]
sorry
i told ghoul that i was vegetarian and i
didn't expect
that his wonderful family and the ladies
and his family would cook
an all vegetarian feast but it's all
vegetarians that can eat everything
that's amazing
oh my god what a day it's been and i
can't believe i still cannot believe i'm
here
in kabul afghanistan one of like my top
travel dreams
finally coming true it's not like what i
imagined it would be
it's much more lively and colorful and
vivid and i felt more relaxed
than i thought i would and definitely
very welcomed i mean everybody who got
to know the fact that i'm a tourist was
extremely hospitable and welcoming
and i think a lot of that is due to the
fact that i had an amazing guide who
knows
everything about the city ghoul i mean i
really owe this trip to him
and i know it's not the same if you live
here or if you're
afghan yourself but as a tourist which
is the only
role that i can speak of so far it's
just been
heartwarming and so much more
incredible and rewarding than i expected
i'm ecstatic to be here and this is only
the beginning
of my afghanistan stories there's so
much more
to come and i cannot wait to share
this beautiful country with you from my
traveler's perspective
all right see i i knew it i've been
telling you all along
i've been telling you all along the
world that belongs to the brave
alright i hope you enjoyed this tour of
kabul keep exploring
and i'll see you in the next video
[Music]
