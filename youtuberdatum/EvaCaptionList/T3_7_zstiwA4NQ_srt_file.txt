[Music]
but apparently this is like a whole body
makeover
and a little bit too much chai feels
pretty sharp lately
[Music]
hey guys ava here i am in bangladesh
in the region of silhead which is a
beautiful
lush natural and very tribal part
of the country in fact i'll be spending
the next 24 hours
living with one of the tribes here in
silhead
right now i'm here with mike in a cng
which is basically like
a local tuk-tuk that's what it looks
like and we're on our way
to the manipuri tribe the manipuri
also known as the mete are an ethnic
group with their own language
history and traditions while most of
them live in india
there is a small manapuri community in
bangladesh too
a local guesthouse owner invited us to
come over for a couple of days
and learn about his culture
[Music]
i'm here with raju in his homestay in
major gown magical
and these are some of the kids that live
here
let's go and they're amazing musicians
raj is just about to show me into the
village and
we're gonna have a little walk around
one of the best things about my life and
work as a travel vlogger
is visiting places like this remote
areas with their own distinctive culture
and people who are so proud of their
heritage
well i was about to experience a very
different and much more competitive side
of the manipuri culture than expected
the manipuri's have a special
traditional game that they play
they only play it on special traditional
occasions we're very lucky
this is one of them that out auditorium
over there this
is where several teams are currently
playing kang shanaba
also known as the game of life
the competition was raging and i was
about to join
one of the games just ended and i've
just been invited to play a little round
of the game
i don't really know what the rules are
still i can't figure it out i'm not sure
what the strategy is but
i'm gonna give it a shot okay like that
like that
and then with a bit of momentum like
this
yeah okay one last two
that was terrible one more time then
bending of the body
bending over the entire body
finally figured out how to hold the kang
okay
now i throw it
so i think this is the professional move
keep yeah
thank you
[Music]
the manaforts take this game really
really seriously this is not just the
local tournament
that team over there came all the way
from india just to compete
in this tiny little village in the
middle of
bangladesh i made a couple of friends
during the tournament and they
whisked me away to their village home
for a very different kind of experience
so i just randomly found myself in
someone's house in the middle of the
village
and there was a girl sleeping here when
we came in just on this bed
we come in and she gets up and
apparently i'm gonna get the
chandon printed uh painted on my
forehead it's like the
the bindi but it's a little bit more
complex and more beautiful and more
ornate
i'm not really sure what's happening and
where we are but just go with the flow
money for your style
ah so you go into this rather wide and
large skirt
they wrap it around
i feel like i'm being a woman handled so
super super wide then you wrap it around
your face
[Music]
it doesn't fit the ultra wide skirt
doesn't fit
i'm wearing a panic and i'm about to put
on a
all right
[Music]
i think the lady does not approve maybe
it's because it's too small for me
okay that's beautiful
[Music]
it's like i've got purple i've got red
i've got blue i've got
yellow and green i'm a rainbow in this
but apparently this is like a whole body
makeover
getting a new hairstyle too
this hair not good not good
[Music]
[Music]
feels pretty sharp
but definitely feels like uh it's taken
very very seriously here like it's an
art
[Music]
alright let's take a look oh wow that's
so beautiful
now i can see why she was trying to make
it so precise
because the lines here i mean so
beautiful and geometric
thank you so much they're back at the
tournament this time
all dressed up and uh these guys
seem to be quite proud showing me around
i'm quite proud to be here in this dress
definitely feeling a bit more like part
of the crowd right now
[Music]
looks like this game is gonna go on for
another three hours so i think
we better get out of here the real
question is how many people can you fit
in a tuk-tuk
cng in bengali and
the answer is this many six
[Music]
okay i'm back in my normal clothes now a
little bit more comfortable and
practical
and we're here in this tiny little
vegetable village where we're staying
with
a local manipore family and we're just
about to stop making dinner
it's pretty amazing these guys don't
cook using gas or electricity or coals
or anything like that this is
a proper traditional wood
powered oven that's kind of like in the
ground we're cooking
right over the open fire
food tastes better when it's made with
love and care and simplicity like this
that's just my theory
this part of the kitchen we're making
something a little bit different this is
it
this is a digestive juice made from one
of the herbs that grow just outside the
kitchen
and we're gonna finish our dinner with
a nice sip of this magic potion
and this right here is the result of our
cooking session this is a true feast
with like
seven or eight different dishes and this
entire table this entire setup is called
the thali which basically means that
there's
a whole bunch of different tiny little
dishes that you mix and match
and you eat a bit of everything in the
company
of great friends and hosts right here in
a tiny little village of the manipuri
tribe
in silent bangladesh let's get started
[Music]
spicy here in bangladesh you don't
really eat with
using cutlery like spoons and forks and
knives that kind of thing
you eat using these your fingers your
hands
so what you do is you take a look at
this rice
you mash it up a little bit with your
fingers
form it into a little ball add a little
bit of sauce
all right ready and then you just pop it
in your mouth
simple for me eating with your hands is
like the best way to connect with your
food
i don't know if it's scientifically
proven that it makes food taste better
but i think it does amazing this is
super delicious
everything about this meal is really
fresh and really really local
and to finish off the meal we've got
this refreshing drink that was made out
of a herb whose name that
we don't know we only know the name in
sylheti no in manipuri in the manipuri
language
uh but not in english and not even in
bengali
so hopefully this aids in the digestion
of this
huge feast that we just had
oh it's a little bit spicy really
refreshing
kind of sweet perfect
it's like a tiny little dessert after
dinner
our host raju invited over a few local
kids to teach us
a very important manipuri skill
apparently um we're learning to dance
i am the world's worst dancer because i
am
the least coordinated person on the
planet but
we can do this
[Music]
please
[Music]
[Laughter]
you're laughing at me not with me
hers is like a beautiful bird is
flying in between her lovely hands and
mine is just like i'm
trying to knead a piece of dough
the next morning came and the villagers
slowly came back to life again
on my last morning with the manapuri
community raja took me to a neighbor's
home
where a local lady was busy weaving a
scarf or a dupatta
on a traditional loom
[Music]
this is pretty painstaking and extremely
extremely detailed work on a machine
that's really complex and very
traditional
apparently girls learn this craft from a
very early age so it's not that you do
an apprenticeship you're simply taught
how to work a machine like this from the
very beginning a single dupatta like
this
that's being made right behind me takes
about two
days two days of hard work
[Music]
it's been a year since this trip but i
still find myself thinking about the
beautiful nature and diverse cultures of
bangladesh
travel is a wonderful tool for
self-development and growth
but only if you open yourself up to new
experiences
and people whose lives look very
different to yours
and i know that if i could return to
silhet i would go back
in a heartbeat
[Music]
you
