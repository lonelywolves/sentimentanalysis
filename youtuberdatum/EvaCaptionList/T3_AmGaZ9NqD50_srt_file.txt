imagine living in a country where music
is forbidden where women
are not allowed to sing where
celebrations of all kinds are prohibited
where dancing is taboo where even
clapping is seen
as immoral this was the reality of most
afghans living under taliban rule
between 1996 and 2001.
today the extremist group which needs
very little introduction
still controls parts of the country and
these are the rules they continue to
impose on people but there are places in
afghanistan where things are a little
bit more relaxed and where singing
dancing or clapping
won't land you in prison this is the
region of bamiyan and today we are
celebrating the persian new year
or no rules as it's better known here
it's a pretty big deal
in so many different cultures across
central asia
let's get ready on my very first day in
afghanistan i bought myself
this dress and this scarf thinking that
definitely at some point during my trip
they will come in handy
i was actually just lying to myself that
was just an excuse to buy some nice
dresses but actually it turns out
that there is an occasion today
we're celebrating story
which is a very special day to celebrate
the persian new year so i'm gonna put on
this dress
in preparation for a little party that
we're hosting
tonight it's a traditional dress it's so
nice
[Music]
all right i'm gonna need a pin to hold
this down
next step some makeup so
here's the thing i actually only own
three items of makeup
and that is an eyebrow pencil a mouse is
called
an eyeliner and a powder so let's see
what we can do with these
the wrong spot i'm not very good at this
as you can see
eyebrows done i guess onto the eyeliner
[Music]
all right fancy
[Music]
the masterpiece is finished oh no
face powder
[Music]
one last thing these beautiful afghan
[Music]
earrings
[Music]
i wasn't sure what to expect of this
evening but two years ago i celebrated
jaharshan bisuri in iran
the part of the celebration that
everybody no matter their age
waited for was jumping over a fire
fire jumping isn't super popular in
afghanistan but i really hoped we could
give it a go
so what do you think
[Music]
good you're beautiful local beautiful
compliments all around that's exactly
what i wanted
where i'm from parties don't begin with
tea usually but with
beer or wine but as you know in
afghanistan there is no booze so there
is tea
cheers
and the music has started i think the
party is officially
on don't worry at this point we're still
just warming up but things are going to
get a lot more fun
i promise so no ruse or the persian new
year
it's one of the most important
celebrations for people living across
asia since ancient times nowruz has been
celebrated on the first day of spring
the tuesday before the new year marks
chaha chandesuri
which is what we're celebrating today
let's get on with the party
how many men does it take to make a
single fire
you're four yeah
at the moment there will be more even
just a casual bottle with
[Music]
gasoline
this is how you make a fire
[Music]
do
[Music]
okay we've just paused the party for a
few minutes do you know why
i don't know if you can hear it but the
azan has come on that is the call to
prayer
in islamic culture and religion so out
of respect
we have turn of the music for just a few
minutes
and then we'll resume
three
[Music]
but of course there's also food it's not
all about dancing and music
food is one of the most important parts
of the persian new year
[Music]
[Music]
so
wow what is this
[Laughter]
i've got to tell you afghans take their
kebabs very seriously
every celebration whether it's a wedding
or the new year
must absolutely involve some sort of
barbecued meat on a stick
what do we have here so we have here
a salad fruit kebab i think rice and
other more is coming wow nice
yeah we have two kind of cabba
i think it's it's lamb and chicken
nice i'm vegetarian
but you should once just one
tonight is suspicious yeah really don't
miss this
yeah.com
okay they say i have to not be
vegetarian today so
yeah i'm so sorry animals
just response it's really good
[Music]
there's only one way to digest all this
food and that's
with a bit of singing a bit of dancing
and a bit of fire jumping
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
there is one more essential part of
every single nowruz celebration
you really can't do persian new year
without it it's jumping over the fire
so when i was in iran celebrating the
rules two years ago
we did this pretty much the entire night
jumping over the fire in the persian
year symbolizes leaving behind all the
bad all the
negative things that happened to you in
the previous year
and jumping into a more positive happy
joyful new year so
shall we
[Music]
wow and this is the end of our
nowruz celebrations or more specifically
happy persian new year
[Music]
