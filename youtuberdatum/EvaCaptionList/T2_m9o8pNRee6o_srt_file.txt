hi you know we haven't actually talked
in a while
well i mean we talk right every time i
publish a video
we talk and you get to know what's going
on and you get to see all the cool
adventures that i go on but
i haven't told you about my life in such
a long time and i don't just
adventure all the time that's not my
life all the time it's just days like
this where there's not much going on and
all i want to do is just
tell you a little bit about my life and
what's been changing and what's been
going on because there's been so
much so this vlog is exactly about that
a little bit about my life
a little bit about updates a little bit
about nothing much
first let me tell you that i've been
walking barefoot a lot over the last
year
and it's one of the best things i've
done for myself
in a long long time and second
as you've probably figured out from my
other vlogs
i'm in romania i was meant to be here
for like
a hole in my shirt oh my god i was meant
to be here for
um three or four weeks i have been here
now for over a month and i just
i can't seem to leave i really love this
place
you know over the last month i've been
staying in places like this like old
style traditional homes
and been staying like away from the city
in villages
out in nature in places where i can just
like lay down the grass
i feel like this is the life that i've
been trying to build myself
for quite a while now
[Music]
let me show you around this place and
let's talk some more
i am in some remote part of romania
called bucovina
it's close to the borders with moldova
and ukraine if that tells you anything
at all
and this is our place
[Music]
hey hi my name is mike
you probably know me
[Music]
i guess that has been the biggest change
i'm not really traveling so much alone
anymore i'm traveling
with mike we're traveling together and
that's been a huge
adjustment for someone who used to
always travel alone but now
with the pandemic and all it's just
risky because
if you split up you run the risk that
you know a country might change its
travel restrictions or regulations and
you might get
separated for a while like what happened
when i ended up spending three months
on a remote island in yemen that's
the price you pay i guess for even being
able to travel in the first place
but for someone who yeah traveled solo
all the time
like i love exploring places by myself i
love spending time alone
i really relish it so it's been
it's been a huge adjustment the beam
that the camera's
currently standing on right now is 200
years old
let me show you this one 200 years old
been staying here for a few days and
it's been like
going back in time apparently this house
used to belong to like
a middle-class family 150 years ago
[Music]
oh yeah i have a massive massive life
update for you but i'll
share that with you in a couple minutes
first
i want you to meet someone really
special
this is this is for them
this is lola lola is the community dog
that's what they call her she's a bit of
a stray
but she's this huge romanian shepherd
dog
who's always just hanging around here
and making friends especially
friends that bring her food this is
another thing that's been kind of
changing in my mind lately
i've been had this idea stuck in my head
of
getting a dog not just a dog but like a
house
and a garden and a dog and a horse and
settling down i've been traveling for
two and a half years and i think that's
kind of the crux of the issue
is that traveling for two and a half
years living out of my suitcase not
really returning anywhere just really
being on the road full time and
the grass is always greener on the other
side let me put you down on the table
here
yeah like humans humans feel a lot of
things
right i feel a lot of things we often
feel a lot of conflicting things and
sometimes i don't know which feeling to
believe the continued sense of like
wonderlust and wanting to travel or like
this new sense of oh i want to build
myself a tiny little home
how do you distinguish between what it
is that you really want
maybe you can help me maybe you can
share some of your wisdom
[Music]
oh look at this guy
he is a slug
[Music]
this next one is a pretty significant
life update
and let me just grab this stuff real
quick
so when i made this public on instagram
people were like
oh so does this mean that you're
settling down that you're no longer
going to travel that you're just going
to stay in
poland and i was like actually no it
means kind of the opposite
but it's a big deal because i have never
owned
a car sorry i've never owned a car
before
this is my very first car and his name
is stefan he is a
17 year old ford focus and the most
ordinary car you'll ever see in your
life
that's why i love him i bought him for
like
some ridiculously low amount of money
and everybody told me
that i need to repair him over and over
and over again but so far so good we've
driven like 10 000 kilometers together
he's doing well they're fun
anyway a couple of small things about
the car
here's the thing about stefan stefan is
a manual
transmission car now while i did pass my
driving test on a manual transmission
i found it absolutely traumatizing and
terrifying and i just couldn't do it so
for years
after passing my test i would only drive
automatic cars there was just
no way that i would drive a manual
but when it came to buying a car
i didn't really have much of a choice
there aren't that many automatic
used and well-priced and affordable
automatic cars
around where i was buying one so i had
to get it
manual transmission and kind of overcome
that
fear that phobia and just learn to drive
manual i did it this was like a typical
kind of like irrational fear you know
like an insecurity like an anxiety like
something that just
you are worried about it concerned about
it and then it just keeps growing and
growing and growing until you get to a
point where like you're completely like
unable to do it i had to ask for help
and i asked two really good friends to
help me out with driving manual they
knew how to drive manual so they would
always sit
in the car next to me as i drove and
they would help me
in like a really peaceful way now
stephan and i are best buddies and i can
drive manual
so it's possible i think a lot of us
have these
anxieties and insecurities but it's
really great
to seek out people who can help us
overcome them
because we can overcome them
so
[Music]
please don't ask me how i got those
shots it was
probably illegal don't do it at home
[Music]
oh my god
oh he's so cute
hey baby horse
what is this what that
is so cool i am completely alone here
there's not a sound just me talking
and birds singing no wind
nothing just me alone in this
weird magical abandoned place in the
middle of the forest
and that gate looks like the door to
narnia i mean
go and check it out
i don't know if i should be scared or
intrigued
[Music]
oh should i go oh there is no like
bridge there is just this oh there's a
little bridge oh my god
it's so cool
this is it the gate
to the forest or maybe the gate to some
alternate universe i don't really
believe in magic but this
place is so surreal it's in the middle
of the forest in the middle of nowhere
there's nobody around it's perfectly
silent
and there's just this gate so i guess
i'm gonna walk through it and see what
happens
all right let's go
okay i'm still in the same place
[Music]
so
[Music]
you know i think a lot of us are a bit
scared of the forest
i personally get the creeps every time i
go into a forest and i'm alone
it's not a place that makes you feel
comfortable
i think it's so huge and so vast
and so primeval
that it fills you with a sense of
something that you just don't know and
you can't recognize
[Music]
you kind of have to tune into it
[Music]
all right let's talk let's really talk
i know this year has not been easy it
has been
a major roller coaster for everybody for
you
for me for everybody around us and
everybody experienced it slightly
differently
i got to spend the lockdown on a remote
island in yemen
which was an experience that in equal
parts enlightened
and traumatized but you know since i
came back
what i've been seeing in this new
pandemic world is
there's a bit of a new way in which
people relate to each other and that's
scary
i see people not trusting others i see
huge amounts of tension on social media
i don't want to be the person that sees
a stranger and suspects them of being
sick of being of having this disease
that they will
infect me with i don't want to do that
that's not the world i want to live in
i want to look at a stranger and
imagine their story and i don't have an
antidote
i don't have an antidote i don't know
what will happen next for those of us
who don't want to see
a world that is full of negativity and
suspicion
i think we need to find something new
and i i've just been working on
something really small but
really meaningful and that's kindness
i've been really trying very consciously
and very hard
to become a kind of person every day and
i don't mean kind in the sense that
you know donating to charity that's
great but that's not the only thing i
mean
being kind being generous
with your time with your attention
with your judgment of others giving
people
the benefit of the doubt finding points
of commonality with other people i don't
know if that's the cure but
i think kindness could be the cure for
what's coming next which is
a slightly different kind of world i
think now more than ever
kindness is the most important value
you can aspire to anyway
let me take you back to the hotel and
tell you
what's coming up next for me let's go
[Music]
so what's next now that's a fantastic
question
and the question that i wish i had an
answer to see if you asked me this time
last year what's next i would be able to
tell you with the
precision of to the day almost what's
happening for the next six months
now who knows what's going to happen in
the next two weeks
will i continue to do travel vlogging
hell yes
i will continue to do my best to tell
the stories of people and places for as
long as i can
as widely as i possibly can where will i
be
next month i have no clue i was meant to
be somewhere in siberia right about now
clearly i'm not there are plans that we
try and make and
in these times it's very very difficult
to stick to them because they're simply
out of our control so much of the time
especially for someone who travels for a
living
i just don't know what's going to happen
it's beyond my control in many ways
so the only advice i can give to myself
and maybe that's something you might
feel is good for you as advice as well i
don't know
it doesn't matter but advice that i'll
take for myself is
these days create as many plans as
possible
be flexible love them all but stick to
none
because you just never know what's going
to happen i'll continue to make travel
videos i promise
i can't wait to share more of this crazy
journey with you
and remember i know it's not easy to
change plans
i know it takes guts and patience and it
takes flexibility and elasticity
in your mind remember the world belongs
to the brave this is one thing that
doesn't change i'd love to talk to you
some more
if you have any questions let me know in
the comments and
let's chat alright bye
[Music]
you
