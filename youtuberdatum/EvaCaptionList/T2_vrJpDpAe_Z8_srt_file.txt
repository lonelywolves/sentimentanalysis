hi everybody
ava here i recently started to learn one
of the most
useful universal and underrated
skills that you can have as a human
being and that's the skill
of making a fire honestly this is a
skill that we simply
don't teach to people anymore and
especially not
to girls now i'm not really very good at
making fires yet
and sometimes i find the process of it
absolutely
infuriating but today i'm going to share
with you how to make a fire using only
natural materials no fire starter
nothing like that
both inside and outside and honestly i
think it's one of the coolest skills
i have ever acquired
if you take a look around me you'll see
that i'm in an actual real-life
situation where i need to make
fire to keep me warm so over the last
week i've been staying
right here in this traditional
centuries-old
cottage up on the mountainside in
romania
and it's been gloomy and cold and
raining for the last couple of days
there's no central heating here nothing
like that only
an actual stove that needs some manual
fire making in order to get it to work
so before it gets too chilly in here
today i'm gonna
dive right into the fire making
[Music]
the first challenge that we're coming
across here is that it has been raining
these last few days so everything is
soaked wet and obviously in order to
start a fire you need dry wood that's
like the first priority
luckily there is a little wood shed
right next to the house so that's where
i can get
my dry wood from
[Music]
apart from the cobwebs and stuff this
shed is actual goals
because look at how much firewood there
is here
enough to last you like an entire season
making a fire actually takes a fair
amount of planning it's not as easy as
it seems
so in order to do it successfully you
need to make sure that you prepare all
of your materials in advance
so that when you're there next to the
stove or next to the
fire pit you can actually just focus 100
on the fire lighting process itself so
while i'm here in the shed i'm going to
pick out a
bunch of chunks of wood of different
sizes making sure that they're super dry
so i'll grab a few large chunks a few
medium-sized chunks
and if i can't find any tiny chunks then
i'll get those as well
i like to sort my pieces of wood into
four different sizes because when i
start lighting the fire
i'm gonna have to start with these tiny
little bits of wood
before moving on gradually to these
bigger
chunks right here but the thing is i
mostly have these big
chunks that's usually how firewood comes
so i'm gonna have to chop them up and
make more of these tiny small little
fire lighting pieces and i'm gonna show
you how to do that safely
just now you know people sometimes seem
to have this like
lumberjack fantasy where they think that
in order to chop up chunks of wood
you need like a massive axe and like a
checkered shirt
you don't need any of those things i
mean for most women
and girls for me for most people who
don't have so much physical strength
or training and using dangerous tools
like an axe or saw
there's a trick you can actually just
use a knife
like this to chop up big chunks of wood
you're going to need three items for
this the piece of wood that you want to
chop
up a knife and a hammer
or basically any item that you can use
as kind of leverage that you can
you know hit the knife with to give it a
little bit more strength and power
so let's get to work grab the chunk of
wood that you want to be
cutting up and make sure they position
it vertically so that the
sort of ridges that you see here are
kind of aligned
with your knife then
position your knife on top
whichever way is comfortable grab your
hammer
bang on the knife all right here we go
and that is the wood being chopped up by
a knife
alone done as easy
[Music]
we're nowhere near done yet though
there's one more really important thing
that you're going to need and that is
some sort of
tinder bundle something that lights up
real easy and that's gonna basically
turn your tiny little
spark from your match or your lighter
into a baby flame and then help spread
it over the small pieces
of wood and that can be either something
natural like
um birch bark which bends really easily
or paper which is what i'm gonna use
[Music]
i'm afraid that this next part is where
it gets a little bit harder now of
course you can make your life
really easy for yourself buy some
lighter fluid douse the wood in it
and kaboom you've got a massive fire
right there but that's not why we're
here
so for this next part you're gonna need
a couple of things
one number one patience
which i have zero off
and two tp building skills
let's go
[Music]
ah
[Music]
all right now i'm going to carefully
start adding the bigger
pieces of firewood sort of fuel wood
that's going to keep the fire burning
for much much longer
but you want to make sure that your
teepee shape is still
going allowing that air to flow in and
out
there we go ah shoot too many sparks
come on come on
this must be like one of the best
feelings ever is to
have this beautiful fire going in your
home
on a cold day so you can warm your hands
in front of it
have a cup of tea ready fires are rude
magical things
[Music]
hmm
[Music]
so
[Music]
when i take all these lessons on board i
kind of start to realize that
the process of learning how to make a
fire for me
personally has been a lot more than just
about
making physical fires actually for me
it's been a lot about learning to be
more patient and more meticulous and
paying
more attention to detail and that's a
really great
skill to have maybe even more important
than
the skill of fire making thank you so
much everybody for
watching this vlog i hope that it
inspired you to pick up some new skills
whether it be
fire making or something entirely
different that you've been wanting to
pick up for a while
remember the world belongs to the brave

yet then make sure that you
do and in the meantime i'll see you in
the next vlog
