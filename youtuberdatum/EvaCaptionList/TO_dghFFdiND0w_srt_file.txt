you see in this part of the world they
say that only two things in life have no
moves War and Polo
[Music]
welcome to the ancestral home of polo
played on the highest polar ground in
the world
I'm here with wild frontiers in Shandor
northern Pakistan at an altitude of
3,800 meters the air is crisp and the
atmosphere electric as the crowd begins
to gather for the most awaited event of
the year the Shandor polo hazard
[Music]
this high-altitude tournament brings
together two teams from opposite sides
of northern Pakistan who have
traditionally competed against one
another
the gilgit East and the chippy rallies
whatever their differences may be they
both agree that the game of polo was
originally invented right here in
Central Asia over two millennia ago and
nothing written as many seem to believe
and it's still here that polo is played
in its original rule-free form they call
it freestyle polo and that's what
[Music]
[Music]
to me the most beautiful thing about the
festival was the sense of pride and joy
I got to see in people's eyes to them
the rivalry between gilgit and Chitral
is real very real there seemingly no end
to the celebration bands come all the
way out here to perform traditional
music from Chitra and gilgit-baltistan
and dances from the audience
join in the music expressing their joy
at every single triumph then some of the
performances are a bit of a shock this
is a traditional sword dance native to
these northern reaches of Pakistan and
yes it does look pretty risky and
dangerous to me too after witnessing
that's epic festival I just wanted to
share my impression without again I've
just arrived at the campsite of wild
frontiers they're one of the very first
original companies that have been
bringing international tourists right
here to Pakistan and I want to talk to
some of their guests
hi I'm dead so tell me about your
experience I did a lot of traveling the
past I'm from the UK and I've traveled
Paolo in India and I wanted to come and
see if I could stop I wanna see the
whole other side of the mountain it's
such a beautiful place
family on absolutely and then you go
and it's as crazy
yeah really really amazing I'm not again
and then how are the people how's the
food how are all these things everyone's
so friendly and people you me they're so
happy to see people yeah the consul's I
thank you for coming
another part of their country and you
know what all the other international
guests I spoke to shared Jays
impressions they absolutely loved the
culture and the people here and we're
better to meet the people in the culture
then at the mighty Shandor
bazaar this was my next mini destination
at the festival I wanted to see the
people who came all the way across not
just the north but sometimes the whole
country just to take part in the
celebration and make some business on
the side too the most important thing
the food from desserts like freshly
fried jalebis to rice dishes like Palau
and biryani from all parts of Pakistan
after all for is something that unites
us all doesn't it and in Pakistan
especially it takes such an important
place in the culture and the community
here ie you just can't say no
fresh shorty straight from that tandoor
right here it's hot crispy and soft
delicious little did I know this was
only the beginning of my foodie
adventure here at Shandor here in the
province of hammer patent quad they take
their meat really seriously and this
right here this is one of the
specialties of the area that chapli
kabob at these aromatic spices and in
this case also hello matter so I think
I'll order one of the bazaar and try it
right here the famous Chopra kebab with
a beautiful piece of freshly baked
I'm just perfect

and after all the excitement of the polo
tournament there was only one thing left
to do

captains of the chitral teams actually
