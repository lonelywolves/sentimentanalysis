[Music]
getting ready
it's amazing how many moving pieces and
elements there are
i definitely don't recommend that
is that me oh my god that is black
[Music]
oh this is good
it's a cheese pastry that's super
traditional here in albania
[Music]
and this one is fresh from the oven
but this video is not about buddhic and
it's also not about albania
in fact this video is about kosovo
a very different kind of place here is
stefan
my car and i'm about to drive from
tirana here in albania
the capital to kosovo
all by myself now kosovo is a really
interesting place because of its
geographical location and its political
status it's gone through a lot of
conflict and turmoil
in really recent years but that is not
why i'm going there
i'm going there because i found an
incredible tradition there that i would
like to try
on myself and it's got something to do
with marriage
look at that look at that look at that
fresh fruit
yes please one of my favorite things
about albania
is all the amazing fresh fruit that they
grow here such as
clementines or mandaries i'm not really
sure which
[Music]
oh my god i've just emerged into a giant
cloud
it must be so high up in the mountains
amazing it was only when i reached
kosovo a couple of hours later that i
realized just how wild and mountainous
it is here
my destination was a small village in
the south
home to a bosniak community it was here
that i would meet my host
amra and her aunt aziza who is the last
woman to preserve an ancient kosovar
tradition
right here in one of these houses
well here we are in the home of aziza
the lady who is going to
do this beautiful makeup bridal makeup
on me
i'm here with amra hi
and she brought her family along so
we're in good company and these are just
called me into
her room where she's got a big suitcase
filled with clothes
and she said i need to get changed into
the traditional outfit first
aziza helped me get dressed just like
she would help a local bride from the
kosovar bosniak community
because of how many layers and pieces
are involved complete with corsets and
undergarments
this took a little while
[Music]
this is the initial look it's nowhere
near
ready this is only part of the outfit
without the makeup which is the most
important part let's go
oh look she's the prototype
it's amazing how many moving pieces and
elements there
are and as these are made most of them
sell for their own hands
[Music]
why do women get this makeup for their
bridal makeup why this
extremely ornate look
because then when the woman come they
will say mashallah
because if you say this mashallah you
the black the bed i will not
have an impact on you so they will say
this masala masala how beautiful you are
the one who doesn't know you they will
look at you and say oh i don't know who
she is so that's why they will not
be she will not have an impact or
something to happen to her so it's
really protection against the evil eye
yes
how did she learn how to do this makeup
should i care about man
the mother of her husband learned her
how long did it take her to learn it
[Music]
don't ask me it's too
my hands were shaking are there other
women like her who still do this makeup
like as professionally as she does
no only she is
no one can do it this way what does this
face painting this makeup what does it
mean to her personally a proud one
she's very very proud about what she's
doing
and she's enjoying it here's what
happens next i'm gonna be lying down
on that little bed and aziza is going to
do
my makeup like from the top because it
involves
a lot of painting a lot of decoration a
lot a lot of work
how long is it gonna take how about one
and a half two hours
two hours just for the makeup
oh my god what am i signed up for
[Music]
okay it begins
i definitely don't recognize myself
[Music]
anymore
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
do
[Music]
what's the status update how ready do i
look
percent fifty percent yeah
[Music]
i still have no idea what i look like
and i'm not gonna look until
it's all finished the last elements
the hair so if i didn't wash this makeup
off how long would it stay on me
really four days like this four days
four days like this
okay okay next challenge yeah walk
around with this makeup for the next
four days
[Music]
i think we're almost ready it's been two
hours
okay i'm gonna go and look at myself
in the mirror for the very first time
one
two and three oh my god that's so
cool oh my god that is the coolest
thing i've ever seen in my life
[Music]
oh my god what
that is that me oh my god that is
what every single element of this
traditional outfit and every single
symbol that aziza painted on me
is imbued with deep meaning in the
bosnia kosovar culture
this is true living history all right
here we are i have changed back into my
normal outfit these are my everyday
clothes and now we're gonna
drive back to the city and we're gonna
walk around like this and see what
people think
[Laughter]
just like this yeah
what aziza does is something absolutely
beautiful and unique something that will
maybe not survive beyond her and so this
is a small way to commemorate her legacy
and the legacy
of the people that used to see this as
an important perhaps essential part of
their
lives and life's rituals
as for me i think it's time to take this
thing off
right let's go
okay warm water so
let's go
[Music]
i think i'm finally done and my skin has
never felt fresher than this moment
right here
