i want to talk to you about an industry
that contributes
10 of the world's economy an industry
that employs one in 10
people around the globe an industry
that is right now collapsing and letting
all those people down 300 million people
around the world
good morning yes this is me ava i'm
still here in romania
and i'm currently on my way to get a pcr
test
and no i'm not expecting to have covered
but i do need
a negative pcr test results because
tomorrow i'm hoping to leave romania
after two months of being here i am
moving on
and the plan is to travel to serbia
and as much as they suck it seems like
private tests oh there's a big problem
here
[Music]
as much as they suck it seems like curvy
tests
are becoming more important than
passports if you want to travel
and becoming the new norm for travellers
this is my fourth pcr test
[Music]
here we are this is the spot there's
even a line
and honestly this is probably the only
test you
ever want to fail
you probably don't want to see this so
i'm going to stop
right here ugh that's got to be one of
the
most unpleasant things you can do to
yourself these days
oh it just goes really deep
inside your soul that's how it feels
ah anyway i've got a couple more errands
to run
before i hopefully get a negative test
result and before
i can hopefully go to serbia tomorrow
and the first errand
is getting my car fixed
[Music]
and that's exactly what happens when
you're
too busy holding a camera and not paying
attention
to the real world
pumpkin spice latte
ah so good anyway i have a couple of
errands to run today
and one of them includes fixing my
headlight and getting my winter tires
for stefan
my car there's only one small problem
stefan is currently
probably winning the title for the
dirtiest car in the world
i have never watched i have never
watched him
so i'm just gonna do a quick little
clean up here
inside and hope that nobody notices i
hope that the mechanic doesn't notice of
course he will
oh my god this is terrible
[Music]
here's one other thing that's changed in
the way that we travel
as a result of the pandemic so public
transport used to be like the thing
because you could meet people
and it was environmentally friendly but
now public transport is
oh man it's like a public liability i
think sometimes you know
so having your own private car is a
really big deal because it means that
you can actually go from place to place
so i'm really glad that i've got this
guy
as old and wonky as he is
[Music]
alright this here is my new set of
winter tires
i'm really excited feels like i'm doing
something nice for my car
[Music]
all done wow that took like
20 minutes to change all the tires and
to change my light
i need to get everything ready for
tomorrow
i can't believe i'm leaving
okay i just got an email from
the lab results
19 that means cover 19 test results
ready my future depends on this
whoa negative yes that means i can go to
serbia tomorrow
big relief because honestly i was
feeling a little bit under the weather
today and i was just i started panicking
i was like oh my god what if i have
covered or something
but yeah apparently not everything
has to be covered all the time and
may it remain that way
so now that my trip to serbia is
confirmed
we're enjoying our last supper together
while watching a jennifer aniston
romcom this is my life now
look at this oh what an amazing vegan
feast
and then
these two pieces of luggage the suitcase
and the backpack
they pretty much contain my entire life
if you've been here for a while then
you'll know that i travel full-time that
means
no fixed address no home that i go back
to in between different trips
this is it traveling with your entire
life packed into
a couple of bags is actually a pretty
good strategy
[Music]
so that's a goodbye for the next two
months
we'll probably see each other in january
on another continent
but it's always hard to say goodbye
these days because with the pandemic
you don't know when you're going to see
that person
next you don't know when you're going to
see each other again and
you know for a month of being together
nonstop and traveling together
brings you really close together so
definitely bittersweet i'm excited to be
traveling
and working but
you know heart wants what it wants
[Music]
well after several hours of driving i'm
finally getting really close to the
border i think it's only two kilometers
away
so i'm gonna have to switch from using
my big camera to using my tiny little
camera
i i don't know if i can film anything at
all i don't know how it's gonna go i
don't know what they're gonna check
apart from
my passport my car documents and i guess
my
covered test results there's nobody here
the road is completely empty
[Music]
wow
[Music]
republic of serbia
i have to go out
[Music]
oh my god i just spent the last half an
hour at the border
um the border control offices were like
really
intense in their search and their
control of my documents they
looked at my documents like 10 times
they were just like browsing
through like discussing with their
colleagues checking stuff on the
internet or in their system or whatever
and it seemed like there was a problem
with my car with stefan
and they were like no this is the wrong
document you have the wrong documents
you can't cross and i was like what
no but i have the right documents i made
sure i had all the right documents
thank god she did she showed me a
picture of another document
that i just forgot i had not given them
like the most important like that the
car passport basically
i just it was just in my wallet and i
forgot to
give it to them yay i've just arrived in
belgrade i know i wasn't filming much
but i was driving so
in the dark and uh that's my hotel over
there
somewhere there anyway
oh my god i don't see it this doesn't
look like my hotel
there it is hiding behind
the post-soviet
[Music]
monstrosity
[Music]
oh my god this is amazing haven't stayed
in the hotel it's nice to listen
good
[Music]
but since i am in serbia this is what
happened
[Music]
it's funny how simple things like
going out for dinner with some friends
that used to be completely normal are
now
almost sacrilegious in this world
they're controversial they're
kind of taboo if you're feeling confused
about
this entire thing and the world today
then you're definitely not the only one
trust me i wake up every day questioning
everything that i'm being told
questioning which media sources i should
trust
finding flaws and contradictions in the
restrictions
that we are told but i kind of left the
most important thing to last
in this video i want to talk to you
about an industry that contributes
10 of the world's economy an industry
that employs
one in 10 people around the globe
an industry that is right now collapsing
that is the travel and tourism industry
the industry that i work in and
presumably if you're watching this video
the industry that you're also
interested in over the last seven eight
nine months
there's been a narrative on social media
that travel is this
privileged and frivolous thing that we
shouldn't do and we should just forget
about and you know i understand
where that concern comes from i
understand that it comes from a place of
worry for the state of the world and
concern for everybody affected
potentially by
the pandemic but i also need to remind
us that the tourism industry is not
a frivolous privileged industry anymore
i have friends who lost their entire
businesses
their livelihoods people who have had to
take jobs that
are in no way related to their education
or
interests or qualifications people who
lost
everything look don't get me wrong
i am not saying that we should all start
traveling right now that's not what i'm
saying at all
but what i am saying is that i have a
problem
with the way the world is currently
working blocking off
an industry that is crucial to the
survival of
so many people not just the tourism
industry there's so much more
i don't want to sound pessimistic but i
don't think
the pandemic will be over with the
advent of the new year i don't think
this will end in 2021. what i hope will
change is
how the governments treat us and
how they respond to what's happening
around the world because i
don't think that locking us in our
houses and away from each other is
the way to go forward so that's all i
had to say about that
i would love to read your comments and
your perspectives
on the tourism industry in 2020
and of course 2021
i think this is not the last video i
will make about the subject because it's
really close to my heart
so yeah if you enjoyed this video make
sure you subscribe to my channel to
support it
leave that comment and remember let's
just keep pushing on
let's keep asking questions whenever we
feel like we're not getting the right
answers
because you know what the world does
belong to the brave
and i will never stop saying that
looking forward to hearing from you see
you in the next
you
