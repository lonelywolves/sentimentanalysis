hey guys this is day 2 of doesn't island
quarantine living I want to show you
guys the chem site they were gonna be
staying at for the next few days Island
and over there there's over there some
big hills and Jews right there and this
is our Harish which is our shelter here
we have Nick and there's a tent over
there were probably gonna be sleeping on
these mats but we've got some delicious
food right tape it up rice and fish now
this item is super remote so not much
grows here and you can't really bring in
that much fresh food every single day so
what people eat here is normally fish
