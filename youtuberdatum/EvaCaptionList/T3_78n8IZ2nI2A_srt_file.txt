technically
a maasai man can have as many wives as
he wants to now the concept of polygamy
has
always intrigued me because it is so
foreign and so different
from what i was taught about love and
marriage in the western
culture you know that notion where two
individuals come together as two pieces
of a whole to complete each other in
perfect
romance and harmony that is just so
different
from what happens here so i've come out
here all the way to this tanzanian
village a maasai village to learn a
little bit more about
what it's like to have co-wives
so this is yay
and i met yaya through stephanie her
daughter-in-law
and yayai has agreed to explain to me
maths about maasai marriage how it works
and what it's
like to have a husband who has other
wives
step in tanzania far from the country's
popular tourist attractions like
kilimanjaro
or zanzibar they all live together
in a bulma in maasai culture that's an
extended household or a family unit with
several houses built around a central
cattle pen
this is their home
[Music]
[Music]
is not like a traditional part of the
maasai diet
is it it didn't used to be but it is now
so now it has become their staple but in
the past and you hear that also in the
books when they explain to you about
masakacha and i think many people think
that that's still true
they tell you they just eat milk and
blood
and maybe meat sometimes but they don't
do that anymore
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
hey
[Music]
oh
[Music]
they don't count the kettles because
it's considered bad like to count how
many cuddles you have so they don't do
it
[Music]
whatever
what about that one what's her name this
one's called pemba
like pemba island like pemba island
i gave her the name
what about this one this one
yes
[Music]
[Music]
stephanie how many people live in this
bomber
i never counted but i think it's about
40 maybe
oh wow yes he is a big family you're
never alone
this is why yaya likes this way of life
because there's always people to talk
with
nobody
this is the master way of sharing or the
way of showing respect to elder
masai nyana engaged
[Music]
[Laughter]
i am
foreign
[Laughter]
foreign
[Music]
stephanie tell us a little bit about
your story
how did you get here um i got here i got
here the first time i came here was in
2011
because i had met sequoia on mafia
island where i was working as a research
volunteer
and he was working there also as
security guard for dive center
and i already spoke swahili at that
point and i was trying to speak swahili
to him a little bit
but he didn't seem so interested he was
like quite shy but then
someone after maybe three weeks on the
island told me
that he likes me and i was like what
crazy
because i didn't think that he would
like me at all
um but so we got talking and then we
ended up
being together and then my contract had
ended
and i wanted to stay in tanzania and i
wanted to stay with him
so i said hey let's go to your
traditional maasai home because
for me i thought this was the only way
for me to keep hold of him
i knew if i left him we wouldn't be
together anymore
and so you've been living here for how
long nine years now
nine years in this massey village yeah
and is my side
stephanie recently went viral on youtube
when she appeared in a video telling
the story of her marriage to sequoia her
maasai husband
the video got over 10 million views to
date
[Music]
on november

[Laughter]

foreign
[Music]
why do you think it's so difficult for
us
raised in the so-called west to
understand
the maasai way of love and marriage
i think because i had to
question myself that same thing because
it takes a lot of time for us
and a lot of effort to get out of the
ways or
the system or the way of thinking that
we have been
raised to think to believe like our
thoughts our western thoughts on love
and marriage and
even what is right what is wrong um we
have been raised
with these thoughts from when we were
little of course that we think when we
grow up that these are
this is the only way to live but then
actually when you travel and you meet
other people and you
talk to them especially when you talk to
them in their own language when you
really get to understand how they think
then you realize that actually my way of
thinking is not the only way of thinking
and right and left and good and bad
these are like very they can be defined
in many different ways
so it's difficult because we have to let
go
of everything that we have ever been
taught
is right so you have to let go of that
and that's very difficult
yeah i think
uh
um
and it's not just the marriage customs
that are changing around here
the maasai who still live a traditional
pastoral lifestyle
have been witnessing huge shifts in how
they raised their cattle
unexpected droughts as a result of the
changing climate
or new and expanding farmlands
encroaching upon traditional maasai
pastures
these are just some of the factors
changing this traditional way of life
as we speak
[Music]
that was yayai and her perspective on
marriage
now look i know it's not all rainbows
and butterflies and i know that i
as a zungu an outsider a wife foreigner
will
never hear about even half of the
problems that
people in maasai marriages face but i
hope that what this
video gave you is a slightly different
perspective on how
family structures can work and that
there is
no single answer to what a good marriage
should be every culture has its own
version and it's all about
how we were raised and the ideas of
romance and love and marriage that we've
internalized along the way
well i hope you enjoyed this vlog and
that you got a slightly different
new perspective out of it that's all i
can ask
i want to give a big big big shout out
to stephanie
who invited me to her village and who
enabled this conversation who actually
made it happen
and massive thank you to yai for sharing
her story
and to you for coming here with an open
mind
all right i guess i'll see you in the
next week
cause we go together
