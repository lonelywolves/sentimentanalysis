hey guys ava here i'm in the mountains
of morocco
i'm sliding down a very narrow footpath
and over the next couple of days i'll be
staying with a local
berber family in that village over there
in order to get to the village you
actually have to do a little hike and
i've got ismail here who is 14
and he is my local guy he's taking me to
the village i'll be staying with some of
his family and friends right there so
excited this will be a completely
unique experience i've been to morocco a
couple of times before but
never to a place as remote and as
local as this one
[Music]
this was to be my home for the next
three days pretty of the grid huh
i was in morocco africa's most popular
tourism destination
yet i was the only tourist here i had
just arrived in a tiny village in the
atlas mountains
a village that isn't even named on
google maps
a friend of a friend had arranged for me
to stay with her family there
and that's how i found myself making the
seven hour trip from marrakech to
well i'm still not sure what it's called
we drove through small villages and
beautiful mountains and eventually
i found myself following a teenage boy
across a dried-out riverbed
to my new home
[Applause]
[Music]
i was staying at the home of khadijah
they're an amazigh family
though the world knows them better as
berbers and as soon as guests come to
visit
the tea begins to flow
let me show you guys around this
beautiful traditional village
house this right here this is the
courtyard it's kind of structured like a
traditional moroccan
riyad with a central space in the middle
where people can gather up there that is
the hospitality room so you have to go
up these stairs very very narrow
until you get to a little balcony
with a view over the central courtyard
and the village out there and this is
where we enter
the guest room this room is dedicated to
welcoming
guests there are carpets all along the
walls
and there are two tables right here in
the middle
this is where tea and meals would be
served
and this right here this is the
traditional straw and wood
ceiling absolutely beautiful some of
these ceilings
are over a hundred years old so that was
the guest room the hospitality room
now i'm gonna shut this beautiful blue
door behind me
and i'm gonna show you this part of the
house
and in order to get there we have to go
downstairs better watch out for your
head
these ceilings here are pretty low built
pretty dark it's difficult to see
and here we are
on the other side of the courtyard there
is a storage room where the family
stores all of their
food vegetables and supplies you enter
it through a tiny little door
just like this if you can squeeze
through
i barely can these are some of the
utensils that the family store for
general housekeeping and cooking
for example these are branches for the
fire
this is one of the ovens that they use
for bread and this
here is another and there is one more
here
and another here each of these ovens
makes a slightly different kind of bread
that's why there are so many and trust
me the art of bread making in north
african and middle eastern cultures
it's a real thing there is a single
window well if you can call it that
right above in the ceiling
a single tiny little window like this
ensures that the entire room stays
cool for the families who live here
during scorching hot moroccan summers
a room like this would have been an
absolute blessing completely
indispensable because it would have
allowed them
to store their food in the cold in the
cool
and fresh for much much longer
[Laughter]
and over here this apparently
is the chicken section of the house
hello sorry sorry sorry all right
sorry for disturbing you
[Applause]
there is one more spot i need to show
you and that is the kitchen
i wouldn't want to get hadija angry
trust me
[Music]
hadija just called me in to show me how
the traditional
bread here is made it's called hubs
right
ismael is always helping me out with the
local language and here we are
this is hadija making the traditional
hoops
this is really hard work guys honestly
i'm just doing this in a completely
wonky way
[Laughter]
that means good
[Music]
okay hadija decided to take the power of
the tool away from me because clearly i
was not doing a very good job
[Music]
adija has just gone inside the oven room
with
all of our bread dough so i'm gonna
follow her in
ah there it is this is our tan door
our oven and we're about to stop baking
bread
[Music]
this is super amazing to see hadija
literally takes the
bread dough put some water on it and
then sticks it onto the walls of the
oven with her bare
hands
it's really hot in there trust me
the first loaf of bread is now ready
hadija literally just
unstuck it from the wall of the oven
with a little wooden stick
here we go
[Laughter]
[Music]
this room has just become extremely
extremely smoky
it's hard to breathe you better go
outside
i'll go
and then what you do is you wash that
bread down with this beautiful moroccan
[Music]
tea
[Music]
right over there that's the school on
the hilltop and there is the neighboring
village
[Music]
this is the home it's pretty simple and
pretty modest they are a very modest
family and yet
they've decided to welcome me a foreign
guest someone that they
simply don't know and they welcomed me
with
truly open arms i was told that the
amazigh people
are proud of their hospitality confirmed
we were soon invited to visit a neighbor
so we're sitting here
from her home you could see the rooftops
of the village and the valley that
surrounds it
the sun is just about to set and we're
going back home
before it gets dark and too cold it's
really freezing in here
very fresh air from the mountains but
it's winter
so it's cold
[Music]
me
[Music]
just before sunset we all walked across
the wadi again
to kadija's cousin's home i would spend
the night there
with the women of the family
[Music]
you have to know that this is a pretty
traditional and conservative area of
morocco and
in the local culture it's just
inappropriate for me to stay in their
house because
it's mostly men and boys who are staying
there at the moment so
a girl alone that would just not be
appropriate let's put it that way so
they were kind enough to put me up
in the house of one of their cousins
which is just here next to the village
over the road and this is where i'll be
staying for the night
morning guys it's been a really cold
night
which i spent under about four layers of
blankets
it's really cold here in these mountains
and there's nothing like central heating
these things don't exist here so
blankets is all
you've got i hear sounds coming from the
kitchen so i better go and check out
the breakfast situation let's go
[Music]
we're just about to have breakfast here
in this room where the ladies of the
house slept
and this is our breakfast table right
here
we've got gera and ate
that's coffee and tea
is the local name for bread and usually
it's pretty fluffy thick bread
it's a little bit crunchy on the outside
and soft on the inside
and you dip it here in this oil and this
is
it perfect breakfast
we have an unexpected guest
[Music]
[Laughter]
i think our baby good here is a little
bit hungry
[Music]
never say no to top-ups
[Music]
[Laughter]
we've just decided to go for a little
roam around the beautiful mountains here
so
we left the village behind and i'm here
with abdul karim
and of course with ismail over there
and we're gonna go on a little mountain
hike they're my guides
because they know these parts like the
back of their hand
after all this is their home
there's something super awesome about
this place i'm not sure if you can
sense it or feel it but we are walking
down a road
there are no cars here there is no sound
of cars there is no noise pollution all
i can hear is the wind
and roosters and our own steps
[Music]
and this gentleman here is building a
canal
the reason why he's building these
canals is
in order to water this land this
i don't know if you believe it or not is
actually a tiny little field
right here on the side of the mountain
you can actually grow
all sorts of vegetables here atai
he's just suggested that we have a
little cup of tea
[Laughter]
delicious moroccan tea just perfect the
mountains
so beautiful here and this cup of tea
just makes it even
[Music]
better
this is the sweetest thing in the world
we just got back and
the dad of the family just brought me
some coffee gawa as well as hubs and
some nuts
locally picked almonds from the
mountains
that we were just hiking in this is
amazing
i found myself falling in love with this
landscape and this family
they don't have it easy up here not many
jobs no infrastructure
it's really tough out here and yet they
welcomed me to their home
without hesitation
we're just about to sit down to prepare
a tagine
a tagine is a traditional moroccan dish
which contains a lot of vegetables often
meat and it's often served with rice or
couscous
i've seen both versions so hadija here
i'm sure is
master of the tajin she's just cutting
up the vegetables to make it now
[Music]
the chicken over that finally got what
he wanted
ran away with a piece of carrot
[Music]
it is kind of chilly in here so we're
making an affair
that's the fire over there
matisha jesus
yvonne is how i actually got these guys
to remember my name it's one of the like
green vegetables it's like green peas or
something like that
and it sounds almost like my name eva
basically the same thing right
and now we wait
[Music]
and our beautiful tagine after two hours
of cooking is finally
ready
[Music]
here in morocco we eat with bread
we dip it in the tagine in the
vegetables
pick up a few pieces and this is how we
eat
all together from the same bowl each
using our own individual pieces
absolutely delicious so good excellent
that's so juicy really really fresh
perfectly aromatic perfect
homemade tajin
eventually after three days and two
nights my stay with this amazigh family
came to an end
i don't want to romanticize how they
live because it's a very tough and
modest life
but i feel like i do need to point out
one thing about them in how they
interact
with the world around them you know the
important thing to note is that this
hospitality is beyond
simply welcoming a guest this is for me
i believe
true kindness imagine one day
you wake up to a knock on the door
you open it and you see a stranger a
stranger who doesn't look like you
who doesn't speak your language who
doesn't
necessarily share your values doesn't
dress like you do
what do you do do you welcome them
[Music]
or do you send them away
[Music]
these guys didn't send me away
in fact they made me feel like part of
their family
i guess that's probably all i have to
say
it's now six months later i stayed with
this family in january that's
pre-covert days quite a lot has changed
since then
but what hasn't changed the other
principles of hospitality so if you do
find yourself staying at someone's home
in the future
find a way to say thank you or
contribute to kind of reciprocate
that hospitality as a guest before i
sign off i just want to let you know
that i've launched a new channel on
