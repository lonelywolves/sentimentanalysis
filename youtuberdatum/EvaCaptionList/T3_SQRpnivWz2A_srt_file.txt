good morning
and welcome to the land of the maasai
people
and those are the people that will be
spending our next few days with
so the plan is to trek across several
maasai villages get to know their
culture and traditions
and hopefully at the end of the trek
climb
their sacred mountain the mountain of
god
but before we embarked on our trek our
local hosts had a quick masai breakfast
seeing someone drink blood for breakfast
may come as a shock to some of you but
blood has been a source of nutrients for
the maasai
since time immemorial so my camera why
why do you guys drink
blood because they need to get ah
exercise for the body like iron
i like ionians yes
guys i've seen a lot of incredible
culinary traditions around the world but
this must be
one of the more unique it's definitely a
first for me
the man that you saw explaining the
blood drinking he's our maasai guide
yeah my name is macamero
willie fred liza i am from
nato kanoka i'm a maasai i'm a marriage
i have one wife and six children
but i do trekking as a guide as a maasai
guide
the place we're hiking as a masai land
the ngorangoro highlands are home to
thousands of maasai
one of the largest tribes in africa
there's around 2 million maasai living
in kenya and tanzania
not all masai live in villages anymore
but those who do
lead a pastoral life which means that a
lot of their food
sustenance and income comes from cattle
grazing
in recent years this way of life has
come under threat
and many maasai have been displaced to
make room for tanzania's national parks
and tourism but with a growth in tourism
numbers over the last few decades
some local women have found a lucrative
side hustle
we're right here in the middle of the
village and goldie is making me
a custom pair of earrings just like her
own earrings i mean
i just got this beautiful necklace that
was also made by the girls of the
village but
but the earrings are gonna be really
really nice
always women learn from you know even a
journal may learn from father
oh nice
jewelry is super beautiful colorful
and ornate and i've always wanted to
have something like this i'm really
happy that i get to
see how it's actually made here in this
tiny village in the gorongor crater
one of ngori's older relatives came to
put the finishing touches on my new
earrings and
soon we were ready to try them on all
right
done finished so one
so does this make me uh like a massage
lady
yeah lady yeah no it's my wife it's not
the man so girlfriend
the funniest thing is that we're trying
to have a look at the village
and see a bit of the village maybe even
visit a home or
two and but the kids
the kids are just like so taken
with the fact that we're filming and
they're so curious about the cameras and
they just they just love the company so
yeah we've got a bit of a
parade with us at the moment
this is not the kind of maasai village
where you would get the locals to come
and dance and sing for you
no way this is just a normal village
we're going oh thank you so much you're
going to hold my camera nice
it's just a normal village where people
you know just go about their day
[Laughter]
thank you very much there she is
here we go again all right there's women
building houses
really yeah
and there she is a lady building a house
actually in masai culture it's the women
who usually
build and repair homes and the homes are
made
from
wow learning how to build a house
that is a skill i could definitely use
in the future
all right thank you very much and to
take off my rings because uh this is um
cowdung all right never done this before
let's dig it all right nice and soft
okay like this
it's falling no it's all falling
okay oh i think we gotta third helping
hand

massage the cow dung into the house
starting from the bottom and going

[Laughter]
husband then i i'm building some on a
house
whose house is this my house your house
oh my god i did not expect this
you can see that this is my little
trapped section
and this is the local ladies beautiful
and smooth section that looks like
cement okay
i think i'm done here oh you have to
finish the whole house what the whole
house is
i'm gonna be here for a month thank you
thank you thank you
oh you mean something very amazing
this lady such a joker
and we're dancing we're trying to stay
very very serious but
and the work continues stop the dancing
the house must be built at some point
we had a long hike ahead of us that day
and the shining sun was soon replaced by
heavy rain clouds
guys the rain is just not letting up but
we've decided to keep pushing ahead and
currently
we're about two or three hours away from
the next village which is called
which is called nyobi and we've picked
up this local lady
who also happens to be going to naobi
mama irene
from naomi so she's joined us
on our little hike so now we're a
slightly extended team
i should also add that mama irene sold
me this beautiful ring and then tom got
one as well
there we go and look she's still
hustling
she's trekking hiking and she's still
hustling
not the best weather for a hike but soon
enough our
final destination emerged in the
distance
oldonio lengai the mountain of god
an active volcano and a sacred maasai
mountain
in a couple of days we would attempt to
climb it
for now though our more immediate
concern was finding shelter for the
night
we finally made it home and this is our
perfect home because there's baby goats
involved
they're thoroughly weirded out by a
grown woman kissing a baby goat
that doesn't happen here much more
common around these parts is this
when a village elder spits on you as a
blessing
this boma is where we set up our camp
for tonight so
actually not even setting up a proper
camp because
we'll be staying in an actual house in
an actual local
hut all right let's check it out from
the inside welcome home
oh it's so nice and warm in here
oh it's nice
[Music]
this boma is where we get to sleep
tonight
it's still raining outside so we've hung
up some of our sleeping bags and
camping gear to dry probably won't dry
off so we're gonna
stay the night right here in this little
hut
first try
[Music]
so
oh this is just the perfect pick-me-up
after a long day of trekking
hot sweet milky chai
oh just amazing
[Music]
everybody's just gone to bed and it's
now my responsibility
to lock the door here it is this stick
and then push it in here and then push
it in
there and that way we're bolted in for
the night
there's no danger here actually
i think it's mostly just so that the
animals don't get into the bulma
in the middle of the night all right
nice and bolted right
time to go to sleep i think
all of our stuff is drying in here the
fire is still going just a little bit
and here is our bedroom
all right how's it looking mike hey
yeah it's actually pretty cozy and it's
pretty warm in here too from the fire
which means that we shouldn't have to
use our sleeping bags which are still a
little bit wet
so on that note i wish you a
good night from boma in the middle
of tanzania
good morning good morning
jumbo
it's still raining this morning maybe
even more than yesterday
[Applause]
um
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
the weather has finally cleared the
clouds have passed and revealed
an absolutely otherworldly landscape i
haven't seen
anything like this ever in my life i
just can't believe my own eyes
here behind me this is the mountain of
god or daniel and guy in its full glory
it looks so unbelievably beautiful and
epic
and steep and right there in the
distance is
lake natural and our destination for
today
this is nature's poetry
[Music]
well this was this was exhausting
that was a really really long day of
trekking
but it's not over and tomorrow is
actually
it's the big day tomorrow is the big day
but first of all let me show you
the campsite that we're staying at and
the mountain that we're climbing
tomorrow
all in one this is our mountain
mountain of god our volcano
we're going to be waking up at around
midnight maybe 1 a.m
if we sleep in in order to get to the
top
by sunrise i've heard it's harder than
kilimanjaro so
wish me luck
[Music]
[Music]
when we saw the mountain of god from a
distance i think we could see
that it was pretty steep but
nothing could have prepared us for this
slow painful upward slog
it's beautiful but it's deadly
oh my god guys this is the wildest thing
i've seen
in my entire life i completely did not
expect this
this is what the inside of a cold
volcanic crater
looks like
what on earth is that
[Music]
uh
[Music]
i have got to admit that it feels just a
little bit surreal to be
sitting on the rim of the crater of an
active
volcano actually i'm sitting down as
opposed to standing up because
every time i stand up my legs get just a
little bit wobbly and i
just start thinking that i'm gonna like
fall into the crater and die
anyway we're actually gonna go back down
in just a few minutes
we've been promised a traditional maasai
feast
to celebrate our ascent which i'm really
looking forward to
because trust me i'm starving and we
still have to go
all the way back down
when we finally made it back down to our
campsite the preparations for our
celebration
were already in full swing we bought a
goat from the village as a gift for the
locals
and through a little barbecue
this one we make a fire
so for masai normally we do a fire
for to check the boats tree like this
look
ordinary
[Music]
[Music]
this is honestly one of the coolest
thing i've seen in my life the guys have
literally just
made a fire using nothing more than
a stick of wood and some donkey done
it's amazing
when do you want to practice yeah i have
to practice a lot of practice
yes
he gets to the table he one day he won
italian ask him
like a tiny title he get it was like he
snitched like 10 times
okay round two
they know what's coming
oh my god it's like in my brain
there's a lot more left please take it
all
this is tonight's barbecue this is why
we're all here
and that goat is the soul
every single part of the animal is used
nothing
at all is wasted not even the head not
even the hooves not even the innards
everything every eaten everything right
look at
it
very tasty
i think this is the essence of a tool
you know we
travel to the most remote corners of the
world
to meet people whose cultures are so
distant
from our own only to find out that we
laugh at the same stuff that we
all enjoy dancing and barbecuing
well that's it for this week's adventure
