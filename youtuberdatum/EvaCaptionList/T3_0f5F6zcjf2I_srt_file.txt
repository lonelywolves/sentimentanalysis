i just did not expect this of
afghanistan
look at that you slide a tiny little bit
to the right and you fall off the glyph
[Music]
hi everybody and welcome to afghanistan
today our mission is to drive to a
remote village where we will be staying
with a local family in their home state
but
there is a problem it snowed so much
last night
that the main road is blocked and we
have to use these
back roads which are also very very
snowy covered with ice and
splash in order to get there
so here we have sajad behind the
steering wheel
have hello all right how long do you
think it's going to take us to reach
there
four hours four hours yeah and this
foundation of the road good luck to us
[Music]
this is absolutely wild the snow is like
half a meter deep
and we're just trawling through it in
this park
and there's i mean if here if you break
down or if you get stuck
that's it there's nobody here there's no
road service
and there's probably not going to be any
other car passing by this road
for several hours at least so we're
really on our own out here
aren't we yes you say that with a smile
we need to take care of us
in afghanistan a large large chunk of
the population
lives in villages like these ones
they rely primarily on agriculture to
meet most of their
living needs and that makes them pretty
self-sufficient which is great
in some ways but in other ways a lot of
the time they can become completely cut
off from the rest of the world from
healthcare from
cities when the weather
decides to snow them in
[Music]
we're sliding an awful lot here
you see that that is
uh just a cliff if you're enjoying my
adventures so far and would like to get
access to more exclusive videos and
content
like my top tips on travel safety
consider joining my patreon community
link in the description box alright
let's keep going
that block road pushed us deeper and
deeper into the valley
is there a word to describe the fear of
running out of
fuel
[Music]
alright that snowy road is finally
behind us and we've just arrived
in the town of yakaolang we're going to
stop for a few minutes
buy some fruit some vegetables some
supplies
for the upcoming night so here is ghoul
hello salam
what are you getting for us bowl with
some
oranges some cabbage for
salad
[Music]
oh beautiful fresh bread
so this is called naan none fresh naan
this
is life these are the mountains of the
legendary hindu kush
endless books have been written and
stories told about these speaks
once upon a time travelers and traders
on the ancient silk route
passed by here in their opulent caravans
connecting east and west on their
harrowing journey
a lot has changed since that time but
driving through these mountains you
still feel a sense of something
grand something timeless
[Music]
this place is amazing it's a pass
inside this beautiful super narrow gorge
just rocks baron baron rock all around
us
reaching 100 meters 200 meters up
oh it's just incredible
[Music]
these days we associate
all right these days we associate
afghanistan with
islam very conservative sometimes even
radical islam
but afghanistan wasn't always islamic
throughout history
before islam came to the region this
part of the world
was mostly buddhist and there's still
some buddhist remains
of monasteries and stupas strewn around
this part of afghanistan and i'm about
to show you
one of them it's right there
this place is absolutely unbelievable
you know they estimate that this stupa
is between 1500 and 1800 years old
still standing a piece of the region's
history
and heritage incredible
[Music]
what are you doing here having some nuts
from
almonds
wow
fresh from the tree
that's pretty good oh no the aftertaste
it's a bit too bitter for me
i had no idea what i was about to see i
was just expecting a simple guest house
nothing more but i would get a lot more
than that
here's a hint if you can spot it
we finally arrived at our guest house we
cannot actually drive
up to it because the river is blocking
the road
but we get to walk on this cute little
bridge
and that is where we're going to be
staying tonight
this must be one of the most beautiful
and remote places i've ever seen in my
life
and trust me when i say this because i
always seek out the most remote and
beautiful places
on earth but this i mean honestly
i just did not expect this of
afghanistan and my mind
is thoroughly blown
thoroughly blown
[Music]
this little building that you see on the
edge of the hill it's a tiny two-room
homestay
ran and built by a family who live on
this land
this is their home just a few steps away
let me introduce you to the owner ali
more
have you been here before no it's first
time so interesting for me

welcome to our house in childbirth let's
have a look inside
it's customary to take off your shoes
before you enter a room in afghanistan
wow so
beautiful it's so simple but clean
lovely oh my gosh the view
is unbelievable
and look at this stove super old school
stove
this is going to keep us warm later
tonight
[Music]

heaviest of you of youtube
it's breaking no no no no no it's not
okay ready put your
both feet yeah all right we're ready to
go
[Laughter]
it's definitely going to break oh my god
oh my god
best roller coaster this is how we have
fun in afghanistan
the moment darkness fell upon us the
cold came creeping in too
as beautiful as they may be these
mountains can be harsh
and unforgiving at night time
as lovely as it is next to the fire the
temperatures here in the mountains
drop very very drastically at night so
we've decided to
come inside and have our dinner right
here next to the stove
and we've got chicken we've got rice
we've got potatoes you've got bread
all right let's dig in i'm sorry me too
oh yeah there's a lot by the way
this is what do you want it says all of
them
yeah that's good
why not okay
too hungry i will eat all
[Music]
it's a beautiful morning here in the
valley and we've just been invited
to take a look at how the ladies here
in our hosts home bake bread
the ladies here asked me not to film
their faces but we did get permission
to film their hands and how they
actually make the naan so
this is a proper little
home-based bakery where they bake
several now
every single morning for the consumption
of the family
the tourists that sometimes come by here
[Music]
so what do we have here nazima we have
fresh bread
from tandoor we want the huff
wow that's beautiful yeah perfect for
[Music]
breakfast
and fluffy
and so delicious
so we have this morning organic
breakfast
it's a zero kilometer yeah
everything is grown here here so this
almond is from here
[Music]
[Music]
and they have the ruins of an ancient
fortress here too
[Music]
this morning we're walking up to the
towers
above on the hill and then we're going
to continue into
one of the valleys let's see what we
find
not much is known about this fortress
it's called chilborg
or 40 towers and it was built around the
5th century
it was likely destroyed by the armies of
chinggis khan
who passed by here in the 11th century
the thing that i find the most
astonishing is that
well over a thousand years ago people
built this city
this castle on a hill in amongst these
jagged peaks in one of the most remote
places in the world
and it's still standing today and it's
unexcavated
and unexplored in a remote valley in
afghanistan
can you imagine the history that we're
walking on right now
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
laughs
[Music]
muslims
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
it's time to finally leave this
beautiful idyllic
place definitely one of the most
gorgeous
stunning guest houses i've ever stayed
in
it's simple but the views the location
the hospitality
are just unbeatable you know the
situation in afghanistan
being as it is in terms of security
there aren't that many people who dare
to venture
out here and really not many tourists
at all but if the security situation
changes or when it changes in the future
then people like ali will hopefully be
at the forefront
of a new tourism economy and
infrastructure
and here i also have to give a big shout
out to my guide
ghoul he is honestly the best travel and
adventure guide you can find out here in
afghanistan
and this adventure would not have been
possible without it
all right remember the world belongs to
the brave
keep exploring and i'll see you in the
next adventure bye
you
