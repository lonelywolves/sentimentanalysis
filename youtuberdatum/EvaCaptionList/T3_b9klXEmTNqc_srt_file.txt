i was the first lady who bring middle
for afghanistan for first time
if a girl go for skiing or do some
sports
they will think you're not good girl
they are calling me
and said you're not a good girl you're
super
and they said if we say you we will kill
you
afghanistan a country torn apart by
conflict foreign interests and
radicalism
without a break for the last 40 years
afghanistan also happens to be one of
the most conservative countries on the
planet
where girls and women don't always have
access to education
jobs never mind sports so when i visited
afghanistan i headed straight for
bamiyan a mountainous region
where i would get to meet nasima one of
the few female athletes in the country
we both share a deep love for skiing
though our lives couldn't be any more
different
this is nazima's story
it's a beautiful morning here in bamiyan
in afghanistan
and we are just on our way to meet a
female
skier from afghanistan her name is nazim
i'm here with sajad
hello and sajid is part of the national
skiing team here in afghanistan and the
resident expert on all things skiing
and he's going to be taking us to the
mountain later today but first
we're going to go to nasima's home meet
her talk to her
and have breakfast together
[Music]
all right here we are hi
how are you hi how are you
oh good oh good you're welcome thank you
so much this is your home yeah
i'm not thought from karma distress when
i was
a child about three years we moved uh
from karmart to bomian
because we had some family problems
and also about taliban also you should
mention
in karma district girls can go to school
candy study and also they can go outside
when they go outside they use from bukra
or we can say for that chaudhry if a
girl go
outside they will think but maybe they
will say she's a very bad girl
because of so many reasons we come in
burmeon unfortunately
i have the best family they support me
always
hello thank you so much thank you
[Music]
wow
what is the name of this dish
it looks delicious all right
first bite of this local afghan
breakfast
so delicious spicy aromatic
and the bread is just so fresh when i
was 10 years i was doing
sports with my small brother not big one
we start
a football in the yard we play football
one day
he had competition in gymnasium he said
for us
i'm alone and come please join with me
because of
i am aloon and i agree with him and i
saw there is
there was a girl who played sport and
she
come and sit near to me and said uh
something good about the sports and
the coach come also and he said for me
please come and join with our team
also if you're not relaxed you can
believe with your brother
what's inside there uh we have a skew
kingman here
and so it will be nuts everything in
good shape
because we just finished the ski school
and ski competition the afghan ski
challenge
the ski equipment oh nice
falls boots so can anybody come here and
rent
skiing equipment yes the local people
very cheap
for renting just to understand them the
value of his case is not free but a bit
more expensive for foreigners who are
coming for this game because they
already know the value of
how expensive or and how difficult to
get them here
yes yeah i take students i will start
sports but when i come
back home i sit for my family
first for my mom she said no never it's
impossible she said look you are a
cousin or you are family who live
in karma district they family their
family don't give their permission to go
in school you want to do sports it's
impossible
especially for girls and i cried a lot
when they loved me i was so
angry and sad
they gave me and my brother also he said
a lot please give permission to her i am
aloon
and they gave me permission and i start
esports
[Music]
well here we are picking out our
equipment for the rest of the day so
that we can go skiing
these are the boots that i'll probably
wear i just need to try them on
nazima already has hers and her skis and
her pulse
so we're almost ready to go right
uh we started this king in afghanistan
in 2011
uh christopher who came to bombing he
was a journalist
so when he saw the mountains and snow he
thought that
it can be a ski destination here
so next year he brought some skis here
and he started the skiing with some
locals
and then into the and organizing every
year the afghan ski challenge
and ski school for boys and girls what
are girls expected
to be like but in afghanistan they
should uh
just do housework not go outside
not studying but in bombian it a little
change and i think it will be changed
and they
one day they will give permission their
daughter they want freedom
they won't do sports they want to have a
good life what they want they should be
but they can't if a girl go for
skiing or do some sports they will think
you're not good girl
yeah they said how you
give permission for her to start sports
also i was posted some of my uh
photo in social media when they saw uh
they were calling me and said you're not
a good girl you're so bad
and they said if we say you we will kill
you
it's not just about me it's about all
girls but
uh in burmeon it's okay there is no
problem
it's been two years since i planned to
come here and finally
finally we're about to go ski yeah so
where are you going to take us today for
the skiing which mountain
maybe
is it difficult maybe
right but not much she says it's
difficult and she's the resident expert
so
let's see if i can survive today also we
don't have leave
oh yeah that's another thing there is no
chair left here in afghanistan so that
means
how do we get to the top of the mountain
hiking right
wish us luck so i heard that you guys
had
a small lift yeah
it's second year we have the
two ropes smoother bike engine using in
to just pull girls up to the mountain
it's not that long it's like only 250
meters
but good to train because before we only
could
uh run a two run a day
if we will be fit enough and now they
can do
like 10 15 runs a day wow so yeah they
can train
more
[Music]
i see my future pride with skiing
for first time yeah i felt them also it
was so hard for them to
accept and give permission to go
it will be so hard for you especially
for girl
about everything you should think for
your future as well
it's hard for tomorrow you will be mo
you will become a mother for some days
they hated me
they don't like me liked me and
i said don't worry if you are have hurry
uh
i will take nazra with myself
and by this way you will be relaxed and
also
i start with nazira because of this
reason they become
their thing changed
[Music]
so we have finally arrived and it
started
snowing this is a true winter wonderland
so we we have reached the end of the
road and from here
we're going to walk past the village
and towards the mountain somewhere up
there you can't really see because it's
a bit snowy and a bit foggy
but this place is absolutely beautiful
stunning perfect weather for skiing
fresh powder guaranteed
[Music]
[Music]
all my life change with starting is key
uh before that it was saw some video on
tv and it's
so hard but it's so amazing and
one coach by the name of anno she came
in bomian
also boy was starting
for first time i was making facebook
and i saw some picture she starred in
womenski and
i was so exciting
and also eating one day i go and join
with him
for first time it was so hard for me to
do
skiing but really it was hard but
right now i think it is the easiest
sport and
uh joyful sport in the world
and i started uh skiing uh from bohmian
uh also in 2020 uh
there was an international competition
in pakistan
fortunately i took the third position
and i was the first lady
who bring middle for afghanistan for
first time
[Music]
oh this is only the beginning of our
climb to the mountain and i'm already
very very sweaty this is not
this is not easy how are you feeling
guys
good good it's nice and it's snowy and
fresh
it's going to be good today amazing
so today we have been joined by alicia
who's here hello and by ghoul
who is here gold doesn't have a pair of
skis
i'm watching you so it's the four of us
that will be skiing down as soon as we
reach the top
as soon as we reach the top in four
hours or five hours
when we reach the top
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
aren't you scared yeah sometimes my
cousin said we want like your life like
your
father he support you so much if we say
for my
father we won't go in another place
he don't give permission he didn't give
permission to
study when you go for running
all boys will look you up and say some
bad words
for first time when i was go hiking with
my
sister they say some bad words
use on us and yeah we become so
angry and we don't continue we come back
but
other days we counted and we we said for
us we live for ours ourselves not for
people we what they say we should do
like that it's been
i think less than an hour i'm already
super super sweaty this is
really not easy i mean imagine every
time you want to go skiing you have to
climb a mountain before you can actually
ski down it
compared to ski resorts in the us and
europe
those are pure luxury this is the real
real hardcore deal
[Music]
right we finally managed to get to the
top and from here
we're gonna ski down you can't really
see it's super cloudy today
but uh how long do you think it will
take us to ski down
only a few minutes yeah
so you spend all this time climbing up
the mountain only for a few minutes of
skiing yeah
wow would you prefer to have a ski a
chair lift here
would it make it easier for you it is
easy
yeah it's not easy
it's not easy if every time you have to
go up the mountain in order to ski
down i mean obviously that means you're
very strong but
it's uh are you always motivated to come
school
well uh right now this is the only
chance to ski in bermuda in afghanistan
in general
yeah i mean of course you know like the
country's king is getting
big and big every year but you know for
normal people it's always good to have
this
chair left but for the adventure skiers
who comes to afghanistan they prefer to
walk up and ski down and would you
prefer to have a ski lift or do you
prefer it like this
well we always prefer to you know when
you have a ski lift you can do so many
runs during the day but
yeah if you're strong enough you can do
three
when i went to the pakistan i see dear
life
and compare with our life it was so many
different
so many about everything
and when i come back from pakistan for
one week
you will not believe for one week i was
sick i don't want to pick up from my uh
class i didn't want to go outside and i
didn't want to see
anyone there was so many different and
maybe i was happy
in that class to
every day what you want you can wear you
can talk with
everyone right now they proud on us
me and also my sister you know i took
the middle and
take the third position i didn't say for
anyone especially for my family i didn't
say and i said
they shouldn't know and hear from tv
they will become surprised one night
they were in
home and saw my pictures on
tv nazira was cooking on that time
and shout look nice
and when this look that they become
so happy and surprised wow how
in international competition it was
impossible but
how she do this yeah and they call for
me congratulations why you didn't say
for us before and i said
that was surprised for you and it was
the
first step of my life ready
[Music]
oh my god i can't believe we're doing
this
skiing in afghanistan i mean i've skied
in some
amazing places around the world like
pakistan and iran
but afghanistan this is a completely
different ballgame
you can't see much out here but it's
more about the feeling
the feeling of being here in these
mountains
our eyes are closed when we start this
loop
on repeat
hear my chest how
[Applause]
do you think that in 10 years or in 20
years
the situation here for girls will change
if they
try yes but if they feel like this
i think no never also we worried about
taliban if taliban come
they can not study they should to
be in home and do housework
not studying not exports afghanistan is
so beautiful country but unfortunately
because of the stoller bomb
deutsch they can't live but they are
just
alive but they don't live i hope
one day there have been no taliban
noodles

afghanistan
