What is this place?
Oh, my God.
You know, that's the thing that I fear the most.
I don't know if I am strange or weird for saying
this, but every once in a while I get this
overwhelming urge to be alone, 
just me and my thoughts.
That's it. Nobody else around.
Once in a while, I like to just think that 
I don't have to answer emails or calls 
and that I can just be offline.
And this last month has been insanely busy.
So, so crazy.
I never got a chance to really sit back 
and have me time. 
And so I reached that point
where I just knew that I was becoming irritable
and moody and exhausted all the time.
And I knew that it was probably
time for me to go.
Anyway, I decided very spontaneously to go on
a trek by myself here in southern Albania. 
I brought along my tent,
my sleeping bag, some food for the road, 
 some water, and decided 
that  I should just go.
It's eight a.m. on a beautiful morning and I'm here
with Eni, who is my local guide.
Hello.
And Eni is dropping me off at the entrance
to the valley.
Here we are! We've arrived at the last village,
it's called Polican, and from here,
I walk for two or three days.
I wish you good luck.
I'll need it!
And just like that, I'm all alone here.
My plan was to cross the entire valley, 
40 kilometres in two days.
The brave man.
This has been quite the up and down,
I mean, 10 kilometres, 
it's not that much, but keep in mind,
my pack weighs around 10 KG.
Which makes it a little bit harder
on the uphills, as modest as they look.
I've got another 5KM until the village
where I would like to set up camp for the night.
And I have maybe three hours to get there.
Because sunset... 
comes pretty early in winter.
One of the best things about Albania:
Byrek.
Food tastes so good 
after you've been walking.
It's quite the challenge 
to get
across these bushes.
For the rest of my trip 
to the village of Hoshteve,
I decided to follow these shepherd tracks.
They cut across the long grass
so you can more or less see where you should go.
And worst case scenario, I can always backtrack
to the main road.
Oh, my God, what is this place?
Oh, I broke into a
serious sweat there.
Trekking through these - agh! - these bushes.
So my trip through the bushes  resulted in...
 me losing the windsock
for my microphone.
Okay then, wind noise,
please come at me.
You know, that's the thing that I fear the most
whenever I trek alone.
Shepherd dogs. These pastures here 
are used for grazing sheep pretty much all year round.
And, you know, shepherd dogs are, of course,
used to protect the flock.
[I'm scared of] Not wild animals, not people, 
but potentially dangerous and vicious
shepherd dogs.
Next time I want to invest in one of those funky
little devices that make a high-pitched sound, you know, 
to scare them off.
I'm going to see if I can find the shepherd and say
hello to him.
Oh, my God, the shepherd is a girl.
I did not expect this, so cool!
Oh, my God, I really want to say hello to this shepherd here,
let me see if I can find him.
Behind the bushes.
Hello!
Oh, so nice.
And your name?
Me: Eva.
Fimio.
Oh, what a nice gentleman he was, I think,
he was telling me in a mix of Greek, Albanian and Russian
about his grandchildren.
So sweet.
More dogs...
in the middle of my way to the village.
I can see the shepherd and the flock
far in the distance, but the dogs are just....
they stayed behind, and they're here
and they won't let me cross.
So in order to get around the dogs, I can just go
through this little canyon and
get out that way.
And that way I avoid them completely.
Mm hmm.
I'm going to put the camera away and
take extra caution here.
Mission accomplished.
Leaves in my hair, bits of bushes
and trees, but at least I'm safe.
I've just walked through this village here, 
it's called Sheper, and it's almost completely
deserted, most of the inhabitants,
most of the people that live here actually only live
here in the summer and in the warm seasons.
And for winter, they you know, they kind of leave
for greener pastures, towns and cities
where they can live a little bit more comfortably,
you know, so there's nobody here.
Do you see those?
Those little structures
 are like a hallmark of Albanian history.
There's about 200,000 of these bunkers
just scattered all across Albania.
That's a massive number in a country of
three million people.
The story goes as follows.
Albania's former communist dictator, 
Enver Hoxha,
was so paranoid about foreign invasions
that he decided to build a giant,
enormous system - network - of these
bunkers all across the country,
to protect Albania 
from the outside world.
No invaders ever really came
but the bunkers remain.
Imagine sitting in here and
looking out for the enemy...
Feels positively medieval.
Here's what happened. 
The moment I stepped foot in the village, 
I saw Liria - this lady - emerge from her house.
It's as if our meeting was meant to be.
Following this lady to her house.
We exchanged greetings and pretty much immediately,
Liria said that I should spend the night in her house...
which, of course, I said yes to.
Liria just prepared me a bowl of
bean soup, which is so nice...
and she's just making me chai, too.
The spoon...
And the thing that I love the most:
fresh cheese.
It's amazing.
Straight from the sheep.
That is good.
So good.
The guys are laughing at me
for talking into my camera.
Socks!
Oh, my God, I can't believe it
Liria is...
So sweet, she's such a sweet lady.
I mean, not only did she welcome me 
to her house, feed me, 
she then proceeded to tuck me into bed.
And I'm someone that she met only like three hours ago. 
She doesn't know me.
I'm a stranger, a foreigner.
We can't even talk properly.
We just exchange words 
that I get from Google Translate.
I mean, this is like beyond hospitality.
This, I think, is just genuine human kindness
and trust.
I mean, imagine some random person, a stranger
who doesn't even speak your language, knocked on your
door in the middle of the afternoon
and asked if they can camp in your garden
or stay over at your place.
I'm very, very humbled and very, very
overwhelmed, actually.
Hey, I'm going to get to bed because there is another
really long day of hiking ahead of me tomorrow.
So.
My gosh, Liria cooked me, like, a full-on breakfast
with cheese and scrambled eggs
and bread.
And tea.
I'm about to embark on the second
leg of my journey, and this is the second day.
The weather is looking a little bit gloomy, but...
My gosh, this should keep me going.
It's always difficult to say goodbye to people who
show you so much kindness, but it was time for me
to keep going.
I bade Liria farewell,
promised that I would come and see her again,
and as a little thank you gift, I gave her
a picture of a saint that I was carrying for my grandma.
See that bridge behind me?
Honestly, it looks like something straight out of
a fairy tale, and keep in mind, 
I am like deep, deep, deep in the middle of nowhere 
in a very remote valley in Albania 
where there is no road access, and yet...
here stands a beautiful, stunning
super high bridge that connects the two mountains.
Rain!
It was so beautiful and sunny, and now,
it's about rain again.
Let me find some cover.
I did see this coming, so I brought
a little something to cover up the camera 
and make sure that it doesn't get wet.
A plastic bag.
Wow, can you imagine living
in this house?
In the middle of the valley, 
there is no phone signal here.
Sheep....
Horses, cows, the mountain.
The view of that mountain every morning...
The sound of the river below, every morning...
And these cats!
Well, this is taking a little bit longer 
than I expected.
I am 20 kilometres in...
it's been a really long day.
A lot of ups and downs the entire time,
three kilometres left,
and just under one hour left of sunlight
After that it gets dark.
All right.
Muster all my strength!
Let's go.
You see it?
It's there. That's the village
I'm going to! It gives me so much
energy to just see the village
and know that it's so close.
OK.
And last mission: since it hasn't been raining
and I haven't had to use my plastic bag 
to shield my camera, I'm using it to collect some
trash that I found along the way, mostly plastic.
Oh, here it is,
the village of Pesthan!
Oh, my God. 22.7 KM today
and eight and a half hours
of walking. I am exhausted,
but I am so happy to be here.
Oh, my God. Oh, this feels so good.
And that over there is Eni in his
Red Skoda! Great!
Yes.
All right, so it turns out I wasn't completely alone
on this trek.
Not as I initially hoped for.
But you know what? It turned out amazing.
I feel so fully recharged and
rejuvenated and ready to be integrated back into
society.
You know, I think the moral of the story is
that no matter how fixated you may be on an idea
of something, it's always worth opening
yourself up to new encounters,
new possibilities and new experiences.
And I think that readiness to adapt and
change is is a really brave quality.
And you know what I like to say about being brave,
right? The world belongs to the brave.
All right.
