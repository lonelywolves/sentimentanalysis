as a travel vlogger one of the top perks
of my job is the community that i get to
build
around my work and my travels and as a
result
i get a lot of invitations from people
all around the world
telling me to come over to their country
or even
stay with them in their house so imagine
my excitement
when during my trip in romania i got
this email
i belong to the german minority among
the romanians the saxons
my aunt edith is now in this village and
would love to show you around
last year she walked by foot from
hamburg in germany to this village in
romania and slept most of the nights in
her tent
something about this message struck me
as a really special and my god
told me to go and see edith even though
her village was not really
on my way so i scheduled in a call with
birgit
and her aunt edith just to make sure
that they were real people
you know safety first and then it was a
date
edith and i decided that we would meet
in her village
on my way out of the countryside in
transylvania
and little did i know about the
incredibly special gift
that edith had prepared for me well this
is the story of that meeting
[Music]
this here is viscree a small village
where i spent a few days getting to know
the area
this village has such a serene
atmosphere it's home to a small
community of a few hundred people
and sure it's a tight-knit kind of place
but there's something about it that
makes it extra special
it's amazing to just see horses roaming
around the streets this village
i mean last night when i was coming back
home from dinner there was just a horse
walking along the road minding its own
business
i tried to strike up a conversation just
ran away from me
so before i came to this cree um
i asked ursula because she's hosting me
whether i need the keys to enter
my accommodation usually said no you
don't need a key because we don't lock
anything up in whiskey not the houses
and not the cars
so our tour around the village of
whiskey continues and where are we going
now
we are going to the village blacksmith
oh there he is
i've actually never seen a blacksmith at
work so this is
super exciting
can you imagine doing a job doing
a craft of five generations imagine
the knowledge and the level of skill and
experience that is
passed on if you're a fifth generation
blacksmith or
anything absolutely anything i feel like
that doesn't really happen very much in
the world
[Music]
oh cool it has a very
look at this what is what does this mean
this is this for good luck
it is the the horseshoe is definitely
the symbol of luck but
you need to hold it always upwards like
this like there's never
no like don't pull out the lock keep it
in the hole so this nail and the
horseshoe are part of
one set to make sure the whole shoe is
always looking up
eventually it was time to leave the
comfort of this village behind
and head into the unknown
right i'm finally in my car and i'm
driving across transylvania
to finally go and meet edith in person
and i'm super curious to see how that
meeting goes
and what she's like well if there is one
thing that you can count on while
driving around in romania
it's that most of the traffic you're
likely to encounter is going to be alive
and kicking this is amazing
i think romania is the only country in
europe
where you still find organic
traffic like that here it is altena
aldson this is the town i'll be staying
in
you know the funny thing is that as a
tourist
you would never ever come to a village
like this because it's completely
ordinary
there's nothing to see here so the fact
that
someone invited me here is really the
only reason why i am here
and that's kind of special
it's a very unique experience if you
think about it it's a different kind of
tourism
all right let's find our host
so here i was about to spend a couple of
days in the home of a total stranger
in a remote village in transylvania and
little did i know
about the very special gift that edith
was preparing to give me
at the end of my stay hi
hi yes yes yes yes
all right this is the way this is the
way
eden is just showing me into my room
and her beautiful beautiful traditional
at home
oh my god look at that wow oh my gosh
this is gorgeous wow
[Music]
edith and i spent much of the day
talking and getting to know each other
she really did walk 1600 kilometers from
northern germany to central romania
at the age of 67. during the day
she would walk and at night she would
either camp or stay with people she met
edis said the thing that gave her a
spring in her step was the positive
energy
that she would receive from strangers
edith here has
cooked an amazing feast for me all
vegetarian
all tasty all vegetables from her garden
i've i've just had such a wonderful
welcome here it's
feels like homemade
is about to show us some of the
traditional saxon
clothes original things that come from
her
family i'm so excited about this that's
a traditional
coat right here in the village in
artson in 1940
wow that's the shirt handmade
also for men yes for men and this is
the men's head my mother
made it for my father and he wore it as
a groom
it was a tradition that the girls made
you
wore it like this you see and my mother
embroidered it
everything made in the village it's so
beautiful
and they're custom because it has your
name on it and nobody else can
wear it yes kind of a hat but
[Laughter]
just like a cylinder yeah you must
go walk very upright you have to be
super
upright and it's super straight and
dignified
dignified yes because the position if
you go like that
it looks important and what if it falls
off
does that never happened or never
happened never but would that be
embarrassing for a girl
of course so this is the room that i'll
be staying in
tonight and you know it's been so lovely
today to learn a little bit more about
it's family and her home and
the village itself and the whole history
and culture but also just to kind of
i don't know you know we're taught to be
wary of strangers and not to accept
strangers invitations but actually
when traveling this is kind of how you
meet
friends and how you get to have truly
special
experiences and learn about communities
that you didn't know about make
friendships
i think this is probably one of the
purest forms of travel and on that note
i'm gonna switch off the camera for now
and enjoy the rest of the day
and i'll see you tomorrow
the church bells are just striking eight
a.m on a sunday morning
and i've gone out for a run around the
village
and i'm realizing that this village is
really the kind of village that people
just
drive through you don't stop here
there's nothing to see here in a
traditional sense in fact
the moment you step away from the main
road and i just did because i just
reached the end of the village of my run
you kind of go into the secondary roads
which are just dirt tracks nothing is
paved
so really this is the kind of village
that
you would never visit if you're just
looking to kick off
the top 10 sites in a country now
this is the kind of village that you
would only visit if someone invites you
except their invitation
[Music]
after breakfast we decided to call up
edith's niece
birgit who was the person that brought
us together in the first place
her two sons were super excited to meet
me since they all watch my vlogs
together
as a family
[Laughter]
i'm here taking a walk with edith around
the village of altena
so edith has your family always lived
here
how many generations is that oh
the name bengal is documented
from 1406. but not in our village
but it was one of the oldest names
german names in transylvania so
maybe from 14 and something
600 years though it could be i don't
know
it's not the oldest house in the
hardbach valley
and you can see it's
built in 1508
so eat it at home you speak german
and there's it seems a lot of german
speakers and german culture here in
transylvania
so what exactly is going on
well this german culture here in
transylvania
i would say the transylvanian saxon
culture
is about 800 years old
wow people who afterwards who are called
transylvanian saxons came here in the
12th century called by
the then hungarian king
gaza ii he needed colonies
because he needed defenders for the
borders
just before i was due to say goodbye to
edith she said she had a very special
gift for me
and sure enough i had never in my life
received a gift like this before
whatever you can do
or dream you can repeat whatever you can
do
or dream you can dream you can oh
whatever you can do or dream you can
whatever you can do or dream
you can no you dream you can
whatever you can everything you can do

your personality perfectly
thank you
[Music]
finally it was time to leave i signed
edith's guestbook
where she collected little messages from
family and friends
who visited her over the years and
that was it
it's time to say goodbye which is always
really sad and i didn't like saying
goodbye but
here's my car so you better go
[Music]
down
[Laughter]
[Music]

cheers don't accept
invitations from total strangers if you
do if someone invites you make sure that
