this is why i'm here road's like this
[Applause]
this summer with the pandemic having
shattered all of my travel plans
i decided to set off on an adventure in
the country where i was born poland
it wasn't gonna be easy this is too much
i don't know how much more i wish i can
handle
so here's the challenge i decided that i
would cycle across
the entire country from the western
border with germany
to the eastern border with ukraine using
paper maps
only to guide me i estimated the
distance to be around
kilometers and gave myself 10 days to
complete the journey
the reason why i decided to cycle across
the country using paper maps only no
google maps no navigation apps
is because this journey is an homage to
my late
grandfather a man who inspired all of my
travels
he was a grand character a world
traveler in the pre-internet days
a travel writer this journey is for him
and i'll tell you a little bit more
about the amazing legacy that he left
behind
on day six for now i still need to get
ready for the adventure
a lot of planning goes into these things
the main challenge with this route is
that it leads along the southern border
of the country which means
[Music]
mountains
[Music]
this measures distances this is about 10
kilometers on the map
1 20
30 100 all right
this is my first destination
[Music]
a few more last minute fixes that i need
to do on the bike
[Music]
[Applause]
so
on the surface it seems like everything
is right the bike is ready
the gear is ready but i don't feel ready
like
i'm doing what tomorrow
but i think it's moments like this where
you have to really remind yourself
step by step just take it one step at a
[Music]
time
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
is
foreign
so this is the cool thing about riding
without google maps is that you get to
ask people for directions interact with
them and
i don't know there's something about
like a simple human interaction
like even just smiling and saying hello
that instagram makes you feel better
[Music]
[Applause]
this feels like the edge of the world
some of the villages here are just so
you know remote i haven't seen a car
here in
maybe half an hour
[Music]
his hair is steep ah i can not
ride up i can barely push the bike
i just broke the chain
oh my god i have no idea
how to fix it
never done this before i better get off
the road
i was changing gears and i think i did
something wrong i guess i just put the
chain on the wheelie thing
is it that easy really whoa
i think i did it
[Music]
i think we did it look oh it's back on
christ is fully averted well not fully
because then there was more of this
day one was my first test i rode from
the german border to somewhere here
it doesn't look like much and i was
under my target with only 90 and not 100
kilometers for the day
[Music]
i'm sitting down here trying to figure a
way out of the town
and on to my next well the next sort of
village
and it's so tempting to just want to
open up google maps and
check the directions but i'm not going
to do it
i'm not going to do it i'm going to keep
using this
doing this the old school way
[Music]
it's cold and it's raining
i hate these traps oh my god especially
in the rain
they make so much noise let it keep
going
rain or shine gotta keep going
[Music]
finally made it to my campsite for the
night it's quite happening
um there's like camper vans and rvs and
families
i'm glad to be among people i think this
is going to be a pretty relaxing night
when i looked at the map i saw some
progress though i was still painfully
close to my starting point
but i rode 100k that day
[Music]
here is an amazing plate full of pirogi
this is pretty much
carb fest so they're like pockets of
dough
filled with potatoes and cheese and
mushrooms and cabbage this is amazing
and exactly what i need right now
because i've got another 80kg
[Music]
i quickly realized that every day had
the potential to become an emotional
roller coaster
so much pain day three
sucks oh pain everywhere
an hour later i found a reason to be
grateful i really hope that nobody minds
this it looks like
it's nobody's apple tree
hmm amazing
it's 9 30 p.m and i've just
reached the campsite finally i've kind
of um
entered it from like a side entrance not
the main entrance because there's nobody
there everything's shut
i just set up my tent i'm so exhausted
all i want to do is just
fall asleep finally i was starting to
see progress
but 150k was a massive energy spend
i could barely stand it turns out that
yesterday i cycled something crazy like
140 150k
no wonder i'm still feeling totally
exhausted this is one of the
problems with not using google maps
one of the challenges is that you just
cannot know the real distance
because it's so hard to tell on a paper
map
when you get lost you could be adding
easily 15k to the journey like i did
yesterday
so it was a long ride i think i'm gonna
take it a little bit more easy today
[Music]
okay
[Music]
[Music]
honestly there's not much of a choice
there's only this
potato puree with cheese and
uh tomatoes but i would need hot water
for this
nice and thick perfect
okay the first time that a local wasn't
100 right
the campsite wasn't actually very far
and i made it there within 15 minutes
wow this campsite is so cool
look at these trees
[Music]
oh my god
[Music]
oh my god this isn't blind
that night i found myself roughly at the
halfway point
getting here wasn't easy and i knew that
the days ahead would be even harder
even that motor 70k felt like a big
achievement
this is why i'm here road's like this
[Laughter]
[Music]
yes
foreign
[Music]
is
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
he was like aren't you to ride all alone
no no it's good it's like wow you're
really brave
there's something about positive human
energy that gives you energy in turn
those people really helped me stay
motivated and they probably didn't
even realize it over 500 kn
it's been a really grueling five days i
managed to
do about 500 kilometers though there's a
leak here
on my bike which is a long distance
and i just need some rest i need my
muscles to recover
so today i'm just here relaxing
listening to the rain reading looking at
the map again
that day sitting alone in my tent i
thought back to the person that inspired
this adventure
my granddad he was a true world traveler
visiting far away corners of the world
in the pre-internet days
every time he came back from a trip he
would shape his journals into travel
books
chronicles of adventure after he passed
away
i recreated his presence in my life by
diving into them
browsing them reading them there's a
quote that i read in one of my
grandfather's chronicles
which i had on my mind a lot while i was
cycling and especially when things got
tough
and this is it in translation i've
noticed one thing changing in me
i've lost all my rush
kilometers no longer impress me whether
there's
100 200 or 600 of them i'm indifferent
to that
because i have to cross that distance
anyway
so i'm not scared of distances anymore
and the same applies to time whether i'm
meant to be on the road for
three hours or 17 what's the difference
either way i have to reach my
destination
i don't get stressed out by the slow
sometimes
tortoise-like speeds
i simply get into my vehicle and i ride
as far and
for as long an absolute peace until i
reach the destination that i have set
for myself
i also donate the discomforts bother me
such as
tough seat the heat the dust or the lack
of water
all of this in its own way is beautiful
and wonderful
whoever cannot adapt to this kind of
life or in fact
whoever cannot come to love this kind of
life
cannot be a true traveler to be a true
traveler
requires character
[Music]
i just made a grave error
i left my shoes outside for the night by
accident and it rained
a lot this is what happened
they are completely completely soaked
when i took out the socks earlier
look what happens the shoes are the same
i now have two choices a wear those wet
shoes
and who's being cold and miserable and b
were my flip-flops
very uncomfortable to ride in but at
least i'm not going to be thinking about
my wet shoes every single moment
of the ride
[Music]
this is too much i don't know how much
more
always i can handle
i've been on the road for three hours
and i feel like i haven't moved an
inch i've just been pushing the bike up
these
hills
don't know where i'm going
the bike is just too heavy and there's
nothing here
that it that's not essential
oh yeah and uh stupid flip-flops
because my trainers are still
wet
[Music]
for this
there's a reason why people don't do
this kind of stuff in
10 days
and with zero experience and with
google maps
it's just really difficult because i
don't know how much longer it is
i have no idea maybe
250 maybe 400 kilometers i have no way
of knowing
i thought that the whole route would be
700 but
i am at around 600 already and
i'm nowhere near my goal
and it's just really tough
the bike's really heavy and it's a
really long way
and i need to pee but this stupid
cycling is so
difficult to take off oh my god
it's like impossible you have to like
undress completely to go
at that moment i thought back to a
conversation i had with someone
really special just before starting my
trip
her name is vedangi and she's the
youngest woman to have circumnavigated
the world
on a bicycle solo i needed to hear her
advice again if you feel tired
stop and do something else and then keep
going
so don't think of it as 100 kilometers
think of it as chunks of five chunks of
20 kilometers
i have mantras written on my bike so my
my my mantra for my around the world was
hard in the
top i think one of my coping mechanisms
it's like
with with quitting is like i try and
shift that emotion to being grateful
about what i'm doing where i am
and the fact that i'm able to do it and
i think
of the times when i've literally craved
like doing that or like
when i was probably you know stuck in a
university lecture
and then i was thinking dreaming of
being outside and doing
surgical activity and you know and kind
of
really not taking what you're doing for
granted yeah
like force your brain to think
positively
yep that's exactly it
yes we keep going
[Music]
i'm so exhausted i think this is
one of the most difficult things i've
ever done
[Music]
ever
[Music]
today i don't even have a map
today all i have is a very general map
of poland
and i've got
this a list of the towns
that i need to cross in order to get to
my destination
for the day i forgot to buy a map for
this region
or i lost it i don't know what happened
i don't have it
so this this is my most important
possession for today
thankfully going down still very much
doable
by this point as hard as it was to
believe i knew i was getting
really close to the finish line i was so
focused on the cycling that i almost
stopped filming
by the end of day 8 i had cycled over
700k
day nine the last big day
there was silence in my mind the only
thing that mattered was getting to the
next stop
i couldn't have predicted that total
exhaustion could turn
into indomitable strength
today is the last day it's hard to
believe but
there's only 20 miles left and
it's hard to believe because it's been
such a difficult journey it's been so
tough
that all i can think about now is just
getting to the end
and getting off the bike and not cycling
[Music]
again
ladies and gents is the last roundabout
in poland and the last village in poland
right here that i'm passing
next up
[Music]
oh my god
i made it
germany all the way to the ukraine i'm
here
i crossed all of poland on
this on a bicycle
i can't believe it i'm here
this is amazing that was it i had cycled
across poland
west to east covering 890 kilometers
in 10 days i'm happy and proud
and grandpa
if you were here i hope that this would
make you proud too
never cycling again though honestly
never you'll never see me on a bike ever
again
i promise it's now two weeks later and i
still
can't believe i actually did that it's
crazy
and i'll tell you a little secret i
actually did this cycling trip
with no prior training before that trip
the longest distance i had ever cycled
in my life was like 20 kilometers so
there's reason to be proud there's just
one more thing
that i feel like i need to say about
that journey i feel like it wasn't my
body that got me there
it was definitely my mind that got me
there so much of our strength and our
resilience and our power and our
determination
it's here and here it's not
always just about what your body is
capable of
it's about what your mind can
do it's about how effectively you can
convince your mind to do things that you
never thought were possible before
remember this the world belongs to the
brave and bravery
is all in your mind and in your heart if
