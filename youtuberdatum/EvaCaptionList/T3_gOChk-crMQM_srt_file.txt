hey everybody ava here and welcome to
afghanistan
yes that's right i'm traveling here for
the next two weeks
and you might think i'm completely mad
for even being here in the first place
given the security situation in much of
afghanistan but i'm not
here to bring you more news items no i'm
here
as a simple tourist i'm here to see some
of the heritage
the culture some of the nature the
beauty of this country
and i hope that in this vlog you'll see
a slightly
different kind of afghanistan the one
that you don't often see
in mass media this is going to be a
crazy
roller coaster tour all right first
things first
what on earth is that behind me
i'm here with my guy to afghanistan
ghoul
hi so gould this place looks absolutely
insane incredible what is it this is
buddha
buddha of bomyan this is the second
largest standing buddha in the world
but unfortunately this was destroyed in
2001
by the taliban here's how this place
looked just 20 years ago
the buddhas of bamiyan used to be actual
giant statues of the buddha
built in the 6th century they stood here
for 1
400 years at the heart of the ancient
silk route
that is until the taliban blew them up
in one of the most heartbreaking acts of
cultural destruction
[Music]
so the crazy thing is you can actually
go inside the monastery complex
and we're going to go all the way to the
top of
of the buddha but first i want to show
you
this place this used to be
one of the places where the monks that
lived here meditated
wow that's unbelievable
this is original paint from
1 500 years ago they say it's actually
probably the oldest example of
oil painting in the entire world
can you imagine one thousand five
hundred one thousand six hundred years
ago
being a monk right here in bamiyan in
this buddhist monastery
and then meditating every day with this
view
a view that's remained unchanged since
then
[Music]
i'm gonna venture a wild guess and say
that you've probably never heard of this
place
well not until now and this is only the
beginning now before we move on to our
next destination
we've got a small errand to run and that
is
getting a local dress tailor-made at the
local tailors in the city
let's go
[Music]
all right we have come to the taylor to
get me sized up
and get a camis
which is a sort of like a longer shirt
made for me
custom custom-made
i'm just standing here on the second
floor of the bamiyan bazaar which is the
main bazaar or
marketplace of bamiyan the town that
we're in right now here i've got nazima
yeah
and together we're going to be going to
bandyamir
yeah what can you tell us about bamyan
i think it's the most beautiful class in
the
maybe world in the world yeah and you
can see
the clear weather the blue
sky everything here is neutral
yeah if you come you'll like it
absolutely i'm loving it it's so
beautiful out here
next up a quick roadside snack before we
keep going
is like one of the most popular street
snacks in afghanistan
and it's vegetarian it's got some
potatoes and some
spring onions inside it's absolutely
delicious deep fried
just amazing i think one of my favorite
dishes that i've tried so far here all
right here we got some freshly made
bolani with some spicy chili sauce
let's try
[Music]
fast bite
so good it's still warm fresh off the
pan
light and delicious
we have just come to the crafts bazaar
there's plenty of shops here where women
specifically women sell beautiful
handmade handicrafts
dresses jewelry rugs carpets
all sorts of beautiful local things so
let's see
what we can find
ah how does it look good nice
so we're about to get an upgraded
version of this hat
with some amazing jewelry oh my god
deluxe wow
yeah look nice how is it oh my gosh
yeah right i feel so special wearing
this it's almost like a crown for a
princess
[Music]
you know it feels quite special to be
able to take a look around here in this
shop and see so many
unique things and souvenirs this is
definitely not your typical
souvenir shop with you know fridge
magnets and
stickers now this is really special
really really special you rarely get to
see this kind of stuff
[Music]
all the rugs and carpets that you see
here behind me are made
by hand by women who work here locally
and all of them are created with natural
dyes
so beautiful but you know what the
saddest
thing is that there's nobody here to buy
all these beautiful
items and pieces of jewelry and carpets
because there are barely any tourists in
afghanistan
for understandable reasons the situation
in terms of security is not great yet
so very few people come to visit but
maybe that will change in the future
hold on i need to make a quick
disclaimer before i keep going
afghanistan is not a safe place to visit
even bamiyan the province that i
traveled to which is probably the safest
of all afghan provinces
experienced a very recent terrorist
attack and without trying to glorify
danger or risk because i
really am not that kind of person i just
need you to keep in mind that traveling
to afghanistan carries a lot of risk you
could get yourself
stopped jailed captured kidnapped or
worse so i'm not recommending that
anybody travel to afghanistan without
doing
proper research and due diligence and
risk assessment
all right that in mind let's keep going
check this out looks like we have
supplies for several days so
where are we going and why do we need
all this stuff now we are going for
adventure trip to bandyamir
and we will stay one night here with the
local people amazing
let's do it
[Music]
we're just on our way to bandi amir lake
which is one of the most popular tourism
destinations
well made by popular tourism
destinations i mean it's still
not very commonly visited because there
aren't that many tourists
here mostly domestic tourists so i
thought i'll take this opportunity to
ask who
behind me who is my guide to talk a
little bit about
tourism in afghanistan and whether it's
even good for afghanistan
to have tourism at this point i think
afghanistan
has a rich history and afghanistan has
a rich culture afghanistan has unique
people
i am sure this tourism or tourists
can can change the
the concept and the view of the people
and help help us to get back
to the to the normal life that we had in
60s 70s
so i think tourists will help
economic and also tourists will help
afghanistan connected with the world
yeah
yeah and that's a really interesting
perspective because tourism can
sometimes be
harmful but sometimes it can really if
done in the right ways it can really
help
revive an interesting culture it can
help
um support natural places and national
parks
and i think that's why it's always
important to consider that you know
places like afghanistan even though they
don't have tourists
right now they could in the future and i
hope
that they do yeah we hope yeah
meanwhile the road was taking us further
into the mountains
we were about to enter afghanistan's
very first national park
bandiami some call it the grand canyon
of afghanistan
whoa the wind is so so strong but
this is the spot where we get to see the
lake for the first time
it's covered with ice and snow
back in the car please
[Music]
we can make it you think yeah we will
this snowy road was barely passable even
for a 4x4
some of the locals that we ran into on
our way weren't quite as lucky
just got a shovel to dig them out
meanwhile
nazima and i are here comfortable and
warm in the car
having some lunch
success gore told us some pretty
terrifying stories of how he got stuck
on this road a few years back
road assistants would not be able to
help you out here
oh we have just arrived in our guest
house for the next couple of days
and we're staying with a local family
which is
amazing it turned out that we were the
only visitors not just in the guesthouse
but in the entire village
our host stoked the fire in the buhari
and invited us for a few cups of that
famous green afghan tea
[Music]
good morning we've just come out on a
walk around the lake which is going to
take us a few hours
and we're here in the middle of the main
village of bandyamir which
in normal times gets quite touristy
yesterday the lady who is hosting us
told us that 20 30 years ago there will
be a hundred cars here every single day
filled with tourists but right now as
you can see
we're the only ones here
[Music]
yeah because it's winter we can actually
walk
across the lake on the ice i haven't
done this since i was like four years
old in poland when the winter is back
home
used to be quite cold but
here we are frozen lake
[Music]
amazing
[Music]
the funny thing is that we've been
hearing rumblings
underneath the ice and you know when
you're in the middle of a frozen lake
you hear this like
these deep cracks sounds a little bit
scary
let me put it that way
[Music]
what about you
[Music]
wow
now let's pause for just a second i have
a question for you
after what you've seen so far would you
ever travel to afghanistan
let me know in the comments below i'm
super curious to read your answers
oh my god look at this oh
i still have some way to go
[Music]
i think the fastest way to come down
[Music]
do this
this feels like climbing everest
right now oh my god
[Music]
it took us some time to get out of the
snow but after hiking 14 kilometers we
came back to the village feeling cold
and wet
but oh so accomplished
finally we've arrived we're back home
back in the guest house
and hopefully soon we'll be getting some
warm tea
oh to recover from that long walk oh
all i want to do is lay down for a
minute so we are so
chilly so far that we've grabbed
sleeping bags
and good news is we got back
just in time because it literally just
started snowing and raining outside
so lucky yes
[Music]
this is what i've been waiting for for
the last couple of hours
like coming back from the mountain i was
just dreaming of
food like this warm and fresh
and delicious
[Music]
um
[Music]
what do we have here uh rice and milk
and with butter it's going to be very
delicious homemade
food what's the name in sherbringe
sherbringe milk branches rice
milk and rice
[Music]
all right let's have the first our first
taste of sheer bridge
local rice pudding
hmm that's really really good it's very
filling
very creamy delicious i imagine this is
the kind of food
that would give you a feeling of warmth
and strength in a very very deep dark
winter
this this is quite special we're here at
the lake bandi amir lake
dressed up in traditional afghan clothes
and we're about to do
a little photo shoot so when do you wear
clothes like

days and we even have
a horse to accompany us on our photo

nazima was on the horse
and suddenly the horse decides to just
follow its own path
go back home and nazima on top here are
the results of our photoshoot that
morning

burning question that i'm sure you're
