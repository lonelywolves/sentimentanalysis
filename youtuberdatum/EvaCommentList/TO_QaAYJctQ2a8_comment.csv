"@amazing facts hilarious! Thanks for a good laugh. Reinvent history all you want, and talk all you want but It is known as propaganda and delusion. I believe in giving credit where credit is due.<br />History shows that the credit goes to the Indian continent, in fact the Punjab cuturral region specifically which extends over into India, not Pakistan as a newly formed state. It happens to be in present day Pakistan. No more, no less!<br />In fact anything more is in fact pure rubbish. <br />Gotta love idiocy!",Tony noname,2021-04-16T17:24:00Z,0

"The Pakistani Punjab retains a thriving culture in music and cuisine, though in everyday life the people seem to prefer speaking in Urdu. The Sindhi, Balochi and Pashtun cultures are very striking and distinctive in their own ways. What is alien there is what was taken from here, the heartland of northern India: the Urdu speaking &quot;mohajir&quot;  culture that&#39;s owned by a small minority but routinely imposed on a diverse majority.",Somashankar Bhattacharya,2021-03-25T15:37:06Z,0
No body actually imposed anything. It is so bad you have been brainwashed into thinking. That. Muslims of subcontinent are of different ethnicities so a common culture which is often refer as mughal culture or official culture is there. In pakistan it onky belongs to the capital. You need to worry more as in kahsmir people are forced to speak urdu instead of kashmiri.<br />Not in pakistan.<br />People judge punjab by lahore which is a metropolitan city. And have migrants from all over Pakistan.<br />People there switch between urdu and punjabi<br />But interior punjab all speaks punjabi. And in pakistan punjab not all speak punjab. Half of them speak potohari and siraki.,amazing facts,2021-04-16T15:02:30Z,0

"@Lipardo&#39;s Global Kitchen <br />Thank you.<br />I&#39;ve done much of this already, understanding also the vast cultural differences and ensuring my own respect of, and towards, said differences. I do have a couple of friends whom are native to Pakistan, though not currently living in country, but whom have given some good insights also. <br />You are correct, I ought to learn some urdu. I must admit though, I am a wee bit intimidated by it. It is such a beautiful language in my view, not only audibly but also in written form... I simply do not wish to muck it <a href=""http://up.lol/"">up.lol</a>.<br />Thank you again dear sister, bless your own future travels and your lovely heart.💝",Mama Marianovits,2021-03-12T06:22:13Z,1
"@Abdul Hameed <br />Sooooo, rather than actually addressing what I have said, or why, you have chosen to become defensive while insisting you&#39;ve &quot;said nothing wrong&quot;. <br />Okay my friend, no problem....but.... the fact is, you opened yourself up to challenge when you choose to reject what was presented to you by the op, insisting that the op HAD to have chosen Pakistan because of a Pakistani man. Again, the fact of the matter is, you DO NOT KNOW the reasons and, unless it is shared, it is really not your business to make such statements of surety. <br /><br />And please, simply because you do not like what I have said, or perhaps fail to understand it, this does not make me negative... it is simply sharing the truth... inconvenient to you or not. I am a very positive person, never slinging abuse or calling names, always loving others enough to be truthful with them.<br />Bless your heart.",Mama Marianovits,2021-03-12T06:16:36Z,0
@Mama Marianovits I didn&#39;t said anything wrong. Please u start thinking positive,Abdul Hameed,2021-03-11T16:35:20Z,0
"@Mama Marianovits Thanks so much! Before traveling to any country, you have to research first (to acquaint yourself) the country&#39;s background when it comes to culture, religion, etc. Plan how you&#39;ll travel like for example... using a tour guide or availing a tour package. There are some restricted areas in Pakistan.  Learn some basic Urdu phrases for easy communication because not everyone is English literate and some of them can hardly understand our accent. Always carry some photocopies of your documents. Bargain in any market because prices are not fixed. Anyway, Pakistanis are warm &amp; hospitable. I have a video regarding things you should know before going to Pakistan discussing about the weather, what clothes to wear, etc. Warmest regards! Keep safe.",Lipardo's Global Kitchen,2021-03-11T08:43:18Z,1
"@Lipardo&#39;s Global Kitchen <br />Bless your dear heart, home is exactly where we choose to make it... even if others fail to comprehend such.<br />I have thought to travel to Pakistan myself after falling in love with the sights online. It seems as such a rich diversity of geography and of population, with very many beautiful excursions to be had indeed.<br />Have you any tips to give me for my travels, specifically as single woman traveling alone.?",Mama Marianovits,2021-03-11T05:40:13Z,1

"Sindu civilisation was the oldest of all dates back to more then 8000 years old the name Hindustan and Hinduism came after the people who  lived near sindhu river.... But then came the Mughals who looted and destroyed every thing the history, culture, all and forcibly converted every one wherever they went ,and barbaricly killed whoever resisted... Respect the people of Pakistan ... but once they were also the part of this great culture before being converted from Hinduism to islam.",vinod sanil,2020-04-27T10:48:36Z,1

Unfortunately Pakistan has lost their original culture and heritage. They have embraced Islam which is a part of Arab imperialism and which discourages the indigenous culture and heritage not suitable to it. Pakistan has lost their Aryan Sindhi culture and becoming a middle eastern Arab cultural.,Rajib Chowdhury,2020-04-21T04:47:53Z,0

"I am a Pakistani! I really love this amazing video of Pakistan. <br /><br />And a fun fact about me: I don&#39;t know Urdu. Yep! When I was 1 year old my family moved to London since we couldn&#39;t find a job in Pakistan. I then grew up in there and when I was 5, I moved to Glasgow. Afterwards I had my 6th birthday there with a bouncy castle, I miss the old days. We moved back to London where I had my 7th birthday. In September 24th we planned to go to Pakistan in November. We did and I lived in Rehman Garden (in lahore next to mall of defence) over there. We spent 3 months over there,then my 8th birthday happened over there. Then we moved to Askari 11 (also in lahore). I feel so happy new shops are opening here and I love the sohail store. I turned 9 and my father came back from London (He moved to Pakistan with us, but needed to keep working so he went back.) and on October 16, I will be 10!<br /><br /><br />If you made it this far in the story, here is a trophy.<br /><br />🏆🏆🏆🏆🥇🥇🥇🥇👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼<br /><br />And again, Thanks for this video. ❤",꧁ classyxcat ꧂,2019-09-10T12:30:14Z,0

We wonder why Sikhs, Tamils, Assamese, Bihari, Gujarati are all in one union of nations the indian union. Unions never work like soviet union.",K Sal,2019-05-07T13:54:25Z,1

Yes you are right. You would wish to know many things about something when you love those things. Probably you know many many things about Pakistan but you never tried to study or observe the tradition and classical handmade things. This video will help you increase your knowledge about the things which you couldn&#39;t get during your stay in Pakistan.

"Eva, thank you so much for this! I write this in tears and a heavy heart that these people, my people, who are great artists, have been forgotten. We have left art to the work of capitalists who sell brands not art. While true artists have been left to labour perpetually in a state that could be hardly called living. And I have one word for someone like you who has ventured out to them; &quot;khubsurat&quot;. Keep smiling! :)",Hira Islam,2019-02-14T18:38:58Z,0

"This is what our media should be promoting; the culture of Pakistan but what they are doing instead? Political talk shows, a culture that is making the Pakistani Nation, &#39;News hungry&#39;. They want something to happen everyday...no matter how bad...they want News and behind the scenes news...and more news and bull(politicains)-baiting and analysis of the self-proclaimed yellow journalists. If I were Imran Khan, I would only allow those channels to run, who would produce 50% of their programs of on Science and technology and education, 20 % for children promoting good values in them, 20 per cent for entertainment and only ten per cent for news including just one talk show in a month like a Hardtack on the BBC.

"Oldest culture mentioned above isn&#39;t actually pakistani (pakistan word itself is less than 100 years old), ask most they consider themselves as decendents of arabs, turks, persians and what not (except Indian). Ask most pakistanis their history doesn&#39;t even start till mohammad bin qasim came over early 700 AD to loot wealth killed indigenous population enslaved local girls take back to arabia. If that is true then how can they also claim a history existed about 2000/3000/4000 years ago ? Truth is that 90% are Indian decents (get DNA done anytime) and whole North West India is part of above mentioned culture and civilization.
