"Hi everyoneeeee! I&#39;m so happy to see that so many of you can relate to what I said about hospitality at the end of the video. Every time I stay with a family in a new country, I do it in order to meet ordinary people from that country. I&#39;ve always been fascinated with remote places and traditional village lives, and this is a wonderful insight into another culture.  ❤️",Eva zu Beck,2020-08-09T20:08:23Z,1242

"Berbers are my ansectors. My great grandfathers last name was berber, from morroco. Berber people are mountain people , they have their own community. And the middle east in general adopts the originally islamic practices like men and women being separate at times, this is to respect the women and uplift them, something western culture misunderstands and media shows misinformation.

It’s 2021 now and people in most places of Morocco are still living in 1921. Thanks to a corrupt king and false prophet who takes all the country’s income and keeps it for himself. People who speak up for their rights go to jail for 20 years. Morocco has both a beautiful and very ugly face. The regime tries to hide the ugly one for tourists and the rest of the world.

"This video makes me remember my childhood memories.  Although I grew up in the city, on vacation my father always send me in the village .  The land of the ancestors. One day I went with my uncle to hunt rabbits. We were on horseback.  I fell off the mountainside and injured my neck.  Because of me, my uncle was reprimanded by my grandfather.  Another day, I went with some kids to get water .  Suddenly, it was raining.  Those boys left me with a family that I did not know.  So as not to catch a cold.  I remember how that lady treated me.  Like I was her son.  I changed my clothes, cleaned me and served me food.  In the Badia are people you cannot find in the world in which we live.  Unfortunately I can&#39;t go there anymore.  My grandfather and my grandmother are deads.  As for my uncle, he lives in the Netherlands",adil nomidia kingdom,2021-02-09T23:30:52Z,0

"Merci ,fabuleusee Éva et permettez moi de vous nommer : &quot; Femme du monde &quot; . Le choix d&#39;une famille du Maroc &quot; profond &quot; pour partager quelques moments avec elle ce n&#39;est totalement facile vue les circonstances mais elle est sûrement possible pour des gens aventuriers comme vous chère Éva . C&#39;est vrai que la vie de la famille choisie  est  en quelque sorte modeste , mais elle est pleine de chaleur , d&#39; hospitalité et de générosité . Elle restera , si je peux dire ,une vie parmi d&#39;autres  qui sont peut-être aisées mais qui manque de chaleur humaine . Le confort n&#39;est pas toujours ce qu&#39;on croit pour trouver les vraies valeurs sincères pour un vrai partage humain . J &#39; espére que ce voyage et ce partage marquera un bon  souvenir , loin de tout oublié , de ce pays plein de belles choses ,qui est le Maroc ma chère patrie .Je tire chapeau à cette famille hospitalière , je vous tire un autre également et je vous dis encore merci Éva - Femme du monde .💐",Rani Sari,2021-01-22T10:22:30Z,0

"Pauvre peuple miséreux et pauvre écrasé par un régime monarchique, archaïque moyenâgeux et dictatoriale. Le peuple marocain souffre tandis que le roi est multi milliardaire. Près de 40 pour cent du PIB , soit la totalité des richesses produites dans le pays, sont le fait de holdings appartenant au roi dictateur et pilleur Mohamed 6 . Vive le peuple opprimé et miséreux marocain. Le tourisme n’aide pas le peuple mais justifie et défend cette dictature.",Sabah Aouad,2021-01-17T17:50:29Z,0

So you live the moment like the view the people and there hospitality and you still call them berbers shame on you ... Just a little research you will find berbers means berbarians so if you don&#39;t know that now i&#39;m telling you<br /> and if you didn&#39;t at least give some word about that you are not welcome to our lands ... Again<br />If they know english or anh language and they know that you called them that berbarians they well shut thr doors on your face 😒 actually i&#39;m joking we didn&#39;t do that hhh but stop calling them berbers or i will called you another B word<br />Dislike from me,Mohamed Atmane,2021-01-11T13:05:55Z,0

"(And whosoever has Fear (Taqwa) of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out. And He will provide him from where he never could imagine.) meaning, whoever has Fear (Taqwa) of Allah in what He has commanded and avoids what He has forbidden, then Allah will make a way out for him from every difficulty and will provide for him from resources he never anticipated or thought about. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, &quot;The most comprehensive Ayah in the Qur&#39;an is,<br />وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]<br /><br /><br /><b>(Verily, Allah enjoins Al-`Adl (justice) and Al-Ihsan (doing good) (16:90).

"The reality is we should be thankful to all indigenous people,wild animals and the Earth for the hospitality this planet provides us with, and to these people - for their healthy ways which in spoiled West are forgotten, resulting in diseases, wars and abuse among the members of the community. This us the greatest gift of your channel - it can help to preserve the sense of rawness we have to adopt in the cities and villages in the west, if we are to stay sustainable and healthy and actually lead good lives. It&#39;s sustainable to organize the society to experience a down to earth lifestyle, with the protection and help for basic survival provided by new technology. We have to learn to be more Berber in our homes and realize the hospitality and abundance of the Earth we are graced with in every season. <br /><br />I&#39;m not romanticizing either. Living a harsh life is usually healthier for your Spirit. the Tibetan people and indigenous communities of Latin America are other examples of what living in nature does to the mind and how simplicity and hardships in the physical reality, can be beneficial for the personal growth of humanity. It&#39;s not a formula, yet generally a lot of people become happier and healthier, leading a more simple, basic life.<br /><br />On the other hand individuals who can&#39;t do that, may be expressing their gratefulness for what they already own more frequently, for us to have a balanced society and higher levels of satisfaction, living in modern day cities with lots of commodities. thank you for your videos",maiego selfuu,2020-11-08T08:53:30Z,2

"💎<br />تعريف بالنبي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23the_prophet_muhammad"">#The_Prophet_Muhammad</a><br /><br />Unlike the founders of many religious, the final prophet of Islam is a real documented and historical figure. He lived in the full light of history, and the most minute details of his life are known. Not only do Muslims have the complete text of God’s words that were revealed to Muhammad, but they have also preserved his sayings and teachings in what is called ‘Hadeeth’ literature.<br />This having been said, it should be understood that Muslims believe that the Prophet Muhammad was only a man chosen by God, and that he is not divine in any way. In order to avoid the misguided wish to deify him, the Prophet Muhammad taught Muslims to refer to him as ‘God’s Messenger and His Slave’. The mission of the last and final prophet of God was to simply teach that ‘there is nothing divine or worthy of being worshipped except for Almighty God’, as well as being a living example of God’s revelation. In simple terms, God sent the revelation to Muhammad, who in turn taught it, preached it, lived it and put it into practice.<br />In this way, Muhammad was more than just a ‘prophet’ in the sense of many of the Biblical prophets, since he was also a statesman and ruler. He was a man who lived a humble life in the service of God, and established an all-encompassing religion and way of life by showing what it means to be an ideal friend, husband, teacher, ruler, warrior and judge. For this reason, Muslims follow him not for his own sake, but in obedience to God, because Muhammad not only showed us how to deal with our fellow human beings, but more importantly, showed us how to relate to and worship God; worship Him in the only way pleasing to Him.<br />Like other prophets, Muhammad faced a great deal of opposition and persecution during his mission. However, he was always patient and just, and he treated his enemies well. The results of his mission were very successful, and even though his mission started in one of the most backward and remote places on earth, within a hundred years of the death of Muhammad, Islam had spread from Spain to China. The Prophet Muhammad was the greatest of all of God’s prophets, not because he had new doctrines or greater miracles, but because it was him who was chosen to bear the last revelation which would come to humanity from God, one suitable for all places, times, and people, everlasting and unchanging until the Last Day.<br /><br />One day President Nixon wanted to read about &quot;Islamic principles and rules&quot;, so he asked the CIA to prepare a research paper on the subject for me.<br />  He wrote a research paper following the orders of his president, but it was a bit long ...<br />  He asked his adviser, Robert Crane, to read and summarize the article.<br />  Robert read the article and summarized it for the president, but the contents of the article forced Robert to do more research on Islam, so he attended Islamic seminars and conferences to learn more about the subject.  Began to ...<br /> <br /> Then came the day when Robert converted to Islam, inspired by Islamic teachings, and word of his conversion spread throughout the United States.<br /><br />  After converting to Islam, he changed his Islamic name to &quot;Farooq Abdul Haq&quot;.<br /> <br />  Explaining the reason for converting to Islam, he says:<br />  As a law student, I found all the laws in Islam that I studied.<br />  I studied law at Harvard University for 3 years but I never found the word &quot;justice&quot; in their law, however.<br />  I have found this word frequently in Islam.<br /><br />  He converted to Islam in 1981 and named himself &quot;Farooq&quot; after Omar Farooq, who was the Imam of Justice after the Prophet.<br /><br />  He says: &quot;Once we were having a legal debate. A professor of Jewish law was also with us. When it was his turn to speak, he began to speak and ridicule Islam and Muslims in his speech.&quot;  Began to do .. When his demeanor began to exceed the limit, I decided to silence him ..<br />   I asked him: Do you know the extent of inheritance law in the US Constitution?<br />  He said: Yes, he has more than eight volumes.<br />  I said: If I bring you a law of inheritance which is not more than ten lines, will you believe that Islam is a true religion?<br />  He said: It is not possible that such a long and wide law of inheritance can be summed up in just ten lines ...<br />  I extracted the verses of inheritance from the Quran and presented it.<br /> <br />  A few days later he came to me and said: It is not possible for a human mind to cover all its close relatives to such an extent that it leaves no one behind and then distribute the inheritance among them so justly that  Don&#39;t oppress anyone ...<br />  Then this Jew converted to Islam.  !!<br /> <br /> Dr. Robert Crane (Farooq) is still alive..he has reached the age of 91. He is happy to spread the candles of Islam in America according to his vastness and power ...<br /> May Allah light millions of lamps from their lamps.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23%D9%82%D8%B5%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85"">#قصة_اسلام</a>",The truth seeker عدراس,2020-10-28T22:27:13Z,2

Iam now in New York and I really miss home and my parents very much. I was born in the countryside and I know exactly what does it mean all those things you have experienced and seen. I hope you will visit Morocco again and again and see different places and share it with other people.Thanks To Allah islam taught us how to be nice to all the people no matter who they are and where they are from besides Moroccan people are very distinguished in the world from other countries.

"This is an amazing footage! Thank you for sharing this beautiful experience with these amazing people, they are truly kind and very generous. I am from Tunisia, and I felt very connected to their habits and traditions. Khobz tabouna and zeit zeitouna (olive oil) are still one of our favorite snacks even though we live a more modernized life style. However, even in Tunisia, some people in rural areas are still following a traditional life style and surviving with the little things they have. People in the big cities also like to come back to the villages, where they can enjoy the peace and serenity of the nature, and feel connected to the old habits such as cooking on the Afiya (fire) and roaming in the wild.",Oumaima Hamila,2020-09-05T20:10:55Z,1

"I&#39;m moroccan; one day a friend of me and i decided to give a visit to a teacher friend of us who got the opportunity to teach in a school in an Berber village in the mountainy suburbs of Marrakech, a place that they call Agrda a few kilometres above Ijoukak, it was a journey of 100 kilometres from home to there. Anyway, the friend that i went with has an uncle in that village who after turned out to be guesting us. When we arrived there we met our friend and stayed a little bit in his place the uncle of the other friend came to take us to his place, and when we were in our way there my teacher friend told me that when we get to the house and sit the old man won&#39;t let us bend our legs when we sit on the floor, bacause they believe that when you do so that&#39;s a sign thatyou&#39;re not being comfortable and instead you should sit with your legs straight as if you&#39;re in your home, however i wanted to try sitting bending my legs to see the man&#39;s reaction when we get home and when i did that he took my legs and straightened them and was saying something in Amazigh language like &quot;feel comfortable&quot; and things like that. People there are trully nice, loving and have th sould of hospitality that lots of people in the cities lack, we were overwhelmed during the 2 days we spent there ❤️",Amine Des,2020-09-01T17:33:06Z,0

"Morocco, Yemen, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan... interesting that most of the places this girl goes to are in the Muslim World. I enjoy these videos and I’m grateful she steers clear of politics and tropes. But what on earth gave her the idea that she’s welcome in these places? Sure, she got a Visa from an authoritarian government but I wonder if she’s ever considered that people don’t want to see a foreign woman running around, hair uncovered, whooping on top of a Yemeni mountain. Although she’s anodyne and probably a good person, it’s the same Colonial attitude of centuries past: I’m white, I’m European and I have the right to go wherever the hell I want.",Hamzazaie,2020-08-30T17:21:39Z,0

"I love what your doing, travelling all over the world in parts that haven’t received much recognition. I have a question I’m sure you get often, I’ve seen your videos and you go to places like the Middle East. To me, especially as a woman, I would be extremely concerned with my safety. I know you have mentioned a thousand times before that the media puts out this image of these places being bad when they actually have such lovely people. But, you have to admit incidents do tend to happened in these areas, not only that but ISIS and the Taliban are still active. Do these ring true and do you  decide to travel  anyways or do you truly believe that these organizations aren’t as big as there made to seem? Thanks.",rowaboatpuddin,2020-08-29T07:08:44Z,0

"@Aymane Mabrouki North Africa has been occupied?? The Almohad slaughterd almost all the Arabs in the Maghreb, just take a look on the internet. The Arabs who survivded (maybe 1% of the population was Arab) married with Imazighen, and their childeren as well, so after 3/4 generations the whole arab dna was gone. I did a dna test, a lot of Moroccans who i know took a test as well, and NOBODY had middle eastern/arab dna, NOBODY! I said it before just have look at youtube and search for moroccan dna test and you will see. You are living in a lied dream you whole life😂 meskien he thought he has some Arab blood😂😂 here in europe all the Moroccans know they are Imazighen, also the Darija speaking ones.

"@Utrecht 030 I&#39;m not wrong. If you knew a bit of History you would know. North Africa has been occupied by Arabs for centuries, and Morocco has been the important center. Do you think all those arabs disappeared and didn&#39;t mix with the natives? If the Phoenicians, the cartaginians, the romans, the Byzantines, etc all of them mixed blood with moroccan natives, it is stupid to think Arabs didn&#39;t, when arabs are the ones who changed Morocco the most.

"This nearly got tears in my eyes .. to see where my parents had to raise me in the 90s and in more difficult conditions, the higher you get in the Atlas mountains the difficult it is to survive because of transportation and cold winters with no heat but the fire and if there is no wood there is no warm, we moved to a city when I was young but most of the locals still live the same way we used to except that there is a road now and network smartphones it&#39;s a bit easier but they still lack the medical attention and basic education because they cannot leave their lands they inherited for generations. <br />FOR THOSE WHO DONT KNOW AMAZIGH PEOPLE ARE THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF MAGHREB REGION ( MOST OF NORTH AFRICAN LANDS AND THE SAHARA DESERT ) there are so many different tribes of amazigh people and probably they all have almost the same genetics.",Maxx JuNioR,2020-08-27T02:11:20Z,73

"Am so proud of this girl,what she did and shared with the world,not many did,specially a woman.  Seriously made me have some tears. Those days people always show fear for people who are different,until they discover how wrong someone can be. Mostly the media shows you what they want you to know,which is mostly not always the truth for political reasons,or discrimination of races and religions, but in the end you see that all humans share the same planet,just with a twist according to their local situation or tradition or culture religion believes.but life and living has no difference,we all eat sleep and survive to keep going no matter how our individual situation is.. well done Eva am really proud !",Ben Northen,2020-08-27T00:11:06Z,0

"Here are some beautiful verses from the Holy Quran on the creation of the Earth and its beauty.<br /><br />1 – Surat Luqman: “Do you not see that Allah (swt) has made what is in the heaven and Earth subservient to you and made complete to you His favours outwardly and inwardly?” [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=31m20s"">31:20</a>]<br /><br />2 – Surat Al-Teen: “We have indeed created man in the best of moulds.” [95:4]<br /><br />3 – Surat Al-Sajdah: “He Who created all things in the best way and He began the creation of man from clay.” [32:7]<br /><br />4 – Surat Aale Imran: “And to Allah belongs the dominion of the Heaven and Earth, and Allah is over all things. Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and earth, and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding.” [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=3m18s"">3:18</a>9-190]<br /><br />5 – Surat Al-Roum: “Devote thyself single-mindedly to the faith, and thus follow the nature designed by Allah, the nature according to which He has fashioned mankind; there is no altering the creation of Allah.” [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=30m30s"">30:30</a>]<br /><br />6 – Surat Al-An’am: “And there is no animal that walks upon the Earth nor a bird that flies with its two wings but they are like yourselves; We have not neglected anything in the book, and then to their Lord shall they be gathered.” [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=6m38s"">6:38</a>]<br /><br />7 – Surat Luqman: “He created the heavens without pillars as you see them, and put mountains upon the Earth lest it might convulse with you, and H e spread it with animals of all kinds; and We sent down water from the clouds, then caused to grow therein (vegetation) of every noble kind.” [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=31m10s"">31:10</a>]<br /><br />8 – Surat Qaf: “And the Earth, We spread it out, and cast therein firmly set mountains and We have made to grow therein of all beautiful kinds; to give sight and as a reminder to every servant who turns to Allah.” [50:7-8]<br /><br />9 – Surat Al-Raad: “And it is He who spread the Earth and made in it firm mountains and rivers, and of all fruits, he has made in it two kinds; He makes the night cover the day; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect.” [13:3]<br /><br />10 – Surat Al-Raad: “It is He who shows you the lightning, causing fear and hope and who brings up the heavy cloud. And the thunder declares His glory and His praise, and the angels too for awe of Him; and He sends them thunderbolts and smites with them whom He pleases, yet they dispute concerning Allah, and He is mighty in prowess.” [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=13m13s"">13:13</a>-14]<br /><br />11 – Surat Al-Anbiyya: “Have those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the Earth were a joined entity,  and we separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe?” [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=21m30s"">21:30</a>]<br /><br />12 – Surat Al-Anbiyya: “And We made the sky a protected ceiling, but they, from its signs, are turning away.” [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=21m32s"">21:32</a>]<br /><br />13 – Surat Al-Nahl: “He causes to grow for you thereby herbage, and the olives, and the palm trees, and the grapes, and of all the fruits; most surely there is a sign in this for a people who reflect.” [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=16m11s"">16:11</a>]<br /><br />14 – Surat Al-Nahl: “And he has made subservient for you the night and the day and the sun and the moon, and the stars are made subservient by his commandment; most surely there are signs in this for a people who ponder.” [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=16m12s"">16:12</a>]<br /><br />15 – Surat Al-Nahl: “Eat of all the fruits and walk in the ways of your lord submissively. there comes forth from within it a beverage of many colours, in which there is healing for men; most surely there is a sign in this (life of bees) for a people who reflect.” [16:69]<br /><br />16 – Surat Al-An’am: “And it is He who sends down rain from the sky, and We produce thereby the growth of all things. We produce from it greenery from which We produce grains arranged in layers. And from the palm trees – of its emerging fruit are clusters hanging low. And [We produce] gardens of grapevines and olives and pomegranates, similar yet varied. Look at [each of] its fruit when it yields and [at] its ripening. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.” [6:99]<br /><br />17 – Surat Ghaafir: “It is Allah Who has made for you the earth as a resting place, and the sky as a canopy, and has given you shape and made your shapes beautiful and has provided for you sustenance.” [40:64]<br /><br />18 – Surat Al-Hijr: “And the Earth; we have spread it forth and made in it firm mountains and caused to grow in it every suitable thing.” [<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=15m19s"">15:19</a>]",Faez NK,2020-08-23T12:20:54Z,0

This is a message to the world .the percentage of amazigh people in Morocco is nearly 90 pecent .they don&#39;t live just in villages and country side they also live in cities . Moroccan culture is totally amazigh culture if you read about the history you will find it is  big Civilization .all the architectures and the mosaics curving .....are one hundred percent amazigh .I really don&#39;t know why tourists receive wrong information from tourist guide .and the majority think that Morocco is an Arab country ?!?!?! We are not Arabs we just speak Arabic because of Islam .70 percent of Moroccan people speak tamazight language fluently in all parts of Morocco.if I met you I would show you things you never seen before in Morocco and you will have the whole picture.the problem of tourist guide is that they sometimes misinform tourists which is wrong .on the other hand these small villages in the mountains in Morocco are marginalized by the government .this video really broke my heart because of the situation .you can&#39;t imagine how these people manage themselves in the winter and our civil society is doing its best to help these people but not all of them .,nomidia nomidia 1,2020-08-22T09:27:29Z,0

"2 years ago I toured through the Atlas mountains and surrounding area with my bicycle for 2 weeks and I ate a vegetable tajine at every opportunity, maybe once every 1 or 2 days. It took a week for me to learn that entire families often share a tajine the size of what I usually ate alone. Despite that, I lost 5 kilos in two weeks there. Morocco is great for vegans, by the way! I can also confirm that the Berber people are extremely kind and hospitable.  As a male, I had a very different experience and barely interacted with any women. It was nice and interesting to see what the experience is like from the perspective of a woman.  <br />Also, that was top quality content. Thanks!",Max Kueng,2020-08-21T23:40:25Z,82

"First of all, thank you deeply and intensely for your feelings and your radiant honesty of sincerity for these unforgettable moments spent in a Berber village lost on the borders of my country.<br />       Morocco is really remains a country apart for its hospitality because in any house and in the most distant of the villages, isolated or even lost in a place that seems at the end of the world, you would even find in families, especially Berber, say also Amazighs, the most modest if not the poorest, a guest room, commonly called the hospitality room.<br />You would then always be greeted with wide open arms accompanied by a smile that is admittedly shy at first but fundamentally honest and you will be treated like a prince or a precious princess that the whole village will hasten to invite and offer you the dishes. More delicious, more traditional and richest even if these families would have to sacrifice their only lamb, goat or chicken.<br />       I am nevertheless Moroccan but every time I find myself stuck in a small Berber village lost in the great or middle Moroccan Atlas, almost non-existent on official maps, I am always treated as a distinguished guest by families who seem to be on the threshold of Absolute poverty and despite my gene, I still feel a Love and a sense of immeasurable pride to be a child of Morocco; This legendary country for its hospitality and the undeniable authenticity of its people so warm.",My Home,2020-08-21T21:47:25Z,0

There&#39;s difference, read some history please before speaking anything!<br />And you don&#39;t look Muslim to me, your photo tells otherwise! I know that a true Muslim covers her body and her head,thats what they are told, and those who don&#39;t go straight to hell!

"​@Soumia إيزيس as an arab moroccan i respect amazigh and love them so much since i have friends and even some members of my family who are amazigh, but sorry you do not look like them through this comments, you seem so hateful subhanalah. Just for you to know, before the arab conquest of north africa in general and morocco especially, amazigh used to praise and worship idols, islam added sense to their life and made it more meaningful. And about that prophet, just to let you know, he was the most humble, hospitable person the universe has ever known, he taught us this and yes, we do it to for the sake of ALLAH, we do it also because it comes from our heart and ALLAH is more pleased when it&#39;s from the heart. Change your assumptions dear lady, try to read more and know more about islam and what is it about, look for trustworthy sources to not get blinded by the haters of this peaceful religion. indeed, this was not an offense, i just wanted to clarify this idea you have. and finally, i want to emphasize about the love i have for amazigh people, as moroccans we shouldn&#39;t let the variety of our ethnicities lead us to conflict, in the end we are all moroccans.",Fatima Zahra Taly,2020-09-29T15:01:55Z,0
"@Miyara sweet love, he is your prophet not my prophet, I&#39;m not Muslim, and there are some people who follow other religions where your prophet doesn&#39;t exist in it.<br />Imagine some religion claims that their God is your savior, would you buy that? Sure not, so best advice live your imagination only between you and your community.",Soumia إيزيس,2020-09-09T06:23:22Z,0

"All Moroccans and the neighbooring countries are in fact Amazigh / berber people or at least a huge part of thier blood, a lot of them got Arabized but people who live in remote areas or villages like this family still preserve the true nature of the native people .<br />Thank you for this video <br />You are always welcome",Nimo Tafy,2020-08-20T13:38:05Z,58
"Lets_WrapItUp then why did Morocco make the Berber the official language and Algeria Libya Tunisia have done some good stuff too to give equal rights to berbers too the berbers also live in Egypt too and speak Siwi which is another  Berber language Siwi is the only Berber language indigenous to Egypt and is natively spoken further east than any other Berber variety of North Africa so Egypt is a Mix of Afro asiatic Berber Arab country is not a 100%Berber country and many people settled in Egypt starting from the period of ancient Egyptians but Egypt  is also a native land  of the Berber people and has had a Berber history in the past and was influenced by Berbers even if that is not the case today it’s the truth of the fact the berbers ( amazigh people) migrated to North Africa thousands of years ago before other invaders came so Berber history in North Africa is unique in every way but the rest of North Africa can definitely pass as being Berber or being influenced by Berber at some extent  I agree not all of North African is Berber especially Egypt but the rest can definitely pass as being Berber or influenced by Berber history at a great extent  and if you claim berbers have been arabized then who are they being arabized by today ? Arabs ? Are you saying the past Arab rulers of North Africa are still ruling North Africa today why would that be the case since the Arab empire collapsed centuries ago  are you saying the presidents of these countries are Arabs ? Even the Arabic that is spoken in North Africa is completely different to the Arabic spoken in the Middle East because the Northern African Arabic has its own dialect and Berber and Arabic are the official languages the Berber just because Arabic is one of the recognised languages does not mean the people that inhabit the land are Arabs there are places where french and English are official languages where the french and British had colonies but still that doesn’t make them french or British in anyway they are there own race and still have a different identity<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/kyBNJAs1HWc"">https://youtu.be/kyBNJAs1HWc</a><br />.",SuperYAS111,2020-10-02T04:36:44Z,0
"Akal ⴰⴱⴻⵔⴽⴰⵏ so why was they assimilated and who are the assimilators?  Are the assimilators Arabs ? Sure amazigh people have been discriminated and treated badly at some extent but it’s not like they have lost there identity now just because they are oppressed by a different group Morocco also made the Berber language the official language in the country just take a look at some of the places the Europeans ruled most of them don’t even speak there own language now and speak the language of there colonial masters who imposed the language on them<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/kyBNJAs1HWc"">https://youtu.be/kyBNJAs1HWc</a>",SuperYAS111,2020-10-02T04:31:42Z,0

"This reminds me of my grandads village back in Morocco (I would visit Morocco every summer). As a kid I used to find it boring as I grew up in England and was fortunate enough to live a &#39;normal&#39; European lifestyle with technology, games etc. As the years went on and I got older, I started to really appreciate the community and simplicity of life in that village. Such a great way to get away from the city in Morocco to which we would spend most our time when over there. Havent been in a few years now due to my studies but when I go back I will probably spend most of my time in the village rather than the city. This video really sparked the feelings that I have for my Grandads village, a special experience that none of my friends here in England can relate to and fortunately for me, my family who live in my grandads home will always welcome me and feed me even though they are less fortunate than me. The reason why we wouldn&#39;t just take in a random stranger into our homes in the western world is because we live in such a segregated and independent society structure that almost makes it that we compete with everyone instead of helping each other and that&#39;s where these poorer areas of the world excel. They have nothing but are happier than those who have everything. Strange world..",sam jim,2020-08-14T22:34:59Z,0

It is nice to see the latest stuff by you though it was filmed in winter but was new for us.

Whatever they have they offer you without any <a href=""http://hesitation.you/"">hesitation.You</a> seem to enjoy the interaction with these simple people without letting them feel that they are poor .

"Once again a great story. Khubz is common name for bread in Arab world. My personal experience is that villagers are community rural areas are hospitable to guests who come or visit them with a reference. They remain hospitable to guests till aggressive political agenda of outsiders make them hostile to outsiders (my feelings). Mountain people are hard working with their tough lives so are river island people who are on a constant fear that the river may scour away their home anytime in future. I had the privilege to stay in Pakistan controlled Kashmir mountains, I know their life style also. Running water is a scarce commodity in those mountain homes",Ferdaus Al Amin,2020-08-11T01:49:56Z,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=1m36s"">1:36</a> I think most Imazighen (plural of Amazigh, which means &quot;free man&quot;) would rather be referred to as such.  The term &quot;berber&quot; is derived from the derogatory &quot;barbarian&quot; and was given to the people of North Africa by the Romans. So thank you for referring to them as Imazighen for the rest of the video.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=7m09s"">7:09</a> Wow, I never heard of bread being made this way in Morocco! I&#39;ve never even seen a tandoor in Morocco. The only Amazigh style bread I know of is  &quot;aghroum tafernout&quot;, which is baked on hot pebbles in an oven <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41IxQzxkNug"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41IxQzxkNug</a><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=9m38s"">9:38</a> Hands can say a lot about a person. The rougher the hands the softer the soul. :)<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=10m46s"">10:46</a> Thank you for being so open minded towards other cultures even though their norms might seem very backwards compared to your own culture and not letting a different way of life prevent you from connecting to people on a human level.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=11m09s"">11:09</a> Having been in the Atlas region in wintertime myself I can confirm how cold it gets. The houses are optimized to stay cool during the hot summers and I still don&#39;t understand how these people do it. I&#39;m guessing the good food and plenty of physical activity and sunshine will have to something with it. My oreo-and-instant-noodles ass  was freezing off, that&#39;s for sure!<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=11m59s"">11:59</a> <a href=""https://forvo.com/word/%D9%82%D9%87%D9%88%D8%A9/"">https://forvo.com/word/%D9%82%D9%87%D9%88%D8%A9/</a><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=12m24s"">12:24</a> For those wondering that&#39;s cold pressed moroccan olive oil. Delicious in taste and will keep you going for a while before you&#39;re hungry again. Bread is the main staple and eaten with every meal. As you can see at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=17m47s"">17:47</a> meals sizes are not very big.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=15m00s"">15:00</a> Easy cowgirl, those were at least 3 Moroccan sips you still had there! ;)<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=16m05s"">16:05</a> In Morocco Tajine is served with bread. Couscous is a whole different dish.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=17m02s"">17:02</a> &quot;Ibaouen&quot; means broad bean or fava bean. Maybe he prounounces it &quot;ivaouen&quot; because he&#39;s missing most of his front teeth? :)<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPfAyh0612E&amp;t=18m12s"">18:12</a> As a travelling vegetarian myself I&#39;m wondering how you would approach this situation now? As someone with Moroccan roots myself I would feel very uncomfortable to do so myself. Knowing the culture, if someone opens their home for you and they feed, you accept graciously. Would you decline the food?<br /><br /><br />Thank you for this beautiful insight into this different way of life. <br />Good luck to you Eva!",grunwalski_,2020-08-10T16:50:36Z,47

"Jebel Irhoud (Moroccan Arabic: جبل إيغود‎, romanized: ǧabal īġūd pronounced [ʒbəl ˈiɣud] also Adrar Ighud, Berber: Adrar n Iɣud) is an archaeological site located just north of the locality known as Tlet Ighoud, about 50 km (30 mi) south-east of the city of Safi in Morocco. It is noted for the hominin fossils that have been found there since the site&#39;s discovery in 1960. Originally thought to be Neanderthals, the specimens have since been assigned to Homo sapiens and have been dated to roughly 300,000 years ago (286±32 ka for the Irhoud 3 mandible, 315±34 ka based on other fossils and the flint artefacts found nearby).<br />Link:<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Irhoud"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Irhoud</a>",ⵢⵓⴳ·ⵔⵜⵏ-Jugurtha-ⵣⵡⴰⵔ ⴼoⵔ pⴻⴰⵛⴻ,2020-08-21T20:26:19Z,1
"The term originates from the Greek: βάρβαρος (barbaros pl. βάρβαροι barbaroi). In Ancient Greece, the Greeks used the term towards those who did not speak Greek and follow classical Greek customs.[2] In Ancient Rome, the Romans used the term towards tribal non-Romans such as the Germanics, Celts, Gauls, Iberians, Thracians, Illyrians, Berbers, and Sarmatians. In the early modern period and sometimes later, the Byzantine Greeks used it for the Turks in a clearly pejorative manner.",ⵢⵓⴳ·ⵔⵜⵏ-Jugurtha-ⵣⵡⴰⵔ ⴼoⵔ pⴻⴰⵛⴻ,2020-08-21T20:16:06Z,1

It is currently used by Berber political and cultural activists and organizations in 10 African countries, namely: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Egypt and the Canary Islands.<br />The flag was inaugurated in Wadya, a town of Kabylia situated in Tizi Wezzu, a province of Algeria, by an elder Algerian Kabylian veteran, Youcef Medkour<br /><br />The flag is composed of blue, green, and yellow horizontal bands of the same height, and a Tifinagh letter yaz or aza.<br />ach colour corresponds to an aspect of Tamazgha, the territory inhabited by Berbers in North Africa:<br /><br />blue represents the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean;<br /><br />green represents nature and the green mountains;<br /><br />yellow represents the sands of the Sahara Desert.<br /><br />The Yaz (ⵣ) symbolizes the Amazigh motto : &quot;Free Man, Free Woman.

"Eva, again you prove you are the best travel-blogger on the planet. Your appreciation of all peoples is gorgeous, and should be a mandatory viewing lesson for people round the  globe. Sadly, I know far too many people in my Britain who fear people who do not look/speak like them. Yet, tragically, the situation is far worse in the USA.  As an academic, I am constantly battling the plague of narrow-mindedness. Yet, it is pushing a bolder uphill. The root of that condition is fear, and it is irrational. In fact, it&#39;s vicious! I can relate my travel experiences to the inflicted, even my superb story of traveling to Berlin from university in Nice, France to be part of the historical party in November of 1989. Yet, most react with surprise, shock and fear. All that, despite my telling them that the moment, though sad, was also filled with joy. Thus, sparked by your constant theme of appreciating all cultures, I shall endeavour to record a video lecture on humanity, and the importance of treasuring it greatly.  Cheers &amp; ta!",Kenneth Frawley,2020-08-09T21:11:40Z,0

"In 1993 we were given safe harbor in a small Berber village in the Mid Atlas mountains near Khenifra after experiencing a breakdown on one of the isolated mountain roads late at night. They fed us, gave us shelter and unbeknownst to us towed and fixed our vehicle. They refused any renumeration for their efforts. If anything were slightly offended by our persistence at offering them dinars for their trouble. We ended up giving their children some printed tee shirts. They were thrilled with the gifts.

"Jebel Irhoud (Moroccan Arabic: جبل إيغود‎, romanized: ǧabal īġūd pronounced [ʒbəl ˈiɣud] also Adrar Ighud, Berber: Adrar n Iɣud) is an archaeological site located just north of the locality known as Tlet Ighoud, about 50 km (30 mi) south-east of the city of Safi in Morocco. It is noted for the hominin fossils that have been found there since the site&#39;s discovery in 1960. Originally thought to be Neanderthals, the specimens have since been assigned to Homo sapiens and have been dated to roughly 300,000 years ago (286±32 ka for the Irhoud 3 mandible, 315±34 ka based on other fossils and the flint artefacts found nearby).<br />Link:<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Irhoud"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Irhoud</a>",ⵢⵓⴳ·ⵔⵜⵏ-Jugurtha-ⵣⵡⴰⵔ ⴼoⵔ pⴻⴰⵛⴻ,2020-08-21T20:26:08Z,0

She is remembered and honored in the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, albeit on different feast days, for her outstanding Christian virtues, particularly the suffering caused by her husband&#39;s adultery, and her prayerful life dedicated to the reformation of her son, who wrote extensively of her pious acts and life with her in his Confessions.

His writings influenced the development of Western philosophy and Western Christianity, and he is viewed as one of the most important Church Fathers of the Latin Church in the Patristic Period.

"Second Punic War<br /><br />The Second Punic War (spring 218 – 201 BC),[3][4] also referred to as The Hannibalic War and by the Romans the War Against Hannibal, was the second of three Punic Wars between the Roman Republic and Carthage, with the participation of Macedonia and Syracuse polities and Numidian and Iberian forces on both sides. It was one of the deadliest human conflicts of ancient times. Fought across the entire Western Mediterranean region for 17 years and regarded by Livy as the greatest war in history, it was waged with unparalleled resources, skill, and hatred.[5]:21.1 It saw hundreds of thousands killed, some of the most lethal battles in military history, the destruction of cities, and massacres and enslavements of civilian populations and prisoners of war by both sides.<br />Link:<a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Punic_War"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Punic_War</a><br />The Numidian cavalry&#39;s horses, ancestors of the Berber horse, were small compared to other horses of the era, and were well adapted for faster movement over long distances.[2] Numidian horsemen rode without saddles or bridles, controlling their mounts with a simple rope around their horse&#39;s neck and a small riding stick. They had no form of bodily protection except for a round leather shield or a leopard skin, and their main weapon were javelins in addition to a short sword.[3]<br />Due to their expert horsemanship and agility, as well as their lack of armor or heavy weaponry, they were most suitable for harassing tactics, charging in loose formation and lobbing their javelins before wheeling off to escape the enemy&#39;s counterattack. This harassing tactic, while rarely decisive, could be extremely frustrating to a less mobile enemy, as experienced by Julius Caesar&#39;s soldiers during the latter&#39;s invasion of Africa. At the same time they were generally unable to stand their ground against heavier types of cavalry. In one incident during the aforementioned African invasion thirty of Caesar&#39;s Gallic horsemen drove off a much larger force of Moorish cavalry, while in another a squadron of Caesar&#39;s heavy Iberian horsemen routed a large body of Labienus&#39;s Numidians, while his Gallic and Germanic horsemen stood their ground.<br />The Numidians were extremely useful during small wars, and their presence certainly contributed greatly to the effectiveness of Hannibal&#39;s reconnaissance and intelligence. Hannibal&#39;s invasion of Rome during the Second Punic War is best known for his use of slow-moving war elephants, but he also employed Numidian cavalry where faster movement was needed, such as luring the Romans into a trap at the Battle of Trebia[4] and for fighting on his right flank.<br />Numidian cavalry were widely known and not only fought in the Carthaginian army, but in other armies of the time as well – the Romans even employed Numidian cavalry against Hannibal&#39;s own in the battle of Zama,[5] where the &quot;Numidian Cavalry turned the scales&quot;.[6]<br />For centuries thereafter, the Roman army employed Numidian light cavalry in separate units (equites Numidarum or Maurorum).<br /><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidian_cavalry"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidian_cavalry</a>",ⵢⵓⴳ·ⵔⵜⵏ-Jugurtha-ⵣⵡⴰⵔ ⴼoⵔ pⴻⴰⵛⴻ,2020-08-21T19:58:03Z,0

"@Eva zu Beck <br />Thank you so much. I admire that you are not afraid of learning othere cultures nomatter where you are in the world. Thats says a lot of you and that you enjoy life as it is. Most if the people are only focused on having more and more and showing wat they have. You&#39;re smile is showing that you anjoy life and that&#39;s making you a very rich lady🤑🤑. Joy and health are the most precious in this world and not mony. 😌<br /><br />When I was born in the High Atlas moutants of Morocco in 1985 there was much less than today. My mother told me that I was very sick the first month of my life. My father was already in the Netherlands so that he could save mony for us. Everybody in the small village was crying because the thougt that I was gonna die. And one day a olderly woman came to our village end asked my aunt why she was crying? She told her about me and asked my aunt to bring her to my mother who was day and night with me. She told my mother to trust here and wat to do. She cleaned my throat with oil and a feather of a bird and wrapped my in a lot of blankeds. She also told my mother to heat up the room a lot. And wonderfully since that day every day I got better and better after being sick for over a month. She saved my life like a doctor would do. When I was 12 I was in the village in Morocco and my mother told me, do you know this lady? Ofcourse I din&#39;t and she told me that she saved my life. <br /><br />The reaseaon I&#39;m telling you this is to let you understand how simpel life is over there. People are greatfull with wat they have. And don&#39;t think that they are not happy because they have not what we have in Europe or in the west. We are known as berbers but actually we are Amazigh, what means free people. And that is precise what they have. Freedom to live as they want, food and a verry simpel live.  As you know even they haven&#39;t a lot. They will always share everthing they have and even more nomatter who you are. That&#39;s the real life🙂🙃.<br /><br />May god bless you with what you have.<br /><br />Greetings from the Netherlands.",NBL,2020-08-09T21:00:03Z,0

Off grid so probably not much highly processed foods in this village yet this older woman making bread is obese. Bread-based cultures are not very healthy. See the ancient Egyptians where bread was revered and more than 50% of examined mummies had heart disease and other diet related diseases.,Carl Keller,2020-08-09T18:36:38Z,2
@weirdforces I&#39;m always looking for evidence of what makes humans healthy and unhealthy. This setting is perfect since it eliminates the majority of variables that we in civilization assume are causing us our health problems. The parallels to ancient Egypt are there whether I point them out or not and hopefully someone learns that bread isn&#39;t something to depend on if you value your health.,Carl Keller,2020-08-09T20:44:58Z,0

"Exactly my experience. I lived with a Berber family for 6 weeks, about 8 yrs ago and I still think about those days and nights. It&#39;s a really hard life and they had nothing but the kindness they showed me was indescribable. One of the most memorable, special experiences of my life. We put water on the roof to heat up (by the sun) and slept in those heavy blankets with no electricity. And the stars at night...wow! It made me very grateful for what I have and the best part was being able to help them and others (I lived there for 2 yrs). It&#39;s desperately difficult for them now with no tourists or work and Covid. Everything you said here Eva is so true...loved watching this it brought all those memories back.Yours is  my favourite YouTube channel, kudos to you for your bravery, adventurous and positive spirit and taking us to all these incredible places...",DESERT BLUES PLAYLIST,2020-08-09T17:09:12Z,168

"Seanus32 I remember being so shocked back then when I heard about it, I’m pretty sure the people who did it are rotting in jail right now. Tbh personally, as a woman myself I never go to remote areas alone especially because sometimes there could be no network and calling for help would seem to be impossible. In this case, I think Eva was safe because she stayed with a local family and not alone.",H J,2020-08-09T19:47:25Z,2
