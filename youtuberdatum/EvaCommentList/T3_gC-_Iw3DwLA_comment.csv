"Did you wait two weeks after taking that Covid19 test prior to visiting very closely with all those children? Travelling during a pandemic is tricky. You are literally carrying bugs and germs with you community to community... I ask because I enjoy your style of travel vlogging with more of a purpose. But I do not want to invest in watching a channel that talks about responsible and thoughtful travel but is really just another example of the long arm of privilege and colonialism. (Which would actually make a good episode. The anthropology of travel vlogging. Both pros and cons as they relate to the people whose lands you traverse.) Anyway, not trying to judge just get some more info to know where you stand. Thanks",Tanner Phillips,2021-04-07T13:41:26Z,0

"This video came up on my suggested watches and I was surprised, that people are still traveling.  I noticed a few travel vloggers still posting at this time.  Whilst I enjoy travel and watching travel videos by independent vloggers, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s responsible travel at his time.  It encourages others to travel outside their local area and potentially spread the virus.  Let&#39;s follow the star trek motto &#39;the needs of the many, outweigh the needs of the few&#39;.  Keep to your area and only make essential travel.",Barry J,2021-04-03T09:01:50Z,1

"I do agree with you that travel vloggers have responsibilities. I have unsubscribed two youtube travel channels at the beginning of this year because I can&#39;t see people traveling irresponsibly, especially after people I know passed away because of the pandemic. Whenever I saw the vloggers traveling without any concerns(no testings or masks) I feel that&#39;s irresponsible. They have thousands of followers and what kind of influence would they bring to the others? I like your videos and I like that you respect the local guidelines with the corona testings.

"So many people do check box travel. They just want to see the Eiffel Tower, Montmartre, the Colosseum,  and tick their boxes off of things to do, take a few selfies , and move on. I have done both styles of traveling - slow versus marching to the beat. I&#39;ve woken up at 5am in the morning to drag my weary body out of the bed, still suffering form jet lag, so that I can rush into a jam packed tour bus to see all the tourist attractions. I&#39;ve traveled completely aimlessly, ending up in a random antique store in Amsterdam, examining a microscope from the 1500&#39;s. I must say, those who are traveling to check off all the boxes and maximizing efficiency are completely missing the point of traveling. Such people should really stick with Google images and Wikipedia to get their efficiency in.<br /><br />I, for one, welcome the spread of slow travel.",WRC,2021-03-17T05:15:50Z,0

Some people do rings,, some like to pierce.. Some even modify their appearance in ways unimaginable..

"Eva, you said along with the video you were looking for inspiration; but girl, you are the inspiration for most of us, at least for this travel couple who is starting its way out in the world. We found your channel quite recent, but since that day we take an eye more often at your content. This particular video is very kind and so inspiring (again, the inspiration) because we want to travel not showing just beautiful and popular places. We want to tell our story through the stories of our hosts, the friend we make in the path, the people (&amp; places) we don&#39;t know at all but have something to say to others and we, with that responsibility you talked about, can share and expand their voices. thank you for sharing and for being so open with your audience in this way. You are a perfect role model for this couple. üôåüèª",Listo Vamos,2021-03-12T05:45:40Z,0

"I really like what you are doing and that&#39;s why I have to be a little critical now ... you&#39;ve reached a level where you think you have to do more and sure, is understandable ... but if you do something different from what you really are not, your spirit of adventure that makes us follow you will be lost. Maybe I am an old-fashioned, but I think you are already on the wrong path, an example, that stupid tattoo ... for me you fell from the heaven on earth.<br />You don&#39;t have to take my opinion into consideration ... of course you can change your vision, but this has to be done subtly by taking more responsibility in educating of the travel enthusiasts and earth environment protection ... so you don&#39;t have to do anything sophisticated, just be you, it&#39;s what I (we) like, you have to be real you, a unique character.",etctai,2021-03-11T21:22:20Z,0

"Thanks for your continuing efforts to improve your use of the platform you have built for yourself. Your thoughtfulness and compassion are the most compelling elements of what you do. Pursuing the implications of that fundament, when the impulse of so many people is and would be not to break a successful formula, puts you and your channel into a tiny category of exceptional creators of vlog stories.<br /><br />Whole discipline and habit support any extended project and our lives in multiple ways, it&#39;s important to leave room to grow in the ways, for example, you discuss in this video.<br /><br />Not less importantly, you must listen to your body telling you in many ways, depending on the circumstances, when rest and healing become necessary. Those ways may include signs much less obvious than hypersensitivity to a nasty set of bedbug bites and the inflammation that follows. The signs must be heeded, sometimes even when they&#39;re subtle. Mind your body and mind. We all have limits, and those limits can surprise us - especially when we do not listen well to our bodies.<br /><br />That said, please do bring the mindfulness - to your video windows on the world and to your personal life.<br /><br />Thank you for the care you show to the people your meet and the places you visit.<br /><br />Thank you as well for sharing your work. You make it possible for those of us dealing with issues - in my case, long-term illness (I hope longer-term illness, since there appears to be no good way out) - that keep us from continuing or even beginning our own journeys to experience our still-beautiful world.<br /><br />Congratulations, finally, on freeing your diet from the gustatory ball and chain of animal butchery. You give your meals freedom and space to explore the world of food beyond dead relatives and so-called side dishes. The not-murdered animals thank you, the world thanks you, and I welcome you.<br /><br />Be well.",bitegoatie,2021-03-10T06:49:05Z,0

its funny that people know they must have a cause are good works in there life and they struggle to to do so the problem is there heart is evil and they are anger and they have selfish secret sins Destory them while they work and work to find purpose. it is when Jesus convinces you your broken and have done noting of value in your life and you life is full of you scratch my back and I will scratch yours not truly helping people! and all your causes are wrong causes that God is not worried about  your causes you are   soppose to care about but probably don&#39;t really! Jesus will show you are a sinner and he is not happy with you and your greatest need is forgiveness before you can move forward with his cause! it is not HUMAN causes that God has it is HIS cause (its not an earthly cause) that is first and you will serve him or your cause which has  nothing of value even if it looks to have value to you!,hey i have something to say,2021-03-08T18:33:20Z,0

In India they are vegetarians and love cow as sacred yet hate and killing of minorities on food of their choice in 21th century needs no introduction. PEACEFUL Buddhist of Burma killed more then  500 thousands Rohingya&#39;s minorities and force 1 millions  out of country to border of Bangladesh in  camps so all this earth and animal lovers showing mercilessness towards other human beings is open.

"Thanks for your video Eva! Everyone&#39;s perspective changes with their life experiences, you have a great way of telling stories and love watching them, if you feel a responsiblity and want to do more indepth things then that&#39;s absolutely fine, I know people have criticised you in the past and I expect that&#39;s hard to take for someone who&#39;s clearly very considerate and mindful. I would also say (purely my opinion) that whilst that&#39;s very admirable, I think it&#39;s absolutely fine to do videos of your own experience - simply documenting your experiences and what happened without putting it in a necessarily &quot;balanced wider context&quot; often the most interesting and thought provoking stories and experiences are those that come from what would probably be an atypical experience in a wider context and attempts to produce &quot;balance&quot; by telling both sides of a story can lead to things being extremely unblanced when that in itself is not representitive. Whatever you decide to do though I think you&#39;ll do a great job, good luck!",Tom Riley,2021-03-03T12:27:15Z,0

"Interesting but weird reasons to go vegetarian I think, especially the bit about &quot;the environment suffers because of animal agriculture&quot;..... someone could easily point out that your way of living by traveling a lot is also harming the environment by a lot, just as posting videos on internet, those millions of views are run by gigantic server rooms who waste a ton of energy just so people are able to watch you videos.... so yeah at least offer us the &quot;full experience&quot; going in some remote places while being vegetarian cuts you from a lot of traditional good products (like in Romania and the Balkans especially) for an environmental impact that is unsignificant (at least compared to your total carbon footprint) and a &quot;animal well being&quot; point that is highly debatable (the animal who have been living in the Romanian hills you&#39;ve been to had probably their best life)...<br /><br />So yeah, ultimately it&#39;s your own choice indeed, but it feels like a &quot;social media/trend&quot; choice, meant to vertue signaling to other people rather than having well pointed reasons....

"Your work is good and you have obviously captured the imagination of many; you go to great places, but your ideas are trite, and your approach to the locals is very romanticised. I know a lot of people will find this idea weird, but please hear me out:<br /><br />As a Middle-Eastern person, I have been told constantly that my culture is great and exotic. It isn&#39;t. It is only that to a Westerner. My culture contains a lot of horrible things, complexities and ambiguity, and I do not appreciate Westerners coming over to where my ancestors from to showcase smiley faces and colourful aesthetics as if that is all we are.<br /><br />I mean, continue doing what you are doing. But this is just my two cents.","Actually, Movies",2021-02-28T10:10:01Z,1

Concerning your travel vlogs: I never saw them as simple vlogs. You showed me places in europe, and the middle east that changed my way of seeing those countries and their inhabitants. At the end, we as viewers have to draw our own conclusions. And I guess travel vlogging will have its ups and downs like everything in life. People just tend to believe that a happy life is just all ups and no downs. Such life does not exist.

"Um, yes it does. It promotes monoculture which decreases diversity in both plant life and animal life, which then requires extensive farming machinery to harvest which uses large amounts of fossil fuels. Huge amounts of water are required to sustain beef cattle, and food that could otherwise be used for human consumption is fed to them. The food to meat ratio means that more energy is needed to produce meat from a cow or pig than is needed to harvest the crops they eat and just eat them instead. Sustainable agriculture is the way forwards. And I‚Äôm an environmental science student so I know what I‚Äôm talking about, this is science not ‚Äòwoke‚Äô.",Rosie Holgate,2021-03-03T22:23:51Z,5

Instead of cutting meat out of your diet all together you should hunt your own instead of buying it from the store so you have more of a connection with your food.

"I used to watch travel vloggers (usually white western n european) made negative comments on foreign culture just because it doesnt meet their views. This is really irritating coz it portrays the holier-than-thou or sort of like white supremacy kinda thing.. well different people in different parts of the world have lived in harmony under their rules and regulation. Travel vlogger cant just bulldoze through the villages and critic ppls way of lives. For example, theres one couple which has shown disgust towards their hosts in morrocco just coz they see the women worked more than men at home... And critisizing the town and its curfew laws while they were stuck in lockdown just coz it didnt have the luxuries like bars, booze and party like what they enjoy.<br />I hope, even if you want to be a responsible &quot;eye opener&quot; kinda vlogger, do think deeply before critisizing other ppls culture which is not to be explained thru one visit and a few bad experience.<br />I kinda love the way youre vlogging now. I really respect the ones u did in pakistan, showing the real modern life, and moving away from the stereotype &quot;islamic terrorist&quot; view.. that was fun to watch.",Stereo Soloist,2021-02-27T16:12:49Z,0

"Hi Eva you probably won&#39;t recall but I emailed you about 2 years ago and made several suggestions on how your vloggs should evolve at your personal email address via Polish Travel organisation which chime with what you have just said.  Sadly you didn&#39;t reply lol. I personally believe you have a spirit and a drive and a consciousness which connects with people viscerally.  You care about the world, humanity so my advice if you seek change is to use your considerable  appeal and talent and spirit and enter main stream media and influence the way we think about travel that way, infusing tolerance and respect of other <a href=""http://cultures.you/"">cultures.You</a> have the personality and drive and hopefully if you ever dig out my email I would be happy to reply, if you don&#39;t my advice again is to make a  relevant change you must go mainstream you have the experience , you can tell a story, you need to address the real issues and injustices of the regions you visit as well as travel.  Good luck , a true admirer of you and your desire to reach out and evolve. Safe journeys and safe returns.",Mercury Rising,2021-02-27T16:10:44Z,0

"Not sure if you knew but the dairy and egg industry are the meat industry. Every dairy cow and every egg laying hen is sent to the slaughter house after they&#39;ve been enslaved for their milk and eggs, and they also suffer immensely, specially cows that get forcibly impregnated, then they have their calf taken from them, and if it&#39;s a male calf, it will be killed often times within a couple of days of life, if it&#39;s a female it will be enslaved like her mother and forcibly impregnated every year for that milk that you are not suppose to consume, but was meant for her calf, and at the end she will be killed as well. Eggs laying hens are just the same they are mutilated, male chicks are put in a blender when they are born, or suffocated at birth. Then they cut a part of their beaks to they don&#39;t peck each other out and kill others. They are also enslaved for a couple of years until they are spent and sent to the slaughter house. Free range and backyard hens pretty much all suffer the same brutal end as well. Go plant based as animal agriculture is the main driver of deforestation world wide and is the leading driver for creating pandemics.",Christian Williams,2021-02-27T15:40:31Z,0

"To begin with, I think it is one of the most fun, interesting and spontaneous videos you have made, especially for those beautiful children who have accompanied you during the recording. I think the change you propose is very positive, however I think that style you have been implementing little by little for a long time. I don&#39;t like some of your videos, but many of them I recommend. Because of my age I think it could be your father - even your grandfather, and I really enjoy not only your travel videos, but your reflections, your teachings and your spirit - which is reflected in many attitudes and actions, such as running marathons. To some of my students (I have been a teacher for several decades) I recommend your videos for their emotional content, for the strength and spirit that you show in them, so I will be looking forward to your new videos.

"@Pedro cardozo Hi Pedro. Many creative people consume MJ. In fact many also use it as medical treatment for bona fide medical conditions including chronic pain. if your comment refers to temporary periods of lack of motivation following MJ consumption, then I see your comment as cute and it indicates the positive aspect that you are listening and thinking about what Eva is saying. But if your comment is a criticism of any aspect of her presentations, then I need to express some disagreement. While nobody is perfect I consider Eva&#39;s presentations to contain stylistic levity and some truly sophisticated content including deep dives into cultural and geographic features of some truly unexpected locations. if like me, you value this type of travel vlogging you might also check out the youtube channel belonging to Drew Binsky.",Greg Cosma,2021-03-02T04:49:54Z,0

"@Bush Treks it&#39;s complete nonsense, animal fat does not clog arteries, atherosclerosis and heart disease are caused by incorrect food combinations, biochemistry bows, vegetables and seeds turn into sugar and later fat in the body, meat turns into muscles and fat into brain and nerve cells, that&#39;s why your brain is made up of cholesterol !!!",tessa,2021-02-28T11:38:01Z,2
