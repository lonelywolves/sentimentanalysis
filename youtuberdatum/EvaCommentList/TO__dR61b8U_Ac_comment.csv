"A couple of years ago I decided to volunteer to help refugees to build a new life in my country, the Netherlands. Most of them came from Syria and I definitely fell in love with the people, their food and culture. Having seen so much photos, videos and heard stories I would love to visit Syria in person one day ♥️ Thank you Eva for making a videos like these to show people Syria is so much more then a war torn country the media makes it to be.",Livelifelaugh,2021-04-27T21:20:14Z,0

"What a lovely video😍 of the Paris of the East مدینة الشام باریس الشرق Syrians are not Arabs but Arabised Phoenicians, Arameans/Assyrians and Armenians. Before Arabisation and before Christ, Syria used to be part of Phoenicia. Phoenician and later Syriac-Aramaic (Suryoyo) and Greek were spoken here when it became part of the Byzantine Empire. Jews and Eastern Orthodox Christians lived here. No Arabs, no Arabic, no Islam here until 634 AD. During the last years of the Ottoman Empire in 1915-16 Armenians (not to be confused with Arameans/Assyrians) were sent into exile towards the Syrian North from Southeast, East and South Anatolia (modern Turkey). Many people identify as Arab (because of pan-Arab nationalism and they speak Arabic),  only are partially of Arab-Hejazi descent.The entire Levant: Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and even Iraq and Northern Africa is not Arab in origin. These nations have all been Arabised. In essence they come from ancient non-Arab civilisations such as Phoenicia, Mesopotamia, Canaan and Amazigh (Berber civilisations).",Cookie,2021-04-20T12:05:50Z,0

Don’t let the news media twist it. Most of us Americans hate what our government is doing to other countries. If we speak we are taken out or banned from social media. We no longer have the same freedoms and the people see our government as a war machine. <br /><br />We need Jesus to return without him it is only going to get worse.,Nicholas Besner,2021-04-26T12:03:56Z,0

simply because people who lived there never left Syria to be refugees. These areas of Damascus were safe during the crisis while poor areas at the perimeter of Damascus were unsafe and suffered a lot of destruction,al Dallika,2021-04-12T00:10:46Z,0

"After your recent video talking about how you want to tell the complicated stories of people living in the places you visit, and not to tell it like a journalist, I find that your older videos are much better. I say this because instead of delving into the story of the Taliban a bit more and just passing them off as a terrorist organisation you&#39;re just doing what the journalists themselves do. If you were to go back to Syria would you be claiming Asad is also a terrorist before entering or whilst there? I highly doubt it. I really love your older videos which just shows life in the countries you visit and it&#39;s people as well as your adventures whilst there. I feel this is much more positive way of vlogging.

Next time you come, you should definitely have a look at Semiramis pastry shop, or the Bab Touma&#39;s neighborhood. As a French-Syrian national, I remember I had to fast before going to Damascus every summers just to make sure I would still fit in my clothes when back in Europe.

It was an ideological video to show Syria as a country of mosques and Islamic ... in line with the policy ... (uniform dress) ... you showed my country in a way similar to your documents about Iran or Iraq ... even though you know that it is radically different ...

"Being objective is arduous these days. Just around you ( five to ten kilometers), you will find the razed buildings and some elderly people living there. U won&#39;t see so many young people. Guess why! U know that, don&#39;t you?  Syria is impressive and gorgeous, but there are lots of people who are in jails, got killed, or got expelled out of their homes. Why cannot you say that? Why only the good side? I cannot go to the beach and see someone who is dying beside it and say: Well, this beach is amazing. I cannot just turn a blind eye to the person who is dying. For this reason, I cannot understand what you are trying to say. This is awful and not human. I think this helps the regime kills another one million people. A Lamborghini cannot make a dead person happy. So it is your video with the nice places. I can smell the blood that got shed by the regime. Your perfume makes it stinks. I said these words to awake the human that lives inside you. U are a foreigner, so, please make sure what kind of message you make. I wish you happiness   and hope that you never have to live as many SYRIANS live and lived.",abdullrhman alasaad,2021-02-19T23:38:46Z,0

However, let&#39;s keep it 💯 for a minute and just say— when you are as insanely beautiful as this woman is, it doesn&#39;t matter what country you are visiting (especially when you&#39;re alone), you&#39;re going to be seen as an angel to most people and often will be given special treatment or privilege that an average person (i.e. non female &amp; average looking) would ever hope to have.<br /><br />Props to her, she&#39;s hot af and has a great personality, those two things are exactly what you need to become a rising star in the world of youtube travel channels. Hers is one of the better ones because aside from the standard video tour of the places she goes, she is constantly trying to keep you engaged by educating viewers on the history and the unique cultures of that area. The channel &#39;Bald and Bankrupt&#39; is a great example of this, except he&#39;s a dude, but he&#39;s also a very talented and entertaining vlogger who never goes anywhere touristy always giving you the real truth of the places he goes...good or bad.",Jesse,2021-01-06T09:21:33Z,0

"Woderful place, I just hope that they manage to finish the conflict and stitch the deep wounds of the civil (international) war (it started in 2011, unbelievable), with whole cities like Alepo destroyed and almost 6 million people in exile. As a Spaniard, a country whose civil war had about 1 million deaths and half a million refugees in exile, with 40 years of Franco&#39;s dictatorship afterwards, I cannot imagine how difficult it must be for the Syrians with the horrible numbers of their war and all the personal tragedies they hide, also with all the vicious interests of foreign powers around, and the difficult years they have ahead...

"As a girl living in Damascus:<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dR61b8U_Ac&amp;t=3m08s"">3:08</a> made me laugh because that&#39;s exactly how everyone reacts when someone has a camera and is talking. Especially if you&#39;re speaking english. Yes I&#39;ve recorded before and people saw me speaking english in that exact area-<br /><br />I wanna know where that Karaoke place is in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dR61b8U_Ac&amp;t=3m36s"">3:36</a> so I can go with my friends.<br /><br />That ice cream shop Bakdash, that cafe Nofera (Where she heaed the storyteller), that main shop, etc are all areas I really enjoy visiting. If you would like to visit Syria visit Old Damascus. It shows all the culture and other things that everyone should view.<br /><br />I&#39;d also like to say that I&#39;ve lived in Damascus, Syria my entire life, and I&#39;ve enjoyed every bit. Sure, it may seem sad and devoid of hope sometimes but in reality you make the hope. I&#39;ve made my own happiness here, and I&#39;ll never not be proud of being Syrian.",talia,2020-09-12T13:06:17Z,16

"Everytime I visit my Grandparents, I look at all their photoalbums. Around 4 years ago, I found their Album of their visit in Syria in the 70s. They had endless stories of the love and warmth from strangers and about the beauty in Damascus. It was the first time seeing a different picture than just war. I came to tears thinking how this magical place is mostly destroyed. Around that same time I have made a friend from Syria who fleed to Germany. One of the smartest, open minded and self-reflected persons I have ever met. Shortly after my mom rented a room to someone from Syria, who became a very close family friend. This video brought me to tears and gave me hope. May there come peace to you beautiful people. I dream of visiting Syria one day.",Mural 030,2020-09-01T22:04:23Z,43

"i was born in syria and came to us when i was 8 or 9 with my mom as my parents were separating and my grandma already lived in us.  ive been here my whole life in us and as i grew up, ive always became curious about where i came from.  i grew up watching horrid news about us Syrians all the time but i know not are true. i hope one day i will be able to go as a us citizen to my country of birth, and not have problems on both ends, us and syria and go back and forth freely regularly as i please.  i dont remember too much of syria as i came so young, but grew up in a syrian house a lot of my life so i know the culture.  i wish to experience that one day and see it for myself in real life.  thank you for showing me the aleppo video also, that&#39;s where my grandma was born :) much love, you&#39;re awesome so much :DDDD.

"While the video is interesting, it is absolute propaganda. The reality is that 80% of Syrians live in poverty and there has been grinding oppression against the Sunni Muslim Syrian people. The government oppresses religious institutions, freedom of speech, and anyone who dare speak out against them. The Alawite minority created an unholy alliance with Christians to oppress others by providing only government positions and sensitive military offices to family members. Syria is a nation that is run by a police state and to show the people in Damascus as being just lovely is completely lazy and untruthful. I wish this white Europe woman would have showed the consistent power outages, the lack of water, how much things cost, and all of the things that make living in this horrible place a complete hell.",Al,2020-07-14T06:23:54Z,1

"I have to say thank you! Thank you for sharing with us your travels to parts of the world most wouldn&#39;t even consider visiting. Thank you for helping people change their perceptions of places and peoples that are often vilified or shown in an otherwise negative light. I have always tried to challenge my understandings or beliefs of a place or a people, understanding that often times those beliefs are shaped by only one side of the story. For that, I have always wanted to travel more in the Middle East. As a Jew, I&#39;ve been raised to believe that this is a region that would not welcome me, that hates me without even knowing me just because I&#39;m Jewish (and I&#39;m not even religious!). But watching your various vlogs and seeing the natural and human beauty that abounds emphasizes what I&#39;ve always suspected, in that there is more good than bad, and more friend than enemy. Thank you for challenging my perception! I&#39;ve had to subscribe because I am absolutely glued!",monkmonk438,2020-07-12T06:42:06Z,0
"This is the dumbest thing to watch. We are stuck at work being paid crumbs by our employers, meanwhile the only escape we get is to watch people who have no clue what real work is in life, and who get to do this for a living.  Stop supporting this behavior. Stop watching this channel. Ultimately it just ends up ruining the world even further... We don&#39;t need bloggers who are globetrotting the earth on our dimes, we really don&#39;t. We have a serious issue with global warming, this job is in direct conflict with that.<br />The world is upside down when this is your life, and all of us watch wishing we were you, secretly pissed off at the system that is holding us all back... What kind of rich family did you come from? What kind of bullshit allows for SOME people to travel all their lives, for fun and entertainment, and the rest of us have grueling 9-5 jobs. Enjoy taking planes and ruining the atmosphere so you can make your blog videos, meanwhile the people who actually deserve a trip will maybe only get a handful in their lifetimes. I hope you feel it is worth it..<br />Ive been watching travel videos my whole life, and i realise i&#39;ve been working hard to succeed so eventually i can travel myself... all i have really succeeded in doing is making myself sick with stress trying to reach a point of financial stability at the age of 30... this isnt working. Sure i have a house now, and i&#39;m happy for that, but it took more then 20 years of schooling and cost me my health. Now im stuck with a mortgage to pay, renovations to do, and more years ahead of me without travelling. I havn&#39;t travelled since 2001, thats over 18 years because I CANT AFFORD IT...   I deserve a damn trip too.<br />Finally, i realize living and toiling for the elite is simply not worth it anymore. There is no control over bread and water, and greenhouse gases. If you continue to live and do what your doing, you will inevitably cause the destruction of planet earth. I hope your job makes you happy, because all it is is cancer to me.",Max Hanna,2020-07-11T22:43:15Z,0

"Since the conflict came to an end recently.. and seeing these videos for those who have traveled to Syria and met and chatted with so many who live there, its really helped me change the minds of more conservative people here in America. During the conflict we took in many refugees and the conservative population&#39;s response was always negative, sadly. The message many of the Far right and conservative side here was &quot;don&#39;t let them come here&quot; or &quot;they are monsters.&quot;   I am happy to say I have never met one bad Syria person. Its Vloggers like Eva as well as Drew Binsky that show how people really are. This video and Drew Binsky&#39;s videos are what I show many of my conservative friends or those I know, to let them see how nice people are in your country, the diversity and unity of faiths in your country and hospitality in your culture.  Someone online once told me &quot; Oh ya? How about try going over THERE (Syria) and being Christian &quot;  So.. I instead posted a video of Christmas in Damascas for her to see.  I think it changed her perception.  Best wishes and better times, from the state of Texas in America.",Courts Griner Photography,2021-04-17T04:15:39Z,0

This is a conspiracy and we must all stand together to spread the truth. Many of my family suffered because of the war, but we will always support our president Assad in his fight for our country.

"Great documentary about a part of syria. We hear so many bad things but as the documentary show really well then people actual are able to live, work and even eat ice cream some places in Syria.<br />But i already knew that since my hairdressor was on vacation in syria month ago, but still people refuse to travel home and rebuild their country..<br />I think that is sad people quite often abuse the migration system when they can move to example another part such as damascus and continue life there.<br />By the way last year more than 100.000 syrians returend home from refugee camps near syria, many since they realized their dream of a new life in europe was no longer gona happen.<br />No i havent got anything about syrians and i do understand some had to flee.. But i do not have any sympaty for people who do not want to travel home and rebuild their home country.<br />Its a long debat wich youtube is not the right place to use.<br />But great to see everyday life in syria can be &quot;safe&quot; and possible and people trade and work, that is a good sign of better times that over time will spread to more places in syria.",Peed Sii,2020-07-03T19:42:49Z,0

"The title should really be: &quot;SYRIA | What&#39;s It Like to be a Foreign Assad Apologist [trying to get more tourists to enrich the worst regime on earth] in Damascus in 2019?&quot;. After turning Syrian prisons into human slaughterhouses, committing genocide on Syria&#39;s Sunni majority, destroying almost all of Syria&#39;s infrastructure, destroying Syria&#39;s economy and displacing half of the country&#39;s population with Russia, Iran and Hezbollah - YES INDEED, LET&#39;S SUPPORT Assad (who&#39;s broke) economically by sending more tourists, and reward him for what he did",Ayhan K.,2020-06-08T13:11:48Z,0

Muslim culture is different from western culture these mens did not gave you for free the icecream for nothing or just because they are generous its because they do there role of men also in many middle east country&#39;s  womens should never pay and they probably don&#39;t even understand why there is no men beside or near you to pay for you so they just give it to you for free cause they know a women should not pay there mentality and culture is way different than the western mentality but actually they are right its a natural behaviour deep inside the mans since many thousand of years mans were the one working to get the women they were working hard for the womens its just us western that messed it all up..  now we are lost and can not even play our role of men toward our women and the women want to do the role of mens so they just finish by divorcing cause they are both lost women natural behaviour its to wait after the mens to do the work for her now she work for him like a men would and the mens is lost during the process cause he doesn&#39;t do or can not do what he should do to make her women happy and men without mission has not the feeling of accomplishment a man always want to satisfy her women but now all the natural human behaviour are now messed up there is no stability in couple has everyone are lost ....,Jay Roy,2020-05-11T16:36:37Z,0

"Did you know that Damascus is the oldest inhabited capital in history and the world? Did you know that Damascus is the capital of the Levant: Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria. It is the richest city in the world with water. Did you know that before the war, Damascus was the only country that welcomed its brothers from all over the world without a visa and welcomed them with generosity and originality. Damascus, where Salah al-Din Ayyubi died. Damascus, which the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, called God&#39;s paradise on earth. The first murder in the world took place in Damascus, specifically in Jabal Arbaeen. Between the brothers of Cain and Abel, the children of our master Adam, peace be upon him. The word Damascus was divided into two words: 1 - blood and blinded blood. 2 incision and meaning incision. And its meaning is blood slit. Damascus was one of the world countries characterized by peace and love, but unfortunately, the war destroyed everything and crushed the past and memories<br />🇸🇾",Waleed Al hariri,2020-04-04T13:36:34Z,0

@sirasy <br />You are not a good person for many reasons:<br />1- you distort facts: most women in Europe and other continents used to wear hijab during the day whether they were working or not. They used to take it off only at bedtime<br />2- your are a dictator: people have the freedom to wear what they like especially if it is a common kind of cloths. You may complain about people wearing weird unaccepted cloths provided that the majority of people support your definition of the unaccepted cloths,al Dallika,2020-03-05T21:52:34Z,0
"@al Dallika in the past they used that when they cleaned in order to keep the hair clean! And then, that was &quot;the past&quot;! WHY should I see that merde in Europe now in 2020? You men should wear that! WHY should a woman show modesty? You men are so immensly arrogant! It&#39;s time for you to wear that! It&#39;s DISGUSTING!",sirasy,2020-03-05T21:09:41Z,0

No politics, just showing it for what it is. So refreshing to see. A friend of mine went through the Middle East in 2005. Said Iran was hands down the best and Syria a very close second. One of things that blew him away in both countries was the generosity of the people. I have a genuine soft spot for both countries and it is great to see them show off a positive light.. on a side note, love love love Culture Trip. It is good to know you had a hand in that.

In addition she said Syrian kiosks frequently refused to charge her for food, in solidarity with those who suffered 09/2001.

"I hate the right-wing extremists from my home country. They judge people they don&#39;t even know. They really scare people. Here in Austria, the citizens are told through the Kronen Zeitung that anyone coming from Syria could be a sympathizer for terror. Sometimes it&#39;s communicated subtly, sometimes directly. This is repeated day after day. It happens until people start to believe it. <br /><br />The company that produces Red Bull even runs a TV station here called ServusTV. <br />Right-wing extremists are openly invited there. <br /><br />I realize that a small country can do little and cannot fully address the global causes of flight. But I do not think it is correct how it is dealt with.<br /><br /><br />Stay strong, Syria!",V1detta,2020-01-23T01:18:24Z,1

"Dear miss Eva Zu Beck. Thank you for this lovely, wonderful Video. It&#39;s precious. And about the religions of the city&#39;s people, and why they are there, please allow me to add, as I am so touched by your journeys, the Muslims and Christians, together are expecting the re-arrival of Jesus, peace be upon him, there in Damascus (Dimask). As in Islaam, we believe in  the teachings of 124,000 apostles and prophets, since the beginning of time. And in Islaamic documents, from Hadeeths and Al Qur&#39;aan, Jesus (or Jeshua, his real name in Ibrani or Eesha Al Maseeh, peace be upon him, in Arabic), shall re-arrive in the area of Damascus. With two angels with him, from above, Heaven. Sent by Allah, the One God. <br /><br /><br />And he will spread peace, prosperity. Along with The Eemaam Al Mahdi, the supreme leader, from the roots of prophets and apostles. To all parts of the world.<br /><br /><br />And, as the war in Syria is happening, this is one of the signs, milestones. Along with the war in Palestine, Lebanon, &#39;Iraq, and Yaman. Of which, are happening, as we speak (the Lebanon is in truce). But sooner or later it will come to and end. For good.<br /><br /><br />Some of the signs, had not happened, yet. <br /><br /><br />But many of the signs, had. <br /><br /><br />Some, are, very obvious: tall buildings in Arab lands (now: in Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi, UEA, and so on), the spread of Islaam all over the world, the re-grouping of the Jews (the original Bani Israel or the non-original) in Palestine, the many corrupted governments in many lands, the change of climate from its normal standard, Music is everywhere, opressions toward honest people from traitors, and so on.<br /><br /><br />All of these signs, had been told to us, via Hadeeths and Al Qur&#39;aan. <br /><br /><br />Again, thank you for your lovely, wonderful videos. Hope to see you soon, again, een shaa Allah (God willing). :)",ATM - Abu Taqi Mayestino,2019-12-30T12:03:38Z,0

The mosque didn&#39;t exist back in the time of our prophet Muhammed(pbuh) and the region was under Christian control. But he prophesied:<br />Allah will send Maseeh ibne Maryam (Messiah son of Mary). Thus he will descend near the white eastern minaret of Damascus, clad in two yellow sheets, leaning on the shoulders of two angels.” [Sahih Muslim]",Lavender Lavender,2019-12-26T07:30:28Z,1

By that logic, looking at those videos, you&#39;d think sanctions against Iran have never existed, and Iran is the richest country in human history, and poverty has been eradicated in Tehran.  Of course, you might think that by watching a couple videos on YouTube for 10 minutes.  I&#39;m Iranian, and I know a thing or two about what&#39;s happening in Iran: a lot of despair and political oppression and also poverty.

From there? What do you mean by &quot;from there&quot;? From Damascus or from Syria? You don&#39;t seem to understand the whole situation. Most of Syria isn&#39;t safe and won&#39;t be as long as the US sponsors terrorists and fight proxy wars.

"Only those parts that are controlled by president Assad are safe and multicultural. US puppets in their areas cut peoples heads of and the famous White Helmets clean up the bodies and sell the parts afterwards. Those safe parts are constantly attacked by Israel and the US.

"Greetings from Germany. Syria is a strong country because of its strong people, who has suffered so much because of the war what has been brought to Syria from abroad. This week I saw the German Bundestag on TV and a politician from the AfD told about that a big part of Syria is liberated, in Latakia its possible to make holidays, and some AfD members of the AfD could convince themselves about it. Then the German foreign minister Heiko Maas from the SPD said in a disparaging sense that only those from the AfD are able to spend their holidays there. Syria isn&#39;t liberated at all and the country is in turmoil. After the politician from the AfD asked if Germany would help rebuilding Syria the foreign minister said that Germany certainly do not help now to strengthen Assad. In my view that speech from Heiko Maas clearly said that he is also infected with the &quot;Assad must go&quot; mantra created by the US, later adopted by their compliant helpers. The politicians in Germany regarding Syria rely on sources like the White Helmets or the SOHR, which in my eyes are some other things, but not credible. Regarding the White Helmets the politicians rely on something they created themselves. Pretty smart, aren&#39;t they? Mmmmhhh.... in the case of Heiko Maas i can&#39;t help myself but if I see him then inside my head I do compare him with Joseph Goebbels (Ok, Goebbels had no eyeglasses, but in my opinion they look pretty similar). Whatever he resembles is that he also lies, especially in relation to the situation in Syria. You, Eva, are not the only one who proves that you can travel to Syria as a tourist, of course only in the liberated areas. If you would travel to Idlib where the so-called &quot;moderate&quot; terrorists are in charge then it would be an open-end story. Damn, I did want to write a short comment, but there is so much to say about Syria. Yes, it will be rebuild, with or not with German help, because (and that was also a new experience for me) I did never see so brave people like those who defended their country against terrorism. With love and respect from my place to the Syria, its President and the brave men and women from the Syrian Arab Army. 🇸🇾❤🇷🇺❤🇮🇷❤✌️",Larry Laffer,2019-11-09T15:48:29Z,1

"Понимаю, что девушка старается на все смотреть аполитично, но то чем она восторгается в Сирии, а конкретно в Дамаске, было на волосок от исчезновения, в шаге от смерти. Ирония состоит в том, что Сирия стояла на краю, в основном из-за политики её государства в частности. Из-за того, что её государство всячески подогревало этот конфликт, лила бензин в костер и при том большими порциями, да собственно и продолжает это делать и по ныне. А ведь Дамаск постоянно подвергался минометным обстрелам из Восточной Гуты, поддерживаемыми США боевиками, буквально полтора года назад. Уверен жители Дамаска это хорошо помнят. Называть это просто &quot;конфликтом&quot; в данном случае это очень сильно преуменьшать, на мой взгляд.",Александр Нем,2019-10-28T21:35:28Z,0

"The prophecy for Syria:<br />Isaiah 17 <br /><br />God Will Destroy Damascus<br /><br />17 The special word about Damascus: “See, Damascus will no longer be a city. It will be destroyed and laid waste. 2 The cities of Aroer are left empty. They will be for the flocks to lie down in, and no one will make them afraid. 3 The strong city will be gone from Ephraim. Damascus will no longer rule. And those of Syria who are left alive will be like the shining-greatness of the sons of Israel,” says the Lord of All.<br /><br />4 In that day Jacob will lose his shining-greatness. And he will lose the fat of his flesh. 5 It will be like one who gathers the standing grain, taking the ears of grain with his arm or like one who gathers the ears of grain in the valley of Rephaim. 6 Yet some good will be left in it, as when an olive tree is shaken. There will still be two or three olives on the highest branch, and four or five on the branches of a tree that gives much fruit, says the Lord God of Israel.<br /><br />7 In that day man will turn to his Maker. His eyes will look to the Holy One of Israel. 8 He will not look to the altars, the work of his hands. He will not look to what his fingers have made, or to the false goddess Asherah and the altars of special perfume.<br /><br />9 In that day their strong cities will be like places left empty among the trees, or like high branches which they left behind because of the sons of Israel. The land will be laid waste. 10 For you have forgotten the God Who saves you. You have not remembered the rock where you are safe. So you plant beautiful plants, and put them with the vine-cuttings of a strange god. 11 In the day that you plant it you fence it in, and in the morning your seed is growing. But its fruit will waste away in a day of sickness and pain which cannot be healed.",Millenial Kingdom,2019-10-27T13:08:01Z,0

"Hate to be the skeptical one here, but seems a bit too convenient that you were one of the few tourists allowed into the country by the Syrian government, and your video is so favorable towards visiting. Leaves me wondering how much of a hand the Syrian government had in the making this trip. <br />As you showed the people of Syria - who are the true victims in the war going on there - did make your trip great as they are largely trying to get on with their lives in the midst of a bad situation. But it&#39;s hard to believe that in a country that is smaller than the US state of Kansas that you would not be feeling the effects of their civil war through and through. At the end of the day, Syria is still being run by a murderous dictator and those lovely citizens of Syria will never really be free until the Assad regime is removed from power.",dmwt91,2019-10-25T04:29:06Z,0

"Sure, perhaps the individual peoples of Damascus and Syria, those not involved in the &quot;crisis&quot; involving chemical warfare and foreign militaries, deserve to be shown to the world.  It&#39;s true that the people and the State are not always one, no matter which people or State one talks about.  But to call it a &quot;crisis&quot; and to gloss over the murder of Syrians by Syrians is irresponsible.  To visit the country and present it without that context is irresponsible.  There&#39;s a reason why you&#39;re one of few foreigners allowed into the country, where none were permitted a short time ago: they didn&#39;t want anybody with cameras capturing the bombs, the targets, the civilian deaths, and showing them to the world.  They didn&#39;t want you to see the Russian military carrying out the strikes.  They didn&#39;t want to show you which rebel factions they were killing, the unaligned militants like ISIL, or the foreign government-backed factions by Russia and the US.  It&#39;s a brave thing to go to Syria in this day and age; it&#39;s a cowardly thing to not disclose to the world what has transpired there.  The people that experienced the trauma, those lucky enough to still be alive, still live with the wounds; some of those wounds are new, still, years after the killing began.  You&#39;re covering up massacres and war crimes by holding the camera so close to your face and yet saying nothing.  The victims deserve better.",gfair2,2019-10-24T07:42:54Z,0

Assad wasn&#39;t the problem. Radical Sharia supporting &quot;rebels&quot; were the problem. And I totally get why you thought the country would be deserted, but you have to remember, Syria had a population of over 30 million people, before the conflict broke out.

They were trying to break in into my room, me and my room mate all night had to push the door when they tried to break in. It was terrible....... Now I have been in Canada for &gt;20 years, still having nightmares of my life there. Never will go back to my home country alone, and even with my family - there were too many stories of human right abuse....",Irina CANADA Boix Vancouver,2019-10-18T00:53:46Z,4
"Irina CANADA Boix Vancouver that is shoking to hear!! Where are you from originally? I am Syrian and have lived my entire life there as a independant girl and never had such issues, I had encountered verbal harrasment every now and then but a shout on him or asking any man for help would make the bad guy run. We used to live in peace and Syria was one of the safest countries in the world and look what happened! I just cannot swallow the whole story that we lived.",suha Khaled,2019-10-22T16:07:54Z,1

"Oh no some stupid woke female simpleton visited the country with zero regards to actually learning the history or in depth otherwise you visited it earlier such cities as Resafa, Tadmur etc etc. Wiht your stupid awareness for tragedy and conflict you are in my opinion a war tourist that only seeks validation and attention which you dont get at your own place. Such people as you needed to be banned from these sorts of countries. The people made your visit???? sorry but you lose all your credibility here. Go to a slutty vacation in spain or portugal or france where your kind belongs to and dont bother to go to these such places. I bet you dont go to south sudan, Somalia or central african republic oh wait then the tragic conflict doesnt count eh.<br /><br />I call for you all to stop support these kind of narcistic validation attention seekers.<br /><br />And for the people thinking im jealous think again.

Don&#39;t mistake &quot;kindness&quot; and &quot;generosity&quot; for thirst and for curiosity. I am a Muslim and I&#39;m from a religious city. And I&#39;ve traveled to quite a few places. Generosity and kindness in these places are usually mistaken for much simpler and more petty terms. Thirst and curiosity. We aren&#39;t kind or generous for the most part. We&#39;re starved.

"Amazing video! Thank you for not using the term civil war. What has started as a people&#39;s uprising against the Iranian-backed dictator spiraled out of control when richer neighbors (like the Saudis) started funding crazed terrorist (ISIS), some of which are foreigners, not even Syrians. Assad isn&#39;t entirely insane, as he does protect religious minorities and is not a religious fanatic, but then again, he gasses political opposition with help of the Russians, Iran, and Hezbollah... Now Turkey started bombing the Kurds inside Syria. We&#39;ve got a huge quagmire, no end in sight, I pray that one day the Syrian people are free, free to elect democratic leaders, to pray openly without fear of kidnapping, and free to defend their lands from foreign aggressors.",A H,2019-10-09T16:06:20Z,0

When I was Born in 1989 Lebanon was Sinking in what they said the Last years of the Civil War. My Grand Mother had a house in Damascus as she was from there. We Grew up in Damascus with the Big Family and kept visiting it every year and stayed later on at the Sheraton Hotel and used to Shop at Souk al Tanabel. We Had never imagined Damascus to fall in the trap of war and destruction. God Bless You Syria! You will always be Victorious as History taught us and will continue to tell the World. God Bless Everyone who believes in Prosperity and Peace. Love Love Love,PotCat official,2019-10-04T16:42:34Z,0

The sacrifice made by the Syrian people and it&#39;s army (sadly misinformed by the main stream media) is something to recognize and take as example of courage and honor. Not everybody is brainwashed by the msm and some people is aware of what Syria have been through, it&#39;s important for the world to know and that&#39;s why I find this kind of vlog so important.<br />I would love to visit and to help in any way possible.

You have to know that she was under strict surveillance by the secret police since the first second she entered Syria. Thus she was safe. Nobody can attack a foreigner in Damascus especially these days.

And what about 500 000+ deaths? What about  the millions of Syrians who had to flee their country and most of them - unlike you -aren&#39;t able to even visit it again? What about the supposed &quot;religious tolerance&quot; when the native Jewish population was ethnically cleansed already decades ago and only Islam and Christianity are recognised by the law? (+ Muslims in Syria aren&#39;t allowed to change their religion.). I suppose you are either incredibly naive or just well-paid by the propaganda ministry. Probably the latter.,Rojaaaa,2019-09-28T12:33:02Z,3

"ELE GBH if you want to know how and why we’re worried about our demographic replacement.  It’s quite simple.  We believe there is a concerted effort by those who control our governments to allow mass immigration into our countries.  This mass immigration is hugely undermining the cohesion of our society.   Different groups don’t integrate.  Multiculturalism is a dangerous myth and a lot of us believe this will be the  end of not only the west as we know it but also eventually white people pretty much altogether.   We’re already a massive minority in the world but there is a constant push for our women to mix with people from different regions.  It’s literal genocide.   Look at the UN definition of genocide and it is happening to whites.   While I understand people of the third world are looking for a better life, we need to push for a fairer world so everyone prospers where they are as best they can.  <br /><br />The current trajectory is an absolute recipe for disaster.",DrAIR,2019-09-30T21:44:39Z,0
DrAIR I’m an open minded person I’m an atheist i do believe in human rights and democracy that’s enough to be an enemy in the government eyes.. so it’s not only about being islamic or not <br /><br />it’s more about being under control of the army and the dictatorship..<br /> <br />we all as syrian want to build our home back we had one of the most successful economies between the middle east countries and maybe in the eyes of many the best medicare and one of the strongest and highest education system around the world wich we got for free .. so we already build a strong nation in about 80 years after having the independence from France .. <br /><br />“BUT” i would really like to know from you how do you people talk about the replacement and how much you’re afraid and terrifying about it meanwhile you’re or at lest your governments are the reason that our country has been completely destroyed for a political interesting.<br /><br />is it fair to ask us after destroying what we have built for a long years to left the future that we built for us one more time in Germany USA Britain or any where else after our land has been completely smashed and in some where else turned completely to ache.<br /><br />You’re the people of the west are really selfish and everything you care about is yourself.. we have been save til 2011 before you take your decisions to destroy a strong Nations named Syria and the refugees problem is the only way to say sorry for destroying there land so don’t miss the chance 👍🏻,ELE ABD,2019-09-30T20:08:15Z,2
"ELE GBH thanks for the reply.  If you’re not on the side of Assad doesn’t that mean you’re on the side of the Islamic extremists funded by Mossad and CIA to take over your country?  Also, I’m sorry but wanting to avoid your countries national draft isn’t an excuse for the demographic replacement of the west.   I don’t blame the people coming here.  I blame those who are pushing our governments to do this.  They are trying to pit Islam and the west against each other and eventually replace the indigenous European population with non Europeans.  <br /><br />I wish you all the luck in returning to your homeland.  Make Syria Great Again.",DrAIR,2019-09-30T17:29:19Z,0
"DrAIR it depends on which side of the conflict these syrian are.. if they support Bashar al Assad government so it’s some kind of safe for these people but if they dont they could be send to jail, get killed or even worse <br /><br />And in my situation for example if i go back to Syria i should go to the Syrian army what i actually refused so many times till now <br /><br />With all respect",ELE ABD,2019-09-29T11:43:52Z,1

"Have a good time in Damascus? OK then let&#39;s talk about the hard time we&#39;ve got there.. <br />Have you ever asked your self why they are so generous? Because they didn&#39;t have much foreign tourists come to visit as a normal way, why?  Because of the dictator regime of Bashar al-Assad and his father since over 40 years.. Because this regime closed the country on the faces of the world, to keep Syrian people away from the reality, and to keep the eyes of the world away of what really happening inside this country.. <br />So, why you didn&#39;t talk about the military chick points in all and arround the city stopping the traffic, taken the guys to military, and humiliating the women and old people, disrespecting the morality, religions and the civil life!! <br />You just showed the face of dictator al-Assad many times in your videos, why don&#39;t you asked your self about forcing people to post his photos everywhere like a rockstar! Is this exists in where you come from?  To posting the photos of Trump everywhere? <br />Why don&#39;t you talk about what really happened there?  You just show some streets acting like a typical orientalist come film the magic of the orient...! <br />These streets you&#39;ve filmed, I grown-up in.. And I can&#39;t go back to visit them because I can&#39;t cross the borders to my country, because this mother fucker regime will kill me like he did for hundreds of thousands of people like me..!  Why?  Because we asked for FREEDOM and to live with dignity as it should be.. <br />If you just try to tell the truth about this criminal regime, the world will listen, your people will know what really going on in this country.. <br />Just because I tried to film some videos like yours, the syrien military police hunting me since 8 years.. <br />I hope you enjoyed the icecream in Bakdash, they gived to you for free and quietly without explanation hoping that you will tell the truth when you go back..  Because they can&#39;t...<br />Sorry for the hard talking, but at least you can think about it and try to consider the truth..",Saad Rabiee,2019-09-24T18:29:07Z,1

This really touched my heart.. Thank you so much for visiting Syria thank you for spreading love and not hate thank you for opening people&#39;s eyes there was no separation only your kind words..... Some might say you haven&#39;t visited the war areas just to confirm Damascus was under one of the worst attacks in the war and its safe again.... Only if people had known what Syria was like..  Damascus is the oldest city in the world we had no differences in religion or type we treated everyone as human race they are giving generous their educated it was the only country that had no dept we had history we had justice in our living .. After 9 years our army and people have giving up their lifes to save this beautiful country<br />Unfortunately their was history  stolen media made us look like bad hard hearted people that our army is killing everyone... Thank you for showing the truth you&#39;re a beautiful soul and I hope you get to see more of syria and know the history you will be proud to have visited this country ❤️❤️,Lulu Blue,2019-09-20T22:20:06Z,0

What this young woman is encountering is the difference between reality and propaganda. She could have been making her journey a thousand years ago and contrast between those two things what not have been so different. The West often defines the Islamic world as being trapped in a medieval mindset but I would argue that this is a projection of its own military/industrial system which is rooted in the reality of medieval Europe.,Raf The Jaf,2019-09-19T06:12:55Z,0

"I am an Arab and I strongly advise my fellow human brothers and sister from western countries not to believe what the media says about us, the media represent the financial elites and governments and tend to demonize certain people and areas because of geo political interests etc. but the absolute majority of us coexist and live with Christians etc. in Peace and harmony whereas the media portrays us as being violent, barbaric, dangerous and full of hate but the truth is that, with a very very few exception (which is the case in any country and culture) most of us are generous, gentle, warm hearted and peaceful :) So please my fellow friends from the western world, make your own experience and make your own picture instead of listening to media propaganda and lies :) We are all the same, one mankind.

"Finally!, Truthful and positive first hand reporting on Syria and people of Syria. Western reporters often exercise lazy journalism by simply copying from previous reporters who are biased or have reported on Syria with an agenda. Christians, Muslims of all sects, Kurds, and Jews (yes Jews) live peacefully in Syria. It is a true natural melting pot. The government does its best to protect the rights of minorities. Syrian merchants and shops all celebrate Christmas when it is time for Christmas and all celebrate Ramadan when it is time for Ramadan. The war in Syria was the result of group of Arab oil rich nations Saudi Arabia and Qatar wanting to have passage to Europe and the Mediterranean Sea and to do so they wanted to overthrow the Syrian government and stall a puppet government to take advantage off. This also fit the needs of Israel, Turkey and few western nations who supported the idea, the plan and execution of that plan to this date. They wanted to replicate what they did in Libya. Today, it has been over (10) years and Libya has no central government and is in a state a chaos who&#39;s oil and resources are stolen by the same EU nations with penny on the dollar from the warlords who  do not know what a barrel of oil is worth. Syrians chose to fight back and paid a heavy price because they knew very well the consequences of the alternative. It is true there are some true Syrians who feel the government power balance needs to change. And it should.  But, there are also many with hidden agendas that are not good for Syria or Syrians. Some think it needs to run by Sharia law when Syria has always been a secular nations. Some talk of freedom and democracy but all their intentions are just to take over the power. The length of this war (8 years now) ruined Syria&#39;s economy, infrastructure, human and natural resources, but it also brought to light the intentions of the many so called &quot;opposition&quot; militancy to the Syrians. Some political opposition do want true and fair change, but those ones were simply were used by Saudi&#39;s/Qatar/Turkey simply as a front to start the first few &quot;Syrian protests&quot; and were sidelined quickly once their use has expired. I wish and hope peace will return to Syria. A united full Syria with its all territory. I hope other powerful nations stop the games they play and let the Syrians start the rebuilding process and return Syria to what is was before.",Vic Daniel,2019-09-16T00:16:06Z,1

Damascus is where Assad lives, I am sure it was mostly spared from direct destruction, but it did for sure feel the huge psychological and economic effects, just as Lebanon did.<br /><br />The destruction is further away, farmers, regular people living in other cities in the countryside. You can ask any Syrian refugee in Lebanon, they all have incredible stories about how their home was bombed, how they lost relatives, sometimes were not even able to bury them, and how they left the fruits of their life&#39;s labor, their lands, their homes behind so that they can have a minimum of security and stability, and it might be a decade before they are allowed to go back, as many are now considered fugitives wanted for deserting the military or fighting the regime.<br /><br />Yes they are generally modest people, with a beautiful culture, which makes this tragedy even worse.",Ro lf,2019-09-14T22:09:14Z,0

"What do you want to say here? The Syrians are modest, generous and welcoming. This is true, but they are still suffering from dictatorship as you never mention. Syria is not only Damascus. Why are you not trying to visit Sednaya prison? the military prison, 30 km north of Damascus, is run by Bashar al-Assad&#39;s gangs, where more than 15,000 prisoners have been tortured and starved to death  (just take a look at &quot;The Caesar photographs&quot; if you can) out Of the 200,000 prisoners still held in the regime&#39;s deadly prisons, also please try to visit Ghouta, another place near Damascus which was bombarded with chemical weapons a few years ago (2013), and the massacre is still running out in Idlib (another Syrian city btw)...<br /> In general; Syria is not a safe country to visit yet (except a very few big cities) , but the most important thing is that &quot;going to Syria&quot; at this time is just a normalization with the &quot;de facto&quot; regime and participation in its propaganda to cover up the bloody crimes which commited by the Syrian army and its allies against the Syrian people for nearly ten years, unless these facts are clearly stated, and do not wearing this brutal regime&#39;s flag as a scarf (as you unfortunately did at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dR61b8U_Ac&amp;t=2m45s"">2:45</a> ).<br />Otherwise all this is nothing but selfish to achieve the scoop and attract views and followers and then “compliment” the victims in one or two words at the end of the party ..",Hussam Arafa,2019-09-14T12:28:31Z,0

Because some strong people organized it for profit???? And that&#39;s who runs the world, lunatics. If I know right, Syria was like the most educated nation in middle east, very prosperous country, but that&#39;s why they did it, they don&#39;t like other strong countries, they only like slave countries. I know from personal experience since im from Serbia former Yugoslavia. They did the same thing to us, but the difference is that we lost, and you won, you saved your dignity.<br />I wish you all the best and I wish that you recover and rebuild everything in a short time and you will be two times stronger then you were when they tried to obliterate you.<br />I hope that US imperialism is coming to an end, when that happens world will see prosperity and harmony.<br />Im convinced that Nikola Tesla was made/sent to guide us to another level, total humanity prosperity. But some single bad, greedy individuals sacrificed the future of humanity for their personal gain.

There are scars of war everywhere (bombed neighbourhoods, lost children etc) but you have to remember 99% of the country is in government hands now, of course there are check points everywhere but this makes you feel even more safe. They may ask you for your passport as proof of ID at check points...I was asked once for the entire two weeks I was there. Syrians are just normal people, like me and you! If you go just make sure you stay in government controlled areas and there is little chance of anything going wrong! I forgot there was a war when I was there!

Pro Assad&#39;s regions are not only protected by Syria Arab Army but also by Syrian allies like Russia and Iran.

"Damascus was the least affected by the war since it&#39;s where the government runs from and where the president lives. It&#39;s old, traditional, beautiful, and the richest families in the country choose to live in it (I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve at least driven by some stunning grand houses). The generosity is very real though. There&#39;s a saying in the Levant: &quot;do good deeds and throw them in the ocean&quot;. Basically meaning that good things will come back to you if you do good things for others. <br />If you want to see the effects of the last 10 years though, drive to Homs or Halab (although it&#39;s extremely dangerous especially for a woman and a foreigner). It&#39;s pretty dire, and what you see in the news &amp; online is true and very heartbreaking.",Ms Medieval,2019-09-09T11:46:04Z,0

I think you can comment after being not ignorant. Who told you Syria is a Muslim country? Syria is a multi religion country a cradle of Christianity. The Syrian laws are secular and Syria is ruled by Alawi president. Alawism is a mixture or religions and ancient philosophies. They were Christians then they follow Imam Ali as a new Jesus. Wine is holy in Alawism and their women don&#39;t cover. Syria has also many other doctrines like Alawites such as Druze and Christians. Half of Syrian population is not Muslims. Also Syria has secular and liberal people from muslims. Moreover are you drugged experimental mouse to not see that Syria was fighting the Islamists all over its war? Have you seen the Syrian First Lady? And are you aware that Syrian president is a doctor?,Inside Truth,2019-09-09T18:36:07Z,0

"Problem of Syria, Africa and Middle east in general, birthrates are to high, even in wartime they still give many birth to childeren. There i s no future for so many. It&#39;s sad but the inconvenient true, Assad want to get rid of his own people, because he&#39;s got nothing to offer. So now they stranded in Lebanon and Turkey, and looking for a new host, West Europe. But there will be limit in what we can do, and indigenious people will not accept this anymore, this will cause a lot of social disturbance. For example indiginous pleople can not start with their live, after graduation. Houses are given away to Syrian family&#39;s with a average of 5 childeren, elders are unemployed and depend on social welfare till the end of time, imagine how many childsupport they get, insane. But in general you see the birthrates of newborns from Africa are surpassing indiginious people. White naive people who are rushing in trafficjam every morning to their jobs are paying for the care of muslims. In the afternoon you see them doing nothing in town, or there is always a huge line in the supermarket.  What can you do about it, Birthcontrol i propose?",Chi,2019-09-08T22:04:47Z,0

One thing for improvement is since it seems you filmed with your camera in hand, the vlog is so shaky that most times it’s very difficult to see the city and places you visit.

"While Lebanon has a higher proportion of people other than Sunni muslims, it doesn&#39;t blend all of that quite as good as Syria. Syria is unique. You go to Damascus and you lose yourself in  the vastness of everything. <br />Other places great for visits are Latakia and Aleppo. Aleppo is on the frontline with the rebels, and I wouldn&#39;t recomment going there just yet, and there may not be a lot to see yet, as it is still recovering. It was damaged beyond repair imo. One of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in history. Hard to imagine all the beauty went away in a matter of years. <br />Latakia though, hasn&#39;t been touched by the war, and there you can see what you see in Beirut. Just people, of different religions, ethnic backgrounds, living comfortably with each other, in a more western manner. And you have the coast also, so you can enjoy that too. Syria was full of stuff to visit. Too bad this war destroyed almost everything.",Живко Яннкулоски,2019-09-08T06:24:07Z,0

"Eva zu Beck I hope I can meet you in person one day! I remember watching one of Anthony Bourdain’s show, before the war started, he eating that wonderful Syrian ice cream. It sparked an interest in me to travel the world and simply be immersed in others’ cultures, knowing it will enrich mine and hoping I may enrich theirs. I believed travelling and meeting and knowing people as they are is the cure to ignorance. Thank you for showing Syria, thank you for proving that! Your videos reignited that passion in me to know others’ way of life. May God bless you more!",Karl Campos,2019-09-06T20:35:11Z,0

"Pure propaganda for the dictatorship. I can not believe that people are dying every day in Idlib and you are commenting what a wonderful ice-cream you had. Really? How frivolous!!! I can not believe that you are laundering the image of a dictatorship responsible for a civil war in which more or less 600.000 people have died, and that is not counting the 85.000-100.000 people who have vanished after being arrested by the dictatorship&#39;s thugs. And we still have to count the people who are going to die in the battle for Idlib and the battle for Rojava, which will obviously take place after the first one. Anyway, if you have not done so yet, go the ministry of propaganda to collect your cheque. Imagine how many ice-creams you are going to be able to buy.

"I guess it&#39;s fair to be a little surprised at Damascus looking like a normal, happy place, but keep in mind that&#39;s because it&#39;s the capital, a stronghold for the government and the middle class. There was little to no fighting there. Go to the suburbs like Daraya, Douma, or Ghouta, and you&#39;ll see what most poor Syrians are actually dealing with these days.",King Bibi,2019-09-04T13:55:04Z,243

Hi. I visited Syria for the first time in January 2019. What i saw and felt was pure love and generosity from everyone I met. For people that have been to hell and back all they wanted to do was give and ask for nothing in return. I loved my trip that this Christmas I will be traveling back to spend another month there. God bless Syria and it’s people. And to you EVA thank you so much for such a beautiful vlog. First time watching you and you have won my heart!!!,Hus Hus,2019-09-04T09:41:31Z,0

They Never had issues due to religion or cultural differences, people lived harmoniously.  We all now live in Canada, so it’s very heartwarming to see that not all is gone from this beautiful and welcoming country. One day I hope to visit, and your video gives me hope it can still happen.

"A lot of things and places shown in this video remind me very much of Cairo with its old mosques, bazaars, cafes, so I could imagine the feel and the smell of your excursions through Damascus. Whenever I meet someone from Syria or Yemen I feel like I want to hug them to make their pain go away. One day I&#39;d love to travel to Syria, too. However, I&#39;m sure if you travel to other parts of Syria you will find a lot of despair and destruction, and yet the same strong, proud people. I understand why you received so many gifts - the locals are thankful when foreigners come to finally visit their country again, because it gives them hope of things becoming better again.

I haven&#39;t been able to see my country for so many years so it was so nice to be able to see it and feel as if I went on a small little tourist trip to old Damascus with you. I&#39;m really happy. And this is also just a tiny tiny tiny bit of what Damascus has to offer, let alone Syria the country. Thank you for also showing people who aren&#39;t from Syria what kind of country it is and what the people is like. I have seen so much prejudice and assumptions, not surprising considering the media, but definitely hurtful. It&#39;s nice to see a more accurate picture being painted and shown. Thank you.<br />And second of all: thank you so much to everyone in the comments saying nice things about Syria, and being nice in general. I&#39;m seeing a lot of people from Pakistan for example.

Jeden z najbardziej przyjaznych narodow. Gesty miejscowych - od zaplacenia za taksowke w Homs do zaproszenie na wesele w Aleppo, nie wspominajac o niesamowitej kobiecie, ktora odwiozla nas z miejsca polozonego niedaleko abasady Jordanii do naszego hostelu w centrum Damaszku spieszac sie przy tym do zostawionych samemu dzieci w domu. Hehe jedna noc  spedzilismy spiac na dachu(nie bylo juz zadnych wolnych miejsc w miescie) a rano okolo godz. 5tej obudzily nas nawolywania muzeina z meczetu...Co za klimat! I to wszystko w jednym z najstarztch wciaz istniejacych miast swiata! Jedna z ulic na Damascenskim suku jest wspomniana w Biblii! Kurdowie z polnocy zapraszali nas do siebie na kilka dni!!!

They truly want to be kind and nice irrespective of your background or circumstances becs as humans they know blood and tears are the same everywhere !!!<br />their zest for survival has given them the attitude to train their minds to &#39;distract&#39; them from their surroundings or situations.. story telling is such an amazing soother..it takes you to a distant place, in a distant world where love and peace exists in some form.

"As a Syrian, I would like to thank you for soo many things. First of all thank you for using the term crisis instead of civil war. 2nd thank for your courage that lead you to take a trip like this one and see the beauty of Damascus for your own eyes, despite all the trouble surrounding it. Damascus only reflects the beauty of its visitors, if you can see and appreciate its beauty, then you are a beautiful person yourself, thats what I believe. Thank you for appreciating those simple gifts, it shows what a kind hearted person you are. Finally as a hardcore party animal, I’m a bit sad you didn’t show night life in damascus :p. It too has a tase of its own. Also, rest assured you are always welcome, you have got yourself another home. Greetings",Zinoun1000,2019-09-02T03:59:56Z,3299

"@hilbert2547 The Syrians do not fight each other ..... and the one who gave weapons to the terrorists and sent them to us is the one who launched the lie of the civil war to have a justification for occupying our land as they do now.<br />Seven years ago, the terrorists entered the village where my friend lived on the Turkish border, killed her family and all children in the village, and they have recorded the most horrific killing videos, wearing the clothes of the Syrian army, to devote the lie of the civil war.  <br />I cannot forget that day when these videos were shown on international channels  and spreading lies, and at the same time my friend and village girls were solding as slaves in Turkey.<br />Three years later, Some mothers from this village were freed after exchanging with  terrorists who were arrested by the syrian army, and they spoke to the media about their painful story, but all these interviews with those women  are hidden from western media and nobody shows them.",Gh 777,2021-02-16T11:44:10Z,0

Jesus knew that God Created him in his mother&#39;s womb with his mother Mary being a pure virgin.   This was a miracle from God.  God Created Adam with Adam not having a mother or a father.

They are so well-mannered, well educated, cultured, but at the time have so much knowledge of different countries and languages. My admiration for these people have made me very interested in Syria, and getting a glimpse of that country as it is today moved me.

"This was exactly the kind of inside blog I have been looking for from Syria. The preconceptions of Syria is so limited and twisted that it is almost normal for many parts of the world to reduce Syria to just rubble and crying children. Syria is indeed the cradle of our civilisation. Just so immensely sad what this beautiful country with it&#39;s ancient history and lovely people have gone through the last decade. Keep making these incredible blogs! Love from Lahore, Pakistan.",Aiza Khan,2019-08-27T14:56:34Z,2

@jan kabir It is their matter .Stupid foriegn jihadist flying from other countries including our Pakistan and   USA and France involvement ruined them .<br />In Pakistan we also had brutal dictators but you would never want other countries to interfere in our country matters .,hmmm,2019-08-27T14:34:01Z,1

"It&#39;s not so simple . <br />That&#39;s what media tells you. <br />There are many stake holders in syrian war and destruction .Syria is collateral damage of countries cold wars and mutual interest .  Few names are team US/ israel and other side Russia/Iran, Assad regime.",Hadeel Bashir,2019-08-27T12:59:55Z,1
"Wow 😱 Your passion for travelling these uncommon places is so inspiring. It is beyond amazing to see you throwing out all the bullshit that western media portrays and showing the truth and real beauty of these countries. As an Australian 🇦🇺 we are told on the news that Syria is a dangerous place that is continually in war but thankfully you are showing the reality of the situation. Keep travelling, keep inspiring and keep chasing your dreams ❤️",Travel with Luke Damant,2019-08-27T12:44:28Z,138

"Yout gotta be a incredibily naive person to believe she&#39;s showing the reality of Syria. If she did, she would tell about Assad&#39;s crimes",Ayhan K.,2020-06-08T13:55:50Z,0
"My friend don’t listen to them cuz every one say oh there is war in Syria and if you gonna travel to Syria you gonna die,  but this is not true we have war in the north of Syria.but I promise you, if you want to travel to Syria you have to enjoy in the oldest city in the world Damascus !",No,2019-09-23T14:54:38Z,0
"Guys, Damascus is safe and beautiful and good to live in as long as you are not an opponent of the regime. But I dare you to go to other parts of the country. It´s good to see the people of a country not only as victims, but at the same time, please keep in mind that she is filming from a very privileged perspective. The Syrian people I now can only dream of a vacation there like that. They probably wouldn´t survive it.",Née Naiin,2019-09-05T20:37:35Z,0
