Talibans don’t attack people randomly. They know what is Islam is and in Islam innocent people aren’t killed and shouldn’t be killed. And those attacks aren’t from Talibans. Why don’t you interview a real Taliba and know what is what,Mozzy Tou,2021-04-27T20:33:42Z,0

"We all know AlQaeda and Taliban and ISIS are a creation of USA. The weapons are supplied by the devious USA to destabilize Islamic countries. The real terrorists are the USA pretending to help but behind the scene they fund the terrorists! This documentary is false!<br /><br />USA have the most advanced military and UAV Drones and highly trained special forces that can take control of Afghanistan in 1 day if they wanted to. But if there is peace in Afghanistan then USA have to go home.<br /><br />The reason USA wants to stay in Afghanistan is control of the region, keep eyes on neighboring countries like China, Iran, Russia and Pakistan. <br /><br />USA will never leave Afghanistan, they will keep funding terrorists and  killing more Afghans!",Mystic Traveler,2021-04-27T17:40:02Z,0

"Don&#39;t try to pin the blame for today&#39;s problems on the events of 1979. They had their precursor in the previous years, and by April 1978 it had become the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, with the Soviets intervening at the behest of the internationally recognised Afghani government (so &quot;invasion&quot; is fundamentally wrong). If you wish to impute blame, then direct this towards the mandarins in the US deep state who funded the Mujahideen thus giving rise to the Taliban. Up until the late 1970s, the crisis in Afghanistan was no more special than anywhere else in the world.",99Boiko,2021-04-16T13:58:43Z,0

"But it so much differs for the people living in Afghanistan, almost 90 percent of them want to go abroad but are not able to. I as an Afghan is someone that is not able to share my religious beliefs to other people even my parents. I got strikes many times from my father just because I do not pray. <br />Another thing is racism. I am Hazara, a nationality that their people are killed just because first they are Shia and second they have short nose and tight eyes 😩. <br />Like many people in Afghanistan. I am as well trying to get out of this country and follow my dreams. <br />Thank you, the video was so inspiring for me and I somehow feel better 😘",English Hub,2021-04-15T06:57:27Z,0

Un&#39;esperienza ricca e diversificata ci dice che iniziare il lavoro quotidiano di posizionamento implica modi indipendenti di implementare la cessione delle attivita correnti.<br />Come gia piu volte accennato, i rappresentanti delle moderne riserve sociali ci chiamano a nuove conquiste, di cui, a loro volta, devono essere chiamati in causa. Come gia accennato molte volte, i prototipi interattivi aggiungono solo differenze di fazione e sono distribuiti in modo associativo tra i settori..<br />E dificil dizer por que as conclusoes tiradas com base na analise da Internet, superando a dificil situacao economica atual, se misturam com dados nao unicos a ponto de serem completamente irreconheciveis, o que aumenta seu status de inutilidade. A pratica cotidiana mostra que o rumo a um projeto nacional de orientacao social requer a definicao e o esclarecimento dos rumos do desenvolvimento progressivo.Consideracoes ideologicas de ordem superior, assim como a metodologia de desenvolvimento moderna, envolvem o processo de introducao e modernizacao do modelo de desenvolvimento.

USA occupied and try to apply own rule and culture.It&#39;s impossible.<br /><br />Taliban don&#39;t allow adultery and porn. They don&#39;t allow the Islamic gathering. Unknown men and Women must be separate. Its modern world studies conclude in separate education student perform better. Taliban allow marriages as someone get puberty.<br /><br /><br /><br />Check the USA statistics <br />Number of homeless people<br />The young mother that the result of co education<br />The teacher student affairs <br />The broken families because of extra marital affaires <br />Increasing adultery with viral infections,ARSLAN AZIZ,2021-04-11T20:14:29Z,0

What US and world get else destruction. USA even did not wait of completing the  Taliban Shura in 2000. World knows them  from 1000 year Afghans are born Warrior and Merchant.

"@MSK Channel  according to any kind of laws such as international and national, u and people like u dont have the right to  call all Afghan. This is  against humanity,  laws ect. Wanting ur own ethnicity does not mean ( fight or) . Everyone is free and born free, calling all group of people afghan means that too  ur deleting their language,  history, traditions ect much. try to think first,  than write. There r many videos on YouTube which educated people argumented and shared the real info according to history and laws.<br />Me and millions of people  r from afg,  but not Afghan.

"You’re regurgitating the same mainstream bs about Afghanistan. The taliban is supported by the US, at least indirectly. The US could  get rid of them yesterday but it didn’t because the US needs an excuse to stay in Afghanistan. The taliban are the boogeymen to scare the Americans so that they rally together and support their government. In doing so they’re voluntarily giving up their freedoms one by one in the name of “war on terror”. The patriot act, body scanners etc. are all weapons against everyday Americans, not the taliban.",KB E,2021-03-31T14:20:40Z,1

"Nobody dresses like that? Are you kidding me. I live in Kabul and my family wears this and most people in Kabul do. Almost 99% wear headscarves and the Abaya / locally called Hijab is frequent. Just visit Foroahgah and Lycee Maryam Bazar to see shops selling these Abayas. Btw, she is not here to visit Parks and shopping malls or Hookah bars.!! She has these things all over the world and including the UK. She is visiting the traditional and purr Afghanistan.

"You should go to a Balkh Province, Mazar -e Sharif. It is relatively more peaceful than the rest of the country probably as peaceful as Bamiyan. They just celebrated New Year’s in there, they call it Nowruz. It is celebrated in there in the most grandeur and magnificent way, it is like Christmas and new year combined. New Year starts on March 21st and the celebration goes on for 40 days. So do not miss it while you in there. I think it is like 4 Hours drive going north, from Bamiyan to Mazar.",Kourosh587,2021-03-28T18:47:03Z,0

Because as you said its extremely complexx <br /><br />So better don&#39;t be on a side while we didn&#39;t live when Taliban started .<br /><br />After visiting places start visiting ideas . Islam sharia law is different concept of life . I&#39;m muslim and i don&#39;t know much about and i can&#39;t be with or against . <br />So for a non muslim it need decades to understand the concept and reach the feeling of been muslim,萨德سعد SD,2021-03-28T17:30:54Z,0

First time watching this channel and have to say I expected something different - escpecially because of the misleading thumbnail. Will be watching the following parts and hope to see more dimensions to Afghanistan. I realize how difficult it must be to get a comprehensive view on the culture but maybe you can show more of the women&#39;s life and how young women see their future. I would be very interested in that. It was almost a shock to finally see some women in the video when they showed up because up to that they were nowhere to be seen.,Hedera Helix,2021-03-28T12:14:26Z,0

"I don’t know what to say you are one of the bravest women I ever seen. I will visit Afghanistan after 14 years. We are stuck in a war which it doesn’t belong to Afghans. I hope this long war end soon. Afghans are so hospitable people. I live in the USA no one knows their neighbors. No one offers food or anything else to the strangers, but Afghans do for the stronger. They always offer  food and drinks even to stay in their houses if you want.",Sami H,2021-03-27T05:35:29Z,1

"“Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. 2In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. 3And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. 4And where I go you know, and the way you know.”<br />5Thomas said to Him, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?”<br />6Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.<br />The Father Revealed<br />7“If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him.”<br />8Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us.”<br />9Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? 10Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works. 11Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the sake of the works themselves.<br />The Answered Prayer<br />12“Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father. 13And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. 14If you ask anything in My name, I will do it.<br />Jesus Promises Another Helper<br />15“If you love Me, keep My commandments. 16And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever— 17the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you. 18I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.<br />Indwelling of the Father and the Son<br />19“A little while longer and the world will see Me no more, but you will see Me. Because I live, you will live also. 20At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. 21He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him.”<br />22Judas (not Iscariot) said to Him, “Lord, how is it that You will manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world?”<br />23Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. 24He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father’s who sent Me.<br />The Gift of His Peace<br />25“These things I have spoken to you while being present with you. 26But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you. 27Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. 28You have heard Me say to you, ‘I am going away and coming back to you.’ If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I said, ‘I am going to the Father,’ for My Father is greater than I.<br />29“And now I have told you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe. 30I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me. 31But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave Me commandment, so I do.

Taliban&#39;s were created by US to fight against USSR army during Russian invasion in Afghanistan. they were apple of the eyes than how come suddenly they became terrorist? Taliban&#39;s are fighting for their country, the country which belongs to them. how come they became terrorists and US army the hero? how? lots of people were killed in Afghanistan during the civil war between the time when Russian left and US invaded.

I have been several times as a woman also 2 times alone in Afghanistan in 1974, 1977 and 1978 on my way to and back from India. It has been one of the most amazing countries I have ever seen. Also the nicest people I have met. In Herat was an amazing place. It was like travelling back in time.  After the UDSSR invation Herat lost its beautiful rural style and they built ugly beton houses. I literally forgot to eat while staying in Herat. So many things to see. And there was only one street. From Herat to Khandahar the USA built the street and from Kandahar up into the UDSSR the other street was build by Russia. I was travelling with a local bus to Kabul. I still can remember the bakery with all the tasty stuff they sold.",Trinity Inspiration,2021-03-25T04:57:26Z,0

I’m nervous that the name and face of your guide, and even the proximity of his home is so openly visible in your vlog. Also the identities of the Afghan women who appeared with you during their “photo shoot”. Don’t get me wrong - I fully support the rights of these individuals to live their lives any way they choose, but as your guide himself pointed out, Afghanistan is still vulnerable to groups like the Taliban. Please bear this in mind as you continue with this series. May you and all the people of Afghanistan be safe. 🙏🏽",Soocheang Wee,2021-03-24T17:53:34Z,1

"Hypocrisy is at 100. Russia attacked Afghanistan,  America attacked Afghanistan without any strong evidence that Osama was responsible for the 2001 attack and the terrorists are Taliban. You don&#39;t know them, you have not met these people. When you defend your land it is called a holy war but when they defend their land from Russia, America, or from the laws of so-called western democracy they are terrorists.  America is the biggest terrorist doing terrorism in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, and other Muslim countries. We want to live by the laws of our creator mentioned in the Quran so please leave us alone.

First of all Taliban are not the terrorists rather they are the legit owners of Afghanistan and yes their view of governance doesn&#39;t fit the western prospective.<br />Secondly if you don&#39;t know anything about Sharia I don&#39;t think you have any right to talk about it. <br />And finally the Sharia is a million times better than the western democracy.<br />This is least expected from you. You are visiting a country at the same time refuting the very basic concept of their living,shah iffi syed,2021-03-24T07:42:11Z,1

Ist time i m not agreed with u eva zu beck. Taliban are not terrorist they didnt attack on any nation nither they are invovled in 9.11 attacks. Not a single taliban has been sentenced on 9. 11 ATTACKS. THEY ARE THE Rulers of Afghanistan before america invaded. They are only fighting for their NATION. How can u call them terrorist?

"I  regards your work but there are two types of taliban the one who only defends muslims and other people you can say all humans they are the true muslims they belive in islamic rules (shariya) and the other type of taliban is terriorists they harm peoples by doing blasts, killing peoples and everything you can imagine  of the voilance . They only show muslims as terriorist to the world they are not the muslims. The first when i hear  the words &quot;shariya&quot;and you say strict rules of islam i got shocked because        the shariya of islams defends every living rights these are the rules who defends everyliving creature and the only way you can know about it is study about shariya (islamic rules)as you saw with your own eyes that how the world media shows afghanistan to the world .similarly they show shariya as strict rules of islam to the world. So please don not rely on the media  that what they show to you .And also please study some shariya of islam and by studying shariya you can find that islam is the greatest protecter of human rights and we only belive in peace not in wars . <br /><br />Thank a lot.<br />Love from Pakistan",IT'S YOUR TIME,2021-03-22T13:47:26Z,1

Example overland travelling utilising the China BRI initiatives. Secondly , as the tourism was on standstill , Agriculture just too  a new beginning and interest by everyone.

Terrorist attacks on local people especially not done by Talibans. ALL these types of attacks are sponsered by international key players (CIA.RAW.MOSSAD etc) to defame the Taliban.

Facts ... 1) if fighting for freedom against invasive forces that&#39;s terrorism than Taliban are terrorist otherwise they are freedom fighters .<br />2) Taliban never had the firepower the destruction that US and their more than 40 countries allies did Taliban didn&#39;t even 1% of that . <br />3) the only thing I wish as I&#39;ve been there having friends there beautiful people I want to see peace there. Where people didn&#39;t have to live in fear ..<br />4) if anyone wants to know what type of people Talibans are watch their diplomats negotiating with Americans but don&#39;t take their manners for granted if anyone or any power challenged them in war they will break them .,R B,2021-03-22T04:16:10Z,0

"It’s good that you are visiting and showing the beauty, simplicity, love, kindness of Afghans and Afghanistan but why you are saying again and again Taliban the terrorist. They are not terrorist they are fighting for the their country for their land  in fact terrorist are those who have brutally killed the innocent people here from last four decades like Russians like NATO Allies from all over the world. Just think on the one side there was whole of the world and in the other side only Afghanistan and still Afghanistan is the winner of this long fight. <br />So please don’t call them terrorist that shows the double standard because on one side you western people like you called them heros and Mujahideen when they were fighting against Russia and now you call them terrorist but there fight is still the same for their land for their country and for their liberty.",Salman Adeel,2021-03-22T02:03:38Z,0

"Excellent Eva. I think much of the tortured history of the Afghan people relates to the Brits invading twice in the 1800s, introducing opium to grow for their China trade, overthrowing the liberal Afghan king in 1918 (or so)--followed by American imperial designs. The airport at Kandahar was built as a refueling stop for American B-52s with nuclear bombs on their way to Russia.

I know several European girls (some of them are blond) which spend several weeks in Afghanistan during Corona period and according their videos and photos they have no Abaya fashion but standard western clothing with covering hair only. As Eva they also always had support by local person which guaranteed her secure. Sometimes Kabul is less dangerous than some “no go” zones in western part of EU.,Vladimir Zivkovic,2021-03-21T15:15:56Z,0
"@Anna Kaunitz Ask domestic people in Paris, Brussels or Goteborg where is very danger streets in their city where is not secure  to go during night by domestic citizens. <br />The same story as in some parts of LA or some of the other cities in USA.<br />My sister was victim of attack in France at evening and they make attack on her car and many other people. Of course that generally and overall west Europe is secure and more secure than Afghan regions but I just highlighted that many people in western world though that girl in Afghanistan is very danger but some part of Afghanistan is secure with local person for her than some quarters in several west European cities.",Vladimir Zivkovic,2021-03-21T16:23:31Z,0
"Define what exactly what no go zones in Western Europe are - official definition and fact based - not your own opinion - and which specific areas you refer to. <br />Western Europe is not 1 single country.  <br /> <br />People throw around this no go zones opinions as some sort of truth.  <br />That has to stop. It’s made up, xenophobic, dishonest, racism. <br /><br />The overall safety across Western Europe is higher than in Kabul. <br />There are no refugees from Western Europe in Kabul but many thousands in Western Europe from Kabul. UN staff, embassy staff etc in Afghanistan aren’t allowed to move without armed protection in certain vehicles because it’s deemed to dangerous. <br />Any examples of the same across Western Europe?",Anna Kaunitz,2021-03-21T16:05:46Z,0

Don&#39;t call the Taliban &quot;terrorists&quot; ... they are freedom fighters... They haven&#39;t gone to America or any other western country but the Western troops are fighting in Afghanistan......... which implies &quot;Americans and the NATO forces are the real terrorists&quot;,Tauqeer Seafarer,2021-03-21T09:30:14Z,0

"Travelling in Afghanistan with Male guide it&#39;s not really solo travel? Isn&#39;t it? If its so so safe for a tourists as you suggest why you didn&#39;t explored city by yourself at some point? Low profile , going by a car to the specific safe areas. Soo fake!

"The Taliban are what was the Mujahudeen.  The term Taliban is an umberalla name for the resistance, made up of over 100 tribes/groups in Afghanistan.  These are ordinary Afghans, mostly villagers living in one of the most poorest countries on Earth, only defending their homeland and families.  To call it a terrorist organistion is a lack of knowledge and understanding of the history of Afghanistan.  However you are only going with the western narrative and as your vlogs have shown you have a great respect for all cultures and people across the world.

"Respected Lady, nice to see you in Afghanistan. You are talking about Talibans and calling them terrorists. I think you should understand that every religion/ country have its own customs and traditions. And also with in a country different people have different opinion, likings and dislikings. Same is the position in Afghanistan. You should also look into that the people who are with you and hosting  you, have failed to control the country since last 20 years , even they have full support of America and NATO. Because they are in minority and Talibans are in majority that is why USA got the point at the end that without involving the Talibans into the government of Afghanistan peace is not possible. By the way let ,e know you that I am an educated person from Pakistan (not from Afaghanistan) and I am against the policies of the Talibans, my country is also suffering from Talibans. But reality is after all reality we have to accept it. I hope my explanation will not hurt you, if so I do apologies, Regards",Abdul Qadir,2021-03-20T19:53:40Z,0

I heard that they have seen Afghanistan that this generation would dream to see. Cuz they had that tour that started in India and would end in Afghanistan. They would come in through Balkh to Kabul and end it Kandahar or Herat. It’s just a shame how it has changed now. Be we still have hope. 🙌🏻,Rasool Wardak,2021-04-21T19:25:15Z,0

"We visited a county in CA, a senior couple invited us for dinner. They said we heard from our neighbor (professor) there is a delegation from Afghanistan so we didn’t want to miss it inviting you for a good reason that when we were of age 20 and 17, we both visited Afghanistan and spent 23 days in villages of Afghanistan, we were welcomed by the villagers to their homes as guests. We were students, couldn’t afford the luxury stay in intercontinental, but we spent a week in Kabul in dormitory of American exchange program students/professor the rest was free stay in villages who didn’t know English at all but hosted us and a few days in house of a Jewish Afghan family. <br />Now at age of 79 and 76, We wonder how that nice culture been destroyed so badly, we found Afghans very welcoming,  liberal, and not religious in a peaceful country... they kept on telling the stories that I had only heard in books or from elders... sad that we lost everything",Angar Banai,2021-04-03T02:36:40Z,4

"Gul must take you to a Bolani shop.  The leeks of Afghanistan are like no other and their fried leek sandwich is always in my food dreams.  Afghan Kabuli is the national dish and is the best rice dish in the world.  Too bad you are vegetarian and will miss Afghan kababs.  It is also too bad you are missing  fruit season.  Except in eastern Jalalabad, it is too early for apricots in the north and too late for juicy pomegranates..Off season fruits are refrigerated now due to Western influences and do not have the flavor of  seasonal Afghan fruit.  Next trip to Afghanistan travel in grape, melon and mulberry season for total picnic joy in their gardens.  Try to find an old  copy of &quot;Caravans&quot; by James A. Michener...He remembers the sweetness of Afghan  melons and grapes of old but he does mix his seasons up to tell his story.  Please know, the Russians deliberately destroyed centuries old irrigation canals that watered Afghanistan&#39;s famous orchards in an attempt to achieve their genocide by starvation plans. Afghan agriculture is just now recovering from the left over unexploded Russian cluster bombs and landmines.  I am thinking wild red poppies will be blooming in Herat and the crocus harvest for saffron should be about now.   Please find an old copy of &quot;The Sewing Circles of Herat:  A Personal Voyage Through Afghanistan&quot;  by Christina Lamb.  Do praise the strenght of Afghan women.  Oh!

There is no extreme  strict version of sharia law. There is only sharia law and there is nothing to worry about it.<br />Sharia  is a law send by Allah. So Allah&#39;s law should be established. Don&#39;t try to spread false information &amp; don&#39;t try  to influence people by your derogatory western  culture where people walk  in half naked.<br />shameless.

"Taliban&#39;s followers are not terrorist, they are a few people who want to live in their own way like you do. You cannot say that they are wrong if they do not agree with your lifestyle. The way they live is not an extreme lifestyle, this is how their forefather taught them on how to live. I am very upset to hear the word &quot;terrorist&quot; came from you especially someone who had travelled around the world, who had watched so many cultures. We cannot expect people in Afghanistan live like Americans. You have no idea what is Sharia Law. Sharia Law is just a guidance for Muslim on how to live in this world as a true Muslim. Sharia is not only about cutting hand, taking revenge etc. Shariah is about how to live in this world by the book AlQuran and Sunnah.",shahri seman (BG),2021-03-20T14:31:58Z,0

"Hi Eva, I realise that your video shows Afghanistan in a more beautiful and truthful light than we are often portrayed. I know that was your intention too, and I respect that. <br /><br />However, the title and image you have used for the video do the complete opposite. You have chosen to use a montage of yourself - a Western woman - looking pensive and slightly concerned while two Afghan men look on behind you, the older man looking at you with a suspicious, angry, almost threatening look. You have then captioned the video with &quot;What am I doing here?&quot;, again suggesting that you are in a threatening situation that is not safe for a young woman to be on her own. Finally, the title emphasising that you are a &quot;Solo Female Traveller&quot;, again reinforces the stereotype that travelling alone in Afghanistan is fundamentally dangerous for a woman. Anyone who only sees the title and image, but doesn&#39;t watch the video - so a lot of people - will be left with that impression. <br /><br />I&#39;d argue that it&#39;s far less safe to be a solo female traveller in many Western countries, compared to Afghanistan.<br /><br />I watched the video because I have seen your videos and know that you are a warm, kind-hearted and tolerant person who would show Afghanistan and Afghan people in a truthful way. Your videos are inspiring, informative and fascinating. They don&#39;t need disingenuous titles and title images.",Jon McCarthy,2021-03-20T13:19:37Z,0

Eva i would really like to correct you here i am a huge fan of yours but here you said it wrong. Taliban are not terrorists. Taliban are the legitimate people and the government of Afghanistan even before the american invasion it was taliban government there and during the soviet war it was taliban who defeated the soviets with american help. And just because america is no longer friends with taliban does not make them illegitimate or terrorists.<br /><br />This comment is not to show any hatred towards eva i just want to tell her the truth.,Aakash Javed,2021-03-20T12:44:08Z,0

"I remember reading a book about two women travelling from Geneva to Kabul by car in the 1930s; one was Annamarie Swarzenbark and the other was Ella K. Maillart. They never had a problem with other people, they were both journalists and authors. There are many books about them, primarily printed in German. The history we are taught in school is highly biased, baby girls need to know that the world belongs to the brave and those who dare give humanity&#39;s consciousness the opportunity to expand.

If any terrorist organization wanted to gun this man down, they could easily plan to do it and have a crowd of tourists to bat as they’d be right there with him traveling and touring with him.

"It is so strange to see this little aspects of this country. In some way Afghanistan and the people are more free than our western country&#39;s. On the other side they are so absolutely unfree. It is a paradoxon. I mean they are all allowed to have their own shops, imagine having a bonefixer in Europe. I mean you can just build a house, on your own, with no building rules. Most of us are employed, it takes a lot to open a business, most families have their own shop in Afghanistan. On the other side they are hardly able to travel to the next village, have to fight for their lives, in the cities you only see men, women are ment to be in the house. To see this video was extrem beautiful and terrible at the same time. Thank you very much!",Second Sue,2021-03-20T11:16:08Z,2

I talked with some Muslims and they explained to me that what we hear about the talibans is also not true. Actually they have always tried to defend their country from being invaded and dominated by others. Many years ago there was a very simple leader (I don&#39;t remember his name) who lived humbly by Islamic rules and there was peace. <br />So sorry to see those beautiful birds locked in cages!,Sandra Carli,2021-03-20T11:13:31Z,0

Not only because of the sugarcoating in this video but also because of the 3 Afghani dudes that busted my lip and my face. I guess elevators are haram in Afghanistan, since that&#39;s what must have provoked them, me waiting for the elevator to arrive. <br />Such a nice and accommodating people, why? whats media saying about them?

"Did he tell you he was Hazara? What if he&#39;s Uzbeki, or Tajiki, or mixed? And his friend? Who was equally kind and open? And the hospitable shopkeepers? They didn&#39;t all look Hazara to me, but you are being vapid and shallow and bigoted... There are plenty of progressives of all races in Afghanistan, with capital A. Hazaras, with capital H are a wonderful tribe. Closed and open minds exits across tribes and cultures and langauges; please don&#39;t bring hate here where Afghans are finally able to celebrate their culture through the eyes of an outsider, instead of be sad.
