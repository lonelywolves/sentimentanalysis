@Oz what you are  saying is incorrect coz if Kurdish language is related to Farsi then it means it&#39;s related to Arabic as well coz if put out Arabic word then you can&#39;t talk a Farsi sentences correctly maybe you are saying this coz I think what you have heard is from East Kurdistan which they were forced to speak in Farsi so they got mixed with Farsi,Devil's of paradise,2019-12-17T10:52:34Z,0

"Just to correct your misinformation , the kurds in iraq dont usually allow women to fight ! They might have some few women who they let them participate for “showing off” its a very (male dominated ) especially DUOK who are villagers in comparison to slemani and to a lesser extent (erbil) , the kurds truly let women fight side by side to them but this is in Kurdish areas in turkey and in syria who are MUCH MORE open minded and liberal than the tribal kurdistan in iraq .

"Hey Eva I hope you take a time to read this comment it was really from the deep of my heart and really important for me...<br />I really love and respect your videos and the effort you put into them but as an Iraqi who lived all her life and still does in Baghdad I feel offended.. many western “travel” Youtubers lately have been coming to north Iraq (Kurdistan) and filming it in the prettiest way possible... We are the Iraqis who have gone through the worst kinds of wars and occupations for 30 years, but we are still a people who love life and love peace and when we see influencers like you have a large number of followers come to our beloved multi-spectrum country with a great and ancient history such as Babylon, Baghdad, Sumer and Nineveh.  They transmit a picture that is good for our fellow Iraqi Kurds, but it is a humiliating image and a cruel image of the Iraqi Arabs .... We residents of Baghdad and other cities we have gone through dark years, years of siege, years of war and years of occupations.  They are terrorists and ISIS, but in fact we have been oppressed ... for more than two decades.... by our dictatorship government and by major countries ... so please Eva with all the love in the world to you please next time when you visit Iraq at less mention “I’m not telling you to come to Baghdad” the kind of oppression our people have went through the 1.3 millon innocent Iraqis who got killed in 2003 by the US gov in the name of democracy! The Iraqi soldiers who also just like the peshmerga fought for our lands and country.. Iraq is wonderful,mysterious,diverse,ancient and full with love from Duhok to Basra please leave your politics views when you share the story of a country who is highly oppressed by the western media when most of your follows are westerns by that your only doing bad for Iraq’s reputation who is doing really bad for the last decades...<br />Thank you for taking your time to read this.

"Are you from USA, u can fly to Istanbul then fly to Erbil, or fly to Europe than to Erbil. Ignore the Arab and Turkish haters.",Kal Sulivani,2019-12-26T06:03:21Z,0
You can buy a plane ticket to Erbil and get a visa on arrival for free if your from a western country or certain country. I’m American and I live here also young like her but younger. I went to duhok last year we drove through turkey. Much easier to fly to Erbil. Syriaaaaa not so much not worth the risk with the new Turkish war.,coco marineblu,2019-12-19T13:24:52Z,0
@AD Vad exactly.  From the UK travel to Syria is on the banned list and travel though Turkey is illegal. You can expect to be detained on your return...unless you&#39;re a travel blogger with loads of YouTube videos to show authorities and being a pretty young polish girl helps. Male of military age a lot trickier,Andreas Victorious,2019-12-10T08:52:03Z,1
It shouldn&#39;t be difficult to get there with such well established &quot;support system&quot; as Eva has 😉,AD Vad,2019-12-10T01:19:06Z,2
