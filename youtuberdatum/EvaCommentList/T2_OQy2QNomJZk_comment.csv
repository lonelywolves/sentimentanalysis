"We too have plenty of grapes, everyone has grape vines. I&#39;m shocked the woman you&#39;ve been to didn&#39;t had grapes or maybe she did and you didn&#39;t see them? But just about everyone has grapes in their yard in Romania. Just a few people make &quot;sarmale&quot; with grape leafs though, because it&#39;s not so tasty. People usually consider sarmale tastier with cabbage leaf instead of grape leaf, including me. I don&#39;t like sarmale with grape leaf. As for headscarfs, I can give you a better explanation. Everybody in Europe wore them at some point, even Germans, French, everyone but they gradually removed them. It was part of modesty of a woman in Christianity but as people become less and less religious (which is very bad) they are removing these headscarfs and they are starting to show more and more skin, shorter dresses and so on which again is very BAD in my view. If Jesus was here now and you would ask him which woman He approves off, the modest one or the skimpy one? Guess what he would answer...",Daniel Maxter,2021-04-26T21:42:55Z,0

"What?!? I am so shocked. A country girl ashamed to be known as a country yokel? Don&#39;t worry, I get you. That beautiful land produced a beautifully sweet girl. I was born in a very small town in Indiana USA. Small towns linked together by roads. I never hid the fact of my background. I think I understood young that variety is the spice of life. We all dreamed of the day we would leave home. We coined a very prophetic phrase, &quot; in a town this small every road leads out of town&quot;. But later in life most of us dream of going back eventually. If you want an idea of my first 18 years watch the original Footloose movie with Kevin Bacon. Take stock of the people and the town.

"Hi, I have 2 questions for you. I&#39;m deaf and communicate mostly in American Sign Language and spoken English (you have to kind of understand me if you are to understand my speech). Would you find out whether there are deaf Romanians who use Romanian Sign Language? I am considering a trip outside of the USA and I would like to visit Romania to meet deaf people. The 2nd question is would you be able to find out if anyone breeds and raises Transylvanian hounds? I have catahoula dogs here that I use occasionally for wild boar hunting and while they&#39;re good for that, they are restless indoors and like to pick fights with each other. I see that the Transylvanian hounds aren&#39;t prone to picking fights with each other and seem to be rather chill indoors. I would love to talk to some breeders about that breed.

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQy2QNomJZk&amp;t=6m15s"">6:15</a> Actually in Romania it is also common to use grape vine leaves, and also different other sort of leaves. But usually grape vine leaves are used during the summer or autumn, but in the winter the leaves go off and they are not too common in the winter. Cabbage leaves are used because they are kept with salt over the winter.",Nicolae Bacrau,2021-01-21T08:04:00Z,0

"Eva, I am a Romanian man, and I can tell you that you chose exactly the heaven area of Romania. People in Maramureș are so pure, and friendly, you were immediately accepted as a family member. They are very diligent people, hard workers, their houses are always clean and ready any time for any guests. I am really impressed how you beautifully described this area of the Eastern Europe, thank you a lot for it. You just have to know that few people from France, or Belgium, or Holland or other Western Europe countries visited Maramureș once, and they were so impressed, that they sold their houses in their home countries, and moved forever to Maramureș. Some of them bought and restored old houses, and now they live there. There is no better description of Romania, than this one, I guess. All the best !",Prepper's Romania,2021-01-13T21:04:28Z,1

This video helped me to know how I want to live after I retire from my working life here in China. That village life is perfect for a single mature lady like me.

Eva I&#39;ve just discovered your wonderful work and I just love it! I fell in love with the Romanian country a while back when I saw the video of the very nice guy who literally walked from village to village just relying on the kindness of the people. Of course now I can&#39;t remember his name! But it struck a deep chord in me and I&#39;ve yearned for the same thing in my life. Your wonderful videos have made my desire even stronger. Thank you dear and keep up your wonderful work!,Kevin Lawrence Taylor,2020-12-28T01:09:11Z,6

"The concept of &quot;sarmale&quot; was brought to this part of the world during the Ottoman Empire occupation and that&#39;s why they are quite popular (in some way or another) all over E-Europe. The traditional romanian stuffing for sarmale is rice, diced onions and minced pork. However, in the south of Romania we also make them with grape leaves, stuff them with minced poultry and boil them in white wine (at least that&#39;s how my mother makes them). The ones you cooked in this video are &quot;sarmale de post&quot; meaning without meat, vegetarian.<br />Thank you for showing this!",Indy J,2020-12-22T09:53:18Z,1

"Both excellent production and excellent closing lines.  <br /><br />Though I am increasingly ashamed to admit it, I hold American citizenship, but have lived in Japan for about 38 years now.  While the metropolitan area is fairly Westernized in the worst neo-liberal corporate capitalist way, the country side of Japan is very similar to what you showed in this great video.  <br /><br />As a former college prof., I visited rural Cambodia with Japanese college kids for volunteer work with Cambodian teachers and kids.  And I found the rural Cambodians were so much like the counterparts of rural North Carolina were I grew up.<br /><br />From my observation of national politics, background in philosophy of science and math, and experience with authoritarian Japanese institutions ... I suspect there is something about the nature of our ability to reason that results in a zero-sum game between the empathy-driven morality of small communities (Dunbar&#39;s number or less), and the rule-driven (rituals, laws, and now algorithms) behavior of institutions.<br /><br />Homo Sapiens, at our best, thrive in communities.  <br /><br />At our worst, those who are genetically predisposed to be high in &#39;dark-triad&#39; behavior traits (the narcissists, machiavellian opportunists, and psychopaths among us) tend to see other humans as either &#39;herding primates&#39; or &#39;herded primates&#39; ... not &#39;social primates&#39; ... and no amount of good parenting or education will change their predisposition until they have destroyed those they touch, and finally bring about the destruction of our species.",Steve Martin,2020-12-04T07:33:27Z,0

"I, too, was born in a small town. My town is Stetson, Maine, USA. My Dad built our 2 story cabin. We had a well with a hand pump, to pump the water up out of the ground and we would heat it on the stove for everything that needed hot water. There were always salamanders hiding in the well. We had a shed for a workshop and the cow, pony, pig, and 2 goats also had a larger shed to live in. We cooked on an iron stove powered by wood. I miss toasting bread on that stove. The toast came off the top of that stove browned, but soft and it was so tasty that it didn&#39;t even need butter. This stove is also how we heated the place. We had an outhouse, outside of course, instead of a working toilet inside. We lived on a dirt road. We were poor, but we didn&#39;t realize it at the time.

"Perspective is an interesting thing. I grew up in a small village of 400 people by the coast in England but also not far from a bigger town. After leaving home I lived in London for a year and to be honest I realized it wasn&#39;t for me. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I have lived and worked abroad a lot and the last project I did was in Slovakia, in the Orava region which borders Poland. Slovakia and Poland are quite different, I would say Slovakia still has a real peasant mentality, and the food in general is not good, it is just stodge and not a lot of flavour. I was there for almost 5 years. Village life in east Europe is very insular, if you didn&#39;t grow up with them they will not be willing to make friends. Sure they are polite and will chat, but that is about the limit. <br /><br />I came back to the UK last year and once again in London and I love it. I hadn&#39;t realized how much I miss the energy and action of a city where things happen and there is always something to see.

"Eastern Europe is pretty much undiscovered and underrated in many respects particularly as a holiday destination. These village people have an incredible diet of food that you can only dream of getting in a city. I&#39;ve spent most of my life in London and I am now living in a small village in Lithuania. Fresh air, surrounded by lakes, forests, nature and wildlife. Food wise I can get all I need within 5 miles of our house including milk, cheese, eggs, lamb etc. We have a small orchard, home made cider, fresh fish and organic veg. It&#39;s hard work but when I think about people standing on a tube train I feel blessed. Great vlog Eva good luck with your channel.",Graham Wright,2020-11-16T16:10:08Z,0

"Eva, I am a Romanian man, and I can tell you that you chose exactly the heaven area of Romania. People in Maramureș are so pure, and friendly, you were immediately accepted as a family member. They are very diligent people, hard workers, their houses are always clean and ready any time for any guests. I am really impressed how you beautifully described this area of the Eastern Europe, thank you a lot for it. You just have to know that few people from France, or Belgium, or Holland or other Western Europe countries visited Maramureș once, and they were so impressed, that they sold their houses in their home countries, and moved forever to Maramureș. Some of them bought and restored old houses, and now they live there. There is no better description of Romania, than this one, I guess. All the best !",Romulus Milea,2020-10-24T22:25:00Z,323

"When I was a kid, me and my family used to go our native village and I miss that a lot now. You said something about &quot;sense of identity&quot;,  I know it can mean a lot to a person. Me personally have no idea what is it. I lost it a long time ago, when because of poverty and economic hardships, I had to leave Pakistan and moved to USA some 30 years ago. I am a US citizen but almost daily, someone asks me where do I am from. When I try to go back to Pakistan, I feel like a stranger since everyone I knew as a kid has moved and not there anymore.

"Eva such a beautiful video. It makes me so sad in a way however. Here in the US with our great land mass the system of Big Government has made every town large or small pretty much the same. What I mean is because of our ridiculous regulations on building code, road code....we have little freedom to live as we wish. In many states there are counties and cities that made it illegal to live off grid. Even many small tows have banned wood burning stoved. They have taken are distinct differences in culture and melted them together into a cookie cutter mold. <br />My family homesteads and lives part off grid but our cultur here in the US has been under attack for 30+ years. <br />I come from Polish and Germanic heritage. So much of what my great grandparents were and did is gone now.<br />In my home town when I was a kid we always has a paczki dance . Yes that is right lol. Polka music, lots of paczki donuts, drinks, fellowship and though types of cultural activities are gone now. So sad. I love your channel and use it to help homeschool my daughter. God bless you precious one, thank you so much.",Sustainable Stewards,2020-10-21T22:01:20Z,1

I&#39;m from Florida USA and watching your vlog about the small villages in Romania is so refreshing to watch their lives, with basic needs but so refreshingly natural.  The food, vegetables and fruits grown just a few steps away from their homes.  I&#39;m originally from the Philippines and I grew up in a small town in the province, and I miss that provincial life where food is good and natural and close to the people in the community.  Great vlog. Congratulations.",Q Gan,2020-10-21T00:46:51Z,20

And to me, looking at this village, it felt they have a connection with nature, with God, with themselves, through a very simple life. I want to live like this and I hope in the future more people will come back to living like this.

"I grew up on the countryside in Scandinavia, and life and food there did have similarities with what you see in this video. At lest back when I grew up.

"Maramure&#39;s Magical Simplicity of Life. So deeply in love with the warmhearted, victorious Vorica; feeling the raw, real love beaming out of her! Then lovely Lenuta with her dough clumps turning into beautiful bread filled with cheese and savviness. Ending with delightful Dan&#39;s Dacian clay clumps transmuting into Art from the Heart and Dana&#39;s delicious diner/lunch. I sense it is not all about external community, but first and foremost about our own communion with our inner voice of wisdom. Only from that internal alignment we are able to radiate our authenticity into the world and into our surroundings, no matter where we are.
