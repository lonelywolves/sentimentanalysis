You are literally partaking a dream experience that I wanna do...in Mongolia!!! I&#39;m so sorry that your horse spooked and thus the fall experience. Glad you didn&#39;t get hurt any worse. It took me several years to get back on a horse after falling TWICE!! and had to wear an arm cast for a month. I still love horses but I&#39;m always hesitant to ride long distance. Hope to get to Mongolia sometime soon!,Verna Yazzie,2021-04-22T04:21:09Z,0

"You should travel with 1 or more people, but if you cant find anyone to or just dont want to then do it with just your guardian angels n if you get into trouble pray to God for help or just ask Him out loud, i traveled alone many times, i hitch hiked, took plains, n buses, i hitch hiked thousands of miles a few times n hundreds a bunch of times, i camp out on the way most the time n most time had a sleeping bag n tarp as bedding, i been to alaska a few times n camped in woods there, one time a big brown bear started tracking me, but i was able to get on other side of mountain n he couldn&#39;t find me or pick up my scent anymore, but he moved very fast when he popped up to sniff my scent<br />I also fed bad eagles by hand in Alaska, there were flocks of them<br />I also saw bear fights at the dump in hoonah island<br />God helped me a bunch of times on my trips n that is who i mostly relied on for help<br />Woman take it more easy when bad things happen on trips, dont get so hurt emotionally n upset, bad things are going to happen at times, be bold n strong about it n keep a cool head n deal with it as wisely as you can<br />Also you can always take a day or two off n camp in one spot to let body rest n catch up on eating to give body more strength when you head out again",michael john,2021-04-20T00:22:53Z,0

"Hehe, the dual horses reminds me of my grandma. She was riding the horses down to my mom&#39;s so they could graze on her pasture (they switch every three to four months since my mom doesn&#39;t have horses on her farm yet and it helps keep the pastures from becoming overgrown). The last two, she saddled up one and had the other on a lead. Her boyfriend (who didn&#39;t know how good she was at riding) said she couldn&#39;t just ride one and lead the other down there. Grandma just smiled and said, &quot;Meet me down there.&quot; Rides off with TJ and with Buddy on the lead. So funny. Don&#39;t ever tell a woman in my family she can&#39;t do something! lmao",Magpie Online,2021-04-14T13:59:08Z,0

"I don&#39;t know you,  but I&#39;m so proud of you! Your journey and your strength spoke to my inner child- before I had too many horse accidents and concussions. At 61, I  do nothing bold or epic with my horses. At 61, I  realize that the biggest part of the journey is often the first step.  That is the step that gets you beyond being paralyzed with fear and into action. Rewind back to the beginning, when you were all packed and ready to go.  Then fast forward to where you got hurt.  You became a decisive  and self protected young woman. You made appropriate decisions for your survival. You did not just crumble and wait for someone to come find you.  You took charge.  Your experience will make you into a better leader... You will he unstoppable. Job well done in my book!!!",A Be,2021-04-07T23:44:25Z,0

"Having done numerous solo treks (either back packing, or motorcycling camping) throughout  the US, or Canada,  I can relate to the solitude. Although it was nothing like what you experienced in Mongolia! Such courage! Being alone for weeks at a time, and overcoming any setbacks alone, will teach you much about yourself. (Although I would recommend a helmet. It&#39;s saved my head several times). As I watched this, the phrase that popped into my head was &#39;What doesn&#39;t kill us, makes us stronger&#39;.

I hope some day my sons and daughters will take a chance and do one of these like you have. I think it will show them their strengths, weakness, skills, limits, vulnerabilities, decision making abilities, learning when to say yes and no, learning to respect nature and animals and most importantly other humans and cultures.

"I love that you felt horses gave you peace, serenity - that they are  healing. I have been riding since age 12. Training them and psychologically healing/helping horses for 25 years. Working specifically with abandoned and abused horses, or sometimes with someone&#39;s horse that that suddenly develops a dangerous behavior. I had 4 concussions before age 20. None since because I wore a helmet. I wasn&#39;t able to see if your hat had any protective properties. I hate wearing helmets. Riding with them some how lessens the experience, certainly.  But you were alone. I hope if you trek again, I hope you  choose to wear some head protection.

"2 years ago me and my 2 brothers went on a trek across Mongolian wildlands, serious drought caused this 7 day 260 kilometer trek including our 1500 livestock, greatest dangers were wolves, bandits, snake and fogs, climbing on mountains like Afghanistan on horseback clearly tested our mentality and physical endurance but we made 3 of us and all 1500 livestock came to the rendezvous point safely. Beautiful video.",turo navyblue,2021-03-17T10:08:32Z,40

"&quot;Sometimes it is due to a breakup that we get the Courage &amp; Time, to set off on a long journey of Solitude.&quot; <br /><br />That just popped up in my mind as I was watching your video. I can totally relate to your journey Eva, cos I did something similar in 2001 when after my own breakup, I just decided to do a solo bike ride around Peninsular Malaysia. I covered around 2,300km over 10 (out of 11) states and took about 14 cycling days. <br /><br />I was not as isolated as you out in Mongolia as I was traveling along the country borders. But I can identify with the Solitude that you had mentioned, when I had to deal with any problems that arose (like getting lost, or having my rear wheel damaged on the last day). <br /><br />Баярлалаа/Thank you for sharing Eva &amp; I&#39;m glad that you knew when to exit when it got a bit too harrowing during your solo trek. :D",franz1c,2021-02-22T14:20:36Z,0

I can give you some advice as mongolian who once lived in mountain for 3 month. through the comment its not enough to help you but ill try.<br />At 1st: you dont need 2 horses. Just one is enough for few days. <br />2nd: your packages are too heavy<br />3rd: you need gun or something like that to just make sound to fear the wolves. <br />4th: rain storms are not dangerious enough to make you go back or change the route in Mongolia. <br />5th: let the horse know that you are the boss. <br />thats it through the comment. i hope it can help you. at last i wanna say that you are very brave girl you did 100% you can do. i hope your next travel can finish where you want. Do 200% you can do. Goodluck!,Khan Dul,2021-02-12T13:00:14Z,0

"These lands in fact are the motherlands of first nomadic Turkic tribes. To those first Turks, horses literally meant everything. All men, women and kids used to live on their horses for their entire life. Horse milk and horse meat were among their primary foods along with the other things they&#39;d prey. I believe that&#39;s why they were so strong and formidable for their Roman adversaries when they finally started to move towards the western lands.",Burak Dümer,2021-01-24T11:57:55Z,0

"@Miss C Wolves and bears are in a lot of countries. Every time I used to travel in the Polish and Slovakian Carpathian Mountains with a few people, the owner of the horses used to sleep next to the fully opened window, next to where the horses were (During the nights at shelters), just in case they run away due to the wolves attack. I still find her very brave, lonely travelling is risky. If you travel with at least a second person you always know they might try to help you (give you the first aid and etc.).<br />Now, I really miss those few days trips to the mountains on the horseback. After pandemics, I surely will try to get back to those.",Srebny Wilczek,2021-04-02T10:35:56Z,1

"When one is alone without electronic distractions they begin to see who they really are as a spiritual being and if they like who they are. That is why most do not seek solitude, especially without electronic distractions. They don&#39;t want to know who they really are. It is easier to be around other people and to blame them for one&#39;s own shortcomings. It is an eye opener for sure to try and spend two weeks alone, even in what seems to be a Mongolian paradise. But when it is over some spiritual growth and understanding oneself is achieved so the difficulty of the experience is always worthwhile.",Samual Crocket,2021-01-11T04:32:20Z,1

It is dangerous, I&#39;ve had many falls that could have ended very badly if not for the protection gear. I would never refuse to wear a helmet while riding, especially alone in some remote areas like this.

"Wow you are most brave hearted woman i&#39;ve ever seen. Mongolia is known as a wildness of nature. But i just thought that what if things gone wrong. In wild Mongolia, we have wolfs, bears, and other wild animals. Just glad you did not face this animals during your journey in the middle of nowhere. And i can&#39;t mention the spirits of wild natures. We believe that big mountains and rivers have their owner which is spirit and ghost and something like that. And they do not like strangers. They have strange, scary looks. For example A very very huge deer with human face, or bird with red bloody legs and also can speak in human language. I know this sounds strange and also up to religion. If i were you,foreigner woman alone with 2 horses, in wild nature, middle of nowhere, sleeping alone, i just can not sleep at night thinking all this scary things haha.

"Eva, you are amazing and I have been looking into doing solo travel myself and as a female, I have had some concerns about traveling solo. I have seen some other people&#39;s travel experiences, although you are the first solo female traveler that I have come to find, love, and respect. Through watching and hearing about your experiences, I am feeling so much more confident, and so much more prepared and organized in my head about my future plans. I am not a blogger although I love traveling, I love outdoors, cultural experiences, and trying new food, recipes, and meeting all types of unique people and personalities. Thank you so much for sharing your many experiences! Maybe one day in the distant future we might run into each other. I do plan to begin traveling occasionally in the near future once travel restrictions lighten up. I&#39;m considering Pakistan as my first and I have been practicing Urdu even though many Pakistanis speak English as well, but it never hurts to understand the language and culture where your travels will be. Besides that, I&#39;ve wanted to be an interpreter since I was a young child, although even at 47 years of age I remain fluent in only my native language, American English, haha. I really LOVE your adventures! I smile, laugh, and cry in many of your videos! Thank you!!! &lt;3",Kendra Pierce,2020-12-19T17:29:08Z,0

"Eva, You are such an inspiration to all generations, especially females. All females around the world are told or they think they are not strong enough to follow their hearts and do what their hearts yearn for .... the freedom to chose to do without conflicting pressure from their families etc. You are wise beyond your earthly years. You are an Old soul. A beautiful soul, the beauty radiates from within. It is impossible NOT TO feel Happy, Joyful, Strong, Beautiful apart from feeling inspired no mater what age, gender, cast, ...etc, one is, by seeing your light, your adventures, your love for life, your kindness, beauty and compassion. i also love, admire, and respect your authenticity, your true nature, your talk and walk hold integrity. I especially recognize and respect  you for showing and sharing your rawness, your vulnerability, your struggles as well as your triumphs. Many are so consumed in their rush to go somewhere, be somebody, do things round the clock, that they forget to slow down, stop and feel who they are or see themselves reflected in Nature. The True Mirror, The Healer, The Giver. So keep being who you are, and doing what you are doing in nature and sharing with others. It is good to remember who we are and recognize we are an integral part of the Whole and  that there is beauty all around us.  I wish you all that you wish for and please continue to inspire and uplift others around the world by simply being YOU. Sending lots of love, light, healing. May you always be loved, as you love others, be protected, guided, guarded, blessed and healed. Soha. Aho.",Iromee Gale,2020-12-09T03:52:09Z,0

"Buck up my dear. Don&#39;t be discouraged.  You did fine.<br />  As a life long cowboy and horseman (72 yrs old) who has worked alone on horse back most of my life, raised 3 girls on horses and still rides alone almost every day running a ranch in the Arizona mountains,  with both saddle horses and pack mules; what you experienced was nothing unusual.  Falls and concussions are part of every horseman&#39;s life,  but can be devastating none the less.  I was nervous for you through the whole video.<br />  Next trip, perhaps, let&#39;s look to our equipment a bit better. Every horse culture has their own systems of saddles and packing. They all work and I&#39;ve seen many I respect but Solid, heavy straps of sound leather never hurt anyone.  The Amish have a saying that goes;  &quot;A big barn and a fat wife never did any man harm.&quot;   Think economy but strength and quality.<br />   You might study up on breaking a pack animal to lead better too.  A balky pack horse that pulls back like that can kill you or pull away and run off with all your gear and food.  There are tricks  to solving that. It takes some time and practice with your animals before you  leave though.<br /><br />     Your photography was fantastic and I envied your trip.  I have always wanted to go to Mongolia.  I hope you do it again.      ;~{)  <br />Rick Taylor, Santo Nino Ranch,  Patagonia AZ. USA",Rick Taylor,2020-12-08T05:46:20Z,0

Since the begining of tge video could see you had some &quot;stumbling blocks&quot; showing that u shouldn&#39; t  have gone. God is doing that to show us we are on the wrong track. As an exemple i kindly recomand if you are willing to read: Exodus 14:23-25 and Numbers 22: 21-33. For me personaly, I learn to see that, in a situation, if I don&#39;t have peace about it or if I doubt and I have many obstacles, means I shouldn&#39;t go there or I should&#39;t do that🙂 I am happy you got home safe.",A.S,2020-12-07T20:02:17Z,0

"Eva - what a beautiful movie and experience you created! Thank you for sharing. Be proud of yourself see it as achievement! Amazing what you did and wanted to do and it needs a lot of courage. It made me travel back to my similar adventure in Mongolia! In 2003 I did a 10 days trek in the region Mountain and Lake Hovsgol. I was not that brave like you to do it solo. A Mongolian 70-years old guide came with me.  Originally I wished doing it solo, but luckily that didn&#39;t happen. We shared without being able to comunícate verbally those 10 days together with 3 horses. We came into a snowstorm, rain, rode in yellow arch forest as it was autumn , crossed many rivers ate bread, dried goatmeat and nutella for 10<br />days... It was a lifechanging moment with the same awakening like you of how unimportant I am and that I am a part of this short lifespan in a huge context we can&#39;t even grasp, or maybe it&#39;s to simple to understand. I learned humbleness. Unconditional hospitality from<br />any nomad family, and that even if you can&#39;t comunícate you understand each other and wherever you are, humans connect regardless your origin. You inspired me<br />to take my cassettes of my camcorder (year 2002) and finally edit what I filmed. My 2 month mongolian travel is all filmed and I have not looked at my footage yet, it&#39;s all in my memories. I might be disappointed as I am a complete amateur. So I would need more courage to look<br />at them than the<br />journey itself. 😂! Keep<br />doing what you do Eva!",Cecile Adam,2020-11-01T13:33:20Z,4

He was a very nice and smart guy having studied in Hungary. This vlog remembered me of him though his name I can&#39;t recall anymore becoz of Mongolian name which is hard to pronounce. This lady in this vlog believes in the beauty of nature and the goodness of man. She was not worried at all of bad people like rapist,  murderer, holdaper, thieves and serial killers.  She believes on good guidance of angels.",Reflexes Arguelles,2020-10-16T10:43:27Z,28

"I love your filming, editing and music. I think everyone should prepare at different stages to do a solo. Its a great experience. My longest was 3-months with half in the Sahara Desert. It&#39;s worth every moment, but you know what your limit it. When on a solo and you do not see anyone, as you say &quot;no other soul&quot;. But in reality you find and get to know yourself and your own soul. I felt for you. You brought tears to my eyes. My heart felt for you. Sometimes a solo, especially a challenging one, if best done when one is emotionally ready. If not sometimes its not the right time. You did well. You knew what your limit was and made the right decision. When you make that decision to return. Is a return for that time in that situation. There will be many other opportunities.

Even the tough experience is part of the journey and I think whatever giants you needed to face that led you to the trek were faced during that 5 hour walk after your 2nd fall. Thank you. This is so inspiring. I can&#39;t wait for your next one.

"eccomi, scusami tanto se ci ho messo molto ma ero occupata con mia madre,<br />in primis parto ringraziandoti per esserci stata (magari non sempre ma almeno la maggior parte delle volte) ed io non posso più che esserne grata, davvero. Ti ringrazio per riconoscere quando mi sento trascurata e tutto il resto.<br />Per ovvie ragioni, spesso e sempre mi è capitato di litigare con mia madre ma non che questo avesse a che fare con chissà che cosa, semplicemente non siamo mai state d&#39;accordo su alcuni argomenti ed io non soni stata d&#39;accordo su alcuni suoi ragionamenti che non ti sto qui ad elencare, ma è successo che in questo ultimo periodo (stra importante ma allo stesso difficile) della mia vita mi sto &#39;riscoprendo&#39; e sto valorizzando moltissime cose, sto riscoprendo l&#39;amore che c&#39;è stato tra me e mia mamma fin da piccolina e che solo ora sto capendo che è da sempre esistito, questa è la ragione per la quale io stia passando moltissimi momenti con lei SENZA scordare ovviamente mio papà, anche se penso che sia lui dietro tutto questo e mi fà strano che non sia geloso di lei, ma questo è semplicemente amore dove non c&#39;è né possessione nè gelosia, cosa che sto cercando di imparare da questi due miticoni per sapere a cosa vado incontro,<br />per sapere se si tratta di infatuazione quando per esempio vedo un bel ragazzo e ci parlo o se sento di non volere stare un minuto lontana da quella persona (david), difatti mi è molto difficile convivere con questa cosa ma lo faccio ugualmente perché per me Amore significa questo.<br />Ho parlato con i miei genitori riguardo l&#39;autolesionismo e non mi hanno semplicemente aiutata ma molto di più, soprattutto per avermi consigliato di portarmi in un centro di &quot;cura&quot; (mi imbarazza dirlo e letteralmente non racconto mai nulla di me per determinate ragioni) e mi sono sentita meglio, non dico di avere al 100% superato questo problema ma sicuramente in questi ultimi 3-4 mesi io non ho mai visto e sentito la felicità coi miei occhi e sulla mia pelle, solo a pensare a quelle giornate di merda in cui mi chiudevo in bagno e mi tagliavo mi lacrimano gli occhi e credo che l&#39;unica ragione è perché io mi facessi pena, o perché vedevo che nessuno mi aiutava nonostante sapesse che cosa stessi passando.<br />Per quanto riguarda la Spagna e tutta la mia famiglia a me manca molto ogni singola cosa,<br />mi fa strano che io avessi un ragazzo e chiunque potrebbe pensare che fosse una storia estiva ma non è così, tutt&#39;ora parlo con lui e mi capita di sentire una specie di nodo alla gola quando mi parla e mi dice cose che con nessuno potrei mai provare certi sentimenti, per questo devi scusarmi se io e te ci stiamo trascurando, sicuramente e senza dubbio io ho fatto la mia parte, non lo nego e mi dispiace.. Però davvero ho passato momenti della mia vita che non ho raccontato a nessuno e che nemmeno a te ho mai raccontato, sto riscoprendo vecchie amicizie, sto rivedendo in questi giorni da un posto a un altro alcune persone che hanno voluto vedermi e parlarmi, è strano da dire, sono persone che una volta avrei potuto considerare &quot;nemiche&quot; ma che non ho mai esitato a farlo perché tu mi conosci e sai che non lo farei mai,<br />io per davvero vorrei che non ti sentissi presa in giro quando ti dico che per davvero non ho molto tempo, non è un &#39;no non ci vedremo&#39; ma è &#39;un abbi pazienza&#39; perché ogni cosa ha il suo momento, perché io ho sto veramente passando molto tempo con molte persone anche se sui social potrei veramente non pubblicare nulla, ciò è perché non è nella mia persona ultilizzare troppo il telefono e i social a meno che io non senta di dover parlare con un amico, tutto qui, ci sono momenti in cui mi piacerebbe veramente cancellarmi da ogni piattaforma perché non sento di vivere la vita vera, per il semplice fatto che non tutto è solo social e basta e che esistono moltissime altre cose da fare.. Che altro da dire, mi manca mia nonna, mi manca quando una volta (non so se te l&#39;ho raccontato ma non credo) aveva dato il pesce avanzato a due gatti randagi, letteralmente mi hanno fatto provare un emozione unica se non rara, strano da dire e difficile da credere ma non ho dubbi sul fatto che anche tu sia molto sensibile su certe cose e ti toccano profondamente certe azioni..<br />Mia mamma mi sta facendo moltissima pressione perché qui si sta mettendo in gioco il mio futuro, anche se si parla di un anno, vuole che io le dica al più presto se me la sento di continuare in Spagna, dove lì ho ricostruito praticamente tutto, dove c&#39;è il ragazzo dei miei sogni (e riguardo a lui per quanto possa conoscerlo temo mi proponga di &quot;farlo venire&quot; e studiare qua ma se proprio scegliesse di fare una cosa del genere vorrei che capisse quanto potrà essergli difficile la scuola con una nuova lingua.. ma spero proprio si tratti di una mia paranoia anche se non credo), continuando il discorso, dove ho camminato su certi marciapiedi che vorrei &#39;risentire&#39; sotto ai miei piedi, io con la scuola sto affrontando un periodo abbastanza duro considerando che ci sono delle rette da pagare purché io ci rimanga.. ma il punto è che devo decidere, o qua o là, la scuola sicuro non aspetta, questo è il problema di mia madre, se io decidessi di andare in Spagna lei nemmeno per un minuto mi lascerebbe lì da sola, quindi si tratta anche del lavoro di mia madre,<br />io davvero perdonami se senti che ti stia evitando o che comunque non voglia passare una giornata con te, è veramente il contrario e ti chiedo scusa per le volte in cui comunque magari non mi sono aperta nei tuoi confronti e non ti ho raccontato molte cose della mia vita ma soprattutto scusami se ti ho trattata male per la storia del visualizzare, come hai detto prima nell&#39;audio la cosa non ti dà fastidio e non ti annoia ma se io avessi una persona che con me facesse questo io non le direi di stare tranquilla, poi magari per davvero non ti ha dato fastidio ma io nel frattempo mi scuso con te e per quanto ti voglia bene ti chiedo semplicemente di avere un po&#39; di pazienza nei miei confronti, (se non ne hai) fiducia e magari fissami in alto in chat che non è una brutta idea, a parte gli scherzi davvero spero tu comprenda tutto ciò anche perché sei la mia conchiglia e se non ti regalo le conchiglie raccolte sono una deficiente, scusami davvero tanto e ti amo",billiefannn eilish00,2020-09-15T20:54:06Z,0

Or the  long-leverage bite whit which &quot;the best rider she has ever seen&quot; was ripping off the horse&#39;s mouth?

I&#39;ve seen many girls asking why they can&#39;t travel. Many attribute it to fear which is understandable in this world. So seeing Eva is a wonderful example to what a female travelor can achieve she should be used as an example...Her vlogs in themselves are tips on how a girl could travel safely alone and psychologically conquer the places she goes to. No dream isn&#39;t on the wall anything is achievable. ❤️❤️,Barrow. A. Malik.,2020-09-10T02:46:59Z,224

"As a Mongolian, i don&#39;t think women should be encouraged to travel alone in the steppe. You will more likely encounter pesky wolves instead of horny men. Wolves are much smarter than dogs and can tell apart men from women, young from old. Besides physical dangers, there are also paranormal zones where horse stops for no apparent reason, ears buzzing or feeling of being watched etc.<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: Polish woman has been travelling alone for so long...meanwhile two Scandinavian feminists got beheaded shortly after arrival.<br />If you are a feminist from western or &quot;progressive&quot; society, better not travel alone abroad. Your frequency will attract violence.",SWANSON,2020-12-23T16:31:59Z,13

Mongolia my dream..,Vijay Goromba,2020-09-06T06:37:27Z,2
"Beautiful trip...but about the falling off, why no helmet? The wild is wild so this is the way stuff can go down. Personally I would have given a lot of thought to all safety concerns including a helmet, and a better saddle since that is essentially your steering wheel. Although it is entirely possible to ride bareback in a pinch so that is another way to do it. I also would have brought a bow and arrows. Nothing super crazy, but just so you have something else to use as a tool for whatever in addition to a weapon. I know many people would suggest a gun, but I would probably opt for a flair gun. Seriously, it’s all idyllic and bravely independent but, perhaps it’s my age speaking here, I would never be so caviller to journey without a way to protect myself and my horses. There’s so much that can quickly go wrong and she is extremely extremely lucky to only have knocked her head like she did. An inch and a half towards the outside of that same area and she maybe would be dead. Helmets are obnoxious but they save your life. <br />I’m not sure why she felt like this was something that she shouldn’t share with the world, it’s absolutely stunning how beautiful and green and just sublime that part of Mongolia is. There was no failure in her trip. She made absolutely correct decisions about not pushing the horses or herself into unnecessary situations, which is emotional intelligence; basically wisdom. It’s the adventure and the journey along the way, not the completion of a predetermined route which is the success. I hope she gets to do that again. People judge themselves too harshly pretty much all the time. I wish her luck in all of her travels and adventures. The world needs more people who are willing to have a dream and then attempt to make it happen. Bravo! 🥰💗🦋",Hera Hagstoz,2020-09-06T01:15:32Z,1

"I lost interest in life when quarantine began, I didn&#39;t go out with friends or meet with anyone except my parents( I&#39;m living with them), since March. Over 6 months now. And felt depressed and low energy during this period, but when I saw your video, like just by hearing the horse&#39;s hoofbeats, it gave me hope and I remembered who I am, a true adventurer. I always dreamed of doing something like this since I was a child but when I grew up (I&#39;m still 17) I just stopped thinking about things like this and I became more normal and average. Now I&#39;m seriously planning on doing something like this and discovering once again my true identity.

"If you have to tie a horses legs to each other I wouldn&#39;t even consider a track like this. It could go terribly wrong , if they freak out because of something and try to run away they will break their legs.

There are so many times were the thought of disappearing and go on an adventure similar to what you went through Do you come to my mind and those times the only happiness I can see is doing that like just disappearing. So far I didn’t manage to be that great friend to go on and do it in like just take the jump and risk it. Watching your video make me feel like I’m not the only one feeling what I feel horse riding and feeling what I feel when riding a horse.  I just want to let you know that your video made me cry a lot because I feel so identify with you I can’t believe it. And I also want to tell you how brave you are you got so far on your own, I don’t think I could be able to do half of what you did.

Amazing adventure. I was planning a 3 day 2 night trek with my horses this fall on my 200acre property. The thing that scares me the most are the predators. I need to get over this fear and I feel like being at one with my horses will help me get over it. Ever since I have kids my fear has grown. I don&#39;t want my kids to live in fear. So hopefully I can show them that mom is strong and there is not reason to be scared. Anyways. Wish me luck lol,Quebec Homestead,2020-08-21T13:09:30Z,1

@Soubuyana it wasn’t even a joke??? I genuinely meant it Mongolia would be perfect because it has massive areas of wilderness and is the least densely populated country in the world.

"I admire your courage. I know how to ride a horse since my childhood time. I always wanted to travel somewhere in a horse, but I never had that courage to take the first step. I really enjoyed watching your video. I am planning to travel in a horse, but I probably won&#39;t do it alone. I am hoping my husband will support me. <br />Although, I have traveled across 9 states in US in a rental car for 8 days, before I had kid and a husband.  I felt like that was the life changing eye opening trip I have ever done. I feel like once you start a family it becomes harder to things alone. You start to have responsibilities, not just for yourself but for others. Therefore, I really recommend for single people to start doing what they have always dreamed.",Bolorchimeg Jargalsaikhan,2020-08-17T00:55:26Z,2

WOW what an amazing chapter  !!!!!!!!   Loved to see it and wanted to thank you so much for sharing. I think that your attempt plan and execution are amazing and the only thing that I could think about towards the end is something I always used to hear from my late wise loved Mom - always look at the full half of the glass .................     So you planed 14 days and did half of that........... so you planed to get to the lake and instead landed up somewhere else.......   SO WHAT................... ???    really...     ??    I am a commercial certified very experienced Skipper that has been asked many times to do international delivery of sailing yachts from one country to another and do you know how many times there have been changes in mid ruts - schedule&#39;s due to developing weather conditions change or other considerations that demanded flexible mind thinking and  adapting to the new conditions .....   ???  Many many times !!! and that is the exact responsibility to yourself and those that you are in charge of to make the right decision to bring everybody healthy and safe home - and you made the right decision  !!!   So feel proud and strong with one more building  experience and don&#39;t be to hard on yourself in the future.......   You Deserve better.. :)))),mark merkel,2020-08-15T12:42:31Z,0

"Love the idea, but not the animal abuse. A 7 days travel with a beautiful vieuw and horses to carry you hours and hours. The Ropes on their feet while they graze are preventing them from escape, but what if they got scared and want to flee. They wear a wrong and painfull bit. The man who learned you how to ride, was a horribel rider and not at all respectfull to the horses, tradition doesn&#39;t make abuse OK. The saddle did not provide enough support to the horses back. I hope the hoofs were in good shape and the horses got the right nutrition, horses in the wild seek the right food and don&#39;t have a heavy human on their back. I believe you did not have a bad intent and simply did not know beter. Hope you educate yourself when you do something like this again.",Sanne Dijkhuis,2020-08-12T21:59:42Z,0

"Personally, i love the Mongolian wilderness. Even though i’m not used to big spaces, but the imagining of being alone with nothing bothering you just makes you feel like going for it. I am From Mongolia myself but never experienced this kind of stuff and watching you traveling like this in my country is just heartwarming. I am way too young to experience this type of traveling for now but when it’s time that I’m capable of myself I’ll definitely do this for sure. To me alone traveling through big wilderness is petrifying but after watching this i feel like i can do it even though it’s a big challenge.",Mocxa,2020-08-12T03:45:44Z,4

"I know we do it very differently in europe and traditional horseriding has its grossly abusive sides (thank god for decent horsemanship) but I always wonder if the mongolian horses were trained to do this sort of thing. Normally when you go trekking, it takes months to prepare your horse to make sure nothing happens. Other than that, the tie ups around the legs.... no. I couldn&#39;t.

Thank you for publishing this video. What a beautiful country and people.  It is very inspirational and motivating to see a woman understand her fears but continuing with her journey.  Yes it is not always safe traveling along however you followed your instincts and knew when to move forward and when to stop and return back.  I think fear stops us from doing so many things.  Sometimes its other people&#39;s fear that we accept as our own and believe the fear.  We are more capable than what we think we are.  I am no longer with my man and now its time for me to travel on my own.  I hope I have the same strength as you to travel alone.,Exploring California,2020-08-10T04:19:13Z,1

Single handedly to shoot those drone shots setting aside ones fears and managing 2 horses with other challenges of navigation  takes whole lotta winners mindset. Add to the beautiful landscapes; the emotional journey u took us along in the video is a job well done. Honestly i m tired of the influencers these days.

"Nah, they dont name horses out of pragmatism, to not attach themselves to them. Horses were their livelihoods, tools of survival and weapons. They didnt have the luxury to attach themselves to particular animal. Same reason why the only people who ate horses were the asiatic horse nomads.",Mittag,2020-08-03T21:45:20Z,0

"Anyone else riding horses or owning one kinda annoyed/scared/tired of people not wearing a helmet? I kniw I&#39;m nit picking, but there is a reason why helmets are mandatory for motorcyclists and should be for horse riding aswell.

Why don&#39;t horses run away,Pharoah Akhenaten,2020-08-02T21:26:54Z,0
"It absolutely breaks my heart that I can&#39;t afford to ride anymore. I&#39;m just wild about horses and going crazy in my mind that I can&#39;t find a way to be with them and ride them anymore. It used to be my freedom! Now I feel restless without them. They truly bind all of your emotions together and make you feel whole again. They give you something no human could ever provide. An indescribable feeling of.... if you&#39;ve ridden before, you finish that sentence!<br /><br />I wish I could just smell that hay again, feel the wind in my face and let my hair down whilst letting my horse run wild. Feel the warm horse breath on my hand and smell the bitter sweet horse food as I mix it, muck out and clear the fields, hear the soft nicker of welcome as I arrive back at the stables. <br /><br />🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎🐎<br /><br />This was so awesome, but bitter sweet for me. But your courage and commitment and determination are all beautiful characteristics that few people use these days. I love and greatly admire that you did it alone.

"Chicken Nuggets...look for a small non profit like mine. Rescues and horse sanctuary places would be happy to have you come out, groom horses, muck stalls and help ride. I have six horses here, but only one butt (mine)..I cannot keep up with the riding and I have a full time job to boot, so I have to pick a few to keep tuned up, the rest are pasture ornaments in my sanctuary. I don&#39;t mind and the horses certainly don&#39;t mind, but it would be sweet to get some help, especially a person that is passionate about horses...so check around.",FarmGirlRebel,2020-08-07T00:09:50Z,11

"I think this video showed brilliantly that when we are confronted with the wilderness of nature alone, we get to know how weak and helpless we are. Many people tend to think that nomadic people are just very care-free - living with that beautiful nature without any worries unlike stressful city life. But I gotta say that it is freaking “hard” to live there, to live in a remote place where you can’t find a single soul if you get lost. That is why even the Mongolian nomadic people depend on each other hugely to survive there, especially during the harsh winter. Their life is not care-free, but is based on a small yet strong community, and strict rules so that they can survive. For me, this wilderness of Mongolia is often cruel, but also it is astonishingly beautiful.",Gankhuyag Tengisbold,2020-08-02T17:11:23Z,0

A different road taken. Life is hard, often painfully so, either physically, mentally, or emotionally.

"Final word it’s so stupid and too brave to go there all alone without hunting gun and very clever decision you head back :) it’s like you climb Mount Everest without your team. There is only few people get there all alone with horse, they are hunters and they know the all places to safe stay and water resources and wild animal behavior so on.. they travel for hunting without gps and map they know all mountains shape and name as well. Hunters go there autumn thin water starts freeze, so all muds are freeze easy and faster to get there. Khag lake have so many fishes, you can just trow some ham to water see fish boiling. Luckily i had my fishing rod and caught some fishes for soup and so natural fish taste is unforgettable, it makes you sleep all day charges you energy to go back to civilization ;).  I’m 100% sure you will try again and found a lake. You lucky if you stuck your horse in the mud you alone can not take him out the mud, you need to kick your horse to try harder to get out, horse easy loose strength in the mud after while go deeper and only choice is you leave him. It’s so heart breaking point you cannot maybe handle, way back you load all things in one horse and have to walk all way back. If two horses stuck you have low chance to survive, walking takes twice more time and stamina to go back and luggage horse just forget... if you get lost no one will find you. I think you had satellite phone right? Don’t say no Lol okay Good-luck to your next successful trip and enjoy with a lake get some unique energy.. cheers",Bolor Tsogtbayar,2020-08-01T19:54:03Z,0

"I have so long story about the lake and pictures. My estimation maybe 50,000 people was been there since this century starts. It’s not common tourist destination and only challengers can make it except 1,000 people was there with helicopters it’s cheat lol. It’s inspiring place one of the world’s hidden vault. I feel your turning point head back, when you come closer to lake you feel very much depression also horses do, group of people hiking tour they argue each other while that time heavy thunderstorm or rains suddenly it’s very interesting. My first try we do hiking 70km half way (9km from lake) all this natural obstacles mountain mud forest up hill crossed and i clearly remember that day 19 years ago, it was <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKD30jCDBzI&amp;t=16m00s"">16:00</a> we lost the route and thundering starting rain everyone is depressed argue with routine (we didn’t have gps hand drawn old map) then we decided to head back because of limited food supply also that year bear food low year you know it happens some year natural fruits not growing well so dangerous for bear attack. Hiking cargo weight is limited, on the way we left some foods for reserve for return also loose weight of luggage road is hard even walking our shoes was tearing some part and leg was bleeding. Last day we have not eat 36 hours only water and reaches first Ger family, some of my friends was crying Lol. You know or not I don’t know here is one story: communist time there was only one wooden house by lake Mongolian communist party leaders go there by helicopter few times a year and they placed few soldiers there to protection. One time they fly there and they found some dead body parts and some soldiers was missing no signs only some blood and body left overs. Since that happened they have not go there again, it was bears attack or wolf we don’t know soldiers had enough gun and ammunition but they have not fire single bullet. Something suddenly attack and all run different directions without gun and died.

"If someone tries to go Khag Black lake by walking or horse trekking sometimes fail, which is good lake challenging you, it challenges the person must be there and after failure lake will call you until you get there or someone just thinking about that lake whole life not get there or don’t try anymore. When you get there your life will be changed pretty much somehow, you gonna be came back very tired of course and after while give you luck and energy. I want to go there again, it’s not easy I been there my second try with horse. You so brave to do it alone when you go deep into Khangai mountains it’s scary and you feel came to another planet.

Also I think Eva knows a bit of basic Mongolian, and the families welcomed her was generous of them, they knew she was a traveler from far because you know she was speaking a language they can&#39;t and I heard Mongolians are very welcoming with visitors and travelers, especially the folks live in countryside.

@Ariunbold Altangerel it is just a vast plains.<br /><br />Just grass and extremely few trees.<br /><br />That&#39;s why their ancestors thirsty for more lands.<br /><br />Edit: I bet you also can&#39;t survive alone in Mongolian steppe and the whole Asian steppe region.<br />Because it is just grass and rocks. And river. And few trees.<br /><br />Mongolia even use coal for their heating. Not wood.<br />Mongolia&#39;s capital is so polluted because lot of coal-powered heater<br /><br />You need colony complete with livestocks to survive the wild Mongolia and the whole Asia&#39;s steppe region<br /><br />This girl travel alone with some manufactured foods &amp; goods...

"Dear Eva,  Thank you for a beautiful film.  Your honesty shines throughout each view and event.  You&#39;ve also shown us places we&#39;ve never seen before in a way that is not the over-polished, over-produced video we often see, commercially or otherwise.  Keeping the music quiet in the background was also nice because it gave a sense of the landscape and what you hear, the birds, bugs, horses and each step.  That gives an authenticity to the video as well.<br /><br />Glad you made it!  I&#39;ve had a few adventures myself in Alaska a long time ago.  One tiny change in the physics of a situation, in your case a fall, could have very serious consequences.  The good news is that there were no broken bones, the bad news is that a concussion does have long-lasting effects and can produce other problems 10-20 years later, which is something you should research.  I&#39;ve had a few myself and what I&#39;ve learned about them after 5 years of studying them, has helped me a lot in regard to headaches and behavioral issues or regenerating neuro connections in the brain which become easily damaged.  So do some of your own research on the subject.  YouTube has a lot of neuroscience and the new breakthroughs are really quite interesting.<br /><br />So well done Eva!  You did it, you survived and you&#39;re well enough after a year to put it out there for all to enjoy.  Such beautiful country.  Such happy people too.  I&#39;m going to look and see what else you&#39;ve done.  Thank you for sharing so much of yourself with us!    R ~",RandyXB9R,2020-07-30T06:05:06Z,7

"To be really honest. I think you should go with another person. Its not that I dont think you&#39;re brave, or that you shouldnt think you&#39;re brave. It&#39;s that you dont want to encounter anyone with bad intentions out there. Did you not hear about the girls hiking alone and being decapitated in Morocco. And Morocco is a friendly country, with excellent people. But you dont know every lone person&#39;s intention thats just hanging out in the wilderness. You don&#39;t want to encounter other animals. You also dont want to have a another fall worst than the last that gave you a concussion. Its just not worth it to die, be trapped, or maimed out there just to prove something to yourself. You&#39;re already brave. You could have something as simple as gut problems that will make you sit out for a few days, or just be too nauseous to hike.  I&#39;m just saying. Do it for the right reasons, not to prove something. Maybe do it for the joy of the experience, but not to prove something. You dont need to prove anything.",Aubrey James,2020-07-29T20:28:03Z,0

"@Freshtomatoes You&#39;re an absolute snowflake mate. I hope you are a vegetarian. In your world view, eating meat is taking part in animal slaughter and keeping a pet is animal imprisonment. Just let these horse wranglers have their way. Even in horse herds, they have their hierarchies, they follow the stallion, the top boss. In this case, the horse wrangler. In horse world, it&#39;s harsh, it ain&#39;t walk in the park, they bite each other, they kick, and sometimes they kill one another. Don&#39;t think about animals from your human perspective.

"@Biz Nez I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary for you to put down other horses because you are angry at a stupid person for making an ignorant comment. Our horses don&#39;t live free but they are still the same heavenly creatures and deserve respect just like the Mongolian horse does. They are not puppies but can be fierce and strong and even wild as any animal can, imprisoned or free. Don&#39;t become as ignorant as your opponent or they have already won.",A. Silfver,2020-08-02T13:07:56Z,0
"Horses in the modern world are put in prison cell like stables most of their lives and only let out when the owner wants to play whereas Mongolian horses graze freely most of the time. These Mongolian horses are semi-wild so they have stubborn, wild characteristics. Riders have to use a bit of force to manouver them. Some energetic horses don&#39;t even stop when you pull back, but your horses have been tamed to the point of becoming harmless puppies that follow every command. A bit of force isn&#39;t gonna hurt these tough animals that survive unforgiving Mongolian winters, they even fight to injury amongst themselves in a herd kicking and biting each other.",Biz Nez,2020-08-02T02:38:13Z,2
"Going to be bluntly honest , which will mean the good ,bad and the ugly .<br /><br />The editing is professional , the scenery is breathtaking , Eva is quite adorable . <br /><br />But to give up due to weather , and to give up due to falling off a horse , even though apparently she’s been riding most of her life . I find disappointing , was a nice idea and certainly creates interest .<br /><br />But nothing accomplished , maybe travelling alone was a bad idea , as 7 days to realise or make any changes will never be long enough . Biggest mistake was to give a time limit of 2 weeks , when on a self awareness adventure , it has to be “il be back ,when I’m back “ . <br /><br />Il keep subscribed for now , and watch more , This was the first video I saw .<br /><br />I’m talking from experience , living in an other country , through loss   , no family support , as no family . And it’s just a situation of life where you can’t just give up , and more by yourself time than with others !!!!  It’s something you get used too , no regrets .",Jason McK,2020-07-29T17:03:17Z,0

"I stumbled on this video by pure chance and I wanted to tell you how moved I was by watching it.<br /><br />Excellent quality of filming and editing aside - your travel vlog moved something deeply within me. Thank you so much for honest and so personal insight into your mind during this journey. Your fears, hopes, thoughts and simple silences gave room for my own recollection. That sometimes we all need time alone with ourselves, that once individual sorrows are put into perspective they don&#39;t just become insignificant and gain their proper value - as not so life threatening. <br /><br />As much as it had to be hard experience for you I&#39;m impressed by how positive your approach had been. I would like to adapt your attitude towards life and experiencing. The video material needed to lay aside for a year I suppose so that time gave you strength and conviction to share it. What really inspires me is the your words at the end - that originally you never wanted to repeat this experience and now are already planning another expedition. I gathering my courage to finally close one chapter of my life and I think that your video just pushed me in the right direction.",napia328,2020-07-29T11:33:15Z,0
An inspiration to get even more women out there to travel solo and show that you can have adventures alone without the need for a group or male company. Saying this... its always good to be aware of the potential risks and dangers. I&#39;ve worked for a global travel company for last 15 years with many adventurous travelers in it but what you did is pretty amazing and I loved watching it. I don&#39;t have as many years of riding experience as you do but watching this made me really want to do a similar trip. Maybe not quite alone like you did but with one or two close friends/ppl. But the doing it alone part is the part that made this so special. Great Video. : ),G A,2020-07-29T11:32:02Z,0

"You did an amazing job! Be so proud! No matter what, it was a beautiful learning experience. <br />And good for you for not giving up! Do it again! ❤️<br /><br />I recently left my husband, were together 11 years, and am trying to figure out how to do it all on my own.<br />It has been a very emotionally draining few months. Feeling quite homesick.<br />I decided to take some time, after I had to quit my job working for his company, and I went on a 10 day road/camping trip by myself across BC, Canada. <br />It was such an amazing journey for me. Like you, I ran into some hiccups (like randomly running into 4 of my inlaws at a campground....super..😒).  But I figured it out. I had been so excited but still so anxious at the start. But half way through I started to really think about my life and how I got her, was feeling a bit down. But during my trip I was reading a novel, jumping off a bridge into a river, taking the time to tan, relax, enjoy making a fire, stargazing, went zip lining, stayed in a hostel for the first time, met new ppl, went for runs through the countryside and along rivers, bike rides, and went for a hike up to a glacier. So no matter what, I am so thankful I did it and that I did it for me. I can&#39;t wait to go again.❤️<br /><br />Thank you for posting your journey. <br />Always be an adventurer ❤️",Chelsea Miura,2020-07-29T06:05:57Z,2

Quite interesting video of and amazing adventure. The scenery that inspires and reminds me by the way of my own experience through very similar scenery. i was lucky that time to make my trip specific ... I managed to catch a small female wolf cub... she grew up and 3 years later I decided to release her back into the wild helping her not to stay alone but with a new family of wolves I hand reared before.  I have always been familiar with horses and I still plan a long trip through the wild here in the remains of wilderness in my country.<br />Thanks for sharing this beautiful adventure.,Pavle Balenovic,2020-07-28T12:18:27Z,0

"Correct most young Mongols are now UB city dwellers, unlike their parents or grandparents, hence your apprehension of being in the countryside. The only travel to the countryside young Mongols do today is to their family summer house, a new phenomenon which started in the mid 2000&#39;s. Before the 2000&#39;s, the young Mongolians spent all summer in the countryside with either  their parents or grandparents. It time for the young Mongolians to get reattached to their land and prevent the myth by word only, the countryside is their soul. Mining, I am afraid has screwed the Mongolian countryside for good.",Travelingman 1980,2020-07-30T12:25:29Z,12

"Wow. Kudos to you for doing this on your own. What an adventure. Concussions are so serious. I suffered one after falling off a mule at a Wyoming ranch that was spooked by a cow false charging us.<br /><br />Thank you for sharing this with us! And don’t feel any sense of failure, guilt or remorse.<br /><br />I had about five years of basic riding instruction when I did this exact trip (8 nights, 9 days) in Mongolia with two friends and some local guides. We went with a small outfit so it was very rustic and the horses were semi-wild. I think we even stayed at the same exact ger you did — the family has a small brick house nearby, right? And they have a small wooden building on the property that serves as a store? It’s run by husband-wife Bor and Tumur.<br /><br />It was an amazing experience. The countryside was filled with wildflowers. We got to the black lake on day four. As I laid myself down to sleep, an unknown power came over me and I quietly wept alone in my tent for who knows how long for who knows what reasons. My body and soul were experiencing a catharsis after days in the wilderness with nature, myself and no outside distractions.<br /><br />The trek is incredibly challenging when it rains. It was such a rainy week that the guide said it was his toughest trip in 20 years. At one point a horse in front of me stepped on what looked like normal ground and sank shoulder-deep into a mud pit. It staggered out into some brush that towered over us and fell over onto its rider, another local guide.<br /><br />Huge swarms of black flies continually attacked us and were so persistent they would crawl into our bowls as we ate our food. They crept along the inside of our mugs so close to the tea that the heat overwhelmed them and they dropped dead into the steaming water.<br /><br />Bigger flies bit us right through our pants as we rode.<br /><br />It rained every day but the last, which was so hot the horses finally broke a sweat for the first time.<br /><br />The horses are so sure-footed if you give them a loose reign they’ll naturally pick the safest footing.<br /><br />I wish I could go back!",Guy,2020-07-28T05:34:55Z,0

"Understanding?  This woman has so much character and courage that she should never need understanding of any kind from others.  She lives a life on her own terms and challenges herself in so many ways that she among such a small elite group of ancient souls with so much wisdom and truth in her heart that she stands alone in a class by herself.  I certainly have not met anyone like her and I’ve trained many outstanding gymnastics and martial arts champions who are all amazing people and wonderful students who taught me as much as I taught them.  But this woman is such a sweet, gentle and ferocious souls all at once.  That she created so many friendships and connects so often with very  good people around the world that she is teaching me that as I always have suspected, there are vastly so many more fantastic, honorable, inclusive and welcoming people than not.  And that by itself is an invitation to me to go out and explore the world and the people—because this life is such a gift and we waste too much of it being afraid.  I feel so much admiration for this young woman it is surprising for me because I have come to know so many amazing athletes and coaches in my travels that one so courageous, fierce and yet friendly and welcoming is a jewel of a life to be appreciated.  So now I am a permanent fan and admirer.  Thank you Eva.  You are an inspiration for so many and for that I sincerely thank you.",J WILTON,2020-07-27T20:36:37Z,53

Inductors interact with external electromagnetic waves, move and produce some extra waves within the cells. The shapes of these waves are similar to shapes of hexagonal and pentagonal bases of their DNA source. These waves produce some holes in liquids within the nucleus. To fill these holes, some extra hexagonal and pentagonal bases are produced. These bases could join to each other and form virus-like structures such as Coronavirus. To produce these viruses within cells, it is necessary that the wavelength of the external waves be shorter than the size of the cell. Thus 5G millimeter waves could be good candidates for applying in constructing virus-like structures such as Coronaviruses (COVID-19) within cells.<br /><br /><b>Keywords:</b> 5G technology; COVID-19; DNA; dermatologic antenna; millimeter wave.<br /><br />Copyright 2020 Biolife Sas. <a href=""http://www.biolifesas.org/"">www.biolifesas.org</a><br /><br /><b>@</b><b><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKD30jCDBzI&amp;t=21m52s"">21:52</a></b><br /><br /><b><a href=""https://youtu.be/xpupH_tq1oE"">https://youtu.be/xpupH_tq1oE</a></b>",Khurram Aziz,2020-07-27T14:10:08Z,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKD30jCDBzI&amp;t=13m35s"">13:35</a>- the sheer amount of setup it took just to get all of those different shots/angles of peeling garlic and carrots gives a small glimpse into just how much work it takes to create these serene travel docs. The end viewer gets to experience a lovely storytelling experience on film of being away from it all, blissfully at peace, but behind the scenes this was a work trip, through and through, and a lot of work at that. It boggles the mind considering how much film was shot, watched and rewatched, edited. What a gem &lt;3",Abroad on a Budget,2020-07-27T11:34:44Z,73
"@Eva zu Beck no, you did not trek alone, my wife&#39;s people helped you. Besides, what you did is no big deal, I was riding horses there before you were born, I just come from the non internet self-promotion era. Mongolian women ride horses with their babies wrapped in blankets and in their arms, but I don&#39;t see them bragging on YouTube about it.

"Tequilla Sunrise I don’t know anyone by that name, I don’t need a man to accompany me anywhere, I would never be with someone who wouldn’t “let” me do things I want to do, and of course I did it alone. Some of y’all need to rethink how you think about women.",Eva zu Beck,2020-08-01T16:34:36Z,11
"@Travelingman 1980 I don&#39;t think she&#39;s lying about doing it alone, but I also think that it was basically non-stop work as a creator, not an escape as a traveler (neither is better or worse, but they are quite different). It&#39;s a serene and beautiful escape for the viewer as a result, but for the creator, as I do believe her when she says she was alone, it must have been just constantly setting up shots, action, setting up another shot, repeat the same action from that angle, mic everything, drone shot, etc. And that&#39;s before what was probably editing hours the reached into the high double digits. It&#39;s interesting how in some ways, we who didn&#39;t even get to take the trip have had a more serene and peaceful experience of this time than the creator as a result. I often feel this way about solo content creation in the &quot;alone in nature&quot; category of YouTube. There is a girl who makes lovely videos of extended hiking in the mountains, but all I think after every shot of her walking into the distance is how she has to walk all the way back for the camera. I admire the cinematography/editing, and as a consumer I appreciate the beauty and the mood it imparts, and of course the talent is unmistakable and the quality top notch, but it is a strange feeling of the atmosphere of escape being created post-edit, and only for the viewer. Anyway, this was long as hell, but I hope you get my drift.",Abroad on a Budget,2020-07-30T16:32:17Z,2

this is NOT a criticism but have you considered a trip without all the video gear. a spiritual journey doesn&#39;t need witnesses in fact...it needs solitude. write something if you want to. take the odd still. but just BE THERE without the setups and the impressive  drone shots. then come back to virtual reality and describe the REAL WORLD.,metrin stoefta,2020-07-27T00:24:22Z,0

Hey! That trek was amazing! But btw for anyone else who wants to ride when you twist your body on a horse it makes it harder for the horse to go forward therefore making you slower so when you&#39;re ponying on the grasslands of Mongolia keep your body straight when galloping and trying to volg like she did lol.

"The first ger camp looks like a tourist holiday camp.Why do you capitalise the word alone? You were never alone, the Mongols helped  you every step of the way. Why do foreigners discount the help they receive from the locals, is it better for views? My wife&#39;s people ride horses everyday of the week and help each other on the steppe, but I don&#39;t see them on Youtube. You followed trails placed there by Mongol vehicles, again you didn&#39;t do anything ALONE. <br /><br />The problem with most millennial mongols commenting here about your ride they are most likely UB city dwellers, they have lost the intimate contact with the Mongol countryside. The parents of these millennials have moved to UB and don&#39;t need to live on the steppe anymore. Therefore the younger Mongols have lost intimate contact with their land. It was once a summer ritual to visit your parents still living in the countryside, why bother now, your parents now live beside you in UB. The younger generations of my wife&#39;s family are testament to the change, my sister-in-laws live in UB with their millennial children.<br /><br />The age of self-promoting the normal local life.",Travelingman 1980,2020-07-25T12:17:01Z,0
"It is for views. Is not the first time when she puts &quot;alone&quot; in the title, for views.<br /> Also, &quot;Foreigner&quot; is another catchy word. Especially when she stayed extensively in Pakistan, accompanied always, with her local proteges but titles were always - look foreign girl alone on such place, oh wow!  Is great and she has a gift of storytelling but is misleading, if a regular person without connections went there , I don&#39;t believe outcome would always be the same or near it.",originalmix,2020-07-26T09:06:42Z,1

"These experiences help us grow personally/spiritually and make us much stronger. My experiences were in Madagascar and Borneo where I did conservation work in rainforests and on Coral Reefs and as a guy I think it is much safer than travelling alone as a women! However for most people I would not recommend travelling alone, because if you have an accident there is no one there who can make sure you are okay and worst case scenario go for help. For anyone who wants space to think about their life and do something similar to this trip I would suggest getting a group to go together, but riding with a good distance between you to simulate being alone. Often reflection comes from low volumes of data coming in on a daily basis. It&#39;s comes from getting to the other side of boredom. If you do go on another solo trip be careful!",Paul Fadden,2020-07-25T10:47:12Z,0

Thanks for sharing this video. I wish I could do it alone too in that super picturesque serene wilderness. But I have to be honest with you. I was so scared for your safety as I watched this video. I knew that trek was never a joke to do it alone especially by a girl like you. But I salute you. You conquered your fear alone.

I watched 3 minutes and tuned out. I grew up on a farm on horseback. Some fundamental problems: 1) you want to trek alone but can&#39;t natigate without GPS. 2) you can&#39;t plan food rations 3) that guy who absolutely destroys his horses mouth with his harsh hands is the best rider you&#39;ve ever met?,D Q,2020-07-24T10:59:26Z,1

As an equestrian I actually have a lot of questions about how she cared for the horses?,Faustina Padolskytė,2020-07-23T17:35:14Z,7
Mongolian horses don&#39;t need much care they are semi-wild. Fend by themselves.,Belle Blanch,2020-07-27T12:04:02Z,0
@Faustina Padolskytė yeah you&#39;re right but it&#39;s her choice and she decided to go full Mongolian and not wear any helmet 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️😂,Tugul Amar,2020-07-24T21:17:40Z,1
@Tugul Amar oh ok still I think she should&#39;ve at least had a helmet on cause she was going into the wild alone on a horse.,Faustina Padolskytė,2020-07-24T21:14:13Z,2
Also just because they&#39;re semi-wild doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re aggressive. Many of them are trained to be quite the opposite and those are the horses that are typically given to foreigners or first timers who don&#39;t have a lot of experience with riding horses.,Tugul Amar,2020-07-24T20:47:57Z,1
How are you judging how good a rider Boynaa is from like 20 seconds worth of footage? He&#39;d literally be in the top 0.1% of the world when it comes to knowledge of horses and how to ride/train them. He&#39;s a nomad who&#39;s clearly grown up around horses. Mongolian horses are all semi-wild OR full wild. The horses u see being ridden in Mongolia are all semi-wild. This means they don&#39;t need much attention from a human. They forage for grass themselves even when it&#39;s covered in snow in -40C. They can be left to fend for themselves in nature and often times are. And yeah she probably wouldn&#39;t have known what to do if they were hurt (maybe she would&#39;ve??) but what could anyone do when stranded in the middle of nowhere and their horse leg breaks? Heal it then and there? She&#39;d have probably made a call if it was serious or just didn&#39;t account for that kinda thing,Tugul Amar,2020-07-24T20:46:29Z,2

"@originalmix I 100% think she cheated. No night footage as well. Not even any sunset or sunrise morning shots. I also think she faked her accident. Blood looked like tomato source and why is there no video of the fall? Only audio? Cameras record both the video and the audio to the memory card. <br /><br />But mostly the car tracks to her exact location you can see are fresh in the grass in the drone shots. Definitely not alone. And 7 days and no night shots.....<br /><br />I believe she and a friend travelled not far out of town, setup a tent and flew the drone a bit, packed up and went back same day.",Colourberry,2020-07-26T09:35:56Z,0

"What you are doing is one of many people&#39;s dreams, its so inspiring and at the same time questioning one self whether am really ready for this.<br />What i am trying to say is even though many people dream of such experience. many don&#39;t have the courage to do this,  you are one strong soul. 👍🏻💪🏻",Christine Jack,2020-07-22T16:38:59Z,1

"@Batnaran Munkhbat Yeah I know that. His life story is one of most amazing and inspireful histories of all humankind. A man who was renegated by his clan, and survided - God know how - with his family, managed to built the largest empire of history. He gathered followers not by his wealth or prestige, but by his ingenious leadership habilities. Great man he was. I don´t know where exactly did he hided and survived alone with his family, but I really wanted one day to visit and know in person.",Paulo Henrique,2020-08-03T04:57:57Z,1
"@Paulo Henrique As a Mongolian who was interested in ancient Mongolian history since childhood, Ghenghis Khan is known for his time of solitude and isolation in the steppes of Mongolia, on a run away from the rivaling clan, when he was barely a teenager. After his 30s, the only difference was that he had an entire royal cavalry riding behind him.",Batnaran Munkhbat,2020-08-02T15:26:31Z,3

"Hello Eva, when I first got to know you when you went viral on youtube during your trip to Pakistan. I had just started a film production company over my dream of travelling the world. I used to watch your videos and think if you would think, how far do must be dreaming to go and if you will cope up with the social media pressure and grow as a storyteller. And here you are with a beautiful and meaning video. And beautiful camera work, your strength, commitment and honesty to your work is inspiring. And yes, the universe is too enormous and magnificent to have any ego if we think of the whole. And that is the beauty of it too, you have all the power to wish for something, you get in abundance. And I cannot imagine how crazy it would be, you seek solitude you got it in abundance in the magnificent nature with all its beauty and harshness. It would be hard since we have been social animals all our lives and it would, I cannot imagine what fears it would bring to feel you are all alone in tens of hundreds of miles. And you give us a cinematic experience of your solitude. Stay blessed and good luck with your next solo track. Would love to catch up on your next trip to Pakistan. <br /><br />Best wishes, <br />Layla",Reality Beyond Dreams,2020-07-21T22:07:24Z,3

"(Sorry if this comes off as unkind, but it has to be said for the sake of other viewers who might be influenced by this video and try to do it like she did) As much as I love travel and horses myself, I have to say that it was really reckless to do this trip like this -- and it&#39;s important to acknowledge the recklessness and pointless risk-taking, so that other who see this aren&#39;t tempted to do what she did: she didn&#39;t use a helmet, she didn&#39;t have experience going alone with 2 horses for such a long trip, and (apparently) she didn&#39;t have any kind of frequent contact with someone who knew where she was at all times in case she needed help -- she could have easily died alone had she fallen more badly and lost consciousness (especially without a helmet), without anyone finding her in that kind of wilderness. She was lucky she got out of this alive. Even though she says she wouldn&#39;t encourage this kind of trip in the video, it&#39;s worrying that others might indeed attempt something similar after seeing this. At least please wear a helmet.",cigall,2020-07-21T19:22:21Z,0

So So I agree! My two friends and I are Asian and we had an amazing time in Mongolia a few years ago.<br /><br />Beautiful country with amazingly kind and smart people.,Guy,2020-07-28T05:46:14Z,3
"CHK MKHan That’s not true. I’m Asian and my two friends are Asian and we had an amazing time in Mongolia a few years ago.<br /><br />If anything, we bonded better with the locals because we were Asian. A family let me watch a private shaman ceremony. My ethnicity (Hmong) practices shamanism..<br /><br />I had about five years of basic riding instruction when I did this exact trip (8 nights, 9 days) in Mongolia with two friends and some local guides. We went with a small outfit so it was very rustic and the horses were semi-wild. I think we even stayed at the same exact ger she did — the family has a small brick house nearby. And they have a small wooden building on the property that serves as a store. They even have a Facebook page. I forget their names.<br /><br />It was an amazing experience. The countryside was filled with wildflowers. We got to the Black Lake on day four. As I laid myself down to sleep, an unknown power came over me and I quietly wept alone in my tent for who knows how long for who knows what reasons. My body and soul were experiencing a catharsis after days in the wilderness with nature, myself and no outside distractions.<br /><br />The trek is incredibly challenging when it rains. It was such a rainy week that the guide said it was his toughest trip in 20 years. At one point a horse in front of me stepped on what looked like normal ground and sank shoulder-deep into a mud pit. It staggered out into some brush that towered over us and fell over onto its rider, another local guide.<br /><br />Huge swarms of black flies continually attacked us and were so persistent they would crawl into our bowls as we ate our food. They crept along the inside of our mugs so close to the tea that the heat overwhelmed them and they dropped dead into the steaming water.<br /><br />Bigger flies bit us right through our pants as we rode.<br /><br />It rained every day but the last, which was so hot the horses finally broke a sweat for the first time.<br /><br />The horses are so sure-footed if you give them a loose reign they’ll naturally pick the safest footing.<br /><br />I wish I could go back! Mongolia is a beautiful country with amazingly kind and smart people. So many young adults there speak multiple languages — English, German, French, Chinese, etc.<br /><br />It’s my favorite place of all time.",Guy,2020-07-28T05:45:19Z,2

Sometimes the world does feel a big and ancient and unchanging place - and Mongolia is just so much bigger.<br />When you&#39;re ready you will head out again, better prepared, and I pray you will return again and share whatever the world threw at you.

Unnecessary risk. Careless behavior regardless if you were successful or not. <br />As a woman, there&#39;s the added risk of being a sexual target. In countries like Mongolia and China, sex trafficking is a HUGE systemic issue and you didn&#39;t consider this at all I bet.",Jason W,2020-07-20T21:42:39Z,0

"Hugs Eva...what a great story.  Experiences that allow you to feel the essence of your endurance, determination, skill, and intelligence are rare in our &quot;modern&quot; world.  For your age, I would say you fared very well.  First, you survived and experienced amazing moments.  Second, you had the visceral experience of finding your limits.  Fear of being so alone, injuring yourself and knowing you are not physically invincible, realizing you are vulnerable to the whims of nature (thunderstorm) and that she is indifferent to your survival are humbling.  I have had these same experiences sailing on the ocean, but at an older age.  You have gained wisdom at your young age that is rare.  What you will do with that wisdom is unknown.  The Earth is a magnificent planet.  We are all responsible for helping her survive so future generations can experience her magnificence as we have done.  I look forward to your future adventures and hope you will seek to use your acquired wisdom to help others understand the importance of addressing reduction of environmental impact and climate change.

"Who are these 114 people who gave a thumbs down. I feel sorry for them, they don&#39;t understand the kind of journey this was. May be Eva isn&#39;t the only one who did a crazy adventure like that, but it sure doesn&#39;t deserve a thumbs down. Anywho!  I cried when you fell, I remembered from your instagram stories that you had fallen from your horse, but still with that sound and screen going black damn I cried. This felt so personal. I have been to Mongolia, and I could feel a tiny bit of how you felt in that vast nothingness.( I wasn&#39;t alone) but Mongolia can make you feel so insignificant . Every time I see your Mongolia stories I want to go back. I think I will!! Loads of love and wishes for your next horseback trekking !!!",Nomadizing myself,2020-07-19T14:15:50Z,1

"I grew up in the Mountains of Montana, rode horses and motorcycles, spent a lot of nights out under the stars. By the time I turned 19 and found myself in the US Navy&#39;s survival school I knew most of the skills they taught us there. <br />One of the biggest challenges we can face as a person is being alone, this is because so often we are mirrors of the people around us, when you remove the outside influences you are left with yourself. <br />These days I am into sailing boats, you get that same solitude without the rigors of camping out, you are always in nature, but always have the comforts of home with you. <br />Towards the end when you got bucked off, you found yourself against the wall of your emotional toughness, you found your breaking point. The next time out it will be a bit further down the line, you will be able to push that much harder. <br />Also, before your next trip I would strongly recommend you learn how to dig a &#39;Dakota Hole&#39; much easier to make a small fire that way, and it means not needing to carry propane with you. A cast iron skillet is far more robust than even the best built camp stove, and if you are creative you can bake bread in it. <br />You might think about linking up with any of the channels on YT that do bush craft and see about doing video collabs, at the same time you would be able to pick up some good skills that will make your next trek out there easier. <br />Good luck on the next one!",Renegade Show,2020-07-19T07:18:00Z,0

"@Peep hog wash! I hated wearing a helmet when i rode motorcycles for years. It sucks when you are just out taking a leasurely ride! Besides apparently you dont know or understand the power of The BLOOD  Jesus shed for ALL OUR HEALING ! THIS IS YOUR CURE!  Hell i was crippled for 11 long and painful years missing a lot of my ankle. But when He showed up and shook things back into order, i could walk and run again! And over the next two years everything that was missing GREW BACK! ligaments, tendons, muscles, and a full and complete recovery except for the very faint scar over the massive area. Perhaps you should drop that spirit of fear, and take up the shield of faith! Learn about Jehovah Rophekka - The God who heals us of ALL our sicknesses and ALL our di eases! And get healed and get delivered from that lie you are in agreement with. I still wouldnt wear a helmet unless i was in the rocks or steep unstable country. But for the most part, that stuff ruins the adventure. I pray for safety and ask for His Angels to go with me..... And they do!",La Deda,2020-07-27T17:24:49Z,0

"@La Deda She&#39;s not a &quot;snowflake&quot; for suggesting a helmet wtf? Does Fox News tell you helmets are bad or something?<br /><br />I&#39;ve gotten three concussions from riding. My first one I blacked out for a few seconds (minutes? idk), I would have probably received a much more serious concussion/brain injury had it not been for my helmet. Traumatic brain injuries are no joke - they will give you life-long consequences (I occassionally stutter and have some general difficulty getting words out after my concussions - I <b>never</b> struggled with this before) and there is essentially no treatment available for TBIs.<br /><br />I think wearing a helmet is a personal choice for everyone, just like wearing a seat belt or a motorcycle helmet is. I&#39;m not going to berate someone for not wearing one, but it&#39;s not evil to suggest wearing one, either.",Peep,2020-07-26T14:05:50Z,4

I unsubscribed because you keep pretending to be something you are not.  You may have ridden horses before but you went off with horses you did not know.  People get thrown off horses it happens to the best riders but you get up and move on.  You are lucky to be riding the small mongolian horses and not some tall western horses that would of made your fall much worse.  Maybe the horses were spooked because they sensed your insecurities and  they lost their confidence.  You had a tough time being alone for two weeks.  The mongolian folks warned you against it but you thought you knew better.  My advice is stop thinking you are a gritty trekker and trying to portray that image.  You are the typical city folk that should spend their lives in multistoried buildings and ride a cab.,Luis,2020-07-19T04:29:36Z,0

"I really like this video because it shows how travel stories can turn bad and aren’t always super awesome.  But they always teach a lesson for sure.  I related to this video because as a very young woman, I planned a trip to Hawaii by myself for the first time and was planning on staying a while.  I stayed for two weeks in one town then was going to move locations. Things happened, my Airbnb host cancelled on me at 11 pm the night before so I didn’t have time to research a place to stay and ended up staying in an unsafe area.  I didn’t feel right and had to leave after those two weeks.  So although I felt like I “failed” I still had the most excellent two weeks and the satisfaction of being independent and successfully traveling for the time that I did.  And I feel like you must have had a similar thought in that you learned a lot on your trip and discovered new things despite kind of “failing”.",Michelle Hattersley,2020-07-19T02:42:22Z,1

"Amazing video, but why aren&#39;t you wearing a riding helmet? As an equestrian myself, I would never sit on a horse (especially not one I don&#39;t know), without wearing one. You were lucky you didn&#39;t hurt yourself worse when you fell, considering you&#39;re out there by yourself. Wear a helmet around horses, people :-)",Minoreth,2020-07-18T15:34:55Z,0

"You are one of a kind eva ! We have been following you ever since your Saudi trip, the kind of places seen through your vlogs, many of us were not even aware that such places even exist in Saudi, and yes,your Yemen and Socotra vlogs - I mean it takes real guts for someone to take such risks and cover the most unpopular and risky places in the world that most travellers fear to explore because of the risks. The sheer rawness of your vlogs, the closeness to nature, the very beauty of it in its raw form, and reality that we experience via your vlogs, I am certain that at this point, I may not get it from anyone else.  As a fellow aspiring traveller, You have always inspired us, and have shown us places no other traveller could have ever shown.  And now, with this piece of work, the solo Mongolian trek with you and the horses, as a traveller and as a fellow human being, you have elevated yourself to a different level altogether, and our respect, love and passion for you and raw travel in particular has increased multi-fold. All I can say is that my heart goes with you and your efforts as a traveller. ...<br />You inspire us..You motivate us...your work is just fascinating and pleasure to eyes of a real traveler....😍😍",TRIPOLOGUE,2020-07-18T15:21:34Z,0

"I love your videos and don’t want to diminish your work in any way. I also understand that Mongolia has a very different horse riding culture, but given that this isn’t the first time that I have seen you horse riding in a video without a proper helmet and that people watching your videos may follow your example, I feel the need to speak up. Your fall very nicely demonstrates, why one should ALWAYS wear a helmet when riding horses. Even with years and decades of experience, one may fall and while most falls are harmless, one day you may hit your head at a stone and end up in a coma. Before anyone dismisses this as a made up horror story, please know that someone in my family fell off a horse, while not wearing a proper helmet, and that she was in a coma for several days and barely survived. As I said, I understand that Mongolia has a very different horse riding culture, but if they don’t provide helmets you could easily bring one",BiaDarkia,2020-07-18T12:19:15Z,0

I wasted my time in proposing and loving guys who never bothered to stay with me.. I am 27 and i  have learned a lot about the human mentality.. I am a woman who have given rose to men and yet I have never been loved.. Men chose other women over me.. But what keeps me going in life is that I never cheated on them not ever forced them to make me their wife nor give some commitment... Although I am hurt to the core yet every day is a new beginning to me... I don&#39;t have any love but I have a career to focus on and I am thankful to God that I have it to grow in life!!!! I think I am enough myself and I don&#39;t need another soul to complete me... much love Eva Ma&#39;am❤,shayaa Das,2020-07-18T06:34:58Z,47

"Thanks Eva you and Mike &quot;fearless&quot; teach us what NOT to do with your some of your experiences and decisions. <br />I find the sequence hard to follow up to understand better, also many questions during your decisions made, as well as things unexplained like the big radio frequency you had on your belt and also you edited the many important parts like the fall, I would rather you have put what had recorded the camera so it&#39;s was more real.<br /><br />Also it&#39;s kind of frustrating that you send a mix message at the end... saying it made you grow up a lot as a person and promising you won&#39;t do it again but that you&#39;re planning your next one so how can we interpret these contradictions that you change your mind every day or second or month? How we take all previously said and lessons from you? If your mind is mixed up as well? <br />I just only wish you plan better your next solo riding horse 🐴 more cautious and mindful so we keep enjoying your adventures. <br /><br />Even all my criticism I loved the music 🎶, the landscapes and the narrative you are crazy talented to transmit to us all your emotions and feeling...

I am in my early 50&#39;s and in the past few years started doing solo travel because if I wait for others to make the time to join me I will never get there and lets face it I&#39;m not getting any younger.  But while traveling in Sapa, Vietnam alone and hiking off to a waterfall where there was very few people at time. I realised I do need to me a bit smarter when taking off on my own as no one will miss me if something happens (I don&#39;t have my trips planned out so my family never know where Im going till maybe the day before).  Having said that, this will not stop me just made me rethink the way I do things …(live the adventure, smarter!)

"I&#39;ve had hiking trips where I didn&#39;t reach my goals and had to turn around. Everest Base Camp being one. First time, only made it to Namche Bazar. I too didn&#39;t think I&#39;d do it again. It kept playing over in my mind on occasion. I didn&#39;t want to think I lost to the mountain. I couldn&#39;t live with that. So, of course I tried again. I did make it to EBC this time. Felt great. And it no longer annoys my mind. Good luck with your second attempt at solo horse trekking!",Darrenj H,2020-07-17T23:21:12Z,0

The thing about fear it makes you feel so alive it heightens all your senses the challenge is controlling the fear rather it control you.  An epic journey that was and in solitude one finds out how noisey one’s thoughts are and in the wilderness one has to tame them to find peace in the solitude. Amazing what you did and the horses try you out they all do it and I’ve ridden horses that are easily spooked one minute you riding along nice and calm next minute it’s chaos as it’s bucking and rearing up all over the shop . Find a horses that doesn’t get spooked easily the next trip,Mick Angelhere's World,2020-07-17T23:01:39Z,0
"Bravo! You have tested your fortitude - I applaud your courage to do what you did, not many people would have undertaken such an adventure, much less a woman alone in a foreign country.

"Know what weight a few oz and cost  few buck. That the only thing that would save your life. From one the main reason why hundred of hiker go missing &amp; never to be found? Called hyperthermia.<br />   our trusted friend. &quot;Cotton &quot; even a jacket has Cotton sew in. Both of you fall into water. Or sweat so it&#39;s wet, or rain. Cotton wet get very cold to dry. Evaporation can get 15-20 dg colder. You need to hold your body temperature in. Wet clothes, no.  And if you continue you can get hypothermia by night fall.<br />I had altitude sickness it the same. Terrible pounding head ache,  feel as your are dreaming. As I couldn&#39;t remember. They said i when back in the bus to sleep. As that all you can think of curl up and sleep it off.this is where hiker  go sleep under a bush off the trail. Sleep you die. <br />    So You have to build a fire but still you have take you clothes off to dry.     The thing to carry cost a few buck plastic sheet to cover you or a canvas. It&#39;s will keep your body heat on your body and can&#39;t escape <br />the long night. A wet blanket no. <br />Or even if you get hurt and can&#39;t walk. That plastic will save your body so you say right there.",thomas,2020-07-17T22:26:51Z,0

"Hi Eva, I&#39;m glad that you are o.k. I&#39;ve never ridden a horse, (except a pony when I was a child), but I can imagine that the fall from such a height was painful. The fact that you went through it and walked so many miles back with the horses is impressive. I&#39;ve always wanted to be in an excursion like yours, it must have great opportunities for nature photography along the way given the distances one can travel by horse. Maybe when the pandemic is over, I can finally try. Have you ever been to Patagonia? Horse back riding there would be a dream/ beautiful. That&#39;s one place that I&#39;d like to visit.",Angelo,2020-07-17T21:36:15Z,0

Looking at the saddle it seems very uncomfortable and painful... I feel like the horses couldn&#39;t take that pain... :/ I always think about that when I ride... It&#39;s actually very uncomfortable for horses to wear all that gear just so humans can feel &quot;comfortable&quot;. You are a good rider but horses are going to be horses and definitely having a gear that helps them helps us when riding.

"What a wonderful unexpected surprise. So beautifully shot - the great expanse of Mongolia. So brave to take a leap of faith. No shame in trying as some never get passed the front door of comfort. So agree that you have to be open to plans changing, to follow your instinct and listen to the whispers of your soul. It takes courage to share your vulnerability.  Makes a refreshing change to the polished and perfect. Thank you for continuing to inspire and aspire to following the open road.",Sofi-Ona Hamer,2020-07-17T20:26:54Z,0

Ever read Arabian sands by Wilfred Thesiger? <a href=""https://archive.org/details/arabiansands00thes"">https://archive.org/details/arabiansands00thes</a> <br /> Its a classic on the author&#39;s successful crossing of the vast Arabian desert with a group of Bedouin tribesmen back in the 1950s. An expanse of land so vast and devoid of life that even the Arabs, with their astonishingly rich vocabulary, could only refer to it as &#39;The Empty Quarter.&#39;  It might spur you into thinking of attempting a guided partial (emphasis) crossing on camel-back, if that is at all possible. If it is, I&#39;m sure it would make for a breath-taking video. Now, where&#39;s that subscribe button...",Aiman Ayman,2020-07-17T19:53:05Z,0

You gave your 100% into the trek and even though you say that this was a tough experience and no one should have it but I think people should get this experience, I feel happy that you shared this personal experience and you gave countless people the courage to face things.... It doesn&#39;t matter if you cry in your struggle but what matters is to keep going and never stop.

I went on a guided horse trek in Mongolia 2 years ago to see the Tsastan reindeer herders and it was incredible, but also very challenging.

"“This showed me how insignificant my ego was.”<br /> <br />Eva, I have been following your journey for a while now and you are truly truly inspiring. You always go deeper than the surface, and somehow make me feel a unique connection with everywhere you go, and everyone you meet along the way. <br /><br />But this journey my friend, regardless of how spectacular Mother Nature looks, sounds more like a journey into your own self, facing your fears and thoughts, facing YOU in its essence. That’s  why it’s so vulnerable, so raw, so ... you. <br /><br />Just like the horses, free in your soul and not bound to the earth by any earthly <del>worldly</del> feeling, ego, insecurities, negativities... and those are the moments bringing us to our senses and reminding  us of our actual purpose in this life.<br /><br /> Although we may not be nearly as adventurous as you are, brave girl,  we all need to experience this moment of solitude at least once in our lifetime, even if it’s not in the vast fields of Mongolia, accompanied by horses that are boundless to this earth. Much much love and respect for you.❤️",Helin Abdullah,2020-07-17T18:25:09Z,208

"@han0509 yeah that&#39;s where I fall short, I don&#39;t have a good relationship with the Tatar side of my family and we&#39;ve lost contact a good while ago, so never learned to speak Tatar nor know much about my ancestors or culture :( I&#39;m researching on my own, but it&#39;s quite hard. I&#39;m sorry that I wasn&#39;t able to give you good insight into what Tatars in Crimea live like today, I wish I could.",Jocchi Hasaar,2021-04-23T23:21:41Z,0

"@han0509 no idea about that, if I&#39;m being honest. From my knowledge, most if not all Crimean Tatars have been deported from Crimea back in 1950&#39;s, my family was a part of that mass deportation, that&#39;s why they live in Uzbekistan and why I&#39;m also part Uzbek. As for Tatars as a whole, the ethnic group is doing just fine, we aren&#39;t oppressed or discriminated against. Tatars are the second most populous ethnicity in Russia I&#39;m pretty sure. Volga Tatars also have a small culturally autonomous republic within Russia called Tatarstan. The city of Kazan is it&#39;s capital, and the Volga Tatar language is very much alive and Kurban Bayram is a national holiday there. Tatars are embraced in Russia.",Jocchi Hasaar,2021-04-23T23:10:32Z,0

But to do it when you are not at your emotional best, makes you a super human. The ego crushing is a very important lesson in learning what truly important things are in life.

":/ really hard to watch when you were hurt and crying! I don’t think you “gave up”, you were mature enough to realize you weren’t going to make it! It takes a lot of courage (plus it’s very humbling) to take a step back, go against your initial plans and accept the fact you can’t control everything/do it all on your own! I usually hate asking for help, but recently realized I can’t take away the joy people feel when giving others a helping hand! Anyway, keep up the good work 👍 your vlogs are awesome :)",Maria Assis,2020-07-17T17:03:17Z,69

"I hope you realize that what makes this special is that you keep being you. That is the magic sauce.  I was watching a video about Mongolia from another YouTuber and it was good on quality but all staged and formal and I thought something was missing. Then I thought of you and look for you to see if you had anything on Mongolia and here you were with all that honesty and very natural.  That is where the magic is. Thank you. Keep it up. Believe me,  all that emotional storm will past. Like the saying says &quot; IF YOU ARE GOING TO HELL JUST KEEP GOING&quot;. I have gone through it and many people do. You will too.",Igor Augustus Gonzalez Chacin,2020-07-17T17:02:32Z,0
