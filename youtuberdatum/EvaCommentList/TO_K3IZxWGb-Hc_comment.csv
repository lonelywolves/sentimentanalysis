"I think you&#39;re one of the absolute best, natural travel story tellers out there.  Your video editing/narration/music is second to none.  What is best is that you open the eyes of so many people to the fact that while governments might not get along, people all over the world naturally do.  You are breaking down prejudices and barriers, all the while showing was a beautiful place the world really is.  I&#39;m going to binge watch every episode.
