"About a month ago to Abu Dhabi to start a new job, and yeah, when departing the United States, from JFK, the international terminal was like a ghost town. Chatting with other passengers on the flight, I learned most booked to depart from other US cities like Houston and Chicago and Seattle. Even so, the flight was 1/3rd full. <br />The UAE definitely takes covid19 seriously. Fines for not wearing masks in public or for not keeping distance. On the other hand, covid19 cases are dwindling to nothing and things are opening up again here.",Don Carlin,2020-08-20T04:27:50Z,0

"I was in Brazil when Europe went into lockdown, hardly any of the foreigners took the pandemic seriously at first and we where all still enjoying life partying out in the streets. I eventually booked a flight for a few days later as my family urged me to do so and still thought I was overreacting. Little did I know that my flight was one of the last flights flying to the EU from Rio for a while. The people who decided to stay had to go to different airports and a lot of them weren’t even able to book online. All of their flights were incredibly expensive, almost 10 times what I had paid. Compared to what they went through my journey was relatively hassle free except for some confusion over a cancelled connection at Lisbon airport. Still made it home after 24 hours of traveling, 3 flights and 4 international airports. Arriving in Europe was dystopic and scary but I’m glad I didn’t choose to stay. Thinking I’ll stay home for the rest of 2020 and be very careful with travel plans for 2021. The reality of having to face potentially being stuck in a foreign country is scary and def not as fun as it may sound to some.",line,2020-07-27T10:16:34Z,0

They forgot. Luckly I woke up by myself and I asked 2 nights friend before  if could stay with here. Luckly it was not necessary.

Thank you for another great video which made me slightly emotional! While I’m not a traveller I do love plane travel and airports and exploring new places and feel sad that we may be limited in our adventures for a while - but hopefully not forever!

Smart advice not to fly unless for emergency right now. I have recently found your Youtube videos during the virus and really only in the last month have been looking now at Youtube regularly. The way they are learning virus particles hang in the air longer than first thought and especially indoors I would be very scared to fly on a plane. Sounds like they are at least trying to take measures to clean the plane but people without any symptoms have been found to spread particles so hopefully mask wearing works well enough. The United States is going downhill fast with especially young people refusing to wear masks and bars reopening.  They even want to reopen schools in the Fall where where social distancing is usually impossible. Glad you are doing well.,Larry Loveless,2020-07-09T19:30:35Z,0

Hi Eva <br />Bangladesh 🇧🇩 can be your next destination.

When did you fly? Heathrow was barely alive but Frankfurt was full on 23/6 without any possibility of social distancing. Then I landed in Ljubljana and while eavesdropping at the police checkpoint I couldn&#39;t believe how many people still fly for tourism. Well tomorrow my quarantine ends and I can&#39;t wait to buy gear for gardening after a three month sedentary lockdown. Cutting overgrown grass with a whipper snipper was a good workout and also felt oddly satisfying..,glass heart concubine,2020-07-07T14:30:14Z,0

"Eva, I have watched your videos for a while now and all I can say is Thank You! You are such a beautiful person inside and out and you are someone who to me would be an AWESOME person to know! You are not the average &quot;run of the mill&quot; type of person that so much of our world is inhabited with. You have an enormous beauty within you and I just wanted to let you know that. If you ever make it back to Salt Lake City, Utah liked you did on Amtrak a while back, well perhaps we could grab some lunch and just sit in a park and just chat. It would enlighten my life in a huge way and I hope you would get something out of it too. I know it sounds like a date and I am not intending it that way... just future friends (I hope anyway). Keep safe and we will all get through this crazy Corona Rona Bat Flu as I call it and I deal with it all the time at work as I am a Firefighter/Paramedic.

I’ll have my first day back at work this month after the collapse of air travel within the EU. I’ve been laid off from my job at the Helsinki Airport since the end of March and I’m pretty excited to get back to work. However our mid-sized airport is currently operating at about 25% capacity so I feel like it’s going to feel like an abandoned building most of the time. I really hope this whole thing goes away as soon as possible. Thank you for the video 💝,Miika Valo,2020-07-06T10:07:02Z,0

You were lucky you left back then as planes are being allowed to transport people to full capacity again (no distancing rules just masks). Better stop touching your face mask with you hands all the time as it is a sure way to get viruses into your mouth and nose if you happen to have them on your hands.

"I can understand your reaction when you enter the airport for the first time when the pandemic started 😂 i was traveling for 6 months and i was in panama when the pandemic happend, such a crazy thing, police in every street, your passport said when you could leave your neighbourhood. I was lucky to get on a plane back home because quarantine in Belgium wasn’t so bad!

Hi Ewa. I literally just started watching your channel. I only saw your journey on a cargo ship and this video from the airport is the second video I watched. Within those two I was trying to figure out what nationality are you as you speak fluent English but you do have an accent. And then the flight to Frankfurt made me thinking - Is she German? But it didn&#39;t quite worked for me. And then to my surprise I&#39;m hearing &quot;łapa&quot; when you&#39;re playing with your dog back home. What a surprise - You are Polish (Jesteś Polką). And so I am. A Polish man living in UK. Dzień dobry i witam spowrotem w Europie. And i hope you&#39;re going to get used to living in the middle of pandemic.

"​@PassiFlora96 Eva is from Poland. Watch more of her videos she talks about this. As for the British vocabulary I see where you are coming from. Technically she is speaking in a mix of Polish accent and a British accent. It is obviously not pure British. I&#39;m fairly certain she had a rich Polish accent but after going to university in England (She went to Oxford I believe. Smart lass) she adopted a lot of British English. The result is a very soothing way of talking, but I think it&#39;s just her voice and because she is really pretty too lol",The Sexy Skywalker,2021-02-14T10:19:52Z,0

I just flew in the US. I didn&#39;t want to but I couldn&#39;t get a refund for my flight and was hoping they would enforce masks and social distancing. The flight was nearly completely full and no one was social distancing or enforcing social distancing and the airports were full of people. It was only like maybe 75% of how full it normally is. They told everyone to wear masks the entire flight but loads of people were taking their masks off. :( I&#39;m really scared I&#39;m going to get it now! It&#39;s been only 24 hours but now I have a stuffy nose and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s allergies or what!,Sarah Lop,2020-07-05T15:40:10Z,3

Though I find your vlogs attractive and entertaining I envy your freedom to travel.  My travel abroad was only due to military obligation and for 44 years I have yearned to travel as freely as you have.  Your life is certainly a privileged one that I cannot imagine you would ever want a traditional stay at home job!

Wooo You clean the screen unnecessarily yet eat food on the flight. <br /><br />People avoid long flights and fast. Eating completely fails the purpose of mask on flight. If an infested person is sitting anywhere in the flight there is no way you will survive if you open your mask to eat and drink. <br /><br />Also I loved I am Legend for seeing empty city. Not in my wildest dreams I ever thought I would ever see my own city this this. <br /><br />Its only good in movies and I can see why characters look so mad in such movies.

Plastic everywhere in Abu Dhabi. It&#39;s like someone pranked the airport.<br />So good to have you back on the mainland! 🙌🏻,Fearless & Far,2020-07-05T13:14:07Z,136
"I was thinking, you should make a David Lynch-esque version with that airport footage! Try a different video style for fun and growth, and I guess you have a bit of time now too. Black and white, lots of silence and nothingness, or just the hum of a few machines and the occasional strange human sounds. Very polite PA messages broadcast to almost no one. Weirdness.",Joe Toh,2020-07-26T18:51:04Z,1
