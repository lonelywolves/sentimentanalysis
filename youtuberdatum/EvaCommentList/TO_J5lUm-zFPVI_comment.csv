"In Mexico we do not eat bugs, in some regions it is something cultural and ancient.  Original Mexican food?  try tacos, mole in its different versions, carne asada, cabrito, birria, tortas ahogadas, pozole, there is a lot of variety that represents us with dignity",JAIR GONZALEZ,2021-03-12T14:47:34Z,0

"The Italians wouldn&#39;t have pizza if it weren&#39;t for Mesoamerica. Tomatos were a new world crop. I&#39;ve had most of them except for the escamoles, the ant eggs, and they are supposed to be like caviar, which if you think of it, eggs from a fish, would probably also be strange to some people. Suffice to say, most modern Mexicans have never tried these dishes. My favorite were the gusanos de maguey.",Fremen Warrior,2020-07-29T22:08:33Z,0

"Dont be fooled; the Restaurant, manager.-man, is doing a marketing tactic to create a difference of offerrings, which isnt acctually true. The Mayan &amp; Aztecs historical, limited amount of documentation doesnt reveal excessive eating of or such a variety of insects; which doesnt provide the actual proof behind this difference of assumption. Later generations where taught by the limited documentaion which survived. Frying of foods is a hidden key, behind Spanish &amp; Various European forms of cooking, as the Americas didn&#39;t even have the technology of extracting enough oil to be able to. Neither did they have the ability to make Rubber material for the claimed &quot;Pelota&quot; game of life or death as many are assuming just by Pictographic &amp; Inscription documentation, which can also, possibly be just Story telling, without complette 100% truth!

Perfect for vlogging so I&#39;ll get around to it ASAP. Your world travels and the wonderful people in them make me so so happy I didn&#39;t join the military. No offense to military people, but killing other cultures is not my thing and I grew up on National Geographic and other cultural TV shows. I couldn&#39;t sleep if I ever killed someone. Even a &quot;bad&quot; person. One person&#39;s villain is another&#39;s hero and visa versa. Like the song by Sarah McLachlan, Adia, we&#39;re all born innocent and what happens to that? Your travel videos and others make me see that innocence in the world again in spite of the efforts of media, movies and TV to paint our military industrial complex as a good thing.

"If these were more easy to obtain in my country and if these actually taste good I would totally eat them! we have many enviromental troubles because of rising and feeding millions of cattle and cows, and the meat isn&#39;t really as good as chicken or other animals... But in Colombia and most of South America we tend to have the pre-conception that having a piece of meat in the plate is necessary to make it &quot;complete&quot;, and people think of meat as the main source of protein and calories.

"My name is Patrick, I&#39;ve traveled to some interesting places around the world to find out about things. I dived with dolphins, rays and sea turtles, walked across volcanoes, was traveling in ancient temples, in the hinterland of the Taurus Mountains I encountered rattlesnakes and my personal highlight was the Serra de Tramuntana where I often feel drawn. In doing so, I had to fight my way through impenetrable areas, without which one would have dared to step backwards with the wrong technology. For me, there is nothing more exciting than to spend days wandering around with nature with unknown people and to take successful steps together with simple things and learn new things.<br />At the campfire you can also look back over the unpleasant moments of life and master together culinary delicacies, which can sometimes taste very strange. Often the people get to know each other anew through this intensive experience with nature and you find yourself again.<br /><br />My roots are located far back in Catalonia which belongs to Spain, the culture is very much influenced by people who live with nature and not against you. People who make no distinction between rich and poor, attractiveness and unsightliness. Sometimes this Spanish blood comes to light in my temper and a strong sense of justice comes out of me. Are you now scared and you prefer to be attracted to men who want to be men but are not. Or do you also have unbridled temperament in blood and can you engage in a lengthy conversation with me?<br /><br />Although I do not like English, the pitch is often overbearing, your voice makes me very angry. Your expressions enchant me. I do not know much about you except that I want to feel your breath on my skin, to a very special place.<br /><br />How can I reach you?",Patrick Schröter,2019-10-13T01:24:40Z,3

"Nice video, I think eating of insects should be promoted much more. After all, it&#39;s among the most environmentally friendly forms of animal protein out there. Unfortunately, due to scale issues they are expensive, but they are an excellent healthy food source. The squeamish attitude many have towards eating insects is mainly cultural. There are plenty of cultures where eating insects is perfectly normal.",silent willy,2019-10-11T19:46:04Z,1
