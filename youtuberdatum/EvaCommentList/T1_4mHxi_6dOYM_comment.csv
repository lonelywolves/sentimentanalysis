Hello Eva. I do not even know if you can read this comment. I have a hundred of questions for you but I will just make the main ones: how did you get permission to travel there? It is almost impossible. How do you get food? The island lives from deliveries of ONGs or Saudi Arabia. What about accomodation? I cannot find any hotel and I do not think you travel with a tent. How do you post your videos? Where can you get internet connection? I would be delighted to get an answer from you to understand better your situation there. Thanks a lot and enjoy.,Manuel Corral García,2020-03-30T00:45:16Z,0
