"My dear gullible western minded lady, remember what happened to the couple cyclists/tourists just like yourself visiting the Middle/far East Tajikistan.

"ISIS has been eradicated by the Kurdish and Iraqi military since last year. Only few scattered in Syria. Plus, if we assume that they were still to be here, they&#39;re located in Iraq and Syria. If you look at the map, Oman is waay far from that region to the south. And just so that you know, Isis does not represent Islam whatsoever, they&#39;re like the KKK in america, which no one believes them to be Christians.
