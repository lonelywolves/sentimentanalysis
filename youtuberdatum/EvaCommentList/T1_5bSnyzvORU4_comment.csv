You brought the dishes of your countries and your reactionary habits to this developed country.

"Respect is an illusion that only exists in the minds of people with the same opinions. That is why you expect these independent women to wear headscarves: you have no respect for their opinion, which is different from yours. Freedom is a scarce right, banned in Arab countries, and thus unknown. These independent women enjoy their freedom without any intention, for whatever you insinuate, seduce men. Seducing men is only in the heads of those men, not in those of women. I&#39;ve never met a woman who said &quot;get me!&quot;. That would surprise me to such an extent that it becomes impossible.",PaPyRene,2020-09-19T10:16:10Z,1

"Wow! Lucky you Eva! I’ve worked and lived in Saudi Arabia for 27 years (which became my second home, too) and I’ve seen only couple of historic places. During those times traveling should all be pre-arranged  and need to get permission  from the local authority with a qualified tour guides. We cannot just explore on our own (especially ladies). I’ve seen the Saudi’s transformation from a very conservative country to a more open one and how it progressed and developed to a modern one.  I’m so happy for the huge change for the better especially for the women. Keep it up Saudi. Shout out to all my friends and colleagues in KSA! On another note, Eva you’re such an inspiration to all the women that you’re empowering on. I enjoy watching your vlogs and I have to catch up more. You’re so brave and fearless.

"Well,  Eva first, I would like to really thank you for the positive energy you make in every vlog since the first day you arrived in Saudi. Because of you a lot of stereotypes have been changed for good and it became cluster clear to anyone that there is no real reason to be afraid of visiting Saudi and explore the Saudi culture. I&#39;m sure a lot of people who watch you wish they are with you on the same adventure and experience that too &quot;I&#39;m one of them by the way&quot;. You literally surprised me because it has been less than a month in Saudi and you went to places that I never think off or didn&#39;t have a chance as Saudi to visit. &quot;I am a little jealous of you&quot;. Lastly, try to enjoy your time and make friends as much as you can because I&#39;m sure they know more places, customs, and traditions.

I know someone from Saudi. You cannot go outside without a hijab and cannot travel without a man. These are govt operatives in the video.,Daniel,2020-03-08T16:57:23Z,2
"@Kareem theeb I never said Iran was an Arab country, i am well aware they are not Arabs. I was just making the point that you shouldn&#39;t judge everyone just by the actions of a few. Nor do they claim to be Arab, they are just living there and they were full of praise for the country. What you really seem to have a problem with is they don&#39;t dress or act the way that you deem suitable, that&#39;s your problem not theirs.",Tipperary Mick,2020-03-08T14:42:45Z,2
