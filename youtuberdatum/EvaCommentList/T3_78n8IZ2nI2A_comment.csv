I&#39;m from Sri Lanka and in our culture this was happening other way around until English invaded us with their cultural manners. In ancient Sri Lanka women were married off to one family with many brothers. The reason behind this type of marriage was because families didn&#39;t like the idea of distribution of their land and wealth among multiple families. So all the brothers in one household used to share one wife! This doesn&#39;t exist in our culture now.,Sandy Dee,2021-04-27T20:28:38Z,0

Short version of my comment:<br />It’s nice to see how women all over the world are starting to be treated like humans instead of cattle being sold or traded off to be bred or used by the receiver how ever they deem fit. <br /> <br />Long version:<br />I do love these documentaries. Even America was very male dominated back then and the biggest thing the world all had in common was that women were under the thumb of Males where they didn’t have any say in their bodies or life and was traded and sold off as cattle to be used however the receiver deems fit or bred. I’m glad the world is changing to the point where women can say “no” and decide what happens to their bodies and what’s left of their life spans as humans. It’s nice honestly.,Peachy Cream,2021-04-26T17:14:29Z,0

What are you talking about? Western women choose practical polygamy more today than ever before. It&#39;s a natural part of choosing more desirable men whether or not they are already married. Monogamy can only exist under patriarchal enforcement. We have de-facto and semi-de-jure polygamy all over the West.  Family courts recognize and rule according to the polygamous habits of modern Western society. You view this as strange because we don&#39;t have a legal document for a polygamous marriage. Well guess what? Neither do they. You aren&#39;t so different.,Marc V,2021-04-24T07:13:00Z,0

I dont like plural  marriage mainly because the man gets everything he wants and the women have to accept it. I dont believe women are ever truly happy sharing the man they love. If she does she&#39;s either lying to herself or not in love with the man.,Charlotte Bruce,2021-04-23T18:14:17Z,0

"Marring many wife&#39;s is normal in Africa the western world hard to change it because of the economy issues in west. My grand father had two wife&#39;s and they married in peace. The problem we have today is that the current men are not masculine anymore for a feminine woman to summit to them. In this kind of home, a man is allowed to be a man and a woman is allowed to be a feminine home carrying woman. <br />The more a western woman work and do what a man does the more masculine and stressed a woman becomes. She can&#39;t be able to summit to her feminine nature , she start having sex with different men like a masculine men does, she start fighting for unnecessary women right when she can&#39;t achieve more than a man because she&#39;s into competition with men. I have alot to explain but this is a way the nature made us to be. If we return to nature way of life we will be at peace and won&#39;t see wrong in cooperating together with other women to live together with a one masculine men who can provide and protect his family just as the male lion does. A society is what it is because of the male there Western world society is what is it because of the weak men there.  Western men are sex addict. The women have to become what they want just to satisfy the men. In this part of Africa sex is for making babies and it helps the man to stay strong considering that his not spreading his seed on the bedsheets and watching another man and woman having sex on his screen or magazine.",Alpha uchechukwu,2021-04-23T09:27:49Z,0

"I don&#39;t think there is Eastern way of raising vs Western way of raising that leads to accepting polygamy without any jealousy, and count the blessings in the form of having women  company in the form of co-wives  to sit and chat, while a loser alcoholic husband is just like an empty can after spraying his sperms over a field and done with the only job of life.. biology. This is a human adaption when they had/have to survive in adverse conditions. If the same masais start prospering or doing worse then all things jealousy, competition, preferring to maintain smaller family will start...as it&#39;s already shown in the video..the direction is moving away from primitive practices... this is with development of mental faculties and questioning everything..why I can&#39;t have more co-husbands, why my father married me off, do I have any options? Do I have any choice? What&#39;s my choice, rights, agency? Etc...when people have very primitive and survival mechanisms, their world and choices are limited...they had similar role models and does the Masai woman have a &#39;choice&#39; not to &#39;like&#39; co-wives? Does she have any other options for leaving that system?? Why people think jealousy is all bad? Only very dumb or very numb people don&#39;t feel much  and accept everything including abuse without questioning, do those Masai ppl and esp that man looks vibrant and full of life? Far from it..all look numb and in &#39;whatever&#39; phase, since they have a good relationship with the planet doesn&#39;t mean everything about them is good. A person with monogamy can be very ecologically oriented and can effectively process negative emotions and have a far more vibrant and meaningful life too . The way jealousy is interpreted and processed may be good or bad, but basically only mentally developed people can feel jealous, as they can feel whole diversity of good and bad emotions. Like I m wondering why would anyone consider primitive systems that have no gender equality and no sense of agency of people better than the developed models? Their own ppl are leaving primitive family system s why then westerners want to start  such family systems, which look divorce free or infidelity free?? Do you really think if people are given chance to have multiple partners then infidelity or divorce problem gets solved?? Far from it... problems of mental development are not going to be solved by mental under or undevelopment.  Those ppl don&#39;t have a chance to study, have any other options so they learn to accept what&#39;s given to them, but can a Westerner live that way and assume that all relationship problem s and mental health problems will suddenly disappear? Well , all the best if people have that simplified, dichotomous and escapist type of thinking. A cake can&#39;t be unbaked.Your problems can not be solved by just blindly copying foreign lifestyles, what works for them may be a disaster for you! Your problems can only be solved by living in your system, making whatever changes are within your means and accepting whatever you can&#39;t change like that Masai woman, and being your own agent for change... polygamy won&#39;t work for me in a zillion years...my husband cheated on me with many women for 17 years...I know what it feels like...I can&#39;t accept it not coz I was not raised in such a culture but in any culture including Masai culture cheating is wrong, just see what 3 co-wives can do if their alcoholic loser husband is caught sperm spraying somewhere.. high on testosterone tank...",Mamta Bhatt,2021-04-21T15:38:32Z,0

Me asusta mucho, y he estado tan desesperado desde que lo escuché, siento que soy un marginado y diferente de los demás. Lloro toda la noche, no puedo pensar bien, estoy tan abajo. Incluso mi médico me aconsejó que no puedo transmitir el virus usando los mismos utensilios, saliva, etc., excepto si tengo relaciones sexuales. Todavía estoy enfermo, nadie en mi familia tiene esta enfermedad. Y no sé de dónde lo conseguí. He hecho análisis de sangre muchas veces y mi hígado está bien, y nunca siento dolor en mi cuerpo, pero no puedo dormir bien todas las noches desde que conozco mi situación.

"Yes, a beautiful story. It&#39;s sad that the climate is changing and that the Maasai people&#39;s way of life is changing. I wish it could be preserved, but the truth is that the earth will change so much that no one will be able to stop it. Even if it weren&#39;t for pollution and other modern man problems, the natural changes occurring in the earth will destroy these people&#39;s way of life eventually. It&#39;s sad, but there is hope: Jesus. After all the death and destruction, He will return to earth and set up a perfect world once again where EVERYONE lives in small farming communities like the Massai. Jesus will rule the earth from Jerusalem and His servants will clean up the earth and help the survivors set up small farming communities where people live in harmony with nature as God created it to be. I know many people don&#39;t believe this, but it&#39;s true. Jesus is the Savior of the world! Not man! So repent and believe that He came to die for our sins, and rose again the 3rd day. He will come back and fix everything! A thousand years to God is like 1 day, and a day to God is like a thousand years. He&#39;s not limited to time like we are. But don&#39;t wait till it&#39;s too late to get right with Him. Only those who trust Him will survive! I wish all people on earth would live like the Masaai in their own environment and believe that Jesus is God, but that time will not come till Jesus Himself rules on this earth, after the time of great death and destruction. I&#39;m ready! Are you?",Clark Clips,2021-04-20T13:32:00Z,0

"The fundamental is that equal numbers of men and women are born so polygamy always means men with no wives. That is simple maths. So yes rich men in Islam eg might have up to 4 wives and in the FLDS in the US fundamentalist mormons 3 or even more - or even in a few cases up to about 80 wives but you then have surplus boys, the men with all the wives have power and some are therefore able to abuse it. In more balanced equal relationships that is less likely.",Jane Smith,2021-04-19T22:21:45Z,0

"About 50% of human births are of females and 50% are of males.  If one male gets several females or even if many males get just one extra female (two total,) then there will be many males who will go through life without any female.  Because of the human birth pattern, it would seem that monogamy should be the natural state of affairs for the human species.

Almost all prophets mentioned in the Bible were polygamous. AlQur&#39;an is the first and only holy book which limit that a man can only have up to 4 wives, but if he cannot afford them and cannot do justise he must not more than 1 wife. <br /> Monogamy was a fake thing planted in Bible by anti Christ.

"Whatever Yayai said sounds very beautiful, about sisterhood and sharing love.. However I see it as confirmation bias. The tradition sets the unfair structure and to protect the tradition the women makes up all these reasons why the unfairness is good towards women. We see this confirmation bias in every culture in the world, just observe how people justify lack of equality, unfairness, even the use of violence saying its good, to protect their religion. <br /><br />It would be nice if people come from a neutral place, and genuinely question &quot;What makes a good marriage?&quot;<br /><br />And really, critically think about it.",MM Ng,2021-04-12T10:19:55Z,0

"In the western world, marriage is more about commitment, loyalty and never-ending love, or at least ideally, it starts that way.  Because life changes us in different ways, husband and wife may change at different rates and for different reasons, leaving the once never-ending love beat to hell and back. The truth is people are often, self-serving. As they change, they have little regard for the man or woman they once  married for life. Marriages can grow cold and stale if time and effort aren&#39;t invested continuously to keep life in the marriage. Life-long marriages are sometimes more about comfort than a reflection of never-ending love. Of course, there are wonderful exceptions, but its more the exception than the rule.  In the 3rd world, marriage is often about finances and survival for the woman and the family that might earn a bartered fee for allowing a groom to marry her. The woman often has no say. The family is simply selling her off for a return that will see the family survive in a brutal culture.",Candy Sweet,2021-04-11T07:45:49Z,0

"Western culture has so much to learn about love and marriage, we know we don’t have it right but have yet to make a collective shift toward a better way of life. The wives in this video don’t feel jealousy toward another wife because they have not been TAUGHT to feel jealousy or compare themselves toward other women PERIOD. That alone would make western culture so much better for women who are constantly pitted against each other and often cut each other down because of it,  we feel jealousy toward another woman because we  are taught to and we are taught to because we are expected to “keep our man” and fight off other women who might try to come into the picture lololol seeing now how a different way of life could be it seems laughable that polygamy is put in such a horrible light by western mindsets, and unfortunately most people are still too closed minded or prideful to admit that they can learn from the Maasai.",Mona Loré,2021-04-10T18:06:44Z,0
"@Mona Loré From what I see in you reply, is lack of historical education for sure. And my culture is not Western for you to know. <br />As I said, promiscuity is not a progress, and your acceptance for multiple partners reveals much more about your vision of yourself as not deserving a devoted partner. You can share your lover as much as you want, but it&#39;s more of degradation, going back to stone age. Whatever.<br /><br />And seeing this &#39;accepting&#39; wife stuck in polygamous marriage, well, that&#39;s very particular self-destructive behaviour.

Sorry to burst your little bubble but it is practiced in Western society as well, and also in even broader and more diverse forms of unions such as open relationships, polyamory, etc as well just not as openly and freely and the Maasai because of laws enforcing monogamy and, well, because of diluted people like you.

"@anonymos Actually, you’re wrong. More women means more mouths to feed and more children to care for and feed. What’s a cow going to do? Feed a whole family? Yeah right. Also, jealousy can stem from love, just like God’s love, which is not a bad thing at all. You term jealousy as if it’s only a bad thing. It’s not. Also, jealously isn’t always about possessiveness and has nothing to do with east or west. Anyone, from anywhere, can feel jealous. In her case, she doesn’t love her husband, so there’s no feeling jealous towards a person you had no choice in bringing into your own life. Also, polygamy is nothing to be proud of. This woman does not know what real happiness is. There’s a lot of things she can’t control and that life she’s living is not a life anyone would want to live. She was FORCED to marry at such a young age. She had no choice. That’s nothing to be happy about- wasting life away to be subordinate to an old man- no education, no seeing the outside world, living in poverty, not choosing how to live one’s life, etc. These people live in poverty and marry out of ignorance and because they’re uneducated. They know of nothing else outside of their life, therefore, that is their only happiness. But, we know that there is life outside of their “boma,” better quality of life they do not know about and YOU probably do not know about either. If you really believe that theirs is a good life and if you’re really defending polygamy and their ignorance, then you’re also ignorant and uneducated just like them.",Haidy Kamel,2021-04-10T23:42:52Z,0
"@Haidy Kamel Did you even watch this video? Seems you took away nothing from it. As suggested more wife&#39;s bring more wealth in the form of cows and love to the family. Cows are offered to the family when the girls in the family marry. Re jealousy - When we become consumed with the pervading idea that we lack things, we slowly become blind to what we already have, and we become ungrateful for those gifts. Your&#39;e looking at things from a western perspective as the first wife explains, western culture grows up with the idea we are only supposed to have one husband one wife, therefore jealousy is born out of this sense of loss if we &#39;lose&#39; our husband to another. Jealousy is either resentment of someone enjoying success or advantage, or is the fear of losing something you feel is yours (rightly or wrongly) to someone else—your spouse, your best friend etc. As the first wife explains when one grows up within a culture whereby monogamy isn&#39;t expected you don&#39;t have this expectation and therefore a no sense of loss when your husband gets a second wife, rather one feels appreciation for the gifts second and third wives bring. Secondly as the first wife suggested she grows to love her husband, a love that was never born our of desire but a genuine love and appreciation for another human. Like this masaii wife suggests they prefer to live in a big family,  more wives = more children, more wealth, ( cows as gifts) more family members to enjoy life with ( not compete with) , more love. She is clearly one happy and wise woman and like she says, what you were raised with becomes your truth. Thats westerners are happy with one husband and they are happy if their husband has a few. It would appear you think somehow because they  are void of jealousy and if they don&#39;t feel like us they lack love, this is very ignorant",anonymos,2021-04-10T06:14:54Z,0
"@anonymos Having more women in the family does not necessarily mean more wealth. A lot of these women do not work, but raise children, cook, and clean. Also, regardless of a different culture or way of thinking, jealousy is a natural tendency found in any human who feels - in this case, it comes down to love.",Haidy Kamel,2021-04-10T05:46:12Z,0
"Not quite, different culture, different way of thinking and functioning to preserve a sustainable way of life Like she said more family members brings more wealth ( cows)  to the family and a larger family structure to share the work load and enjoy together. The culture lives sustainably amongst family not a village, which takes energy and the hands of many.  Arranged marriage was also a way of creating family structures and making sure the elderly are looked after,  again this serves a function within the culture rather than each one living for themselves. This was told to me by masaii themselves when I went to. stay with them.",anonymos,2021-04-10T05:41:07Z,0

It works a surprising amount of the time.

"Thank you for this video, it was really interesting and I appreciate it! Even for an already open-minded person (which I would like to think that I am) there is a lot to learn about the world we live in, and the best way to learn something is to challenge things that we take for granted as right or wrong since childhood - which a video like this does...<br /><br />Personally, I see nothing wrong with polygamy and polyamorous relationships in itself, as long as everybody involved are OK with it at all times and everyone respects the value of everyone else. I can also see the benefits of living in large families like this video shows, while of course being aware that no relationship is perfect and that more people probably means more challenges. However, the tradition of arranged marriages against the will of young women (and young men as well) is hard for me to accept, despite what traditions and society says, so it was nice to see an example where it turned out well for this woman. &quot;Learning to love&quot; is something that happens in all relationships, even those that start with a &quot;love at first sight&quot; moment.<br /><br />It would be interesting to find out more about how the children see their families and their upbringing, and how they are handle traditions and expectations in the &quot;changed&quot; world of today.

"Did this presenter just fall out of her mother’s womb, polygamy marriage and relationships existed in western cultures also.<br />FFS it’s in the bible, many heads in the Judeo-Christian bible had multiple wives and lovers. <br />The black people’s of the world will never get a fear shake with white people telling black stories. <br />The sad thing is, a lot of black and African interests are just not concerned with the white world, and so for blacks raised in the West it can seem so lopsided and unfortunate. <br />It’s like the cold war version of the atrocities during slavery and the colonization. <br />So sickening, and Euro’s with all their pseudo unilateral  self described <i>wisdom</i> can’t help put to continually prey on people’s and cultures they will never understand. <br />Leave them the f—k alone already.",nlawson2004,2021-03-31T06:24:40Z,0

"I see many who comment who have a negative idea of marriage. And many of the western culture do have a negative idea of marriage. They do not want to build a marriage and build a love relationship but want to &quot;fall in love&quot; and once that type of love wears off, they divorce and move on. And they fail to realize that in part it is their unwillingness to build and repair a marriage that it is they who are broken and broke the marriage. And what of their children? They repeat the same pattern. Hence, marriage has become a game and more and more guys just simply go around like dogs mating with one after another without commitment. And why not? Because they see that if they marry, their wives who feel &quot;entitled&quot; will divorce and want him to continue to pay for them even though it is they who break the marriage. Such an evil backward self destructive culture to live in. And I think that among the Maasai who leave, in time more and more of them will return home and go back the Maasai way after the hurt and dstruction that they will have endured within the western culture that seemed to look so great at first.

"@Junub Media ​ @Jacklyn Everage  polygamy is not an African culture! It depends on your religion. Africa has many religions like Christianity, islam, judaism , traditional religions, and many more. Even Muslims who practice polygamy, only few of them actually do! Most Muslims would actually not agree with it, and some even divorce over it! I know this bc I am African. Also, u can notice that she was saying that she liked it when her husband married more women, bc she has someone to talk to now, and doesn&#39;t feel lonely when her husband goes away. Also, these women are sharing the house and farm work btn each other, so its practical for them.",Yumna Madi,2021-04-04T23:59:37Z,0

"Ezekiel 13:20-21 &quot;Therefore God says, &#39;I am against all the devices and techniques you use to hunt souls. I will snatch them from your hands. I will set free the souls you are trying to capture. I will rip your magical bracelets (passport.hand) and scarves (mask.forehead) to shreds and free my people from your influence, so that they will no longer be victims of you. That is how you will realize that I am God.<br /><br />Next comes the response from me because keep getting the response that I am sucking this out of my thumb.<br /><br /> I&#39;ve taken 20 different translations and yes some say we are trapped like birds in a cage. Other translation talks about a wristband and veil, you have wisdom or not. Also it says in Ezekiel 13 with some insight that we can&#39;t buy bread and barley without that band and scarve, and also if we don&#39;t we will die .Walk right behind the rest of the 1 world religion also from the bible by the way. Ezekiel and Revelation have many similarities .This is the only other place where the head hand combination is described just like the sign of the beast from the book of Revelation , Covid is a severe flu 98% get no symptoms mouth caps don&#39;t work andzzz <br /><br />Translated with <a href=""http://www.deepl.com/Translator"">www.DeepL.com/Translator</a> (free version)",Lisette rijkelijkhuizen,2021-03-24T20:59:49Z,0

"I can understand what is the maasai lady is trying to tell about polygamy. The concept of sharing she&#39;s into. With co-wives, you have companies where house chores could be done with a finger snap.  Plus having friends, who understand your situation, because they are part of it. You can talk and discuss everything, as long as everyone is sincere and hold no envy towards each other. Anything happens to husband, it is not a woman to suffer but few women can be united, supportive and pull all the strenght to cope up and heal with the trouble as soon as possible rather than living in grief and sorrow",zhazhalove,2021-03-24T13:02:51Z,1

I think that when we’re raised to be community based and have no choice in our partner we get on with daily business and extra partners are a relief because work/joy/stress/happiness/sadness is shared. <br />In choosing one’s mate for love and not practicality - this is where jealousy is born. <br />I’ve perhaps lived both worlds but prefer the later. The first is a lovely life and can be lived with happiness and contentedness. Yet it’s harder to do so after you’ve been able to chose with your heart. <br /><br />We only have one life to live.,Gillian,2021-03-24T06:56:54Z,0

Due to these changes the new generations are changing their ways in response to the increasing population density.

"Female genital mutilation (FGM), a popular practice in many 3rd world countries. FGM can make sex undesirable for women because sex can be painful. If their husband has multiple wives, she will not have to have as much sex as the other wives and because of that, will suffer less. Not to mention marriage throughout history was never about love. It was about the benefits. That’s why marriage isn’t lasting. People marry for love but we as people usually don’t have the capacity to be in love for 50+ years. Most of us will get old and just accept the person we live with as our partner. The sad truth",Bows n' Ties,2021-03-20T04:50:12Z,0

They accept things as they are. I think that it&#39;s them that do not question things, not us. I am glad young people are questioning these practises, which are also discriminatory and give no choice or voice to young women who are building up their personality. I also disagree that it is a question of rejecting or maintaining tradition. It is not like you must be for or against tradition. You can be both. Not all that is traditional is good just for being a tradition. We try to construct better societies, don&#39;t we?",Luisa María Pérez Vázquez,2021-03-18T13:09:53Z,0

What a privilege to be able to watch this! Yayai is so kind and has a very good outlook. She understands the cultural differences and she makes no attempt to impose that her way of life is better.

Arranged marriages are a common practice even today. You don&#39;t fall in love in the moment. You learn to live with the other person. Polygamy is risky in our world since it&#39;s a lust practice and not just a way of living. People seem to be confusing things and finding out some stuff that&#39;s been all around. It&#39;s like cocaine if you ask me. Once you know you can do this most of us will try to get more and more whyle our Morals colapse. These guys are used to it simple. We are not. If it&#39;s a gradual process and we loose the romantic part in some way maybe stuff will happen. The biggest issue is what i told. Don&#39;t rush things. Fine you get this and can live with it. But most westerners and most people around the world cannot. It&#39;s not your right to just go there and say &quot;HOLD UP THIS IS WRONG AND YOU CANNOT HAVE MORE THAN ONE WIFE YOU ARE FILTH&quot; as you cannot say &quot;YOU ARE STUPID BECAUSE YOU DON&#39;T SHARE YOUR WIFE OR HUSBAND WITH OTHERS&quot; in most countries. The problem is not the way you live. The problem is in the way you try to change others for your own benefit. That will cause disruption and some wars. Good for them to be this way. If they&#39;re happy fine. Just don&#39;t massage your ego over this.,Luís Gomes,2021-03-17T12:22:50Z,0

One thing I will say objectively os that I&#39;m willing to bet that the divorce rates on arranged marriages are way lower. And that having multiple wives would also have a much lower divorce rate.

"@Leona DuLac Ackermann marriage by love and freedom is a modern invention, it came out of novels and literature, inspired by natural &quot;high&quot; of limerence, it is infatuation that lasts from 3 months to 4 years. Limerence is also how cheating starts.<br /><br />arranged marriages have been very stable in history, across all castes and classes, in our modern &quot;freedom and in-love marriages&quot; there is a huge failure rate of 41% ending in divorce in the USA, for the second marriage the rate increases.<br /><br />so with western modern marriages love dies out of cohabitation<br />with arranged marriages love rises with cohabitation.<br /><br />Also there are statistics about marriage failure, is directly correlated to how many partners you had before marriage. The thing is the more variety your brain experiences the more wants, there is no such thing as &quot;getting out of your system&quot;",D M,2021-04-21T11:51:38Z,1

But it&#39;s especially the forced marriage part that makes me want to vomit (cry, scream, rant) tbh. Also because forced marriages and polygamy seem to often go together? <br /><br />As for your question about polyandry. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve never seen a report of a society where polyandry is practiced. And especially not in combination with forced marriages. So it&#39;s purely academical. But if I saw men talking about how they were married off as young boys against their wills? I&#39;d be super upset as well, yes.<br /><br /><br />Your comment about children makes sense.

"@Leona DuLac Ackermann I can understand how you feel about it. It&#39;s that gut feeling your cant describe to anyone right? I know it well. LOL. There are good reasons why Africans in particular practiced polygyny. I want you to think of a woman in say Victorian England who had no access to birth control and ended up having 10 or more kids. Meanwhile in Africa a woman with several cowives would usually have no more than 3 or 4 kids. So each woman ends up having a healthy number of kids and her health and quality of life was better. Secondly, not every man was expected to have more than one wife. Indeed most men only had one. It was usually wealthy men who had multiple wives. <br /><br />They other point is that polyandry was also practiced in other parts of the world. Would you feel as strongly about a woman having multiple husbands as you would the reverse?",Omeso Nyabs,2021-04-02T21:54:59Z,1

"Of course her way of &#39;marriage&#39; is better in her eyes because she doesn&#39;t have to be afraid of her husband cheating with another woman because at first point they&#39;re forced to marry that person and she doesn&#39;t have that strong trust and love bond to that man i as example have and secondly, the man either way does what he wants and it&#39;s none if her business as long as she&#39;s taking care of the kids. Even adding two strange womans to this existing marriage and expecting his wife to be okay with. It would be fair if she was allowed to have three husbands like he has three wifes. It&#39;s the perfect marriage for him. Nothing else. The way she replied to the question if woman can have more than one husband said a thousand words. The sadness in her eyes. They have no own choices and no rights except being a good wife and birthing his kids. Considering the fact that she was happy when he found the second wife tells a lot about how alone she was. No neighboors and other friends. She accepted someone else in her husbands bed just to have someone to talk to.

"What I really took away from this was that if you&#39;re pushed a certain view, it&#39;s hard to change it. And I didnt get that considering a polygamous life. I got that from the lady&#39;s own answers and deflection from the question about women having more than one husband. That&#39;s what the problem is right there. She was raised she doesnt have a choice, that&#39;s shes just property, and is sad other women arent willing to accept this anymore. It&#39;s not even about whether polygamy or monogamy is right. It&#39;s about the fact she was still raised in a patriarchal society that treats women like cattle, manipulating them into believing they must be happy this way. Shes happy because she doesnt know any better. If she had a choice, what would her answer be? Why cant women have more than one husband? I mean...if the idea of polygamy itself is so great and about sharing the love, then why does it matter if men share one woman? <br />The reason is because it gives women power in a patriarchal society shifting to more neutral. And yes, I do realize the reason is because women have babies, and you can have more babies with more women, not one women with multiple men, but that&#39;s not really the point, nor does it sound any better. Again, its telling women to be happy and grateful they are mere baby makers. That&#39;s their use. Again, it&#39;s not an argument for polygamy. <br />An argument for polygamy would be more in par with a swingers society, where anyone can sleep with anyone, whether actually married or not, and no one, not even the men, can be jealous. This is the argument for polygamy. This video is just an argument on how certain cultures have messed up ways of raising their children. And to be honest, it really isnt far off from some Abrahamic cultures, as well. Meaning...if we have issues with this same kind of attitude and brainwashing, manipulation, and oppression in the middle east, why should I gain a different perspective with this tribe, which is basically teaching the same morals? Men are in charge and women are to be subservient and obedient. And content. <br /><br />Sorry, but you&#39;re basically asking me to respect a culture that says women&#39;s feelings basically dont matter, because that&#39;s really the reality of it. I can understand it, but I refuse to respect it or act like it deserves some sort of respect.",Ahlamkin,2021-03-16T05:00:38Z,0

I prefer being Polyamorous to bring monogamous- <br />Not the biggest fan of polygamy as there&#39;s a lot of cults connected to that lifestyle and some pretty bad horror stories <br />I like constant attention and like dispersing that and not forcing one person to try to juggle it all alone and it works for my family.

"There is something that is not mentioned in this report and which explains many things however: the Massaï practice excision on little girls! The girls are &quot;cut&quot; or they will not find a husband! They are then given in marriage by their father and they have nothing to say. In these conditions, do you think that the condition of wife is synonymous with pleasure? Under these conditions, would you not be happy to &quot;share&quot; your husband with other women in order to be less often solicited to practice a sexuality that is only pain? Do you really think this is comparable with a Western couple whose partners choose themselves freely and then enjoy sharing the same bed? The subject of excision is taboo, we cannot talk about it and the first wife will never speak of this in front of a camera. Our concepts of jealousy must indeed seem strange to her.",CathyMoune,2021-03-15T17:15:31Z,0

"I respect that cultures are different and people in this part of the world have different needs than us westerners, we are extremely privileged in many many ways, so of course certain things wouldn’t make sense to us. And in some ways the Massai are better than our society, like they do not harm the environment like we do. However, there are just so many things about their culture that I think are ethically wrong and I can’t find this way of life respectful or beautiful. I really hope someday they can remove the female mutilation, child marriages, sexism, etc from their culture and preserve the good things about it like family and community.  Western culture has many many flaws as well, and things are worse in certain places than in others, but I think it’s important to see the full picture here.",Gray on the Water,2021-03-14T16:15:09Z,0

It is an innate need to mother or father a child, the people who suppress this biological need are actually selfish and self-centered. The heavy responsibility of having kids is no reason to avoid it, but rather to try your best, with the help of our Creator it will be ok. <br /><br />Polygamy is a choice, and it&#39;s depends on personal circumstances, I am not saying everyone should do it, but it is a good option for some people so the option should not be represented negatively.",l' M,2021-03-14T18:16:29Z,0

"Very interesting video. I do think that when something persists, like monogamy in the western culture, it’s because it works. Polygamy works in the Maasai culture, at least from what yayai said, because they only live within their own direct family. Husband and wife(s). So of course it is lonely if it would be just her. Also they strongly depend on children, the more children the better the chances of sustaining yourself.

"I believe in equality. My husband can have multiple wives as long as it&#39;s acceptable for us as women to have multiple husbands. This is still very one sided because this is what they&#39;re taught. It&#39;s ok for her to be ok with her way of thinking but it&#39;s still very one sided, in favor of the man. Women here are most likely married off super young, like she said, without choice. They are forced into these marriages and they buy into this reality that they aren&#39;t jealous and they love this lifestyle because it&#39;s all they know. If it was truly a choice it&#39;d be different but she&#39;s not in a boma from a choice she made. That&#39;s what makes it different to me. We have polygamy, many people in our western culture choose polygamy or not to marry at all, but it&#39;s the fact that there&#39;s a choice in the lifestyle you want to choose. It seems real odd that everything she said was very politically correct and there&#39;s no such thing as a perfect relationship or being happy all the time. I don&#39;t think it was as honest as it could&#39;ve been. Also, the way she answered some of the questions were very superficial, like when asked if they could have multiple husbands... that was uncomfortable. It&#39;s oppressive, a culture that favors and provides the man with all or most of the power. She said we wait on our husbands to come home to have someone to talk to. No, we have children too, family, friends, and many of us have full-time (outside of the home) jobs, so when we get home, we enjoy spending time with our husband. The lifestyle is different but I wasn&#39;t provided with a great argument as to why I would want to live in a boma, or have co-wives or even share my husband with multiple women (aside from it just being an interest or our thing). That&#39;s just me though, I understand it&#39;s their culture, their traditions and all she&#39;s known and I can certainly respect that and their outlook.",A H,2021-03-14T04:09:33Z,0

Anyway you slice the story points to man is superior and in high demand. That doesn&#39;t sit well with women. Now, you go to bed kiddo or you are on period?

"Short answer: I don&#39;t like sharing.<br /><br />Long answer: It&#39;s a double standard that men can have as many wives as he would like to but the woman must remain monogamous. A man may sleep around and is thought of as accomplished but a woman who sleeps around is thought of as a slut. Although from the scientific perception, relationships like these make a LOT more sense as it is in the male&#39;s best interest to father as many offspring as possible. Fortunately, in my culture, it is not this way because I like the idea of having my person.",Sedona,2021-03-13T23:29:21Z,17

"If I&#39;m honest I would prefer this life to the stereotypical 1950s housewife life that was recently the norm in the US, since as she said I wouldn&#39;t want to be lonely, and I would enjoy having co-wives probably a lot- that being said, I would rather just have multiple families in the same community so that there are always people to be with - however, I think if I was in her exact shoes I would like it since it seems like the only other adults nearby are her husband and co-wives- much better to me personally than being isolated in your home like most American stay-at-home moms like my mother was. my question is how are there enough women for every man to have multiple wives? polygamy seems like something that might come about after a war or something where lots of young men died, but in general, the sex ratio is about 1:1 at birth, so it would be impossible for everyone to be polygamous (with one man and multiple wives)- do the young men in this culture often leave and go to other places to live and marry?",Reagan Bowen,2021-03-13T22:15:07Z,0

"I don’t care about the husband. I  respect that Masai’s understanding of her own culture. While I’m a westerner and won’t adjust to polygamy, this Masai woman’s intelligence, perspective and acceptance of her culture and how far she’ll go to embrace and perpetuate its existence seems rationally sound. Even enviable. If, as she claims, the wives truly aren’t jealous of each other, then there’s also the domestic harmony of sharing and spreading love among themselves. The result: loneliness would seem uncommon since they have friendship and unity. The children are likewise raised, in this instance, by three mothers. The tribe, meanwhile, is all the while growing larger and has the distinct feature of togetherness. I’d like to believe the women will care for one another in old age too. One must simultaneously conclude there’s a greater sense of belonging than exists in the West. Since I also presuppose they’re aware of Western culture and its influences and trappings but b aren’t enticed  by it, I assume Masai culture will survive for a long time. Great video. <br /><br />As a boy I read somewhere that facing and or killing a lion with a spear was one of the challenges a young Masai warrior had to go through to adulthood.

Situation. i think they are also not very connected to the Potential of their sensuality.  unless the wives are bisexual i don&#39;t see any way to happiness here. ....<br />after a lot of research and experimenting i came to the result that the way to happiness is polyandry 💗💗💗💗 but also not in the traditional way that there are several relationships a woman had with several men. no.<br />in my conviction it should be one relationship together. the woman and her men. nobody should be excluded. also but temporary. that can be very painful for the excluded person.<br />but in an inclusive relationship it is the perfect solution 💗<br />and in the cultures that it is practiced u see smiling faces everywhere.<br /><br />i know many women who share their man with other wives and they All stuffer. they hate it. it&#39;s not the nature of a woman. <br />the nature of a woman is much more.<br />it&#39;s degrading and sad.<br />they just go along with it because they think that they have no choice.<br /><br />and by the way yeeesss they are doing fgm to them. they get parts of their genitals cut off!!!!<br />horrible culture.<br />and women are bought for cattle or sheep in many parts of the world.,soni miami,2021-03-13T17:50:21Z,0

@Michael Robb that too but even with out it we are out numbered.  Women bodies actually attacks  testosterone more aggressively with the birth of every male born from the same women.  Also this increases the likely hood of the next male being born gay.  Over time we have forgotten why the 1st male born is often heir to the throne.    A lot of things we think we&#39;re wrong was appropriate for the time.  Jacob in the bible had knowledge of genetics based on teaching he received as a goat herder. His father in law said he would be promised all the white goats for offering to God.  But to keep them white he had to inbreed them. Plus the white goats wld breed with the colored goats so in the end his father in law had no more white goats.  So it&#39;s my theory the knew a lot about breeding.  Even royal family wld try to do it was said that u CLD breed with the children of the father and not the mother.  Sometimes because of the death of the male heirs it wld be bro and sister from the same mother. Sick either way.,UGMUSIQ TV,2021-03-15T21:22:32Z,0

What a remarkable woman. She is so likeable. I think it must be possible to talk with her for days on end. About the bigamy I have my own Western opinion. But then again in the West so many people get divorced or have a relationship outside their marriage. Our way isn’t that perfect either. Living together with more wives is done in many cultures. We often forget that lots of men and women around the world don’t have the Western privilege to marry the one they love. In many places marriage is a business transaction between the parents of both spouses. Still they get on in life and can be happy. Happiness comes in many different kinds.,Lilith Eden,2021-03-13T16:27:00Z,0

Now Jesus calls multiple husbands or wives:adultery. <br />You might say &quot;I don&#39;t care about what Jesus said &quot; well according to the bible Jesus is the Almighty came through human form, if you rebel you are not coming to his kingdom.

The amount of narrow minded westerners in these comments is astounding. You see a 16 minute video and assume you’ve learned everything about their way of life.

"Cultures should be respected but this if all the people within that culture agree with it and feel happy with how things are done.<br />I do not believe any child in this world would be happy to be sold off to an older man or as an adult woman freely choosing go be with a man who just wants her by his side to have children and labour. <br /><br />The problem here is the lack of choice. If you are happy and choose to enter a marriage, as well later on accept and agree that your husband will have several wives ,then it is fine. People should be free to choose anything they want to do with their lives and not be criticized for it.<br /><br />However, that is not the case in these types of cultures. They are cultures that oppress women and make them abide by rules made by men. There are many documentaries of women who do not show their face and mask their voice where they freely and openly express how much they hate their culture and wish they could be free. From polygamy, to genital mutilation, to virginity check (some african tribes an appointed men rapes a girl child before she is married off to know if she is &quot;good&quot; for marriage), to beating and giving the wives the hard labor chores, to demanding wives have multiple children even if they feel tired of their body is not very strong anymore. <br />Well the list is endless.<br /><br />So to be honest I can&#39;t believe they are in a happy marriage. Maybe they have a happy life and love their life, but I believe that if they had a choice they would probably want a different husband or marriage system lol (well of course if they hate the husband they are more than happy with sharing him with how many wives possible so he doesn&#39;t annoy them the most).<br /><br />Also note how all the women live in separate houses instead of living in a large house with all the family members. Of course I understand this tribe operates as if the whole village is one big family so they interact with each other all the time and act as being part of a whole,  however, if this type of marital system was &quot;harmonious&quot; I believe they would be sharing a home. It also feels like the husband can choose to stay with who, getting away from one wife to be with another. Just seems like an excuse to have official mistresses.",S P,2021-03-13T09:32:58Z,0

"&quot;The degree of polygynous marriage is not extreme in cross-cultural perspective â€¦ but it creates a pool of unmarried men equal to 40% of the male population who are incentivized to take substantial risks so they can eventually participate in the mating and marriage market. This pattern is consistent with what we would expect from an evolutionary approach to humans, and with what is known empirically about male strategies. The evidence outlined below shows that the creation of this pool will likely have a number of outcomes.&quot;<br />Eva, can you please make an interview with single beta males?

"&quot;whatever you were raised with, that becomes the truth&quot; is interesting because here, that&#39;s not the truth. We have more freedom to go against the teachings of our families, because we have the free thinking to know that sometimes what our family thinks is wrong. For instance, I come from a homophobic, conservative family and yet I am LGBT. What we are taught is not always right, that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to be able to think for ourselves. When Yayai is asked about whether she can have other husbands, she laughs and says no and that they have multiple wives because that&#39;s the maasai way, it&#39;s always been their way. She has no answer other than that. I wonder if she understands that it&#39;s sexist, for her husband to be allowed to have multiple wives and yet his wives can&#39;t have more than one husband. She thinks it&#39;s jealous for us to marry only one person, but that&#39;s not always the way it is here, either. Some people do have polygamous relationships, but they try to be equal, with all partners agreeing to each other. There&#39;s also, of course, same sex and other type of couples. She thinks it would be lonely for just two people to be married, but she doesn&#39;t understand that we don&#39;t live in neighborhoods comprised of just our family, and we have cellphones to communicate with anyone we want. I&#39;m not trying to disrespect the maasai in anyway, just want to point out that there are many countries including our own where how children are raised is how they live, and that&#39;s not always right. Being shunned by your family because of who you love or how you live is awful, trust me, and I&#39;m glad that she at least accepts her daughter in law stephanie despite her differences.",Craven,2021-03-13T03:59:11Z,151
"@Craven  @Craven  You said: &quot;Therfore, it is wrong, regardless of anyone&#39;s &#39;opinion&#39;&quot;. But do you realize there is subjective opinion in there that presumes that harming children is wrong? The thing is, science cannot tell us if something is right or wrong. We may be able to establish that sexual abuse of children harms them. But what or who determines that harming children or, anyone for that matter, is right or wrong? I would certainly agree, but as we are aware not everybody thinks so. <br /><br /> The nazi&#39;s for example were all agreed that it is right to harm others for the greater good of preserving the superior man and ridding the world of genetically inferior people. I&#39;m sure we would both agree that this is wrong. But why? It&#39;s just the opinion of that group of people versus the opinion of our group of people that this is wrong. Science can measure the effects, but can&#39;t  tell you which group is morally right and which is morally wrong. <br /><br />So it is actually the contrary...it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think we can&#39;t establish what is truly right and wrong. I think that there must be a moral source beyond (differing) subjective human opinions. And I believe that God, as our creator, is that source. Only so is there a source of morality that supersedes opinion, desires and feelings. As F. Dostoevsky said... &quot;Without God everything is permissable&quot;. If mankind were random bags of DNA that happend by chance, ofcourse...there would be no one setting up the boundaries beyond mankind&#39;s own opinions, which widely differ. <br /><br />So my point was just...that Truth IS established by a objective source. And thus also the truth of the purpose for mankind in regards to the union of them in a marriage. As such I do not believe polygamy or or other forms of such union between humans is right.",Shanevan Duinkerk,2021-03-15T09:43:43Z,0
"@Shanevan Duinkerk I disagree with where your comment is going because you make it sound like there&#39;s absolutely no way of establishing what&#39;s truly right and wrong. There are definitely plenty of moral gray areas but there are definitely things that can be proven to be wrong, beyond opinion. Things based in scientific fact, such as sexual abuse of children. Children cannot consent, and that is a fact. It will traumatize them for the rest of their lives, one way or another, and that is a fact. Therefore, it is wrong, regardless of anyone&#39;s &quot;opinion.&quot;",Craven,2021-03-15T05:17:22Z,0

"It would be interesting to ask if the women ever were attracted to men other than their husband. Knowing what we know about human sexuality, it would seem to me that that would happen. Or are such attractions so repressed they never arise? If they do arise, why should the women not be free to have relations with the men they are attracted to, when their husbands do have that freedom? Or what happens to the people involved if it does happen? No question about that? No stress ever due to a woman being attracted to another man?<br /><br />Also what happens when two or more of the wives really feel a strong desire to be with the husband at the same time. Do they have group sex? Do some of them just have to sleep alone, and they don&#39;t feel any disappointment, even if not jealousy? There were lots of questions not asked. <br /><br />However, that wife number one is truly a likeable and intelligent woman. She seems happy and their relations looked comfortable and happy. It must work for them. I would think that for the European wife to expect to not feel jealousy if another wife appears would be risking denial. But each to their own and only they can really know. There are many ways to live. Important to be true to oneself though. Just because women in one culture might be able to be happy that way, does not mean that women in other cultures should expect to. Doesn&#39;t work that way. Also....we would have to be deeply embedded in the family over time to really judge these things. Anyway, very interesting video.",Laura Kelly,2021-03-13T02:20:11Z,1
"Here&#39;s something not mentioned in this video. Did this wonderful Maasai 1st mother-in-law and her co-wives, pass through the traditional Maasai coming of age ceremony of Female Genital Mutilation? If so, could this be why they do not experience jealousy? No sexual feelings, no attachments that come with orgasmic lovemaking etc...thus no jealousy. Thus the focus on the help and company, absent of jealousy? This question was not raised inn this interesting video. Too taboo to mention?",Laura Kelly,2021-03-13T17:14:02Z,0
"​@Anurag Chakraborty seems like you are personally bothered by polite discussion of interesting cultural contrasts. No one was being disrespectful or rude. Just asking sincere questions, interested in knowing how these women might feel. Your aggressive comment suggests you are triggered.. Relax.  If it truly works (making a life where people live happily without force or repression), I think it&#39;s great for them. Whatever makes people happy is ok with me.<br /><br />PS, not that you asked, but I don&#39;t happen to live in the &#39;First World&#39;. My viewpoint is from a tiny village in southern Mexico - a quite remote, poor and rural place, generally not considered First World at all. I have lived here for 30 years. My friends here, born and raised here,  think it would be hard to share a husband while not being equally free to experience other sexual partners and to not feel difficult emotions. Again, I don&#39;t doubt the sincerity of the first wife in this video. But by the aggression in your reaction it seems you feel threatened by the mere suggestion that some women, including in other cultures, might be unhappy with that style of life. &#39;Why is that threatening for you?&#39; Maybe that is a question you could ask yourself.",Laura Kelly,2021-03-13T04:25:29Z,0

"Jesus loves you very much, experience his love for you and repent before it&#39;s too late.<br /><br />(1) Romans 3:23 KJV [23] For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.<br />Q1. Do you know what Sin is?<br /><br /><br />Sin is anything bad that we have done.<br /><br />Q2. Have you sinned before?<br /><br /> Yes or No?<br /><br />(2) Revelation 21:8 KJV [8] But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.<br /><br />Because they have sinned, and God does not allow Sin into Heaven, the punishment is burning hell. <br /><br />What is the way to reconcile our peace and relationship with God?<br /><br />Q3. Do you know the Story of Jesus?<br /><br />(3) Romans 5:8 KJV [8] But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<br /><br />Jesus = God who lived up in Heaven, but he came down on earth and became a man like us, he lived for 33.5 years without committing any sin. Then there were certain people who were jealous and therefore framed him on phony charges, and crucified him. Then he was buried and resurrected on the third day; Now he lives in HEAVEN. <br /><br />Q4. Do you know why Jesus went through all this bloody mess for us?<br /><br />A4. As mentioned, our sin is the reason why we can’t go to heaven, and the only thing that can wash away our sin is the Blood of Jesus.<br /><br />(4) Romans 5:9 KJV [9] Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.<br /><br />According to the bible, the only way for us to reconcile with God is through Christ Jesus’s blood, and not through any works that we do or merits we accumulate, such as water baptism, attending church, or any good thing that we do. The following  verses clearly support this.<br /><br />(5) Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV [8] For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: [9] Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br /> (6) 2 Corinthians 7:10 KJV [10] For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.<br /><br />In order to get saved, repentance of one’s sin is needed to get saved, we need to be sorry, and repent, with conviction, that we are a wretched sinner.<br /><br />(7) Romans 10:9 KJV [9] That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<br /><br />If you truly do  believe in everything you have heard in the gospel,  ,I  strongly suggest you to make a proclamation to GOD!<br /> Repeat after this simple prayer, to make sure you  truly get saved.<br /><br />‘Dear GOD,<br />I know I am a sinner, as I repent, I put my faith, that Jesus is GOD, and that he died, buried and resurrected, so that his blood, can wash away my Sins. I put my faith in that alone to save me, not my good works. In Jesus’s holy name, I pray. Amen!<br /><br /> ‘Congratulations ! Now you are a child of God.

"There is no jealousy because the women never had a choice.  They end up forming sisterly bonds with the other wives because they only have each other.  It&#39;s survival.

"Are we really all that different?  You meet a man, marry and start having kids. Marriage breaks down but he continues to support you and your children but now has wife number two.  As he has shared custody of the kids with you, wife #2 will be looking after kids from her first marriage, her kids from this new marriage, and your kids when they have visitation. Now you marry again and have more kids, but are also looking after kids from your new husband&#39;s first marriage.  It&#39;s a lot of work, and you do it alone. And this can keep going so long as these men are able to generate the income to support all these families.<br />The key difference between what I just described and what I see here is that instead of some bitter split and fighting over resources between first wife family unit and husband#2/second wife family unit is that instead there is a cultural tradition and attitude that all these wives should get along and help each other out.  So when you are home on maternity leave (or a stay at home parent with a new child) you are not at home alone dealing with all that work, you have an extended family unit of other wives as well all sharing the work and helping out.  That and when new wives are added to the equation you don&#39;t have a bleeding of resources out to pay for divorce lawyers.  The communal wealth of this group remains in the group.<br /><br />Each wife has her own house separate from the others.  Unlike the family home she grew up in this is hers, and she is left for the most part head of that house.  And there are the shared resources of an extended community looking out for her needs.",Ian Sneddon,2021-03-12T21:47:51Z,0

Also she has the capacity to give sincere smiles to all. It doesn&#39;t mean she has lived without problems but she learned how to cope with them and grow wise. Happiness is not defined by the number of husbands or wives, by the number of cows you have.

No matter what. This doesn’t mean we can run into every culture and force them to be different, but we can certainly educate. The wife already stated that things are changing and sometimes girls can marry a man they choose. That’s because of education. They’ve been exposed to a different way to do things. People always romanticize cultures that haven’t been altered by modern society. There are some things that I do love about cultures like this. These families spend time together. They’re not sitting in front of electronics all day. They aren’t so busy trying to make more, have more, that the parents aren’t around. There are absolutely beautiful things that I think our culture could relearn to embrace.

"As a mother to both a girl and a boy (and happily married for 15 years) I would like to add my little 2 cents. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with the concept of polygamy and having a family-village style life. The only thing that I see so clearly overlook in all the comments (but simply not discussed in the video) is that apart from Stephanie, none of these girls had a choice. They were forced, at a very young age, to marry off someone both older than themselves and not of their choosing. Choice does matter, as do age. A child is a child, no matter the culture. Girls this young often die in childbirth, even more so far removed from modern medicine. Just because it is not mentioned in the video doesn&#39;t make it okay. Girls should not be traded for cows and should not be married off before they are physically able to have both sexual encounters and carry a pregnancy. Not traditions are good and worth preserving. So: yes to the culture, no to the trade and exploitation of young girls. And for the record, my husband and his family are African and do not condone this.",M B,2021-03-12T15:25:51Z,0

"Funny, I don&#39;t actually find it at all hard to understand the Masai views on wives. We actually do a similar thing in the west, we have children, we divorce, we get someone else pregnant, we part ways and before you know it, we&#39;ve had three wives and a dozen kids! The sad part is we rarely choose to do it in love, and instead inject spite, hate and cruelty into the &quot;battles of the ex&#39;s&quot;.

"I love learning about new cultures, I find it fascinating to get a glimpse of their beliefs and how others live their day to day lives. I know many will disagree with me (especially being a white woman from the West) but to hear that an 11-12 yr old girl is being sold off to marry a man in his 40&#39;s who may already have 2-3 wives makes me feel sad. Just because she has her period does not mean she is ready to marry and bust out 6 kids. But at the same time, I know my opinion means nothing and will absolutely not change anything... For the most part I just wanted to say I see beautiful happy content children in these videos and even taking in a 2nd and 3rd or 4th wife is great if that is what they want...i just think the little pre-teen girls should  be given more time..  often it&#39;s the parents of the girl who need the dowry to get by and see their daughters as a way out of poverty. I&#39;m not judging in any way... These are just my observations and opinions. I married a Yoruba man and adapted quickly to the customs, and traditions.. But they are not as extreme as the Massai either. African culture does not in any way effect the day to day life of us Westerners, so let them do them and respect it or dont respect it... Either way our opinions won&#39;t change their ways, nor should it. To all who took the time to read this, I wish you a blessed day",henessy3022,2021-03-12T14:32:42Z,0

"WOW these comments....&quot;She should have 3 husbands as well&quot;....it&#39;s not that easy people. It&#39;s not about what&#39;s &quot;fair&quot; but rather tradition, family structure/hierarchy and above all else HOW YOU CAN PROVIDE AND BUILD FOR YOUR FAMILY. A man could not have 3 wives if he weren&#39;t able to support and take care of them as a family unit. Flipping it and crying for the wife to have 3 husbands (which some tribes do, do your homework) but it&#39;s primarily about tradition and what you can provide for. In tribes that are patriarchal, yes, they look to the man to provide for them and it is a luxury to have multiple wives, but don&#39;t think for a second that it is &quot;easy&quot; the man has to work 3X as hard.",chocotastic1,2021-03-12T14:09:44Z,0
"Even though I don&#39;t agree with the practice, I can sort of understand the acceptance of multiple wives. Not so much the no choice part. But, think about it this way. Here in &quot;Western&quot; culture, we have a problem with men staying faithful. We have a problem with men trying to forcibly take what they want whenever they want.  This culture sort of forces the man to be a man. It allows him to have as many choices in women as he wants, visit whichever one/all he chooses. But! He has to provide them with shelter, land, protection and a means for food. I know wealthy women who settle for much worse. (look at Oprah and Stedman&#39;s relationship) My aunt in Jersey had the same situation for years. Many of them KNOW who their spouse is cheating with and don&#39;t care. My grandfather who was born in Arkansas moved his family and his mistress (and kids) up here to Cleveland Ohio. He had a full set of 8 kids with the mistress as well as the 9 he had with my grandmother. The kids played together and lives around the corner from each other and no one knew anything until my grandfather died. Again, I&#39;m not saying that I agree with it, but who am I to judge them because it&#39;s not something I would do. Just saying.",Sharon Dortch,2021-03-12T14:08:19Z,0

Most people just care about their largely romanticised idea of love which barely lasts and comes with greater pain that they don&#39;t care to question why these women seem content with their lives , the problem is we look down on them because we think we&#39;re exposed and better than them because we didn&#39;t have to be forced but the truth is we should learn what the origin of marriage is in the first place and WHY people got married, maybe then the majority of you will learn why your marriages don&#39;t work out and it won&#39;t be shocking if you find that marriages aren&#39;t working because people no longer get married for the real purpose it was created, people now get married for love and expect to still get the same results.

"I do think women (and men perhaps) are isolated by the lack of loving connection and dynamic between and from 2 parents or even one parent only... and the house house house shop shop shop styling of life is certainly encroaching on the nature of life to it&#39;s extinction. So every way we can learn to live closer to the earth in time to change for the better and healthier, the better and healthier we can be. My experience as a child of two parents who pretended happy family to such an extent that all of us were hiding miserableness all over the place and within ourselves that it was just horrible. I never felt confident or secure to become a mother as a result and really tried to care for any children who reminded me of my own unhappy childhood. The isolation and pain for me was a no brainer.... a no brainer to have children without enough connection with other healthy humans and environment... so I really think this film shows one of many ways we can live more intelligently to be connected with love and with nature.... Children need a village. There is the key... how we form a village or network of health and happiness.. where enough is enough... that takes unravelling of so much addiction and that needs restraint, love, respect, and deep understanding through connection. Most of us would run a mile at that is my guess... and we will keep raising emergencies in memories of those in our childhoods until we unravel and realize enough to allow healthier children and ways to take the leading roles again. There are a lot of sick people and networks in our so called western world and women who can choose to have babies or not can be very good leaders if they love the children they have along with the village of healthy loving people around them is my view. Men need to take a break from thinking they are men or fathers just because they can make a baby in 3 seconds.<br />I mean this is the most tragic thinking of all... and women who think motherhood is ok for them or children when there is not enough people or time or nature for their children need to do a rethink and feel the reality of what they are oking in terms of their creativity is my view. If more people loved children already here and helped out with them, the ego driven parenting might be pared back a bit and children would grow up happier and more connected with happiness and health.",karate,2021-03-12T11:12:03Z,0

"So again, some white  people is investigating and exploring and explaining Africa. Nothing new here. &quot;Look! Look how strange and different and exotic these black people are. Come let us explore them and then perhaps we can get a thesis out of it. Let us explain how these people live and what they are.&quot; There are many different ways to live life. Just because it is not the western/US way does not mean that it is strange or odd or bad or misogynist or anything. What is  &quot;truly be in love&quot;? Like something from a movie or novel? A western movie or novel? How much happiness does western kind of true love bring? For how long? Plenty of sadness and despair and divorce. My father has three wives. My uncles and grandfathers and all of them have more than one wife. Of course there is jealousy sometimes. And other things that are not 100% happiness. But that is life.  Arranged marriage is not bad always either. You  white westerners marry for what you believe is true love and then your romantic dream fall into pieces and you divorce. Just be humble when you meet or hear about other cultures and other ways of life. Because you do not understand. Just just do not.

People seem to be confused. Polygamy is a particular marriage style that means one man with multiple wives. Polyandry means one woman with multiple husbands. These women married a man who practiced polygamy. You wouldn’t marry a monogamous man and then want external relationships because monogamy doesn’t allow for it. It is the same here. People are looking at this from their own cultural perspective and not the one being shown.,iris shalurhad,2021-03-12T07:20:48Z,0

"I find it sadly curious that people keep saying&quot;there&#39;s no jealousy because there&#39;s no real love&quot;.  Love isn&#39;t jealous.  Even in the Christian definition of love, there is not jealousy. <br /><br />&quot;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.&quot;<br /><br />Love, real love, does not breed jealousy.  Greed does.  Insecurity does.  Infatuation does.  But not love.<br /><br />Love is respect.  Love is not simply &#39;romance&#39; but a meeting of minds with common ground and a willingness to learn and compromise. <br /><br />It&#39;s sad that the woman in this video had to come to love through a trial of being frightened and alone and unable to make choices for herself, and she should definitely have been allowed to make those choices for herself.  But it should be said that there is something to be joyful about, in knowing that she believes that she has had a happy life.  That, by HER definition of it, not ours, she has found love, not just with her husband but with his other wives, as well.<br /><br />Is this true for all polygamous marriages?  Of course not.<br /><br />Is this true for all Masai marriages?  Of course not.<br /><br />But we belittle this amazing woman by judging what she says and the life that she leads, by enforcing upon her our definition of &#39;love&#39;.",Hime Neko Yin,2021-03-12T05:37:52Z,0

"In a book I read for 6th grade, it was about a girl&#39;s travel from Mozambique to Zimbabwe. Before her travel it showed that her childhood was not great (her perspective, which is different than the one in this video), and because it was not great and she was dealing with the &quot;toxicity&quot; and jealousy of the other wives, she fled the situation. (The details are blurry and a bit lost, but it was a good read) This was the image I had of multiple-wives marriages.<br /><br />As for the perspective I gain from this video, and kinda opposed to the other comments, I&#39;d say I understand it. It&#39;s not a bad way of living. They seem happy truly and that&#39;s great. And I want to think deeper about how all of what any group of people learns is not right nor wrong. It&#39;s taught, which makes me wonder why must it be taught, and how things would be if what we are taught was nonexistent. <br />I do like the progressiveness of the western culture, and I personally don&#39;t see myself getting in a polygamous relationship, but also with being asexual, I don&#39;t have the expectation of finding one soulmate for a monogamous relationship that lasts.

Islam also allows a man to marry four women but there are some he needs to be follows.... If he marries more than one wife then each wife should same kind of respect and each wife&#39;s stake in husband&#39;s belonging has to be same.... If you&#39;re already have 1 wife you wants to marry another woman then you have to seek permission from the first wife as well.... There many more things I don&#39;t it can be said in just a short and simple comment.... My point is that when people gets to know about polygamy of any other religion they start to make videos on it in a positive way and when they know about Polygamy in Islam they kind of try to oppose it and banned it without knowing the true reason behind it.....,Aamir Khan,2021-03-12T05:06:00Z,0
She laughed and for her was a big <b>no</b> the idea of a woman having more than one husband (and is kinda ironic that in the west its kinda the same thing like a man with multiple women is seen as good  or not as bad as if it was a woman) .

"It&#39;s one way for the women to be able to talk and be heard when they live with co-wives working together for their family&#39;s prosperity.  However, it seems quite insulating which can be good or bad depending on the attitude of each wife. No jealousy?  I question that. The extreme conditions of living off the land real does require a group working together to survive. In cities where food, land and wealth can be attained by each individual, this would rarely work well.",Michele Tambunan,2021-03-12T04:16:44Z,34

Happiness is, in a sense, acceptance; being able to reconcile with reality and enjoy a productive life with those around you can certainly make you happy. But I think it&#39;s very telling that the younger generation doesn&#39;t want this. I think it&#39;s also very telling that once women have options, they almost always--no matter which culture--stop willingly participating in these sorts of marriage traditions, which necessarily objectify women (trading women, choosing for women) and give men more freedom/choices.",caitlin victoria,2021-03-14T01:35:32Z,1

As it is even in modern times people of color even when they are the majority demographic like in south Africa are statistically higher risk even medically due to prejudices bias and related. The term firepower is generally used to refer to firearms or at least weapons. Historically people of color when compared to whites have had less to no access to firearms or weapons of the area and time period and yet over time we see that they, despite their oppression from whites, have risen to be more and more &quot;on the same level&quot; as whites and afforded more of the same opportunities and rights as a white person and the same historically for women&#39;s rights despite being the on average smaller or weaker sex in basic anatomy women also managed to obtain the same rights as a man.",AceLovesDIYs Christopher,2021-03-16T12:05:14Z,0

She wasn&#39;t miserable. She didn&#39;t seem concerned for her children. She doesn&#39;t want to change her situation it seems. She seems happy and proud of her culture and way of life. And WE need to respect that. <br /><br />It doesn&#39;t matter AT ALL if you understand it, approve of it, like it, hate it, or whatever. And it&#39;s not your place to &quot;fix&quot; them. It&#39;s not your place to provide them with your &quot;morals&quot;. It&#39;s not okay to shove your western ideas, technogical advancements, and modern life on another culture. Humans are incredibly diverse and nuanced creatures. Your culture and language affect what you think and how you CAN think. <br /><br />Stephanie has said in a couple videos that when you speak to them in their own language, it becomes much clearer why and how they life the way they do. How they speak in their own language is how they think. Getting a translation into english doesn&#39;t do these people justice which is why it&#39;s so important that we listen and not project our own ideas onto them because the western way of life is &quot;better&quot;.",audrave,2021-03-12T01:45:45Z,280

"We believe in one wife per marriage, at least one at a time! Our divorce rates are high in United States. In Masai culture, the husband who tires of his wife as she ages just brings home another one, but still keeps the first wife, or two. Now that&#39;s marital security! Most divorced women in US end up poorer than the man after a divorce, and struggle as single parents, and have to depend on the child support that they don&#39;t always get. She may remarry and her new husband may mistreat her children with her first husband. That won&#39;t happen in Masai culture. And the co-wives always have each to share in childcare and chores.

"I enjoyed the story, thanks to Yayai sharing it! But I didn&#39;t enjoy the narrative and all these quote on quotes. It&#39;s interesting how this polygamy is cheered around cultures as Masai, but look down in some, for example, Muslim cultures? Why? Because we already know way too much about arranged marriages of kids, abuse etc. Polygamy as it&#39;s these days out for discussion on the &quot;west&quot; is about any gender choosing any gender with consent of all parties (age plays important role too). Which this is certainly not. The problem here isn&#39;t Yayai or Masai who live like that. Problem are people who show such stories with clear message behind, that west is blind and not accepting enough, living in a box. Masai should be able progress or not, as they like without anyone telling them what they should do. But this is not okay and not the way anyone should be misleading others into not realising what&#39;s behind. I understand that filming this was existing, heartwarming people around who welcome you..

"I&#39;m going to start off saying that I&#39;m neither a proponent of a monogamous marriage nor of a polygamous marriage. From what I see is that Yayai has found a way to be happy in a situation she had no control over. Her life was very isolating and lonely with just her husband, whom she did not like. To have a &quot;co-wife&quot; meant having a friend who had to go through what you went through. That you&#39;re not alone in misery. It appears that Maasai women find comfort in having friends that cannot leave, along with dedicating their lives to their children and grandchildren. They cannot understand monogamous marriages because that&#39;s not how things are, (or were) it&#39;s more about finding a way to be happy. To find your own slither of freedom in a situation you have no control over. Of course she doesn&#39;t mind her husband being with another woman, she doesn&#39;t even like him. (E.g. imagine that one person that&#39;s interested in you. However, you don&#39;t reciprocate, so if they go after someone else it&#39;s a relief.) That&#39;s probably how she feels, having intercourse with someone you dislike isn&#39;t fun. You just want the interaction to end or better yet, be directed at someone else. That&#39;s how she lives, that&#39;s her normal. <br /><br />I think here in the West, people forget that their ability to chose their spouse and only just have that spouse is a privilege. Because the reason a lot of these cultures have multiple wives,(but not husbands) is because the society is male dominated and the women look happy living this way because there is no alternative for them , they can&#39;t choose another path, so they have to find happiness in what they can.",My More Noble Pursuits,2021-03-11T21:11:51Z,0

"Yes, because she was given by her father to him. Also its a matter of survival. Less chores, also care for children, more children( so they can give daughters and in exchange get cattle as a price). In western societies, most asian as well, people are not pushed that much in order to survive. People can do what they want, but lets not act like its better than being faithful to one person you love and care for. I dont judge the way Massai have been living. They have the right to do so, but there is the reason why they live like this. Main reason is lack of technological advancements , job opportunities, education for both boys and girls. There is a contrast between the villages and citites in Tanzania. People change the habits, when they are in better situation. 😊😘",Zolo Osso,2021-03-12T13:19:53Z,6
Yeah it&#39;s all nice till u realise that her spouse is basically a glorified friend that is allowed to pop in whenever he wants to get laid and she has to just go with it. Or that she&#39;s a living baby maker with no rights as a human being. And that the no jealousy comes from a place where her husband is a complete stranger with no real attachments to each other and their marriage is more of an arrangement. An arrangement based on benefiting him exclusively no less.,AceLovesDIYs Christopher,2021-03-12T12:39:14Z,7

Polyamorous relationship is common in some parts of the world, and even some Westerners are adopting into it, but it&#39;s kinda unfair when women can&#39;t have the same privilege because that&#39;s what they were thought growing up.",Random Commenter,2021-03-11T17:03:58Z,0

"I mean it’s not like they really have a choice in the first place. If they had the choice to marry who they want and truly love I’m sure they will. It’s not Unnatural to have one soulmate, for it’s found in many species to only want one as a mate for the rest of it’s life. Humans are naturally possessive creatures , so jealousy to an extent is an normal emotion from birth , animals usually kill any form of competition. You can say it’s for survival , but can also argue that’s what family generations are for. <br /><br />They’re Basically putting up what’s been prepared/ laid out for their whole life. Do you think if they experience freedom young and choice, would they still want to marry a men with multiple women ? Probably or probably not... idk",kitty dollsXo,2021-03-11T16:55:31Z,0
"Sad but the MAIN reasons why theyre okay with multiple wives is a. because they were ripped away from their family and only home theyve ever known so they literally have nothing else and know nothing else. b. They really dont seem to have ANY friends; the co wives and their  children are the only &quot;friends&quot; they have so no wonder theyre more okay with it. c. They dont understand that western cultures dont NEED to have multiple wives to make multiple kids for the purpose of selling them off to make the family richer in the first place. d. The most backwards part is if they believe having multiple parents is a good thing then why cant a woman take multiple husbands too, whats the difference?",Brittany Daniels,2021-03-11T16:53:55Z,0

"I feel sorry for this woman and for everyone involved. It&#39;s like they were raised in a system where something abnormal is normal, so they think it&#39;s better. I&#39;ve seen this many times before, where a foreign culture appears as a new and novel thing to Westerners, but it&#39;s actually worse, because it&#39;s based on unnatural laws and in various inequalities or transgressions. But you know, she said her story with a smile, so that bypassed a lot of people&#39;s filters and went straight to their hearts. Quite a good way to program minds already under attack in the Western world from pornography and deteriorating culture and its standards regarding all things, including relations between men and women.<br /><br />Both Stephanie and Eva are naive in the way they think about this whole matter. Esp. Stephanie, who states that the Western way is just a system and not the only one - well of course it&#39;s not the only one. But has she considered that the Massai way is also a system, and not necessarily a better one at all. It&#39;s like she discovered a different system and somehow that discovery alone is what makes it somehow a higher value of life that&#39;s somehow no longer a system but &quot;the truth&quot;? That&#39;s an illogical way of thinking. Aspects of their culture are more respectful of nature, that is true, but she herself admits that other aspects are far from balanced. So to say that &quot;there is no single answer to what a good marriage should be&quot;, that&#39;s what humans say who do not know God&#39;s instructions for marriage, instructions already present with humanity for 3 millennia, and prior to that within the righteous. &quot;Every culture has its own version&quot; - that is precisely the problem. People are following their own flawed/short-sighted templates of marriage, and not God&#39;s long-sighted template - the very One who created marriage for greater purposes than most realize.",Observer Of Life,2021-03-11T14:41:02Z,2

Your idea of a good life isn&#39;t THE idea of a good life. Would it be better if she realized all of a sudden that her life is horrible and she&#39;d be better off divorcing and living in the city with a modern life? No, not necessarily. Life is incredibly multi faceted and her day to day happenings with her husband might be a minor part of her life compared to the other friendships and familial relationships she has. What keeps her with the Masai clearly runs deep. Whether it&#39;s loyalty, tradition, family, children, or whatever that makes her happy and content to continue their tribal ways, let her! No way of life is without it&#39;s detrimental flaws. Take it from me whose parents lived the ultimate American dream and it never made them happy enough to quit drinking.

I agree with Yayai that sharing love with many is better ,a big family would be a blessing and when she said &quot;we are many&quot; I wished I could be a part of that kind of life. Maybe i&#39;m more open minded to something like this because I have never been married so I don&#39;t have a set ideology of marriage. P. S. I seen Stephanie&#39;s YouTube video telling her story when she posted it, such a beautiful love story. Yayai her husband co wives and children also have a beautiful love story!

"No jealousy because no feelings are involved in marriage relationships. Take note that marriage is arranged. <br />Also, only men are allowed to have wives, women has only one husband. <br />Because of media, young people see what it means boy-girl relationship in the modern world and they start to discover the force of emotion within them.  They don&#39;t anymore want a polygamous marriage because of the affective bond they have discovered, which causes jealousy.",MA Tolentino,2021-03-10T22:56:16Z,0

Basically the sole reason a co-wife is a good thingis because having lots if offspring gives one status according to this last lady. The other benefit of companionship and sharing of resourced and help is something a friend can do.

"Yes coz her marriage is an arrangement of a man being allowed to bang her whenever he wants to benefit him alone. It&#39;s not even a friendship it&#39;s an ownership. Why would a toothbrush be jealous of a sock? Or be jealous for her owner coz the owner uses the sock. The toothbrush (first wife) and the sock (second wife) are both objects being used for someone else&#39;s benefit so there&#39;s no need to be jealous. Jealousy comes from a place of insecurity but neither have worth in the first place as human beings, only as objects, so there&#39;s no insecurity and no jealousy. Problem solved. Let&#39;s just all be objects for the benefit of someone else so we don&#39;t have jealousy.",AceLovesDIYs Christopher,2021-03-12T12:47:55Z,0

The way these white women are glorifying this culture where males are dominant and women are subservient and considered property is kind of disgusting. Granted these women all seem happy but that’s simply because they do not know any better. They are not free to leave nor would ever have the means to and they are forced into this lifestyle from the time they have their first period. From what I can gather based on these videos the women do all the work and are the reason the community even exists! Not exactly sure what the male contributes other than making a bunch of kids that everybody else seems to take care of. They don’t have any jealousy because they don’t really have any love and attraction there. They are forced into marriage so they don’t know any better. Not sure why anyone would think this life was so great if they had a choice.,Doll Faced Beauty,2021-03-10T21:29:26Z,0

"The whole animal kingdom is based on the male having multiple mates and create multiple offspring. Someone is going to mention the rare times it&#39;s different but we are talking about the general attitude of nature. In lions, gorillas even when breeding domestic animals such as cows, the farmer will choose the best male and breed it with many females. <br /><br />In humans, the alpha males, whether by wealth, status or physique.. will attract more females and able to reproduce or at least mate with them. Only when it comes to marriage is it now expected to be strictly in a monogamous relationship. And the western culture is now making more and more men stay away from marriage and just enjoy the milk without buying the cow. <br /><br /><br />Here&#39;s an observation too you might want to look at. Most men (remember I said most men) almost 95% are naturally polygamous. In cultures that allow it, then they&#39;ll marry multiple wives. In cultures that don&#39;t allow it then they&#39;ll either cheat and have affairs or they&#39;ll live a miserable unhappy life.

"The reason why polygamist in the US are so secretive is because people have made polygamy illegal in many states so then the mothers don’t report actual sexual abuse because if they do they could loose their children on account of they let their husband marry another woman and they were not jealous enough to rip the family apart. I know people who grew up knowing that they were a secret because they had more than one mother. Some children called their father Uncle and their other mothers Aunt because if people found out then they might never see their family again. If you want to “free women from polygamy “ Then you don’t understand it. Women fight against laws that forbid plural marriage, sometimes I wish my husband would get married again because I like that lifestyle even with its challenges. I don’t like that children grow up as secrets, that kind of thing leads to people not being able to get help of any kind when they need help. The government should have no place in marriage because it doesn’t concern them. You marry who you want to.

Is Stephanie too ready for her hubby to marry again a second wife since she has adapted the masai culture  ?,Reshmi agrawal,2021-03-10T18:05:39Z,2
She has stated in previous interviews that she wouldn&#39;t want her husband to marry another person and her husband respects that for now because they love each other. However I wonder if they would have to agree to do that at the end because the family is pressuring them to have more children.,Maricela TS,2021-03-14T00:34:17Z,1

"The man was stupid.... Allowed to marry as many times and drink as well..yet she called him a good man.

She saw no other way of how her life could be better. But I&#39;m glad she said that nowadays generation does not like that custom of marriage. I&#39;m sure they must have definitely seen the dark side of the whole thing..whatever this woman tried to hide from us ,..n that is the reason nowadays the kids don&#39;t want to follow the culture of the  so called CO WIVES ...

Well coz i don&#39;t want myself and other women to be breathing baby makers for a man to elevate his status in the community. I would want a partnership not an ownership that requires work and commitment instead of this which has no work to maintain the relationship coz there is none. This is a couple of strangers where one is allowed to get laid whenever he wants. She&#39;s so happy coz she has everything in her life figured out. Why? Because her only option was to be a wife and mother. What struggle is there when that&#39;s ur only option. It&#39;s an ownership. Maybe if i want to get married I want to have a partnership where I bring everything I have to a relationship and they do the same and we work at it together. Not as two halves that only work together but as 2 wholes join together because we want to be together. But hey maybe I&#39;m just crazy to want to be more than a wife and mother and have basic rights as a human being.,AceLovesDIYs Christopher,2021-03-12T13:01:00Z,0

"I see many people in the comments saying this is wrong or wtv and I just wonder, why do we in the west always have to see things in a dichotomy - black or white, right or wrong? Specially in a situation where the information we are getting is through a white westerner lens, even the way things are translated affects the way we perceive it. There are many differences in the way Western society and this tribe work, ancient differences that made us have different thought processes and ideals. I understand that many things in this video might cause outrage and feel unfair, but we don&#39;t know the history and specially how the tribes practices where affected by the western world, the invasions of white ppl in Africa and many other things that would have to be carefully evaluated by historians and anthropologists.<br />I once read a book &quot;Spirit of intimacy&quot; by Sobonfu Somé that describes the philosophies and practices of a tribe in the Burkina Faso area and she&#39;s from a tribe and later in life lived in the west, so she is better suited to transmit the information accurately so we can understand. althought it&#39;s distant from Tanzania, one insight I took from that book is that even tribes that &quot;stick to their traditions&quot; get affected by the poisonous colonizer&#39;s thought and practices. and many tribes&#39; practices that once had purer meanings, rooted in community and the well being of everyone where corrupted by materialistic thought and such. for example, something that was later known as the dowry in that tribe, once had a purpose of sharing something with the whole community, had spiritual implications, ... The arranged marriage too, has a link to the tribe&#39;s spirituality and practices. <br />it&#39;s VERY easy to come and critique these tribes. but I think it&#39;s really untasteful especially with the &quot;this is wrong!!&quot; stance. It&#39;s the way ppl are living and we have to respect it. and honestly, the western viewpoint on this is highly questionable. <br /><br />ALSO, in Cheikh Anta Diop&#39;s book &quot;civilization or barbarism&quot; he mentions the concept of polygamy in the sense that the husband has many wives, and that was because it made sense for the survival and thriving of the whole community, since there were many more women than man. People shared, and maybe with the passing of years the reasons for the man-with-many-wives but no wife-with-multiple-husband were lost but  instead of just judging we should think of the reasons behind things and often the original reasons were very plausible and the intentions were distorted with time and with the colonizers perspective of individualism and the persistent anti-blackness that affects these narratives. <br /><br />I&#39;m not saying that African tribes are perfect, no one is. BUT to come at this like &quot;this is wrong! that is not love!&quot; and stuff like that is.... dumb? do you imagine the extent of the difference in how things are perceived? the different culture it is?<br />the way we are brainwashed to think we are always in the right and other cultures (specially African cultures) are wrong shows.",Laima Barros,2021-03-10T16:27:32Z,0

"I saw a series about another African way of living.  It was monogamous marriage for both sexes.  However, everyone seemed incredibly tolerant of extramarital relations.  Sometimes some of the men left for more than a year at a time to hunt, barter, etc.  Often when they got back there would be a new baby in his household which they accepted as normal. Elderly people were looked after.  There are lots of alternative ways of organising life but when one section of a community dominates, exploits, commits violence towards another, it&#39;s just wrong.",Patsi G,2021-03-10T16:02:48Z,0

"I am 37 and have a child. A few of my female friends in the same situation and I have been talking about the concept of several wives. To us, it makes a lot of sense. I love my husband more than anything jn the world. But the business of childraising is one that is best conducted among several women. In what way exactly that would be accomplished is a cultural question.  But on a practical level, sister  wives make raising a child so much easier.",pe to,2021-03-10T14:10:14Z,0

"The husband is way older than the wives , do they find him attractive? .  I can see her point re communal living, company and burden sharing but I personally am not hung up on western ideas of romantic life but I more object to women being property and essentially used to sell to make the family wealthy. It’s objectionable to me that a man can build up lots of wives to copulate with (is it that too?) basically whilst women have to accept being one of many who’s going to be passed on? Their life is rich in many ways so they still see, happy. . But the culture and lifestyle differences with us and an ancient tribe are vast.  It’s Arguable that a community can still thrive in similar circumstances without this form of poloygamy and what happens to all the men who can’t get wives with this ratio of 3:1? Who knows what ancient tribes in Britain were doing re marriage and daughters",Dreamingofmeadows,2021-03-10T14:01:36Z,1

"There way of life is much more sensible, realistic, than in western culture.  Look at all the problems that western marriages have.  All brought about because of childish jealousy, unkindness, selfishness, unwillingness  to work together for the benefit of family.  Western society looks at marriage as something for sex, rather than all the other more important  facets of the things in day to day living.  And the obvious proof of which system is better is, which one works out to be more beneficial and lasting. The answer is obvious. It&#39;s not modern western marriage.  Look at the marriages in bible times. They had multiple wives.  And it worked because it was beneficial to everyone.  Especially the children. Western marriages are miserable for so many, because all the hardship is placed on so few.  Rather than allowing more family to lighten the burden.",Spartaeus,2021-03-10T13:45:29Z,0

No I don&#39;t believe that bad parts of certain cultural practice are ok such as female genital mutilation or teen girls being married off to men twice/thrice their age and I am not afraid to say that.

"I would like to point out that this was not the original way of the Maasai culture. In precolonial times it was a polyandrous community. Romance was not synonymous to relationships. <br /><br />Marriage was a socioeconomic and political tool to empower the family unit. Women were also involved in rejecting or choosing a marriage partner as it would affect her standing in society. Extra martial relationships were allowed, the only requirement was that one was expected to choose a casual partner in the same age group as their spouse. The wives were responsible to vet out potential co-wives. In a way the whole marriage was like a business partnership where people were chosen  based on their strengths and compatibility. Women brought in wealth and homestead management whereas the men provided security and acted as liaisons for the family unit. <br /><br />With the invasion of the explorers and colonialists. This mindset shifted to a more oppressive approach towards the female&#39;s control over such affairs. Family units that went against the patriarchy were shunned by others who did not want to jeopardize the new founded relationship with the westerners. With time the Maasai women lost their independence.<br /><br />But times have changed and as mentioned the Maasai women have slowly gained back the control over the homestead.<br /><br />Yayai grew up in a time where male children were the only ones privy to an education and access to the outside world hence gained opportunities to finances and political influence. <br /><br />In today&#39;s society the girls get equal opportunity and run most of the tourist programs and ranch management while the men join wildlife protective programs and political groups to protect their indigenous culture. In a sense their heading back to their original roots where women run the homestead and the man protects the integrity of the homestead.<br /><br />Ps. This information is widely taught in our history classes and at heritage locations in Kenya and Tanzania. Make a point of popping to get a clear picture. In many communities  the African concept of gender had no inferior or superior tags, the west just assumed we did and enforced the ideology on us.",Being K,2021-03-10T13:05:21Z,0

The one man was there to provide children, and meat/ income outside of what the women could earn/farm.

"The way I see it they don’t feel jealous because they don’t have much of a choice. They have to like it or like it and if they don’t the jealousy’s or rebellion will only hurt themselves. So they have to learn to live with the situation in peace. Can this woman divorce if she wants? I don’t think so. And where would she go and what would she do if she did have the right to divorce? What would her value be in her culture or community if she divorced? It’s a matter of survival. These are the rules and those who obey and follow order will have a good, protected life. That’s the issue. Here in Europe, I can divorce and still be great without my husband.  I have my education and my job in hand. I wont have any loss other than heartbreak.

All the violence in the world occurs when there are fewer resources than people, so any practice that leads to explosion of population is out-dated and not sustainable ecologically.

I found the idea of his naked body touching mine appalling. 60 is old.<br />I wonder what are you basing sexual value on. Women, I can understand, it&#39;s almost pure biology but 38 for men? Some are already aging, balding, have less energy at that age. I think you mean general value to the opposite sex, which for men includes wealth. Men are usually of higher status and wealth when they are older. That might make them attractive matches because of the security and life they can offer, but not necessarily sexually attractive. I guess 38 is a good middle ground between being successful and still looking good, but in very few cases will an 18 year old girl find a man over 40 actually sexually attractive.",Evija3000,2021-03-18T19:31:30Z,0

Living with a lot of ppl has its ups and downs, for instance there were no secrets or privacy, our economy wasn&#39;t that good, and when we were kids our older cousin was a bully (to all the little children in the house). When we came to USA (utah) the economy got better, much better, there was privacy, and a lot of silence since everyone was working and nobody was around, I could be in the phone all day if I wanted to (before I couldn&#39;t bc my auts wouldn&#39;t let me), if I bought something I didn&#39;t had to share my food (there were too many people in the house, so If u had something u have to shared it with everyone) and could eat all I wanted since junk food is cheap...idk which is better, but at least back then it was so noisy and there were so many ppl that u didn&#39;t really had the time or energy to be depressed",yosselyn riquelme,2021-03-10T03:47:05Z,1

"@Baroness von Rat I see what you mean. And your situation surrounding Swedish meatballs and Semla(sounds delicious btw) doesn&#39;t sound petty to me. I think food is part of what makes a certain place &quot;home&quot; if that makes any sense. Sitting down and eating a local meal can be a very warm experience. Especially if you have childhood memories of eating that food. Maybe even your family making that food. If the media is falsely telling you that the food is not a part of your home, it can be a form of psychological warfare in my opinion.<br /><br />As a Filipino-American, I&#39;m well aware that everything has &quot;origins&quot; from somewhere else. Both the U.S. and the Philippines are colonial nations with colonial cultures. We are young countries compared to other parts of the world. Both countries are basically an amalgamation of different ideas from different places. Its a lot more obvious in colonial countries that things &quot;come from somewhere else&quot;. But isn&#39;t that literally every country ever? Japan has a ton of Confucian and Buddhist culture that originates from ancient China, Korea, and India. But does that make Japanese culture NOT Japanese culture? No. Because they made it their own. Its called &quot;integration&quot;. Every culture can integrate things from outside, and make it uniquely a part of their own culture. <br /><br />This should be pretty obvious. But as you know, the media will spin it as a narrative of things being stolen from other countries. Its more of a psychological trick than anything. It preys off of peoples&#39; deeply rooted shame. Shame that is likely originating from some personal aspect of their lives, but is being scapegoated onto their culture and even race.",Awake Now,2021-03-25T17:01:32Z,0

"who ever said that there is that &quot;one&quot; answer for marriage and love?

I wonder what would happen given other circumstances - like not leaving your home behind, having other additional support and income sources, or cannot or does not want to have children... I guess a lot. I am pretty sure there is at least one woman who wants several husbands? what about that? what about homosexuality? etc. it is not that free and sweet as it might seem, just as &quot;our&quot; concept isn&#39;t... this woman&#39;s concept of love is not many, it is many wifes and one guy. how does she know &quot;our&quot; way is &quot;only&quot; between two people? it might not be or is not in another way than she thinks... and the last question would be: why does he drink a bit too much ;)! anyway, all the best to all fo them...",Nat Ju,2021-03-09T23:25:17Z,1

@Jon Lamar &quot;Nature won&#39;t allow?!&quot; Human beings do what the hell they want to do and invent their lives to fit the circumstances. There are matriarchal cultures and those where women have many husbands - it&#39;s about whose in control - who is the center of power that determines what &quot;marriage&quot; and &quot;family&quot; is. In western culture it was not about &quot;romance&quot; - it was about the exchange and control of property. That&#39;s why in our traditional wedding ceremonies the father gives the daughter away. Even in nature there are species where procreative power is not in the male. Look at bees. You&#39;ve got one queen being serviced by hundreds of males producing hundreds of bees. If she dies they all do. They are subserviant to her and she&#39;s recognized as the source of life. And there are species where the male carries and nurtures the eggs. Nature has many mysteries that don&#39;t fit our limited script.,Florence deBear,2021-03-12T06:28:53Z,4

I would probably agree with them if I lived there and If I was educated to be and to endure and to numb it till it disappears, such as a natural instinct like jealousy.. I don&#39;t understand them fully, but as long as it doesn&#39;t involve me and they&#39;re not injured and unhappy then I&#39;m fine and indiferent to their decisions and life style, as long as they are free and mature enough to make that decision..

"I can tell you exactly why I don&#39;t do polygamy and it has nothing to do with religion or beliefs.  Not every woman is like this woman, softly spoken, not jealous, and I like how I clean and take care of things.  I also understand that not all women are going to be honest about where they have been and who they have been with.  I would rather not get crotch rot, it&#39;s a bad enough risk in hoping your husband doesn&#39;t play the field.  I also do not enjoy how most women raise their children.  Imagine living in a home where you have to learn to cope with a woman that you absolutely cannot stand.  I would like to live my life in relative peace and harmony.  That being said, I believe if polygamy works for you or that you believe it can work for you, then go for it.  But, in the US, it&#39;s banned.  You can live in polyamory, but not in polygamy.  It should have never been banned to begin with and the ban should have long ago been lifted.",Cheyenne Life,2021-03-09T18:56:29Z,0

"The Savior Complex is strong in these comments... as if a group of people living in this way for hundreds, or thousands, of years cannot understand or decide what is best for their own culture. It was even said by the first wife that things are changing, and young people are opting to marry for love. Perhaps she doesn&#39;t &quot;love&quot; her husband in the traditional sense, but it is clear that she loves her family, and her life, so let&#39;s appreciate that, since so many don&#39;t have it.",Holly Golightley,2021-03-09T17:09:05Z,0

Shared love and property, no jealousy, that is valuable and hard to achieve for us! <br /><br />What makes me cringe is the girls being married off against their will. The sexual encounters under such circumstances are probably not enjoyable to say the least. <br />Right and wrong may be subjective but the experience of being forced to do this can&#39;t be good for the human psyche regardless of culture.

"@Anna K. Yeah I&#39;ve seen polygamous families too. I&#39;ve seen young women in Canada and the US forced by religion to marry much older men - young women have been trafficked by such religious sects across borders. It is dehumanizing and not about &quot;religious freedom&quot; I don&#39;t see women being &quot;free&quot; to choose. They are told this is what they must accept. Brainwashing is not free choice. If it is practise in a religion but women are free to say no well... that can be considered, but I&#39;ve never seen that happen usually there is some type of guilt and coersion. And arguing that it&#39;s their culture doesn&#39;t make it any less dehumanizing. Nor does it make it any more &quot;free&quot; for the women to choose what is required of them culturally or religiously. I&#39;m not going to force someone not to do something they practise culturally in a country that is not my own, but I will stand up and say it is wrong, dehumanizing and sad that someone who has the choice not to be dehumanized or dehumanize other women chooses to do so. It is sad and distasteful. I&#39;d rather raise the standards for everyone than lower the ones we&#39;ve worked hard to get. I will not let go of said choices (to vote, to own property instead of being property, becoming a person legally) without standing up for them as opposed to saying, &quot;oh its okay its their culture. They think differently&quot; . Less than 100 years ago our culture thought differently about women and those before me fought to change culture for me.That&#39;s why I will fight tooth and nail to keep polygamy illegal in my country regardless of other people religious or cultural beliefs.",fr smith,2021-03-11T02:53:43Z,0

In her case, she can&#39;t have other husbands, but in other cultures, there are women with more than one spouse. In the USA, Canada and England there are polyamorous families though is not the norm. What I tried to convey is that not everyone has the same values, for you a woman that share her husband devalue herself but for others is not like that because their life is different. The way they think is different. But, I&#39;m all the way for monogamy. I see marriage as was taught us for Jesus, where a woman joins her husband to be one body, where the fundament of the relationship is love. But, not everyone thinks the same.

It pushes my boundaries and even if it doesn&#39;t change my beliefs and values, I can learn to accept and respect those that do not align with mine.<br /><br />Yayai and the Maasai people (as with other polygamous cultures) seem to show a less complicated look at love and marriage... to a point. While it seems that there is less drama on the part of the co-wives who welcome and accept each others&#39; presence in the boma, how would it be if the women wanted to have another lover/husband other than the ones they were arranged to be with. So, Maasai women do not grow up with thoughts of jealousy, what about Maasai men?<br />While she pointed out that today&#39;s younger generation are no longer forced to be in arranged marriages, it seems that Maasai women are still not &quot;allowed&quot; to have more than one husband. How would this narrative change if a married Maasai woman found another man she likes or loves? Is polygamy okay but not polyamory? <br /><br />I would love to hear more and learn more about this fascinating way of love and marriage. Kudos to Eva!",G C A,2021-03-09T02:56:20Z,0

When you are exposed to something from childhood you do not deliberate if it is right or wrong. Clearly its a patriarchal society. And the co wives are a support system for themselves. When the question was reversed she couldn&#39;t provide any convincing answer. Such system always works both in rural and in rich. Ancient cultures were polygamous as for species replication as many would die even before reaching adulthood. In fact many mountains tribes shared a single wife. But even they were still patriarchal. And from a point of overpopulation and anthropocene extinction it is not advisable. In fact Africa&#39;s population is already predicted to increase rapidly. Nevertheless she is mature and there is always something to learn! Sharing is caring. Which civilizations forget. In the end there is no absolute right or wrong. Civilization and cultures evolve  as per needs of time for their continuous sustenance. Which in turn shapes what is right or wrong.,TheQuantumCore,2021-03-09T02:17:08Z,0

"Monogamy is so much different than it is portrayed in the media, which seems to completely miss the fact that under government enforced legalized mono-social climbing the divorce rate is about 68%... Then the next marriage for most women carries an upward mobility economically. Polygamy protects the primordial family. But the globalists do not want this unity which resists their philosophy of &#39;cause division, conquer, further divide the fragments so that no one has a soft place to fall during deliberately manipulated economic down turns that often need government bailouts because the bankster gangsters are considered too big to fail...

"I just want to share my story because now this is a big problem here in the UK for many women: My ex husband married me but he was talking to girls but he still married me, he didn&#39;t provide for me then after a year of marriage he went Pakistan and got married to another girl, then he divorced her. After sometime he got a girl pregnant, he told her a big bag of lies about me and this Muslim girl didn&#39;t know about me but he was still with me. I found out and got divorced but he was cheating on her with other girls and she was pregnant, moved her out of London so she dont find out about me. SubhanAllaah <br /><br />Now my husband lied and tricked me into polygamy marriage, I cry and I&#39;m so upset how a man cant lie and trick me into polygamy marriage  SubhanAllaah. The other wife dont know about me, he moved her out of London Tooting area to Blackpool in 2019 summer time, so I dont leave him, now he tells me their is no wife &quot;Sakina&quot;, I said because you moved her to Blackpool so I cant tell her now and the wife didn&#39;t even question him, the mans moved you out of London SubhanAllaah. <br /><br />I&#39;m warning you sisters please!!!<br />Be careful sisters, dont trust noone. Most Muslim brothers have other girls and that&#39;s how it is nowadays SubhanAllaah. My was husband had me and her then he was talking to other girls for marriage, he didn&#39;t tell these girls he was married with children. <br /><br />He was talking to girls online and his family took him to see other girls at their homes &quot;CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT&quot; you know your son is married with children and your taking him to see other girls for marriage SubhanAllaah. <br /><br />Alot of guys are married or have secret wives and secret girlfriends and secret children SubhanAllaah Ya Allah so please be careful, be careful. I cry so much because I love him, unconditional love Allah swt put in my heart for my husband.<br /><br />Now I&#39;m suffering with mental health issues, emotional abuse too because he was married I got a infection from him too from him having sex with the wife and that&#39;s how I found out he was married to another woman SubhanAllaah.

And if one woman dies, the children will still be raised by the remaining co-wives.

"Actually,  women are quickly married off when the husband dies, the cows split between the boys and the wives are turfed out if they don&#39;t marry the brother. The reason why there is a marriage contract is so the women is not left homeless, with her children taken away from her or forced to marry the brother in order to stay in her marital home.

"polygamy= its not a sound concept for building a society,particularly in a post industrial age. - just look at all the countries that practice this ,they are going down the toilet,and the Massai tribes are as well&gt;Sorry but ive met them too. In polygamous cultures. property rights are key-  who inherits and the lack thereof increases competition for subsistence benefits prevents any type of stability or wealth from being passed on the future generations. Inheritance is the foundation for a stable society, the very one which has enabled you to make this film!!! <br /><br /> If you ever lived in Africa, as i have, you will see women doing all the work with little or no compensation or recognition. Additionally, rivalry between children,and proper paternal attention and rearing by males  within polygamy is very poor. Our own Mormons are proof of that  The first wife&#39;s complaint that one man would be too much to manage is indicative of how troublesome relationships between men and women are in such <a href=""http://cultures.it/"">cultures.It</a> works simply because no one has any expectation it could or should be any better.The quest for intimacy and unity in marriage is noble, however much it may sometimes <a href=""http://fail.to/"">fail.To</a> lack this ideal is to miss much. Additionally, the western white woman who has joined this group has serious issues. low self esteem, integration, etc. Its not a normal reaction or  sound basis for a relationship unless you are incapable of true intimacy or are masochistic. The massia and other polygamous cultures have no expectations for intimacy other than sexual, In such cultures, same sex bonding within work related activities provides fellowship, particularly among the wives.This fellowship tends to mitigate natural jealousies for the husband&#39;s attention to both themselves as individual and the children they had by him,  but not quite.There is a hierarchy among sister wives that makes such cultures oppressive and dangerous. For the woman and her children, there are strong repercussions  if she acts outside the expected order or offends the head wife.. So much for  freedom within &quot;communal marriages&quot;!! Look at all the cultures which practice polygamy, and what do you find?? Buyer, beware!!",Pierre Jamison,2021-03-08T15:27:51Z,1

"What are you talking about? Most western women do not sleep with that many men. In fact, many of us only ever have one partner. That is a disgusting stereotype. Just because we dress sexy, does NOT mean we are just giving it away. Many women I know did not lose their virginity until in their early/mid twenties.",R K,2021-03-08T18:38:49Z,0
"Different way of life-  those cultures who practice polygamy are actually truly happy. This doesn’t mean one way of life is superior to other but polygamy has more benefits which are kept hidden in other cultures. When you have polygamy: Their is absolutely no way a man would use a women for his pleasure and leave her not caring about her,  you like you get married and like a man take care of her for the rest of your life. No one night stands. On the other hand as a women you don’t fear that a man would cheat and take advantage of you.  you know It’s hard to judge others when we havent tasted their lives.",MAUR,2021-03-08T14:33:02Z,0

"I just want to share my story because now this is a big problem here in the UK for many women: My ex husband married me but he was talking to girls but he still married me, he didn&#39;t provide for me then after a year of marriage he went Pakistan and got married to another girl, then he divorced her. After sometime he got a girl pregnant, he told her a big bag of lies about me and this Muslim girl didn&#39;t know about me but he was still with me. I found out and got divorced but he was cheating on her with other girls and she was pregnant, moved her out of London so she dont find out about me. SubhanAllaah <br /><br />Now my husband lied and tricked me into polygamy marriage, I cry and I&#39;m so upset how a man cant lie and trick me into polygamy marriage  SubhanAllaah. The other wife dont know about me, he moved her out of London Tooting area to Blackpool in 2019 summer time, so I dont leave him, now he tells me their is no wife &quot;Sakina&quot;, I said because you moved her to Blackpool so I cant tell her now and the wife didn&#39;t even question him, the mans moved you out of London SubhanAllaah. <br /><br />I&#39;m warning you sisters please!!!<br />Be careful sisters, dont trust noone. Most Muslim brothers have other girls and that&#39;s how it is nowadays SubhanAllaah. My was husband had me and her then he was talking to other girls for marriage, he didn&#39;t tell these girls he was married with children. <br /><br />He was talking to girls online and his family took him to see other girls at their homes &quot;CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT&quot; you know your son is married with children and your taking him to see other girls for marriage SubhanAllaah. <br /><br />Alot of guys are married or have secret wives and secret girlfriends and secret children SubhanAllaah Ya Allah so please be careful, be careful. I cry so much because I love him, unconditional love Allah swt put in my heart for my husband.<br /><br />Now I&#39;m suffering with mental health issues, emotional abuse too because he was married I got a infection from him too from him having sex with the wife and that&#39;s how I found out he was married to another woman SubhanAllaah. The wife still dont know about me Terrible. Warning <a href=""https://youtu.be/mkJF6G-I-Cg"">https://youtu.be/mkJF6G-I-Cg</a>",Dont be a secret wife!!!,2021-03-12T00:31:17Z,1

"How do they avoid cousins marrying cousins? Because here is the problem that often results from polygamy: if one man fathers say 20 kids, each of those boy kids will go off and each have another 20 kids, and so on. So in only a generation or two, you risk cousins marrying one another. Because frankly who can keep track of who they are actually related to under such circumstances. Then they have kids who have genetic problems. Which is why they usually do NEED to have arranged marriages. Allowing people to marry for love while maintaining polygamy, honestly, would be a disaster.",EC,2021-03-08T09:56:58Z,1

"The concept of monogamous marriage is not western. It is almost part of every society.

"If one looks at it objectively, their marriage tradition actually works for their way of life. If they will maintain a boma, they will require many hands and therefore several wives and children to run it and make it feasible. Also, polygamy and polyamory exist in the west, too. It is not a mainstream practice, true; but both exist as fact.<br /><br />We have been heavily and deeply conditioned to look only at what is &quot;ideal&quot; from our perspective. However, our beliefs are not the only valid beliefs in this world. If one will go back in western history, husbands used to sell their wives like cattle.

Young people dont want to follow the tradition anymore of disrespectful men who wants many wives but still sleeps around with many other women. Zuma from South Africa is a clear example. This opens all the women up to sexually transmitted diseases. Zuma now has no wives anymore because rumour was he still kept on sleeping with different young women. The tradition might work in an environment where the man follows the tradition in a strict manner and respects each wife.

It&#39;s not a must but it also has limits. &amp; WHo&#39;s the one to put those permissions &amp; limits you might ask...  ?  well... :) you know the answer.<br />Want a perspective ?! hehehhehe well you know very well Christianity right ? well in the Bible , it says Prophet Soliman (May peace be upon him) was married to 700 &amp; also had other 300 on the side. of course I don&#39;t believe that. That&#39;s why Muslims keep replying to the Christian world that Your book has and is definitely been corrupted. <br />So Prophet Mohamed (May peace be upon him) was given the final rules, limits and the conditions as a final divine revelation. Religion is a way of life. Meaning it enters in &amp; covers all aspects of life. <br />The question is and has always been, how authentic is the Message/Miracle/word of God ie The Book ie the Quoran. <br />The Great thing about the Islam is that the Quoran unlike the Bible , is the direct word of God and not just some book written by men that were claiming to have been inspired by God. <br />So it can be checked and analyzed to see how authentic and great it really is. Moreover there is the Sunna books which are books of the sayings of the Prophet (May peace be upon him), which also unlike the Bible , have a detailed chain of narration, and behind that , there is a whole study of each individual in this chain. So basically Authenticity is the most important things.",Sherif El Kadi,2021-03-08T06:44:18Z,0

"I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s difficult at all for those in the west to &quot;understand the Maasai marital relationships&quot;, as you say. They live a more primitive lifestyle than those in the west and therefore they need all the help they can get. (no different than the farming and ranching families in America at one point) <br />As the mother in law explained, having more wives increases the odds of having more female children that they can utilize to increase the family wealth. That&#39;s not difficult to understand and it fits their way of life quite well.  In western culture, we have no need for that. It&#39;s really just that simple....<br />Yes, westerners have been raised to practice what works well for them inside their own culture no differently than the Maasai have been raised to practice what works best for them inside their own culture.... I feel that you&#39;re attempting to make it &quot;wrong&quot; for westerners to have their culture and way of thinking while believing that it&#39;s perfectly acceptable for another group of people to have their culture and way of thinking...<br />Too, I don&#39;t understand how you feel that because you have less melanin, you couldn&#39;t possibly comprehend the problems that the Maasai or anyone in a poly marriage has... It doesn&#39;t take melanin to comprehend that....  (big sigh.... )<br />I think the Maasai culture is beautiful for them and I&#39;m sad to see their culture vanishing slowly.. That&#39;s unfortunately occurring all over the planet....It&#39;s the individual groups of people around the globe and their own culture that makes this world so beautiful... I hope that every group of people choose to fight to save their own special culture...",J H,2021-03-08T00:25:40Z,1

"Ok. So now. Let me reveal bite you do not know. Which I know as I lived in T Gambia with Gambians. Women in Africa (I can assume the Massai women too) are circumcised. Men over there know and actually talk about the reasons, a circumcised woman remains loyal, she has no extra intimate excitement going on for herself and does not get over emotional and her body only is for breeding then. This also explains why women really truthly become friends to eachother and cooperate raising all the children together. It favours men to have friendly women  and we all have to remember about the rituals which are the big part of the culture on the Mother Land. Circumcision is still there for MEN to keep women naturally calm with no extra arousals.",hgf W,2021-03-07T18:33:23Z,5

"@Rin I&#39;m not saying that polygamy is better than monogamy.<br />But I am saying that monogamy isn&#39;t necessarily better than polygamy. People seem to have some air of superiority because they have one partner.<br /><br />It&#39;s the patriarchy that exists in all aspects of marriage. Men allowed to have multiple wives, but women not allowed to have multiple husbands. Women having to take the husband&#39;s name, take care of the home and take maternity leave off(giving up her career) to take care of children. <br /><br />It exists in all places of the world and all cultures...",Emily Canfield,2021-03-11T15:35:41Z,0
"​@Rin Men and women should be equal, but monogamous relationships can be just as &quot;bad&quot; as you think polygamous relationships are.<br /><br />If you want to bring the patriarchy into it some men in monogamous relationships thing that they own their girlfriend/wife. They think its okay to treat them like objects who belong in the home. Monogamous relationships can also be arranged just like how the woman in the video was in an arranged marriage.<br /><br />The style of relationship isn&#39;t bad, being in a poly relationship doesn&#39;t mean a woman doesn&#39;t value herself, and it doesn&#39;t mean she is treated badly. The woman in the video even says that her being in an arranged marriage with no choice was also the old way of doing things, and that a lot of the younger generation marries for love.<br /><br />I know some people in poly relationships, and they don&#39;t love their first partner any less because they have other romantic or sexual relationships.<br />Humans are allowed to love more than one person. <br /><br />Also yes we accept other people&#39;s culture. Why don&#39;t you go put all that effort of hating on polygamous marriages between happy consenting adults, and focus it on an actual problem like child marriage, or marital abuse.",Emily Canfield,2021-03-11T15:31:32Z,0
"@Emily Canfield I made no insinuations or comparisons between monogamous and polygamous relationships, didn’t even talk about it.  All i said was that men and women should be equal and I called this a bad practice. You are far too keen to suggest monogamous relationships are equally bad. That’s different. I make neither positive nor negative claims about it here.  Isn’t it the role of toxic patriarchy to keep women in oppressed situations and not know anything better so their only explanation for their state is “ it’s just what we are born with”? Are they disconnected from the world? Apparently not. Are we just accepting of this because it’s not us and it’s them and their situation has no implications whatsoever on our situation so it’s okay, let them be? Well-let them be, but are we not even going to call out what we know it is? Are we going to just pretend that this is totally fine and super cute because they are different?",Rin,2021-03-11T11:49:40Z,0
"@Rin yes, but you&#39;re insinuating that monogamy is &quot;better&quot; than polygamy. As the woman said in the video, its just what we are raised with.<br /><br />At times monogamy can be very toxic because people get literally possessive, jealous, abusive etc.. There are also a lot of people in this day and age who enter into monogamous relationships only to constantly cheat -- perhaps these people would be better in open communicative polygamous relationships where its okay to get different needs taken care of by different people(not just sexual desires.)<br /><br />I&#39;m saying this all as someone who is monogamous and will continue to be for the rest of my life.

"You are still idealizing the form. The planet is a physical one, a practical one. the environment forms our traditions, sometimes making them ideals that cause stagnant thinking when change comes. IN the Himalayan mountains, one woman has more than one husband, a change in their culture to limit population growth. Perhaps we should begin to limit reproduction to self development, as though one procreates when one has developed the self fully? Our bodies will evolve to the change. At the moment, the consumerist model users hyper sexuality as a distraction.. At the end of the day, &quot; traditions&quot; can become idealism forgetting their evolution based on the environment, thus we have many superstitions to release and come back down to earth to focus on realizing social development in ways that stop causing harm to all living beings on this planet.  We must learn the difference between conditioning and direct focus on the practical to stop idealizing and comparing one way to another because they are all products of the environment and our use or mis-use of it.",Reb Dalmas,2021-03-07T15:44:19Z,5

"It used to be like that in Europe too, I am not referring to poligamy but to arranged marriage. In my modest view, as we are socialized as Westerners to be monogamous though cheatting on partners is rather endemic in my experience, likewise Masai women are socialized to believe that they have to accept any man their father choose for them and be in the company of other co-wifes. I personally believe that every single human being should be free to be whomever they want to be and live the life they want without any cultural or societal chains.

@Anwar it&#39;s been a nice discussion. Good day to you too.,Joscelin,2021-03-12T16:57:21Z,1
"@Joscelin Feminine woman show interest in her man masculine traits instead of feeling threatened. And encourage him to be more comfortable with his masculine nature and leadership with humility. Humility doesn&#39;t comes from the weak. It come from a person who feels no need to prove anything. Women must know that only weak men harms women it&#39;s not the women &quot;weakness&quot; fault if a man sees any woman exists as weak no matter what she do trust me he is just far more weaker than any woman. the more I am respected with actions the more chivalrous, generous and gentle I became naturally with women. I believe that showing love is my duty. But For me being respected means being loved and I expect no more. You are good woman. don&#39;t change  for anyone or buy the confusions. have a nice day.",Anwar,2021-03-12T14:07:14Z,0
"@Joscelin You are absolutely right and you articulate it very well. Of course man and woman are different in many things. A house without a woman is just a structure without a spirit, warmth, taste or fragrance. And I never believed that the women lose their beauty like that. I was talking with western perspective. Since many women there think that their body is the only thing they can offer. While offering it to others for free as they emotionally comparing themselves with the man body which has no value in the market at all.  Also While in reality men appreciate the women acts of respect to them more and give love in return. And nothing more powerful and attractive than a woman who love being a woman and who took pride of the womenly traits and femininity as you said.  Femininity power melt the man like fire do to iron. Masculine disrespectful women only brakes and get nothing. Feminine women are cooperative. loves and allows her man to be a man. Not being an argumentative burdensome after the stress of the whole day. A wise women would choose the best times to argue in something.",Anwar,2021-03-12T13:57:48Z,0
"@Anwar Why do women lose their beauty in this way? Wouldn&#39;t a women who knows her worth and what she wants, be more attractive? The beauty I see in this is not a woman who acts crudely like an untrue image of man, but a woman who takes pride in her womenly traits and isn&#39;t afraid to compromise with her man. To me that&#39;s beauty, a man willing to give in to his woman, and a woman willing to give in to her man. It is the giving of both people, not just one, that I see as beautiful. For this to work a woman must know her strength and expect her wants to be acknowledged. This dosent mean that she strips herself completely of her grace and feminity, she can still be the one who nurture and gives care, who listens and endures, but at the same time she can have an strong and unyielding spirit that dosent take anything she deems she dosent deserve.<br />Though I will admit that there&#39;s a group of woman who are mistakenly ashamed of their womanly traits and think acting like men is empowerment, when this shouldn&#39;t be the case. There is strength in feminity, just as there is strength in man.",Joscelin,2021-03-12T08:16:19Z,0
@Joscelin And I will tell you something About the western sexual empowerment that the western women are proud of and that&#39;s will shock you. Just wait a couple of years from now the western women will eat from what they seed as they are comparing themselves to men like the women in the comments here. you will see a whole generation of women that lost their beauty and fertility bec of age and they will be unmarried and undesirable for men and they will continue to live like that until they die. And men will exploit that and treat them like objects even more than now. We as eastern men aren&#39;t hating women we are just good leaders. Women can damn themselves easily out of emotional thinking. And if you didn&#39;t agree you also have the right to live in fantasies as others.,Anwar,2021-03-12T05:26:21Z,0
"I imagine FGM was a taboo topic here? Since FGM is still widely practised among the Maasai, even considered essential for women to achieve full adulthood, most of these women have probably been mutilated.

"@Gabrielle Wadlington It&#39;s not about the westerners deciding what&#39;s right or wrong.  It&#39;s about women being informed/educated, allowed to decide for  themselves how to live rather than being pressured by male dominated cultures into doing things against their will.  FGM is often practised on girls of seven years old and under, by older women in their community, themselves having survived FGM, without anaesthetic or even the most rudimentary hygene precautions.  Have you ever heard the screams of these poor little girls?  I&#39;m sick of people using &#39;tradition&#39;, religion, etc to excuse barbaric, inhumane behaviour towards a fellow human being.  It&#39;s just a way of trying to control women and have sex &#39;on tap&#39; for the men. FGM is probably the worst example of this.

@Muhammad Mafaz I guess as happy as untouchable in India. They also see their inferiority as natural. Even a lot of slaves feel very happy. Does it mean it´s good? Or that they had no choice but to convince themselves they ar happy? Young Massai with more freedom don´t see it as so &quot;natural&quot; and don´t practice it anymore.

"I am from the Middle East.<br />There’s one little problem here. If an old wealthy man has four wives, it means three young men are deprived of wives, families and children.<br />Please don’t glorify this subject.<br />I am a psychiatrist, have seen many cases and women were always miserable.",fred khan,2021-03-07T09:35:58Z,14
"@fred khan We’re definitely talking about two different worlds, but not two different genders. We’re still talking about women. Whatever context they’re in, women’s choices for themselves are to be respected. Here you’re talking about when they do not have that choice and that’s oppression.<br /><br />If the state doesn’t protect the women and leave them in difficult situations where they have to lean on marriage to even survive, then that is definitely a political value issue. I don’t know if you live in a Muslim majority country, but if you do, most of the issues there relating to women are not “religiously accepted”. There’s more rulings about polygamy in the religion than just “oh you can get four wives bro”; there’s respect based rules that most of those countries set aside (which is why we don’t call them “Muslim countries” but “Muslim majority”). A woman that gets forced into marriage is already considered wrong in the religion, forget about even polygamy. It’s a cultural/political issue in which women are considered properties and financial opportunities.<br /><br />Women should not be forced into marriage, whether it’s by coercion or social oppression. That’s it, that’s all. If a rich man came up to a girl for her to get married and she doesn’t have the option to say no, then it’s 100% oppression. Nothing to do with polygamy’s reality. The woman in this video said she was forced into marriage but it had nothing to do with the polygamy aspect, explaining how she actually enjoyed that aspect of her culture since it made her family bigger and brought in her family close intimidate friends.",Shika Jb,2021-03-07T22:25:19Z,0
"@Zhang Wei Definitely agree with you. It’s like we’re so sure about what is right for the woman and what will make her happy that we ignore her choices and impose that upon her. I’ve also known women in polyamory relationships in the west, women who married a guy they met for five minutes, women who had their parents choose a partner by choice,  women who royally refused to marry, and women who refused to even be in a relationship.<br /><br />I said that if they chose to be in that relationship, then that’s that. Don’t look at them as more of a victims than if it was a man. If it’s forced upon them, that’s another matter.",Shika Jb,2021-03-07T20:50:23Z,0
"@Zhang Wei   We are talking about two different worlds! <br />It’s not like western world men as they get older, keep marring younger and more exotic women or keep changing their mistresses.<br />If they marry a teenager, they will be arrested for pedophilia.<br />Women in the west are much older and more educated, independent and making their own choices.<br />It’s different with the legal and religiously accepted polygamy which is only allowed for wealthy men ( they stone a woman if she does that) ,in the third world nations.",fred khan,2021-03-07T18:07:43Z,0
"@Shika Jb  I was born and lived there. I witnessed it.<br />Trust me, it’s not the way you’re imagining. Nothing is romantic about it in the real lives of those women.<br />It’s like guys in their fifties and sixties practically buying 12-14 years old girls, taking them away from little educations they may have, from their poverty stricken families , who have also many children and can’t feed them. <br />It’s like sacrificing a daughter for the good of her siblings.<br />Nothing is romantic. It’s like buying slaves, sex toys and a healthier and younger breeders.<br />It’s a shameful practice in the third world countries.",fred khan,2021-03-07T17:38:50Z,2
"Women aren’t properties; it’s not a question of “men not having women because other men grabbed the woman first”<br />It’s not wealth, it’s not the rich with 100000$ that’s stealing my 100$ opportunity.<br />Women marry whoever they want and if they feel comfortable marrying a man that has other wives compared to a young man that doesn’t, and if it’s legal, let her do whatever she wants.<br /><br />I don’t agree with forced marriage either, so it doesn’t apply if that’s what’s happening. Doesn’t change the fact that women’s personal life choices are more important than a young man or a rich man’s future life prospects.<br /><br />P.S. I understand that you’re a psychiatrist, but keep in mind that a psychiatrist’s job is to see people who need help, not those who are alright. The demographic of your clients makes the judgement of women in general biased.",Shika Jb,2021-03-07T16:47:37Z,4

"Its also because polygamy often comes with the different realities of arranged marriage and difficult conditions of life (like if you&#39;re old / ill and can&#39;t fetch water for yourself, someone in the large boma can help out).<br />But its interesting. A century ago people in Europe got married not just for love, but also to be a tight knit family in the face of tough adversity like poverty, old age, working hard, ... This is kind of the same, but with polygamy as a twist :)",Hannahpauline,2021-03-07T08:37:48Z,0

I read an interview with Stephanie and she said that in the Masaii culture men and women are very separate. For example the men eat together separately from the women. And the warriors (i.e. The men) are not very involved in the family life.

"Dear Eva, I am a big fan of you and follow your videos with big interest. But latter I am kind of disappointed. I prefer to see you as a traveler to show us different cultures, food and life styles, than an activist.. The story of the polygamous woman  is not intersting as much as her daughter in low. The masai women don’t have rights, they don’t have choice. They can’t marry more than one man.They are forced to married the man they don’t love. When there is no love, no jealousy. They have to accept second , third or moré wives. When you are born in this society you have to accept their rules to survive. Doesn’t matter if they  are good or bad. They are many countries and societies with different life styles. When you are born there this is the only reality you know. The people from developed country have choice - they can live simple life too if they want. But for the masai people this is the only life they know. I am sure Stefani will not be happy if her husband bring another wife to her family. Her story and points of veiw are more interesting. Why you don’t interview masai man to see his pont of view?",Katerina Kovatcheva,2021-03-07T08:00:45Z,0

"Polygamy is not a practice limited to the religion of Islam; rather, it is something well-known in the history of the People of the Book, the Jews, and the Christians, as well.  It is only in the later times that their religious men frowned upon it or forbade it outright.  However, when one looks into the early history of the religions, they will find that it was at least an acceptable practice, if not encouraged. <a href=""https://www.islamreligion.com/articles/326/polygamy-in-judaism-and-christianity/"">https://www.islamreligion.com/articles/326/polygamy-in-judaism-and-christianity/</a>",Muhd Sufian,2021-03-07T07:07:54Z,0

"@daenerys max You are applying your logic to a culture that follows a different logic. I come from a society that used to be polygamist. A man cannot have several wives if he cannot take care of them properly and it’s expected of him to have kids with each of them. And husbands had to properly take care of their wives or they could end up in a lot of troubles within the tribe. <br />I heard about a tribe where polyandry was practiced. The woman would move from one husband’s house to the other. When she gets pregnant and gives birth, the father is the husband whose house she is living in at that time. And it is expected of her to have kids with all her husbands and not just one kid.",kephrenh,2021-03-08T21:44:08Z,0

"What i find more interesting than the video is the reaction of people in the comments. People are all very positive about this and even complement this life style. They seem/are very happy but they never forged their own path. They never had the freedom of picking their own destiny and are taught its the way of living. She tells the story that she didn&#39;t want to be married to him and didn&#39;t want to go. In the end she adapted and made it work of course but still it was not her own doing. She even tells the story that the third wife was literally bought. This is legit modern day slavery where people are bought and sold for financial or political gain. I also dont see any arguments for this kind of life style, she does say like she enjoys her family etc. but marriage is not a requirement to achieve this. It happens everywhere in the world, you dont need to be related to love someone or have a good time together. This video was very interesting to see how the maasai live and i think it shows more that we in the west can be very thankful we can choice our own destination and loved once and that we are prosperous enough that we dont need to make many children or sell of our family members to be successful. In the west we can only buy love with love.",Larsino2000,2021-03-06T23:29:43Z,74

"I think we need to be mindful of the overall context of Maasai culture in general, what you may perceive as a “bought bride” or enforced marriage are actually different in nature from the Maasai cultural perspective. Certain things make sense in a certain framework, and their life is most definitely different from a western life. What they see as valuable is different from what you see as valuable, and free choice and individuality aren’t the only way to a happy and fulfilling life.",Ulla Hussain,2021-03-10T02:05:49Z,2

"@Florence deBear Again, OG comment isn’t aimed at maasai people, it’s an open conversation for people watching the video- so we can nip that topic right in the bud because I don’t care about your misplaced righteousness and it adds nothing to the conversation.

My question about polygamy from a human pov: If the birth rate is about 50/50 male/female, then what will happen to all the poorer men when all the rich men take two to three wives? It seems to me polygamy will only work if the society has a high mortality rate among the males.",Okay Boomer,2021-03-06T18:21:45Z,1

"@Viktoria Masai men get to choose their own wife, it&#39;s the women who don&#39;t get a choice. I have a somewhat low view of the men because they don&#39;t help with anything domestic, not even when the wife gives birth. The men don&#39;t even give their baby a single feed. They literally do nothing. The white Masai wife Stephanie made all this very clear in her documentary. It&#39;s why she&#39;s a wife because her husband is allowed to choose his partner. The reverse would never be allowed to happen. <br /><br />Anyway my original point was the women are happy and it&#39;s easy to know why.",Starie Hearts,2021-03-08T08:10:24Z,6

It is also probably not fun to be married to a girl who clearly does not want to be with them, so it is understandable why they would maybe want more wives too. <br />I don&#39;t think this situation is good for anyone, and they might live a somewhat happy life next to each other, but there is no real connection between them, so the relationship itself is not happy.",Viktoria,2021-03-08T05:58:09Z,1

"@Viktoria  it most likely is a happy relationship in the sense that the wives are happy because they only have to put up with hubby&#39;s bs once a week. Bet they can&#39;t wait to get rid of him and ship him off to the next wife. So in that sense, they are happy. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the monogamous marriages where the wife is unhappy because she has to put up with hubby everyday and can&#39;t get rid of him. If I was a Masai wife, I&#39;d want as many co-wives as possible. That&#39;s the only way these women can be happy bc these men are hard to tolerate",Starie Hearts,2021-03-07T20:07:04Z,3

"As far as I understand, the first wife said that the females at the wedding bring cattle to the husband and his Community, so the family gets &quot;richer&quot; and bigger. And they dont only live together but everyone works and contributes for the benefit of all. Dental and medical issues might be still a problem, maybe a prosperous community will sell a cow to pay the hospital for a family member.",Ingrid Reim,2021-03-06T15:11:52Z,1

"@destroyraiden read my comment please. This has nothing to do with religion, it is simple human biology our ancestors had tribes with multiple women. It happened during the hunter gatherer period of human history and is possibly still hardwired into the male species today.",OG Lucas,2021-03-09T00:11:20Z,0
"@daenerys max it is something biological! People try to talk about things they know nothing of. Lions, kangaroos, wolves and many other animals (including primates) indulge in polygamy. Listen, why do women like tall, muscular, physical and rich men, because it provides them with a better chance of their offspring surviving. This is natural selection, and we have 1 purpose biologically on this earth and that is to reproduce, not only us but all animals. People need to understand this doesnt work the other way around, if a woman has multiple males, she can not bear each males offspring at once. And if she dies, then her offspring die with her. Then our species will not survive, and so it is natural the other way around, because 1 man can impregnate multiple women at the same time. If you do not understand simple biology, then why talk. It is civilisation that has made this practice redundant in some areas of the world. But we must still acknowledge that this is natural and biological and that it is rare to see monogamous relationships in the wild as opposed to polygamous because it is for the survival of the species. People think that humans are so advanced and different to animals, but we still have the wild instincts hardwired into us and our biology. A mans biology tells him to have sex with as many different women as possible, not for pleasure, but to pass his genes on for the survival of the species, the pleasure side is to trick the human brain into thinking that this is right, otherwise if the process was painful, we wouldn&#39;t be here today.",OG Lucas,2021-03-09T00:08:11Z,0
"@prolaze What you mean is colonialism <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Cgs5Nmfd4"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_Cgs5Nmfd4</a> <br />this has nothing to do with biology Africa has  along history of women being dominant culturally and in some other cases physically as well.

"It is very interesting that though the first wife was never introduced to other cultures (I guess) she is very understanding and respectful, while you see often western people being very judgemental despite all the privileges they have such as education and the internet",May Alherek,2021-03-06T14:25:09Z,7
"If we examine your comment, you&#39;re actually not saying much anything at all. Which Western people are being very judgemental about what exactly? No example given here.

She is not stupid. She knows she has to be diplomatic about it. This doesn&#39;t mean she is really tolerant or non judgemental. She wants other women to go through the trauma she went through and have it just as bad.,daenerys max,2021-03-07T05:19:21Z,3

"I know you were trying to be respectful but you didn&#39;t ask questions such as .. why can&#39;t a woman have many husbands.. what happens to the woman if the husband dies, what happens if the husband gets rid of the wife.. it&#39;s very one sided. These women know no different and they are second class citizens.  I&#39;ve been to massai villages before and they live in horrendous poverty with no education.  Mainly just women and children. The men disappear for months on end. This is not a romantic idea.. reality is that it&#39;s their only choice",Sk,2021-03-06T13:58:36Z,5
"@Julie V. Billa This is not the case. I don&#39;t have personal problem with the idea of polyamory, for example i wish more husbands, but in this video the consent doesn&#39;t exist, easy. Arranged marriage, polyamory, and everything, are good only in consent. It&#39;s abuse if a indian family, for example, obliges the children to get married. Do not confuse culture with the human tradition of bullying others for &quot;the greater good&quot;. Maasai women cant ask help because 1) they know only what their society tell to them. How many millennia did it take for Western women to ask questions about their situation? And here we go again in 2021! 2)who should they ask for help and how?",Behemot Bootsee,2021-03-12T13:36:43Z,0
"@Jeanette H. I acknowledge that I misspoke. However, just because someone may not agree in arranged marriages or polygamy, it does not make it abuse. In Western culture (or lack of any real culture), we are very quick to condemn everything we dislike. I don’t agree with arranged marriages, however, I do not believe it is abuse. If the Maasai women started asking for people to please help them to get out of the situation they are in, I’d be the first in line to help, but we can’t assume that because it’s not the life that we want then they must automatically want out.",Julie V. Billa,2021-03-11T14:56:12Z,0
@Julie V. Billa  May I respectfully suggest that you watch this video again?,Jeanette H.,2021-03-11T12:31:18Z,1
"@Behemot Bootsee I am not romanticizing anything. I must have missed the part where she said she was forced into the marriage, or is that an assumption you made because it’s abhorrent to you. I don’t condone women being forced into anything, but I am not going to assume that is what happened here because I don’t know. I detest abuse of women, but many times, especially women in western cultures, make assumptions of abuse because they don’t agree with something. Maybe you should ask Eva whether the women there felt that they were abused.",Julie V. Billa,2021-03-09T16:59:20Z,0
"@Julie V. Billa abuse is all you are forced to keep because you are not allowed to choose otherwise. These women could not choose anything, the reasons for their life are established by others. Love is choice, this polygamy is not consenting, it is not free polyamory, don&#39;t romanticize",Behemot Bootsee,2021-03-09T16:46:29Z,2
"I wonder if jealousy has something to do with the spirit of competition and ranking things that is present in almost all things judeo-christian (because this is basically what western culture is). You want to be #1, you want to be or have the best. #2 is not enough. Raising in ranks means stepping on others and keeping them down. Not that ambition is bad, but yep, learning to be happy is a skill, it is letting go of some of that ranking and competition and setting expectations that are realistic.<br /><br />Western people mix love and &quot;passionately hugging&quot; as one and to be shared with only a single person. They do not have to be. People with a significant other, do you really do everything together or do you do other things exclusively with friends?<br /><br />Love is not a 0-sum game. Loves grow the more you have and give. When you have one kid, do you love is 50% less when the second kid comes, or are you now capable of giving twice the love you were giving before?",oscassey,2021-03-06T13:57:51Z,0

@Bari Vule see i am all for equality but if u according to the  bible  god had always considered men as the superior gender( i know its sad) men are generally leaders you cant have two men together because you cant have two leaders for a team but women are like teammates they can blend easily  thats y you can see women can do gay things very easily conpared to men.   wouldnt you feel good that you can have a sister wife like when ur husband goes to work you all can have ur girl talk  atleast you all can be busy or u want to stay bored alone at home?? I guess women would share,THE KING,2021-03-10T10:29:15Z,1
julinaonYT i think we should question why this value is placed on the women’s lives like this instead of men’s... economic value isn’t a justification for marriage inequality. question why the society has set up the means to make this acceptable for just men and not women...,chibiyaten15,2021-03-09T01:50:03Z,14
"If i heard right, with wives comes cattle, and with cattle the family wealth increased, so if that is the case, a Woman taking 2 or more husband in this particular society would make for a poor economic decision.",julinaonYT,2021-03-08T05:46:11Z,0

"I don&#39;t think one way of life is better or worse than others. I prefer to have a monogamous relationship but if someone wants to have a polygamous marriage that is fine. Everyone should know the pros and cons of being married to multiple women. It&#39;s not easy and oh just one big happy go lucky family or as some men like to think as one huge orgy. You have to provide for emotionally, physically and &quot;financially&quot; (for people in more Western cultures). You don&#39;t just get a good &quot;supply&quot; of wives and have sex with them all the time. You have to take care of them and whatever children you have. And to do that in the West, you&#39;d have to either be very rich or live a much simpler lifestyle probably away from the confines of society.",427IndigenousSkies,2021-03-06T12:09:08Z,0

@Bari Vule coz I was replying to @tharika fuhrer who was is saying that this polygamy thing is a result of not having a choice. Follow the thread please,Lawrence Kimani,2021-03-10T07:39:06Z,1
"@tharika fuhrer 1st, Polygamy is legal in most of East Africa. 2nd no one can hold you hostage in a marriage, if you don&#39;t want to be in it you can get out and its also legal. It might surprise you that in the last 5 years, this aspect of sharing a husband has become popular with millennials who are very educated. Most ladies see it as a way to have their space but still have some sort of permanent legal relationship. Also, since usually men are fewer than women, then also eligible men are even much fewer and even much much fewer are eligible men willing to settle down, hence polygamy has new lease of life in modern society.<br /><br />So instead of having a mistress you get another wife.",Lawrence Kimani,2021-03-09T17:11:05Z,0
"@Nonno L Exactly what choice did she have may I ask? Like what would her alternate choice be? By which I mean was she given the opportunity to have the freedom to get an education or to work? Obviously not. So she really had no other choice but to marry. And you even proved my point out even more when you say &quot;most&quot; men wont because the fact is they do it out of courteousy, it is at the husband&#39;s discretion and his wife must go along with whatever descision he makes.There is a difference between being given a choice and being coerced. Pls educate yourself.",tharika fuhrer,2021-03-09T15:34:49Z,4
@tharika fuhrer their truth is not theirs...please don&#39;t make assumptions.  My grandmother is from this tribe and she had a choice. Infact most men will not marry without the approval of the 1st wife.,Nonno L,2021-03-09T14:51:18Z,0

I’d like to start a travel vlog myself and will definitely adopt this technique because otherwise lots of information and personality shared by a person would go lost in translation. <br />I loved listening to Yayai’s story and was happy that I understood her quite well - I speak Maa, but the dialect from northern Kenya (Samburu) ;)<br />The perspective on love and marriage shared by Yayai is actually still very common among young people in the rural region of Samburu County, Kenya.",Melanie Gebhard,2021-03-06T12:08:14Z,4

"@Dariu Toma Dear, jealousy is a strong overwhelming feeling and no religion can control it. I don&#39;t know what is your age. And do you have life experience? It&#39;s almost impossible to control jealosy and act fine and smile and appear happy. It&#39;s just a normal part of life of an ordinary human being regardless of the culture and country they were born in. And only if that human LOVES her husband! In this case husband f*<b>*</b> other woman , and she married him against her will. So then I understand why she doesn&#39;t feels jealous. Nobody would feel jealous seriously:) and there is nothing holy in this terrible system,  no holy sisterhood for God&#39;s service.  All these poor wives are involved in that system so they just learnt to be happy , they forced themselves to appear happy. It&#39;s sickening",Marina,2021-03-11T00:11:40Z,5

There is a reason why one culture has landed spacecrafts on Mars and the other culture resembles a stone age era civilization. Monogomy may not work for the masaai way of life but it is one of the most crucial foundations of the modern world.,Kumar Satyam,2021-03-06T11:18:31Z,3
"What do you have to say about maasai men in the US who work as software engineers or doctors but still practice polygamy? Not all maasai live in this setup, some black folks you see in the US maybe immigrant maasai but you will never know, they will just pass as African Americans , the problem is not polygamy, education is what changes society. If we go with your theory then it means lesbianism and gay culture should have the same effect as polygamy, the west has had homosexuality for a very long time but it has never stopped advancement in science and engineering, what do you think could be the reason? Education is the reason, good schools, research etc",felix,2021-03-07T20:12:44Z,0

Just because other people live differently, doesn&#39;t mean that our way of life is unnatural or undesirable. Monogomy may not work in tribal societies, and polygamy will not work in advanced societies where you need a strong couple to raise children who will have sophisticated careers in engineering, medicine etc. But if your livelihood depends on cattle and land, than maybe this Tanzanian way of life is more suited for you.",Kumar Satyam,2021-03-07T18:08:51Z,2

"Nice video and lovely people. Not to be judgmental or offend anyone, this is just my observation. But I have found it really fascinating that these people who are called &quot;savages&quot; by the white supremacists and their radical counterparts have so conveniently accepted a white bride even with polar opposite idea of marriage as well as some other things into their homes without judgement, while those so called &quot;saviors of western civilization and culture&quot; are threatened by few immigrants with different backgrounds. One would think that this should be opposite that those living in West the so called &quot;Civilised world&quot; should be more welcoming than these people but it is often not the case.

"To me this sounds like communistic love, share the love share the wealth, it&#39;s theory is appealing... that&#39;s why even communism had it&#39;s golden years,but in the end it&#39;s a proven wrong method of living that does not work, since people want better things for themself, a better spouse, a better house, a better job, people want to feel special, different from other pople, that&#39;s why communist failed, beacause in general people don&#39;t like to be equal status/wealth, a director of some big company don&#39;t want to have the same salary and living conditions to some coal miner, and so on. Give the massai people the economic and living status of the west, and this entire notion of &quot;share the love&quot; will just fade away in a more capitalistic way of living, beacause for better or worse it&#39;s a proven system. Their culture only works because they all have equal status, otherwise... in a competitive system, no more zen.",Adrian Geicu,2021-03-06T09:43:58Z,0

That type of polygamy is common in many parts of the world but going less popular which is a good thing. İn Turkey it has gone down with Ataturk founding Turkey.

"In some cases, it&#39;s probably true that the husband has a huge sex drive, and in others it&#39;s probably not the case. What is true is that a man who has more than one wife is going to gain more status and power in his society (and likely more wealth, too). How do I know that? Because for every extra wife a man marries, there is another man who gets no wife at all. That man will have no descendants. He is shut out from the future of his society, and likely shut out from its present as well. He&#39;s forced into lower social status, and likely into lower economic status as well.",Big Scary Steve,2021-03-06T10:04:34Z,0
@J Y Its not in a woman&#39;s nature and its not in a man&#39;s nature to share his woman.
