"The concept of sending a close family member to invite guests happens in Telugu weddings (in a region of South India) too.

This is one of those experiences that I wish I could have myself (one of many in your channel), but since I am stuck in northern Sweden (just north of the Arctic Circle) and the pandemic is still running wild, I do the second best thing: I watch great travel videos. And dream back to the few but life-changing adventures I have had the luck to experience - praying that there will be many more in the future.

We traveled by train to china and went by bus on the second highest pass, the Karakorhum highway, from Sust, Gilgit, to the hunza valey. Unfortunaly we where afraid to travel by night, thats why we stoped, and slept over, by a little hotel near to the karakorhum higway. I don  t remember the name of the hotel anymore. The next day we where glad to stay over, because of the dangerous road to Hunza.

"The Southern Pakistani Brides and Grooms can also try these Wedding Clothings, specially the Lady&#39;s Cap under the Shawl, looks amazing.  If I was a Bridal Wear designer in Pakistan, I would definitely take inspiration from Wakhi People and other Northern Pakistani cultures and adapt them to Southern part of Pakistan where 95% of 220 Million Pakistanis live.  The true Beauty of Northern Pakistanis is their SIMPLICITY in life.",Zain Abidin,2021-02-13T09:21:47Z,0
"Thank you Eva Zu Beck, for showing such a beautiful side of my country Pakistan.  It took a foreigner to show us Pakistanis that this is also Pakistan.  The reason is simple.  Our Pakistani Media or Politicians, do not care much about Gilgit Balistan. Specially Pakistani TV Channels and there are 500+ TV Channels in Pakistan, and almost None of them show such weddings, and cultural experiences of our country. The Media people usually focus on Politicians, and Political Talk Shows, and just busy spreading Negativity.  They should promote Science, Positive Cultural Aspects, willingness to adapt some of the common practices of our own people, like these Wakhi people, and most Southern Pakistanis can learn alot of our own people from Northern part of Pakistan, specially the level of Tolerance and sense of community.  Ismaelis are a very highly educated and well connected group of people in Northern Pakistan, that truly look out for each other.  This can be promoted in rest of Pakistan as well.",Zain Abidin,2021-02-13T09:16:17Z,1

Similarly all of the Christians are associated with educational institutions and medical institutions. They are educated minority. Some poor sections face problems but that is because of poverty not because of their religion. The same poor Muslims have the same problem. Stop seeing us from the lense of hatred. Please come.

In islam you cannot be converted unless you accept it from heart.<br />Even if someone force you to pray in islamic fashion and made you read quran forcefully and make you do all the rituals forcefully. That doesn&#39;t make you muslims. It is between God and man. You have to accept it in your heart. Otherwise continue practice islamic religion but you won&#39;t be a muslims. So if anyone is forcing others. That doesn&#39;t make their victims muslims because they do not accept from Islam from heart,amazing facts,2021-02-03T18:29:58Z,0

"@W K no it’s because Pakistani is literally a multi-ethnic country so there’s many cultures in Pakistan that some Pakistanis don’t knows about. E.g. I’m Pashtun and visited areas where we met Balochis, Sindhis and Hazaras. It has nothing to do with her being white and filming because there’s white people who are also Pakistani. It’s impossible for people to visit and learn about all the different ethnic people in Pakistan.🇵🇰",Zakir Khan,2021-04-12T17:54:21Z,3

"I like the DESI feel in the video.<br />We do all the preparation ourselves but also take out time to dress up ourselves for the function.<br />I&#39;m from india but I can relate to the vibe here. It feels so good.<br />So many people come to the house days before the marriage and even though in the day everyone is busy, even at night anyone barely gets to rest. Just the children sleep in a room and adults are here and there calculating stuff planning for the day after. <br />Ah....desi marriages are my favourite. <br />And that thing about inviting everyone personally is actually such a big deal. People don&#39;t go if you invite them over call. Its really really rude. It feels like you don&#39;t care about them enough to give them an invitation card. <br />Ah I feel so happy rn. <br />I&#39;ve a few friends in Pakistan and one day I hope I&#39;ll meet them and we can enjoy our cultures together. I feel so emotional. It&#39;s so hard to be friends because sometimes people near me are like &quot;eh! You are friends with pakistanis? You&#39;re unloyal to the country&quot; even though they say it out of fun but it hurts because my Pakistani friends are the ones who help me get through my hard days.<br />Ah looks like I got too emotional.",oolalalalaaeyooo,2021-01-24T06:15:36Z,2
Mountain tribes have so beautiful culture. Not saying that other tribes ain&#39;t beautiful but the ones from mountains have something unique to them. The vibe they give off is so pretty.❤❤,oolalalalaaeyooo,2021-01-24T06:08:21Z,0

@amazing facts Wakhis are subtribal groups originated from Afghanistan and its originality is Pashto tribe. Yes we have more Pashtuns in Pakistan than India but there is more both combined in Afghanistan.

For close relatives higher family memebers goes to invite for example to Grand parents or first uncle and aunties on both sides mother and father of the bride or groom goes to invite. <br /><br />In large families this process starts about two months before the wedding.,Muhammad Zubair Javed,2021-01-20T08:55:23Z,1

"I belong to Gilgitbaltistan. I read some of the comments below, which forced me to answer a few questions.<br />Gilgitbaltistan is a disputed area between India and Pakistan. But 99% want to be part of Pakistan. Even though they are far away from citizen rights. Pakistan is running the entire region on orders from Islamabad.<br />These people are called pamairians or wakhi people and live in the  mountains in northern Pakistan, Xinjiang (tashgurgan - Kashgar), Tajikistan and Afghanistan. There are different ethnic groups in Hunza(brusho,shina,kaltaro,Uighur,momini) some claim they came from Macedonia but no one knows the reality. majority of them are brusho people and speaking brushaski language. <br />Yes .there are few families living in Indian occupied kashmir they are brusho people(hunza people). they actually fled from hunza state when there was kingdom. <br />Majority of people follow Ismailism. That&#39;s why there religious beliefs belongs to Iran and central Asia specially badakhshan. Nasir Khisraow was a Ismaili preacher from badakhshan who converted these people to Ismailism and promated religious customs.",RK Vlogs,2021-01-19T16:31:17Z,1

I love their way of weddings celebration. But it’s hard to think that the man are allowed to be married up to 4 times if they can afford it. So just like you said. It’s a sweet/ Bitter celebration. Not unless they are soulmates.,Olivrian Vegaslife,2021-01-18T23:18:14Z,0
@amazing facts I hope that’s the fact for my three friends who lives in Pakistan and none of them are the first ones. The other one is even living in poverty. My cousin is married to a guy from Saudi Arabia. She told her husband that there will be no second or third wife. Because she will divorce him here in America lol. So far the guy is behaving. 👍🏻,Olivrian Vegaslife,2021-01-20T01:25:23Z,0
Man can marry 4 times if he can create equality among all which s very difficult. Usually Muslim men marry twice if they don&#39;t have child or else. Otherwise 95 percent of men practice one wife.,amazing facts,2021-01-20T00:41:43Z,1

I married a Pakistani girl thinking that she will be more compatible with my own family which was very much financially dependent on me, that she will cook for me and give my future children a good Muslim upbringing.  Well, none of that happened. After 20 years, my loveless marriage ended up in divorce.

"@amazing facts incorrect, you need to get your facts corrected. We don&#39;t go to Jannat by killing others. We go to Jannat by performing the good deeds towards the humanity. <br /><br />Getting information from the correct source doesn&#39;t makes it fake only for the sake that it doesn&#39;t suits your narrative. You don&#39;t know the meaning of brainwashing. Example: Rejecting the correct narration even after knowing it from inside that &quot;yes, it is correct&quot;, because, you are trained to believe only on one thing that shall suit your liking and if it is a disliking. IT IS FAKE. That&#39;s the real Taliban. <br />We should follow ALLAH Ka Islam and not Mullah ka islam. Follow Prophet and not Extremists. If this is done, terrorists like Taliban will not get the recruits and will end eventually, ending the problems in Islamic Society in return.",Piyush Choudhary,2021-01-13T21:44:33Z,0

"@Piyush Choudhary What in the brainwash are you saying? Literally, LITERALLY, go to Pakistan ask people if they want to live in India. 99% would say no. The image of India in Pakistan isn’t like India is some Switzerland lol. I’m saying this from experience while you’re saying it from what? Listening to some ‘activist’, living in India? <br /><br />They’re 100s of ‘activist’ like him who get paid for saying crap against Pakistan. Doesn’t make it true. Recently PTI won elections in Gilgit Baltistan. They also made the decision to make it a province of Pakistan. We’re not seeing protests there the same way we saw protest in Kashmir when article 370 was revoked. <br /><br />Culturally, religiously, and even genetically the people of Kashmir are closer to their Pakistani brothers and sisters.",TopSecret,2021-01-13T17:02:37Z,1
"@Rahman Khan I derive my ancestory from Indus Civilisation whose southern most site lies in Maharashtra and northern most site lies in present Afganistan, current residents in the northern parts(special reference) of Subcontinent previously &quot;Bharat Varsha&quot; hail ancestory from Central Asia especially &quot;Gilgit Baltistan&quot; or are a mixed population with the natives. Not only Central Asia, people came from West Asia too and mixed with the natives and current population is the amalgamation. Coming to your point i.e. &quot;claim&quot;, as I said &quot;you need to get your facts corrected&quot;, we can claim even the whole Pakistan as it is an Illegal country made on the basis of religion, knowing the fact that the Two Nation theory&quot; failed and  Muslims are more prosperous in India than in any other place.",Piyush Choudhary,2021-01-13T17:02:28Z,0

@Hidayat e Muslim one is dance for sexual enticing. Other is a cultural dance. You dad&#39;s Arabs also do it. On dafli. Their sword dance and other dance are part of culture. And are allowed as they are modest and doesn&#39;t conflict with Islam. So is there cultural dance which is only done by boys and in round circle.<br />All the songs are to wish best of luck to bride and groom infact they are poems wishing happiness for bride and groom.

This is Kalash tribe a minority group based in Pakistans Pastunkhwa region in the foothills of Himalayas. They are the descendants of Alexander the Great&#39;s troops 23 centuries ago when he attacked Northern West frontier of Indus region(Now Pakistan).

Wow nice video. Wahi people seems very liberal and gives more freedom to women more than any other part in Pakistan. I have seem a video where girls got killed just for dancing at home in Pakistan.  Very happy to see women enjoying wedding like men do.,གཡང་ ལགས་,2021-01-11T05:25:34Z,0

@Blue Nightfox Pakistan has so many cultures that it’s hard for me to give you an exact answer. I didn’t even know culture like the one shown in the video even existed in my country 😅. Well I’m from Lahore and over here women and men dance together. We have this thing called dance showdown. It’s basically a dance competition between the groom side’s family and bride’s side’s family. I think dance is a big part of most Pakistani culture but I think the more conservative areas of Pakistan might be strict in terms of male and female dancing together.,musa,2021-01-16T20:56:08Z,1

The onley problem its that you are hiden the fact that thiss people are ALBANIAN desents thei came with the great ALESANDER from ilirycum Albanian in to day known territory off Macedonia..and you dindt let thei owne music playin in background cos you didit to hide the fack that thei are playing Albanian music that are used even to day in albania and me as a albanian i woud anderstand in very wired way what thei are talking about..the way off thei weding its not much diferent from the wedings off northen albania...if you study ILYRICUM-ALBANIANS your mind will blow from the fackts that thiss Blod line and the langue to gather with thei history and culture you will cleary see that its did influenc the western civilisation in foundation off the culture and langue..but unfortunatly its most atacet blod line in europe even to day thei do not arlou uss to bring out the good value off the ILIRO-ALBANIANS..the truth will blou your mind belive me if you studie thiss mater..<br />Ps..keep in mind the Albanian langue  its the richest off them all and even to day ther are 36 leters in alfabet in sted off the english one with 9 or 10 leters less than abanian langue and its means than you have a biger gama off explonation and talking in albanian you have move shance to explain complicated langue like space talking or madikal or low making oratori its very comen among albanians cos off thei (our) very rich langue compering to the other langues off the world..,Grozdan Stanislav,2021-01-10T12:59:47Z,0

To be honest the discussion is over when you can&#39;t even defend yourself and refer me to someone else, that&#39;s shows me you have no concrete beliefs in the first place and you are simply just blind following others  maybe because they belong to a certain school of thought you agree with, boring.<br />Philosophy: personally studied philosophy in the UK and arguments from scholars of ilm Al kalam are very well known and documented. It&#39;s ridiculous you even brought that up.<br />Architecture: this is even more ridiculous comming from an Indian, all this mughal architecture is from who? Modi ji? <br />Engineering astronomy maths: again if you only knew basic knowledge of the history of each of these fields you would feel dumb even mentioning them. But unfortunately your just blind following others without looking at the facts, yet you think you own them yourself.

These people live on STOLEN LAND. Balti Culture and people are far more related to Afghanistan &amp; Tajikistan. Along with the Dardics of Central Asia. So heartbreaking that their beautiful identity has been washed away with your RIDICULOUS title. Change the title of the video NOW. This is NOT a Pakistani wedding. Why are you spreading false information and lies?? You are full of Pakistani propaganda. You should really learn the history of Pakistan and the different ethnic groups. More than HALF of Pakistan’s land DOES NOT belong to the Indian/Punjabi/Desi South Asians!! These are marginalized people who have been forcibly assimilated into a Punjabi culture! These people have thousands of years of their own history and culture and it is being washed away by brainwashed tourists like you who don’t even do their research!,RūdābaJān,2021-01-06T16:01:41Z,0
"A Russian breed Afghani on RAW and RSS payrolls questions the identity of a society that has preserved its culture and history for thousands of years. We did not give up our culture for dollars like you, many came and invaded but we retaliated and kept our identity, and recently we took  on DOGRAS and forced them to flee. Pakistan is indigestible to many people for various reasons especially to those who have sold their consciences.",Ibex Travel,2021-01-07T05:46:54Z,0
"@Lover here Is a sheep follower of the oppressors. they are NOT Pakistani. It’s a fabricated identity, you are erasing ancient cultures and histories that still exist with the word “Pakistani”.. Wakhis have always been a part of Afghanistan. Are you denying that Balochistan and Khuber Pakhtunkhwa, along with even Kashmir and Gilgit-Balistan to some extent, are not Iranic lands?",RūdābaJān,2021-01-06T22:54:04Z,0
"maybe if you actually did your research you’d find that the people of gilgit baltistan rebelled against the dogras in favour of joining the newly created Pakistan, how do these people live on ‘stolen’ land when wakhis are native to it? dial down your hate, you can criticise a country and it’s government without bringing in populations.

"HAPPY NEW YEAR 2021.☺️👋🙏<br />PLEASE JUST THINK.....<br />Every human is relieved that Corona year 2020 has passed. All of us would be HOPING that in new year 2021 we will be FREE from painful experience of Corona. But however, there are other living beings who are continuously suffering quietly and about whom we NEVER THINK and bother ie. ANIMALS.... Kindly LOOK into the EYES OF SUFFERING ANIMALS.... You will clearly see the sadness and pain in the eyes of these animals.These silent living beings are suffering so much but STILL we humans never care. They are put in enclosures so SMALL that they can&#39;t even MOVE.They are CHAINED and CAGED for LIFE. They die of desease, extreme cold, hunger and thirst. They are killed BRUTALLY for meat.They are used for MEDICAL experiments. They are ABANDONED on roads to die by pet owners. They are not given food and water. Every time they are treated cruelly by humans for no reason. Humans are angry with humans but they vent out their anger on innocent animals. Animals suffer so much due to humans. But they never complain. So then WHY are humans so cruel to them????!!!!<br />ANIMALS would also be EXPECTING AND HOPING every MOMENT that one day humans will treat them KINDLY. They will someday get freedom from chains and cages. People will feed them and take care of them when they fall ill. But their expectation is broken every moment.... HUMANS NEVER UNDERSTAND their pain. <br />If HUMANS WERE CHAINED and PUT in CAGES similarly for LIFE, BRUTALLY KILLED for meat,  treated barbarically by other humans, abandoned, left to die of desease and hunger in extreme weather conditions, used for medical experiments, how would HUMANS FEEL? Why cant humans understand how animals would be feeling when THEIR EXPECTATIONS are broken every time?<br />IF WE STILL CANNOT UNDERSTAND their pain and be kind to them then HOW we think ourselves worthy of being treated kindly? If humans cannot be kind to animals, who are so pure and innocent, who never hate and don&#39;t have any ego, who FORGIVE humans instantly, who readily give LOVE and RESPECT to humans, then how can humans expect same kindness from others? SO JUST THINK.....  MAY BE THEN YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY GO THROUGH EVERY MOMENT WHICH HUMANS WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FACE EVEN FOR A MOMENT.<br />SO PL MAKE A RESOLUTION THIS YEAR THAT YOU WILL HAVE A CHANGE OF HEART FOR THEM. PL HELP ATLEAST ONE ANIMAL THIS YEAR....KINDLY ALSO PL DO NOT HARM THEM IN ANYWAY.....If possible then please RAISE YOUR VOICE against animal cruelty in social media and in your locality....YOU WILL SURELY FEEL GREAT.....HAPPY NEW YEAR ONCE AGAIN. GOOD LUCK EVERYBODY.🙏",Animals Never Hate.,2021-01-06T11:48:25Z,0

They’re more central Asian than south Asian. That’s what makes them stand out from the rest of Pakistan/Pakistanis,Churti,2021-01-06T01:40:53Z,49
"@Churti the ppl of Pakistan need to gear up their basic readings on geography, cultures and different communities in Pakistan. They are alien to different regions n get perplexed when they wittness anywhere on media, later they strt making assumption about thm which is mostly hustile. Now appreciating diversity is yet a different aspect that will cosy decades to learn it. As part of Hunza region v know what annoying mentalities we face when they visit out regions and later uploading vidoes with false assumptions.",Naheed Akhtar,2021-01-12T20:48:32Z,0
@Naheed Akhtar yes agreed! Just because the boarders are man made &amp; are clumped in to one area due to politics does not mean we should erase or undermine the true origin &amp; identity of some people who are clearly distinct from the rest. The Wakhi and people of hunza are the perfect examples in this case. Rather We should appreciate diversity &amp; not get offended by them.,Churti,2021-01-12T20:30:50Z,0
"Thank you, its Hunza peopl, they diverse in the particualr region, lower, central and upper hunza, which is also called Gojal. The centeral Hunza people are burusho who are Mecedonians in origin, and the people of Gojal are wakhi, Tajik in their origin. Genetically the whole region differs from rest of different regions in Pakistan and socially as well as culturally, thts beauty of diversity i believe. The community is Shia Imami Ismaili muslims who stand out as well or most educated community in Pakistan.",Naheed Akhtar,2021-01-12T20:21:46Z,1

People dont know know how diverse Pakistan is. People from Northern most parts of Pakistan look like eastern Europeans and one cannot imagine they could be Pakistani. I showed a similar type of video to a friend of mine in London and he didnt believe they were Pakistanis. I think the Govt hasnt paid much attention to establish those areas and to help such beautiful people and culture come out even more. <br />I thank you for doing this job as showing  not only people of Pakistan about the beauty of their own country but also showing it to rest of the World that Pakistan and its people are Beautiful.

They look so different from Pakistanis,Jasi Perroni,2021-01-04T14:16:17Z,0
"@Jasi Perroni Pakistan has always been a land of immigrants. People have been migrating here for thousands of years. So people come in all shades of skin color.  My own mother and her mother were as white as one can be. And my father was so dark that even some Pakistanis thought that he was African!  In Pakistan you can find people with blue eyes and slightly blonde hair and black people whose ancestors were from Zanzibar and came through Oman which once ruled Zanzibar and is just across the water.  Then there are Hazaras whose ancestors were Mongol, not to mention some Uyghurs who made their home in Pakistan.  When Pakistan came into existence, a lot of south Indian people, such as Tamils and Keralites, also migrated to Pakistan. And in 1971, when Bangladesh become independent, many Rohingya people from Bangladesh migrated to Pakistan.  So Pakistan has just about every race that you can imagine.<br /><br />I forgot to mention that when I had my DNA test done, it turned out that I have a haplogroup which is extremely rare in South Asia but common in Europe, Turkey, the Fertile Crescent and some parts of Africa. I also had 2% Mongol ancestry.  Strangely all my children, when they were born until age of 6 months, looked very, very Mongol.  People always remarked that they look &quot;Chinese&quot; but overtime their Mongol features somehow diminish. My childhood pictures are the same. Ha ha ha.",Aalem Faazel,2021-01-04T22:39:37Z,0

"You’ve committed one hell of an editing mistake. Since this community has its own unique language and music, you didn’t show any of that during the whole documentary. Instead, you’ve butchered our ears with that cheesy Pakistani background music. I mean, sometimes it’s counterproductive to keep narrating and describing everything that comes within a frame. I know, it’s a vloggers’ bad habit to be mouthy all the time, whereas a raw footage  can convey what thousand words can’t do. This was a documentary I guess, not a simple travel vlog.<br />Anyway, congrats to the couple and their family. Mashallah, What a gorgeous King &amp; Queen. And as they say over there: Pankistan, Zindabad. <br />Cheers from Africa. 🍻",Sassy BT,2021-01-04T05:36:36Z,1
"Sir, with due respect. I don&#39;t know the technical boundaries while making a blog, vlog  or a video.<br />For us (Pakistanis) , the name, &quot;Eva Zu Beck&quot; is more important. She visited our country, when no one dare to come. She showed all the positive of Pakistan to the world. When global media was portraying us as an evil nation. She was optimistic about us, when we were at our lowest mental stage. She had beliefs us to be No.1, when we were thinking ourselves, zero.<br />Pakistan owe her a lot. <br />For her love &amp; efforts towards Pakistan. <br />Would you please, ignore her technical mistakes ?<br />Lots of Love from Lahore",Azmat Nabi,2021-01-04T07:35:31Z,0

The mountains are simply stunning the different cultures and customs within the colours and vibrant nature of the country makes you feel alive I really want to walk in those mountains again but alas with COVID we are not allowed to leave Australia.<br />One day I’ll go back there again seeing your videos of Pakistan makes me realise once again what the mainstream media doesn’t show the rest of the world what an amazing place it is.👍👍👍👍👍,Mick Angelhere's World,2021-01-04T05:19:58Z,576

"Actually they live in pakistan but most of their traditions including even their traditional clothing it’s not from that area. Hunza, kalash According to some data they are there since Alexander the Great, when some soldiers after the death of alexander decided to stay in this area. They where illyrian soldiers or today albania-macedonia. This costume of this women who’s getting married is the same like one region in albania called Mirdita. You can check On google Mirdita traditional clothes",Illyrian,2021-01-03T22:17:33Z,4
"Ah that does not mean they&#39;re not Pakistani lol. If hundreds of years back my ancestors were Arabs, I don&#39;t become an Arab. They live in Pakistan because their ancestors chose to make it their home. In those times, most cultures were partially or entirely nomadic so by your logic, since they kept moving around, they only absorbed your culture? Cultures are almost always the result of centuries of mixing with other ethnic and racial groups so it&#39;s never a separate thing. My traditional clothes look very similar to some central Asian traditional dresses. It doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the exact same culture. This is their home and like all populations, their culture too has formed as a melting pot of different civilizations but they&#39;re part of our people for centuries now.",Aamna Here,2021-01-05T18:31:41Z,3

"Are not these people in Pakistan from the descendants of the Illyrian-Albanian soldiers of Alexander the Great, because they look different from the typical autochthonous Pakistanis. Do not be there from Pamir-  pa-mire (albanian) - good view English), or Burrash - burre (Albanian) - man or Kalash  -kala (Albanian) - castle.

"@Syd MurtProbably, we are always dealing with an assumption. But I have seen a documentary about this community and many things that have to do with culture, some toponyms of settlements or mountains, have a pure meaning in the Albanian language today.

"ALERT!! ISMAILIS ARE NOT MUSLIMS<br />Eva make correction in the vedio please.<br /><br />Ismailis are not Muslims, they are the followers of Aga Khan who they call their present Imam and practice none of the five pillars of Islam. They way Qadianis/Ahmadis claim to be Muslims the ismailis claim to be Muslims too while the Mainstream Muslims reject them both. Take the example of Hajj the 5th pillar of islam. Ismailis do not go to Makkah to perform Hajj, Instead, their Hajj is the sight/glimpse of the Aga Khan himself! Astagfirullah. May Allah guide us all.<br /><br />To learn more about why Ismailis are not Muslims watch this vedio of an ex-Ismaili who converted to islam.<br /><br />Here is the link: <a href=""https://youtu.be/eH7pgrecfoE"">https://youtu.be/eH7pgrecfoE</a>",Bushra Sadia,2021-01-03T16:39:56Z,4

"Ohhhhhhh 😒 so sad.<br />In our cultures here... ! If someone wants to separate, families sits together !! I mean elders...all of them.<br /><br />Just Old dudes of family, not girls or womans are allowed as they will provoke the hatred more as womens mention those tiny tiny things such like ( she looked different to me or stare me or she don&#39;t speak with me) <br />So father and grandfather of boy side and girl side sits together and Asked Questions from boy and girl (only they will sit infront of them. <br />Just husband and wife ! And due to pressure of their elders they solve it out by themselves before reaching to Elders.<br />But if it reachs then...they solve it out if boy is arrogant or like something or he is attracted to someone or something like that.... members from both family gathers first make him understand if he doesn&#39;t then beaten up so he may never harm or do anything to His wife.<br />That&#39;s how it solve out.<br /><br />We have like u can say almost zero divorce ratio or something.<br />And also our religion Islam forbids us from separation but its not compulsory if woman can&#39;t make it then She may get divorced.<br />Also if they have Childrens then It won&#39;t take a chance they will be separated coz elders never let that happen.<br />Our culture is different from the wedding you are seeing.",Muhammad Uzair,2021-01-03T16:29:16Z,0

"It&#39;s weird that we shy away from showing an animal being brutally killed, but that&#39;s the way meat is being done every day. If it&#39;s not good for our eyes to see, then it surly is not human food. Also milk are only made for babies, and steeling the milk from a mother is also not natural, and is very cruel to the baby of the species we are steeling it from.",Christian Williams,2021-01-03T14:37:17Z,0
"@amazing factsEven if the milk was taken after the mother weens her young, that milk is still not designed for a human and will cause people to develop our number one killer which is heart disease and other ailments.",Christian Williams,2021-01-03T19:33:27Z,0
"@amazing facts Science has shown that humans are not meant to eat meat. They even do better without to thrive. It&#39;s not for nothing that you say it&#39;s not for fun or enjoyment that they do it, it&#39;s basically just tradition, a box that they have put themselves in and are afraid to break out of. Eating meat and dairy is the number one driver of deforestation in the world, it is the biggest driver of species extinction and ocean dead zones. Also all of our infectious disease come from mistreating animals for food, by either keeping them caged, enclosed or by hunting them and destroying their habitat. This is how pandemics start, by doing one error, thinking that animals were food for the human species. This is also the only reason why we still have food poisoning, these things only come from animals and fish. Also eating meat and dairy is the biggest contributor to our biggest killer of human beings which is heart disease and strokes, it also contributes largely to people developing diabetes and certain bowl cancers. Animal and fish agriculture has been plaguing mankind for a very long time now, and we will only start to be called civilized when we stop abusing and killing animals and fish as it is not our job or will to do so.",Christian Williams,2021-01-03T19:31:11Z,0

Hundza is a people of Illyrian origin Albania.  Ly people have settled here in Pakistan since Alexander went to fight in Ind.  Alexander the Great was an Albanian and his warriors were Albanians.  These people still wear the traditional clothes of Albania,Elias Leo,2021-01-03T14:17:10Z,2
"@Elias Leo    Greece  spoke  Albanian???  wait  what???   Did  Aristotle,  Archimedes,  Herodotus  write  their  book  in  albanian??   you  can  find  ancient  greek  language  in  all  Balkan  &amp;  middle-east,  they  are  not  albanian  language...  There&#39;s  no  evidence  of   albanian  language  before  13th  century....    <br />i  feel  like  i&#39;m  talking  with   a  stone...   i&#39;m  done,  bye..",꧁Райан замановиц꧂,2021-01-03T18:26:42Z,1
"Yes I understand you very well but the whole story was twisted a little 2 or 3 centuries ago.  All of Macedonia and Greece spoke Albanian and in 1821 many refugees from Asia Minor came to Greece and in Greece it was populated by a little Romanian-Bulgarian and formed the language now called Hellenic and not Greek because the Greeks spoke Albanian then while the autochthonous Albanians  deported to turkey.  I am talking many centuries ago that in Greece, Macedonia, Kosovo and a part of it was taken by Serbia, it was Albanian land, Illyria.  In 1821 many things changed and Albania was torn apart and left small and they took a lot of land",Elias Leo,2021-01-03T18:11:08Z,1
"@Elias Leo   hahaha...  Alexander  was  born  in  Pella, Macedonia (Modern day Greece)   and  he&#39;s  a  Macedonian,  not  greek  nor  albanian...   Alexander  spoke  Macedonian  language  which  later  hellanized  by  the  greek....    Albania???  There&#39;s  no  albania  before  13th  century..  You  should  read  history  first...  Go  to  Oxford  or  Havard  and  read  world  history...   your  fake  history  which  they  teach  you  in  albania  are  not  accepted  outside  albania  lol....

This  people  are  called  &#39;&#39;Wakhi&#39;&#39;  which  is  a  Indo-European  people  of    Eastern Iranian branch...           &amp;   the  dress  they  wear  is  a   traditional  iranian dress...     Iranian &amp;  Albanian  both  are  Indo-European  people   that&#39;s  why  their  traditional  dress  looks  similar...     iranian   are  one  of  the  oldest  Indo-European  people,  older  than  albanian  &amp;  illyrian....     <br />2)  Alexander  was  a  Mecedonian,  not   albanian....       stop  posting  non-sense...  no  one  believe  in  your  fake  history  which  not  recognized  anywhere  in  the  world....",꧁Райан замановиц꧂,2021-01-03T17:23:10Z,1

"@محمد Pakistan also relies heavily on American aid. Without the aid, they&#39;d be riding on donkeys and sleeping in mosques. I think they still do that over there. Regardless, I blame the U.S. for providing aid when there was ample evidence of state sponsored terrorism. The entire state is corrupt and seeds funding to terrorist organizations. Pakistan is the textbook definition of a failed state. It is sad given the fact that the people and country itself is great.",John Fischer,2021-01-19T04:30:13Z,0

I didn’t even know Pakistan had places and cultures like these....this is my home country what is wrong with me?😂 this is why i love your channel you’reliving my fantasies of travelling for me ❤️,A A,2021-01-03T13:08:03Z,490
"I agree with you.  I am Pakistan American, and I think main reason for Pakistanis not knowing about such places in Pakistan exist is due to lack of Pakistani Media&#39;s coverage of such places.  Look at what they show us on Pakistani TV, just Politics, negative news about Pakistani, etc.  Less than 1% of 500+ Pakistani TV Channels, even show anything about such Positive things, specially related to Northern Pakistani people like the Wakhi people.  Its a shame, really.",Zain Abidin,2021-02-13T09:11:35Z,0

"<b>Main 13 saal ki age se cooking kar raha hu, masterchef mera sbse favorite show tha and then maine thaan lia tha ki mujhe Chef hi banna hai but mere ghrwale kehte the... Bawarchi ban ke kuch nahi kr paoge wo chahte the main bhi engineering karu apne bade bhai ki trah... But mere bade bhai ne mujhe samjhaya and usi ne mujhe suggest kia ki apni skill dikhana hai to abhi se start ho jaao... To maine soch lia tha ki main Youtube channel khol kar apni recipe logo ko dikhaunga hi and then 9th me maine ek channel channel start kia tha but mmy papa mana kr die the ki abhi pdhai me dhyaan do ye sb mat kro 12th ke bad krna jo krna hai...but 12th tak wait krna boht zyada ho jata isilie 10th board ke khtm hote hi maine apna new youtube channel &quot;Cooking beast ayaz&quot; chalu kia 7 May 2018 ko... And uske baad se recipe videos upload kr raha hu ...
