"Those who are surprised to grow coffee in Saudi Arabia .. I tell him in Saudi Arabia the finest olives in the city of Al-Jawf, in Al-Qassim the finest types of dates in the world, and in Taif, the finest types of aromatic roses, and in Jizan the finest types of mangoes and jasmine flowers, in Najran oranges, in the pomegranate courtyard, and in the city of Tabuk, Astra farms which It is the basket of fruits in Saudi Arabia and a lot .. But production is little due to the scarcity of water in Saudi Arabia, and there are no rivers in the Arabian Peninsula.",عبدالله,2021-01-13T00:14:41Z,1

"Coffee, nice!. Its also an area that grows alot of ghat (probably a little more south than this locaction) down through the moutains and into the Yeman.  If coffee is being grown instead that, good. Ghat has done so much harm in Yeman. But right, a stunning area and really only very recently opening up to toursits from outside. The roads are some of THE most demanding and can seem like a lifetime to travel short distances; not much fun when it gets hot. Hope you had fun.",Jonny Walker,2021-01-02T00:21:31Z,0

"@moser bear oh, you mean criminals and drug dealers who they devoted their lives to make the life of peaceful citizens miserable, yeah sure I really don&#39;t care if they are gone from my life. also, you need to know that beheadings are basically the execution sentence, and it is done in other places as well like the USA but they use other methods fulfilling this sentence, not only Saudi Arabia. This harsh sentence is not something easy to give, it takes a long and complex set of trials from different judges that they agreed on, crucifixion is to give a reminder for those who dare to disturb the peace, order, and balance in this land, because of these unforgiven laws Saudi Arabia is relativity safe.<br /><br /><br />please go spread your hate somewhere else, nobody likes you",Gwizdo,2020-03-04T12:01:57Z,0

"I am a skilled psychologist from Yemen, I once drunk a cup of coffee mixed with the menstruation blood of a 26-year-old female, I actually spent the night in a coma due to physiological and spiritual intoxication, and during the coma, I had the most disturbing nightmares ever:-<br /><br />1- Well, I know this might sound a bit odd and random, but I have dreamt of Zeus mating with a palm tree and begetting an ant that is capable of crawling on the edge of the Higgs Boson!<br /><br />2- I once also dreamt of my mitochondria protesting to break free from my organelles , claiming that nature has enslaved them !<br /><br />3- On that night of a full moon, I dreamt of Professor Noam Chomsky eating books and regurgitating the field of Modern Linguistics!<br /><br />4- The funniest dream I ever had, was when I had a vision of a Neanderthal swallowing a whole apple, and it played ping-pong with his heart while passing down his oesophagus!<br /><br />5- The most disgusting dream I ever had, was of a female&#39;s menstruation blood turning into jelly and been marketed by an Oompa Loompa as Halloween treats! <br /><br />I regret not listening to mummy and staying away from &quot;coffee-menstrual shots&quot;, now I have developed a neurological disorder!<br /><br />Do you guys think that my dreams have any philosophical implications at all? <br /><br />Given that I&#39;ve been hearing my neurons conspiring to abandon the dwelling of my skull, things don&#39;t seem to be heading in the right direction, ever since!",Ali Al-Mahdi,2020-03-03T04:55:09Z,0

"I&#39;ve been working in KSA for 8+ years now. My education and background is partly British, but my ethnicity is Jordanian, geographically not far from SA. Only very recently did I start exploring the country. To my astonishment, this country has so much to offer. SA is so prodigal of her natural gifts. It&#39;s a pity that I&#39;ve wasted a good number of years thinking that SA is just a bunch of modern cities built amidst lifeless desert terrain. Now because photography is my hobby, even my life-long passion, I&#39;ve been taking stunning landscape photos of the country wherever I go. When I share them with kith and kin back home and further afield, they all unanimously ask the same Q: Are you sure this is Saudi Arabia? It&#39;s interesting to discover first hand how reality can be startlingly such a far cry from pre-misconceptions.",Theroro Ned,2020-03-02T20:36:04Z,32

Unfortunately, the state suspended its work<br />Most people want the return of the religious police<br />Because it guarantees the protection of women from the causes of sexual harassment<br />Because of the dress and the solitude of the woman<br />With the foreign man etc ...<br />Saudi women are veiled, there are Saudi women of Turkish, Indian, or Egyptian ancestry, etc. These people have a different culture from the indigenous people<br />Those who own the international channels, the Zionists, the extreme right and the left, all of them hate Saudi Arabia<br />It is normal to find many false news",عبدالله,2020-03-02T16:32:40Z,1

"I am from Srilanka and we&#39;re known for our mountains of tea. But a little known fact is that before tea was brought by the colonisers, we used to grow coffee! Very little physical evidence exists still, but in some mountains, old coffee &quot;jungles&quot; can be found.
