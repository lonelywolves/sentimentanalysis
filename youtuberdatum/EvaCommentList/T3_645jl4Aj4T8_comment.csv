"God loves you so very  much that He sent His Holy Son Jesus from heaven to earth, to be born of a virgin, to grow up &amp; die on a cross for our sins, and to be put into a tomb 3 days and rise from the dead the third day, and He (Jesus) went back up to heaven. We must receive Sinless Jesus sincerely to be God&#39;s child(John 1:12).After we get saved by grace through faith in Christ, if we truly love the Lord Jesus Christ, then we will obey Jesus(John 14:15).  Mark 1:15 &quot;And saying, the time is fulfilled, &amp; the kingdom of God is at hand: Repent ye, &amp; believe the gospel.&quot; Jesus said in John 14:15 &quot;If you love Me, keep My commandments. &quot;There&#39;s a real hell. It says in Revelation 21:8 &quot;But for the cowardly, and unbelieving, and abominable, and murderers, and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone...&quot; Please sincerely receive Holy Jesus and put your true faith and trust in Him today &amp; repent! :)",Ginger Marie,2021-03-30T18:52:52Z,0

And i felt so &quot;kilig&quot; (am sure your boyfriend is familiar with the word KILIG 😊😍) when you reached to the top/summit... i regret why i didnt know your vlogs earlier. anyhow, thank you for sharing all your adventures with us. your vlogs are worth a million views and subscribers and likes and shares...

"In 2016 I had the chance to get to Tanzania - Arusha and climb Kilimanjaro on the Machame route. The 6 days spent on the mountain were like a life lesson for me. It is impressive how porters lead such a hard life and yet they are happy and cherish every moment! My guide&#39;s name is Goodluck ... what a good name for him! and in the camp before the summit I asked him how he can always be so happy ?! and his answer was ... others are starving, and I have a job from which I can support my whole family! ... his earnings not exceeding $ 100 per month! All my appreciations go to the porters!",Andrei Gherasim,2021-03-17T15:10:32Z,2

"I read one article of a guy that climbed kilimanjaro and he said that if you really want to stand up on the top of the mountain, then dont go with a large group. Because and first of all you need to rest and want your own pace, If you go up with a group of 10 or more people, then you will wait for the slovest ones, and then you would arrive late to the next camp site, and you wont be resting or sleeping as you would if you would be in a grop of perhaps 2-3 people + a guide/sherpa ect. Also dont underestimate weather conditions, above 5000m can be at night -30C, and so you need to wear a gear and wear a proper hiking boots in which wont freeze you toes of.  In those large groups only 30% arrive at the top, altitude sicknes is a b*.",retkvi,2021-02-08T10:43:02Z,0

"I really enjoy your content, but I think doing all of this whilst half the world is in lockdown and people are stuck at home and not travelling for the greater good, I feel it’s a bit inappropriate for you to just continue your travels as if you’re exempt from what the rest of us have to go through.

"Delighted that my favorite travel vlogger has just released a video of her Kilimanjaro climb, via the same route I travelled last year, including the rare Western Breach and Crater Camp. She obviously did a much better job representing the same experience. Her half hour vividly captures the emerald velvet forests, soul-stirringly starry night skies, glossy treacherous western breach rocks, glorious dust-rimmed glaciers. And the views. Oh, the views! We are all luckier that she added this incredible place to her shared travel experiences. Thanks, Ms. Zu Beck!",Jessica Russ,2021-02-06T17:28:18Z,3

"I&#39;m a masai  from Monduli, Arusha and I want to explain about the our Maa  Medicin. It could have been better that you use a Medicin maybe two  days before you journey that you body will get  a little bit used. Those Masai Medicin are real healthy and can make you strong and stronger and always stay healthy. Since I&#39;m age of 12 I never went to hospital or use any kind of hospital medicine until now I&#39;m 30. So you can see that it&#39;s real nice but you also have to use with milk that it will not be so much dry.<br />Thank you for visiting our home beautiful country.

"Congratulations on making it to the top Eva.<br /><br />Back in 1998 I climbed that mountain on the The Marangu Route (the so-called tourist route) and stayed in cabins, not tents. Not much time to acclimatise on that route; day 1 to Mandara, day 2 to Harombo (half way), day 3 on an acclimatisation route back to Harombo, day 4 to Kibo. Day 5 starting just after midnight to start the final ascent arriving at Uhuru Peak at 8 am, then heading all the way back from the Harombo. So an ascent of about 1,200 metres followed by a descent of 2,200 metres; a long day which took 16-17 hours. Day 6 was back to Marangu Gate. <br /><br />It&#39;s called the tourist route, but it&#39;s probably got the lowest success rate of any of them as there&#39;s little time to acclimatise. Some operators miss out the acclimatisation day. That is brutal as it means starting out at Marangu gate at 1,870 metres and about 70 hours later you are up at 5,900 metres (assuming out start at Manrangu at 10 am and arrive at Uhuru. If you flew out the day before from sea level, that&#39;s less than 100 hours from sea level to 5,900 metres. <br /><br />Don&#39;t ever do it that way. The longer you get to acclimatise, the better and especially above 4,000 metres. <br /><br />I did get there - barely - on a schedule that got from Marangu to Uhuru in 94 hours. A few observations<br /><br />The Kibo to Uhuru and back down to Harambo is absolutely brutal. Much worse than getting to Everest base camp, simply due to acclimatisation and the very steep climb through scree to the crate summit. There was a lot of snow on top when I did it; that was tough.<br /><br />One shock. At Harombo, we were woken up with a loud banging on the hut door with a woman&#39;s voice shouting in panic in German. When we&#39;d got up, she&#39;d gone. Next morning, there was a crowd of people around a tent, as a German man had died in the night. <br /><br />Trekking poles. For the first time in my life I hired some and hated them. They ended up strapped to the back of the rucksack and I carried the damned things all the way up and all the way down again.<br /><br />The final ascent was horrible. I threw up because I was breathing so heavily. I couldn&#39;t believe it when I go there. <br /><br />Coming down off the crater down the scree slope was amazing. Bouncing through the soft, fine powder we got down in about 40 minutes what it took 6-7 hour of slog to get up. <br /><br />At the end of the summit day, it&#39;s 16 hours, I just slept for hours. <br /><br />My first thought. On coming down from Uhuru? Thank god I never have to do that again (next year I went to Everest base camp which was a breeze compared to that). <br /><br />There was an American couple in our group doing the route on their honeymoon. Why?<br /><br />My certificate number was 4658/98, and that was in late October. If I read it right, fewer than 7,000 climbers (excluding guides) probably completed the climb in 1998.",Steve Jones,2021-02-05T18:03:20Z,0
