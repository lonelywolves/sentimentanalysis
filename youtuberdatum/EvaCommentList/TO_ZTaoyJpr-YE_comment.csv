"I truly love Middle East. Its population and its landscape are something I could not be able to describe. I have never been in Syria, but I wnt to Lebanon several times for business and I appreciated so much all the people I met there that I will always preserve them in my memories. <br />People suffered and still suffer too much there in Middle East. Despite of this they are still capable to smile and they did not forget kindness and hope.<br />I feel a deep and sweet sensation when I think to the Middle East and to its people. It is hard do describe what I really mean but it is something of really deep.<br />Everytime I have been in Middle East I felt myself at home. <br />Love from Italy.",Dale Cooper,2021-04-27T11:28:38Z,0

How profoundly you touched the lives of desperate people! Thanks a heap and I would like to congratulate you on your wisdom and boldness 💫💫💫I hope this vlog silences  some stupid narrow minded people who assume that the people just migrate by choice! And I hope this type of videos can be used as examples that neither Syrians nor other forced immigrants are not so enthusiastic to leave their OWN lands. How come the rest of the comfort-zone guaranteed so called elite people can think that those oppressed people are happy in having to live an utterly different life styles!? We have to do something all together to halt this stupidity ! Enough is enough!!!,sezen elif Boran,2021-04-23T16:51:34Z,0

Maybe you were also able to visit the thousands detained and daily tortured in Saidnaya? Were able to take a big laugh about the tens of thousands that were massacred by Russia and Bashar in Aleppo and those who had to flee?

(uniform dress) ... you showed my country in a way similar to your documents about Iran or Iraq ... even though you know that it is radically different ...

My heart aches as I&#39;m seeing these ruins, and I can&#39;t help but cry. The people of Syria are jewels on earth, my Algerian parents have never stopped singing their praises. <br />But as the events unfolded, we couldn&#39;t help but feel helpless, we could only help financially and through relaying the events on social media and around us...

Man kann nur erahnen wie schön diese Stadt einmal war. Mancherorts sieht es aus wie Würzburg 1945. Wir hier haben dazugelernt und die Zivilisation ist angekommen im vereinten Europa.

The people in this video will suffer from these sanctions, now, in addition to what they all went through already.<br />It is not over yet.

"Syria was the first country I fell in love after Pakistan. I did not even know at that time it called Syria because we call it SHAAM. I was in the early teenage, no internet access, and vlogs were not there to show you.  The only way to know and get knowledge was by reading books. I read a travelogue by a Pakistani writer. he has been to many countries but the way he describes our dear SHAAM was amazing. Even after more than ten years I still remember some lines. &quot;Almost every shaami loves &quot;umm -e-kulsoom&quot;. Then if you ask address from the local shaami he will first serve you &quot;kehwa&quot; and then will go with you to the destination. &quot;as I told you he was a Syrian then there is no need to tell that he was beautiful(it is obvious)&quot;. so shaam was my dreamland. I wanted to travel and see its people, their hospitality, and their kindness. It was just a perfect crush.  But then that crisis and everything. but it does not break my dream. And after viewing the Vlogs you have made especially of Damascus I am hopeful that Syrians will make a comeback. Time does not remain the same. All dear Syrians will go back to their homeland and will live happily. Insha Allah. My best wishes to all my Syrian brothers and sisters. May Allah help them.

What is filmed is actually not what really happens in Aleppo. In real life there is still a war a you can‘t go around filming the city that just can’t be done. Somehow in someway you got support to film the city to show the people watching the video that Aleppo is fine and they are rebuilding and so on.. but that’s far from the truth.,Beshr Nakishbandi,2020-09-07T21:59:01Z,0

"No government in our world today is really what we want it to be, in Syria, in France, the UK, the US, Poland or anywhere else. However put that aside for one moment and consider what was unleashed on Syria that led to the destruction of Aleppo. Very well armed (by the fascist Gulf States) psychopaths with no education, culture or understanding of history  murdered and tortured their way around Syria bringing misery and suffering where they went. They used food as a weapon to keep the local population quiet, beheaded &quot;unbelievers&quot;, pushed government workers off the tops of high buildings and threw Syrian soldiers under moving tanks. This was done by the The West as part of the Geo political game against Iran in which civilians are merely pawns. When the Syrian army fought back against these enemy agents they were called tyrants by the Western governments and media. What then should we call those in the halls of power in Washington and London who dreamt up this plan for Syria?

"I was there in 2005,  Yes it is a nice city, ,but not all  people are nice, I was hired as a western union teller, but when I reached in Aleppo my sponsor told me to clean their house also, 1 slept at 2am and wake up 6am. They treated all their workers like an animal, I run away with 2 friends, we went to many jail in 2 months and reached Damascus before they finally free us. At the airport, the   police who sent us  denied I have passport but i fought, I was the last one who went inside the plane all the crew telling me to go fast but I turned around and stamp my foot on the ground murmured one day my God will revenge what you did to us..  but during the war i watched innocent children  died  it broke my heart..",missbhawa wow,2020-08-13T15:25:05Z,0

"Dear author of the video! I share your desire to stay out of politics on the travel channel. But the trick is that propaganda somehow shapes your worldview, and you can&#39;t stay out of politics, especially if we talk about the one-sided position that the German media reports. Why did I bring this up? Because at the very beginning of the video, right after your words about distancing yourself from politics, you say that the parties to the conflict were: the Syrian opposition and the Syrian government. I have a leading question: can those who participated in the &quot;opposition action&quot; in Germany at the Olympic games on September 5, 1972 in Munich be called oppositionists? How would you feel about calling such people &quot;oppositionists&quot; instead of their real name? I don&#39;t expect an answer, I don&#39;t need your answer. I just want you to think about it for yourself.",Гамулятор,2020-07-29T12:34:09Z,0

It&#39;s great to be able to see the world but doing so in areas that are known to dislike westerners and treat women as property is not the smartest of things to do. I know you freebirds out there like to go to these areas to try to make some point that there are good people all over the world. Of course there are hospitable people in most all corners of the world including Syria but these trips are just foolish. The main channels of news usually don&#39;t report on the travelers that get killed but it happens far too often with liberal minded people letting their ideology shape their perceived reality. Check out the video - The Tragedy of Cultural Relativism (from Paul JW).,BockwardsOne,2020-07-27T00:46:50Z,0

"I found this video so moving that it brought me to tears.  Although I&#39;m Australian,   I met a Syrian family online about 7 years ago now.  We ended up adopting each other as family.  We have been through the experience of my adopted son when he was feeling very low because he&#39;d had to leave his town near Damascus because he was being dragged off to prison and tortured, because he was educated and owned a thriving business.  He had to flee to a refugee camp in  Jordan so that his pregnant wife and very young son would be safe because when he was taken to the prison, it was from his home, and in front of his young son.  It was not safe for this to happen in front of them. The military had already bombed and totally destroyed his businesses. This was done at the hands of Assad.  His wife and young son eventually joined him in the camp in Jordan leaving everything they had left.  My son gave his house to his sister to live in with her children.  Unfortunately the house had barrel bombs dropped on it a few times, making it impossible for her and her children to live in. Sadly I saw photos of the house after just the first barrel bomb was dropped, and although I could see that it had been a lovely modern home with all of the modern conveniences.  I can&#39;t even imagine how my adopted daughter was feeling when she had to leave her lovely home, not only with a young son to care for on her own, but she was also 6 months into her pregnancy.  The conditions in the camp were so poor that the little boy was really suffering with malnutrition.  They managed to find a basement in which to rent just 2 weeks before their beautiful little girl was born. The kitchen sink was all they had in which to bath the baby. They only had one hot plate to prepare and cook food. The rent was too high for them to continue  living there, but they were fortunate enough to find a house to share with a few other Syrian refugee families.  They each only had one bedroom to call their own   with the rest of the areas communal.  I had been doing all I could to sponsor them to come to Australia.  This was taking so much time that my son was becoming so despondent and frustrated that he even considered paying to get a boat to Turkey.   I was so scared that he would actually do this.  However,  his wife became pregnant again, so this was another member of the family for them to worry about, especially as it had been a difficult pregnancy and birth.  However, the wonderful news to hear, was that Canada had so kindly offered to interview them for relocation to Canada and the opportunity to become Canadian permanent residency.  The third baby was only weeks old when they were flown to Canada only 2 months after their first interview!  I can&#39;t tell you how thrilled I was for them.  They managed to find a lovely home to rent, including furniture that the owner left there for them.  He had also been a refugee so he understood their situation only too well.  My son already spoke and wrote pretty well in English,  but both he and his wife went to &#39;school&#39; to become fluent in English.  The children now not only speak their native language,    but now speak English and are also learning French at school.  They each became Naturalized Canadian citizens a few months ago.  This has been a journey of many ups and downs,  but it&#39;s one that has had a very, very happy ending!  Of course I receive photos and videos of the children playing outside in the park while calling out to one another when deciding on whicn swings, etc they are going to ride on.  And, for the very happy ending to this story, they had another little boy who was 8 weeks early and so tiny that he had to remain in the humidy crib for the first few months,  but he&#39;s also a happy, healthy little Canadian born little boy now!   I still find it hard to believe just how much we have experienced together .... and I am so very proud of them for the resilience they have shown even in the darkest of times.  Not only are they grateful for the opportunity that Canada has given to them, but I also know that Canada will also be proud to have them as citizens of Canada.",Wendy Maxwell,2020-07-14T15:14:18Z,130

"The destruction of all that history is truly heartbreaking. I&#39;ve met someone who used to live in Aleppo; he walks with a cane because a bomb fell beside his house. It&#39;s madness that we should be so willing to do that to each other - in Syria, in the USA, in Ukraine, even in Canada. I hope that we can all do better, and my heart lifted as you showed the city starting to rebuild. But as you say, the history will never be the same. thank you for this video, as hard to watch as it is.",Neil VA5WX,2020-07-08T16:09:12Z,1

"I thought you may find helpful to understand the key and pivotal role that the &quot;international community&quot; which otherwise is more aptly known as the international mafia, played in the destruction of Syria and it&#39;s human inhabitants. Beneath is a short summary followed by evidences :<br />.<br />Before I begin, I would like to make clear that what took place in Syria, WAS NO CIVIL WAR. It was a war for liberation by it&#39;s people against a tyrannical brutal dictator, who was backed, supported, and aided by the &quot;international community&quot; and their henchmen in the Muslim world.<br />. <br />The Americans, in order to protect their order ( the architecture which the US had established, see reference below ) within Syria, enacted the role of &#39;good cop bad cop&#39; and persuaded Russia, in return for favours ( &#39;missile defence&#39; and the &#39;Minsk agreements&#39; with respect to Ukraine, see below ), to play the &#39;bad cop&#39; with the American being the &#39;good cop&#39; and thus together they besieged the people and unleashed violence and utter destruction upon the people of Syria in order to break their will against their stand against the Syrian tyrant backed and supported by the US, on the one hand, and on the other hand (the good cop role ) the US staged conferences and negotiations in order to make the people of Syria submit to the demands of the Americans through contrived &quot;negotiations&quot;.<br />.<br />=====================<br />=====================<br />=====================<br />.<br />FYI ( evidences ) :<br />.<br />The &#39;contrived negotiations. ... General Dempsey, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff: &quot;It is my belief that the [rebel] side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not.&quot; ... &quot;The UN backed chemical weapons proposal aims at doing precisely just that; buying more time in order to facilitate the formation of a transitional government dominated by “Moderates” and mediated by the U.S.&quot; : <a href=""http://www.revolutionobserver.com/2013/10/chemical-weapons-and-us-russia-detente.html"">http://www.revolutionobserver.com/2013/10/chemical-weapons-and-us-russia-detente.html</a> ).<br />.<br />The good cop bad cop act. &quot;If our Western partners plan their actions at least a couple of steps in advance, they cannot be unaware of this,&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said. ( <a href=""http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=10767"">http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=10767</a> )<br />.<br />The &#39;architecture&#39; ... Leon Panetta ( the US Secretary of Defence), in an interview with the CNN in July 2012, said: ”I think it’s important when Assad leaves – and he will leave – to try to preserve stability in that country. And the best way to preserve that kind of stability is to maintain as much of the military, the police, as you can, along with the security forces, and hope that they will transition to a democratic form of government. That’s a key.” US secretary of state made it clear after al-Assad used chemical weapons in East Damascus that any intervention is not about regime change.<br />.<br />General Martin Dempsey, Barack Obama’s military advisor and Chairman to the joint chiefs of Staff : “Syria today is not about choosing between two sides but rather about choosing one among many sides. It is my belief that the side we choose must be ready to promote their interests and ours when the balance shifts in their favor. Today, they are not.&quot;<br />.<br />( U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry )Kerry said he and Lavrov ( Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ) also discussed talks between Moscow and Washington on cooperation in missile defence. &quot;I think we are in a place now where the next step of that discussion can take place regardless of what happens with respect to Iran,&quot; Kerry said. &quot;We would like to reach an understanding with Russia and I think Russia would like to reach an understanding with us.&quot; ( <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/07/kerry-assad-chemical-weapons-destruction_n_4055786.html"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/07/kerry-assad-chemical-weapons-destruction_n_4055786.html</a> ). And read about Minsk agreements in respect to Ukraine, a plan put forth in response to American proposals to send armaments to the Ukrainian government and thus destabilising Russia&#39;s own back yard.<br />.<br />The &#39;bad cop&#39;, &quot;It is necessary to first convince the opposition (to attend). But maybe it&#39;s time to start using a different verb - to force the opposition to take part in the conference,&quot; Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ( <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/16/us-syria-crisis-russia-idUSBRE98F09P20130916"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/16/us-syria-crisis-russia-idUSBRE98F09P20130916</a> ).<br />.<br />Here ( <a href=""https://news.sky.com/video/assad-is-not-our-guy-hes-your-guy-11328027?fbclid=IwAR1_QxHY9P9Pld2ycP-NAs23-F3IeVLyD3svU_qa70Tjr0IeL851DVljPqg"">https://news.sky.com/video/assad-is-not-our-guy-hes-your-guy-11328027?fbclid=IwAR1_QxHY9P9Pld2ycP-NAs23-F3IeVLyD3svU_qa70Tjr0IeL851DVljPqg</a> ) is an interview with the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman spilling the beans when she said &quot;Assad is not our guy, he&#39;s your guy&quot; (SKY News).<br />.<br />Here ( <a href=""https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/01/14/1178686/-How-the-US-help-put-Assad-in-power-in-Syria"">https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2013/01/14/1178686/-How-the-US-help-put-Assad-in-power-in-Syria</a> ) is an article explaining &#39;How the US help put <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23assad"">#Assad</a> in power in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23syria"">#Syria</a>.<br />.<br />&quot;There&#39;s also a necessity for the selfish interests of both sides for cooperation, especially if one looks at the long term situation of Russian,&quot; Kissinger said ... In that sense, Russia can be trusted to carry out the Syrian agreement negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry, but that does not mean Putin &quot;has suddenly been converted to our point of view,&quot; Kissinger said. ( <a href=""http://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/kissinger-putin-syria-islam/2013/09/22/id/527048#ixzz2fmfLijmO"">http://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/kissinger-putin-syria-islam/2013/09/22/id/527048#ixzz2fmfLijmO</a> )<br />.<br />The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement it published upon its internet site on Thursday 08/10/2015, “In line with the authorisation of the Russian President Putin and his American counterpart President Barack Obama at the end of their meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Conference, the two respective foreign ministers sought to finalise discussing the ways of settling the situation in Syria, which from one angle includes the necessity to avoid accidents happening in the sky above Syria in addition to strengthening the political settlement in Syria in accordance to the Geneva declaration on 30/06/2012” (Al-Hayat: Electronic copy, Wednesday 7 October 2015).<br />.<br />Russia’s aggression on Syria in 30/9/2015 directly preceded the Obama-Putin meeting on 29/9/2015, and the meeting lasted 90 minutes; the Ukraine crisis has occupied the first part of it, while the two presidents focused on the situation in Syria in the remaining part. The results of this meeting were seen immediately “on 30/9/2015 the Russian Federation Council agreed unanimously on Putin’s request to use the Russian Air Force in Syria.” (Russia Today, 30/9/2015)<br />.<br />Even the sites that were hit by Russia in Syria were mostly in agreement with America, CNN reported on 4/10/2015: “Gen. Andrei Kartapolov, the military official in the leadership of the Russian Army General Staff said on Saturday evening 3/10/2015: The areas that have been targeted by the Russian air force in Syria were introduced to Moscow as areas harboring terrorists only, by the US military command. The official continued to say as quoted by the Russian agency Tass: “The United States of America notified us via common connections that no one exists but the terrorists in these areas.”<br />.<br />The strong coordination between the Russian and American aircraft in the skies of Syria has been even described as training: “The US Department of Defense, Pentagon announced on Tuesday 3/11/2015 that the Americans and the Russians tested successfully a mechanism allowing their pilots who carry out operations in Syrian airspace to communicate directly to avoid any accidents. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Davis said that the American fighter jet “conducted a communications test on Tuesday, which was prepared with the Russian fighter jet” in Syrian airspace, pointing out that the test lasted “three Minutes “and” achieved its objectives “…. For its part, Russian news agencies said, citing a general in the Russian armed forces saying that the US and Russian air forces have conducted joint training in Syria on Tuesday.” (Al-Arabiya Net, 03/11/2015)<br />.<br />Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, September 23, Interfax - Should the Bashar al-Assad regime fall in Syria, the Islamists will arrive, said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ( <a href=""http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=10767"">http://www.interfax-religion.com/?act=news&amp;div=10767</a> ).",Mohammed Naseer,2020-06-27T22:10:58Z,0

The boy still want to eat more, he still hungry,  but the mother has to pass  it to the his sister, i can see the mother seems hungry too. My tears out.",Makrecha n,2020-06-01T02:15:55Z,22

"She had tears in her eyes on so many occasions. I am a INDIAN by the way. These are civilian places. Hundreds of thousands of  innocent children, women and men must have died. Yet, who cares for the Syrian people. Its only when a few people face some situation in the richest parts of the world, its only then that things matter. Sorry to disappoint Eva and many more Syrians, who are optimistic that construction and good days will come soon. But will they  ??? Syria and their neighbors are in this condition because , some people want them to be. So they are not coming out of this. At least not in the next 20 years. Maybe if there is a THIRD WORLD WAR. Maybe then.",INDIAN,2020-05-31T10:38:00Z,0

"The conflict in Syria was made possible by the intervention of Western countries led by the United States, which wanted to export so-called Western democracy to a Muslim country. If it were not for Russia, Syria would not exist as a state. When your Western governments interfere, there is always war, the collapse of states, the death and suffering of civilians. This can be seen on the example of Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan and many other countries. Leave your democracy at yourself home. Please do not interfere in the affairs of other countries!",Батыр Раджабов,2020-05-28T02:44:52Z,1

"This girl is absolutely clueless by visiting such a dangerous place alone. I have been to several countries in the Middle East and I have friends who have been there too. I will not even go on the merit that local women are subjugated by their husbands. The fact is that Western women are constantly harassed, even in tourist groups and this is considered normal in their culture (several times, precious metals and also camels were offered in exchange for my sisters and even for my girlfriend). It amazes me that she is walking there alone on the street and on top being uncovered, it makes a fake sense that it’s a safe place to visit.",F RL,2020-05-16T12:42:51Z,1

"This is the price to pay when injustice passes unchecked. The US could eliminate AL-Assad&#39;s regime but they refused to, they even refused to let the free Syrian army finish his regime. 1 Million dead and 14 Million refugee, yet no petty for the Syrian people. Hypocrisy is the rule when it comes to the right  of any Arabic country to set itself free from tyranny and oppression. Let the world know that victory will come, whatever the cost.

"Our culture and civilization in Middle East are  devastated and became the victims of political between capitalism and in Power country in the west. I’m from Iraq they devastated our country like Syria. We were number one in civilization and education, industries. Forced us to immigrate and leave our land. I’m very sad when I see this Vlog.

I’m glad to see that Damascus hasn’t almost being damaged, but I cried seeing Aleppo, once the pearl of Middle East. But, you know what? We can rebuild the city! Yes, we all, and in my country is also contributing, there’s a project called “Alepoh”, which aim is to make bricks in order to rebuild schools, hospitals, etc, and many of our historical buildings have a “Syrian stamp”, so our architects and historians are also studying ways to rebuild Aleppo as similar as it was, using similar techniques.

"I am extremely bothered by “travel vloggers” who attach more importance to visiting “exclusive” places that other tourists do not visit than to take moral responsibility. And then hide behind fake neutrality and claim to be apolitical. You are not. With the visa application and this touristy trip, you legitimize and normalize the Assad regime which is responsible for the destruction of Syria, millions of displaced persons, hundreds of thousands people killed, the disappearance and torture of countless political prisoners. A regime that systematically slaughters civilians, bombs hospitals and uses forbidden chemical weapons. The genocide is still going on today. Your visit is very political and you should be ashamed of yourself.",Natasha Yasir,2020-04-17T13:59:27Z,2

"This piece moved me, it brought tears to my eyes. I am not Syrian; nor have I been to Syria; but I did travel in Jordan many years ago and I have seen the souks of Cairo and Istanbul. I sense though that Syria, Syrians and their grand souk were different, expressions of a unique place in human culture and history. I truely mourn that I shall never step into and feel that place with my owe flesh and blood.  But maybe there is a way through the stories and experience of others and the records they have left. And I pray that the spirit of that place will live on and give rise to a new creation where we can get a direct glimpse of this place and a scent of its dust and spices and ovens, and hear the  beautiful chaotic sounds of its streets.

"Thank you Eva for your perspective and I appreciate you filming your travels in Aleppo and sharing it with the world. <br />Admittingly, I put off watching this video for a while because although I love seeing footage of my beloved city, the thumbnail made me worried that this would just be more government propaganda about how the city is fine and safe. A couple weeks ago (Feb 2020) the government officially took all of Aleppo. While this might mean temporary peace right now... the truth remains in that the government controls their fate. The same government that bombed the city in the first place, the same government that&#39;s currently bombing Idlib, and the same government that thought it was okay to use chemical weapons on its civilians. This kind of peace will not last. True peace will come to Aleppo... but as long as tyrannical dictators like Assad is ruling over it, there will never be justice. And with no justice, comes no peace.",American Nomad,2020-03-16T03:14:06Z,11

"@gentle life  Honestly when the war first started we thought it was gonna be over in a few months, little did we know that the west was backing these terrorists at an extreme point to destabilise Syria and overthrow the current government, the war kept on going until 2015 when one of Syrias allies Russia intervened and helped the Syrian army fight the western backed terrorists, they also helped us with humanitarian aid and vetoing things in the UN, Russia and China used their vetoes in the UN to help Syria. The war continued and now as of January 2021 the Syrian army controls all the major cities and the majority of the country, the terrorists remain in Idlib along the Turkish border where they’re aided by NATO (U.S, Turkey) and Israel even helped fund the terrorists. I now think that the best case scenario is that the war ends this year 2021 however that’s looking unlikely due to ceasefires etc. and a medium case scenario is 2023 and a worst case scenario is 2025. Unfortunately economically the situation is not getting better since the U.S and it’s allies have sanctioned Syria which is resulting in Syria becoming more unliveable since everything have become expensive and the sanctions are also starving people and crippling Syrias already crippled healthcare system. Hopefully the situation will get better however it will need a bit of time. Also in case your wondering I’m half Lebanese and half Syrian.",zzz 1,2021-01-02T03:23:44Z,2

Aleppo is one of humanity&#39;s cradles of civilizations and one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world: Wheat agriculture was first discovered here; soup was also invented here, and so many empires rose and fell upon this land.<br />Though I probably will not witness it myself, I hope one day, Aleppo gets back on its feet.",S.

Questo e un bellissimo video che viene fatto con molto coraggio in un posto che non doveva succedere queste tragedie !! Purtroppo l&#39;uomo e la guerra  ci sono due cose che sempre sono state insieme dal più antichi tempi e 😢 purtroppo in questi anni!!  Però e stato un piacere a rivedere le persone a ricominciare a vivere la vita e riconstruire tutto!!  Grazie mille per questo video e complimenti per tutto che fai !!! Peace and  Pray for people of Siria !!!,Predescu Constantin,2020-01-12T19:12:20Z,0

"Thank you Ms.Beck for that extreme effort you showed. None the less, the issue is not just about a couple of stones and places being destroyed, rather, the issue is way more bigger, a lot of people were killed and displaced; the stones and how the city looks are the last things I would think about. Side note, One of the houses that you passed through during the video was my grandfather house, I mean that I am one of the people of the city and we lost a lot; it is not just about a couple of stones being back to the old cool days. And again, you are amazing person and you have made a great job. Regards,",Silver .Kurt. Edu,2019-12-25T17:54:50Z,0

@Uzair Aezad Indian media is allowed in Kashmir. They report almost everyday. Communication is blocked so that Pakistan can&#39;t spread it&#39;s propaganda to mislead youth into joining terrorism. People of Kashmir want jobs and prosperity and that is what the government of India will give them. So don&#39;t spread lies.

"Thankyou for reporting on the current situation in Syria.  Very good commentary, etc.<br /><br />It is indeed very erie to walk through a recently devistated city.  Reminds me of walking through the ruins of Plymouth, Montserrat.  But of course Allepo was caused by war, where as Plymouth was destroyed by a volcano. I think I was the only tourist there as well. <br /><br />It has been very hard to find news from Syria, since the apparent end of hostilities.  I am glad to see people rebuilding. <br /><br />Thankyou for your report.",Toby Riccard,2019-12-21T20:48:46Z,0

"So there are a bunch of youtubers doing &quot;travel content&quot; in (let´s just say) more or less troubled areas of the world and on the one hand, especially in the case of syria this is a good thing. You are really helping those people getting back on their feet and rebuilding their wartorn country by visiting them, talking to them, of course buying souveniers and showing a quite different of perspective of the country than the media for the last 8-9 years. On the other hand, and this really troubles me not just on your videos but all of those youtubers, those videos are completely uncritical about their own intention. You have to be very very privileged to even come up with the idea of travelling to such places. And even though you try not to be political in this video, one can find postcolonial tendencies at many moments. Of course this is also due to your western socialization but you don´t seem to be aware of this fact.<br />Also, let´s say you wouldn´t indirectly spread postcolonial views of the not-western world, what if something would actually happen to you? Let´s say you get abducted (and I really hope this never happens to you nor anyone!). Security forces have to go in, risk THEIR lives in order to free you. And if you or one of them dies doing that than what for? For someone who ran around more or less dangerous places just so you can put it on youtube? Would this really be worth risking other peoples lives?",Qliphoth N,2019-12-20T11:05:47Z,1

"When I studied in Germany in years 2000-5 I met few students from Syria. <br /><br />I must say in my opinion they were the best people from all Arab nations which I met in Germany. One of them lived in the same floor in the same dormitory as me and we played few times chess. He gave me Syrian sweets and till now I have the package which is very nice, in Arab, Syrian style, in golden colour. The guy was from Aleppo and he came from a decent, rich family. His name was Adi and he planned to study medicine in Germany, probably in Heidelberg. <br /><br />I am very sad and upset because of the fact what happened with the beautiful and prosperious state of Syria and all the pain and suffering the Syrian people had to go through. What a big injustice!!! And who is responsible for this?? I blame above all usa and israel, the 2 most evil states on the planet!!!",KowalskyLeon,2019-11-25T17:26:35Z,0

"As a Palestinian from Jaffa this video really hearts and gives a slight hope, my grandfathers didn&#39;t live in age of Internet and high technologie that could&#39;ve give an eye for people around the world to show what catastrophe the western colonialism/Zionism brought to my homeland, Nakba in arabic.<br />These images from Aleppo are 1 to 1 same images that are incised for generations in our minds and souls, imagine these results that you see in that video, in the whole complete country, all big cities like Jaffa which is today &quot;Tel aviv-Jaffa&quot;, Haifa, Jerusalem, Akka and more. 450 hundred villages completely erased from earth, one of them was Majido, the village of my grandfathers who had to flee from it to a nearby town called Umm el fahem (translated/mother of coal), &quot;luckily&quot; that town was located inside the &quot;green line&quot; separated from our neighbors family and friends in west bank couple hundred meters from the Apartheid wall, which means that town is today inside the regime terror state &quot;israel&quot;. there are very few photos and bad quality videos from the result of that ethnic cleansing that included, deportation of hundred thousands of Palestinian outside Palestine, and complete deportations of Palestinians from the big cities to 97% of its population, the cities were like ghost cities from Hollywood horror movies, tons of dead bodies, add to it the ghettos inside these same destroyed cities, my people and grandfathers were in a concentration camp, the most inhumane conditions you can imagine, starvations later on they proceeded experiments and high-rate dangerous radiation on Palestinian children and non-caucasian or simply jews that immigrated/settled in Palestine not from EU or non ashkenazi jew, like Moroccan jews, or Yemeni exct.. causing chronicle diseases that includes cancer and what not, i myself have MS since 3 years and my cousin has it too and 1 aunt. this disease is very rare and its from the chronic diseases that is incurable all you can do is delay bad progression and treat it and all researches and the progress of studying that disease and fight are very few. anyways as you said in the video and what i mentioned in my begining of my comment, there is hope even when its very little its there and we the new generations are fighting and thriving to make a change, to fix things, to make it better for out future for the gneration that will come after us, and the least is, to give awareness for people and eyes, to the other side that the media isnt excited about exposing it for reasons if ill write here, some may call me &quot;extremist&quot;, &quot;conspiracist&quot;,  &quot;anti-semite&quot; will first guess what im more semite than most of the zionists who destroyed my country combined, <br />to learn who rules over you, simply find out, who you are not allowed to criticise.<br />of course for us Palestinians, its clear like sun because these people we saw them in action we saw them watching us in joy dying, we know who rules us, but do you?<br />Thank you for the video, and if you the reader, read everything word till here, cheers and raise up! :)",ultrahapoel99,2019-11-21T18:06:33Z,0

"Nice, professionally made video with a true heart touching commentary. I had few Syrian friends while working in Middle-East and they were truly friendly in nature other than few stories I heard about their Mukhabarath who use to forcefully take nice good looking vehicles from the tourists before the civil war. Even the President Assad is very well educated and while talking, talks very logical even though he was not in politics for too long thereby gives me a feel that he is genuine. I never miss President Assad interview. In brief, we Indian like Syria and Syrians and feel extremely sorry for what happened to the citizens. Why don&#39;t you people come and stay with us as we are already over a Billion and another 30-40 million does not make much of difference for us. A simple request from Syrian Government to our Government should allow this migration practically happening. As such we have a huge Iranian and Iraqi population studying in our universities and Syrians can also take the same path. Our population has 30% Muslim population (2nd biggest Islamic population in the world after Indonesia) thereby Syrians may not feel the cultural gap.

But I see them and I can&#39;t help but realize that territories alone do not make countries. it&#39;s the will of its people that makes a country what it is. it&#39;s their pride and attachment to their identity and unique culture that makes a country withstand battles and war. you can burn grounds and bomb houses but as long as the people learn how to love their history, there will be hope for a stronger tomorrow. thank you for the video it was great!",Nouritsa,2019-11-11T19:23:11Z,0

It meant a lot for me to watch a short video of the city I once called home , although it looks much different and more tragic than the one I left 16 years ago , but it looked like I have been watching a part of my character and my soul .. <br />you are such an emotional and sensitive person Eva , you are lucky you got to see the city I spent more than a decade of life in .. <br />thanks a lot",Rami Dabab,2019-11-07T13:36:22Z,0

i spent 2 months in Aleppo and Damascus working with Jordanian crews taking in emergency supplies and UN peacekeepers  I had a friend who had a family resturant near the old market. one day we left the resturant with the girls in the crew and people started throwing stones at us and spitting at the girls. we had just spent the afternoon at the art exhibition in town. My friend bundled us into 2 taxis and we went back to the hotel. The next day we went out again same thing happened.  Talk about nasty narrow minded people. Oh by the way my friend was totally ashamed of out treatment.,B B,2019-11-03T10:41:55Z,0

"Your words are art. Such a beautiful deep soul. Thanks for the hope that shines from your words and lens. <br />I was once talking to a British friend  who happens to live in Saudi just like me . I was explaining to him how chaotic my life is and how lost I am right now because of the uncertainty of my future. <br />I asked him , if you were in my shoes, what would you do ? Stay in Saudi unsettled , immigrate to a far and totally new place and struggle building a new life again  or go back to my destroyed , wounded country &#39;Syria&#39;.. <br />He answered, That must be really hard. I can&#39;t even imagine it but maybe you&#39;re meant to go back and help re-building your own country again..<br />. His words deeply hit my heart. The idea has never crossed my mind before.

This is not just Aleppo&#39;s heritage, it&#39;s part of OUR HUMAN heritage... These monuments survived the test of time, they&#39;ve been through countless wars, the wrath of nature, as well as other devastating events... But we managed to destroy them within less than a decade... I&#39;m happy that the people of Aleppo are rebuilding their city, but the extent of the damage and destruction to the once beautiful heritage is devastating, it&#39;ll never be the same again...

I am from Iran and I have been following the region’s situations and issues and problems for so many years and I have traveled to all of the countries and cities of Middle East, and I assure you, where ever the conflict and war is, you can see the foot print of Iran’s Islamic Regime for sure. Look at Lebanon, Iraq, Yaman, Palestine and Iran’s Proxies and their influences. With impartiality you would see the Role of Iran’s Islamic Regime.

"The human tragedy of war is inexcusable. As for the city itself, I am actually quite surprised how quickly it sprung back to a relatively normal life! I was under the impression that basically the whole city was wiped out. But it seems that there are parts where you see almost no signs of war. The Baron Hotel also actually seems in decent shape from the outside. The old souk damage is much more significant but seems repairable. I&#39;m more worried that due to obvious limitations it&#39;s probably not gonna be reconstructed into the pre-war historical state, but a wild &quot;modern&quot; rebuilding will take place.

"Варун Джа <br />Dear Syrian people, do not ever forget that, if Syria is in such a devastated and miserable situation, mainly and mostly is because of the role of bloody Iran’s Islamic Regime (not people of Iran of course). You may or may not agree, but, this is the reality. And, of course I have not forgotten other countries’ interference and roles in this significant issue, but, Iran is the main cause. I am from Iran and I have been following the region’s situations and issues and problems for so many years and I have traveled to all of the countries and cities of Middle East, and I assure you, where ever the conflict and war is, you can see the foot print of Iran’s Islamic Regime for sure. Look at Lebanon, Iraq, Yaman, Palestine and Iran’s Proxies and their influences. With impartiality you would see the Role of Iran’s Islamic Regime. So please help and support the Iran’s people to get rid of this criminal Islamic Regime, so in return, you will see peace and calmness in your country.",Gem Master,2019-12-30T03:11:54Z,0

"Years ago, I met a lady from Aleppo. She was a single mother, hard working, did anything that was honest toil. She would cook for other people, washed and ironed clothes, taught Middle Eastern cookery at night school, etc. She lived in a nice apartment with her son and had a really good life in a very nice part of Melbourne, Australia. And it was all from her hard work, her dedication to giving her son a good life. If she is anything to go by, I have no doubt the people of Syria will be able to rebuild their devastated country.",elaustraliano,2019-10-12T21:54:06Z,1

"Thank you for sharing your experience. There is great hope for Syria. We have a Syrian vlogger, here in our country in the Philippines named Basel whos family fled Syria because of the war. His house was bombed into pieces.  He was sent by his father to our country to continue his education. He had a hard time adjusting for 6 months to being alone in a country totally different from his wherein 90% of the people are Christian.  But he adopted very well and our people welcomed and embraced him until he was whole again. He calls the Philippines his home now and loves it here. His youtube channel is called &quot; The Hungry Syrian Wanderer&quot;. Hes been a successful vlogger and businessman now here in our country and we embrace his story and treat him like our own  Just like Syria, the Philippines has had its own civil war, political conflicts and had been fighting ISIS in the southern part of our country for decades now. But somehow we are winning because of that human HOPE. Our resilience as a people of peace and kindness has triumped over war. SYRIA will rise again just like us, where Basel can return home. I hope it will be sooner.",Peter C.,2019-10-12T21:22:21Z,2

"I rarely subcribe to travel vloggers who claims that they share good suff on their channel. But this channel is different. The way she jumps into the subject and share the real story behind the news that we watch on tv. It&#39;s just amazing to see how Aleppo is rising up from the civilwar.<br /><br /> I hope and pray that the people living there will soon have their old lives or maybe better lives.<br /><br />Thank you for sharing your story, Eva Zu Beck.

"Hi, I would also like to travel to get my own picture of thid historical town.<br /><br /><br />Did you get any problems with the authorities after your return?<br /><br /><br />I&#39;m from Germany. And here the authorities are doing what they want right now. The 1930s are getting closer and closer. (Especially for certain peaceful and powerless minorities)<br /><br /><br />For example, I am accused of being in Syria. (:)))  So what?!?<br />But I never was. (:(((<br /><br /><br />For 6 years I have been terrorized by the German authorities and there is no end in sight. For 6 years I have not seen my family (wife, children, parents-in-law, etc.) I ask myself why?<br />Oh, probably because I&#39;m a Muslim. There is a lot you can not do: traveling, sports activities, certain jobs, surf the Internet freely and much more.<br /><br /><br />The security authorities (StaSi/GeStaPo) enjoy immunity, no controls over what they do and support from incompetent politics.<br /><br /><br />Well, we do not even have the right to express ourselves to defend ourselves.<br /><br /><br /><br />That too is now Germany. Who would have ever thought that?<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s so sad. But the whole world is getting out of control.<br /><br /><br />Greetings!",Djulaga Balkan,2019-10-09T04:11:42Z,2

Result: 1 million deaths in Iraq and total disintegration of the country; Libya: Total destruction of the country that had the best HDI in Africa and practically everything was given by the government, and today people are selling in Libya!

"Despite you, trying not to be political, you were...at the very beginning you said Aleppo was city where two sides were fighting: Syrian government vs. Syrian opposition. That statement is not just political, but incorrect. It follows well known western propaganda. It was legitimate Syrian Armed Forces (SSA) with it&#39;s allies, against, mostly, foreign jihadists and terrorists (ISIS, Jabhat Al Nusrah, and small number of local jihadists, supported and armed by foreign governments). Aleppo was always multi-ethnical and multi-religious, but secular in it&#39;s nature, and ONLY side, that stands and fights for those values, is Syrian government and it&#39;s armed forces.",ChameleonThe13,2019-10-01T03:44:36Z,0

"@88th Generation Black Death Survivor this is no more than those conpiracy videos about fake moon landings and so on<br />how about you use your brain for a little bit and think? <br /><br /><br /><br />the reason? civil war due to retarded politics (long standing corrupt dictators ruling with iron fist vs some of the fed up population) and retarded religion (islamic radicalism)<br />the inspiration came from Tunisia, after the guy who burn himself, then domino effects as we know it &#39;the arab spring&#39;<br />inspired with successful cases of the arab spring, the populace in syria start to mass demonstration, it follows the same pattern : iron fist dictators quell them with force, gets stronger reaction, ended with civil wars between feuding factions<br />islamists seek the chance to make it into an islamic strict state, came forward and invite tens of thousands of foreigners to go there and join their caliphate with islam to attract them, religiously motivated to do so<br /><br /><br />then foreign nations come into the fray siding with the factions they work with. Russia, being a long-time assad ally and iran side with him, while the international coalition of western and middle eastern nations support the rebels (albeit different motivations, gulf rich islamic nations support about anyone against isis and assad, including other islamist rebels, western nations support the FSA and Kurds, not the islamist ones)<br /><br /><br />so don&#39;t get your tinfoil conpiracy out just to blame &#39;someone else&#39;, the civil war are done mostly by their own locals (along with the foreign jihadis, but mostly locals) , supported on each side with their respective allies<br />thus the situation right now",Andi,2019-10-22T08:30:38Z,0

"Who destroyed Syria? Gen. Wesley Clark told who 12 years ago in March 2007. “We’re Going to Take out 7 Countries in 5 Years: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan &amp; Iran...”<br /><br />AMY GOODMAN: Well, for the rest of the hour, we’ll hear General Wesley Clark in his own words on the possibility of a US attack on Iran; the impeachment of President Bush; the use of cluster bombs; the bombing of Radio Television Serbia during the Kosovo War under his command; and much more. I interviewed General Clark on Tuesday at the 92nd Street Y in New York.<br /><br />AMY GOODMAN: Now, let’s talk about Iran. You have a whole website devoted to stopping war.<br /><br />GEN. WESLEY CLARK: <a href=""http://www.stopiranwar.com/"">Www.stopiranwar.com.</a><br /><br />AMY GOODMAN: Do you see a replay in what happened in the lead-up to the war with Iraq — the allegations of the weapons of mass destruction, the media leaping onto the bandwagon?<br /><br />GEN. WESLEY CLARK: Well, in a way. But, you know, history doesn’t repeat itself exactly twice. What I did warn about when I testified in front of Congress in 2002, I said if you want to worry about a state, it shouldn’t be Iraq, it should be Iran. But this government, our administration, wanted to worry about Iraq, not Iran.<br /><br />I knew why, because I had been through the Pentagon right after 9/11. About ten days after 9/11, I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz. I went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the Joint Staff who used to work for me, and one of the generals called me in. He said, “Sir, you’ve got to come in and talk to me a second.” I said, “Well, you’re too busy.” He said, “No, no.” He says, “We’ve made the decision we’re going to war with Iraq.” This was on or about the 20th of September. I said, “We’re going to war with Iraq? Why?” He said, “I don’t know.” He said, “I guess they don’t know what else to do.” So I said, “Well, did they find some information connecting Saddam to al-Qaeda?” He said, “No, no.” He says, “There’s nothing new that way. They just made the decision to go to war with Iraq.” He said, “I guess it’s like we don’t know what to do about terrorists, but we’ve got a good military and we can take down governments.” And he said, “I guess if the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem has to look like a nail.”<br /><br />So I came back to see him a few weeks later, and by that time we were bombing in Afghanistan. I said, “Are we still going to war with Iraq?” And he said, “Oh, it’s worse than that.” He reached over on his desk. He picked up a piece of paper. And he said, “I just got this down from upstairs” — meaning the Secretary of Defense’s office — “today.” And he said, “This is a memo that describes how we’re going to take out seven countries in five years, starting with Iraq, and then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and, finishing off, Iran.” I said, “Is it classified?” He said, “Yes, sir.” I said, “Well, don’t show it to me.” And I saw him a year or so ago, and I said, “You remember that?” He said, “Sir, I didn’t show you that memo! I didn’t show it to you!”<br /><br />AMY GOODMAN: I’m sorry. What did you say his name was?<br /><br />GEN. WESLEY CLARK: I’m not going to give you his name.<br /><br />AMY GOODMAN: So, go through the countries again.<br /><br />GEN. WESLEY CLARK: Well, starting with Iraq, then Syria and Lebanon, then Libya, then Somalia and Sudan, and back to Iran. So when you look at Iran, you say, “Is it a replay?” It’s not exactly a replay. But here’s the truth: that Iran, from the beginning, has seen that the presence of the United States in Iraq was a threat — a blessing, because we took out Saddam Hussein and the Baathists. They couldn’t handle them. We took care of it for them. But also a threat, because they knew that they were next on the hit list. And so, of course, they got engaged. They lost a million people during the war with Iraq, and they’ve got a long and unprotectable, unsecurable border. So it was in their vital interest to be deeply involved inside Iraq. They tolerated our attacks on the Baathists. They were happy we captured Saddam Hussein.<br /><br />But they’re building up their own network of influence, and to cement it, they occasionally give some military assistance and training and advice, either directly or indirectly, to both the insurgents and to the militias. And in that sense, it’s not exactly parallel, because there has been, I believe, continuous Iranian engagement, some of it legitimate, some of it illegitimate. I mean, you can hardly fault Iran because they’re offering to do eye operations for Iraqis who need medical attention. That’s not an offense that you can go to war over, perhaps. But it is an effort to gain influence.<br /><br />And the administration has stubbornly refused to talk with Iran about their perception, in part because they don’t want to pay the price with their domestic — our US domestic political base, the rightwing base, but also because they don’t want to legitimate a government that they’ve been trying to overthrow. If you were Iran, you’d probably believe that you were mostly already at war with the United States anyway, since we’ve asserted that their government needs regime change, and we’ve asked congress to appropriate $75 million to do it, and we are supporting terrorist groups, apparently, who are infiltrating and blowing up things inside Iraq — Iran. And if we’re not doing it, let’s put it this way: we’re probably cognizant of it and encouraging it. So it’s not surprising that we’re moving to a point of confrontation and crisis with Iran.<br /><br />My point on this is not that the Iranians are good guys — they’re not — but that you shouldn’t use force, except as a last, last, last resort. There is a military option, but it’s a bad one.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Now you know who. America&#39;s wars are Israel&#39;s wars.",Policin Helicopta,2019-09-29T22:19:30Z,0

You may or may not agree, but, this is the reality. And, of course I have not forgotten other countries’ interference and roles in this significant issue, but, Iran is the main cause. I am from Iran and I have been following the region’s situations and issues and problems for so many years and I have traveled to all of the countries and cities of Middle East, and I assure you, where ever the conflict and war is, you can see the foot print of Iran’s Islamic Regime for sure. Look at Lebanon, Iraq, Yaman, Palestine and Iran’s Proxies and their influences. With impartiality you would see the Role of Iran’s Islamic Regime. So please help and support the Iran’s people to get rid of this criminal Islamic Regime, so in return, you will see peace and calmness in your country.",Gem Master,2019-12-30T03:12:20Z,0

"The Syrians seem like really nice people.  I&#39;ve always thought they seemed like good people.   Seeing this vlog and the Damascus one has been interesting.  People use the Syrian conflict as justification for the replacement of the Western populations.  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like the Syrians or the Somalians or anyone else for that matter.   I just want Europe to remain mostly European.   Syrians need to go home and rebuild their countries as we in Europe did and like countless others have done around the world.  It looks relatively peaceful in these cities.  What&#39;s stopping people returning to their homes and why should the west allow the Syrian conflict to be a reason to accept our own replacement?  And before anyone starts invoking Godwins law, the United Nations themselves call it replacement migration.",DrAIR,2019-09-26T13:51:00Z,0

"Thanks Eva, i really understand and appreciate your soldarity and good will.<br />As a Syrian I would like to make it clear to you.<br />The Syrian regime is working well on brightining his image, not for his citizens, but for the rest of world.<br />Did not you ask your self why the city is empty somehow comparing to a city had at least 1 million people?<br />This regime would let you go inside and film, but let someone who is not a supporter of the regime tries it!<br />Many of syrians came back to it and were killed by the regime, sometimes on the borders.<br />It is very complicated and this regime would lie for the last moment to protect his position and shows you a cute face, other than the face he shows to his people.",Khaled A,2019-09-26T11:37:22Z,0
"@Anaha Mabi I&#39;m Syrian, if you didn&#39;t notice that in my comment! Oh yes the majority support the regime from prisons. Seeking freedom and essential rights is not an ideology, I hope you understand that. And since the regime is good, why still there is refugees in the countries around Syria and didn&#39;t come back? Because as Syrians we know how criminal and sick that regime is.

@CatnipandBones Palestinians suffer from their fanaticism. Not because of Israel. And nobody in the Arab world take them seriously anymore. I see a solution where Egypt annex the Gaza Stripe and Jordan annex parts of the West Bank. There was the solution between 1948-1967. Can work now. Most of the settlers are decent people who have never harmed anyone. Not baby killers like the Tamimi family who is so adored within villages in the West Bank.,Tomer Keret,2019-10-08T09:25:37Z,0

In spite of it all, when i saw the people who live there, in this footage, they only reminded me of hope, of moving forward. It was sobering to see that they&#39;re human need to exist, to be happy, and to have hope, was still alive within them, and that right there!, gives them the strength to keep going, to smile, to look forward, to another day.

"A war between the Syrians and the ....&#39;Syrian opposition.&#39;  Very interesting way to put it.  Let me fill in the blanks for the confused, un-informed viewer: the &#39;Syrian opposition,&#39; as she puts it, was a rabble of head chopping psychopaths supported by the Muricans and Pissrahell.  Proof?  The terrorist scum, who took pleasure in beheading children from the backs of pickup trucks, ran TOWARD the Pissrahell border in Syria when they were cornered.  They also APOLOGIZED when they accidentally attacked Pissrahell forces.  Pissrahell also treated the ISIS (Israeli Intelligence Secret Service) fighters who were wounded in the fighting...AND SENT THEM BACK to FIGHT IN SYRIA.  American weapons &quot;JUST HAPPENED&quot; to find their way into terrorist Al Nusra hands, as well as brand new pickup trucks, TANKS, APC&#39;s... the works.  Not just once or twice... but continuously.  It seems the vlogger posting this cares a little more about her continued ability to vlog versus actually telling the truth about the situation.",sidfor911truth,2019-09-26T01:34:20Z,0

Aleppo is described in historical records as an important city first mentioned in the third millennium BC, when it was the capital of an independent kingdom linked to Ebla, a kingdom Bebla, the kingdom of Arman or Armi Archaeologist Giovanni Bettinato described the Kingdom of Arman as being similar to the Kingdom of Ebla in narcissism.",aaziz almmehi,2019-09-24T05:07:34Z,0

They’re literally brainwashed to think that way, and as a Syrian there’re no words to describe how thankful I’m for the amazing people like Eva who’s trying to show people the beautiful side of our country and other countries that western media will never show you!<br />We’ll rebuild our country, for the beautiful souls of our civilians martyrs and martyrs of the SAA who fought the terrorism of USA government on behalf of the whole world, we’ll rise again and y’all will be welcome to visit us to know how much you didn’t know the truth of this good and loving people and how you have wronged us with your judgments based on one-sided opinion!<br />Long live Syria♥️🇸🇾🇸🇾",Hussein RH,2019-09-23T01:19:58Z,0

This is exactly the problem between USA and the whole world, u always think that people need your help when all they ask for is leave them tf alone!!

Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, El Salvador, Iraq, Guatemala, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Libya, Pakistan, Yemen... and many other countries share exactly the same opinions about USA and they all agree that YOU guys are the cancer of this world, just keep in mind that If you invade another country, you aren’t defending your country, you’re attacking people who are DEFENDING their country from you, and actually it’s embarrassing that I’ve to explain something so obvious!!

The good Syrian people don’t have your attitude, you always have to blame the USA, Jews and Israel!

Wasn’t it that the Syrian people &quot;WANTED FREEDOM”??? It had nothing to do with the USA or the West, TELL ME??? <br /><br />Get Assad, Putin and the Iranians to rebuild your country!!!

Sure, you might be more emotional than I would be on the outside, still I think it doesn&#39;t help since the reality you accurately pictured speaks for itself while at the same time many people who are quite attentive often get annoyed if the presenter thinks he/she might not get his point through without adding a ton of pathos.<br /><br /><br />BTW - it would be nice to have some information/recomendation for potential wannabe Aleppo tourists.

"This young woman, although honest is somewhat out of her depth in terms of understanding recent history. Playing sad music doesn&#39;t get to the truth of what happened. This wasn&#39;t a conflict between the Syrian government and &quot;opposition forces&quot;. It was a conflict between the Syrian people and the fascistic forces of the  Gulf States backed by the US and other Western countries. The so called opposition forces were nothing more than psychopathic guns for hire. They did terrible things like pushing government workers off tall buildings, throwing Syrian soldiers under moving tanks and beheading Christians and Shia Muslims. If she had asked the local people who lived through the seige they would have told her how those maniacs used food as a weapon of control and that they prevented them from leaving the &quot;rebel areas&quot;. Full credit to her though for visiting the city.

"For sure you know who bombed it with thousands of barrel bombs and ballistic missiles. The opposition doesn&#39;t have an airforce, so you are filming all over the place the flags which represent the regime who killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians who revolted against it, in that city alone. If your friend cannot go back is because he would be imprisoned and executed by the Syrian regime, as it is happening to the thousands of deported who go back against their will. Aleppo is not there anymore and not because of the destroyed buildings. The people of Aleppo is Aleppo, and they are all living in refugee camps, in Assad prisons or dead. Go visit Idlib. Will your regime puppet guide allow you so? Shame on you for normalizing genocide and making profit out of it.

"Pasdar friend, all you need to do to see how many Catholic massacres there have been against Protestants is read Fox’s Book of Martyrs.   If you’re referring to the Orthodox people, their Patriarch too has bowed to the pope of Rome ever since they were massacred by the papacy by that Jesuit Stalin in his Gulag during the second thirty years war (WWII).  Hitler was a Catholic, he modeled the SS after the Jesuit Order and Germany had an actual concordat with the Vatican.  The pope controls Israel through its treacherous leaders all supported by the Zionists in the controlled USA.  The Roman hierarchy did 911 but blamed it on you Muslims branding you as terrorists to further his crusade in the Middle East and in particular against your people, the Shia, to be further massacred by his majority Sunnis.  In reality the pope hates you both.  It’s essential to understand that every war is actually a crusade in disguise, with two heretic populations, for example the US vs. Iraq or Syria and possibly Shia Iran next (unless Trump finds a way stop it in time), both pitted against each other for the ultimate benefit of tiny little Vatican City insulated by its WALLS (understand the duplicity).  Even the Dali Lama kisses the pope’s toe since his crusaders murdered so many inconvertible Buddhists during the 20th century, particularly in SEA and Japan.  The greatest Baptist and Protestant historians in the USA are in agreement that the Vatican created Islam to be used as the sword of the church, at first to destroy Bible believers in Northern Africa while assisting Roman Catholic Spain and Portugal to run the  pope’s evil Atlantic slave trade.  Evidence of this would be many similarities between the two religions which I won’t go into but will refer to Walter Veith’s lectures on the topic.  But yes, you are unfortunately very correct about today’s Protestant American churches, all federally controlled harlots of Rome, once separate but today re-united again through their membership in the pope’s World Council of Churches and his wicked ecumenical movement.  The pedogate revelations are just further proof that the RC church is the most satanic cult in the history of the world.  Don’t have to like it, just the way it is.",Rich Kid,2019-09-23T20:50:52Z,0
"Pasdar greetings just trying to help you and your people learn using a different historical perspective that’s accurate.  The pope and his Jesuits destroyed my people as well, mainly the Baptists and Protestants everywhere but specifically using the American South during the civil war.  Before this the USA was 💯 % Protestant, now it’s become so Latinized even our Supreme Court is stacked with RCs.  Far from being dead the Jesuits are more active than ever in your region, primarily controlling things from their universities aka military bases in Cairo and Alexandra.  How are you supposed to defend yourselves if you don’t know your enemy?   <a href=""https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/jesuit-historiography-online/the-jesuits-and-the-middle-east-from-the-nineteenth-century-to-the-present-day-a-historiographical-essay-COM_205617"">https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/jesuit-historiography-online/the-jesuits-and-the-middle-east-from-the-nineteenth-century-to-the-present-day-a-historiographical-essay-COM_205617</a>",Rich Kid,2019-09-23T19:35:48Z,0
"I’m no expert but it seems like Syria wanted independence from said powers?  If so Assad had to be eliminated by those powers all secretly working for the Jesuit pope to rebuild his Holy Roman Empire out of the rubble of once strong nations across the world.  Which btw my American friend is what the American civil war was about concluding w the assassination of Lincoln by John Surratt, that war not to free the slaves and strengthen the states but rather enslave us all to Romanism by subordination of the states to federal power in Rome on the Potomac via the 14th Amendment.  When you don’t understand the Jesuit influence on a historical narrative you’ve no hope of ever discovering let alone understand true history.  To this end it’s better to search google for “ <i>____</i> conflict/war, Jesuit”.  Happy researching 📚 PS, just did that and sure enough knowing the pope hates the Shia because they have an “infallible” leader (he can be the only one) he caused a gendocide of these people and used the fall out which is the Refugee crisis to further destroy white Protestant Europe and other nations the Syrian people can never integrate into.  So the conflict was/is really a continued crusade against the Shia, which is why the pope will use his USA to destroy Shia Iran and use the Sunnis and Wahabies along w the Americans to do his bidding.",Rich Kid,2019-09-23T11:02:22Z,0

Yes nothing could bring it back as it was dear 😢😢😢. Thank you for making this video! I think you are such a brave young lady to have the courage to come to my city Aleppo. The war was quite devastating. It was So cruel..no water ..no electricity no food ..Not to mention the horror of waking up every day going to school to teach not knowing whether I&#39;m going to return home safe! It was legit a nightmare!..There are still conflicts going on in some areas..I guess I&#39;m lucky because I live in the city center. Economic recession is what the people are suffering from. The syrian lira lost its power and the people had enough! I would really love to meet you if you ever consider coming back to Aleppo.. if you like to know more updates about Aleppo..just send me a message. thank you again for sharing this wonderful video.,Monica Bay,2019-09-21T17:56:14Z,73

"Huge Respect for you. I could see the sadness in ur eyes and pain in your heart throughout this VLOG. This is how a &quot;HUMAN&quot; with a good heart behaves. The media never showed us the true picture. While watching this VLOG, i was imagining the huge suffering caused to the people living there. There were young and old women, kids, infants, toddlers, men, animals living there and suddenly they were bombed. No one can completely feel their pain. Only those can, who have lost their loved ones. The God created this beautiful earth for us to live peacefully, love each other and praise God. But, in our world, Oil, Gas and Gold resources are more precious than Human Lives. The Muslim Life is the most inexpensive in the world. They are suppressed, killed, black mailed and black listed. I wish and pray to God, to bring Allepo back to life. And I also pray to God that no one is displaced from his house. We must spread love and only love.

"Thank you Eva for visiting Aleppo (Halab as it pronounced in Arabic). I have eaten Hatalia at the same exact shop you visited and walked the cobble-stone streets that you walked on.  The destruction of old Aleppo is disheartening. The loss is not just buildings and UNESCO historic sites for Westerner to come and visit. A city is infrastructure, people and history all combined. There is high human, cultural, and traditions costs to the destruction. Houses and business in Aleppo remain in the same family for hundreds of years and often mail addresses and directions are given by family shop or a family-name of the occupant of a house. Just curious,  I was wondering why you did not focus on the Citadel?; which is the trademark of Aleppo. One of the most amazing characters of Aleppo is how diverse its population is and how they coexisted for thousand years in harmony. It is a myth that this crisis was of a civil war. Thank you so much again. Your raw feelings come across as honest and truthful. It touched me. I cried.  Keep on doing the work you do, It helps the world.",Vic Daniel,2019-09-17T22:28:10Z,0

Majority of all Syrians i have met before the war began were proud BIG headed people. Very arrogant and materialistic just like the Arabs in the Middle East. The war and carnage is sad especially for the children who will never be able to have regular lives living through such autrocities. The blame goes to the Kurds that took advantage of the arrogance of these Syrians and tried to carve a part of Syria for a new country known as kurdistan like they did successfully with the help of US President Bush and his FAKE war on Iraq. Good thing Turkey has successfully stopped this from happening.,Staaay Organic,2019-09-17T14:57:53Z,0

That soap that you smell, is part of my heritage, my identity,  and all the memories that I have about Aleppo. I still have one with me keep it save after fleeing 8 years ago. By touching the old stones you were touching my soul, I felt it and cannot hold my tears. I knew it, I knew from the moment I saw the title of the video that I have to avoid.

"while you may not go into the political aspects of the conflict, ISIS had overrun Aleppo, they refused to leave, and ISIS had to be taken out. The only way to do that was to bomb the city. ISIS/Al Qaeda were defeated and they left in buses for Idlib. The people are possibly smiling because life is much better now. The reign of terror/ISIS has finished and the people can go back to their lives and try and rebuild their city. Where I live in New Zealand, which is a world away form Syria, the rebuild after the devastation caused by the earthquakes in Christchurch New Zealand, brought a certain amount of economic prosperity to the region. Perhaps the same may happen to Aleppo especially, if those countries who were responsible for supporting ISIS, Al Qaeda, the so called moderate rebels ie Syrian opposition provide financial support for the rebuild.   I would love to visit Syria it looks like such a beautiful and historic place. I would imagine the people want tourism, but I hope tourism doesn&#39;t spoil it.",Win Kiddle,2019-09-16T22:45:12Z,1

Aleppo and Damascus will never be like in the good old day at the 70s when Assad came and terrorized the people not only in 2011 in 1981 in Hama and every Syrian knew that they need to sacrifice a lot of blood to take the freedom and to destroy this dictatorship so sadly we lost this revolution and now we’re worse than before so there’s no hope for Syria to be like before as long as the western countries control the Syrian government like a puppet,"Moh, Qusay'",2019-09-16T21:43:25Z,1

"BALIAN61 <br />Dear Syrian people, do not ever forget that, if Syria is in such a devastated and miserable situation, mainly and mostly is because of the role of bloody Iran’s Islamic Regime (not people of Iran of course). You may or may not agree, but, this is the reality. And, of course I have not forgotten other countries’ interference and roles in this significant issue, but, Iran is the main cause. I am from Iran and I have been following the region’s situations and issues and problems for so many years and I have traveled to all of the countries and cities of Middle East, and I assure you, where ever the conflict and war is, you can see the foot print of Iran’s Islamic Regime for sure. Look at Lebanon, Iraq, Yaman, Palestine and Iran’s Proxies and their influences. With impartiality you would see the Role of Iran’s Islamic Regime. So please help and support the Iran’s people to get rid of this criminal Islamic Regime, so in return, you will see peace and calmness in your country.",Gem Master,2019-12-30T03:12:39Z,1

"The devastating thing is that those damages were caused from people, to other people, that&#39;s what&#39;s heart-breaking. In my country we have ghost towns because of earthquakes. Damages look exactly like those, in very old medieval town made the same way. The devastation to the buildings is exactly like that, i&#39;ve seen it. People who lived there lost everything, but one is nature, and we can&#39;t control it, but the other one, it hurts to know that people can be so cruel, whatever your religion or belief or culture is, the fact that we live in a world where we are killing our planet and our people, it&#39;s just the most sad thing ever.  We are going to die one day, we are all equal in this tiny planet lost in the infinite universe, and instead of helping each other, we just fight over borders and powers we created.

"I can imagine it&#39;s a strong feeling that&#39;s hard to describe walking through those streets. I went to the earthquake and tsunami area in Japan about one year after it had happened and seeing that with my own eyes was much different and stronger than seeing it on the TV, although that of course was strong as well. Also there the people were smiling and welcoming despite all the hardships. This conflict is on another level, of course, but I still recognize a little bit from how it was walking around there, how it felt.<br />I hope I can come to Syria myself one day.<br />Also love that you show both sides, because the news will only show the destruction, and not the parts in which life goes on.<br /><br />All my prayers with the people of Aleppo and Syria in general, for peace and recovery.<br />Greetings from Sweden.",Jonathan E,2019-09-15T13:56:10Z,2

Muslim countries, simply put, aren’t places for a single woman to travel too. Their religion preaches that Women are nothing more than chattel. It’s high time Western women learn that they’re lucky to have White men preaching some semblance of equality, because they truly have no idea what real oppression is.",sugreev2001,2019-09-15T12:06:08Z,0

"The reason that this has been possible is because thge western narritive is a lie. Talking to people on the ground will show so many contridions from the vast majority of aleppo returning to themm having no fear of there government hence them not being fearful and choosing to return. Many of there returning people will be part of the Syrian Arab Army and every coyntry according to international law has the right to defend it&#39;s self against what in reality are wahabi styled sharia extremist who need to be killed in order to protect the genenral public and make the country safe to return to. They starved the people they looted aleppos factories sending them to extreamist supporting Turkey, but them have remade these themselves and got the businesses restarted. Assad is even allowing free education for those who missed out cause of the war. He is a hero and Aleppo speaks for and all the other liberated areas clearly speak for themself fighting back.",AlexTheUmbreon5,2019-09-15T09:15:24Z,0

"Hi.... Thank you so much for this, l really enjoyed this little piece you constructed on your Syrian travels... <br />I have a great interest in what&#39;s going on in this world &amp; l don&#39;t think any human could not be so deeply touched by what has been going on in Syria &amp; other countrys that have been ripped apart by war &amp; fighting... Though l guess as a parent single parent and small business owner l just remain tied to my little circle of life in Australia... l do try to follow world news in this area of world though good, recent &amp; heart warming news rarely filters through on the news channel or by any means... Your experience and report was brilliant and presented from a soul with a deeply caring heart... l find the most touching aspect of your journey is the beautiful people of Syria are just like you &amp; l.... Just good people wishing to live a normal life filled with what we so much in life we take for granted.... The adversity that has taken place is a complete injustice..... l truly pray for these people that they may rebuild, reconstruct, recover, heal and forever now live happy &amp; peaceful life&#39;s... ⚘",road2racect,2019-09-14T21:06:40Z,0
