Ha.. i knew you are German 😊 I find you work amazing ..  I couldn’t do this video camera stuff.. putting a cam in everyone’s face upon arrival/goodbye ect. Comes across more like a job than actually going though the experience just by soaking it all up. I think especially welcomes and goodbyes are sacred moments and for me a camera would just make this too awkward. Still I enjoy your encounters and following you around the globe😄 the song was a bit odd though and I like your personality how you seem resistant to make moments like that not awkward,Johnny Rabadur,2021-03-26T01:15:31Z,0

"Eva, as nice and interesting as your travel vlogs are, most people watching will never be able to experience it the way you do. Although I hate to say it, you are priviliged. Therefore, your vlogs, in a way, create envy in most, not inspiration to to do the same, as as most cannot, unless they too are of the privileged. Again, I do hate to say this, but your vlogs seem to put you more  at the centre. Strong personality.",verjon and,2021-03-24T00:17:52Z,1

"Things like this put me as an Englishman to shame,, wherever people travel to. far and wide, around the globe, to the most sophisticated societies to the poorest and least advanced places, there is someone who is multi lingual, and 99 times out of a hundred can speak English..  This is a throw back to our complacency centuries, where we thought every one else in the world, was ignorant and should speak our language. So much so that in my schooldays, ( I was born 1950), there was no option or lesson on languages in any of our schools.. I would have loved to learned another tongue or two,, Especially French German, Spanish. but alas I am not self determined enough to &quot;go it alone&quot;, especially now, as everyone seems to want to speak English. Therefore on holidays or meeting people of different countries and cultures, I feel the odd one out, as at least the very &quot;uninitiated&quot; will try their English on us,  but I am too embarrassed and ignorant to try their language! And as far as I am concerned the English are ignorant and complacent as far as that goes as it appears I am not the only one!",chris bond,2021-02-20T18:52:24Z,0

"The world belongs to the brave.. and the humble! Eva, I did my globe trotting back in the mid to late 90&#39;s when the world was a very different place. The internet was just becoming established and I remember my wild and fabulous Canadian friend opening my first hotmail account in a cyber cafe in Tokyo! Back then I traveled solo for the most part, unless I was fortunate enough to meet a fellow traveler -then journey together for a few days or weeks. I met so many wonderful, kind and generous people along the way, who invited me into their homes, bought me food at train station stops, all of whom had some golden nugget of wisdom and stories to share. Back then we would try to keep track of each other after these fateful meetings with random postcards and first attempts at email! Like your self I wasn&#39;t stupid about accepting every invitation - I trusted my gut and intuition, as their were no search engines yet to track or verify people. Many people thought I was brave and nuts to travel solo for so long and yet once in the flow it came natural to me; to trust in others and wake up in different spots every day, week or month. I had the most incredible 3 years on the road journeying all over the S. Pacific rim, and it would not have been so amazing and profound if I hadn&#39;t met the exceptional people and made friends along the way. Happy trails, and I know you will stay safe ;-)",Betsy Peerless,2020-11-09T08:18:10Z,2

This is wonderful and heartwarming and went perfect with my coffee and beer and pizza. It brings me joy to see you and other travelers showing the beauty in this world instead of my getting sucked into the negativity of the news and people debating online as is their words were bombs and bullets. I was feeling depressed but this and a couple others videos brought me back into the light. Thank you! 🖖❤️🍻😊,Joseph Barney,2020-11-09T06:41:22Z,0

This world is still filled with so many beautiful people .  Its destiny and fortune of a completely different level to cross paths with such beings.
