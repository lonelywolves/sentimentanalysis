Just stumbled across your channel this morning. I was in Boibar and Avgarch in 2007. I traveled extensively in the northern areas working with remote shepherds high up in the mountains for a few months. I was amazed to see the same Pervais who lead me around the countryside. I was with some other villagers from Morkhun who took me to Bibi Nigor&#39;s house where she served us choi. She hasn&#39;t changed a bit in 14 years! Also enjoyed your video about skiing in Afghanistan where I lived for a couple years. Great channel. Gives me itchy feet to travel again.,Jesse Wright,2021-04-17T19:49:54Z,0

"The Hunde Valley is called the area where the Albanians of ancient Macedonia, the former warriors of Alexander the Great, would settle and live to this day. (As has often happened, in such circumstances, various scholars ì confuse these inhabitants with the Greeks, who have no connection with the Kalash tribe, nor can they have any connection with the present-day Slavo-Bulgarian Macedonians, because Alexander the Great had lived and died for over a thousand years, before any Slavic race appeared in the Balkans.The inhabitants of the area themselves claim to be the direct descendants of the warriors of the ILIRIK peninsula, at the same time denying the Greek claims that they are Greeks distant, yet the Greek government has sponsored various projects in the region, alluding, as a condition of the aid it provides, that they are Greeks, regardless of what the locals themselves claim to be. [6] Ze, Zeu = Albanian here resounding, echoing, (Zeus) the god of lightning, of thunder, of thunder, of ignition and firing than of lightning. [7] Bubullima Rock, = A high rock in the region, known as a rough place where Bubullima is unloaded and falls, whose name comes from the Albanian word of the inhabitants of the area, bubullimë, bubullima. . &quot;Burrash&quot; is another Illyrian-Albanian tribe that lives in an area on both sides of the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. [9] [10] Pam (j) e-Mira. = albanian - beautiful view. &quot;Pamira&quot; is called today the area of ​​the Illyrian-Albanians of Pakistan, inhabitants who believe to this day to be descendants of the army of Alexander the Great, and like all other Illyrians of Asia are considered handsome and beautiful people, known as tribe ì &quot;Pamireve&quot;, of good-looking, handsome people.",Agim Retkoceri,2020-12-22T12:42:40Z,0
"There are three types of people living in the Hunza Valley. The Brusho speakers, Shina speakers and Wakhi( Pamiri) speaker. The Wakhiz migrated here in Hunza from Badakshan present day Tajikistan.

"Some really interesting fact: HUNZA it is believed to derive from Albanian word Hunda which means Nose, as the shape of the mountain where Hunza people have migrated. Hunza people are believed to have migrated there as part of the army of the Great Alexander who wanted to conquer all of those territories but died from Malaria. So some of his people stayed there, never to return back to their territory in Balkan, Europe. They are mostly gingers(redhead) and their traditions are quiet similar to the Albanian ones.",B-Mix Channel,2020-07-24T23:43:17Z,0

It is a country where people are friendly and they don&#39;t really bother you but makes you feel welcome.<br />interesting that Karachi was considered the “Paris of Asia” in the 1960s because I lived there from 1963 through 1966. I was an American 14-year-old upon arrival and got out of there just a year or so from high school graduation. These Pakistan videos continue to amaze me.  The people are amazing and yes, what incredible hospitality.

"It would be nice if you could make a video on how to travel to these beautiful places, what kind of transportation to get there, how long will it take to travel there from the main cities, how many weeks or days that we should travel in Pakistan based on your experience and what are the precautions to be taken :) Also pls show the downside of Pakistan cause i think it is important for travellers who wants to travel there as i feel that some of us could be quite ignorant on certain things that we shouldn&#39;t be doing in the country. Thank you. :)",Daing Irfan,2019-05-09T02:06:25Z,0

"The gilgit area and these parts of the mountains is heaven. All the other travel videos of Pakistan I have seen that goes through the other area&#39;s look good too in some area&#39;s or really mediocre in other areas. And we can almost all safely agree that this himalayan area of Pakistan is the most beautiful part in the country. And yes this is ä &quot;heaven&quot; to me. But there are many countries that are heavenly. Heaven is not in one place. Heaven is found in many forms, in many mountain areas, in many island areas, in many sea areas. Some countries have all of this combined in one. To me I call that heaven. But I will one day visit this area of Pakistan. I have seen enough videos to know that it&#39;s beautiful!",Ptolemy336VV,2021-04-11T00:05:28Z,0
