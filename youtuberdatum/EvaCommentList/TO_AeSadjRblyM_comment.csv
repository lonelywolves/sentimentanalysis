The reason Pakistan can’t be the next tourist destination is because they are world’s no 1 terrorism sponsoring country  you will find al Qaeda’s and Taliban’s training camps there too.

"I think countries like Pakistan may be favoring the preservation of culture over commercialism. It is quite a conservative culture in contrast to Arab countries like Jordan, Lebanon or Morocco....not every country is in it for the buck.

"Yes it can become a great tourist destination if authorities become more open minded and intelligent. On the one hand there are bloggers promoting travel to Pakistan, I dreamed to visit the country after seeing these videos. A lot of effort was put to make the trip happen. Finally a big part of it was ruined by police and agency harassment, Pakistan is safe but in a lot of areas police won&#39;t let you go alone (illogical?), and the worst part was extending visa which is total mess and corrupt (was required 100$ for approval after paying online fee). On the one hand tour agents promote tourism to do business, on the other hand authorities create huge obstacles. Two fires and you are stuck between them. Fair to mention rude behaviour of some government officers which is total nonsense in relation to tourists who they want to attract to their country.<br />Please mention such moments in your stories so people don&#39;t get trapped trying to discover Pakistan. Personally I would like to go back to see more of balochistan and north, but will do this trip only when I read that normal traveller had good time with authorities there.",Anna Nevmerzhytska,2021-04-01T07:22:27Z,0

The most famous of these was Shah Jahan Aurangzeb who used Srinagar as his summer capital. The Mughals had planted many gardens which added an organized layer to the independent beauty of Kashmir had added.

I could only visit Swat as I had short period to travel but there are so much potential for tourism. Beautiful nature, culture, traditional art and food. I was born and raised in Japan and didn’t know much about Pakistan until the visit but kindness of people made me felt so comfortable which is similar feeling that I feel in Japan - feeling safe and cared by people around you.

"I , as an Indian can definitely say that India is  the best place for tourism and these are my arguements:<br />You want mountains? We have access to the great himalyan range which spreads across the coutry. You want green / snow peaked / rock / high altitude or any other type of mountain, name it we have it.<br />You want to enjoy forest&amp; wildlife, we have plenty of it be it tropical forest&#39;s, tiger reserve&#39;s and national parks like sundarban.<br />You want beaches, the eastern ghat &amp; the western ghat have more than you can ever visit. Not to forget  spectacular andaman&#39;s &amp; lakhsadweep.<br />You want history? We definitely have alot more monuments than any other country in the world, including Taj Mahal which is one of the wonders of world. Our entire nation is just full of it.<br />You want food? UNESCO has called Hyderabad culinary capital of the world, and there are alot of other cities which give strong competition to hyderabad.<br />You want desert? Welcome to Rajisthan.<br />You want culture? Here in India the culture and the language changes  more frequently than the landscape.<br />You want to see garden&#39;s like apple/ tea / coffee or stuff&#39;s like step farming, WEED farming or anything else, Just name it and we have it.<br />No hate for pakistan, Just wanted to make my point.",mz tech,2021-01-13T16:44:05Z,0

ہمیں چاہیئے کہ اپنے آپ کو بدلے۔ دیکھو غیر ملکی نے ہمارے ملک کی تعریف کی۔ اس میں کیا تھا۔ یہ اللہ تعالی نے ہم کو کافر کے منہ سے سمجھایا کہ میں نے تم سب کو کتنا خوبصورت ملک دیا ہیں اور تم لوگ اس کو بگاڑنا چاہتے ہو۔ حکومت کو چوڑو اپنے آپکو  ٹھیک کرنا سیکھو۔ ان شاء اللہ جب ہم ٹھیک ہو جائے تو ہم پر آچھا حکمران اللہ تعالی عطاء کرےگا ۔ اللہ تعالی سے اپنے کیے ہوئے گناہوں کا توبہ کرو اور آئیندہ کیلئے غلطیوں اور گناہوں سے بچو۔ یہ عورتوں کی پردگی اور مردوں کا گورنا یہ گناہ ہے۔ پانچ وقت نمازی بنو اور استغفار کرو۔ اللہ تعالی ہم سب مسلمانوں پر رحم فرما دے۔ آمین ثم آمین۔ یا رب العالمین۔,Made in Pakistan,2020-12-27T19:27:37Z,0

"Pakistan once used to be part of India, so it definitely is a wonderful scenic destination, but then the question arises how safe it is, there is literally 0 tolerance in the people of Pakistan. If in case you uttered something wrong unintentionally by mistake, you may be publicaly persecuted. Moreover there is no type of justice given to you if you are non-muslim as a tourist and the culprit is a muslim. To get justice , even to lodge a complaint you must belong to any islamic religion either arab, or any other muslim. If you are non-muslim, forget about any type of justice or any help. Pakistan once used to be a beautiful country with ancient archaeological artifacts and building and sculptures that are all destroyed and vanished in name of religion. Now what remains in pakistan is scenic beauties in mountains , and no one would prefer visiting such radical and extreme country to just enjoy the beauty of nature, that might also be destroyed in name of religion. Although Pakistan&#39;s current government is doing some efforts to enhance tourism in their country by inviting and paying some famous you-tubers and travel vloggers to their country and to say good things, but that can&#39;t work until a country which is home to more than 140 UN designated terrorists works on making the mentality of local population progressive.<br />In short , Pakistan can be a beautiful country if it is separated from extreme and radical ideology and if they focus more on the safety of non-muslim tourists as well, as currently a non-muslim is not more than an animal in Pakistan for the people of Pakistan.",saksham thukral,2020-11-16T12:14:19Z,1

"Hmmm I hope they strike a balance. I went in the early 80s and the lack of tourism helped it be a pristine, untouched, natural beauty and you had it to yourself...When tourists descend it&#39;ll become clogged up like the French Rivera. I don&#39;t know, when you see the back-pack trail, a lot of countries like Thailand want to get away from that...They want to aim for limited visitors with more spending power.

It could but the only thing that stopping is pakistan itself. Pakistani people have to leave the only muslim brotherhood feeling. While talking they express hamare musalman bhai feeling many time. By observing  there body language you can find out that they always have a soft corner for muslim extrenism. They actually have to be very much liberal for other religious beleifs And other cultures. One side u want to be a number 1 tourist hotspot other side u wanna make riyasat of madina and it&#39;s leader  both can&#39;t be done simultaneously.

Pakistan can never be a welcoming country mostly because of it&#39;s governance and it&#39;s laws. The way their ideology is... And the Balochistan you were talking about is striving for freedom from Pakistan. The biggest reason for Pakistan never becoming a tourist hub because of the terrorist organisations it runs because presence of such terrorists in the country I personally won&#39;t prefer to visit such country!! Pakistan can&#39;t invest in infrastructure as the country is under very heavy loan of China and UAE so no where soon it&#39;s gonna happen. Pakistan never stood for peace and unity which could make it&#39;s impression good on the World so as most of the population I too don&#39;t wanna visit that country!,Abhishu Singh,2020-08-19T17:10:25Z,0

"Pakistan has a lot of scope in the tourism sector. I don&#39;t want to bring any political debate here. But, what I feel, Pakistan is dealing more with terrorism and military. I am talking from my observation. However, it is not the only country. Even India is also dealing with these two a lot. <br />It can definitely become a tourism hotspot if it focus more on the tourism part... And govt. needs to act on it actively...<br />Both India and Pakistan have suffered a lot bcz of the animosity and war in the past and present. I am not gonna analyze who started the war or who is more responsible. That&#39;s a diff topic.<br />I am keeping my view as I want everyone to prosper.<br />Love from India🇳🇪. Hopefully the animosity will be over someday and we will be be able to travel to this beautiful country without any fear or hesitation. <br />Anyway, I would love to visit it in future...

It can&#39;t because they won&#39;t do anything else until they get the rest of Kashmir from India. U may think another Indian crying about my comment. But I have seen Pakistan in videos only and I wish it becomes everything u talk about in the video. The only thing holding back Pakistan is Pakistan fixation with Kashmir and showing they are better than India. If they stop doing that and bring in a cultural change in the way their establishments of govt work. They can be much more that what the video talks about.,Chintan Kalkura,2020-08-05T17:56:43Z,1

I am no denying that Pakisthan is not beautiful.<br />But If you compare it to India then India is a far more beautiful and rich culture than any country. It has the Himalayan Region, over 2000 KM, lots of beaches, big cities, Lots of temples, masjids, palace, the birthplace of five different religions ad many more things.<br />Next time please visit Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, North East States, and Most Southern States. You will change your mind definitely.<br />India is a vivid rich cultural destination in the world.<br /><br />Anyways, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are brothers to each other.

"All of what she said is true about the attractions of Pakistan.  Personally I&#39;d love to visit because I&#39;m a history buff and find interest in ancient culture and civilization and also in the varying religions and their histories.   But the sad truth is Pakistan is a dangerous corner of the world no matter how you slice it.  People who live in Pakistan flee into other nations and mostly Europe looking for opportunity because Pakistan usually becomes one of two things, a military dictatorship or its in danger from fundamentalists.  Their recent history of housing real bad actors is for real and if you travel their you do so at your own risk.",Aaron Wilcox,2020-07-21T15:55:21Z,0

Is to love and be loved.<br />Give respect and fill your heart with it...<br />Let&#39;s just forget each and everything we did against each other.

"Why Pakistanis are the most hospitable nation on earth...?  <br />Source : <a href=""http://www.no1tourism.com/"">www.No1Tourism.com</a><br /><br />A woman came to The Prophet ?? and complained to him about her husband that he invites too many guests and she has become weary from preparing food for them and hosting them. The Prophet ?? did not answer and the woman left.<br /><br />Sometime later The Prophet ?? called the woman&#39;s husband and said, &quot;I am your guest today.&quot;<br /><br />The man was so happy he went home and told his wife &quot;The Prophet of Allah ?? is our guest today.&quot; <br /><br />His wife was ecstatic and spent time and effort and used every bit of food to prepare for the arrival of the Most Honored Guest, The Prophet ??.<br /><br />After the amazing joy of hosting The Prophet ?? generously, The Prophet ?? told the man, &quot;Tell your wife to watch the door from which I leave your home.&quot;<br /><br />So the wife watched the door from which The Prophet ?? left her home and saw all kinds of creatures, scorpions and other harmful creatures leaving the house behind The Prophet ??, upon which she fainted due to the immense manifestation and greatness of what she had witnessed.<br /><br />When she came to The Prophet ??, he said to her, &quot;This is what happens when the guest leaves your home, with him all kinds of harm, trials and tribulations and harmful creatures depart from your home, and that is the wisdom behind being generous to one&#39;s guest and becoming weary doing so.&quot;<br /><br />The house in which the guests are frequent and many is a house which Allah ? loves. There is nothing better than the &#39;open house&#39; for the young and the old. In such a house descends Allah&#39;s ? Mercy and Blessings from heaven.<br /><br />The Prophet ?? said, &quot;If Allah wants good for a people, He sends them a gift.&quot; They asked &quot;What kind of gift, oh Prophet of Allah?&quot; He said, &quot;The guest comes with his own provision, and leaves with the sins of the people of the house.&quot;",STAR Ayaan,2020-06-03T16:52:53Z,1

"I have been staying in pak since 8 yrs as a Nepali and I must admit , pak is . Most mis understood Nation. I had the best life with so much genuine love from totally family like brothers, sisters.  I have lived in India too. But I must admit I have the best, very clean, friendly life here in Pakistan. Pakistani are mis understood for their overwhelming kindness and loving, hospitable. Media has always negative chunk out of Pakistan to quench their diet on but in reality, pak is way way far more of a very standard and hospitable and loving country with kind Pakistani ppl. Just one word goes for Pakistani ppl &quot;friendly and truly caring&quot; This definition is misinterpreted on the outside World thankfully from this video its evident and would soon be in real sense to whole world as Pakistan has been open to whole World. Easiest country to travel to and get visa on arrival. One day pak wud compete Europe I second you the beauty it owns is beyond any level it&#39;s just not realized.  Thee perception has not yet reached on larger scale. Imran Khan is a true human leader of world not only Pakistan. Having idolized to him I m blessed to have shaken hands with my idol. 🤝<br /><br /> I as a Nepali live in Pakistan I want to tell all the Pakistani ppl ur love and hospitality is ur most powerful owning In World from being universally most loved nation in the world. That is Pakistan that is no like other country. Pakistans  soul and its diversity is far more beyond then what is even shown here. Its gigantic in every form just no entertainment media to show other thn stupid  war and bad politics..Pakistan is way much more then what you think it is its totally opp to what the media gain by just defaming it. In real sense i see Pakistan&#39; a heaven with loving ppl in its country which is priceless.",The Truth Explorer,2020-05-13T15:45:11Z,0

I&#39;m from Bangladesh🇧🇩. My 2nd love is Turkey🇹🇷 and 3rd love is Pakistan🇵🇰. I believe 70% of Bangladeshi will support me. I don&#39;t know why I always feel a strong attraction from the core of my heart to these countries. Most of the Bangladeshi believe that Pakistanis are our blood brothers. We always treat them as like as our family. Maybe Pakistani brothers don&#39;t know that we the Bangladeshi muslims really love Pakistan. I&#39;ve already visited Turkey. After corona my next destination will be in &quot;My Pakistan&quot; Insha&#39;Allah.🥰❤️,Nazmul Islam,2020-05-02T09:16:06Z,261

"I&#39;m sorry to say this but I disagree on that part where you said that it would be nice/smthing to see resorts and private islands there, i&#39;m telling you as a traveller too... ITS NOT NICE AT ALL. arent we after those natural beauty of pakistan? And pakistan has a very historic/old ambiance, it was like bringing you back 2000 years ago. Away from noises, polution, tall buildings etc JUST PURE NATURE. Alhamdullilah for the beauty of Pakistan but I hope that they will keep it as is but sure to welcome more tourist those responsible ones. If they would go camping they better be careful because small fire could trigger bushfire. I really dont like that idea to see hiking, trecking or camping on Hingol National Park. Just enjoy the view. Humans have destroyed a lot, let the next next and more generation to see this kind of view. I really like how you promote Pakistan, you encourage tourist but I would also love it if you would also promote it at the same time thinking of conserving everything. This is not meant to be as a rude comment just wanted to share my own vision too, well obviously its almost the same but I really like Pakistan as it being caring to their nature and keeping it. I hope I was able to deliver what am I trying to say.",JM Kirisaki,2020-03-16T15:44:48Z,0

"Thank you Eva for highlighting tourism potential of Pakistan. But I believe  Pakistan needs to 1) open up ( liquor bars, dance clubs, massage centers,etc. for tourists)  2) Build some infrastructure including good hotels, rest houses, airports, roads, toilets etc in areas where tourist destinations are located. 3) Get rid of religious extremism &amp; security issues and ban religious as well as political rallies on roads. It also must  ban plastic bags to keep the environment clean and green.  4) Relax visa policy and advertise/ promote its tourism industry worldwide. 5) Train the staff dealing with tourism management and privatise certain related services.",Adnan Faraz,2020-02-05T00:23:50Z,0

"You should start a travel agency or touring company in Pakistan even part time through the year it would be good to get people there to visit, hire locals, etc. Although keep in mind that mass tourism can help a country and it can also hurt a country as well.

I&#39;ve traveled widely in six continents but admit I saw Pakistan as a place not safe for westerners. But this video makes me interested. The Scenery and archeology is impressive. We&#39;ve been to numerous countries around the world that most Westerners avoid including five Islamic countries and we have been risk takers. A young Pakistani man who is a facebook friend has encouraged me along these lines. We shall see what the future holds.,Hanno the Phoenician,2020-01-13T02:28:34Z,0

"Watching my country with out touching the land of  mycountry but yes I can feel the pain and love which my country have.... do you know why because I&#39;m from Indian occupied Kashmir... I&#39;m in jail, this thing doesn&#39;t matter,but my country people are free and are happy that matters. I&#39;m not upset why I&#39;m oppressed and why I&#39;m under lock down, because it doesn&#39;t matter,I see people of country are free and are using all those daily needs that thing matters for me.. sometimes i think am I also the citizen of this country then why in these 70 years my country and people don&#39;t try to find me.. I&#39;m not far away from my country,it needs just some time to see me then I think my people are making plan to find me but from 70 years I&#39;m waiting but till date no one comes and I will wait till they will not come but I have a question in my mind when they will come may be it will be too late for my country to come because at that time I will be no more (kashmiris).. I&#39;m now 70 and this question arises everyday in my mind and I think then why people of my country don&#39;t take any concrete step for me(kashmir) then I again realises there are many other issues for my country which are important than kashmiri issue and I also thick  thatmy country people are busy in their duty which I believe they are doing honestly weather it&#39;s a govt employees or a student of my country, weather its a son of this ummah and daughter of this ummah,I believe they&#39;re are working day and not not only for me but for whole umaah.. with this I want my country and my country people will prosper in the world and will be one of the development and happinest country in the world..no Matter where I&#39;m..it doesn&#39;t matters,but it matters where is my country and where is my country people in terms of good human beings and as a honest,brave and good muslims.. I&#39;m kashmir..and yes this is my pakistan..",Hussain Shah,2020-01-12T17:42:51Z,14

If goverment not change their policy your dream just remain as a dream. One more thing I think Pakistan should not need too open for tourisme, because it will change this beautiful country landscape and lifestyle and would bring a bad influnce for the youth like what happened to my country. Just let it be remain virgin and untouch .",Perindu Syurga,2019-11-19T03:30:38Z,0

Another MAJOR tourist destination right? Well 3 of the US&#39;s cities included in the top 50 most dangerous cities in the world. <br /><br />Not a SINGLE Pakistani city was included in this list. Pakistan&#39;s most dangerous city in terms of homicide is Karachi. Karachi&#39;s murder rate is SIGNIFICANTLY lower than most big American cities like NYC, Chicago, Detroit, etc.<br /><br /><br />Next up, gun violence. Pakistan has less gun deaths per capita then the US according to the latest statistics. <br /><br />You are more likely to get caught in a mass shooting in the US than being involved in a terror attack in Pakistan. So I suppose that the US is more dangerous than Pak? Btw mass shootings do NOT include gang related shootings (if gang related shootings where included in these stats then the US would be even worse in this regard when compared to Pak).<br /><br />Just some food for thought.",Four Horsemen Mechanix,2019-10-17T05:23:15Z,1

That&#39;s a small minority of the population though. That&#39;s like judging the US by looking at neo-Nazis and gang violence. <br /><br />The real reason that Pakistan doesn&#39;t get HALF as much tourism as country&#39;s like Mexico (places which are far more dangerous)  is because of the negative stereotypes that people have and the lack of proper attention regarding this problem by the previous govenrments (thankfully the new government is trying to fix the situation). Our shitty media doesn&#39;t help either. The way it   portrays Pak is really negative and portrays an image that is EXTREMELY exaggerated.

@D G if you know a glass of water contains poison would you drink? Answer should be no. Because it causes death. So now think if you know insulting prophet Mohammad (pbuh) can bring your death why should you? Now you may say this is my freedom of speech. But freedom of speech should not be something to hurt a lot of people. When you insult our prophet or the creator we feel so bad. Because we love them a lot. It&#39;s like bleeding in our heart. You shouldn&#39;t insult our religion our prophet because you know very little about Islam and prophet Mohammad (pbuh) and whatever you know is wrong because of your western media and politics. To know about Islam you shouldn&#39;t depends on media or any person even don&#39;t believe a Muslim leader just read Islam&#39;s religious books well.

"I know you mean well about imagining snow ski resorts in the mountains and luxury resorts on the beaches, but I shook my head no! I hope that such pristine beauty would be preserved from building and structures for mass tourism. I know that Pakistan would benefit from increased tourism though.  Perhaps if the country limited tourism to only eco friendly resorts that only allowed small intimate green resorts that would not make a negative impact on the wild nature of such a beautiful country? Maybe designating large National Parks that allow permitted backpacking camping trips, bungalows near the ocean made of local renewable resources. This gem of Pakistan needs to be treasured and protected.",Sunshine Day,2019-10-12T16:47:08Z,23

Tourism develops over time in a  peaceful and friendly environment. Pakistan lacks peace mainly due to Islamic extremism that keeps foreigners(including cricket teams of other nations) away from Pakistan. Religious extremism needs to be eradicated for tourism to grow.,Raheel Asghar,2019-09-27T01:35:30Z,1
"Pakistan is a beautiful country and blessed with great natural avenues. Its people are beautiful and kind-hearted. The only thing stopping the country from developing is its LEADERSHIP.  And its the same with India to some extent, although I believe India is 25 years ahead of Pakistan right now in terms of modernization. <br /><br /><br />I don&#39;t want to shame my Pakistani brotherhood. It isn&#39;t my intent. I just want them to acknowledge the fact that the leadership has focused more on harboring terrorists like Osama bin Laden &amp; Hafeez Sayeed than on its education and promoting tourism in the country. People don&#39;t visit Pakistan out of fear of terrorism. It&#39;s a fact. <br /><br /><br />Brave tourists like you actually do visit them and find that the land and its people are beautiful. Pakistan should try to improve its image better by discarding the extremism and terrorism from the country. Initiate educational revolutions, advertize its tourism lot more.",Prashant Singh,2019-09-26T23:36:53Z,0

"I have been staying in pak since 8 yrs as a Nepali and I must admit , pak is . Most mis understood Nation. I had the best life with so much genuine love from totally family like brothers, sisters.  I have lived in India too. But I must admit I have the best, very clean, friendly life here in Pakistan. Pakistani are mis understood for their overwhelming kindness and loving, hospitable. Media has always negative chunk out of Pakistan to quench their diet on but in reality, pak is way way far more of a very standard and hospitable and loving country with kind Pakistani ppl. Just one word goes for Pakistani ppl &quot;friendly and truly caring&quot; This definition is misinterpreted on the outside World thankfully from this video its evident and would soon be in real sense to whole world as Pakistan has been open to whole World. Easiest country to travel to and get visa on arrival. One day pak wud compete Europe I second you the beauty it owns is beyond any level it&#39;s just not realized.  Thee perception has not yet reached on larger scale. Imran Khan is a true human leader of world not only Pakistan. Having idolized to him I m blessed to have shaken hands with my idol. 🤝<br /><br /> I as a Nepali live in Pakistan I want to tell all the Pakistani ppl ur love and hospitality is ur most powerful owning In World from being universally most loved nation in the world. That is Pakistan that is no like other country. Pakistans  soul and its diversity is far more beyond then what is even shown here. Its gigantic in every form just no entertainment media to show other thn stupid  war and bad politics..Pakistan is way much more then what you think it is its totally opp to what the media gain by just defaming it.

The government also does not do any renovations or maintain those sites, just look at the muzaffarabad fort and how the Pakistanis ruined it...",MBA,2019-09-06T17:58:56Z,1

Why can&#39;t Pakistan become the next tourist hotspot? Well the answer is simple- Terrorism.. Instead of promoting their own tourist places and natural beauty they are supporting terrorism and attacking Indian  jawans at pulwama or attacking a bus full of sri Lankan cricketers ( who were their guests).. This is affecting Pakistan only cuz the country is becoming a &quot;not so safe&quot; Country in the eyes of tourists who wants peace as their no. 1 criteria for travelling.. <br />Instead of working against each other why can&#39;t India and Pakistan work together to create a better tommorow for the citizens of both the countries.. And drive away all sorts of tensions between them..I hope Pakistan realises this and works on it.. Love from your neigbours India 🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳,Tirtha Roy,2019-09-04T07:39:05Z,0

"I have met Pakistani people outside pakistan and they are very good people. India origins with sindh, now in Pakistan! But mentality of the people in Pakistan has deteriorated and thats because of the government of Pakistan! In a scared environment even the bacteria doesnt grow! So be it Pakistan! Your vision as I see seems impossible and can never happen, because it was never Pakistan It was once Hindustan! And jinnah and gandhi seperated it! As for as Nepal and Bhutan and the Himalayas! Then you should know that the whole Himalayan range covers the entire India and Pakistan, once both were one! So If terrorism somehow gets vanished from Pakistan, I am sure that one day, maximum tourists will be from India! If you relations are like u.s and canada, then both countries have flourished! Unlike u.s and mexico! U.s ko koi phark nahi padega agar mexico mein kuch bua. But mexico ko zaroor padega! Moreover Pakistan does not have religious tolerance! Therefore shutting the door for Tourism!",Food Bumbble,2019-08-30T18:05:37Z,0

"Why Can&#39;t ? I Tell You Why Not<br /><br />1. It&#39;s Because Of The Partition Of 1947, The Actual Birth Of Terrorism Around Pakistan.<br /><br />2. The Cultural Heritages That Are Now Under The Name Of Pakistan, Were The Part Of Greater India Or India. But Because Of A Psychotic Person( Mohd. Ali Jinnah) Who Believed In Two-Nation Theory, Bisected The Whole Land. People Of Sindh, Baloch,  Punjab, Who Never Wanted Pakistan, Who Never Voted For Muslim League, Got Stuck With Pakistan.<br /><br />3. Let&#39;s Consider The Sites As An Individual, Then They Can Be World&#39;s No.1 Tourist Spots, But Not Untill They Are Under The Name Of Pakistan. Balochistan Was An Independent State on 11th August, 1947, Long Before India And Pakistan&#39;s Indepence, But After The Formation Of Pakistan, The Pakistani Army Captured Balochistan. They Never Even Left The POK Under The Treaty Of UN In 1947.<br /><br />4. I&#39;m Not Talking About Civilians Of Pakistan, They&#39;re All Brothers, Sisters, Mothers, Fathers, Uncles, Aunts, Grandpas And Grandmas. They Never Wanted Partition. It&#39;s Because Of Some Muslim Of UP, MP, Bihar, South India, Bengal Who Voted For Muslim League, Yet Stayed In India.<br /><br />Now You Decide Who Suffered Because Of The Dirty Politics Of <b>Mohd. Ali Jinnah</b> &amp; Self-Claimed Pandit <b>Jawaharlal Nehru</b> &amp; Why Can&#39;t That Land Become The No 1. Tourist Spot.",Rohan Saha,2019-08-05T08:02:27Z,1

"Taking the viewpoint of the places of great natural beauty, their survival might depend on the fact there aren’t hoards of tourists (consumers of nature) descending on them. Tourists, as consumers, need hotels, shopping malls, big roads, etc. I am not sure these beautiful places would survive all this ‘development’. Their beauty lies in their wildness, &amp; there are very few places left on Earth that are allowed to be wild &amp; have not been colonised by the consumer economy.

"I believePakistan has most beautiful, live,and inspiring landscapes.that was created by God. I wish for it stay like it is untouched is .for it is beautiful on its own .instead of changing it polluting it with tourism. For the wrong reason.I believe that there should be tourism in Pakistan because of the People First I would like to say that their hospitality, kindness and love towards visitors are unmatched around the world..they make you comfortable and make you seem like part of the family their food cultures and religion are something worth sharing with them and learning from them. The people in Pakistan like to share there seeds of Love to their guests. I would love to go on vacation in Pakistan because  of the people to me are an example to the world.

Masha&#39;Allah very beautiful places. May Allah forgive you for what you did in 1971 to Bangladesh. I hope the people of Bangladesh will also forgive you and Allah (SWT) take away your curses which is upon you since 71. Insha&#39;Allah you will prosper again. Being muslim  we should act according to our scripture and respect one another.  May Allah grant us and increase our imaan in this Ramadan. This 10 days of Nazhat insha&#39;Allah we all will seek forgiveness for our sins and insha&#39;Allah may the Almighty overwhite all our previous sins and May we do proper ibadat in the Qudr night.

When Imran khan spoke at the word government summit in Dubai this year he exactly said same words the rich culture the history and mountains and what not. I am not a Pakistani by birth but being a Kashmiri pakistan lives inside us just like you love this country. This video of your has really made me applaud you for your honesty and respect you gave back to people of Pakistan. Honestly Pakistan has so much talent but they are being carried away by so much of political tension in that country. Both India and Pakistan need to think about the future generations stop investing in weapons and start making a great future and a great countries. People from both countries need to realize and build a strong relationship with each other and work towards building their respective countries.Through you or many other vloggers Pakistan government can make it happen to bring back the tourism into Pakistan and  I wish you achieve what you just said in your video.

Hopefully someday even I can travel to see Pakistan. Love from India.",Ramesh P,2019-05-11T15:04:54Z,0

I was born and raised in Pakistan. I don&#39;t believe that Pakistan can ever be a tourism country because of the mind set of religious leaders of Pakistan. They will never let that happen. The other problem is the security. I have live 30 years of my life in Pakistan and traveling on Pakistani roads is filled with terror. You can&#39;t just simply pack up and go on a road trip like we(me and my wife) could over here in America. Indeed Pakistan is very very beautiful but there isn&#39;t any infrastructure or security for the people who are traveling unless you buy your own security.,The Office,2019-05-07T13:07:25Z,2
"No bro that was past but today there is not even a single robber or theft but some of the places have such types of terriost which are harming pakistan as a country and Muslims as a nation!!<br />But our security , army , agencies playing an important role to bring peace back in Pakistan and Inshallah very soon pakistan will be the develop country of the world !

"Pakistan has very beautiful places to visit. But there are 2 corrections, 1) Indus valley is  the worlds second  oldest civilization (Around  3500 BC) . The oldest is Mesopotamian at 8000 BC.  2) Anghor Wat is the largest religious  structure in the world  ( although not functioning ). There are no ancient structures comparable to it in the world, thats why its image is there in the Cambodian flag.",Aromal Satjayababu,2019-05-06T16:30:40Z,0

"The problem is that Pakistanis don&#39;t recognise its beauty and picturesque value as people spend time in europe rather than developing gifted areas by nature. I studied master in tourism but didn&#39;t get placement in tourism department as the position i applied for filled by 12th grade person, may be thanks to corruption..... still i wish for better and matching concept to develop and maintain a sustainable tourism policy",Rana Zubair,2019-05-03T01:24:56Z,0
"&quot;right attitude and vision&quot; HUGE problem until Imran Khan. Hopefully that vision will become reality soon. And if anyone related to Imran Khan is listening, please please please start regulating madarsas. MAKE them do a proper accredited Metric degree like Musharraff wanted, check if any of those &quot;alims&quot; teaching there have any actual &quot;ilm&quot; with regular testing of their skills, make them attend adult schools if they don&#39;t, require them to have an undergrad MINIMUM.

"I have no doubt that Pakistan is a very beautiful country, with a rich history and culture. Its people are also very beautiful in my eyes. The only problem that I see with Pakistan is their intolerance for those who are not Muslim, especially to we who are Jews of Israel. I have an old friend from Jerusalem who once flew from the Far East to Israel, with a stop-over in Pakistan. Because he is an Israeli, he was taken out of the plane and interrogated at the airport, before being allowed to continue his journey.",David Ben-Abraham,2019-05-02T06:03:00Z,0
"I lived there for four years, and always shared my views on the tourist potential yet to blossom that Pakistan has. Indeed, from historical ancient cites to its natural beauty, its rich culture and culinary vastness. All it needs is to address its safety challenges, and have a clear shared vision and determination to develop tourism, understanding the source of revenue it could be for the country.<br /><br />I discovered your videos via The Food Ranger, and got to love them!

"ATTENTION!!<br />For all tourists traveling to pakistan please do take what she has to say with a grain of salt, she is being paid to say all these things its part of this new drive to promote tourism, the cold hard truth is that pakistan is not yet safe enough, she&#39;s hiding everything ugly and its frustrating as much as i would love it but the picture she shows is not the pakistan that i live in. So please visit pakistan by all means if you want but be responsible you only live once and sometimes the state of this country can shift overnight eg a week ago  buses carrying a group of hazaras was attacked leaving 40 dead and more than a hundred wounded, they were attacked because they belong the the shiite sect of Islam not the sunni sect imagine what might might happen to you ?

I am a half Pakistani my mother was born and raised in Kenya. The land of pakistan is very rich in every way. Frankly Pakistani food is in my opinion the best in the world. I dont say that lightly as I never used to be a big fan of pakistani food when I was young and would often indulge in other cuisines mainly  middle eastern cuisines. The landscape of Pakistan is diverse and rich and its breathtaking. But the reason why Pakistan has not yet become this no.1 world tourist destination is simply due it (until recently) corrupt government.,Fahad Ahmed,2019-04-21T13:51:37Z,0

Ik you like to know them but at the same time it makes them uncomfortable a little even if u don&#39;t have bad intentions.....  Pakistan is on the right Path .....INSHA ALLAH we will stand up once again and build ourselves .... Everyone needs to contribute in this....

beautiful video. I just think we should leave it for those who really appreciate the country and the landmarks that are there. rather than disturbing natural land to make superficial buildings just for rich people to feel at home.. LEAVE the country as it is beautiful right now. and people who go there to visit they are seeing a country that has had culture and history for centuries and why disturb that for rich people wanting to Come in and stay in a hotel.. would miss the whole purpose of the country. and loose its ability to connect with locals and poor people who live there. where would they all live.  leave Pakistan as it is. people will organically go there if their passionate about what it has to offer already and not what needs to be made to suite rich paying people.,8JOY 202,2019-04-16T01:03:17Z,0

"This is so beautiful!  I agree, more people should travel to Pakistan by all means. However, building more hotels etc on shorelines or near the &quot;grand canyon&quot; of pakistan and too many tourists will only help in destroying the beautiful nature.

Even if you do; there are tonnes of evidences that they do. And it is not acceptable. May be you are too kind to them, but please do not forget the attacks they conduct to keep their names in News for some PR. Since you are a blogger, you should be reading more about such stuff. May be it is beautiful and all, but it wont be number 1 until they throw out the terrorists. <br /><br />All countries have flaws. You are in love with Pakistan.

Pakistan is an absolutely beautiful country that has been deliberately demonized and never shown for what it truly represents. Its people have too long been dehumanized.

"No wonder they covet us. Desire us. Envy us. Shun us. Hate us. Marvel at us. We took the birthplace of their religion, you see. We claimed the very Gangotri of their ancient civilization. We walked away with the most poetic of their languages, the most tallest of their mountain men, the most fairest of their green eyed children. We even walked away with the very river that gave India her name. We picked all of that up, along with our ball and balla, and walked off the field. Why? Because We.Are.Equal.Owners in that faith, that civilization, those green eyes, yes, even that mighty river.<br />(&quot;jao, hum tumhari team mein nahin khelte!&quot;)<br /><br />-Nasir",Nasir Naseem,2019-04-07T14:09:56Z,0

Pakistanis know nothing about Indus valley civilization and Mohenjodero....These places may have gone in Pakistan but they will always remain a part of India as well... Pakistanis are only interested in their Islamic culture ..,S K,2019-04-07T05:44:12Z,2
"@AIRBORNE ... My bro ,plz keep yourself busy with the terrorists ....You people chose Islamic culture over your punjabi and sindhi culture .....everyone was forced to speak Urdu which was originated in Lucknow ....You people have totally demolished Punjabi &amp;Sindhi culture ....and if you know about Indus valley and Mohenjodero then it doesn&#39;t mean that everyone in Pakistan knows about that ....so plz don&#39;t bark",S K,2019-04-07T11:49:04Z,0
ohh so so you are saying we dont know anything about indus valley and mohenjodero wow who are you to say that you are not pakistani n cant say anything about it ok we know everything about it bcz it is in pakistan . ajeeb banda hai tu chawal if pak is intrested in only islamic culture it wouldnt have open kartarpur rahdari for sikh brothers in india to came here .the thing is taht you are very uneducated,AIRBORNE,2019-04-07T09:44:18Z,1

"What&#39;s hurting Pakistan the most is religious extremism.  If Pakistan can control Mullahs and do away with blasphemy laws, yes, it can attract a lot more tourists and investment. Furthermore, the government in Pakistan is not concerned with cleanliness and having a masterplan for cities and towns.  You cannot develop a country without a municipality organizing and running cities, town and villages in an orderly manner. In other words, what Pakistan needs most are city planners and moderate, educated people who can overcome ignorant religious zealots.",John Smith,2019-04-07T02:47:48Z,4

"You ask why Pakistan cannot become the next Bhutan or Nepal?  I hope not.  These two countries are under the hegemony of India because they are too small to resist India&#39;s bullying.  Basically all India&#39;s smaller neighbors are under the hegemony of India except Pakistan which is big enough to defend itself.  Today Bhutan is basically under semi-occupation by India with tens of thousands of Indian troops stationed in the country of some seven hundred thousands.  India wants to keep Bhutan isolated and forbids it to have any diplomatic relations with any major countries.  Today Bhutan does not have diplomatic relation with the US, UK, France, Russia or even China, its neighbor on the north because India does not allow it.  Bhutan is under the constant danger of being annexed by India like its next door neighbor Sikkim, an independent Himalayan Buddhist kingdom even smaller than Bhutan and was invaded and annexed by India in 1975.  Nepal is a little bit better because it has more population and is harder for India to digest.  Still what India did to Nepal is just as disgusting.  Aside from the land grab from Nepal by India in 1962, India also seeks to isolate Nepal.  A few years ago Nepal had a devastating earthquake an a few months later India took advantage of the misery of Nepal by enacting an embargo on Nepal to maximize its pain just because the Nepali congress passed a law not to India&#39;s liking.  This kind of meddling is a major source of resentments among India&#39;s neighbors.<br />Basically today&#39;s India&#39;s foreign policy orientation towards its neighbors is a continuation of the expansionist British Raj, in other words a lot of bullying and land grabbing.  Ask the Pakistanis about Kashmir, the Chinese about South Tibet, the Nepalese about Kalapani and the Susta.  Or ask why the Manipuri people and the Sikkimese why they are ruled by India.",PomegranateChocolate,2019-04-06T21:27:18Z,0

"So have you made plans of how to protect it&#39;s environment once you have sold Pakistan as the prime destination for trekking, and building resorts and camping sites. Pakistan does not belong to you, so if the people have not decided to sell it as you see the future to make everything into a business and a polluted tourist mess, who are you to have dreams of Western capitalism for it. Everything you are dreaming of is to make into a playground for the West to consume. Do you have any idea how long the West has tried to own this part of the world. For you its food, its beaches, its religion are just there to be consumed and objectified. For Pakistani people it&#39;s how they live. It&#39;s their country and their future to dream of, not yours.",Alia Osman,2019-04-06T19:11:56Z,0

what ever she said is true that Pakistan can be the best country in the world... and that is the only reason that other countries are not allowing its nation to be stable for even a day... because if Pakistan got stable it can be the business hub all over the globe because it has almost everything one needs... and this was the reason that the true image of Pakistan was faked and stereotypes were created so nobody would care for this country... but not until now because the trends are changing and they are changing fast ;-),Faizan Afzal,2019-04-06T16:43:43Z,0

"Although she is reading a content someone else (or maybe herself) wrote and yes we have a lot of natural treasure.<br />But I do not want to see Pakistan where Capitalists and Elite control the natural resources. Like big tourism companies buying land on beaches and building massive resorts.<br />I do not want western inspired tourism in Pakistan. I do not want immoral activities being popularised at the cost of investment. <br />I do not want to see belly dancing, alcohol, slave trade happening. Currently, govt has poor enforcement to prevent these activities from happening.<br />I do wish to see my country progress in the way founding members envisioned. <br />Where small businesses benefit from the investment, where local markets grow.<br />Where people come to visit and accept our culture and values not something our colonial masters left for us.<br />I want to see Hunza and GB to hold their culture without looking at someone from Europe and feeling like a second class.

"When Pakistan are conspiring to dismantle Indian states then how anyone would expect them to utilize the natural beauties they blessed with  to earn milions of $. Where UAE have built artificial spectacles to transform themselves into  one of  the centre of world tourism. But Pakistan have so far spoilt 70 years after independence, failed to utilize extravagant natural sites to pull tourists from europe and usa  to eradicate the poverty. Shame and so unfortunate. Most ridiculous aspect of pakistan is that they still take pride in drowning neighbour&#39;s jet in a dogfight and take no bold steps to root out corruption which is destroying them from within as a nation.",Putin is Biden,2019-04-06T11:22:52Z,0

"Thank you Eva for this great Video! I forwarded your Video to our Video TRAVEL team with this message. Thank you! <br /><br />&quot;What do you think about Pakistan, should this be our next destination? Pictures of violence, tourism, wars etc most likely come to your mind. I believe in the power of tourism to change the conceptions of counties, like it&#39;s happening in Colombia and hopefully will happen in Iran. This Video addresses the power of tourism and reminds me why I love my job and would not trade it in within anything...&quot;",Andre Kiwitz,2019-04-06T10:16:53Z,0

"What actually is the thing that made Eva melt down and say &quot;This is my Pakistan&quot;? That must include the green mountains, golden deserts, the culture &amp; all the matter here around. But what, which I believe, moved her was the extreme hospitality, love and respect she was welcomed with. Ever see a people with tears when a foreigner visits them? This is Pakistan and the people of Pakistan alone. Every third comment below this video is written by someone with tears in their eyes. As someone said: In Pakistan we drink 3 cups of tea; the first you are a stranger, the second you become a friend &amp; the third you join our family and for our family we are prepared to do anything - even die&quot;.

"Bipin, we have great respect for Nepal too! In Pakistan, you will find Taxila, the second largest ancient Buddhist University in the world, 2500 years old, and among the most important world heritage. Buddhist excavation sites with ancient Buddhist archaeology span an area larger than the size of Nepal in Northern Pakistan (10,000 sq km in Azad Jammu Kashmir, 72000 sq km in Gilgit Baltistan, 50,000 sq km in northern KPK, and 20,000 sq km in Northern Punjab).",multan prarie,2019-04-07T15:19:09Z,1

Our Buddhist heritage in Northern Pakistan spans an area bigger than Nepal. Buddhist sites are also found in central and south western Pakistan. Because Pakistan is a poor country, we have not been able to study or develop these sites. However, research is increasing, and in the future we hope to discover much more, including the Buddhist heritage sites in Afghanistan.",multan prarie,2019-04-07T15:27:43Z,0

"Yes for sure Pakistan has all the right things to offer for Tourists but as a nation and as a government we really need to work on toilet facilities in every corner of the country. People don&#39;t have manners to use the restrooms and leave their (belongings) S**T for the next person to come, view, clean it and then use it. Pakistan was built on the name of Islam and the very first lesson in all the books of Deen is Taharat which is &quot;half of our deen&quot; however we consistently fail to abide by the very first brick of it. I strongly urge everyone to wake up and please please, please stop misusing these facilities wherever they are and also the government should build more facilities around the country and also take care of these,. People leaving and making a mess should be reprimanded for this and this can only happen if an eye is kept on this and the staff in charge is also strictly trained to abide by the rules. We always have an excuse we missed our prayer because there was no place for wudu. If such facilities are kept clean the next course is that people will not have an excuse to leave their prayers too unless if someone is totally heedless after that. Well, this one side of it so when the toilettes will be clean then how easy would it be for the tourists and the local people to travel around the country and contribute to the GDP. <br /><br /> Thank you Eva zu Beck for the Vlog. I would also suggest that you make another Vlog and publish it on this issue I have raised and I am sure your voice will be heard as you said It&#39;s your Pakistan.",Amna Sheikh,2019-04-05T09:32:58Z,0

Such a great country with such great minds. World top universities and research institutions have Pakistani students and professors still we fail to do best for this country. Why when the same talented people are in pak are not doing what they should be doing for pak. Why we are more loyal to others than our mother land. Why se tolerate looters in our offices..,nizam nizam,2019-04-05T08:01:43Z,0

Jahan jaye gi Pakistan mai no one will ask her to pay. We as a nation are doing much more than what others for tourists and it&#39;s good!!! She is enjoying the beauty of Pakistan&#39;s nature and culture. She is a tourist and shares videos on yt ..much of her viewership is from Pakistan.. I also love and respect her. Par humhare yahan koi Pakistan kay liye acha kya keh lay tou hum kuch zayada hi jazbati ho jatay hain aur zarorat se zayada protocol dene lag jatay hain..some honours and awards should be for nationals only.

"i hope you can promote Pakistan to investors at some point because the economic situation of the country needs to heal. Not many within the country itself can afford to travel even though they live there. Now a days with inflation and the deteriorating economy they can&#39;t even afford to pay electricity bills. People have to pay bills, get groceries,  petrol, etc and their salaries don&#39;t go up as the rupee falls and prices rise! How can they travel even within their own country if they don&#39;t make enough?  I hope your promotion will guide investors to enter and in turn the country can capitalize on it as Dubai did. I love your love for Pakistan because I am a Pakistani at heart even though i am born in America to Pakistani immigrants.",Naveed Jamal,2019-04-04T23:12:57Z,0

"Dear Eva<br />First of all, as a Pakistani, I thank you from the bottom of my heart  for giving so much respect to my beloved country.<br /><br />I have some pointers.<br /><br />SKIING.  I am an ardent skier myself who has skied in US and Europe.  In countries that are close to the equator, a ski resort is not possible below 10,000 feet where breathing is very difficult due to low  oxygen.<br /><br />BEACH RESORTS.  No alcohol, no  attraction.<br /><br />Plus, we have been plagued  with terrorism of which we  innocent Pakistanis, both Muslims and non-Muslims alike, are the front line victims.<br /><br />But, like  you,  and many other optimistic Pakistanis like me, we do hope, wish and pray.<br /><br />Once  again, thank you very  much for visiting my country, loving it, and presenting it to the world in such a fabulous way.",Malik Tariq,2019-04-04T19:44:06Z,0

"now i&#39;m jealous because you guys can do what ever you want, being a Pakistani is tough when you have a mom who doesn&#39;t let you go anywhere because she scared of her own people and she doesn&#39;t let me do kayaking. when ever i go to Pakistan she makes me stay at my grandpa&#39;s house, i don&#39;t get it even Pakistani Americans are filled with stereotypes about Pakistan (when Pakistan was listed among the most dangerous countries) (i&#39;m an female). but this time i&#39;m going to get myself an riksha . i wish my mom was more open about exploring and being adventurous. even when i went zip lining my mom agreed to it because my aunt was with me but then she was like are you crazy. (desi moms)  Pakistanis are one of the most kindest and caring i&#39;ve met. this year i&#39;m going to Pakistan to attend my cousin wedding and stay at my grandpa house and visit some relatives again. plus yaar whose mom goes to Pakistan only to buy clothes and visit relative. no i mean it i been to pakistan 3 times and each time i stayed for 3 month and i only went to moon market, grandpa house, and some relatives.",Dania Nisar,2019-04-04T19:31:19Z,0

People&#39;s manner of dress, &amp; facial hair = controlled. Non - muslims &amp; women are 3rd -class citizens, &amp; worse. <br />   Unless these things change, Pakistan won&#39;t be the # 50  tourist destination.",Marten Dekker,2019-04-04T17:54:02Z,0

Eva I m sorry about few Pakistani travelers who are questioning this tourism summit and creating a uncalled controversy by saying why Gov did not invite local tourist. Those stupid travelers don&#39;t know that the purpose of this summit by Gov was to promote Pakistan tourism internationally .. so it was obvious to invite the international travelers who already traveled Pakistan so that they can show the world how beautiful Pakistan is. Those YouTubers don&#39;t realise even if their videos are more amazing very few from outside may watch those but videos from you guys will be watched by more foreigners. And let me say your view of Pakistan and videos are also great showing a different perceptive. I m happy Mooroo and Ukhano stepped in and support you guys and shut those Pakistani YouTubers who were making unnecessary arguments .. we all love our guest in Pakistan and you guys can show better image of Pakistan in front of foreign media and people. Thank you. Please ignore those few people.,donnie darko,2019-04-04T16:36:25Z,0

"Hi Eva. I definitely agree,  that Pakistan can and will be the next top tourist destination in the world God willing. Imran Khan has the same vision and he is the one who will turn this in to a reality.  As tourism grows in Pakistan so will ordinary people&#39;s  lives with   their livelihoods getting a boost ,jobs will be created and investment will flock to these regions. Hotels and top restaurants will want to open up but all this will only  happen when Pakistan gives out the message to the world that they are a safe and secure country.Only then will tourism really take off in Pakistan. Positive media campaigns /advertising  will hopefully change the negative perception of Pakistan. Vloggers  like yourself  and other westerners are helping to change people&#39;s  outlooks but their is a lot of work to be done.",Pearl S,2019-04-04T16:12:10Z,0

I know I as a Nepali live in Pakistan I want to tell all the Pakistani ppl ur love and hospitality is ur most powerful owning In World from being universally most loved nation in the world. That is Pakistan that is no like other country. Pakistans  soul and its diversity is far more beyond then what is even shown here. Its gigantic in every form just no entertainment media to show other thn stupid  war and bad politics..Pakistan is way much more then what you think it is its totally opp to what the media gain by just defaming it. In real sense i see Pakistan&#39; a heaven with loving ppl in its country which is priceless.,The Truth Explorer,2019-04-04T15:53:45Z,6

"HI<br />First time viewer here, this vid popped onto my recommended today haha.<br />I&#39;m a Pakistani living abroad, there are the reasons why those things you mentioned have not happened.<br />It is because the people in power become unlike the commoners you meet, they get ahold of abit of wealth off Pakistani hard workers and refuse to give it up.<br />Alot of the wealth in the country is squandered by them or send abroad so they can buy foreign properties so they can pretend not to be wealthy.<br />Imran khan is different so i&#39;m keeping an eye on him and hopefully he can turn things around, but he&#39;s just one man against a pool of wealthy people not willing to give it up. <br />Pakistani people NEED to learn and accept who actually has their best interests at heart and not some politician hyping bullshit to stay in power.<br />- Just my 2 cents.",Razeen Ahmad,2019-04-04T14:14:21Z,2

A glance at Pakistan&#39;s overall literacy rate will show that only 37.8 per cent are literate (50 per cent for men and 24.4 per cent for women).<br /><br />This means 61.2 per cent are illiterate (50 per cent males and 75.6 per cent females).",Nouman Ali,2019-04-04T13:47:52Z,0

"I felt as if u were voicing my emotions regarding pakistan tourism that i have had in my heart all these 25 n more yrs of isolation internationally.. I felt tears in my throat, as I saw n heard ur  words., for u have a reach far n wide with these videos, it brings joy to my heart. Nothing has hurt us more individually n collectively than the isolation and judgement that we  have faced due to &#39;tags&#39; given to us sometimes due to reality hitting hard and mostly due to geopolitical conspiracies,  for most ones in the know, Know the potential of this country. we have suffered enough. The beautiful people of this country has suffered alot. A slight trickle of tourists has started pouring into the country and many of us r noticing it  much to our joy. We owe this much to u n other travel vloggers who have spoken n shown their heart out as they were pleasantly surprised at what they found here.

Pakistan could be a popular tourist destination for sure <br />But no1?<br />Seriously <br />That’s too far fetched !,Noel Shaju,2019-04-04T13:34:30Z,3
"Miss Lali not denying any of those facts , geographically diverse culturally warm loving people but so do many south East Asian countries whose government is more lenient towards tourism , quite the opposite of Pakistan who denies visa for many nations! Government should change their policy first if Pakistan wants to be face of tourism and the lady in this vlog only has vlogs in Pakistan and Nepal so she clearly hasn’t seen much of rest of world.or hasn’t shown people the rest of world so I don’t rate her overrated comment of Pakistan best diverse country in world ! A country with 98%muslim is not by any means culturally diverse.geographically yes Pakistan is beautiful and has good potential but I doubt to find cultural diversity among Pakistani people in different parts other than the differences btw rich and poor",Noel Shaju,2019-04-05T06:09:07Z,0
@Noel Shaju off course yes!  but it&#39;s not so strange if Pakistan becomes a no 1 tourism destination...

"From all the videos you made, this one literally touches my soul. The answer to all your questions is that pakistanis don&#39;t know what tourism means. The word has no literal translation or transliteration in any of the pakistani languages. Forget words, it has no meaning in the pakistani culture and tradition. Only a handful of pakistanis know of it and want it in their country. This is why the government even though they&#39;re trying, know zero of what they&#39;re doing to promote it. Like you said in your video, it will take decades to change. I&#39;m sure my fellow pakistani and fellow traveller&#39;s of Pakistan agree.",Majid A,2019-04-04T12:31:32Z,0

"Okay lets be honest here. If foreign tourists came here they would want to have alcohol, some musical clubs, beaches that permitted &quot;beach suits&quot; and alot more &quot;Freedom&quot; than it currently offers. If pakistan want to attract these tourists (who would manly be non muslim) it need to formulate rules and regulations accordingly. It has to become more like Malaysia or dubai or even turkey with less strict rules for &quot;some places&quot;. Ofcourse i am not suggesting to go western in a day or something but we need to find something balanced.",Baqir talpur,2019-04-04T12:29:01Z,0

It&#39;s all about accepting a person,  a country, a belief with all its good and bad shades. To admire something doesn&#39;t mean to over look its dark side....  Acknowledge it........ PS:  I am a Muslim...  But if I criticise my folks I will be condemed as a traitor or a bad son....  One cannot truelly appreciate something until one has the freedom to criticise or abandon it.
