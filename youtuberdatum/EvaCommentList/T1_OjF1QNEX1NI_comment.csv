"I think it’s highly irresponsible for people with platforms to be promoting travel right now. You are encouraging reckless behavior which can cost human lives.<br /><br />If you’re traveling to a place where there is a risk that you’ll introduce disease and where the local people do not have immunity, you are doing something unethical.  How do you really know if the virus is not on Socotra? How many were tested? Were you tested? You are young and could be asymptomatic. Its clear Yemen&#39;s healthcare system could not handle an outbreak. How painful would it be to look back on these photos/videos, unsure if you played a role in spreading a deadly disease to this precious community. There is a long history of western explorers doing this to indigenous people. <br /><br /><br />Please ask yourself, did you stay out of safety, or ego? These photos and your giddiness seem like a romantic story to boost your likes and followers. Sight-seeing with local fisherman is not &quot;quarantine&quot;. Choosing to miss a flight is not &quot;getting stuck&quot;. Its playing with fire.<br /><br /><br />While the rest of the world stays indoors, putting community above self, to protect one another, you do the opposite.  I urge you reevaluate your responsibility as an influencer, and your actions at this time.",momonala,2020-03-26T22:28:23Z,1
