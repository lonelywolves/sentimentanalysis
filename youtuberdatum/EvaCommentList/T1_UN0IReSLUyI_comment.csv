It’s closer to Somalia and is on the Somali plate so when the Somali plates moves away fully which it’s always doing it won’t even know what Yemen’s region will be like it is genetically Somali and Yemen and wel a lot of things genetically no one can claim it other then Yemen and Somalia it’s closer to Somalia has history with Somalia as in kingdoms similar to Yemen howver that was colonial history ... the natives  aren’t necessarily native as they haven’t stayed enough time to adapt they are more fit for Somalia and Yemen area ... physically and biologically howver culturally are extremely ready for the area as u see Somalis and Yemenis have a claim Somalis have a stronger claim but Somalis and Yemenis do not want any distress or war and Somalis and Yemenis,Bk O,2021-03-11T14:07:30Z,0

"I think it’s highly irresponsible for people with platforms to be promoting travel right now. You are encouraging reckless behavior which can cost human lives.<br /><br />If you’re traveling to a place where there is a risk that you’ll introduce disease and where the local people do not have immunity, you are doing something unethical.  How do you really know if the virus is not on Socotra? How many were tested? Were you tested? You are young and could be asymptomatic. Its clear Yemen&#39;s healthcare system could not handle an outbreak. How painful would it be to look back on these photos/videos, unsure if you played a role in spreading a deadly disease to this precious community. There is a long history of western explorers doing this to indigenous people. <br /><br />Please ask yourself, did you stay out of safety, or ego? These photos and your giddiness seem like a romantic story to boost your likes and followers. Sight-seeing with local fisherman is not &quot;quarantine&quot;. Choosing to miss a flight is not &quot;getting stuck&quot;. Its playing with fire.<br /><br />While the rest of the world stays indoors, putting community above self, to protect one another, you do the opposite.

Not Son Jesus!!!!<br />3) (Luke <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN0IReSLUyI&amp;t=6m40s"">6:40</a>) Student should learn from his Mushlam or Muslim Teacher. You deleted Mushlam from Hebrew Translation by forgery!!! To spoil Jesus Prophecy about Muslims.<br />4) Solomon Songs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN0IReSLUyI&amp;t=5m16s"">5:16</a> in Hebrew Mahamedem The em is added for respect like Allah is Allahem or Elohem. In Semitic languages Mohamed is 4 letters only like MHMD محمد from right to left!!! Mohamadem was translated in English to ALL LOVELY!!! How can you translate names!!? em is added for respect and is (The Great Mohamed) as in Hebrew they add it to Allah to be Allahem or Elohem. Allah is Alaha or Elaha in Aramaic.<br />5) Psalm 84:6 As they pass through the (Valley of Baca) as mentioned in Quran is Macca. In order to fabricate it they translate Baca the noun with capital to Valley of Weeping in Jordan!!! But where is the water well 💦 in Genesis <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN0IReSLUyI&amp;t=17m17s"">17:17</a>-21!!! They deleted the name of the Holy well Zam Zam as it is 20 meters from Kaba!!! It is producing water from (5,000 years) time of Abraham until now and with quality that Professor Emoto from Japan issued 5 Books on the (Miracles of water) and its crystals that is different than any water on earth!!! Its PH Value as Alkaline kills any germs 🦠 and Viruses 🦠!!!<br />6) John <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN0IReSLUyI&amp;t=14m16s"">14:16</a> {And I will ask the Father, and he will give you (another) advocate to help you and be with you forever}. Note (another) do you have two Holy Spirit!!! Some translate the word as (Comforter). Since he used to call Belal to raise Call of Prayer (Comfort us with it Belal).

Great idea to be there now instead of an apartment somewhere. <br /><br />I would suggest one thing though for you.  Try as much as possible to avoid going to Hedaibo (Island capital) and any other towns and stay with the team you have and I hope they don&#39;t go too. You never know if any of the people in the small towns coming from outside on those last flight got the virus and not showing symptoms.  There are very basic medical services there as you know and avoiding all possibilities is good to have such a nice and complete experience.<br /><br />Enjoy Socotra, the Yemeni wonder island.",me myself,2020-03-22T12:36:59Z,2

That is very smart of you killing two birds with one stone by having an adventurous experience and avoiding covid-19 at the same time,Shabbarr._.,2020-03-22T12:11:12Z,179

@Kxne that might be true but isolation is still a good choice nonetheless,Shabbarr._.,2020-03-24T05:48:54Z,1
"Actually I think it&#39;s not the wisest of choices. Covid-19 is asymptomatic and for some people symptoms can start showing up to 10 days later, that combined with poor/no testing means there&#39;s no way to know for certain if anyone has the virus on that island. If you&#39;re on that island you could end up dying from a preventable death because of the poor medical facilities, if you were to somehow contract the virus. She&#39;s obviously not going to be staying on the beach in a tent for a month is she, she&#39;s going to have contact with her other people, the risk is still there.",Kxne,2020-03-24T02:59:34Z,3
