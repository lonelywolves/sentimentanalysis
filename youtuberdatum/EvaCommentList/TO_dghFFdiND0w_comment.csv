"Thank you to everyone who made this experience such a beautiful time. Especially, I&#39;d like to thank the Chitral Polo Team for letting me see, film (and ride) their horses. I can&#39;t wait to be back next year! Lots of positive vibes to you all and thanks for watching! 🙌",Eva zu Beck,2019-07-15T13:16:05Z,1561

"It is world class travel, filmed and narrated by a highly curious, openly loving and compassionate person such as yourself, that will truly educate the minds and hearts of others, combating the lies of the mainstream media and its affiliates.<br />Pakistan is full of beauty and wonder, yet thanks to the actions of the few, the radical and intolerant few, that all are then painted with the same brush.<br /><br />Love is the only way.💝",Mama Marianovits,2021-03-11T06:08:24Z,0

No , ofcourse we have to put an animal into it. These horses do not look at ease, they do not look like they are having a good time. Their mouths are being ripped open all the fucking time, I do not see a single horse with it&#39;s mouth closed. I hate to see this. Stop promoting animal exploiting like this.

"The festival itself was beautiful. The riding however, not so great. The horses are in pain. You can see that by them for example opening their mouths because the riders are pulling extremely hard, their tails going straight out (certain breeds, like Arabians, do that often in nature but I&#39;m not 100% sure about the breeds of these horses so pointing it out anyways), them constantly having their ears backward and their facial muscles are tense. Otherwise great.",Katja,2020-08-20T19:09:27Z,0

"Thank you Eva for highlighting tourism potential of Pakistan. But I believe  Pakistan needs to 1) open up ( liquor bars, dance clubs, massage centers,etc. for tourists)  2) Build some infrastructure including good hotels, rest houses, airports, roads, toilets etc in areas where tourist destinations are located. 3) Get rid of religious extremism &amp; security issues and ban religious as well as political rallies on roads. It also must  ban plastic bags to keep the environment clean and green.  4) Relax visa policy and advertise/ promote its tourism industry worldwide. 5) Train the staff dealing with tourism management and privatise certain related services.",Adnan Faraz,2020-02-05T00:20:37Z,1

"I didn’t spot a single Pakistani women attending the entire event! Meaning it’s NOT a family event. The images show that Pakistan remains a country, in which half of its own population isn’t allowed to actively participate or even be seen. Women are locked away in the house and have no freedom. The only women at the whole event were Western women paying local guides for their safety. What a bunch of propaganda this movie is.",badgerlife,2019-09-12T19:59:39Z,0

Totally deluded!",D R,2019-09-10T10:42:16Z,0
"This YouTuber keeps speaking of Pakistan, lots of the areas she is visiting are not in Pakistan but Pakistan-administered-Kashmir, specifically Gilgit Baltistan. Such is Pakistan&#39;s advanced propaganda on &quot;Kashmir&quot;, they&#39;ve disconnected regions of the former Princely State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir from that history and ongoing &quot;dispute&quot;. The Pakistanis are now using YouTubers, who have courageously, previously ushered in the Arab Spring. When social media platforms are used by authoritarian regimes, u know democracy is losing the fight against unaccountable power. Pakistan is a corrupt country, people should never forget what is happening to millions of ordinary people forced into this bogus union. East Pakistanis left in 1971, may be this YouTuber should learn about Pakistan&#39;s history from professional historians and not Pakistani propagandists. May be she should report on the crimes being committed against Ahmedis and Shia in Lahore !",D R,2019-09-10T10:38:40Z,0

"The Northern Regions of Pakistan, the ones in Gilgit Baltistan and not KP Province are part of the disputed region of Jammu &amp; Kashmir according to international law and not propaganda of Pakistan. The people in these areas are poor and get treated like crap; it would be nice if people spoke up for their rights and how maltreated they are. Why is Gilgit Baltistan always removed from Jammu &amp; Kashmir Conflict? It&#39;s always Pakistanis speaking about these regions, never the people themselves who are second-class citizens in their own homelands. Authoritarianism is spreading everywhere now, and they have lots of paid clients from the world of social media. This is terrible for genuine democracies and human rights, for the indigenous peoples of their own homelands.",D R,2019-09-10T10:34:04Z,0

"Why would some one (especially a girl) leave everything behind her/him in Europe and visit a third world country (Third world Not for me but for Western people )? After achieving your target and hidden agenda You must confess that your all good thoughts about Pakistan were fake and you were never impressed. Don&#39;t make us fool. Obviously one of your motive behind visiting Pakistan is getting fame, popularity and followers. Most important: Who cares about your thoughts for Pakistan and Pakistanis.

I mean just give it a try to know just some basics of Islam. If it makes sense then try to know more about it if it doesn’t make sense to you then nobody is forcing you. All I wish is that you just study it from some to more only if you think it worth. I always support you and have good wishes for you. Im a Pakistani yet settled in Hong Kong.
