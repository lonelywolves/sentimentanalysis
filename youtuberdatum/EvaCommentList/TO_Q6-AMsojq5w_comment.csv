"This is &quot; The Occupied Assyria,&quot; a land deprived of its indigenous people  &quot;The Assyrians.&quot; The Assyrians  were mascaraed and exiled out of their land by Turkish and Kurds for the solely reason of Assyrians Christian faith.

"I am from Slemani, and my city has never been Assyrian, and the whole province has always been Kurdish.

"You did not really go to iraq !, you went  to Kurdistan , Kurdistan it’s a disputed territory between the government of iraq and the Kurdish people  , completely isolated from  mainland iraq and separated by borders and the Kurdish army , If you really want to go  iraq then you should be heading down south from Kirkuk , Mosul , baghdad down to Basra , I understand it’s cooler to say that you went to iraq rather than saying you went to Kurdistan as this more appealing to your audience!",Patric Ryan,2021-01-31T06:27:02Z,0

In fact, Saddam was trying to unite Iraq with Kurdistan so that we could be strong together, and no one could rob revolutions from us like America and Europe stealing wealth from the Iraqi people. That is why we see the Iraqi people as poor.And in the year 2019, America recognized that the invasion of Iraq was a mistake and Saddam Hussein was a peaceful man, not a dictator. Two months later, Britain built a statue of Saddam Hussein Lakefro for their mistakes in front of the media.",Faeq Alobaidi,2020-09-05T22:17:00Z,0

"I believe the perception of refugees coming into Europe lays in the separation of what type of refugee we speak of. A economic refugee or a war refugee. And what ended up happening was that a lot of refugees coming in were not war refugees, i personally dont think its fair. I believe war refugees should have priority and the western government just ended up not making that distinction, allowing in people who simply wanted to migrate for better lives, but not for the emergency reasons others needed to flee and consequently came with different mindsets, which ended up impacting various communities that tried to integrate them. These issues are way more complex than people make it sometimes. <br />God bless you all and that may God rid the world from war and famine!",Isabel Morgado,2020-07-17T14:09:47Z,0

"Love from Somalia 🇸🇴 to my Ayubbid brothers and all Iraq 🇮🇶. Beautiful.<br />Well said Baderkhan, “no one wants to go and migrate from Home  to another unknown country, unless there are problems at home”  it really hits those people who say “go back to your country” .  Just imagine if there was no war in Iraq and Syria = no body wants your fucking country.<br />Aaaand of course stop invasions and killing people, that’ll solve the migration problem too..",Mctoob YT,2020-04-29T22:29:53Z,0

"We can thank all the same group of Elitist  that are still starting all the War&#39;s today!! The Legue of Nations did this at the end of WWI, dividing up The Ottoman Empire, the remains of modern Turkey. These countries didn&#39;t exsist and were just drawn on a map to please the British and French Governments with their own region&#39;s of influence! The border&#39;s were drawn through people&#39;s lands and tribal areas that had been their&#39;s for thousand&#39;s of years. Families were split up by these new borders and homes were taken, lands that had been in families forever taken away with no compensation. This is the same kind of stupid idea that was used in the Versailles treaty in Europe at the end of WWI. New countries born, lands taken away from others, creating hatred and resentment , and hardship on people that wouldn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t forget. Hence WWII !! If you read or look this up you will see what I&#39;m saying is factual. If you are setting in the comfort of your home and someone comes and takes it by force and keeps most of your personal things and property , you would not be happy. Then, say you have to live a whole different kind of life in poverty and you have to walk by your house everyday , wouldn&#39;t that make you a little resentful??

"The monastery is stunning. I watched a documentary that was filmed when ISIS were controlling &amp; defending Mosul...the filmmakers visited the monastery &amp; they stood on the balcony with the priest &amp; could hear &amp; see an ISIS position being shelled. It is so lucky they didn&#39;t do to it what they did to Palmyra!<br /><br />If anybody is interest you can see it here. The clip starts from 53 mins, although i&#39;d recommend the whole documentary as it gives amazing insight into the war on ISIS. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFP5ruZBz2Y&amp;t=1700s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFP5ruZBz2Y&amp;t=1700s</a>",Tom D,2019-12-26T10:50:18Z,8

"Funny how they call Erbil their capitol when it&#39;s originally an Assyrian city built by them (A small geogle search will prove it), when the Assyrians still exist and when in fact the whole region they call Kurdistan is the homeland of the ancient Assyrians with the Kurds only being squatters on the land... And i don&#39;t understand how do you call it a trip to Iraq when you only visit small part of it in the north east, not getting even close to the largest cities like Baghdad and Mosul... I think people who say they&#39;re visiting Iraq and only go to the northern part &quot;kurdistan&quot; are only being disingenuous by depicting their trip as a trip to a war torn place to hipe it up, while only visiting the places that were least affected by war. And a lot of so called travel vloggers have done this deception.",Ibn Canaan,2019-12-20T16:15:14Z,0

"@Nightmareee <br />That is not called betraying, many Kurds were obliged to convert to Islam, some converted by their choices, and some converted to Islam then left Islam and went back to their original religion. You can read Al Bidayah Wal Niyhayah that talks about the Kurdish armed struggles against Arab Muslim conquerors. I think Yazidism and Yarsanism were both one religion before Islam, then after coming Islamic conquests, they separated into parts. But still both religions share a lot of similarities. You can search on google to know more about this.<br /><br />But even Yazidis who didn&#39;t leave Yazidism, could not save their religion as it was necessary, there are much Islamic influences of Yazidism. From Arabic words to Islamic thoughts.",SAHAND,2021-04-05T16:58:37Z,0

"She failed to mention the 15 to 20 checkpoints she would have to go through to get from way over by duhok to halabja. Different armies ran by different political parties. Sometimes they are nice sometimes they are not. I used to drive as a 24 year old girl alone between cities last year. Usually I was okay, but you need to show your ID they will question you and a few times I had my entire car ripped apart and searched by soldiers and another time was went to visit their commander who was intimidating and scary and wanted to know what I was doing etc. the rest of the checkpoints are cool and they wave you through. We also can’t deny that lately in northern Iraq we have seen a resurgence of ISIS and they do have special counter terror forces who go out in public And ride around on their trucks with their big .50 cal machine guns. However you see this everywhere and u will get over there and ignore it very fast. However no one steals things from u and like no one is going to kidnap you. No it isn’t all paradise, but petty crime here is relatively low, just don’t go outside causing a public scene and you will be fine. Try to dress more formally, the travelers tend to stand out like a sore thumb. Don’t go walking around the city wearing s north face and a backpack and hiking boots, you looks ridiculous. Put nice businessey looking clothes on. Nice jeans colored shirt, watch and nice shoes. Unless your going in the dirty areas, you just don’t need to carry all that.

"It was a very popular “village” or town whatever you decide to call it, in the late 90s because it had rich farmers which grows grapes and pomegranates and other things like tomatoes 🍅 And if look 2 km west from the Amedi mountain top you can the Saddam Hussein’s destroyed mansion. That’s because Amedi was so famous and it had all kind of rich people and leaders living there, Saddam wanted to take over the mountain. But instead he build himself a mansion nearby Amedi so he could obsérvate and check what was happening on the mountain",Umm Ala,2019-12-09T21:34:25Z,1

"​@Sabahat Khan Khan is Mongolian word means king its not a surname or tribe name and its wide spread across the world because of Mongol conquests by the Mongol warriors and its just used for prestige and strong tribes for example the strong tribes in Afghanistan or Pakistan use Khan while weak or small tribes dont use it for example gokhan in turkish gok means sky han means king , so skyking",ahmad mohammad,2019-12-19T13:44:52Z,1
