"I love watching your videos!  My name is Ben Novick, and I&#39;m the local private investigator on the Big Island of Hawaii.  We have all of the climates of the world and since the pandemic have experienced an interesting time surviving without many tourists, but it&#39;s extra beautiful. Here, we have little to no crime as we use to experience in Los Angeles where I came from 22 years ago.  The island is 184 miles around, with 170K people, two volcanoes and 5 Covid cases last week. Here, my jobs have mainly been security for entertainment people who  come here to escape civilization. A couple of stalkers have even tried to purse people here, but were unsuccessful.  I have friends who are dogs, mongooses, a drake (male) Perin duck named &quot;Donald&quot; and a black Astrolarp hen named &quot;sparkle.&quot;     She lays me one big brown egg each morning, leaving it on a chair outside my front door.  <br />We are totally self sufficient.  While I don&#39;t often eat red meat, we have cows, goats, sheep and a mass of wild boar and all the fish you could desire. <br />If you like mangoes, strawberry papayas, and coconuts you may eat them to your heart&#39;s desire in addition to many other varieties of tropical fruit, including Suriname cherries.  All vegetables grow here but carrots and potatoes need to be grown in a soil garden because much of the ground is lava rock.  My latest job has been taking  a few locals on UFO tours.  Since the pandemic we have been seeing lots of them, and I had one startling experience when I pointed a flashlight at one and it came to us--scared my guests to the point when I looked around they were gone.  But, I sense they mean us no harm.    If ever here, feel free to look me up!  Favorite spots are the black sand beach, Akaka falls, rain forest, an observatory, the volcanoes park and caves.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful explorations!   Have a good evening.",Ben Novick,2021-04-25T08:02:33Z,0

"There is a kind of arrogance-<del>-perhaps that is too strong--</del> but maybe a sort of foolishness that comes with the triple gifts of wealth, youth and appearance that is deeply but subtly rotten. The ego is too big, manner too confident and  behavior too exhibitionistic to be authentic. She seems like a kind but quite na√Øve young woman who assumes that her life is a stage performance and other people are mostly props. She is &quot;here&quot; to impress us with her privileges and moves through the world in carefully measured performances.  Aging will involve painful losses and  important lessons and one day perhaps, this actress might look inward and grow.",DoctorGarkle,2020-11-30T21:34:48Z,0

They prefer to keep the same crew rather than to postpone the operation of the vessel for a few days and to pay more to agents and plane tickets. ...as a result there are seafarers who are on board for more than a year, maybe 1 and a half.",Iakwvos Birdakas,2020-08-31T22:33:37Z,0

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.And this is the judgment: the light has come into the world, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil.For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may be clearly seen that his works have been carried out in God.‚Äù<br /><br />Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.<br /><br />But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.‚Äù<br /><br /><br /><br />And if anyone‚Äôs name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.",Bebe o,2020-08-07T20:21:15Z,0

You have not seen big boats. I worked for Hyundai in Busan south Korea...Half the city of Busan is the car plant. I took a bus to work from my Hyundai apartment to my office and both were in the company compound i.e. both bus stops were within the compound O_o!. (basically half the city is owned by Hyundai and is part of the compound). Out my office window was a Mega car park up to the horizon of cars waiting to be shipped around the world all the way to the port and at the port were these Goliath ships like mini cites on water that would dwarf the average skyscraper in just height alone.,ojbeez,2020-08-03T19:07:36Z,0

"Big difference living and working on one for months on end. Sooner or later steak and lobster every Friday on Diego Garcia on board my ship wasn&#39;t enough from keeping me from going on island. It can honestly feel like prison after a while no matter how nice it is. You get institutionalized and you have to do things to keep your mind out of being confined. Gym, watch movies, play basketball, play Nintendo, build things. Have to have a regimeted schedule. Make your bed, clean your bathroom, have discipline. People can flip out there. You may not think it will happen to you but if you don&#39;t deal with it and cope, it can be brutal.",Amphib Aav,2020-07-13T05:28:38Z,1

The first three days I didn&#39;t see any other ships or planes in the sky, a real getaway from modern communications.<br />The best but was standing at the front of the ship one day, in the sun and having dolphins play around in the sea. <br />Slow travel can be enchanting.",City Desk452,2020-07-07T18:46:31Z,0

"I should consider myself extra fortunate, then.  I booked passage on a small freighter back in 2018.  No rules about where I could go or film/take pix, with the exception of the engine room, which I was welcome to visit as long as a senior officer took me there.

"This is a nicely done video. Thank you. But I must also add that your experience, while a bit unique having been on a boat, is, well, rather ordinary given the times. People around the world have been isolated, quarantined and displaced from their normal lives and routines. I guess watching what was a compelling experience for you personally seemed dull and ordinary for me. I&#39;m stranded in Thailand where I was stuck in a small apartment for 3 months communicating with folks around the world doing similar stuff.  There was little unique or interesting in your story, other than the boat angle. And slow ocean going freighters, as you discovered, are pretty boring as well.",Travels with Charlie Hub,2020-07-07T08:07:24Z,0

"2000km per 7 days is 11 km per hour. Probably the most ecological way of traveling long distances. When you divide the burnt oil by all the milions of kilograms of cargo, it is very efficient in amount of oil per moved kilogram of cargo. The following flight was just the opposite.

I spent 4 days on a cargo ship from Bali to Flores Island because there were multiple smaller boats taking the journey that had sunk in the weeks before due to being over capacity. We were told it would only be a 2 day trip but it ended up being much longer. I wish our accommodations had been like yours haha We slept in the belly of the ship on wood boards surrounded by hundreds of people (and insects) packed in like sardines with no ventilation and lots of smokers.

"Yep, that is Jolly Quarzo - a 240m long ship from Messina Line Company. By the way, her ship is Ad Astra (70m long) so she overestimated the size. In reality, all deep water vessels look huge when compared to what people normally see on land. At open sea, you cannot easily compare it to anything around you so people tend to disorientate and delude themselves about sizes and distances. They always assume ship/land is closer and bigger than it really is. For example, 1 nautical mile (1.852km) really looks like 100m when at sea.",Simon R.,2020-07-07T09:21:32Z,1

@AirwaveMustang ya cool thanks for that. I see now. Interesting. Didn&#39;t know they made them anymore. The only sea going Landing Craft ships I thought existed were the Tank Landing Ships. I&#39;m guessing she rode Socotra 2. Seems to do that run to Dubai- Socotra. Something interesting about a Landing Craft is they must be a flat bottom boat to be able to beach it and ride shallow water. A Tank Landing Ship or LST military used you could  flood ballast tanks for deap ocean travel and pump water out for shallow water and beaching. It would be interesting to see if these do that. And yes its the Ad Astra vessel according to ship registration not Socorta 2,Amphib Aav,2020-07-13T20:27:26Z,1
"@Nicolas Denis I was just checking out the SOCOTRA 2 vessel on line. To my surprise, it is listed as a Landing Craft. ( I could be wrong but I believe this is vessel she took)  Well, I&#39;d be curious to see if that bow lowers like a ramp thus giving characteristics of a Landing Craft for roll on roll off gear. I was thinking more about the military Landing crafts, so in the end, you were right. Seems like a Landing Craft with container hauler characteristics. I thought with all the containers on board was just a container hauler. I get the security thing and all that but would have liked a more detailed description of the vessel. There ya go. Ok I just viewed video again and she is standing in front of ship registration number and yes. IMO 9628556 as mentioned in a posting here. Ad Astra. Not Socorta 2. Landing Craft.

"You have spent 80 days in Socatra island and enjoyed everything , you posted a lot of videos from there , people were very very generous and kind to you , haven‚Äôt said that in those 80 days you never mentioned anything whatsoever about those poor people struggle and deliver a message behalf of them to what kind of unseen occupation the are under from the UAE üá¶üá™. You never bothered to share some light to the real conflict over there and try to help such an innocent and lovely people. You were only taking and taking and taking during all of the journey and you didn‚Äôt give anything back . I don‚Äôt know why you really left but few days ago the island has fallen into UAE and no coincidence the people who ported you out were the same people. I believe you should‚Äôve said something and not be scared like the rest of the cowards in this world.",Ali Yemini,2020-06-29T01:43:34Z,0

A chapter closes and another begins an amazing journey you had there. As for the life at sea as you found out the days pretty much blend into one  and you were lucky that you didn‚Äôt get hit by the cyclone at sea. I was in a massive storm that hit our 74ft yacht somewhere between Tonga and New Zealand which went the whole night and things got very lively that night but the next morning it was dead calm with not a breath of wind and it stayed like that for the next three days. As your Captain said it‚Äôs the nature of the sea very unpredictable.üëçüëçüëç,Mick Angelhere's World,2020-06-28T23:09:52Z,1

Iran also has the longest coastline with the Gulf...Historically speaking 5000 years of history the Persians dominated that Gulf. Also, the Persian Gulf has always been the lifeline for the Persian empires of old. The Arabs have access to the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea. Today, the whole world is afraid of Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz/Persian Gulf. Not Saudi Arabia or UAE!",Khaled S,2020-06-28T19:42:09Z,0

You were very fortunate. Any place else you be stuck in isolation the  UAE is a rich country and the king is paying for the test. In the beginning it was 3 thousand a test. Now it&#39;s still 200 buck a test. Majority country even the top country can&#39;t not afford to test everbody. So they just put them in isolation for 16 days to a month. Yep crazy year. Made everyone think about what important. Not surprising home refurbished &amp; hardware  store are doing fantastically. Home as to be custom fit perfect  now. Clothes no so. Empty stores.

"@raguerraa The entire planet has always been a zombie movie full of zombies easily suckered and scared by the elites into any agenda that they want by scaring the dumb sheeple into fighting wars etc on their behalf and they have been scaring the dumb masses with fake terrorism for decades now and now with a totally FAKE pandemic that is based on the Coronavirus which is just simply the COMMON COLD - people are so dumb they havent realised that the &quot;terrorists&quot; have went into hiding in case they catch the &quot;virus&quot; while the Elites and their corrupt puppet governments and mainstream media scare the masses into their New World Order - One World Communist Government DICTATORSHIP agenda. Go read the Jesus, Hitler and Wizard of Oz post and the watch the Dr Judy Wood videos at this link here to see how much we have always been getting lied to with Part 2 coming soon going to expose how all of our Countries, Governments, Courts, Police etc are all Private CORPORATIONS owned and controlled by the VATICAN and we are their slaves owned by them via our birth certificates.",William Woods,2020-07-15T18:24:32Z,0
"@ROCK BOTTOM ya, go down to the central Philippines to Camarines Sur and get to Malandog island. Just getting there is nuts! Then stay on island if you can stand fish and whatever made their style, flies, mosquitos all over your food. No ice, no cold beer. No AC. Boats are your only way to get around. At night you&#39;re traveling on the water with only a flashlight. Got the Hershey squirts, sun baked like a lobster. Everything is wet from the ocean or your sweat. No toilets to speak of. Forget toilet paper. Thank God for a portable vidette.  That ain&#39;t a vacation. That&#39;s an insane adventure.  And drag along 6 people and an old lady with you looking for relatives she hadn&#39;t seen in 60 years. Then get to Naga City, take plane to Clark field and face 3 hours of Manila traffic with a pissed of taxi driver and I don&#39;t blame him. Then when my wife&#39;s nieces see me at the mall food court, they say, &quot;what the hell happened you you&quot;?
