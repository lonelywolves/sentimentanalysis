"You can still have your fantasies. The gentleman you met on the island appears to be quite happy and content with his life. What you may consider hard, he looks at it as, just another day. Perhaps you should consider this before you determine that he cannot enjoy himself. I can almost guarantee you that he enjoys looking at the stars, and sunsets every day.

"Soqotri people are not Somali at all! They speak their own language, Soqotri, which isn&#39;t Arabic either but is a Semitic language and related to other Modern South Arabian languages like Mehri and Shehri, whose speakers are located in Yemen and Oman. It was once part of the Himyarite Kingdom that was ancient Yemen. Foreign powers, including Ethiopians, Portuguese, Indian, Omani, British and these days Emiratis have all stopped for a time, but in its long history back to ancient times, the inhabitants were never Somali tribes nor was it ever part of or under control of Somaliland, Puntland, Somalia, or any Somali clan. <br /><br />Beause it is in a crossroads, the Soqotri people have Afro and Indo races mixed in, but the predominant genetic heritage is Arabian. Some individuals show more of the others but in the same family you have a variety. You can see similar mixes all along the coast of Yemen and Oman. Very old pictures clearly show the Arab characteristics and style of dress of the people, and Hamid himself in the video is clearly Arab with some African admixture. <br /><br />I have met several officials and students from Soqotra and have lived on both sides of the water including the Horn of Africa. Soqotri people in no way, shape or form consider themselves Somali. If anything, they consider themselves quite independent of political claims and land grabs!",Purple Kitten,2021-02-06T12:41:17Z,3

Socotra is Somalia 🇸🇴🇸🇴,An Internet User,2020-09-26T16:16:34Z,6
"See my comment above with detail. Socotri is a Semitic Modern South Arabian language related to Mehri and Shehri, located in Yemen and Oman. In ancient times it was part of the Himyarite Kingdom of ancient Yemen.  No Somali clan has ever ruled it! Not Puntland, not Somaliland, and certainly not Somalis from far away down in Mog. I personally met quite a few Soqotri natives. No way do they consider themselves Somali! They are Arabian people with some Afro and Indo admixture genetically, not Afro with Arab admixture like people in the Horn of Africa. It&#39;s quite the opposite.",Purple Kitten,2021-02-06T12:52:11Z,0

My ancestors were Yemenite Jews who were  native to the land for thousands of years and now the last of the Yemenite Jews  we&#39;re driven out by The Houthis. I always wanted to go back and see the green Highlands of my ancestors in South Central Yemen but I don&#39;t think it will ever be possible in my lifetime. I&#39;m also heartbroken by the terrible price that the people of Yemen have to pay because of this terrible Civil War. Nobody seems to care nobody does anything about it everybody talks about Syriabut nobody talks about Yemen. I pray that the Civil War will end and that the people of Yemen will be able to live in peace and heal from this horrible terrible scourge of War..,MrPickledede,2020-08-13T12:59:32Z,0

"francis z I have no clue what you are talking about. I comment on there been beautiful places in the world and having lived and worked on an isolated Island (in West Africa) and you are talking about “not being so welcoming to ‘these people’? I never been to this place. I do not associate “people” with “country.” As a Black American I lived in Morocco and have many friends there. It is wrong to think the people within any country are all the same. That is called “prejudice.” I have been to many African countries too and in some of them I was not welcomed and treated as respectfully as White people. It is all relative, ones attitude, how you treat others, and what you believe about yourself. A lot of people in other countries are not going to like you because you are an American. Others because you are Black. It doesn’t ... they do not change who you are. One of by best friends is from Iran. Coolest dude I know. He took a bullet for me. He is an American citizen. I cannot judge him because his ethnicity is Iranian. I do not know you and I do not want to take what you said the wrong way.  I have been to places in the world people never heard of and most places are not the way the American media spins it. Most of it is BS and propaganda.",Muad' Dib,2020-04-12T22:12:45Z,0

"Mr. Hamid is living an uncomplicated life. going by the ups and downs of the fish he catches everyday. He does not read newspapers, watch tv, no phones and to live like that is his choice. in all his 50 years he would have tried at least a few times to change and live and mingle with others but for reasons only known to him he has preferred this and so it is not hell. may be for us it will be difficult. Another point i would like to make here is that Yemen and Saudi Arabia is of the same culture and as per Quran Saudi Arabia should help its neighbour. A country is only a multitude of people and it has been so that one place has oil and another does not. One can see what Saudi Arabia will be without oil Saudi Arabia by seeing Yemen. Saudi Arabia is acting high and mighty and Yemen is playing the role of the low and impoverished. As per the tenets of Quran Saudi Arabia should help Yemen by cutting short some of their extravagances and investment in weapons of destruction. Then You can really think Saudi Arabia is a holy land. Now it is only namesake.",Arun Ravi,2020-02-24T15:39:51Z,0

"Interesting fact: the Robinson Crusoe novel was inspired by an earlier Arabic philosophical novel Hayy ibn Yaqzan written by Ibn Tufayl, which tells a story of a feral child who grew up in an isolated desert island. It is a very influential work that shaped Western philosophy and led to the European Enlightenment.<br /><br />Unfortunately the wiki page of Hayy Ibn Yaqzan used to have a lot of info, but suffered vandalism from editors who have anti-Islamic agenda.",alphazar,2019-12-24T12:02:20Z,1

"Seriously don&#39;t let people know about this place. Idiotic real estate and hotel monopolies want to take this place. And then it flocks with people displacing the locals. I really hate that. Probably some old corrupt business men and upper class people want to buy up that place. They need to form policies quickly to stop foreigners from trying anything there so the locals can instead support the economy if it does become a popular place. I&#39;m a foreigner myself but wouldn&#39;t dare try to take the land from them. I&#39;m just speculating but it could happen soon once the effects of the Yemeni civil war/war and poverty decline. It has all the hallmarks of being popular: crystal blue oceans, dolphins, beautiful rock formations and greenery. Yeah this would be a top place especially considering only locals are there. I really hate corrupt opportunistic people. Those are the same ones who take the natural resources from poor countries and increase the house prices for locals.",Falcon X,2019-09-30T01:33:23Z,0

"Westerners find isolation so intriguing. Lol its quite natural here in the pacific. We have normal sized islands with populations little over 40,000 people &amp; then we have really tiny islands so small with only few trees on it with the smallest having 5 coconut trees on it. They may be isolated but we use them every now &amp; then when we want to isolate frm the main population.",Faanēngaaw,2019-07-29T10:44:59Z,0

Schepvogel K they have the right to return Yemeni Jews are the same as Muslim Jews my grandfather told me that in the 1940s white man from Europe came to Yemen and promise the Jews a house and a job if they agree to go live in Palestine and every Yemeni was poor so most Yemeni Jews agreed to go live Palestine so they moved for a better life but the more important question do the Palestinians have the right to go back to palatine and I think they do,Hemyarite .

"Life is tough there but sure they are more content inside compared to those who have &#39;everything&#39; they desire. They worship their LORD in the true sense. In seclusion but surrounded by all those entities (other than the ungrateful humans) who never disobey their LORD. They have desires but not to be tempted or taken unfair advantage of like in the modern capitalistic, material societies. They are blessed and have truly preserved their faith, i believe.<br /><br />About the tribulations during the end times, the blessed prophet (as) said to take shelter with sources of livelihood (goats and sheeps) in mountains or deserts or places where it rains and water flows.",Ahmad Usman,2019-06-18T00:08:50Z,1

I&#39;m just paraphrasing.  <br />Muhammad (sws) is the person that is most beloved to Allah, yet this is the humble life he lived and honestly it really made me feel how we take everything for granted and forget how people that struggle to even make basic needs to survive.",SeNniN,2019-06-17T19:52:15Z,0
