"Hey Eva,  just read your note in video description, are you saying that you prefer not to possibly infect yourself at the risk of infecting an entire vulnerable island that has no proper health infrastructure. Isn&#39;t that selfish? Also, didn&#39;t you travel through multiple airports, including Egypt which has Coronavirus cases, before arriving in Socotra? Also, do you know that many young people can have Coronavirus but just show no symptoms? Your actions are unethical. Our government placed anti-Coronavirus measures. They asked tourists to leave on that flight.

Those goats are so cute. My gosh. I want one. I want two that will keep my 4 cats and dogs company. Glad you&#39;re ok. That&#39;s a pretty nasty looking laceration and glad it&#39;s not serious. I got one on my wrist that squirted blood with each heart beat when I was a child. Scary! I&#39;m relieved yours was not that bad. Something that can stop bleeding. Super glue. I think there&#39;s non toxic kinds or some kind of glue. Someone told me the military invented something like that to quickly close wounds. You don&#39;t want to bleed excessively two hours from human help. Please be safe. 💔♥️,Joseph Barney,2020-04-07T21:40:32Z,0
