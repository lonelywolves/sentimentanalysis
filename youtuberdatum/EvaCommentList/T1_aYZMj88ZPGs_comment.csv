"Ms. Eva zu Beck, when covid19 crisis is over please consider visiting the Philippines. Since you love the remote natural places I recommend you to go to Jomalig island (pronounced as Homalig) for an island getaway, mountain climbing and camping at Mt.Pulag, wild trekking at Mt.Pinatubo (it&#39;s a volcano), go island hopping in Siargao or Palawan, swim with giant Butanding fishes in Oslob, Cebu. You need to stay for 3-4 weeks to do all of these! Mike can guide you 😁",Maria Parreb,2020-03-27T12:50:03Z,1
