"Hey there Fellow Adventurers! If you were here last week, you&#39;ll know that this video went live with some serious editing issues. AND it was the only time I didn&#39;t re-watch the final export before uploading. AND I was climbing Kilimanjaro when the video went live (pre-scheduled). Miraculously, I managed to take it down with a very limited internet connection up on the mountain. Well, here&#39;s TAKE 2 😜 Hope you enjoy this story from Bangladesh, from some time ago... (Pre-COVID). Sending you lots of warm wishes from Tanzania! ✨",Eva zu Beck,2021-01-30T10:28:25Z,256

Manipuris  people were there before Bangladesh was born. In the history of Manipur Bangal province( both Bangladesh and west Bangal) was called Pasha or  Basha meaning a Turkish district. The Word Bangla is a misnomer. Its quite ironical that Meetei are considered tribal in Bangladesh.,B CH,2021-02-08T12:18:34Z,0

It is scientifically proven with helping digestion namely when licking fingers after finishing eating with hands. Also food tastes alot better when using hands to eat food. This common islamic practice has now been proven by science..just do your research and you will know. (Off course islam teaches to wash hands before eating and do not dry your hands after washing them).,Racimuk RR,2021-02-05T00:24:52Z,0

"Manipuris have been living in Bangladesh for many hundreds of years from the area inhabited by the Indian Manipuri state, they are part of our tribal people of Bangladesh. They are a very civilized and polite people.<br />Eva, if I knew you would come to Bangladesh, I would have met you from Dhaka, because I am one of your subscribers, and a very good fan. I follow you on all other social sites including YouTube. Many good wishes for you. Muhammad Zahir (from dhaka Bangladesh) Thank you",Muaz BD Voice,2021-01-30T13:16:37Z,3
@YANG LEE KEI You are welcome<br />(I wish you all the best),Muaz BD Voice,2021-02-26T14:03:35Z,1
"@Muaz BD Voice i appreciate for that!! I&#39;m also meitei/manipuri, in india meitei is not tribe n they r the only mongoloid community in india who r in general category just like 1.3 billion mainland Indian (general people).  Bangladeshi MANIPURI were migrated from manipur to bangladesh since 16th century AD due to wars between different kingdoms like Chinese(during Qing dynasty),muang dynasty(siam/thailand),mong kingdom, Burmese kingdom n so on. The original manipuri people r pure mongoloid migrated from central china(according to our written record history) but Bangladeshi manipuri r bit different from otiginal meitei/manipuri due to the further intermixed with bengali people since 14th century AD. They might be the first generation of bengali n meitei (intermixed) people who were move to bangladesh,assam , tripura,Myanmar,etc .(from manipur).<br />Much love from northern Europe (meitei/manipuri diaspora)💕",YANG LEE KEI,2021-02-26T13:28:40Z,4

"I m from India. This is our community who have settled long back ago due to the invasion from the Burmese as a result of infighting between King Sons for throne. Some of them capture as a prisoner of war by Burmese and got settled in Rangoon (Mandalay). During the period, the British were invited to overthrow the seven years of the devastation caused by the Burmese, which in turn defeated and capture the whole of Burma (Myanmar). The Burmese king was exiled to India. After a short period, the second world war started between the British and Japanese that ended near my place following the atomic bomb in Japan",Samarendra Ningthoujam,2021-01-30T13:00:04Z,36
