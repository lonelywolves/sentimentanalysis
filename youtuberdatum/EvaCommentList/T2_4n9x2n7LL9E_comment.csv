I love that you guys have been enjoying the Mongolia series so much ❤️It&#39;s one of my favourite places on the planet and I can&#39;t wait to visit again when it&#39;s safe to do so. Will definitely visit Zorigoo and his family again - maybe this time on horseback? 😂 Take care of yourselves! 🙏,Eva zu Beck,2020-08-01T17:53:57Z,369

"I visited this magnificent country twice,first in 2016,realizing an old dream with an agency,but  I came back in 2018,alone and organized it myself in UB, a car,a driver and a cook,to the&quot;far west&quot;,where Kazak people are living.Unforgettable!I hope to do it by horse <a href=""http://too.my/"">too.My</a> age 79.",emile593,2021-03-20T13:10:59Z,0
@Eva zu Beck  ... You surprised me once more... I did almost the same trek on a UAZ van a year ago... climbing the highest Gobi dunes and... on those cliffs...I was looking for the badlands site where  the first dinosaur nests were discovered around 1920s... The whole country is amazing... there are more  horses than people...  and any deals were solved with tugriks and vodka...  Really a place to come back,Luis ChirinoGálvez,2020-11-24T01:03:02Z,0

"I am a Saudi Muslim and I did not believe in my father&#39;s tradition. Rather, I have reasons for believing in Islam, see some of them:<br />The peoples of prophets demanded miracles or physical evidence that they were prophets<br />This is what happened with all the prophets, including the Prophet Muhammad, such as:<br />1. The miracles that the people of Mecca and Medina witnessed, and they are very numerous, such as the split of the moon .. and they are mentioned in the Qur’an and hadiths<br />@<br />You might say what evidence has already been achieved .. there is among the Arabs science  its name is the science of men (it means verifying the source of the news until reaching the Prophet Muhammad .. and the reliability of the men is tested and + the eloquence of the hadith texts is very eloquent (because the eloquence of the Prophet Muhammad is more eloquent than all the Arabs) + And did he actually meet the man who took the text from him ... and other precise conditions<br /><br />2. The many scientific miracles that the Qur’an proved 1400 years ago, and they are many .. And they have been proven in recent centuries, and many medical, geological and space scientists have embraced them because of these miracles.<br /><br />@<br />And it was the reason why many medical, geologists, and astronomers converted to Islam, including atheists, Christians, Buddhists, etc.<br /><br />You can contact the Scientific Miracles in the Qur’an and Sunnah Commission of the Muslim World League and see their research.<br /><br />3. Challenges of the Noble Qur’an for all humans and jinn<br /><br /> &gt;&gt;Such as challenging all jinn and people by writing a surah such as the rhetoric of the Qur’an + the challenge to protect it from distortion + the challenge of finding errors in the Qur’an etc.<br /><br />@<br />4- Knowledge of future news from the Qur’an and Sunnah, which are many and many of them have been fulfilled: such as the Prophet Muhammad’s news that Caliph Uthman will be killed and that the Arabs will conquer Levant, Persia, Egypt, etc. .. And these texts are many<br /><br />@<br />These are points from the sea of ​​many evidences in all the aforementioned matters and others as well, such as the good news of the advent of an end-time prophet in the Bible<br /><br />@<br />The answers to many secrets and questions about the cause of life and the creation of man .. and the evidence for the existence of God .. in Surat Al-Rahman<br /><br />@<br />A people of the jinn listened to the Qur’an from the Prophet Muhammad while he was praying the Qiyam prayer, and believed directly from it after his departure from Taif.<br /><br />@<br />Denying the message of Islam is nothing new<br /><br />@<br />An atheist, of course, has the right to search for material evidence that Islam is a right .. We have a lot, but you must strive to read.<br /><br /><br /><br />Sorry if there are any language errors .. because I am using Google Translate.<br /><br />A gift to my atheist brothers<br /><br />@<br />My atheist brothers I wish you lasting happiness، Islam is a very beautiful religion, you will live in peace and spirituality, and Islam will organize your life and make you know your rights and duties towards yourself, your family and your society ..

I must say even as a Mongolian man in my 30s I would not go on an adventure like yourself, and I&#39;m astonished at how brave and risk seeking your trips are. They also serve to motivate me to go out and explore my country more, because I think &quot;if this woman from an another continent is traveling in the wilderness alone, how bad could it really be for me?&quot; <br />Oh and btw, that latrine is as squeaky clean as it gets by local standards.

"Thank you for sharing this video, really enjoyed watching. I know part of adventure is getting lost and asking for directions, but you should look into downloading offline maps, like HERE or similar apps. Also, dropping air pressures down to 25-20 psi on dirt roads will help with comfort, but don&#39;t forget to air them back up once you hit the tarmac (you need a small 12v air compressor.)<br /><br />Btw you take really nice drone shots, which drone are you using? Do you need a permit in Mongolia to film using drone (especially in the city)?",NurbekProductions,2020-08-07T00:54:21Z,0

"Wow, great video on Mongolia! It’s one of my favorite places in the world to visit. Each time I go, I feel the visit isn’t long enough to see the places I want to visit. You were quite brave to take that drive by yourself but that is what an adventure is about. On one of my visits, we traveled through 14 provinces in a week. It was a lot of time in a vehicle and much like you some of those roads make for a slow trip. My wife is Mongolian and I’m from Jamaica, quite a difference in our home country however, there is just so much to see in Mongolia, that I keep going back.  I look forward to seeing more of your videos from here. Thanks for the video.",waynerm002,2020-08-03T01:53:44Z,3

You&#39;re a terrific cinematographer.. Its easy to be a Vlogger and sit behind a desk blabbing.. You on the other hand have a lot of guts and are in a real-life adventure with a lot of risk, limited reward, and taking the time to bring us along with your artistry and craft:  film-making..

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n9x2n7LL9E&amp;t=7m52s"">7:52</a> White Stupa. Unique structure of rock formation. Texture and color of the Stupa makes you feel like it&#39;s kinda different planet. Closer to Mars. People say that once in a time there was a ocean there and it left that unique structure behind.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n9x2n7LL9E&amp;t=9m04s"">9:04</a> Flaming cliff. The reason why it called flaming is when sunlight specially when sunsets and rises it makes cliffs look like it&#39;s burning. In addition, this place is one of the home country of dinosaurs in the world.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n9x2n7LL9E&amp;t=16m55s"">16:55</a> Khongor sand dune is a special place. You can witness 3 different landscapes in 1. Mountain, desert and green valley during summer. In winter it&#39;s even more dramatic. Can you imagine Snow at the sand dunes ? yeah this is the only place i believe.<br />Watching sunrise or sunset at the highest point of the dunes is something you have to witness as well.<br /><br />And  about tobacco it&#39;s just a welcome gesture. Please don&#39;t get wrong it&#39;s not a drug based thing.<br /><br />About food as she said it&#39;s better to visit country before you going on vegetarian hehe.<br /><br />Storytelling, filming and exploring alone and come up with such a great content it&#39;s just unbelievable.<br />Honestly this channel deserves millions of views. <br />Special thanks from fellow Mongolian.",Ben bt,2020-08-02T02:05:37Z,0

"I love your videos , your video from Alepo was the first i saw and it hit me soo hard. I was born in country wich was bombed in 99&#39; so that video was reletable to me. Since then i watched all your videos , from Pakistan , Nepal, every single one and i can tell you, i dont usualy comment any videos but you are my favorite traveler and great presenter. Thank you for respecting places you visit , many people forget about that. Stay safe and all best for you in your next adventures.",Stefan Vasic,2020-08-01T22:24:10Z,1

"This is fascinating. I don&#39;t know how you get in touch with these people when you plan your trips, how you finance it, how you organise everything, how you find it normal to just explore and go about your life in a lost weird town in the middle of a remote country (well, remote for us, as you pointed out… but still). I don&#39;t know how you do it, but It&#39;s fascinating. And the video itself is astonishing; not just the views, but the editing and voice over too. So, thank you for bringing this to the world. In my eyes, you make a real difference by shining a light on parts and people of the world that many of us will never get to see or meet.

"Most people who travel to Mongolia are not that adventurous like you. They don&#39;t explore and experience the real Mongolian wilderness like you did. They just go certain tourist spots that their travel agency recommended to them. But you were different. You didn&#39;t try to compare or conclude anything about Mongolia. What you did was just experience and enjoy its different beauty without any judgement and I really loved that about your videos. And your perspective and attitude on this content is so amazing, and everything about this video was beautiful. As a Mongolian I&#39;m so glad that you enjoyed my country.  I wish you have a lot of wonderful travels like this in the future.",Zaya Salmin,2020-08-01T19:58:20Z,264
"@Elcano Yes and No... cause it&#39;s  easy for us but for foreigners It&#39;s hard to say 100% Yes. Well,.. If you have certain experiences of extreme traveling in the wild nature, may be you can. But there&#39;s always certain risks, cause it&#39;s  too big land and not so much people in there. You need to research about it before you go and learn its language lil bit. And have some Mongolian friend who can help you to find affordable rent car or whatever thing you need. 🙂",Zaya Salmin,2021-03-24T13:48:12Z,0
