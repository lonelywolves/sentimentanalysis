"I think it’s highly irresponsible for people with platforms to be promoting travel right now. You are encouraging reckless behavior which can cost human lives.<br /><br />If you’re traveling to a place where there is a risk that you’ll introduce disease and where the local people do not have immunity, you are doing something unethical.  How do you really know if the virus is not on Socotra? How many were tested? Were you tested? You are young and could be asymptomatic. Its clear Yemen&#39;s healthcare system could not handle an outbreak. How painful would it be to look back on these photos/videos, unsure if you played a role in spreading a deadly disease to this precious community. There is a long history of western explorers doing this to indigenous people. <br /><br />Please ask yourself, did you stay out of safety, or ego? These photos and your giddiness seem like a romantic story to boost your likes and followers. Sight-seeing with local fisherman is not &quot;quarantine&quot;. Choosing to miss a flight is not &quot;getting stuck&quot;. Its playing with fire.<br /><br />While the rest of the world stays indoors, putting community above self, to protect one another, you do the opposite.  I urge you reevaluate your responsibility as an influencer, and your actions at this time.",momonala,2020-03-26T22:31:52Z,1

Caves have been used as burial places for thousands of years and once people started farming and living in permanent settlements they would bury their dead within the house under the floor. In some instances even in the corners of the dwelling over the centuries the practices of burying the dead have changed however in some parts of the world it remains unchanged.<br />What you see there is a ritual of burial that our far distant ancestors laid their loved ones to rest 👍,Mick Angelhere's World,2020-03-26T05:26:17Z,0

Please don&#39;t do risky things any insect or reptile can come out and Bite you. I don&#39;t think you have any first aid kit or any help in nearby. You can end up risking your life. When you are going to caves atleast cover your whole body.,hashim,2020-03-25T12:07:59Z,0

You don&#39;t know what caused their death and I don&#39;t think its good idea to touch anything in that cave cuz they may have died to some crazy disease and gov decided to bury them in this remote place for good to stop that disease from spreading.I don&#39;t know about you guys but it sure look like mass grave to me,ALPHA GHOST,2020-03-25T12:05:31Z,3

"One should be modest as the local people would not have watched the way the world is now only donning Western attire.  Yes, Eva is respectful and it suits her - the covering of the head like the locals would do in that country.",C,2020-03-25T19:08:50Z,0
"@Christine ODonnell She is in a secluded island, too far away from the eyes of muslims. I bet when she goes to the town proper of the main island she wears loose clothing like she always do",Maria Parreb,2020-03-25T15:05:13Z,4
she does...but surprising in a traditional Muslim country she is wearing a  not loose tshirt.. I traveled in Yemen and only wore loose flowing clothes.,Christine ODonnell,2020-03-25T14:07:46Z,1
Maybe the people living there used to dispose the disease by putting the dead bodies in the cave,Hania Mariam,2020-03-25T12:03:08Z,50
