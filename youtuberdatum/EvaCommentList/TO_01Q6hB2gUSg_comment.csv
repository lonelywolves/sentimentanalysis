"Soon I think you have change the title I guess. Skardu, Gilgit Baltistan, Union territory of India.",raja,2019-08-27T12:38:02Z,1
"@raja stupid ass face, what rightful entitlement do India possess to stake a claim to what you call &quot;POK&quot;? The regional monarchies rebelled against your alleged &quot;Maharaja&quot; and his arbitrary and unilateral decision to accede to the Dominion of India, voluntary militia bands were formed by WW2 veterans in the region to fight and stall the Indian military presence, the Azad Kashmir Regiment is the only regiment in the world which literally raised itself from scratch. The sub national monarchies declared their independence from the princely state, the people welcomed Pakistan as their liberator with open hands. Neither was the region represented in your constituent assembly or ever voted for your assembly. Even the &quot;Maharaja&quot; was not a monarch in the real sense, the man literally boot licked the company to get the Kashmir region on a annual lease for 75 lakhs in 1846 via The Treaty of Amritsar. Once the Indian Independence Act of 1947 was enforced and the lapse of paramountcy was effectuated all the agreements between the princely states and the british empire (and the company) were rendered annulled. As a result Maharaja Hari Singh was inherently not entitled to pass of Kashmir as his boot licking father&#39;s personal property. Your hypocrisy is exposed when you acknowledge the revolt of the regional monarchies against the Nawab of Junagadh&#39;s instrument of accession but turn a blind eye to the rebellion of the regional monarchies in Kashmir. India isn&#39;t even entitled legally to even a iota of Kashmiri land which is actively administered by Pakistan.",Imran,2019-09-26T14:58:20Z,1

"Girl remember you were in the middle of the ancient ocean research the name yourself. I will not say it. And those sands are from that ocean. You will not believe me until you get to see one of the last remaining residue of water from that ocean in the middle of the same mountain. At first your logical mind won&#39;t grasp anything in such places you will just be mesmerized and be in awe. Only spirituality can reveal to you the real secret. Religions will fall like a pack of cards there, only the reality and your primal nature holds the key. So I hope now you have some idea about what you saw. Only a handful people in the entire Asia knows our real past. Actually no one cares. Only people like you do. I can tell you about the birth of each and every stone and plants and water out there. But it&#39;s for another time. God bless you.",S Basu,2019-08-17T08:11:23Z,0

Hey Eva .. Pakistan is very beautiful and deserves international recognition for tourism.. love from India.. but u should definitely visit Indian himalayas region (moreover 60% himalayas is in India)and it is equally beautiful beautiful as that of pakistan.. Hunza and Skardu looks so similar to Ladakh and spiti and even if mustang of nepal looks exactly like Gilgit and baltistan region. would love to see your vlogs from indian himalayas..

In the South of the country you will actually find some people who still practice Trevada Buddhism as Sindh was once a Buddhist stronghold.<br />In the central part of the country you’ll probably see the remainings of Buddhist king Ashoka’s rule .<br />In the North of the country ( like the one Eva just showed ) people used to practice Tibetan Buddhism ( Vajrayana Buddhism) , we ( Baltis ) are quite a mixture of Tibetan and South Asian people, our ancestors converted about 400-500 years ago",sajid Asad,2019-08-03T03:32:33Z,2

"Hello eva i am from leh ladakh India and it has same landscape as GILGIT BALTISTAN . It is also beautiful , rich in culture and traditions . Most of the people are BUDDHIST but large no of muslims also . And i forget to mention that it has also balti people in NUBRA VALLEY of  turtuk , bogdang etc villages which were earlier part of pakistan . Nubra valley is famous for its BACTRIAN CAMEL which is only found in Nubra Valley in entire India . PANGONG and TSOMORIRI are salt lake at very high altitude in  CHANGTHANG which is about 200 kms away from leh town . CHADAR trek is famous for trekkers around the world . Leh town has good market for tourist to buy pashmina at reasonable price . Here people are very friendly , one thing that it differentiate from ladakh is that GILGIT BALTISTAN is untouched from the world . Ladakh has progressed  rapidly in past few decades due to tourism . You must visit once LADAKH in ur life .",Amir Hamza Mir,2019-05-03T16:30:04Z,0

"Just to request to change your title of the video from &quot;northern area&quot; to  Gilgit-Baltistan, which is its official and historical name. &#39;Northern area&#39; is misleading. Due to the use of this word &#39;Northern area&#39;  , by International media during the &#39;war on terror from 2005-2013&#39; , we lost a lot of tourists for many years during the conflict in northern areas of Pakistan such as Swat, FATA area. People of other countries though, the conflict was in GB, but it was not. And according to the Pakistani constitution and international law, GB is not part of Pakistan. GB people yet to decide.

Well if you guys are looking for real beauty, then must drive over Deosai plains to visit Astore valley and surroundings. Believe me, the landscape and colors are surreal. Minimerg, Rainvow lake and view of Astore valley between Jun and Jul are awesome. When back in Skardu, Dont miss to visit Khaplo Fort and Drive along Indus River with breath taking and majestic beauty of mountains deserving more then a gaze. I ll try posting the videos next time.

"Few places you left in skardu are <br />1- souq valley - and that’s shocking because you visited upper and lower kachura and souq valley is somewhere really near that . I visited it the same day when I did the other 2 <br />2 - sheosar lake - this was near deosai plane and you should have visited it too . <br />3- satpara lake - I guess it was some distance away from shigar fort <br />4- shangrila resort - that’s an expensive place to stay but not that expensive to visit and it’s really pretty so it’s worth going . <br /><br />If you go back to skardu please visit them <br />And one thing more , people of hunza are hospitable but people of skardu are even more hospitable then them .",Layiba Masroor,2019-04-21T15:31:43Z,0

They should get Pakistani people to promote their own country and I say this as a British Pakistani. Imran Khan says we need to get rid of the colonial mindset but this is just another part of it. It&#39;s great foreigners are visiting Pakistan and tourism is growing but there are so many of our own people who can do this job better as it is their own country at the end of the day and we don&#39;t need to constantly hire help from white people to do this.

you have to think very deeply. She is very expensive. the most important point is that she is very very old. Google history of Eva. you will find she was the first woman on earth. She got married to Adam. you have to check public records to make sure whether she is still married. Pakistani family laws do not allow a second husband. In short you do not want to marry a great grandmother,mianbh,2019-04-19T14:53:31Z,0

When it&#39;s revived, the road will be built, then foreign tourism will flow too. So let&#39;s do this together. <br /><br />And let&#39;s start a no littering campaign. Police the ones that throw garbage on the streets or other places. If you see garbage please pick it up and put it in a bin. That&#39;s what I do.",Planes and Stuff,2019-04-19T13:51:42Z,7

Skardu could be whole lot better tourist destination if road infrastructure to this amazing place could connect with rest of the national roadways enable more people to travel. Gov&#39;t should consider adding more airlines serving skardu in order to make air travel more affordable for tourists. There&#39;s a huge potential for tourism in these current remote northern areas but not being realized due to lack of resources for infrastructure, planning etc. <br />Thanks for sharing this nice video with world.

"Skardu  is a city in Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan, and serves as the capital of Skardu District. Skardu is located in the 10 kilometres (6 miles) wide by 40 kilometres (25 miles) long Skardu Valley, at the confluence of the Indus and Shigar Rivers at an elevation of nearly 2,500 metres (8,202 feet). The city is an important gateway to the eight-thousanders of the nearby Karakoram Mountain range. The town is located on the Indus river, which separates the Karakoram Range from the Himalayas.",Unknown,2019-04-19T12:56:02Z,1

@Muhammad Mubashir In fact Pakistan is so rich that it is helping poor China by investing in it&#39;s country (CPEC) by investing more than $60 Billion.
