Well you certainly becoming one of the locals and it is a great experience for you learning how to live with bare basics of life the sad thing about the consumeristic society we live in today we lost sight of what is really important in life. Also as more and more people live in big cities they lose touch with the reality of where their food comes from and what it looked like before it hits the supermarket shelves. I’ve worked on farms and a cattle station we had chickens and a vegetable garden in the suburb of Sydney where I grew up as most people had vegetable gardens back then . Now not many people have vegetables also governments around Australia seemed determined to turn Australia into apartmenville these last few years 👍👍,Mick Angelhere's World,2020-04-26T03:23:03Z,0

"Hi, Eva why did you have to show us the cooked fish! We would&#39;ve understood you are going to cook it. I&#39;m saying that because I just had my lunch and suddenly that cooked fish has made me hungry again😬😭. By the way, Nice vlog. Keep up the good work &amp; stay safe.",mateen haq,2020-04-19T11:20:45Z,0
