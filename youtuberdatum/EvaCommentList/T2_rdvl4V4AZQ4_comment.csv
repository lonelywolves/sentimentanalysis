This gorgeous girl lives her life to the fullest. Nothing can better describe a living full of life than adventurism around the world.

When I came from Afghanistan to Europe I had passed harder situations then this in several forests with out even a tent 😕<br />I saw your videos you have all facilities when you want to go or stay somewhere but you have nothing when you came from Afghanistan to Europe all the things you have is a coat and gloves just ordinary travelling supplies.<br />When I saw this video I had remembered my past 5 years ago.<br />Bravo keeped up 👌,Z Yaqubi,2021-04-10T02:25:10Z,0

"I started watching a few of your vlogs after your cycle across Poland. <br /><br />You appeared strong and yet fragile a little vulnerable. <br /><br />This for me was interesting if, a little over produced and somewhat spoilt by the music. <br /><br />I also found your promotion to be longer than the test. <br /><br />It don’t feel genuine so I never shared your experience. I wild camp regularly and never use a tent. I love the sensations of the forest when it comes alive. <br /><br />Talk about “you” in the first person. We can identify with how your feeling and share your happiness, fears etc. <br /><br />When you speak in the “third”person, this is lost.",Rob The Yorkshireman,2021-03-13T06:16:15Z,0
"I use to be a wildlife biologist. I’ve had to camp alone a lot in scary places. I remember the coyotes on one trip in Northern New Mexico really bothered me on one solo trip. Lightning every night in Wyoming was the scariest, even scarier than the wolves and grizzlies. I’ve found that books have given me the strength to fall asleep. The Valley of the Horses, Parodical Summer, The Solace of Open Spaces. Stories of survival and strong women outdoors. Another trick, earplugs.

I did camp out with my youngest son who was sixteen at the time at Bear Lake. Guess what we heard all night?? Bears! I was so scared I didn’t sleep all night! He told me, “Mom, what did you expect? It’s called BEAR LAKE.” Lol He also forget to pack my tent...so I slept in the open all night. I fell asleep early in the morning about 3:00 am.",Elizette Nelson,2021-03-10T16:32:04Z,0

When you are in forest ... Its better not to make a sound before you hear a sound ... Its only inviting danger ... <br /><br />2nd thing is to create above ground to avoid intrusion ... <br /><br />3rd .. Keep your fire heat because most of animal is scared of smoke because its create a mind of fire ... <br /><br />4th ... Do not make too much move unless you need too <br /><br />5th ... Put some shulpur around to you sleeping ground <br /><br />6th ... The best sound is music and not song ... Because its syncronize the plant ... <br /><br />You face show you didnt get a sleep at all 😂😂😂😂,Sylvester Primus,2020-12-01T14:58:05Z,0

The Pacific Crest Trail sounds like your kinda challenge. The main thing I would have done differently was to cook my food farther away from my tent. Hikers often stop and cook before entering camp and then store their food at least 50 ft from their tent. It was good that your friend took the dinner dishes with him. Conquering our fears builds character and resilience. I love that you face them head on.,HikingforSanity,2020-11-26T14:17:40Z,0

"As a general rule you should not eat where you sleep. Keep at least 100 yds between them, keep your food suspended from a tree well off the ground. It&#39;s not just bears, any other wildlife will love to get into it as well. A fox attempted to run away with my mesh bag of cooking pots. It was way to heavy for him, but he gave it a good try. Then he stalked me most of that night keeping me awake. Racoons, possums, skunks (keep a large distance), it&#39;s a matter of survival for any creature out there.",Dalmaen,2020-11-10T16:09:32Z,0

"One day i went into a forest alone, was running into the forest looking for water fall. Went too deep then lost my track. Thick wood. Totally lost my way in the wood. Not sure which route to take. Did not broke the branches or keep record of the track. Made dangerously silly mistake. Then i start meditating to get out of the wood. I kept on reading Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi raji&#39;un “We surely belong to Allah and to Him we shall return”. Happened few years back. Kept on looking for a way out. Luckily, manage to saw a way out. Took a step out of the jungle trek and there was a fence. The safest always to mark the jungle track, there high chances people will go through the trek back. But, my instinct told me just told me to go off trek to find other possible way out. Cross a small river and need to go down of the fence to get back to civilization. Was lost for about 30 minutes in the jungle. Take necessary precaution when you go into forest, snakes can be there. The best advice do not go alone. Or find a local guide.",Eidul Ameen Sahul Hamid,2020-11-07T14:37:18Z,0

"I had a similar experience last year when I decided to spend the night at my family&#39;s old farmhouse in the middle of nowhere, just me, a kitten, the woods and the moon.<br /><br />At the beginning of the night, as the breeze started, I was so confused because the wind made so many strange sounds, I heard sounds like voices or animals growling, I think the mind tries to make sense of every thing, every little strange situation appears to threaten you. So I was afraid. <br /><br />But then, the moon got higher as I tried to meditate on the balcony and I decided to walk into the night, as the moonlight illuminated the hills. The kitten followed me the whole way. Suddenly I was comfortable, even with different sounds and dense vegetation, I even took a bath in the nearby lake ...<br /><br />I think there&#39;s a point in which you become part of the forest, so it cannot hurt you, and you understand that there is no evil but the mind.",Pedro M.,2020-11-07T01:35:16Z,6

"I must admit that your fears are to me quite weird and irrational, yet I can understand them. I have been alone overnight in woods many times, but only fearsome thing is cold or dampness. First thing - you must know local nature,  <br />its animals and their behavior and sounds, sounds of birds at night. For example the barking of roe deer can be very frightening at first. Bear is avoiding humans, attacks only when you are between her and her cubs or wounded. Wolves, lynxes and wild boards are avoiding humans as much as they can. Who else can be so terrifying? Forest is pleasant and peaceful place to be, even at night, only some knowledges are needed. Like that you tried it and hopefully you will overcome your fears and reestablish natural connection with Nature.",Mart Maameele,2020-11-04T21:00:23Z,0

"Always luv your journey. When you are alone in that forest, you fear for your self. Fear originates from various sources. When we are young, we fear old age. When we are full of vigour and beauty, we fear debility  and loss of our youthful looks. When we are healthy, we fear disease and suffering. When we enjoy a good reputation, we fear ignominy. When we face family problems, we fear a break-up among siblings or with spouse or children. We fear the loss of our loved ones. We fear pain- emotional as well as physical. And finally, we fear not having enough to be self reliant and losing our dignity because we have to depend upon others for our needs. All these fears are destructive. Life takes its own course and there is little you can do to predict coming events. The only way you can handle the future is to take care of the present. Fear is a negative quality, which generates insecurity and therefore must be actively addressed whenever it eclipse your mind. Work hard to dispel all your fears  and make everyone feel secure in your company.",Armando Soriano,2020-11-03T03:15:46Z,2

Late at night in the dark I&#39;ve thought I&#39;ve heard bears around my tent, so poked my head out with a flashlight and it was a racoon.  Your mind does enlarge the fear.  Also, not to be offensive but as great as your pasta was, your marshmellow technique needs some work.  You should only cook them over red hot coals, never flame.

It&#39;s also a great self defense tool against minacious predators if you are going to forests and wild places. It&#39;s light, convenient and super useful.

"I&#39;ve noticed several serious mistakes that are often dangerous and inconvenient. First is cooking foods that are very odorous. Cooking food like garlic, onions etc can attract animals from several kilometres away, and those odors often linger on oneself and clothing for hours. Pre-cooking them then packing them in plastic bags to reheat later is much safer. Also two fires were needed. One to cook and one for light and heat. A miniature stove would likely weigh less than the garlic press and other likely things. Thus collecting wood for cooking in daylight is senseless. There is very few things to be frightend about in a forest other than ones naivety or carelessness. I&#39;ve been camping safely alone in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and it&#39;s foothills for more than 40 years.",Mike Duckworth,2020-11-02T06:50:34Z,156
@Elizette Nelson It&#39;s that attractant that has concerned me and other researchers. How far away does an attractant have to be to keep people safe? We all know that animals can smell odors many miles away. If you have hung your food far away in scent containing bags and containers to keep you and other beings safe I thank you.,Mike Duckworth,2021-03-12T07:00:18Z,0
@Mike Duckworth you do not hang it over your campsite. You hang it away from your campsite. It would be stupid to do that. I’ve camped a lot and hiked  that’s how we have done it.,Elizette Nelson,2021-03-11T16:34:08Z,2
@Elizette Nelson I am aware of vehicles that have been destroyed by bears. The most important thing is to reduce scents. I keep my vehicle interior very clean and use containers that are designed to contain odors. Hanging bear bait over my campsite does not make sense.,Mike Duckworth,2021-03-11T06:56:04Z,2
@Mike Duckworth in your vehicle? Not up here. The bears ripped your car door off. It’s ro he stored up high about 30-50 feet like you stated. I’ve camped many times with family up in the Sierra Mountains.,Elizette Nelson,2021-03-10T16:51:24Z,2

"My first solo night in the Rockies was nerve wracking!   I was hiking in off season so the only person I saw that day was going the other way.  Saw bear scat and prints all day.  I went to sleep as soon as it was dark.   When I woke in the middle of the night it was so dark my flashlight beam was all that I could see it felt like looking out of a hood.   Then I walked into the nearby meadow and looked up at a clear mountain night sky and saw the milky way in all its glory, exponentially brighter than I had ever seen it before.  Most scary and most amazing moment of my life.",Paul McLeod,2020-11-02T03:10:09Z,0

First rule of camping in forests never never never pitch your tent under a leaning tree there is a reason they call them widow makers and if your worried about dangerous animals keep your fire lit they are less likely to go near a fire.

Eva has a lot of videos meeting other people, even in Romania, if you look for it. But due to the pandemic situation, it&#39;s very reasonable that she is not with other people all the time. But in anyways, ecotourism is very popular and people can like different things and different ways of traveling. I find these videos absolutely inspiring and I hope to have my own adventures in the future. Also, traveling can always be about connecting with yourself too!",Letícia Miyashiro,2020-11-01T22:33:57Z,2

"I got lost in the woods for 2 days in the winter (literally Christmas Day is when I got lost) when I was a kid. Absolutely terrifying! I went out for a hike on my family’s land and was following a trail, or so I thought. Apparently the trail I was supposed to be following overgrew so it looked like I was still on the right path but I definitely wasn’t. I remember walking and walking (i know you’re supposed to stay put when you get lost but it was WAY too cold and I was not dressed for it) and I came across another path. It had a big frozen puddle so I figured if I just followed that path I’d eventually make my way out. 2 hours of walking and I ended up back at the same puddle. I knew I was screwed when that happened. They had the military looking for me 😳 I’m just thankful I was found. I still live in the woods and am surrounded by forests and I love it. I know a lot more now about how to survive than I did when I was a kid! (Especially because I know how easy it is to get lost by complete accident even on land you know and grew up on!)",Meghan Lora,2020-11-01T17:18:31Z,66

"The woods can creep me out, too, even the forests behind my childhood home, where I&#39;ve been possibly a hundred times and I know for sure there&#39;s no dangerous animals. There&#39;s just something about looking out into the darkness, hearing the occassional sound and not knowing what or who made it, and feeling so exposed and vulnerable that gets to me. I guess it&#39;s some basic human instinct.",Midgard Eagle,2020-11-01T17:15:31Z,1
Part of that fear is just encountering some crazy people in the forest. Or else which is unlikely some escaped dangerous animals. I&#39;m on an island and in the jungle here there are no dangerous animals. However when hiking its still scary sometimes. Spending a night in the jungle would be much more scary. The other part of the fear comes from the paranormal phenomenon that takes place in the woods and your lack of confidence of dealing with in the case you encounter that. But meeting some crazy people while alone in the forest is one of the main fears.,Dream TheDream89,2020-11-01T19:34:13Z,1

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdvl4V4AZQ4&amp;t=5m12s"">5:12</a> That is not a forest. That is a park. Where are all the crowded together trees and the thick undergrowth? One of the things that I am thankful for when I was in the army was learning not to be afraid of wild forests in the dark. But I live in Australia so we don&#39;t have to worry about bears or oversized felines of various types. We only have a hundred other things trying to kill you. You even have a phone with coverage. Most of the places I went were out of range so if I had an accident and broke a leg I would be on my own. I always had to be super careful. Now I wish this stupid covid lockdown was over and I could go and camp in a dark forest all alone again. The feeling of inner peace when I am in the middle of wild nature is wonderful.<br />You should never use your drinking water to put out a fire. You may need it for drinking if you get lost of stuck. Just thrown some dirt over the fire to put it out. I know this time you are expecting a rescuer at 8am but what if he has an accident and cannot come for you. You will have to walk out and then you will need all the water you are carrying.<br />Also try not to use your phone in case you need to make an emergency call. You don&#39;t want a flat battery when you might need the phone the most.<br />Most noises at night will be nocturnal animals, usually small ones but that depends on what forest you are in. I remember one morning I woke at just before dawn and heard all these noises outside my little tent. I carefully opened the flap and there were 4 beautiful brumbies grazing outside. Brumbies are wild horses in Australia. They were so beautiful and I managed one poor quality photo before they got spooked by me and vanished into the trees. That was a magic moment. Most animals are beautiful and will not harm you if you are not a threat to them.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdvl4V4AZQ4&amp;t=17m40s"">17:40</a> I had to laugh. You have a garlic press and all those other utensils for cooking but use a stick to stir your drink. Cute. :)<br />This looked like somewhere in Europe. Where was your camping spot?<br />I love your videos. You are such a beautiful and happy person. Congratulations on overcoming your fear of the dark forest. You are a brave lady. &lt;3",Dexxter,2020-11-01T15:18:02Z,0

How else thinks this a joke of video? <br />What a content,tarmacsub,2020-11-01T14:34:39Z,1
One of the best things anyone can do before camping in a forest is to familiarize themselves with the sounds of local animals (you can find lots of videos on YouTube).  Here in the UK we have deer that bark and roar or vixen (female fox) that make a sound like a woman screaming as if being attacked. If you are not familiar with such sounds it can be scary - but once you sleep alone a few times you soon get used to all those sounds and more. It is simply the darkness that plays tricks with our minds - as the forest at night is still the same forest we see in the day - except for wildlife that likes to come out at night.,Sand Da Floor,2020-11-01T14:34:18Z,33
