The second thing is that statue is made by humans they can&#39;t even take care of them selfs how you think it will protect you or take care of you. I&#39;m not here to be religious but it doesn&#39;t make sense to worship that things that you can see or you can touch, do you guys think that God is like a human, no no no absolutely not on the top of the line there are 4 holy books and the last one is The Holy Qur&#39;an that explain each and everything in detail. (Ash-Haduallah Ilaha-Ilallah Wa Ash-Haduanna Muhammadan Abdahu Wa-Rasooluhu). Translation There is no God accept Allah Azzawajal and Muhammad P.B.U.H is his messenger. Al Qur&#39;an.

"This was really beautiful and makes me wish I could travel to get this very meaningful &amp; spiritual tattoo. <br />Not sure if this is true or not but I was told and read that monks aren’t allowed to touch women without having to do a cleanse after or wear gloves at least to protect themselves. That’s why most say no to tattooing women (so it said online). In fact women aren’t allowed to get tattooed in the actual temple but a small house next to the temple because it could distract the other monks and make them feel impure thoughts. You must also wear appropriate and covered clothing (obviously something respectful and not showing too much skin). If anyone knows if this is true or not please comment in response so we all can be understanding, aware and prepared for those of us wanting to get one done.",Samantha Almaguer,2020-05-17T04:40:39Z,1
"Everything you&#39;ve posted was completely true. Theravada monks (Thai monks) are not permitted to touch women at all.  Every woman entering Thai temples are asked to cover up as much as possible. Not for just respect to yourself, but for others including the monks.  Since monks are prohibited from any mental or physical sexual activities, anything that will entice them to think or feel that need is to be avoided.",AP,2020-07-13T20:02:50Z,0

"I was like you believe in new age religion that energy of love is holding us and false spirituality <br /><br />The problem is not in the meditation. But, the symbols and chants that the guru want you to repeat and believe in their power.<br /><br />I used to have a big collection of crystals and scared stones and all kind of magical symbols with good energy.<br /><br />I started to attach my self and heart to the energy of universe. And, learned how to do magic and even influence other people energy and thoughts. Not in a weird way but as mental power.<br /><br />I used to give big respects to the energies and being around me each one has it is own chartacterstces. Until, I started to feel big void and the good feelings is not coming easily anymore and I felt The need to call the energy being more and more.<br /><br />Literally they started to consume my body and felt extreme pain in back &amp; head extreme tiredness and depression and fear from the unknown.<br /><br />Until, someone from my family noticed my situation and when I give him more information about me he told me you are under magic spell and he was expert in this subject.<br />The spell were consuming my body and I either die or serve the being.<br /><br />When I started healing myself from the magic spell and my energy practices. I felt so much ease. It is like I just wake up from an illusion that destroyed  my health and my family.<br /><br />You don’t need to believe in thing that you don’t understand just because people telling so.<br /><br />Since, I know that world let me tell you the beings love naive people with positive energy which lack love and  most vulnerable to love feelings they can be fooled easier and like to numb themselves to life.<br /><br />Peace ✌️",Naif Al-Baloushi,2020-03-15T18:52:22Z,3

Sister eva stay away from shirk.,Abdulkhaliq Mohamed,2020-03-15T05:52:34Z,1
"Eva...as you had mentioned of stress, I have what hopefully is a wonderful chapter on that topic in my upcoming book on reversing heart disease. <br /><br />I think of stress as &quot;kryptonite&quot;, in that all of us should minimize our exposure,  or what we choose to allow to enter into our being. This is very damaging, as stress actually is corrosive to our arteries and internal organs, and of course can weigh very heavy on our emotional state. <br /><br />A great thought is not to get upset or frustrated about what one can&#39;t control. In your case that could be a multitude of things involved with travel, from setting up a trip or a trek, to delayed flights, lost luggage, a camel that doesn&#39;t want to behave, and of getting from point a to b, and then from b to c, and subsequently to d and e, without any delays, and no technical issues with your work. Now likely, the corona virus is on that list.<br /><br />So, with all of that stuff, the best thing is to let it flow like water off a ducks back. Don&#39;t let it get into your gut so you wind up tromping around Pakistan looking for some Tums. You accept all of that and more as a part of your life, and know that the important thing is whatever the circumstances, you will put forth your best efforts. Then, no matter the result, you can accept that you put out your best.<br /><br />If things didn&#39;t work out as you desired, then don&#39;t get stressed out from what happened, as you can&#39;t go back in time to fix things, but you can move forward with a good spirit, knowing that another day brings a new set of opportunities. <br /><br />Some days our best is absolutely brilliant, and other days it totally sucks, but whatever it is, we must be good with that, and not beat ourselves up over what we can&#39;t control.<br /><br />Other things that you can&#39;t control are people. You seem to be an astonishingly polite, positive, and fun lady, but, I would venture that you might have more than few stories of those who weren&#39;t so well mannered. I guess that was the polite way of saying they acted like jackasses. <br /><br />As you know, don&#39;t internalize the bad experience, nor give anybody free rent in your mind by retelling of how awful that person was to your friends and family, as each rendition adds another layer of stress that you are carrying around.  One may not know the circumstances another is dealing with, which doesn&#39;t excuse their behavior, but merely recognize they have some issues,  forgive them, and pray for their well being. That you likely do. <br /><br />Only get upset for the really, really important stuff. As far as relationships, you likely know that your happiness shouldn&#39;t be dependent upon whether somebody in your life is behaving with love and consideration or acting like a jerk. <br /><br />Only have good, caring, and positive people in your life, and minimize the time you spend with those who would drain your energy due to their unresolved issues.<br /><br />My dear, I have enjoyed your videos and learned quite a bit, and wish I could have eaten a lot of the food that you did. You are an amazingly intelligent woman, and quite a trailblazer. <br /><br />The words I leave you with come from my favorite quote, which is to &quot;Follow your dreams, and enjoy the trip&quot;. Which in your case would be to enjoy countless trips that take you all over the world. <br /><br />BTW.....that was quite a marathon in the heat, lots of respect for that. I ran my 25th marathon last November. If your travels ever take you to Las Vegas, do let me know, and I would be happy to take you on a run at Red Rock Canyon or Mt. Charleston...that have some truly spectacular trails. <br /><br />Lots of good wishes for you. Stay healthy and strong, and enjoy the life you are living.",Randy Lazer,2020-03-15T05:50:41Z,1

I am secular in my approach and find this as a culture not any spiritual healing or religion at all.",Shakil Ahmad,2020-03-14T15:15:56Z,0

Just be careful on corona and skin infections caused by tattos.  Do u actually believe it works.  As per Holy Bible and Holy Quran we are not suppose to put any markings upon our body.  Anyway its upto u on what you believe in.  I get peace when i pray alone silently kneeling down in my bed room with nobody seeing me. Have a personal relationship with the Lord.

Now you are consumed by Satan&#39;s lie...he likes to give people what sounds nice and &#39;&#39;acceptable&#39;&#39; but is not truth. You need to know Gods words otherwise you will remain fooled puppet who will be destroyed at the end...there is God and there is satan..truth and lie...life and death....no in between, no flirting with satan because it feels and sounds nice and good!

"Tatoo to prymitywizm proletów - elity nie dają się tatuować. Psychoanalityk Erich Fromm zauważył w jego książce &quot;Sztuka Miłości&quot;, że elity, najbogatsi, najbardziej inteligentni, wykształceni, utalentowani nie noszą nawet ubrań z napisami, a co dopiero stałych tatuaży. Tysiące lat temu, w stanie wpółzwierzęcym, 100% ówczesnych ludzi było wytatuowanych. Z czasem wyżej rozwinięci ludzie zaczęli nosić ozdoby, ale nie tatuaże, których nie można zmienić. Rozwijający się człowiek wie, że za ileś lat będzie częściowo kimś innym, lepszym, a wówczas podobać mu się będą inne ozdoby, inne ubrania, a tatuaże tylko zmywalne, które także można zmieniać. Tacy ludzie uwzględniają także, że stały tatuaż mógłby nie podobać sie kiedyś nie tylko im samym, ale i może uniemożliwić rozwijającą się miłość do kobiety lub mężczyzny. Kultury chrześcijańskie, czy judaizm, nie przewidują tatuaży, co dowodzi ich przewagi (lądowanie na Księżycu) nad relatywnym prymitywizmem buddyzmu (sklepiki z tatuażem dla społecznych nizin).",Piotr Kraczkowski,2020-03-14T13:52:07Z,0

"@Badbad Badley What Allah promises us is better than what this life has to offer. <br />كُنتُمۡ خَيۡرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخۡرِجَتۡ لِلنَّاسِ تَأۡمُرُونَ بِٱلۡمَعۡرُوفِ وَتَنۡهَوۡنَ عَنِ ٱلۡمُنكَرِ وَتُؤۡمِنُونَ بِٱللَّهِۗ وَلَوۡ ءَامَنَ أَهۡلُ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ لَكَانَ خَيۡرٗا لَّهُمۚ مِّنۡهُمُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنُونَ وَأَكۡثَرُهُمُ ٱلۡفَٰسِقُونَ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />You are the best community ever raised for humanity—you encourage good, forbid evil, and believe in Allah. Had the People of the Book believed, it would have been better for them. Some of them are faithful, but most are rebellious.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 110<br /><br />ٱلَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ فِي ٱلسَّرَّآءِ وَٱلضَّرَّآءِ وَٱلۡكَٰظِمِينَ ٱلۡغَيۡظَ وَٱلۡعَافِينَ عَنِ ٱلنَّاسِۗ وَٱللَّهُ يُحِبُّ ٱلۡمُحۡسِنِينَ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />˹They are˺ those who donate in prosperity and adversity, control their anger, and pardon others. And Allah loves the good-doers.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 134<br /><br />وَٱلَّذِينَ إِذَا فَعَلُواْ فَٰحِشَةً أَوۡ ظَلَمُوٓاْ أَنفُسَهُمۡ ذَكَرُواْ ٱللَّهَ فَٱسۡتَغۡفَرُواْ لِذُنُوبِهِمۡ وَمَن يَغۡفِرُ ٱلذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ وَلَمۡ يُصِرُّواْ عَلَىٰ مَا فَعَلُواْ وَهُمۡ يَعۡلَمُونَ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />˹They are˺ those who, upon committing an evil deed or wronging themselves, remember Allah and seek forgiveness and do not knowingly persist in sin—and who forgives sins except Allah?<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 135<br /><br />أُوْلَٰٓئِكَ جَزَآؤُهُم مَّغۡفِرَةٞ مِّن رَّبِّهِمۡ وَجَنَّٰتٞ تَجۡرِي مِن تَحۡتِهَا ٱلۡأَنۡهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَاۚ وَنِعۡمَ أَجۡرُ ٱلۡعَٰمِلِينَ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />Their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens under which rivers flow, staying there forever. How excellent is the reward for those who work ˹righteousness˺!<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 136<br /><br />قَدۡ خَلَتۡ مِن قَبۡلِكُمۡ سُنَنٞ فَسِيرُواْ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ فَٱنظُرُواْ كَيۡفَ كَانَ عَٰقِبَةُ ٱلۡمُكَذِّبِينَ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />Similar situations came to pass before you, so travel throughout the land and see the fate of the deniers.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 137<br /><br />هَٰذَا بَيَانٞ لِّلنَّاسِ وَهُدٗى وَمَوۡعِظَةٞ لِّلۡمُتَّقِينَ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />This is an insight to humanity—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 138<br /><br /><br /><br />وَلَا يَحۡزُنكَ ٱلَّذِينَ يُسَٰرِعُونَ فِي ٱلۡكُفۡرِۚ إِنَّهُمۡ لَن يَضُرُّواْ ٱللَّهَ شَيۡـٔٗاۚ يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ أَلَّا يَجۡعَلَ لَهُمۡ حَظّٗا فِي ٱلۡأٓخِرَةِۖ وَلَهُمۡ عَذَابٌ عَظِيمٌ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />˹O Prophet!˺ Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—surely they will not harm Allah in the least. It is Allah’s Will to disallow them a share in the Hereafter, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 176<br /><br />إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱشۡتَرَوُاْ ٱلۡكُفۡرَ بِٱلۡإِيمَٰنِ لَن يَضُرُّواْ ٱللَّهَ شَيۡـٔٗاۖ وَلَهُمۡ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٞ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />Those who trade belief for disbelief will never harm Allah in the least, and they will suffer a painful punishment.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 177<br /><br />وَلَا يَحۡسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوٓاْ أَنَّمَا نُمۡلِي لَهُمۡ خَيۡرٞ لِّأَنفُسِهِمۡۚ إِنَّمَا نُمۡلِي لَهُمۡ لِيَزۡدَادُوٓاْ إِثۡمٗاۖ وَلَهُمۡ عَذَابٞ مُّهِينٞ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />Those who disbelieve should not think that living longer is good for them. They are only given more time to increase in sin, and they will suffer a humiliating punishment.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 178<br /><br />مَّا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيَذَرَ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ عَلَىٰ مَآ أَنتُمۡ عَلَيۡهِ حَتَّىٰ يَمِيزَ ٱلۡخَبِيثَ مِنَ ٱلطَّيِّبِۗ وَمَا كَانَ ٱللَّهُ لِيُطۡلِعَكُمۡ عَلَى ٱلۡغَيۡبِ وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَجۡتَبِي مِن رُّسُلِهِۦ مَن يَشَآءُۖ فَـَٔامِنُواْ بِٱللَّهِ وَرُسُلِهِۦۚ وَإِن تُؤۡمِنُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَلَكُمۡ أَجۡرٌ عَظِيمٞ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />Allah would not leave the believers in the condition you were in, until He distinguished the good from the evil ˹among you˺. Nor would Allah ˹directly˺ reveal to you the unseen, but He chooses whoever He wills as a messenger. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And if you are faithful and mindful ˹of Allah˺, you will receive a great reward.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 179<br /><br />وَلَا يَحۡسَبَنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَبۡخَلُونَ بِمَآ ءَاتَىٰهُمُ ٱللَّهُ مِن فَضۡلِهِۦ هُوَ خَيۡرٗا لَّهُمۖ بَلۡ هُوَ شَرّٞ لَّهُمۡۖ سَيُطَوَّقُونَ مَا بَخِلُواْ بِهِۦ يَوۡمَ ٱلۡقِيَٰمَةِۗ وَلِلَّهِ مِيرَٰثُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِۗ وَٱللَّهُ بِمَا تَعۡمَلُونَ خَبِيرٞ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />And do not let those who ˹greedily˺ withhold Allah’s bounties think it is good for them—in fact, it is bad for them! They will be leashed ˹by their necks˺ on the Day of Judgment with whatever ˹wealth˺ they used to withhold. And Allah is the ˹sole˺ inheritor of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 180<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />۞لَتُبۡلَوُنَّ فِيٓ أَمۡوَٰلِكُمۡ وَأَنفُسِكُمۡ وَلَتَسۡمَعُنَّ مِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُواْ ٱلۡكِتَٰبَ مِن قَبۡلِكُمۡ وَمِنَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَشۡرَكُوٓاْ أَذٗى كَثِيرٗاۚ وَإِن تَصۡبِرُواْ وَتَتَّقُواْ فَإِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ مِنۡ عَزۡمِ ٱلۡأُمُورِ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />You ˹believers˺ will surely be tested in your wealth and yourselves, and you will certainly hear many hurtful words from those who were given the Scripture before you and ˹from˺ the polytheists. But if you are patient and mindful ˹of Allah˺—surely this is a resolve to aspire to.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 186<br /><br /><br />لَا يَغُرَّنَّكَ تَقَلُّبُ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُواْ فِي ٱلۡبِلَٰدِ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />Do not be deceived by the prosperity of the disbelievers throughout the land.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 196<br /><br />مَتَٰعٞ قَلِيلٞ ثُمَّ مَأۡوَىٰهُمۡ جَهَنَّمُۖ وَبِئۡسَ ٱلۡمِهَادُ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />It is only a brief enjoyment. Then Hell will be their home—what an evil place to rest!<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 197<br /><br />لَٰكِنِ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱتَّقَوۡاْ رَبَّهُمۡ لَهُمۡ جَنَّٰتٞ تَجۡرِي مِن تَحۡتِهَا ٱلۡأَنۡهَٰرُ خَٰلِدِينَ فِيهَا نُزُلٗا مِّنۡ عِندِ ٱللَّهِۗ وَمَا عِندَ ٱللَّهِ خَيۡرٞ لِّلۡأَبۡرَارِ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />But those who are mindful of their Lord will be in Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there forever—as an accommodation from Allah. And what is with Allah is best for the virtuous.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 198<br /><br />وَإِنَّ مِنۡ أَهۡلِ ٱلۡكِتَٰبِ لَمَن يُؤۡمِنُ بِٱللَّهِ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيۡكُمۡ وَمَآ أُنزِلَ إِلَيۡهِمۡ خَٰشِعِينَ لِلَّهِ لَا يَشۡتَرُونَ بِـَٔايَٰتِ ٱللَّهِ ثَمَنٗا قَلِيلًاۚ أُوْلَٰٓئِكَ لَهُمۡ أَجۡرُهُمۡ عِندَ رَبِّهِمۡۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلۡحِسَابِ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />Indeed, there are some among the People of the Book who truly believe in Allah and what has been revealed to you ˹believers˺ and what was revealed to them. They humble themselves before Allah—never trading Allah’s revelations for a fleeting gain. Their reward is with their Lord. Surely Allah is swift in reckoning.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 199<br /><br />يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ ٱصۡبِرُواْ وَصَابِرُواْ وَرَابِطُواْ وَٱتَّقُواْ ٱللَّهَ لَعَلَّكُمۡ تُفۡلِحُونَ<br /><br />(Dr. Mustafa Khattab)<br />O believers! Patiently endure, persevere, stand on guard, and be mindful of Allah, so you may be successful.<br /><br />-Sura Aal-E-Imran, Ayah 200",Aisha Abdi,2020-03-13T10:46:57Z,0

@John Ayala it will open a Spiritual portal that you can not close all kind of spirit evil or good can access. This is not normal tattoo it is encoded with certain message to the other dimensions. <br /><br />If bad energy access You will start feel tired and stressed all the time all because of the overwhelming energy it will bring.<br /><br />Don’t do similar things for fun.

Natural pure beauty only please. Resist the temptations to adopt one others fashion or customs and stay true to your family&#39;s traditional culture. Poles maintain the vanguard for Catholicism and are highly respected for this. Don&#39;t forget how much your people have endured and show your appreciation by staying pure and traditional and setting this example for your children.,Seinna Miller,2020-09-25T15:21:38Z,1
