I have a very hard time believing anyone could accidentally book a seat instead of a full sleeper compartment for a 4 day trip seeing how vastly different the prices for the two are. Come on now.

"The trick is to trat it like a hiking trip. You bring Mountain House or similar camper food. You can get hot water from the cafe. You bring a pouch of Dude Wipes to give yourself a daily sitzbath and then use your deoderant, toothbrush, etc. You also bring some no water shampoo - it&#39;s easy to find in most grocery or department stores. And the seets kick back to pretty close to flat, so instead of cramping sideways, you can lay out. The foot rests will support your feet to get you close to flat.

"I&#39;ve gone from SLC (near my home) to one of the little bumps in the road in Iowa to visit a friend (is it a visit if the friend was dying of cancer and the trip was to say goodbye?). The trip out is one of my fondest memories. The trip back is an absolute blurr. <br /><br />I&#39;ve also ridden the other direction, from SLC to Emeryville. Of the two I&#39;d say going from SLC to Denver, and really from Grand Junction to Denver is the best part of the trip. It was late October, and the autumn leaves were just past their prime. It was a fantastic time to go. The only down side was pulling into Denver after dark. <br /><br />Some tips for the trip. First, if you&#39;re in coach overnight you want to travel alone. You&#39;ll get two seats together if you&#39;re with someone, so sleeping across two seats isn&#39;t possible. I had brought a (now old school) Therm-A-Rest backpacking mattress to sleep on at my destination. I hadn&#39;t thought to use it as a seat cushion when I packed it, but I loaned it to an older couple who was spending their second night on the train and they said it saved them. I sat and slept on it in my seat the entire trip back from Iowa. The seats are fine on their own, but that air mattress made them feel first class.<br /><br />I packed cup o noodles and oatmeal to eat. I brought a cup to prep the oatmeal. Downstairs in the club car/observation car there&#39;s a place to get boiling hot water. I tipped the attendant $1 each time they got me some hot water. I carried it back to my seat in a big refillable soda mug, but now I&#39;d probably pack a HydroFlask for that purpose. It was nice to have a quart of boiling hot water at my seat.<br /><br />If I were traveling this route for pleasure (and if I wasn&#39;t from the SLC area) I&#39;d get off the train and spend 24 or more hours in a couple of places. I&#39;d definitely get off in SLC. There&#39;s so much to see and do. Just be sure to get a car service to take you to your accommodations. The station is safe, but the area around it is pretty bad, and I say that after living in a bad part of Brooklyn. <br /><br />My next place to spend a day is Glenwood Springs. Bring your swimming suit. The attraction is the hot springs. <br /><br />Denver deserves at least 24 hours. The train station is right next to the baseball field. Plan your trip and catch a Rockies game. The restaurant scene near the station is fantastic. Heck, even if you&#39;re just passing through on the train call ahead and order something to go. The train stops long enough to slip into a nearby restaurant to grab your meal.<br /><br />There&#39;s really nothing of note between Denver and Chicago. That said I&#39;d think that Chicago would be worthy of a day or two of exploring. Like I said, the farthest east I&#39;ve been on Amtrak is Iowa, but I&#39;ve lived in NYC, so I know a big city like Chicago is worth your time.<br /><br />If I added two more places to stop I&#39;d include Truckee, CA and Grand Junction, CO. Truckee looked fun and touristy when I passed through. Grand Junction looks crappy from the railroad tracks, but it has some nice scenery nearby. Colorado National Monument is worth a visit. The best restaurants are in nearby Fruita. The Hot Tomato has amazing pizza and El Tapatio has great chipotle cream sauce.<br /><br />Edit: I almost forgot, there are plans for a new excursion train to run from the Amtrak route south to Moab, Utah. I hope it works out because taking the train to Moab would be fantastic. <br /><br />Traveling over the Rocky Mountains along the Colorado River is definitely the highlight of the trip.",moabfool,2021-03-07T02:45:23Z,0

The Technician said, &quot;Are you Claustrophobic.&quot; I said, &quot;No, not at all, why?&quot; Agoraphobia and caligynephobia...quite another story. But I&#39;m digressing...sorry...<br /><br />Afterward, I said &quot;What would you have done had I said I WAS Claustrophobic?&quot; He replied, &quot;I&#39;d have given you 10 mg of Valium.&quot;  D***!!

Some of us with that Y Chromosome don&#39;t worry so much about such things  LOL <br /><br />The longest trip I took was from Washington, DC to Indianapolis, ~18 hours. LOVED IT! Due to my BAD Sleep Apnea and thus CPAP Machine, HAD to have a compartment. The train was supposed to arrive in Indy ~5:00 AM, but ran two-plus hours late. The Attendant (a VERY Nice man named Will who had been with Amtrak for as long as there WAS an Amtrak) said, &quot;Normally, this wouldn&#39;t be the case. But since we&#39;re running late, go get yourself some breakfast.&quot; BTW, meals are included in your fare when you have a compartment. I thought (but DID NOT say), &quot;I&#39;m getting to ride the train for an additional two hours, you&#39;re going to feed me breakfast...AND YOU&#39;RE APOLOGIZING!!&quot;  That said, The omelet I got reminded me A LOT of half of an orange frisbee, both in appearance and what I imagine the taste of such would be. Fortunately, with enough ketchup and hot sauce, it transmogrified into something vaguely resembling edible. <br /><br />If I were POTUS, the Chairman of Amtrak would be on his knees screaming, &quot;Have Mercy, Sir!

"Once while I was on the CZ riding in a sleeping car, I observed a live birth take place on the train, I‚Äôm not joking. Back in late March 2019, I was on the California Zephyr going from Davis to Glenwood Springs and on the train, there was pregnant 19 year old girl from SFSU traveling from Emeryville to Denver with her boyfriend. They normally fly home from college for holidays/breaks but because their due date was close (due date was April 5th and they departed on March 29th), they had to use the train since airlines do not allow women to fly in the last 6 weeks of pregnancy. During the ride at 1 AM, the girl‚Äôs water broke and the attendant for our sleeping car (Justin Woods, a young guy in his early 20s) volunteered to deliver the baby since he had seen how it was done online. The girl agreed and Justin did so in which he went into the first aid kit, got his gloves on, then squeezed himself into the roomette to have the girl push while he caught the baby when she was born. The baby ended up being born on the train - a healthy baby girl in a ROOMETTE!!! It was a fabulous story and the girl, her newborn and boyfriend were taken off the train by paramedics at the next railroad crossing (train was in a remote location between Elko and Salt Lake City at the moment which required a helicopter ambulance to meet the train). As it is, I observed the whole thing as I was holding the girl‚Äôs left leg as well as recording this with her boyfriend‚Äôs phone. I‚Äôve wondered - if you are female, suppose this happened to you where you (or your wife/girlfriend) suddenly went into labor on an Amtrak train and the train was going across a remote location at the moment. Would you at all be able to tolerate giving birth unmediated, while crammed into a Roomette, on a bed that was not flexible (unlike in the hospital), on a train that speeding up to 90 MPH, the baby‚Äôs umbilical cord having to stay attached to you until you got to a hospital (no scissors/clamps on the train), and the person delivering your baby is an Amtrak conductor/attendant with no medical training or license of any kind??? Seriously, this girl was incredibly brave and was lucky that there were no complications, PLUS it only took 20 minutes for her to push the baby out (water broke at 1 AM, and the baby was born at 1:22 AM) What do you think of all this!!!???",Cole Allen,2020-12-30T02:22:45Z,0

"It is pretty amazing you can do this on only two trains in the USA.  In Europe to go from Barcolona, Spain to Warsaw, Poland (across the continent) you have to take five trains and buses since there is no train that covers that distance, and it takes 34 hours.  Faster, but many more transfers and you cannot take the train the whole distance.    Canada due to COVID does not offer coast to coast service at this point.  Took the train from NYC to Florida in a Roomette, it works as you get a shower, personal bathroom, and room to sleep.  Works much better.  Admire you for trying this across the country - nearly no one does that today - especially in coach.",Sam S,2020-12-29T02:00:02Z,0

So latter on in like some latter time I told my cousin in Chicago, IL that I got a hotel stay due to a train delay, and leaving the next day out to continue my ride across the USA on Amtrak trains, and so my cousin in Chicago, IL said if that ever happens to you again then we can let you stay with us for the night until you have to catch the train out the next day, so I was like ok ill let you know if I get delayed in Chicago if I was to travel across the country again and miss my connection to California, then I will let you know.

"LOVE the train !!   In 2001, I took my 14 year old daughter on a rail pass.  We went coach from El Paso Tx, to Deland, Fl,  to Washington DC (where a friend met us), then on to New York City,  Niagara Falls,  Montreal,  Sioux Outlook, ON;  Jasper, AB (rented car and visited Jasper and Banff National Parks -- Amazing !!!),  Vancouver, Seattle, Olympia WA.  Los Angeles, Tucson, AZ and back to El Paso, TX.  We had regular coach seats (very comfortable, even for someone 50+, me).  One night, our train lost air conditioning.  We ended up getting offered and took a sleeper car.  I must admit, I would NEVER pay for one. I was just as comfortable sleeping in the regular reclining chairs. We had 30 days and did 3 sides of the U.S. and the entire bottom of Canada -  all for $698 each.  Loved every minute of it.  I will admit there were 2 shady people.  1 was going thru luggage looking for prescription drugs and the other was stoned.  Both were removed by police at the next station.",nmbutterfly52,2020-09-29T19:35:31Z,0

"I did the California zephyr from Chicago to San Francisco. To be honest I was exhausted the whole trip. I couldn&#39;t sleep, I had to keep the door to my roomette open because it was hot. They started talking on the loud speaker at 6am. The power outlet in my room stopped working so I had to charge my phone in the sight seer lounge. They force you to eat with strangers when all you want is some peace and quiet. It was winter time and the shower froze up. The bathroom is disgusting. Its just a hole that sucks down the waste, no water. Spent an hour or two stuck on a mountain side for a high wind warning, hour or two for a blizzard in the Sierra Nevada mountains, another hour or two for a broken rail in Utah. Don&#39;t use the train if you think you are going to get somewhere on time. I didn&#39;t get to see San Francisco at all. I arrived late and it was raining. The train would be OK if you don&#39;t have time constraints and have time to explore a few days off the train. Honestly after 3 days on a train you want off! Even coming back I missed my connecting train and had to take another one. I couldn&#39;t sleep again because I was to arrive at my train stop at 3am and I was afraid no one would wake me up. You are just better to take a car. You have more privacy and can stop to stretch your legs whenever. I did get some nice pictures though.",Angela L,2020-08-31T16:25:43Z,1

"This was fun. I love riding Amtrak but I don&#39;t expect I&#39;ll be doing it again until there&#39;s a vaccine. I try to never spend more than one night at a time in coach. If I had to be on for two nights I would get a sleeper. One trick I&#39;ve learned sleeping in coach is that if you have two seats and pull up the leg support all the way you can make a flat area large enough to sleep in a fetal position.

"Yes Indeed! New York attitude! LOL Long trip! Yes Indeed, see most of USA 11 states all different or similar landscapes, the view will change the perspective of how big the USA as 70MPH most of the time traveled! So the west coast to the east coast was traveled! This eventually created US railways back in the day! FYI As a commercial vehicle driver then 35 years career in all of North America! A 3-4 day trip too did have 10 hours off duty after 14 hours of work time per 24 hours! IDK prices then airline $241.00 USD can not beat that for anything sleep included! Then in diesel fuel bill $5500.00 USD for 3400 miles coast to coast <a href=""http://ca.to/"">CA.to</a> NY. traveling! Economical car and rental guess $2500.00 plus hotels 3 nights meals etc! Well worth the Amtrak experience, views as a foreigner get the bed accommodations! Many gallons of coffee driving for 3 days!Very sleepy, very tired! Take care!

Ô¥æ3Ô¥ø¬†¬†He hath taught him utterance. Ô¥æ4Ô¥ø¬†¬†The sun and the moon are made punctual. Ô¥æ5Ô¥ø¬†¬†The stars and the trees prostrate. Ô¥æ6Ô¥ø¬†¬†And the sky He hath uplifted; and He hath set the measure, Ô¥æ7Ô¥ø¬†¬†That ye exceed not the measure, Ô¥æ8Ô¥ø¬†¬†But observe the measure strictly, nor fall short thereof. Ô¥æ9Ô¥ø¬†¬†And the earth hath He appointed for (His) creatures, Ô¥æ10Ô¥ø¬†¬†Wherein are fruit and sheathed palm-trees, Ô¥æ11Ô¥ø¬†¬†Husked grain and scented herb. Ô¥æ12Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ13Ô¥ø¬†¬†He created man of clay like the potter&#39;s, Ô¥æ14Ô¥ø¬†¬†And the jinn did He create of smokeless fire. Ô¥æ15Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ16Ô¥ø¬†¬†Lord of the two Easts, and Lord of the two Wests! Ô¥æ17Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ18Ô¥ø¬†¬†He hath loosed the two seas. They meet. Ô¥æ19Ô¥ø¬†¬†There is a barrier between them. They encroach not (one upon the other). Ô¥æ20Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ21Ô¥ø¬†¬†There cometh forth from both of them the pearl and coral-stone. Ô¥æ22Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ23Ô¥ø¬†¬†His are the ships displayed upon the sea, like banners. Ô¥æ24Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ25Ô¥ø¬†¬†Everyone that is thereon will pass away; Ô¥æ26Ô¥ø¬†¬†There remaineth but the Countenance of thy Lord of Might and Glory. Ô¥æ27Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ28Ô¥ø¬†¬†All that are in the heavens and the earth entreat Him. Every day He exerciseth (universal) power. Ô¥æ29Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ30Ô¥ø¬†¬†We shall dispose of you, O ye two dependents (man and jinn). Ô¥æ31Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ32Ô¥ø¬†¬†O company of jinn and men, if ye have power to penetrate (all) regions of the heavens and the earth, then penetrate (them)! Ye will never penetrate them save with (Our) sanction. Ô¥æ33Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ34Ô¥ø¬†¬†There will be sent, against you both, heat of fire and flash of brass, and ye will not escape. Ô¥æ35Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ36Ô¥ø¬†¬†And when the heaven splitteth asunder and becometh rosy like red hide - Ô¥æ37Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? - Ô¥æ38Ô¥ø¬†¬†On that day neither man nor jinni will be questioned of his sin. Ô¥æ39Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ40Ô¥ø¬†¬†The guilty will be known by their marks, and will be taken by the forelocks and the feet. Ô¥æ41Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ42Ô¥ø¬†¬†This is hell which the guilty deny. Ô¥æ43Ô¥ø¬†¬†They go circling round between it and fierce, boiling water. Ô¥æ44Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ45Ô¥ø¬†¬†But for him who feareth the standing before his Lord there are two gardens. Ô¥æ46Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ47Ô¥ø¬†¬†Of spreading branches. Ô¥æ48Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ49Ô¥ø¬†¬†Wherein are two fountains flowing. Ô¥æ50Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ51Ô¥ø¬†¬†Wherein is every kind of fruit in pairs. Ô¥æ52Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ53Ô¥ø¬†¬†Reclining upon couches lined with silk brocade, the fruit of both the gardens near to hand. Ô¥æ54Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ55Ô¥ø¬†¬†Therein are those of modest gaze, whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them. Ô¥æ56Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ57Ô¥ø¬†¬†(In beauty) like the jacynth and the coral-stone. Ô¥æ58Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ59Ô¥ø¬†¬†Is the reward of goodness aught save goodness? Ô¥æ60Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ61Ô¥ø¬†¬†And beside them are two other gardens, Ô¥æ62Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ63Ô¥ø¬†¬†Dark green with foliage. Ô¥æ64Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ65Ô¥ø¬†¬†Wherein are two abundant springs. Ô¥æ66Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ67Ô¥ø¬†¬†Wherein is fruit, the date-palm and pomegranate. Ô¥æ68Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ69Ô¥ø¬†¬†Wherein (are found) the good and beautiful - Ô¥æ70Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? - Ô¥æ71Ô¥ø¬†¬†Fair ones, close-guarded in pavilions - Ô¥æ72Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? - Ô¥æ73Ô¥ø¬†¬†Whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them - Ô¥æ74Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ75Ô¥ø¬†¬†Reclining on green cushions and fair carpets. Ô¥æ76Ô¥ø¬†¬†Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? Ô¥æ77Ô¥ø¬†¬†Blessed be the name of thy Lord, Mighty and glorious!

"I&#39;ve taken Amtrak coast to coast, every route, winter and summer. I coach it. I wish I had the Sunset from Florida to LA. As it is, I need an extra night to California to get to Washington, D. C., before the three nights west.<br />I always go coach. Been doing that since before Amtrak. The experience varies, but I&#39;d do it again tomorrow. Can you sleep? Sure. You can nap during the day, too. I do when I&#39;m tired. I wash up every day and carry clean clothes. You can keep to yourself or chat with other passengers. I recommend it. You meet interesting people. You can move around. You don&#39;t have to haul all your luggage, either. Amtrak has generous baggage allowances Tue best thing? The train teaches you something Europeans often find hard to grasp, and many Americans forget: The US is huge.<br />And beautiful. And has more varied scenery than anywhere else in the world. Amtrak isn&#39;t as fast as trains elsewhere, but it doesn&#39;t take four days to cross the country just because the train is slow.

"I&#39;m fairly sure this part of the video is being misunderstood.  Yes, there are a lot of rude Amtrak employees, especially in New York State, and they&#39;re a curse on the company and I&#39;ve often gotten on their case when I&#39;ve run into them as a passenger; but if you listen carefully to the tone and rhythm of this conductor&#39;s voice and look at the expression on his face, it seems pretty clear that he isn&#39;t being rude:  rather, he&#39;s enjoying her vlogging delivery (I think that&#39;s him laughing appreciatively in the background after she says &quot;Guys, this feels slightly surreal&quot;), and is just good-naturedly kidding her about the awkwardness of her rolling a suitcase, recording a video for an audience, and exiting the train car all at the same time; and she seems to get the joke and to be going along with it.  Note that the next passenger is several feet behind her, so there&#39;s obviously no real need for her to hurry; and note the high, artificial, pseudo-theatrical way in which the conductor says &quot;Come on, you&#39;re holdin&#39; up the line, we all want to get outta here, yeahh!&quot;:  he&#39;s not actually being authoritarian, but rather is making fun of himself as an authority figure and taking the opportunity to joke around with a very charismatic passenger (who he was probably a bit smitten by, as just about any red-blooded hetero male would be).<br /><br />That said, the light-hearted nature of this interchange is a bit too subtle to come across clearly in the video, and arguably should&#39;ve been edited out for that reason.",mpaulshore,2020-05-17T09:40:39Z,0

"There&#39;s nothing wrong with being honest.  Traveling on Amtrak trains a long distance is miserable.  The constant motion is annoying.  The views in the non-diner cars are very limited as the windows are quite small and the seat-backs are high.  The chairs are uncomfortable.  The backs recline, but the seat cushions don&#39;t move out so you feel like you&#39;re being slightly pushed out of the chair.  In effect, you can never get really comfortable enough to sleep.  As for your luggage, you&#39;re lucky it wasn&#39;t stolen.  I speak from experience, I took the train from Raleigh to Miami and that was only 12 hours, and it was miserable. You also neglected to mention the constant stops.  There must have been 20 stops on the way down to Miami.  I can&#39;t imagine your trip was much different.  As for &quot;accidentally&quot; not getting something with a bed... really?  When I booked it&#39;s pretty apparent what you are getting.  You should also mention that if you do book something with a bed cross country it&#39;s going to be about $1,200 plus.  That&#39;s what I saw last time I looked.  You are so much better taking a plane across the country.  United Airlines has a direct flight from San Francisco to New York that leaves at 8:15am and takes only five hours and seven minutes and the cost... $99.  That&#39;s less than half of what you paid for the train, and you had to put up with three and a half days of misery.  As for people who say long distance train travel by coach isn&#39;t so bad, pbth, try it and then tell me.  The only people I know who talk about how great trains are (at least Amtrak) are those who haven&#39;t traveled on them.  They have a weird nostalgia for something they&#39;ve never actually experienced.  Having said all that, i think most viewers can see through your &quot;glass half full&quot; review.  I don&#39;t think you need to sugar coat it.  If riding on the train long distances is miserable, just say it.  I mean, you wouldn&#39;t do it again, would you?",kevin2318,2020-01-12T16:38:54Z,0

"I&#39;ve done part of that journey.. went from New York&#39;s Penn Station (where I&#39;m from) and took it all the way to Denver, Colorado. We stopped in Chicago, and then I took a second train to Denver. I had a seat and it was an interesting journey. It&#39;s wonderful to see a foreigner enjoy the train in my country because people hate the train, but I really enjoyed it. I was going through some rough mental health patches in my life, and I wanted to get away from it all, so I booked a travel pass that I could use on any length within the Amtrak system. Saw Denver.. it was beautiful! They offer these travel passes that give you freedom to go places. Anyways, I really enjoyed your video! It wasn&#39;t so bad! I promise, we are not all like that in New York!",David K.,2020-01-02T00:42:35Z,3
"I&#39;m fairly sure this part of the video is being misunderstood.  Yes, there are a lot of rude and lazy Amtrak employees, especially in New York State, and they&#39;re a curse on the company and I&#39;ve often gotten on their case when I&#39;ve run into them as a passenger; but if you listen carefully to the tone and rhythm of this conductor&#39;s voice and look at the expression on his face, it seems pretty clear that he isn&#39;t being rude:  rather, he&#39;s enjoying her vlogging delivery (I think that&#39;s him laughing appreciatively in the background after she says &quot;Guys, this feels slightly surreal&quot;), and is just good-naturedly kidding her about the awkwardness of her rolling a suitcase, recording a video for an audience, and exiting the train car all at the same time; and she seems to get the joke and to be going along with it.  Note that the next passenger is several feet behind her, so there&#39;s obviously no real need for her to hurry; and note the high, artificial, pseudo-theatrical way in which the conductor says &quot;Come on, you&#39;re holdin&#39; up the line, we all want to get outta here, yeahh!&quot;:  he&#39;s not actually being authoritarian, but rather is making fun of himself as an authority figure and taking the opportunity to joke around with a very charismatic passenger (who he was probably a bit smitten by, as just about any red-blooded hetero male would be).<br /><br />That said, the light-hearted nature of this interchange is a bit too subtle to come across clearly in the video, and arguably should&#39;ve been edited out for that reason.",mpaulshore,2020-05-17T10:22:28Z,0

And yes the Deutsche Bahn bahn prises are sometimes high and they have a lack of invenstment. But the goverment invest now massive into the Deutsche Bahn.

Also the us fraight train sytsem is better than the german. But in Germany its much cheaper to transport fraight with the truck than with the train.

"@Colorme Dubious No no the quality of &quot;Deutsche Bahn&quot; is the same like in the years before. The long distance trains are not that much punctually ( 75% are on time (trains arent on time if the delay is over 6 minutes in germany and not if the delays is over 30 minutes :D ).  Are that the only cities with passenger rail traffic west  of missisippi because that arent much? But lets see more accurate at one of the cities. I took housten at example. Housten has (if im right) 2.3 million inhabitants and Amtrak long distance trains come 3 trains a week to the city.  In Hamburg a city of 1.8 million has 800 db (Metro and City Trains not considered) trains daily ( i think 200 trains of them are long distance trains, the rest are regional trains). And 94% of db regional trains are on time. And in my city (5000 inhabitants the trains comes every hour)<br /><br /><br />P.S. Of course im talking about passenger railway system because this video is about it and she just shows the passenger rail system.",Motrio MTR,2020-01-04T23:04:32Z,0
"@Motrio MTR You didn&#39;t say &quot;passenger railway system,&quot; you said &quot;railway system.&quot; Yes, very little of our network is electrified. Since the railroads are profit-seeking entities, it would make no sense to electrify 140,000 miles of track (much of it out in the vast emptiness west of the Mississippi) at a cost of at least $2,000,000 per mile. That&#39;d be $280,000,000,000 in addition to the cost of the tracks. Yes, we have several different Class I railroads. Are you saying that competition is a bad thing? It tends to drive down prices. These companies actually DO use each others&#39; tracks. It&#39;s a thing that exists called &quot;trackage rights.&quot; They also often lease each others&#39; motive power and rolling stock. 5 trains per day??? The Northeast Corridor sees 60 freight trains and 2,100 passenger trains DAILY. Which western US cities lack rail transport that should have it? These cities west of the Mississippi DO have passenger rail: Seattle, Tacoma, Sacramento, San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Tucson, Albuquerque, El Paso, Salt Lake City, Denver, Dallas, Houston, Austin, Oklahoma City, and Kansas City. If you count cities that straddle the great river, you can include Minneapolis/St Paul, St Louis, and New Orleans. By the way, hasn&#39;t Deutsch Bahn&#39;s quality degraded horribly over the last few years? Perhaps you should clean up your house before throwing stones at ours. We didn&#39;t rebuild your rail network just so you could let it turn to crap.",Colorme Dubious,2020-01-04T21:46:47Z,1

"I just did 46 hours (2 sleeps) on Amtrak coach and here are my tips.<br /><br />1) Brush your teeth, wash your parts, and redo your deodorant every morning. It&#39;s critical.<br />2) Learn how to sleep on your back in advance.<br />3) Spend time outside of your seat. That means dining car, observation car, snack level. Walk downstairs and stand at the emergency exits. You can EASILY walk a mile a day in a train if you&#39;re up and moving around.<br />4) Step out at every smoke break even if you don&#39;t smoke.<br />5) Try to meet someone getting off at the next layover and ask them where the food is if they are a local. Or ask the Amtrak employees at the stop. There are hidden gems around the station that are folklore. People will know about them.<br />6) Wear merino wool or SilverAir athletic clothing.<br />7) Bring a fresh pair of socks for each morning you&#39;ll be on the train.<br />8) Track your progress with GPS on a phone. Waking up in a new state is super cool and boosts morale.<br />9) Find the big bathrooms for morning routines. IF it&#39;s the handicapped bathroom just be quick so you aren&#39;t causing problems.<br /><br />Multiple overnight Amtrak coach is what you make of it.

"The train is DEFINITELY the way travel long distance in America. Even if you&#39;re only going through two or three States, like from Seattle to Los Angeles or Philadelphia to Ft. Lauderdale, the FIRST time you decide to take the train rather than a Greyhound will be the LAST time you ever take a Greyhound. <br /><br />Not only does the train stop at fewer stations, despite going an average of 10 to 15 mph slower than the bus, you&#39;ll also be traveling through the countryside, rather than highway corridors. <br /><br />And, on a Greyhound you can&#39;t walk from your seat to hang out in the dining car lol like you can on the train. <br /><br />The boarding passes are comparable in price, maybe slightly more expensive to ride the Train, (it costs $40 on a Greyhound from Seattle to Salem Oregon. 220 miles. And about $5 to $10 more on Amtrak.) but worth EVERY extra dollar. <br /><br />Last, but not least, there is WAY more room to move around on the train, compared to the bus. So, it&#39;s FAR more comfortable. <br /><br />I used to take the Greyhound everywhere I went. But once I decided to try Amtrak I never got on another bus again.

"I&#39;ve been enjoying the different videos submitted by various travelers riding Amtrak. This one was different because it was riding solely in coach across the USA. Even without a shower it isn&#39;t that bad....like camping for 4 days with no running water. Unlike hard camping there is a restroom with a water/sink to wipe one&#39;s self down if you bought a face towel and a small to large hand towel or even using disposable travel body towelettes to refresh your body. The hair washing is out but there is dry shampoo to revive hair. If one pulled out a change of shirt or blouse, socks, underwear and lightweight sleepwear it would also make the trip more tolerable. It wasn&#39;t entirely stationary (in the same seat for the entire trip). There is the observation car, general cafe area, and to the restrooms to walk around for a wee bit and if the train has any extended waiting periods at stops one can get out for a few minutes. Then there are the views outside the train windows.

The reason that passenger rail doesn&#39;t work well (the country is big and low density) is the same reason that freight rail DOES work well.  Moving large amounts of goods kinda fast/kinda slow works better than moving a few people kinda fast/kinda slow.  Nobody has a problem with their goods taking three days to move across the country; people have problems if it takes themselves to take three days to move across the country.,Geotpf,2019-11-24T13:04:56Z,1

@Alchemica Blackwood round trip train tickets for coach the entire way wich i do nkt reccoment lol sleaping in coach is only for a night or 2 but not the ten nights round trip it took . It was about 950 or so for 2 people .thats not food or hotels or anything other then the amtrack tickets. . I reccomend bringing food. They food on the train is crazy high priced and nasty. Its like 8 to 12 bucks for a frozen microwaved cheese burger they sell at the dollar store for a buck. They call it angus but i doubt it.. also the meals they serve in the dining car is like 40 a plate for stuff like spaghetti or mussels. N neither are good trust me its a train . Lol other then that it was fun .met some really nice people. Kept in touch with a cpl of them .one other thing is it should have been 6 days on train but so many delays and issues it was also a big problem so dont plan on being on time if take amtrak,Maddmavic,2020-01-02T03:07:46Z,0

"Just subscribed.<br /><br />What was most interesting of Amtrak Tucson to NYC via Chicago was the dining car.  The food was very good AND by tradition solo/couples dined with strangers for a maximum of four to a table.  The price was $$.<br /><br />The snack car had limited hours so I tended to horde a little.<br /><br />I always had my camera and phone with me and left all else at my seat.   Yes Eva, that‚Äôs what I did a lot stretch out for a few hours in the observation room and late at night I‚Äôd try to make as little noise with the doors between cars.<br /><br />Night two of three was my best nights sleep.  On night one there was a cocaine bust of a passenger right under my window during a stopover in El Paso a at the four hour mid-morning stopover in San Antonio a guy died four rows back - and we all stood on the platform the WHOLE time.  Amtrak slipped up on Service too during night one and three.<br /><br />But on night two I stayed in the observation room because it‚Äôs so palatial and almost empty past 11:00PM.  The only others were a young woman and her baby seated.  Perhaps she was concerned about her baby crying ...  as I passed her I took an orange juice from my snack bag ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be having this and the snack bar won‚Äôt be open for a while‚Äù ...

I traveled from Chicago to Portland this way, and I had two seats to myself both nights. It was still uncomfortable, I agree. On the way back, I upgraded to a roomette.",Stella Z,2019-10-21T02:01:41Z,0

"riding coach is not too bad, but you can&#39;t really relax or spread out¬†when you have another passenger beside you. You are not entitled to take 2 seats, but if you are lucky it is a nice way to go. Plus, like another viewer commented, you certainly can take a bird bath in the rest room, plus change underwear. There are body wipes available at Walmart for cleaning up in these situations. The killer is actually the seats that do not have center arm rests and do not provide good support for your head, so you need to have something of a pillow and be prepared for cold night temperatures by either taking a light blanket or putting on more clothes. The last time I did 2-24hr trips with several hours between trips (DC to Chicago to Fort Worth), my bottom was kind of numb even though I made sure to get up and walk around every 2 hours. I made sure to get some food at the¬†station or nearby¬†to go before boarding. Union station in DC and Chicago have plenty of options. It is a train¬†trip, not a hotel stay. I don&#39;t think I can sleep normally in a sleeper either because after all the cabin moves and has the same sounds as in coach, but I will give it a try next year.",crw1149,2019-10-18T16:10:35Z,0

"Waiting seems to be an agony for most people today.   The younger, the more intolerable. That and the obsessive need to daily shower when you are sitting in air conditioning not getting dirty, doing no labor.<br />In reality if you spent 3.5 days on a couch watching TV/Tableting or finishing a report you would have a similar situation.  We overwash ourselves as therapy due to the ease of hot water the last 100 years.  That gives us dry skin and stripped hair, requiring us to add chemicals and lotions back.<br /><br />I ride overnight to DC or Philly and always just use coach.  When my wife and daughter ride west to ElPaso they take the sleeper roomette, but spend a lot of time out of it.  The biggest problem with coach is the likelyhood of other passengers causing you discomfort.  There will always be snoring.  Twentysomethings sprawled out in sleeping bags with bare feet.  Loud talking or unruly running children with parents that are happy the kids are bothering you for a change.<br /><br />You have about a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1f8Rj9ok3jQ&amp;t=50m50s"">50:50</a> chance of getting that coach.  If your tolerance for that has a short time limit, then take the plane.  A tight bus with wings so you only deal with it for 3 hours.<br /><br />It appears that your comfort was aided by the fact the coach was half empty and you spread into other seats yourself.  Not as likely on east coast North/South trains.<br /><br />You can remain clean and pleasant smelling over three nights sitting in a chair without a shower.  Hair should be brushed each morning and fixes in different ways, as the salon look will fade for the long tresses girls.  Our 50s Moms never washed their doo except at the weekly hairdresser.

I road coach both times and didn&#39;t have a blanket or a pillow. Just a denim jacket. It&#39;s ice cold in those cars in the summer so it was difficult to sleep on the seats with pretty much nothing to stay warm and comfortable. I will say one thing, the Amtrak coffee is amazing!

Yup you can definitely tell the first moment she steps in ny with that rude ass conductor telling her,Al Mel,2019-09-14T06:18:59Z,32
"I&#39;m fairly sure this part of the video is being misunderstood.  Yes, there are a lot of rude and lazy Amtrak employees, especially in New York State, and they&#39;re a curse on the company and I&#39;ve often gotten on their case when I&#39;ve run into them as a passenger; but if you listen carefully to the tone and rhythm of this conductor&#39;s voice and look at the expression on his face, it seems pretty clear that he isn&#39;t being rude:  rather, he&#39;s enjoying her vlogging delivery (I think that&#39;s him laughing appreciatively in the background after she says &quot;Guys, this feels slightly surreal&quot;), and is just good-naturedly kidding her about the awkwardness of her rolling a suitcase, recording a video for an audience, and exiting the train car all at the same time; and she seems to get the joke and to be going along with it.  (Despite her temporarily physically awkward situation, though, it&#39;s not clear that she actually needs help with her relatively small suitcase, or that--as BADGUY points out--an employee&#39;s attempt to help her with it wouldn&#39;t be more disruptive than it&#39;s worth.)  Note that the next passenger is several feet behind her, so there&#39;s obviously no real need for her to hurry; and note the high, artificial, pseudo-theatrical way in which the conductor says &quot;Come on, you&#39;re holdin&#39; up the line, we all want to get outta here, yeahh!&quot;:  he&#39;s not actually being authoritarian, but rather is making fun of himself as an authority figure and taking the opportunity to joke around with a very charismatic passenger (who he was probably a bit smitten by, as just about any red-blooded hetero male would be).<br /><br />That said, the light-hearted nature of this interchange is a bit too subtle to come across clearly in the video, and arguably should&#39;ve been edited out for that reason.<br /><br />A note to BADGUY and Aaron White, by the way:  This is a single-level train, not a bilevel one.  People&#39;s carry-on luggage is stored in various overhead and end-of-car racks, and also to a minor degree in certain small floor areas.",mpaulshore,2020-05-17T10:06:24Z,0

"@David Austerman I&#39;ve traveled on Amtrak. The problem is there&#39;s so much luggage in the bottom floor of the car, the staff has to let the passenger&#39;s file by and collect their own luggage, as they leave. Otherwise, if the conductor&#39;s try to help they&#39;ll just slow down the entire operation (too many people in the aisle..and WHO do they help?...and WHO do they not help?). Also there are porters (red caps) with carts just outside the car that are ready to assist.",BADGUY 1,2019-09-19T15:01:22Z,3

My experience has been that it is far cheaper and a lot quicker to fly.  Took the train from San Diego to Seattle and it ws a great way to go.  The seats reclined and we were on time at every stop.  Took the train from Minneapolis to Seattle and we were five and a half hours late leaving.  The seats did not recline and when we arrived in Spokane they announced that we were so late that they were going to put us on a bus to Seattle so that they could turn the train around and by doing that they would be back on schedule.  The bus trip from Spokane to Seattle is less than joyful although they did give us sacks of subway sandwiches while on the bus.,Terrence Bradley,2019-09-12T20:19:12Z,0
"Oh and let me add; we never traveled over 55 mph as the engine was a substitute freight engine.  At least that is what they told us.  I don&#39;t want to seem bitter because I did enjoy being on the train.  The ride is smooth and you can get up and walk around and you do get to meet other people.  But it is sad when you know that in Europe the trains are on time almost always and travel at speeds of up to 200 mph.  This is America and aren&#39;t we supposed to be the most advanced and a leader in almost everything?  But our roads are a mess and flying is a pain and the trains are slow and expensive,",Terrence Bradley,2019-09-12T20:25:23Z,0

"As an experienced Amtrak rider (been on these trains 100s of times) some additional notes worth pointing out if your considering traveling this way:   <br /><br /><br />1) Almost every double decker Amtrak Superliner coach I&#39;ve been on has a larger lavatory meant specifically for changing.  They&#39;re much larger rooms that contain a seat and a mirror in addition to the sink/toilet.   There&#39;s one at the end of the hall in the lower level, and one usually to the side.  There&#39;s also almost always larger handicapped rest room if that fails.  If for whatever reason the restrooms in your coach aren&#39;t cutting it, go to the next coach.<br /><br /><br />2). Eva forgot to point out that the coach seats also almost always have fold out leg extenders and footrests which can improve your sleeping surface area if you sleep diagonal (provided you don&#39;t have a neighbor sitting next to you.  There are two levers: one reclines the seat back, the other releases the leg extender which you will then have to physically pull up.  The footrests extend downward from the seat in front of you.<br /><br /><br />3). There are FIVE classes on Amtrak.  Coach / Roomette (upper and lower sections)  / Family Bedroom (lower section only) / Bedroom (upper sections only) / Handicapped Bedroom (lower section only).  <br /><br /><br />Coach is typically for people taking short legs along the cross-country route.  <br /><br /><br />Roomettes (Eva showed one of the lower level ones) are the best value because your diner car meals are free and you have the use of shared showers.  They are small.   It does bunk but it&#39;s not the most comfortable space for two larger people.  <br /><br /><br />Family bedrooms (Eva showed one) can sleep a family of 4, they are the largest rooms extending the full width of the train but are not as nicely appointed as the standard Bedrooms, they&#39;re also only on the lower levels. Meals are free.<br /> <br />Bedrooms are nice but expensive all found on the upper level.   You get a bigger sleeping area, chair,  more room plus your own toilet/shower room.  Some bedrooms can conjoin allowing families or friends to create a larger space.  Meals are free.<br /><br /><br />Handicapped bedrooms are large specifically made for someone with limited mobility.  They extend the full width of the train and have a large bathroom without a shower to one side. Meals are free.<br /><br /><br />4). Traveling east of Chicago, you&#39;ll always be on trains that are single story.  This is because most of the eastern cities are older and have tunnels/bridges that cannot accommodate taller cars.  So some of the amenities change slightly with the east coast trains, like the roomettes are actually nicer in the single story trains (having two windows, one for the upper bunk and a toilet/sink). <br /><br /><br />Good luck!",Evan J,2019-09-10T23:02:40Z,847
"@Evan J   Lets not forget that GM influenced the US government to dismantle train and trolley infrastructure so they could promote their product (cars and buses), and people like Robert Moses were making good $$ building highways, so we were &quot;trained&quot; to desire suburbia and auto/ truck based logistics over rail.  There were individuals and corporations that made a ton of $$ in the transition to the car and highways.   Europeans were less willing to jump at the bait and retained their infrastructure, as you note.",bkanegson,2021-02-14T16:59:57Z,1
"@Jeff 619 you have to remember that the USA is a vast country. Going between major cities here is not like going from London to Paris. Our major cities are typically 500 miles apart. <br /><br />The distance from New York (on the east coast) to San Francisco (on the west coast) is over 2900 miles, or 4667 km. It is approximately the same as the distance from London to Athens, which is a trip one would not normally take on a train; the TGV does not go from London all the way to Athens, so it would take about as long as the trip on Amtrak from San Jose to New York takes.<br /><br />If there were TGV compatible tracks all that way and one could take a TGV, it would still take about 13 hours.<br /><br />Whereas a jet aircraft only takes five hours.<br /><br />Since the distance between major cities in the USA is usually vast, we usually take jet aircraft rather than trains. We really only take long distance train trips for aesthetic reasons here in the USA.<br /><br />It&#39;s different in Europe because Europe is a lot older. Rome and Paris were major cities back when people got around on horseback and on foot. This is not the case with the USA. The &quot;northeast corridor&quot;, from New York to Boston, is older than the country itself (those two cities existed back in the 1600s), and it is common for people to take public transportation trains between those two cities, but if you&#39;re traveling all the way across the country, the only reason to take a train is to enjoy the view when you have a lot of vacation time to burn. :)",neutrino78x,2020-12-28T01:43:17Z,0

I loathe long car trips, because you&#39;re trapped behind the wheel having to pay close attention to the traffic - which can be tedious and nerve wracking - and even if you&#39;re not driving, you&#39;re stuck in your seat for hours and hours.  I like the train because it goes through some parts of the countryside you don&#39;t see from the interstates, and I can watch movies, read, get up and walk around, go to the bathroom any time, get food and drinks - and BEST OF ALL many hours of the journey are passed while you sleep, so no time wasted overnight in a hotel!",lisalu910,2020-11-08T19:14:39Z,0

I spend a bit of my life watching it to find, it did give a nice insight, it was a good video , it was great but it didn‚Äôt actually answer the main things anyone spending 5 mins thinking about doing the trip want to know.

"I&#39;m fairly sure this part of the video is being misunderstood.  Yes, there are a lot of rude and lazy Amtrak employees, especially in New York State, and they&#39;re a curse on the company and I&#39;ve often gotten on their case when I&#39;ve run into them as a passenger; but if you listen carefully to the tone and rhythm of this conductor&#39;s voice and look at the expression on his face, it seems pretty clear that he isn&#39;t being rude:  rather, he&#39;s enjoying her vlogging delivery (I think that&#39;s him laughing appreciatively in the background after she says &quot;Guys, this feels slightly surreal&quot;), and is just good-naturedly kidding her about the awkwardness of her rolling a suitcase, recording a video for an audience, and exiting the train car all at the same time; and she seems to get the joke and to be going along with it.  Note that the next passenger is several feet behind her, so there&#39;s obviously no real need for her to hurry; and note the high, artificial, pseudo-theatrical way in which the conductor says &quot;Come on, you&#39;re holdin&#39; up the line, we all want to get outta here, yeahh!&quot;:  he&#39;s not actually being authoritarian, but rather is making fun of himself as an authority figure and taking the opportunity to joke around with a very charismatic passenger (who he was probably a bit smitten by, as just about any red-blooded hetero male would be).<br /><br />That said, the light-hearted nature of this interchange is a bit too subtle to come across clearly in the video, and arguably should&#39;ve been edited out for that reason.",mpaulshore,2020-05-17T10:07:24Z,0
