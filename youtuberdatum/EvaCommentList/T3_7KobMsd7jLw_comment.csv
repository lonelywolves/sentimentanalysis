"Zionist spies come in many forms ... Doctors without Borders, reporters, adventurers, etc.<br />Marathon on a remote island such as Socotra and in the Kurdish region in northern Iraq, and those countries are in a state of war and conflict !! Did you not find better places than those countries to practice your sport and your fake humanity that we are tired of !!",كويتي بالتأسيس,2021-04-26T16:01:33Z,0

"Running a Marathon? Yes, when I was 20 certainly I would have done it. But a Marathon in Yemen? In Kurdistan? Are you crazy? It‘s so hot there! How could you survive the heat? Not so bad in having no footage og your win. We have seen it in Kurdistan. ;-)",Trinity Inspiration,2021-03-31T01:43:44Z,0

"One tip from me: Never walk! Or stop for your drink. Just go by, take it and drink it while running. If you feel to stop or to walk, then you are running to fast. Just slow down then, but never walk or stop. Try to adjust your speed and run the complete distance. Always.<br /><br />You can do it! 💪",Oliver J.,2021-03-22T07:41:56Z,0

Somthing important about yemen and socatra Island..<br />Socatra Island is one of the safest places in yemen simply because it is an island 😅😅 which means that no houthi will reach it 😅<br />Also it is far from the places where the shia minority exists ( the main problem in yemen is that Iran is funding and supporting houthi which is a militia based on Yemeni shias who shifted from the tolerant zaidi shia method to the Iranian supported ethni ashri shia method.,مالك القطيف,2021-01-26T23:00:28Z,0

Running a marathon during the pandemic? Now that&#39;s a responsible traveller. You obviously came from Dubai which was open for travel and experienced covid outbreaks. Nobody is wearing a mask or socially distancing and on top of that you high fiving ignorant locals that will later go back to their extensive families living several generations under one roof in a country with weak healthcare.<br />All this reminds of Trump rallies. You are a carrier of death.,styx,2021-01-23T09:43:10Z,0

And after I watching your full marathon videos, I am happy! And impatient to have an experience full marathon and doing an adventure like you! But I know, but I know now it&#39;s not that time because I am a still college student, but in the future. I have a dream to meet with you in a good place and a good opportunity.

"Going from a marathon to a multi-day stage race is a big step. One not to be taken lightly. Things that you can get away with for a single day won&#39;t work over multiple days.<br />But you are young, you have that on your side. (I no longer do unfortunately)<br />I haven&#39;t done a multi-day stag race yet, but I have survived multiple ultras.<br /><br />So here is my advice, take it for what it is worth.<br /><br />1. don&#39;t bite of more than you can chew. there are stage races and there are stage races. Choose something easy for the first one. you can always pick a hard one later on.<br />2. Learn about recovery. It doesn&#39;t matter what you can throw down on day one. It matters what you can do after four or five days of long distance running.<br />3. Lighter is better. Everything you have to carry makes it harder.<br />4. dry is good. Keep your feet dry. Waterproof socks are really helpful, even if you don&#39;t think your fee will get wet. The one splash through a puddle can set you up for failure.<br />5. your mind will give out long before your body does. When you are ready to quit and you can&#39;t go any further, know that your body has at least another three or four more days of hard running in it.<br />6. Enjoy all of it. Win, lose or draw you will be doing something so out there that most people can&#39;t even fathom it. So enjoy all of it, even the bits that hurt. Those painful moments will become the memories you laugh about with your friends in the years to come. <br /><br /><br />Good luck ;-)",Little Old Man Running,2021-01-17T08:56:17Z,0

"Take care of your heart! You might not believe it, but this trend of running long distances is not good for your heart :( I heard (and forgot) about this in Med School, but recently I listened to this warning in a class made by Dr. Brugada (a cardiologist who has a syndrome with his last name, and an world eminence in his field) and he said that running long distances increases 5-8 times the risk of having atrial fibrillation (a type of arrythmia).<br />So...ultra marathon looks like a cool thing, but it isn´t the best for health.",M.,2021-01-16T22:24:16Z,9
I highly disagree with this comment. I follow marathon athletes and many make it into very late age while still running marathons. It has to be a lifestyle and its something you have to train for. The problem with modern society is that we have become so lazy and eat so much garbage that any exercise feels like it could trigger a heart attack.,Supernova,2021-01-17T04:48:39Z,0

Inspiring! My 2020 goal was to run my first 21k race. Ended up by completing also one 30k. Was about to do my first marathon this year. Hmm. Might aswell join the brave team and go for ultra! 😊 would love to see your journey of training!,Rasma Puspure,2021-01-16T18:14:27Z,0
"Sending great congratulations for an amazing effort, as to take on a marathon with very little training, is definitely a &quot;10&quot; on the guts gauge.  Only those who have undertaken that will understand, for which I regretfully confess to having such an understanding... throughout my streak of 18 consecutive Las Vegas Marathons. That started back in 2003, just 3 months after a heart attack (in which I died), and had double bypass surgery. Three years ago I had a knee surgery and couldn&#39;t run for 4 months, and my first day back was 19 days before the race. That&#39;s what I call my &quot;time management system of marathon training&quot;. I would love to see videos of your training, and have no doubt from your truly exceptional mental strength (another 10 on the guts gauge for you was riding your bike across Poland with all of your camping gear....that was hard!) that you will complete quite an amazing ultra marathon. Regular massage is a great thing to flush the toxins and eliminate the lactic acid. Wishing you an amazing 2021, and this was a truly excellent video.

"Eva, thank you again for another lovely Vlog of yours. To answer your question, Yes, most certainly would love you to post videos of your training. Now to come back to this Vlog, not only is it most enjoyable but more so for the fact of seeing people having fun and enjoying life. Come to think of it, when the lenses shift away from the stereotypical news channels that give us all the wrong vibes about people what do we get in return but the true images of countries and societies as your Vlogs prove? Here we are with people of different nationalities enjoying a truly good time with Socotran Yemenis which amply confirms that people are people, humans are humans at the end of the day, if only Politicians left people alone and in peace without all their expansionist aims, then people throughout the world would live in peace and prosperity. All that people throughout the world just want is to live in peace and harmony and this Vlog of yours simply confirms it, what I see are human beings having a good time and lots of big smiles. On a sideline you&#39;ve shown us furthermore what a truly beautiful country Yemen is this including Socotra as well and their people are genuinely kind and hospitable. I very much hope that Yemen, Socotra included will soon find durable and lasting peace and develop into a responsible top Eco Tourist Destination, Yemen and Socotra are Pearls waiting to be discovered, including their top-notch coffee as well.

"Dear Eva, my advice is not to overstress physically, as that will only leave indelible scars on your young heart. If you want to be genuinely happy, seek God now through Catholic meditation and then contemplation, where you will finally accept your own nothingness and merge in fiery love with the Lord.<br />Otherwise, you will never be satisfied because you will continue seeking only experiences of the senses without taking care of your soul.<br />I recommend the &quot;Spiritual Summation&quot; of San Juan de la Cruz so that you walk and jog the correct paths.",Pax Tecum,2021-01-16T14:41:21Z,0

"Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world, with more than 24 million people – some 80 per cent of the population – in need of humanitarian assistance, including more than 12 million children. So all these people decide to turn up and the rich western countries. Who have probably never gone without a meal in their life nor been involved in any form of military combat get together and think “great idea let’s have a fucking marathon!” No shame, no embarrassment, God knows what the fucking locals think of you lot.",ilricettario,2021-01-16T14:17:52Z,0

"​@Ggoddkkiller You were criticizing earlier as to why the event couldn&#39;t be held in mainland Yemen. Ans: no event, let alone a marathon, is in the scope of a crisis place, such as Yemen.<br />I had posted this question in the first para of my prev reply, u silently ignored it.<br /><br />1. Impact for who ?  -&gt;  Impact for all the viewers of this video, from all parts of the world.. including myself from India. Even for Yemenis.. yes. I bet they are proud of Socotra, bet it makes them proud that Socotra is selected as the venue for a marathon..  global participation.. cultural exchange. That is &quot;social&quot;.<br /><br />2. What is the impact ? -&gt;  For most viewers, they discover a wonderland -&gt; an island called Socotra, rarely talked about. Being part of Yemen, it also sheds light into the current crisis of the land.<br />Such global marathons are implicit ambassadors of peace n well-being. That&#39;s &quot;psychological&quot;.<br /><br />Correction to what u said : it&#39;s not held in &quot;war-torn Yemen&quot;, it&#39;s in Socotra.. bringing world attention to this mostly unexplored island.<br /><br />No &quot;ridiculous&quot; meanings at all. That&#39;s your personal perspective.<br />It is such a pity that u see Marathons as a mere &quot;fun&quot; thing.. It&#39;s not a Carnival of Fireworks or noise n extravaganza dude !<br />it&#39;s something else.. it&#39;s a kind of joy n satisfaction for both its participants as well as its viewers, the rest of the world i.e.<br /><br />I hope at least u didn&#39;t miss to watch that lady in her three-wheel chair completing the race.<br />Male, female, young, old, country, color.. nothing matters. A marathon is the spirit of human endurance.<br /><br />P.S : If a little girl sings in her ailing country,  or play football, I hope u won&#39;t judge the act as &quot;morally corrupt &amp; UNACCEPTABLE&quot;. See them as a &quot;ray of hope&quot; rather.",Akhil A K,2021-01-20T20:08:30Z,4

​@Akhil A K I really wonder what social/psychological impact you are talking about and for who?? Not for Yemeni people for sure due they won&#39;t be able to see it while getting bombed EVERY DAY!! And even if a small minority somehow manage to see it they will NOT care or worse consider it offensive as they are starving to DEATH so could you elaborate this nonsense??<br /><br />If you are talking about other people why conducting a marathon in Yemen then?? Why not Oman or any other country where innocent people aren&#39;t getting killed every day and inspire people without also wickedly ignoring people&#39;s suffering?? Or perhaps according to you running in a war-torn country adds some kind of ridiculous &#39;&#39;meaning&#39;&#39; to the marathon??? <br /><br />This is morally corrupt and UNACCEPTABLE in every way regardless how insanely you are optimistic!! And im not a negative thinker rather a realistic person who sees the world as it is which is full of suffering and ridiculous people ignoring it while &#39;&#39;having fun&#39;&#39;!! So i advice you to look out of your window from time to time and try to show empathy towards those people if you are capable of such a thing ofc...,Ggoddkkiller,2021-01-20T07:54:36Z,2
"@Ggoddkkiller In a war torn Yemen; plagued by hunger, malnutrition, dying babies.. &amp; State in tatters, u think it&#39;s conducive to conduct a marathon ?<br />Also, she&#39;s not in charge of conducting marathons. Is she ?<br />The spirit of a marathon itself.. it&#39;s something else.<br />I&#39;m just baffled by your questioning such a great idea - a marathon in Socotra. Can&#39;t u not see the social/psychological impact it can create in people&#39;s minds, esp given the current situation in Yemen. Is it not calling for positive attention, hope &amp; peace ?<br /><br />Also, Eva is an individual, a Travel Vlogger -&gt; Not a corporate/institution/govt or a politician/social activist.. hope u know that.<br /><br />She quit her job to follow her passion.. she chooses places that are not the usual tourist spots; many of them &quot;risky&quot;/&quot;rough&quot; locations. Thus her vlogs do help create awareness about such mostly unexplored places.<br /><br />Not everyone knows what&#39;s happening around the world or deep into the many diverse cultures across the planet. Her vlogs in that sense alone, is more impactful than others.<br /><br />Her work changes perception about Pakistan, Syria, the deserts of Oman, the village in Saudi or Romania.. they touch different lives n cultures.<br /><br />The Socotra island is a unique place on earth, just for it&#39;s landscape. And it&#39;s part of Yemen. Isn&#39;t that giving a &quot;fresh&quot; perspective about Yemen.. ? Esp for the wide majority of common people, the utube audience.. ?<br /><br />Please be critical constructively. I don&#39;t if it&#39;s me.. but can&#39;t even count ur comment as &quot;nit-picking&quot;. Please don&#39;t be so negative.🙏🙄",Akhil A K,2021-01-20T04:11:44Z,5
