It&#39;s been done for hundreds of years in India as well :) it&#39;s called Surma. I saw my grandmother apply it her whole life. They use a small Silver container to store it and apply it with a silver stick sort of a thing. It&#39;s pretty easy and effortless once you get used to it.

"THE VATICAN OWNS EVERYTHING<br />Justin Taylor | Genesology<br /><br />The Vatican Owns Everything<br /><br />On 18 November 1302, Pope Boniface VIII issued the Papal Bull called &quot;Unum Sanctum.&quot;<br /><br />Aside from all that was written, the bull ends with the following statement:<br /><br />‚ÄúFurthermore, we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff.&quot;<br /><br />Since the bull declared that the Roman Pontiff has supreme control over the material world, he states that the body (our body) is governed by the soul and the soul is governed by the ruler of the spiritual, therefore - the Roman Pontiff is Governor of both Soul and body.<br /><br />Basically, what it is saying is that all of the Souls in the world belong to the Roman Catholic Church and apparently, at least in theory, they do ... because no one has dared challenged their claim. Your birth certificate is the title of the Soul that they own in their registries. They have registered you and that is the title to your Soul. Like the bank holds the title to your car because you are indebted to them. In fact, your Social Security card is issued to you with your name in all capital letters ... which indicates chattel to a Corporation. We are inventory.<br /><br />The Roman Catholic Church has a very long history of tyranny and oppression dating back to the very beginning of it&#39;s organization. Because of their desire to control through their crusades and inquisitions, they decided they would create the first Express Trust, called &quot;Unam Sanctum&quot; which was written on a papal bull and placed in their vault. Remember, there are 66 miles of shelving in that vault locked away underground beneath the Vatican.<br /><br />On the papal bull, it says that all of the souls in the world belong to the Roman Catholic Church and they technically do, because no one has challenged their claim. Your Birth Certificate is essentially the title of the Soul that they own in their registries. They have registered you and that is the title to your Soul. Given that there is a small group of Global Elite who control all the world&#39;s finances, military, and ecclesiastical resources, this would not be too difficult to believe.<br /><br />The Inquisition began because many people were waking up to the tyranny and oppression of the Roman Catholic Church in the early 1300‚Äôs. The RCC killed these people due to their need to control humanity. And kill they did. In the millions it is estimated. And it wasn&#39;t pretty. Not even Stephen King could come up with some of the ways they &quot;tortured and disposed&quot; of people who opposed them. 200 years later during the Renaissance, the Hermetica (based upon the Ancient Wisdom and teachings of Hermes) was available, which is where the Bible draws all of its inspiration from, along with previous civilizations and their rituals and beliefs. This knowledge was also suppressed by the RCC ... for centuries.<br /><br />Global Elite families control the Vatican and the Corporation (the incorporation of the Apostle Peter). They also control the US Military, and the London Financial District - all three of which are independent city/states. The control center is the Crown Temple Syndicate. The Washington DC private corporation Federal Estate is actually owned and controlled by the London Crown Temple Syndicate. The Syndicate, through the House of Windsor, owns approximately 1/6 of the Earths land surface. But I digress ...<br /><br />In 325 CE, the emperor, Constantine the Great, made a donation to his Pope, Sylvester saying, ‚ÄúSaint Peter is the Apostle of Jesus of whom Jesus gave this kingdom of Earth to, therefore we are going to claim taxes.‚Äù We pay taxes to Rome, the Khazarian and Venetian Black Nobility elite families based on a fictional document from Constantine issued the year of the First Council of Nicea and the creation of what has become modern day Christianity.<br /><br />Because of a decree written by Pope Nicholas V in 1455, the RCC owns everything, Even what you think you might own such as your car, house or even the pair of shoes you are wearing belongs to the RCC (in their twisted minds). That 4th of July thing? Foggetaboutit. The good &#39;ol USA is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Crown and a full-blown Corporation. It began as &quot;The Virginia Company,&quot; and then ultimately became, &quot;The United States of America Corporation.&quot;<br /><br />We can also thank Pope Gregory for the current Gregorian calendar, which rearranged the previous Julian calendar to match the Pagan holidays that the Roman Catholic Church now claims as Christian holidays. Do your research my friends. Things are not as they seem. It&#39;s a shell game, and they can put the ball wherever they want it to show up ... just like magic. Hide it under our nose, and we won&#39;t even see it. A coin, always two faces ... and nobody ever pays much attention to the side/rim that bind the two as one. Question everything ... everything.<br /><br />Just a thought ...<br /><br />Justin Taylor, ORDM., OCP., DM.",ethan mcdonald,2021-02-19T04:20:18Z,0

"they must be lonely, especially the<br />little girls<br />they deserve normal things like education, socialising with other kids etc<br />i‚Äôm shook at the comment section, how can being isolated everyday since birth be ok? i get that yall think this is being close to nature, away from human bs etc but u can live decently and be close with nature too...<br />idc bout the women but i feel bad for the little girls, they were happy most likely cuz someone visited them",Nowrin Neha,2021-01-31T17:57:12Z,1

"Yes... and yet, a resounding no.!!<br /><br />One must always speak the truth, even when inconvenient or uncomfortable, though especially when the basic human rights of others are being trampled on, denied or denounced... always.!! <br />Not all cultures were created equal, with many permitting and committing human rights violations to one or more subsets of it&#39;s own. <br />So, while the op may have a beautiful view, albeit entirely naively so, on humanity and the acceptance of all the cultures therein, it simply is not so... nor ought it be. <br />I rather to agree with the creator of this video. There can be, and are, beautiful things to be found in this realm, often in other peoples and their cultures, but one must not be so ignorant or naive as to believe that one must accept ALL aspects of other cultures. That simply will not wash.",Mama Marianovits,2021-03-11T05:24:16Z,1

I had the chance and opportunity to go visit Jordan Israel back in the late eighties there was fighting going on there of course just like there&#39;s always fighting going on in the middle East but I remember the people and how wonderful they were they were so very nice not everybody is bad just like not everybody is bad here.    you have your good people and you have your not so good people and that&#39;s just globally but I will say the time that I spent there it was very wonderful the food was amazing and the people were very gracious to me.<br />It&#39;s sad what has happened in our country just recently.   I think globally everyone&#39;s suffering somewhere.   and some people are suffering more than others that&#39;s the saddest part about overpopulation.   Probably covid-19 was started to depopulate.    Who knows how it got here let&#39;s just hope we can get rid of it and let&#39;s just hope mankind can clean up their act and start acting right and treating each other regardless race color creed religion with dignity.      <br />No big tech companies or no big corporations have the right to pick and choose who gets to live and who doesn&#39;t.

The Prophet pardoned her.<br /><br />However, later on, when Bishr ibn Al-Bara‚Äô, who had also eaten from it, died, the Jewish woman was killed for him.<br /><br /><b>Visit the sick -Muslim or Non Muslim</b><br />Narrated by Anas:<br /><br />‚ÄúA young <b>Jewish boy</b> used to serve the Prophet and he became sick. So the Prophet went to visit him. He sat near his head and asked him to embrace Islam. The boy looked at his father, who was sitting there. The latter told him to obey the Prophet and the boy embraced Islam.<br /><br />The Prophet came out saying:<br /><br /><b>‚ÄúPraise be to Allah Who saved the boy from the Hell-fire‚Äù (Al-Bukhari)</b><br /><br /><b>Doing business with non-Muslims? Why not?</b><br /><br />The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) used to do business and enter into dealings with non-Muslims.

"You must do it yourself, nobody else can do it for you. Jesus gave us all the help we need for that. It is in <br />His perfect teachings, in His Gospel, and this is the New Testament. As human beings we are faced with <br />two different kinds of death. The first one is the physical death where everyone heads to the cemetery. <br />The second death is the spiritual death where we kill each other because of sin, Romans 6:23. Sin <br />produces death. So we must overcome our sins in order to be free from our spiritual death. This is why <br />God does not permit sin and also why Jesus commands us to be holy in 1 Peter 1:16, ‚ÄúBe holy for I am <br />Holy.‚Äù Being holy means we overcome our sins. The teachings of Christ help us to overcome all sins. This <br />is the wisdom of God, Mark 1:14-15. Overcoming sins is a perfect religion. Do we have this religion? This <br />is God‚Äôs religion, our holy God, the perfect God, and His holy kingdom. Are you holy? If you are not, this is <br />a serious mistake! Holiness equals perfection. You call yourself a Catholic? Do you overcome your sins? If <br />you don‚Äôt, you are a spectator. Do you call yourself an Orthodox? If you do not overcome your sins, then <br />you are a hypocrite. Do you call yourself a Protestant? Do you overcome your sins? If you don‚Äôt, you are <br />blind. Call yourself whatever you want, but do you overcome your sins? If you don‚Äôt, you walk with your <br />death because sin will kill you sooner or later, Romans 6:23, ‚ÄúThe wages of sin is death.‚Äù Do you disobey <br />God? Do you continue to sin? This is the devil‚Äôs religion. God will put ‚Äúthe devil in hell to burn forever and <br />ever,‚Äù Revelation 20:10. If you continue to do the same that the devil does, you will be the next one to go <br />to hell. Sin will never enter into the holy kingdom of God! You must always stay holy, and this is God‚Äôs <br />plan. This is the eternal safety of His kingdom. So friend, do not let anyone fool you. Jesus said, ‚ÄúYou must <br />truly repent and overcome your sins,‚Äù Mark 1:15. If you don‚Äôt, it will be the biggest mistake you ever <br />made. God through Jesus gave you grace to repent and to change. If you do not accept it, the grace cannot <br />do anything for you! There is no grace that permits you to disobey God. Do you understand? If God <br />permits disobedience and sin, then His kingdom will perish, including us. We do have an all-wise God <br />with a perfect knowledge, a perfect life, and a perfect kingdom. Nobody is permitted to destroy it! Sin <br />does not fit there. Remember, there is no sin in Jesus‚Äô faith, and this is the faith we must follow, no one <br />else. So take sin out of your brain to be able to fit there. There is no sin when we obey God. Sin starts from <br />disobedience to God, and He does not permit that! So we cannot disobey God. Here is the proof: When <br />Adam and Eve disobeyed God, He kicked them out of paradise. Do you see that? Do you see any grace <br />there? Does God change? Religion or no religion, God does not permit disobedience, and He proved it <br />many times. Get to the Word of God so you can see for yourself. Grace or no grace, God does not permit <br />sin. Disobedience separates us from God, and sin produces death, even your own death. This is what you <br />want? God wants to protect us. We must learn His wisdom, not mankind‚Äôs insanity. That‚Äôs why Jesus said <br />to the devil, ‚ÄúMan shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God,‚Äù <br />Matthew 4:4. Have you ever read that? It says every word that comes from God‚Äôs wisdom, not mine not <br />yours. So my friend, get to the wisdom of God, this is your life. The Gospel of Christ is the wisdom of God. <br />Start reading it every day, and do what Jesus tells you to do. He is the only True, Savior for the whole <br />world and for you. If you obey Jesus totally, then I will see you in heaven for sure, see Matthew 7:21. Jesus <br />gave a command, ‚ÄúIf you stay in my Word, you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free,‚Äù John <br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYJjH6Wmel4&amp;t=8m32s"">8:32</a>. Jesus wants to help you, personally. Ask Him. He promised here, ‚ÄúIf the Son delivers you, you will be <br />delivered for sure,‚Äù John 8:36. So what religion is going to deliver you? His name is Jesus Christ, Our <br />Savior. ‚ÄúLooking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith,‚Äù Hebrews 12:2. Amen. <br />Niko Man of God Sent by Christ to evangelize the whole world. <br />Email: etwcministry@<a href=""http://outlook.com/"">outlook.com</a> YOUTUBE: CLEVELAND STREET PREACHERS,,,",violinmaestro knight,2020-12-11T23:22:49Z,0

Jesus said, ‚ÄúYou must <br />truly repent and overcome your sins,‚Äù Mark 1:15. If you don‚Äôt, it will be the biggest mistake you ever <br />made. God through Jesus gave you grace to repent and to change. If you do not accept it, the grace cannot <br />do anything for you! There is no grace that permits you to disobey God. Do you understand? If God <br />permits disobedience and sin, then His kingdom will perish, including us. We do have an all-wise God <br />with a perfect knowledge, a perfect life, and a perfect kingdom. Nobody is permitted to destroy it! Sin <br />does not fit there. Remember, there is no sin in Jesus‚Äô faith, and this is the faith we must follow, no one <br />else. So take sin out of your brain to be able to fit there. There is no sin when we obey God. Sin starts from <br />disobedience to God, and He does not permit that! So we cannot disobey God. Here is the proof: When <br />Adam and Eve disobeyed God, He kicked them out of paradise. Do you see that? Do you see any grace <br />there? Does God change? Religion or no religion, God does not permit disobedience, and He proved it <br />many times. Get to the Word of God so you can see for yourself. Grace or no grace, God does not permit <br />sin. Disobedience separates us from God, and sin produces death, even your own death. This is what you <br />want? God wants to protect us. We must learn His wisdom, not mankind‚Äôs insanity. That‚Äôs why Jesus said <br />to the devil, ‚ÄúMan shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God,‚Äù <br />Matthew 4:4. Have you ever read that? It says every word that comes from God‚Äôs wisdom, not mine not <br />yours. So my friend, get to the wisdom of God, this is your life. The Gospel of Christ is the wisdom of God. <br />Start reading it every day, and do what Jesus tells you to do. He is the only True, Savior for the whole <br />world and for you. If you obey Jesus totally, then I will see you in heaven for sure, see Matthew 7:21. Jesus <br />gave a command, ‚ÄúIf you stay in my Word, you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free,‚Äù John <br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYJjH6Wmel4&amp;t=8m32s"">8:32</a>. Jesus wants to help you, personally. Ask Him. He promised here, ‚ÄúIf the Son delivers you, you will be <br />delivered for sure,‚Äù John 8:36. So what religion is going to deliver you? His name is Jesus Christ, Our <br />Savior. ‚ÄúLooking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith,‚Äù Hebrews 12:2. Amen. <br />Niko Man of God Sent by Christ to evangelize the whole world. <br />Email: etwcministry@<a href=""http://outlook.com/"">outlook.com</a> YOUTUBE: CLEVELAND STREET PREACHERS..",violinmaestro knight,2020-12-11T23:22:44Z,0

"FYI, you HAVE to cycle those goats out to other people..<br /><br />I was raised with goats as a kid and we didn&#39;t do that for a couple generations. We ended up with one goat that was a hermaphrodite. It had both parts. My dad couldn&#39;t understand. My mom had to explain to him that he had several generations of inbreeding going on. He was a little tipsy and couldn&#39;t get it. He&#39;s like ah hell they&#39;re just goats not like people. She said &quot;look, your little family tree out there ain&#39;t forking, you understand now?&quot; üòÇ<br /><br />After that, what really convinced him, was this one goat we had. Its body was normal, but the face..<br /><br />The snout area became shorter than normal, and goats sometimes have a fur pattern. This one had a certain pattern that went around the eyes and gave the impression that it looked like a man. Once my sister pointed it out to him, he got freaked out. The face actually looked like a cross between a person and goat. 90% goat of course, but a few subtle things here and there that you could definitely tell.<br /><br />EVEN family and friends that would come by would mention it here and there. &quot;damn goat is looking kinda weird man&quot; üòÇ<br /><br />After he sold some off and did a fair trade, things became normal again. But it is very strange. Not to mention the health. Had to call the veterinarian quite alot..",Davie Dood,2020-11-09T11:40:35Z,0

"Billion Dollar Income Potential in Ruvol<br /><br />I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished] that is guaranteed to be far more challenging and exciting to play than CHESS.  I called it ‚ÄúRUVOL.‚Äù  <br /><br />Over time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the ‚ÄúNumber One Board Game in the World.‚Äù <br /><br />Why am I so sure about this?  Because I am an avid chess player myself.  I found chess to be so repetitive that any clever player could easily master the moves to a point they can even play against opponents blindfolded.  It is exactly for this reason I invented a game where every game is always a new challenge and exciting to play. Ruvol, played somewhat like chess, requires more tactical skills than chess.<br /><br />The ‚ÄúGlobal Income Potential‚Äù of Ruvol is just mind-boggling!  <br /><br />In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  These are all potential buyers of Ruvol, eager to see how it compares to chess.  At an average profit of just US$5 per set, the ‚ÄúGlobal Income Potential‚Äù for the owner then is a whopping US$4 billion.  <br /><br />I AM SELLING MY COPYRIGHT TO RUVOL.  <br /><br />If you are interested to buy my copyright, don‚Äôt hesitate to give me your BEST PRICE OFFER.  Or if you know someone who might be interested, refer them to me; if they buy, you get a 10% commission.<br /><br />‚ÄúEarly bird catches the worm.‚Äù<br /><br />Thanks and God bless.<br /> <br />RODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL<br />The Ruvol Inventor<br /><br />rodolfovitangcol@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a>",The Attitudinalist,2020-10-17T12:19:47Z,0

What I observed when interacting with Bedouin families in Kuwait.  When women have to work outside you can&#39; stick them in a Burqa-chadari and expect to get the work done.  Bedou women receive more respect than in the  urban environment of the Arab world.  They are so kind and friendly and the love between family members is obvious.,Celt Jade,2020-10-15T01:23:11Z,0

I love Islam and Muslims and the middle East is beautiful. It&#39;s so different from the American deserts. The American deserts are full of bushes cacti things like that it&#39;s kind of interesting to see the land completely bare there&#39;s a kind of foreboding beauty to it. On one hand the desert is dangerous on the other hand it&#39;s beautiful.,Kent Vene.,2021-01-24T02:12:28Z,1

"Eva I enjoyed this so much, I currently live in New York and I am now a mother of 5 children ages 10-22 but at one time I was a little dessert nomad child. I used to caravan with my Great Aunt Marrila, and my Great Uncle Warren and my Great Grandmother. It was the best years of my young life. Eventually they got too old and passed away, luckily I was pretty old then around 12-12 so I was able to fend for myself, but my heart yearns for this life again. It is something that I can not even properly describe for my children my past nomadic life , they have only known the comforts and buzz of America and NYC at that.

Just a simple life filled with freedom and no ‚Äúhuman‚Äù laws, but only following what God had told us not to do and what to do. I would love the warmth of the sand and the natural cold air I‚Äôm getting every night, the clean environment and far away from the crowed too.

"This is how our ancestors lived, The life of our ancestors was nothing like our lives today in the gulf. They worked hard to live, they were either near the sea or in the deserts, never resting. Today after the oil, every one is just so lazy, arrogant,materialistic and the biggest problem in our society today is that we depend on everyone on everything.",Kahled 123q8,2020-06-20T02:58:33Z,0

"When I had my first omra to mecca and medina, I was restless when I&#39;m not seeing much greenery of jungle and forest that I grew up surrounded with. Even Mecca and Medina still have some greens, yet this family in this video were totally in the middle sea of sands. I can stand prison since i had experienced it during my previous naughty adolescence, but I can&#39;t stand looking at sea of rocks and sand without greenery. Even if I was to be treated like a king in the desert, my mind will break not long after since I can&#39;t live without thick greenery and lush jungle. I think I probably have a phobia or some sort. Arabs or anyone who lives in the desert, my hats off to you.",lagubrok92,2020-06-16T23:28:55Z,0

"@Iori kasanuga Thank for sharing your thoughts and experience in Oman. Im living in Malaysia and I have many Muslim friends too. They never complained about this practice and never did I hear about the complications due to this practice. I also think what is being practiced here is the same in Oman, the doctor will perform a tiny slit on the prepuce and there is no such thing as cutting the clitoris or labia. I don&#39;t know that it enhances sexual pleasure because I have been told that it is the opposite.",Sara Foo,2021-02-25T19:09:31Z,0
"i lived in Omani villages few years back..i saw what they practice is they cut a tiny bit of tissue around the clitoris to make it more exposed..not cutting the clitoris completely/or labia minora for that matter..it&#39;s just the clitoral hood they cut..it is not practiced by all Omanis, and it is not prescribed in islam..it is some local practice done by some families..yes there is risk of causing more injury and infection(though they uses new blade that is sterilised with fire)..but in general they never need to come to hospital for any bleeding/infection issues..contrary to what you are protraying,that the purpose is to devoid the girls of any sexual pleasure..i think it is actually done to enhance their ability to feel the pleasure..i worked as a g.p. (foreigner,not Omani) in those deserts for 6 years",Iori kasanuga,2021-02-13T06:28:01Z,1

"@shula may Salam sister, thank you very much for your concern for us and our safety, you are beautiful person, I agree that fear for your safety is a form of oppression not what the muslim men impose on us necessarily but by men in general, I remember the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo"">#metoo</a> movement in the west and all over the world  and see how much the wisdom of my religion with regards to the distancing between men and women and lessening unnecessary interaction that would lead to opression of women (like sexual harrassment) as is exemplified by the metoo movement were women become helpless and at the mercy of indecent men and forced to be silenced in many cases because of being shamed by their own society (which I really sympathize with and I pray for all those women healing and strength), for us muslim women we see these things as THE oppression of men. Fortunately, our religion empowers us by telling us a way to avoid these unfortunate happenings cause if we are physically distant from men, they would have less chances of doing physical harm such as sexual harrassment. I live in a secular country which is dominated by the Christian faith (Philippines P. S I love our Christian brothers and sisters) by the way and I still impose this segraegation/distancing on myself whenever possible because the lust and indecency of men trancend religion, race and country. I pray and hope that oppression of women by men all over the world would end and women would be TRULY empowered to battle these oppressions.",Irshada Hasan,2020-07-11T22:17:32Z,0
"@Irshada Hasan <br />That is very sad, and of course I understand that the more dangerous men are to women in your society, you would feel less comfortable socializing with them, but that IS opression. When you are restricted in your behaviour because you fear for your safety, that is opression.<br /> It happenes everywhere, of course, but some places are safer for women then others.. I don&#39;t feel as threatened where I live and with the kinds of people I hang out with in comparison to the state of fear that you&#39;re describing.",shula may,2020-07-11T18:34:09Z,2

"Islamophobics say that our beloved Prophet (SAW) made Islam so he could indulge in wealth and abundance in his life and do as he pleases when infact even as a governor of Medina he and as great ruler with so many followers he lived his life like this simple and even more so less than what they the Bedouin family have. As long as he could have a roof to sleep on, and a food he could eat. Even as the Prophet (SAW) only had a little of wealth and food he would still give to the poor and those in need and take care of guest when they visit. For he knows God rewards those who do good.",That kid on the block,2020-04-27T08:02:47Z,2

They were born Bedouins and will die with their own style of living.<br /><br />That bread you had is called: Malla bread. It&#39;s pronounced in Arabic as: Khubz Malla. It&#39;s very tasty because of it&#39;s smoky flavor. You can dip it in honey, stew of your choice, cheese or just have it plain with some tea and you&#39;ll never have enough with it. It&#39;s just a simple dough made of flour, water, 2-3 tbl spn cooking oil and a sprinkle of salt. Dig a small hole on a sandy ground, and set fire with coal. I&#39;ll write a title of the method of preparation (in Arabic) so you can (copy and paste) and search youtube for it (it&#39;s self explanatory) :<br />ÿ∑ÿ±ŸäŸÇÿ© ÿÆÿ®ÿ≤ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÑÿ©<br /><br />And yeah, Bedouins are known for their hospitality, generosity (they offer what they have even though they are not wealthy) and known for their kindness.They are genuine people by nature, humble, no hatred, no discrimination, no fancy brands, no McDonald&#39;s (lol) and just love to live their life peacefully.",Ahmad,2020-04-13T20:21:22Z,118

I like you three days visit programme in Oman desert .it was a quite loving video shoot and everything made very easily filmised from morning till night about the livings and food stuffs and routinely work out .unique collection of memories. Really very thrilling and challenging to survive in the desert area .it only for you to have there days stay .moreover these family lives there permanently and faces the crises and challenges of the nature. Absolutley you covered up thes people .but while going and searching these areas. You may make aware of latest technologies which are helpful for their livings .you must do it .it is very nice .,Subhash Rawat,2020-04-04T19:17:23Z,0

"Not as harsh as it would have been if they hadn&#39;t a vehicle to tranport them around, or a generator to extract water from the well, or a stove to cook food and food stocks that comes from a city not depending solely on their camels and goats for food! Oh, and a TV and satellite dish for intertainment, lol.  Surely, its a comfort life in the middle of the desert for a typical Bedouin life. I feel the interference of modern life has changed the organic way of life for the survival of Bedouins in the desert or how it used to be in the old days. I was wondering if these little girls go to school? They seem very sharp, especially the little one, Hayat :)",Diane K,2020-03-14T09:46:21Z,1

Sharing a plate a food with people who wipe their ass with their bare hands is not a good idea. Also that extra room for the women to be in is because they are made to be there cause they have no rights at all.

Your such an inspiration for my dream to become a blogger as well. While watching your story with the Bedouin family, I was able to gather some strength and ideas for myself as well on the positivity side of life. And that little girl is such a cutie, and you two are meant to establish a lifelong bond together. She will always remember you for the rest of her life. You seem like a great sister to that little girl. I have seen so many bloggers all over, but your expressions are so different in terms of being so brilliant in your work.

they are there for fun not for living <br />my parents was bedouin. the bedouin live in valleys and grass lands,ali ali,2020-02-05T16:20:17Z,0
@ali ali <br />It is clear that they live in this area because of that precious source  of water since they buy food for animals as we saw in the video. It seems that water is very expensive in that part of the world. The family cultivates animals (camels and goats) to sell in the market. It is their source of income.,al Dallika,2020-02-06T06:04:58Z,0
al Dallika <br />the source of water and the source of food for the animals,ali ali,2020-02-06T05:50:24Z,0
"@ali ali <br />In fact, they are not Bedouin since they do not travel. To be a Bedouin you have to carry your tents and move from one place to another looking for water and grass. I think this family is a part of a tribe that lives in the same area and share the same source of water. And because the area is safe so there is no need to construct their houses close to each other . Just think about their source of water. I do not believe they own it. It was there for long time",al Dallika,2020-02-06T05:28:39Z,0

So believe in God and His messengers and do not speak of a ‚ÄòTrinity‚Äô- stop [this], that is better for you- God is only one God, He is far above having a son, everything in the heavens and earth belongs to Him and He is the best one to trust.&quot;",Faizan Khan,2020-01-08T20:31:41Z,1

First time I saw a nomadic family eshtablishment in the desert. Thanks for sharing their lives beautifully. It would have been more interesting if few things were answered related to their lives. Why the herd of livestock kept so far away from their place? Why not residing near the water well? Why they have choosen a life like this since many of them moved out to the modern (populated) world? I mean these are few questions appear when someone views the video and by doing this you can make us understand their lives better.,Ashish Poddar,2020-01-04T05:11:20Z,0

"@John Galt don&#39;t blame you honestly....... going off topic people think being born in eastern countries life is hard and women and children have no rights thats the reason people think its the religion but Islam teaches us to be kind to love your fellow neighbour&#39;s to not fight the innocents. Our prophet said a white man has not superiority over a black man and a black man has no superiority over a white man and that a arab has no superiority over a non-arab and a non-arab has no superiority over a arab. If you knew the rights the women of Islam has you would be surprised. One person asked the prophet Mohammed PBUH &quot;who comes after God&quot; the prophet replied &quot;Your Mother&quot; then the person asked &quot;next&quot; the prophet replied &quot; your mother &quot;2x   the prophet replied 3 times for mother then father as last once....so its God, mother, mother, mother and father.",Shaheryar Ahmed,2020-01-01T23:14:50Z,0

"@MARTIN HAMILTON quite the contrary , gatherings are segregated because in that part of the world men and women are vastly different. Men speak in a very topic oriented manner and may discuss a single point or topic for a prolonged period of time in great detail and from many aspects. Women on the other hand discuss a variety of topics less extensively. Those two put together serve the unity of man and woman, one being precise and accurate, and the other covering more diverse ground. But at the same time their meetings cannot be held together otherwise none of them can achieve their conversational role and would cause men to either be more womanized in their thinking or women to get very quickly bored from the consistency of the conversation of men.

"Technically, they do not have electricity.....they have solar, which is not the same thing.  In this case they have a small panel, probably 100-200W that will run only the dish and TV.  They might have a frig..probably propane because small solar systems will not run big appliances.  So take into account 100-200W is probably all they have available and only for several hours a day as the batteries have to charge.",Elementaldomain,2019-12-26T16:53:57Z,0

"@Fra Dee Let me share a different perspective with you.  It is actually you who are in a 100x&#39;s more danger than I.  Living in the city is a virtual, literal prison.  You are at the mercy of people and companies over which you have no control whatsoever.  People in cities are no longer safe to leave their homes. People are getting shot in Walmart, in schools, at the workplace. It is no wonder people are anxious and experience paranoia on a 24 hour basis.  Eventually this shows up in the physical health as well does it not?  A body can only sustain so much emotional strain before it begins to break down.<br /><br />I can store large amounts of water, can a person in the city do that?  Can a person in the city store large amounts of food or have the ability to grow more if there should be a shortage of food?  I can store petrol and I do.  I have a pony and cart, I can get to a lot of places should the petrol run out.  If my electricity goes out, I have solar - a frig, a freezer, an evaporative cooler.  I have over 20 canopies with 90% shade cloth, so even if I was to have to ration water, I would still have a nice place under my fruit trees, that are under canopies.....to spend my summer days.  I have goats, ducks.....they provide enough food along with the fruit and vegetables that I can live a fairly normal life no matter what happens.  You might want to read up on air to water production.....we can do that on vast scales here in rural areas?  Can people in the city do this......they can not do this even in normal times.....what would happen if there was a long term situation?<br /><br />I think also you are not familiar with different kinds of desert.  We are not Las Vegas - LOL, that is lower desert which has higher temperatures and sparse vegetation.  You should see the Higher Desert in spring.  You cannot see the ground because it is covered with wild flowers.  I keep bees also.  I will never be too hot or too cold here even if everything should fail in the system. All of my trees, everything I grow, are in pots and all trees are dwarfed so they take very little water to grow.<br /><br />You just have become used to the prison and have developed an insensitivity to the danger.  And it is not paranoia to use common sense.  You should have food, water, tools, a makeshift solar oven, blankets and clothing in your car at all times.  That is just smart.  I lived in the wilderness for 20 years by myself, you just learn to be smart so that should anything happen, you are prepared.<br /><br />Here is a link to my blog should you like to further talk.  <a href=""https://expressionsoftheheartfarm.blogspot.com/2019/12/and-here-we-go.html"">https://expressionsoftheheartfarm.blogspot.com/2019/12/and-here-we-go.html</a>.  The Bedouins are not afraid of the desert, they have learned to work with Nature, they are actually safer than you - LOL.",Elementaldomain,2020-01-01T15:20:02Z,1
"@Elementaldomain sounds pretty good. I&#39;d probably carry 5 gallons of water in my car if I ever lived there, just in case my car breaks down. Do you store water, in case something weird goes down and your grid water supply is cut off? I drove with a lot of water during my drive to Las Vegas, last summer. Paranoia. <br /><br />It&#39;s amazing how you can grow that many fruit/nut trees. I live in the bay area, growing several fruit trees myself. I&#39;d grow more, but out of space in my townhouse yard. Nextdoor neighbors are literally stuck to us. We share the same walls. Never enough parking spaces.<br /> I&#39;ve resorted to planting in public parks, but occasionally the gardeners chop down my plants. How dare they. I like to grow root vegetables... potatoes, sunchokes, etc. in these public areas.<br /><br />You have any pics of your property? <br />I take it back that I wouldn&#39;t live in the desert,  but I would store so much water.",Fra Dee,2020-01-01T03:38:47Z,0
"@Fra Dee About 30 minutes out of Yucca Valley, which is at 3400&#39; above Palm Springs.  Water has never been an issue here.  It came as a huge surprise when a good deal of Northern California, especially those beautiful scenic areas like the Joaquin Valley, Porterville, etc, ran out of water.  But in retrospect it should not have come as a surprise.  The farmers up that way acted like they would never run out of water and acted accordingly, growing crops like almonds which is unwise.<br /><br />I have about 50 fruit and nut trees, and grow hydroponic seasonal crops.  The weather here is optimal for growing and it is very rural so not a lot of neighbors, which is nice because I don&#39;t have to worry about people growing GMO crops or using deadly pesticides.  We get winters with a normal high around 50-60 during the day and summers are usually around 95.<br /><br />Yes, it was very affordable but is becoming less so.  I paid $6,000 for 2-1/2 acres.  My taxes are $250 a year.  With the temperate weather in the winter and I have sun facing windows in the cabin, I never need supplemental heat.  Summers are great too, only having to use evaporative coolers.<br /><br />We get more water here per user than anyone else in California. We get our water from the same sources as L.A. does but we have fewer people.  I see water becoming a big issue for every one else but us.  We get quite a bit of snow here in the winter too, we just got 12&quot; last week.",Elementaldomain,2019-12-31T23:53:47Z,1
"@Elementaldomain where do you get water to farm in the California desert? I too live in Cali, but that&#39;s the only area I wouldn&#39;t move to. I don&#39;t like the lack of naturally occurring water sources for long term occupancy. Acreage in the area is pretty affordable, that&#39;s one benefit.",Fra Dee,2019-12-31T22:33:07Z,0
"You can.  Its a matter of mind set, of consciousness.  It takes a person who always sees the glass as half full, not half empty.  Only self-starters, self-disciplined people can live this way of life.  I am a single woman farmer living in the High Desert of California. I have electricity, but also solar.  I do not have any big, electricity hogging appliances. I wouldn&#39;t live any other way. My life is Happy, Peace-Full and fairly slow moving.  My shower is outside inside a small greenhouse, even on a winter day, its 70 in there. I have time to watch the sunset. I couldn&#39;t ask for anything more. The first decision is what can you tolerate, and what can you not? I do not like humidity, or lots of bugs swarming around.....so I choose desert instead of tropical or the South of the U.S.  I do  not like cold, so I do not live in Minnesota.  That is the most important decision, every thing else comes easy.",Elementaldomain,2019-12-26T17:50:52Z,1

"It is no more challenging than any woman (or man) who lives off grid in the U.S. Or farms. I have days I work 12 hours, I have days I sit under the trees and read all day after the chores are done in the morning.  All in all, our lives are less busy than city people who don&#39;t really own anything.  They don&#39;t own their house, their car, or all the stuff inside the house. We do. We don&#39;t HAVE to work 40-60 hours a week to pay a bank for our house, our car, etc. We have a secure life.......can you say the same?",Elementaldomain,2019-12-26T18:19:13Z,0

They have all their needs and necessities met, what more do they need?  They don&#39;t work 60 hours a week or have to work to pay a mortgage. No one is going to kick them out if they can&#39;t pay the rent or the mortgage. They have food. Meat, milk. Will you if there is a nature cataclysm...no drinkable water, no food, no electricity? Every geographical region has good weather and bad weather.  I live in the desert.....there are a lot more pluses than minuses.  City people are living lives of fantasy.

"I can&#39;t help but notice how she said she&#39;s going into the wild and unknown and far from all the comforts of modern living, without electricity and running water? And right the next minute, she&#39;s showing us around the house which is more luxurious than mine, with satellite TV and nicely segregated living quarters. Besides they just drove an hour from the city and reached their wildly secluded destination. I bet I could walk back into the city in just under a day. I was hoping for a more rudimentary and more authentic experience into the unknown? Much respect for the Bedouin family roughing it out in the desert but this was not what I expected. They live like just on the outskirts of town, with many modern amenities, with satellite TV, with state of the art solar panels system, with generators to source water, lots of livestock and land cruisers lying about their more than adequately insulated tent houses?

"I&#39;m Somali and we have similar culture. Myself, I grew up in an environment similar to this. Some people are probably wondering why they didn&#39;t build brick and mortar house since they almost have everything else. Well these are pastoralist people. They move around meaning permanent structures are not part of the life style.<br /><br />Where I&#39;m from (eastern parts of Ethiopia called Somali Region), it&#39;s not a desert. <br /><br />Omanis are wonderful people with rich history and culture. They once ruled many parts of Arabia and east Africa. Even in Somalia they came and played important role in Somali society.<br /><br />Much love",Hawd DDSI Ethio,2019-12-20T03:02:01Z,1

Loved the video and you have a wonderful personality...just the perfect person to make this documentary. It was professionally well done and the quality was outstanding. If you do not mind my comment (50+ years as professional photographer)....the video in the intro was somewhat shaky and not a stable as later videos. I would suggest that instead of a selfie stick (guessing that is what you are using) and switch to a gimbal it will give you steadier shots and in the video editor you can use the stabilization setting for steadier videos.

"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYJjH6Wmel4&amp;t=6m19s"">6:19</a> the modern formulation of the Kohel is not the same as the one used by Cleopatra. the following article describes the study that discovered this information while leaving out key portions of the study. the rest has been removed from web access. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />By            Richard Alleyne, Science Correspondent<br /><br />3:55PM GMT 08 Jan 2010<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Researchers now believe that Egyptians applied the eyeliner 4,000 years ago in order to ward off infections. <br /><br /> Lead salts in the make-up helped to protect against eye disease, the French study claims. <br /><br /> The &quot;smokey eyes&quot; look favoured by ancient Egyptians such as Cleopatra is one of the most enduring in fashion. <br /><br /> But the researchers at the Louvre museum in Paris believe it was originally for medical reasons as much as aesthetics. <br /><br /> Their study, published in the journal Analytical Chemistry, suggests it helped to protect against eye disease. <br /><br /> The key appears to be lead salts contained in the make-up. <br /><br /> At very low levels, salts produce nitric oxide, which boosts the immune system to fight off bacteria which can cause eye infection. <br /><br /> The make-up used by the ancient Egyptians to darken and enhance the eyes sometimes took up to a month to concoct. <br /><br /> In theory, because it contained lead it might actually have posed a risk to health. <br /><br /> But an analysis by scientists led by Philippe Walter showed that at low doses it had a protective effect. <br /><br /> He said: &quot;We knew ancients Greeks and Romans too had noted the make-up had medicinal properties, but wanted to determine exactly how.&quot; <br /><br /> The researchers used a tiny electrode, a 10th of the thickness of a human hair, to look at the effect of lead chloride salt synthesised by the Egyptians ‚Äì laurionite ‚Äì on a single cell. <br /><br /> &quot;In stimulating non-specific immunological defences, one may argue that these lead compounds were deliberately manufactured and used in ancient Egyptian formulations to prevent and treat eye illnesses by promoting the action of immune cells,&quot; they said. <br /><br /> It is also thought that Galena, the natural mineral form of lead sulphite, was used as eye make up known as kohl and possesses antiseptic and fly-deterrent properties as well as protecting the eyes from intense sun.",darren marchant,2019-12-18T18:57:36Z,0

"Z M sorry I came across as what I didn‚Äôt mean. I meant was that in these stupid countries, so called Muslim countries, where Islam is supposed to be practised but instead tradition is practised. I don‚Äôt mind tradition if it doesn‚Äôt contradict or go against Islam. But what I am trying to say is that just because someone is Muslim it doesn‚Äôt mean they are following Islam, they could be following their tradition instead, so my point is that not to have that assumption. Because a lot of things get done under tradition which is not really morally correct but people think it‚Äôs what Islam teaches when in infact Islam is against it as well. <br /><br />You sound so ignorant here, NO, <br />NOT ALL WESTERN WOMEN GO TO WORK BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO, ITS BECAUSE THEY CHOOSE TO. IT‚ÄôS NOTHING TO DO WITH BILLS OR PAYING THEIR SHARE, it‚Äôs just that they want to use their brain more, not do jobs everyday that doesn‚Äôt require much of their brain power. Seriously, you sound like them non-Muslims who think all Muslim women are forced to wear hijab.<br /><br />I got many non-Muslim and Muslim friends where they go to work because they want to do something for themselves, NOTHING TO DO WITH PAYING FOR ANY EXPENSES OR ANY PRESSURE FROM HUSBANDS. Muslim women can work as long it‚Äôs within halal environment so please stop this lecture about women not working for someone else‚Äôs business. And yes, there are many jobs where I seen a Muslim woman is able to work in halal environment as long as she knows the boundaries and have to be less picky about which job she does.",Not Sure,2019-12-23T03:54:27Z,0
"@Not Sure No tradition doesn&#39;t take over religion for all. Maybe for some who choose to follow their traditions instead which should not be attributed to the religion then. I didn&#39;t see very hard labor. And this labor they do is for their own homes, not for some corporation or factory etc. <br />Women really don&#39;t CHOOSE to work in the west. I know I live here. And most women HAVE to work because in this way of life and mentality, women are responsible for their own maintenance and those of their families. So western women work 40 plus hours a week, have babies and only get 6 weeks off before having to go back to work, and then are expected to also pay bills and do the housework. This definitely should be criticized. It&#39;s unfair and its oppressive but few speak to this injustice and accept it. I don&#39;t. And as Muslims we are supposed to speak out against this, or what you called &quot;preaching&quot;. Most if not all the women I know would rather not HAVE to work but they are forced to because the western society especially in the US isn&#39;t supportive of families. Wages are low and housing costs are high, you pay for health care etc etc. SO the criticism is on the way of life in the US that oppresses families especially women and children. Yes I will continue to &quot;preach&quot;. Women need to know this is wrong so changes can be made. I would rather work for myself like these women, on my terms and within my control, then under corporate America. Been there done that. No thank you. I am grateful to accept Islam as my way of life that allows me with the blessing of my rights as a women being respected and honored. We don&#39;t live according to our &quot;tradition&quot;.",Z M,2019-12-22T14:14:02Z,0
"Z M I am a Muslim too. Stop with the lecture, tradition takes over religion, just because this is in a ISLAMIC country that doesn‚Äôt mean they follow everything of Islam. Most of these people follow their traditions over religion. I asked the question what do men do? I think some of these jobs these women are doing are very hard labour, therefore women should not be doing it. <br /><br />In the West women CHOOSE to work, they are not forced to. Whether a woman chooses to work or not work, it should not be criticised either way.",Not Sure,2019-12-20T17:11:12Z,0

Eva: there is no electricity <br />Also Eva: here is the TV and satellite,M. Ali G.,2019-12-16T08:46:07Z,13
"@Moon Striker I have an older TV like that, it uses 100W.  The propane cylinder is to the right, the orange tank.  Those kind of knobs on the stove are propane knobs as they ignite the igniter when they turn. FYI, an electric stove consumers at least 3000W with a 5000W+ surge.....not possible to have an electric stove out there, even with solar.  Well, it would take about an acre of solar panels for one big appliance.  Residential solar will not run big appliances like stoves and AC.  Propane stoves BTW, have their burners quite aways down inside the enclosure - mine is 4 inches.....its a safety precaution so that if for some reason the propane is on too long before the igniter strikes, it will not blow you up. You don&#39;t need big flames on a propane stove like a normal residential stove in a city, propane is hotter than natural gas. ¬†<br /><br />If you will look at the storage shelf where the pots are, you can see that all the bottoms are black - electric stoves do not burn the bottom of a pan like that, only propane or natural gas.",Elementaldomain,2019-12-26T18:54:41Z,0
"@Elementaldomain Mr. NA edukashion: old TVs consume far more electricity than new ones. Old leds consumed as much as CRTs, 3-4 times more than new ones, ~150w for a small 28&#39;&#39;. They also seem to have an electric stove (she was cooking, no flames, no gas cylinder ).  &quot;It is always wise to actually know what you are talking about Dear&quot; lmao :)",Moon Striker,2019-12-26T18:05:49Z,0
"@Moon Striker It is always wise to actually know what you are talking about Dear.  First of all, they probably have a 100-200 watt solar setup, which includes batteries that hold a charge when the sun is not shining.  Its an OLD Tv, so it probably doesn&#39;t require more than 75 watts or so.  Their frig is most likely a propane frig.  I would imagine they use the TV for practical things like weather and news, not entertainment.  With a small solar setup like that, which isn&#39;t expensive, especially there, where solar is much cheaper than the U.S.....they could run the TV 1-2 hours a day.",Elementaldomain,2019-12-26T17:16:08Z,0
