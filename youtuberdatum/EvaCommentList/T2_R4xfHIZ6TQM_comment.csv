Yayy! Aren&#39;t we all just totally in love with Liria? This is the start of a mini-series of 3 Albanian vlogs before we wrap up the year on a high note! Lots of love and warmth to you all 🙂,Eva zu Beck,2020-12-13T16:21:12Z,567
Boa tarde amiga eva zu..você parece que gosta de praticar traking. Meus parabéns. Olha menina bonita eu gosto muito de andar de bicicleta pela minha região Botucatu sp. E um lugar de muita serra. E muito legal. Olha gostei muito de seus vidios. Você está fazendo aquilo que gosta. Fico feliz pôr você. Eu gosto de andar de bicicleta. Olha as vezes faço igual a você. Faço caminhada até pôr  40 km. Agora com essa pandemia do coronavirus. Manero um pouco. Mas de vez em quando dou uma escapada. Parabéns amiga linda. Obrigada abraço Brasil,Jãnio Andrade,2021-04-26T18:05:06Z,0

"Eva zu Beck, If you love this, then one day you should hike through the mountains of Greece from Mount Tymfi, Mount Smolikas, Mount Grammos, to Tzoumerka mountains, to over the Pindus mountains, Acheloos valley, to Agrafa mountains, to Karpenisi with Mountain Velouchi, to Mount Giona, Mount Varousia, to Parnassos Mountain. Hundreds of kilometers of untouched mountain beauties and incredible sceneries. Check it out. It would take you weeks to do, but it will be a trip you will never forget",Ptolemy336VV,2021-04-09T00:52:32Z,0

"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4xfHIZ6TQM&amp;t=5m54s"">5:54</a> min. &quot;the thing I fear the most - shepherd dogs&quot;.  Actually, you should feel some comfort around shepherd dogs.  Those dogs are highly trained to protect the flock from danger.  Their interest in you is passing curiosity.  However, their training keeps them alert to potential danger.  The dogs (most likely) will not approach you - even if you call them.<br /><br />These dogs have a loyalty to service, to protect the sheep (or goats).  They will not stray far from their charge.<br /><br />PS: hiking and travelling are best ways to learn, and enjoy what you learn.  Make it a life-long habit, and you will learn wonderful things to help you with life&#39;s journey.  God Bless you Eva on your travels.<br /><br />PPS: good video - thumbs up.",Fritz Smith,2021-04-16T05:09:57Z,0
"Robisz fajną robotę. Profi ujecia, dynamika, ciekawie. Mucha nie siada. Mam jednak wrażenie, że pędzisz i za jakis czas nie bedzie miejsca do przepędzenia. Myslę, że zwolninie da nową jakośc dla Ciebie i filmów. Chodzi mi o to, że jak zastawisz stół dobrym jedzeniem i czytając szybko poranne wiadomości popędzisz na miasto ma inny wymiar jak usiądziesz i podelektujesz się chrupiącym chlebkiem z masłem i serem. Podróżuję i pamietam jak inni pędzili i zwiedzali muzea, kościoły itp ja siedziałem na krawężniku jadłem swieżą bułke z pobliskiego sklepiku i chłonąłem ulice. Na spokojnie. Inne zwiedzanie podrózowanie jest jak pędzisz a inne jak się zatrzymasz i pożyjesz na slowly. Taka uwaga. Pobyć i zobaczyc więcej w miejscu. Ten film jest  w miarę wolniejszy, mówię ogólnie  do Twego całego dorobku. Dobrego dnia :)",Grzegorz Markowski,2021-04-15T06:22:46Z,0

"This video literally made me cry. You must know that albanians have always suffered back in history. Foreign countries haven&#39;t been so nice to us, they only divided my country in half, left half of territories outside the albania current borders... Etc etc.. despite that, we never attacked or hated them, it fills our heart when we see tourist enter in our homeland. We are not so nice to each other, like with foreign strangers, i have to say that... Thanks for the amazing video. I am glad you enjoyed it in Albania.

I&#39;ve travelled some countries in Europe  <br />I&#39;m living in UK England for the last 15 years  .<br />What I&#39;ve seen on those country&#39;s  kids they don&#39;t respect the parents  are very could to wich other  the don&#39;t even know the back round family. <br />But in albanian  the culture is different  we know how to respect  parents  back round family  oll ways we respect the biggest brother   just different compere to other country&#39;s  .<br />But I thing slowly slowly  we start losing this respect  with this new generation,Shahin Palushi,2021-01-20T21:38:38Z,0

"If Albanians find a solo woman travelling through Albania , they immediately take charge of her. <br />It&#39;s in their nature to protect a single woman traveller, foreign from the area even if she is an Albanian from another part of Albania.<br />Usually, even if you are an Albanian and you are travelling not around your area, but to another part of Albania which might be new for you, people immediately get concerned, help you and find you a nice shelter.<br />My dad was a lorry driver all his life( a pensioner now) and he used to bring home passengers who couldn&#39;t get to their destinations. It was a normal thing to us to have strangers passing the night at our little home, eating and sleeping for free and my mum cooking something nicer than normal to welcome them properly.<br />This is a part of Albanian tradition. <br />A foreigner is vulnerable in Albanian mentality and it is an honour to take care and protect him until he gets to his home and his people.",Liljana Sufaj,2021-01-15T22:38:08Z,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4xfHIZ6TQM&amp;t=5m52s"">5:52</a>  😅       As a kid growing up in Albania, getting past them damn guard dogs was a challenge every time I would go hiking with my friends. Or even when going to the outskirts of the city! <br /><br />Wast majority of the time they do not bite though. <br />Them dogs are like an alarm system, alerting the owners about the presence of a stranger in the area. <br /><br />You must keep a cool head and just keep walking past the dogs. <br />If they get too close, put something between them and you. A bag or even an open umbrella will be enough usually. <br /><br />NEVER RUN!! Running away from a chasing dog is the worst thing you can do. <br /><br />A guy cycling somewhere in Greece got the scare of his life when he was surrounded by 15 or 20 barking dogs! 😅<br />They did not bite him though. Only barked at him.",ToxicVaccines ToxicFluoride HIV HOAX,2021-01-13T21:58:52Z,1

I agree with tour comment about some people and media making traveling seem like a treath and worsening the pandemia but You have to understand that today&#39;s global social situation only increases the chances of distribuiting the virus.  The fact that one minute You can be standing in China and a couple of hours later be in Europe can only help a pandemia ay spreading the virus. The only thing that needs to be done temporarily is to decrease travel.  This coming from a person who has traveled and lived in Many places througout the world.

The mountains there are tree-less because in  communist Albania people and the state was so poor that allowed people to chop down trees for heating reasons.

However u havnt taken ur shihada yet is beyond me. Allah has blessed u with an opportunity to travel and mix with people. Rather than embracing all these cultures and countries you should embrace Islam as ur faith only then are u a true champion in life... failing that u have failed ur whole test sister. May Allah guide u to the streight path. Ameen. If u dnt embrace Islam i feel that perhaps u are going out and exploiting the muslims hospitality to ur advantage. U should know ur only fooling urself. Allah has put Islam on a plate 4u. Please accept the truth. Dont do an injustice to urself. I hope u dnt take my words in a bad way i actually love u and think ur amazing i just want the best 4u.,Paj Don,2021-01-01T22:59:25Z,0

"who has knowledge of the ancient Illyrians will understand that the Albanians have remained the same as the former Illyrians, as Byron writes, friendly with the friend, and bloodthirsty with the enemy.<br />“Farewell, Albania, I thought. You have given me so much hospitality, refuge, friends and adventure. Farewell, Albania. One day I will tell the world how brave, fearless, strong, and faithful your sons are; how death and the devil can’t frighten them. If necessary, I’ll tell how they protected a refugee and wouldn’t allow her to be harmed even if it meant loosing their lives. The gates of your small country remain open, Albania. Your authorities closed their eyes, when necessary to give poor, persecuted people another chance to survive the most horrible of all wars. Albania, we survived the siege because of your humanity. We thank you”. Irene Grünbaum<br /> thank you EVA",orion genesis,2021-01-01T01:13:35Z,1

"In 2000 I started meeting a lot of Albanians who had come to England. I loved their warmth and hospitality. I quickly learned their language and in 2003 I went to Tirana for a short holiday. I loved it so much I didn&#39;t want to go home. In 2004 I sold my house, left England, and came to live in Tirana. I love it so much! I could never go back to living in England again. I haven&#39;t travelled to the place in your video so I really enjoyed watching it.",Sandra Dixon,2020-12-24T21:37:07Z,255

At least once a year I am blessed to be able to travel to a far away place (in the US wilderness) and just explore.  Sadly I suffered a spinal cord injury and am unable to push myself to those long treks. Thank you for this adventure.  I think its funny, yet interesting that you ran across that wonderful woman. that allowed you to stay in her home. I too have ran across similar people with the same human kindness.

The loveliest video of them all. I wouldn&#39;t be so brave as to walk that by myself. The kindness reminds me of the northern Caucasus where I was told to not worry if there is or isn&#39;t a guesthouse in any village where I was going. &quot;Knock on a door!&quot; I was told. That&#39;s all: knock on a door and of course the owner of the house will have you in and feed you and treat you like family. Same in the mountains of Vietnam. The same in the Sinai among the Beduins. People (poor people) are good. Thank you for the Albanian chapter.,Paul Miller,2020-12-17T13:36:11Z,0
About the welcoming just think of that like this most Albania youngers go to immigration and their parents wish for someone to welcome them there so they welcome you it&#39;s like a karma thing (I think) - and about the shepherd who talk to you about his nephews hi was probably saying - &quot;my nephew is about your age&quot; anyway have a pleasant staying in my country.,To Knight,2020-12-17T13:35:45Z,0

"In Albania we have an honor system called Besa, going back hundreds of years when the region was divided into tribes. One of the rules is that you always have a bed made in your house to welcome any guest or traveler that needs it. It is the reason why Albania is the only country in Europe to have had more Jews at the end of WW2 as opposed to when it started",Taylor Zdruli,2020-12-16T00:56:02Z,126

"@Ted Mosbyy 84  It precedes Ottoman times, it&#39;s a very ancient tradition that all Albanians have (including those outside of Albania proper, like Albanians in Kosovo, North Macedonia,  Montenegro). Besa (doesn&#39;t have a English translation but you can translate it as an Oath), when you give Besa to someone, it&#39;s better to die keeping it then braking it and living without an honor. It&#39;s not uncommon that Albanian died to save strangers jusr because they gave them the Besa, the gentleman above mentioned the Jews, many Albanians were persecuted for helping them, but they couldn&#39;t care less).",Liridon Ceka,2021-02-26T01:14:41Z,7

Because the camera is like a companion and a method of communication because you talk to it in hopes that it will reach viewers around the world.

"If you go to Albania, especially into Albanian villages in the mountains, you&#39;ll find these people everywhere.<br />Big customs in Albania regarding hospitality. My dad was a lorry driver( pensioner now) in Albania and he used to bring home passengers who couldn&#39;t get to their final destinations. It was pretty normal for us to have strangers eating and sleeping in my home. My mum cooked the best food for them and gave them the best place to sleep. It is deep in our culture.<br />A foreign is vulnerable in Albanian mentality and as such , it is honourable to take care for his wellbeing until he reaches home and be close to his own people.",Liljana Sufaj,2021-02-02T20:34:07Z,1
"The weather looks amazing like California this time of year.<br />Since the pandemic I don&#39;t go anywhere without my machete. The trails can sometimes get overgrown and need some trimming.<br />I suggest one of those backpack blade holster like the heroines from the movies. It&#39;s a cool look and no one will mess with you, ever.<br />In California we have mountain lions and bears, most have trackers on them, but still it&#39;s a habit to carry some sort of weapon when traveling alone in a wilderness.",Paulus Aurelius,2020-12-14T20:43:03Z,0

"I was in Albania earlier this year! I didn&#39;t have very long there, only 3 days, for which I was in Tirana, but I booked a trip going out into the &quot;caves and canyons&quot; of Albania, because it looked amazing. Then the tour company didn&#39;t show up... Honestly Albania for me was not the best country. I stayed in a hostel (called All Stars Tirane- avoid it) which was disgusting. Electrical sockets hanging off the wall, broken beds, more beds in the room than advertised online, and the kitchen that was supposedly available has the gas turned off and they wanted to charge €3 per use. There was someone in my room who was 46 and male, and asked me if I was still a virgin. I&#39;m 17. I shouldn&#39;t have stayed after 1 night, but whilst in the situation I somehow ignored all of the red flags.<br /><br />I want to go back to get a better image of the country, because it was beautiful in the city, and I want to see the mountains more. It makes me sad that some people give their country a bad reputation.",17andtravelling,2020-12-13T22:31:33Z,1

"Hi Eva that old lady who invited you to your house as a guest and fed you and treated you so kindly; the people like her are the jewels of humanity and make this world worthy of living! Similar story, my late mother used to tell me of her father. He didn’t use to eat his dinner 🍲 with other members of the family till late at night ,in the hope that if any passenger passed by the village, he’d eat with him. In old traditional Pashtun culture (in Khyber pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan) we used to take pride in serving our guests well. Unfortunately, capitalism has eroded the tradition a lil bit 😀, but still in many places people still follow it with zeal. So people, all around the world 🌎 despite following different cultures and faith, some good universal values bond them together which is very heartening to see...take care...",Abid Khan,2020-12-13T21:58:41Z,1

"Enver Hoxha wasn&#39;t so paranoid after all.  &quot;The Albanian Subversion (Albanian: Përmbysja e Shqipërisë) is one of the earliest and most notable failures of the Western covert paramilitary operations in the Eastern Bloc. The British SIS and the American CIA launched a joint subversive operation [in 1949], using as agents Albanian expatriates. Other anti-communist Albanians and many nationalists worked as agents for Yugoslav, Greek and Italian intelligence services, some supported by the UK and U.S. secret services. A Soviet mole, and, later, other spies tipped off the missions to Moscow, which in turn relayed the information to Albania. Consequently, many of the agents were caught, put on trial, and either shot or condemned to long prison terms at hard labor.&quot;  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Subversion"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_Subversion</a>",Yinzerburgh,2020-12-13T15:23:31Z,1

"@Dream TheDream89 you make some good points. No matter how experienced a person is, alot could go wrong, but she&#39;s definitely safe in Albania. I&#39;m going to guess that the villagers saw her alone and insisted she come inside, first because custom of hospitality and second, danger of wild animals and weather changes. Also, it will be the villages responsibility to rescue her .  They probably think she&#39;s nuts or lost.",t,2020-12-21T12:33:47Z,0
"It may be okay to do that in some rare occasions but it should by no means be encouraged. Instead extreme caution should be encouraged when doing things like that and for the most part to never hike alone and perhaps try to find and bring with you some self protection devices and a device for locating you. The world is not a playground and can be a very dangerous place. Its sad but true. Especially out in the wilderness. Hikers go missing all the time in such places, especially the ones who decided to hike alone and the ones that decided to hike through some dangerous area without doing prior research about it. All you have to do to understand this is take a look at what happened to Kris Kremers and Lisanne Froon. So horrific! Before going on such hikes please think about your loved ones and really consider your options for not doing it alone.",Dream TheDream89,2020-12-18T11:57:25Z,0
