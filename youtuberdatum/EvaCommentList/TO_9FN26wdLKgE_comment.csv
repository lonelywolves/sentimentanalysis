The reason why it&#39;s not that famous is not because it&#39;s 2nd tall by because it lies in gilgit baltistan region which is a disputed territory. In fact Karakoram mountains are extremely important to pakistan as they shield them from india. Due to Karakoram mountains indian military is at not 50km or 1 hr but 80km or 2hr away from Islamabad and rawalpindi. Getting kashmir will help pakistan move india from its doorstep to a safer location but with the largest army in the world with modern air force it doesn&#39;t seem so much can be done.,MAC,2020-07-28T01:28:17Z,0

"Oooh! That must be not too far from from the place I walked up to with a girlfriend. We put up a tent on the edge of the track where it overlooks a glacier. It only took a few hours to walk up from the Abotabad-Gilgit road. She was much quicker at walking. I wasn&#39;t very fit and she had to keep stopping to wait for me. She took a picture of me walking on the ice. It made these <i>really awesome</i> cracking noises that are hard to describe. I took a photo of her kind of writhing around on the ground covering her face, ... I like my girls insane and outdoors. That night we listened to the BBC World Service telling us the Berlin Wall was being ripped down. We were sort of half thinking of trying to get as far as the base camp, ... I can&#39;t remember why we didn&#39;t go on. Maybe we didn&#39;t have enough food, or maybe I ran out of cigarettes or something,... 😂♥️",Ian Alan Neil Grant,2020-07-08T15:30:53Z,0

You are a favourite amongs them and they will tell stories about the beautiful young women who came amongst them .

"Wow. I am inspired. Did you do any special prep during months leading up to this hike? I want to do it next summer when Covid will be behind us, hopefully. <br /><br />Being an average joe Texan, I am fat, a bit too round around the waistline. I can barely bicycle 10 miles, let alone walk. So how does an out of shape person prepare for a trip like this? How to build endurance, physical &amp; mental strength to accomplish this difficult feat. <br /><br />Any one wants to join me in this effort?",AAziz,2020-07-05T00:46:54Z,0

"Such another interesting video. Actually had never seen the Karakorum range, I had heard of K2.  I really love following your journey, the places you explore, and so interesting. It really makes me want to explore too. As a hiker who likes ultralight stuff, seeing those guys with plastic barrels strapped to their backs, makes them look like slaves, poor guys. I get they must be poor and desperate to sign up as &quot;sherpas.&quot; I don&#39;t know how I feel about all this, very mixed feelings. I get it helps them, they get a job, you see natural beauty. I think there should be more people carrying gear, not more than 40-50 lbs each, and they should be well compensated. That has to be painful carrying those things. Whats scary is that they are making bread with two hands, but I know people do this two hand thing in that part of the world, on hand for the bathroom, other to shake. How does anyone be clean? I guess a different level of clean, only hikers are ok with. So seeing you with that questionable bread. I ve seen you do lots of questionable stuff in doing what locals do, wondering if you get sick a lot doing what you do? You should have interviewed a K2 sherpa there, would have been cool. Guess filming not allowed there?",smileyhappyradio,2020-07-04T14:14:18Z,0

It is a country where people are friendly and they don&#39;t really bother you but makes you feel welcome.<br />interesting that Karachi was considered the “Paris of Asia” in the 1960s because I lived there from 1963 through 1966. I was an American 14-year-old upon arrival and got out of there just a year or so from high school graduation. These Pakistan videos continue to amaze me.  The people are amazing and yes, what incredible hospitality.  I’ll say it again that this is 180 degrees opposite of Pakistan that the media has painted the last 20 years.",Munam Haider,2020-07-03T12:08:04Z,245

"Very well done video with great clarity and color and sound too.  I like how you juxtapose the aerial shots with the mid range and closeups, nice editing too, and how you create such a nice story around a great adventure.  How much did it cost to go this way?  What elevations were you hiking in?  I&#39;m from low elevation Minnesota and only hiked to over 12,000 Ft or 3,600 meters two times, and to 11,000 once.  I had a very bad headache and had to hike back down, and even after an attempt to first acclimate at 7,300 for a week.  I&#39;m now 65 and wondering if people my age have done this trek.  I&#39;m thinking that with guides and all the food and cooking that it is very expensive to do this, right?  It&#39;s amazing that you are so young and speak their language (Urdu?) too.  Most of the time they hardly ever show much about the amazing porters carrying such loads.  I wonder what their ages are and how long they&#39;ve been doing this, and how much they are paid.  Is this better than hiking to base camp for Everest?  I&#39;m thinking Everest is so much more popular that it must not be as exciting with so many hiking at once there.  Did the porters carry your supplies too so all you had was a small day pack?  Did they provide the tents too?  I like the remoteness of your trip too!  Thanks for sharing your talent and sense of adventure!",mwj5368,2019-12-26T07:03:26Z,0
"I think yes, you need to hire the services of local tour guides. They will arrange tents and other stuff (your clothing, jackets of course are your responsibilty)<br />Everest trek is easy one. K2 basecampn trek is around 2 weeks back and forth. <br />Watch a family (w/ 11 and 13 years kids) from St Louis did this trek in 2019.<br />Search their videos &quot;where the jones&quot; on youtube",Tanvir Ahmad,2020-02-29T06:59:03Z,0

"Keeping in view the deep cooperation of Poland with Pakistan since 1950s, I thought its impossible that there is no exchange program of cities between the two. Its a good method to keep in check the unwanted people. Normally, Poland is working with PAF but it does not mean that it would not be totally disconnected from Army. The towns are Kharian in Pakistan exchanged with Chelmo (called Kulm in German) of Poland. Kulm is birthplace of Gen Guderian and its the only choice that fits.

Thanks for taking us there...<br />But such an important trip...I am kind of dissatisfied with length pf video ...infact it should had been three parts... two of them for trip till the actual base camp...and last one for adventurous trek...<br />Yaaa u wud had run short of words...but ur camera wrk would had done job...I feel batteries would not last for five days...is that...<br />Rugged terrain...glaciers ...rocky mountains... chiling winds ...artistic clouds..that keeps. A trekker going...the landscape seduces and one keeps asking for more...exploring the beauty of the nature..one is never satisfied with Art of creator...you need more and more untill you push yourself to an extreme ..but at the end which is never there...u hv to give up....and return...<br />Nice to see your vlog...<br />See a movie on K2 I think...it vertical limits or hanging cliffs...is it on k2...I donot remember ..watch it...viewers will definitely love THAT...,idrees shah,2019-08-27T10:49:23Z,0

"Yeah the Balti porters sure do work hard.  Many a climbing expedition has recorded in published books how difficult they are to deal with, how if you give them extra equipment like proper footwear they sell it and then go barefoot, and Eva pretends she is the first person to ever trek to K2, even making &quot;fresh Roti&#39; sound like the world&#39;s delicacy when it tastes like unleavened, bland flatbread, which is exactly what it is.  <br /><br />And no doubt, all those Balti porters must be very &quot;titillated&quot; that a Western-Educated, Western Liberated, Western-Freedomed young and attractive woman joined them ALONE for dinner, when there own single or married women are not even allowed out of the house without permission, never mind to join a group of men for dinner, be they Western, Muslim, or Pakistani.",AboveItAll,2021-01-20T01:12:38Z,0
