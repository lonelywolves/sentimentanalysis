"The good news is that you very likely won&#39;t get coronavirus... the bad news, depending on how you look at it, is that you may be stranded there for years or even forever depending on how badly the world falls apart due to this. After watching numerous other YouTubers I am a fan of either get stranded in foreign countries or abandon vehicles, motor homes, or their personal possessions to take sudden flights home, I saw your video and it takes the cake, as they say. Stranded on a remote island off the coast of Yemen, one of the most improvised countries in the world... wow. By the way, we are &quot;stranded&quot; inside our home in California and you can watch my videos to see not only updates about our own situation, but also my rants about the coronavirus situation both here and around the world.",adriennefloreen,2020-04-02T19:27:29Z,0
