"First time hearing that we (Muslims) eat with our right hand because it’s clean, rather that’s what Allah commanded us. There is reasons too it but not to say the left is dirty, etc. you’ll have to do more research on it but when learning about Islam, you can’t all that which the people do because sometimes they make mistakes or are ignorant on something and don’t represent the religion.<br /><br />Just thought I’d mention that as I continue the video. <br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQXOx9ECi5E&amp;t=4m15s"">4:15</a><br /><br />Ok just finished, I think I’ll be a good Muslim in an environment like this where I am simple, not materialistic and I’m surrounded by nature to reflect and constantly remember my lord",Jamilah Obaiyah,2021-03-19T10:14:46Z,0

anyone wondering why that city was deserted. the city is  located on a road coming from algeria. paralel to that road there is another road coming from morocco. the last 20 years morocco boosted his economy and his exports of food and materials and foreign investestors started moving to morocco. the Mauritanian realized that buying from morocco is cheaper and easier and higher quality. now that road is abandoned and the city died.<br />last month algeria sent some mercenaries to cut that road and stop the flow of traffic on that road (portion of the road about 15 km is demilliterized by the UN and it&#39;s a no man&#39;s land) because its killing algeria&#39;s economy. but the moroccan millitary reacted and freed that road.,rajawi99,2021-02-20T06:58:43Z,0

"Mike Hunt<br />PARTICLE PHYSICS IN HOLY QUR&#39;AN <br /><br />The word &quot; ذرة &quot; used in this verse <br />means itom. Smaller than itom indicate that there are particles smaller than itom. Itom contains   electron and proton and.These particles are smaller than itom. <br /><br />و قال الذين كفروا لاتأتينا الساعة ، قل بلى وربى لتاتينكم علم الغيب لا يعزب عنه مثقال ذرة في السموات ولا في الأرض و لا اصغر من ذلك ولا أكبر إلا في كتب مبين  o<br />                                         ( سبأ : ٣)<br />Those who disbelieve say: The Hour will never come unto us. Say: Nay,  by my Lord, but it is coming unto you surely. (He is) the knower of the Unseen. Not an itom&#39;s weight, or less than that or greater, escapeth Him in the heavens or in the earth, but it is in a clear Record&quot;.<br />                         (Qur&#39;an.Saba:3)<br /><br />Modern science knew this fact in 20th century. Who can say 1450 years ago that there are particles smaller than itom? <br />Only Almighty Allah Who created these particles.<br />Higs Boson particle is also created by Allah. It is not God.<br /><br />If yon see meaning of ذرة in Arabic dictionary you will come to know that this word means itom. It is written in all English-Arabic dictionaries.<br />You don&#39;t know Arabic. Learn and study more. It is in your interest <br />to believe in Almighty Allah and worship Him only and believe that prophet Muhammad is His last and final messenger.<br /><br />We believe in Jesus( pbuh) that he is prophet of Allah not God. Jesus never claimed the dignity. He was a Muslim and preached Islam as every prophet did from Adam to Prophet Mohammad(pbuh). <br /><br />Mohammad( pbuh) very clearly told his followers that he is a man like others but Allah choosed him and made him His last and final messenger.<br /><br />Muslims do not worship Mohammad<br />but they worship Almighty Allah as prophet Mohammad ( pbuh) taught them. Jesus like Mohammad taught his followers to worship Allah only. <br />The word father means the Lord. In Arabic He is called as رب( Lord)not God. <br />Hope it is very clear now for every followers of prophet Jesus(pbuh)<br /> <br />If we Muslims do not believe in Jesus as a prophet we are not Muslis and not acceptable to Almighty Allah.<br />If a follower of JESUS wants to go in Paradise after death they should revert to Islam earliest possible and work as prophet Mohammad taught <br />otherwise they may not enter into Paradise.<br />Almighty Allah bless all of us<br /><br /><br />DR.MOHAMMAD LAEEQUE NADVI <br />Ph.D. (Arabic Lit.)

"@vishal vivek this is the last time I&#39;m commenting on this thread. People have a choice. Those Bedouins have a choice to live a nomadic lifestyle. Whatever people&#39;s choice to live their lives is never a justification to kill and slaughter an animal. If you won&#39;t harm a dog or cat, why would you harm a goat, or pig or chicken or cow? Animals are like humans. They just want to live a happy life. EMPATHY.     Good luck to you. I&#39;m done commenting on this thread.",Jobert Menguito,2020-12-09T11:16:16Z,0

"@Nadine Ahmed We all know that your ancestors are nomads who had never had a permanent land. We all know that they are originated from the Arabian Peninsula and roamed around the Sahara which streches from the Red Sea in Sudan until the coasts of Mauritania. All the people who live within The Sahara are sahraouis (desert dwellers), not only you. <br />On the other hand, my people, the Amazigh, are the indigenous inhabitants to the whole territory. We named places and villages in Berber that you, the invaders, can’t even recognize their meanings such as Tifariti and Imlili. <br />Ok, dream on about that referundum because we won’t allow a bunch of terrorists backed by Algeria to rule us. You might as well establish your republic in the Eastern Sahara. It’s a Sahara too, aren’t you Sahraoui LOL",Sneak Peek,2020-12-21T23:33:41Z,0

Something that has been on my bucket list for awhile now has been to stay a place that is 300 miles from the closest McDonald&#39;s. It looks like you may have done that several times already. I love your videos. It is always interesting to see different cultures. 😃,Mark Whittum,2020-12-05T12:45:07Z,2

Your videos always make me smile. Thank you. I think travelers play a big part in world society by showing and learning customs and creating friendships that withstand The occasional government and corporation desires to Paint broad strokes with false narratives. Plus I like seeing places I haven’t been and you choose not just unique but also  war torn countries where you shun politics and embrace the local people.,our world,2020-12-05T12:29:05Z,1
