"We all know AlQaeda and Taliban and ISIS are a creation of USA. The weapons are supplied by the devious USA to destabilize Islamic countries. The real terrorists are the USA pretending to help but behind the scene they fund the terrorists! This documentary is false!<br /><br />USA have the most advanced military and UAV Drones and highly trained special forces that can take control of Afghanistan in 1 day if they wanted to. But if there is peace in Afghanistan then USA have to go home.<br /><br />The reason USA wants to stay in Afghanistan is control of the region, keep eyes on neighboring countries like China, Iran, Russia and Pakistan. <br /><br />USA will never leave Afghanistan, they will keep funding terrorists and  killing more Afghans!",Mystic Traveler,2021-04-27T17:41:49Z,0

Iran has everything Afghanistan has and way way more + security, modernity, ancient sites and natural ones. Which by the way are far more hospitable to tourists. Wanna risk your life?

"There is a mistake in the video, Taliban is not classified as a terrorist organization by the US, the UN or even the Afghan government. They have official diplomatic offices in some countries like Qatar, and they have good relations with Russia, China, Iran, and other countries. Actually, in 2010, the United Nations requested all countries to remove Taliban leaders from terrorism watch lists! They are a former government and nowadays there are peace negotiations between them in one side, and the US, the NATO, and the Afghan government in the other side. The US never negotiate with terrorist organizations.",MA MA,2021-04-18T03:12:40Z,0

without a kahlifa muslims r left in the same scenario as the thefts from caravans owned by the quresh lead by our prophet muhammed pbuh. islam is comprehensive. likewise so is sharia. theres always a time to decide for sure in case u take it back. i was dead set on being against suicide surat an nisa ayat 29 being my dalil to support my hak. and it is if with a khalifa and a ummah cose lets face it there is no ummah without a khalifa. im just saying dont be palestinian plz plz plz dont be palestinian or iranian. set urself free. fear allah. only hasbi allah,ricky james,2021-04-17T02:33:04Z,0

I haven&#39;t seen any of your videos in Hungary and was wondering if you have any plans to travel there this year.  I really have a wanderlust myself, but usually just travel within the US.

The mean reason is that, in Bameyan 95% are Hazara ethnic, due to our president prejudice against Hazara peoples he wants Bameyan should not has improvement and he changed the head of governors to other ethnic not from Hazara peoples in 2020 then explosion happens to show for tourists that this city is not safe but still it&#39;s safe rather then other city.<br />In feature Hazara people trying to have thier own local governors to make safest  city.<br />In Bameyan their is not kidnapping history if tourist comes throught Air in Bameyan.<br />Good luck for tourists.",afzali af,2021-04-07T05:51:58Z,0

I hope that they can find peace and safety so others can experience the hospitality and warmth of the Afghan culture.

"Prior to watching this video part of me has wanted to visit Afghanistan, but for obvious reasons because the country has been a war zone for the past 19 years I’d have to be crazy to travel there.<br />The main motivation for wanting me to visit I want to see the parts of Afghanistan that are not covered by the media. I want to break the preconception that Afghanistan is a horrible place because of war. I want to see the beauty that the people of Afghanistan see in their country to change how I view the country. This is why I maybe want to visit Afghanistan someday!!!",RIOV26,2021-04-01T23:34:23Z,0

I thought Afghanistan was a desert country that was always warm, so I was surprised by all of the coats, snow, and ice. <br /><br />I am curious, though.

"Maybe you are a little spoiled? The people in Afghanistan are not as rich or open minded, as western nations. As a tourist you have to accept this when you consider traveling there. Tourism can be more than laying on the beach or joining a sightseeing tour. They have an other culture and it will change slowly, but steady, like all cultures did in the past. Stay in your cocoon, if you prefer. Nobody will judge you for that, but you might miss some interesting perspectives in live if you never leave the comfort zone. Wearing a coat when its cold is partially actually a step forward to heating the room and producing co2 😏...",mil ky way ling,2021-03-31T17:22:15Z,1

If you know how to travel, travel in groups, and have honest intentions and do it the right way, I find truly very hard to believe that one will be attacked and kidnapped for that reason. The only thing keeping me away from going there is the big bucks. I have two dogs and I never travel without them, so things are more expensive.

"Afghanistan has so much to offer. It&#39;s known for its hospitality, a documentary I watched along time ago said if you go to an Afghan family and say can I stay in your house for 1 day, they will tell you this is your house, you can stay for as long as you want. Its the home of the worlds first monastic religion, the home of the worlds first oil paintings, cities like Herat in the west were known for their architecture, poetry, music. In its more recent history when Jews were being prosecuted in Iran and Central Asia around 80 years ago, Afghanistan was the only country that offered them a place free of discrimination and prosecution. In many countries they were segregated, in Afghanistan they lived like any other Afghan. There is a video on YouTube where Afghan Jews not the ones who moved from Central Asia but the ones that were already in Afghanistan but now live in Israel talk about their love of Afghanistan. When they are asked where they are from? They say Afghanistan and we were not forced out but we left because of the war.",streamx2,2021-03-30T17:53:54Z,0

"Very Brave girl, the country is undoubtedly unique in every way and afghans are the most welcoming people on planet earth and that is an undeniable fact. Unfortunately the country has seen nothing but wars after wars over the decades inflicted upon them by dirty foreign interferences. Afghans never heard nor knew what Taliban means let alone to have or share their primitive ideologies. Anyways may the Almighty bring peace and prosperity upon them and hopefully the global family can go and visit. 🤞🙌",Jay Noorzad,2021-03-29T21:41:10Z,0

UK Counter Terrorism Policing has information and advice on staying safe abroad and what to do in the event of a terrorist attack. Find out more about the global threat from terrorism. Multiple threats are issued daily. Terrorists and insurgents conduct frequent and widespread lethal attacks against Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF), domestic and international political and civilian targets including within the city gates, and those working in the security, humanitarian and reconstruction fields.

"Hi! What a beautiful video. I really appreciate your passion for showcasing less explored spaces in such a genuine way. I do have to say though, if you want to emphasise the beauty of countries like Afghanistan... please do not open each video with violent messages from the media! If that is an image you want to counter, do address it of course, but let it not be the start of the story each time... It is just so sensationalist, plus I don&#39;t think it helps your message. Do not allow YouTube or the internet and the number of viewers and likes force you to decide to script things this way... With that said, I think your videos otherwise include a lot of valuable content about these places. I look forward to seeing more.",Zententia,2021-03-29T16:23:32Z,0

"@sv USA is the founder of terrorism not Pakistan. Secondly, who is behind golden temple massacre? What about Gujrat killings? And Delhi Riots recently? This is worse than terrorism. India has been taken over by Hindutva driven Nazi akin racially supremacist regime which is not only shattering the very fabric of Indian secular society as has been recorded by USA Freedom House report but for the region as a whole. And it is New Delhi who is playing a spoiler role in Afghan peace process as has been said by ex US president Trump. In short, the worst or grave danger to the whole South Asia is India alone. It has border issues with almost every country.

Amazing! You could go inside the old monastery. Before the Buddha‘s destruction one was not allowed even to go close.

"You should go to Balkh Province, Mazar -e Sharif.  I don’t know if you’re into poetry that is the birth place of Persian/Tajik poet Rumi. The city is relatively more peaceful than the rest of the country probably as peaceful as Bamiyan. They just celebrated New Year’s in there, they call it Nowruz. It is celebrated in there in the most grandeur and magnificent way, more like Christmas and new year combined. New Year starts on March 21st and the celebration is only one day in places like Kabul, but in Mazar it goes on for 40 days. So do not miss it while you r in there.

"First of all huge kudos to you for being adventurous, curious and brave. Both Afghanistan and Socotra have been on the top of my travel list for a while. I also appreciate your perspective as a female traveler, including shopping, dressing up in local clothes and the photoshoot ;). I have noticed that many vloggers have been going to Afghanistan recently, particularly during Covid. And every single one of them has been to Bamyan and yet they fail to mentioned the Hazara people who live there and have been discriminated against for decades. The destruction of the Buddha in Bamyan was also an act of hostility against the Hazaras who look different (they have Turkic-Mongoloid features) and are also shiites. Your guide Gull is apparently a Hazara, he can tell you more and perhaps you could be able to share their story with the world. Keep up the adventurous travel, I hope you make it to Herat and stay safe.",Daloula,2021-03-28T01:11:21Z,0

"@Susan Habib - I have no hatred towards Afghanistan and the people.  I wish them well and hope things change for the better. But what I said about the history is true. Peace is a relative term in Afghanistan and when compared to the devastating times it went after 1978, one may feel 1960s are better. But that is short lived. The country was still under monarchy. There were constant border issues with pakistan on pasthun provinces.  There are pockets of modernisation in capital Kabul but large population of the country still live far away from that. So a decade or two in a history of thousands of years is insignificant and not enough to claim it was progressive.",sv,2021-04-03T04:41:28Z,0

"&quot;the kite runner&quot; was an anti-pashtun propaganda book written by the Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini, who is a close friend of war hawk president George W Bush. the aim of the fictional book was it to demonize and degrade the Pashtun people of Afghanistan (majority and rulers of the country in that time) to the point where a long and bloody war against them would be justified. the book was published in 2003 where the USA needed popular support from the public for their new decision to occupy Afghanistan permanently. the author Khaled Hosseini is talented with an immense writing and story telling style which is nice for the reader. but the content of his books should not be taken serious. in Afghanistan, he&#39;s widely despised, especially by the Pashtun people, for his pro war and anti pashtun propaganda. his books specifically aims the typical western stereotypes of Islamophobes against Muslims and suports and highlights them.",toki hiko,2021-04-25T22:48:21Z,0

I think you are extremely brave and have really shown how unique and lovely and kind the people are....something travelers see always and those who are not fortunate to travel, miss out on and develop ideas not based in what is very true....people are people the world over are innately good inside.

"@Marilyn Stahl Hi Marilyn, I am an Aussie who was heading in the opposite direction the same year. Enjoying revisiting Afghanistan through Eva. I can&#39;t believe how prosperous it now appears compared to back then. Bamian was just a collection of small dwellings perhaps 20/30 (hard to remember) and we stayed in a big room in an eating place. No tables or chairs and we just slept on the floor but being able to wander around the Buddhas at night was something I never forget. Tried to make it to Bandi Amir twice but the snow was too heavy and so so cold I had no clothes left in my bag even wearing all my underwear !!",Christopher Oliver,2021-03-29T12:09:09Z,6
"@Overseas I am so sad that you had to leave your native country.  Afghanistan is a spectacularly unique and unforgettable  place but what occurred was so unfortunate right after I traveled through.  When I was there women were well educated, or could be, and were not covered from head to toe in the &quot;chadris&quot; which is what I was told they were called. The place was thriving and so many people travelled through it from the West to the East and from Australia and New Zealand to the UK.  I am glad you are safe in England and hope that you are able to one day see your home country again receiving visitors in a safe way.",Marilyn Stahl,2021-03-28T21:02:17Z,2

"When I went to Afghanistan in 2008, I traveled throughout and had the most life-changing, revealing, eye opening, dangerous, safest trip of my life. I was never more honored by Desitny, than when I was meant to go to Afghanistan. Bamiyan frozen is something i will have to return to try, but BAMIYAN... SO GORGEOUS. Herat in general is very beautiful. The salang pass, which she avoided by flying, is BREATH TAKING. Mountains in purple, red, green, blue, yellow. Entire mountains of turquoise. Huge desert tornadoes that just spring up and dance around each other. Camels. Kochi tribes. Ghazni, Balkh, and Mazar are also just eye watering beautiful. Rabia Balkhi&#39;s tomb. I saw it all, shared it with all my friends, and now there&#39;s foreigners who can do it to. It makes me happy. My dream is that everybody sees how gorgeous Afghanistan always has been. They think their countries bombed some hellish no man&#39;s land. They bombed Paradise, and portrayed it as the inferno. Thank you for the videos, and Allah keep you all safe happy and healthy.",SoVerySasa,2021-03-27T15:00:31Z,113

"i said that to myself (I am Afghan), she is lucky she will somewhat blend in with her looks. they will be able to tell simply by your mannerisms, the way you walk, your volume, your eye contact, but she does indeed look like she could be Afghan. A lot of people can blend in, Afghans have the most diverse looks I have ever seen. Like the Sami people of northern europe, they look like some of us too. But we also have blondes, gingers... with black, brown, green and blue eyes, asiatic, dark and light skin, truly one of the most diverse &#39;ethnic&#39; maps in one nation. Meeting a member of Hazara tribe, with green eyes and red hair, is such a wondrous delight when you&#39;ve only seen and assumed we all look the same; we should love one another whether dark or light, one ethnic look or the other, God makes such gorgeous decisions.",SoVerySasa,2021-03-27T14:47:37Z,8

Afghans have  suffered a lot and now its high time for the world to restore peace and prosperity to this war torn country. My message to Afghans is very simple; whether you are Pashtuns or non pashtuns, you have the right to be proud of your heritage, history, language and ethnicity. But DO NOT BE BIGOTS!!! BIGOTRY is BAD!!! Live like a bouquet of different flowers and you will look more beautiful :) DIVERSITY is BEAUTIFUL :) Shun bigotry and live peacefully and the rest of the world must also put in their sincere efforts to restore peace and prosperity to this beautiful land with very beautiful people. take care...ALLAH hafiz.",Abid Khan,2021-03-27T11:42:04Z,1

"Walking and dancing on a frozen lake deep in the mountains of Afghanistan is simply incredible and I would go back in a heartbeat if I could as I’ve only been to the border region coming in through the Kyber Pass.<br />However with travelling overseas banned at the moment not going to happen for a while as for the danger not really worried about that because when I was on the Pakistan side of the border in the Kyber Pass we got caught up in the middle of a firefight between two warring parties fighting it out as they normally did back then , as long we stayed under cover it was fine until one side started throwing a few mortar rounds .<br />Then as we were driving back into Peshawar we witnessed a car bomb go off killing a number of people fortunately for us we weren’t near the blast area but saw and heard the explosion.<br />This was back in 1990 when there was a war still going on in Afghanistan which also had affected Pakistan and yes one must bear in mind the dangers of travelling to Afghanistan but if you dress as the locals do which we did and take precautions both countries are amazing places to visit.<br />One thing for sure is that I want to go into the mountains again as they make me feel so alive for me the mountains of Pakistan and Afghanistan are my siren song I can hear them calling deep in my soul it’s seeing the mountains in your videos the make long to be there and I’m so glad that you have heard their song and showing the world the real beauty of bot Afghanistan and Pakistan.",Mick Angelhere's World,2021-03-27T10:18:00Z,2

"I was so lucky. I travelled through Afghanistan 3 times at the end of the 1970s. Obviously after the Russians invaded this wasn&#39;t possible any more. My memory is mostly the people. Afghans that I met were proud, handsome and honest people. Unlike most of Asia a price was a price, there was little bartering. The scenery was unbelievably beautiful. And at the end of a long road trip there was always Afghan green tea and bread, often for free as a welcome. In those days Afghan hash was everywhere, in fact when I entered the country from Iran the border guard gave me a large lump &quot;welcome to Afghanistan, sir&quot;.

The People and Cultures are Beautiful. As an American, we have Beautiful people and Cultures as well.  Please  follow Kate and Nate, who traveled America in their Van. They will show you the true people and Culture of America. We, as Americans, have been Lied to, by our Government, about other Countries and their Governments. Their governments have Lied to their people too.<br />It&#39;s the Evil doers in this world that do this. I Respect All Cultures and Religions except One and that is the Religion Called, &quot; EVIL &quot;. My Religion teaches me that We wrestle not agains Flesh and Blood.

"@byron 2456 You need to ask why successive Afghan governments were doing the dirty work of India to attack Pakistan using Afghanistan as a base. The Afghan governments spent so much time and energy trying to destabilize Pakistan to please India, they neglected their own country. Pakistanis remember that the first Pakistani PM was assassinated by an Afghan agent or the cross border intrusion of Indian and Afghan agents trying to cause trouble o border areas. That&#39;s why we are pushing for early completion of the border fence to stop intrusion and movement across the country. We want peace between Afghanistan and Pakistan but the one sided blame game ignores the decades of Indian and Afghan terrorism in Pakistan which has backfired on Afghanistan.",H Tastemaster,2021-04-22T01:36:12Z,0
"@H Tastemaster You call it border we call it line and will never ever accept it as Pakistan&#39;s land.<br />It is the land of Afghanistan stolen by UK and given to British India for 100 years, If Afghanistan is stable and powerful then we&#39;ll fight to get our lands back as Azerbaijan got from Armenia.",The Passenger,2021-04-20T19:27:30Z,0
"@Haris I think only Pakistani people are to blame since we allow Indian inspired propaganda to permeate them and allow them into the country. Think about Iran which kept Afghan refigees in camps. We should be respectful of our neighbors but if someone is in your home and disrespecting you as a namak haram, they need to be shown the door. So Pakistanis should not hire and encourage the exit of those refugees who are against the state or at least help them smuggle themselves to Europe to live as refugees in Germany or Sweden so at least they won&#39;t be in Pakistan. So yes some people might say, if you find a refugee being thankless, you should fire them from your company or not give them business. I stopped going to a store in Peshawar when I overheard a negative comment about Pakistan but a refugee who was saying bad things about Pakistan. I made sure he knew why I would never come again and why I would also tell others not to go there. On the other hand I have seen generally good and decent Afghans working in Pakistan and I am happy to deal with them. We are all human beings after all - there is good and bad everywhere.",H Tastemaster,2021-04-19T19:11:30Z,0
@The Passenger Whether we want it or not it will be a reality for people on both sides of the border. It will work to both countries advantage. There will be no people coming in from Afghanistan unless through border checks with Afghan and Pakistan government approval - so this non nonsensical blame game can finally stop. I just hope the Pakistani military can finsih the border fencing before the exit of US forces from the region.,H Tastemaster,2021-04-19T19:05:42Z,0
