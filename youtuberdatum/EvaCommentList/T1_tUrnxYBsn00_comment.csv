"Sister, you know exactly my thoughts. In another video I thought, &quot;OMG, what if there are snakes?&quot; and you almost instantly mentioned that.  This time I thought &quot;My sister is travelling with a lot of men, how is she coping with the toilet?&quot;, and you replied too. I had one last random thought &quot;Where do you wash yourself?&quot;. I would bathe in that fantastic sea. You don&#39;t really need any soap, not only because it would pollute that gorgeous sea but because sea salt is a natural disinfectant and a powerful remedy against inflammation in the body (e. g. rheumatism, arthritis, etc.). Just remember to stay hydrated. Where do you get your drinking water from? Are there any wellspring? A big hug and thank you for inspiring me! 🤗😊💖",Miracles Happen,2020-06-21T01:16:45Z,0
