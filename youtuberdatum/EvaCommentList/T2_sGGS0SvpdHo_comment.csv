I&#39;m a native and I volunteer in preserving the treks user friendly, so I may know what I&#39;m talking about.

Therefore I can say that Romania is very beautiful and special country with some of the best people in the world.

"But there si also no need to show it, because every country looks the same. It has it&#39;s beauties and uglyness. The one thing I got bored after 16 years of hiking, touring with bike, traveling with public transportation and so on... is, that if I compare countries by nature, I can&#39;t do that, because they all look the same. And must say that most interesting places are one people built. Nature is amazing, but it is like looking at the same picture style of only one artist. People bring a little bit of chaos with their own construction, and while human construction will not bring peace or clarity, it is more versatile then nature itself.",željko šimić,2021-03-22T12:43:30Z,0

"Very large areas of the Romanian forest are fast being destroyed by illegal and destructive extraction of timber (i.e. trees) by profiteers, aided and abetted by corrupt politicians taking a cut or turning a blind eye. Same thing is happening in the eastern Polish forest (fortunately better protected (for the time being) on the Belarus side of the border). EU, CoE and other bodies must act decisively soon if the world isn&#39;t to lose these large remaining tracts of ancient wood, which belong to all of us as our commonwealth and to future generations.",B Ruphe,2020-10-06T13:48:00Z,0

"Mountains really do change you. I went to a trip to a mountain in my country North Macedonia, called Kozuf. I cannot explain the feeling but they are the most refreshing things ever. My mind cleared up, I felt like a better person, I felt amazing. The air is clean,  away from civilization, but when I see some fellow people there I feel happier than seeing a person in the streets. Beautiful nature, delicious berries, green everywhere, rivers everywhere, you feel irrelevent but in a good way. <br /><br />Your videos are incredible. I&#39;m a big fan of you. I watch your videos when feeling down because they remind me that the world is beautiful and that to me matters more than my dumb thoughts that bring me down.

Romania has been on my list for a while now. Cause it feels like old europe with its castles and villages like going back in time<br /><br />Probably not a great thing for the locals but good for amazing memories for tourists.,Thomas Elzinga,2020-09-25T12:48:29Z,6
"i`m a local i live in a moutain village in Transylvania, It`s good for us to....my house on the outside looks like it`s from the 1800`s but i manage and so are the rest of my neighbours....i mean i have 600mb down and 450mb up internet at 1350m altitude, i drive a 2004 bmw x5, have an iphone 6s, 2 laptops a ps3, yeah we are poorer than west EU or the anglosphere(usa, canda etc) but we manage, i`m happy with all that i have bro.

"!!! Note from a native Romanian: <br /><br />While I do appreciate you showcasing the beauty of our country and it&#39;s wild areas, please keep in mind that this country is NOT perfect or as picturesque as you present it here. <br /><br />The main problem with Romania is its people. The majority of the population is wildly uneducated and close-minded. Mainly due to a lack of access to free education and due to the indoctrination of the people by the church. <br /><br />Our political system is very corrupt, and even though the general population is not happy with it, they more often than not choose the same people to lead them because of their lack of political education. It&#39;s a country full of racists, sexists, homophobes, transphobes, xenophobes, and whatnot. Even people with higher education can turn out to be very close-minded. <br /><br />It&#39;s easy to present this country as being welcoming and beautiful from the perspective of a white cis-gendered person. But it&#39;s a completely different story for any other kind of person that visits or lives here. <br /><br />The natives will try to make a good first impression with tourists at first, but don&#39;t be fooled by that. That warmth ends the second that you don&#39;t adhere to their traditional norms. <br /><br /><br />While I&#39;m NOT saying that you shouldn&#39;t visit Romania, just be wary of its people. They can be deceiving. <br /><br />Sincerely, <br />A Romanian who has lost faith in his country.<br /><br />P.S. I will not respond to any natives that will try to mindlessly ignore these aspects. This is an honest view of this country.",Catalin Dimitrescu,2020-09-25T12:31:56Z,1

"Hi Eva, I am a big fan of your work thanks for sharing your adventures with us. I was hoping or rather requesting can you do a video on city of Karbala (Iraq) for the annual eve of Arbaeen where over 20 million Muslim people gather in a tiny city to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Hussain a.s, it will really be an eye opener for your self and for the viewers to really see what Islam is all about which the mainstream media never show, I hope this message reaches to you Eva and you get the honour and blessing of visiting Karbala",Najib Ali,2020-09-25T11:39:16Z,0

Do you mean that you are in the Carpathian mountains? Would be very interesting to know just where you visited. I highly recommend visiting the mystical Bucegi Plateau if you get the chance. Hiking and mysterious structures are so mind-blowing in that part of Romania. <br />I know this side of Romania ;) It&#39;s incredible that not many tourists know about it at all. Still one of my favourite countries.<br />Good video Eva,LIONS DETOUR,2020-09-25T11:11:01Z,0

"I love your content but this one hit hard because I had plans to travel to Romania two times. The first was for a conference, but it fell through as a result of an airline mix up. The second was supposed to be this summer and well I think we all know how that got cancelled. My colleauges there have not given up on me and are continually telling me that I have to make there as soon as COVID restrictions lift. Your vlog has shown me what I am missing. I have to make it happen.",Ali Abdullah,2020-09-24T16:41:01Z,2

"Love, love, love this!!! So wonderfully done. I love the cinematography. I love that you just let the nature, the wide open spaces, the silence speak for themselves. Not a whole lot of selfie talk while treking or doing stuff but letting your voice over do its job of storytelling. Its like a mini short film at the Sundance awards or something. I forgot this was Youtube. Plus, you and Mike look cute together. 😊",Belle,2020-09-24T16:30:37Z,2

It always rather annoys me that when people talk about other countries they speak about those countries as a political entity instead of the flora and fauna and ofcourse the people. I even notice that at my education which is all about travel. Today they looked at me with big eyes when I said I sleep in a hammock in the woods behind my home whenever I can. To my surprise there’s a lot of down to earth people there for a travel education.

It&#39;s awful funny that you bring up media all the time here in the United States they don&#39;t say absolutely anything about Romania and nothing negative about the country the only to see it on our news RTV here and much less nothing negative about the country I hate people that try to make westerners in other countries look bad and then try to because they show negative stuff when nothing&#39;s even being shown here in the states it&#39;s wrong of you to be doing that,OUTDOORLIFE KEITH,2020-09-24T13:15:05Z,1

I wish it would be so. Lost my dad 10 years ago. My my mom just left this world completely unexpectedly and before her time. I have no close family left and barely cope with her loss...
