"Hey Eva,  just read your note in video description, are you saying that you prefer not to possibly infect yourself at the risk of infecting an entire vulnerable island that has no proper health infrastructure. Isn&#39;t that selfish? Also, didn&#39;t you travel through multiple airports, including Egypt which has Coronavirus cases, before arriving in Socotra? Also, do you know that many young people can have Coronavirus but just show no symptoms? Your actions are unethical. Our government placed anti-Coronavirus measures.

"it causes massive floods because sand takes long time to absorb the water , so some rain is good but not a lot ,  also some parts of middle east you get also snow more regularly  Northern Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan  etc (mostly every couple of years while high altitudes is another story they get random snow sometimes like Uae last   year ) basically i think you are kinda ignorant who thinks that rain is ultra rare in middle east so every parts of rain is blessing<br />Lebanon doesnt even have desert",J D,2020-04-07T20:24:46Z,2
