Wonder if one of those wine places has its roots from Noah from the Bible as one of the first things he did was the winery that led to the curse of Ham. Beautiful place,Bumegz120843 MM,2021-04-25T03:17:51Z,0

"At About Things we have recently done a podcast on Nagorno-Karabakh and the future of this region with a renowned expert on post-Soviet space Thomas De Waal. The episode includes topics such as myth-making and dehumanisation in Armenian and Azerbaijani societies, as well as whether these two nations can ever learn to live together again. You might find our conversation quite interesting and we would love to hear you feedback:)",About Things Podcast,2021-04-07T00:29:54Z,1

"18 We preach the old Gospel, we are the old Church and we are on God&#39;s earth. This earth is God&#39;s earth before being in your hands. It is God who created it and I am his prophet. I, Kacou Philippe, slave of Jesus Christ, I have no portion with Caesar and we have no portion with Caesar. Like Israel, the true Church has always taken a position opposed to any pagan power. &quot;To Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s&quot;. It is a commandment and a divine decree and I pronounce It in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the virtue of the mission that I received on April 24, 1993. Transgressing that is a sin.<br /><a href=""http://www.philippekacou.org/"">www.Philippekacou.org</a>",Nahoua Camara,2021-02-06T23:21:45Z,0
"<a href=""http://www.philippekacou.org/"">Www.philippekacou.org</a>  <br />17 And you, federations of churches, you, brotherhoods of sorcerers in sheep clothing, Jesus Christ has defeated you! You want to eat at the table of God and at the table of Caesar? The sword will pursue you in broad daylight and hell will receive you. You hate me, and yet if I die, God will send another Kacou Philippe. Israel sawed Isaiah in pieces but another Isaiah came in the person of Jeremiah. If I die, you will not finish rejoicing that God will send another prophet because of his children on the earth. The enemy of the earth, it is you! Because you are seeking to build financial empires, therefore you caress sin? Know that God will destroy you and hell will receive you! ... You, Goliath with feet of clay, this Message will hit you. It&#39;s your torment that has begun. You! Magicians! Fleshy and plump wolves! Tamed snakes! Dwelling places of Satan, you are drunk with the blood of innocent people in search of Salvation, how long will you live again on earth? And hell and the lake of fire and the dwelling place of the dead continually cry out against you: &quot;condemnation! condemnation! condemnation!&quot;. Why? Because you have hell for nationality.

"28 But as long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. And this light will reach every nation of the earth, including Russia and China which will become great Christian nations according to Matthew 24:27 after Africa. We now have Brothers and Sisters in all the countries of Latin America. And Apostle André Lima of Brazil travels to these countries for baptisms and consecrations for me. Several apostles like Bernard Chigova, Fortuné Sita, John Kalosi, Patson Sibanda and Domingo did not prevail. Domingo asked me for forgiveness for his contempt for my black skin, but Apostle André Lima has showed himself as the model of apostle. Apostle André Lima is the greatest apostle that the Almighty God has given me in this ministry. For me, he has traveled across Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Colombia, Costa Rica, Salvador, Honduras and soon Mexico, Chile and Bolivia. He is often very sick but he does not back down. Only God will reward him, him and all those who act like him.<br /><br />29 Thus, some countries of Latin America are waiting for the baptism. Blacks are numerous in Latin America but whites will be the first because America is a nation of whites and the Message of William Branham had mostly been in North America. In less than three years, there will be assemblies in every nation of America. It will be thus because it was prophesied by Prophet Branham that Africa would send missionaries to America with the Message of an African. If God sends a prophet to the earth, the elect will come to him from all the languages and all the nations of the earth. No language or nation will be forgotten. Whites, blacks, Africans, etc. When Elijah and Moses come to Israel, men from every tribe of Israel will be saved. No tribe will be forgotten. Revelation 7 says, tribe of Levi, 12000. Tribe of Asher, 12000. Tribe of Gad, 12000. Tribe of Zebulun, 12000 ... You see? 12,000 from each tribe of Israel.<br /><a href=""https://philippekacou.org/en/predications/predications-ecrites?NumPred=131"">https://philippekacou.org/en/predications/predications-ecrites?NumPred=131</a><br /><br />🇬🇧<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23download"">#Download</a>: The app &quot;Prophet Kacou Philippe (Official)&quot; on Google or go to: <a href=""http://www.philippekacou.org/en"">www.philippekacou.org/en</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23prophetkacouphilippe"">#ProphetKacouPhilippe</a><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pkpchanneltv"">#PKPCHANNELTV</a>",Pasteur Akobé Benjamin - Officiel,2021-02-06T07:45:09Z,0

"19 There is no good religion on the earth, and no religion can lead a man to God. I am not telling you that you have to leave one religion to go to another religion. Salvation is to follow the living prophet of your time, and I am this prophet, I that speak to you. I am not a Christian prophet. I just have a Christian accent by birth just as I also have this skin colour and an African accent by birth. I am the prophet of all the religions, languages, nations and races of the earth.

"16 If medicine seeks for disease, it is because it has a remedy.  You see?  You preach the devil and you do his will without you knowing it. If you spend your time showing how this or that is a false banknote, you will never finish because the devil will always produce some! The earth is not searching for false banknotes but for the solution. Leave all the rest and show me the true banknote and when I see the false banknote, I will know it. And this is the Spirit of God! And even when a prophet messenger denounces everything that is false, he does it in accordance with a divine mandate. [Ed: The congregation says, &quot;Amen!&quot;].  <br /><br />17 Within the week, I spoke with a sister. And I said: sister, I want to pray for everyone on Sunday. And for this reason, I have selected seven testimonies of first order and yours is amongst them, do you want me to speak about it? And she said: &quot;Brother, that depends on you&quot;. I spoke with her and I found it good to leave it all because I think that they felt ashamed to testify. But, if I suffer from leprosy or AIDS and God has already healed me, why should I feel ashamed of it since I no more suffer from it?

"14 This Message says that the Protestant, evangelical churches, including the so-called revealed or restored churches and the missions and ministries are the image of the beast that is the Catholicism and have received its mark, its spirit that they call &quot;holy spirit&quot;. Even if they speak in tongues, baptise in the Name of Jesus Christ, resuscitate the dead and preach the whole Bible, the spirits that animate them and which they call “holy spirit” are the spirit of python, the spirit of divination. This Message says that a baptism for restitution is necessary for all the inhabitants of the earth.<br /><br />15 This Message says that the Louis Segond, Tob, Martin, Crampon, Thompson, Scofield, Ostervald, Colombe, Semeur, King James, New World Translation bibles and affiliates, including all reviewed and revised versions are fetish pots; and that the so-called Christian bookstores are the image of bookstores of occult, esoteric, mystic and divinatory sciences. And that the radios and TVs of Protestant and evangelical churches such as LMTV and BENIE TV are drains of all kinds of defilement and impurities before God.

"27 The Quran is a Judeo-Christian plagiarism with a barbaric and bloodthirsty language, the opposite of the language of Christ and in the form of ridiculous fables, without any sanctity. It is a war book. And to hide this shame, Muslims who were not born to be saved say that the Quran is untranslatable. Why are you so mean and dishonest? Was it in Arabic that Allah spoke to Moses and to Jesus and the prophets who came before Mahomet? Was the Angel Gabriel speaking in Arabic to Prophet Daniel and then to Mary? And you Muslims, everything that Mahomet copied from the Torah and the Gospel, was it in Arabic that God revealed it to the Jewish prophets?<br />🇬🇧<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23download"">#Download</a>: The app &quot;Prophet Kacou Philippe (Official)&quot; on Google or go to: <a href=""http://www.philippekacou.org/en"">www.philippekacou.org/en</a>",AKO Bonaventure,2021-02-03T07:47:14Z,0

And it shall come to pass that a man will not be able to shake hands with his brother or his best friend for fear of being contaminated with the disease. People shall walk without touching one another. Schools will be closed and you will hear people say: &quot;I&#39;m afraid of taking the underground or the bus, I am afraid of being contaminated.” You see?

"20 The ritual baths and purifications in the Ganges and the pilgrimages to Mecca and Israel have never removed a sin or a bad karma, but it is through the bath in the Message of the living prophet of your time that you will be purified and saved. Purification is not the bath of a mortal body in natural water but the bath of the eternal soul in the water of the living word of your time.

"28 Even in the face of death, you must not watch Islam send mankind to hell. And if some have sacrificed their souls to Satan to die in Islam, you, refuse to be that coward, that traitor who refuses to see the truth. If your parents chose to go to hell, you, refuse that religion you did not choose. Do not be a coward. Even if everyone around you is violent, commit without fear. Like Kunta Kinte, run away, run away, run away until your foot is cut off. And when they release dogs behind you, keep running away.

"11 When a prophet messenger is sent on earth, it’s because there is no more truth on earth and his Message is the only truth of his time. He is the depositary of the truth. He is the legislator of the Word of God in his time. You see? When Noah was preaching, no one could be saved unless by the Message of Noah. When Jeremiah was preaching, no one could be saved unless by the Message of Jeremiah. When Elijah was preaching, no one could be saved unless by the Message of Elijah. When the Lord Jesus was preaching there in the streets of Jerusalem, no one could be saved unless by the Message of the Lord Jesus. He said: &quot;No one comes to the Father unless by me&quot;. You see? When Martin Luther was preaching there in Germany, no one could be saved unless by the Message of Martin Luther. When John Wesley was preaching, no one could be saved on the whole face of the earth unless by the Message of John Wesley. When William Branham was preaching there in America, no one could be saved on the whole face of the earth unless by the Message of William Branham. And today, you cannot be saved but by the Message of Prophet Kacou Philippe. If you were a child of God in their time, you would believe in them and it is the same today.

"2 The kingdom of the Heavens has become like an A levels examination in which only one candidate will pass and will enter moksha or eternal paradise with all those who follow him. All the candidates are brilliant, wise and intelligent men, but one of them has a primary-school education and ignores why he is in the A levels examination room. And this man is me, Kacou Philippe, speaking to you. I said to myself in the vision: &quot;But what am I doing here in an A levels examination room? I do not have a good school level and what am I going to write?&quot;.<br /><br />3 This third vision of 1993 is a vision of first order in the plan of the eternal Salvation for our time. It is a major vision which must catch the attention of every inhabitant of the earth. How can a man be in an A levels examination room while he has a primary-school education and never took a philosophy course? And who are the other candidates who are sitting with me in this huge A Levels examination room? They are the leaders of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Confucianism, Taoism, Shintoism and Sikhism. And out of all of us, only one candidate will pass this A levels exam and will enter with all those who follow him into the eternal paradise that you call Nirvana.<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pkpchanneltv"">#PKPCHANNELTV</a><br /><a href=""http://www.philippekacou.org/"">www.philippekacou.org</a><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23prophetkacouphilippe"">#ProphetKacouPhilippe</a>",Landry Sery,2021-01-31T21:20:38Z,1

"From the island of Cyprus the island of the Saints Acts 13:4-5-6 hullo. Yes Armenia is a very-very  beutifull place but the most beutifull  thing Armenians have is her beutiful people. Being that I can not travel allow me a letter of love and respect of a spiritual nature title  &quot;Human beings are creations descended from light&quot;! being that Iam Greek Othodox.  The Church of Cyprus was  the second Church created by the Apostles after the one  in Jerusalem .Our first Bishop here was Lazarus the resurected friend of Lord Jesus!<br />        Human beings are creations descended from light!<br />Before man was send on exile in this new material world...he was created from light like angels are. The coming of Lord Jesus and the creation of His Church is of an therapeutic nature to return man back to the &quot;ancient beauty&quot; back to the presence o His creator God. There is one precondition however. [Mathew5:8] “Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God”  The main purpose of the life and worship  of the Church creaed by the oly Spirit 2000 year ago is not not the learning of spiritual truths but ~the purity of the heart~  needed that will enable each and everyone back to the presence of creator God!  <br />       Jesus did not come to teach philosophically but THERAPEUTICALLY. (to cure man from sin beginning with BAPTISM to enable him this way back to the presence of God!                                       <a href=""http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2013/03/the-foundations-of-orthodox.html"">http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2013/03/the-foundations-of-orthodox.html</a><br />       GOD IS LIGHT AND THE SAINTS IN THE HOLY SPIRIT BECOME LIGHT                                                                                                                                             The Image and Likeness of God                                                                      <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezItFNpdnVY&amp;feature=youtu.be"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezItFNpdnVY&amp;feature=youtu.be</a><br />        The Light of Mount Tabor                                                                                                                                                         <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smXD2cPKxxo&amp;t=381s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smXD2cPKxxo&amp;t=381s</a><br />        The first martyr Stephen [Acts: 6-15] &quot; 15 And all that sat in the He face council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel. &quot;His face was radiant with the Light of Grace of God just like the face of Moses was when he was speaking with God&quot;. This is kind of an experience in His Church (Greek Orthodox today) that has been known to take place with His Saints continuously throughout the 2000-year-old history of the Church<br />God is Light. The vision of Divine Light (returning to His presence) This is what Lord Jesus told St. Symeon when He became worthy to His presence in His divine Light. “It is me, God, Who became man for you; and behold that I have made you, as you see, and shall make you god”.                                                                                                                                           <a href=""http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/67"">http://www.monachos.net/content/patristics/studies-fathers/67</a><br />God’s Divine Light (His Presence) is  known in the heart! [Matthew 5-8] “BLESSED ARE THE PURE IN HEART- FOR THEY SHALL SEE GOD”. The presence of God can only be known in the heart where God is known to testify to His Self to those becoming worthy (become Holy). [2 Corinthians: 4:6]. “God makes His Light shine in our hearts, to bring us the knowledge of God’s glory shining in the face of Christ.<br />       His Saints after His Second Coming                                                                                                            [A Corinthians 15.41] “There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory”. There are described that they are going to be &quot;light and lights&quot; according to Paul depending on the proportion of their willingness while they were alive to obey and serve God and fellow human beings! According to St. Nicholas the Athonite , the bodies of the saints will be like that of the risen Christ and will be: Soft, Lightweight, Beautiful, Glorious, Transparent, Bright, Warm, and spiritual. The bodies of the Saints will differ from glory to glory as the light of the moon differs to the of the sun!<br />       HOLY LIGHT                                                                                                                                 <br />The Divine Presence in the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre Jerusalem, every Saturday Greek Orthodox Easter for the past 1670 years. The Holy Light seen in the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre is a MATERIAL light (like the sunlight is material light) provided by the Grace of God that appears every year as an invitation to all those Christians who left the Church the year 1054 AC during the schism when the Patriarchy of Rome left the Church in violation of [Ephesians 4:5]. The Holy Light also gives HOPE to all of the Orthodox Faithful who are not yet perfected who cannot yet see (partake) see God in His Divine Light and live. [Exodus 33:20] “And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live”. <a href=""http://www.oodegr.com/english/ekklisia/holylight.htm"">http://www.oodegr.com/english/ekklisia/holylight.htm</a><br />        Miracle during an ordinary Orthodox Baptism Two Catholics a man and woman decide to take the Orthodox Baptism.

"At About Things we have recently done a podcast on Nagorno-Karabakh and the future of this region with a renowned expert on post-Soviet space Thomas De Waal. The episode includes topics such as myth-making and dehumanisation in Armenian and Azerbaijani societies, as well as whether these two nations can ever learn to live together again.

But the hate muslims,كريم كريم,2021-02-13T09:08:56Z,1
"Prophet Messenger Kacou Philippe :<br />Kc.131:16 You Jews, Muslims, and Christians, on what basis do you reject me and despise me? Abdoulaye Ndiaye who is a great Muslim in Senegal believed in me and received his baptism because, as he was translating my Message into Wolof, he read it and he believed. But for Salvation, why don&#39;t you read me like Abdoulaye Ndiaye, Amadou Woury and Abou Muhammad? You prefer a dead Mahomet whom you did not know and you reject me, I, the Rasul that God sent you today? And in what year was Mahomet, who died in 632, your prophet?<br /><br />17 If you were following a living prophet, would you argue every year on the dates of the feasts and the appearance of the moon after Eid El-Fitr? And it is in this confusion that you want to lead mankind? If mankind followed God through his prophets, would there be several religions and would each religion have its holy book and its own practices? And do you not know that it’s a confusion and the devil is behind that? The way to lead the earth to God is one and this way is called living prophet. And to preach that there should no longer be prophets is a crime against humanity.<br /><br />18 When you look in the Bible, the Torah or the Quran, it is like a man looking at the stars in the sky. And behind these stars, there are thousands of galaxies and mysteries that no one can know unless God reveals them. Now God speaks only through a living prophet and what this prophet says, it’s what the priests, pastors and rabbis that he has established must take and preach to the whole earth. But so as not to submit to God, you have chosen religion. And yet the living prophet is the way to paradise while religion and holy books are the ways to hell.<br /><br />19 Christianity is submission to Satan through an old book called the holy Bible, Islam is submission to Satan through an old book called the holy Quran, and Judaism is submission to Satan through an old book called the Torah. But submission to God is to obey His Word that He has given through the living prophet of your time.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23prophetkacouphilippe"">#ProphetKacouPhilippe</a><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pkpchanneltv"">#PKPCHANNELTV</a>",TOURE OUSSEINI JEAN-LUC,2021-02-08T03:08:33Z,2

read up history and you&#39;l find out the significance of the mountain to the Armenian culture and Christianity. It was a political decision between Turkey and Russia that resulted the mountain to be on the Turkish side (due to easy delineation of borders via river Arcax).

"At About Things we have recently done a podcast on Nagorno-Karabakh and the future of this region with a renowned expert on post-Soviet space Thomas De Waal. The episode includes topics such as myth-making and dehumanisation in Armenian and Azerbaijani societies, as well as whether these two nations can ever learn to live together again. You might find our conversation quite interesting and we would love to hear you feedback:)",About Things Podcast,2021-04-07T00:26:10Z,1

"Dear Eva, unfortunately you are convincing people to visit armenia but you dont know how this country occupies the lands of its neighbors and forces other ethnic minorities to leave their centuries long homes.

"This video once again exposed Armenia&#39;s fake and artificial character. All these food like Sujuk, Lavash, Dolma, Ghapama are borrowed from Turkish, Middle Eastern cuisine. Armenia itself has been part of Turkish and Islamic empires since 7th century.  They lived as Christian subjects of Muslim empire.  Hence, Armenia is an artificial state founded by Russia in Southern Caucasus to serve as a military outpost. Even today Armenia&#39;s borders with Iran and Turkey are guarded by Russian soldiers.",AbdulKerim,2020-07-09T14:27:14Z,0

I truly believe that if Pork is safe to eat, like pig&#39;s feet, it helps to prove that you are what you eat. One of the traits is beautiful and overly kind looking eyes.

It features a lot of interaction between Turks and the dwindling Armenian population in many of historically Armenian cities which used to encompass a much larger area before the Ottomans and then Turks.  The Turkish government has apparently been blotting out any sign of an Armenian history and removing the ancient cemeteries in an effort to hide the Armenian history there.",Joachim Morgan,2020-03-16T16:45:27Z,4

"Lore Roman spend one night in Tsakhkadzor it’s beautiful in winter covered in snow. Ride Tsakhkadzor ropeway. Definitely visit Dilijan national park to get your nature fix. If you love wine, make sure to check out Saryan Steet in Yerevan. It’s wine lovers haven. It has many wine bars (“In Vino” is my favorite). Also in Yerevan, check out Cascade and Republic Square (I like it at night). A few bars you can check out in Yerevan Kong Yerevan (awesome DJs), Dargett craft beer (brewery and weekend bands usually), EL Chillout (rooftop with nice views), Daboo cocktail bar (amazing cocktails!). Sites to visit: Geghard (4th century monastery). The Wings of Tatev (reversible aerial tramway on the Guinness World Record for the longest reversible aerial tramway). Also, Khor Virab (on a good day the views of Mt Ararat are breathtaking). Gyumri is the second largest city in Armenia after Yerevan. If you have time to visit Gyumri make sure to check out Aslamazyan sisters House Museum, work of Mariam and Eranuhi Aslamazyan. Think Armenian Frida kahlo x2. Cherkezi Dzor in Gyumri amazing fish restaurant. Anyway, do your own research since we all have different tastes and priorities. Happy travels! 😄",Ani Zakaryan,2020-01-12T20:01:51Z,0

"@Bat Fastard It&#39;s not exactly like that. A very small amount of kurds, who were officers in the Ottoman empire did side with the Turks and were also responsible for the genocide of the Armenian people, but not obviously the vast majority. The Kurds did recognize their role in the Armenian genocide. Don&#39;t forget about a people that&#39;s also been endessly attacked by Turkey.",Márcia Almeida,2020-08-17T21:10:31Z,3

Name Azerbaijan comes from very early times , you can search about it - name Atropatena has been changed over the years like Adurbadaqan , Azurbagan and during Arab invasions , it started to be known as Azerbaijan . You talk about Azerbaijan Democratic Republic which is the first muslim democratic Republic in middle east and it is the successor of Safavid Empire so dont try to falsify the history .

"I am honoured to have Turkic genes. Unless some others who state that Turks have arrived from middle Asia. Turks have always been in Caucasus and Anatolia do some research. After the battle of Köse Dağ in 1243 between Seljuks and the Mongol Empire, Turkmen migration happened so Yörüks arrived to Anatolia. I don&#39;t even have an Asian phenotype. I own Jewish, Circassian and Turkic genes. Oh and I guess you have to do some research upon Göbekli Tepe it will open your mind to truth and will make you feel more illiterate. <br /><br />Ps: Azerbaijanians were always in the Caspian, dating till Khazaria or the Safavid dynasty. Unless for Armenians. <br /><br />Sincerely.",salim babashov,2019-11-26T20:53:00Z,0

"How They can be hospitable If their borders closed from two neighbouring countries ?  How they can be hospitable  if there lived thauthands Azerbaijani Turks but  they diplaced,  How ? How about killed thauthands people in Karabakh ? <br /> If you want mention about Genocide in 1918  by Otooman Turks.  Let&#39;s look from another point.  First of all if Turks wanted to eradicate Armenians, they would made it so Armenia was not strong nation o state,  from other glance If Turks killed million of Armenians there would not be any armenians now,  because,  In that time, Armenians were one million,  that is fact.  From the other point in that times there were killed or died millions of people of Turkey  as a result of 1th World War.   If you say it is true that million of Armenians killed, then  where are the funerals of million people ?  I do nut deny that there were not killed any Armenians.   But They killed because Armenians  betrayed Ottomans to Europenas.  That is why Ottoman Sultan ordered to punish by killing but not to massacre all nation,  again I want to mantion that if Ottoman Empire  wanted to do it, nowdays there would not be alive any Armenian. If you say something about Karabakh,  do not forget we have all records,  all record what you made to humanity in 1990 - 1994.  That records are spot on the humanity.",Ali Mammadov,2019-11-11T10:02:48Z,0

And I have relatives from that village. There is village near to Gomk which is called  Kapuyt. All of my family drove out from that village in 1988.

@Marianna Donikian We have done a podcast on Nagorno-Karabakh war and the future of this region with an expert on post-Soviet space. The episode includes topics such as reasons why Armenia lost the war and Russia&#39;s geopolitical interest in all of this. We are sure you will enjoy the discussion and we would love to hear your feedback:),About Things Podcast,2021-02-21T03:51:20Z,0
"Prophet Messenger Kacou Philippe :<br />Kc.131:16 You Jews, Muslims, and Christians, on what basis do you reject me and despise me? Abdoulaye Ndiaye who is a great Muslim in Senegal believed in me and received his baptism because, as he was translating my Message into Wolof, he read it and he believed. But for Salvation, why don&#39;t you read me like Abdoulaye Ndiaye, Amadou Woury and Abou Muhammad? You prefer a dead Mahomet whom you did not know and you reject me, I, the Rasul that God sent you today? And in what year was Mahomet, who died in 632, your prophet?<br /><br />17 If you were following a living prophet, would you argue every year on the dates of the feasts and the appearance of the moon after Eid El-Fitr? And it is in this confusion that you want to lead mankind? If mankind followed God through his prophets, would there be several religions and would each religion have its holy book and its own practices? And do you not know that it’s a confusion and the devil is behind that? The way to lead the earth to God is one and this way is called living prophet. And to preach that there should no longer be prophets is a crime against humanity.<br /><br />18 When you look in the Bible, the Torah or the Quran, it is like a man looking at the stars in the sky. And behind these stars, there are thousands of galaxies and mysteries that no one can know unless God reveals them. Now God speaks only through a living prophet and what this prophet says, it’s what the priests, pastors and rabbis that he has established must take and preach to the whole earth. But so as not to submit to God, you have chosen religion. And yet the living prophet is the way to paradise while religion and holy books are the ways to hell.<br /><br />19 Christianity is submission to Satan through an old book called the holy Bible, Islam is submission to Satan through an old book called the holy Quran, and Judaism is submission to Satan through an old book called the Torah. But submission to God is to obey His Word that He has given through the living prophet of your time.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23prophetkacouphilippe"">#ProphetKacouPhilippe</a><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pkpchanneltv"">#PKPCHANNELTV</a>",TOURE OUSSEINI JEAN-LUC,2021-02-08T03:09:41Z,1

"@Bat Fastard I don&#39;t count on anyone at this point, our only hope is our own people..as always. But there is one thing nobody realizes, if we fall and Turkey finally gets what it wants (border connection with all the other turkish nations) the whole world will face existential threat. Let&#39;s appreciate our Iranian neighbors for at least keeping the borders open, so we can get our supplies, while everyone turned on us. They are the only neighboring nation that kept our historical heritage safe in their country, and didn&#39;t do any harm to our people that live there. Even Georgia, which is now basically a turkish vassal, has betrayed us. Wanna appreciate Lebanon, Syria, Egypt and other Arab states, also India, for the same reasons. We don&#39;t have much friends, mate, and I don&#39;t want us to lose them also",sahak matevosyan,2020-10-14T23:21:52Z,0
"@sahak matevosyan I am afraid that this is all against Iran. Look at some poi t NATO is going to invade Azerbayjan for supporting the terrorism. At the same time they simply will help Armenia too, simply to save us, Armenians. Armenia is a missing puzzle for the supply forces against Iran. Meanwhile Russia will attack Azerbayjan too to stay in south Caucaus. That&#39;s the time when we will start our counterattack.",Bat Fastard,2020-10-14T23:01:20Z,0

"Prophet Messenger Kacou Philippe :<br />Kc.131:16 You Jews, Muslims, and Christians, on what basis do you reject me and despise me? Abdoulaye Ndiaye who is a great Muslim in Senegal believed in me and received his baptism because, as he was translating my Message into Wolof, he read it and he believed. But for Salvation, why don&#39;t you read me like Abdoulaye Ndiaye, Amadou Woury and Abou Muhammad? You prefer a dead Mahomet whom you did not know and you reject me, I, the Rasul that God sent you today? And in what year was Mahomet, who died in 632, your prophet?<br /><br />17 If you were following a living prophet, would you argue every year on the dates of the feasts and the appearance of the moon after Eid El-Fitr? And it is in this confusion that you want to lead mankind? If mankind followed God through his prophets, would there be several religions and would each religion have its holy book and its own practices? And do you not know that it’s a confusion and the devil is behind that? The way to lead the earth to God is one and this way is called living prophet. And to preach that there should no longer be prophets is a crime against humanity.<br /><br />18 When you look in the Bible, the Torah or the Quran, it is like a man looking at the stars in the sky. And behind these stars, there are thousands of galaxies and mysteries that no one can know unless God reveals them. Now God speaks only through a living prophet and what this prophet says, it’s what the priests, pastors and rabbis that he has established must take and preach to the whole earth. But so as not to submit to God, you have chosen religion. And yet the living prophet is the way to paradise while religion and holy books are the ways to hell.<br /><br />19 Christianity is submission to Satan through an old book called the holy Bible, Islam is submission to Satan through an old book called the holy Quran, and Judaism is submission to Satan through an old book called the Torah. But submission to God is to obey His Word that He has given through the living prophet of your time.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23prophetkacouphilippe"">#ProphetKacouPhilippe</a><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23pkpchanneltv"">#PKPCHANNELTV</a>",TOURE OUSSEINI JEAN-LUC,2021-02-08T03:08:49Z,1

Russia.ıt it reduced the amount of gas and oil it received from Russia and received more from Azerbaijan.This did not work for Russia.Russia is not happy with Pashinyan.There are also 5,000 Russian soldiers..Pashinyan wants to join NATO.But Russia doesn&#39;t want that.He wants to get rid of Pashinyan and send troops to Armenia and Azerbaijan.More, if I&#39;m clear.Azerbaijan and Armenia seem to be at war.But Turkey and Russia are fighting.Turkey in Russia, Libya and Syria karşısında.Biz they shot down their plane and they shot down our plane.Russia, Cyprus is ahead of us again <a href=""http://us.an/"">us.An</a> a friendly-looking enemy.Turkey and Azerbaijan have become very strong.This does not work for the United States and Russia.Politics is like a very difficult math problem.Armenia&#39;s population is decreasing every day.He doesn&#39;t need land.But other states-nations should not be tools in the power struggle of great States.Armenia is poor.Azerbaijan is rich.Russia wants to enter Azerbaijan with Armenia and leave it powerless on July 17, it was Armenia that attacked Tovuz.From Tovuz, Azerbaijan&#39;s oil and gas pipes were passing through <a href=""http://turkey.now/"">Turkey.Now</a> it was Armenia that broke the truce again. Mary, just because you&#39;re right won&#39;t do Armenia any good.And my right will not bring anything to Azerbaijan.He must see the facts and not be a puppet of great States.That&#39;s all that matters.Why did two nations that lived together for 1,000 years become enemies??Who made this hostility??And who profited from this hostility.The only salvation of Armenia,surrounded by mountains, is Turkey.The Turks should be friendly to the province",Yakup Keser,2020-10-12T07:44:56Z,1

"@An Na Excuse me but what? The unjustified facts? Seriously, your knowledge of history is trivial. You literally stated that Turkish tribes conquered Constantinopolis. So in your  realm the Ottoman Empire is counted as a tribe? Wow, well done. You have failed in explaining common historical knowledge. Secondly, İstanbul was always next to Sogut- Domanich (in which the Ottoman empire was based originally). Lastly I would like to broaden your fabricated knowledge that Turkish history does not exist by just stating one thing. Go and read the Encyclopedia. Stop infecting people with your fallacies. Thank you.",salim babashov,2019-12-28T22:11:26Z,0
"THERE ARE 6 TURKISH COUNTRIES FOR NOWADAYS. FROM EUROPE TO ASIA. STUPID PEOPLE WHO TELLS THAT TURKISH PEOPLE DOESN&#39;T HAVE HISTORY JUST LOOK ON THE MAP. TURKISH PEOPLE ALWAYS EXIST AND THEY ARE MOST POWERFUL NATION IN THE WORLD. armenians sit quite, don&#39;t bark on LIONS. WE let you live in Caucasus, even that you are not belong to that place! so live there quietly Gypsies",Don Draper,2019-12-27T08:28:51Z,1
"@Don Draper Turkish history doesn&#39;t even exist, I don&#39;t know what do they teach you in your schools but Turkish tribes could conquer Kostandnupolis only in 1453🤦 And Abdul Hamid was intended to have a great country which would stretch to Altay but Armenia didn&#39;t allow him to. So he said &quot;No Armenians, no problems&quot; and killed approximately 1.5 million Armenians💔",An Na,2019-12-20T17:34:31Z,3
