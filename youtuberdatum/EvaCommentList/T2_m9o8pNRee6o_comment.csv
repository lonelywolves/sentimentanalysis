What‚Äôs your heart guiding you to? Going off-grid and starting a homestead takes tremendous skill and a lot of work. There‚Äôs a lot of preparation involved if you want to set it up right and with dependency. I hope to do it myself in the next 18 months.

"Ya know, after years of travel and living in foreign countries, sometimes I wonder how my life would have been if I hadn&#39;t traveled. What if I had bought that little piece of land off grid and built that small little homestead by hand? What if I had joined a commune as I had always wanted to do? Well, here I am an American, 71 years old, half crippled and living on the tourist island of Koh Samui, Thailand (with the Thai) and I&#39;m looking at the next place that I want to go. And, I tell you what, I always measure my life with this one question. If you have to jump into the box (coffin) right now, would you have any regrets. If the answer can always be an emphatic &quot;NO&quot;, then you are absolutely on your life path. The house, the dog, and the horse. If it is for you, it will happen!  But as long as the road pulls you, then that&#39;s where you belong. But hey, that&#39;s just an old traveler&#39;s opinion.",Norman Brown,2021-03-25T14:26:56Z,7

So let&#39;s change the situation time again and again!<br />Thank you for being so open about your thoughts and feelings in this video. A.C.",Aglaia Cassata,2021-03-23T16:24:16Z,1

I guess it‚Äôs because I grew up in and around it. I find solace in solitude where silence is deafening... yet comforting. Like facing a challenge head on but feeling safe at the same time.

"All of your videos are a great inspiration. I&#39;ve always considered myself to be a really great guy, but like you, I&#39;m always looking for self improvement such as kindness, because I think the world needs that. Is it covid-19 as you say? I really don&#39;t know, but people are getting Ruder and selfish. Escalate rather than deescalate. As far as advice. I would say give yourself 3 months to relax and get in touch with yourself, so you don&#39;t burn out. And when you return to making videos and traveling, do it with a newfound sense of pride and a slower pace so that you can enjoy it more. I think the finished product will be better and you&#39;ll be happier doing it. As far as finding a cute Cottage somewhere to call your home. If I was you, I would retrace my steps, because there are many people you have stayed with that would probably have one for you, just for the asking. Take care I&#39;ve enjoyed all of your videos.",Sands of Time,2021-01-26T01:36:45Z,1

Many, many jobs have been lost to this pandemic (including mine), businesses have been lost, MANY industries have suffered huge losses &amp; everyone will be impacted for years to come. It is devastating, but we need to put public health first!  I can no longer work in my industry - I have to do something different, as do many.  We all have to adapt &amp; make sacrifices during this time.  You are not special or different.  Sorry that you don&#39;t like what&#39;s happening, but NO ONE DOES. What you are doing is incredibly irresponsible - I don&#39;t care how many negative tests you get.  This thing is changing everyday &amp; we are finding out new things about it every single day, such as the fact that you can still be infected even if you test negative.  You are not only putting yourself at risk, but others too &amp; it is attitudes and behaviors like yours that is causing this thing to spread and kill more people every single day.

Old and I have been traveling by myself meaning without my husband, but doing tours of different countries. I felt safer I suppose. But I do so enjoy being by myself. M0y husband doesn&#39;t want to travel and now with this China virus it has stopped. But the reason for me to write is to tell you that you are never alone. I believe the Bible as God&#39;s word to us and He says that He is with you always. He will never leave nor forsake you. He is an ever-present help in time of need. He loves you so much! You&#39;re a beautiful soul and Jesus wants to be strong in your life, one who loves unconditionally and wants to forgive you of all sin and for u to be born again into Him! Life becomes so exciting and I don&#39;t mean churchy stuff of rules and regulations.  No,,,,but of a personal relationship! Its so awesome....he has kept you safe on the road and you&#39;ve actually had an angel placed over your life at birth! We all have!  But anyway I hope u don&#39;t mind me sharing this with you. Time is short...God is raising up a remnant of people who live for him and will do great works throughout the earth...we have healing and miracles happening here and people being delivered of addictions and healed...thanks so much for your life!",Jeanne Cronce,2021-01-07T19:02:17Z,0

"In regards to which thoughts to trust... Dont trust any. They are just thoughts. If you were still inclined to find truth. Simply notice that thoughts are taking place. Carry on with life as normal and as you keep observing that thinking is happening, you will effortfully, without choice, become kinder, freer, and all the rest of the good stuff.",The Storm Keeper,2020-12-15T16:44:15Z,0

"Had exactly the same Ford Focus for a great many years...and it‚Äòs still running (though on its last leg, so to speak), though now under the steering of my ex-wife. ;-) jOurs is automatic, though - a luxury I searched for and found due to my American roots (and initial aversion to manual transmissions, like yours). But once you go manual, you‚Äòre free! :-) Nice vibe in all the videos of yours I‚Äòve viewed so far (including the Albanian and Romanian hikes). Time to join your subscriber base and help you build those dreams of yours.... EDIT (after finishing this video): A huge thumbs-up on the kindness!!!! You nailed it. Generosity of spirit is the huge and wonderful phenomenon that can and should now go ‚Äûviral‚Äú in these virus-ridden times. Staying open to whatever others think and feel, withholding moral judgement and practicing acceptance, being in touch with one‚Äòs own shadows that need attention in order to emerge as a more generous-spirited being, etc. This whole predicament can be a huge chance for humankind, and many are taking up the challenge. If only a critical mass of 10 or 15 percent of the population start to think and feel and act this way, then we can turn so many things around! Sure, it won‚Äòt happen in a year or two (more like a decade or two?), but let‚Äòs get started. Every small gesture of humanity reverberates far beyond the place it is given! You are obviously living and adventuring on that principle, so it‚Äòs great that your channel is apparently prospering and reaching a lot of souls, inspiring them to do the same, or similar, by your shining example.",Scott Becker,2020-12-15T14:06:54Z,0

"I hear people again and again say that they are trying to ‚Äúfind themselves‚Äù, in your case ‚Äúwhat do I really want?‚Äù, what they are really saying is that they are continually rejecting what IS in themselves or in their lives. We can‚Äôt find ourselves because we can‚Äôt lose ourselves; every feeling every thought, and the quality of life that they bring IS the self! React, and suffering results. Receive with tender attention, and fullness results. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and likewise ugliness and limitation are also in the eye of the beholder. The word be-hold says it all: we are always holding ourselves each moment in our beings, and how we hold is how we experience being held. This is the reality of the Now. ( Richard Moss paraphrased )<br />You asked for some wise insights, I offer this: hold yourself in the highest part of your being with complete trust in the process of life. There is no need for agonizing over what to choose, simply open yourself up and breathe, and say ‚ÄúI breathe therefore I receive!‚Äù And do just that, with tender attention. If you find yourself ‚Äútrying‚Äù stop! Because trying is lying, yours is not a journey that accepts the possibility of failure, make a choice, do or do not, those are your options, there is no value in playing the part of a victim of abundance, spare us those ‚Äúfirst world problems‚Äù, the question is not ‚Äúwhat do I want ?‚Äù, but ‚Äúhow do I want to receive ?‚Äù When the mind is perfectly clear, what IS, is what we want.",Daniel Brooks,2020-12-02T18:28:10Z,0
"You can settle down and still keep travelling occasionally when the wanderlust bubbles up: Just rent out your place to other travelers who come to <i>your</i> country (wherever you decide to settle down) airBnB style, maybe have a local friend keep an eye on the place so it stays clean / doesn&#39;t get totaled by squatters.  You could stay away for months, and renting out your place will supply some basic funding for your travels, when you&#39;re done wandering you still have a place to come home to.<br /><br />Also, any explanation why there&#39;s a random door standing in your backyard? üòÇ",Rey Nemaattori,2020-12-02T14:23:09Z,0

As you said the grass does seem greener at times.<br />It&#39;s funny because now I&#39;ve been called for completely different things...my journey is beginning again, but I&#39;m learning in life it is important to listen to those calls and to listen to your own happiness as things will work out best for you when you do so.<br />I&#39;m getting closer to 30 now and struggle with wanting to settle down or do more but I&#39;ve decided to stop listening to society and do what I want.

The Girl from the podcast had a friend who was also travelling 2 years long and he told her, that he doesn‚Äòt know if this is what he wants anymore. He actually wanted to settle somewhere. He said he needed contrast. I think maybe you need contrast too! Life is like a river! There isn‚Äòt one thing you do all live long and are absolutely passionate about. But there is one thing you do for a period of time that you are absolutely passionate about. But then after time you need a contrast to it.

There is very little evidence that sickness is contagious. It is looking more likely that sickness is our immune system‚Äôs response to new threats. Most of us live in toxic environments and eat food that isn‚Äôt healthy. We are being poisoned. Which is why we get sick. The myth of contagion is controlling us.

"I&#39;ve watched so many videos of yours, but today, you ask your listeners on how you distinguish between what it is that you really want?<br />Fickleness of mind sometimes is our worst enemy. If you change like the chameleon at every step of your journey towards your goals, you can never steady in your search for success. Your mind is the root of your desires. When it creates confusion of many wants and needs simultaneously, it misguides you to jump from goal to goal not knowing the real purpose of your activity. Short term goals become obstacles in dedicating yourself to long term achievements. When your heart tells you that you have listened to its call and done what your conscience tells you, you&#39;re sure to be on the way to achieving what you really want. Purity here means being consistent in purpose, thought, speech and action. If your purpose is clear; your thoughts are in consonance with your purpose; your speech is clearly expressive of your thoughts and your actions are based on this continuous process, then your actions and attitude will be pure and successful. Observing self-imposed rules and regulations too gives you a sense of purity and generates happiness in your life. After all, who can draw the lines of control in your life better than yourself?  But once you have determined the scope of your duties and responsibilities and defined the kind of person you wish to be, be faithful to your image of yourself and do not swerve from your ideals unless you wish to rewrite your life-plan in an improve, better manner. Btw ...always enjoy your journey. Surrender to your higher intelligence, which should guide you in making the best use of your abilities and time to chart out your path to success.üíöüå† subbed ‚òÄÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è",Armando Soriano,2020-11-02T09:02:54Z,0

"Should I stay or should I go? Great song, even better question.<br />I think you‚Äôve already done more already at your age than most people do in a lifetime. I‚Äôm 48 and have lived on 4 continents, have travelled, have run, been running for a long time. Only recently did I work out that it‚Äôs okay to stop and stay.<br />Keep asking these questions though, never stop asking the questions. You just don‚Äôt have to go to extremes to ask the questions.<br />You want to stay a while‚Ä¶stay. You can travel and explore and ask questions at any age. Sometimes you need to stop for a while to let all the experiences sink in and percolate. This will answer some questions and will create new questions, new directions, new interests.<br />It‚Äôs ok to want a simple life. You‚Äôve already touched a lot of people around the world with your vlog, so that even if you stopped now, you could still look back and be proud. Unless you want/need to change the world? If not, allow yourself to find beauty in the simplest of things and enjoy what life has to offer.<br />The best things in life are free‚Ä¶<br />Food for thought, I hope so.

"To anyone out there, keep your hands at the bottom of the steering wheel (or the sides of it), not at the top, especially if you live in America. If you have an accident with the car the airbag tends to blow your arms off in this setup. It&#39;s fine with European cars, but the Americans need to be able to hold all your weight even if you have not strapped yourself.<br />As to the manual gearboxes, yes, it&#39;s a bit confusing at first and you need to be thought (preferably in a car with the pedals on both front seats) But after a day or two it gets in your muscle memory and you don&#39;t even think about it. It comes down to - listen to the engine noise, clutch in, put into gear... if the engine is revving, go one up, if it&#39;s sluggish, go one down. That&#39;s all.<br />Right foot on the throttle and break pedals, left on the clutch only, never mix them.",svily0YT,2020-10-21T08:59:12Z,0

I really felt you at that time.<br /><br />No wonder why you travelled with one of the most beautiful and remarkable vloggers. You both have these braveness in exploring the wonders and beauty of the world. You are in good hands with mikmik as we fondly call him here in the Philippines. I hope you could visit to our country and freedive in the depths with Sherlyn, the gf of one of Mike&#39;s friend here staying in Moalboal, Cebu.

I agree, make plans, fight to stick to them, keep plans of exciting things at least 6 months in front of yourself!

We are of those who try to spread the truth through social media and we receive a lot of negativity and are called selfish and inconsiderate of those who are very scared, and we have to keep reminding ourselves that we are doing through love for everyone that we share this planet with as well as for future generation. We&#39;ve moved up in the mountains of Spain where life still is somewhat normal and being in nature keeps us sane. We&#39;ve adopted an abandoned dog and we&#39;re slowly building a campervan. We didn&#39;t think we would do that, not yet. We&#39;ve been travelling since we met 10 years ago and it&#39;s weird to stop and kind of settle, but it&#39;s what&#39;s best for us now.

One thing that really helped me in the past is realizing that you rarely make a choice forever. I think that finding your one true calling is an illusion, like the idea that you have one true soulmate. People grow and evolve throughout their life. There are many things out there for you. You can build a life with a house and a dog, and a few years later do something different. I am sure if you look at the last 5 years of your life, there have already been many changes. It&#39;s possible the next five years will again have that many changes!",Alice Lieutier,2020-10-16T14:48:58Z,0

"I wish I&#39;ve met spirited people like you when i visited Poland last August. I really like the country especially Krakow but I think most Poles doesn&#39;t like foreigners especially Asian. I was being very nice and respectful but most of the time i didn&#39;t really get good experience when i go to a restaurant, cafe or shops. I asked one of the local guy I&#39;ve met if what I&#39;ve experienced was typical, he said &quot;people must have mistaken me as Chinese&quot;. I dunno know what does it mean! May be because of Covid? I find the younger locals are more approachable like those who are working in Starbucks or Costa. As much as i wanna try local and traditional places but sometimes they just ignored me. Being a Filipino-Canadian, my experience in Poland was total opposite how we welcome and treat people regardless of your background. I don&#39;t think think all Europeans are like that because I also visited Greece and Amsterdam and people their are quite welcoming and nice. I was quite disappointed because I grew up admiring the Pope that&#39;s why I was excited to visit his country. Cheers!",Davis Urdaneta,2020-10-15T13:46:37Z,0

"That&#39;s exactly what I notice these days as well and what I worry about: Nobody trusting anyone and shying away from each other because thinking other people might infect you. But I really hope it will go the other way and once the situation passes we will all hug each other and party like crazy. Or we go the wrong way and continue to mistrust each other and stick to only family/close friends, avoiding everyone else (I see this often also comes with a nationalistic tone or of a tone of blaming people that travel for doing so - as if travel was the only problem that caused Covid). I think it will be half/half, some people going back to kindness, exploring other cultures and being nice to each other, and others just sticking to themselves and their little part of the world.",Jakob Miller,2020-10-14T19:20:41Z,1

Congratulations for being, quite literally, the most annoying travel vlogger I have seen on YouTube. Ever. To understand this statement in context: I have managed to watch 7 or 8 videos by LostLeBlanc and I thought he took the cake. I was wrong. I was oh so very wrong. You are. The title goes to you, Eva Zu Beck. Absolutely unbearable. I struggled to get through this click-bait of a video hoping that something would improve, that something would endear me to you (perhaps the bit where you fed Lola?) But, no, I kept secretly wishing that Lola would lunge at your face. Needless to say, this (first video) will be the last video I watch on your channel. May the algorithm never bring you across my path again. Please do the world a favour and take your self-involved nose-stuck-up-your-own-ass preachy bullshit and get a house somewhere with that loser that briefly appeared in your video, and don&#39;t film anymore. Ever. Please. Thank you.",trugsa,2020-10-14T16:46:11Z,0

"I resonate so much with this. The pandemic has affected my in so many ways. Rediscovering friendships and those that matter most, and elminating those that weren&#39;t healthy. Losing my job, and hoping that I can rediscover a new passion. I have always loved to travel, and can&#39;t wait to do so again. Your advice at the end of the vlog really was enlightening. I will be kinder, and be making as many plans as I can during these crazy times.

"Great vlog as always, I&#39;m 66 have traveled to many parts of the world too, often alone, sometimes with company, sometimes stayed in a house, sometimes on my yacht, I think the answer is if you are connected to the universe, you do what is right for you at the time, there have been very few regrets, a lot of happiness, a lot of exploring different cultures and people ,food, customs, my advice is to go with your institution and instincts, if it feels comfortable with someone in your life enjoy it, if you can&#39;t adjust, then that person is not the right one at this time, but if you can, there is something special sharing experiences with a loved one, maybe, like me, I have a home base now and a loved one, but still travel, still explore and experience what the universe brings me to look and see.

"Interesting perspectives. I think it is only in the west that the post pandemic world is distrusting and full of uncertainty. China is now post-COVID. The only major country to be so. The country&#39;s response has made the people more certain about their future, more confident about pursuing their hopes and dreams, and more confident that their choice of system of government is the right one for them. The things happening outside of the Middle Kingdom only reinforce to all Chinese that their country is heading in the right direction. 1.4 billion people is not an insignificant portion of the world",dyong888,2020-10-14T09:32:59Z,0

"It&#39;s the dilemma between what you want and what you need. Like any protagonist of her own story. What you want is to keep traveling, to keep exploring, to expand your horizons, network and business. What you need is something else, and you need to give yourself the permission to pursue it. That&#39;s the challenge, isn&#39;t it? Is it OK to settle down, to grow roots, and to pace oneself against the rhythm of another? Will it propel me, or hinder me? Can I bite into that apple without regrets? The growing need to have a dog, a horse, and some land is but a signal that you are ready to nest. But here is the good news: It&#39;s up to you to design your life with &quot;Ands&quot; instead of &quot;Ors&quot;. You can grow roots AND travel, instead of having to choose between the two. You can have a primary home AND a secondary home, instead of having to decide one way or another. The diversity of your experiences affords you to anchor a while, just like you did your car, and slowly explore the forest within; not be terrified but open, and patient.",Amr Assaid,2020-10-12T22:01:39Z,0

"I am romanian living currently in US, God bless you for the beautiful stories about my country and breathtaking images from our secular forests, last ones in Europe. I traveled a lot and know how it feels to always be on the road. From my point of view, it‚Äôs not a sustainable lifetime in terms of mental and emotional wellbeing. People need a place not only to come back to, but where they feel safe and stable, where they can build a real community, and have absolutely normal and healty habits: gardening, cooking, cleaning, growing a family. Although attractive and dangerously addictive, the virtual world is still virtual and steals you life, little by little. If your soul longs for a nest, start building it.ü§óü§óü§ó",Robert Coca,2020-10-12T20:58:23Z,49

"Eva, the Siberian Taiga may be a nice place to just vanish for a season.  I don&#39;t know exactly when, but what&#39;s coming to our world will be exceedingly dreadful and there is no stopping it; many will perish.  You must find your people, your community (wherever you are), do what only you do (and you do you so very well I might add).<br /><br />You are bare footed, which means you are grounded.  Life giving, healing energy can flow freely into you and through you, giving your cells charge, replenishing your bio systems.  Similarly, this is how you must approach our reality, be bare, be vulnerable, be raw, be genuine, be true, be you, and virtue will find you.  Take off your m**ks, breath unencumbered, aspirate!  Feel and know the truth with each breath.  Perfect love casts out fear and heals ALL.<br /><br />What does nature teach you?  What does the collective ideologies and consensus of our world teach you by contrast, and what can you extrapolate out of, and absorb from these which may benefit you thereby?  There&#39;s only one way which is perfect and right.  Walk after Love, the foundation of creation, and fear not.  Though a tempest is upon us, love and wisdom will lead you, direct you, teach you, protect you, and comfort you and yours.<br /><br />Love and respect!

"As you asked for some wisdom, I shall channel my inner Yoda! Many people do a variety of different things throughout their careers. What may be all consuming at one point in life, may be modified or replaced with other interests.<br /><br />Also, when you go really hard at a particular endeavor for, say 2 1/2 years, well, you might just need a break! Perhaps its time to relax a bit without the stress and energy of continual travel, and see what plans for the future, perhaps post COVID, that you might develop. <br /><br />COVID may have given much of the world an unasked for break from life. Some may not do much, while others will risk their lives on the front line, or be in school diligently studying, while some who have lost their jobs are going through a process of re-invention of themselves. <br /><br />For me, instead of just focusing on financial investment and real estate development, I am finishing up my jazz-60&#39;s-70&#39;s violin cd, and my book on Reversing Heart Disease, both of which are far more important than my business pursuits that pay the bills. Along with the usual training for my 26th marathon...whenever it will be safe to run that. <br /><br />So....your mind and body may be telling you to take a step back, and not kill yourself with all of the traveling that you have done. Just because you traveled intensively for 2 1/2 years doesn&#39;t mean you have to do that for the next 40 years. But....you have had experiences and an understanding of people and culture from around the world that very few have. From that,  you soon may have many great opportunities that will be presented. Wow, it sounds like those words might have just come straight from a Chinese fortune cookie! <br /><br />I end with my favorite quote, which is to &quot;follow your dreams and enjoy the trip&quot;. Truly you have been doing that, but every now and then our dreams change, and that allows for experiences that we might not even be able to imagine just yet. <br /><br />Be true to yourself.  Particularly if when traveling with somebody, if the pro&#39;s are outweighed by the cons. If freedom that is so necessary is sacrificed, that may merit reassessment. Ask yourself if you can be at the very top of your game with whomever your partner is. That is good advice for not only travel, but life.<br /><br />You always have my good wishes Eva zu Beck. You also have my great respect for doing that bike ride across Poland, with hardly any preparation, while carrying a lot of weight with all of your camping equipment. That took a great combination of guts and courage, along with a  wonderful dose of naievete. Also, great kudos for running a marathon in temps approaching 100 degrees. That was seriously a major accomplishment. <br /><br />Ms. zu Beck...follow your heart, but use your very good head, and you will choose the right fork in the road for your next adventure, perhaps from a home base. Maybe you would rent a home for a year, and do your thing. After all, stability is something that may become more attractive as one progresses on this journey of life.  <br /><br />I thank you for enhancing my understanding of the world and of the good people in it.    <br /><br />Be well, <br /><br />Randy",Randy Lazer,2020-10-12T03:06:55Z,0

"Really? August 1975, my mom taught me to drive a stick shift, an automatic transmission. <br /><br />I was 15 and a half, my first car. I am now over 60. <br /><br />Will never forget one time when my little sister was in the back seat. She kept repeating UGH, UGH, UGH when I was new to what a clutch was. <br /><br />Today? A fond memory. Back then? Could have killed her on the spot, lol! <br /><br />How are you going to finance the inherent repairs for such an old car coming down the pike, your future? Tens of thousands of US dollars? <br /><br />When you need a new part for an old car, you will need at least $3-$5 Thousand Dollars, the car will be in the shop for a week or two, how will you get about to get groceries, work or pay rent, etc? Does that Country even have parts readily available? If so, where? And at what cost will it take for the part to get to the shop, shop labor hours to pull put the parts, to get to the part, to replace said part, then put it all back together? <br /><br />Long-term financial planning is in short order, aka, now. <br /><br />A medical emergency? <br /><br />Medical insurance, co-pay (aka medical deductible, the part you pay after the health insurance company pays their share?)? <br /><br />Retirement funds? <br /><br />401k&#39;s. <br /><br />You are financially in over your head, sweetheart. It&#39;s nice to be young and free, right? <br /><br />All those old people you meet in your travels w missing teeth? <br /><br />Aren&#39;t they great, but how far away was a Dentist that had Novocaine to pull your rotten tooth out when their jaw was swollen and they couldn&#39;t eat... for the pain?? <br /><br />Have a sit-down w your parents and/or grandparents and their friends and a SERIOUS convo about it? <br /><br />Cannot always be young and living on someone else&#39;s dime, payroll. <br /><br />Retire some day? <br /><br />Good luck. <br /><br />You&#39;re going to need it. <br /><br />‚öòüôè‚ù§üôè‚öò, always.","Major Old Lady aka, Mom",2020-10-12T02:08:03Z,1

"Eva, did you know that the province of Bukovina is the main home of the polish minority in Romania??<br />Bukovina was famous in all of Central Europe as a land of tolerance, the place where a lot of ethnicities were living in harmony. Is also famous for the beautiful landscapes, and for the fact that although small in area, it gave a lot of personalities. Chernivtsi, its historical capital, now in Ukraine, is known for the beautiful architecture, and for being one of the cultural centers of Ukraine.<br />Is also famous for being, toghether with Maramures, a region where traditions are still kept quite intact.<br />But the biggest thing for wich Bukovina is renowned, and made it a brand, is the religious treasure, specifically the painted monasteries, a UNESCO site.<br />And not the least, Bukovina is the place where Principality of Moldavia originated, and where the well known Prince Stephen the Great ruled the country from the city of Suceava (there is a big fortress there).<br />I hope that maybe you will make a video showing what this magical place has to offer.<br />Btw, the polish minority lives in compact comunities around the town of Gura Humorului.",Nick Radevits,2020-10-12T01:07:35Z,1

Matter of fact, being in healthcare and treating feet, of those that I see with major chronic foot issues like bunions, hammer toes, plantar fasciitis, it is due to wearing and thus being dependent of shoes.   Wearing shoes a whole life leads to a foot that is thin and dainty, not being able to handle to much.  Living barefoot crates a robust foot that can handle so much more.

"Dear Eva, by the way i love to watch ur every vlog but this one very special, really special for me in a sense that besides of new place, people you interact with, and besides of many beautiful surprises you disclose to us but here you just spread love at its peak, so nice your every word, inspiration, reality and  motivational speech about your own and ongoing life. Besides like whatever you want to do, you want to make it at is perfection. Like you want to do usual but more real even. Something that make you satisfied with generous and kindness like beyond of its aspect horizons that is not usual but more real. You love nature and love is usual but real too. Things will get better regarding the ongoing situation of covid restrictions InshaAllah means hopefully and their will be no disappointment and uncertainity for sure.<br />This world is too big but too small sometime when you just found your mate that perfectly match what ur inspiration is about life and all ur plans about it.<br />I dont know you would love this idea but you love nature alot like ur life it is without any doubt becoz life itself a wisdom of master peace of nature and than these landscapes, valleys, mountains, forests, fountains, rivers, islands, springs, natural resources, dogs, herds of sheeps, shepperds, people and all these new places you live with ur life. Did you ever try to explore who is behind this beautiful creator of nature that you just love all of ur life for what reason and how  this all about nature and life is really about what, as you travel throughout in life, explore amazing places as long as you can, but what was all about the objective of this beautiful life and nature and natural phenomena, that must be usual but real, what is that real behind life and nature. Like Sun rises east everyday, earth is round and that is usual but what is real about it that make it happening, making and changing our perspectives, imaginations that beyond our thinking. <br />Remember The good thing is that you are at the finish line like in a race and you are just close to it, all you just need is a sense to feel it.<br /><br />And your weapons for life are just perfectly match to it kindness and generous approach towards life, likw do something for others particularly what others cant. But even in kindness and your all mood of life you always want to fill the gape that is necessary in ur point of view. You want to do something about anything that usually others do not, like you travel to places where others usually do not. Now when it comes to about life, belonging relationship a tiny home you live with, you want to make it but the way that usually others do not, something more into reality, like dreams come true not particularly for urself but for someone you belong with, like you go to places that deserve for its speciality that make a reason for u to visit, now i guess you want the same about belonging and relationship balance in life that is deserving for any particular reason. Congrats You are really generous and kind person, the rest you know very well that the world belongs to brave and you are brave enough too.<br />Sending you warm loveful hugs and love of sweet kisses. You might never note but you are very romantic too perfectly deserve for romantic belonging in life.<br />I really now perfectly more strongly belief that as much as this world is bigger for one hard to find whatever he wants the same it is small for you to find it but it is all about ur fate, it is all about what you are really striving for but nothing you can snatch.<br />Best wishes to you always Eva and wish you stay blessed, may almighty shower countless blessings upon you.

"Settling down can be great. I used to think, well, your life is over. Even if it&#39;s not marriage I saw girlfriends as the same thing minus the receipt aka marriage certificate. Marriage isn&#39;t just a word. It&#39;s a sentence. But without someone else, you&#39;re nothing but an echo in time that cares fades away quickly into nothing. And I&#39;ve seen travel channels where a family in an RV, seven kids, traveled, then they somehow hauled them in various parts of the world. And even if just friends for a while, hey, skin hunger starves the soul and body. You have a positive message. I try to mind my manners but they don&#39;t mind me. I&#39;ve been watching a guy on YouTube sing to different girls why beer in better than women only because growing up Mormon in their stifling, suffocating environment and being told marry marry, do like Genesis says and multiply, and I&#39;m thinking more like Genesis the rock group, I got lost in myself while hiding from others cuz they&#39;re pretty abusive, mean, petty and will nag you to an early grave whether your Bishop, mom or female friends, but I think they tried to take charge of my life because I didn&#39;t take charge of it before they did. They thought, hold my Starbucks, you dunno how to use your life. But they&#39;re wrong. I was stunned, in a daze, literally. I&#39;ve had several concussions that would normally kill, and I had an epiphany. Everyone needs a purpose. Mine is to be myself. And people think. Oh really? That&#39;s it? That&#39;s all? But look what humanity has accomplished. That&#39;s inside us all and until you make you your priority you&#39;ll become nothing, be a nobody, because you see and treat yourself that way.

"An interesting dilemma.  You have certainly taken the road less traveled. Yours is the only travel Vlog that I actually follow with any kind of regularity.  Why? Because you have such fresh views and they are so positive. I&#39;ve learned A LOT from the places you&#39;ve traveled and the people you&#39;ve met. Thank you. Your approach to unique destinations REALLY open up ones eyes as a way to see people the way they are, not the way they are cast.  That is a rare talent.  You are not just a Westerner telling other Westerners to come see this place and people, you are equally respected by the persons and nations you travel in.

"Thank you for a wise and insightful vlog. You captured the crux of our lives right now- a reset to the basic elements of life- kindness and respect for one another. It is so easy to step from this path. I think it is human nature, but also deep within all of us, we thrive on kindness. I think this global chapter has hopefully rekindled the notion that we all need the same basic glue to keep the balance.  This is what I miss most about travel- relating to one another on a very non-judgmental level, human to human. I try to be conscious to apply this second nature travel approach to every day situations and look forward to physical travel in 2021. Until then, may we all emerge and continue to be better, stronger, and kinder as a result. Thank you for your beautiful vlogs.",Maria Di Giovanni,2020-10-11T16:16:45Z,0

"Congratulations on your car. Manual Transmission has more benefits than an Automatic. Fuel economy, maintenance, horsepower and cost.  Parts should be inexpensive due to the age of the car. The more you drive, you will gain the confidence. Just do a weekly inspection and maintain its maintenance. Rust will be my biggest concern. The Future can become cloudy at times. What makes you happy and what pays the bills comes to my mind. I own a car and have reduced my belongings. I&#39;m going to put all my belongings in storage and move to Eastern Europe for 6 months, then to Asia and South America for the other 6 months. Best of luck in your future endeavors.

"Its 4am here in New Zealand, and many things roll with your words, our Prime Minister, Jacinda, talks of kindness, as indeed a lot of us do.

Questioning so many things and, learning the way of nature&#39;s calling. Taking part in creating large festivals on the West Coast, bringing people together to create and collectively join together as humans, that started in the 60&#39;s with me. I felt NZ was asleep.

"Dear Eva - Im sharing you my personal life to some extent. DO what gives YOU happiness. Relationships dont last forever. Dont invest yourself in something you are not sure about.  Do buy one small house which should be YOUR comfort zone, which gives you a sense of security and peace.  But keep travelling.  You have only one life - Dont remain stuck with anything that is not worth being stuck with. Analyse, give it all a deep thought. <br />Travelling, meeting new people, knowing their stories, knowing their lives, knowing their culture, history , cuisine, traditions ect is an experience worth millions. Relationships and &quot;Settling down&quot; is not worth your time and your life.  Do what makes YOU happy. Dont make your choices having someone else in your mind. Be selfish. Think only for yourself and if  the other person respects it  he will stick to you thru all thick and thin. If not - better be alone.  ive been living alone on and off for over 15 years now and believe me when im saying this, you will NOT like the sound of another human for long when you have been so used to being alone.  I cannot tolerate someone talking to me for more than an hour. I cannot tolerate a company for more than a few hours. I want to go back to my &quot;peace&quot;  my &quot;space&quot; asap.  Think very deeply on WHAT YOU WANT. Nothing else matters.",Buddha Piyao,2020-10-11T14:53:49Z,1
