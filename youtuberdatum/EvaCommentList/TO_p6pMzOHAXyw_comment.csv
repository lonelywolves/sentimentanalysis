"It hurts me to know as an Assyrian Chaldean, Kurdistan historically and literally is ASSYRIA and you&#39;ve not mentioned us one time. Our land was stolen when we were genocided, yet we still live there under silent occupation, almost like sheltered by the Kurds bcuz they use it against us that we are Christian, and we will get slaughtered if Kurdistan ever became the Nation of Asssyrian again. So for us it&#39;s kinda like letting people live in your home as protection from the outside slaughtering of muslim extremist. Sad.",Ricky Awadis,2021-04-04T21:31:28Z,0
"@Ricky Awadis I think I know the history of my city that I grew up in better. You should educate yourself more on the history of Kurds in the region. <br /><br /> Anyways, I really don&#39;t have any hatred towards Assyrians they are the indigenous people of the region just like we are. They have the right to learn in their language, live their culture and practice their religion just like everyone else. It&#39;s better to live in peace than create hatred.",Zori vesta,2021-04-17T11:34:04Z,0
@Zori vesta Then why do our people name our last names after Suleyman? Read history please. We are indigenous. Kurds are Iranians left over from the reign of king Cyrus(whom i respect very much),Ricky Awadis,2021-04-17T09:06:09Z,0

"Ways to obtain a Kurdish state<br />1- Everyone must feel and believe that we deserve a Kurdish state<br />2-Every Kurd must change faith and the feeling that he is persecuted and oppressed and without rights and feels and believes that he is the owner of the land, the state and the rights<br />3- Every Kurdish must feel and think that he is loved by all countries and parties and that everyone wants us goodness, state and rights<br />4- Sad songs should be stopped, especially those that show persecution and a feeling of the lack of rights and the state and songs that talk about treachery and all negatives and replace them with beloved national songs and show positive songs about the country that already exists<br />5- Books, press, TV programs and news about these items should be published in an annotated and positive manner everywhere<br />6- Children should be raised on the basis of these items<br />7- We must stop the idea that we are a victim and that we do not have the decision regarding our destiny as a people<br />8- We must change the idea that we are divided, that we are separate parties, and that we hate each other, to the idea of ​​containing every Kurd as a good citizen of the Kurdish state.<br />9 - Minds must be nourished with these items through the press and media and any methods and creativity in them<br />Of course this is not madness or a lie this is another<br />From the findings of science, the results are taken<br />The time of months and years, but I promise you<br />The state exists and the rights are obligatory with permission<br />God bless you",Rony Way,2020-05-23T13:53:27Z,0

"Not Kurdistan , it is Iraq . Kurdistan is not an independent country and those people who live in sulaymania do not have the right to call it &quot;Kurdistan &quot; and these Kurdish people do not have the right to make a flag representing a city that is not theirs . I fucking can&#39;t wait for the Iraqi government to kick these people out and throw them back to where they first migrated from . They act kind to foreigners just to get attention!!",Technique,2019-12-29T22:07:04Z,1

"Thank you for your videos, especially on your Kurdistan videos because few know about it. I&#39;m in Suly, there are a lot of worthy places you missed, like museum, cinema, the parks. And Howe come Badrkhan didn&#39;t take you to mount Azmar, on which at nights you can see Suly shining like a diamond. I would like to know if you saw the difference between Sulaimani and the other cities in terms of women&#39;s rights and how free girls are in the way they dress and everything else?<br />I would also like to point out that 95% of who you saw in the bazaar aren&#39;t from Suli, they are from the suburbs and villages and they have destroyed the view of the city, people of Suli don&#39;t sell stuff on carriages, with my utmost respect to them. All that remains is that at the end we are proud of Kurdistan&#39;s willingness to accept other nationalities with an open arm.",Nahro Barzngi,2019-12-26T10:33:38Z,0

"@Tada Tada Dass die Kurden erst seit den Osmanen in Anatolien leben ist eine weit verbreitete Lüge unter Türken. Kurden haben lange vor den Türken und sehr lange vor den Osmanen in in Anatolien gelebt: Die Osmanen erlangten erst ungefähr im Jahre 1517 die Kontrolle über die heutige Osttürkei. Man hat aber Informationen über Kurden, die lange, lange vor 1517 in der heutigen Osttürkei auf die Welt gekommen sind.

Which is why there are Kurds in iran,iraq,syria,Turkey. Areas they claim they lived for thousands of years proof you would need tell you no historic buildings or cities will back up their claim. The language is a made up language, it&#39;s got Turkish in it,farsi,iinglish,Arabic and so on. You cant prove it&#39;s TRUE everthing is all recent. Fake history all stolen.

"Ather Iqbal they are Muslim, but a strange kind of muslim. Trying to establish a nation and a soverign state by the help of christian imperial states, against their neighbouring muslim countries. This tribal community in the north of iraq ( call themselves as kurdistan) claim soil from neigbour muslim states as iraq, İran, Syrian and Turkey( my country I’m from İstanbul) by the help and support of their masters. They took significant milestones for their goals of kurdistan state. For instance this lovely kurdish brothers  of ours, claim 1/2 of Turkey as kurdistan. If you resist, then we find high-tech west supplied TOW misiles on our head balasted. They are somehow stubborn to create their own house within our house. But, we say you better request your soil from your masters or supporters instead of us. But, they fail and still request soil from us. Anyway, during those circumtances public relation efforts are required for sure. So, the lady who came from poland( l guess from western part or west prussian part of old german territory of before 1945 era) takes stage. Her mission is to soften the job by public relations. So iqbal, do not trust to eva zu beck or in my terms eva von braun. She has an imperialistic mission in our region, keep in your mind. We love as turks Pakistan...",sinan ak,2019-12-13T20:38:41Z,0
