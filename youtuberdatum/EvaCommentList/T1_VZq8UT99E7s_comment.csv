"Thanks for Your super films about Yemen, this country is a culturally rich with influence from many civilization foreign and Yemen was divided between the Ottoman and British Empire.Very sadly this continue untill our time between regime fanatic in Iran and Saudi Arabia! Why this nice Yemenis pay these lives on the war wihc not Yemens war! You show correct side of middle East which media in the West always will show that people in the middle East only wants war! Make me very sad when I see Yemenis has very difficult lives specifically children&#39;s! Poor people&#39;s has very kindly heart! I am not ethnic Arab but doesn&#39;t matter who I am!

"I know several people from Yemen, very nice people but they warn me don&#39;t go there, while it&#39;s safe for some, it&#39;s not safe for all. Where you are from, who you are, where in the country you go, and especially your opinion can put you in danger there. One friend who spent most of his life living in Yemen said &quot;Fishing in Yemen is not the same as fishing in Alaska, some people there do not want Non Muslims bringing their western views and habits that threaten traditional ways.&quot; He said, &quot;It&#39;s best for you to stay away.&quot;",tom phillips,2020-07-21T07:15:01Z,0

A wonderful journey and beautiful to see the hospitality of the people there and a little tip on riding the bike when changing down gears use the the throttle as you change down to a lower gear as it will help stabilise the bike and not make it feel as it will lock up. Believe me it’ll come in handy when you need to stop in a hurry . Also where you Look is where you go always look through the corners and power out of the corners enjoy the ride👍👍👍,Mick Angelhere's World,2020-04-30T08:13:08Z,0

I am more interested in knowing more about northern Jordan. Alot of people go to Petra but i know there are also ither beautiful places like Ajloun. May i request also vids about the Palestine refugees...?  I wonder how are they... Thank you sooo much! You are my eyes and feet in these kinds of travels!

Congrats on the bike - I&#39;ve been riding a few years now myself so please do these things!! Get some leather gloves (if you can) asap.  I know you&#39;re in a desert but if you should fall the first thing usually to hit the ground is your hands - it is instinctive. Even at 20 MPH the asphalt will act like a cheese grater and strip the flesh off your palms. Practice quick stops by using the back brake first then squeezing SLOWLY and EVENLY with the front brake. 70% of your stopping power is in the front brakes. Don&#39;t wait until you have to do a quick stop - you need muscle memory in case you panic - needs to be automatic. I know not much traffic there but you could come upon a hole or a rock suddenly. Start watching videos by MC Rider or Motojitsu. They have beginner videos to learn from. Ride safely!,defenestrationfan,2020-04-29T14:53:35Z,0
