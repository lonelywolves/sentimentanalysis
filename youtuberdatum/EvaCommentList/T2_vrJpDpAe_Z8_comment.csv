"Nice work Eva!   I did find a little irony in saying you don&#39;t need a massvie axe or dangerous saw, you just need a knife....whips out an expensive Benchmade fixed blade knife made in the USA.

"I&#39;m a firm believer in greasy food wrappers and napkins.  Put several twigs down to make it so air can get under it all, lay down a greasy napkin from last night&#39;s meal, a few more twigs and larger sticks, another greasy napkin or bag, and the rest of the wood in either a crosshatch pattern or a teepee.  It&#39;s like napalm.  It gets rid of litter, doesn&#39;t involve stinky petroleum, and even smells good.",eric moss,2020-12-18T12:03:56Z,0

Another great fire starter is a lint. You can find it in the corner of your pockets or if you have access to a dryer it’s smart to keep some in your backpack. You can mix it with petroleum jelly and it will stay waterproof that way!,Isabel Flohr,2020-11-09T21:34:30Z,1
"An important note about using crumpled paper as your fire starter: make sure that you don’t crumple it too tightly. There needs to be plenty of space for airflow and the flames to actually catch! <br />Great video Eva, thanks for it!",Isabel Flohr,2020-11-09T21:29:36Z,0

I build my fire differently and in an easier way, by placing a bigger pice of wooden on one side and lots of small sticks forming kind of a triangle with the grind and the big pice.

I go my own way. Unfortunately I&#39;m a man... so you&#39;ll probably fear me.  As a kid, I built Tee-Pees and forts in the woods or forest, ate wild blackberries right from the bush, bull-frog hunted in brooks with friends, and fished in small ponds for entire days. I&#39;m part Native American. A few years ago I traveled to &quot;Machu Pichu&quot; which I have photos and video of. I&#39;ve always done this alone. Touching the earth and stoned of &quot;Machu Picchu&quot; was so magical. The Peruvians were so friendly and humble. Some even spoke quechua- the language of the Inca.  I feel so alive when among new cultures and far away lands. May I contact you on FB??!",mmojorissen mmojorissen,2020-10-28T06:06:22Z,0

That’s so true that feeling of sitting in front of a fire keeping warm while drinking a cup of tea priceless.<br />However the real challenge is getting a fire going in the middle of the Bush when it has been bucketing down with rain all day and everything is soaked and the only source of firewood is all around you totally and utterly soaked.<br />My mates said it was impossible to build a fire in conditions like that and they even bet me fifty bucks that I would be unable to get a fire going well I got a fire going and fifty bucks .,Mick Angelhere's World,2020-10-26T04:38:01Z,2

Also I’ve notice they build the fire differently, usually they use dry branches and they leave them long lighting only the tops. I wonder if this gives them more control over the fire?

im outdoors often. and when its wet or raining i found sterno gel put under wood will get it going.. eventually lol. with a bit of steam and poping. im glad you said &quot;safe way&quot; the last thing you want outdoors is injury. maybe a first aid show next 🤕?,Joey Jennings,2020-10-25T13:20:13Z,0

"Wonderful that you can make a good burning fire when you put the wood up (teepee shape) which makes sense because heat wants to go up. But then you run out of wood very quickly. What I can imagine what you want is a fire where you have as long as possible warmth from the wood you have in your fire. So to start your fire the teepee shape is fine, but if the larger blocks of wood go on it, you have to stack them flat with space in between so that air can still pass through so that you can burn your firewood for as long as possible.",Thomas P,2020-10-25T13:18:02Z,3

Eva you’re right fire 🔥 is a magical thing. You’re releasing the sunlight that created the wood and has been holding it together. Science is still mesmerized by the process of photosynthesis where sunlight bombards chloroplasts dislodging oxygen molecules and allowing the remaining carbon and hydrogen molecules to unite making wood. Then you come by and light it releasing the stored sunlight 👍🔥,Bomba Deer,2020-10-25T13:09:40Z,1
