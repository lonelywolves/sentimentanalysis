"She sells a very wrong idea of what those countries are as very nice and peaceful and safe for women. She found a way to gain attention by being a white western woman receiving special treatment  in those places while local women in those places are being killed by men and has no rights. I&#39;ve been in a few Arabian countries, plus Lebanon and even living in Turkey which is a bit different but not that much in the small villages. It is dangerous for women and I&#39;ve experienced myself assault and hard moments travelling alone. She doesn&#39;t travel all by herself as she prays, she does have protection and a team what else she would be in danger as everyone of us are.<br />I traveled for food research and those countries she mentioned are simply amazing regarding this, but yet they do think different about women rights. She&#39;s playing a very wrong role pretending is everything fun and safe just because she is protected, white and paid for playing this role. What a shame!",Miss Foccacia,2021-04-27T22:34:42Z,0

"I have to disagree with you, I have muslim friends with passports stamps from the countries you mentioned. They did not have any issues. Border crossing in the states is easy. Big brother knows a about you, remember this. You are no threat to them a nobody in regards to security. The intelligence across the planet know, who is and who isn&#39;t a threat. Furthermore, your passport will tell them a lot about you. I discuss this once with a person who works at the border control &amp; they know if you had a fine for fast driving or any other criminal record, this was the reason why they did not care. It has nothing to do with the fact the you are white. I am aware of racism and the stigma in regards to skin colour, however border control is a different matter. I was picked up as a white female few times whilst flying and had my luggage checked and so on, I would call it pure bad luck. The worst check for me was crossing the border between USA and Canada... Israel was great! Despite I had a stamp from UAE, I told them I flew to the Maldives via UAE and all was sorted.

"It is not as simple as you said in this video. In 1997, I traveled as a white American male from Los Angeles to Paris. When I got off the plane, I wasn‚Äôt challenged at all, I just dropped off a card I completed at a booth with an incredibly bored looking guy. Then during the same trip, I crossed the English Channel, and received one of the most difficult entries I‚Äôve ever had, perhaps because of my Irish surname, but once the agent determined I should be allowed to enter, his total demeanor changes with a ‚Äúhave a pleasant visit‚Äù...<br /><br />But after 9/11, things obviously changed. When I entered Paris - from Mexico City - with a Mexican artist that I was traveling with, there was no bored agent, but two agents who spent at least 10 minutes questioning us. They seemed convinced only when this artist‚Äôs drawings were shown them...<br /><br />As a white retired American living in Tijuana, I have had problems when American border agents of Philippine descent play the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm more American than you‚Äù game, saying ‚ÄúWhat?

You had a visa - that helps. I‚Äòm a white blonde woman that got questionned for an hour or two hours at the US border in the past. They were always respectful but they asked some uncomfortable questions not because I didn‚Äòt want them to know the answer but because I knew my answer wasn‚Äòt the one they wanted to hear as their number 1 favourite answer. I just treated it with an it‚Äòs their job attitude. After all I knew what could be expecting me at the border so I came prepared with just the right kind of documents. I always felt like their main goal was to make sure you follow the law and leave again after whatever time you were granted in their country.

"Love your content, it‚Äôs world class, truly. But please leave out the identity politics / privilege ideologies you were indoctrinated with at Oxford. <br /><br />What you call Racial Profiling is simply a process known as Triaging in security and medical professions (ER etc). It prioritises the order of importance based on statistics to optimise outcome with a limited amount of resources. Not all dark-skinned people are bad (no one in power claims that). But that is not mutually exclusive with the fact that most Islamic extremism attacks (which killed plenty across the globe, not just the West) has been perpetrated predominantly by dark skinned people. A 12-year old girl raised in a safe and middle class household in Stockholm doesn‚Äôt get the same ‚Äòrisk-score‚Äô as a 28 year old man from a conflict area (Sudan, Iran etc). <br /><br />Don‚Äôt mix up race with data-based decision making (which is what everyone does every day). Having lived in Asia for 10+ years and 1 year in Africa I can tell you that systems in the West are the least racist place in the world.

"She has this all wrong. The people working in customs at the airports are mostly NOT white. So if there is racial profiling going, it is being done by non-white people against non-white people.  So if you want to improve things, then tell the non-white customs employees to stop racially profiling non-white people.  Bottom line: it is not a white privilege problem.

I am latin (Venezuelan), not white, Venezuelan passport 9I need Visa, maybe like you) with PLENTY of entries to non-friendly country to USA and I didn&#39;t have EVER any problem to enter in the U.S.A. I think is you have VISA in your passport (your country is not on the Waiver program) is the &quot;best&quot;, because you previous need to be in an interview LONGEr and BIGGER than the short interview at the border, they had time to check about you, check your records, and time for everything. In one year I entered to U.S.A. about 20 times (in one year) and NEVER a problem, always very friendly. I used many different entry port (Houston mostly, Atlanta, NY-Newark, Honolulu) and always amazing, for me, the entry to U.S.A. ar more or less the fasters... and for example, entering in Russia (I don&#39;t need VISA) always is a chaos, they want/ask for my VISA and I don&#39;t need, the need to call, ask and ask.... uffffff and also I have pages and pages of entry in Russia....",Hipolito A.

Eva I love your videos and the places you are lucky to see unlike myself as an Israeli. And also as an Israeli who lives in the US i tell you this: it makes total sense that people who visited in those type of counties will be question about their past visits. Come on! Those places fullfil with strong terror it makes total sense that the USA will protect her people from any terror.<br />I have been in Egypt many times and I love it there (Israel have a peace agreement with Egypt) but I was definitely aware of the existence of ISIS in Sinai. I was aware that national security in Israel or in the US or any other western country might ask me for my visit there. Same for Lebanon that let Hizballah stay.<br />It has nothing to do with your color before you buy a ticket to the US you send a copy of you visa and passport number they knew all about you before.

"Excuse me but this is a very naive opinion about borders that exclusively suits your needs. Your opinion is going from the tenet that the world is from everyone and that people can&#39;t defend their own. It is a completely idealistic position devoid from reality and human necessaty.<br />The value of meeting other people from other cultures I can largely agree with but it is most certainly not the most important human interest. You can only do that when you realise and live your own life, not just borrow from others. Yes, you can learn from others but you can&#39;t just collect experiences from others as if they are some goodies. You too have darker sides, start learning and grow up!<br />Sure, not an easy message. But think of it, do you want to do this for the rest of your life? Very fast you will run out of space in this small world of ours. At some time you realise that somehow you missed the boat. Travelling is never a goal in itself.",Walhalla Dome,2020-08-02T06:12:00Z,0

In Poland it&#39;s even worse. Starting from the airport... good luck getting easily stamped (even when having a valid visa) if you have a 3rd world passport. You walk in the most open minded places in Poland (Krakow for example) and you&#39;d still get all types of stares &amp; looks from locals. You get harassed in buses for wearing a headscarf if you&#39;re a Muslim or if you&#39;re Asian or basically non European... these are all personal experiences that happened to me when I visited in 2018 with a group of ethnically diverse friends that I met at a student exchange program.,MED SAMMY,2020-07-31T10:05:11Z,0

"What I don&#39;t understand  - there has  been people radicalising in those countries who then came back to Germany where they had grown up. I don&#39;t see such questioning as per se racial profiling to harass but a legitimate questioning by professionals to prevent their country from harm. They have a right to do so. I got questioned so many times when visiting Croatia and Serbia because they suspected us to  have drugs. I was not offended. We had to sometimes wait half a day. Yes, it&#39;s annoying. But we fit their profile of &quot;white&quot; ppl going there with drugs and we simply remained calm, respectful and were on our way again. A problem would be if they framed us.

"Oh geeze. Here is another one of those &quot;vloggers&quot; that think they are changing the world with videos like these. You entering on a Polish passport had to file online for an ESTA (eVisa) prior to boarding the plane..guarantee you that you are given a gender and race-neutral risk assessment before you ever got on the plane. You were run through the DHS, Interpol, NoFly list, and terrorism databases.  Obviously you haven&#39;t been affiliated with terrorism and you didn&#39;t step off a plane from Peru or Colombia. Risk assessment saves CBP a tremendous amount of time to better filter out travelers that are coming into the US without a legitimate purpose. Sorry, but don&#39;t start in with the &quot;my race&quot; and &quot;my gender&quot; spiel. As a avid traveler myself, I can tell you passenger risk assessment is 100% how they do things.

"I had this kind of experience, not for entering into a country, but in an administration in my country. I needed a certificate that proved that I had French nationality and I had to go at an office where around 30-40 people were waiting so I was expecting a quite long waiting. But these other people were there because they were foreigners (and most of them were not white-coloured) and needed some documents for staying in France. When they saw me in the line, they immediately came at me and asked me what I needed. They immediately took my application form and asked me to come back two days later - that document normally needed one week or more to be done. So I came back two days later and when the guy saw me in the waiting room, he opened a desk for me.",Yvan Giovanetti,2020-07-20T10:05:11Z,1

DHS does not know what countries you&#39;ve been to. The difficult countries don&#39;t share who enters them with the US. That is exactly why they look at the stamps in your passport when you enter.

"I have a few issues with your claim to racial injustice by the immigration personnel and system. The YouTuber you mentioned (Drew) is also white, but got questioned. Also, the United States does not have good relations with some of these countries, so questioning is reasonable in my opinion. I also believe that the reason you were not questioned is because you have a large social media platform, meaning that your information is much more easily accessible to determine your purposes of travel. Your passport is a European one, so it may played a role in you not being questioned. Anyway, I do agree that there are still issues in the United States and other countries alike where minorities are more targeted simply based off of their place of origin, look, or complexion, but I find these instances to be less common, however this should obviously be fixed and is nonetheless inexcusable.

"Eva, the way you keep talking about your superior passport and your white skin supremacy is very annoying. Seems you don&#39;t know that before joining the EU in 2004, Polish ppl were among the poorest on earth. In a few months after joining, 600k Poles immigrated to the UK and were doing menial jobs there. A short while ago you were in Saudi Arabia. The hospitality you saw there you would never ever dream of anywhere else on the planet. And FYI, Saudis who welcomed you with open hearts and open homes do know that if they were to visit your country most probably they wouldn&#39;t be welcome at all. Until recently, and maybe still to this mo, Poland has been one of very few countries where ppl of colour are seen as a threat and where it&#39;s ok to tell jokes about blacks.

Your British accent also does nothing for you at Immigration because most of the world teaches British English to foreigners, especially in the Middle East. It wasn&#39;t your looks. It was your citizenship being Polish. Poland is our strongest ally in the entire world. That is the very sound reason why you we let in. Add to it that Poland has recently acquired agreement with the US for 3-month paperless visa, just as we have had for a long time going to Poland. So the relations between the US and Poland are some of the strongest we have. I could tell you more about our military and intelligence cooperation, factories in Poland, fighter jets and Polish pilots trained as trainers, etc...

He and his buddies planned a vacation to New York City. When he returned, he complained, they&#39;re all foreigners in NY City! I thought that was amusing.

"You need to acknowledge that ALL the associated problems exist first. Racial profiling is just one aspect. For example countries run by Islamic law or even large amounts of Islamic influence in government have always been a mess and when they immigrate they bring the issues with them. Islamic culture/religion is non compatible with western culture. That is why when they move countries they all live together in the same suburbs, push everyone else out and create crime and violence. These are undeniable facts and statistics. The reality is in a place like Australia, nobody could care less what your DNA is, but most people here do not want any sort of backward Islamic influence or even religious influence at all. It is always dangerous for any group of people to state that they know the irrefutable truth about everything and that everyone else is ignorant. Also as surely you are aware, most people do not want to deal with economic migrants, eg. from Pakistan or Africa. It is not everyone else&#39;s problem to pay increased tax to feed them. You might not like it, but the closer a capitalist society comes to socialism, the closer it is to collapse. People won&#39;t go to work to feed others, the system does not work.

As a white American who has traveled all over the Middle East and Africa I would say it all depends on the agent at the border crossing. I&#39;m sure there are some who are racist which is a condition not limited to white people despite what Eva seems to imply but many are just A-holes trying to assert their authority or collect a bribe. At the Moroccan border coming from Algeria by car I was denied entry once and had to walk back to the Algerian border station where they were nice enough to let me crash on the floor. Next day I tried again but was denied again. Back to Algeria where they told me to try the train to Morocco. Walked on a path to the tracks where there was a train stop and found out there was no train for a few hours so decided to take a walk by the tracks where I inadvertently crossed into Morocco (there was no sign) and got arrested by the friendliest border guards who served me a delicious chicken lunch and then drove me to the closest Moroccan city (Oujda) and dropped me at the jail for a mandatory week of couchsurfing in a crowded cold and nasty cell with no couch or bed. Nice border guards but the border agents were jerks. So much for white privilege.,Steven Kritzler,2020-01-25T13:22:51Z,0

At least the ppl can visit and walk in my german city at night w/t fear of hostage, murder etc...

This is based on her successful entry into the country. It seems likely she was trying to pick a fight since she showed up wearing a headscarf in an apparent attempt to further exacerbate any suspicions generated by the stamps in her passport.

"Hi Eva, I have watched a couple of your very informative videos. I myself am an immigrant to the USA who immigrated from Guatemala in my very early 20s. My family &amp; friends told me that my reasons for coming were too hard to accomplish because I had less than $100 in my pocket &amp; couldn&#39;t speak a word of English. I supported myself &amp; studied the English language to make it my own. A semester before I graduated electrical engineering school I was offered a position at NASA JPL &amp; worked on my first satellite who went to the Planet Venus &amp; mapped 98% of the planet Venus &amp; made gravity measurements. I graduated &amp; eventually I got a job working for another NASA Program called International Space Station (Power Management &amp; Distribution Unit) and worked there for 3 years &amp; then I worked for Lockheed Martin for 10 years &amp; I have worked for other aerospace companies up to this point I have worked for a variety of NASA, Military and Commercial programs in the USA, Canada (Winnipeg) &amp; Europe (Germany). My last contract was with NASA Goddard last year &amp; I&#39;m waiting for a job offer from a European Nano Satellite Company that will require me to work in the USA but with initial training in Vienna, Austria. In 2016 I was invited by the Science, Technology &amp; Innovation Secretary of the Guatemalan Government to come with all expenses paid to share my humble story &amp; motivate young students. My trip &amp; time paid off because one student my old alma mater military school told me that he was about to drop out of school but when he heard my humble reaching my American Dream story, he told me that that motivated him. I felt blessed &amp; surprised that I could make a difference in somebody&#39;s life. I&#39;m now trying to see how I can become also a motivational speaker and motivate young students with my motto that things are difficult but not impossible, and if I can do it anybody can do it as well. BTW, from my father&#39;s side, we&#39;re from Spanish descend &amp; my great-grandfather was a French man who moved to Guatemala &amp; married my great-grandmother. I&#39;m blessed with 4 successful children, a doctor, a business guy, a nurse &amp; a recent high school grad who is attending pre-nursing school. Thanks for letting me share my story. I love your stories. It&#39;s amazing the experiences you have achieved at such a young age, traveling through all of those historic places. I&#39;ll be honored to meet you in person one day.

You should decline the income which results from that &quot;profiling&quot;. Think these things through before speak.",Chris J,2019-12-30T18:17:25Z,0

"Now her explanations regarding why she was allowed entrance to the US don&#39;t add up. In fact she seems to be unaware what she has done and will probably affect her future endeavors in the US.<br /><br /><br />She&#39;s apparently a Polish citizen and she thus entered the US under the VWP and using an ESTA, since she entered the country by air at JFK. Now, her ESTA must be older than the visit portrayed in this video or then she has outright lied with her ESTA eligility questionaire, after having visited Iran, Irak and Syria. The stamps are irrelevant. Visiting Iran, Iraq and Syria voids your VWP eligibility for good, except for those involved in military operations (e.g. Operation Atalanta). Even, if the ESTA questions were answered in connection to a previous trip, prior to this ME tour, it still doesn&#39;t waive the fact that the VWP eligibility is void, no matter do you already have a current ESTA with the passport. Now this means she will quite possibly have trouble getting a US visa, if it turns out she hasn&#39;t been truthful. She can be denied a visa and especially deported, if she tries again to visit under any current ESTA and it turns out she&#39;s not truthful.<br /><br /><br />Absolutely utter stupidity to try enter the US without getting duly a visa and under a false pretense under the VWP, when one has forfeited the eligibility. OTOH, it would be a lesson learned.<br /><br /><br />Furthermore: she&#39;s far from being a neutral, &quot;just a travel vlogger&quot; as she likes to portray herself. Saying that the US is tough due to some Western stuff, is being ignorant to the very real issues related to e.g. Al-Shabaab and ISIL.",Deep Blue Mania,2019-12-25T15:02:17Z,0

"Just reading some of the comments below was a very interesting experience on its own. For those who are &quot;born privileged&quot; and in denial that racial profiling actually exists when crossing borders, I invite you to spend a day at any passport control office and see for yourselves! I respect other countries&#39; laws and I am a law abiding person no matter where I go, so I totally understand the checks, the questions and all these things depending on where you come from, it&#39;s the right of the country to protect itself against perceived threats coming in from certain other countries. What I do mind, however, are biased, sarcastic, rude, disrespectful, and inhuman immigration officers at the passport control or within an embassy. I experienced racial profiling during border crossing 3 times in the US, 1 time in a US consulate, and one time in a Romanian consulate. It certainly leaves a bitter taste in your mouth and ruins your experience, especially when you&#39;re escorted to a room, sat there with other people who cannot even speak a word of English and have absolutely nothing in common with you other than the fact that they&#39;re &quot;not western looking&quot; for close to 5 hours after a 15-16 hours flight from the other side of the planet and then told to &quot;JUST SIT UNTIL YOUR NAME IS CALLED&quot; when you politely ask why you were escorted to this place and if there is any particular issue.

"As an American citizen, a person of color with an Islamic sounding name. I do travel a lot abroad but not in those places. I have even some black and white European friends who visit the US often.  I do believe racial profiling exists and real. However, I think your case was not merely pure luck, or they let you go because of color or national origin, etc.<br />This simple answer is that they checked you thoroughly even while you were in flight and probably watched your vlogs too and saw you were no threat. If still need the long answer and how here it goes: <br /><br /><br />There is something called Advance Passenger Information System (APIS). US congress passed back in 2005,  allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to review passenger information prior to boarding for commercial flights arriving into or departing from the United States and for commercial vessels destined for or departing the United States.<br /><br /><br />In other words, every airline, including the one you were on your way to the US, was legally required to transmit the complete manifest for all passengers 30 minutes prior to departure. APIS includes even your seat information and whether you asked the airline to serve you specific dietary requirements, Halal, Kosher, vegetarian etc. So they have 8 hours of your flight to check you before you land.<br />Besides, if you have a passport of one of the countries participating in the  Visa Waiver Program (VWP) then you must have obtained approval through ESTA prior to traveling to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program. In ESTA form, you will have to list every country you traveled. If not a member of VWP countries, then you must have presented your passport to US consulate, and they would have checked you anyway.",Abdul Weheliye,2019-10-27T13:41:42Z,235

"I just want to point out that the two clips you referenced as to people getting interrogated were both men. So perhaps they treat men more harshly than women when it comes to national security? Women are often more trusted or not considered a threat, so perhaps they saw you, a young kind beautiful woman with good English speaking skills and considered you not a threat. It has nothing to do with skin colour as white men get questioned all the time.

"A German friend of mine who looked very European and he was searched thoroughly at the JFK on his way out of the country. It is just pure luck dear. There is random screening. You come to the US with a renewed EU passport next time, cleared of visas, and who knows how you are going to be treated :)) And the treatment may vary from gate to gate. The US customs people at the gates &quot;are&quot; from different races, first of all. They are not specifically giving clearance to &quot;all white&quot; people, despite countless unfair incidents take place - which I definitely not vouch for. The other thing about customs officers (everywhere) is, they are authorized with wider powers we can imagine because where they question you is technically, still outside the gates, meaning outside the country you are trying to enter. So, they are outside the legal jurisdiction of the country they are authorized to represent. So they have wider powers than the regular law enforcement guys. It is a great responsibility to let incoming people through the &quot;doors&quot; ahead. Even citizens are questioned for long time. It is sometimes the &quot;hunch&quot; they feel, so they trust you and let you past the gates.",Alparslan Esmer,2019-10-21T04:21:53Z,28

They had discovered that it was a trend for illegal immigrants to have greek ID cards and travel. Were they wrong to do that? Nope. I traveled one time during that period, and I saw that they stopped one couple of elderly people. I was angry at first, but then I heard them talk and saw the womans ID.

Finally, security was satisfied, and he was allowed to pass. As I was next to have my bag searched, the security man looked at me and said, &#39;Apologies for the delay, sir. We are doing our level best to....&#39; Then, in addition to his apology, he only glanced at my bag and let me pass. What?

I was never asked, never have been, either.

I get invited to have a visit in a small room with immigration whenever I return to the U.S. (like Drew Binsky, who is also Caucasian). Perhaps your experience was based more on your sex rather than the color of your skin. Not too many attractive, young, female terrorists that I am aware of.

And that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing.<br />To call her a SJW regarding this video and racial profiling does not qualify as hate speech or name calling . <br /><a href=""https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/social-justice-warrior/photos"">https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/social-justice-warrior/photos</a>",Nia Koch,2019-09-25T14:02:41Z,0

"You were let in easily exactly for the reasons you stated, kinda. However...it‚Äôs not 100% because of your ‚Äúwhite privilege.‚Äù It does play a factor, but mainly you had it easier because you‚Äôre a woman. You‚Äôre not the typical ‚Äúterrorist type‚Äù male that people associate with. You know, the types we see in movies that hijack planes and distort peoples perception of middle easterners. <br /><br />You‚Äôre a western looking woman. So you had it easier. More so, you‚Äôre a really beautiful woman. And that gets you access to places and things that others don‚Äôt...it‚Äôs just a reality.  I bet if you were older, wearing a full burqa, you would absolutely be questioned. <br /><br />Now, the same white privilege you speak of is used in reverse when us westerners enter non-western countries.   <br /><br />I‚Äôm a regular Mexican-American guy, but I have very light features. And when I travel to places in the Middle East, or Asia, some South American countries, or Africa...I get stopped and questioned and interrogated for looking ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù or just because I‚Äôm a single male traveling alone. That raises flags. And I‚Äôve had foreign customs agents tell me the process would be easier if I didn‚Äôt look so ‚Äúwestern.‚Äù  <br />I was turned away from Egypt because ‚ÄúI looked to be of military age, and I‚Äôm a single male traveling alone.‚Äù Wtf?! Do they think I‚Äôm trying to start a government coup?  It wasn‚Äôt fair, but i understand they have the same national security concerns that we Americans do. However, if I looked like you they wouldn‚Äôt think twice about letting me in ASAP. <br /><br /><br />Basically, they (non western countries) discriminate against westerners the same exact way westerners discriminate against everyone else!!

You seem to imply that immigration officers should all just look the other way and not be concerned by passport stamps from Syria, Yemen, or Afghanistan.

"Of course white people have privilege in western countries. It&#39;s our countries. Our countries are in the west.<br />Each citizen is privileged in its own country.<br /><br /><br />But it&#39;s also truth, that in the west there are so many immigrants (much more than white people in the east or south) who now live and have citizenship there. Those people were prone to identify with their original country they came from and did also terrorist actions in Europe and in US. Did you sleep last 20 years?

"As far as border crossings go, they aren&#39;t unconscious racial profiling decisions - they&#39;re conscious ones. It&#39;s a fact that racial profiling works for border security and preventing terrorism. Israel has some of the strictest border security procedures of all countries and, despite being surrounded by countries that hate the state and plot attacks against it, it has a relatively low amount of terrorism there especially as of recent. Their security admits to excessively using racial profiling to secure its borders.<br /><br /><br />Is it fair for a different skin colour individual to be questioned more just because of their skin colour? Perhaps not. But all those stamps you have are suspicious, and if I&#39;m being completely honest, I&#39;d rather not have the effectiveness of border security undermined so people don&#39;t feel like they were racially targeted because they have to go through extra security processing.",Random Guy,2019-09-02T01:02:24Z,4

"Very interesting video, for the most part, I don&#39;t believe in white privilege. People shouldn&#39;t live their lives feeling disadvantaged because there not white.<br />I dont think its healthy for people to live that way. However when it comes to border crossings, you do have a valid point.<br /><br />Even though I&#39;m Australian born, I do have Pakistani background, I&#39;m a man, and have dark skin, why would they let me through? I would definately fit the profile of a terrorist, despite not being one.<br />I have no desire to visit the United States, so I guess from my point of view it doesn&#39;t matter.

You wouldn‚Äôt make a video if Japan did this, why does it matter if the United States does their due diligence in stopping any terrorist into getting into the country? You‚Äôre not American, it‚Äôs not a race thing, and it‚Äôs really rude to make a video talking about things you clearly don‚Äôt understand.

@Mike Haq <br />Even kim kardashian was recently accused in the states of having a &quot;white savior complex&quot; and also of appropriating black culture as a white woman. Does kim kardashian even look white to you? And what psych*path would dedicate his life to demonizing a group of people for being white? Sometimes I really hope russians and east european countries will get together and bomb the sh1t out of your country. I hate violence but your country&#39;s been pushing it for a while.,FriendlyCrooc,2019-10-21T12:54:50Z,1
@Mike Haq <br />Skin color does not determine your race. Are japanese people white?<br />My friend you&#39;re either a racist or a troII or an lgnoramus or just waaaaaaaaaaaay too misinformed which is typical for your countrymen.<br />&quot;White race&quot; is the name that the descendants of celts and germanics who formed the countries of the west gave themselves. <br />You americans love labeling all caucasians &quot;white&quot; and blame them for slavery and segregation in north america. Even the most peaceful and persecuted people throughout history like the people of the balkan region who suffered persecution mostly by the hands of what you racists refer to as PEOPLE OF COLOR.<br />What can you expect from a racist country build on racist hate for racist people.,FriendlyCrooc,2019-10-21T12:33:11Z,3
"@Mike Haq  His point is that even a girl from Poland is so brainwashed by the leftist propaganda that she is having this &#39;white guilt&#39; about whatever happened in North America in the prior centuries, even if Poland had nothing to do with it, actually polish people were oppressed themselves with their country divided between Russia, Austria and Prussia.",duras200,2019-10-21T10:24:25Z,1
