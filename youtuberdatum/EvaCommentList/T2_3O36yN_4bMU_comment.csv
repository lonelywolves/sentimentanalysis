"I find extremely hard to believe that you could do 150k in that bike, it was a terrible bike to do this kind of challenge, looked extremely heavy, even before adding all your equipment, 150K is what a very fit  cyclist with a less than 7 kilo road bike would do in an endurance session.<br />but if you did, youre a fucking beast.",juncear youtube,2021-04-28T06:58:49Z,0

"This video was an amazing journey i had just started cycling and cycling just 20-30 kms is soo much work out that you don&#39;t have energy to ride the next day and you rode a cycle for 100+ km a day and day again one after another for 10 days was just amazing and it has encouraged me, my soul to do much more. The point when you stopped and cried touched me and at that moment i felt what your grandad meant by what he wrote in that book it doesn&#39;t matter if its 100 or 300 or 1000 kms you reach there when you reach there and you power through and finished the ride I felt the excitement here sitting in front of my computer i was like &quot;YAY you made it&quot; <b>Best 30 minutes of my life !</b>",Thanos,2021-04-24T05:05:14Z,0

"Wow! Congrats! I didn&#39;t know Poland was such a beautiful country with such warm people. I have never there, but I should definitely visit your home country. It kinda reminds me of my home country Bulgaria, but more neat and tidy.<br />Your journey reminds me of how I started biking. I was just like you - maybe the longest distance I have ever made on bike was 20km. And out of nowhere I decided to participate in a race which is in particular a full circle around the mountain near Sofia - Vitosha mountain. The race is completely offroad in the mountain and with mountain bikes - a very tough race for a complete newbie like me. And the distance is 100km. So, I managed to finish and I was so happy! Since then, I have been riding mountain bike for 5 years already and it has become more than a hobby - maybe a passion.<br />So, never say you won&#39;t ride bicycle again, you don&#39;t know what you are missing. :) I hope you are well now and do what you love.

"What a fun thing to do. Your Grandfather would have been so proud. I laughed because I had such a hard time switching to google maps from paper maps.  As an older adult, it is what i grew up with. It is very hard to not have the bigger picture of the paper maps. I was also surprised how far you planned to go every day. You are so amazing. Thanks for this wonderful vlog post. My one word of advice... if you should do another journey... i would say slow down and truly enjoy the journey,. The faster you go the more you miss... it took me years to realize this, and why sometimes I prefer to travel on my own. You have inspired me.",anneirenej,2021-04-21T14:47:38Z,0

"On my first classic style multi day cycle tour, I burned (totally over worked) my legs on my first day pushing 132km into the mountains. That was in 1987 I was 39.  I was in agony for five days. Today I cannot think of travelling without my trike. I have made a lot of mistakes but I have never let them stop me and I have learned from them. Travelling/touring by bike will bring you in touch with so many people and the experiences will change you. So tell your stories and listen to the stories of others. When bad things happen, start looking for the good things as they are always there. If two bad thing happen I tend to get really excited. Everything always works out. A friend and cycle tourer, who is heading on the downhill to 90, said to me once and I translated into Latin &quot;Satis est tempus instituendi dum in itinere.&quot; or &quot;There is time enough to train on tour.&quot;. I prefer maps as it lends a different perspective to the journey, though I always carry a smart phone (no data plan) and a GPS with OSM.  And don&#39;t over plan, though it is always good to have an idea where the choke points might be.",Hermann Kerr,2021-04-21T03:16:41Z,0

I had been a regular bike commuter before, but that commute was 5..7 km one trip.<br />Next thing I knew I cycled across France in 5 days to arrive at the sea as quickly as possible. Longest day trip 225 km, not something I would recommend (nor something I could do anymore; bones to creaky...) good thing about this: the following three weeks around Brittany at 50..100 km a day were a breeze...<br />I recently revived this tour, but just the Brittany part. Still fun to be in the saddle and experience the countryside.",HotelPapa100,2021-04-14T09:13:48Z,0
"I quickly went back to paper maps on my last tour (Brittany, France) Keeping a smartphone powered on a trip where you often camp in the rough is just too much of a  hassle (even if I have a good charger driven by the hub dynamo.)",HotelPapa100,2021-04-14T08:07:37Z,0

"I have done a lot of cycling holidays with paper maps and my tent on the back of the bike. Like asking people where to go too. Never cycled through poland though. 100 km a day is a lot if you are not used to it and have hills and mountains. I usually do about 80 km, so I still have time to visit a castle, museum or such. I do have a cycling computer that shows my speed and distance, so I know how far I have gone If it is raining the whole day, I usually stay put for the day. I take a rest day every ten days or so. I like it much more with someone and not alone. It makes it easier too when things don&#39;t go your way. Like your video and your adventure.",Casper Egas,2021-04-12T06:09:54Z,0

Your ride is super cringeworthy to watch. Full of real and unnecessary risks to yourself. Your decision to use paper maps when you have no experience. Not knowing how to fix your bike. How to protect your ears from traffic. Wearing the right gear in bad weather. Blindly trusting strangers — telling them where you’re going no less!

"Yeah its hard going some days, more so if your camping and even harder if you dont speak the local language. Google maps is relatively a recent thing for bike travellers, when I was cycling in Africa about 18 yrs ago, the smallest map we could get was a michellin  one of all of Africa. Also in my experience asking locals for directions can be very confusing as they will sometimes just tell you any directions even if they dont really know just to appear knowledgeable but at the same time friendly😀",chris Walter,2021-04-02T08:11:36Z,0

"Well, that was exciting. I just hope that you do continue cycling. Your body does count for something. Get it in shape, and do it again! You&#39;re young (and beautiful) and you can do it. How about Poland south to north? (There&#39;d be more downhills than uphills.) I plan to ride from Budapest to Ordzykon (southern Poland). You talked about mountains, the Tatras are mountains, and I will need to cross them! This is why I watched your video, Poland, the land of my maternal grandmother! You crossed by her village on Day 7, I think. I hope to see you on the road! Keep going! You CAN do it... AND LOVE IT!!",Steven Herrmann,2021-03-26T16:14:50Z,0

"Eva,<br />Wanted to share with you.  <br />80 years ago on June 1941 my mother escaped with her family their little town in Artsiz, Bessarabia because of the German invasion and ended up in Cheptura, Tajikistan where they stayed till the war was over. <br />My father escaped his home in Lodz, Polland after the Germans invaded it, escaped to the USSR, was arrested in Grodno as a Polish soldjer and sent to Siberia were he stayed till the German&#39;s invaded the USSR, and went to Tajikistan.<br />So, they both went to Tajikistan - my Father from Arkhangelsk in Siberia and my mother from Artsiz in Bessarabia beginning July 1941.<br />They met and married there and after the war returned.  Their families murdered their property robbed - there was no room for then in Europe anymore and founf refuge in DC Camps.<br />I was born in a DC Camp in Germany near Berchtersgarten - in a big mansion that was in a German military airport where Hitler used to stay when he flew there on his way to Berchtersgarten, and turned by the American army a hospital for DC&#39;s after the war. <br />Hilter started the war with Poland and invaded the USSR, making my parents flee to Tajikistan and meet there. Methink some justice was done to be born in his mansion...<br />I&#39;m 74 now, live in Israel where my parents came to in 1948, and when the skies open after the Corona, intend to follow my parent&#39;s voyage during and right after the war. <br />Start in this little town in Bessarabia (now Ukraine), follow my mother&#39;s jurney: through Ukraine, Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan. <br />Then back to Russia where I intend to find the graves of My Mother&#39;s father (which I&#39;m named after him) who is burried in Novosibirsk near his son that was a soldier in the Red Army,  got sick and died one day after his father came from Tajikistan to see his health, went sick too on the way, and  the two are burried together.<br />Visit my Father&#39;s home in Lodz and his father&#39;s grave there, and a place in Germany where my father was kept as a Polish pow and escaped from there making his way by foot at nights all the way to Lodz. <br />Visit the museum in a Lodz train station from where my Father&#39;s two sisters were sent to be suffocated in chelmno, and visit where their bones laid bare till few years ago together with some 250,000 Jews murdered near the small Polish village there.<br />My father escaped his home right after they were shipped to the Lodz Getto, but only one of his three sisters was willing to go along with him.<br />Follow my parents&#39; way through Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Germany - where I was born in Ainring, the southest town in Germany. <br />There I&#39;ll end my tour (My parents and me came to Israel with a ship from Marseille). <br />It&#39;s all together about 15,000 km (excludindg the flights from and back Israel). <br />What do you say/advice, if at all, as a traveller, to me? Thanks in any case :-)",Shmuel Kaufman,2021-03-06T23:57:50Z,2

Went to the market in Haifa to by carps for my wife to prepare gefilte fish for the Seder night. Waiting for the seller to cut and prepare them - a lady waiting there too tells me someting in Russian. <br /><br />&quot;Sory, I don&#39;t speak Russian&quot;. &quot;My mother does, she is from Bessarbia&quot;. The lady smiles a big one: &quot;I&#39;m from Kishinev !&quot; (Kishinev - Chișinău  in Romanian - is the Capital city of today&#39;s Moldova, in the past in Bessarabia).  <br /><br />I tell her that my mother is from Artsiz (a vlitle town in Bessrabia, today part of Ukraine). The lady&#39;s smile turns wider. &quot;My mother is from Artsiz!!&quot; Turns out the lady lives in Kisinev and came to Isreal to visit her mother that lives here now. <br /><br />Took her phone number to give my mother, that is now 96, thanks God, healthy, bright and intelligent as ever. Almost all her friends and family from youth are already in a better world and she was very hapy for the oportunity to speak with someone from Bessarbia. <br /><br />To meet at random in a market in Haifa, Israel someone born in the small town of Artsiz in former Besarabia - is, I gather, a good omen for me to indeed make that journey :-)",Shmuel Kaufman,2021-03-18T00:29:22Z,0

"Wow! Your bike trip here was something that was similar to my own solo 14-day &quot;Tour de Malaysia&quot; in 2001. At that time there was no real smartphone &amp; all I used to navigate was my Lonely Planet: Malaysia travel book. Like you, I hardly trained &amp; I was so spartan for my trip - just 2 sets of quick-dry clothes (one to wear &amp; wash to dry overnight, the other to wear for the day). I had no laptop, iPad &amp; definitely no drone during those days... My total little backpack was 5kg &amp; ironically, after the first day, I threw away my brand new sleeping bag (took off a whole load of weight off my back). :P <br /><br />Watching your video here totally brought back a lot of old memories almost 2 decades ago. Loved your grandpa&#39;s quotes &amp; even though you broke down on the day you had to ride your bike on your flip-flops. That was both a moment of Strength (as you fight with the internal struggles within your mind) &amp; also, even comical when you were complaining about the hassle of needing to pee. :D <br /><br />I also remembered all the interesting people whom I had met along the journey &amp; similarly, had commented how &quot;brave&quot; I was to do this trip all by myself. Dziękuję again... for showing a rare part of Polska that is off the beaten track. :)",franz1c,2021-02-22T14:51:24Z,0

I&#39;ve a question that&#39;s bugging me. I&#39;ve come across many people uploading their solo journey. The only question is how you guys record video while doing other activity alone. For eg. There this segment at the beginning of this video of you disappearing off in a distance while your camera is still recording. Then there&#39;s an aerial shot presumably with a drone. And in the drone shot we can see you riding the bike. How are you able to record using the drone and riding the bike at the same time. Is someone else with you?,Ranjit Cherian,2021-02-22T09:59:54Z,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O36yN_4bMU&amp;t=9m21s"">9:21</a> Taking 150k a day when you have no previous experience in cycling is extremely good. It&#39;s quite understandable you feel exhausted at the end of your journey, but in all honesty does your exhaustion justify that you don&#39;t want to give cycling another go in the future ever again? You should reconsider on the principle that the more you practise, the more benefits you take out of your activity, and the more pleasure will result to you in the long run.",Alphonse Duponey,2021-02-19T08:34:48Z,0

"You just became one of my heroes! I am a long distance cyclist and I have 2 things that I tell everyone about what I do... 1. Pain is beauty. (It reveals what we are truly made from). 2. The strongest and weakest muscle in the body is located between our ears. (This is the defining factor of what we need to complete any goal that we set before ourselves). Small word of love and support, get a better bike, prepare for the next ride better, and remember our rides never get easier we just got faster and longer (Eddy Merckx)",Gentleman Geoff,2021-02-10T16:57:51Z,4

"Loved this, your determination and belief that you can do it and your &#39;bravery&#39;!! I am also a well travelled grandfather and this has inspired me to get my &#39;story&#39; together for my grandchildren , who are too young at the moment to understand. I travelled round the World in a Land Rover from 1967 to 69 and have since been to lots of different places which include long distance cycle touring in France and Spain, using only paper maps. Long distance cycling is a mind game but is also about muscle training, even though I have not cycled a long distance for a while, because of a health problem, my leg muscles have remembered!  The more you cycle the easier it gets.I hope you enjoy long distance cycling again and have lots more amazing adventures!! Wooooohooooo!!",Richard Bent,2021-01-17T13:47:07Z,0

I would love to do a trip similar to yours while I&#39;m still young enough at 71, and healthy enough to do it! Your solo tour across Poland, encouraged me to work towards my goal... You&#39;re a very brave young woman. You are correct in assuming that what drove you was not your body but your mind and your heart. As long as you have the motivation..the ambition and the heart to get through the pain, the loneliness, the despair, you can actually achieve far more than you think you&#39;re capable of doing!

Also this way means you don&#39;t have to actually remember what they&#39;re telling you, you can just focus on the hello, smiling and gratitude parts, which will make them feel really good too cos they&#39;ll think they&#39;re really good at explaining things or that they&#39;re not but they like you because you understood them.

"Hi, watched this from Boston,MA USA. Really proud of you to even attempt a solo without any experience! Your grandfather would be proud of your spirit!  I did my first solo from Boston to Key West at age 58...the most terrifying thing was the morning I left. So many reasons not to go but there wasn’t one day I regretted going. 41 days, 2200 miles, stealth Ed camped every night in the woods! After I got there I swore never again! Mentally and physically brutal! Last September I must have forgotten how difficult it was because I went on another solo trip from Boston attempting to reach San Diego,CA. Made it as far as New Mexico and got caught in huge blizzard(snow storm) sat for (3) days in the mountains and was picked up by the sheriffs and taken back to El Paso, TX...4620 miles, 72 days and 800 miles short of my destination. My heart was broken because I didn’t finish...Next September one more ride from Boston to Key West...63 years old! God bless you in your journey through life...Andrew",Andrew Carlson,2021-01-08T00:26:17Z,0
unprepared means unenjoyable ride...you never want to ride again because you did not even understand your own machine...when you said &quot;wheely thing&quot;  as you attempted to put your chain on i was surprized you were even on a bike...you have all the video equipment and electronics but did hot want to use google maps...this made your trip worse and your weight load heavier...every ounce in the mountains is more pain,michael inserra,2021-01-07T23:42:58Z,0

Wow miss you&#39;re so brave!<br /><br />Your country is so beautiful!<br /><br />Hello from philippines😊😁<br /><br />Nice words from your late grandfather❤ I would take it as a motivation for my long rides too😊. I prefer that kind of journal with pictures instead of uploading it on social medias😊 I like to keep my memories private and only for my family and close ones.<br /><br />Believe me I already said those words too that I would never do long rides again but after a month or couple of months my body and mind seeks the peaceful ambient of nature while traversing the road with my bike😊 again and ready to hit a long ride again and again😊,w i n d s o r,2021-01-03T08:07:48Z,0

Middle of the first day we were struck with multiple tornadoes, all around us.  Torrential rains, unbelievable winds, all you could do was hunker down under a bush or something and hang on for dear life.  They eventually passed and the second day only 500 continued on.

"I am a cyclist who travels in Europe. I followed and met so many lonely people or couples on simple bicycles even on a trottinette kickboard (without assistance) crossing the world, particularly hostile environment, deserts ... So to see a strong and young woman, who feels like she has made a feat by traveling 9 days with certainly difficult times but in nature, without excessive heat or cold, without pollution, without rationing or particular danger. And to conclude that she will never ride a bicycle again, I find that negative and very imature! You reminded me of those American women who live in front of screens and whose only exploits are shopping. I hope you grow mentally and go on real expeditions where you have to draw your strength to survive or at least achieve a real challenge. On the other hand, well done for the variety of shots with the addition of a drone, it was well done. Also, you could have taken the time to explore the cultural, historical side. Sometimes, it brings a human touch to take an interest in local people, especially the elderly, through interviews.",Didier Pierre,2020-12-12T09:22:37Z,0

Cycle touring is great fun really...if you don&#39;t obsess about a destination.   How?    Don&#39;t have a destination.   Just start cycling in the morning and stop when feel tired.   Being able to go wild camping helps.   Wild camping is more fun than official campsites too.  Using your phone and apps can help you find a place sleep that&#39;s really close by.    Also too cycle really slowly so that at no point is it strenuous.    Get special low gearing for the bike to help with hills.   Also too don&#39;t &quot;break&quot; the chain and keep it on those wheelie things...;-)  lol.,Jamie McCulloch,2020-12-04T11:10:28Z,0

"Bike touring does not require massive touring experence, but planning is a great help.  I have bicycled around Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Maine, and Vermont.  <br /><br />A good bike with a large range gearing, lights, racks etc is better. Print maps are fine. Wet shoes can be warn with shoping bags over the socks. Although I&#39;d have checked to see if the campground had laundry facilities (washer/dryer) to dry your shoes and maybe your tent.  You were very brave to bike using flipflops.  <br /><br />If you are looking for an extreme cycling adventure consider crossing Canada West to East.  <br /><br />My thoughts for anyone thinking of cycle touring or bikepacking look for packing checklists they may make your adventure more fun and satisifying!",Misha LeBlanc,2020-12-01T00:04:28Z,0

Longest dat 117 miles marion arkansas to searcy arkansas with tail wind.  Shortest day was 35 miles toward helena montana with head wind.

"People (including me ;-) ) have been traveling with paper maps only for centuries - you probably just too young to remember those times, haha...! But I admit: I love GPS technology and the internet makes things so much easier. With paper maps you either get large area coverage (if you need to safe weight and cary only a few maps) but sacrifice details. Or you take the detailed maps and carry a kilogram of paper. So yes, I admit, modern technology has made things much easier. For trip planning at home I still prefer a combination of paper and GPS, because on the screen you always loose the details when you need large area coverage. Not so on paper maps.  In any case: looks like you had a great and challenging trip! Poland? I have never been there! But maybe next hear, if Covid-19 permits!

I&#39;ve spent so much time hiking and biking and over time have come to appreciate slower movement and more observation of what I am travelling through.  What I am attracted to in your videos is your interactions and appreciation of the people you meet and the realization that people throughout the world really want much the same thing.

"I think that by tackling too many miles, you ruined cycling for yourself.  Get back on the bike.  You&#39;ll be glad you did.  And while you&#39;re at it, raise your seat.  The muscles that do the most work when you cycle are strongest when they are at their extension.  With your seat too low, you&#39;re not getting the most out of your legs.  It&#39;s too tiring.  And it&#39;ll take a toll on your lower back as well.  But bicycling is the best way to travel.  It allows for better interaction with the locals.  The colors are brighter and the smells are more potent.  And the food tastes better.  Especially when you feel you&#39;ve &quot;earned it.&quot;",Rick Putnam,2020-11-26T09:17:09Z,0

"Nice story - many can relate too this, but when you prepare you planned with the maps - but didnt do any training and testing on the bicycle; if you did you could tune in bike, gear and body  and the trip would be so much easier; lower gears on the bike,  lighter maybe, and a little better shape, and also think maybe you didnt get the optimal nutrition on the trip. Its all in the details. But the harder it felt - the victory was even bigger. Regard from Norway.",kvalvagnes,2020-11-02T08:10:58Z,0

from Upper Lusatia to the Forest Carpathians (already driven) - a super beautiful route - great to see that it doesn&#39;t always have to be Mongolia)))<br />In Poland there are unfortunately not many local hiking / cycling maps - as an added value from the video you take with you: this route also needs a bike with mountain bike translation / a bit of bike fitness (in advance) ... but why modern technology on the one hand (Drones ...) but no short google map were allowed on the other one - makes me smile.

"I’m excited to watch this!  Looks like a grand adventure.  And I’m not trying to ‘one up you’ at all, but during the pandemic I also set out on a grand adventure myself.  Hiking 2,000 on the Pacific Crest Trail.  6 months, this whole pandemic I was hiking in nature.  But you used a paper map which I admire I used my phones GPS and a great app called Guthook.  So my navigation was so easy 🤪 as long as my phone was charged (which it was not many times I ran out of battery and my back up battery).",Eric Highsmith,2020-10-21T22:31:52Z,0

"Reminds me of my biking holidays in Europe. I did some pre-made routes which were easier than when I picked my own routes. Especially because on my own routes with paper maps it was hard to assess the steepness of climbs, so the &#39;dragging your bike along while walking uphill and instantly regretting you got of the bike&#39;  is a familiar thing :) . 10 days is very ambitious though :) Well done!",Vincent de Boer,2020-10-21T14:17:57Z,0

"When seeing you becoming frustrated on your journey. Something that I use, especially as a cognitive neuroscientist, is to redirect your brain. When you feel too frustrated and down, try not to focus on your destination, but rather take a moment to look where you are. Question what makes this location, region, different or special. Sometimes write these down in your notes. Take deep breaths and enjoy that moment. Also think of what you have done and keep yourself grounded in the moment by looking at things to keep positive, such as scenery, natural beauty, etc. Essentially whatever works. Congratulations you should be proud of yourself. Its a great feeling. Keep trekking girl ;)",Pro Consumer Safety,2020-10-05T02:40:42Z,13

"Hitler made it across Poland quite nicely with &quot;Just&quot; paper maps. Google maps is de-humanizing. And you need a much better map with proper graphics, that type of European map is just garbage. And find one with topo lines also.

"Wowww. This vlog was amazing and there are a lot of reasons why I actually loved your vlog. First and foremost, all the scenic views in your video were just amazing,  and one thing I learnt from your journey is that in the beginning normally we’re highly motivated, but the real challenge facing us during the journey is that how we carry the same level of motivation till the end. The part where you cried made me realise that it’s ok to feel down a little following a setback but what really matters is that how you buck up and continue putting in efforts towards your final destination. <br />Your message in the end was full of wisdom.",Nimra Jamil,2020-09-21T19:48:38Z,10

"The use of paper maps is so forgotten into today&#39;s world. This is good educational event too. Glad that you did this for yourself and others too. Good Job! Also, did you try to change the gears on the bike; when going up hill, a lot of people forget that-- I believe the higher the gear easier the climb--smaller gears. When the chain fell off, it might have been, when you didn&#39;t change the gear all the way, that is common--remember to change the gear completely, next time ;).

"What a story .... Greatest gift a grandfather can give to her grandchildren are stories and experiences. Your grandfather gave you a story of a lifetime. 👍 👍 👍<br />** Chronicles of adventure: **<br />I have lost all my rush,<br />Kilometers no longer impress me<br />Whether there’s 100, 200, or 600 of them,<br /> I’m indifferent to that because I have to cross that distance anyway.<br />So I’m not scared of distances anymore.<br />And the same applies to time,<br />Whether I meant to be on the road for 3 hours or 17,<br />What’s the difference?<br />Either way, I have to reach my destination.<br /><br />I don’t get stressed out by the slow,<br />Sometimes tortoise-like speeds.<br />I simply get into my vehicle,<br />And I ride as far and for as long in absolute peace<br />Until I reach the destination that I set for myself.<br /><br />I also don’t let the discomforts bother me,<br />Such as tough seat, the heat, the dust, or the lack of water,<br />All of this in its own way is beautiful and wonderful.<br /><br />Whoever cannot adapt to this kind of life,<br />Or in fact, whoever cannot come to love this kind of life,<br />Cannot be a true traveler.<br /><br />** To be a true traveler requires character. **",Chandu Ivaturi,2020-09-18T19:41:24Z,0

"The quote- <br /><br />I&#39;ve noticed one thing changed in me, I&#39;ve lost all my rushes. Kilometres no longer impress me, whether they are 200, 400 or 600. I am indifferent to that, because I have to cross that distance anyway. So I&#39;m not scared of distances any more. <br /><br />And the same applies to time. Whether I&#39;m in the road for three hours or seventeen, what&#39;s the difference? Either way, I have to reach my destination. I don&#39;t get stressed out by the slow, sometimes tortoise-like speeds. <br /><br />I simply get into my vehicle and I ride as far and for as long in absolute peace until I reach the destination that I&#39;ve set for myself. I also don&#39;t let the discomforts such as tough sit, the hit, the dust or the lack of water bother me. <br /><br />All of this in its own way is beautiful and wonderful. Whoever cannot adapt to this kind of life or in fact, whoever cannot come to love this kind of life, cannot be a true traveller. To be a true traveller requires character.",Yusuf 5316,2020-09-17T21:10:16Z,0

"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O36yN_4bMU&amp;t=20m30s"">20:30</a> you completely won me. I am totally with you. Great accomplishment :)<br />Can&#39;t stop thinking about how it could have finished if you could have given yourself 14 days instead of 10. If you can give yourself a day off after you are so exhausted. &#39;tis kinda pity that you got so fed up with the ride by the end, &#39;cause it somewhat ruis the experience. In my past I had some cases when I overtargeted myself just a little bit, like 20% and it made it a very bad thing, couldn&#39;t get my mind off keeping the pace and getting there and fighting fatigue instead of enjoying being out there. When you said in the beginnin 750km in 10 days I thought to myself &quot;backpacking 80km a day through the mountains? Yeah doable but you won&#39;t really enjoy that&quot;. <br />My rule of thumb for tours (that are primarily not for sport) is: i assess what is possible and take 75% of that. Then I can mostly enjoy that.",Kobor Kutya,2020-09-16T06:01:54Z,0

"I always seem to been with Polish people, I grew up in a city in the Midlands which has had a large Polish population for generations and now there are at least a million Polish people in the UK. Yet I have never known a Polish person very well and know very little about the country. Your vlog shows what a beautiful and still largely rural country it is, ideal for cyclists.<br />At the low point of your trip you tried to cycle in flip flops because you had left your trainers outside all night and they were soaked. I would honestly not have done that because flip flops are just ... floppy ... and waste your energy flopping about when you want a good connection with the pedals on your bike. I would have worn the trainers and put dry socks on. Wash the wet socks and hang them on the back of your bike to dry in the breeze. By lunchtime your trainers would have dried out with your body heat and if it is a nice day the socks you washed would have dried out also.<br />Have you read a book by Tim Moore called French Revolutions? It is about someone without a great deal of cycling experience who decided to cycle an entire course of the Tour.<br />Despite what you said at the end of your vlog I am convinced you will cycle again, but on a better bike. In car terms £200 in the UK gets you a Dacia, £600 a Ford or a Skoda and £1000 a BMW. All very affordable for most people in work.",Tony Maries,2020-09-15T19:51:46Z,0

"You&#39;re probably young enough to be my granddaughter, but I watched this because you did it without Google Maps. (And also because I want to do some touring in Poland, though would stay further north than you did.) Twenty-five years ago I used to talk to a lot more people along the way to ask about roads, local history, etc. Now I don&#39;t talk to people so much, because I have Google Maps, a route programmed into my bicycle computer, and do a lot of history research ahead of time. So I have fewer questions to ask. I miss those older ways and think it&#39;s great that you did it the way you did. You may inspire me to try something like that again. I&#39;d have trouble doing it in Poland, though. I recognized a few words from your conversations, but wouldn&#39;t be able to follow difficult directions. <br /><br />As for your wet shoes, those can be a real problem as wet socks can chafe your feet, and then you&#39;ll really have problems. One technique I and others have used is to put on dry socks, then plastic bread bags over the socks, and then the shoes.  It still is troublesome because your feet will sweat inside the bread bags if you do it for a long period, but it can help if you don&#39;t push too hard. <br /><br />That is quite an accomplishment to ride 60 miles a day in hilly country, without training, with a camping rig a bit heavier than mine, and regular street shoes without clips. Your grandfather definitely would have reason to be proud of you. I hope it isn&#39;t the end of your bicycle touring, no matter what you said at the end of your ride.",John Gorentz,2020-09-14T22:28:03Z,116

"We definetively want to see Eva doign more bicycle touring ! <br /><br />It is when you feel your legs can&#39;t push the pedals anymore that you learn that our true motors are the brain and the heart ,these are the real sources of energy and motivation to keep you moving, this process of pain and feeling miserable makes us affront our own mentallities and improve emotionally, you have two choices, you stop and surrender in the middle of nowhere only to later to feel bad because you failed, or you manage to rest a little, change your mood and continue with a big smile over the adversity. <br />Resolving these self conflicts really makes us better, more passionate and dedicated persons, able to affront the tallest mountains without hesitation and have the hability to complete our objectives <br /><br />Greetings from Colombia &lt;3, we have some of the best cyclists on the world because most of them are very humble and yet so brave and passionate, they never give up, even if they lose or fall, they take adversity as a master and learn from their own mistakes only to continue improving.",KingKeeper99,2020-09-25T19:58:48Z,12

"It&#39;s very inspiring to see someone of the current generation value the ideals of the older generations like you do, with your love and interest in what your grandfather did and how he did it.  The passage of his that you read was truly amazing.  It was amusing to see how you struggled and learned to deal with the hardship of using &quot;only a paper map&quot; as opposed the &quot;normal&quot; convenience of Google Maps.  That normal convenience is what you grew up with but of course paper maps, sign posts and directions from strangers were the only way that people found their way for all of the generations before this one.  I applaud your bravery, stamina and determination to take on a challenge like this with so many unknowns and with so little experience, but only your heart to guide you.  Wishing you safety and love as I look forward to your next vlog.",Lukionest,2020-09-14T17:45:12Z,0

"Wonderful video Eva. Takes me back to 1981- I was 17 - my first overseas adventure. Train from Penzance, cycle across London, train and ferry to Esbjerg, then cycle to Flensburg (to see a girl - of course). And back. GPS was 12 years in the future - but I used hostels not a tent, so less kit. Planning on paper maps and route cards... <br /><br />As was said - you are a brave and strong young woman - and I completely understand how much easier travelling alone is, and why you&#39;d want to do it. Somehow I lost the wanderlust  - never cycle toured again - settled down and stopped travelling. Don&#39;t think you ever will - and if travel makes you happy, then we&#39;re all delighted to watch the results<br /><br />Your grandfather would be proud of you (and how you share your journeys in the modern world).  You have the qualities he required - you are a true traveller.",lardo666,2020-09-13T23:48:52Z,0

"This reminds me of my first bike tour in 2010 where I rode across Switzerland, France, and Spain. I didn&#39;t have a smartphone back then so I also used paper maps that I had to acquire along the way. Because I didn&#39;t have social media and Internet to entertain myself, I spent my evenings studying a Spanish dictionary and tried out the new words the next day. <br />100km per day is actually quite ambitious with a loaded bike. Especially if it&#39;s your first trip and you have to take time to navigate too (and film everything!). Congrats on that!<br />Regarding <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O36yN_4bMU&amp;t=20m00s"">20:00</a> , there will be days when you&#39;re down and days that are some of the best days in your life. It&#39;s just how it works. Usually, when a situation sucks, it&#39;ll get better eventually. It&#39;s a good thing to keep that in mind. And now you can apply all the things you&#39;ve learned on this tour on the next one :D",Max Kueng,2020-09-12T15:51:53Z,46

"I haven&#39;t done this type of long tour many times, but I avoid getting depressed and worried by remembering that I have a tent. If it gets too hard you can just find a secluded spot where nobody will see your tent, put it up, and recover. Figuring out how to find a safe, unseen place to camp (and certain to have no people in the area)  if it is not in a camping ground is important for your own mental and physical state. I know it&#39;s a bigger concern for females, but it can still safely be done if done carefully. Well done on this. It&#39;s really impressive, and we can all see that you have grown much on this trip.",Zod of Heaven,2020-09-11T20:14:48Z,0

"I was struck by Eva&#39;s Grandpa&#39;s words so I wrote them out. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.<br />If she would tell me his name, I would love to quote him and attribute the words to him by name.<br /><br />“I’ve noticed one thing changing in me. I’ve lost all my rush.<br /><br />Kilometers no longer impress me. <br />Whether there is 100, 200, or 600 of them, I’m indifferent because I have to cross that distance anyway, So I’m not scared of distances anymore.<br />And the same applies to time. <br />Whether I’m meant to be on the road 3 hours or 17, What’s the difference? Either way I have to reach my destination.<br /><br />I don’t get stressed out by the slow, sometimes tortoise like speeds. I simply get into my vehicle and I ride as far and as long, in absolute peace until I’ve reached the destination that I have set for myself.<br /><br />I also don’t let the discomforts bother me, such as a tough seat, the heat, the dust, or the lack of water. <br /><br />All of this in its own way is beautiful and wonderful.<br />Whoever cannot adapt to this kind of life, or in fact, whoever cannot come to LOVE this kind of life, cannot be a true traveler. <br /><br />To be a true traveler requires character.”<br /><br />~Eva&#39;s Grandpa.",John Love,2020-09-11T19:58:00Z,9

"That was *amazing*.<br />I wonder how you&#39;d feel about doing the same in Norway or Switzerland or something though.<br />Mind you, with lower daily targets.<br />100 km might be reasonable in Poland.<br />But Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, that kind of places have rough terrain, so if you ever decide to go to those places do yourself a favor and give yourself a little more leeway in terms of time, both so you don&#39;t have to push yourself so hard, but also so you get more time to just experience the view and possibly even take a detour to see things if you get some spare time. =)<br />Here in Norway we got freedom to roam as one of our laws, so you&#39;re free to tent or bike pretty much anywhere as long as you follow the relevant laws (basically common sense for the most part although you&#39;ll want to read up on the details to be sure in case there&#39;s cultural differences about what is or isn&#39;t &quot;common sense&quot;)",Luredreier,2020-09-11T18:25:24Z,1
"Great task of her doing that trip. This is south Poland, party quite rolling landscape, not as many flat stretches as longer to the north. There are plenty of routes in norway and Switzerland with just gentle ups and downs where one can go 100-130 kms a day without bigger issues, for many days. It all depends of the routes one choose I guees. Naturally if choseing going over mountain passes it&#39;s something else.",Rimrock300,2020-09-13T11:10:00Z,0

"Oh, Oh. One of the drone views of you cycling: RED FLAG. Respect for the 90..110km per day, by the way. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O36yN_4bMU&amp;t=8m02s"">8:02</a> It&#39;s the SADDLE height that is TOO LOW. The best height is where you pedal with your toes, stretch your leg completely and need to stretch your foot a bit at the deepest point. The moment you need to wiggle your hips to maintain contact with the pedals, you are too high. It&#39;s simple mechanics (that physics thing) where forces at the wrong angle can be decomposed in two perpendicular angle parts. When you sit too low, you loose a lot of force in the angles in your joints. And you stress the connecting tissue around the joints more, as well as the tendons between muscles and bones. A way to measure saddle height is inside leg and add 10% for shoe and toe stretching - as a start: back against a wall for support, feet flat on the ground, not too far apart, clamp book with the back of the cover between your legs with the back of the book horizontal. Measure from floor to back of book and add 10%. Transfer that to saddle at deepest point to top of saddle.<br /><br />A trooper for effort and persistence!<br /><br />Next time planning these trips, I suggest to analyze &quot;height meters&quot;, not just distance. That height information is missing in most &quot;old fashioned maps&quot; except when you go back to the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O36yN_4bMU&amp;t=1m20s"">1:20</a>,000 or so that every country had - you would need a lot of maps if you wanted to bring them with you, though. Those maps have &quot;height&quot; lines and how close they are indicate the steepness. Really, as a cyclist you need to take the trouble to do that climb-descend analysis in planning. For this kind of trip, in say 1975, I would have tried to get hold of the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3O36yN_4bMU&amp;t=1m20s"">1:20</a>,000 maps and they would have shown the streets in the villages and towns too.",JP dJ,2020-09-11T12:33:34Z,0

"That&#39;s great. It reminds me of my first cycling trips, one of which actually involved going through Poland, although back then I could not yet speak any Polish so that made understanding the directions even harder!<br />But I don&#39;t think you should abandon the idea of any future bike tours. The problem with this trip was that you chose a to go for an intense trip with no training. You can go on a long journey with no training by starting short distances at first and then building up as you go along. But if you plan on doing an intense 10-day trip where you need to cover over 100km a day, you need a little bit of training to be able to enjoy it more.",Saviour S. Agius,2020-09-10T18:17:49Z,0

"Ucieszyłem się na wiesć, że w końcu zobacze na tym.kanale Polskę. Szybko mi ta radość przeszła gdy zobaczyłem jak Polska została tutaj przedstawiona. Gdzie Pani jeździła tym rowerem, że znalazła pani zabudowania rodem z głębokiej Ukrainy, z rozpadajacymi sie płotami i dachami? Przecież to wyglądało jak opuszczona wioska, których w Polsce jest trochę, nawet drzewo wyrastało z jednego domu a Pani pokazała to tak jakby Polacy tak mieszkali. Przykre jest to że Polka z takimi zasiegami na yt wysyła taki obraz Polski w świat. Polski zacofanej i biednej. Boli tym bardziej, że Polska naprawdę tak nie wygląda a żeby znaleźć takie rozpadające się budynki na polskiej zamieszkanej wsi trzeba bardzo się natrudzic. Pokazała Pani karteczkę z listą wsi i miasteczek które musi pani minąć by dojechać do granicy. Oczywiście nie pokazała pani tych wsi na filmie. Tak się składa że mieszkam w jednej z tych &quot;karteczkowych&quot; wsi i w całej okolicy nie ma choćby jednej takiej rudery, wszędzie są albo nowe domy albo wyremontowane stare. Dlaczego pani przedstawiła Polskę w tak stereotypowy sposób? To momentami naprawdę wyglądało jakby to były specjalnie wyszukane miejsca by Polskę tak ośmieszyć albo zrobić sensację. Przykre, że zagraniczni jutuberzy pokazują Polskę lepiej niż ci polscy. :(",FoxyKing93 ®,2020-09-10T09:04:27Z,2

Like you, I remember lots and lots of forests. It was an amazing journey and experience. The old town of Rzeszow was something I will always especially remember. I&#39;d like to return and go to Halicz and Bolszowce in the Ukraine to see where my family came from. <br />Am looking forward to viewing your other video diaries.",v jary,2020-09-09T22:40:17Z,0
"I had the weirdest thing happened to me in Bergen after a long bikepacking weekend in August. I met a veteran while I was sitting on a park bench. After talking for a couple of hours, he ended up giving me a WW1 medal. When you bike, you meet so many random and memorable people. That&#39;s why I love it.<br /><br />During the summer, I invite people to bike in Norway. The best route in my opinion has to be to take the train from Oslo to Geilo, which is at the top of the central mountain plateau. From here go west, and then it&#39;s all down hill via the fjords to Bergen. Mostly downhill, few cars, but moderate fitness is a must when you cross Finse. Every inch of that road is super picturesque. <br /><br />Temperatures vary between 0 degree C at night, incl. some snow patches, to 25 C. in the low lands. I recommend a 3 season bag and clothes to regulate your temperature. Be creative, like 2 trash bags and some duck tape can turn into an emergency bicy sack to raise your temperature by 5 C degrees. <br /><br />People say it&#39;s expensive here. That&#39;s true, IF you stay at hotels. When I was bikepacking, there&#39;s the Allemannsretten, which means you can camp anywhere that&#39;s 150 m. from houses. It all cost me 10$ for food at the grocery store during those three days. Train ride back to Oslo (incl. bike) cost me 50$ during the night. Sun all the way, no tire punctures and super friendly people all the way. By far my best trip.<br /><br />Pics: <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/l6pqone"">http://imgur.com/gallery/l6pqone</a>",Wille k,2020-09-09T22:29:24Z,0

"lol &quot;paper maps&quot; ...made me laugh! FYI, if you&#39;re serious about doing this kind of travel you should ALWAYS use printed maps, its not unique to do so, its absolutely and by far, your primary source of navigation &#39;out there&#39;. Get to know how to read them properly as they are your best for accuracy. A GPS is always for ease-of-use in built up towns etc and unreliable in the wilder out of reach places.

"Kinda cool you read that quote from your grandfather a day before your hardest moment. And it was also honorable for you to show yourself crying and upset about the frustrations, showing all of the trip. Such a parallel to life. We start questioning or thinking down about ourselves but God is there the whole time. And yes, gratitude for different things helps too. Great adventure, awesome of you to do it!",Kristen's Korner,2020-09-09T05:14:47Z,0

"First off: This does demand respect. Chapeau! Your Grandfather sure must have been an inspiring man. I feel that his description of a true traveler is lot like having the character to be truly alive. <br />It looks like you&#39;ve stumbled on a great life lesson. Sometimes you need to allow for tears, pain, feeling broken down, close to the point of giving up, to reach that inner strength that will lead you to your goal. Such experiences will stay with you. <br />Thank you  for allowing us to follow you on your journey.",Itom G,2020-09-09T01:36:43Z,0

No villages, no empty houses, literally just desert, maybe with an odd tree.  I love that about anywhere in Europe, there is always something - a village or a farm  - something not that far away.

"You are great traveler. When I saw you in conflict countries in middle east, I impressed about what you did. Great. <br /><br />2 years ago, I took road from Bratislava, Vienna, Bruno, Praha, Dresden, and Berlin for 10 days. <br /><br />It was without preparation, and I just decidedbuying bike when I arrived in Bratislava, in which my host from Couchsurfing helped me finding it.  <br /><br />I bought my supply in Bratislava with budget less than 400 euro. I bought bike 200 euro in Bratislava. And I Sold it 200 euro as well in Berlin. I did not bring my own bike because I am from Indonesia, in which, most likely cost of shipping would be more expensive, and also I have  never planed this before. <br /><br />And when I saw you pick apples from the street, that reminds me what I did. The taste is not good but enough to fill a starving hahaha. <br /><br />And people are nice in anywhere, when I asked a water in austria and chezia, they gave me foods. <br /><br />To be honest I felt what you felt on the road, I was really hard, sometimes, but fun<br /><br />And now my supplies, bags, tent, and other stuffs I left them in Ann Arbor Michigan.<br /><br />Early this year, I was in Szczecin, PL. It s nice city. <br /><br />Keep safe, ewuni.",agus benzaenuri,2020-09-08T21:14:48Z,0

"Good effort for your first long haul bike trip, a lot of mistakes but to be honest one has seen  a lot more from others who actually ride a lot more , dont be put off planning your next one, but if you can,  try and get hold of something like a Riese &amp; Muller supercharger e bike , designed for long distance touring  with Rohloff gear box with carbon drive belt  and electric e -14 gear changer , it will do well over 100 + miles a day on duel batteries , try one, see how you go, you will never look back, maybe one of your followers will sort you one out ?      <a href=""https://youtu.be/YZ4HDD2sLy4"">https://youtu.be/YZ4HDD2sLy4</a>",mountain dweller,2020-09-08T14:42:28Z,0

"GREAT GREAT FILMMAKING!  I had been following the journey on IG and really pleased to see how you stitched the experience all together here.   I give you praise first for the inspiration, as it&#39;s so important to inspire joy through travel, ESPECIALLY in times when people find it hard to create new experiences or even just live their life at all.    <br /><br />Secondly,  I offer you praise for your creative expression and storytelling.  From planning, to purpose,  the visual storytelling was excellent, with a clear and relatable overlaying narrative.  I have seen many other travel documentaries now that were incoherent with lazy gaps in the itinerary or missing narration that leaves you confused (I AM LOOKING AT YOU &quot;PEDAL THE WORLD&quot; by FELIX STARCK, how did Netflix purchase that?!).   <br /><br />What I liked about yours is that I was along on the journey, understood precisely your route, your emotional perseverance, and feelings of accomplishment.  It&#39;s really impressed and motivated me to keep up the adventures in difficult times.  Thank you also for inspiring me to tackle similar adventures here in Ireland and fanning the flames of the wanderlust for fellow travelers.

"I can&#39;t keep quiet, I had my first outbreak of Herpes virus nearly 4 years ago. Of all the horridness, the pain and itching were unbearable. I literally freaked out as my general physician said that it had no cure. The outbreaks were not that frequent initially, but every time I fell sick, it would resurface. I had so many sores this year that I was desperate to try anything to get rid of them. Eight months ago a friend suggested that I try Dr Oz herbal remedy that&#39;s helping people get cured from HIV, HSV, COUGHING, GENITAL HERPES,Genital warts, HPV,ALS/MND, SNEEZING, HEPATITIS B, CANCER e.t.c. He has on countless occasions after curing patients presented lab results both positive and negative,I quickly ordered the product and started using the remedies. I&#39;m so relieved to say that I&#39;ve not had even one outbreak for 6 month now. Moreover, I&#39;m feeling great from within. I truly endorse this herbs product Dr Oz renders to me. So if you are suffering from any deadly disease you can also contact this great man on his email: doctoroz2020@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a> or message him on Whatsapp:+2349037520482  God bless you]",Owen Harry,2020-09-08T14:11:45Z,0

Watching from Philippines 😘 been following your vlog since last year. Such an inspiration-i might buy bike too 😄,Its DanielTV,2020-09-08T13:28:58Z,0
Any one considering to cross a country by bike there are lessons to be learned:  Have the right gear. Not expensive gear! Just prepare the right gear.   Have a quality bike that works perfectly.  Have repair sets and spare bike tubes and learn how to change them.  Have a good saddle.  Did I mention a GOOD saddle?  Have your bike set up for your body measurements. It is so much more easy to bike when you are riding a good set up bike!  Use navigation tools! How romantic Eva&#39;s motivation might be .. your experience will be much better if you know you go the right way.  Do SOME exercise.. try out your bike so you can still adapt your set up before sailing off.  Wear bike pants and not a suit to facilitate peeing experience ;-)  And last and not least: Go to the Netherlands (beginners experience) or Belgium (Next level). The Netherlands has absolutely a fantastic biking infrastructure and beautiful landscapes and villages.  Not too much elevation in general but if you like a bit of climbing ... I can recommend some pretty challenging areas in the middle of nature.  If you go to Belgium: Infrastructure not always as perfect as in The Netherlands and more challenging elevations but no mountains :-) But still a marvelous country to cross and have an excellent adventure. Both countries have a touristic bike routes network clearly marked by numbers so it is very easy to navigate and be guided to the best paths (separated from car- and truck traffic!!! ) and sights all over both countries!,Hans Vuijst,2020-09-08T13:23:26Z,28

I really appreciated how you filmed your down day as well as your up days, showing your roller coaster of emotions.   I was cheering you on the whole way!  <br />Last spring I trekked to Everest Base Camp.  The last day was extremely hard for me.  But I think the fact my (and your) journey was hard, not easy, makes it a far more rewarding adventure, than if it had been easy.  The difficulty is what makes these things lifetime memories.",Graham McMillan,2020-09-08T12:43:00Z,0

I mean, I guess you try to travel as minimalist as you can, and you are camping outside, without electricity around -or it is what I can see-. Are you using external batteries?

"Awesome film as always Eva! I’ve just started a YouTube travel channel myself, with plans to take a career break and film my travels for a year or two... then COVID happened, delaying our plans. We’re now rearranging and hoping to set off in January, but not sure what the global landscape will look like then.<br /><br />What do you / people think? Where would be best to travel in January? Is it ethical to do so at this current time?

It looks like your bike probably weighed more than you, given the bike&#39;s weight along with all of the things that you needed to bring along (tent, water, food, etc.).

This is the type of travel content I love most of all--raw, gritty and showing the not-so glamorous side that inevitably comes with a trip like this. Of course you also give us amazing footage to showcase the beauty of this country, but you also remind us that you are very much human and that journey&#39;s like this are never emotionally straightforward. This is what true inspiration looks like. Not flowery, fluffy positivity but realistic struggle and perseverance. And it makes the journey all the more beautiful and worthwhile.

"Ok after a short perusal of 30-40 comments &amp; not seeing anyone else type what l&#39;m about to ,here it is , uno right ? That when you arrive in a city or town you can go to the town council or tourist center &amp; get maps of the town you are in &amp; therefore asking for directions isn&#39;t necessary , also maps usually have the actual distances between towns written upon them , so you can do the math rather than use a caliper that is so inaccurate it&#39;s not funny . at least Australian maps have all that information and much more so they must be poor quality maps you were using . why do l always see the negatives &amp; the mistakes people make ? Probably because l care to save them from troubles they end up in . l can&#39;t believe you did this &amp; yet claim you don&#39;t know how to put a chain back on the cogs . are you sure you&#39;re not saying that to create dramatic effect .",John Spirit,2020-09-08T03:43:05Z,0

Everyone was whining about all of these but strangely I wasn&#39;t bothered at all. They told me I&#39;m a masochist for all the hard hikes and journey that I do, but hearing your grandfather&#39;s words made me realize maybe I&#39;m a true traveller?

"I’ve never heard the polish language being spoken before, it’s sounds very Italian",Dan & Nak,2020-09-07T22:45:21Z,10
"@Christopher Kessler yeah, speaking of the pronunciation it can be associated to Russian because both are slavic languages, but you can find many german words that are used in Poland; for example: &quot;Kabel&quot; (cable/electric wire) has the same meaning in german and polish! Or another example can be &quot;Kumpel&quot; for both languages the meaning is buddy/mate/friend. :)",HamsterTube,2020-09-10T18:19:41Z,0

My chain also popped when I was going up this massive hill in the WI dells during that ride and I also had to walk the bike up while other more experienced riders were zooming past me, lol. Its also funny how different people handle struggle, when I was pushing my bike up the hill I was cussing instead of crying; a group that looked like they were regularly part of a spin group with their instructor was coming up and as who I presumed to be the instructor was shouting &quot;come on, push it! come on, come on!&quot; I took it that she was shouting at me and I barked &quot;get off my *&amp;^%ing back!&quot; at her, lol.

"That&#39;s pretty awesome but me, I would never part with Google maps but as I&#39;ve worked in tech, I know tech can have massive failures. We need to know how to use a sextant, the sun, stars etc to find our way even if just in case we break our phones etc on a trip, let alone if something happens to our satellites and internet. And this was such an adventure. I felt bad for you though but looks worth it. I used to bike 20+ miles a day when I was busy with school and work and life. I actually became addicted and biked in a blizzard in Utah in shorts and a parka and showed up at my college where students yelled from their cars that in freaking crazy.. haha sometimes crazy is the only way to be happy. 🤷🏽‍♂️ Or healthy and sane.

"I spent a month cycling through Portugal, 22 years ago, I love riding the back roads, the sights, sounds and smells make it a very personal form of travel. It allows you to experience everything at an intimate level that cannot happen in a car or pubic transport.<br />Too bad this is your one and done for cycle touring.",WASH Guy,2020-09-07T19:30:04Z,0

"Hi Eva,<br />congratulations! You made it - and you´ll never forget it. Isn´t it funny? You might be never so far away from home again! It took you ten hard days to reach the goal. I made the same experience when I was young on a canoe. I worked hard for ten days like you with the same feelings (lonely, exhausted and bad weather) to travel about 200 km from home and into myself (wasn´t always funny what I found there). Since then I travelled the world. In 36 hours I´m in Australia and elsewhere. But I´m still convinced that I was never as far away as on that trip with the canoe!<br />Thanks for your lovely report that triggered me and have a good time!<br />Dettmar",Dettmar Dencker,2020-09-07T17:36:28Z,0

EVA: Going across country with paper map.<br />ME: Still drawing my Travel Plan on a paper.,LegoBanda,2020-09-07T17:20:57Z,0
Paper maps are perfectly good. Just make sure you have detailed ones of the areas you plan to travel through. A little bit of planning before the trip is well worth it. Make a list of all your waypoints set about 20Km apart (for a bike trip) and tick them off as you pass by. You will now how far you went and how far there is still to go. I do this when going for long multi-day hikes in the mountains although my waypoints are 500m apart because many sections are off track and I don&#39;t want to get lost. Detailed maps and waypoints! :),Dexxter,2020-09-07T17:55:41Z,0

You think your weak coz your exhausted, and forgot that the time you wanna give up is the time you took the distance any other man haven&#39;t taken yet. You inspire me more of having an adventure in my own country by bicycle, tho i can run a speed 20 to 30 kph average, even i can take a 100kph in 5hr or less your still tougher than me and other bikers.

"Eva you may have mentioned it before and I might of missed it: I had no idea that you became a world travel Guide/Writer because of your grandfather what a way to begin a great tradition! my family wasn&#39;t so exciting I grew up in an abusive crazy world but even though we had our good moments its nothing to keep as a tradition is why I never married and had a family of my own I only thought that a happy family was only something Hollywood movies only made up so you are a inspiration doing what you do and I know there are tough times like we all saw you going through it is also so  Beautiful to see you not giving up and keep going! I&#39;m 47 I know it&#39;s not to late for a family knowing that we may have some of our family in us we don&#39;t have to be like them! I&#39;m scared to think that if I don&#39;t at least try then I have failed not failed my family that are few now but failed myself I know I&#39;m a good honest hard working middle aged man and I at least deserve to try and to give myself happiness that I was deprived of growing up, thank you Eva! you are an inspiration to me  Eva!!. &quot;álainn agus misniúil&quot; Eva!.Billy Phelan.",Billy Phelan,2020-09-07T16:08:33Z,0

And then the challenge to fold them back up properly.  Here in the US gas stations used to give them to you for free (back when gas was 0.25 a gallon).  Be safe... on the rest of your travels.,Charleston Yank,2020-09-07T15:50:28Z,0

Eventually! I was waiting for this episode to be uploaded so impatiently :)<br />I am really glad that finally after such a long time there is a video in your channel which was filmed in Poland. <br />I hope that thanks to that many ppl would visit  our country as soon as it would be possible.<br />Pozdrowienia! 😀🇵🇱,Oceans Away,2020-09-07T15:14:42Z,22

Meldondg Lord do not judge a book by its cover<br />Go and visit Poland by your own and then make a statement not only after seeing the most remote places in Poland ever in a few minutes long last video. But you would not do that cause you are too close minded.<br /><br />Have a nice day EOM,Oceans Away,2020-09-09T19:06:29Z,0
