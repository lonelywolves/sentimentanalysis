"I think it’s highly irresponsible for people with platforms to be promoting travel right now. You are encouraging reckless behavior which can cost human lives.<br /><br />If you’re traveling to a place where there is a risk that you’ll introduce disease and where the local people do not have immunity, you are doing something unethical.  How do you really know if the virus is not on Socotra? How many were tested? Were you tested? You are young and could be asymptomatic. Its clear Yemen&#39;s healthcare system could not handle an outbreak. How painful would it be to look back on these photos/videos, unsure if you played a role in spreading a deadly disease to this precious community. There is a long history of western explorers doing this to indigenous people. <br /><br />Please ask yourself, did you stay out of safety, or ego? These photos and your giddiness seem like a romantic story to boost your likes and followers. Sight-seeing with local fisherman is not &quot;quarantine&quot;. Choosing to miss a flight is not &quot;getting stuck&quot;. Its playing with fire.<br /><br />While the rest of the world stays indoors, putting community above self, to protect one another, you do the opposite.  I urge you reevaluate your responsibility as an influencer, and your actions at this time.",momonala,2020-03-28T20:20:34Z,4

"Eva, I taught English in Poland 6 years. You are excellent in the language. But let me point out that desert island means uninhabited. Deserted would mean there had been someone there at some time in the past and the desert part does not refer to arid climate. It is metaphorical referring to people being absent. <br />&quot;des·ert is·land<br />/ˌdezərt ˈīlənd/<br />noun - a remote uninhabited tropical island.&quot; ... A desert island can even be quite lush with jungle. It is always devoid of people though. That is why in your first video we all thought there were no other people on the island. It is also why we were all quite surprised when there was a native islander showing you how to fish and even MORE surprised with all the people suddenly there. Thank you for clearly explaining the situation.",The Rooted Word,2020-03-28T12:54:59Z,2
"@saveyemen I read the article you link to. Thank you for the link. However, it is ignorantly written just to arouse anger over a thing every nation on the planet has suffered from. No us whining, since every nation has shut down its borders and no nation was prepared for this, not even the US. Those arguments made fall flat now, this far into the pandemic and seeing every nation&#39;s unpreparedness and rigid isolation strategies. It is actually better she stayed from a biological stance. She was already there. Whatever she had she had and she was already present before the closing of the airport. If she had left to another country she would have been risking exposing that other country as well, regardless whether they were developed or underdeveloped. This virus does not respect this stratification the writer argues from. None of that matters in this case. Most people are dying in one of the most developed nation and the one that should be most able to handle it: US. So quit bitching. It really is better that she stay put. That is why the nations shut down their borders. You and your writer friend are the ones in error. This is why we have all undergone quarantines. It makes us stay put in one place and then also to isolate ourselves there from everyone else. If you want to criticize her about a legitimate concern it&#39;s that she is interacting with other people during this time. That she is still on that island is the most correct thing for her to do.<br /><br />Regarding the argument of indigenous people, my father was a professor of Native American History at an Indian college in Montana. I also hold a degree in History. Although, we brought diseases that decimated populations, our advancement in medicine at the time was not adequately developed to have informed us of the risk. Not only that, the attitude of nations conquering other nations has always been rather cold as to the survival of the existing people, except in the case where they were going to merchandise them or tax them. In this case, Eva does not seem to have either purpose in mind. You are your friend are just seeking to bash someone for no reason.",The Rooted Word,2020-04-05T04:36:53Z,0

The advice you have been given is a load of rubbish. You can be a carrier and not know it in fact there could be more carriers and not show any signs. That does not mean there is no virus. It only takes 1 person to infect multiple. If there is a program of testing then fair enough. But I doubt it. Take this pandemic seriously !,Kamran Qureshi,2020-03-28T12:28:50Z,3
