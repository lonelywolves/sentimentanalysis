"In every travel video about Afghanistan, they find a girl from Bamian who says that girls outside of Bamian can&#39;t leave the house, can&#39;t go to school, or work, etc.  Completely incorrect.  I don&#39;t know if these girls are mistaken or what but Afghanistan has schools and universities in many cities, even Kandahar and Helmand, the stronghold of the Taliban, and women attend those universities and work in all cities of Afghanistan.  They even participate in national music idol show and are hosting TV shows, etc.",Yasmine A,2021-04-26T02:33:06Z,0

"Eva you are awesome. I am always amazed by your ability to go to the worlds most chaotic places and not talk politics. In fact it is where I draw a large portion of by political beliefs from. Seeing everyday life in places my country&#39;s news only highlights the negative and unfortunately with a great stain on my country is blinded by obsessions with corporations constantly using double speak and false narratives to drum up support for what is imperial adventurism at best in reality often genocide. IT  disgust me and it is only from your videos do I ever see real life in these places. <br />     Nazima&#39;s story made me cry , smile , laugh and scream all at once. She is truly amazing and   I so wish her story was known to every one here  in the US.  Her attitude and fearlessness is beyond inspiration, it is more than being a hero she is a pioneer forging lines for others to follow and with a smile. My first world problems seem so insignificant.

"As an Afghan, I would like to thank you for coming here. You are braver than all of us. Because you have risked your life to reflect the lives of our hopeless and hapless people.<br />Afghanistan is a country full of stars but hidden behind the clouds of war and terror. As an Afghan in my early 20&#39;s, I have seen nothing but war, guns, bullets, and heard nothing but bomb blasts, gunshots... And all of these have taught me one thing that I will never forget and it is that being here in Afghanistan is like being in a cage and seeing the outside world and saying how beautiful it must be to be free and live and travel without any fear. I think most of the Americans, Europeans, and others don&#39;t really know how fortunate they are to have such peaceful countries and can live, and love as they want. I can only imagine how amazing and beautiful it must be to live without the fears that I have been living all my life. It is a kind of philosophical truism that says: you only know the value of a thing when you don&#39;t have it. It is only in its absence that you can understand its true value.<br />Anyway, I hope, and I live for this hope that one day, the peace-thirsty Afghans would eventually get to the ocean of life and live the lives they all deserve.<br />Long-live humanity <br />Long live Afghanistan<br />Long live all peace-promoting countries and people<br />❤❤❤🇦🇫🇦🇫🇦🇫",Rafiq Free,2021-04-21T13:18:06Z,4

"Conservative? Thank you for being polite, and call backwardness and barbarism , conservative. Over 150 years ago in Europe in a time women predomintely still didn&#39;t have the right of political participation, a philosopher by the name Karl Marx wrote that in societies where men collectively will try to uplift women societal status and freedom will at the end uplift and free  their own status and also that  particular society as a whole. Take a deep look at a country like Afghanistan or Iran and their fucked up situation of existance and compare them with countries where women social status have been uplifted and relatively freed from social oppression and  judge on your own how true that statement has been.",Mehran H,2021-04-20T20:37:01Z,0

"Taliban do not represent Islam, they represent barbaric culture. We are all (majority) Muslim in Indonesia, who become Muslim since 7th century don&#39;t have such that view about women. Our women can freely go outside, to build their careers at work, at sports, etc.<br /><br />It&#39;s not just happening nowadays, in modern day, but also in the past. If you read Indonesian history you will find out that there&#39;s alot of our women who play important role in society, in politic and government.",Biggus Dickus,2021-04-20T13:55:03Z,1

"Allah SWT sends Prophet Adam(AS) to this world. As guidance always he send messengers for guidance to human race. <br />Allah SWT sends always only one message I.e Islam is since time immorial, since man stepped his foot on the earth.<br /><br />Islam - or guidance to humanity - is nothing for submitting our will to the WILL of Allah! <br />Allah SWT send more than 125,000 Prophets   (avatars) to different times, and different continents. <br /><br />The last of series of messengers ie avatars (Adam, Nouh before 100Kyears ago), are the lineage of Abraham (5000yrs) are Moses, Jesus,.....the Last one to be Mohammed,  peace be upon him and peace be to all messengers. Message is simple, Nobody worthy of being worshiped except Allah. <br /><br />Like all earlier prophets Moses, Jesus all has brought Islam, however humans (popes, pandits, Moulana&#39;s) who control the religions has twisted the message to their desires. <br /><br />Actually, this is the last of many 100s of civilizations, and focal point of this civilization is Middle East, and started by prophet Ibrahim (pbuh), almost 5000yrs ago. <br /><br />Earlier focal points of civilization probably on each times india, china, Japan, America, Mexico, etc. These civilizations started and ended. Whenever the message got too much courrpted, ALLAH started new message (new avatar).<br /><br />Today&#39;s father of civilisation is prophet Abrahim (peace be upon him). His lineage has 3 major prophets  prophet Moses, prophet ISA (peace be upon him), prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him). Current period, the only charter given by Allah is Quran, it is upon all humans.<br /><br />Ref: all religious Texts",Zubair Imaduddin,2021-04-19T10:28:53Z,0

Many do not know her.<br />1.The capital of inscriptions in Jubbah: which contains 12 thousand inscriptions, drawings and writings from the Thamudi era, the beginning of Islam, and the Iron, Copper, Silver and Stone eras.<br /><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/5saqqWMRtxCXuZdC6"">https://goo.gl/maps/5saqqWMRtxCXuZdC6</a><br />2. Magha’er Shuaib .. Midian This city is mentioned in the Bible and the Qur’an .. Arab researchers believe that it is the home of the people of the Prophet Shuaib .. and also the father-in-law of the Prophet Moses (Jethro).<br />There is a well called the Well of Moses, the eyes of Moses, the rock of Moses, etc. .. It is believed that the Prophet Moses migrated to after his escape from Pharaoh.<br /><a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/qxzjsc7XEvTThiXM6"">https://goo.gl/maps/qxzjsc7XEvTThiXM6</a><br />3.The charming and beautiful city of Al-Ula has the largest open museum in the world that passes through 4 civilizations that were ancient Arab oases ، The Thamud civilization, the Nabataean civilization, the Kingdom of Dadan and the Kingdom of Lahyan.<br /><br /><a href=""http://4.al/"">4.Al</a> Ukhdud City : The story of the owners of Okhdood is mentioned in the Qur’an of a Jewish king who tried to force the Christians to leave Tawhid and burned them at Okhdood. There are rock drawings and some antiquities in the city of Najran ..

These are hazara people in Afghanistan they’re a minority group that make up less then 2 percent of the population and are treated really bad and these are the people that you see a lot in this video...,FlyHigh_Mamba,2021-04-18T06:25:25Z,1
"@Sun Peek Thank you for the advice and that&#39;s what we Afghans want. But unfortunely it is not what the Hazara Afghans want because they do not even accept our  National Anthem let alone accepting Pashtoons. Tajiks etc as Afghans and living in peace. Check out our National Anthem. It clearly mentions each and every ethnicity as 1 Afghan. United. Peace and respect. May we all be guided to right path. <br /><br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/zPjt_J4h6EI"">https://youtu.be/zPjt_J4h6EI</a>",Watan Dost,2021-04-18T17:54:39Z,0
"@Watan Dost you pahtoon Tajik hazara should make friend and make each other feel belong in the country. If they are going to be mistreated of course people would want to leave. <br /><br />Someone else from bamiyan living in another country said that they are scared of going to Afghanistan because they are hated and in bamiyan there is no university or anything.<br /><br />Sad, but this is also part of humanity I guess.",Sun Peek,2021-04-18T17:44:28Z,0
"My exact thoughts. <br /><br />Also no hazaras are not hated just by pashtoons. They are also mistreated by us Tajiks too only because they are attention seekers as well as dying to get out of Afghanistan (which is a good thing- boz kam goish kam) but atleast stop spreading crap about the beautiful country Afghanistan and Afghan people just because you want attention. Sympathy and ĶHAREEJ. We don&#39;t need these kind of Afghans. <br /><br />I mean right now Afghanistan is so much peaceful Allahumdulilah compare to 10-15yrs back. <br /><br />My parents are both doctors mashAllah. I&#39;m a geologists and now a teacher in Afghanistan (yes I&#39;m a women) we have seen our country in pain but never had any issues in what we wanted to achieve. This Nazima girl has food to eat. Shelter, cloths to wear. Educated and has everything which some of the other Afghan girls do not have (some because of the situation in the past and some because of poverty)<br /><br />As a university teacher, most of my students are girls. <br />Also I use to teach in local schools in Kabul and most of my students in grade 9-10 were 25-30 years old women. They wanted to gain education now at that age.  Because they couldn&#39;t 15 years back. <br /><br />Afghanistan is a very peaceful country now Allahumdulilah compared to what it use to be. Even now these issues which occur is mostly due to government and not so called stupid Taliban. Us Afghans made the Talibans run away by being united. Now these Hazaras are trying to separate themselves from us Afghans. I don&#39;t have issues with that. Just don&#39;t bloody give bad name to Afghanistan.",Watan Dost,2021-04-18T11:36:02Z,0
@Kourosh587 ok you missed the point 2 percent or 15 percent why is every Video on Afghanistan always about hazara?! Nothing wrong with them but for gods sake it’s always about the hazara.,FlyHigh_Mamba,2021-04-18T10:24:49Z,0
"Nazima is not Hazara, if you know about Kamard district in Bamiyan, that’s entirely Tajik and she doesn’t look Asian so That is another clue that one can tell she’s not a Hazara, On the other hand her Asian or Mongolic looking tour guide, Gul, is a fellow Hazara, The Asian looking ski rental guy is also a fellow Hazara. You are being very stingy about the Hazara total percentage in the country,  they are around 15% or the third largest ethnic group. Pashtun being  40% and Tajiks around 30% . Hazaras are treated bad by Pashtuns. Pashtun  Taliban being a very conservative and tribal Muslim, backed by Saudi Arabian and Pakistan, Is against Shia Hazaras because they’re co-religionist as Iranians. Because the US also has problem with Iran, they’re punishing Hazaras for good  behavior and rewarding Pashtuns for bad behavior.  United States gave a Bigger  share of political power in Kabul to Pashtuns, While minimizing the presence of Hazaras in political structure. Thousands of nomad Pashtuns with their  animals encroach on the farming land of Hazaras and use it as grazing land for their animals every year.  This is a really big conflict, the government is siding with Pashtun nomads. Just google Commander Alipoor and Behsud.",Kourosh587,2021-04-18T08:31:14Z,1

Thinking about the past and what the Hazaras did to us other enthinicty background women, I feel it&#39;s all Karma for them now to be mistreated.

I was born and raised in Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.  My mom worked in the airport, my cousins went to college had jobs in offices.  My family other then the elderly next wore headscarf unless it was during prayer or religious ceremony. We had models, female doctors in my family and teacher. Afghanistan back before the war was a free and very modern country.  Our King was very modern and so was his wife.   I don&#39;t want ppl thinking that it was always been this way.  No this is the Taliban that came from Pakistan that has brought these ideas and mostly its out of fear of something happening to their daughters.",A Af,2021-04-18T01:50:41Z,0
"Very true. I&#39;m a Afghan, Tajik women. I&#39;m a teacher. Both my parents are doctors. 15 yrs ago we had a different Afghanistan. But right now Allahumdulilah we are all working hard, with freedom. No issues at all from those stupid talibans. Allahumdulilah",Watan Dost,2021-04-18T11:49:40Z,1
"I agree with the part that before the war or even during the communist era, when the countryside was getting bombed by the Soviets, Kabul was a progressive and  liberal city. I lived  there as a little kid, in mid 80s I started elementary school, school teachers were mostly females without any kind of head coverings and they wore jeans and skirts. Probably cities like Herat and Mazar, Kind of similar to Kabul, but in the countryside things were different, Specially in the conservative and tribal  south where Pashtuns live. They  were not much different than What Taliban  started to enforce throughout the country including Kabul. So the difference is in  mindsets, values and  narratives. Both Hazara guys,  the tour guide Gol and  The ski rental guy, Are progressive, open minded and want to live in peace. Tajik Nazima Sounds really intelligent and conscious of herself as a female and the  unfairness that exists towards her because of her gender. Now if someone goes to the south, they will see  a totally different way of life. Girls ldo not think like Nazima  or guys are not like Gol. girls are locked up in their homes, Guys are Opium cultivators or Taliban.",Kourosh587,2021-04-18T09:45:30Z,0

You reminded me with a funny Jordanian cartoon (by a famous cartoonist: Mahjoob) that shows the same problem girls face when they want to be athletes in certain communities.<br />A girl asks her father the permission to be an athlete to run in long-distance competitions.<br />The father says: you reminded me with your cousin. She was ambitious like you and she was an athlete in running long-distance competitions. I swear to God that we chased her like 6 to 7 kilometer before we caught her and shot her dead.<br />That was a joke of course or in fact a cartoon published in a Jordanian newspaper long time ago.,al Dallika,2021-04-18T00:33:59Z,0

"Eva I was really enjoying your videos about Afghanistan, until I realised:<br />1) you only went to Hazara minority provinces. (I guess that&#39;s not your fault as the guide <b>Gul</b> is from the same ethnicity). No I&#39;m not against anyone. Its just a bit strange for me now when I come to think of all the videos you have shared.<br /><br />2) you have been showing the world one side of Afghanistan which the media shows 24/7 anyways so nothing new. Its same old stuff where some people tell their struggle to the media just to get out of the country. <br />I was waiting for some videos which would contain good talks about Afghanistan and Afghan people. Whereas in all your videos same stuff has been mentioned (war, stupid Taliban etc) <br /><br />Most of us want to see the other beautiful side of Afghanistan too such as Noristan, Laghman, Jalalabad, Panjsher etc. It feels like your guide is only showing or taking you to his own corner which I feel is very unfair. The other side of the Afghanistan is still unknown to most of the people watching. <br /><br />Anyways rant over. <br />You look beautiful as always and Hope Nazima sisters struggles are over soon and she achieves her dream",Watan Dost,2021-04-17T20:00:28Z,2

"THE GREAT WAR (MALHAMA TUL QUBRA / ARMAGEDDON) IS COMING<br /><br />Latest: Russian Invasion of Ukraine is a leading progress to the Great War, They know the true Caliphate (not ISIS) is coming back, they know Mahdi is coming, they know Isa Ibn Maryam (Jesus Peace be upon them) is coming.<br /><br />So they are building empires around Hejaz and Damascus. The Russian Empire under Russia and the Roman Empire under European Union. THEY BOTH WANT TO EXPAND THEIR LANDS, BECAUSE BOTH GROUPS WANT TO FIGHT EACH OTHER TO CLAIM LEGITIMATE SUPERIORTY OF THE CHRISTIAN EMPIRE!<br /><br />Russia have gathered their friends from Muslim (Iran) and non-Muslim (China, North Korea) world, Rome (West USA /NATO) have gathered their friends (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Iraq, etc), they fought and gathered their territories, gigantic mammoths against the Mahdi and Messiah! But before that, the great war will happen, the giants will fight each other with their friends and allies.<br />We the Muslims have been informed about this 1400 years ago and the Sufi Saint and scholar Ibn Arabi who lived 800 years back in time wrote a detailed account of what is going to happen in the future:<br />The Russians must move over Turkey and that is going to be the reason for the Great War( at present we can see how tense the situation is between Russia and Turkey ). At the same time they will rush into Berlin and East Germany into West Germany. But quickly the situation will change, East Germany will go with West Germany. Not like the Russians want it to be. No! And Muhiddin Ibn Arabi is saying, that when the Russians are moving towards Turkey and Iran up to the South, then there will be a Great War for 3 months. Allah Almighty has appointed two nations to directly revenge against Russia. From the European side Germany. They are appointed by Allah Almighty to go against Russia. It will not be the same which happened in 1941. No! They will not be broken. And Japan will come from Asia. These two countries. The third nation will be Turkey from the South. No more Soviet Union...<br /><br />That is something which is signed by Muhiddin Ibn Arabi in his writings. It will be a huge and terrible fighting, but the Germans are full of revenge against Russia, just like Japan, both nations. When the Second War finished, the Russians harmed these two countries. If they had given their best to these nations, they would not want revenge. But Russia did its worst. Therefore they are full, and no-one else but Allah Almighty is filling their hearts with revenge towards Russia. Turks are also full with revenge against communist Russia. In Damascus there will be a huge power, a gigantic army which will come to the West of Aleppo where there is a big plain, Amuk, where there will be a great battle. The &#39;red-ones&#39; will be broken there, and Mehdi  hand will be with that army.<br /><br />Those are a few of the news of coming events. Holy-people take it from the books of Muhiddin Ibn Arabi.<br /><br />Here is more details:  “Armageddon: Muslims will fight the Russians” : <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj_2dNljhUc"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj_2dNljhUc</a><br /><br />“WW3 Prophecy -- Shaykh Nazim Haqqani”: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKEgp3-tJJI&amp;t=14s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKEgp3-tJJI&amp;t=14s</a>",Attar Misk,2021-04-21T22:19:13Z,0

"Once again Miss E, very well done. You are indeed changing your content path. As for Nazima, I&#39;ve never quite understood the  fight for gender &#39; evenness&#39;,if you will. Certainly from whence you derive your thoughts thus far,  western people will NOT grasp the realities of them: truly. <br />Succinctly then, you are quite something! I don&#39;t know you at all. I cannot understand, ( ok- wrong gender you&#39;ll say :), your plight fully. Yet this, this is SUCH a nice way to make one think. May you be the inspiration, both for your gender, and for your country. <br />After numerous documentaries watched, your country has so very much to offer. May we, who ( yes, a broad brush stroke!) believe a little too much of what is printed,uploaded, downloaded and watched, in derogatory form. May we then, sit quietly for a few minutes and try to figure how, how we can emulate your thoughtful approach to life&#39;s difficulties. <br />In so doing, turning the tide on the ever increasing withdrawal of humanity, into their swaddling cloth. Because eh, it&#39;s safer that way !!!! <br />In American accent please....&quot; You GO girl&quot; :) x",nat beech,2021-04-17T18:14:26Z,0

The whole rural Afghanistan and Muslims don&#39;t approve of this act as it is against Islam for a woman to strip herself of her dignity and loosen her clothes just for a mere sport infront of the world audience..<br />Instead Believing Women could do well by doing healthy exercises in isolated gyms for women only,Win Everything,2021-04-18T03:28:31Z,0

And we all know that Islam has defined for us what is right and what is wrong..<br />The same way you people say democratic republic of Korea (DPRK) headed by Kim Jong UN is not democratic we say also that Islamic Republic of Afghanistan is not Islamic.. Because it is clear that what this girl is doing is abhorrent according to Muslims and if the Prophet were alive he would absolutely deny and disapprove of this thing<br />Please respect our religion and our culture is that so big thing to ask?",Win Everything,2021-04-26T09:16:01Z,0

The US and allies should offer all Afghan women a path to citizenship and watch the Taliban and their government supporters freak the eff out.<br /><br />Btw we grew up skiing and most of our experience involved back country hiking. Really is the best conditioning with the big advantage of no waiting for lifts. Many underestimate the time spent waiting in lines at ski resorts.,Mash Code,2021-04-17T17:04:03Z,0

I wish all the best for her; I hope all her hopes and dreams come true. She deserves nothing less. 👏👏<br />Eva, thank you so much for sharing her important story.

"@Igraine Ohnefurcht Am not saying that Afghanistan is a perfect place to get educated, I am simply saying that women have access to education. The video is presented in a way to show that women cannot get an education which is not true. Every country has its problem and in the United States,  over 30% of the population or 40 million people are considered illiterate, similarly, in other parts of the world, there are people who do not have access to education. In spite of 40 years of continuous wars, Afghanistan men and women still have access to education. Please do not compare Afghanistan with your country or European country, because they are totally different cultures, societies, economies, and security. Cheers",Tim Harris,2021-04-21T22:30:35Z,1
"@Tim Harris Thats not the rule in Afghanistan. The number of kids not attending school ist about 3,7 million! and among this 60% girls Unicef says.

"Not everyone has the luxury to attend schools and this is international problem. According to the National Center of Education about 21% of American Adults fall into illiterate category and that is around 43 million people. In the United Kingdom 16% of people are uneducated. Amish allow female education until grade 8. The illiteracy rate in India is about 30% and in Nigeria is about 35%. France banned Muslim’s females to attend schools if they wear a hijab, Netherlands and Norway do not allow women to attend schools who wear full veil. Education is an international problem and this need to change so male and female could freely have access to school.",ahmad kaka,2021-04-18T03:59:20Z,3
"As an Afghan, I would like to say that some of the stuff Nazima had said is simply not true. I have 5 sisters and they are educated and have earned their degree from Kabul University. I have close females relatives, cousins, second cousins, family friends, etc. and they have all attended schools and earned their degrees from Kabul university or private colleges. During my primary, secondary, and post-secondary education I have had female students who were actively involved in sports such as basketball volleyball, and combat sports such as Taekwondo. In big cities such as Kabul, Herat, Mazarsharif, Jalalabad females actively attend schools and attend local fitness clubs. During my years living in Afghanistan, I have never heard of female friends and relatives that they were forced by their family members or friends to stop going to schools or receives death threat if they go against their family member wishes. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people who provide false information because that what people buy. I wish you have visited schools in cities like Kabul, Mazar Sharif, and other parts of the country where females freely attend schools. Cheers",Tim Harris,2021-04-17T23:55:58Z,1

"Eva is a little bit uneducated in her phrases. As i have seen before. She makes slogans like that in Europe and USA you have all these sko resorts and so on, and that a place like Afghanistan is the real deal. Greece for example, a European country has 80% mountains, with 20% of all of Europes Ultra peak mountains( more than Switzerland 8, or Austria12, or Afghanistan 17, Greece 19). <br />There you also have the real deal of going into the mountains completely in nature and fully untouched and incredible landscapes and mountians.<br />Look up on channels like &quot;Frozen Ambrosia&quot; or &quot;Greece a line of Snow&quot;.<br />Skiers from around the world who akoed around the world say that this is a unique and truly special feeling to be skiing like that. <br />So my answer to Eva. I know you try to put some places in a good daylight, but dont generalize and dont act as if there arent many other places that are truly special. Afghanistan has its places, and there are endless more acrows the globe",Ptolemy336VV,2021-04-17T16:15:42Z,1

Just a clarification that skiing is very very new in Afghanistan. Respect to this sister but it’s difficult for everyone to ski including boys but yes it is abit harder for girls to do it because Afghanistan unlike EU and USA don’t have health and safety or anyone there to help or ensure it is safe to ski. If this improves and become more safe then girls would easily be able to skiing.,unkownsiner,2021-04-17T15:43:58Z,0

@Win Everything such rules can be enforced. State can take such actions. My point was to stop violence in such things. Otherwise I am totally in favour of what Allah SWT and Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W) command us.,Surayya Obaid,2021-04-18T18:11:01Z,0
"@Surayya Obaid<br />For example forcing something doesn&#39;t mean beating someone.. You can ban international sports for women..<br />Muslim women shouldn&#39;t be allowed to run marathons infront of the world of course you know that.. Just ban it or if she insists she should represent a Infidel(non Muslim) Country..<br />You know that every society, every people, every nation is unique regarding its religion, its laws and its boundaries",Win Everything,2021-04-18T16:39:40Z,1
@Win Everything and if you are talking about what&#39;s right and what is wrong then my brother your act of watching a Na Mehram is wrong and out of Islamic boundaries too. Let the girl decide what&#39;s best for her. She will ultimately come to the path you have mentioned if you let her experience right and wrong by herself,Surayya Obaid,2021-04-18T16:30:19Z,2
@Win Everything well that&#39;s your point and I respect your perspective. But isn&#39;t it bad to force Islam against their will? What about LA IKRAHA FID DEEN. Tell them what&#39;s correct and leave it on them. Islam doesn&#39;t appreciate forcing religion on anyone. <br />Either beautify these teachings to the level they come running towards it or leave them on their will.

I do not think those who you are talking to represent the majority of Afghans.

"Girls through out Afghanistan should have the opportunity to follow their dreams. Sadly they won&#39;t once Biden finishes pulling U.S. troops out by 11 September. He&#39;s turning Afghanistan over to the Taliban.  I hope and pray that what happened to Iraq after Biden/Obama pulled us out in 2011 won&#39;t happen to Afghanistan. As a U.S. Marine Corps veteran that served in Iraq and Afghanistan I witnessed first hand how women and girls were being treated. It&#39;s beyond my comprehension how the world can sit by and allow this to happen. Thank you so much Eva for having the courage to go there and share this story.

"Muslims must remember!! The first wife of the prophet Mohammed; Khadija was a successful business women in her own right who controlled one of the most important caravan trade routes in the region. She was the first Muslim and believed in Mohammed before he believed in himself. Not only was she an extraordinary woman in her own right: strong, successful in business, a mother, spiritual - but she also defies and refutes so many of the stereotypes of women in Islam that people hold today.” The Mother of Islam, Khadija was the first wife of the Prophet Muhammad, and is a shinning example of a strong, independent Muslim woman with an entrepreneurial spirit. She was born in Makkahin in 556 CE. Her father was a prosperous businessman and a popular leader of the Quraysh tribe. Her first marriage left her a widow; and following the end of her second marriage Khadijah turned down numerous proposals from wealthy men, expressing little desire to marry again. She instead focused on her children’s upbringing and began building the merchant business she had inherited from her father. Women in Islam is not what man today want them to be as sex object and housekeepers First. Women in Islam was Independent , working business women, she was widow with children not virgin? She give Muhammad job and he work for her ? She proposed to him to merry her ? She did not cover her face ? If not that women Islam would never exist!!",E A,2021-04-17T12:00:24Z,2

"@Subhan Shaikh “Kill them where you find them” in reference to people who persecute Muslims violently is revenge. And my religion doesn’t drive out hate with more hate because that can perpetuate more anger and hate. When someone hates upon you, violently or not, you pray for them and try to be of assistance to them because they are lost. You inform them that what they’re doing is wrong. You try to help them see why what they’re doing wrong. You use your words to convey your message, not your fists. You fists will only deliver more blows and inflict pain, but your words can uncover truths and drive out darkness. They can convince and make someone look beyond their anger and hate and finally see how detrimental their actions are towards others.",Anna Gilyanna,2021-04-18T11:07:33Z,2
"@Anna Gilyanna While you people love to cite Quranic excerpts like “kill them where u find them,” you ignore that such verses clearly refer to treatment of those who would violently persecute Muslims or any person because of his faith. Similarly, every other verse that seems violent has a justification.<br />I bet you don&#39;t realize how misled you are about Prophet Muhammad PBUH that you didn&#39;t know he commanded the following uncompromising rules of war: O people! I charge you with some rules; learn them well…for your guidance in the battlefield! Do not commit treachery, or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate/disfigure dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Don&#39;t destroy a church or a temple. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy&#39;s flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone. Don&#39;t kill an animal except for eating. Be good to the prisoners and feed them. And in the end, don&#39;t enforce Islam. <br />Islam  at every step encourage peaceful living of every one. All I&#39;m saying is please don&#39;t disrespect and spread hatred against it. Thank you.",Subhan Shaikh,2021-04-18T08:58:32Z,2
"@Anna Gilyanna See, I don&#39;t deny the reality of Islamic extremism and I, as any other civilized muslim condemn such activities. I just know those activities, in any way are not justified and motivated in Islam. They are motivated by narrow minded extremists who think killing people who don&#39;t practice Islam and oppose it is a holy war. I would like to cite the teachings of Prophet Muhammad PBUH about holy war for you. Like majority of non-muslims, you too are misled by half knowledge of Islam. Suppression of women rights, the perception is factually incorrect, Islam may not encourage women to equally compete with men but it does encourage women to educate themselves in order to educate other women (as men are not allowed) and if no other source, earn their own living. Also, it is not mandatory for women to cover themselves from head to toe, they just need to wear loose clothings and their heads, especially hairs should not be visible to other males. Islam forbids many seemingly normal activities but every rule has its own rationale.",Subhan Shaikh,2021-04-18T08:56:25Z,3

"@Win Everything Brother you really really made me laugh. I mean really...this is like, i don&#39;t know, like the sky becoming earth, and earth becoming sky. It is like saying a fish is a porc or a butterfly is a fly : If you knew the number of comments i have written in which i &quot;advocate&quot; against western culture and their so -called freedom, especially when it comes to woman&#39;s freedom !!!  But if i am enough lucid to reject most of western culture, i am also enough lucid not to follow all the new harams of this, harams of that, this group does not like a woman doing sky with men who are not even one meter near her, say it is haram , an other group does not like seeing wemen educated, say learning and teaching is haram for them, a group does not like to see wemen&#39;s faces uncoveted say they must wear burka, a group say that a man must not hear the voice of a woman who is not family...sorry, this does not make any sense...by the way, saying God judges me, not you, is something else, it means &quot;i don&#39;t care what you think...&quot;. No, i care about what you think, but i will never blindly follow what people DECIDE it is haram or halal !!! It has happened many times that i quit some habits or stop doing some things, sometimes a real sacrifice, when i learn that it is haram.   But i use those brains that Allah 3azza wa jal asks me to use . It is true, and this is MY opinion, my principles, some sports require a way of clothing i will never accept...anyway, i myself don&#39;t see the indecency of skiing with men... and...<br />you don&#39;t know me, you don&#39;t know my way of living, so don&#39;t make yourself guilty of some &quot;suspicion&quot;.

How is this propaganda?  What is not true about what the girl is saying.  Can girls study and play sports freely in Afghanistan?  Many of us value that very highly.  Maybe it is a question of what you value?  Values are not necessarily propaganda.  People are allowed to value different things than what you value.,xbluebells,2021-04-17T12:23:14Z,0

Bawarchi ban ke kuch nahi kr paoge wo chahte the main bhi engineering karu apne bade bhai ki trah... But mere bade bhai ne mujhe samjhaya and usi ne mujhe suggest kia ki apni skill dikhana hai to abhi se start ho jaao... To maine soch lia tha ki main Youtube channel khol kar apni recipe logo ko dikhaunga hi and then 9th me maine ek channel channel start kia tha but mmy papa mana kr die the ki abhi pdhai me dhyaan do ye sb mat kro 12th ke bad krna jo krna hai...but 12th tak wait krna boht zyada ho jata isilie 10th board ke khtm hote hi maine apna new youtube channel &quot;Cooking Beast Ayaz&quot; chalu kia 7 May 2018 ko...

I hope it too. I just found out that there&#39;s snow in the middle east especially in Afghanistan. But sadly I&#39;m just did the research that the snow is very dangerous for the people there. Most of the area is completely blocked of snow so it is very difficult for the people who living in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Hopefully this is resolved soon 😊👍,DOHC,2021-04-17T15:21:10Z,4

"@UNK IVV You&#39;re so stupid. Pakistan is an islamic country flooded by tourists this years everyone loves the country and the people. They offer free food to them the hospitality is on another level. People can&#39;t be perfect but islam is perfect and you cannot judge that by the action of some radicals who&#39;ve no knowledge of islam. You think islam is all about just killing and executing people but  Allah also said in the Quran &quot; Whoever killed an innocent human, he killed whole of humanity and whoever saved the life of an innocent human, saved whole of humanity&quot;. So stop and stop teaching us about our relegion. For us is our religion and for you is your religion. You chose to be a hypocrite remain a hypocrite! That&#39;s not gonna affect us in anyway.",Spidey,2021-04-20T07:09:59Z,1
