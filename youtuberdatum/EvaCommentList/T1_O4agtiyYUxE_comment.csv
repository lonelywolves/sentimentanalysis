"Although I very much enjoy your sharing of all that you do, and wish you and everybody the very best and great health, your words on lobster economics merits some qualification. <br /><br />Lobsters per capita, are quite plentiful where you are, as the supply is exponentially higher given the per capita demand of your location. From a trade perspective, this involves the term of comparative advantage, as a lobster where you are is far less expensive, then a lobster in Paris or New York. Where you are, there is virtually no cost of shipping, but for much of the rest of the world,   costs of shipping and other transportation while the lobster is kept alive, or frozen are quite high, along with the costs of lobster boats, fuel, employees, and docking. <br /><br />Then, throughout most other areas of the world,  there are far more people than lobsters, hence the equilibrium price of the Demand curve intersecting the supply curve, is at a much higher level than when one isn&#39;t on a small island in Yemen. <br /><br />So your claim of the value of the lobster created in the west being imaginary, in the kindest possible terms (as I do enjoy your videos, and truly appreciate all that you share of yourself and your adventures),  is a function of the supply and demand curves. Otherwise, per your words, the science of economics is simply..imaginary. I pray not, as otherwise I have a graduate degree that I wholly imagined spending 2 1/2 years to obtain, while sacrificing a lot of partying to study for it! <br /><br />Also, I can procure a pound of lobster at the store typically from $20 to $25, so not quite the $100 you mentioned. Even at a lot of restaurants in Las Vegas (not the pricey ones) it can be $35-$45.<br /><br />With comparative advantage, the Saudi&#39;s only have to drill a foot or two to strike oil, when in other countries you have to drill 8 times or more of that distance. The costs are far less expensive for the Saudis than many other countries, and thus, they have a comparable advantage of oil production, just as for you, for where you are, there is a comparable advantage for lobster, when compared to most other parts of the world.<br /><br />However, it might be pricier for you in your current location to procure most goods, from say a bagel to a nice dress, given the delivery charges, than if you were in any major city.<br /><br />So.....stay healthy, and always keep that wonderful positive, motivated, and adventuresome personality that makes you.....You!",Randy Lazer,2020-04-15T22:19:41Z,0
"This is cool! In Utah truth at Red Lobster we pay maybe $20 for a lobster dinner. New York might be $100 but I suppose it depends too where the lobster come from and if it&#39;s a sort fancy restaurant. We also have them in our grocery stores. Btw, there&#39;s a company that makes a case for Samsung phones that adds to the water proofing and will let you film in salt water. It&#39;s called a Life Proof case and they were the thing for a while when they first came out. Ask the super famous YouTube tech reviewers were giving them a thumbs up and getting sponsored by them for a period. There&#39;s always something new though and they move on. But this is so cool. Lobsters are tasty even though they&#39;re technically a giant Sea cockroach. Lol",Joseph Barney,2020-04-15T20:40:27Z,0

Maybe once she gets somewhere with better internet. She&#39;s charging her electronics with a propane generator and small solar panel. Also has really slow internet. We are blessed to even see as much as we are. <br /><br />I&#39;m very thankful Eva is sharing with us. I look forward to escaping to socotra daily. 😊,Aisha Abdi,2020-04-16T03:21:30Z,2
