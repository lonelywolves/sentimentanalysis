There is a thread of Islamic extremism In Pakistan and there are haters about. I spent 4 years there. It is difficult to get around as a foreigner and nobody would rent to me so I had to live in a hotel in Lahore. I did find a place but they quadrupled the rent. You have to be careful about Islamic extremists because there are kidnappings of westerners.  Someone tried to kidnap me in Lahore but I got away from him. They have a totally broken down legal system. I’m glad you are having good experiences but one has to be very careful.,Detox Lady,2021-03-24T08:46:58Z,0

The Mongolian, Saudia, oman, Kurdistan, Pakistan n many more;I learned soo much, ilhumdulilah. I love how much you enjoy the people, appreciate their culture, n really show the natural beauty of their countries. I love that you are doing your best to expose the malignment of some of these countries. As you said, the people are genuinely generous, hardworking, intelligent, artistic, n kind humans. Ilhumdulilah they have survived these political malignments:only bc they are tightly knitted, extremely hardworking, productive people. Thank you for your well placed, honest portrayals of these much ignored countries. I pray through you, n other travel bloggers the blessed truth light will be shed on these countries;n they will prosper.<br />Again, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I feel God is smiling on you. You are a vibrantly loving, n honest person. I, for 1, truly appreciate your very important work.

"Dear Eva, I&#39;ve watched nearly all of your videos over the last week or so and I really like the content that you create and provide - thank you for that, really!<br />I also recognised the more &quot;critical&quot; scenes you did here and there, e.g. mentioning the power of different passports or discussing your privilege of being a Western/white woman. <br />My very personal perception is that, as a travel vlogger who started doing this within the last few years, as someone who is following their dreams and wants to make a living out of it, you will probably want to refrain from criticism, especially when you are collaborating with different brands and governments as you obviously did here in Pakistan. Of course, that is perfectly fine and reasonable, but I have to say, it does take away from the things you say here in this video, for example. I have absolutely no doubt about the positive things you say and I would go to Pakistan in an instant, but the things you say here about modest dresscodes, patriachal structures, etc. sound very streamlined and euphemistic to my ears. I wonder if you have told your friends more in depth about your experiences than what you share here, where you are obviously making advertising for the Pakistani tourism industry. Of course there are strong women everywhere, even in very conservative countries, but that doesn&#39;t say anything about the structural problem or how you as a woman felt while being there. Were you traveling alone also, without guides? Where you told where to go and what to see? Were you able to go wherever you wanted to? Were you able to ask critical questions and still be welcome? <br /><br />You are asking in your video why would Pakistan not become the next #1 travel destination for a summer trip - well, you say it in your video - can you imagine the stereotypical summer tourist wearing a long sleeved swim suit during the day and partying without alcohol in the evenings? I guess that is why they go to Mallorca :)<br /><br />For example, the disclaimer you gave with your Saudi videos made your content so much more trustworthy. From what you said and what your Saudi friends said, I feel like I got a good idea of what it would be like to travel there as a solo woman. From your Pakistan videos, I did enjoy the entertainment and the beauty of your videos, but I see them like I see advertising and I don&#39;t turn to advertising for critical information.<br /><br />Anyway, that&#39;s just what I had to say after watching nearly every single one of your videos. Thanks and, after looking at your Instagram, please do also share your mid-pandemic adventures from Poland with us, we are curious :) have a good day!",Mira,2020-08-24T13:52:58Z,0

Pakistan treats tourists much different than they do their Christians. Christians are non citizens.  Some live in one room hand made brick buildings with dirt floors and sometimes no roof. It is difficult for them to get work. Their homes are often burned down and churches bombed. Pakistan hides it from tourists.,gloryboundkev,2019-12-29T11:29:38Z,1
"Western women don&#39;t travel to Pakistan without a male escort. I would say same about India and  other South Asian countries. Eva is quite an experienced traveller and  knows some Urdu, her travels are well organized and well resourced. This is her unique experience, this is not a general experience. Read travel advisory about current situation before you embark on a journey. Check out other blog&#39;s videos from Pakistan and see how many women are on the streets. Browse through local news for the destination. In tribal areas they have killed women for sing and clapping hands because they view it unislamic.",ashmax28,2019-12-29T06:55:38Z,1

"Eva zu Beck, you have done a lot for encouraging people to visit Pakistan. That’s great but it all sounds as though it is a serendipitous discovery. You are a foreign citizen travelling (with a crew?). You are not a local no matter how long you have visited. I am more inclined to believe what I hear from my family who are all born there, living there, and due to work and education placements are in quite a few different areas; which is that not everywhere is safe and wonderful. You said that yourself, but dismissed it as people wouldn’t go to those areas but sometimes young travellers will abandon caution and recklessly travel to places which are best avoided for different reasons. <br />Yes, our Pakistan is beautiful, and the people are warm and welcoming but, as with everywhere else in the world, there will be a few places that should be avoided and only be visited after checking local sources, in my opinion. Being upbeat talking about that 1% won’t take away any danger!",H’Alicia,2019-12-23T07:05:17Z,1

There are areas of Pakistan where it is very unsafe, like in the South-west of the country.

"&quot;In certain parts of the country, if you go to more rural conservative areas, you might encounter more patriarchal attitudes toward women. But that is also true of many other countries&quot;. Eva, come on, you lived there for half a year, didn&#39;t you? You&#39;re engaging in whataboutism here. Of course other countries have patriarchy, but you cannot deny that Pakistan is a particularly patriarchal country.

"very true. To say &quot;Pakistan is a very safe country to visit&quot; is stretching it too far.  Northern areas of Pakistan have intense terror activities as it shares the borders with Pakistan&#39;s arch enemy, India. Infact Swat valley which she describes as switzerland is known for terrorism. The valley is virtually ruled by Taliban and Pakistan military, with no say whatsoever by Pakistan&#39;s civilian govt, which is kind of puppet in the hands of its army. <br />When Imran khan became the PM, he just want to change the perception of Pakistan, so he invited some travel bloggers to visit pakistan and paint a rosy picture. I dont know Eva is one of them. Of course, things have marginally improved from how they were until 2016. But it is still a heavily &quot;controlled&quot; environment, where the situation can go out of hands any moment.",sv,2019-10-22T16:55:00Z,0

You even have the damn footage of it, and still you won&#39;t believe it just simply because you don&#39;t want to and plus you have been so blinded by the western&#39;s media crap.<br /><br />I bet you also think that now that she&#39;s traveling to other countries like Syria and Yemen, those countries also promoted her, right?!!! Mate if you think so, you really deserve a round of applause. <br /><br />And last but not least, that phones company is &quot;Pakistan Samsung&quot; and they promoted one of its videos not so long ago, once she already became viral and not before of that. So what&#39;s even the point you&#39;re trying to make with that statement?! Is she not allowed to take any work opportunities just because she happens to do blogging?!<br />Read everything that I said in detail and think about it, if you have some brains you&#39;ll see you made no sense on your previous comment.<br /><br />I&#39;m a half Spaniard half Pakistani, and I have been to Pakistan 2 times and loved every single second of it.

"In Turkey , we turks can drink alcoholic drinks in 365 days a year, I like Jaegermeister as I am from Serbian genes, from Veles Macedonia, Celisia, Amasia Blacksea region.  I like beer types, kamikaze drinks, votka, gin with lemon juice, orange juice in ultra all inclusive luxury hotels in Antalya, Kusadasi etc. Instead of Pakistan visits, I prefer to visit Mumbai, New Delhi, Sri Lanka luxury hotels and eat veggy meals, lunches , dinners. I am fanatically supporter of Bangkok visitor as I flew to Far East 7 times for 4 months in total to Chinese 8 cities and Thailand&#39;s 5  cities and if I could find my spouse in Thailand I wish to live in Bangkok with my deep heart for all my life with my children without returning back to Turkey. Istanbul, Ankara,Antalya,  Adana-Mersin, Samsun are developed cities by the way in Turkey with all infrastructres ready",Hakan's Life And Travels,2019-09-07T22:52:56Z,0

"I agree to you but not 100%..this may be 90% true if you are a traveller,but if you live there for longer things may change your opinion a little.. bombing in Lahore ,Islamabad,Karachi did happen randomly and could still do..and they do kinda blame everything on Amereeca (😏) ..and many do not like foreigners, especially not in their families ...and when you eat outside,better not care about what else could go inside cause of the heat lol ...elsewise,have fun! ..I love its places and traditions but maybe a bit too much pride I believe...The culture is not 100% Islamic but luckily a huge percentage of people is educated ,including the girls ,and they can at lest make the difference and can understand more or less where are we coming from ..🤝💖💖💖",Andreea Boloca,2019-09-07T22:25:26Z,0

"Your presentations on Pakistan are inspiring. It is always good to see a country portrayed positively. Regarding western media - when we hear stories about people like Malala Josefazi and Asia Bibi, both of whom suffered horrendous abuse, Malala in the Swat Valley at the hands of fanatics because she was promoting girls&#39; education, and Asia facing the death sentence because she allegedly insulted Muhammad, then this is what gives a country a bad reputation. Nobody can deny Pakistan has traditional conservative areas that subdue women, distort justice and give rise to human rights groups and international governments calling for an end to violence.",Trevor Jones,2019-09-05T21:46:01Z,0

"@1234123412341234 man, it is impossible to compare hospitality in France with hospitalty in oriental countries. IMPOSSIBLE. For me, there is not hospitality in France because of the social life which dominated with capitalisme, speed of life, and the help of the government which results in weak social connection. In addition, there is lot of issues related to the fact that foreigners are not really welcomed in France unlike in oriental countries. You have just to watch TV and read your media ... and also jokes you make about foreigners. I&#39;m not blaming you. But don&quot;t try to hide reality.",cooly,2020-11-07T14:46:53Z,0

"I have a friend who is a foreigner. Whenever he asks me about my country, i dodge his questions. He thinks that its because i don&#39;t feel comfortable about giving him my &quot;location&quot; which isn&#39;t correct in the slightest because 1. How would he figure out my address just by knowing what country i live in and 2. I&#39;m just afraid that he&#39;s going to stop talking to me because of all the misconceptions about Pakistan and i know that he has some strong opinions regarding some of those topics. So the moment he finds out that I&#39;m a Pakistani, he&#39;s not going to want to talk to me. <br />This makes me happy that someone is finally trying to clear these misunderstandings.

"On the question of, if Pakistan is safe, I would say, stay away from border area with Afghanistan and specially in Baluchistan. Pakistan is a big country and 90% of the country is perfectly safe, or let me say as safe as Turkey and Egypt are.

"Eva, so your funny story at the beach in Balochistan essentially is an example of &quot;tarr na&quot; which roughly translates to &quot;extreme curiosity&quot; in English. Basically, when we Desi&#39;s see one of our brethren in a foreign country, we feel the need to STARE the bejeesuz out of them, because that&#39;s the bubble we live in LOL! Every individual Desi thinks he or she is the only one that has ever ventured out of Pakistan or India. So that person was trying to make sense of why a white person, esp one who clearly isn&#39;t a Pakistani (not to be confused with light-skinned Pashtuns) would be in a desolate place of a sparsely populated province like Balochistan. That person may have been thinking that you were perhaps being kidnapped, because that is a possibility that we cannot sugar-coat and claim doesn&#39;t exist. However, Pakistan is generally a safe country if you use common sense! So glad you&#39;re loving it in my home country, wish you all the best and please visit the ancient sites of Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa in the Indus River Valley!

"Eva you’re a good soul. But you need to know the history of Pakistan. It was two wings of one Union. East and West. West Pakistan (todays current pakistan) was mistreating EastPakistan (Bangladesh) which had Bengali majority. WestPak, todays pakistans punjabi majority, misruled, used and abused eastpak. One of the worse racist country is Pakistan. They looked down on EastPakistani bengalis because most of them were brown, dark brown, dark in general. <br /><br />Hence the creation of Bangladesh came about. Being suppressed and oppressed for 24 years the Bengalis had enough. They then tried forcing urdu on the bengalis, trying to make it the officially language ONLY in EastPak which irked the EastPak bengalis. Despite all the looting and wealth taken out of EastPak GPD to make Islamabad the new capital from Karachi. Bengalis remained loyal and thought of the bigger picture as the country is gaining but when the language was forced that was the nail in the coffin of UNITED PAKISTAN .. who to blame? The racist Pakistani Punjabis.",HaSsy MiiA L.F.C,2019-02-15T14:43:41Z,0

"Eva just to add for the last myth. In fact those who call Pakistan as a terrorist country have their clandestine networks deep inside Pakistan which target innocent people as well as foreign visitors just to prove their statement positive by hook or by crook. With the grace of Almighty Allah, Pakistani LEAs and Pak Armed Forces have crushed such networks and will keep on hunting them down to save the honour of the country. And you must be in picture that those Networks are operated by what countries. Yes those countries for whom CPEC Project and Pakistan as a Nuclear Power is a real Pain in A**.",S Ali,2019-02-12T16:37:25Z,1

"@Andreea Boloca Well, you need to go to Pakistan. The first time you go you&#39;ll get a one year multiple entry visa. <br />Once you arrive in Pakistan, go to NADRA with your husband, it&#39;s the organization in Pakistan that issues ID cards. <br />Apply for a POC (Pakistan Origin Card).<br />It&#39;s valid for seven years and you can renew it online from anywhere in the world after that. <br />Next time you go to Pakistan, you don&#39;t need a visa. Just take your European passport and your POC. You should be good to go.<br /><br />Those from India, the process is easier for them. Once in Pakistan, they just need to make a statement, saying I&#39;m Pakistani. They need to give up their Indian nationality and that&#39;s it. They can hey a normal Pakistani ID and a normal Pakistani passport. It&#39;s because of the history of the two countries. Pakistan gives nationality to anyone who wants to be a Pakistani.<br /><br />You could do that too, but I believe your European passport should be more valuable. Cheers!",Planes and Stuff,2019-09-07T23:26:53Z,1

"Very nice video but not very realistic to be honest. I had been to Karachi back in Dec 2018 (14-15 months ago). I visited there after 10+ years and I have mix reviews. I know things have a gone much better over the years but the way you are explaining this video is something like A girl can visit visit anywhere and any time as they do in Europe, from Amsterdam to Brussels and Paris etc.  I&#39;d like to know did you travel by train all by yourself from Karachi to Lahore, Karachi to Hyderabad and other cities? Did you drive all by yourself in Baluchistan or did you have security with you? <br />Where did you stay in hotels ? and did you stay by yourself alone in the hotels?  I can write here for hours an hours. I appreciate your effort to bring the positive image of Pakistan but don&#39;t present it like Amsterdam or Brussels.",TravelGooroo,2019-02-12T01:28:54Z,0

"Hi Eva, the Pakistan Govt. plans to ease the visa requirements this year for around 55 countries, including most of Europe, hopefully including the UK. Maybe they&#39;ll get rid of the letter of invitation requirement or introduce E visas. I want to visit Lahore and Islamabad in November for 2 weeks, then me and a friend want to do a tour of North Pakistan in June 2020 with Wild Frontiers Travel. Pakistan can be the number one go-to destination in the world if things are made easier for tourists that wish to go there.  With BA flights from LHR to Islamabad resuming this June, an easing of visa requirements and your showcasing the stunning beauty of Pakistan to the world through your vlogs, this can happen.",Terry,2019-02-12T00:29:09Z,0
"Hi Terry, as you have said, the bureaucratic procedure related to visa and stuff have been one of the main hurdles in attracting foreign tourists. The previous government was really cautious in handing visas to foreigners on account of presence of foreign spies in the country. Improving security situation was the foremost priority of the government and that&#39;s why them taking a conservative approach in issuing visas was perhaps need of the hour. Still, one would think they could have done much more to make the procedure faster and better.<br />The tourism industry hasn&#39;t flourished as much as it should have post 2015/16 security improvement. However, with the change of government we are witnessing a refreshing change in the tourism policy and like you have mentioned, the visa relaxation for dozens of countries is at the heart of that change. From what I read, UK citizens are eligible for E-visa as well as Visa-on-arrival. There might be a few conditions to those visa like booking through a certain group. Even if such conditions are there, I am sure they wouldn&#39;t be laborious.<br />It definitely has the tools and resources to become a top traveling destinations but that would only be possible with the visits of foreign tourists like you. So you should definitely go through with your trip in November.  That infact is the ideal time really in terms of weather to visit Lahore, Islamabad or Punjab/Sindh for that matter. I am sure once you return from that trip, you&#39;ll be campaigning amongst your peers to give Pakistan a try for their next vacations!<br />Cheers!",Saveez,2019-02-12T06:13:14Z,1

Even if I don&#39;t find any other Eva there (of which I&#39;m sure of) it would still be Eva&#39;s home and a loveable place. I&#39;d remember Poland as Eva&#39;s Poland for the rest of my life.

The STHLM Diaries Gilgit and Baltistan is a must see. There are plenty of videos on twitter and you tube alike. Please check local weather forecasts in advance before booking. Try to avoid monsoon season. Other than that people are hospitable and the scenery is out of this world. It is quite inexpensive to travel in Pakistan employing a travel guest service is not a bad idea.,Fh V,2019-02-12T11:48:18Z,2

"Pakistan is the most richest country geographically in the world, and that&#39;s the only reason why the few countries struggling/ trying to brain wash the their countries people and showing them a wrong face of my beloved nation 🇵🇰<br />And the Policians from USA Europe and other big countries know the truth , but their people don&#39;t know,  just because they don&#39;t research the reality they just believe what ever their media says.<br />Muslims, Pakistani 🇵🇰 are friendly, loving, caring, welcoming, love to be host. Because Islam teaches us the true and the best path of leaving life.<br />Eva Thank you so much for showing real face of Pakistan to the world, <br /><br />Again Eva Thank you so much🙏 🌹🌹🌹",Status Tube,2019-02-11T14:20:06Z,0
