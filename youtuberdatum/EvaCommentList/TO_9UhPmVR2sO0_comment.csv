It seems that you being a non-muslim woman focus almost all your videos towards promoting the muslims and their culture.  In general the status of muslims and their culture have degraded in the in recent time.

"You are right. This is - probably - my favorite video of yours! Thank you.<br /><br /><br />And let me add, honestly, as a Lecturer in Islaam and Management: the way the Wakhi people treat (and protect) the guests, sharing things, greet each other warmly, upholding the customs-law, cooking and eating healthy food, etc.; are some fundamental teachings of Islaam. Muslims learn it from all 124,000 prophets and apostles of all ethnics. And IN ANY PLACE where Islaam is practiced with discipline, one would easily find these standards. <br /><br /><br />I am glad you&#39;ve found one, there. The Pakistanis are famous as one example of good Muslim society among some others. And een shaa Allah (God willing) I shall show this video to my students, as well. :)  <br /><br /><br />Again, thank you. May The One God, Al Eelaah, Allaah, bless and guide you to the light. And joyful eternity in the afterlife. <br /><br /><br />Aameen. :)",ATM - Abu Taqi Mayestino,2020-01-21T01:54:08Z,1

"All these things you have shared is not exclusively a party of wahi culture. This culture is very old predates even before Islam came to these region. Before 70 years it was a part of India and all the food habit and the way of life is similar to the people Living in mountainous region through out the Himalayan belt. 3/4th of Himalaya is still with India. You will find similar features in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Skim Arunchal Pradesh in India. So collectively you can say it is a historical party of South Asia Where India has a deep influence in every thing people do directly or indirectly. In India Each and every village is self dependent and most of the things are locally produce and rest is exported to urban center. Poverty is more in urban center not in villages across India. In our culture we are thought to be satisfied with minimal basic amenities. Excess use and exorbitant way of life is considered to wasteful.",sarvendra singh,2019-12-25T05:36:26Z,1

"My name is Patrick, I&#39;ve traveled to some interesting places around the world to find out about things. I dived with dolphins, rays and sea turtles, walked across volcanoes, was traveling in ancient temples, in the hinterland of the Taurus Mountains I encountered rattlesnakes and my personal highlight was the Serra de Tramuntana where I often feel drawn. In doing so, I had to fight my way through impenetrable areas, without which one would have dared to step backwards with the wrong technology. For me, there is nothing more exciting than to spend days wandering around with nature with unknown people and to take successful steps together with simple things and learn new things.<br />At the campfire you can also look back over the unpleasant moments of life and master together culinary delicacies, which can sometimes taste very strange. Often the people get to know each other anew through this intensive experience with nature and you find yourself again.<br /><br />My roots are located far back in Catalonia which belongs to Spain, the culture is very much influenced by people who live with nature and not against you. People who make no distinction between rich and poor, attractiveness and unsightliness. Sometimes this Spanish blood comes to light in my temper and a strong sense of justice comes out of me. Are you now scared and you prefer to be attracted to men who want to be men but are not. Or do you also have unbridled temperament in blood and can you engage in a lengthy conversation with me?<br /><br />Although I do not like English, the pitch is often overbearing, your voice makes me very angry. Your expressions enchant me. I do not know much about you except that I want to feel your breath on my skin, to a very special place.<br /><br />How can I reach you?",Patrick Schröter,2019-10-13T01:21:24Z,1

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UhPmVR2sO0&amp;t=5m30s"">5:30</a> This system exist in the Balkans too.. for example as a child me was visiting my grandparents in the village of eastern Macedonia... and me and my gbrandfather use to go with the cows and the sheeps and the goats at different days once every 40 days .. you go as proportionally as the number of heads of animals a household have.. some go more often some less... goats are the hardest !!! Next example ... when you go to water a certain garden crop in certain small valley nearby the village .. in that valley the land is shared by all of the villagers whos side on the village face that valley and when you go there you water everybodys garden vegetables so other do not need to come by.... Next example.. when you lid a fire in a stone owen outside to bake bread... you make and bake  the bread for at least 4-5 house-holds nearby the flour is bought and shared together and proportion by familly members is calculated ...  THIS IS HOW IT WAS...now it has been 20 years since and now only the old live there... the young moved out for &quot;better life&quot; and they do not realize that they left for worse instead !",Anton Davidoff,2019-09-18T04:39:28Z,0

Eva you forget to mention one vital lesson which is correlated to edible preferences in Jamalabad. Their life expectancy ratio is higher than the rest of the country. Which is due to the locally made food that the Jamalabad locals use in their daily diet. For those who don&#39;t know the importance of locally produced pure diary and agricultural food. Just google the average life expectancy in the Hunza valley of Pakistan. They live approximately 100 years and above unless they meet unnatural premature death.,Cibte Hacan,2019-05-10T14:48:27Z,0

Eva is an amazing amazing person... Undoubtedly... Bringing... Peace and Love to the region for the good showing real Pakistan rather than it being a easy chunk for negative news for you years without any defender... Finally it has acclaimed it&#39;s real and true face of enormous diversity and love with her video... Mostly I just loved loved the music of the flute... Spoke the language of Love in the entire region... Or at any part of the world may it perhaps live... Love from a Nepali fren.. Rejoicing the Love since many years... I know  a lot.... That I Will definitely like to bring the most beautiful aspect yet with a video disclosing the goodness in a gigantic manner,The Truth Explorer,2019-05-09T21:09:58Z,0

"Thank you Eva to show the hidden life style of Wakhi family in the northern area Gojal -Gilgit-Baltistan, before many V bloggers tried to show the wakhi family life style but you have shown it greatly Superb !!! <br />Actually  Gojal valley is famous for its rich natural wealth, landscape, picturesque locations, lofty mountains, breathtaking scenic beauty, wildlife and nature, glittering glaciers, valleys of lush green foliage and fruits, beautiful meadows, and pastures. The valley is comprised of 25 villages, including Ghawooshben (Ainabad), Shishkat (Nazimabad-1), Gulmit, Ghulkin, Seesoni (Hussani), Passu, Khyber, Ghalapan, Moorkhon, Jamalabad, Gircha, Sarteez, Nazimabad, Sost (Aminabad) Khudabad, Misgar, Qalandarchi, Avgarchi, Raminj, Yarz Rech, Kirmin, Reshit, Sharisafz, Kumpirdior, Zowoodkhon, Oston and Shimshal. Gulmit is Gojal’s largest settlement and Tehsil headquarters.Gojal is geographically the largest Tehsil in Gilgit-Baltistan spreading over an area of about 8,500 <a href=""http://sq.km/"">sq.km</a>. The valley borders with the Xinjiang-Uighur region of China and Wakhan Corridor or Little Pamir of Afghanistan.

"Please do a vlog on the first Polish pilot who helped set up the Pakistan Air Force after second WW. He lived in Lahore and loved Pakistan like you do.<br /><br />Our Man in Karachi’<br />Recently declassified files reveal how the Polish secret services tried to recruit a Pakistani hero as a spy<br /><br />by Natalia Laskowska<br /><br />Turowicz’s health was deteriorating. He knew he was a financial burden to his family. It would come as no surprise if he committed suicide, a Polish intelligence officer wrote in 1971.<br /><br />Wadysaw Józef Marian Turowicz was one of the refugee pilots from Poland who joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) and fought for Britain during the Second World War. No longer needed by the Allies after the war and unwelcome in their newly communist homeland, some of the pilots settled in Pakistan and helped to establish one of the most admired air forces in the world at the time.<br /><br />An aeronautical and astrophysics engineer in addition to being an avid pilot, he would go on to rise to the rank of Air Commodore and also headed up its space and missile programmes. Pakistan would bestow numerous national and military honours on him, and also grant him and his family Pakistani citizenship.<br /><br />He helped establish the Pakistan Air Force and was known as the godfather of Pakistan’s space and missile programme.But Air Commodore Władysław Turowicz (pronounced Vuadisuav Turovich) was a Pole who became a Pakistani hero.<br />A Polish man who became the national hero of Pakistan. His name does not exist on the pages of Polish history, but he figures in the records of Służba Bezpieczestwa, or SB, the security service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the People’s Republic of Poland, which allocated a big budget and a group of its best men to recruit Air Commodore Turowicz into its structures.<br /><br />“Did he spy against Pakistan?” I asked the employee of Poland’s Institute of National Remembrance in Warsaw who guided me through the microfilms on Turowicz and his family.",K Sal,2019-05-09T14:10:57Z,0

"The photo , oh yeah I see actually these clothes are actually traditional Pakistani clothe(I wonder how you couldnt recognise that), we actually lost our actual wakhi traditional central Asian handicraft cultural dress (except for the hat ) and many music and dance aspect of our culture in pakistan,  obviously that apparently  happen with many cultures  here. However,  ofcouse  our culture is maintained in its original form  in the other central Asian countries xiks lives and even  in china. (For I doubt, if you may know about the colorful cultures of central asia )  Nevertheless, our nature of  frankness ,friendliness , hospitality, acceptance  and open and joyful  environment; such aspects of our culture always stays the same whenever we might live .",nazneen,2019-05-18T09:02:04Z,0

nazneen Are you born in Tajikistan or Pakistan?? You have move to Tajikistan from Pakistan right??,now me!,2019-05-29T13:50:47Z,1
nazneen &amp; Fakhira Nice to meet both of you. Really you have colorful culture. Before watching this video &amp; reading your comments I don&#39;t know much about Wakhi,now me!,2019-05-29T13:49:39Z,1
"@51Fakhira  hi there, <br />I m glad to know there are Persian speakers here. Persian is a very beautiful language  I love  Persian songs very much. It&#39;s very vibrant and melodic. Actually our wakhi culture in pakistan too lost it&#39;s colorful cultural dress and dance  here as you can see them wearing shalwar kameez in the video and I think it has happened with most of cultures here. However, in Tajikistan our culture is preserved Like Persian is in its colorful form in  central Asian countries.",nazneen,2019-05-18T14:48:25Z,0
"nazneen me hazara girl from quetta ,pakistan,we are too persian speaking and that khush amaadi(welcome),is also used in us ,,in our culture female do  wear that type of cap under their veil  but pakistanis hazaras arent practicing that cultural dresses in their daily life now😊",51Fakhira,2019-05-18T14:36:30Z,0
"@51Fakhira well  yeah actually wakhi and Persian are both in the same language family (Iranian branch of indo Iranian)Most importantly Xiks has always lived side to side with Persian  people so we have quite similar culture and we have a lot of Persian loan words and we use  some Persian phrases very casually .  Infact,although in pakistan there  aren&#39;t Persian here yet,  I grew up listening to tajiki and persian songs most of my life.",nazneen,2019-05-18T10:21:28Z,0

Pakistanis are definitely Indo Aryans. Specially the Northern parts,Black Flags of Pakistan the East,2019-05-09T12:38:06Z,5
"@Black flag of the east <br />Well it is somehow true but not entirely ...there are 7 languages spoken in gb of which  shina  and khowar belong to  indo Aryan in indo Iranian language family , balti languages are sino Tibetan however wakhi is from Iranian branch of indo Iranian language family like Persian. O and yeah brushaki has no known origin.",nazneen,2019-05-18T10:32:11Z,1
@nwfp nwfp No No brother all the Punjabi people are pure Aryan only some Indian(dark brown) immigrants are actually mix but we are definitely pure Aryan just like our Northern Brothers.,ALPHA GHOST,2019-05-16T16:45:51Z,0

"@Gas &amp; Diesel  that happens in Afghanistan side of badakhsan not here probably because it&#39;s very cold there . Any way I dont like milk tea it has a utterly rediculous taste. I think it has no taste of itself or just the taste of the milk or suger or salt but since we have abundance  of milk people make tea anyway . I suggest if you visit gojal you should try our  green teas (banafsha, bozlanj  and my favourite chumuro which has a very distinct lovely smell) found in the pastures and hilly  regions  . They are benifical in many ways and are  natural tea requring none other favouring ingrediants .",nazneen,2019-05-18T10:42:46Z,2
