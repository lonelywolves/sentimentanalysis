"Salaam ; I really like your Videos  and I have enjoyed watching it as Afghanistan is without doubt on my travel list .Unfortunately it has disappointed me you comments about our religion of islam especially contrasting it with Buddhism which give an impression that islam is a kind of war, radical religion and Buddhism a kind of love and  peace  philosophy which unfortunately its not the case lets take   730 000 muslim Rohingya refugees as an example .just invite you to know approach toward islam :)<br />anyway congratulation for all videos",Max Gogola,2021-04-17T00:28:20Z,0

You coukd have said dont visit kabul as its not safe but you mentioned your ethnicity and said dont visit non-hazara areas. If i was racit i would have said a millin things about you that a pashton would say. I havent said any of those things. I have no problem with you, bamiyan belongs to me as much as it belongs to you.

Qurt is salty cheese it&#39;s not supposed to be that hard but you probably need to bite it hard from the edge to get to the soft bit. Gul&#39;s local dress is fabulous lovely colours. Gul means Flower and he seem very lovely person like his name ❤ Afghanistan can be very cold in the night it can burn your skin ❄<br />The hole in the ground where they cook bread is called Tanor or Tandor I remember my mum god bless her soul used to cook the same bread for whole family.<br />Chelburg is the combination of two Persian words Chel means 40 and burg means tower.

Hi. You once traveled to Iran and now to Afghanistan. Countries at war with the United States. Did you gather previous information to travel to such countries or do you travel to these countries by chance? And would you like to travel to Iran again? I heard that you loved Iran very much and how do you see the country of Iran?<br /><br />thanks Eva,Hero - Let's see Yazd differently,2021-04-06T10:51:13Z,0

"Like every religion, or country there are normal good ppl who set good examples &amp; their attitude can be used to judge the whole of the community and there are also extremist in society who ruin the reputation and image of certain creed. The same goes for Muslims. Their religion tells them to not force anyone to accept or work upon Islam and if they do, they will gain bad deeds, but still, there are some extremist out there, like the Taliban who take things to the next level. Their laws have overtaken the beauty of Afghanistan. And so for safety reasons, ppl don&#39;t go there and get a chance to experience its beauty. Well, good job Eva for doing what u did, it takes a lot of courage to be a solo, female, traveller + go to places that don&#39;t have the best security. People look at Afghanistan in such a bad way and none realize how beautiful Afghanistan is. I hope this vid of urs creates enough awareness and is enough convincing to change ppl&#39;s mindsets.

"This is amazing and brought back memories when I used to work in Bamyan in 2003. I was stuck on Shatu pass from Bamyan to Panjao for one night due to heavy snow and night fall. As you said, one mistake and you plung off the cliff. So we had to wait for day break to continue our journey. It was nerve-wrecking but something I would never ever forget in my life. It is truly a country that steals your heart. <br /><br />The Afghan fire oven is called bukhari and I had a love and hate relationship with it. Lol! The candy-like ball is a kind of cheese made from the milk of the local sheep which has the biggest fatty fluffiest butt I had ever seen!<br /><br />The Afghans are tremendously generous and warm.

"The journey was beautiful but the destination was absolutely stunning, no wonder they build a castle out there and it is untouched, great to see such untouched places still remain around the world but sad that the people are suffering due to no tourism. Wishing Afghanistan a prosperous and peaceful future no one deserves it more than them who have suffered a lot but have a rich history. Love from Pakistan",Arsalan Ahmad,2021-04-03T19:53:11Z,1

"@Mark S  no sir what they are practicing is the image that US has made, not the image of true Islam,  I have studied Islam and I am a Muslim,  all I learned of my religion was honesty and kindness towards all the creatures, the Islam that these people are practicing is the religion of the police officer who killed George Floyd by pushing his knee in to his neck, obviously you can not imagine that this officer was a Christian,  these people might call themselves muslim or ISIS but if you study hard enough you see ISIS was created by US not the religion that was sent by God the Almighty.",Safieh T,2021-04-04T19:32:00Z,1

Whilst I enjoy travel and watching travel videos by independent vloggers, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s responsible travel at his time.

"&quot;Solitude in the city about the lack of other people or rather their distance beyond a door or wall, but in remote places it isn&#39;t an absence but the presence of something else, a kind of humming silence in which solitude seems as natural to your species as to any other, words strange rocks you may or may not turn over&quot;.

I’d love to visit Pakistan and much of the Middle East but I’ve been told I’m crazy for even wanting to with as much unrest as there is over there. <br />Afghanistan is somewhere I’d love to go one day — my ex was military and never believed me when I told them that it snowed there or that he’d need his winter gear when there. Needless to say I won $100 in a bet 😁 <br />Your vlogs have opened my eyes to not only knowing I can travel, but when I’m older, I can do it alone once my kids are grown!

"@Eva, from your initial videos you seemed unbiased but unfortunately it seems the bias is innate to most neo generation Europeans because of centuries old prejudice and decades of hypnotic brainwashing by western media.<br /><br />Firstly, your video relentlessly mentions the security situation of Afghanistan, thank you. But never even once the &quot;WHY&quot;?<br />Although you did allude to Taliban as the reason without a single mention of War waged and ravaged by US of A, and its allies which includes your countries of origin (Poland) as well as citizenship (Britain).<br /><br />- Who do you think conducted the relentless Carpet bombing for 2 decades???<br />- Who burnt the villages and massacred ppl of Afghanistan, raped their women and children, burnt down their fields and bombed their schools and hospitals???<br />- who ran inhuman classified and illegal detention centres in the areas designated as &#39;Green Zones&#39; within Afghanistan? <br />- whose assasins, killer contractors, collected lil children&#39;s pinkies as trophies in their socks? <br />- who went after the Afghanistan scientists, scholars and health care workers in the initial days of a 2 decade war? <br />- who overthrew the elected govt of Afghanistan on the premise of a made up story without any evidence?<br />- who threaten the sovereignty of Afghanistan till this day with impunity from UNO?<br /><br />There is only one answer but it requires a lot of courage and sincerity to answer it.<br />The world definitely belongs to the brave but hypocrisy could be veiled as bravery sometimes.<br /><br />Unsubscribing to your channel.

"@Phoebe Foxli - likewise, when I was in Europe, I saw brothels and licensed prostitutes. High school kids sourcing these &#39;licensed prostitutes&#39; too. Something unimaginable in India. Thanks to Islam. We were much ahead of the west in terms of Nudity and porn. Our temples are riddled with porn sculptures which will put AVN to shame, preserved as embarrassing heritage. Again thanks to Islam. It all changed and civilization became the norm. India a Golden bird with a GPD of 37% of the rest of the world (watch Shashi Tharoor&#39;s Oxford Union debate). And we became &#39;cultured&#39; which attracted the British, French, Dutch, Portuguese to India as &#39;traders&#39; later turned &#39;terrorists&#39; who invaded India by deciet, and looted, plundered and ravaged it for 200 years.

"@Phaneendra Rao ok India...then we could talk hours about women rights...😁 When I was in India I was shocked and disgusted that porn (magazines, videos) is sold in common markets and everywhere in the streets, where young children and teens can see it and at the end think, that this is normal behaviour. In euorope selling porn to teens under 18 is forbidden. But of course if they want it they can get it somehow. I have heard of kamasutra. Nothing for me but I don&#39;t mind other people living this. It&#39;s not my business what other people do. <br />Look, in all societies - mine, yours and others - there are bad and good things. The important thing is that we all tolerate the way of living others have. Let&#39;s have more peace in the world - it starts in front of our own door...<br />I wish you and your family all the best, especially good health. 🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🌷🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀",Phoebe Foxli,2021-04-04T11:03:59Z,0
"@Phoebe Foxli - you clearly show ignorance of basic history. Come to India and we will show you the live examples of historic porn. Have you ever been to Ajanta Ellora or Khajuraho? The origins of Kamasutra? Well, which remote area in Europe are you or your ancestors from? You seem to desensitize both Nudity and Porn in the same breath. Must be normal for you but for humans it&#39;s a matter of &#39;modesty&#39;. Thanks to Islam. Have you heard of that term yet?? 🤨",Phaneendra Rao,2021-04-03T19:04:05Z,1
@Phaneendra Rao How can you think of pornography when talking about a monument from the 11 century? This is history and the people who built it did certainly not think of porn when they made it. And I would say that between nudity and porn there is a lot in between! And why do you think that in the western world porn is common and normal? You have the wrong information. Where do you live?

"Well, Afghanistan is breathtakingly beautiful and lovely like the poetries of Rumi that when you read it, no matter in which language but Rumi&#39;s poems melt your heart. ❤<br />Afghanistan is also Rumi&#39;s homeland. 💟<br />Afghanistan has a very rich and ancient history and culture.<br />The Achaemenids, which was one of the largest empires in the world. He ruled this beautiful land 300 BC. And let me add another important point that the religion of Afghanistan before Islam was not only Buddhism but also Zoroastrian. And Afghanistan has brought many great poets and great scientists to the world and raised them in their arms, like Rabia Balkhi (the mother of Persian/Farsi/Dari language, who was born in this country ca. 1000 years ago, lived and was buried in this land. <br />Another great author Maulanai Balkhi that is known as Rumi ( also known as the Shakespeare and father of persian/Farsi/Dari language, who lived in 13th century) Ibn Sina in west known as Aveccina (known as the father of medicine whose Europeans used his medical book for 700 years and learned medicine from him, and etc. Brilliant and genius people were born and raised in this lovely land. Afghanistan has uncountable pure stories. We hope that lasting peace will be coming soon in our lovely Afghanistan. Because I believe everyone deserves to live in peace. Long love humanity. 🥰❤<br />I thank Eva for visiting lovely Afghanistan and sharing such amazing stories and images from Afghanistan. <br />I hope throughout these clips and stories people of the world are able to recognise and see the real Afghanistan and Afghan people because as I know in the western counties most people unfortunately have negative concepts and ideas about Afghanistan and its people. I hope such clips and stories can change their perspectives. Once again million thanks dearest Eva. <br />Keep shining and take care, have fun in lovely Afghanistan 😊",Aziz Sadaqat,2021-04-03T01:33:26Z,1

Thanks Eva you continue to bring back such wonderful reminiscences for me. Many years ago now we attempted to drive from Bamiyan to Bandi Amir but the snow was too heavy. There were three Afghanis who had hitched a ride with us and when our driver decided we could go no further they simply got out and decided to walk. The amazing thing was that all they had on their feet were open plastic sandals !

The Vlog doesn&#39;t address any of these issues unlike Bald and Bankrupt and his Soviet vlogging and his incisive commentary . Left unsatisfied Eva as  the security situation is neither  explored nor explained. No suggestions as to how tourisn could flourish or the security issues addressed so I&#39;m not sure what the purpose of this particular  vlogg was? I think some research and discussion was needed on the viability of travelling this remotely into Afghanistan and any dangers. Just didn&#39;t get the purpose of this vlogg.

The way you say Afghanistan is always associated with Islam is extremely offensive. First of All 99%of us are Muslims and we are nothing  without Islam and we are so grateful for it. The better known history of Afghans start as Afghans converted to Islam so using words like radical Islam is pathetic. There’s no such thing as Radical Islam. If you can’t respect the main priority of Afghans you’re not welcome. Please watch your tongue.,Omer Tasleem,2021-04-02T16:57:18Z,2

Those salty balls have a nasty taste made with goat cheese &amp; yogourt I tasted them when a fellow shared some with me at an outdoor restaurant in Turkmenistan ... it took a lot of beer to wash it down. I have stayed in many home stays along the Silk Road Route and always found their people hardworking, living a simple life but proud to show off their country and share their lifestyle and roll out their welcome with their tea with a visiting tourist.  Yes, I love the host, so proud of his heritage and so welcoming ... I would visit tomorrow if I were allowed.",AidaJof,2021-04-02T16:44:29Z,2

Anyone else notice in this and the last video how Nazima smiles for the camera and looks super depressed otherwise?,Mira,2021-04-02T14:57:28Z,5
"@Mira well because people “commonly say” it doesn’t make it right. We all have different facial features, not having a smiley face all the time doesn’t mean one is sad and vice versa. It is definitely wrong to point out that someone “looks depressed”✌️",Wholesome Living,2021-04-02T17:48:01Z,0
@Wholesome Living You know perfectly well that &quot;someone looks depressed&quot; is something people commonly say and has nothing to do with the diagnosis of a clinical depression,Mira,2021-04-02T17:41:33Z,0
She looks just uncomfortable in front of camera,Things what i like,2021-04-02T15:08:44Z,1

I can&#39;t believe u took the challenge to Afghanistan. People look at it in such a bad way and none realize how beautiful Afghanistan is. I hope this vid of urs creates enough awareness and is enough convincing to change ppl&#39;s mindsets. Good luck. I am a huge fan of ur work and how u take on challenges. It&#39;s hard to be a solo girl traveller.,Mariyam Ajaz,2021-04-02T14:56:22Z,87
"​Like every religion, or country there are normal good ppl who set good examples &amp; their attitude can be used to judge the whole of the community and there are also extremist in the society who ruin the reputation and image of the certain creed. The same goes for Muslims. Their religion tells them to not force anyone to accept or work upon Islam and if they do, they will gain bad deeds, but still, there are some extremist out there, like the Taliban who take things to the next level. Their laws have overtaken the beauty of Afghanistan. And so for safety reasons, ppl don&#39;t go there and get a chance to experience its beauty. Well, good job Eva for doing what u did, it takes a lot of courage to be a solo, female, traveller + go to places that don&#39;t have the best security.",Mariyam Ajaz,2021-04-05T19:27:30Z,2
