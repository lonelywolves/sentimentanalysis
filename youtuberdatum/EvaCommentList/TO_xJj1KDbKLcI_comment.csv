"Eva you just sparked flash backs close to 40 years old.<br />I used to go for my physics tuition just opposite the Bombay Bakery.<br />Could still feel the fresh smell of coffee,macaroni and the chocolate cakes blended with almonds.<br />Papa used to buy very regularly from The Bombay Bakery as it was a delicacy for many living in Karachi.<br />Hyderabad in the 70s was a modern,cultural and intellectual city with a touch of artistic class.<br />Hyderabad radio station produced great artists and actors.<br />Trust me I am not being nostalgic but those were amazing times the 60s and the 70s and Pakistan was a tourism hub.<br />Papa used to buy very regularly from The Bombay Bakery as it was a delicacy for many living in Karachi.<br />Gradually things just faded away.<br />But the bakery in a a house is still there to remind of those glorious days.<br />Memories are forever❤️<br />Thanks 😊 Eva<br />Thank you 🙏 so much.",Najeeb Khan,2020-12-26T19:20:47Z,0

"Why would some one (especially a girl) leave everything behind her/him in Europe and visit a third world country (Third world Not for me but for Western people )? After achieving your target and hidden agenda You must confess that your all good thoughts about Pakistan were fake and you were never impressed. Don&#39;t make us fool. Obviously one of your motive behind visiting Pakistan is getting fame, popularity and followers. Most important: Who cares about your thoughts for Pakistan and Pakistanis. We are Proud of us and we don&#39;t care what other people think about us.",Rizwan Khan,2019-07-17T15:49:42Z,0

"Verdict: This is by far the best introductory vlog on Hyderabad, why introductory? Will come on it later...<br />Let me first say that there are no comparisons, as these are age old but sweetest debates in Pakistan... Karachi vs Lahore, Toyota Corolla vs Honda Civic, Wasim vs Waqar, Jahangir vs Jansher and so on. People all around Pakistan are most hospitable and loving.<br />Why introductory; well the 3 places u visited are on top, but these are also tip of the iceberg. When u dive in deeper, you&#39;ll see the culture, the art, the architecture, the music, the history, the handicrafts, the weather, the talent and warmth of the people of Hyderabad. It is one of the most peaceful at the same time happening place, in even toughest of times in the country. Did you notice the wind-catchers on top old architecture or the historical fort where you had that flawless Rabri or ease of buying in Resham gali.... btw can you imagine that the yellow mehndi dress you loved was just under $5. Did someone gift you those famous glass bangles? Did you see Hala Handicrafts Or did you go to 200 yrs old St. Bonaventure&#39;s &amp; St. Mary&#39;s High Schools. Did you try Gulab&#39;s Paan or Palla Fish.... and much much more. Well I need not to emphasize bcz you&#39;re coming back to Hyderabad to explore more, for sure iA (tip: check the dates of Lahooti Melo / Festival). <br />Thanks for such an awesome vlog.
