"Hi, Apart from the fact that you make nice cultural videos, I d like to talk about something else that you carefully mentioned in this one. <br />You r more than right to think that all kind of restrictions will not be soon over. It will get worse because there is an evil agenda behind all this. People’s lives r being ruined from young to old. some r desperate and others even contemplate on suicide. However if we stick to Jesus, He will take care of us. “Ask and you shall receive&quot;, words of Jesus himself. Therefore don’t get discouraged because at some point God will intervene and rid us if this slavery.  We need to pray fir His help.<br />God bless you.",Maria Young,2021-03-28T13:10:05Z,0

"Your so right in stating that governments are not taking the right approach and so many industries are being sacrificed to try and control something which can’t be controlled. Countries with lockdowns don’t do a lot better than countries with not so strict lockdowns, so the narrative is just not right. I’m living in the Ukraine and traveling to my fatherland is next to impossible because of all the rules and regulations at this moment. I really hope, want and need the world to come back to its senses. And last but not least, we love watching you travel video’s.",Harm Poelen,2021-03-08T10:03:42Z,0
"Just one note about being brave. You are able to travel because a lot of people are staying at home.<br />Staying at home in these times is not about being afraid. Is about being responsible. Even if your test is negative it doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be infective for others.<br />Your freedom ends where the freedom of others begins.<br />In pandemic times the &quot;brave&quot; is who&#39;s able to stay, not the ones unable to adapt and understand the impact of their decisions on the society.",Marco Casamassima,2021-03-07T20:38:07Z,0

"I understand that many businesses and industries are hurting, but this is life and death. I think we shouldn&#39;t be traveling in masses yet. I believe that governments need to sort of financially &quot;carry&quot; citizens/small businesses as much as possible until we get past the danger. I also believe that we need to think about the next pandemic and take steps to prevent it. Stop exploiting animals, stop consuming animals. 75% of pandemics have been caused by animal exploitation and consumption. If the next pandemic is bacterial in nature, we are really screwed because of antibiotic resistance due to, you guessed it, Animal Agriculture.",Deb BG,2021-03-02T05:53:19Z,0

"Well said. For the last 11 years I take groups from Israel to pray on graves of Jewis Torah sages in Europe. I love traveling and happy to combine it with a spiritual purpose. My little company is called: &quot;Chofets Chaim - Soul Tours&quot; (the Chofets Chaim was a giant Torah sage burried in Radin, Belarus). If I had to give it up for a neccessary reason, than I must. But the lockdowns are not a neccessity, but an unjustified behavior, result of panic reaction not based on logic and facts. Hopefully we&#39;ll gain back sanity and start living again rather than suffocate life out of irrational fear for life. Have a good life, Eva, and keep on cheering our lives with your amazing stories. Shalom.",Shmuel Kaufman,2021-02-04T01:46:11Z,0

"I think what one wants to say about the frivolity of travel is to fly on holiday, much like getting on a bus and without any sensory awareness of the surroundings, the people and experiences of slower travel, the journey has become unimportant and only the destination matters. If one could beam from one position to another, people would probably do it and also overcome this shock, only to find what they wanted to leave at home. The common holidaymaker is not looking for the foreign, the surprising, the frightening or the unfamiliar. That may be the answer to why something is perceived as frivolous: Pure consumption, travel as an economic end in itself. <br /><br />That said, I still wouldn&#39;t want to forbid anyone or find arguments to condemn someone for it. Everyone has to know what they are doing and why they are doing it. I stopped flying, a conscious decision, but I wouldn&#39;t give up travelling because of it. Just find another way. The many moralisers who now want this or that regulated and forbidden, maybe they are just working off their guilty conscience of having indulged in things they don&#39;t really stand by. <br /><br />Anyone who runs a restaurant, hotel or other business as a small or medium-sized entrepreneur probably didn&#39;t do it to become a millionaire, but to feed himself or his family and to have a purpose in life. Culture is contained in this and it will die if we continue to lock ourselves in. <br /><br />The metropolises and megacities are not a good place to be at the moment, they probably weren&#39;t for a long time before, where everything is designed for conformity and sameness. We humans need the diversity and the unexpected, the many different talents and efforts on this beautiful planet. I discovered your vlog just a few days ago and thank you so much for your films. They give me something of the world that I didn&#39;t know yet and it&#39;s the amateurishness of it that is the good. <br /><br />Greetings from Germany. If you ever visit here, come and see me.",E.

Many, many jobs have been lost to this pandemic (including mine), businesses have been lost, MANY industries have suffered huge losses &amp; everyone will be impacted for years to come. It is devastating, but we need to put public health first!  I can no longer work in my industry - I have to do something different, as do many.  We all have to adapt &amp; make sacrifices during this time.  You are not special or different.  Sorry that you don&#39;t like what&#39;s happening, but NO ONE DOES. What you are doing is incredibly irresponsible - I don&#39;t care how many negative tests you get.  This thing is changing everyday &amp; we are finding out new things about it every single day, such as the fact that you can still be infected even if you test negative.  You are not only putting yourself at risk, but others too &amp; it is attitudes and behaviors like yours that is causing this thing to spread and kill more people every single day.

"If the global population continues to play this game and bow down to their governing authorities, they&#39;ll soon be finding out what life was like under communist rule.<br /><br />It is a well known fact that masks do not work.  Study after study have shown the ineffectual nature of masking orders.  Indeed, there is documented damage that occurs as a result of wearing masks for extended periods of time.  The damage being done to the hospitality industry will take a generation to recover from.  Eva nails it when she states that travel is not a frivolous pursuit.  Travel brings us all closer together and encourages détente.  <br /><br />Also, Sweden.<br /><br />To state that governments are trustworthy is a bald faced lie.

"those who point finger whoever wants to travel, are not doing so for the sake of the world, and worrying for others. let s get real! people are egocentric beings! rarely they care for another! this is all another mask! like, why do you wear a mask- to show that I care! really, and that is why you throw it down the street the next second? (I do not refer to you, ofc). this a a real masquerade. I have read a lot of history, to know how many genocides this world is capable of.  and what man is capable of! when one sees someone intelligent, good hearted, free in their spirit, they try to pull him/her down, because people like this are like a mirror for the ugliness of the world, and they cannot stand it! there is hunger in the world! there is poverty! there is inequity . man created, always. and now, some smart evil men will try to bring all these on the wall, and want to save us- yeah, right!- pushing people kind into the harshest communism. you will miss your Stefan car. we have no idea. Jesus was the kindest hearted, performed many good deeds and curing disease that nobody could, brought people to life from death, and yet, people wanted Him dead! they said- wouldn&#39;t t be appropriate to DIE JUST ONE, for the sake of others?! it did not matter He was innocent! this will repeat with all who would stand against these insanities. and you are right again, how can someone say that CARES, when lifts their shoulders like....that s life- when SO MANY people lost their jobs! tourism mean so so much, means hotels, restaurants, tours, people, craftsmen. that is why, all of a sudden you&#39;ll hear the story about countries GREAT DEBTS! and of course all of a sudden, someone good (in appearance only), will simply ERASE countries s debts, and invent UNIVERSAL INCOME. all so lovely, right? BUT for this UNIVERSAL thing, a man will be forced to accept the mark of the beast. without it, you will not be able to buy, nor sell. you will be pointed as humankind enemy! what will we choose then?!

"doesn t your nose hurt from all those pcrs? those pcr s are simply scams, because when someone has a virus, it would also be in their mouth, in their saliva. there is no need to dig so deep up someone s nose! it is called excretory immunity, and if you have a virus, in your saliva would be Igg and Iga. so it is really weird! you say that this is the new norm for travelling, but it is actually a precursor of what is to come. mandatory vaccine! just like cattle, if you wish to travel you would have to accept ANYTHING on your body, a government wants! this is part of 2020 Agenda, of ONU, which was actually set up in 2015. they were talking about- pay attention- UNIVERSAL HEALTH. and they repeated throughout that agenda many times that nobody must be left behind, which is pretty scary, and yes, it was also about world vaccination. actually all those governments PLEDGED to fulfill the agenda. and by the way, to remove the right to property, since the right on your own body, and right to free travel are kind of on their way to history. common wealth, common good, and Erath -common home, should scare anyone. these nice words in appearance mean PERSECUTION of those who would just not accept these. are you willing to take the covid vaccine, so that you could travel? maybe you think it is a small thing, even though it is very experimental, but this would open Pandora s box! we will never be free again! think!",Raphaelly Raphaelly,2020-12-30T09:59:57Z,0

I would like to believe things would be different for the next year! and please do not give up hope! I still have travel plans and hikes abroad for the future!

I could spend a lifetime (30 years more of hiking )  travelling hiking Canada and not see all of it!   I have been thinking of going there myself!  or back to Norway for hiking  but live in Sweden!   Canada sure has the beautiful wilderness indeed! and your partner is there!

"This is a tricky one Eva. I live in New Zealand where there is a 2 week quarantine for visitors to this country. As for the most part we are covid free, except for those testing positive coming in to the country. We locked down early and because of this now have freedom within our country to do and go where ever we please. Our tourist industry has suffered as has the rest of the world. But the thought of opening g our boarders and allowing everyone in is so very scary. It is the visitors who bring the covid to us. So what is the answer here. I dont know. Even our own NZers who live abroad have to quarantine for 2 weeks to come here. This is working. It keeps all of us safe and makes us free to do what we choose within our country. Because of our strict covid rules we havent suffered nearly as much as the USA and Grest Britain and parts of Europe. We aim to keep it this way. <br />I have a son who wishes to travel now. A son with asthma who thinks he is bulletproof. He is not. It is so very scary out there. What is the answer here?",Fiona Hislop,2020-12-27T23:41:17Z,1
Your videos are amazing. I watched about 10 today as I just discovered your channel. <br />I believe the travel industry is being hit the hardest. One of my best friends used to work for Royal Caribbean on the cruise and they are all shut down with no hope of opening any time soon 😢.

"I think covid will probably still be around throughout 2021, but I feel like once you get a critical number of people vaccinated hopefully by summer we&#39;re start to be on the trailing end of the curve. I get the human and emotional component of social distancing and why people have grown impatient with restrictions, but science doesn&#39;t care about our feelings. It only cares about warm bodies to infect and replicate itself to spread to new warm bodies. It doesn&#39;t matter what your nationality, male or female, what your politics are, whether you believe it is serious or not. Ultimately, none of our feelings or frustrations make any difference in this. The virus doesn&#39;t care. But I am optimistic that 2021 will be better off by summer.",Rexx,2020-12-25T07:51:40Z,0

"You are so right about what the Governments of the world are doing to us. Having owned my own advertising agency, which meant I basically had to become a professional researcher of facts, trends, demographics, etc, I have spent a great deal of my time, okay, nearly all of my time, researching. When I tell you this, it is not based on &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; or &quot;fake news&quot; it is based on researching every fact about the virus itself, what it really is, how it operates, the therapies and even the cures. I have gone to the writings, articles, peer reviewed medical journals, top researchers and virologists, and the world&#39;s top doctors to find out the information I am about to share. Most everyone knows Corona Virus or Covid19 is man made, it was created in a lab and even made with certain characteristics to affect certain people more violently. The virus was created for a purpose and we are all watching it play out. There are top scientists, researchers, and doctors here in the U.S. who are screaming to be heard and are being ignored. They actually have done the work and spent almost an entire year now treating thousands of patients, done many trials and tests and there is actually more than one &quot;cure&quot; for Covid19 and it is not a vaccine which has just become available here in America by two or three different Big pharmaceutical companies, but I mean real cures. This group of some of the world&#39;s top doctors, scientists, and researchers have discovered and there have even been large trials done in another country on this drug called Ivermectin (spelling may be incorrect) that is already approved here in the U.S. by the Federal FDA, Food and drug administration, to treat other illnesses but it has super antiviral properties and it absolutely prevents you from every contracting Covid19. One of these doctors actually testified in front of the U.S. Senate yesterday, and begged them to get our NHI-National Health Institute to take a serious look at their peer reviewed studies, human trials, and information on this drug. They gave the drug to 400 medical workers who treat Covid19 patients in a large hospital, and they did not give it to 400 other medical workers in the same hospital who were part of the trial. In the group that took this drug, not one contracted Covid19 despite being constantly exposed to infected patients. In the 400 medical workers who did not get the drug, 58% got Covid. And this is just one drug, there are several others that either prevent you from getting Covid, or begin to make the symptoms disappear within hours if you do get Covid. Unfortunately the Govts are not interested in this. This is all part of a big Reset plan, and destroying the Tourist industry, Restaurant industry, and the economy in general is all part of that plan. Yes, I know this all sounds conspiratorial but unfortunately it is no less the truth. The rules many of the liberal State Governors here in the U.S. are making, make absolutely no sense and they are purposely destroying their own state&#39;s economies while many of these same officials keep getting caught disobeying their own lockdown orders and communist style rules because they know these lockdowns, mask mandates, and these ridiculous rules are all nonsense, so they don&#39;t follow them in private. And the mask mandates are one of the worst rules, as they do nothing to prevent Covid19, and that is scientifically proven, Covid19 can go right through masks so they are really useless. Denmark just did a huge study on masks and proved they do not help or prevent Covid19. The only solution, though I realize in certain instances you cannot avoid compliance, but the only real solution lies in the people all over the world, and it is already happening in many countries, is to not comply as much as possible, and to begin to just say &quot;Hell No&quot; and protest. My husband and I live in the Atlanta, Georgia area of the U.S. and we almost never wear masks even to the grocery store where there is a sign on the door telling you that you must wear a mask, we simply ignore it. It is not so easy for everyone to do that I know, because some of the state Governors have become dictators making nonsensical rules with no science whatsoever behind them, and which common sense tells you are nonsense, but they will actually arrest their citizens if they do not comply. But....if we do not stand up now, they will take away more and more of our freedoms, isolate us from one another, all in a bid to control us. There is a reason that these Governments are not listening to the highly qualified scientists and doctors who are telling them lockdowns don&#39;t work, masks don&#39;t work, etc, and they are getting censored like they were in the Communist Soviet Union, or more apropos, in Communist China, because their bid to destroy the U.S. and especially the U.S. economy and become the world&#39;s superpower, is why we are all experiencing this. I have facts to back up every claim I have made, but this is turning into a book, so I will end by saying......Fight for your human, God given rights! This really is not about a virus, it is about control and compliance.",Bizzy Bee,2020-12-15T23:35:50Z,1

"I heard a scarry statistic on CBC News.  In Miami, Florida they are destroying 4 smaller (three to six deck) cruise ships per week, they will be gone forever.  They are not likely the ones where a couple goes for a week or two, but rather the 3 day Bahama cruise.  The companys are doing this because not only are they not selling travel, but these ships must pay for mooring fees, maintenance, repair and other governmental fees.  Furthure more these ships would be expensive to retrofit for cleaner safer air.  <br /><br />Too many liberal leaning governments are taking what the district medical health officers are asking for and are failing to weigh the needs of business and the non viral health risks of locking us down. <br /><br />Thankfully I live in a province in Canada that is not wealthy, few of us traveled outside of our area before COVID struck exept for work, so our numbers started low. We are a population of 650,000 pop with just a few new cases per day, currently one person hospitalized, and one death. We had weeks without any cases last summer.  Most of our cases have been related to people or a family member where a parrent works in the Alberta oil patch, or up in the Arctic and comes home one week per month. The US State of Maine is next door and they are having days with a hundred new cases that is truly scary!<br /><br />Still lockdowns are better than life with Mr. Trump downplaying COVID and laughing at people who mask up!<br /><br />Also we will be experencing a warmer winter due to lockdowns and people telecommuting to work at home thank the American Military for giving us the internet! But I digress, the loss of so many flights will permit the sun to warm our planet and climate change will be more obserbible in 2021 all because of the shutdown.",Misha LeBlanc,2020-12-09T04:09:39Z,0

"In Italy we&#39;ve had more than 50.000 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Many people who did not day, friends and family, are left with potentially lifelong complications. This is in part because the average age of the population is very high, but also in part because traditionally we hug and kiss a lot, so the virus spread sooooquickly. We&#39;re now back in lockdown because rules relaxed over the summer and came autumn we started having up to 1.000 deaths per day with a good public healthcare system.

"The reaction by governments around the globe to the current pandemic has been nothing short of criminal. Once it was understood that Covid affects only a small minority, the minority should have been protected (if they wished) and the rest should have been left to get on with their lives. The only good thing that can possibly come out of all this  is the realization that we in the free world should never, ever abrogate responsibility for our lives to idiotic and quasi-despotic governments, and that this massive over-reaction should never, ever be allowed to happen again. I spent all summer travelling in Europe and the USA, and am shortly off travelling to Africa for a month or two. To do otherwise would, in my view, be not only irrational, but also downright irresponsible. Miłej podróży..... ✌🏼",Jakartaharpman,2020-11-28T13:22:01Z,1

"First off, I love your videos, Eva.  Keep it up!  And in answer to your question, I agree that locking us all away in our homes is not the answer.  I know this won&#39;t last forever, but even to be locked away for a year has a vast impact on all of us.  Aside from the travel industry that you mentioned, it is just bad for us as individuals.  I understand why we should protect those of us that have compromised health or are elderly, but I don&#39;t think the strict lockdown should apply to most of the population.  On a side-note, your videos are helpful to so many of us that cannot or will not travel right now.  That&#39;s why I am here, so please keep doing what you are so good at.",Tony Howard,2020-11-27T01:23:09Z,0
"Eva, I enjoy your Vlogs a lot. They are well made, your narrations are always spot on and most informative, you do highlight the beauty of meeting fellow human beings across your travels in such lovely ways. I found Mongolia and Romania in particular truly fascinating, I never thought Romania was so beautiful, I just love the countryside and the people. I can assure you this, that living in my native Lebanon these days, although Lebanon is an awesomely beautiful country but currently this country is totally bankrupt, in a total mess and chaos thanks to our corrupt politicians to the point depression and sadness are gripping the majority of the people here. However I have found a great escape route from our awful predicament and that&#39;s watching your Vlogs together with those of a few other Vloggers as well, they definitely transport me to a world far more peaceful and joyful from the current drab reality of my country, so from the heart here is a big thank you from me to you for such lovely and inspiring videos, they are my daily dose of good mood. On a final note for now, I do admit that you got us worried when you were alone in such big expanses alone in Mongolia, but once again, the people there are just great. Now concerning our dear Stephan, please look after it better, it&#39;s a good car, so some more cleaning will keep it smiling for longer. Stay safe and stay blessed.",Jehad Eid,2020-11-27T00:44:40Z,0

"✨👋🏻Thank you for asking for others input about the last portion of the video. I love to travel as well and think it is so important for others to travel and experience different cultures and social structures. And I am someone who thrives when I am moving and exploring. With that said this year of isolation has been the biggest adventure of my life. it is hard to sit still but when i look within during this time and learn how I can adapt to this temporary life style for the protection of others I find new strength and new adventures with myself. I live in America and I have seen and experienced the damage it has caused on people’s livelihoods. Businesses have closed, jobs have been lost. But most of all I have seen the damage in numbers of deaths and especially within minorities who are out there still working because the lowest paying jobs are frequently essential jobs. So when I have the urge to travel I Try to look for how my actions could harm others. I consider: who am I not seeing that is being harmed? Who is unrepresented and looked over that could be effective by my Decisions? With that I would like to say I understand where you are coming from and I can see how much you love and thrive when exploring. And I ask that you consider the challenge of staying in place a bit more and seeing how your life could shift and grow when taking on that adaptation, just as you do when you experience a new culture or way of life.",Sophia Valli,2020-11-26T01:23:17Z,1

"I think that a properly implemented stay at home order and quarantine for everyone would be a good thing. This would of cause cause the economy to suffer for a couple of months, but we would the have it under control, possibly even eradicating it. I would stay at home for any length of time if it meant i could travel freely again. But people will continue to break lockdown rules and governments will continue to give ludicrous rules (bars must close at 10pm? Does that not just cause more crowds earlier on? Should we be going to bars at all?). In the UK, they&#39;ve said that all schools must be open despite other restrictions. In school there is minimal social distancing. There are frequently groups of more than 6 people together and it seems crazy that that is considered totally ok until we officially leave the site. In primary schools, THEY DON&#39;T EVEN WEAR MASKS!! Though during the couple of months we were open (no more than 6 people together but minimal other rules), I saw an anti mask protest in London. That makes me feel perfectly justified in travelling and doing whatever I want because I will never be in a crowd with THOUSANDS or people, none of whom are wearing masks, whilst chanting and holding signs that say &quot;5G reduces immunity&quot;",17andtravelling,2020-11-25T17:47:29Z,1

"The short story of my view of tourism.<br /><br />Not unlike the heroin trade of Burma or the cocaine of Peru. Sure these poor farmers need to feed their families. Nothing wrong with that. The cartels pay a living wage but their not interested in corn or beans. The problem is, should  a cash crop that hijacks your culture and feeds unhealthy addiction for corporate profit be allowed to survive? This is tourism and just maybe covid is chance for some to go thru the pain of withdrawal and find a way to feed their families that leaves their cultural identity in tact.",Jeff Demorris,2020-11-24T10:55:16Z,0

"Before covid, the World Bank estimated that half of the world&#39;s population lived on less than $5.50 a day.  Most of those people today are facing starvation as not just tourism but the whole world economy is held hostage to the fears of the affluent and the comfortable.  Locking the world down was never a viable option and it will destroy everything we value if we don&#39;t come to our senses soon.  Covid is not a hoax, but it is here and it is everywhere and we have no choice but to live with it.

"&quot;POST-SOVIET Monstrosity&quot; : The BIGZ Building - it actually is a building located in Belgrade. Designed by Dragiša Brašovan, it is one of the most representative architectural landmarks of Serbian modern architecture. A monumental building, with its position, volume and aesthetics, it dominates the entrance in the southern section of Belgrade.<br /><br />It has been protected since 1992. In recent times it represents a significant cultural, artistic and social spot.<br /><br />Construction began in June 1936. The building was finished in May 1940, but the equipment wasn&#39;t installed until February 1941. It was the first building in Serbian architecture which consistently implemented structural frame made of reinforced concrete. As the building is massive and robust, to accommodate large number of printing presses which were very large themselves at the time, it is also quite heavy. The solution for the structural load was over one meter thick plate of reinforced concrete on which the entire building rests. To ease the pressure, Brašovan designed the building in the shape of the Cyrillic letter P (П), which also was the shape of the printing press.",Pádraig Petrovic,2020-11-19T21:37:40Z,7

There&#39;s a lot of evidence to suggest that globalists are behind this and that the virus has been deliberately manufactured in a lab in order to ruin economies on purpose.

"Hi Eva, I have worked in Healthcare since the past 15 years. Covid-19 is an airborne virus. It targets the respiratory system and it shuts the entire respiratory system down. It also sits on surfaces such as our skin, hair and clothes etc. Many have it and display no symptoms but others catch it and suffer greatly and many die from it. In the US and the UK people had have to undergo lung transplants after the virus has left their bodies. A lot of industries have been affected including independent business owners all over the world. Many people have lost jobs and income and others have experienced homelessness due to this virus. If World-leaders make the decision to close all borders to countries at any given time then we have no choice but to accept this. I pray things will heal soon all over the world. In the meantime let us focus on what we can control and let us contribute to containing this damn thing  - wear a mask, wash hands when we come inside from anywhere, try to limit going outside to once a day and when we get inside we should get in a hot shower and wash our hair and skin, and soak our clothes in boiling water. Also, hold a cup of boiling water under our nose to steam out the airways etc. If we ensure it stops with us then it cannot be transmitted anywhere. This is the very least we can all do. Travel is possible but not in the commercial sense. Your are finding ways to make it work for you and this is what you are able to control as far as your life story goes - so keep doing this but also be careful about your health and social hygiene.",Layla,2020-11-17T01:09:25Z,4
"Perhaps if Serbia and Slobodan Milošević had not stuck two fingers up to the UN, the EU and NATO with the full backing of the Serbian people in 1999 when they were mass murdering the residents of Kosovo they might now be in a better position travel-wise.

The governments will continue on these paths until we as a collective use our voices!!! Life has inherent risks. What do we want? To live in fear locked in our houses because we want to be &quot;safe&quot;, or take some risks and live our lives to the fullest? I chose the latter. At 63 years of age I had this virus in March. Yes, it was uncomfortable, but no worse than a flu, and less severe than bronchitis episodes in the past. Take care of your immune system--it is amazing. Eat well, rest, exercise, gets some sun. Supplement with Vit C, Zinc, and Vitamin D in winter. Take care of you, we must be responsible for our own health and well being.

"Love your take on this. Actually most people who test positive for covid don’t even have it, as most hospitals around the world test on a treshhold cycle so high that it produces many false positives. Cov-19 has never been isolated and Dr. Drosden’s covid pcr test is based on sars 1 not sars 2 and it was sent to wuhan where a few sick people got positive results. That was all the WHO needed to declare it a pandemic. This pcr test pics up fragments from many corona viruses and with the very high threshold cycles it detects already healed infections from any of those.<br /><br />People die with covid and not of covid and there is a 28 to 30 days window from when your get a positive test and for a death to happen. Anyone who dies, regardless of what, with a positive test is put down as a covid death if it’s within this window. In the U.K. that window at first was 90 days and when they shortened it they had to ERASE 6000 covid deaths. Doesn’t that say a lot? <br /><br />Hospitals get payed many times more for admitting people with positive covid tests than without and they do many tests until they get a positive result because of this. <br /><br />We’ve done a lot of research on this and we no longer trust mainstream media and we now have to live with being called deniers and conspiracy theorists but luckily more and more people are waking up, but we also need to stand up. Power to the people! ❤️",Timezone Junkies,2020-11-16T21:54:50Z,1

As everything the subject is a complex one.  What ever you decide or do: there will be people suffering from your decision and there will be people that completely disagree.  They are not wrong and you are (basically ) not wrong.   Just don&#39;t oversimplify the pandemic like many people do in Belgium where I live.  14.000 Belgian people died from this virus.  That&#39;s on a population of a little over 10 million people.  Keep away from each other.  Respect the restrictions in your daily life.  These 14.000 people were really not just 80-and-over years old.  Not just unfortunate people that would die anyways.  Use your common sense to keep away from people that you never met before. Keep a distance.  Wash your hands.  Don&#39;t go into crowded places and don&#39;t meet people indoors you don&#39;t know.   Yes I also miss giving hugs and kisses and handshakes with friends and family.  It DOES NOT mean you should be totally isolated.  Just keep a distance and maybe talk a bit louder ;-)   If you are young you probably will survive (but that is not 100 % sure..) an infection.  But you might infect some one that will not be un-affected ...  We will survive these cruel and boring times.  We might get a financial blow. And a set back in happy events.  But we will survive.  :-)  :-)  We just have to be good for each other.  We will build up again this suffering industries. We will. We just have to wait for a little longer.,Hans Vuijst,2020-11-16T01:45:16Z,0

"Up until this year, I had been like you - constantly in motion around the world for the past four years. For me, I’ve decided to put travel on hold for the foreseeable future because of Covid. Granted, I had started to reach a point in my life where I started to want a little more stability, so the timing of the pandemic just seemed to add fuel to that fire. But there still have been many moments this year when I’ve missed that feeling of being out on the road and interacting with people from far off places. <br /><br />Like many travelers, I do feel conflicted about this. On one hand, I know travel can have such a transformative effect on someone’s life so I never want to discourage anyone from doing it if they have the chance. But on the other hand, travel right now is one of the driving factors in why this pandemic is even happening.<br /><br />I lean toward caution because I’ve had the opportunity to see a lot of the world already - much more than the average person. This point and time for me is a period of rest I guess. And I get that there are people out there who don’t feel that same way and want to travel. Again, I’m not writing to shame or discourage those people from doing so. <br /><br />Ultimately, everyone will do what they feel is best for them. There are no exact right or wrong answers in this situation - only well-educated guesses. And accepting that two things that are total opposites can be equally true can help with managing the tension that we all feel between deciding to travel or stay put during this pandemic.",Jon Santiago,2020-11-15T23:47:55Z,7

Welcome to serbia!!!!,Djordje Rasic,2020-11-15T23:35:48Z,0
"Eva, I love watching your videos. You do great work. <br />But I think I have a bit of a disagreement with your plaintiff pleas regarding the travel industry. I am trying to travel 2 months per year. It is the great thing about retirement. <br />I think that responsible travelers  decide not to travel right now. The Covid epidemic makes it unsafe. The medical risks and financial complications of getting covid in a foreign country can be life threatening. When travelling it is not possible to stay away from people and protect oneself as effectively as at home. When traveling it is necessary to take precautions not to catch covid in unfamiliar situations and  simultaneously explore the sights and cultures that one is visiting. I believe this creates experiences which are inferior to those of normal travel.<br />I believe that a broader perspective about industries lead to the following. The only thing that is constant is change! It is normal that industries need to adjust as world events cause variation in the demand for the industry. I myself have experienced industry changes 3 times which caused an end to my employment and a need to find a new way to contribute to society. In my case these changes were permanent. By contrast covid is causing intense pain in a multitude of industries but it is temporary. The latest news suggests that vaccines will be broadly available in April. This predicts a return to normal for many of those industries. I plan to spend a month in Europe in the middle of next year once I have received the vaccine. This is not magic, it is the scientifically driven medical industry.<br />You and your friends are not alone. I have relatives who are professional actors and have received zero income since March. Many of my neighbors have been unemployed from various non-entertainment businesses since March. Retired people who have limited years of travel remaining, want to travel but cannot. They adopt the philosophy that they are protecting their safety by not travelling. Owners of retail and service businesses continue to have business expenses,. but have zero or low business income.. <br />Having said all this might I suggest that creative travel bloggers/vloggers might motivate travelers with ideas to be used in 8-12 months. Those ideas might include: 1. How to travel safely, 2. Destinations for after the pandemic, 3. What to  do when you feel ill during travel, 4. The difference between  safe and less safe destinations/activities.",Greg Cosma,2020-11-15T23:25:47Z,0

"Hello hello! Booking a flight from the US to Turkey has proven to be a bit of a challenge aligning it with time off from work. I&#39;ve rescheduled a few times now and decided to wait till April, 2021. Most of us don&#39;t travel as often as you do, so it&#39;s only an annoyance rather than a show stopper.

My aunt just has died based on corona; do you really think that it is a good idea to continue travel as if no virus exists???,Gerd Papenburg,2020-11-15T21:25:45Z,0
"This comes from a place of over a million people dying. And it&#39;s not the old that are dying only and even if it were this would not justify opening up borders. Consider knowing your loved one will die alone in hospital and suffer while they do. Consider the first responders who are fighting this battle and who get the virus. While it looks like you are trying to follow the rules regarding masking, not everyone is a responsible traveller like you appear to be. However to me suggesting opening up travel is radical and irresponsible at this time. Many of my friends parents have died and I live in a country where the virus happens at a much, much lower rate than in the EU and the death rate is no where near what it is in other countries. Please consider carefully what you are saying. A job in tourism is not worth a single death. I like your blog and think you should be advocating people traveling within their own countries until the vaccine comes out. And a vaccine is coming. So sad, that you decided to take this approach!",Ctg Ctg,2020-11-16T03:17:55Z,0

"I love traveling and miss it desperately. I’m also a nurse and deal with COVID issues daily. I want to travel but right now, for most people, the cost outweighs the benefits. I think you could do isolated travel to some degree, but for me, a big part of the travel draw is meeting new people and having new experiences. The travel &amp; tourism industry will have to get creative to survive the next 2 years.",tricia denson,2020-11-15T18:48:53Z,1

"If you want to see what freedom looks like, look at us in the United States. Covid-19 is exploding right now. 100k - 150k new cases every day. Hospitals are at or exceeding capacity. Beds are not the shortage,  health care workers are as they get sick and can no longer work. We have half-hearted lockdowns in some places and no lockdowns in others. We have mandatory mask wearing in some places but in most places no. We have people who believe that the virus is dangerous and those who believe the virus is a hoax designed to make Trump look bad, that wearing masks is for fools, or that the virus is no worse than the common cold. Honestly, opinions are too varied to defeat this virus in the free world. In totalitarian Vietnam they have it contained and economic activity has remained steady with all cafes and restaurants operating normally. That doesn’t mean we in the democratic world should give up, but it means we need to hang in there until the vaccine arrives.  We need to take it seriously and practice distancing while pressuring governments to subsidize the citizens and perform critical contact tracing. We are in a war that needs a short coordinated effort to win, with six weeks of total cooperation being probably enough to wipe out this virus. The difficulty is in convincing our primitive minds that we’re actually at war with something invisible.",mlachaise,2020-11-15T17:59:48Z,0

"Eva - the &quot;pandemic&quot; is hoax -- a cover to introduce a tyrannical technocracy. PCR tests are extremely unreliable, masks are not only ineffective in preventing viruses (because viruses are small enough to go through masks) but actually harmful to you because they make you breathe in the bacteria from inside your mask (thereby increasing your risk of respiratory illness), and can cause carbon dioxide toxicity. Keeping 6 feet apart is entraining the public to enable surveillance technology to identify you. Do all these measures make sense for an illness with 99% recovery rate? . I was born behind the Iron Curtain and I am familiar with communist travel restrictions, the snitching on neighbors, the total government control over everything.

I&#39;m doing a tourism education at college called Travel&amp;Hospitality so I completely understand what you&#39;re talking about Eva. I myself as a longtime adventurer have been hit hard by the pandemic. I was supposed to go to the Island of Guernsey for my free internship (free meaning without assignments I need to work on and everything) which of course isn&#39;t gonna happen now which still bothers me at times. Just when I had the change to go abroad alone for the very first time in my live this whole thing had to happen. I was lucky enough to finish my internship last year. My whole class already stopped because they worked at a travel agency but I continued because I worked in like a store. I wasn&#39;t gonna sit home for months until after the summer vacation and I thought the folks there could use all the help. Now I&#39;ll just stay inside of the country for my free internship which I will do at like a nature reserve and which I&#39;m still looking forward to as someone who enjoys nature. I just would have felt a little bit better to go out of the country for a while. Because of all the limited possibilities now with both travel and internships abroad is why your videos always brighten up my day. I hope you will continue traveling for as long as you can.,tomurg,2020-11-15T16:10:13Z,0

But if you look back in history at the pandemics of the past, limiting contact with others has proven to be the most effective means of controlling it. Today, our travel habits make this virus spread even faster than it did in the past. And this virus has proven to be a prolific spreader, couple that with the fact that a person infected one day, can spread it globally via air travel, within a few days, before they even know they are sick, makes the situation this much worse.",Dale Bruce,2020-11-15T15:29:05Z,1

"Eva, there&#39;s so much I wish I could say to you.  Let me be straight, nothing is ever going back to the way it once was.  Evil has one goal, to steal, kill, and destroy.  The powers that be have a very precise, very well planned out agenda to bring about the most sophisticated and tyrranical system ever conceived of.  You&#39;re experiencing just the first fruits of this system, soon everyone will be required to have biosecurity/immunology passports in order to be able to travel or do anything; it&#39;ll become a part of your ID, it&#39;ll contain the information that pertains to whether or not you&#39;ve been vaccinated or whether you&#39;re up to date.  All of this is being based on masterfully crafty deception, it&#39;s never been about the virus, this is an outright takeover and enslavement of every aspect of your being, and or eugenics for a majority of the population.<br /><br />It so grieves and pains me to see and know that you&#39;ve been tested 4 times.  The test proves absolutely nothing either way, but what it does do is provide a way for your DNA to be collected, a way to seed you with nano particulates and agents to become later activated through specific frequencies, used for pharmacovigilance, for surveillance, for influence and effect on the body, and the test method itself, if done wrong, is a very good way to potentially cause a harmful physically injury.  If the test happens to be positive, then you&#39;re subject to control measures, quarantine, and contact tracing, and that includes everyone you happen to come into contact with, so they too can be tested and subjected to whatever.  <br /><br />Pray, for what has befallen our world is a nightmare from hell, pure evil!",Sky Dance,2020-11-15T15:05:40Z,3

We are still with our family, friends and groups but the &quot;social taboo&quot; makes us act as a single individual and alone, like a child discovering things.

Sometimes the romantics is in being alone, do we have a choice? One thing is for sure, the world is getting a makeover from the Covid.

"Hi 🙋🏻‍♂️ there...The pandemic will end when we become a lil selfless and distribute the vaccine 💉 throughout the world 🌎 rather than its only restricted to the rich countries. As long as, there is only one case remaining in the world, given coronavirus route of transmission via respiration, it could spring up again anywhere in the world... so therefore the world 🌎 needs a collective solution for this rather than acting selfishly!! The German firm Biontech vaccine is 90 percent effective which has the potential to stamp out this infection entirely from the face of the earth but problem is its expensive logistical requirements as keeping it at -80C is almost impossible in the developing nations...So my bet is on Chinese vaccine which is based on old tech and uses dead virus 🦠 so not only it’s manufacturing and logistics is easier and cheaper but also it could be given safely to all including immune compromised patients...so the world is actually awaiting with bated breath for the phase 3 trials results of the Chinese vaccine 💉!!!

The first time I saw one of those was ten years ago, the sign had fallen off. My travel buddy and I had no clue and had already had a dead door lock, so we kept quiet about it and used my iPod with a white background as the light for our showers.

"Your hotel was once part of the &quot;post-Soviet monstrosity&quot;. When Belgrade was smaller, that used to be one of the industrial areas, and the whole building used to be a printing mill. It has nothing to do with the communist period (and you should know that Serbia - or Yugoslavia - has never been part of the Soviet Bloc). It was built before World War II, and its architect is probably the greatest name of Yugoslav architecture. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIGZ_building"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIGZ_building</a> Welcome to Serbia, hope you have a great time here!",Dragan Draganić,2020-11-15T14:02:21Z,1
"Thanks for this correction. Its a shame „soviet“ or actually socialist architecture gets such a bad reputation everywhere. Architects from those eras put a lot of thought and consideration into their projects and many of those „monstrosities“ are actually very useful and comfortable homes, working places or places of leisure, albeight often in desperate need of renovation. Looking at the terrible shiny plastic stuff that has been built since 1990 like Beograd na vodi one would wish some ideas of socialist architecture would actually be revisited.",Schnitzel Blitz,2020-11-15T19:49:03Z,1

Now, I am just burned out from travel and it no longer seems to hold the same interest.  This is due in part to the fact that I almost died in Vietnam when I contracted Influenza B, H1N1, strep throat and bronchitis all at once.  For over a month, I was in my bed, in pain, could hardly eat or sleep.  I had no voice for a month!  H1N1 was a pandemic and I survived it.  But nothing was locked down.  I still don&#39;t understand HOW it almost went away without drastic measures.

Safe travel can happen if travelers adhere to the protocols that are in place now (masks, tests, social distancing where appropriate, sanitation measures, etc).  To close borders completely makes little sense when people do &#39;the right thing&#39;.  Problem is, people AREN&#39;T doing the right thing in many instances.

"@Leetravels countries with lockdowns have more deaths because high death rates lead to lockdowns, not vice versa. Ofc lockdowns work, thats why numbers have gone dramatically down all over Europe in Spring. However I agree that lockdowns are not the ideal measure as you cant keep them up for a long time. If people are disciplined there is no need for a lockdown, just some specific measure like limiting the number of people in a venue etc. and ofc wearing masks. There are good examples for how to do it: Japan or South Korea have had no lockdown but much lower numbers than us. They also all wear masks. Masks will not protect you 100% but they are proven to significantly lower the probabiliy of acquiring covid (or any respiratory infection, thats why doctors wear them...) and it is also probable that mask can also lead to less severe outcomes of covid because the initial virus dose is lowered. Btw Sweden is far from laissez-faire these days with covid. They dont have lockdowns but have a lot of specific measures to stop the spread of the virus.<br /><br />Now, I am not worried for myself either, I am young and healthy. The thing is not only protecting our loved ones that are elderly or had not have the luck to be healthy despite of their lifestyle. The main problem about covid is that - if you just let it spread like a regular flu - it will lead to a total overload of hospitals and emergency services. It has proven to do so in spring in italy, NYC or alsace and it is now on the way to do so in Switzerland and other countries. Once hospitals are full not only a lot more covid deaths will happen but also non-covid-deaths, young people with accidents and other emergencies will start dying in much higher numbers bc hospitals are full. <br />Btw there are clear statistics in terms of covid deaths from the first outbreak in march. Just look up excess mortality in places like Bergamo or NYC. In some places there were 5-10 times more people dying than in regular months of all causes. The reason why this didnt happen everywhere is obviously that governments and people reacted. <br />So the choice is obvious: either we wear masks, do reasonable social distancing and get tested if in doubt and wait for a vaccine for highrisk patients, even if you dont plan to take it yourself, or we will end up having lockdowns every 1-2 months till there is enough group immunity, which will happen earliest in 2022 at any reasonable rate... for me the choice is pretty obvious.",Schnitzel Blitz,2020-11-16T06:34:38Z,1
"@Schnitzel Blitz Any loss is sad news to hear so I&#39;m sorry for your loss, however lockdowns cause more harm, why do countries that do lockdown have more deaths then countries that don&#39;t do them? Our death levels in the UK this year are the same as the past 5 years. Our government is doing an rubbish job at this, I love what Sweden are doing. My body is healthy due to exercise, fresh air and living a normal life,  the virus is around the world but it&#39;s not as bad as the governments are saying. No virus will stop me from seeing my family and friends. If I wanted to wear a mask then I would become a doctor. My auntie died in March, at the time it was put down as covid. however last month we found out it wasn&#39;t down to covid. Lockdowns don&#39;t work, we don&#39;t lockdown for Swine Flu, Sars, Mers or even flu. We don&#39;t lockdown for Malaria. People of certain age need protecting however people like me who are healthy should be able to live a normal life, that is what I am going to do. and if you think most people will take this vaccine then you are wrong. some will have it, some won&#39;t. I&#39;ve not taken a test and I won&#39;t ever take a test, I have worked through the lockdown, every person I have seen since March I still see, not one person knows anyone who&#39;s had the virus. You do know from September to March it&#39;s called flu season, flu deaths have gone down while covid deaths have gone up, but it&#39;s the same level deaths as last year, like I said every death is sad news. I&#39;m worried about people who cant have there cancer treatments than covid.",Leetravels,2020-11-15T20:33:05Z,1
"@Leetravels Dont let luck fool you into thinking you or your loved ones were immune. The reason why you did not test positive is because your government actually did something about covid (even if it was too late). Im living in Switzerland, one of the richest countries in the world and the second wave of covid is bringing even our health services to the brink of collapse because ignorant fools didnt want to play by the rules. My partners uncle died last week from covid and his aunt is on a respirator. There is no easier way to slow covid spread than masks and social distancing. People like you who oppose that will be responsible for more lockdowns, more damage to travel and service industries and more deaths.",Schnitzel Blitz,2020-11-15T19:59:11Z,0
"@Mat S My goal is to visit every country, I will travel the world, however no country will stop me from travelling, I won&#39;t be taking the vaccine and currently I don&#39;t do the social distance, and I have never worn a mask, never will. My bubble of around 3000 people are all fine, not one has had this virus, not one will get it. Open the world, let&#39;s get back to normal, as I&#39;ll never change my lifestyle. and when I do travel again I&#39;ll be supporting the locals who need it. watched so many videos of travellers in the past two months, everyone in the videos are living normal lives just like I am at home.",Leetravels,2020-11-15T19:03:09Z,1
@Mat S that&#39;s the problem and that should be the debate. The PCR test has many flaws and you can manipulate the test to create false positives. First it will be covid passes then it will be covid vaccinations in order to travel.,Mohammed SOG,2020-11-15T17:48:03Z,1

The Bill Gates Foundation is a primary funder of the World Health Organisation, and Imperial College London, which is where Neil Fergusen, Chris Witty etc all crawled out from, with their death doom and destruction if we don&#39;t follow their rules, with forecasts 98% inaccurate. The United Nations has published Agenda 21, it&#39;s 350 pages if you want some light reading. That sets out the events that are happening in the world today. Those who are behind this conspiracy are a syndicate of the rich and powerful.  They own politicians, control countries. &quot;They&quot;, are the Grasshoppers, and we, are the Antz. We are their disposable cattle, and slaves. <br />Go watch Computing Forever channel. You will see the scary future...",David Webb,2020-11-15T20:37:55Z,0
"@Bernard Wechsler More people die every year from flu.<br />Explain the massive overreaction that is never ending. <br />There is no logical, scientific explanation to all this. <br />Once you have eliminated the obvious, whatever is left, no matter how much a conspiracy theory it is, must be the reason.<br />Every country follows the same fraudulent counting method. <br />The only two countries that didn&#39;t play along. Sweden, to be used as a reference. And Belarus. And strangely their leader once adored, is suddenly the target of a revolution. <br />Every past leader who didn&#39;t play along, Saddam, Ghadafi, Osama, once friends of the establishment, were terminally removed. <br />Calling someone who kills themselves by jumping under a train, (weeks after testing positive) is called a Covid death!!? Are you seriously believing this shlt?",David Webb,2020-11-15T18:16:31Z,0
I passed the border from Romania to Serbia about 2 weeks ago and you don&#39;t need a test. Also you don&#39;t need a test to get from Serbia to Romania.<br />Most people in Serbia don&#39;t wear masks. Police most of the time don&#39;t wear a mask.<br />You should have told after passing that you didn&#39;t need to get tested.,Miriam Yahushua,2020-11-15T12:26:00Z,1

I feel so bad for the travel indusry and really hope that travel can pick up soon again. I´ve tried to be responsible during this time and travel to places who want and need visitors. Thank you for sharing your journey and experiences. I was suposed to be going to Serbia two weeks ago before the restrictions in Sweden were getting tighter.,Grace on Tour,2020-11-15T12:22:39Z,21
Yes! That quality - responsibility - is super key these days when travelling. I don’t know the perfect solution but I don’t think total lockdowns are the one...,Eva zu Beck,2020-11-16T12:53:23Z,1
