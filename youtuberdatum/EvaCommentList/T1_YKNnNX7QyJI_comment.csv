Somehow you don’t see the problem with you going to an island that isn’t yours and chasing the inhabitants away. Can you imagine how scary that must be for them? Sometimes uninhabited should stay that way. Just sayin!,Life With All Of Us,2021-04-23T02:01:02Z,0

"Rats are very smart. They don&#39;t bother much with fighting other species. If they lose a couple of members of their family, they pack up the whole crew and move to a new place. They are very near-sighted and rely on their acute sense of smell when they move around looking for food. Therefore, they are naturally afraid when their territory is invaded like this. Those guys wandering around with rocks need to back off and leave the rats alone. The rats like to eat and raise their families, they don&#39;t want to fight with a bunch of humans.

"When I first came to the US as a war refugee, we were extremely poor and lived in roach infested ghetto apartments in Arlington, VA. I woke up every night screaming from the loud noises roaches made inside my ears. My poor mom, rest her soul, ran to me and poured water in my ear. I had to hold me head tilted to drown the roaches before draining them out. I also developed severe asthma requiring hospitalization. Years later, after I worked four jobs and put myself through college, I began my career as a Speech &amp; Language Pathologist...I finally got health insurance. Guess what my allergist told me? I’m deathly allergic to roaches - this, asthma! <br /><br />You’re lucky you didn’t get bitten by those rats because you never know what diseases they may carry. 🤗",Be Grateful,2021-01-05T05:26:02Z,4

"All environments have animals and realistically it was the humans invading their homes. What are rats going to do? They are walking over you, looking for your food. Keep it contained away or hung up high somewhere. It really is an irrational fear to be scared of a &quot;rat-infested island&quot;. It would have also been the first thing to do when you reach an uninhabited island to pitch a tent. I understand that is hindsight but it doesn&#39;t make sense to sleep outside and then be surprised there are animals. It looked beautiful there and I wish you could have gotten past a few rats.",ChrisMinusHumour,2020-10-01T16:36:04Z,0

Making it sound like you go through such difficult stuff but then again its all just completely normal and usual, if you live out of cities.

You didn&#39;t pack enough tents, and you didn&#39;t take the option of sleeping in the boat or sharing one of the other tents. Hmm. Also, it&#39;s not a pristine island if its infested with rats unless they are native species. It might look pristine, but it&#39;s an ecosystem thrown off by humans who probably brought the rats there inadvertently as stowaways.",Author AnnaLowe,2020-07-23T18:21:29Z,0

"I think it was because she was the only female and the tents probably would have been shared (2 - 3 in one) since there was a shortage, so in the culture - it&#39;s not very appropriate for a man and a woman who are not married to sleep in the same small space. Plus, she might of preferred sleeping outside by herself instead of having to share a tent with another man. There could&#39;ve been many reasons.

"Next time you go to Darsa. Here is simple solution for them rats. You go to market in Yemen and buy some Horned viper (Cerastes cerastes in Latin) Maybe 3-4 of them. And release them in the beach where you will sleep. In 1-2 days, they will eat almost all the rats population in that area. You can also use Naja Haje (Egyptian Cobra) but that animal is pretty big and pretty aggressive. I doubt you wanna have 3-4 of those in your boat.",bambang303378,2020-07-07T02:17:15Z,0

"Ever heard of cat island near japan or rabbit island? Well the story goes that there was lab testing done in these islands and they needed animals to experiment on, this was during WW2. When it was over, They left the island but the rabbits and cats remained and now 2 islands heavily inhabited with rabbits and another with cats. No rat problem anymore in cat island. I say we do the same here. My Yemeni brothers should bring 10 strong and able cats. 6 female cats 4 males. Soon the rat problem will be solved.",Jamilah Obaiyah,2020-06-15T23:33:23Z,0

"​@An Atheist  I&#39;m not sure responding will be of any use but I&#39;ll give it one try.  There was a reason that I highlighted that one comment,  I wanted to speak to that idea specifically.  The idea that we should just let the mistakes of the past be and take no responsibility worries me.  I am not saying that you think that nor am I making any comment on what you think I am simply pointing out that Deadpoppin an then you after, started your comment with an incorrect assumption.  You are correct in pointing out that I did not specifically say that the use of cats is a bad idea but to that point I did not speak of poison or the use of a nuke.  I would have hoped that if someone were to read my comment in full they may notice that I took the time to point out that the impact on native species is an important consideration.  This would at least in my mind rule out the use of things worse than rats to get rid of the rats but I&#39;m just a stupid person on the internet so who knows.  I get that this reply is long but honestly at this point it&#39;s more for me than anything, a personal reminder of sorts.   If any poor soul should decide to read this I would suggest that you make sure to read things in their entirety and take Jonathan Johansson&#39;s lead by injecting information and polite discourse into the conversation or maybe just don&#39;t say anything.",Monkeyrancher,2020-08-04T23:36:09Z,1

Most likely the rats kill the younglings of the birds and does not have any natural enemy on the island.

"Dear Eva, I really appreciate how positive you portray Muslim countries, but as a Muslim myself I would recommend to you to dress more modest in front of Muslim men Bec although they would not admit it can make them feel uncomfortable as they are commanded in the Quran to lower their gaze and if someone is dressed in shorts that makes it much harder for men.
