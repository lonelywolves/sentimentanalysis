"Dear Eva, you make beautiful travel videos and beautifully show parts of the world we ourselfs likely will never see! I would like to mention that I feel it is unfortunate how you started the video about music, singing, clapping or dancing (in public). This is not the reason why Taliban is considered extreme! They are considered extreme for the takfir they make, the killing and bombing of innocent people! For murder! As for music this is considered haraam in islaam by consensus of all major scholars in Islam! And so is dancing for men or for women in public, but she can dance for her husband if no music is involved. I would wish you would read up on the islamic religion as you have been visitting our countries and you are most welcome to do so but please do respect our religion. The issue with Taliban is not the little good they do but the great evils they do! May Allah guide you and keep you safe.",جمال الدين الهولندي,2021-04-16T02:09:54Z,0

"As an Afghan citizen who lived in Afghanistan as well as outside,  i really like your courage bravery to take the risk and visit my mother land and be able to give your own opinions as well as your videos but I have realized one thing which is very different and brings out many questions as a viewer and that is ( why did you choose to stay with one family of Hazara community) we have so much that you could discover in kabul or other save cities without being always indoor behind close doors and listen to Iranian music not an afghan music or having a proper afghan food and knowing afghans for who they are.  I could provide you many links of government and nun government groups that they help journalist as well as those who are willing to make a documentary and vlogs in Afghanistan.  I am disappointed that have missed so much cuz based on your intel and click you had very limited access to other things and you only filmed one ethnic group of Afghanistan and not others . So please next time try to be different I am glad to help you even tho I live in Canada but I am willing to help you get the best vlog for your video and a true reality.",Toronto Canada,2021-04-13T02:36:40Z,0

"It&#39;s nice and all, but women&#39;s rights in Afghanistan is the worst in the world. Literally. Can you imagine being the king of the world of having the worst women&#39;s rights out of 195 countries? Aside of human rights and many other things that is wrong in Afghanistan. Not to forget the Bacha Bazi, or culturally men who fuss over dancing children to take home and then make love to. Anyway. Not my cup of tea. The country does have beautiful areas, and it is something to see, like Nuristan, Wakhan and Bamiyan area. Certainly beautiful. However, it&#39;s a country that misses many beauties and other forms of beauties. It is 1/3rd desert and another 50% extremely dry/barren. The other remaining 17% is the rest of the country, with only 2% forests (in Nuristan area). It doesn&#39;t have high biodiversity or many other forms of spectacular nature. no incredible sea scape sceneries, no forests almost, no islands, poor architectures, culture is simple. Food is lovely, but also comparably simple. Most Afghans eat max 10 dishes 98% times of their life. It&#39;s always Mantu, Kabuli Palao, Some spinach, Shola (or something), and some other things. I love it, but it&#39;s not anywhere close to incredible cuisines that each have hundreds of dishes that are wonderful in taste. All in all a beautiful country for what it is. One day when it&#39;s safe again I would love to see the areas I mentioned.",Alfsen_,2021-04-12T12:23:09Z,1

"Hi<br />Just want to add to your info that you say Taliban banned that fire party or something like that.we Afghans are muslims and we worship to Allah(God).That dancing around fire is a religion called Zardashti  in Iran.They pray and worship to fire as their God , which is still practiced in Iran.<br />That is the reason Taliban banned this type of worship.Your hosts are  Hazara tribe of Afghanistan which are Shia not Sunni religion as the rest of afghans,so they are influenced and are paid by neighbour country Iran to promote their culture and religion in Afghanistan.During the civil war in 1992 they committed war crimes such as cutting women breast,nailing on live human head,deadman’s dancing and a lot more.These Hazara people don’t want to talk about the war crimes they committed to Sunni people of Afghanistan.",Afghanistan music,2021-04-12T01:48:18Z,0

Chanharshanbe soori is new phenomenon in bamiyan. The Nawroz has been celebrated even before Persians landed in Iran. People of Afghanistan was Buddhist and TENGRISM not zaorist.

"She can go to the north, to the central parts, to the west and  Kabul which is all Tajik, Hazara and Uzbek areas. Those people will welcome her, they will receive her well and she can have a normal time there. But she cannot go to the south which is Pashtun Taliban area. Being a woman, a Westerner and a non-Muslim is enough for them to hurt her  really badly, let alone going there listening to music and partying. It totally goes against the Pashtun backward and tribal culture where  the man is totally in charge and woman is like a piece of meat that belongs to man. So far Taliban are merely enforcing the tribal and cultural values of Pashtuns on their tribal  people. They are fighting a war to enforce their tribal  values throughout the country and on other ethnic groups. I’m sure she has been advised strongly by the ppl to not even think about going to the south and she knows it well. I hope she talks about these things to bring an awareness to the people of the world about the mindset of different groups of people in Afghanistan as well.",Kourosh587,2021-04-11T08:23:42Z,0

"Taliban are the reality of Afghanistan. They are not some aliens that you try to project to your viewers but Afghans, our brethren more importantly real Afghans whose being fighting for the culture honour &amp; sovereignty of their nation. Taliban didn’t killed our women. Taliban did not killed our mother, Taliban didn’t attacked our homes. Taliban did not drop bombs on us from air! On the contrary it’s your race’s people who did! Even during the time of Taliban women had parties in Kabul such as wedding ceremonies, engagement or newborn celebration on 7th day where singing folklore songs dancing &amp; clapping was common. It was during Taliban time that women felt safe in their homes &amp; outside prior to that there were lots of rapes &amp; forced marriages practiced by warlords. Taliban punished those! With the arrival of Taliban government men &amp; women could breathe air of comfort &amp; peace. I respect ✊ you but don’t spread propaganda about Taliban whether it’s deliberate, for YouTube views or unintentional. You’re an educated western women , you must state facts accurately not like this in the video otherwise it sends a clear message to common Afghans  then we Afghans are forced see you as engineered US &amp; western propaganda mechanism.",james lopes,2021-04-11T06:49:45Z,1

"Hello Eva Zu Beck:<br /><br />1) You said music is forbidden in Afghanistan. That&#39;s right, music is forbidden in Islam.<br /><br />2) You said signing and dancing are prohibited. Debatable. Need second opinion from Muslim teachers.<br /><br />3) You said clapping is immoral. That&#39;s incorrect. Clapping is allowed for women, but Muslim men are discouraged from it. Instead, Muslim men are encouraged to say MashaAllah or SubhanAllah.<br /><br />4) You said extremist group Taliban need little introduction. That&#39;s incorrect. Taliban need a lot of introduction, but not from CNN or Foxnews. For another look at the Taliban/ al-Qaeda/ 9-11 attacks in US, read Afghanistan: Genesis of a final crusade, written by Abidullah Jan.<br /><br />5) Find out what role will be played by Khorasan (which is mostly in Afghanistan, and partly in Iran and Pakistan), during and after the arrival of the anti-Christ and second coming of Jesus Christ (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him).<br /><br />I like your videos, I have watched several of them.",Shaikh Faiz,2021-04-11T05:23:09Z,0

I have been working a lot of places in Afghanistan with different tribes., from Badakhshan to Herat etc. I have a lot respects different tribes and cultures in my country, unfortunately around 300-400 Fascists from Pashtoon tribe is the root cause of all these unfortunate situations in our country, I have a very good relations with Pashtoon people working together for many years, I found them very good people, I have seen their weak points, they get easily deceived by their Mullahs and some racist selfish people among them, these two types of cancers badly hurting our Pashtoon People.<br />You mentioned the names of some parts of Afghanistan which safe too, I am not agree with you if you remember what happened to the girls at Kapisa Provice sometimes back and what’s happening in Mazaar and Kunduz nowadays, such crimes never happened in Hazarajat and will never happen there.

"@rajab ali Bolagak, Read again and again what I wrote and try to understand what I said. I did not pass any kind of judgments on Hazaras , I merely asked you a question. Let me elaborate on what I said, I totally agree that Hazaras are  humble and peaceful people, not only Gull  but even that Tajik Kabuli girl who is accompanying her,  is  totally safe and secure in Hazara area. Your initial comment was secluding Hazaras,  what I was pointing at, Is that if she travels to Tajik areas in Mazar-e-Sharif, Panjshir, Badakhshan and Herat or Uzbek areas of Shiberghan, She’ll be just as safe as she is in Hazara areas. But in the dangerous southern Pashtun  Taliban areas,  it is a no go zone for her. Now tell me if I said something wrong or if I offended you then I’ll apologize for it, but you calling me names without understanding what I said Bola Jan, not fair.",Kourosh587,2021-04-11T09:52:00Z,1

Soon by the help of Mr. Joe Biden we will have Federalism Government System and we will have independent and safe states in Afghanistan except Pashtun/Pathan areas.<br />BTW you are currently in Hazaristan the Homeland of Hazara Türks of Afghanistan and you are all safe but try to have flights while going from one province to other because in many provinces of Afghanistan pashtuns are living and they can kidnap you or even kill you.,Shafiq,2021-04-10T17:13:18Z,1

"@Farzana Persian simply means Farsi here. Afghan is a misnomer and wrong name for a citizen  of my country,  In the past 20 years the most challenging issue for the parliament of Afghanistan, was whether to  include the term “Afghan” on the national identity or not. It was brought to a general vote by all parliamentarians twice, and both times the majority of them voted against the inclusion of Afghan on the national identity in Afghanistan. This issue is documented and historical, anyone can find it online. Different ethnic groups in Afghanistan prefer to themselves and take pride in their respective   ethnic identities such as Tajik, Uzbek, Hazara, Pashtun, and others, rather than the Afghan identity. As far as the Tajiks  in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan, They have a common heritage, history, language and culture with the Persians, After all Tajiks are the descendants of the two important Iranian groups, Bactrian and Sogdian. Kurds are  also an Iranic group racially and linguistically. All Iranic groups celebrate Nowroz. <br />I guess you missed a point in my previous comment that Nowroz is registered with united nations as the Persian new year, and it is known worldwide, outside of the Persian/Dari/Tajiki speaking world, as Persian new year, it is not something that I’m claiming or spreading but it is as such. It is actually you who’s going against the all the odds, all the power to you to go change it in the United Nations and in the public opinions everywhere in the world.  Just listen to the messages of Justin Trudeau and Barack Obama congratulating Persian New Year....you can find it on YouTube.",Kourosh587,2021-04-11T16:59:25Z,0
"@Kourosh587 No, not all farsi speaking people are persian. They are Afghan, Tajik, etc. Nawroz is also celebrated by Kurds and they don’t speak Farsi. Please don’t spread misinformation.",Farzana,2021-04-11T16:24:49Z,0
"By Persian it implies to all Farsi speaking people, whether in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan or Iran. The Tajik Farsi Dari speaking people of Mazar i Sharif, are also part of the Persian speaking family of greater ancient Iran. United Nation Organization registered Nowroz as  a Persian heritage and new year. Balkh my native homeland, was the birthplace of Nowroz as well as the birthplace of the greatest Persian poet,  Maulana Jalaluddin Balkhi Known in the west as Rumi.",Kourosh587,2021-04-11T09:30:46Z,0

@Kharmencita Brueckner Why? Saudi exported wahahbism and US/Pakistan&#39;s foreign policy,TA 72,2021-04-12T08:27:18Z,0
"@Abdur Rahman Khan  The Taliban are brainwashed by the wahhabi schools and are the main reason why Afghanistan is destabilized right now. The US actually supported those terrorists during the &#39;80s in order to defeat the Soviet Union. The CIA funded textbooks that radicalized young Afghans in their schools, and obviously Pakistan trained and harbored the Taliban so they could gain political influence in Afghanistan. <br /><br />This has nothing to do with the west trying to take their religion away; they were actually trying to radicalize Afghans when it was convenient. The Saudi-funded wahhabi schools are what is indoctrinating Pashtuns in Afghanistan and Pakistan, not the US.",TA 72,2021-04-12T08:14:34Z,0

They thought they could change what is written anyway, unaware that they had been deceived by the Devil. <br /><br />Watch the movie War Dogs and you will get the idea how they sent the weapons down to Afghanistan, the numbers of AK-45 and the bullets alone are enough for 20 years war.",Hazel Reannez,2021-04-14T00:04:00Z,1

"@Kourosh587 She is a vlogger, researcher, TedTalk speaker , traveler, story teller, adventurous, female,enthusiastic , independent, fearless and everything. She doesn’t make videos only about Nawruz or something specific, she makes videos about everything. In addition, it’s good to know what is going on with the life people who lives on other parts of the country. Since she is a female, in may ways she would get warmth respect from everyone, everywhere, and easily talk to people of other region without fear.Peace out ✌🏻",Rafi Sadiq,2021-04-11T11:41:34Z,0
"I don’t know if you’re trying to be sarcastic or you are  for real, but in the south they don’t know Nowroz or Charshanba-Souri. On top of that the south is the most violent  part of the country because it is the home land of Taliban. Just because she’s a woman a westerner and a non-Muslim is enough to endanger her life let alone  to go and party and listen to music, which is  totally banned by Taliban.",Kourosh587,2021-04-11T08:40:15Z,0

"@FlyHigh_Mamba listen, i dont contradict that they feel afghan or are afghan. What they celebrating is just not an afghan tradition my friend.  <br />I will give u a simple example, i am in holland, born here, i do ramadan. Ramadan is NOT a dutch tradition.",Noah Casa,2021-04-10T18:15:07Z,0

"@Soel Joeles are u dumb or are u dumb. U uself saying its persian culture, this is celebrated by persians. And has nothing to do with local afghan customs, its brought in; 400/500/600 even if its 1000 years, still not afghan, <br />And yes different religion i think u are the dumb one here. They are sjiah and afghans are sunni. Once again ur contradicting urself, who claims its the same? U? Who are u? Sunni’s dont consider shia’s to be muslims. They have pagan holidays like exactly this one.",Noah Casa,2021-04-10T17:32:33Z,0

@ahmed nabeel they dare try to take away our ethnic identities. Chaudary Rehmat Ali ne watan ka naam hi suboh ki bana par rakha tha. Aur Muhajir logo se mujhe koi masla nahi hai apne bhai bhain hai magar kuch ko pata nahi kya keera hota hai.,Doge of Greatness,2021-04-12T09:47:26Z,0

"Are you willing to loose your Punjabi,Sindhi,Balochi language and identity? Let me guess Urdu speaking Muhajir? Don&#39;t forget what Pakistan stands for. The P for Punjab,A for Afghania(KPK),K for Kashmir(Azad and GB), S for Sindh and tan for Balochistan. Don&#39;t ever forget this. Provincialism and Separatism is the problem.
