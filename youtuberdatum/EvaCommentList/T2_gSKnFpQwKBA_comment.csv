@Yasmina RAYA Republika Kosovo je nezavisna drzava i tacka. Nema nista sa Svrbijom. Srbija je genocidna drzava. Srbia je pocinila genocid u Bosni i na Kosovu. Ratovala sa Hrvatskom. Sad sa Crnom Goru se svadja scaki dan. To znaci svrbija je najlosa na ballkanu pa i u evropi.,Brahim Sopa,2021-03-18T20:09:57Z,0

A lot of things to see there but also a lot of progress. <br />As for this one on the Bosniak tradition in Kosova, I am a Bosniak from Bosnia and it is so nice to see a lost tradition that our people preserve it elsewhere beyond the borders of our homeland.

No this is Illyrian-Albanian tradition and you have nothing to do with them cuz you are assimilated to slavs and speak a russian dialect. The pagan symbols shown here have still meaning in today&#39;s Albanians and we use them still to this day.,Illyriaanmbret,2021-01-10T15:49:02Z,0

"Kosovar as nation   dont exist. It would means that you call all nations on Kosovo and Metohia  as Kosovars. If it would be able  than and can call all Albanians  as Serbs. It would be same . Assimilation is not <a href=""http://option.you/"">option.You</a> actualy  made assimilation if you call others nations who live on Kosovo and Methoia as Kosovars. Kosovars dont exist.  In Serbia citizens  who comes from other countries we call citizens  of Serbia if they have our passport.We dont call them  Serbs.I will take as example citizen of country i love a lot,Mexico.Mexican is citizen of Serbia who is born in Mexico(if have our passport),he is not Serbian(except is if he declared hiself  by own will,by own freedom). One detail abour Albania....about 1980. years there was a low because Serbian, Janko Jankovic for example, was forced by low , to change name  to some albanian name  and nickname. He was forces to change and religion. It can be easy chacked.",Luka Luka,2021-01-01T06:24:16Z,0
"Sorry ,i must desspaoint you. ,,Kosovo,, dont have own tradition. There lives lot different nations. This is  tradition  in one of  vilages on Kosovo and Methia,serbian autonomn  area. For your information, in every part of Serbia  exist lot differences  in day of wedding. It is same and betwen albanian vilages anywhere. More once to say,,,kosovo dont exist,, so and tradition of ,,kosovo,, dont exist. Reason why i am writing this...there is lot yang people....everyone trust what see or hear without some siriouse analises. And more something , burek is not albanian national food......burek , with same name exist in Serbia,Montenegro, Croatia,Bosnia and Hercegovina,the most % , burek is turkish food. I know it is nice when you have ,space shatle for example,but i dont have it. Even here,in central Serbia,every village have own tradition in wedding. Reason for this is simple. Before 100 years and less comunities was almoust closed,every comunity had saint obligation to save own tradition. It is same  and today, for example,bride, when come in house to live with her husbend learn  about tradion of that family,connected with tradition of comunity. For your information,only between Serbs, exist 50 different tradition from place to place. When i see this video, moybe i  decide to make own channel here, to show  to peoples all diffrences serbian people  and stop thiefs of culture of others peoples to show it as own. On this video is probably tradition of one village people who call self <del>Goranci</del> .They speak serbian language ,but they are not ortodox christians.",Luka Luka,2021-01-01T05:53:33Z,0

"Since it says &#39;south&#39; I am pretty certain this is the Dragaš region (Драгаш). The Slavophonic people tend to be Muslim and the majority of Slavs identify as Gorani in that territory. That&#39;s not to say none declare themselves Bosniak but there is some confusion here. When one is a Goran then he is native to the tripoint: Kosovo/Serbia; Macedonia; Albania. A Bosniak may have resettled at some stage from Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro or elsewhere in Serbia. The old lady (stara baka) speaks the regional combination of Serbo-Croat and Macedonian which shows she is of local extraction. I&#39;d say this is the Gorani community.",Stefan Veleski,2020-12-27T23:19:56Z,0
So I think the village called Manastirica city of Prizren . And the villages over city Dragash there are mostlly Gorani community and they language are very different and tradition too but not painting like this.,baba mokx,2020-12-29T20:38:42Z,1
@baba mokx Thanks. Did she give the exact location? Gorani are mostly at Kosovo&#39;s southernmost tip and panhandle between Macedonia and Albania. But some do declare Bosniak...,Stefan Veleski,2020-12-28T22:52:00Z,1
"The province of Zhupa podgora part of PrizrenThe village Manastirica they are not Gorani . About the language thats true its a mix of Macedonia, Serbia, Some words Turkish and Albanian.",baba mokx,2020-12-28T22:11:42Z,0

So what? <br /><br />As I wrote in my other comment, both ethnicities do this. <br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />It is not a specific bosnian outfit. <br />Albanians also wear this aswell as some macedonians/bulgars*(I have heard that they have something similar to it).<br /><br />Only because u didnt know about it doesnt mean it aint Albanian. Many dont know about it because it is something special in that region. And its rare in general.",Albin H.,2020-12-28T21:21:17Z,0

It is of the bosnian community living in Kosovo. Not Albanian. Never read or heard or been told about this tradition if it belongs to Albanian community also.
