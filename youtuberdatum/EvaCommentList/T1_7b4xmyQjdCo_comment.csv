"Visiting Saudi Arabia as an independent traveller was one of the most interesting travel experiences of my life! Check out my Saudi posts on Instagram if you want to hear my views on “political” travel. At the end of this series, I’ll be sharing a video which talks about that specifically. For now, hope you find the following vlogs interesting!",Eva zu Beck,2020-01-26T02:46:55Z,196

"As a naturalized American who was born and raised in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 1952 thru 1968 and then working in the Kingdom now and then during the 80’s and 90’s, I agree that the warm and honest hospitality is second to none in our world.  It’s unfortunate that what most westerners know and believe about Saudi Arabia and its people is so one sided and inaccurate.<br />It was very cool to see the camping scenes in Eva’s video’s.  As a kid my family did our share of camping both on the east coast  along the Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea along the west coast, great memories.",Jeff Minor,2020-09-07T00:45:33Z,1

It is the kind of country where you can leave your car running in the winter to warm up while having breakfast at home without worrying about anyone stealing your car. I could leave my phone and wallet in resturants to go wash my hands with out having to worry about them going missing.<br /><br />I really miss it, I made some great friends there, both Saudi and non Saudi.

"Not requiring an abaya is a new experience in KSA (Kingdom of Saudi Arabia) something that has changed in the last 2 years. In the past it was that way, and it has returned again. At one time nearly all Saudi women wore black abayas.

But one thing that I don&#39;t get why this countries people have to show hospitality and generosity to prove that they are not the people that the western media shows. Is western countries people do the same when they see someone from middle-east or a Muslim.

"We don’t need to to prove anything to anyone, it’s just who we are. Each society has its own values; in the Arabian Peninsula (aka Saudi Arabia) for thousands of years food had been scarce and water sources are limited. Therefore providing for your guests and feeding them has always been a moral obligation and an ethical standard for nobility and honor.

I lived there 1994-99 at KFUPM Dhahran. If you get the chance to visit the Iris Fields of Tumair north of Riyadh - go. They are old agricultural fields where grow iris in huge drifts which with the right rains all bloom in one hour on (I think 20 March or thereabouts). It is spectacular to see only green then on one hour the whole field is in bloom purple. Additionally visit Thumamah where you can see the valley Wadi Howtat Bani Tamiim where gazelles and ibex roam in a huge reserve.,Jeremy Stocks,2020-01-30T19:30:50Z,0

i definitely do not believe the 30 second disclaimer at the start<br />all of a sudden tons of youtubers and influencer are going to saudi arabia (a place that they probably have no interest in ) and are all possibly telling us that the trip hasnt been endorsed <br />very hard to believe<br />saudi arabia are smart and know what they are doing nonethless<br />oil is running out and they need more exposure on their new tourism,H Z,2020-01-30T00:32:13Z,3

"So much restriction on women &amp;  Late King Abdullah had as much as 30 official wives. No woman can ever think of keeping two husbands together.  At last Prince Mohammed Bin Salman has initiated some changes in social life of Saudi people. I think Religion is associated with morals, ethics and sensibility towards fellow human beings. More freedom should be given to women who have given birth to men. I have heard a saying like this that a woman is never free in her life. A father is gauardian of a girl untill marriage then her husband becmes her master till he dies and then her sons become  master till she dies. A woman is never free in her life. Although men are dominant through out all cultures but it is extreme in Islamic Societies.",SAHIL KHAN OFFICIAL AGENCY,2020-01-29T07:47:29Z,0

"I am so happy that you are posting videos like this both you and more people anyone should post more like this. Obviously everyone should havecommon sense and be aware of their surroundings and protect themselves but people need to not be so paranoid of the world and realize everything that&#39;s going on.for example when I went to Japan and backpack for 3 months by myself walking everyday by myself using couchsurfing and meet up to go everywhere and anywhere from Hokkaido to Tokyo to Hiroshima to Kyushu and everyone in Maine and California and everywhere in between thought I was going to get kidnapped or it&#39;s not that bad things were going to happen just because I was leaving America everyone thought going to go visit somewhere in backpack was a bad idea and the worst thing I could do but was actually the best thing I&#39;ve ever done in my life and it was so fun and everyone was so nice I did not pay a cent for hotel my entire 3-month stay in <a href=""http://japan.plus/"">Japan.plus</a> the fact that you&#39;re staying with locals and they are so kind to take you in and want to learn about your country they can give you the local tour and you can actually learn really about that culture not just tourist sites. I even met a world backpacker named Luluand he educated me on what country is not to go and what countries to go to the ones I wanted to go like Egypt and a few others he said not to because of dangers even though some spots are safe it&#39;s still not 100% safe even near the pyramids and tours and he was telling me places that are safe and cool or Iran Oman Saudi Arabia and he was telling me how hospitable all the people are the people love visitors they love visitors they love to care and help a traveler. Too many cultures were very cultural spiritual just since times in the beginning wanderers travelers are considered people of unfortunate or lost souls or wanderers living for purposethey are searching for and because of that kindness is always given to them from the people who have homes.and the thought is the same today the only difference is today instead of only lost souls people also travel to learn cultures to take photos for jobs for a spark of entertainment too for knowledge so onso when I see people like you posting this say how it&#39;s good and safe it is just use common sense on couchsurfing verified people are the best it&#39;s a person is not verified it&#39;s your own 50-50 chance but it is completely safe especially if the person is verified. I also stayed in Sweden for 2 months using couchsurfing and I actually happened to stay at the very same person&#39;s house a full two months in Japan it was not like that I went to a different person&#39;s house every two to four days for 3 months.it&#39;s a safe modern cheap way for someone to have an adventure someone who needs it someone who just wants to do it for fun or even someone who thinks maybe they can find a life somewhere else and needs to find that place.",SkuldXHimura,2020-01-27T19:47:02Z,0

"I am surprised to see, that your host is not wearing a hijab or anything. I had the impression that it was a very strict law that all local women had to wear that in public. Could you tell us a little bit more about this?",Line H,2020-01-25T20:57:18Z,1
"@Laith A. Thank for your reply!  <br />I heard about the change in rules, but just curious that It happend that &quot;fast&quot; and if theres still some cultural rules about it. We see this in other areas of the world, where it is not government law, but social and that people in society are being &quot;police&quot; for each other. Like, when you find videos on youtube of a woman that choose to no wear hijab, and random men yell of her on the street to wear it, and even hit her..  Other places in the world, we see people attacking those who choose to wear hijab because its not mainstream and so... <br /><br />Does this kind of things occur after the more loose rules? or does the majority accept it and let everyone choose what they prefer? Sry. Just curious :D",Line H,2020-02-17T20:33:22Z,0

"Idk what some people mean, the woman in the video looks very Saudi lol. To answer your question, there used to be strict laws for that stuff a while ago, they slowly relaxed laws to allow women not to cover their hair years ago. Some years after that, women just had to wear their abaya over themselves, but could have it open. Last year the abaya as a whole was no longer required. I was actually in Riyadh a month ago and most people still cover, but i saw for example a saudi woman pianist dressed in a suite playing piano in public, with a short cut hair. There were a number of locals and non-locals who didn’t cover or wear an abaya, but doing so is a symbol of respect and modesty, so it’s still a very common thing. You can wear what you want there, just not revealing, tight clothing or shorts",Laith A.,2020-02-01T08:27:46Z,1

Also no one ask you to come to SA or force you to love it , We have over ten millions foreigners living with us in peace and harmony. Our hospitality with tourists has nothing to do with the government, it&#39;s our culture. By the way, Our life is much way better than yours and you are just a consumers in your capitalist countries, that why we love our government and the king and we don&#39;t care about your opinion about them.",Ahmad Altasan,2020-01-26T18:01:10Z,1
moser bear Yeah that’s kind of what I thought. I would probably never ever go over there unless it was some type of a contract job through work or something but never to live permanently. And I wouldn’t go over there as a woman single ever. It scares the hell out of me to be honest with you. I realize every country has its good spots and there’s probably some beautiful places there but the cultures are just too different.
