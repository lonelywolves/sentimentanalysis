"Hi Eva i had no oppurtunity to explore the country beyond Makkah, Madina and Taif probably my visa was restricted. I think from now on i will try to explore. However i do know the history and culture of Saudi Arabia through reading novels and the books of the traditions of Prophet Muhammad and of course The Qur&#39;an. A book &quot;Road to Mecca&quot; written by Muhammad Asad describes a lot of detailed history and culture of the contry. I like your travel videos.

It&#39;s probably only a Fairy-tale place for any tourists like you. I bet that in many other places within that country where woman could be beaten for many reasons. Oh it such a lovely time then because any negative opinion of women&#39;s beatings in countries like these is Islamophobic. Maybe this place isn&#39;t as strict but other places of Saudi Arabia are unforgiving especially the beheading.,Lorcan Mcdonna,2021-04-18T11:20:39Z,0

Saudis Arabia still has major issues with human rights. Remember it is illegal to have a different sexual orientation punishable by death. Barbaric   Remember too that by law until 2019 women had to have a male guardian and have their permission for so many things.

"Just a tiny bit of information they probably don’t like to mention why this area as well as a few other areas in southern Saudi Arabia look this way and have this type of architecture which is similar if not pretty much the same as those we see in Yemen is because this land was a Yemeni land but previous president Ali Abdulla Saleh “gifted” (forcefully) the land to KSA.. that’s why you will see the way people dress, speak and live, very similar to Yemeni people.<br /><br />Love your videos and this one is very special ♥️",rasha saillan,2021-03-06T15:46:39Z,0

"TRUE LIFE STORY<br /><br />Hi My name is &quot;Carl I am from USA I was married for years. until things started getting ugly and we had fights and arguments almost every time... it got worse at a point that he filed for divorce... I tried my best to make him change his mind &amp; stay with me. he moved out of the house and still went ahead to file for divorce... I pleaded and tried everything but still nothing worked. The breakthrough came when someone introduced me to this wonderful, great spell caster who eventually helped me out... I have never been a fan of things like this but just decided to try reluctantly cause I was desperate and left with no choice... This great baba mukuru  did special prayers and other things he had to do... Within 2days my husband called me and was sorry for all the emotional trauma he had cost me, he moved back to the house and we continue to live happily. what a wonderful miracle baba mukuru  and the faith I had in him did for me and my family. I have introduced him to a lot of couples with problems across the world and they have had good news... I strongly believe someone out there need&#39;s his help. so make extra effort to save your marriage/relationship if it&#39;s truly worth it.  contact him Via email on (peterelis44@gmail.com).<br />you can contact him via..+2348074335465",Gonzalo Muller,2020-11-02T02:21:53Z,0

This video is supported and sponsored by the Saudi government. They’re trying so desperately to change the worlds view of them after the publicity from the horrific slaughter of that poor journalist. I wonder where in this theme park they keep the square where they behead and crucify protestors? Most all of the freedoms that are taken for granted as “rights” here in the states would get you executed in Saudi Arabia.

Hey Eva! I really love watching your videos. One thing came to my mind hearing you said similarity of the architecture with Yemen. There is a ancient town called &quot;Marib&quot; in Yemen where you can find the root of theses architecture. Marib is  thousands of year old and full with history.  I would like to request you to visit there and make a stunning vlog like you do everytime! Wish you all the best!,AccessDenied,2020-09-10T03:31:01Z,1

Even more so when I see women being allowed to run through the villages without hijab. I  am pleased to have seen this charming village. Thank you.

What&#39;s happens if the barrier have been broken such as happened in area51? <br /><br />Almasihi dajjal laknatullah have share with Allah SWT said unseen creatures. Surah AlKahfi have explained everything.  The proof is clearly waiting for Allah SWT action. No answer for how many words of Surah AlQasas verse 38. In AlQuran mentioned mankind need rest or sleep. Poking blogger not to sleep. Unjustice as a mankind. <br /><br />One thing that for sure any religious does not teach us to harm ourselves especially ISLAM. IMAN first or solat (prays) first? Solat without IMAN? Every says in our heart shall be questioned by Allah SWT. Be witneses because there is certain words been hidden. Be witneses that the wrath of Allah SWT is worship than Him which the worship (other than Allah) unseen creatures worst than the  sperms of disbeliever (mankind). What that unseen creatures learnt the message of Allah SWT?  Still wanted to be acting God. Qualified &amp;fit for you? <br /><br />Illuminati Freemasons <br /><br />Siapakah gerangan Unseen creatures menentang AlQuran dan sunnah Baginda SAW hingga tidak dapat tunaikan hak sesama manusia terutama hak diri sendiri secara ikhlas.Adakah dengan melakukan syirik kepada Allah SWT, baru ditutup ijab Blogger? berapa nilainya kehancuran area51 yang Allah telah tunjukkan kehebatanNya mentadbir langit Dan bumi?  Unseen creatures cuba menyembunyikannya Dan kita mohon kepadaNya untuk tahu apa itu HIKMAH?  Tiada satu Kuasa dapat menghancurkan area51 melainkan Allah SWT.  Dan blogger berharap hanya kepadaNya agar ditutup ijab ini setelah risalahNya disampaikan melainkan Allah SWT hendak tahu berapa nilainya perkongsian unseen creatures dalam membinasakan area51. <br /><br />Bismillahirahmanirahim<br />Unseen creatures hendak tukar ganti doa selaku umat terbaik kepada perbuatan mencucuk telinga kemaluan tubuhbadan. Bermakna menjual agama Allah SWT dengan perbuatan mereka.<br /><br /><br />Sebarkan berita ini dan jadilah saksi Allah SWT<br /><br />Bismillahirahmanirahim<br /><br />Unseen creatures want to change the prayer as the best people to the act of piercing the body of the body. It means selling the religion of Allah SWT with their actions.<br /><br />Distribute this news and be a witness of Allah SWT<br /><br />Come we see who the Unseen creatures are claiming to be gods, angels, jinn and humans.

"As you said - men build the outside, women paint the inside - the Ba and the Ka ... it&#39;s time to be ASHAMED of our fake blindness and false pride ... anxiety made us guilty, regret made us ashamed - guilt is Ba, shame is Ka and when you see the complexity of the organism again, you know that we don&#39;t mean much as an individual, we&#39;re all a moment in time ... normal has become a museum - once, we were normal - not a bad thing, when you are in transition, but really bad when it becomes the new normal ... kaso (karen &amp; sofie) means DEPOPULATION in Japanese, and maybe that&#39;s not a bad idea either ... I mean, wearing black covering clothes is not the best you can do when temperatures are high, those men dressed in white take better care of themselves than tradition of their women ... when the circumstances are not optimal, nature shall take women first, which increases the depopulation (the lemmings principle) - I can&#39;t think but logical and the internet makes it easy to send an SOS - sometimes it takes several generations to LEARN something of importance ... you are not thinking WISE during conflicts, but it&#39;s still the best way to learn that you were WRONG all of the time ... that&#39;s just the way it is, we can&#39;t change the past, but we can do better in the future ...",karen kiebooms,2020-03-08T06:37:30Z,0

Even the Greeks and Romans referred to Yemen and nicknamed it Felix Arabia. Never heard of Saudi Arabia in Old Greek or Roman texts. The kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by the Saudi Family with the help of the British after killing hundred thousands people since the 17th century following Mohamed ibn Abdel-Wahab’s ideology while the Saudi Family are from Jewish descent from Bassorah in Irak.,Ornella ༠༩སཇ།།འ,2020-03-04T04:22:53Z,0

Yes the views around are very distracting.. Sometimes so attractive that one wishes to leave the driving seat to someone else... And enjoy changing scenes.. Usually I love to drive.. And hill driving is like going to date with my wife.. Non else.. It is kind of rammance for me.. Saudi has different choices.. One can really have lot of fun.. Good to see tourism in Saudi but wish... They preserve their culture customs.. Both men and women had attained respect for each other.. Which is no whr in west...,idrees shah,2020-02-26T08:47:56Z,0

All sounds good. But Saudi has no freedom.Everything has restrictions. How can a tourist go and have fun.? Don’t mix religion with human feelings and stop chopping their hands for small stuff. Courts are there to do justice. It cannot be just one family ruling. Everyone should be equally treated. I love to see the country.

"@firoz pk Ok you do realize  that your Persian language is literally built in Arabic letters so to put it simple without us your language would be without letters !!! <br />even cave man have letters!<br />as for history you Racist! I have a bad news for you here it is :<br />The territory that now constitutes Saudi Arabia was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations. The prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the EARLIEST traces of human activity in the world.[13] The world&#39;s second-largest religion,[14] Islam, emerged in modern-day Saudi Arabia. In the early 7th century, the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabia and created a single Islamic religious polity.[15] Following his death in 632, his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory (from the Iberian Peninsula in the West to modern-day Pakistan in the East) in a matter of decades. Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun (632–661), Umayyad (661–750), Abbasid (750–1517) and Fatimid (909–1171) caliphates as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia, Africa and Europe.[16][17][18][19][20]<br /><br /><br />So this is just a quick search about Saudi Arabia ...<br />Yes you have Persia but we have Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid and Fatimid CALIPHATES and more importantly ISLAM!<br /><br /><br />Go and cry to your father make sure you do so with Our letters Because Again I remind you You don’t even have letters!  <br /><br /><br />mic drop <br /><br /><br />السلام عليكم",Faisal Alkoblan,2020-03-20T01:50:47Z,0

"The regions of Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Peninsula was lush green with forests, lakes and rivers some 30,000 years ago. There was no Red Sea back then, and the Arabian Peninsula was joined to Africa. In place of the Red Sea, there were 2-3 big lakes and some smaller ones. Lake Tana in Ethiopia and Lake Victoria are the remnants of this lakes, and rivers system. The Red Sea was formed when the sea wall at Bab el Mandeb broke and the sea water gushed in to form the Red Sea as we know it today.<br />What you were looking at in this region is very old, not those impressive, unique buildings, but the whole mountainous terrain.

This is not Saudi Arabia. It is stolen from Yemen as the architecture shows it.,Turquoise Beach,2020-02-22T00:30:24Z,0
"1) Those houses are over 900 yrs old. <br />2) The architecture is known in the south of Arabian peninsula including Saudi, Oman, and Yemen. <br />3) In the 1920s, Yahya had expanded his power to the north into Tihamah and  &#39;Asir, but he collided with the rising influence of the Saudi king of Nejd and Hejaz, Abdul Aziz ibn Sa&#39;ud. In the early 1930s, Saudi forces retook much of these gains before withdrawing from some of the area, including the southern Tihamah city of Al Hudaydah. The present-day boundary with Saudi Arabia was established by the 20 May 1934 Treaty of Taif, following the Saudi-Yemeni War in 1934.",Nafla Alharthi,2020-02-24T20:24:18Z,0

@Nafla Alharthi Governments are the servers of the people in any normal country lol. I mean governments serve in the name of the people  .That&#39;s why people chooses  their own governments (servers) . Governments are in charge of protecting historical heritage in the name of people. But in Saudi Arabia  if king wants he destroys any historical site lol. As King destroyed many historical  and religious places which are holy for many muslim communities including the house of prophet Mohammad and grave yards of many significant muslim figures. That is vandalism.,maybeauty june,2020-02-25T13:34:46Z,0

"@Waseem Yousafzai we have air conditioning, but when the power goes out, unless you have a very expensive super generator to run all your power when the power goes out for days, no way to run the air conditioner. I&#39;m not usually too afraid of hurricanes as a rule, because native Floridians like myself we&#39;ve grown up with them all our lives, but the direct hit we got from hurricane Irma did scare me. It was a very powerful storm, and it did a lot of damage, but remember it&#39;s not so much the hurricane itself which yes the winds are quite powerful and damaging, but worse the tornadoes that spin off of them. Tornadoes terrify me, I&#39;ve had a  couple of very close calls with them, one where I don&#39;t even know how I survived it, only by God that saved me.",Mojosfire,2020-02-24T15:13:56Z,2

"In the 1920s, Yahya had expanded his power to the north into Tihamah and  &#39;Asir, but he collided with the rising influence of the Saudi king of Nejd and Hejaz, Abdul Aziz ibn Sa&#39;ud. In the early 1930s, Saudi forces retook much of these gains before withdrawing from some of the area, including the southern Tihamah city of Al Hudaydah. The present-day boundary with Saudi Arabia was established by the 20 May 1934 Treaty of Taif, following the Saudi-Yemeni War in 1934.",Nafla Alharthi,2020-02-24T20:34:21Z,0

Then our Lord sends a messenger renewing the religion that spoiled<br /><br /><br /><br />During the reign of Muhammad, rhetoric, eloquence, poetry and Arabic literature abounded.<br /><br /> Ignorance in religion and disobedience of the Lord increased in people.<br /><br />The Lord sent the eloquent Koran by Jibril to Muhammad, the clearest book on earth that guides people to the last religion.<br /><br />Did you know that his message is compatible with what is happening now<br /><br />I will give you what Muhammad said 1400 years ago (إن من أعلام الساعة وأشراطها أن يكتفي الرجال بالرجال والنساء بالنساء .)<br />This means that one of the signs of Judgment Day is that it becomes males with males and females with females &quot;homosexuality&quot;<br />Read the Koran <br />Try and you will not regret and discover<br /> the new",Fly away,2020-02-18T19:38:52Z,0

In the early 1930s, Saudi forces retook much of these gains before withdrawing from some of the area, including the southern Tihamah city of Al Hudaydah.

"In the 1920s, Yahya had expanded his power to the north into Tihamah and  &#39;Asir, but he collided with the rising influence of the Saudi king of Nejd and Hejaz, Abdul Aziz ibn Sa&#39;ud. In the early 1930s, Saudi forces retook much of these gains before withdrawing from some of the area, including the southern Tihamah city of Al Hudaydah. The present-day boundary with Saudi Arabia was established by the 20 May 1934 Treaty of Taif, following the Saudi-Yemeni War in 1934.",Nafla Alharthi,2020-02-24T21:04:05Z,0

@Harbi portraits اتفق معك فيه تقصير كبير في الحفاظ على الغابات وتوفير أماكن للمشاة والرياضات والحدائق والترفية الخ... لذا تم وضع خطط وبرامج لتغيير الحال إلى أفضل وفيه مشاريع قائمة لتغيير هالشيء والسعودية مساحة كبيرة تحتاج لوقت لتصحيح كل هذه المشكلات .<br />بالنسبة لماذكرت للمواقع الأثرية في السعودية أكثر من 6000 موقع  تاريخي..لكن بناء على طلبك ولأني مشغول شأذكر لك خمسة مواقع أثرية مهمة لكن فيها تقصير في تطوير بنيتها التحتية من فنادق ومنتجعات وأسواق أثرية وأماكن للترفية الخ...<br />1. العلا فيها مواقع لأربعة حضارات لقوم ثمود ثم الأنباط وتوجد مملكة لحيان ومملكة دادان لكن سأذكر أنها موقع واحد <br />2.مغائر النبي شعيب فيها كانت هجرة النبي موسى لهذه المدينة وفيها مواقع يعتقد أن النبي موسى استخدمها مثل بئر موسى وجبل موسى الخ..هذا الموقع أهم بكثير تاريخياً من مدائن صالح لأنه يعبر عن قصة نبيين مهمين لدى الأديان الثلاثة <br />3.قرية ذي عين الأثرية وتاريخها أكثر من 500 عام<br />4. الدرعية التاريخية تاريخها أكثر من 300 عام ومنطقة المربع في الرياض الذي يعود لتاريخ الدولة السعودية الثالثة<br />5. قرية رجال ألمع وتوجد قرى كثيرة في جبال الحجاز حتى حدود اليمن لكن مهملة جداً أهلهاهجروها إلى الرياض والمدن الكبيرة<br />الإكتشافات لا تتوقف كل عام يتم كشف مواقع أثرية جديدة <br />وقيمة السعودية ليست في بنيان فقط .. الآدب العربي الجاهلي وعصر صدر الإسلام والأموي غالب الشعراء من حدود المملكة العربية السعودية تاريخ أعظم الشعراء في نجد والحجاز وأماكنهم معلومة ..تاريخ أشرف الخلق والصحابة في هذه الأرض .. السعودية هي العمق الإسلامي والعربي في كل شيء حضارتنا وأدبها وتاريخها وأعتقد حتى مستقبلها والله أعلم <br />لاتكون مجحفاً المستقبل أفضل,عبدالله,2020-02-17T22:43:53Z,0

"Yes there is a great deal of history and culture which is magical and beautiful Eva  but surely Saudia Arabia&#39;s U turn re its perception  by the West is to try and erase the &#39;stain&#39; its rulers have placed upon it as being an uncivilised country  with public beheadings, subjugation of women who only just managed to secure the right to drive but only if chaperoned, exporting the toxic narrative of wahabism and terrorism abroad ,  murdering Khassogi in a  Turkish Embassy with so much brutality it shocked the world to its foundation. The Royal rulers are backwards, uneducated, homophobes and misongynist now in the hands of Mohammed Bin Salmam  a possible psychopath who is trying to clean that  &#39;self inflicted stain&#39; the image of Saudia Arabia by hosting world famous sports events and thus  inventing the term  &#39;sports wash&#39;. Should you Eva, should Anthony Joshua be legitimizing this repugnant regime . Would you do so in Apartheid South Africa I wonder? You say you were not funded by the Saudia government so I am at a loss to understand why you would be complicit in legitimizing this country through tourism? I think this was an error in judgement. Let this country have a &#39;Glasnost&#39;moment as in Russia of increased openness and transparency in government,  an opportunity for citizens to discuss publicly the problems of their  system and seek solutions. This will never happen in Saudia Arabia as the corrupt unislamic Monarchy would be no more. Please do not contribute to my favourite Shakespearean quote , &#39;fair is foul and foul is fair&#39; This country under this leader is and remains most certainly foul and your frolic to such a country seems ill  judged or worst contrived. This is the worst Brothers Grimm fairy tale , dark evil and foreboding, so Eva lovely and beautiful  as you are please don&#39;t be a voice for this &#39;stain&#39; . You have truly shocked me with your choice of country to vlog about and to legitimize tourism there.",Mercury Rising,2020-02-17T10:20:38Z,1

"Eva, can you please comment on how it works for women not covering their faces etc?  Are women living there expected to cover up but visiting women are allowed to wear whatever?

"@Rick Storm It&#39;s not called begging mate! U were born in the UK,u had opportunities at ur feet, brother do u realise how citizens of some countries struggle to make a living for their families and see Europe as that golden opportunity to support their families to live at least a life that would meet their needs and some of their wants. U won&#39;t understand. But seeing how when one comes to <a href=""http://europe.life/"">europe.life</a> is made difficult not by citizens of that country such as UK but other Europeans who also come to live there and claim superiority over Asians...Nd polish are widely known for that. Personal experience! And that of many of my Asian friends. If I ask Eva to show this in her country it&#39;s not begging it&#39;s called reaching out via a platform to increase awareness.",Sabahat Khan,2020-02-23T21:52:39Z,1
"As a Muslim, I ask you, why would you want to go anywhere you feel hate? I would never  go to Europe, I was born in the UK, I got nothing against any country, but if I feel I am unwelcome, Im very happy travelling in our own Muslim country, I dont care if any Westerner comes to us or not... really amazing, how you are begging for someones approval... its embarrassing, dont do it.",Rick Storm,2020-02-23T05:24:01Z,0

"Sabahat Khan will saudi allow everyone to visit Saudi Arabia without visa .they recently allowing peoples from rich countries on e visa or on arrival,while their neighbours Arab countries are allowing on arrival from a long time off course from rich countries and mostly their behaviour with poor countries nationals are totally different from if u from the richer countries.i will not blame all of them for this but in majority are like this .which is very sad",Khaan Khaan,2020-02-18T17:01:12Z,1

How you travel in Saudi Arabia without Hijab??,Fahad Zafar,2020-02-17T09:10:59Z,2
@Fahad Zafar You need to read the Holly Kuran more and do not interpret your way or by some tribal pakistani chief who thinks that way,Dževad Bayraktar,2020-02-18T05:02:39Z,0
@M G exactly thats why most females in Muslim countries from Bosnia to Indonesia do not cover with Hijab; in middle east thats more of a tribal (pre Islamic tradition) that has somehow benn inserted as a way of religion but it is not; mostly men probably enjoyed it as it creates less jealousy,Dževad Bayraktar,2020-02-18T05:01:33Z,0
