"I really fail to understand why in the first place you ppl go so deep into the see to catch fish and when you catch one after so much of hard work you throw it back into the water, isn&#39;t that hook painful for the fish that pierce the jaws and because of the salt water it might take hell lot of time time for the wound to heal.",Azharuddin Masood,2020-04-17T12:13:21Z,19
"Khalid Saeed As if you were a fish in your previous life 😆 how can you say the fish doesn’t feel pain 😆 I think it is cruel to hook them for fun, unless you need it for eating or business.",Touqir Butter,2020-04-21T14:36:34Z,0
