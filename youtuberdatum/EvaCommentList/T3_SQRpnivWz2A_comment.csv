"It seems to me like those people have the ideal life and are the happiest. Some people here think that African people are all poor and live like that because of poverty, but I think if you are born and raised there, e.g. in the Maasai village, you are a lot more happier then we are here. I think not many Maasai people would like to change our lives with theirs cause we have many bad things like jealousy, racism and overwork etc. here. But I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true, maybe they also have those things. However, what is fact is that climate change which is mostly caused by us, is affecting their lives in a negative way and because of us those people have to change their habbits instead of us. Which is pretty sad and really unfair. I really would like to know more about them and other nations in Africa! I find it incredible that they are so open about white people even though we did and still do awful things to many people in Africa.",Emiko Aishiteru,2021-03-10T14:24:59Z,0

"Why did not Syria appear so professional and positive? Because it is not in line with the policy of your country ... which is not in its interest for Syria to be a secular and liberal country ... Are you and your friend, the lady of Damascus, satisfied with that ... I believe in the source that will reveal the clear truth and the sun will rise again.🌅",tarek trez,2021-02-24T10:01:38Z,1

Omg Eva is getting more beautiful every day. When she tried the snuff and the little wrinkles showed up in the corner of her eyes when laughing. 😍 - I hope she can enjoy her explorer days for many more years to come! - Shame on me that I am the wimpy kid who got bullied and  silently keeps aging under my rock seeing the years trickle by evading people and experiences. 😔,Tobias S.,2021-02-20T10:25:07Z,0

"@Dave K Wrong. We need to stop showing fear and giving in to totalitarian dictates. We need to go back to normal right now. The toll on human lives is enormous. Suicides, family breakdown, alcohol and drug abuse and the psychological harm due to isolation. All for a virus that poses no danger to people who are not very elderly and suffering from serious health problems. Here in Canada almost 85% of the deaths are in long-term care facilities.",jburtonca,2021-02-21T10:44:05Z,1

You produce great videos but why are you hugging poor tribes during the pandemic? You have medical insurance but they don&#39;t - nor any decent medical provision. You wouldn&#39;t be able to do this in any developed country right now but somehow it&#39;s ok to put these tribespeople in danger just because you want to produce a video and their government favours your dollars over the wellbeing of its citizens.,styx,2021-02-15T18:55:48Z,1
"I greatly enjoyed the video. But it still bugs me to think of the implications of travelling during a pandemic. I assume the Massai Tribe as a whole is at a very low percentage of immunization for Covid rn and was most likely largely spared from the first waves. So bringing Covid to them would be fatal. I assume that like most of Tansania&#39;s population their average age is quite young and most would be fine, but it would be a thought that would be hard for me to live with during travel. On the other hand you still provide content for thousands of people stuck at home, who can&#39;t travel rn. It&#39;s a complicated conundrum.",Lukas Reuter,2021-02-15T18:48:22Z,8

I think you&#39;re awesome and I love your videos so I hope you don&#39;t take this the wrong way. But going to the Masaai (any isolated group for that matter) during a pandemic when you come in contact with other people and travel there puts them at great risk for catching covid and making a while group sick. I&#39;m sure you get tested but false negatives exist and you come in contact with people after you get tested. So perhaps something to think about during your next travels.,TheEternalScream,2021-02-15T16:14:09Z,6

"@Salma Nassif just say you’re racist and don’t want to accept that not everyone lives life the way you do. Being vegetarian works for you, great. But before you start judging other cultures, try and learn something about them and their beliefs, their way of life, the environment they live in. I’m sure there are many people who think that your culture is backwards in some way, and they’re just as bigoted in their mindset towards your culture as you are towards Maasai culture. It’s one thing to have an opinion, but it’s another thing to discriminate against an entire group of people just because they don’t do things the way you do. Please grow up and learn that people are different, what works for you won’t work for others and vice versa. That doesn’t make you any better than them. I don’t drink blood bc in my culture it’s not permissible, even though my tribe isn’t that far from the Maasai people, but I don’t judge them for it, nor do I judge them for their other customs. If the people of the same land can learn to accept each other’s differences, than you as an outsider to that location really shouldn’t have an opinion in the matter. So before you go around calling other people primitive, maybe take a look into your own culture, because I’m sure you’ll find many things that people outside of your culture would find primitive as well.",Makena M.,2021-04-09T18:06:01Z,0
@Blandina Mnyinga we all have a primitive side and its not just not wrong to be close and in touch with that primal instinct its actually necessary for our growth and expansion spiritually speaking. But to become conscious of the ways in which u decide to tap into that side is something an evolved soul inevitably has to go through. We become as much responsible for our choices and how it affect us and other sentient beings as we become free. Even Eva recently turned vegetarian for that same reason. It is part of personal growth. Ive been vegetarian an mostly vegan sugar free for more than 15 years now and i eat delicious food. The cow whose blood he drinks supplied her body with iron by eating grass.. not by drinking blood. But humans consciousness can sink lower than a cows consciousness. Its too obvious but when u need it be explained i just pity u dont see what a one year old can clearly see without needing it be explained. Im wasting time here doing it.,Salma Nassif,2021-03-20T21:20:50Z,0
"@Salma Nassif first of all if you think they are primitive then come and see for yourself &quot;&quot;u will be surprised&quot;&quot; they are so good,humble, loving, protective of nature and wild animals,knows how to live n follow laws, each group of age have their duties and things to be responsible too,in short they are AMAIZING.",Blandina Mnyinga,2021-03-20T20:15:23Z,0

"I traveled in East Africa back in the summer of 1973. Of course, I had no particular plan, but I had a wonderful time with the people. I remember traveling on top of supply trucks off-road in Tanzania, which is where I had contact with Maasai people. I was traveling from Lake Victoria to Dar, then on to Mombasa. Because of how they looked, carrying their spears and all, they were a little intimidating at first, but in the course of traveling with them for a few days, we all became very friendly together and had a good time. Other African non-Maasai locals who were traveling at the same time translated so we could communicate. They ended up being well amused that I was even out there at all. The children were fascinated by my hair, light brown, straight, and about 8 inches long.",Richie B,2021-02-15T12:35:58Z,0
