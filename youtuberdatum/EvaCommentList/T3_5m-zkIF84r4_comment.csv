"Eva - I&#39;m not too sure about you! I watch a few of your adventures but sometimes they make me cringe...you seem so culturally irreverent and cross cultural boundaries with abandon!  Bit like (as Eric Burdon said in the song Sky Pilot), &quot;you smile as you kill&quot;. Nonetheless this is unlikely the last vid of yours I will watch. I contrast your vids with Nick (Indigo Traveller) who always seems to be most culturally respectful. I suspect you know that you sail a fine edge! And I do note that you engage consultants. But whilst you have wonderful adventures I suspect They may not be easily available for an average tourist?",Jaahda Jinnah,2021-04-28T04:56:23Z,0

"I appreciate her showing the beautiful and intricate culture of this region. It is rare these days to see the Middle East in a positive light. But I really do not appreciate the examination of this sport. In America where I live we have similar equestrian sports with really bad abuse issues, and I feel the same about them as I do with this. You can tell the horses are uncomfortable, in pain, scared. Its very very hard to watch. I love this channel, but I wish she hadn&#39;t promoted this. There are ways to make this sport more humane and still have fun.",Morgan W,2021-04-27T02:09:50Z,1
"The official Buzkashi league of Afghanistan doesn’t use a dead goat anymore 👍🏽<br /><br />But believe me, the horses are treated with utmost respect, only when they play they need to be ready to handle these kind of situations. Like in any battle or war before the use of modern mechanical weapons.",che,2021-04-28T00:32:03Z,1

"The chaos reminds me of my first &quot;soccer&quot;/&quot;football&quot; game as a kid in Tucson, Arizona, USA.  I can see the love of the chaos there.  At least there is a &quot;goal&quot;.  When I first played, there was not even a goal, just about 300+ crazy kids, seemed like my whole school of classmates, all about 5 years old, all cluelessly crowding around, crushing each other and chasing a ball in a dirt field with no goals, just crazy, but fun!

"&quot;Pato&quot; or &quot;Duck game&quot; is the Argentinian national sport since 1953 with a ball instead of an &quot;alive duck&quot;, the way it was played since early XVll century. It was a very violent sport by then, not only for the ducks which was replaced by a pneumatic ball with six handles of 40cm big. The horses have shorter legs  than Polo ones. The are two teams of four players each in a field of 200 x 90 mts.aprox. where the players &quot;fight&quot; for the ball. The players have to ride with his arm stretched out so that the rivals can get a chance to snatch the Pato. A goal is scored when the ball is thrown through a vertical ring. It&#39;s a sort of combination of Basketball and Polo.  🧉",Cesar War,2021-04-24T14:50:42Z,0

"@Khalil Sadat So you have zero understanding of Farsi vocabulary, grammar, structure of the language,  historical background, And know nothing about what the experts of language say about it,  But because some Iranian guy called you a caveman you reached to  a conclusion that Farsi and Dari are two different languages. I am sure this is the deal breaker, case closed<br />Now about your second misconception about Pashtuns and Afghanistan. The problem with your kind is that you live in your own delusional world you base your judgment in  hearsay and what you hear from other  ignorant  people like yourself. All you have to do is just open a history book , you can find information on Google,  basically this is something that anyone in any part of the world can have an access to. How the political geography that was named Afghanistan by Britain came into existence?<br />Between 1870s and 1890s, Britain and Russians Czars felt that they needed a buffer zone between their  territories. That was the need of the day by those European colonial powers in the region that they decided to have a buffer zone between them and Afghanistan came into existence, to serve the needs of Britain and Russia. The southern borders were fixed by British and the north by Russians. Pashtuns like other ethnic groups were the silent observers of what was going on,  not players in the game. Yes Pashtun leaders such as Abdul Rahman, Dost Muhammad and Yahqub were used as stooges and henchmen by the British to show things were done in proper and legit ways. In return these Pashtun leaders were getting incentives and salaries from Britain. Why do you think majority of Pashtuns are Pakistanis and living in Pakistan? If  Pashtuns  wanted to do something for anyone, they should’ve done for their own  people, that they are part of Pakistan. <br />The second thing,  it is not A privilege or a plus point to live in Afghanistan today. Afghanistan is a broken country, destroyed, poor,  needy and on top of that the most insecure, threatened by suicide bombers and Taliban. So I don’t know how your brain operates but please give me two good reasons that our region or people should be happy to be part of Afghanistan and not part of any of neighboring countries? All of our neighbors are better off when it comes to security education, economy or any other aspects of life. We cant live in peace with each other, see how miserable, broke, needy and devastated the people are. I think people will be at least on the same level as Tajikistan if the northern part of the country becomes part of the Tajikistan, the west will be at the same level as Iranian if the western part becomes part of Iran,  the southern Preston Part can join Pakistan what their Pashtun brothers. This is just a thought, or we can partition the country between south and north the south can live under the Taliban and Pashtun tribal rule, and the north will re-establish Khorasan and Live with their own identity culture and way of life. All of these scenarios are better than current situation, where 300 to 400 people are getting killed in the arm conflict every day, and the Taliban suicide bombers are killing innocent people . people have  no security no jobs and they’re miserable.",Kourosh587,2021-04-29T02:29:29Z,0
"@Kourosh587  To you I may be naive, to me your broken and with no hope. <br /><br />We Afghans need education, jobs and security. Not some pitiful racist, dividing even more. Its not racist to live your culture or to speak your language and you should be proud of it. But its racist to belittle others, downgrade others to feel better about yourself and to make general assumptions about others. All things you already did previously. That automatically disqualifies you from any meaningful discussion on the topics you mentioned, because you already made your mind and are too emotionally invested. <br /><br />I feel sorry for you and hope maybe your eyes will get open to see beyond your hatred and do not end up miserable, like all racist do 🙏🏽",che,2021-04-29T02:18:56Z,0

"Its amazing they keep their horses alive and healthy in conditions where keeping themselves alive and healthy is a challenge. I&#39;ve seen wealthy westerners do horrifying things to their animals; animal racing is still alive and well, Del Mar tracks and the Derby is just waiting for covid restrictions to lift, to put the animals, horses, dogs, emus, ostrich, camels, back to work. And when they stop winning, they are worthless and put down. Animal cruelty is always wrong, but I wouldn&#39;t say its limited to this sport or area, or even a severe example of that. I hate watching anyone use a riding crop, I hate seeing an animal broken and domesticated, but the Afghans literally INVENTED horseback breeding and riding. So please respect the history of horseback riding and animal husbandry. <br /><br />Afghans love their animals. Afghans and other South Asians are the origin of domesticated animals, this is an ancient sport; let&#39;s be fair. We don&#39;t play other ancient games because they are incredibly violent or murderous. Its mostly westerners who romanticized this sport anyway; its not like all Afghans grow up playing Buzkashi, its more like a rodeo, its a niche thing that is not mainstream in life.",SoVerySasa,2021-04-23T19:08:51Z,0

"The white horse name was &quot;Sorkh Khon&quot; those are two Farsi words, Sorkh means red and Khon means blood, so it translates into Red Blood. <br /><br />Buzkashi is also the combination of two Farsi words, Buz means goat and Kash means to pull, so the literal translation is pulling goats. Chapandaz means someone who attacks of ambushes, so the player is an ambusher or attacker. <br />The carcass they play with is not from a goat, goat is too light and if the players pull a goat,  it will be torn into pieces. So they carry the carcass of a calf which is way heavier.",Sediq Ali Hussien,2021-04-23T18:15:01Z,2

"@Lemarocity No Not at all. Afghanistan is a fake and fabricated name which was coined  and imposed on our land  by the British a little over a hundred years ago. But the land itself and the people have a rich culture,  proud identity and long history as Khorasan (Sunrise) and also as eastern Iran. Modern Farsi Dari is a Khorasani language (Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmanistan and Afghanistan)  In the post Muslim Arab invasion, The Tajik dynasty of Samanids made Farsi Dari as the official language of the land.  The first poets of the language lwrote poems in Farsi Dari during Samanids, Rudaki, Shukor Balkhi, Rabia Balkhi, Shahid Balkhi and Honzoli Badghisi. This was the time when in western Iran (Islamic republic of Iran) they spoke Arabic, it took a couple of centuries for the language to be spread in modern Iran. Rumi was from Bactra/Balkhi, so he was a Balkhi, a Khorasani, a Farsi speaker, an  Eastern Iranian in the sense that Samarqand was the Capital of that Iran. In the old city of Balkh there is still a village called Rostahe Bahavodin, that is where Mawlana Balkhi/Rumi was born and lived there till age 9 or 10.  Ferodowsi was from Tus, a city in greater Khorasan that was ruled by the Ghaznavids, his work was sponsored by the Mahamud the king of Ghazna, that is why he dedicated  Shah-Nameh (epic of kings) to Sultan Mahamud.",Sediq Ali Hussien,2021-04-23T19:19:48Z,1

"I usually really enjoy your videos, but this was absolutely horrifying to watch. I&#39;m all for being open minded and agree that it&#39;s not our place to judge certain aspects of other cultures. But I will call out cruelty. This is the first time I&#39;ve heard of or seen this sport, but that&#39;s what this is: pure animal cruelty. I don&#39;t think I saw a single horse that wasn&#39;t in pain throughout the whole video. It was actually very upsetting. It really put me off that you decided to paint it in such a positive light. It doesn&#39;t matter that they may be well taken care of and supposedly only play sometimes, putting a horse through that even just once is disgusting. &quot;Extraordinary care&quot; doesn&#39;t mean anything if you go on to treat a horse like that. And just because a lot of western/European horse sports aren&#39;t that kind to the animals either doesn&#39;t make it okay to promote this. This is on a completely another level and honestly made my blood boil. I&#39;m very disappointed, you should know better.",MonikaH,2021-04-23T15:58:20Z,10
"@Kourosh587 I obviously cannot control what people do to their animals and I can’t save them all. I think it’s incredibly sad, but what you do with your animal is not something I really can change. And it’s sad and scary that you’re excusing the pain these animals are going through by saying that they have it better than some others. Would that logic hold up if we were talking about people? Would you be happy to occasionally get extensively beaten, have metal grinding your teeth and oral tissue down by a metal rod tugging in your mouth, and put into a fight you had no say in because there are others that have it worse and at least you get fed? <br />What these horses are going through is abusive, and I’m sure that these other horses used in transportation and manual work might also be abused. This does not excuse the pain these people still put that animal through. This is traumatic to a horse, both physically and mentally and leaves scars. And I honestly do not believe these horses are getting good care beyond being fed between the games either judging by the way most of these people handled their animals throughout the video. All the riders there were tearing their horse’s mouth off, constantly, treating their animals incredibly roughly. I doubt that way of handling changes after the game. You’re using a living feeling animal, that has its own will and mind, as a slave to your fancy by making it do what you want through pain. That is not acceptable, and the frequency of abuse doesn’t matter.",MonikaH,2021-04-24T05:50:43Z,0
"As someone who has been there and seen that, I guess the only option that you have is to go and buy all of those animals from them and bring them to the west. Malcolm X Once said on a TV show that there were two different kind of slaves, one  was working as the house keeper for the master and the other kind was working in the Cotton-field. The housekeeper was better off compared to the ones working on the field.  Animals that are used for transportation and other kinds of manual work, are having it 100 times worse than these animals that are properly fed and taken care of.",Kourosh587,2021-04-23T23:14:28Z,0

"I already commented that I wasn&#39;t sure if I could watch this video, but I actually did. I think you&#39;re a great YouTuber and I love that you travel the world to show many different cultures. I&#39;m happy to see that most horses in this video look like their owners are taking good care of them. They are not too skinny, their fur is shiny and the hooves look okay. But it does make me feel sick that these horses are used for this sport. Of course, this sport has been going on for many years and is a big part of their culture, so by saying &quot;they should stop&quot; wouldn&#39;t change a thing. But I don&#39;t like it that you supported this sport by riding one of their horses to learn the sport and by sponsoring a prize for the players. This makes you contribute to animal cruelty, because the horses are clearly not comfortable during the game. They get whipped a lot, they get pushed over each other and you can see that a lot of horses open their mouths to avoid the pressure of the bit.",Fenna For Animals,2021-04-23T15:45:40Z,11

Horses have been battle animals since the dawn of humans. They have been bred for thousands of years to excel in battlefields. These horses are the pride of their owners. This sport is a remnant of battle tactics of abducting the enemy or picking up your dead from the battlefield. As you can see no horse was injured.,dilbar09naz,2021-04-24T19:56:23Z,1

"​@sheer Dressage is enjoyable for horses? Jumping with a heavy meat sack on your back is fun? Dog dancing is cute? Bull running? Fox chasing? Hunting? Dog fighting? Clipping off ears and tails for aesthetic is your regional preference, no? Bacon on everything? Commercial farms and animals crammed 10 to a 5ft space, that&#39;s your culture right? Your people traditionalized commercial farming and called it capitalism, right? The pipelines you all keep building and wiping out pristine water sources and land, that&#39;s part of western tradition and culture and in the fabric of western survival. Horses in pens all day. Dogs in crates all day. Kids on leashes. Treating humans like animals. Please. Watching a fox hunt is far more barbaric than this. Watching a bull fight is far more barbaric than this. Watching a rodeo is far more barbaric than this. Please.",SoVerySasa,2021-04-24T19:28:09Z,0

"​@sheer honestly, writing people off as animal abusers because of one game played by less than 1% of the population, when there are literally thousands of episodes of animal abuse on animal planet, while people are lauding the tiger king and animal mills, its hypocritical and pointless. Well fed animals being put under stressful situations is literally what racing is. You all love that sport. I literally said, its not nice to watch and I don&#39;t endorse it, but its not ANYWHERE NEAR the animal cruelty PAID FOR AND SPONSORED by ENTIRE CITIES AND TOWNS IN THE UNITED STATES, SPAIN, ENGLAND AND ANYWHERE ELSE THEY GO TO RACES OR SPORT. Have you seen polo? Buzkashi inspired polo. Polo is also cruel. Anything forcing animals to be domesticated is not really nice. We are the reason sheep cannot shed naturally. We are the reason pigs get so big they can&#39;t function. Buzkashi ranks lower in cruelty than many of the worldly sports around animals. You&#39;re just looking for a soapbox to stand on without being objective, nothing more.",SoVerySasa,2021-04-24T17:41:48Z,0

"@Balouch LaLa Yes indeed, there&#39;s one in Tajikistan and in western China too with that same name. Also the Bagh you mention belongs to that palace and it&#39;s called Jahan Numa. If I&#39;m correct that palace was in use by the Soviets during war because it was close to the land border. There&#39;s not much info in English about this building though but it looks great.",A.P.,2021-04-23T21:08:11Z,0
"Tashkughan or Taxkurgan is more historical name  than Kholm.  Tajik regions in the area, even in different countries have this name. There is one in Tajikistan, one in Kashgar region of Xinjiang province of China. As a little kid traveling between Kabul and Balkh in the 80s, I always looked forward to eat scum of milk (qaimaq) and fig in Tashqurghan. Do not recall  any palace being in there but there was a Baghi Jahan Numa, but do not remember much about it.
