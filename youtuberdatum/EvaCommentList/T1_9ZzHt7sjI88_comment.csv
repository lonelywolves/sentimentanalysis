"28 Know that we are in the moments of Lot and Noah where churches had false prophets and anointed men of all kinds were roaming the earth with all kinds of miracles. Some sons of perdition were established over churches and organisations such as the Catholic, Protestant, evangelical and Branhamist churches and church unions and federations... Any way of Salvation was corrupt. And in Noah, we see that eternal Life consists in recognizing Jehovah, the only true God and him whom He found good to send, Noah, his living prophet messenger. Noah was warning them and they called the warning: judgment.

"If you like to have a unique experience in the land of legends and the historical depth of man, if you are interested in studying the human and the earth and going into adventures.<br />I can coordinate for you on a unique trip to &quot;land of Sam&quot;,  to and around Sana&#39;a.<br />I have already had a distinguished experience to get to know the details of the scene and probe the depths of the surrounding area during the war as a warrior, and I have a lot of experience about areas that you may be stunned from.<br />I do not speak to you as a tourist guide, but rather I speak to you as a person who loves citizenship and aspires that the world knows what wars took place for burial, there are those who work to hide these secrets from the world in order to take advantage of them, and do not want this people to restore the glory of their ancestors, I think you heard about the Kingdom of Sheba and the Kingdom of the Prophet Solomon And many others.<br />I can accompany you for the purpose of finding someone to share this experience with me professionally to show it to the world. Likewise, I am confident that I have toured some countries in the world and several regions in Yemen, and I am sure that you will find pleasure in every day and every moment you spend in this good town.<br />If you have interest, you can contact me via e-mail adeepalmitwakil@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a><br />Or via Whats App +967733805933<br />Or by responding here.<br />Greetings...",Adeep Almitwakil,2020-07-13T20:36:45Z,0

"Socotra is now part of Yemen and has faced conflicts for long portions of its existence. Because of its unusual aspects, Socotra has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in order to protect the hundreds of species endemic to the island and to work to ensure that it stays protected.<br />This list will focus on a variety of aspects that make the island such a unique space, ranging from blue tarantulas, to white sand beaches and weirdly-shaped trees. Socotra is truly one of the most fascinating—and underappreciated—places on the planet. <a href=""https://www.thetravel.com/socotra-island/"">https://www.thetravel.com/socotra-island/</a>",Blue Mountain,2020-06-21T12:44:56Z,0

"Asalam O Alikum to all of the Muslim aumma  <br /><br />سورة الرَّحمٰن<br />In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.<br /><br />The Beneficent ﴾1﴿  Hath made known the Qur&#39;an. ﴾2﴿  He hath created man. ﴾3﴿  He hath taught him utterance. ﴾4﴿  The sun and the moon are made punctual. ﴾5﴿  The stars and the trees prostrate. ﴾6﴿  And the sky He hath uplifted; and He hath set the measure, ﴾7﴿  That ye exceed not the measure, ﴾8﴿  But observe the measure strictly, nor fall short thereof. ﴾9﴿  And the earth hath He appointed for (His) creatures, ﴾10﴿  Wherein are fruit and sheathed palm-trees, ﴾11﴿  Husked grain and scented herb. ﴾12﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾13﴿  He created man of clay like the potter&#39;s, ﴾14﴿  And the jinn did He create of smokeless fire. ﴾15﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾16﴿  Lord of the two Easts, and Lord of the two Wests! ﴾17﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾18﴿  He hath loosed the two seas. They meet. ﴾19﴿  There is a barrier between them. They encroach not (one upon the other). ﴾20﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾21﴿  There cometh forth from both of them the pearl and coral-stone. ﴾22﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾23﴿  His are the ships displayed upon the sea, like banners. ﴾24﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾25﴿  Everyone that is thereon will pass away; ﴾26﴿  There remaineth but the Countenance of thy Lord of Might and Glory. ﴾27﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾28﴿  All that are in the heavens and the earth entreat Him. Every day He exerciseth (universal) power. ﴾29﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾30﴿  We shall dispose of you, O ye two dependents (man and jinn). ﴾31﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾32﴿  O company of jinn and men, if ye have power to penetrate (all) regions of the heavens and the earth, then penetrate (them)! Ye will never penetrate them save with (Our) sanction. ﴾33﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾34﴿  There will be sent, against you both, heat of fire and flash of brass, and ye will not escape. ﴾35﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾36﴿  And when the heaven splitteth asunder and becometh rosy like red hide - ﴾37﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? - ﴾38﴿  On that day neither man nor jinni will be questioned of his sin. ﴾39﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾40﴿  The guilty will be known by their marks, and will be taken by the forelocks and the feet. ﴾41﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾42﴿  This is hell which the guilty deny. ﴾43﴿  They go circling round between it and fierce, boiling water. ﴾44﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾45﴿  But for him who feareth the standing before his Lord there are two gardens. ﴾46﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾47﴿  Of spreading branches. ﴾48﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾49﴿  Wherein are two fountains flowing. ﴾50﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾51﴿  Wherein is every kind of fruit in pairs. ﴾52﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾53﴿  Reclining upon couches lined with silk brocade, the fruit of both the gardens near to hand. ﴾54﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾55﴿  Therein are those of modest gaze, whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them. ﴾56﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾57﴿  (In beauty) like the jacynth and the coral-stone. ﴾58﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾59﴿  Is the reward of goodness aught save goodness? ﴾60﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾61﴿  And beside them are two other gardens, ﴾62﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾63﴿  Dark green with foliage. ﴾64﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾65﴿  Wherein are two abundant springs. ﴾66﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾67﴿  Wherein is fruit, the date-palm and pomegranate. ﴾68﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾69﴿  Wherein (are found) the good and beautiful - ﴾70﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? - ﴾71﴿  Fair ones, close-guarded in pavilions - ﴾72﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? - ﴾73﴿  Whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them - ﴾74﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾75﴿  Reclining on green cushions and fair carpets. ﴾76﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾77﴿  Blessed be the name of thy Lord, Mighty and glorious! ﴾78﴿",Genghis khan,2020-06-21T11:38:50Z,1
