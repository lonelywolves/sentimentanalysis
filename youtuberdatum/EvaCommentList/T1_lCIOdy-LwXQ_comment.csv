"I once went on a road-trip in Yemen and spent the night sleeping in the empty-quarter desert, I had the most disturbing nightmares ever! <br /><br />1- Well, I know this might sound a bit odd and random, but I have dreamt of Zeus mating with a palm tree and begetting an ant that is capable of crawling on the edge of the Higgs Boson!<br /><br />2- I once also dreamt of my mitochondria protesting to break free from my organelles , claiming that nature has enslaved them !<br /><br />3- On that night of a full moon, I dreamt of Professor Noam Chomsky eating books and regurgitating the field of Modern Linguistics!<br /><br />4- The funniest dream I ever had, was when I had a vision of a Neanderthal swallowing a whole apple, and it played ping-pong with his heart while passing down his oesophagus!<br /><br />5- The most disgusting dream I ever had, was of a female&#39;s menstruation blood turning into jelly and been marketed by an Oompa Loompa as Halloween treats! <br /><br /><br /><br />I have absolutely no clue what caused me to have such nightmares, I have been left a little concerned that I&#39;m having a neurological malfunction!<br /><br />Given that I&#39;ve heard my neurons conspiring to abandon the dwelling of my skull, things don&#39;t seem to be heading in the right direction, ever-since!",Ali Al-Mahdi,2020-02-01T17:28:48Z,1

"welcome to Saudi, the people in here are very welcoming and generous, you will always feel home and safe, they will always offer you help or ask if u need anything, its part of the culture they inherited centuries over centuries through the bedwin hospitality and generosity that they were raised on. there are so much to do and to see upon so many levels from desert rides and the vast sand dune and camping up to the lavish life of Riyadh and the top class places. <br />we are so happy to have you and all the travelers and tourists, finally we broke that wall to let the outside world finally know what is real saudi arabia and saudi people, and many thanks to the sweet couple who accommodated you, it&#39;s a natural thing that a saudi family would do &lt;3<br />** one extra note or i&#39;ll say a message; here in the desert it&#39;s VERY PROHIBITED that you cut off a green stick or tree branch, due to the scarce greenery and the desertification. it is actually disrespectful to the people who resides in that certain part of the desert. you can only pick up the dead already broken wood you might find in that location, or the simplest way, you can buy your own fire wood from any gas station it&#39;s so cheap and handy.  i&#39;m sure the guy who cut off the tree branch didn&#39;t know that and did it with good intentions though. <br />peace.",mishal almishal,2020-02-01T15:25:23Z,2

Is Saudi woman are allowed to cut hair this short?i am surprised,parmeet Singh,2020-01-31T17:35:16Z,1
. Islam is a disease. Muhamed was a pedophile a rapist a slaver murderer and warmonger if he existed today he would be tried and executed for crimes against humanity. As can be seen by how messed up the Islamic world is killing eachother and divided all their nations weak not inventing not producing etg that God is obviously NOT with them. Muhamed was a whore of Satan nothing more,Fox 400 Fox 400,2020-02-01T14:58:28Z,0

"There are amazing places to visit in the desert of Saudi Arabia. Most of them are quite far from Riyadh, though. The place you went to isn’t good for camping. Most people go to it for the purpose of hunting and not camping . Try to ask the people who will show you around to take you to places with good scenery and terrains. And when you go out to eat in Riyadh, try the restaurants in the northern part of the city. Just ask the driver to take you to the restaurants near the Northern Ring Road. Take care and have a nice stay.",chris redfield,2020-01-31T12:27:16Z,7
