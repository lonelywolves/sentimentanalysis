They meet. ﴾19﴿  There is a barrier between them. They encroach not (one upon the other). ﴾20﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾21﴿  There cometh forth from both of them the pearl and coral-stone. ﴾22﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾23﴿  His are the ships displayed upon the sea, like banners. ﴾24﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾25﴿  Everyone that is thereon will pass away; ﴾26﴿  There remaineth but the Countenance of thy Lord of Might and Glory. ﴾27﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾28﴿  All that are in the heavens and the earth entreat Him. Every day He exerciseth (universal) power. ﴾29﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾30﴿  We shall dispose of you, O ye two dependents (man and jinn). ﴾31﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾32﴿  O company of jinn and men, if ye have power to penetrate (all) regions of the heavens and the earth, then penetrate (them)! Ye will never penetrate them save with (Our) sanction. ﴾33﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾34﴿  There will be sent, against you both, heat of fire and flash of brass, and ye will not escape. ﴾35﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾36﴿  And when the heaven splitteth asunder and becometh rosy like red hide - ﴾37﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? - ﴾38﴿  On that day neither man nor jinni will be questioned of his sin. ﴾39﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾40﴿  The guilty will be known by their marks, and will be taken by the forelocks and the feet. ﴾41﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾42﴿  This is hell which the guilty deny. ﴾43﴿  They go circling round between it and fierce, boiling water. ﴾44﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾45﴿  But for him who feareth the standing before his Lord there are two gardens. ﴾46﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾47﴿  Of spreading branches. ﴾48﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾49﴿  Wherein are two fountains flowing. ﴾50﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾51﴿  Wherein is every kind of fruit in pairs. ﴾52﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾53﴿  Reclining upon couches lined with silk brocade, the fruit of both the gardens near to hand. ﴾54﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾55﴿  Therein are those of modest gaze, whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them. ﴾56﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾57﴿  (In beauty) like the jacynth and the coral-stone. ﴾58﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾59﴿  Is the reward of goodness aught save goodness? ﴾60﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾61﴿  And beside them are two other gardens, ﴾62﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾63﴿  Dark green with foliage. ﴾64﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾65﴿  Wherein are two abundant springs. ﴾66﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾67﴿  Wherein is fruit, the date-palm and pomegranate. ﴾68﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾69﴿  Wherein (are found) the good and beautiful - ﴾70﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? - ﴾71﴿  Fair ones, close-guarded in pavilions - ﴾72﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? - ﴾73﴿  Whom neither man nor jinni will have touched before them - ﴾74﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾75﴿  Reclining on green cushions and fair carpets. ﴾76﴿  Which is it, of the favours of your Lord, that ye deny? ﴾77﴿  Blessed be the name of thy Lord, Mighty and glorious! ﴾78﴿",Genghis khan,2020-06-23T09:15:22Z,0

Your videos have some striking visual imagery.  They would be much better with some historical and cultural context.  For example.  What was the story behind that fort?  Who built it?  Who were they defending against?  Were the defenses ever tested?  Why do those fishermen live on the water?  How do they operate as a community?  This kind of info would really take your vids to the next level?,Mr Incredible,2020-06-22T16:13:49Z,0

"Your videos remind me of my own travels in Central Asia in the 1990-2000. There are two kinds of travels. Quran says: سَنُرِيهِمْ آيَاتِنَا فِي الْآفَاقِ وَفِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَهُمْ أَنَّهُ الْحَقُّ ۗ أَوَلَمْ يَكْفِ بِرَبِّكَ أَنَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXWhcQw4e6o&amp;t=41m53s"">41:53</a>. It means : “We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth. But is it not sufficient concerning your Lord that He is, over all things, a Witness? “ . So you are traveling in the horizons , you should think also of traveling inside your self. If you want to do it, it is also open. By the way, the shrines you visited are really palaces for those who travel inside themselves . I share with you a tip that I found very useful during my own travels. In your travels search for the imam of the mosque, and ask them is there a famous living Sufi sheikh in their locality. If you are lucky , you will find one. If you find them ask them to give you the keys to the inwards traveling in oneself. You can also mention to them the above mentioned Quran verse. Wish you all the best and a happy new year 2020.",h sherief,2019-12-29T01:27:00Z,0

"Good vlog. But sad how people worship and venerate the dead. Worshipping the grave etc. It&#39;s the ultimate greatest crime and sin, ever. Imagine, killing just one person or even millions. Imagine committing adultery, stealing, etc. These are nothing compared to Shirk, worshipping other than the one true God. Worshipping and calling upon the dead, idols, Prophets, Jesus, the Sun, moon, stars, lakes, forest, animals etc worshipping creations is the ultimate crime and sin in the eyes of Allah, the One true God, Creator and sustainer of all that exists. It is in our best interest not to die upon worshipping other than God, committing Shirk",Jameel Subhan,2019-04-07T15:54:02Z,0

The battlements of Ranikot formed the last capital of the Amirs of Sind, when they were brought under the colonial rule of the British Empire.[11] Radiocarbon tests were conducted at the Sann Gate on the charcoal embedded in the mortar of a collapsed pillar of the eastern gate of the fort.

@Ann Talpur they project other provinces positively but when it comes to Sindh only negative news. In reality KPK is much more corrupt than Sindh and even Punjab.,angel Talib,2019-01-31T10:29:22Z,1
@angel Talib  Sindh &#39;s Thar Desert is also big &amp; great &amp; mystic ! True that Media is occupied by anti Sindh morons they cant see the beauty  that could be seen by a non biased person ! Eva is love that&#39;s why she could see the love of Sindh and love of its people,Ann Talpur,2019-01-29T00:20:04Z,3

"Dear Eva, thank you so much for bringing to us another gem of a story filled with passion and love for the people and places around you. I am truly amazed by the richness and diversity of Sindh. Being a Pakistani, I had still no clue  how diverse, full of ancient beauty this country is. When history will be written, a young lady named Eva will be remembered for bringing this globally misunderstood country back to the global stage, while it was still emerging to become the country it was meant to be. What makes you so different from other storytellers is that you speak with your heart and soul.",Aiza Khan,2019-01-22T16:43:05Z,250
