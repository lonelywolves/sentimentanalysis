"Eva zu Beck....that was a tremendous accomplishment, particularly with temperatures of about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. I have done 25 marathons, and live in Las Vegas, and have run in Death Valley when it was 130, and did some long runs when it was around 100 degrees, but never beyond 14 or so miles. For it to be that hot for you after 20 miles, where you finished in good form was just astounding. If you ever want to go out to Death Valley in July, let me know, as running on the salt flats in a valley between mountain ranges of all kinds of coloration is quite an experience...especially when it is 120 degrees or better.  However, they have (or had) a marathon in December, and it was really nice. Eva zu Beck....you are stronger than you know you are. If you do some good long runs, and maybe run in cooler temps, you will be fast. Lots of good wishes for you.",Randy Lazer,2020-02-13T19:14:03Z,0

"You could use { Hawler } next time when you talk about Erbil because Kurdish they call it like that !! I am telling you that because I see you like kurdish language 😊. And it&#39;s interesting you use some Kurdish phrases or some words in your vlogs.... I would I could run overthere as you did but I can&#39;t come back to Iraqi Kurdistan unfortunately. Anyhow enjoy your time there. They&#39;re really friendly and kind people living there!! I really like your videos you&#39;re a successful youtuber, well done.

"Your marathon reminds me my only Marathon in the mid 80&#39;s in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (when I was young).  It took me almost 5 hours.  In my opinion, it was a little boring, since only 68 people were in the race.  After half an hour, I hardly see any other runners.  After that, I ran my only half Marathon in Taipei, Taiwan, where I come from.  It was very different.  There were thousands of runners and watchers.  I felt quite excited.<br />Eva, It is fun to watch your videos and your trips.  I hope one day you you can visit Taiwan and run one of the marathons there.   You probably won&#39;t need to bring water/food for the race, as it will typically be provided.",Wii Fit,2019-11-04T01:31:01Z,0
I love your videos Eva. If you&#39;re ever in Oregon during the summer. The Oregon country fair is out of this world amazing. next year will be year 15 for me. check it out if you have the time. Thanks again for the inspiration at every turn. You&#39;re beautiful.,R. Lee,2019-11-03T23:07:19Z,0

Great video and great achievement. Congrats Eva. I wish they have provided more water stations and blocked the entire road during the marathon time :/<br /><br /><br />I think we are too spoiled in NYC. We have a water station every mile in all races regardless of the distance. Hopefully this will be the case in all other races around the world :),syria2002,2019-11-03T22:09:47Z,0

Really if it is your first time to run such a long distance ?

One way to challenge a travel addict like me is if I incorporate travel in my bucket list challenges like running a marathon :) because if I just do it at my home country or even for a cause, a travel addict is not motivated enough nor strong enough to do it :) but perhaps if someone ask me to do it in a exotic place like Iraq Kurdistan?.... I might say yes... hell why not? ha ha ha. Congratulations!",Tess The Travel Addict,2019-11-02T17:30:46Z,0

"Kurdistan is part of Iraq, and you should be proud to be Iraqis.  Iraq is the main ancient land aka Mesopotamia before the Kurd race was born...Kurdistan was never a Country and never will be, because if it gets Independant it will create choas in other Countries that have Kurd minorities such as Turkey, Iran and Syria..it will be very bad for the Kurds  if they gain their Independence, the Kurds should never think about Independence, because the outcome will be severe for them..The criminal USA will not come to your rescue if Turkey invades you( Turkey has about 15 million Kurds, they would want Independence too, which Turkey will never allow)...By the way I am from Iraq and know History very well...Historically,  Kurdistan region belonged to the ancient Assyrian minority whic stil live in Northern Iraq scattered in small villages and towns, their land was stolen by the Kurds...No hate here but these are facts, and Truth of course hurts sometimes...I suggest you read some History and educate yourselves before claiming that Kurdistan should get Independence...I know a lot of Kurds will disagree with my comment , but  this is the Truth...Salam/ Peace to you all...",SharpeVision رحال,2019-11-02T08:21:22Z,0

I know how brutal it can be running in 38 Celsius heat (and that was without cars directly behind me or holding a camera lol) - I used to be able to do it when I was younger but now it is no longer sensible to do - so I congratulate you on this wonderful achievement.  I would be curious to know how long it took for the pain to wear off.,robatsea2009,2019-11-01T21:22:30Z,1

"Congratulations! Sounds you didn&#39;t train very well, never before run more than 23km:) I once trained to run the marathon, two year project, aiming at less than 4 hours. It went so well I decided to push it and do it in a year, with the result I injured myself..... As the sense of it being a challenge gone (now it feels easy if I put in the time and discipline and don&#39;t injure myself)  never restarted the training. So never ran a marathon but done several marathon+ distance day hikes. (Somewhere in the back of my mind I feel I should finish the job)",silent willy,2019-11-01T16:59:49Z,1

"Kurdistan is part of Iraq, and you should be proud to be Iraqis.  Iraq is the main ancient land aka Mesopotamia before the Kurd race was born...Kurdistan was never a Country and never will be, because if it gets Independant it will create choas in other Countries that have Kurd minorities such as Turkey, Iran and Syria..it will be very bad for the Kurds  if they gain their Independence, the Kurds should never think about Independence, because the outcome will be severe for them..The criminal USA will not come to your rescue if Turkey invades you( Turkey has about 15 million Kurds, they would want Independence too, which Turkey will never allow)...By the way I am from Iraq and know History very well...Historically,  Kurdistan region belonged to the ancient Assyrian minority whic stil live in Northern Iraq scattered in small villages and towns, their land was stolen by the Kurds...No hate here but these are facts, and Truth of course hurts sometimes...I suggest you read some History and educate yourselves before claiming that Kurdistan should get Independence...I know a lot of Kurds will disagree with my comment , but  this is the Truth...Salam/ Peace to you all...",SharpeVision رحال,2019-11-02T08:17:18Z,0
