"It bothers me to no end when people stop in some random bistro in Bucharest, and ask for the &quot;traditional&quot; experience. THIS is the traditional experience. Even I, as a guy that lived in this country for 42 years now... have not experienced this level of ... traditionalism. You read about it. You see it from the car window, or train window. You see the sheep moving on the mountain. And the dogs. Always those dogs. They are amazing. <br /><br />some people say they come for scraps. they don&#39;t. they are used with the environment and are guarding people that are passing by. they are the police of the wild places. and their level of competence is amazing. There&#39;s that bit about the wolves. Yes there are wolves. And bears. And foxes. And another cat like animal called a &quot;jder&quot;. Google translate calls it a marten. I don&#39;t know how you would translate that because it&#39;s a local animal, only present in our country so never thought about it. But anyway... those dogs know their duty very very very well. <br /><br />And the last bit, Romania is a country of contradictions. I was sure by the end of it, the same person that made the cheese, will be on a phone clicking away. Some people reject technology. Some people just happen to live on a mountain. BTW, you should always expect internet and 4g and wireless to work flawlessly in Romania. People may change. Yes,  it&#39;s not the best of lives up there on the mountain. But it is a life, for so many creatures. Not just us humans. the dogs, the sheep. they been doing that for hundreds of years. if not thousands of years. same dogs. same sheep. same shepherd.  same mountains. now with internet and smart phones. which is funny, because, living here, I know we have more internet than electricity. In some places, you might as well have perfect internet, but if you don&#39;t have good battery, good luck using that internet. <br /><br />What amazes me about these videos is your batteries. In those places?! I really don&#39;t know how you pulled it off.",axl the slacker,2020-10-24T00:05:08Z,1
"There are endless small &quot;countries&quot; in Romanian Carpathians, usually corresponding to a depression, each with a distinct cultural - ethnographic identity and different type of geology, vegetation, landscapes.

"Fantastic to see sheep stations in the Mountains of Romania Eva, I have lived, worked, in many throughout the South Island of NZ. I had an old hut 3 and a half miles from the Mt Cook road and crossed 3 rivers to get to it. To get supplies I left at 4am and walked 12 miles to get supplies, crawl through a window in a friend&#39;s house to sleep. On return climbing to 6000 feet in the mountains, sleeping up there with deer and chamois before returning to my oasis......with a camera, and watercolors. I too have Gold in my teeth. thanks blessed........",Robin Smith,2020-10-04T16:11:29Z,0

"@ Pantibiblon  Noo... Those people are simple people, they don&#39;t have a high education + they speak in a dialect. Maramures is a border region, far from the capital Bucharest (where the literary language is spoken). I learned words from the local dialect at school.<br />I will watch the video once again focused on what the locals are talking about.<br />The dialect could have words of Slavic/Hungarian origin due to its proximity to Ukraine and Hungary.<br />However, Portuguese and Romanian are the most geographically distant of the Romance languages, it is normal to think that you do not understand.<br />In the written form of the Romanian language, you would surely understand more than 1%.
