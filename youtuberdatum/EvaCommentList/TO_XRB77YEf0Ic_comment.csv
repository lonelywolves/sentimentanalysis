"Who are the Kurds &quot;Indo European&quot;? Iraqis built your roads, let you speak your native language, let have your own pkk, puk, and peshmerga Militias. Let you have your courts, and schools that teach your lies, with your coward police the Asayish, let you even have your own corrupt Brazani Gov, so be thankful to Iraq, it let you be autonomous inside of the Iraqi borders &amp; Iraq protected you from the Turkish Jets. So just say thank you to them, or they have the power in their own Country the Republic of Iraq and can easily Defend themselves from the  &quot;Iraqi Kurdistani&#39;s&quot; and treat  them like Turkish Gov and Irani Gov treats their Kurdis. Use Kirkuk for an example, it only took 4 hours to retake it, using only 1 unit from ISOF! So shame on you, cowards for thinking tha we the Us Americans are going to come save Barzani, He was Saddam&#39;s little pet, your President Brazani betrayed you guys👣 Barzani was Saddam&#39;s informer, he was informing against the Sulemaniya kurds, because he was greedy, also your little hungry ass President Brazani betrayed you guys and helped Saddem and Chemical Ali gas the Halabaj Kurds, because they were helping Iran, you guys sold each other out, Funny to watch you Sorani&#39;s fighting vs the  Badni... you guys are a clown circus.

"This video was very enlightening, seems like a very great place! Where I live, there is a small immigrant community of Kurds with beautiful culture. Only thing I’ve noticed was a particular series of cases with catcalling, sleazy online behaviour and a kind of “overly thirsty” outlook towards women.

"Kurdistan is amazing region. I was born and raised there. The Kurds are amazing people. The Flute ( Ney), is a Persian invented instrument. It’s 5000 year old, which makes it the oldest instrument that is still in use. It has a sad sound that it exemplifies the sadness and pain. Its even mentioned in the middle-eastern poem with  ( pain of Ney), as reference to the depth of pain and sadness.",JASSOUR ALRIKABY,2020-06-13T14:15:35Z,0

Your Assyrian culture is not our Iranian/Kurdish culture, you are a foreign, conquered entity, and have been nearly totally absorbed.

Well Kurdistan does not exist legally. Even tho it should. But culturally it does. It is an autonomaous region of northern iraq. And depending on how Rojava goes there just might be a Kurdistan. Gender equality is a big deal in Kurdish culture and is very much promoted. I think you should go. Go to Erbil and see how things go. You will likely enjoy it.

So this video showed up a an ad on my YouTube as I am very interested in history of Anatolia and Persian also the middle east.<br /><br />One thing I realised about Kurdish culture is they copy a lot of other cultures to make it there own especially Turkic even with the clothes going back to the Seljuk Turkic and Persian Gypsy clothing.<br /><br />Further more the British or roman or crausaders however you view it would have liked out all the nations if it wasn’t for the Turkic ottoman empire and Mongolian empire<br /><br />However I can agree that Kurdish people are respectful and hard workers here in the UK especially but they talk really bad about other countries when I get my hair cut :( which is not good... <br /><br />I hope we seek peace in this world and everyone respects the history that made today!,James Edwards,2019-12-23T15:31:40Z,0

"if you think kurdish culture in erbil is cool than you definitely haven’t been to a mukrani kurdish city especially mahabad. actually the kurdish culture in bashur is quite assimilated with the neighboring arab culture while the mukrani (which is in rojhelat) region of kurdistan is the least assimilated and having only a little bit of influence from persians such as proper sanitary and certain types of art. we also still wear the medieval style of kurdish dresses. mahabad is a city of amazing history and harbors a beautiful mountainous scenery, however the city is not found on any online map due to iran’s political fear however you can still find it on satellite maps such as google earth as a visibly urban yet unlabeled area of north western iran. also kurdish villages (in general not just in mukran) are usually the most authentic and traditional places in kurdistan to visit. one more thing, if you go done the road in mahabad, the east side of the mahabad dam, you will find the BEST villages and amazing fish farms. take mukran as a visit ☀️",i_deeyad,2019-12-23T09:21:30Z,18

Hungarians are near relatives of turks, in your words mongolians. Their language has the familiar grammar structure and there are many common words. For instance, The origin of “coach” is hungarian  word of “kocs”.  The equivalent of that is the turkish word “Koç” means ram. You know ram always lead the crowd of sheeps. So the word coach is turkish.  In your words there is not a language of turks..😉",sinan ak,2020-09-25T17:16:00Z,1

What she doesn’t get is a lot of the men standing around her are only interested because she is young and pretty and sorry a lot of them don’t have the beta intentions. While Kurdistan isn’t Iraq the culture of how men and women are are VERY similar and a lot of the tea shops girls don’t even go into. All the men of course will be nice and she isn’t interacting with any women. And you need to be careful about where your filming and who. Don’t walk into random tea shops and start filming random men. Big no no. I am your age and American and I currently live in Kurdistan and I’m not Kurdish.,coco marineblu,2019-12-18T07:01:31Z,0

"i admit that these countries like iraqi and co has his beautiful sites and the most people there have good intentions. but anyway these countries are still under construction and probably (tell me if iam wrong) they dont even have a stable infrastructure yet and probably not even police. so its just a little insane to go there especially alone as a woman. 99,9% of the people there are nice but 0,1% is enough. who you will call? the ypg? but tell me if iam wrong. anyway you do a great job and show people the good sites of some &quot;bad known&quot; countries. i knew that iraqi is not so &quot;ugly&quot; how the media told us. but i didnt know how beautiful it really is. but iam still a little worried about your trip. take care :)",Αρβανίτες Βόρεια Ήπειρος,2019-12-17T00:54:57Z,0

"Great. But, two things: I think the tea house you call Mam Kalili (?) Or really Mam Khaleel, is Michko place/tea house. Hawleris call it, Chaykhaney Michko (Michko&#39;s tea house). Also, although they drink very sweet teach, because the tea is so strong, you can ask for tea without sugar, in Kurdish say, Be Shakr (without shakr/suger); you&#39;ll have it.

@JonHatesStarWars Kurds are Iranian bedouins who travelled wherever green pastures existed. The ones in Syria were mostly refugees fleeing Turkey. They have no claim for no territory and  specially in Syria.,Pooyan Matin,2019-12-10T12:27:27Z,0
"@Pooyan Matin ...you do know that a large portion of Kurds originated in what is now known as Syria, but before the founding of the country, right?  They have just as much claim to the land as anyone else.  They&#39;ve also a legitimate claim to parts of Iraq, which is why Iraqi Kurdistan exists.  If I had to guess, you&#39;re either Turkish or Syrian and hate the Kurds because you&#39;ve been raised to do so.  It&#39;s a shame if that&#39;s the case, as your phobias are prohibiting you from experiencing a lovely and ancient culture and people.",JonHatesStarWars,2019-12-10T05:51:22Z,1
