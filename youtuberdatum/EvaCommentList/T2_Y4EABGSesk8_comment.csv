"Eek! (You can turn on the subtitles if you like - there&#39;s a lot of wind noise in places!) I&#39;m so so excited for you to see this adventure. It took me 10 months to catch up on the edit - I was in Mauritania in early January 2020. But it&#39;s finally here, woop woop! ❤️ So - can you relate to the way I describe adventure, and why we travel?",Eva zu Beck,2020-11-21T14:02:42Z,375
Why do you do this? To get attention... plain and simple.<br /><br />If you wanted to feel raw and get in touch with yourself you&#39;d discretely volunteer at a hospice facility or a women&#39;s shelter or a clinic which serves poor community.,Ceez B,2021-04-12T01:59:56Z,1
National Geographic did this last year... check out their video which is very well done. Most locals ride this train to the village by the quarry.<br /><br />This train makes a few stops along the way and is the only supply for food/water/resources to land locked villages in the middle of the desert.,Ceez B,2021-04-12T01:51:30Z,1

I live in Spain and love it so much the only places I have travelled since I am here r Azerbaijan for ten days and Budapest. But by the time I was thirty four I was an extremely well traveled person and had been on this cargo train without paying on top of iron ore. I got on it in the middle of the Sahara on its halfway journey at 2am. But at the time it was regarded as a normal slightly offbeat thing to do recommended by the lonely planet. Now u can&#39;t find up to date travel guides abouts Mauritania because of terrorism,Michelle de la Giroday,2021-04-20T22:23:14Z,0

"@Dr Satinder travel and lifestyle husband can marry up to 4. But there is reasoning behind this. <br />It’s better to marry women than to sleep around. It’s much better. How do you judge?<br /><br />And also, you have no idea what your talking about the divorce.. <br /><br />Go to this channel - “Hamza’s den”. <br />They invite non Muslims for conversation. You can question them and bring your issues with Islam. They will most definitely invite you inshallaha if you ask them in the chat.<br /><br />I do not want to debate here. Go to the panel and have a discussion with them.",Hamza Khan,2021-04-04T14:54:31Z,0

"Haha what a JOKE!<br />If you were in Middle East, you would wish you were women! <br />They are so well-treated. Well-payed. Well-respected. Than any country in the world - By Far.<br /><br />Also, in Islam, woman has more rights. Woman has more rights in Islam than all religions combined but you do not know that because you get your news from FOX news<br /><br />What you call &quot;freedom&quot; is not freedom. You just want women to be wild. Thats &quot;freedom&quot; in your head. Women in Islam are happy to cover themselves. Its to guard chastity, their honor, their beauty. Clearly, logically, they are more of higher status than any other women becauuse they sure are treated like it.",Hamza Khan,2021-04-03T04:16:41Z,0

Also so many Americans now wear Canadian patches or British on their jacked when they travel, when asked if they cant produce a valid passport they are tortured for weeks for such deception. Also cover your head, some men will ask other will literally throw you to the ground and spit on you or worse. its not safe out of site or a night without head covered.",maegap96,2021-03-18T12:43:36Z,1

"Wow... I spent 14 hours with my sister on a bus from Astana ( Kazakhstan) to Chimkent / Tashkent border in summer 2019 in scorching August heat. The ventilation was literally open windows and doors only. At some parts of the route there was no road, just dirt. Toilets outside were locked overnight, no toilet in the bus. Our feet were really swollen after the trip. I chose this option because it was very cheap.  if we took the train,( which cost 4 times more) then we would have to transfer to bus to get to the border anyways, and it would take longer time too. I wanted to see the steppes, well I had my fill))) I thought I was hardcore, but this is really crazy! Glad you had a company and were safe)))",jane jones,2021-03-02T22:13:41Z,0

"That is INSANE countryside. I work for a North American railroad, and to me this looks like railroading on Mars! I kept expecting to see the Perseverance rover popping up somewhere in the background. If you&#39;re going to do this my advice is to try and choose a car up as close to the head end as you can. It&#39;ll be less dusty there, and the ride will be a LOT smoother. Trust me on this! lol!",Paul Brochner,2021-02-28T06:35:23Z,0

"What was the purpose of this? What service did you provide to others? What good did you accomplish for anyone except your own irresponsible, selfish desire for “adventure”? Better to have offered rides to the people who through necessity, risk life and limb just to get to their jobs. Instead, you treat it as a lark, a vain indulgence driven by childish notions of “Freedom”. Please get a job and contribute something of substance to humanity.",Leo Hernandez,2020-12-02T00:58:25Z,0

"I did the same trip as her back in 2003, there is a passenger carriage among all the iron ore bucket but you have to pay. The trip from Nouadibou to Zouerate in an empty bucket was brutal, I barely slept and was covered i iron ore dust in the morning. I choose to ride in the passenger carriage on the way back. It was fun but I would not do it again. Mauritania is a hell hole, it is as close as Mad Max as anything can be, why anyone leaves there can only be explained by bad luck.",Jean Dubois,2020-11-28T23:25:50Z,0

"👋🏻Thank you for asking for others input about the last portion of the video. I love to travel as well and think it is so important for others to travel and experience different cultures and social structures. And I am someone who thrives when I am moving and exploring. With that said this year of isolation has been the biggest adventure of my life. it is hard to sit still but when i look within during this time and learn how I can adapt to this temporary life style for the protection of others I find new strength and new adventures with myself. I live in America and I have seen and experienced the damage it has caused on people’s livelihoods. Businesses have closed, jobs have been lost. But most of all I have seen the damage in numbers of deaths and especially within minorities who are out there still working because the lowest paying jobs are frequently essential jobs. So when I have the urge to travel I Try to look for how my actions could harm others. I consider: who am I not seeing that is being harmed? Who is unrepresented and looked over that could be effective by my Decisions? With that I would like to say I understand where you are coming from and I can see how much you love and thrive when exploring. And I ask that you consider the challenge of staying in place a bit more and seeing how your life could shift and grow when taking on that adaptation, just as you do when you experience a new culture or way of life.",Sophia Valli,2020-11-26T01:16:30Z,1

I love your videos!! I’ve learned so much about other cultures and countries and hope to visit a few in my lifetime. The Middle East and vicinity are my faves (I have some ME and Saudi ancestry so that might be why). These countries are not dangerous contrary to what most people believe. But some adventures could be! I have to say I was nervous watching you guys in that car! Any shift of its contents could have been dangerous!! Oh my nerves!😊,mama byrd,2020-11-25T07:39:16Z,0

Sleeping on iron ore???I&#39;d never walk right again :)   After years of being in the Army as a medic, I knew it wasnt for me. Going without a shower for days... Weeks at a time? It stopped being fun. Actually it was never fun. I became a firefighter and was always dirty then too, but at least I could wash up every once in a while.
