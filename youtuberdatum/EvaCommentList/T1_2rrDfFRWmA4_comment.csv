"I had expirences with jinn before i reverted to islam Alhamdelillah. The reason why i reverted was because after sincerely calling out to what I thought was God at the time, a muslim came into my life. I told them my past experiences and they automatically showed me the quran- surah Jinn...i encourage anyone, especially anyone whos had expirences or is interested to read this. Changed my life and i was not religious at allllll before this. Gave me real answers, science and  medicine have proven that the quran is about 80% correct so far. Thats enough for me Alhamdelillah.

Us humans are not the only creations. So if we notice supernatural powers around us, we shouldn&#39;t be surprised. Jinns are everywhere, they marry and reproduce.

"This is no ghost, it&#39;s a jinn and they are real.<br />Islam tells us they reside in abandoned places, they should not be disturbed.<br />Also if your (imanak) is strong they wont do anything to you, lay your trust on allah.<br />If you encounter a jinn (very low possibility), dont be scared say this <br />بسم الله انا عبد الله اخرج عدوا الله<br />In the name of God, I am God&#39;s slave, get out enemy of God<br />They will be running.","me channel ded and, cringe",2021-03-09T13:41:27Z,1

"Hi eva, im from indonesia. those are common things here. I do like supernatural things. FYi, when you come to a place like that, you feel like suddenly queasiness, headache, backhurt, it means that &quot;they&quot; try to get into your body. And when you felt suddenly difficult to breath, that means they are alot arround you. Like or not, believe or not, we are sharing places with them, but different dimension",Ken Arok,2021-03-02T09:23:23Z,0
But how could they get into our body if they are in different dimension? I&#39;m trying to get the sense of it. Are the symptoms or feelings that you mentioned related to a person&#39;s subconscious state of fear instead of being related to the &#39;presence&#39;?

@Midhat Fatima and sister you should avoid watching these because you are more vulnerable and they have history of attacking women and they gather around when you talk<br /> about them and they see you from where we can&#39;t.

True story<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtfXESy3ENw"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtfXESy3ENw</a><br /><br />The fortune-teller (magician) is very dangerous. How do you know it:<br />1. He can fly or walk on water or show you a lion or anything<br /> Although it does not exist<br />2. He can tell you what you ate, where you came from, your name, where you live, and he does not know you at all (how did he know? From the jinn)<br />3. He says incomprehensible spells (words)<br />All these things we know and the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, told us many things in the world of the jinn.<br />And he told us dhikr to protect from the jinn and magicians (the fortune-teller)<br />The jinn is affected by hearing the Noble Qur’an. This photography is famous in Saudi Arabia.<br />His actions indicate that he is possessed by the jinn<br />This scene is in a Tarawih prayer at the Sheikh Nasser Al-Qatami Mosque<br /> (Screaming jinn)<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghDhm7RXKzM"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghDhm7RXKzM</a><br /><br />To clarify: The jinn is very affected by hearing the Qur’an and does not tolerate Surat Al-Baqarah.<br />When he calls on the elders to cure the possessed with magic, the jinn scream<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M2NsvAX9UU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M2NsvAX9UU</a><br /><br />The jinn asks the Sheikh not to invite the enchanted to be cured by the jinn. Sheikh Raad Al-Kurdi repeats several times to heal the enchanted from the jinn after hearing the screams of the jinn<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF3ETf3NMXg"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF3ETf3NMXg</a><br />The verses of magic are influenced by the jinn .. This is a recitation from the story of the Prophet Solomon and the jinn .. The screaming of the jinn in the mosque<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hq8i2G1dpg"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hq8i2G1dpg</a><br /><br />Information: The jinn are in a state of weakness in the month of Ramadan .. because a Muslim afflicted with witchcraft approaches God through fasting and obedience like Tarawih prayer .. The jinn cannot tolerate that because being close to God weakens him<br />This raqi sharei damages magic action and is black magic.<br />Whoever cries is a jinn who does not want to get out of the enchanted body<br />Jann curses Alraaqi (Sheikh)<br />Magic work requires getting anything for the enchanted person so watch the personal photo they got for the young man&#39;s magic<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8rbd2vcWIE"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8rbd2vcWIE</a><br />Surat Al-Baqara is the strongest protection to drive demons and jinn out of the body and the home<br /><br /><br />The jinn affects the memory, mind, imagination and madness of a person, as well as in loving someone who hates him and vice versa, as well as in killing by means of black magic.<br />Usually a witch is the one who asks that from the jinn because people go to magicians in order to harm people because of love or extreme ball<br /><br />Al-Roqya Lecture Series - Sheikh Khalid Al-Hibshi<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXU5QCTglM0&amp;list=PLjzdVewCEl4iCGguslTchb7Bz4eXdCVSx"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXU5QCTglM0&amp;list=PLjzdVewCEl4iCGguslTchb7Bz4eXdCVSx</a><br /><br />We Muslims have ADKAR for protection from the jinn when entering the bathroom, in sleep, after Asr and Fajr prayers, or when traveling.  But if we hear the sounds and movements of the jinn in the house, we Audio playback  Surat Al-Baqara Or we read of Surat Al-Baqara at home<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxxin8IJOqY"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxxin8IJOqY</a><br /><br />Several years ago, a frightening and powerful stone throwing sound would come inside my house several times<br />At first he thought she was one of the neighbors&#39; children<br />But I discovered that she was from the jinn because there was no stone or children near my house<br />When I raised the voice of the Qur’an to Surat Al-Baqarah several times, we no longer heard the sounds of stone throwing.<br /><br />And again I played the sound of Surat Al-Jinn while I was lying down, and I hissed in my ears of the Jinn before going to sleep, so I changed the surah to Surat Al-Baqarah. Because the Prophet Muhammad told us that the jinn escape from Surat Al-Baqarah, and indeed his name is no longer a whisper in my ears of the jinn telling me<br /><br /> A final explanation: Humans cannot see the jinn in their true form and they are an invisible world, so what you see are fabricated movies. The dwelling places of the jinn are tombs, deserts, baths, and abandoned dwellings<br />and The world of jinn loves naked women<br />The jinn have different abilities and strength .. Sometimes the great aldhikr is what expels them from your harm, and Surat al-Baqarah expels them if they are in the house or the body .. And the morning remembrances there is a mention we say that protects us from the domination of the jinn on us who wants to harm us.  We say aldhikr when traveling, entering the bathroom, after prayers, when entering the house, when having sex with one&#39;s wife, when undressing, etc.<br />Jinn is a hidden world but very harmful to those who do not guard against it.<br />Some jinn try to waste travelers in the deserts, whether by showing a strong light (a flashlight) or a car that walks and disappears. Some travelers have died from jinn tricks, which are spread in the deserts of Saudi Arabia<br />Watch it below<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5xsuSmFg4A"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5xsuSmFg4A</a><br />We call this jin a lantern father<br /> (Abu Fanous)Do you see the car that vanished? They want to waste travelers (from the methods of the jinn)<br /> This type of jinn is called alghylan ( الغيلان ) and the Prophet Muhammad mentioned it and told us that we say Azan to pray in order to expel it.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g6W6OS7U8s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g6W6OS7U8s</a>",عبدالله,2020-12-21T23:23:15Z,1

"they exist but they are not what you think...<br />the story before creation, Lucifer was a top angel, knew everything but wasn&#39;t worshipped like god is. there was a sin created by Lucifer, he also talked 1/3rd of the angels to follow him.. well the story goes that Lucifer and the angels were kicked out of heaven. <br />god created the earth and the only place Lucifer (now his worldly name is satan) was allowed in the tree of knowledge of good and evil, well they sinned, Adam forfeited the dominion over the land and satan and his demon angels that also fell from heaven are here temptation, sin, lies, murder, all these things are influenced by satan. <br />seeing ghosts are just the demons playing tricks and wanting you to think that ghost exists. just like clairvoyant, voodoo, witches believe in dieties, gods and goddesses, its a real realm but all we can do is recognise evil and where its coming from.<br /><br />these demons can enter you,  touch you, they bring more evil spirits into you and trick you.. they are spiritual beings, they are not dead people coming out to haunt you..<br /> but they can only be removed by prayer and asking for the removal from the creator God.. Ephesians 6 god gives you his armour, ask for it daily.. I do it morning and night.<br /><br />honestly, go there during the day because if its haunted they will be there during the daylight, they just don&#39;t come out at night..<br />ive had clocks stop in my home, yes all my clocks stopped at the same time. they harass me, wearing a head cover also I feel gods protection.. <br />just sharing.. I was a ex white solitary witch, now walk with my brother Jesus.. I worked for satan, I now belong to my creator.. 🙏💙🦋🌸😎",Levi Daisy young,2020-12-02T01:54:32Z,0

I&#39;d been working in Bahrain for nine years and in my first job I&#39;d experience a lot of creepy things in my old accommodation, seeing old lady wearing Abaya, falling of things, turning off our flat lights whenever I&#39;m alone.. And the very bad thing exsorcism almost happened to me but with the help of Qoran and Islamic prayers I got saved.. when I leave my room and change it coz I cannot bare anymore what was happening on that flat, another person took that room and he was a new staff and he don&#39;t have an idea about my history on that room.. One day, we all got shocked and all of my colleagues believed me when that man who stayed in my old room passed away.... So creepy but it&#39;s true..

"Eternal life is  only in Jesus Christ and in no one else. Now in order have eternal life Say this prayer: Lord Jesus Christ, today I receive you as my Lord and savior, forgive me of all my sins, I believe you died for me on the cross of Calvary so that I may not die in my sins. O Lord, write my name in the Lambs book of life.  Now get a bible, KJV and read it. Obey all the commandments of Jesus Christ. Your eternal security depends on this. You must confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe that God raised him from the dead and then you will be saved. Romans 10:9-10.

Philippians 2:5-7 - Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bond-servant, and coming in the likeness of men.  1 Timothy <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rrDfFRWmA4&amp;t=6m14s"">6:14</a>-16 - “our Lord Jesus Christ&#39;s appearing, which He will manifest in His own time, He who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or can see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen.”   Isaiah 9:6 - For unto us a Child is born, Unto us a Son is given; And the government will be upon His shoulder. And His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  john 1:1-4 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.2 The same was in the beginning with God.3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.4  In him was life; and the life was the light of men.  John 1: 14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

True story<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtfXESy3ENw"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtfXESy3ENw</a><br /><br />The fortune-teller (magician) is very dangerous. How do you know it:<br />1. He can fly or walk on water or show you a lion or anything<br /> Although it does not exist<br />2. He can tell you what you ate, where you came from, your name, where you live, and he does not know you at all (how did he know? From the jinn)<br />3. He says incomprehensible spells (words)<br />All these things we know and the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, told us many things in the world of the jinn.<br />And he told us dhikr to protect from the jinn and magicians (the fortune-teller)<br />The jinn is affected by hearing the Noble Qur’an. This photography is famous in Saudi Arabia.<br />His actions indicate that he is possessed by the jinn<br />This scene is in a Tarawih prayer at the Sheikh Nasser Al-Qatami Mosque<br /> (Screaming jinn)<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghDhm7RXKzM"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghDhm7RXKzM</a><br /><br />To clarify: The jinn is very affected by hearing the Qur’an and does not tolerate Surat Al-Baqarah.<br />When he calls on the elders to cure the possessed with magic, the jinn scream<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M2NsvAX9UU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M2NsvAX9UU</a><br /><br />The jinn asks the Sheikh not to invite the enchanted to be cured by the jinn. Sheikh Raad Al-Kurdi repeats several times to heal the enchanted from the jinn after hearing the screams of the jinn<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF3ETf3NMXg"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF3ETf3NMXg</a><br />The verses of magic are influenced by the jinn .. This is a recitation from the story of the Prophet Solomon and the jinn .. The screaming of the jinn in the mosque<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hq8i2G1dpg"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hq8i2G1dpg</a><br /><br />Information: The jinn are in a state of weakness in the month of Ramadan .. because a Muslim afflicted with witchcraft approaches God through fasting and obedience like Tarawih prayer .. The jinn cannot tolerate that because being close to God weakens him<br />This raqi sharei damages magic action and is black magic.<br />Whoever cries is a jinn who does not want to get out of the enchanted body<br />Jann curses Alraaqi (Sheikh)<br />Magic work requires getting anything for the enchanted person so watch the personal photo they got for the young man&#39;s magic<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8rbd2vcWIE"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8rbd2vcWIE</a><br />Surat Al-Baqara is the strongest protection to drive demons and jinn out of the body and the home<br /><br /><br />The jinn affects the memory, mind, imagination and madness of a person, as well as in loving someone who hates him and vice versa, as well as in killing by means of black magic.<br />Usually a witch is the one who asks that from the jinn because people go to magicians in order to harm people because of love or extreme ball<br /><br />Al-Roqya Lecture Series - Sheikh Khalid Al-Hibshi<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXU5QCTglM0&amp;list=PLjzdVewCEl4iCGguslTchb7Bz4eXdCVSx"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXU5QCTglM0&amp;list=PLjzdVewCEl4iCGguslTchb7Bz4eXdCVSx</a><br /><br />We Muslims have ADKAR for protection from the jinn when entering the bathroom, in sleep, after Asr and Fajr prayers, or when traveling.  But if we hear the sounds and movements of the jinn in the house, we Audio playback  Surat Al-Baqara Or we read of Surat Al-Baqara at home<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxxin8IJOqY"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yxxin8IJOqY</a><br /><br />Several years ago, a frightening and powerful stone throwing sound would come inside my house several times<br />At first he thought she was one of the neighbors&#39; children<br />But I discovered that she was from the jinn because there was no stone or children near my house<br />When I raised the voice of the Qur’an to Surat Al-Baqarah several times, we no longer heard the sounds of stone throwing.<br /><br />And again I played the sound of Surat Al-Jinn while I was lying down, and I hissed in my ears of the Jinn before going to sleep, so I changed the surah to Surat Al-Baqarah. Because the Prophet Muhammad told us that the jinn escape from Surat Al-Baqarah, and indeed his name is no longer a whisper in my ears of the jinn telling me<br /><br /> A final explanation: Humans cannot see the jinn in their true form and they are an invisible world, so what you see are fabricated movies. The dwelling places of the jinn are tombs, deserts, baths, and abandoned dwellings<br />and The world of jinn loves naked women<br />The jinn have different abilities and strength .. Sometimes the great aldhikr is what expels them from your harm, and Surat al-Baqarah expels them if they are in the house or the body .. And the morning remembrances there is a mention we say that protects us from the domination of the jinn on us who wants to harm us.  We say aldhikr when traveling, entering the bathroom, after prayers, when entering the house, when having sex with one&#39;s wife, when undressing, etc.<br />Jinn is a hidden world but very harmful to those who do not guard against it.<br />Some jinn try to waste travelers in the deserts, whether by showing a strong light (a flashlight) or a car that walks and disappears. Some travelers have died from jinn tricks, which are spread in the deserts of Saudi Arabia<br />Watch it below<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5xsuSmFg4A"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5xsuSmFg4A</a><br />We call this jin a lantern father<br /> (Abu Fanous)Do you see the car that vanished? They want to waste travelers (from the methods of the jinn)<br /> This type of jinn is called alghylan ( الغيلان ) and the Prophet Muhammad mentioned it and told us that we say Azan to pray in order to expel it.<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g6W6OS7U8s"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-g6W6OS7U8s</a>",عبدالله,2020-12-21T23:25:38Z,0

"What Abdullaah did was very idiotic in Islaam and he shouldn&#39;t be happy about it. He put you in danger. You might be happy but had it have turned out horribly, no one will be smiling. We&#39;ve been told not to fear jinns/ghosts but to seek protection in them from Allaah. We do not deliberately go out looking for them or haunting them. They are another of God&#39;s creation, like men, that should be left alone. There are good jinn and bad jinn. We are taught Islaamic words to protect ourselves from them and all dangers, by reading special prayers in the morning and evening. You dont know them, so you would have no protection. Hence, why I say that was idiotic of him. I&#39;m very disappointed as this goes against the teachings of our religion regarding jinns and how we should leave them alone.

"I don&#39;t know how serious you were about the ghosts, when making this video. I dont know what you expected the viewers to think, after watching it. But why promote the superstitions? You talk about how enlightening travelling is and how educating it is, and then you post this. Simply calling it &quot;urbex&quot;, which  what it clearly is, instead of ghost hunting would be so much better. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but to me, promoting superstitions is like promoting, say, stereotypes. It&#39;s just wrong.",Patryk Dąbkowski,2020-07-29T17:52:51Z,0

Look up Astral Projection, and learn it, and you&#39;ll be able to travel in the astral planes and see them.  They&#39;re energy beings, so they tend to shapeshift a lot.  And stay away from the lower realms within the 4th dimension, that&#39;s where the evil jinn reside, and if you&#39;re not spiritually prepared, and protected, you don&#39;t want to end up messing around with them, they can do you great harm.  Otherwise, it&#39;s unlike anything you&#39;ve ever experienced, and sorta preps you for the in between stage, between this life, and the next eternal life, or hereafter.",Glorious Quran,2020-05-05T19:22:16Z,1

"I&#39;ve had scary spiritual experiences and one that stands out, one Halloween I go to a book/music store where the alternative scene hung out too and I go straight for the music section and it wasn&#39;t long I get a feeling something is watching me or someone and it felt like a hateful glare, like they wanted to harm me, and I&#39;m thinking, great, I&#39;m gonna tell the creep off, and I turn around and there&#39;s only a table with a stack of Ouija boards, no people in that vicinity. I went and found my family and said, I&#39;ll wait in the car. On another note, I have read a book that I found romantic, it&#39;s called 4th Wish. I don&#39;t want to spoil the plot but it goes along with the video a bit but in a not scary way. Really great video. I&#39;m a science buff, and I dunno what to believe sometimes, but watch Ray Kurzweil talk about computronium. Then think heavenly Google Assistant and this being a test/simulation. Even Northrup Grumman has a lecture online about that. It shocked me I just did a Google search for it since I have a scientist I&#39;m acquainted with the co-authored books on the subject. You know though, even if this were only a simulation, what about hackers? Perhaps some evil is not from our creator? That really would worry me. I&#39;ll follow his first hunting channel. Sounds interesting. Oh and I&#39;ve had experiences as a child. Even in Utah as an adult. I&#39;m not super religious but this made me remember those experiences.

"They very easily fall in love with the  human kind, and that&#39;s when things can go wrong, when their world Collides with ours, they have their place on Earth and we ours, when our worlds collide be ready for a collision. I am very very learned in this subject and we are told not to go out of our way to look for them, they are everywhere and the main times they can attach themselves to us is in times of heightened emotions :    <br />1,   ANGER    2,  FEAR     3,  AROUSAL., we are giving prayers to protect ourselves from them and are told not to fear or worry about them in our day to day life, but ouija boards and going looking for them is putting yourselves in harms way. They also are not known for handling their emotions very well, which means that they overreact to certain things in an over irrational manner ie.. They have gone after people for running through a park at night or throwing things across the room, because it has hurt or killed their child for being trampled on or being hit by a flying object thrown across the room and hence the reason we should say BISMILLAH and make the announcement that you are throwing something across the room to your friend or family, so you should say, &quot;CATCH THIS REMOTE&quot; and say BISMILLAH when you throw the remote. Simple steps can protect us.",Abdul Waheed Mullick,2020-03-15T03:01:26Z,9

"actually, ghosts tend to go quiet when someone comes to their place for just a short time because these supernatural spirits tend to avoid humans or other beings BUT if you start to reside in their place for a long time like..more than a week or so then they start to do things to make you leave.<br /><br /><br />hence people who move to an apartment that is haunted tend to experience these phenomena with more severity than ghost hunters do, who just visit the place and then leave.",Dark Fairy,2020-03-08T09:38:38Z,62

"The story of this hospital, it was a donation from a businessman for his town, however he never legally give it to the ministry of health, after his death his son ask the ministry to buy the hospital from them. The ministry refused because at that time they had a lot of hospital in Riyadh and it was really far from Riyadh and there was no need for it, the only time they actually used it was during the Kuwait war, it was given for Kuwaitis. I want there twice to see if there is a ghost I didn’t see anything however the second time I want there a group of men sew me and start running a way, so I guess I was the only ghost in there and I confirm that I’m human.",sultan,2020-03-08T01:49:41Z,1

you dont expect to find jin in that place because they will find you . so go there many nights until you face one in their high active nights but other nights you may feel like someone is throwing a small stone at you or you hear some one is calling your name or like you hear some foot steps or a splash of water or like knocking on big drums like that not much,Hamid Hajri,2020-02-23T18:32:05Z,3

Do you really need to see a djinn ?   1- just roll your camera anywhere in day time specially close to public bathroom or wherever dogs ( Full black or just a black round on their foreheads)                                      2- play in big screen and watch the screen not the content there you will notice white round objects move vertically or horizontally and disappear.      3.It’s true room lights are flicker when jinns crosses lights.        4- djinn doesn’t have power to attack’s human but will annoy you while you sleep,eat and create issues between hub &amp; wife to isolate both to sleep separately then they will try to entertain both privately. If you really interested to see Djinn  then type 2nd December 2019 Makkah live ( changing black cover of Khawba) you can notice 2 white objects move vertically away from bottom of Khawba. Or contact me I will send you videos recorded by me or if don’t believe call me on video where you can see them on live between 6:00 pm to 8:00 pm ( I will be on duty before <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rrDfFRWmA4&amp;t=6m00s"">6:00</a>)  or just check a viral video on instagram that a son in law kept her Aunty on looked room  djinns are true and they slowly invaded the earth.",Zah 8442,2020-02-20T18:50:08Z,0

"As Moosleem(s), we follow the teachings of 124,000 prophets and apostles in Monotheism. And one part of the teachings is that there are Ghoeeb (Ghoib) World (a World that exists but average human can not see them, &#39;hidden&#39;), even as we speak, basically consists of Malaeekat (Angels) and Jeen or Djinn (Geenie), while in other terms, creatures like Virus, Bacteria, Quantum Physics world, unknown things to come, etc., can be called/considered Ghoeeb as well, until we can see/experience it. <br /><br />And about the Jeens or Djinns: quite the same as humans, they can be either Kafeer (Jeens that are Unbelievers of God, neglecting/do not accept Monotheism, a basic principle of Islaam) or Moosleem Jeen or Djinn. Kafeer Jeens or Djinns also called Shaitan(s) (Satan(s)). And their leader is Eeblees (or Iblis, or Devil, or Evil). And the so-called GHOST, SPIRIT, etc., basically are Jeens or Djinns (Geenies), usually the Kafeer ones. <br /><br />They live among us. Usually in remote areas (including neglected buildings, deep forest, deep ocean, remote desert, far-away mountains, and so on), some would live under the same roof with us. Can have peace with us, or disturbing us, even &#39;attacking&#39; us. If they disturb us (or worst), we can choose to drive them out. There are ways to do this. Just remember: human is not supposed to live with Kafeer Jeens or Djinns (Shaitan(s)/Satan(s), or worst: Eblees/Devil/Evil). There are very big risks in doing so. :)",ATM - Abu Taqi Mayestino,2020-02-18T10:57:56Z,0

"Do more research about jinns in Islam. You will shocked how descriptive they are defined. In Islam, JINNS can take on any form and they can show themselves to us according to their will but they cannot harm us physically or mentally. If you ever see that JINNS are coming near you, say &quot;Bismillah&quot;. JINNS can travel faster than the speed of light and they can go through physical objects because they are not made from material or flesh. They are made from smokeless fire. May Allah protect us from Jinns.",Danial Khan,2020-02-17T00:59:43Z,0
Hi Eva I&#39;m glad that nothing bad happened with you and your friends but please don&#39;t go to abandoned places again. Stay safe! I love watching your travel vlogs. By the way my dad and his friend saw a real pious JINN in a cemetery in Pakistan. The JINN was cleaning a grave in the cemetery and had a very long broom in his hands. It was a hot summer day around 3/4 pm when they looked at the never ending broom they ran away in seconds and didn&#39;t look back. The JINN was in human form they couldn&#39;t see his face bcoz of his height. It happened in 1950 or early 60&#39;s.<br />JINNS can change their appearance easily like animals especially cats etc,sarah saleem,2020-02-17T00:13:14Z,0

Two of the objects found were found in fossils of a primitive mammal.  They are 10,000-80,000 years old.  But the third item was shocking to researchers.  Carbon dating tests are two and a half million years old.<br /><br /> The amazing thing is that metallic aluminum-based materials have been built in the world for less than 200 years.  It is then that you find a piece of construction expertise that makes it clear that you are part of something.  That is two and a half million years old.<br /><br /> It was very light.  At first glance it looks like it was part of the ax.  The length was 20 cm;  12.5 cm.  Width 7 cm.  It was heavy.  There was also talk that it was part of a more sophisticated mechanical system.  For UFO experts, this news was a turning point for new theories.  There have been arguments ever since the plankton was used by aliens to reach Earth two million years ago.  This argument was reinforced by the fact that it was the type of metal that was never used in any technology on earth.<br /><br /> Opponents of it argued that it was part of the war plane and the remnants of a satellite project.  They tried to reinforce the argument by comparing images of similar devices.  Still, the researchers remained silent.  To this day, no one has answered.  There is no satisfactory answer in the description given of this item, which is housed in the historical museum in the Romanian city of Klush – Napoka.  The source is not clear.<br /> What would this be?<br /> <br /> All the findings in the news are true.  But the age of the metal part is a mistake.<br /><br /> The age of aluminum cannot be determined by carbon dosing.  There are some physical and chemical tests for that.<br /> It has been rumored that some other metals have been added to the aluminum.  That is why the metal has suddenly decomposed.<br /> .<br /> This metal part is likely the finger of an ancient earthworm.<br /><br /> The term &quot;primitive&quot; is within 50 to 200 years.<br /> Caterpillar made of aluminum alloys may have fallen off the ground by then.  Made of alloy, it melted suddenly.<br /><br /> There is no scientific proof yet of the discovery of flying spiders or aliens.",shone,2020-02-14T11:32:50Z,1

It&#39;s like they exist in another dimension, but they come to ours every so often, this to me is fascinating!. Anyways, i hope all of my research is correct, but if not, feel free to correct me, but this is what i&#39;ve read, so if you ever see one, according to legend, they are not really ghost, but they are in some ways, this is totally not what the western culture believes about ghosts, so in my opinion, it is fascinating.

BTW, We Muslims the more knowledgeable we get about the Unseen World the more immunized and protected we get (Thanks to God&#39;s Mercy, He has given us all the guidance i.e. (Quran and the Prophet&#39;s authentic teachings) to be able to connect all the &quot;dots&quot; regarding unsolved supernatural Questions (Aliens, UFO, Strange Entities, unanswered phenomena, Bermuda Triangle, black magic, Devil human possessions, Satanism… and many more).<br />Miss Eva! Being a hard core explorer always pushing the limits, If you really want miss to uncover all the secrets of the Unseen Realm and get the chance to explore another wonderful world or dimension which most humans are ignorant of then I recommend you miss to watch a very well built series named “The Jinn Series” by MercifulServant.  I promise Miss! It’s not creepy at all! “Ghosts” will have no more secrets for you.

Beside admiring  that you are so brave I still have to say you should not do that. There are illegals in KSA (eg did run away from their Icama holder) who need to hide from police and might stay there. Plus the police might not take it easy with a foreigner when they catch you.

If you persisted that feeling and stayed, that&#39;s when real paranormal stuff begins happening. <br /><br />First is emotional signalling... Then physical signallings...
