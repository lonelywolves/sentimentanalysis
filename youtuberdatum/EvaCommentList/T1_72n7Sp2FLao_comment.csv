I&#39;m from a punjabi family and yesterday I completely my 15 fast of Ramadan and I learn so many new things. When people say without water and food it&#39;s very difficult but trust me it&#39;s very beautiful and you can easily do it.,Meenakshi Vachher,2021-04-28T22:30:41Z,0

The more the West learns about Islam  the more their hostility will diminish and they too will gain the knowledge and benefit. Open your hearts and your mind will follow.

"Nice! I gave it a try in Afghanistan. I did not take food with me in the bus from Herat to Kabul. I did not want to disturb the others in the bus by eating while they were not allowed. What I did not know was that one was also not to supposed to drink. So when I took out my bottle and started to drink water the Afghan next to me said at once very exited: „Ramadan, Ramadan“ So I had to say: „You are Ramadan - I am not Ramadan“ for which I earned a big smile. When the time came on breaking their fast, the young people always wanted to provoke the Talibans. So they took out their melon. At once the Talibans got very upset. Since it is not allowed to touch any food while on fast, they all quickly throw their melon into my lap. Good that their was one person with no Ramadan. :-)",Trinity Inspiration,2021-03-29T18:17:29Z,0

"Absolutely rubbish reasons to fast. 1) So if a friend of yours has diabetes, are you going to eat a lot of sugar, put on a lot of weight and get diabetes just so you could relate to them on a personal level?<br />2) Aaah the most plausible Muslims defence. Fasting is good for health. Well, it isn&#39;t. Intermittent fasting doesn&#39;t involve staying hungry or without water for more than 21 hours a day (in some European countries) and you can drink water all along during intermittent fasting.<br />3) You don&#39;t need to train your mind by starving yourself. The key is to have fixed times to eat and a balanced diet.",Shan Khan,2021-01-30T10:11:21Z,0

"Fasting is not only limited to muslims. Orthodox christians also fast throughout the year. During lent, advent, apostles,  St. Mary and then on every wednesdays and fridays. Lent fasting is 50 days and the greatest fasting period of the year. It is strictly vegetarian with no eggs, meat, fish, oil or poultry.  This is the time of spiritual reflection.",Bumbles,2020-11-04T09:37:17Z,0

Islam actually teaches every muslim to be good and humble to everyone.<br />and thankful to GOD&#39;S which gives us the food and water to drink..<br />Besides that..FASTING is also GOOD for your HEALTH..because it teaches us to be strong of hunger and thirst in whatever condition...unless if you in  poor health condition..you are not allowed to Fast..<br />Fasting is actually.. controlling your<br />MIND<br />BODY <br /> SOUL<br />AND ALWAYS BE HUMBLE TO THE ALMIGHTY GOD...

Eva its not about fasting for ramadan its about fasting for god in ramadan and the best thing of ramadan in religious perpective that is a day called lailatul qadr a respectable night in which billions of angels comes down to earth like a shower of stone and in that day prayer benefit is 1 day=1000 month so this is a small example there is lots of stuff in this month u can get.,Qaiser Hussain,2020-06-28T20:37:06Z,0

"It must have been pretty boring to have roti in the middle of the night for Sahur and more roti for breaking your fast while could eat other things like Sandwich, Pizza, Lasagna, etc.<br /><br />But then again, you have remember what is the point of fasting? To refrain yourself from eating and drinking from dusk till dawn. You also need to remind yourself about the suffering of other people and to be grateful. Some people really are only eating roti or even worse, mashed leaves or mud because they can’t afford or couldn’t get any other foods. 😢",Muhammad Jamil,2020-06-20T04:06:28Z,0

I am not a muslim been working here in kuwait for 13 years...i decided to try fasting like them every ramadan. At first 4 years i started it for a week only then 2 weeks then just a few days missed.... 5th year  a week missed... 6th year  a fewdays but not equivalent to 1 week.... Now after that preceding years i just missed fasting during my period bcoz of uncomfortable dysmenorrhea although muslim women should not really fast during their period.this year i missed 2 days bcoz of my period.... 1 day with late lunch and another day water only till 11am bcoz of uncomfortable like dehydrated feeling... so i told  my fiancé i cheated 1.5days😂... Btw  i do ramadan fasting even before i met him. So he is not the reason. I also started reading quran in english lang.... Eid mubarak all... New suscriber here,Mayah Queen,2020-05-26T01:54:51Z,0

"Abstaining from food, water and intimacy is one thing, but doing Ramadan is another. Even not engaging in other sinful things such as smoking and telling lies or from not so sinful things such as engaging in meaningless discussions or endeavors is not doing Ramadan. Ramadan is the month of Quran. That is when it was revealed and Muslims read it especially so in Ramadan with contemplation during Taraweeh prayers. All of the fasting is to give you strength to do these prayers at night. The point is to gain Taqwa or Godliness. If Ramadan helps fight cancer or lose weight, that is beside the point. This is just my perspective. Don&#39;t forget there are six more days in Shawwal, the month after Ramadan, to complete the count of (30+6)x10=1 year (lunar calendar) in rewards.",Nacer Bou,2020-05-25T17:54:24Z,0

They don&#39;t eat any thing the whole days fasting but you may take  little  water only. <br />3. Only you and your creator  knows about it. The God of ISRAEL.  HASHEM &quot;ADONAI&quot;<br />4.

"1. Fasting is a one of good shapes of worship to Allah SWT.<br />2. Fasting is good for health; it reduces cholesterol, calories, sugar, domesticating cells of cancer, and other good things. It also preserves the youth, and retarding the ageing process. It will be preferable, if we replenish it with mild exercises before breaking the fasting.<br />3. Fasting trains us to be social, to give dole and charity to dervish people and orphans.<br />4. Fasting trains us to be affable, patient, helpful, and humble in undertaking this life.<br />5. Fasting gives us happiness, peace, tranquility, and hope for better life.<br /><br />I am an Indonesian. Happy fasting to the world...",Azamor Muiza,2020-05-20T00:56:54Z,1

"Hi Eva, Ramadan has a different spirituality for a Muslim, it is not just food and drink you obstinate from, but also every temptation to do what is regarded as bad deed. besides trying to do all the good you can (this generally all the time for a Muslim but especially more enforced during Ramadan), ultimate goal is piety, being more righteous, a better human, better Muslim. When you do it for God&#39;s sake (showing obedience, fear, love, hope and so) it is totally different (ex: you are not trying to get healthy or so though it may happen in the process, but you are trying to please God by following his commands and guidance and be/do the best you can). If you want to connect deeper to your Muslim friends I suggest you study The Quran the life of the prophet (pbuh) and share aspects of your discoveries, and hopefully one day you will find that true connection of Islam that connects deep not just to your Muslim friends but rather to your soul.Thanks for the sharing.",M Saif,2020-05-17T18:09:01Z,0

"Dry fasting is generally good for the body. It’s essentially intermittent dry fasting. The fat cells are made of hydrogen molecules that bind to oxygen and your body produces its own water. Additionally it can dramatically reduce inflammation because that process requires water so it’s great for your general wellbeing, provided you eat sensibly at iftar. Although try to remember to embody your “highest self” be kind to others and give people the benefit of the doubt where possible, it can leave you feeling a lot more zen when the month is over. Best wishes Eva.",Ali Hussain,2020-05-16T15:54:51Z,0
"@Alev Orgiy I&#39;m not sure how you have perceived my comment as some sort of diss to Christianity. As for copy pasting, I dont mind what you think, you simply dont know enough about the subject matter for me to be perturbed. <br /><br />And what? you quote healthline which is an American publication, as if their profit inspired health system is to be taken as gospel. If you don&#39;t believe its good for health dont do it. I think it is, and I can cite sources but it wouldnt matter because you&#39;ve come to troll &amp; Im ok with that. <br /><br />I avoided talking about Christianity because there are a great number of sects within Christianity, Russian orthodox 7th day adventists, Roman Catholic, Evangelists &amp; yes some of them fast for long periods in the year but I was keen to avoid generalising because there is a lot of variance within the Christian religion, not because I have some sort of agenda against it.",Ali Hussain,2020-10-17T19:28:36Z,0
"@Alev Orgiy Well, Sharia Law is derived from the law of Moses, its not a secret. There is a lot of overlap, same prophets etc.  Copied? Jews fast twice a week (orthdox) Muslims are the only ones that do it for a month. And whether or not you believe or question the claims of Islam is not my business, I dont mind. If there is some good to be derived from any faith or culture especially for the body, it might be worth a try, doesnt mean i need to convert to Hinduism or whatever.",Ali Hussain,2020-10-16T19:12:54Z,0
"@Alev Orgiy look up &quot;dry fasting&quot; on the internet. If you look at the composition of fat at the molecular level, it is loaded with hydrogen, the body makes its own water by binding the hydrogen molecules with oxygen. You make your own water, and it is an accelerated version of water fasting. Besides its not done for days. I used to break my fast with water, and break it with food every alternate day.

"Masha Allah to all those fasting who are not Muslim 💖 just to clarify it’s not just abstaining from food or drink, also from anything bad or bad influencing towards sin. Example; swearing- no foul language, speak nicely. Be polite/ hold your anger- so hard when your hungry. Not looking at nakedness or partial nakedness.  We take this time where we force ourselves to control our hunger and thirst to control our actions and desires. The stomach is the hardest thing to control but once you can do that you will find you can control other desires too.",Jannah Murillo,2020-05-15T11:37:19Z,2

"Dear Ramadan, <br />Is the month of charity we pay 2.5 % our annual  income  to the poor and underprivileged. Biggest  gift to all living  beings  is water and muslims  won&#39;t  drink water  for almost 17 hours. By doing  this they will realise the importance  of water which is free gift to us. Once we take first sip of water after breaking  our fast we immediately  thanks god.",Hussam Uddin,2020-05-14T13:33:44Z,0
Did I just hear her say she is going to drink water?? 😂 In hot countries the test is the thirst not the hunger. In Asian countries and the Middle East people feel the fast more because of thirst.

"Am Muslim and now am fasting from 4:10 a.m to 7:30 p.m (~15 hours),  I feel tired between time to time, yet I feel more focused while reading or studying and belief it or not more energetic!, I run and play cardio at 7:00 p.m so no matter what am hungry or thirsty, I&#39;ll have my breakfast half hour later, it&#39;s really very healthy and effective.<br />Note: Actually in Ramadan you can&#39;t smoke or even have sex with your wife, it&#39;s not only the food",Anas Abu Alia,2020-05-14T11:32:33Z,7

It&#39;s nice that you want to try fasting. But it&#39;s not fasting if you drink water. If you&#39;re drinking and fasting then it takes away the meaning of fasting. I understand you&#39;re new at this so if you want to take it slow I would suggest that you fast one day properly then take rest the next day and again fast the day after. 🙂,Tanveer Noor,2020-05-14T03:42:48Z,0

"Sister Eva, I believe you might be an atheist, as you have mentioned you aren’t religious. Fasting with Prayers is mentioned in Holy Bible as well, if you are unaware what’s in the Holy Bible. People fast for 40 days until Easter Sunday, which is termed as “Lent”. I used to fast, during the day light, with no consumption of water. I break fast, with prayers and more inclined to what God said in Holy Bible. Also, I make sure nobody knows that I’m fasting, as God said, if we fast do not let others know. Fasting and prayers is meant for Almighty God in Heaven. Anyway, Lord Jesus bless you and show you what is meant to be right way in the eyes of God. Remember one thing, what a human brain can think of the powers of God the Creator, is nothing. Hence, have faith and believe. May the Holy Spirit guide you into spiritual world from the current vacuum world and let the Truth set you free.",Mitto M,2020-05-13T16:15:39Z,0

Because you said headache often. Try something called hijama it’s a bit like Chinese cupping but Chinese cupping is a temporary effect because once they remove the cups suction the dirty blood goes back to the body. but hijama more of taking out the dirty blood by Causing few scratch where the cup is applied. So the Dead blood from the surface comes out a few cups on your body one cup on your head. I used to get headaches a lot I tried it an never again headache. Just amazing. It has many different benefits. And our body is smart so you always make new blood,Journey Of my Soul.,2020-05-13T14:52:18Z,7
"Nayli Syazwina Believe me it helps with many different things,I even done it on my face. And you know when you have that softness an glow when one was a baby that came back as if I dun filling all over my face or something I don’t know how else to give Example. Imagine this When you have a full pot of water with a lid on. on top of the cooker an it boils at least the lid moves an comes out through the top. Our body can’t do that through the Summer so end of the winter an Beginning of the summer is best to do.I normally do it every six months. Also every toxic waste normally comes to the surface that would be the skin then the body will Absorb it Then it will go towards the organs and damage one from internal So better to take it out.  I can just go on with the list of benefits But if you google it it will show you anyway. (Hijama) lots of love 💕😊",Journey Of my Soul.,2020-05-15T07:34:53Z,0

So just research on religions and I pray for you that God show you the correct of Him and May He call you in His,plz just don&#39;t read it go research on religion because you would be reward more than our human scope if you follow the correct or else if you are following wrong path(path of evil/satan) then you would be burned in fire on day of judgement; so, choice is yours that what you what!",Aperna Kumari,2020-05-13T13:51:54Z,0

"Assalamu Alaikum, <br />Here&#39;s a good du&#39;a. <br /><br />These are a few things you may want to ask for in this blessed month of Ramadhan. <br /><br />&quot;Ya Rahman, Ya Raheem, Ya Rabb al Alameen, I call upon You and I ask You by every Name that You have named Yourself with, revealed in Your Book, taught any one of Your creation or kept unto Yourself in the knowledge of the unseen that is with You,<br /><br />Allahumma salli ala Muhammad wa ala ali Muhammad kama sallayta ala Ibraheem wa ala ali Ibraheem innaka hamidun majid. <br />Allahumma barik ala Muhammad wa ala ali Muhammad kama barakta ala Ibraheem wa ala ali Ibraheem innaka hamidun majid.<br /><br />Ya Rabb, make me sincere in this dua.<br /><br />Please grant me a death with the shahadah on my tongue. Grant me Husn al Dhan billah (good expectations from Allah)<br /><br />Expand my grave for me and illuminate it with light.<br /><br />Preserve my record in Illiyeen.<br /><br />Lighten for me the questioning of the grave.<br /><br />Grant me death in a state of Ibadah, that is most pleasing to You and resurrect me in the same state.<br /><br />Keep me free from fear, anxiety and terror from the day of judgement.<br /><br />Grant my book in my right hand.<br /><br />Make me among those who show their books to others with happiness.<br /><br />Make me successful in the Meezan. (scales) <br /><br />Help me cross the Siraat like lightning.<br /><br />Ya Allah, please do not give away my good deeds to others.<br /><br />Reunite me with my family in Jannah.<br /><br />Do not expose my faults in front of others on the day of judgement.<br /><br />Ya Afuw, Forgive the sins that I don&#39;t remember and the sins that I didn&#39;t even consider as sins.<br /><br />Grant me a heart filled with tranquility and peace.<br /><br />Cleanse my heart from malice, jealousy, hatred, self-admiration, show off, envy, arrogance and pride. <br /><br />Grant me the ability to forgive others.<br /><br />Grant me soft speech, protect my tongue from lying, backbiting and hurting others.<br /><br />Grant me beautiful patience.<br /><br />Grant me with the correct Aqeedah, excellent memory and understanding of the deen with daleel.<br /><br />Bless my parents, forgive them, Grant them good health and make me a sadaqa jaariyah for them.<br /><br />Bless my siblings in their marriages. Bind us together with love. Do not let shayaateen break our bond.<br /><br />Grant all the single Muslims the coolness of their eyes.<br /><br />Grant us righteous children and make them a sadaqa jariyah for us Oh Allah help me leave behind a legacy with humility, allow me to leave this dunya with the best legacies for our offsprings and for others.<br /><br />Help me understand, write, speak and teach Arabic.<br /><br />Help me maintain good ties with my relatives.<br /><br />Help me see my faults and cover it from others. <br /><br />Allow me to speak with wisdom just like the Prophet peace be upon him.<br /><br />Bestow me with wealth to spend in your way.<br /><br />Do not let others humiliate/oppress/mock/take advantage of me.<br /><br />Help me be courageous, confident and a positive person who makes the correct decisions at the right time.<br /><br />Grant me modesty in clothing and speech in front of non Mahrams.<br /><br />Forgive the Muslim ummah -the living and the dead. Bless the Muslims with goodness and grant victory to the oppressed. <br /><br />Fill our hearts with Emaan.<br /><br />Oh Allah, accept my deeds. <br /><br />Ya Allah, O my Allah, Ya Rahman, Ya Raheem, Ya Kareem, Ya Sattar, Ya Gaffar, Ya Qaadir, Ya Sami, Ya Aleem, Al Mujeeb, Ya Allah I turn to you in repentance, in submission. I beg you please fulfill my duas.<br /><br />Ya Allah Forgive my sins, a complete forgiveness that leaves no trace.<br /><br />Ya Allah Forgive my transgressions of Your Commands. Ya Allah Grant me victory over my shortcomings <br /><br />Reform and upgrade me Ya Allah in the best way possible, in the way you know that is best for me.<br /><br />Ya Allah Accept my duaas, ibaadah &amp; deeds.<br /><br />Ya Allah Guide me towards performing good accepted deeds for Your Sake only.<br /><br />Ya Allah Help me to attain khushu&#39;, ikhlaas and ihsaan in my ibaadah.<br /><br />Ya Allah Help me get closer to you as my end draws near.<br /><br />Ya Allah Make me love You, Your Prophet (pbuh), Your Deen, Your book the Quran, the way it deserves to be loved.<br /><br />Ya allah Increase my eeman, tawakkul and yaqeen in You.<br /><br />Ya Allah Increase me in Taqwa,<br /><br />Make me of your grateful slaves and amongst the patient ones.<br /><br />Ya Allah Give me the strength to be steadfast throughout the trials I encounter now and in the future.<br /><br />Ya Allah Grant me a soft heart &amp; contentment with Your Laws.<br /><br />Ya Allah Make the Quran be my companion in both worlds.<br /><br />Ya Allah Guide me to the siraat mustaqeem until my last breath, never to be deviated in shirk, kufr or bid&#39;ah. <br /><br />Ya Allah make clear to me what is the haqq and what isn&#39;t, keep me firm upon your Deen.<br /><br />Ya Allah Make me among the muhsineen, muttaqeen the mukhliseen, the sabiqoon fil ilm.<br /><br />Ya Allah Increase me in beneficial knowledge.<br /><br />I ask of you what Muhammad peace be upon asked you of and I seek refuge in you from what the Prophet Muhammad peace be upon sought refuge from.<br /><br />Ya Allah Protect me from sicknesses of the heart (envy, arrogance, pride, showing off)<br /><br />Ya Allah Bless me with happiness in this dunya &amp; akhirah, protect me from sadness, depression and anxiety.<br /><br />Ya Allah Favour me",sheik74 Hamid,2020-05-12T01:32:22Z,0

"If you&#39;re always hungry and can&#39;t fast everyday then you are definitely a diabetic. The majority of people in the world are diabetic and they don&#39;t even know it. Ask me why. Because people eat and consume sugar and carbohydrates which are both 100% toxic to the body. People around the world are killing themselves slowly by consuming sugar and carbohydrates everyday. This started at the beginning of the Industrial Age where food started to be mass produced and people were forced to include carbohydrates and sugar into their diets. Bread, rice and pasta are bad for you! Wake up, you diabetic idiots!!!",JDM Street Fighters,2020-05-12T00:42:58Z,0
Why do you think people defacate so much? Because the body must discharge what it cannot utilize as food or in other words carbohydrates. If you only ate proteins and fat which your body was designed for then you wouldn&#39;t defecate and grow fat and succumb to the various diseases that are a direct result of consuming sugar and carbohydrates,JDM Street Fighters,2020-05-12T00:50:53Z,0

Not eating and drinking is just one part of fasting other than that People should not commit any kind of sins and don&#39;t harm others by their actions. Be polite and kind to others and give charity to the poor. And, This holy month of Ramadan teaches many other Good things.</b>","Chef, how do I?",2020-05-11T17:18:25Z,15

"I just want to clarify one thing: the fast is from the astronomical dawn (in which everything is still very dark outside) till the astronomical dusk. Not really from sunrise (which is usually 1.5 hours after the astronomical dawn, in which you can clearly see the sun).  So it is technically more correct to say that the fast is from dawn till dusk, not sunrise to sunset.",Zamzam Khan,2020-05-11T08:40:10Z,0

It&#39;s real, I would have extreme difficulty with a dry fast I suspect, especially in a hot arid climate, because I&#39;m acclimated to cold weather conditions; now that it&#39;s spring, I&#39;m having difficulty with our temperatures as it is.  2 Corinthians 12:9  The power is yours!",Sky Dance,2020-05-11T05:03:15Z,1

My Ramdan is making and realising me too much pain for those people who have lost their life due to hungry and thirst(lack of food and water).<br /><br />Thus Ramdan realises or reminds me each year again and again  to feed poor people who are living below poverty line.....not only for human even for each creatures....<br /><br />Thus Ramdan is a very strong rope/bridge between Rich and Poor people to hold it and continue for life together by helping each other,Murad Ahmad,2020-05-11T03:58:36Z,0

Alhamdulillah my daughter will be 9 in a few days. She has fasted for 10 days and now accustomed to it. Fasting is purely for Allah and that&#39;s why one could stay fasting till sunset. If your intention is to try but not for the sake of Allah it&#39;s very difficult as your mind will keep you bothering for water and food. May Allah the almighty guide you towards Islam.

"<b>Fasting is not just abstaining your stomach from food. When a person fasts, his eyes are also fasting, which means he does not look/watch at evil and forbidden things. His ears are also fasting, which means he does not hear evil things such as back biting, cussing etc. If there is a place where this is happening, you simply stop them or walk away from there. And hence your feet are also fasting, which means, you walk away from the place where evil things happen. Your hands are also fasting, which means you don&#39;t cause harm to anyone with your hands - and most importantly (and perhaps the most TOUGHEST one - Your tongue is also fasting, which means, you control your anger, you don&#39;t say words that could hurt anyone even though they may be true. You don&#39;t back bite, you don&#39;t cuss out, you don&#39;t scream, you don&#39;t speak a lie. Your heart is also fasting, which means you take out any malice and clean it from everything and you forgive people who have done injustice to you, just for the sake of Allah. Think about it, how can you beg forgiveness from God when you are not ready to forgive others?</b><br /><br /><b>Ramdhan is a month of practice where Muslims are supposed to practice and develop these traits and then try to live the remaining 11 months the same way as they did in Ramdhan, till the month of practice comes again. All the best to you.</b>",Khaleefa X,2020-05-11T00:52:40Z,0

"Hi Eva, it&#39;s a wonderful initiative! As a kid, I was encouraged by my elders to take small steps to fast, i.e. only once a week or on weekends, and even a small meal with water at first around mid-day, then the following year, only water and by the time I was 10, I was able to fast for real and have been doing it ever since and never had any health issues, thank God. So it&#39;s absolutely fine if you want to ease into <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Ramadan"">#Ramadan</a>! Perhaps by the end, you could fast a full day, who knows! And if you&#39;d like to gain perspective from an Islamic point of view, read Surah Yaseen (chapter 36) from the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Quran"">#Quran</a>, it&#39;s only about 6-7 pages. :) <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23RamadanMubarak"">#RamadanMubarak</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23RamadanKareem"">#RamadanKareem</a>",HasanKhanArt,2020-05-10T23:30:48Z,0

"You can drink adequate water before  sunrise to avoid drinking afterwards.  If you consume your food intelligently before sunrise you can even perform sports activities during  the day even cross country without having headaches. It all depends on how you train your body to adapt to the new feeding habits. The results are bound to be excellent both physically and spiritually according to my personal experience. However, I must admit that perhaps not everybody will be able to persevere and practise sports activities whilst fasting.⚖",Eshan NM,2020-05-10T18:41:59Z,0

During Ramadhan, fasting makes us rest our stomach and detoxifying the whole body . It also detox your mind and soul.. It is some form of meditation, self reflex and makes us feel empathy for other people who are unfortunate and do not have any food to eat.",POP CULTURE CHANNEL,2020-05-10T01:51:00Z,1

And will not make it dry for long time. <br /><br />Also talk less during fasting. Rest just ask from the One who has Created everything from nothing. To make you successful in all of your Lives. <br /><br />Allah SWT will bless you with his Rahmat and will make you able to do fasting as for its been Made.<br /><br />It has a Real purpose than health than anything you will hear from any one around you.<br /><br />I will write you again the day you share a video in which you would say that you have fasted by not eating or drinking anything.<br /><br />One word I must say you should do proper fasting if you don&#39;t have any disease like Suger , Diabetes or any other swear stuff.<br /><br />I wish and hope you should not have any disease and will stay healthy.<br /><br />Keep sharing good videos and keep doing it .<br /><br />Thank you.

❤️   Beautiful thing to do. I was wondering if u could do some sort of tutorial on how to tie head wear. In that part of the world they are pros at head and face wear. I live in the US and now we have to wear face masks or face coverings  I’d much rather wear head coverings like desert and muslin people do.

"Fasting is not just useful for the gut, but it goes way beyond that. <br />It has been proven that those who fast for a month or so and repeat it annually or 6 months, have a less chance of getting cancer. It makes more sense if you know about Epigenome and how eating less food prevents your epigenome from tearing apart.<br /><br />Moreover, eating less also helps in dampening senescence, I am not focusing on this bit because well, Muslims don&#39;t fast everyday so, it doesn&#39;t account that much.<br /><br />Also, Thank you Eva.

I am also fasting this ramadan the first time of my life though im am not Muslim. Also do it to understand fasting people more and also have the experience of feeling hunger. First week I completely fasted but because I have shift work with nightshift and than I don&#39;t have time to eat at 9pm I decided to use my own rules and skip some days for fasting or at least eat some breakfast than and continue... It is a very good experience and I will do it again next year!,StrawberryShake93,2020-05-09T19:19:45Z,1

Horrified each time, I immediately scold them, reminding them that Muslims are also homo sapiens, and that many of their instructors are also Muslim. The amount of unhinged fear in the USA is really an epidemic. ..So, I&#39;ve shown your vids in my classes. Yes, that&#39;s right! I use you to help me to get students to open their minds. I showed them your Pakistan videos, all of your current &#39;in isolation&#39; videos, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, all of them. The students find them surprising, even shocking. As a strict vegetarian nutter, I made my version of that pumpkin dish you tried in Armenia, which was also a gorgeous vid. Stay safe, well, and brilliant!

"this practice of fasting, is not new! since before Yeshua, peoples of the middle east and others, practiced fasting for various reasons.  a person should continually pray (meditate), be generous, self-sacrificing, etc. everyday of their life.

"Eva, I enjoy your videos, but I have to say that I believe you may be a hypocrite. I have not thought that of you, but now I am thinking perhaps you are. Prove me wrong. You have not said a word about Catholicism and its beautiful practices.I don&#39;t know if your family in Poland was Catholic while you were growing up, but the chances are about 90+% The nation that birthed you and raised you is Catholic and it is a deep part of your identity, like it or not. Yet, you have not breathed a single word about it. There is fasting every Friday in Catholicism and at other holy times in the year, much like in Islam. And remember that Islam has taken many practices from the influence of Judaism and Christianity. In fact, the Quran states that the New Testament writings are to be revered as from God, as well as the Old Testament. And while the Muslim leaders oppose the Quran and claim these have been corrupted, the Quran, written much later, does not even imply that, but demands Muslims revere these writings as divinely inspired. You can find a lot of very good solid research (often in the form of taunting, but still accurate) from the PhD in Philosophy who gave up his job at a university in order to educate the world about the truths of the Quran against the commonly held beliefs and practices of today&#39;s Muslims <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/Acts17Apologetics"">https://www.youtube.com/user/Acts17Apologetics</a><br />PLEASE show proper respect for your origins, since you wouldn&#39;t be here on this planet without them and you would not be YOU without them. Your origins are the largest reason for you being who you are.",The Rooted Word,2020-05-09T17:04:05Z,0

"Everyone gets headaches on first days of fasting and that is becouse our bodies are used to consuming suger all the time, there is a hard period for the body to adapt to more healthy state of consuming body fat as fule instead of suger in the blood (which is very bad for the health) so if you get headaches you should just be patient, you wont get it on the third or fourth day of fasting, also try to avoid suger in all its forms even when you break your fasting, let your body learn to live off its body fat instead of suger",MrMaa2007,2020-05-09T14:36:48Z,0

Ramadan is an Arab pagan festivity.,Rojaaaa,2020-05-09T14:03:41Z,0
"Some information about Mecca and Hajj in the Bible<br /><br />The Pagans took over the House of Allah (The kabaa), the first place for worship of Allah, after some time because the inhabitants forgot the original monotheism. Abraham rebuilt it. You find reference to Mecca in the Bible and the Quran as the name Bakka. In the Bible this can be found in the Psalms 84 and in the Quran 3:96<br /><br />This psalm clearly describes Mecca and a pilgrimage to it.<br /><br />Psalm 84 New International Version (NIV)<br /><br />Psalm 84[a]<br /><br />For the director of music. According to gittith.[b] Of the Sons of Korah. A psalm.<br /><br />1 How lovely is your dwelling place,<br />    Lord Almighty!<br />2 My soul yearns, even faints,<br />    for the courts of the Lord;<br />my heart and my flesh cry out<br />    for the living God.<br />3 Even the sparrow has found a home,<br />    and the swallow a nest for herself,<br />    where she may have her young—<br />a place near your altar,<br />    Lord Almighty, my King and my God.<br />4 Blessed are those who dwell in your house;<br />    they are ever praising you.[c]<br /><br />5 Blessed are those whose strength is in you,<br />    whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.<br />6 As they pass through the Valley of Baka,<br />    they make it a place of springs;<br />    the autumn rains also cover it with pools.[d]<br />7 They go from strength to strength,<br />    till each appears before God in Zion.<br /><br />8 Hear my prayer, Lord God Almighty;<br />    listen to me, God of Jacob.<br />9 Look on our shield,[e] O God;<br />    look with favor on your anointed one.<br /><br />10 Better is one day in your courts<br />    than a thousand elsewhere;<br />I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God<br />    than dwell in the tents of the wicked.<br />11 For the Lord God is a sun and shield;<br />    the Lord bestows favor and honor;<br />no good thing does he withhold<br />    from those whose walk is blameless.<br /><br />12 Lord Almighty,<br />    blessed is the one who trusts in you.<br /><br />Footnotes:<br /><br />[a] Psalm 84:1 In Hebrew texts 84:1-12 is numbered 84:2-13.<br /><br />[b] Psalm 84:1 Title: Probably a musical term<br /><br />[c] Psalm 84:4 The Hebrew has Selah (a word of uncertain meaning) here and at the end of verse 8.<br /><br />[d] Psalm 84:6 Or blessings<br /><br />[e] Psalm 84:9 Or sovereign<br /><br />New International Version (NIV)<br /><br />Look at footnote C: the name for praying or praising God is Selah in the Hebrew. In Islam our prayer is called Salah. <br /><br />When it rains in Makka the water pools especially around the Kabaa.<br /><br />Quran 3:96 Surely the first House ˹of worship˺ established for humanity is the one at Bakka (Mecca)—a blessed sanctuary and a guide for ˹all˺ people.<br /><br />3:97 In it are clear signs and the standing-place of Abraham. Whoever enters it should be safe. Pilgrimage to this House is an obligation by Allah upon whoever is able among the people. And whoever disbelieves, then surely Allah is not in need of ˹any of His˺ creation.<br /><br />Genesis 21 17-19 explains about Hajar (Hagar) searching for water and how there is a well placed for her son. This is what Muslims are reenacting when they go between the 2 hills of safa and Marwa. The well is Zamzam. This is the well Muslims drink from. <br /><br />Genisis 21 17-19: God heard the cry of the boy, and an angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, &#39;What troubles you, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heeded the cry of the boy where he is. Come, lift up the boy and hold him by the hand, for I will make a great nation of him.&#39; Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water. She went and filled the skin with water and let the boy drink.<br /><br />Quran <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72n7Sp2FLao&amp;t=10m37s"">10:37</a> It is not ˹possible˺ for this Quran to have been produced by anyone other than Allah. In fact, it is a confirmation of what came before, and an explanation of the Scripture. It is, without a doubt, from the Lord of all worlds.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72n7Sp2FLao&amp;t=10m38s"">10:38</a> Or do they claim, “He made it up!”? Tell them ˹O Prophet˺, “Produce one sûrah like it then, and seek help from whoever you can—other than Allah—if what you say is true!”",Aisha Abdi,2020-05-09T14:09:54Z,0

What if you live in the north. In May some places have sunrise after 2200 and sunrise before 0400. That&#39;s like 18hrs+ with no water or food.

Its not only food and water but also fasting and strict control over all kind of activities which normally sometimes even if not good but we let slide in normal day to day lives like abusive language, getting angry, talking bad about some one. fighting etc. And all good deeds should be increased as its spiritual reward is multiplied for us many times.",Arsalan Ahmad,2020-05-09T13:38:34Z,0

I&#39;ve had people i&#39;ve grown up with who weren&#39;t muslims but fasted with us for the experience. To understand what it&#39;s like. They celebrated Eid with us as well. Didn&#39;t mean they wanted to get married. They&#39;re just curious about how lives and cultures different from them work.",emmycasa,2020-05-12T03:27:37Z,1
"@Janveer Raise If that&#39;s what you want to believe. All of the Abrahamic religions have some form of fasting. There are also precriptions of charity, believing in one God. it&#39;s common between them but they still differ. Besides Islam acknowledges Jewish traditions and Christian traditions as it&#39;s predecessors because it believes in both Moses and Jesus. I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s copying when he believed in both of them. Even if it is, so what? Again for the same reason.",emmycasa,2020-05-12T00:52:01Z,0

Hi! I&#39;m also a non-Muslim/ex-Muslim who practices Ramadan and I mostly do it to challenge myself and for the health benefits as well. It&#39;s also a cultural thing for me and my family :),Crystal Aria,2020-05-09T13:01:29Z,9
"No need to shove your opinions down my throat. I get to decide what I believe for myself not you. Religion is a personal thing not something meant to be forced on your by people who&#39;s minds are from the 1960&#39;s. This is the problem with people in my country, Pakistan. If Pakistanis were better people, it would flourish and could be amazing. I hope I never fall into you guy&#39;s trap ever again",Crystal Aria,2020-05-09T14:28:25Z,0

"@Jack Lacoste you have missed my point intentionally or unintentionally , asking questions or making allegations both are different. You can ask questions if you want to know about the religion but u accept it or not, u also know that he is here to make fun of Islam and nothing more.",Ali,2020-05-09T19:33:40Z,0
@Physis I can answere each of your false allegations if I can see 1% sincerity in you but u r here to make fun of Islam and that&#39;s it. What is ur religion or are u an atheist?,Ali,2020-05-09T19:23:33Z,0
"@Ali why not? Everyone is entitled to their opinions. You can be tolerant of something while not agreeing with it yourself. People don&#39;t like to see anything they view as critical of their religion, especially if they are strongly religious.  However,  you should question everything. Every religion has it&#39;s good and bad points. Surely followers should work on how to improve these rather than just accepting what they are told blindly.",Jack Lacoste,2020-05-09T17:52:56Z,0
"@Physis are you deluded, fasting without consuming water and food is good for you ask any nutritionists hence many athletes in my gym fast alongside muslims.",Justice,2020-05-09T17:19:06Z,0
