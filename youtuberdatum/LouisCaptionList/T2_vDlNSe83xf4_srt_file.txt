finally after three years in the making
me and jp
can announce the long-awaited release
date
of our around the world documentary
beyond borders
and that day is
hey guys this is a long overdue video
and i'm finally making it for you
and explaining a lot of what's been
going on for the last couple of years
that i haven't really
gone into detail with but i feel like i
owe it to
the people that supported the
kickstarter campaign
to help me and jp make our documentary
beyond borders
if you don't know what i'm talking about
back in 2017
we me and jp flew around the world
and at the beginning of that year we
managed to raise a hundred thousand
pounds on kickstarter
to help make a documentary and
we naively predicted that we'd have that
documentary
fully finished and edited for completion
in like the end of summer beginning of
full 2018.
i'm gonna firstly apologize for that
uh massive underestimation me
and jp had never ventured into long-form
content
and making documentaries before so
before i go into a long explanation of
what's been going on i just wanted to
apologize
for i guess that underestimation and
because of that a lot of people have
felt let down and that's what i'm making
today's video about just addressing
everything um apologizing for letting
people down
and yeah just explaining as much as i
can
so rewind 2017 we
picked a figure out of the air we kind
of estimated how much
maybe it would cost to make a
feature-length 90-minute documentary and
that's what we raised funds for but also
it was kind of like what
what do we think we could raise like how
many people would be down for this
and anything else if it cost more
i was prepared to put in that money
so we amazingly managed to raise a
hundred thousand pounds
and i'm so grateful for everyone that
supported the vision
and believed in us and uh
a lot of people basically paid to get a
dvd
or a digital download of the film once
it's done so it's like a pre-purchase of
the
movie and that's what helped us fund
making the whole project after the
flight me and jp
were beyond burnt out exhausted
just emotionally depleted it was really
difficult for our friendship and
it took you know months and months if
not
a year to recover really and i i don't
want to go into all the detail but it
was really
really difficult it was an amazing
achievement i'm so glad we did it
biggest adventure in my life but three
months of that kind of intensity was
just
really difficult and we needed some time
apart so
for the first kind of six months after
the flight we were just kind of
gathering ourselves um trying to figure
out okay how do we start getting this
into momentum and starting working on
the post we had
i don't know how i think like 14
terabytes of
video and we still needed to shoot a lot
more like interviews and post narration
and me and jp weren't together at the
time so we were like
different parts of the world and we
weren't able to
film a lot of stuff together so firstly
throughout 2018
we were just trying to finish off a lot
of the narration
working with my friend nick lear and
cape town who worked
on all the post editing for like two
years of editing
helping build the story out helping
patch together kind of like
the arc of how we were going to present
this amazing adventure
and i guess really helping me and jp
with the narration and pulling the best
parts of the story out and
putting it all together so that took a
lot longer than expected and
in hindsight and having talked to other
people that work in documentary
filmmaking um they said this is
completely normal
documentaries normally take years in
post to work on so
realizing that now uh i wouldn't have um
made such an ambitious deadline and i
wouldn't have
created this expectation for those of
you watching
and have been expecting and waiting
patiently
for the finished film and then there's
tons more involved that i
never knew about because i've always
just done very quick edits my daily
vlogs but there was like
you know scoring sound design mixing
color grading back and forth from
different parts of the world
trying to figure all this out and
working on
um different iterations and going back
and forth
so that was just so much more time
consuming and
the biggest thing was it cost a lot more
money than i ever would have imagined
and it's almost embarrassing
to talk about because i basically sunk
pretty much my entire life savings into
making this movie
even once we've spent the kickstarter
money
i've put an additional like 240
000 pounds into this which is a
mind-blowing
number and i don't tell a lot of people
so this is hard for me to
tell you guys i could have literally
bought a house for that but instead
i just wanted to get this finished and
it's like the first
and probably it's the it's the thing i'm
most proud of creating as a as a video
and as a creation and as the time went
on and the hours went on and the months
went on
and all these different people and cogs
in the process i was just like let's
just get this finished
i'm gonna keep putting money in it's
like entertainment lawyers and
you know everything that needed to
happen different
camera crews to finish interviews and so
yes i i invested pretty much all my
entire life savings into making it
happen
and you might still be in disbelief that
that's the amount of money it's cost
and you know i i promise you uh i'm
also in kind of disbelief but that is
how much money it's cost so
anyway so all of those things flying
around all those factors were involved
and i think by by the time we had
originally predicted releasing which was
2018
i was like you know maybe we can
aim for like another year so we could
release it kind of summer
of 2019. now because
i had invested so much a lot of people
were telling me hey look
you could sell the movie obviously
fulfill your
deliverables to the kickstarter people
and all of the
things that you've committed to the
pre-sales the dvds
the the digital downloads and
then you could sell it to a platform
like netflix or another streaming
platform
and they would license it off you or buy
the rights
outright and you could hopefully make
your money back if not a little bit of
profit so
this was a very appealing route for me
also just getting out there in front of
a new audience as well somewhere
like netflix was the dream for me i was
like oh my gosh like
even though i could get on netflix and
not even get any money that would be
a dream but i also really wanted to
recuperate
all the savings i'd i'd put into it so i
can
get that money back and hopefully do
other things with it
for my life and setting my life up so
like buying a house
anyway so um this was exciting this was
a good route for me
and i thought you know as long as i i
commit to delivering for you guys and
those of you that
helped fund the kickstarter i was happy
with this route
so july 2019 almost a year ago
one of my good friends who works at this
new streaming
platform that was going to be launching
i think originally at the end of last
year
said hey look we're really interested in
the documentary um
we'd love to buy the doc off you guys
and um this was looking really promising
there was a lot of
optimism there was immediate back and
forth talking okay let's get this
let's get the dock finished we can buy
off you guys
hopefully then release it and give it to
the kickstarters and it's available on
this bigger platform
so the entire second half of last year i
really ramped up getting everything
together right we need to finish this
dark let's just
go hard on it and i needed some more
people to help me so we got a few more
people in we finished everything
and at the end of last year december
2019
we completed the dock it was color
graded
sound design original score done i
worked with a
a guy in la who helped to score the
entire thing
and it was finished and i was aiming to
get it all ready to be released with
this streaming platform
and to you guys i just we hadn't signed
a contract it wasn't finished it was
back and forth
with my entertainment lawyer and them
and then beginning of this year
i was very frustrated and i was just i
was like 2019
end of 2019 my biggest goal my only
dream that the big thing that
was my new year's resolution to tick off
was to get this
finally done and finished for you guys
by the end of 2019 and i was
just deeply frustrated as i know a lot
of you are
deeply frustrated really wanted to get
this out and
i just couldn't do it because
we were waiting we were waiting on
feedback from this streaming platform
hey
when are you guys launching when can we
do this can we get the contract signed
and there was just
silence and back and forth and waiting
around for weeks and i was like hey look
we've got the finished movie i really
wanted to release to the kickstarters
and they were like you know hold back
we need to need to figure out like to
launch this together so
anyway it was just months of waiting and
you know understandably seeing you guys
are frustrated a lot of comments in my
videos tweets coming into me and jp and
i'm just like oh i just
wish i could explain the bigger picture
but my entertainment lawyer was
saying you know hold back other people
i'm working with like you know don't
don't tell everyone everything just hold
back and then i was like i don't
really want to like do an update or an
announcement until we have some
update or an announcement so the
contract wasn't signed there was nothing
to announce
really there was like a hopeful thing
but um
i just held back i kept on holding back
oh a few more weeks a few more weeks a
few more weeks and then i'll be able to
announce something to you guys
and it just never happened and then as
soon as the coronavirus hit
i heard that they've delayed the launch
of the streaming platform another year
until 2021
early 2021 so this was heartbreaking for
me because
not only had you know for six to eight
months
like eight months of me thinking okay
this is happening
suddenly it just like disintegrates in
front of me and i understand like
you know everyone's struggling right now
and
you know maybe they just had to
completely re-strategize and i
understand but
i also have just felt all of this
has just let you guys down really
so where we're at now is we have a
completed movie
loads of people are saying don't release
this movie to the kickstarters even
before i have something in contract
with a streaming platform or a platform
that wants to buy
the dock right so loads of people be
like don't lose anything yet
i feel that i owe it to you guys to
release
to those that have pre-purchased the
dock to release it to you guys
even before having any security of
of recouping my funds now that's a lot
of money and that's a lot of money for
me
um like i said that would really help me
set up for the rest of my life right now
but i also feel like i've got this
obligation and
integrity to release the duck so this is
the limbo i'm in right now i'm trying to
figure out what to do
i'm still an optimist believing this is
honestly i'm so
proud of this guys i can't wait for you
i know it's been a long wait coming but
honestly it's worth it
i'm really proud of this this film and
i have optimism that we can sell it
but that's where we're at that's where
we're at guys
and i should have talked about all of
this
last year and kept you in the loop but
um it was just been very difficult and
i've
just been juggling different people's
advice and not really knowing
how much to share and what to do so i
thought i'd just make this very very
honest
transparent video today and share with
you
this journey that i've been on trying to
figure this all out
i want to thank you for your patience
and hopefully um
you guys will have a bit more
understanding about the journey
i know i've made mistakes i've predicted
things wrong i've
made um commitments that
i haven't been able to deliver on but i
want you guys to know that this
has been the forefront of my mind super
important to me
and it's a priority for me
and i know you may feel like it it
hasn't been a priority but it really is
and i truly want this to be
the beginning of lots of long-form
documentaries that i can make
and again like i said i'm really proud
of it thanks for sticking with me
and i'll let you know as soon as i have
anything
further to announce it's a very exciting
day
after literally over a year of
communicating back and forth
i've just got through a contract from
discovery basically licensing our beyond
borders documentary
for two years on their new streaming
platform
and this is going to recuperate the vast
majority of money that i invested into
it
and it's going to get it out to the
world and
people are going to be able to watch the
film that me and jp slaved away on and
obviously it's long awaited this is a
pivotal moment for me
oh my gosh what
my heart's actually racing i think
because this
represents so many years of my life
and it's a real sense of that we've
actually got somewhere and achieved
something
oh my gosh finally after three years in
the making
me and jp can announce the long-awaited
release date of our around the world
documentary beyond borders and
that day is the 4th of jan
2021 so just over a month away

sell the documentary to discovery plus
they've dropped a press release
announcing a lot of the original content
they're doing including
our documentary which you can check out
i am relieved i am
hyped i'm it doesn't even feel real to
be honest i'm still
kind of coming to terms with just how
exciting this
is all of the kickstarters and people

the dvds and the digital copies
are going to get theirs before it goes
out to the general public
