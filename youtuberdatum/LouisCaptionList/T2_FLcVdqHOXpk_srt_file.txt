we are lost in the rocks of hampi and
you are watching fun for louis
all right i just no way
oh no you ripped it i did rip it hold on
hold on now we have to make sure that
the bike's okay
[Music]
gopro announced the gopro hero
9 which they've sent me to try out
and i'm going gonna vlog my entire vlog
today on the hero9
test out the audio it's got front facing
screen there's a ton of new features
one of the new features is this
removable lens you can like
twist this lens off and there's a super
wide-angle lens they've sent me
which i think's mainly for this feature
called 360 horizon leveling
but we'll play around with that later
nice it's
[Music]
audio on the gopro see how it sounds
whilst we're cruising along it's a
little bit windy so it might be a bit of
wind but
maybe not should i grab it i was just
saying to bc
i cannot believe we live here this is
just
the dream also the dream would be to get
a whole fleet of these super 73 bikes
for our
our squad i think on the weekend i'm
going to build a surf rack
and a bike rack for us to pull the
surfboards on these bikes
by the way justin is helping me edit my
videos now i need to help me film today
he has his own channel which i'll link
below you can go check out
we're going to be doing a lot of
collaborations together oh the sun looks
unreal it literally looks like we're in
india or thailand or something you know
grab the mic with no excuses in a sec
detects lupus
executing shaking those sets and now i'm
breaking no hex i'm taking all bets
if this stabilizes i'm going to be
amazed that was
so shaky
[Music]
get caught by the drop kick you know the
thrill yes it's pop kills
[Music]
fun i'm impressed yeah this is fun i'm
really liking the selfie screen
it's so handy to be able to like just
quickly glance and see if you're like
framed properly
did your uh did your shirt get caught
justice cardigan got caught in the super
73
like gears all right i just
no you ripped it i did rip it hold on
hold on now we have to make sure that
the bike's okay
that's what was in there stock
and that's what happens oh no destroyed
so what you need to do is not wear it
it's uh
it's gonna be a fun memory every time
you look at that now you can be like
that's a fun ride
i've reviewed the footage i've been
cutting it together i'm pretty impressed
mainly with the audio which was always
the problem i had with the gopros
this is finally the gopro that i'm like
yeah this audio is
fine this is like great for vlogging the
conditions weren't
great with the low light it was in the
evening
gopros really shine when it's bright
sunlight obviously this wasn't a full
review it was just some test shots
showing you guys whether it would work
for you or not just in that kind of
casual vlogging sense hearing other
people talking and you talking
my dilemma here is i have been using my
iphone to shoot some of the vlogs
it's been working pretty well and i've
always got it on me the gopro
obviously is going to be better for
action sports as it always has been but
i'm not always going to have this gopro
in my pocket so
it's definitely going to be in my
arsenal i'm definitely going to use it
for certain things
i don't think it's going to be my
day-to-day vlogging camera it is a game
changer that it's got the front-facing
screen
like i said the audio is amazing the low
light
is still not great even vlogging inside
the house earlier it was
pretty bad if you want to see a full
review there's loads of amazing
full reviews where they've gone through
all the specs i don't really want to
be doing those on this channel i really
want this channel to take this new
direction of exploring community life
and occasionally there'll be me playing
around with new tech and stuff
but yeah i'm not gonna do really
thorough reviews hopefully this was
helpful
hopefully it was a fun little vlog and
yeah i'll keep you updated
in tomorrow's vlog i'm going to be doing
a full office tour
showing you my workspace and how i've
set this whole place up
and i'm going to talk a little bit about
why i've been sleeping in my office a
lot rather than
in bed with rya in our bedroom yeah
that's been interesting
but i'll go into that in the next vlog
