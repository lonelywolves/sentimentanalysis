[Music]
i just sawed through
one of the brake lines this battery is
completely dead
i'm wearing rubber gloves just in case
[Music]
we're moving
[Laughter]
[Music]
i've hit one of those moments in this
project where
i just feel so exhausted i think i've
just done like
five days straight 16 hour days
literally only stopped to eat and
sleep and not even sleep enough barely
get any sleep so last night i think i
got five hours
maybe i haven't washed wearing the same
clothes
and been eating junk food and energy
drinks so
all of this hasn't helped
and i just feel like we're barely making
any progress
it's just so slow i really hoped
by the end of today that we could be
close to finished but
joe he told me last night we're probably
only 80 there which is so disheartening
we've got
so much to do still this is the next
task
all of these holes need screwing in
then unscrewing cleaning and then
um i've got this silicon that i need to
seal
all of these joints with so that's that
box and then
still got this box to do this box today
that box today so
it's very hard i'm aching all over my
hands just
hand i'm holding tools and oh all my
muscles here i just need
a massage and i need to soak in a bath
for like an
entire day this is this is hard work i
feel like i need a boost of morale right
now
the reason i'm excited to get this on
the road is that i haven't had a vehicle
for forever and this is going to mean me
and ryan can go on little romantic
weekend getaways
i'm going to be running a podcast from
inside the bus where i pick up friends
and
interview them and then we're going to
do volunteer work we drive somewhere and
then
so anyway i've got all these plans and
ideas
but they are delayed
i'm gonna do the same with the
tops and screw those on get all the
holes
ready and then i'm gonna take them off
again and
seal them and then screw them back on
[Music]
i just got this rusty metal primer
okay the primer has dried i'm gonna put
a top coat on now
[Music]
it is time to test the coolant system
so i've kind of jerry-rigged this fun
experiment so i've got
car battery this was actually really low
voltage like it it was pretty dead so
i'm charging it up with this
this is giving me just over 12 volts
output which is what i need to power
this
this is a pc cooling pump it goes
out of here into the input and then
through these pipes
into here out of here into here out of
here and then the output
goes back into the reservoir which will
be full of
coolant i've got some coolant here
anti-freeze so i'm going to fill up that
start the pump
and then just check that it's all
working properly it should just
circulate and circulate so this normally
plugs somewhere inside the computer
that's just a positive and negative
i've made these little cables up which
i'm going to try and plug into that and
just see what happens
this is my dodgy cabling
i think this antifreeze you add water to
so i'm going to do a 50 50 mix
this is a good um experiment actually to
see how much we need
a battery
it's looking pretty good all the air
bubbles are clearing
nice nice nice nice since i've got this
setup ready
i'm gonna wheel this main battery this
triple battery box
out and then put the other battery boxes
here and spin them around and just
basically do the same thing do a test of
all the
cooling pipes it seems to be working
fine yeah i'm happy with that
[Music]
i had to run the tubes all the way to
the other end because
this is going to be butt up right
against the big battery pack and
there's going to be no access i'm kind
of nervous because the next thing i need
to do
is seal the box up
i think it's ready i think i've done
pretty much all that i can
i've got this gun ready so i'm going to
clean the edges first with this brake
cleaner to get all the grease off and
then i need to cut this
and then run some beads along here
[Music]
so
[Music]
guys can you see how much i'm sweating
this is the craziest
craziest thing trying to line this up is
a mission i've probably been under here
[Music]
uh this
signifies a pretty major milestone
in the build this is the most complex
biggest box
and it's mounted and it's ready oh my
gosh
this is a major achievement and i'm
pretty sure it's
it's secure this shouldn't be bowing
this much i feel like we need
to figure something out here because
that that's messed up right there
probably like 8 a.m now just trying to
get out of here by five
seven a.m okay i'm gonna go get
breakfast
have a long bath try and sleep because
i've barely slept in the last five days
and then when i come back i'm gonna get
that box
here same way i've done this box these
two single boxes
either side and then that final box in
the back there
it's gonna go up here somewhere and then
we're gonna connect them all together
with this huge cable
i have sealed and screwed together
another box this is the second biggest
box which is going to
live behind this front one here and it
is ready to mount
i'm worried that this handle which
cannot be taken down
is going to hit onto the bottom there
but let's see let's see if this works
a tight squeeze
[Music]
one of the problems i'm finding is
because when i aligned it all
to drill the original holes
the boxes didn't have the batteries in
because obviously they're super heavy
and i thought they were straight so i
even attached like the tops just to
keep them at right angles but just the
slight misalignment
means the holes are slightly upside i
have to drill
right next to them and hope that it
doesn't compromise the strength
this is the drill bit i need
there's actually only one more box to
mount and then
this box is actually doesn't need to be
mounted in the same way because that's
just going to be in the back there so
we're so close we're going to get this
done tonight because it's half past 12.
we're gonna do it
[Music]
i feel like this is all i've been doing
for like
a month but look they're all
sealed and mounted this is incredible
oh yeah so the last thing i need to do
is just
connect all the power cables and then
i'm going to put the sealant on here
and put these bottoms on this is huge
jehu is telling me today that no one's
put this many batteries
underneath a bay window vw before
he said he's heard of someone putting
six but we put one two
three four five six seven eight nine ten
twelve
this is basically this is one of a kind
and we have utilized every last
millimeter of space under here
unreal yeah you can see a bit better
without that light glaring
those are the battery boxes wow
i feel like all i've been doing for the
last month is building these boxes
they're finally
built and mounted so it's time to
plug them in do these this cabling so
i'm just measuring out
the cable length and then i've got this
crimping tool which js just showed me
how to use
and this it crimps the connectors on the
end and then those
attached to the battery terminals okay
it's time to run the cables finally
i guess we still need enough slack to
push it through and do
what we did here it doesn't matter if
it's like that way or that way right
[Music]
so these single battery boxes here they
need smaller cables which are going to
split off from this
larger cable so i'm basically about to
crimp two of these smaller gauge cables
in with this one because all the other
boxes they're linked in parallel
to modules and these two modules need to
be linked in parallel
through these across the bus if you
understand
this is exciting i'm this is like a fun
phase to move into because i feel like
it's way way faster
i'm thinking like yeah that's that's
fine
and those were able to go in there right
they went in there tight
yeah yeah so they were tight so these
are both like
up to like halfway with the so this is
the right
[Music]
[Music]
size
[Music]
okay the boxes are in
most the cabling's done and i just
started
putting in the um coolant pipes i um
didn't go quite as much as i wanted to
get done but there's a light at the end
of the tunnel
now the boxes are done and the cabling
was pretty quick
and uh yeah then we have to fit a box in
there
i've got over here so this this grey box
here
is going to hold all of the internal
electronics
and yeah that's going to be mounted over
there with the final battery
then we need to mount the motor and the
chargers and
yeah it's all coming together
back at the bus tarzan's come to help
today i'm going to get him to help me
mount this little
um electronic throttle probably
it's either gonna mount here and then
when i
put my foot in the accelerator we'll
pull it and send a signal to the motor
or he's suggesting following this cable
back
and seeing if we can connect it at the
back here somewhere
um adjusted the cable so there's more
play here but
i have to figure out if it's better to
mount it like upright like that
or spin it around
but it's a little cockeyed there so oh
well maybe it'll work
i'm currently putting all these coolant
pipes in like mounting them just so
they're being
held nicely just going around all the
boxes and making sure that they're going
in
i'm just about to cut this one yeah i'm
just putting a t-section in
so i can split it off into that outer
inlet okay
this is the last pipe i need to put in
and then everything is in check it
and i've like mounted everything so it's
pretty secure i'm just going to strip
the
insulation off yeah check it
nice so let me get this bad boy
so that thing just smashes it down it
wet yeah it's like a pneumatic
it's like pump it and it just crimps it
real tight
nice and now we can pull this
the last thing we're gonna do before we
lift the box up and mount
it in place is check the
cooling pipes like the whole cooling
system i think it's all in
so we're just going to turn it on and
see if there's any leaks
shouldn't be we've just kind of like
hacked together this little
connector it's careful not to let those
two touchdowns yeah
this is going to look cool in the back
it's going to look like a flux careful
it's going through
is that okay yeah
okay so when this when this connects
it should start pumping oh i see nice
yeah i can hear it
so then this will start pumping out
oh this is epic wow
such a crazy science project yeah
i mean it's flowing through right now
it's not coming out yet
let me get some more it's so crazy
there's still a lot of air in there oh
here we go
it's definitely moving
so this pipe you eventually will become
there'll be no air bubbles
[Music]
dang he has a lot going in there huh
yeah
it's flowing through all of the
batteries yeah
oh wow this looks so epic
dude yeah it totally looks like a crazy
experiment right now
oh no no
 bad news we were moments away
from mounting the motor and i got a
little bit excited
with the impact drill
and break one of the bolts
