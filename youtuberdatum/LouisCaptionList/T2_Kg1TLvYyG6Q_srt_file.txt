[Music]
i just sawed through
one of the brake lines this battery is
completely dead
i'm wearing rubber gloves just in case
[Music]
we're moving
[Laughter]
[Music]
i'm louis cole and i'm converting my 50
year old van
to fully electric by repurposing tesla
parts
and i'm doing this with zero experience
as long as i can remember i've been
obsessed with fun vehicles and road
trips i bought my very first van on my
21st
birthday put a hammock in the back and
traveled around europe with my friends
i've had a double decker bus that i
lived in for three years
a school bus and then a second double
decker bus but in 2015
i finally purchased my dream van this
has actually been my dream for like
years
tone of vw camper i explored montana
before driving it all the way up the
west coast and into canada with some of
my best friends
and it was truly one of the best summers
of my life unfortunately
there were endless engine problems that
followed and the van ended up
off the road and unused i even spent
five thousand dollars for a complete
engine overhaul only for it to
immediately
break down again so the van won't start
louis just spent so much money getting
this fixed and it's broken again
the truth of it is these beautiful
vintage vehicles
are extremely unreliable and extremely
expensive to maintain
after spending six years traveling the
world non-stop i've recognized that i
have to do it more sustainably
this has to start with finding inventive
ways to get off fossil fuels
and lessen my carbon footprint electric
vehicles
are the future yeah baby
while i've always loved vehicles with
real character i also love doing things
that are unique and seemingly
impossible i stumbled across someone who
had converted their vintage vw
but or selling it for 130 000
i was determined to see whether there
was a cheaper way to do it
after asking around and messaging a few
people i found
jehu garcia dm'd him on twitter and we
arranged to me
we have met up with joe who is
the expert in converting campervans to
electric and today we are going to
i guess just learn a little bit about
what it takes to convert a van to
electric
wow that's the motor right there it's
like the size of a watermelon
it's less than 100 pounds and it's got
about 100 horsepower
right where are the batteries it's about
48 kilowatt hours something like i mean
some of these things you're saying i
don't quite know what that means but i
mean
i guess we'll learn this is awesome
there is sounds but
that's it that's it that's it that's it
started yeah
this is completely silent
so we're heading to evie west this is
the premier
shop for electric conversions on classic
cars
so i'm learning all of this as we're
experiencing it but basically
we use a lot of energy coming down it's
gonna be like three hours
charging to get the batteries back up to
the level they were to get back again
this is all really interesting because
when we do start
doing road trips and long distance
things in my bus i need to learn about
all of this eddie
nice to meet you yeah nice to meet you
man
michael breme is a man who embraces both
the past
and the future he loves classic cars but
only to a point
so he retrofits them to connect to the
21st century
i got into this uh from racing cars and
then i wanted something a little bit
more challenging and we built the e36
pikes peak car
ran it at pikes peak we made press and
then we started getting queries for work
and then
you know history yeah yes it's history
this thing i only just saw it the
delorean
oh this is this is made today this is
tony hawk's
tony hawk's car it's fiberglass this
one's amazing
and uh with surface mount microfuses
it's actually easier because we're just
doing micro traces
i have no idea what they're talking
about
this is so much more complicated than i
thought it was going to be
what an amazing world what an amazing
one what are some of your favorite
vehicles you got in at the moment well
uh
all the volkswagen products but by far
and above the tesla powered 912 that's
over there right now
okay i'm i'm gonna go for a little spin
in this electric porsche
all right you
i don't think i've ever experienced that
kind of acceleration that's
nice right it's uh
oh probably the quickest accelerating
car i've ever played
okay we're back in venice we had an
amazing day yesterday with michael down
at evie west
jehu is a legend both of them are
legends and
they're going to help us make this dream
happen so i bought a
tow bar and we're going to get the van
down to evie west
this like somehow
[Music]
a little bit more a little bit more
height one inch
getting the bust down there is in itself
like a signaling that we are gonna do
this you know i mean it's like
it's down there now we can't turn back
i'm gonna keep the speed momentum going
because they don't actually know we're
dropping it off i'm just gonna write on
the
louis windscreen luckiest we didn't wash
this down
first time i've ever heard that okay
it's been a few months
since we first came down here brought my
van down and started this process of
planning out how we're going to
put an electric engine in my bus it's 20
20. we're ready to do this project now
but we
have just found out today we just
arrived at ev west down san diego and we
just found out today
the original plan to potentially put a
tesla engine in
the bus it's gonna cause a lot of
unknown obstacles and it could end up
taking months and months and months if
not like the whole year
so i think after having a brief
conversation that
the better move is to go with a known
setup and system that johou has done
before and he can help us with i think
we're gonna
have a similar setup that he's done in
this bus and talking about this bus
we're gonna take it for a little spin
this is gonna be my first time driving
an electric camper van
let's do this oh yeah okay did it go
so it's in yeah do i need to put it in
gear or uh it's
already in third gear so you just have
to take off the ring
[Music]
that's the problem with riding around
so you you've dropped this right yeah
i'm so confused with the gearing so it's
in third
can i stay in third or do i need to go
all the time
it's just like if you're on a super
steep hill maybe the motor is not gonna
have enough torque to get going
you're fully loaded and steep hill okay
to get going all right so you might have
to but if i was in
on the highway i wouldn't need to go
into fourth you don't i drove all the
way here um
it's quite an adventure right this is
quite an adventure
it was a little scary way more power
than the original engines have
the big question for me is getting
enough range to do some really good road
tripping in it because
actually having it to be practically
useful like to drive around california
is like a big
important thing for me so i had to bolt
this tow bar on just to get it down here
jehu jay who's measuring up
the underneath section to put the mount
the battery so he's just going to see
how many batteries we can fit in
batteries equals miles so we'll make a
box
right yeah and the box will be sticking
out here but
we just this is just a pipe is it yeah
we'll remove that one because it won't
be if we
use this basically you put
two little modules back to back right
like one here
yeah and then another one and then
another one there and then you'll put
the ones in the back will be cross this
side
yeah we're going to try and get 12 of
these underneath the whole
chassis like the body of the bus but the
danger is
if something punches like we go over a
bump or something like pierces the
batteries they could all set fire
so he's saying we need to like build
like a metal
box to slip them into so they don't
it's you know so it's not as dangerous i
just think we squeeze as many miles out
of it as we can
i think as long as i mean how much is
each battery pack roughly
depends right like i said so i think we
cost it up basically and then figure out
how much support
sells them really expensive but we can
find them in fact there's a guy
just on the way here i'm just going to
show you this bus that they're here now
because it's very similar to mine it's
like the high top
it's a bay window basically this is what
mine's gonna look like once we take the
existing
um combustion engine out and this is
where the electric engine
engine slots in there so we need to do
all that work on mine
i don't think i'm gonna get it looking
as nice and neat as this to be honest
but yeah it's cool to kind of see where
where we're heading
and then the engine the motor that i
think we're gonna
go with is called a hyper nine and it's
the high voltage version
which is going to be a bit stronger than
uh jehu's
and then we're going to mount the
batteries underneath so i think in this
conversion they're like mounting them on
the floor
so it's going to be a raised floor but i
think we're going to build aluminium
battery casing boxes and bolt them
underneath to
maximize the battery batteries we can
put in there
and hopefully get like a 200 mile range
so we can go on proper road trips
this is the motor that we're looking at
getting it's the hyper nine
is this the high voltage one no this is
the this is the normal one right
so we're getting the more powerful
version of this
all right
yeah this feels this feels nice
i can't wait to get it back on the road
we have finalized a list of all the
things we need to buy
i'm going to get an email sent over the
next couple of days and pay the bill
it's a big investment i could probably
buy a really nice car for that same
amount of money but
it's the future it's electric cars it's
going to be cool
i mean look at these look how epic they
look
and um yeah so i'm biting the bullet i'm
doing it and then hopefully
in the next couple of weeks we'll be
able to start doing things i'm gonna try
and sell the engine out the back the
current engine
which is broken and then yeah we'll get
building i can't wait
one of the biggest costs of doing this
build is the
batteries which is the tesla model 3
batteries model s batteries going
through ev west was
like their cut their price in the
batteries was like pretty expensive so
jay who sent me a link to this guy on
ebay he's selling them for like
a thousand dollars each but he had 15
available so i'm offering him
to buy 14 for 10 grand which i think is
like 700 and something
dollars each which he's agreed to so
we've just arrived
and if they all check out okay like jay
who's going to just test that they're
all
working fine we've saved ourselves six
six thousand dollars in the bill so did
you
pull these out of uh a tesla wreck
yep model s p 85 d
so what we're looking for this is to be
24.
yeah about 24.4 20. yeah
you look great i'm excited
this is the first thing we purchased so
it makes me feel like we got some
momentum
we're actually going
[Music]
done yeah yep i love paypal
today is officially day one of actually
starting any work
on the van i'm super excited i just
sawed through
one of the brake lines and it's now
dripping brake fluid
