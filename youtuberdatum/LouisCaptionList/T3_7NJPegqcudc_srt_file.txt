justin just called uh and spotted
smoke coming out the back right tyre
again so
uh we've still got braking issues which
is not good
welcome back for another video guys i am
here with my
electric volkswagen van that you have
hopefully been following along the whole
build series
it's actually been a few months since i
left jehu's
workshop and i've got lots of updates
for you guys
some good ones some bad ones some issues
i've been going through
also i'm uploading a video giving you
guys all of the information on how much
it cost me in total
the range i'm getting out of it the top
speed and any other questions you've got
so make sure you subscribe if you
haven't already throw some questions in
the comments below
so i've got those ready but today's
video is going to be more
of just giving you guys an update so the
good news is
first of all you can see i've had it
polished so it's looking pretty nice
it drives okay there's a few little
issues still but it's
it's fine it dries fine it's charging
okay it's not quite the range i wanted
to get out of it but overall it's great
as a run around vehicle
the issues i've had are mainly to do
with running out of battery
and the brakes the brakes have been a
nightmare
not long after leaving jehu's workshop i
wanted to give the van a full
test and ambitiously decided to drive me
and my fiance
all the way to santa barbara which is
over 100 miles from la and
this is what happened we are heading off
on our first little road trip in the
in the wonder bug the new and improved
electric wonderbug
we still need to come up with a name i
might rename the van but
i just can we just take a second for how
quiet it is
literally silent
and where are we going we are going to
santa barbara just for a quick little
couple day um yeah get away
hopefully we make it without running out
battery
okay let's get the directions up
[Music]
i feel like fully relaxed
it's going pretty slow
i think we would have run out of battery
[Music]
um
[Music]
it could be something to do
so maybe it's just about like
going so i spoke to jehu who helped me
build the van
and he's saying because we were driving
so fast on the highway and it was up and
down
hills we'd definitely run the battery
flat
and because we don't have a fast
charging station at the house i was just
charging it from the 110 outlet which
normally takes like 30 hours to charge
from
dead so he thinks we left the house
with 75 battery to start with
so my calculations of getting here on a
charge
weren't accurate but good news is we're
only
how long half a mile 0.3 miles 0.3 miles
to the tesla
station now so we're letting the battery
just regenerate a little bit going for a
bit and then i'm pushing and then we're
switching it back and forth
how are you feeling i'm feeling good
yeah i'm just watching it
like look we're so close
i think sometimes with new
projects and inventions you kind of have
to have these experiences to be like
okay i don't want that to happen again
so i just need to be aware now the exact
voltage where my
van kind of runs dead so i can quickly
find a tesla charging station or
something
oh all right let's go again yeah let's
do it this is us that's the tesla
charging station
[Applause]
okay we're moving
oh this is a good one oh that's heavy
that is heavy
we got it it's all about getting a bit
of momentum
okay okay
how you feeling exhausted
just been pushing it
i think we've got a bit more juice
[Applause]
so this is uphill here and then it goes
down
so we're just trying to make it to the
top of this hill
[Applause]
okay break on i think that might be the
last pitch
yeah this is definitely downhill now
oh my gosh so where that's look it's
charging
it's going higher because it's
regenerative
yeah so
big question is coming across this road
it looks like there's a major road we
need to rush
okay we don't really want to stop
[Music]
it says i mean it seems to be yeah like
wherever it is
i think in here and right oh it's in
there it's in the hotel parking i think
oh my god should we check before you go
in somehow
can you see it
ah duck oh there we are yeah
we found it
[Applause]
we made it because this isn't actually a
tesla i bought this adapter
so this button here i'm going to base my
chargers onto this
[Applause]
i'm not even asking any anything from it
it's doing that
okay we've just found another charger so
the van's over there but
maybe this one will work
this is all uh learning lessons about
what works and doesn't work
i thought i could just plug a tesla
charger in but
it's not okay that tesla charger didn't
work
we just plugged in this one and i think
it's working okay let's see
let's test it so these two charge
support these two charges have just
turned on
so this indicates that it's charging
full speed
yes and then let's look at the voltage
that's coming in
oh yeah so we've just
sat here for like an hour maybe
and it looks like we've got a lot of
juice we went from 100 volts
which is super low to 141 but we should
have enough to get to our hotel now and
there's a tesla charging station right
by a hotel so that's the plan there was
a
kind guy william here who recognized me
from youtube and said we could stay here
indefinitely
um but we've got a hotel to go to so
we're gonna head off
are you ready to find our hotel please
okay
all right so during our drive to santa
barbara and back i'd been noticing the
brakes were scraping i know nothing
about braking systems
until the beginning of this project i
have had no prior mechanical
knowledge other than the basics and
being able to do oil changes and
tires and stuff but i knew there's
something up with the brakes i decided
now that i've done a lot of the build of
this myself i was like i can probably
change
brake pads or whatever so got back
researched which brake pads to get and i
changed the brake pads in the front one
of the calipers was stuck so i did all
this research managed to fix
these things and then i tried to bleed
the brakes
myself and did it too violently
and unfortunately um blew the
the back brake cylinders
which have like a rubber seal and they
push the brake shoes onto the drums in
the back so a vehicle like this it has
has two different types of brakes the
front tyres are brake discs which have
calipers and brake pads that push
against the disc
and then in the back they have brake
shoes that push against drums
anyway so the the front brakes are
replaced i then had to
fix the back brakes because i'd blown
the cylinders and then the
shoes were also worn so i replaced all
that
and my friend helped me like tighten it
all up get the brakes really solid and
working
anyway i had replaced the master
cylinder
we had to take the brake booster off and
this is something we didn't know at the
time you can't
run that master cylinder without that
booster
thankfully it'd been fine coming to
santa barbara and back somehow
but when i tried to drive with all the
brand new brakes on for some reason
the brakes jammed on and i was just
driving down the road and i
noticed the brakes were smoking i
noticed smoke was coming up someone like
beat the horn and
and like waved out the window they're
like your back wheels are smoking
so i didn't get far before the brakes
seized
and i was in the middle of the road i
was actually in the middle of lincoln
which is like a big main road
and i was trying to pull in and i'd
pulled across three lanes and the brakes
had completely seized
i was trying to drive and it wasn't
going so i put it in the lower gear i
think i might even put it in first i was
panicking
those cars coming and i put my foot down
on the pedal
the motor fully revved up
full power first gear and i heard a
massive banging noise
and something had broken and i was like
oh no
i was stuck the brakes were jammed on
the motor wasn't turning anything
i mean i was blocking traffic i was
blocking like three lanes of traffic
everyone's freaking out
i wish i had this on video but i didn't
you know i just wasn't thinking
of filming i was just trying to resolve
this issue anyway five guys ended up
pushing the vehicle literally it was
like skidding across the wheels weren't
even really turning so we skidded across
managed to get it to the side of the
road and i was just devastated i was
like oh man i thought i was convinced
i'd either broken the clutch or the
transmission and just gone
which is a mission it would have been
after all of that work i would have been
gutted to have to
like take all the motor off again and
replace all that so at that stage
my good friend travis came and picked me
up
and towed me down to long beach to get a
mechanic
to look at it did you want i was
thinking i could stay around for a few
hours and just help
remove this because i think we have to
see the clutch we have to check here
um in here and then test whether
the transmission oh wait
is that snapped off
[Music]
oh wow so maybe maybe that's the only
thing broken so what'd they say louie
okay so i thought it was a broken clutch
or transmission but it might just be
what is that called what's that part
that's not cv tv
axle has snapped which
is but it's turning when i drive so
maybe that's the only problem hopefully
yeah okay after weeks of playing around
trying to get the brake system working
properly we're still not there
the massive problem i had the other day
was it stopped working
and i think the axle this is what broke
we came down and had a look so that's
been replaced now
so hopefully it will drive okay let's
try this out
[Music]
justin just called and spotted
smoke coming out the back right tyre
again so
we've still got braking issues
which is not good
completely lost my brakes then
terrifying oh
my gosh i don't know whether the brake
pads
oh okay
luckily i had a little forex sticker
that is terrifying
i think that oh man
i think the uh the heat just burst the
have you toilet even heard of that
happening
have you ever even heard of that
happening that's so nice
this just extinguishes the flame but it
doesn't cool it down this is just powder
so i feel like we need uh
ah i feel like we need water
to like cool down yeah
that is unbelievably hot
uh we need to wait for the wheel to cool
down
this guy brought our hose over okay
rolling yeah yeah
you need to come around this side it's
like bubbling we need to take this spare
tire to
uh to get pumped up into the valve in
place
we're in a pretty bad spot too yeah
we should probably put that warning
triangle further down
still hot
it looks like
oh
[Music]
it looks like there's a tire place
literally five minutes drive
okay first tire place didn't have
any of these in stock so they suggested
another place
oh problem solving i should probably
find out if travis is even around to
tow me
[Music]
nice wheels back on
travis the guy who towed me down to long
beach in the first place said he's gonna
come get me so we
might be good yeah if you're free now
that would be a lifesaver
sweet all right thanks bro
what's gonna say oh what a lifesaver
okay i think we're good to go so we got
back from long beach
and uh the mechanic had thankfully
found the problem was the cb axe sword
snapped he did however say
that him and any other mechanic would
not touch the brakes because i'd
modified them from
how they were originally with the
booster and he's like you know no one's
gonna
take on that liability so that's
something i had to figure out myself
which was a bummer because i was like
really just wanting to get it all fixed
by this point so on the way back because
the brakes weren't fixed and he wouldn't
touch them they locked up again
the brake beds actually caught fire i
lost all braking
which was terrifying brakes caught fire
wheel blew up
so got back here the brake
shoes and the cylinders are in the back
wheels had completely disintegrated
again
so i had to replace the cylinders the
brake shoes and did some research
figured out that i had to install a
older model
master cylinder that master cylinder
never needed a booster
and was designed to work without it
that was great i installed that re-bled
the brakes carefully this time
installed all the new brake pads and
decided to take it for another test
drive
i again started having issues with the
brakes all right we've come to save
louie
because uh his brakes gave out again
louie louie louie it was so hot i
couldn't
i had to spend this long waiting to take
the wheel off because it was like
burning my hands
so i'm gonna i'm gonna take the other
wheel off and just double check
i've loosened the brake pads all the way
i don't know whether the emergency brake
was jamming on or the footbed will break
but the little only thing i haven't
replaced is the thing i need that
purple thanks so much for coming guys
yeah of course
i got justin to come over bring
my tools and this little adapter i need
to basically
there's this thing on this van called a
proportional valve
and apparently when they get old they
can jam the brakes on so i
bypassed that use this little adapter
and then i had to bleed the brakes again
i don't think i've done a great job but
it's drivable anyway i've been sitting
out in this car park for like two hours
under the van fiddling around getting
dirty
and i think i think i can drive
i'll keep you updated i'll let you know
how it goes but hopefully
we are nearing the end of the breaking
problems
i feel like it's been over a month maybe
two months of trying to get the break
sorted
it's honestly got to that stage where i
don't really want to vlog
these things happening but i feel like
i'm going to want to look back at this
time where i'm very frustrated
struggling to get things working
so yeah the brakes seem to be doing okay
not overheating but
suddenly the motor just stops running
and i'm just rolling
and there's no acceleration so i managed
to pull off thankfully rolled into this
side street off the highway but
i have no idea what's going on i can't i
cannot figure this out
massive relief guys i diagnosed the
problem
literally couldn't see anything wrong
with the bms or the controller and then
i looked in and saw
that this cable had come out of the lug
that was in the top of the controller
which is super dangerous i'm going to
try my best to get it back on
temporarily
and just tape up with some electrical
tape until i get back to crimp
good news that cable that come loose was
the only problem so we're driving again
everything's fine also the brakes aren't
jamming
i've checked a couple of times that the
drums aren't heating up which is where i
noticed the smoke before and
they're not hot at all which makes me
think the brakes aren't jamming
they're still not ideal like they're a
little bit slow maybe there's a bit of
air still in the brake lines but um
you know it's working what an adventure
what a freaking adventure
and the brakes have been fine since then
they still are just mechanical brakes at
this point and the dream scenario is i
get the engine braking working
so next video i am going to be heading
down to ev west where
i went originally and bought the whole
ev conversion kit
and they're going to help me try and
figure out and problem solve
why can't we get this engine braking
working why is there still some
interference between the brake
transducer
and the throttle which is the original
issue we had
when i was working on it with jehu the
brakes work fine for now
long term i'd feel way more comfortable
having the extra
added engine braking that is the pallava
the absolute mission and adventure i've
been on over the last
few months of trying to figure out the
brake system it's been very
infuriating very frustrating but i just
wanted to share
the reality of everything that's been
going on thanks for following along guys
i know there's a lot of new
people that have been following this
journey and yeah i appreciate all the
support and
encouragement and also advice because
obviously i am an amateur
and i haven't done everything in the
best way so i appreciate all of the
comments of concern but anyway the story
continues
and i am going to be updating you guys
still with this whole project until i'm
really happy i feel like it's going to
be an ongoing project with with many
iterations and tweaks and things
something i'm very excited to announce
that in the coming weeks i'm going to be
launching a podcast from this van
i've got the camera set up here so i'm
gonna have the camera here
guest sitting here obviously and we're
gonna be driving
going on adventures and actually going
and meeting
people with amazing stories and seeing
what they're doing
seeing the social projects so i'm really
excited to
film the first one of those this week so
i'll keep you posted on when we're going
to be
dropping that it's going to be probably
the long version of that is going on the
social good club
youtube channel which i'll link below
and then i'm going to be doing
shorter cut down versions on this
channel of the van adventures
the next few months there's going to be
loads of great content coming
other projects i'm doing other big
adventures
and also continuous updates on what's
going on with this fan
so yeah stay tuned subscribe i'll see
you next week
with some updates
