you know close your eyes and think about
all the little things in your life that
make you comfortable
and then imagine all of that being taken
away in just one foul swoop
how would you feel how the impact who
you
are that's all you need to do as another
person to recognize what a refugee is
going through
tonight a top un official is calling the
humanitarian catastrophe
unfolding in syria quote cruel beyond
belief
dozens of venezuelans waiting for food
many haven't eaten since the previous
day
when they were brought to this refugee
camp in bogota
hey i'm louie and today i'm sharing the
amazing story of my friend zelasht
a refugee from afghanistan who is now
thriving
having founded her own organization
which provides emotional support to
other refugees
this is a continuation of my refugee
series i started over a year ago
and today's episode is sponsored by
storyblocks
a subscription-based stock media service
for filmmakers to get the perfect clips
to enhance and complement their visual
creations and stories
and it's very affordable i actually
signed up for storyblocks this year
before they even reached out to sponsor
this video and i've been using stock
footage
in a couple of my latest videos you
might recognize my ice bath challenge
video
and the story of my best friend andy and
it's been ideal for story times and
building the intros to my videos
it's been a great resource to me and i'd
encourage any aspiring filmmaker
in need of extra footage to check them
out
link in the description there are
currently
almost 80 million people around the
world have been forced to flee their
homes
among them are 26 million refugees
over half of whom are under the age of
18.
that's 13 million kids i wanted to learn
more about the refugee experience
so travel to thessaloniki in greece with
my friend alaska
a syrian refugee who i met on my world
flight
where we met up with zalasht and heard
her story
it was just kind of an ordinary
life stuck in the middle of an
extraordinary situation which was
this huge conflict we knew that beyond
the walls
there was a whole other dangerous
horrible wall but within the
kind of confines of our garden we you
know i just
i just remember thinking like this is my
world you felt safe
it felt that my safety was under attack
so i felt safe in my home but i knew
that my home was under attack
and that any you know the the house
opposite
us was bombed going to sleep at night
would you hear
gunfire and bombs and everything around
yeah it was
you know i just sort of remember my
grandmother just running to the garden
when we were playing and she just
grabbed two kids and then go to to the
basement
as they would start you know launching
rockets and into kabul
so up until 11 you basically grew up in
a war zone
and it escalated to the point where your
parents were like this just isn't yeah
it was my dad never wanted to leave he
was always you know this is our home
this is where our family is
and and then it got to the point where
they had to make a choice i mean the
the couple was there was street by
street
but gunfights between different militias
so
you know it was just you couldn't go out
and get a loaf of bread like people were
shot
trying to get out and do their groceries
and so we had to leave there was no
other choice
did you find there was a big change once
you'd left
afghanistan and once you got to the uk
was it very different
for your family being together it was
completely different
i mean it still is and we we're kind of
still living that
because people were just sort of
scattered all over so we never
we just lost a big part of our family
life and
community life and my parents
you know they've never really recovered
from that what is your life now
so in 2015 i came back to the uk
from turkey i'd been working on the
syrian border in turkey for about 18
months
and seeing what was happening just kind
of confirmed to me
how important it is to emotionally
psychologically support people because
the
you know we sort of think about when
you're responding to a crisis we think
about the basic needs you know shelter
food and all of that but there's another
kind of very
basic human need for
um for emotional support because if
you've
literally run out of your home as a bomb
was being
dropped or you saw your child drown or
you know any of any of these things can
really um affect you for a very long
time
so i came back from from from turkey
with the intention
of doing something about addressing
what i saw as a psychological crisis and
within the refugee situation so i came
back
and i started working in calais
and you know because i speak farsi and i
speak a little bit of arabic
people just wanted to talk and they
wanted to have somebody listen
so out of all those different things i
started an organization called refugee
trauma initiative and what we do is
we build people's resilience again
so one of the things that happens if
you've
been exposed to something that is
potentially traumatic is you you close
up it's very isolating and the way to
to address that is to create spaces
where people feel connected again
and so we run groups where we use
art we use mindfulness we use movement
therapy
to help people connect and talk
and share their experience and feel
like they're part of a community and one
of the things that we use
a lot is mindfulness because if you you
know if you're somebody that's living in
a refugee camp you're either really
worried about your future
or you kind of grieving your past
and what mindfulness does it brings you
to the present moment it
really grounds you to where you are and
kind of helps you
recognize that you're safe here now i
was very close to my grandmother when i
was growing up and
once we left afghanistan i never saw her
again and i would say i never got over
that
i never you know there are moments even
now
sort of 20 something years later that
i'm just kind of there's a pang of just
sadness
what advice would you have
for people in the current situation
where they are a refugee
is there something that you would have
loved to hear that you now know
that you could have told yourself when
you first were in the process of fleeing
afghanistan and then when you arrived in
the uk
actually the the thing that as you say
that immediately comes to my mind it's
gonna sound
really cheesy but it's completely true
the first thing that happens when you're
a refugee you lose everything so you
lose your home you lose your job
and then and each juncture of your
journey
you can experience hostility you can and
so it erodes your
sense of self-worth and people can feel
like i don't master because you know
i live in a tent i've lost everything i
have
every time i open a newspaper there is a
headline that is
attacking me and that can really erode
that sense of who you are and so the the
the first thing i would say is that
you know you matter i think
the most important thing is
to recognize the humanity of the other
person
so when you talk about refugee crisis
people get sort of like oh my god it's
all about politics
and this and that and actually it's not
it's about
being a human being and that very
natural
instinct to survive that's why people
flee that's why people make those
journeys
what a solution to help bridge the gap
between
i guess an ignorant society that
hears these small narrow kind of
thing about the refugee crisis and and
has these pictures in their head you
know i was thinking about this a couple
of days ago because i heard something on
the radio and it really
it really resonated with me i feel
almost that we need to
turn the microscope around towards
ourselves
is what kind of society do we want to
live in
you know do we want to live in a society
where
people who are dying because of a
dictatorship
or a conflict that we won't protect
those people or that if unlike
if unaccompanied children that have been
sent away from home
because their life was in danger
do we turn them away you know that's i
feel like it needs to completely revert
and it can we need to kind of ask
ourselves like who do we want to be
would you say you experienced racism
growing up you know when you i mean when
you first arrived like when you were
we we definitely experienced racism i
mean the first
the first six months being in london was
really really tough
my family got attacked uh by races
my mom was physically physically
attacked um
you know the the prejudice and
discrimination
ebbs and flows based on what's going on
and
there's always a low level kind of just
like a
feeling sometimes when people ask you
just
you know too many questions to explain
yourself to say
you know what do you believe in this or
do better than that and i just sort of
think well
you're not asking the person next to me
to do that so
one of the nicest things actually about
being somebody who grew up in so many
different places
is you sit between lots of you you sit
in between lots of different things
and so sometimes people meet me and they
just they don't know what to do with me
you know because they
there's all these labels that they apply
like afghan women
refugee british and all that and it just
somehow doesn't
fit the categories they have in my head
and i can see them
visibly kind of disorientated and trying
to
reconcile what they think they know
about
all these different things and and what
they see in front of them
so that's you know that's quite cool
to kind of bring that home to people to
say look
identity is so broad and it's so
um multifaceted that you can't like
labels are helpful in some way but
they're really limiting and
to have a good understanding of the
world you need to just open your eyes a
bit more
as we are committing to dismantle
systems of racism around the world
let us treat one another with compassion
no matter what labels we carry this is a
time to reinvent our world
with greater unity and understanding
if you want to learn more about zalash's
organization refugee trauma
initiative and how you can help i'll
link them in the description
i'll also link resources on how to
influence local refugee policies where
you live
thanks for watching catch you next time
peace the need for psychosocial support
for refugees remains
high the people we serve have
experienced violence
forced displacement they may have lost a
family member
feeling emotionally strong is crucial
in building a new life in another
country this is why rti's work
is so important with refugees we help
kick-start their resilience in a
situation
where there is little support the work
that we do
is an essential part of the response to
the current crisis
with your help we can continue
delivering this vital service

you
