hey guys
it's been a little while
but i've got an update on the van and uh
yeah i'm going to be answering some of
your questions
about the van how's it how it's been
a lot of the information i haven't
shared yet so hopefully
this is a fun video i'm actually going
to be driving as well
whilst we're chatting this is the the
new
format i've got for my podcast which
i've been running out the van
so i'm basically driving around visiting
cool ngos and organizations with
some of my influencer friends and
yeah we're just chatting diving in deep
i actually just finished one
today with gabby hannah which was
amazing
and i'll be linking all the information
down below in the description
big announcement is i've now driven over
a thousand miles with the electric motor
in which is a huge milestone
and i couldn't believe it when i saw the
uh the odometer the myelometer
yeah so it's been over a thousand miles
i've mainly been driving
locally around la the two main
trips i've done were santa barbara
and san diego which aren't that far
but i'm kind of limited with range
a lot of you have asked what kind of
range have i been getting out of a full
charge
and honestly there's so many variables
involved if you've got an electro
electric vehicle you probably know this
but um
it really depends on like how fast i'm
going
primarily also then like what's the
what's the terrain like is it all uphill
is it very up and down or is it flat
i have been seeing a range of about
i think like 120
to 150 miles which is still good
especially when i'm
just using it around town and running
errands i've been driving it
literally all day today from 10 a.m
and i'm still fine with with my charge
so
uh so that's good before i jump into the
general q a
i wanted to let you guys know how much
this has cost me
so i spent ten thousand dollars on the
van originally
it was great for two years and then i
just had
terrible engine problems and ended up
breaking two engines
that cost me a lot of money but once i
brought the bus
into jehu's workshop and started working
on it
the batteries just the batteries alone
cost me 10 000
which was actually a really good deal
and
they could cost anywhere up to 20
thousand depending on where you're able
to source them
but i managed to get it for ten thousand
the kit and all the extras
was roughly around another ten thousand
dollars
uh some of you asked where i got that
kit from
and evie west who i visited
in previous episodes they provide
a whole kit which gives you everything
you need to build
your own electric conversion
amazing and then probably with the extra
cost of building the battery boxes
and some of the other engineering that
we had to do is probably an additional
five thousand so
roughly estimating i think i spent um
25 000 on the conversion
which i think is pretty good a few of
you have asked whether that was worth it
i definitely think so i've already saved
so much money on fueling the van whilst
i've been driving around
and even more importantly than that i
feel like this is a really
cool way to start experimenting with how
to
reduce my carbon footprint with
how to just think outside the box a
little bit about how we can
live more sustainably
and um a lot of you have pointed out oh
yeah but you know
lithium batteries and teslas and stuff
aren't sustainable
there's all this negative side to it but
the fact that i've recycled
uh a tesla battery bank that was being
disposed of
is even better it's up cycling
old waste and these batteries are going
to last for decades before
um i have to worry about disposing of
them or anything like that so
yeah it's not perfect but i really like
the idea of
being experimental with how we tackle
climate change
um the wasteful society we live in
trying to find ways to get off fossil
fuels being more sustainable in the way
we live so anyway
that was the that was the main drive
behind
reviving my beautiful beautiful van here
so i'm going to jump into some of the
questions
question number one is it working
clearly
it's working pretty well it's not
perfect and i think the last video i
made on the van
i was having some issues with the brakes
now as you can hear
still not completely resolved i'm still
trying to figure out
the issue with the regenerative
motor braking the actual electric
braking
but the mechanical brakes have been
working pretty well
they took a lot of adjustments and
figuring out but i'm i'm pretty
confident i feel safe driving with the
mechanical brakes but
i still would long term love to figure
out the electric brakes but i kind of
just run out of
time and resources to do that right now
but
it's it's on it's high up on my priority
list to fix that and i'll keep you guys
updated so yes it is working
um what year is the bus
well it's a 1973 volkswagen van
bay window it's not the split screen
that's kind of older
it's a safari camper conversion so it's
got like the full height
um it's not got the pop top or whatever
one thing i didn't update you guys about
was
my zero to 60 speed
and i've i've been struggling maybe
someone's got some suggestions but i
don't know where to safely do this
speed test um i could wait until
a road is quiet and there's no like off
turns or any chance of a car pulling out
and just
hammering it like drag a race on the
road it's nowhere near as fast as
some of the sports cars because um as
someone told me recently these high
high-top
volkswagen vans were voted the least
aerodynamic vehicle on the road
so um it's i'm not in danger of
going so fast uh i'm gonna endanger road
users around me but anyway i was going
to see if i could
rent out a race track and really let it
rip
uh i haven't been able to find one for
less than five thousand dollars it's
just not worth it to me but
um let me know if any of you guys know
anywhere in the la area i can safely do
a 0 to 60 test on this
um it's pretty nippy off the
off the start line if i'm in a low
enough gear i can just
wheel spin off and then the gear i
mostly drive around is in third
which uh is very rapid once i've hit
like 30 miles an hour but it's a bit
sluggish before that so
if some of you are confused i am using a
transmission so
i am using a gearbox and although i can
so i'm stationed in a stationary now and
i can drive
away in third gear which is different to
a normal car
um so i rarely take out third gear but
the other gears are there
are handy if i need to go up drive from
if i need to drive uphill i can put it
in second
and get more torque um and then if i'm
cruising on the highway i can go into
fourth if i want but anyway
it doesn't work quite the same but it is
still utilizing the transmission which
is a bit confusing but um yeah
when i get a chance i'll try and do a 0
to 60 speed
acceleration test and let you guys know
because i would like to do that
so another question is how does it
compare
cost wise to when i was running
with petrol gasoline and
it's about a third of the cost roughly
in california in other states it would
be cheaper but
i think it costs roughly from an empty
battery to full
about 10 to charge it um that's a rough
calculation and it's
equivalent of like 30 worth of fuel
from when i was running it before so
yeah it's about a third of the cost
which is pretty significant and i've
found a lot of places will let me
charge for free and there's actually
three charges available in like
whole foods and stuff like that and uh
yeah hotel
let me charge for free so i feel like
you'll find more places to charge for
free
someone's asking will i take this to
costa rica so
if you aren't up to date and you haven't
seen some of the announcements
me and my fiance raya are relocating to
costa rica we've actually officially
moved out of our house in la and we are
moving into my
school bus that i've had for a couple of
years it's been off the road
we've just got the mechanics to look
over it we've
built a whole roof rack on the roof
which
i will be making a whole video about on
this channel you can check out how i did
that
uh it was a huge project lots of fun and
eventually we're going to
convert it to veggie oil as well
so it doesn't run on diesel but it'll
run on veggie oil which
again is a creative way to
find a more carbon friendly way of
driving around so anyway because of that
i am actually going to leave my van this
van
in la at a friend's house and i'm going
to be flying back
regularly to run my podcast from it so
it's not really built for these long
thousands of miles road trips around the
place
it's going to be just too frustrating to
be charging it
so regularly but it is perfect for what
i want to do with it
which is keeping it in la
having fun trips hanging out with
friends
staying in the back when i'm in la you
know it's a camper van i can just sleep
in it
so that's what i'll be doing i might do
some local
trips in california and make some vlogs
taking you guys around showing you
california but yeah primarily this is
going to stay in la
for the foreseeable future and i'm going
to be making regular content
shooting podcasts with it and updating
you guys on how i get on if i
have any other issues or you know need
to fix anything
as you can hear it it's not silent once
you get to
a faster speed but that's mainly just
because of the
lack of uh sound insulation
in the van and uh it just creates
yeah like the tires on the road and the
wind rushing through and everything's
squeaking and banging so
at slow speeds it's quiet at faster
speeds it gets a little bit loud but
that's expected for some of the more
technical specs that i haven't told you
guys
i'm going to link stuff in the
description because i need to verify
things and i can't double check whilst
i'm driving but um
yeah i'll link i'll link more of the
technical specs
of the system and i'll link to the
kit that i bought from evie west as well
in the description
someone has asked did i ever consider
doing a subaru engine
swap instead of electric and
um yeah i did a lot of
people with these vans put in super
engines because they they fit pretty
well you can just switch them out
and they're water cooled they're more
reliable
but for me i just was excited about the
idea of going electric instead
even though it presents a whole bunch of
other problems or potential issues
like range and charging time and stuff
like that
i was just more excited about the
concept of having an electric
vintage van and talking on charging time
it's pretty slow right now because i
haven't been staying with somewhere with
a specific electric car charger
so i had to uh charge off the mains
which definitely
was slower um it sounds crazy but from a
completely empty battery it was probably
like
30 hours to charge it fully but the
reality was i wasn't
completely emptying the batteries every
time i went out
and if i just did a little errand or
went down to the store or went to see a
friend
and back and plugged it in it would be
fully charged again by the next morning
which is fine because i'm not needing to
like drain it completely
quickly fill it up again and go out and
i also think that's
from what i heard it's a lot better for
the batteries if you're not
completely draining it and fast charging
it and then draining it again
i have installed three charges so if
it's a high enough amp
charger i can charge a lot faster i
think the fastest i could charge right
now would be seven hours
if i had the right charger um
i was looking into ways of potentially
charging faster because the batteries
have the capability too
but uh that will probably have to be a
future video if i ever figure that out
but the moment it's yeah between seven
to 30 hours
depending on um what kind of
electrical connection i have oh by the
way i sold
my previous broken engine for a thousand
dollars so that was
something i wasn't expecting to do but
that was cool a bit of bonus money to
put towards the costs
uh what happened to my vlogs this isn't
uh van related but um
yeah i slowed down making daily vlogs
about my life
and i think i've mentioned this before
just because
you know what i just lost the passion a
little bit and uh
i feel like i'm in a new chapter in my
life good news is though
me and raya are going to be vlogging
three times a week on our new couple's
channel
as we start this road trip across
america
in our school bus we're eventually going
to drive all the way down to
costa rica in it it's going to be an
epic epic adventure
and i think if you're missing some of my
old vlogs um you've got to head over
and subscribe to our couples channel
because there'll be a lot more of that
classic old daily vlog style content
going there and then i think on this
channel
i really want to update you guys with
fun projects i'm working on whether it's
like working on the van
doing some conversion work on the school
bus and eventually building my house
down in costa rica so
that's the plan at the moment someone's
asked am i going to build out the inside
and my answer is yes it wasn't a
priority for me
initially i just wanted to get the
electric motor in but as you can see
it's all original 1970s conversion on
the inside
and it's kind of falling apart a little
bit i like
partly the retroness of it but i think i
could do a really
fun kind of revamp of the inside
um at some point in the future so yeah
that will definitely be a future
series that i'll do like redoing the
interior
but right now i'm kind of happy just
to have this back on the road and
driving um so yeah i think
probably that will be like an end of the
year
project to be honest yeah what
one issue that is does need fixing
pretty urgently is um my
parking brake doesn't work
at all really so i've been uh
whenever i stop i've got these like
i've got these like uh i don't even know
what these are
these are for like leveling
vans or like blocking wheels or whatever
and i i put these blocks
under the tire just to make sure i don't
roll
um which is actually super effective
oh two people have asked whether i'm
going to convert the happiness bus which
is the school bus
to electric um it's
just not plausible right now with the
weight of that bus
the amount of batteries you'd need and
the
range you'd get would be pretty bad
so that's what i'm saying veggie oil
it's not carbon free but it's
better than burning fossil fuels it's
not perfect for the environment but it's
not
introducing new carbon into the
environment it's part of the existing
carbon cycle because it's burning
literal vegetables so yeah i think
that's the plan
is in the next hopefully six months is
doing a full veggie oil conversion so i
can just run and recycle the vegetable
oil
show up at restaurants pour oil into my
bus
it filters it all and then i can drive
and
um yeah i don't know
quite where to start with that yet so if
anyone's got some suggestions or knows
what they're doing or who's done that
please reach out
and because i think that'll be quite a
fun
thing to figure out oh
someone said this is slightly off topic
when is the beyond borders dock being
aired in the uk
guys i just got news i literally got
text message like an hour ago saying
it's dropped in the uk
today so if you're watching from the uk
and you've wanted to watch the
beyondborders documentary that
me and jp produced and released this
year
it's finally being released in the uk so
you can watch it on
discovery plus someone said would i do
another
electric conversion honestly i would
what i would really love to do is get
have a 4x4
rough like off-road vehicle
in costa rica that we could take through
rivers and stuff
i don't know whether that's a homemade
electric conversion project i don't know
whether i would trust myself to do that
but it would be fun alternatively
save up a ton of money and buy one of
the new
like trucks or off-road vehicles that's
going to come out whether it's like
the tesla truck or the rivien is another
one that i saw on
the long way up with ewan mcgregor
they rode up from the south point of
south america to la
on these electric harley davidsons and
then they had the rivien trucks
following them all electric that's fun
so yeah i'm inspired and i think i will
do an another electric project in the
future
the other thing i want to do is have a
road trip vehicle based in the uk that i
can take around europe when i go back to
europe to visit
so i would like if any of you have
contacts in the uk with
electric vehicle companies or
know about doing electric conversions in
the uk i would like to
figure out some kind of fun road trip
vehicle that has
longer range and um
yeah that's a future project lots of
future projects
someone's asked whether it would ever be
autonomous
no there's the difference between this
and a tesla is quite extreme
teslas are all built to work
together in this beautiful um
hardware and software um
ecosystem where they all it all is
beautifully connected and it knows
what's going on and it has sensors
everywhere
literally all i've taken from a tesla
for this is the batteries
and uh put in a different brand electric
motor and there's
nothing intelligent about this van
literally it just
press you just press the pedal and it
engages the motor
um whereas a lot of electric cars and
modern cars in general
uh having incredibly intelligent
computers they're
they're like i saw one uh marquez
brownlee posted today where
you can adjust the mirror and it detects
which mirror you're looking at
and it's the same buttons to move the
mirror up or down and left to right
and instead of having to select which
mirror you just have to look at it
so that's the kind of technology that
i'm excited to
play around with in super high-tech
vehicles that are like
finished but i think doing home diy
project electro
electric vehicles is a completely
different thing so i think this
don't think this will ever be autonomous
do i have range and anxiety
actually i do i do feel the other day i
went to pick up some wood
to put on the deck of the school bus
and i was convinced i was going to run
out of battery i'd been running around
doing errands all week and i just hadn't
had a chance to top it up
and um oh yeah i was convinced i was
going to run out of battery and i was
like no
and i was like driving real slow and
trying to like coast down
down the hills and thankfully i didn't
but i have had
three scenarios now where i've run out
of battery because i'm an optimist
and um and yes didn't have the range
unfortunately
but i'm getting i'm understanding how it
works now making sure i charge up
and uh yeah it's just you just don't
have
quite the same sudden turnaround you
can't just pull into a gas station and
fill up like you have to
plan out a little bit more which
hopefully when when there's more
superchargers and better technology it
will
that won't be a problem but right now
that's a problem oh someone's asked if
i'm going to add solar
i think i would like to i think that
would be another
cool way to trickle charge the batteries
when i'm not using it rather than
using electric uh like from a main
socket
i think you don't have quite a lot of
solar panels to make any real difference
and if you were using it constantly you
probably wouldn't notice but
um because i'm going to be parked up in
between using it
i think solar would be a pretty cool
idea
and i'd like to get some kind of
flexible solar panels that i could put
on the
on the roof so yeah i think solar is
definitely a cool option i don't think
you could
only drive with solar charging i think
you'd literally have to wait
for days and days and days in between
having your batteries charge up with
solar but
i think it's a good um addition to
other charging someone's asked whether
there's any issues with the clearance
height
and thankfully not i've been driving all
over the place and i haven't
uh grounded out on anything yet i do i
think long term i should probably raise
this suspension a bit but
um for the moment it's been pretty good
and i've even had a few passengers in
here and it hasn't
weight it hasn't weighed it too low um
so yeah i'm pretty happy i was worried
to start with and jehu was worried that
the battery boxes are just sitting too
low and they could hit something but
as long as i'm not driving off-road and
being stupid
you know i've been driving over speed
bumps dips in the road
nothing's hit yet so fingers crossed
everything's gonna be fine
top speed i probably hit like 80 miles
an hour in this honestly
um the whole van
is like shaking and like i said it's not
aerodynamic at all so
it it's probably not designed to go 80
miles an hour i think with the original
engine like
maybe you could hit 65 70 max but um
yeah the electric motor does give it
some more power but i wouldn't cruise
around at 80 miles an hour i think i've
been trying to cruise around at like 50
which i think feels comfortable
finally people just saying what what are
the pros and cons and i'd say so far
having driven it a thousand miles
i'd say the pros are
it really does feel like i'm doing my
part um
in trying to explore ways to be
more sustainable and lower my carbon
footprint i think
that that is something that's legitimate
and
it feels nice to be able to um yeah get
off fossil fuels in that way
i feel incredibly it's incredibly
rewarding knowing that i did
a lot of this work myself uh it honestly
feels like in my head like built a
vehicle from scratch but i know i didn't
but i feel like as i put it all together
and built the battery boxes and put so
much
manual labor in it does feel incredibly
incredibly rewarding to
be finally driving it around and um
other pros yeah it's quiet uh there's no
fumes
i honestly feel like it's very reliable
as long as i've charged it i feel
like this is going to last for decades
so i feel
it's reliable it's
very rapid like definitely faster
acceleration and top speed than
the original engine and
yeah i just feel like it's it's a great
talking point
people love looking at it asking
questions
um yeah it's been honestly for
everything other than long road trips
it's been fantastic much better than
a gasoline typical engine
cons are um the charge time is longer
than i
hoped the mileage that i can get out of
it is less than i hoped i was hoping for
200 miles but yeah like i said it's like
more like 130 and
there's still a few issues going on with
the braking system not being as
effective as i wanted
and i think just typical things that you
struggle with with having an older
vehicle there's still like
creeks and screeches and things that i'm
trying to figure out how to fix um but
yeah overall the pros massively outweigh
the cons i'm so happy i've done this
conversion project
i'll be keeping you guys updated with um
little anything that happens any updates
any
improvements i make on it whether i'm in
converting the
interior or managed to fix the
electronic braking
or managed to do a 0 to 60 test all of
these things i'll keep you guys updated
i'll make some videos
but on this channel now i am
transitioning to making more content
around the school bus
so as i said me and raya are traveling
across the country in the school bus
starting this week i'll be documenting a
lot of the bills the roof rack any adapt
adaptations i do to the school bus
installing the veggie
oil system and then a lot of our
day-to-day fun kind of just travel
vlogs and daily content will be over on
our couples channel which i'll link
at the end of this video here and yeah
i'd love
to continue making fun projects on here
continue updating you guys
and yeah i'm really excited to
show you what we do the school bus and
then also eventually this year get down
to costa rica and start documenting
and designing our whole house and what
we're building on our land
and that whole adventure as well so lots
to come
and uh yeah don't forget to subscribe to
the couple's channel
go over and subscribe to the podcast
channel as well where i'll be dropping
the podcasts
next month and uh yeah peace out
enjoy life and live the adventure boom
