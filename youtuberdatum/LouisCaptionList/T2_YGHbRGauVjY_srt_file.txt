[Music]
i just sawed through
one of the brake lines this battery is
completely dead
i'm wearing rubber gloves just in case
[Music]
we're moving
[Laughter]
right almost six days later let's check
out
how this is gone this epoxy
looks pretty solid i won't know how
strong it is until i lift it up by this
bracket
well the rail feels pretty solid the
battery
tests okay so i think we're back in
business
which is a huge relief the next task i
have on my hands
is to create blocks these blocks are
going to be
bolted onto the boxes so then they're
going to mount onto the plates
that are going to be welded onto the
vehicle underneath frame
so i've got 20 of these plates i think
this is eighth of an inch
stainless steel plates so i'm going to
be drilling holes
through the center of these blocks then
i'm going to be tapping those holes
with this which is going to allow me to
use this m8
bolt here i'm then going to drill four
holes in the corner
that will be bolted onto the inside of
the box
here is an example i'm just going to
show you where this is actually going to
go
so this plate is going to be welded at
the top there
and then bolt on to this block and the
block is going to be mounted
onto the onto the box like that
[Music]
[Music]
i've got all of these blocks and i'm now
bolting them onto the side here so i'm
just measuring out and then
we'll need to bolt them from underneath
now i have these blocks on i'm going to
just mount these
plates ready and then i can line up and
find out exactly where we need to weld
them
i've lined up the box and marked where
the
plates need to be welded i've got this
angle grinder just to
expose the bare metal ready to weld onto
[Music]
i have cleaned all of the areas where
we're gonna weld i've got more
down to bare metal these are the most
critical
welds of the whole build because they're
holding
the heaviest battery box on so i'm going
to get joe
who has had a lot more experience in
welding to do those weld joints just
because
the only welding i've ever done was like
the other day welding something that's
not even that critical just like
holding a tiny pipe from rattling if
these fail
we're in serious trouble oh we are
getting there guys we are
we are getting there
[Music]
[Music]
uh
[Music]
i've uh hoisted the box into position
and slightly miscalculated the um
where these needed to go so they're off
it shouldn't matter too much i can go
here it'll just mean that it's going to
be off-center but
this whole thing's been a kind of
learning curve
i don't know how i got those
measurements so wrong i think basically
when i
lined up the box it was slightly wonky
because i hadn't put the the top sheets
on yet to keep it from
kind of twisting but yeah it should be
okay this size much better
[Music]
i have mounted the blocks onto the
other quadruple battery box these are
the two main ones that are going to be
underneath i'm not too worried about the
single battery boxes they're going to be
so much easier
it's looking good i've got all those
brackets that i cut from the length of
angled steel that i
bought they're going to be welded on one
here and then one
i think kind of here
[Music]
i have just tied the box up there again
and i've
marked out where i want to weld these
brackets to
okay i've bolted all these on and this
is the final little bracket we're trying
to make
so back to some welding
[Music]
caught fire
[Music]
i am on the final mount for these two
big boxes the main boxes i'm having a
little bit of difficulty because it's
slightly misaligned and i don't have to
re-drill another hole
so i'm going to just kind of drill
diagonally kind of make
making that hole a bit more oval so i
can get the bolt in
the other problem i've spotted
i didn't use washers and it's been
grinding
down the uh the thin aluminium
sheet like the the side of the box as
you can see here it's like
digging away at it and that'll
eventually pop through
and that'll create like a really weak
spot where
it's supposed to be holding all the
weight so i'm gonna get some
little washers these are actually too
big but basically
something like this anyway i'm almost
there i'm almost there
this is my last job of today and then
i'm gonna head back
[Music]
well that's it guys i have mounted the
boxes
this has been the biggest task yet i'm
pretty confident this is going to hold
all of the batteries and it's quite easy
to like
unbolt them i can take them down again
like fit all the batteries and then just
quickly bolt them back
cool this is a good milestone
right i've got an interesting dilemma
the next phase is
basically going to require a lot of
welding i've done a tiny bit of welding
the other day
it's a little bit scary and i don't
really know what i'm doing
so jay who helped with the major
brackets that are going to be holding
the main battery boxes just because i
don't really trust
like five minutes of welding experience
but he can't help with the welding
tonight tomorrow
and i was just going to call it a day i
was just going to head home
because i was intimidated to do the
welding myself i was like
you know i'll let him do it when he's
got free time we are kind of
against the clock now i'm going to try
and do this welding myself i'm going to
watch a few youtube videos just to get
some pointers
jay who's giving me some pointers other
than that i think it's just diving in
the deep end which i have done with most
of this
whilst i've been here i've allowed
myself the occasional red bull just to
give me that
buzz and i need one right now just to
give me that
energy even though i'm gonna crash from
sugar and caffeine overload
i've also realized i should probably
have some kind of protective clothing on
i don't have any because it's so hot
right now
and i've just been working topless
because
i can just jump in the bath when i get
home but the uh
flying sparks of molten metal may burn
me
so i'm gonna try and be careful
[Music]
it's not going great so far i've burnt a
hole connecting two bits of metal i've
just burnt a hole straight through it
yeah so this was supposed to be a nice
clean bead
and i guess i held it over there for too
long and burnt the whole straight
through it i'm gonna
kind of do these spot welds along these
joints and see how that let's see how i
get on with that
i'm kind of getting there so i've i
grinded that down a little bit filled
that hole in
i made and then i've got a couple of
these messy joins which i'm going to try
and tidy up a bit
[Music]
i don't know if i'm improving i'm trying
i feel like
20 of what i'm doing is all right and
then the other 80
is pretty messy but the main question
for me is
is it strong if it holds and it's like a
strong enough bond
i don't care if it looks a bit messy
because i can kind of grind it down
but we'll see i'll get jay johue to
assess everything after i've done it
[Music]
it's looking good
some of the molten metal hit my shoulder
and burnt me quite badly so i'm just
putting an ice pack on it you may be
thinking i'm stupid for welding with the
top off
and you probably are right my tops off
firstly because it's like
40 it was 42 degrees celsius here today
and it's still like 39 or 40 and it's
nighttime
so it's swelteringly hot secondly i
completely forgot to bring
a long sleeve top so i've got like a
tank top a vest top
but that would have made no difference
so next time i weld
and learn from my mistake wear proper
overalls and even these gloves aren't
proper like i've
been burning the back back of my hands
because
they're just it's just thin material
jehu
has wired in all of the connectors
the battery management system i've been
welding
and screwing and grinding and getting
this all
in so this is the second to last battery
box
it's been a pretty successful day
welding these brackets in
lining it all up attaching these uh it's
been quite complicated because there's a
lot a lot less space
and then i've basically got to do the
exact same again on the other side
hopefully a bit quicker learning from
some of the little mistakes i've made
after working all night welding and
everything
i got to bed at 7 30 in the morning i
started again at lunchtime so i haven't
slept much but we just hit a
major milestone in the project guys i
have
successfully mounted all of the battery
boxes
so check this out oh my gosh so
two in there two in there two and there
two and there two and there and then
these are singles
and they are all bolted on securely they
are looking
great the next step is putting the
batteries in
and measuring out where the connectors
need to be i've got some diagrams that
i've drawn out
in photoshop so those are the battery
boxes
that's the main wiring for the batteries
going
in and out of the terminals then that is
the
cooling system that's how i'm gonna put
all the cooling pipes in
those pink ones are where the battery
management system
ports are gonna be so the only box i
haven't mounted
is the one that's gonna be going in the
back here where the fuel tank used to be
so that's gonna be inside the vehicle
i'm not gonna have to worry so much
about
it being um held from underneath
i think we can just mount that way way
easier um
so that's the first box i'm gonna
attempt to um fit these
cable connectors they're like the the
ports basically that the cables go in
to then clamp onto these terminals
and then these will go on there on the
positive and negative
you can see this this is where the
terminal is going to go and then the
cable's going to come
out in there it's perfect and then this
thing tightens around the cable
[Music]
next job is cutting a square hole
it's going to be here bang in the middle
either side of the battery terminals
um what i'm thinking with this is
i'm going to drill a round hole because
you can't drill square holes
i'm gonna drill a round hole and then
i've got a
jigsaw and i'm just gonna cut around
like this
[Music]
okay i think that's me done
for the night um i have built all the
boxes
these are the little holes to the bms
connectors that
jv's made up upstairs this is ready for
the main
lug that'll connect the big cables
motor and then these ports here
[Music]
are going to be for the cooling system i
have
connected all of these six batteries
together this is the input
the top and bottoms are in parallel and
then these are in series
so there's three parallel modules
actually
six paralleled into three and then
linked in series
here so positive and
negative
[Music]
i have these cables that jehu's made up
and i'm going to install them now so
i've cut the holes
ready in the boxes so you can see here
these square holes and then these little
connectors here
these are going to clip onto
see those connectors in there and clip
onto those connectors
that's all going to feed back to the
battery
management system which is going to keep
an eye on the batteries and tell us if
there's problems
[Music]
okay the boxes are in
most the cabling's done and i just
started
putting in the coolant pipes as well
