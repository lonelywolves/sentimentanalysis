[Music]
i just sawed through
one of the brake lines this battery is
completely dead
i'm wearing rubber gloves just in case
[Music]
we're moving
[Laughter]
i just got a message from jay who's
saying i should drop
the van all the way down and see how low
the batteries are to the floor once the
suspension kind of
goes in to see if there's enough room i
feel like this is pretty late in the day
to check this
i guess the worst case scenario we have
to somehow raise the suspension which
could be a whole nother ordeal but i'm
hoping
the clearance is gonna be okay
well i don't know exactly
what i'm looking for but nothing's
touching and
it doesn't seem crazy low have a little
luck yeah i mean it's low
but i mean i could just be careful not
not going off-road or anything
i'm going slowly over speed bumps i've
had a good idea guys
so jay who said i need to find a way of
mounting
these charges which is what i plug into
the mains or
big battery charger to charge the
batteries to mount them on this battery
box
so i've been trying to figure out how to
do it this is the controller which is
going to sit on top of the motor there's
not a lot of room here
so i've got to clear this so this big
hole
here this is the i guess the engine
access
kind of flap that used to be if you
wanted to get into the engine from up
here
so my idea is we mount these on the
engine access flap
and then just bolt them in here then
we'll just slot in the top there and the
chargers will be just be hanging here
pretty cool right
oh wow they fit so well and i guess i
could mount two more
up here maybe that's great whoa
oh that is amazing isn't that great yes
that's way better than i expected it oh
man you can put
two more up there yeah yeah
yeah i just bought them free right next
project
is this is gonna mount in here and then
i'm gonna be able to open the
what used to be the petrol flap and then
plug my charger in
i think i've done it guys check it out
i just need to unscrew this so we can
put the cable in but
it's pretty good like that
joey who just sent me this as a
schematic
for wiring in the contactor box
hmm right
not quite sure where to start with this
[Music]
so i'm finishing off the contactor box
this is all a bit of a puzzle
trying to fit everything in i need to
mount this
on the back trying to utilize as much
space as possible and then that's going
to
mount onto a bracket inside there
there's a lot of
attaching cables today especially the
main job for the rest of the build is
just
connecting all the cables together
so you you already have an idea of where
it's gonna go which was this one
that's a little thing that you oh yeah
okay that's the thing that we put in
there that's the little one yeah
i always like to put a sleeve in here
so that you don't have exposed cables
otherwise you get this
spaghetti yeah
so then yeah you just find the thing to
put that in there and then that goes
underneath here and then from here just
start pulling cables where they go
this is the cable through the connector
this is how i'm gonna get all my power
yeah okay
i have climbed up into the cab of the
van we're still kind of high up in the
air what i need to do
is figure out somewhere to mount this
display so this is going to tell me
the percentage of battery i have left
when i'm driving a little bit like a
fuel tank gauge
this one looks spare but it doesn't kind
of properly fit that could be cool
the other thing i'm thinking is i could
just drill a hole here and have it
mounted in there
the other option is like maybe building
a little box and mounting up here or
here or something
which seems like a lot of effort get rid
of the air vent maybe i should kind of
look here and see how easy that is to
get to
it looks like a mission
oh well i'm trapped
i'm still undecided
oh yeah oh yeah
i'm happy with that
okay
oh yeah that looks nice it protrudes a
bit
but um i think that's more accessible
than being like in here because when
you're driving if you want to check
anything
it's super dangerous to stick your
fingers through the steering wheel
because you have to turn suddenly
i mean that does more look more less
aesthetically athletically aesthetically
i'm tired does it more aesthetically
cleansing pleasing
pleasing that does look more
aesthetically
pleasing but this is more practical and
i don't mind that it sticks out i have
measured out the back
where i need to mount this and i've
drawn
out the measured area that we need onto
this cardboard it's not quite right
there's some
bits i need to cut still but i'm going
to put this in place and see if it works
and then i can use this to trace onto
the metal before i cut it
it's exactly the right size i just need
to cut these
little back edges but yeah it's a
perfect fit and then i need to figure
out whether
the motor is going to sit under this or
whether this needs to come up a little
bit
or cut this middle section out and then
i've bought some metal
rails to use as kind of a frame
for it to sit on so i'm gonna have these
across here
and and bracketed on either side just to
hold
weight in the middle i'm gonna put the
motor in place just to measure out for
the shelf that i'm building
um i'm not installing it properly i'm
just gonna pull it in but this is going
to be the first time
the motor's going in and i'm super
excited
okay we have a bit of a problem um
there's this little o-ring that needs to
be pressed into the flywheel
which then attaches to the motor before
we can install it
and it's already like 7pm on a friday
night and i have to get this done
so i'm going out to see if there's a
press we can use without having to
buy one okay i needed this part pressed
but
these machines are like a thousand
dollars and we didn't have one
so i just came in and tested tested the
machine in store
and we've got our part pressed which is
pretty good
thanks harbor freight
[Music]
so
this shelf that i'm building out of
aluminium i'm actually going to cut down
the middle so it was easier to slide in
and out because
if not we would have had to put this in
first and then kind of
shimmied it up and put the motor
underneath but i think that's in
insanely trouble
i think the plan now is we are going to
try and mount
the motor which is going to be fun
getting this in so
we are just putting some of the things
on the motor which we need to connect in
with the transmission on the van
and this is the coupler
needs to be heated up to 600 degrees
fahrenheit
and then put in place and then it
contracts
really really tight so we've been
heating this
this is a thermal camera like something
you can connect in with your iphone but
basically
check this out so you can see where the
heat is
and tells you the temperature gives you
like a temperature readout
oh i see it it readjusts itself
what those colors are and the super
bright ones they're 626 degrees is it
hot
ah there you go piece of cake so quick
did you feel the heat no no this well
that was
that was fast yeah
[Music]
[Music]
wow
[Music]
i guess it wants us to put these washes
on as well yeah
[Music]
oh no
bad news we were moments away from
mounting
the motor and i got a little bit excited
with the impact
drill and broke one of the bolts
this bolt is now broken off in whatever
the flywheel attaches into so i'm gonna
have to get
there's a special tool that you can put
in to take
broken bolts out don't have to get one
of those in the morning
it's been a very frustrating morning
i've been driving to
multiple home depots and lows and car
auto zones and everything to try and get
these little bolts i need for the
radiator
but they're super specialists so can't
get them but i have had my first
triumph of today basically you know that
bolt that i snapped off
i've managed to put in a bolt extractor
so it's like a special tapered drill bit
and then watch this
if i pull this out now
[Music]
there she is
wow okay so i'm ready to put a fresh
bolt in
and then hopefully push the motor into
place
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
um
[Music]
is mounted
[Music]
[Music]
okay i've mounted this frame for the
radiator
so these are the the rods that go across
and then i've just put these
cardboard cut outs of the shelf in place
if i slide those off quickly you can
have a look at the frame
these will be made out of metal
momentarily these are nice and snug
hopefully the dimensions are kind of
perfect so there you go
there is the frame i just need to mount
another fan in there
oh it's looking so good and then got the
on off switch
for all of the oh i need to bolt that in
still but
that will isolate the batteries and then
control box in there okay i'm now
installing this din rail which these
fuses clip
onto and that's going to complete the
connector box i'm just going to screw
this on
there and then this 12 volt charger is
going to go on the back
and that's going to charge my 12 volt
battery which will power like the lights
and
my sound
i have systems out these
two halves of the shelf from the
cardboard
onto the aluminium sheet and now i'm
going to
cut this and hopefully it'll just slot
straight in
we might have to do a few jigsaw bits
but we'll see
this is mainly for straight cuts so
definitely one here
and here
[Music]
do
[Music]
okay moment of truth
[Music]
it doesn't quite fit i'm going to cut
this edge here
[Music]
that's it baby oh blade it's clean
i am stopping for the night i'm pretty
happy with the progress
basically we've got to the point now
where the only things left to do
is wire everything and everything else
is ready there's a few more screws to
put in oh yeah and once the cables are
all connected i'm gonna
screw the bottom of the boxes on but
this is ready to roll now we have the
main on off switch
the connector box the reservoir for the
radiator which is here
we're gonna have some uh cooling fluid
run underneath into this
and also into these two pipes on the
control box
got the motor in and then the two
chargers
this is pretty amazing i think what's
most amazing about this is
i've learned all of this in the last
couple of months like i've had literally
no idea
some very basic electronics knowledge
but i've just
yeah been learning a lot really dived in
the deep end with this project
and i'm i'm really proud i think this is
like probably one of my proudest
achievements
building this van i mean it's so outside
of my
skill set oh so close now
all right i've just spent the last few
hours making this
which is the in port for charging
and because we're gonna have to select a
different amount of charges depending on
the power that we're putting in jay who
had the idea of fitting these buttons
so i had to completely redesign what i
initially had
and shown you guys which is very simple
mount it then got super complicated
but it's all done now and it's bracketed
on and now i just need to
wire all these in this is the diagram
that jay who's drawn me on a piece of
paper towel
for the four switches at the top they
each go to a relay
which we've got to get another box for
then those relays go to the chargers
this is our little relay box
and this is this is what the relays look
like
these are going to glow blue when
they're on and now i am
soldering the cables i'm following that
diagram
that jj gave me that is
i've just soldered on these four
white wires which are going to go to the
relays i've got to do the red
wires coming off here yeah it's going to
be soldering all day
i've been trying to find the the most
efficient fastest way to solder
and then i'm using this heat gun as i
did before to get the shrink wrapping
over the joints so it's all protected
[Music]
yeah i'm gonna feed this through and
start running these cables where they
need to go
i've protected them all with this
shielding yeah i think we can bolt this
into position now i guess
which is pretty cool i'm setting up
another little workstation here
under the bus so i can do soldering and
stuff here because
now i kind of need to do it in position
i don't have the luxury of doing it over
there on the table
this is pretty complicated for me i'm
figuring it out i keep texting jehu
because he's home right now
asking him advice but i feel like i'm
bothering him
so i've stripped soldered and insulated
the wires
now i have just given a bit of thought
to this diagram
that jehu is drawn he's shown three
charges here i actually only have
two charges but i can get more charges
and i definitely think i will it'll
basically just speed up how fast i can
charge depending on
where i'm charging from but i am
wiring this in to make it easy for me to
add charges because if i
separate each individual cable and and
insulate them
it's just going to be more of a pain to
have to start stripping and cutting
wires when i add another charger so
that's the plan i'm going to try and
future proof
this installation so i can easily add
maybe two more charges
the relays have been mounted and i just
bunched up the wires in there
in that box and then somewhere this
it's just gonna slot over the top there
and neaten it all up
and just weatherproof that and these
relays
are taking a 12 volt input from the
little switches
i've got mounted up here these little
switches and then
what relays do is they take the the
lower voltage
and they activate the higher voltage
current so where you're switching is not
running like a high voltage like
110 or 240 volts jj said i should run
a 12 volt supply and just check the
relays are actually working so so i'm
going to try now
i think now if i press these
[Music]
oh it worked i don't know if you could
hear that guys but
basically i'll press this button and
listen to this
hear those clicks oh my gosh this is so
good
here is a color version of the schematic
the wiring schematic i've been working
from this black and white one which
is fine for now but i'm gonna i'm gonna
need to start figuring out which wires
are which
i've also highlighted blue here the
wires that are gonna be running from
the back to the front of the van which
i'm gonna put in a bundle now
and thread through underneath so i'm
gonna measure those out
and there is a lot of work still to do
we
have a major problem we
fled the brakes last night and as i was
testing the pedal
the master cylinder which is like where
the brake fluid is and it feeds the
brakes
it started leaking which is basically
we can't use the brakes
