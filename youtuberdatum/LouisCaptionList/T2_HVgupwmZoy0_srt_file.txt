[Music]
i just sawed through
one of the brake lines this battery is
completely dead
i'm wearing rubber gloves just in case
[Music]
we're moving
[Laughter]
today is officially day one of actually
starting any work
on the van i'm super excited to start
off with jay who's advised that i
get a jet washer and clean all the
underneath the bus
any loose anything that's going to get
me grimy as we remove the engine
i'm excited i'm excited to get this back
on the road again
the bus is clean the underside is clean
and we are ready to remove the engine
[Music]
first of all i'm going to take the
bumper and this
toe plate off
[Music]
we're ready to take the final bolts out
and then the engine should just slip out
[Music]
you did it yeah so tank
and then this this we basically need to
clear this whole center section i'm
gonna angle grind
these little weld spots now
[Music]
joey who's just told me the next thing i
could do tonight is
unscrew this and try and take the gas
tank out
i have a saw i'm going to disconnect the
fuel line of this
we've done a lot today i've taken the
engine out and
the gas tank and i've started clearing
this area underneath
and then the plan tomorrow is we'll
fully
clear out the bottom space and measure
out and order the
aluminium that we need to like build the
box that's going to
house the tesla batteries and then we're
going to figure out how to bolt that on
i'm really excited that this is finally
underway
day one complete this is fun because
this is stuff i
don't really know how to do i'm just
kind of figuring it out as i go along
but i think that's how you learn things
in life is just
dive in the deep end i'm ready for day
two
today i have a lot of work to do i'm
going to be
sawing all of these metal beams
under the van i want to clear out this
entire middle section
ready to build in our battery box i've
just gone and got some new blades for
the
angle grinder and for this electric saw
these are the tools i'm going to be
using
yesterday was my first day using an
angle grinder
see how it goes hopefully make some
progress
i've made my first blunder check this
out
i just sawed through one of the brake
lines
and it's now dripping brake fluid
[Music]
making progress i'm gonna take off these
additional gas tanks which have been
fitted for
my cooker and fridge and stuff
we finally managed to get this
gas tank out that was a mission absolute
[Music]
mission
[Music]
i've almost finished clearing the middle
we've had another little
problem a little mistake i've made which
was so i've cut through
the brake line again i was trying to cut
these pipes up here and accidentally
slipped and
nicked the brake fluid again so i'm
filling up this cut with brake fluid
thankfully i think we need to replace
all these lines anyway so yeah it's not
a major problem but
this is all part of uh amateur mechanics
i think we are almost ready
to measure up for where the battery
boxes need to go i've cleared as much as
i possibly can
here's where the engine's been removed
the fuel tank this center
section is where i've taken all the
piping and cables and
everything that used to be there
prepared all of these
and this is the last little bit i did i
had to cut this back i think we're ready
to measure up
we're gonna build the boxes out of
cardboard put them in place just uh
double check and then we're going to
take those measurements
order in the aluminium sheeting and then
we're going to build the boxes
if you didn't see these are the
batteries the tesla batteries that are
going inside
and there's 14. let's do 28 so that we
have room to run a cable from here to
here
so six and a half inches
by 12 inches
i'll see how much cardboard we have but
i can at least build
one of these and a few of these okay i'm
going out to the dumpsters to find some
cardboard so we can
uh mock up these battery boxes managed
to grab all of this
which i'm hoping will be enough so i'm
going to try and build all the boxes
tonight and then
i can put them all in position tomorrow
and we can just check if it all
works out as planned it's going to take
a while
[Music]
that took a lot longer than i thought i
learned a lot about making cardboard
boxes
it's not fully accurate i don't know how
important that is but i think it will do
i'm going to try and put it in place now
and see how this looks underneath of
that
[Music]
instead of um measuring it all out and
folding
what i've done is i've cut the two main
like the top and bottom of the box and
then the sides
my theory is if i celebrate them all
together
i can fold them up and then like tape it
all together it probably won't be as
strong but i think it will be more
accurate
[Music]
oh way better way way better just got uh
six more of those to make i've literally
spent four hours
cutting cardboard all i have to show for
it is this
these are like all measured out ready to
be stuck together
[Music]
it is 5 a.m i finally finished the
replicas
of all of the battery boxes and we're
going to be lining them all up
underneath here
figure out exactly where they're going
to go and if they're all gonna fit
i've never spent so long making carver
boxes in my entire life that was a long
night
end of day two of prepping the bus ready
for the electric conversion
[Music]
i have taped all of the cardboard
replica battery boxes
into place just to see if it's going to
work so let's say here's
negative positive doesn't matter if it
goes through the module then it can go
through this guy it goes like this
we've got our measurements for the boxes
get four like that
[Music]
maybe one that way or should we do some
of the
sides or something so we're ordering a
48 by 48 inch aluminium sheet
and then we'll test that out and see if
that works
[Music]
there's still quite a bit cleaning and
fitting to do so
my task before the sun sets is to clean
all of this grease off because we're
going to start
working in here a lot
[Music]
i have my engine cleaner my grease
cleaner
and a scrubbing brush and then the jet
wash and i'm trying to do this before it
gets dark i've actually never done this
before but it says i need to leave it on
for 15 minutes
before washing it off so i better get
going we are losing light
i'm gonna start this side
[Music]
i pushed my van back into the workshop
i've lifted it back up on the
lift and um i'm having a proper look at
it now and it's not
perfect but this was all thick with
grease
this was all stick with grease so you
know it's it's clean enough
the next job is i need to
re-run the brake cables they were coming
across here
out of this little pipe see this and
then across the middle section but we've
had to clean all this out to put the
aluminium boxes in
so this needs to come out so i'm going
to angle grind this out now and then i
need to drill holes
and i've bought three more of these um
rods to run one for the clutch cable and
one for each brake either side so i need
to drill here then i need to drill here
then it needs to go through here and
then bend down
from here through this beam through this
beam
and then this it's going to replace
where this pipe is and that's
going to feed the brake cable through
and then the same on the other side
so new brake cables are in here when we
can drop the car
we'll take the wheels off and re-fit the
brakes
before we start building the boxes out
of these
aluminium sheets which arrived in
aluminium
aluminum same thing
[Music]
so joe who just had a good idea that for
the two boxes here
why don't we just instead of build two
separate boxes build
a box that big so we were originally
gonna have four this size
instead just have two like double the
[Music]
width
i love it j who is a night owl like me
it's 3am and he's only going home now it
is 4
30 in the morning i finished my goal
for tonight which was to drill and
thread these tubes which are done now
so this is going to be the clutch cable
this is going to be the left
brake this is going to be the right
brake
so yeah these brakes are going to thread
through these holes weird the first one
went a lot better the second one i yeah
i ended up having to drill much bigger
holes and jiggle it around and stuff but
i got it in i love learning new stuff
[Music]
i've just run the clutch cable through
my new
tube i put in last night and i'm just
tightening the clutch cable here
i have been fiddling with little bits
and just
correcting things and figuring a few
issues out
just you know just small tweaks that
need to happen before we put the boxes
in
i am now finally drawing out the
measurements onto these aluminium sheets
we have i actually
increased the size from 6.5 inches
by the way i'm having to do everything
in inches which is crazy to me i feel
like the metric system
for small measurements and stuff works
way better but
all the tape measures and inches
everything we order it is in inches so
anyway i figured out with these five
sheets all the exact measurements we
need which gives us
two quadruple boxes two double boxes
and two single boxes so that's one two
three four
five six seven eight nine ten eleven
twelve thirteen fourteen batteries in
total
[Music]
we had a few problems with the
cable what was that other what's this
one like an upside down jigsaw
yeah so the blade was wobbly so we're
gonna try this
but i guess the problem still is the
long the long length there's a lot of
long lengths j
who has had a genius idea so we've been
scratching our heads trying to figure
out okay how do we
efficiently saw this aluminium into the
sizes for the box he's got this saw and
suggested that
we can cut a groove in a board of wood
and screw this underneath
and basically use it as a table top saw
so we can
guide the aluminium sheets over it so
that's the plan
[Music]
[Music]
didn't go grape firstly i
i stupidly didn't put this on and i got
aluminium
flakes in my eyes and then secondly as i
pushed away the first piece as you saw
the
the side got caught that sucks
red hot aluminium flakes
hurt
i have the pieces for the first
box we've got the bottom side
and then the top this is going to go
smooth smooth
i'm absolutely loving this i know we've
pretty much just got started we've just
been preparing the van and getting all
this gear in and stuff but um
i love jehu for many reasons firstly
i didn't know he was a night owl like
he's been staying up with me till like
3am
just because he does and secondly i
love how his mind works like he loves
hacking things and just
coming up with the most inventive ways
to solve problems
i need to learn more from his kind of
ways of hacking because i relate to that
i feel like that's something we share
in common but he's he's uh so much more
knowledgeable
if you haven't already go check out jay
who's youtube channel
he does like tons of battery hacking
he's like the expert
at like pulling things apart and
building like power walls and
gets loads of great deals on like
recycled battery packs and
just yeah like i said he hacks a bunch
of stuff and
he's uh yeah if you're if you're into
that kind of thing
go check him out go and subscribe and uh
yeah he's been
very generous let me use his workshop
and
coach me and teach me his ways and how
to
convert a van to fully electric
oh i can't wait i cannot wait to be
cruising around
in a fully electric camper van this is
going to be amazing
right i have cut to length the frame
that we're going to be building the box
around and now
i'm just uh doing the kind of
45 degree corners so they all fit
together
and then i'm going to be drilling
holes in aluminium sheeting and then
we'll tap in all the screws
and momentarily we should have a box
built
i'm just preparing the last two little
bits also these
are rails that are going to be halfway
up
the inside of the box for the batteries
to rest on
[Music]
i've cut all of the l bracket
ends that we're gonna like build the
frame of the box with but what we just
figured out is it's going to be
difficult to kind of
keep the frame in place whilst we drill
into it so that's what we're going to
try and do now
this is a new thing for you as well yeah
i never tried it so you just
don't want to heat the aluminium up too
much because they'll melt the actual not
the element of all melt
the problem is with aluminum is that it
it's really hard to get it hot because
it's such a good
conductor so all that heat is just
dissipating
[Music]
right we've given up on the brazing idea
didn't work
but this is the new plan i think this is
much better
holding it on with clamps whilst we
drill in
the corner screws which then holds the
frame to the plate
i did not get as far as i'd hoped
on this session at the workshop i've
managed to build a box
without the top or bottom
i wanted to get these rails in so i
could put the batteries in place but
we don't have the right screws and i
just broke a screw and everything so
this is kind of it's almost there
next session i'll be back put the rails
in we'll test the batteries out and then
i'll find the most efficient way
to make more boxes because this was kind
of fiddly and i was figuring things out
but now i have i'm going to
try and get a efficient production line
to make the other boxes but
yeah it's been it's been mildly
frustrating but
productive ish guys we have a problem
just been testing the batteries and this
battery
is completely dead some coolant leaked
inside and corroded it and
could be a gunner
