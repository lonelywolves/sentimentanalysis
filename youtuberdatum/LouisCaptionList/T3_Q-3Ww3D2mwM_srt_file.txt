flying around the world
it's been a dream of mine since i was a
kid
the challenge is immense these little
planes weren't built for this
more people have been to space than have
flown a single-engine airplane around
the world
i made a video of myself every day for
five
years i felt i was getting trapped in my
own little bubble
and i lost the focus of sharing the
stories of the people
and cultures i was visiting this wasn't
just about seeing the world
it was about seeing if i could actually
do something of significance
it's the day before we leave do you feel
like prepared
i don't feel prepared at all i just fly
the airplane
that's all you've ever done 60 knots
80 knots okay she's clean and we're
flying
there are lots of people that think a
trip like this is crazy to undertake i'm
not feeling happy about this at all i
know airline pilots who've done this in
little planes they were about ready to
call it quits
the fuel pump's broken is it usable with
movement at all
no in some of these countries they'll
actually shoot you down i think there's
a fighter jet behind us can you just
have a look for me
please look you do these things no
matter the cost
and you do it because that's who you are
we had this unique opportunity that we
were going to meet people literally
all over the world
this had us asking a big question
is the world as divided as it seems
first or could we find stories
places and people that reminded us that
when you get up close
we're more alike than we are different i
think we all have the need to be loved
this is like the basic human thing i
think it's about
wanting to understand each other and
respect each other's way of living
this is so beautiful i'm with you all
the way
hey i know that i want that was a little
more excitement than i was hoping for
oh no oh you got some it doesn't taste
too bad actually
you guys are going around the world
aren't you that's affirmative
you thought of really wanting to go off
on an adventure
and the ultimate thing to do of course
is fly around the world
what happened the fuel time's broken
at this rate we're going to run out of
fuel
30 miles from our destination we're
beyond our point of no return
nearest island is three hours of flying
away got a whole lot more exciting
