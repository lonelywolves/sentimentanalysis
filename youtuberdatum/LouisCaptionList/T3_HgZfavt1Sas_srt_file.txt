[Music]
the last six and a half years with you
have been an incredible journey we've
traveled the world together
sharing unforgettable experiences from
our first real date in shanghai
to dancing salsa in cuba the safaris in
africa
road tripping through new zealand and so
much more
i've loved sharing our lives with so
many great friends
and finding our seoul community in la
it's amazing how much we've grown
together and have supported each other
to pursue our wildest dreams
through it all you've become my best
friend and i fall more and more in love
with you every day
we have had endless adventures trekking
across the globe
and finally i'm ready to invite you
on a new adventure
okay close your eyes okay
okay open your eyes will you marry me
