@NebbyWebby it comes from athletes winning gold from Olympics or any international sport events. People gather up at the &quot;market place&quot; (I don&#39;t live in Helsinki I don&#39;t remember the name of the place) and have a victory celebration there with the athletes. They show it live on tv at least if it&#39;s ice hockey world championship gold. There&#39;s popular music artist and hosts and stuff... ü•á,Ragdoll,2021-04-28T01:39:51Z,4

"To everybody saying why Finns haven&#39;t pointed this out to him already: because to our ears, they don&#39;t really sound the same. The stress is on a different syllable, and there&#39;s a diphthong in the last vowel in &#39;viisaus&#39;, whereas in Vsauce, there&#39;s just a long vowel (and a different vowel from either of those making up the diphthong). If Vsauce was written according to Finnish orthography, it&#39;d be something like &#39;vii soos&#39; (two words since one way for Finns to separate one word from the previous one is to listen to where the main stress falls; it&#39;s always on the first syllable of the word, except in words that have no stress at all).",Janne Peltonen,2021-04-08T14:01:49Z,0
"True about the dipthong, but Vsauce does actually have its stress on the first syllable, it&#39;s VEEsauce not viSAUCE. You seem to have gotten that mistaken idea that it&#39;s on the second one from a previous incorrect comment you replied to.",Spinnis,2021-04-09T01:25:11Z,1

"Fun fact: <i>viisaus</i> comes from the word viisas, meaning &quot;wise&quot; + <i>-us</i> (quality suffix, i.e. English -dom, -ness, or -ity). This comes from Proto-Finnic *viisas, with the same meaning, in turn borrowed from Proto-Germanic *wƒ´saz, &quot;wise&quot;, probably around 500 CE. This is also the origin of the English word &quot;wise&quot;, making English <i>wise</i> and Finnish <i>viisas</i> cognates, words that have a common origin.",MC King,2021-04-08T12:42:41Z,0

"I&#39;ve been to Finland before, but just in the airport changing flights. I am a typical white European guy. There was a woman checking tickets, and saying &quot;huomenta&quot; to everyone who approached her. And I noticed she said &quot;good morning&quot; to a chinese looking guy. I was thinking well I&#39;m a white guy so she&#39;s gonna say huomenta when she gets to me. Anyway when she got to me she said &quot;good morning&quot; and I was like whaaat how do you know I&#39;m not finnish and she just laughed and moved onto the next person! I still don&#39;t know to this day what kind of superpower she has",Nena Vaskina,2021-04-08T11:23:17Z,4
"There are PLENTY of genetic markers and physical-aesthetic features like face shape, clothing choice, etc. that really, subconsciously, help people differentiate between peoples. Take the &quot;standard&quot; white European: side by side, with enough background analysis, someone who&#39;s genetic background is primarily from Germany will have different facial features from someone born in Sweden - even if they have identical hair/eye color.",Will Murphy,2021-04-10T04:43:56Z,1
I don&#39;t think this is a super power at all. Sometimes you can tell who&#39;s a foreigner by their behavior and in some cases by their clothing choice. And since this was at an airport the women had many interactions with Finns as well as foreigners so it&#39;s probably pretty easy for her to tell.,Exter,2021-04-09T22:07:04Z,3

"Thought it sounded weirdly close to the Indo-European root, considering it&#39;s not an Indo-European language. Looked it up, and apparently, the Finnic root is a borrowing from Proto-Germanic *wƒ´saz (&quot;wise&quot;). So the word &quot;viisaus&quot; has basically the same origin as the English word &quot;wisdom&quot;, and same goes for &quot;viisas&quot; and &quot;wise&quot;. <br /><br />But also, it has the same origin as all the other words in Indo-European languages which come from the Indo-European root (which was related to both knowing and seeing) from which this Germanic root comes. <br /><br />This includes &quot;wit&quot;, of course, but also the Latin root related to seeing, so : in English, the words &quot;visible&quot;, &quot;vision&quot;, &quot;video&quot;, and many other words, the Romance words for &quot;to see&quot; : Italian &quot;vedere&quot;, Spanish and Portuguese &quot;ver&quot;, French &quot;voir&quot; (past participle -&gt; vu, from which the noun &quot;vue&quot;, from which English &quot;view&quot;), Romanian &quot;vedea&quot;, etc.<br /><br />It also includes Ancient Greek ·º∞Œ¥Œ≠·æ±, which &quot;idea&quot; comes from (the v/w element was dropped in this one), but also, interestingly enough, ·øêÃîœÉœÑŒøœÅ·øêÃÅ·æ± (histor√≠ƒÅ, &quot;history&quot;), though it&#39;s harder to see (hehe get it?). <br /><br />There&#39;s also Sanskrit ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶ (v√©da, &quot;knowledge&quot;, from which we derived &quot;Vedic&quot;), along with other Sanskrit words from the same root. <br /><br />We get the Slavic root related to seeing as well, for example in the word for &quot;to see&quot; : Russian –≤–∏ÃÅ–¥–µ—Ç—å (v√≠det&#39;), Bulgarian –≤–∏ÃÅ–¥—è (v√≠dja), Polish &quot;widzieƒá&quot;, and so on.<br /><br />That&#39;s just a sneak peak, there are many, many words I didn&#39;t mention, including in some Indo-European languages I didn&#39;t mention, like Albanian or Armenian, or any of the Celtic, Baltic, or Iranian languages... But I hope it piqued the interest of someone. I love sharing my passion for historical linguistics.",Mercure250,2021-04-08T09:06:39Z,0

"As an American person, I still believe that Europe is a country",Mamado Ortega,2021-04-07T10:32:43Z,0
"Although it is an interesting coincidence, there&#39;s still much that differentiates the two. Vsauce is something along the lines of /viÀêÀàs…îÀês/ or /viÀêÀàs…îs/ while viisaus is [Àà ãiÀês…ëuÃØs]. They have different word stress, initial consonants and the last syllable has a diphthong in the Finnish word while the English one simply has a long/short vowel sound. This certainly displays the differences between the two languages.",michCOdel,2021-04-07T10:31:36Z,2
"Your phonemic transcription of Vsauce is dubious. It&#39;s /Ààvis…ës/ or /Ààvis…îs/ (doesn&#39;t matter which because Michael&#39;s accent is fully cot-caught merged), not /viÀêÀàs…îÀês/. First, vowel length isn&#39;t written in broad transcription for General American English because it isn&#39;t phonemically distinctive, and neither is it for Michaels specific accent. Second, the stress is pretty clearly on the first syllable. It&#39;s VEEsauce not viSAUCE. Also, you should probably compare them both in the same type of transcription, not like it is now with one in broad and the other in narrow.",Spinnis,2021-04-09T01:13:54Z,1
"Yes, that&#39;s what I thought. But if you&#39;re  an English-speaking person not used to hearing diphthongs in such syllables, I kind of understand how they sound really similar.",Janne Peltonen,2021-04-08T13:57:46Z,1

"We are all sinners and we cannot save ourselves! If a person gets to heaven because they kept the commandments or stopped sinning, then that would mean that they were saved by their works. But we are not saved by our works! We are saved by grace through faith! Salvation is a completely free gift! Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, was buried in a tomb and rose again on the third day. If a person continues to be disobedient, they are still saved because Jesus Christ paid the price for their sins. All of their sins! Past, present and future. Once a person believes the gospel, they are sealed until the day of redemption and they cannot lose their salvation. No matter what!",Miguel D,2021-04-06T23:33:03Z,1

"10 of the World&#39;s Funniest One Liners<br /><br />1. Work is for people who don&#39;t know how to fish.<br />2. If you don&#39;t like the news, go out and make some.<br />3. Give me ambiguity or give me something else.<br />4. We have enough youth. How about a fountain of &quot;Smart&quot;?<br />5. He who laughs last thinks slowest.<br />6. As long as there are tests, there will be prayer in public schools.<br />7. Laugh alone and the world thinks you&#39;re an idiot.<br />8. National Atheist&#39;s Day April 1st.<br />9. All generalizations are false.<br />10. Nothing is fool proof to a sufficiently talented fool.<br /><br /> Editorial:   Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is &quot;Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway.&quot; It&#39;s sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, &quot;Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart.&quot; Ever looked with lust? If you have said &quot;Yes&quot; to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we&#39;ve only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That&#39;s not God&#39;s will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: &quot;God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.",egymario,2021-04-06T19:10:54Z,0

"If Wiktionary is correct, the words &quot;wise&quot; and &quot;viisas&quot; are cognate (the word viisaus comes from &quot;viisas&quot; meaning wise, with the suffix -us making it an adjective). They both come from the Proto-Germanic &quot;wƒ´saz&quot;. English got it with the Anglo-Saxons in Old English, and separately maybe Proto-Finnic borrowed it at some point because it&#39;s found in all the Baltic-Finnic languages, like Estonian or Ingrian too.",Olli Wilkman,2021-04-06T08:54:59Z,0

"Looking at the etymology of &quot;wisdom&quot; and &quot;viisaus&quot;, they both come from the theorized word &quot;wisaz&quot; (wise) in Proto-Germanic (where English and other Germanic languages came from). Cool.",ACDC923,2021-04-06T04:42:27Z,27
"@Kastravec Shushtavec Early Finnish language borrowed a lot of old words from early germanic languages. For instance, the word &#39;kuningas&#39; (=king) comes from the old germanic word &#39;kuningaz&#39; . Same for the word &#39;koulu&#39; (=school).",Ilkku239 Artukainen,2021-04-06T11:30:58Z,3

"Here&#39;s a story a turkish friend once told me that I&#39;ll never get tired of retelling:<br />There&#39;s a well-known manufacturer of sanitary systems, like toilets, called Geberit. I don&#39;t know how it is in other countries, but if you visit a public toilet here in Germany, you&#39;ll probably find the name &quot;Geberit&quot; written there somewhere. (If you&#39;re the kind of person to look for the manufacturer&#39;s name when visiting a public toilet, that is. Weird flex, but okay.)

"i had such a coincidence too, twice. but first of all sorry for my bad english, i&#39;m german. :D<br /><br />first: my friends and i once planned a minecraft project and i tried to figure out a fitting name. so i choose &quot;Litusfera&quot; randomly, but just because it sounded cool and i had no idea what it meant. a few years later i discovered that the lithosphere is actually a stone crust of the earth. and &quot;lithos&quot; means &quot;stone&quot; and &quot;ferum&quot; means iron. which - for those of you who don&#39;t know minecraft - are two of the main materials in the game.<br /><br />second: i once had a girlfriend with the name Vanessa. and i love to give nicknames so i decided to call her &quot;vay&quot;. just because i thought it was a cute short form of her name. later i discovered that &quot;vay&quot; means something like &quot;wow&quot; in turkish.<br /><br />i think these coincidenses are so funny. anyone else has similar experience?",N3KLAZ,2021-04-05T21:32:44Z,0

"LOL. That is funny. Slightly influenced by the text-to-speech engine, the correct emphasis isn&#39;t quite that vsaucey, and there is a clearer distinction between the a and u , with the last &quot;-us&quot; syllable being clearly a distinct syllable.

"You&#39;re a math guy, I like math. Yes this is unlikely, but is it. Think about how many words you could use to help describe this channel. Wisdom, Science, intelligence, enlightenment, how ever you want to stretch it agree or disagree with ones I said. Now each one of those could be a translated word sounding like Vsauce. Now imagine all the languages, every single language is an Opertunity for 1 of their words to sound like Vsauce, all the word needs to do now is be a description of the channel. But that&#39;s just it, this is 1 channel. There are thousands of channels and this is the only one I&#39;ve seen have this. ANY channel can make this video on the coincidence of their name choice, but only 1 needs to be right. <br /><br />To me this is not as improbable as you might think at first.
