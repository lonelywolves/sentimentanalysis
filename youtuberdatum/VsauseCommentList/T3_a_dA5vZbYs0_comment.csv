"And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: (Acts 17:30)<br />The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:9)<br />And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: (Hebrews 9:27)",Paul Tomorrow,2021-05-06T20:28:03Z,0

Eschew obfuscation.<br />4. They told me I was gullible...and I believed them.<br />5. It&#39;s bad luck to be superstitious<br />6. Don&#39;t steal. The government hates competition.<br />7. I can handle pain until it hurts.<br />8. No matter where you go, you&#39;re there.<br />9. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it.<br />10. I went to the fights, and a hockey game broke out.<br /><br /><br />    Editorial:Probably the most thought-provoking one-liner is &quot;Eat <br />right. Stay fit. Die anyway.&quot; It&#39;s sad but true -- no matter what you <br />do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let&#39;s see<br /> if that&#39;s true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)?<br /> Jesus said, &quot;Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has <br />committed adultery already with her in his heart.&quot; Ever looked with <br />lust? If you have said &quot;Yes&quot; to these three questions, by your own <br />admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we&#39;ve only<br /> looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment <br />Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, <br />and end up in Hell. That&#39;s not God&#39;s will. He provided a way for you to <br />be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: &quot;God commended His<br /> love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for <br />us.&quot; Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises <br />everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and <br />trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have <br />tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible <br />daily and obey what you read.

"@Jery Cannabis It’s funny how you put so much effort into promoting Pluto to the level of major planet, but don’t realize that its partner, Charon, also deserves whatever Pluto does. Pluto and Charon are a binary system, and the barycenter lies outside Pluto, thus making Charon a dwarf planet too. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23charonisnotamoon"">#CharonIsNotAMoon</a>.",Paradox Science,2021-05-07T20:03:28Z,0

"@chiffmonkey Because if I were to ask you how many planets are in our solar system, would you say 9, the 8 regular planets and pluto? Or would you say 11 and include Chiron and Eris? Or 12 with Sedna? 13 with Ceres? 14 with Haumea? The definition was changed as our understanding of our solar system changed. Also the other planets all stick to the orbital plane more or less, whereas the dwarf planets either outside of that plane or don&#39;t dominate their local region of space.",Nick Jarvis,2021-05-06T17:01:45Z,0
