I&#39;m also planning for a trip with my 4 month baby. Is it safe to travel with such a small baby? What precautions I have to take and does there any ear pressure for the baby in the flight?<br />Please help me,saumya keshari,2020-01-04T15:03:37Z,1
@Kaitlyn suggestion doesn&#39;t mean that you have to use it. You use it at your own risk and only you are responsible for that,Sophie Alcott,2019-06-21T21:27:33Z,0
So you’re going to suggest a dangerous item and when someone uses it and their child is harmed or killed they can put a lawsuit on you. THE CARSEAT COVER WASNT MADE FOR SEATS ITS DANGEROUS AND CAN EJECT YOUR CHILD FROM THE SEAT.,Kaitlyn,2019-06-19T16:04:52Z,0

Why the 🐕 pads instead of the baby pads.<br /><br />Why did you not bring a cool in order to put the milk in with ice packs.<br /><br />Does the case for the car seat and stroller comes with it when buying it or is it from the airport.,Nic Nico,2019-03-04T19:45:13Z,1

It&#39;s a good thing you were able to experience traveling with your baby without taking in all of the different expert comments you received. LOL Your baby was fine and slept through the flight . I watched the entire video which is usual for me. You kept my attention. I love that dad shared a bit of baby involvement .

"Before traveling by plane with a baby, bare in mind that he/she have to be maximum as long as the bassinet and not more than 10 kg, approx 22. 5 lbs. The airline staff may deny you the bassinet due to obvious safety reasons. If you know the baby is bigger, I suggest you buy or bid for an extra seat to make the baby and you more comfortable during a long flight. Otherwise babies are just adorable and love to have them on my flights 😍",Oana Oana,2020-01-03T07:58:22Z,0

Yes she flies for free or less than another ticket but if there is an emergency you have to put your baby on the floor. You&#39;ll have no where to strap her in. This is why you need to get your baby a seat and strap her carseat on her seat and in any emergency you strap your baby in and she will be safe.,M. A.,2019-12-28T00:56:29Z,1

Ppl check their strollers because sometimes they make you fold them and put them through the X-ray scanner. With multiple kids that makes it a bit more difficult than having baby strapped to you. I like the pp pad trick though 💯,Gabriela,2019-11-24T15:00:39Z,0

Great video work! Never got boring. You Kristen said you would breastfeed her at takeoff and landing to help her pop her ears and then I understood you didn&#39;t because she slept... but can a baby have problems if you don&#39;t breastfeed them during takeoff/landing?

That baby is such a good flyer! Mine definitely would not be like that. On top of not liking to sleep in a bassinet she prefers  sleeping in our arms 🙄  we have a 4 1/2 month old and I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be a bit difficult. I would more likely book a red eye so she can sleep throughout the flight. Great Video!,The Tapang Vlogs,2019-08-13T12:11:09Z,0

"Love this. My parents did the same thing with me at 12 weeks - a 10 hour flight to Hawaii. My parents have always travelled and just added me and my siblings on the adventure as we came along.<br /><br />All tell you now, in my 20’s, I have always seen flights as an adventure (or slightly annoyed). But just bringing me along from the start made travel feel like a fact of life rather than a scary unknown",Gabrielle Gonzales,2019-06-18T11:20:08Z,7

"I&#39;m so happy I found this video. Thank you so much for making it. I know how difficult it is to make videos and then the editing afterwards. But this will really help me try to convince my husband to travel while the baby is still 3-4 months old, because unlike me, he thinks that the baby is too fragile and it must not even leave the house during that age. I&#39;ve heard from other parents too that traveling is easier with a new born but I guess some parents (my husband) are the scaredy kind. Hope you guys had a lovely trip. Wonder how it was wandering around with a new born in a new city because they want to feed so frequently and need to be changed.

some babies are more chill than others just like some service dogs are more chill than others. from the first time I flew with my service dog I thought she would not take it well but she slept most of the time. I have never had problems with my children either.  The airlines might be tweeking the cabin pressure to decrease the severity of the ear popping though I get it each flight. so glad she was a good baby.,jane of many trades,2019-02-24T04:47:36Z,0

"Heyyy. You forgot to mention that the baby pushchair has to be empty of all items before going through the metal detector, I would advise to go through the pushchair before heading to the airport. And some airlines won’t be very helpful, like usually when you get to your destination you would find the pushchair outside the aircraft but with some airlines they won’t do that but the most annoying is when they ask to put the pushchair near the gate which is usually down some stairs imagine carrying a baby, bag and pushchair doing that.

Hi from Montreal!  Thank you so much for posting that detailed video.  We’re planning a Japan trip with our 3m old and this helps ease some of my nerves about it.<br />Would love to have a video about what you packed for your daughter that you should have left at home vs what you needed.,idelhigh,2019-02-22T14:29:20Z,0
You probably know this but just want to share for safety. Most car seat companies won’t uphold a warranty if they know you checked your seat. The amount of throwing and dropping they do can be the equivalent of a minor car wreck. You may want to travel with a cheaper seat so you don’t mess up your nice one. Great job momma. My theory is the more you are prepared the less things happen that you prepared for 😉,Callison Roberts,2019-02-22T13:20:32Z,0

"Your baby is beautiful and you both are amazing parents! <br /><br />(Comment, readers, don&#39;t reply in a negative way) <br />I&#39;ve travelled on a plane once with a baby behind me... It was a 14 hour ride from Toronto to Tokyo. Never.. again.. will I fly without knowing. They didn&#39;t do anything to prevent their baby from crying, and it was a very upsetting, migraine-filled 14 hours. Not only was the baby uncontrollably crying, but the parents were super loud... The airline informed me (and other passengers around me) that there are ways to ask if there is a baby in your general area.. if I knew, I&#39;d switch. I understand baby&#39;s are baby&#39;s but for a 1600$ plane ticket, 14 hours... Just no",Cassia Fayexoxo,2019-02-21T22:10:41Z,49

"I understand your feelings. Once, I flew to Europe on a business class with my husband and then 14 months daughter, there was a toddler who was crying for 6 hours,  I saw that his mother was exhausted caring for his infant brother, and all her efforts to calm the toddler failed. His father was sleeping the entire time. <br />I was exhausted listening to his non-stop cry. I was able to share with him some of my daughter&#39;s toys, and coloring books and eventually he was interested in coloring and he stopped crying. <br />After 1 hour, the flight crew had to ask if there was a doctor on our flight, the boy&#39;s father woke up to attend to the medical emergency. When he returned back to his seat, he thanked me for helping with his son and told me that he had to perform an emergency surgery that lasted more than 12 hours.  <br />From that moment I realized that we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with our fellow travelers with children. If I can help I will.",Fatmah F,2019-03-02T04:44:50Z,32

She slept in it no problem. The only thing is we had to take her out anytime the seatbelt sigh turned on so she woke up for like a minute during those times. She sleeps with a sleep sac typically but ur arms are always out. She likes it that way. She sleeps between 8-12 hours a night. She gets up for one feed typically after 7 hours of sleep then goes right back to bed. Shes been doing this since month 2.,Kristen & Siya,2019-02-19T22:39:18Z,1

OMG what a little champion!   Yeah traveling is def in her blood. Were her ears okay? Does she need her own passport? Who&#39;s watching atlas? Do you think you&#39;ll ever travel with Kai and atlas at the same time?,Lhouse810,2019-02-11T19:28:57Z,0

Was so looking forward to seeing Kai’s first flight!! So happy it went smoothly for you guys 😊 Enjoy London!,Brianna,2019-02-11T16:20:15Z,2
I flew with my then 8 month old on a 13 hr flight from Seattle Wa to Korea. We were in the same type of seat with the bassinet attached to the wall. It was one of the most comfortable flights I have ever taken with my children. Being a military family we flew quite often and I also used to fly not only with my kids but my Pomeranian in a carrier as well. The more you do the easier it gets!,MakeupMenaree,2019-02-11T16:11:20Z,7
@Kaitlyn my child is now 22 yrs old and car seats werent required on flights with children under 2 who were lap riders. I think its still the same. Im sure you have never traveled with kids. Especially 20 plus years ago. Mine never used car seats in flights. He slept in the same exact bassinet as shown in this video with a strap. Thank you very much.,MakeupMenaree,2019-03-19T20:08:19Z,0

If u travel buy a seat for the baby and keep them in the car seat. It’s the safest place and car seats that get checked get thrown on the plane and could be broken.,nicole ann,2019-02-21T15:29:03Z,0

Depends what airline and aircraft you fly with. My airline doesn&#39;t have a fridge or microwave on board.,Oxana Gielzynska,2019-02-17T20:49:08Z,1

The airline put my milk in the fridge. Then they also warmed it up when I needed it. They just put the bottle in a cup of hot water.,Kristen & Siya,2019-02-11T16:40:58Z,1
Oh my gosh! I&#39;m so excited to see more travel vlogs with baby! It was always(still is) my pet peeve when people would call be brave for traveling with my babies. it made me feel like i was suppose to stay at home and never leave. its not as hard as some people say. (yes you can get hard days) but for the most part when they are tiny it just milk and sleep and they are set haha,lovekylielyn,2019-02-11T15:23:22Z,12
"Yes girl! I&#39;m glad you&#39;re with us on this. When she said you&#39;re brave, I know she was being nice but I was so annoyed lol.",Kristen & Siya,2019-02-11T21:56:06Z,1
