Seems like a cult. I feel bad for their child. That&#39;s not a great way to grow up. I have a friend who grew up in a cult-like culture like this and it really messed her up. Why would they do this? Selfish.,Sarah Keech,2021-01-24T22:06:29Z,0

Since when does living in community automatically mean living in a cult? This is how humans used to live together. It&#39;s a beautiful way to live and grow up as a child. Its also a place where the elders are taken care of instead of thrown in an old age home. Now most people don&#39;t even know the names of their neighbors. They don&#39;t know where their food comes from. It takes a village to raise a child my friends and this is the most beautiful way to live.,Kristen & Siya,2021-01-24T23:04:14Z,1

"Gorgeous! Something like this appeals to me but I have to ask. Do you feel like you’re giving Kai a lesser education because she doesn’t have a traditional school? Or that she’ll have fewer opportunities for traditional jobs she may want to do (ie doctor, lawyer etc) because she lives in such a rural area? Not trolling at all, these are honest questions and thoughts I’ve had myself about moving to a community like this. Just curious your thoughts because they may calm my nerves and offer a view I hadn’t thought of. Congratulations on your new home!",Discovering The New Normal,2021-01-24T16:03:18Z,0
"@Discovering The New Normal I think it depends on the parents a lot to ensure homeschooled kids have the same education, if not more than the public school kids. My husband&#39;s college friend was homeschooled k-12. He still joined in church activities and worked part time at a grocery store. He was one of the 2 students in their class who graduated with a GPA 4.0 as a chemical engineer, and he was double majored in computer science. He is a quiet person but he communicates well when needed. He was part of the study group that my husband was in and they all got along very well. I used to think homeschooled kids are at a disadvantage like you but not anymore once I learned of his story.",wendy nguyen,2021-01-25T15:36:21Z,1
I think the future will be won by people who have that base scientific knowledge but who can find patterns and be free thinkers and not tied down by institutional dogma. You can be guided down that path anywhere with internet and decent teachers.,urklstad,2021-01-24T21:07:00Z,0
"@Alicia to be honest I think home schooled kids have the potential to be at a disadvantage. I think it depends on how much focus and importance their parents put on education and the caliber of homeschool chosen for their kids. With that being said the same could be said for public schools. People I’ve personally come across in life that were homeschooled were not prepared for the “real world” but again that could have been a lack of dedication of the student/parent, or the particular program they chose to follow. <br /><br />I like the idea of raising kids this way but I also want to make sure my kids don’t miss out on opportunities. I love the idea of them being exposed to different cultures and experiencing the world, as opposed to being stuck in a classroom. I’m just curious how they plan on educating Kai so that I can get a better idea of what’s out there and what’s possible. <br /><br />Also no offense taken by your reply. They were genuine questions because I’m curious to see what’s possible compared to traditional education and I’m open to new ideas. Have a great day as well!",Discovering The New Normal,2021-01-24T20:08:49Z,1
"Do homeschooled kids have less opportunities to receive post-secondary education? Is it compromised? No. I have a bunch of friends who were homeschooled and got to learn more (languages, arts, deep diving into areas of interest) who have Master&#39;s degrees and are going onto do their doctorate. What I&#39;ve seen is that these friends are less bothered by socially enforced timelines and don&#39;t see each thing they&#39;ve studied as separate. The connections make for more dynamic jobs and careers - and the ability to pivot with the changes in society. That said, if you look at different countries you&#39;ll note that Canada and the states makes a university education seem like the best option whereas the trades are often looked down on. In 15-20 years what sort of jobs will be the most important and what will be redundant? <br /><br />Consider this: what would an education, career, and life look like that lived in harmony and pushed for a healthier planet? What sort of things might one place of significant value having grown up in a place and with a family and community that is actively working together towards keeping this planet capable of sustaining life as we know it?<br /><br />Please note none of this was intended as a criticism of your query but as looking at the questions you have and looking at them from a different perspective. Hope you have a good and safe day.",Alicia,2021-01-24T18:44:43Z,0
