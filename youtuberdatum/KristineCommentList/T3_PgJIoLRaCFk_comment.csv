"Wow! That&#39;s some impressive rental income there. <br />Years ago we wanted to rent out our place while we were travelling, but no real estate agents in our area offered short term rental like this. So glad Airbnb came along. We have rented out our place a few times and it definitely helps to fund our trips.",Bucket List Travellers,2021-04-17T15:59:26Z,0

"@Kristen &amp; Siya I totally have. My husband and I want to get a piece of land in Jamaica (I am Czech, he is Jamaican) and hope people find this part of the world attractive enough to come rent it! Even, or rather especially, when we are in Europe to have passive income 🙏🏻",Renata Novotná,2021-03-22T23:49:09Z,0
I&#39;m so glad! Have you been thinking about being an Airbnb host?,Kristen & Siya,2021-03-22T20:19:58Z,1
"This is super interesting content and I&#39;m excited to see the other spaces featured in this series! At some point could you go over the extra logistics of being hosts, as in do you have a management company that cleans and upkeeps the place (or do your co-owners do that when you are away)? How much time does it actually take out of your day to be managers (booking and replying to guests)? I have a family place that we&#39;ve looked into listing before, but those extra logistics make it tricky (plus we want to use the place for ourselves lol).",Randomgenre,2021-03-16T01:42:09Z,1
"Great questions! I think doing a whole other video going into more detail would be a great idea or a blog post. Either way, stay tuned! Also the other hosts will answer these questions in upcoming episodes.",Kristen & Siya,2021-03-16T05:32:35Z,0

So I live with my aunt we live in England right next to Stansted airport and she does Airbnb and it&#39;s how she makes a living and she earns loads off it obviously due to Covid we haven&#39;t had any guests within the last year I mean Airbnb is all and good but not when you get guests turn up at midnight and leave at 5am the next day because they&#39;ve just booked your room for a flight lol it&#39;s not fun for me who gets kept awake all night and has to get up early for work lol but it is a good income for my aunt lol,Charlotte Wilson-Smith,2021-03-15T13:32:44Z,1
"You can change your requirements. So for example, you can have it a requirement to book a minimum of a certain amount of nights so people don&#39;t just stay for one night. Also, you can have it so you need a 2 or 3 days notice before someone books. You can also have it so u need to approve the people booking before they do. This could help make it easier for your aunt.",Kristen & Siya,2021-03-15T16:44:17Z,0

I used to do Airbnb hosting and people always trashed the place 🙄🙄🙄🙄,love_nyc_,2021-03-14T17:02:10Z,0
"Yikes. I&#39;m sorry that happened to you. You can choose to only accept people you approve and also include no parties or events as a requirement. Also, if someone trashes the place, you can report it to Airbnb and they won&#39;t be able to use the platform. Plus, Airbnb has insurance for things like this.",Kristen & Siya,2021-03-14T17:26:17Z,0
Why do you have a 30 night minimum stay?,Maureen Pluthero,2021-03-14T16:39:21Z,0
"It&#39;s the rule for where we live, but we are working on getting a permit that lets us have short term stays too. Since we are The Blue Mountains, it&#39;s a tourist hot spot and this is just one of their rules to protect their hotels I guess. But you can pay a yearly fee to do it but you have to apply and they have to approve, which is what we are working on.",Kristen & Siya,2021-03-14T17:30:09Z,2

You can hire property managers or have a friend or family handle it and work out a cut with them. Anywhere from 10-15% is fair I&#39;d say.,Kristen & Siya,2021-03-14T14:48:08Z,1

You can hire property managers. That&#39;s what we&#39;ve done. So that way we have someone to meet our guests when they arrive and they handle cleaning and other things the guests may need.,Kristen & Siya,2021-03-14T14:46:31Z,5
