"My Sister and I were there for three weeks in 1997, in Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore and two smaller towns up in the mountains, Multan and Bourbon. Your videos have brought back a lot of fond memories. You&#39;re right about everyone there being so polite; I remember during the last week we were there we had to turn down dinner invitations every day because we had previous dinner engagements that were arranged from the week prior. Also, how it&#39;s very common for men to hold hands over there. I&#39;ll never forget seeing two Pakistani traffic cops standing in the middle of a busy street, in uniform, holding hands. I loved the food, as well. Surprisingly, you will find some of the world&#39;s best Chinese food in Pakistan. This is a great idea, having influencers show another side of a country like Pakistan, as opposed to what the news media spoon feeds the public.

"“No tourists here”.<br /><br />Uh yeah. It’s going to take a while before tourists boosts again. You need more positivity in your videos man, and a stabilizer. <br /><br />Your post on IG about the trip to the Pakistan was A LOT more positive. Yet, your video lol even if you aren’t thrilled, and are kinda shocked about the lack of other foreigners.... you should have googled and watched videos. <br /><br />Mark Wiens did a great set videos, mainly around food but the overall approach in his delivery made Pakistan seem a bit more pleasant than it really is. Whereas your videos lol it’s like.. hey... it’s nice... beautiful landscape... blue lake. No one else here is the same as me... oh no.",xotillioverdose,2019-07-10T23:31:01Z,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSD3UBfob6I&amp;t=6m37s"">6:37</a> is a common sight throughout south Asia.  Men holding hands is a gestures of friendship and brotherhood.  It does not mean a homosexual relationship like in the west.  The reason why so many locals were looking at you is probably because they were mesmorised to see tourists.

"I hope you&#39;re having an amazing time in Pakistan. It&#39;s a beautiful country. Breathtaking sceneries, diverse landscape and culture, rich heritage, a history buff&#39;s dream come true and a foodie&#39;s absolute heaven. It&#39;s beautiful all over. Whether you trek in the North In Gilgit Baltistan or enjoy the beaches of Balochistan in the South. Whether you go enjoy historical sites like Taxila and Mohenjjo Darro (the oldest civilization in the world) or go to cultural centers i.e. Lahore. Whether you enjoy the magnificence of Faisal and Badshahi Mosques or the grandeur of Shahi Qilla or Lahore Fort. Whether you enjoy eating the Biryanis, niharis or chappal kababs or love our haleem, taftaans, Sohan halwa and Ras malai, it all encapsulates the warmth and generosity of the people of Pakistan. That&#39;s what binds all Pakistanis. Our love for each and every inch of this wondrous country and those living in it.
