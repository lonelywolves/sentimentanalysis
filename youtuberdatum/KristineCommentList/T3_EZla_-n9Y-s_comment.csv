"Yeah I&#39;ll go there. Love the series, really. I&#39;m so passionate about home design. It can heal our lives so much. I would like to be involved in a property that has a trampoline and foam pit inside, with different things to climb the walls and platforms to chill/dance on.",Jenna Bonnichsen,2021-03-28T18:05:21Z,2
