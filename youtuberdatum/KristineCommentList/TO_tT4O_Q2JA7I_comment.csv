"I will suggestu only one thing. You travel pakistan and explore worldwide. Why don&#39;t u explore islam?? Bc Allah has showing u his signs, did u ever realize that who is the creator of all? The mountains, oceans, rivers everything. If he stopped your water, then what will u do? He is very kind that&#39;s why warning u to understand n read, explore Quran untill  its too late and your death comes. This world is nothing just a piece of attravtion and fantasies. Real world is heteafter where Allah will judge who will go to hell n heaven forever. That&#39;s why Allah created death to test u all and whoever believe in only one God and put faith on Allah and accept that Prophet Muhammad salallahu alaihe wasallam, his messenger and know that he will be gone one day after this world. So explore Quran n understand it. Im advising u. Thanks",Yusra Yusuf,2019-07-18T09:01:04Z,0

"The cinematography and background music at start of the vlog while camera moving out of the window was amazing. That variety of meal was traditionally royal  with excellent arrangement. That soccer playing area seems out of this world, absolutely stunning and unrealistic, it look like moving through fantasy in the dreamland, this section of the video deserved to be selected for award. I&#39;m sure even you will have the same feeling after repeatedly watching from @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT4O_Q2JA7I&amp;t=4m22s"">4:22</a> to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tT4O_Q2JA7I&amp;t=6m02s"">6:02</a> specifically. It&#39;s not a simple vlog but a great documentary, one of your best works. At closing, that hassle and fear of missing the flight and finally getting on board was like a mission impossible movie scene. Thank you for your stay and visiting our beloved country, best wishes for your family especially that lovely baby and all your team members!!",Rock n Roll,2019-07-18T05:06:17Z,13

"I enjoyed your Pakistan vlogs, but I have a slightly different perspective on this country, having traveled there myself also on an Asia overland backpacking trip. I know you encourage people to visit there, and I agree I found Pakistan fascinating, the locals very hospitable and helpful, and of course extremely curious. However, please don&#39;t take this the wrong way - but you are a brown skinned male with a beard. Your experience is probably going to be quite different than a caucasian female traveling solo. I would not recommend female travelers to visit Pakistan alone. It can be extremely dangerous for solo female travelers, or solo travelers in general. I was with two other females and we traveled as a group, and we were harassed daily. We wore extremely modest clothing, much more covering than the female who was traveling in your group, and we still had issues. Not to say that every encounter we had was negative, quite the contrary, but there were instances that were quite uncomfortable. Especially the constant stares wherever we went, I found it unnerving. I would also strongly advise women travelers not to take public transportation, especially in more remote, rural areas.<br /><br /><br />Also, I am surprised you never once mentioned the general lack of participation of Pakistani women in public life. I have never visited a country before where I rarely saw females out and about on the streets. In the North, the very few women I saw wore Burkas and did not participate in public life. This is also reflected in your vlogs, where you rarely see women or girls. They are mostly confined to a life within the home, which I find sad. This was a bit different in the major cities though. When the girl in your group is street dancing with those Pakistani boys, her hair uncovered and her arms bare - please know this would be considered utterly scandalous behaviour in their society. It&#39;s perfectly normal for us, but it should be noted that there is absolutely no equality for women in this country.<br /><br /><br />Just to put things a bit more into perspective. I&#39;m glad you enjoyed your trip, but there is a reason why there isn&#39;t more tourism there. Not every place in Pakistan is extremely safe for every kind of traveler. I wish you had addressed some of these imbalances in the vlog.",Julia Graf,2019-07-17T19:20:32Z,1
"I&#39;m so sorry that happened to you. I can&#39;t imagine people even thinking of something like that, but there are creeps everywhere around the world. I do believe that it will improve massively as more people start visiting. If you ever plan on coming back you let me know. My family would love to host you and show you around.",Yousuf Sameed,2021-03-30T01:31:20Z,0
"Don&#39;t know what went wrong. The things you are talking about are just normal. Infact I have seen women with hijab getting humiliated and harassed in Europe n western countries. I have seen the biased justice system in western countries where your courts favour the white skin.  But that doesn&#39;t mean you have to raise every single point and start blaming the society and their culture. Sometimes you need to move on from the tiny bad events and talk about the positives of your life experience. Believe me traveling is really not for negative, narrow minded people, because you gonna go though lot&#39;s of bad events. I will not share any female solo traveler videos here until U need help. Otherwise you can search yourself. No offence. Peace.",Mr Shah Is On,2019-07-20T01:11:08Z,0

"@Julia Graf yes you&#39;re right. To be honest, everything foreign gets stared at, but women even more so. This is not unique to PK. Happens even more in India and some other countries. Yeah, I was kinda cringing when the white woman in his group was dancing I was like noo what if something happens to her but she was safe. <br />I would not recommend Pakistan for solo females either. It&#39;s doable, but not highly recommended. <br /><br />I hope you can at least somewhat understand the reasoning behind the perceived lack of females in the public sphere. First of all.. If you do go to any market area you&#39;ll see tons of females. But you won&#39;t see them as bus drivers, shop keepers, conductors, etc... A large part of the culture is influenced by Islam. Islam says it&#39;s preferable for women to stay in the home unless they have to go out. Why? Idk, that&#39;s a theological argument. I know part of the reason is to protect them from the prying eyes you mention. In fact, that&#39;s why women wear burkas and hijabs in public.. So that only their husbands see their beauty in the privacy of their home. But yes, we are very old fashioned in that women are owners of the home and men are the outside dwellers/bread earners. In terms of rights, they&#39;re generally equal (actually women are favored in many cases) but for responsibilities, man and woman are different. As you know though cities everywhere are more liberal and hustly/bustly so you see women outside a lot more. <br /><br />Personally I think Pakistan is good for couples. Locals might frown upon, or vagabonds might jump upon, a solo woman traveler, but generally everyone respects couples. I won&#39;t deny that it&#39;s a patriarchal society. But part of that has to do with culture influenced by Islam. Yes, many men do take advantage of this and beat their women. That needs to be improved with education and awareness. But as far as pure conservatism goes... Compared to the western world... That&#39;s just who we are<br /><br />I appreciate your honesty. I understand that Siya most likely noticed these things as well but doesn&#39;t want to say it to the thousands of viewers and get hate comments. But your observation has been noted and hopefully explained to some degree",Ali Khan,2019-07-17T20:37:06Z,2
"@Atif Bashir Having had a female PM (whose father also happened to be prime minister before her) is not a good indication of the equality of women in a country. Benazir Bhutto came from an extremely elite, wealthy and powerful family, her experience is not parallel to the lives of ordinary Pakistani women. Their lack of participation in public life, and lack of human rights, is a much better indicator. This is especially true in rural areas. Isolated event of harassment? Hardly! :(",Julia Graf,2019-07-17T19:45:48Z,0
