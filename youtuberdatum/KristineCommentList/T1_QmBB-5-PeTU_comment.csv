We renovated our Airstream from scratch using all repurposed materials. It does take awhile for sure. We made a lot of mistakes. Especially using tools that were 30 years old. Doing a great job keep up the good work.,This Nomadic Idea,2020-05-11T17:25:42Z,0

Love the transformations you&#39;re making.      Was very concerned to see Kristen at the table saw while hair loose ..... please just don&#39;t use it unless hair tied back .......,iamsoaringeagle,2020-05-11T12:51:43Z,0
