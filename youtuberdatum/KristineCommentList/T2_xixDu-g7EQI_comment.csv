"(Disclaimer this is the perspective of a 12 year old)<br /><br />Im okay with manufacturing as long as things aren‚Äôt super mass produced and use child labor and/or workers are under paid. I do think everybody should eat organic, but i also think that u should be able to eat candy once in a a while.",ZequinS,2021-04-22T11:24:38Z,1

This is important information chemicals are so bad and they are everywhere and in everything,On Tour With Dridgers,2020-11-17T17:58:18Z,1
"This is all nice for the rich, but not everyone can afford to buy everything&quot;organic&quot; specially when there&#39;s not enough research to back it up. I&#39;m glad those that can afford it are making changes but this channel (and your Instagram stories) are starting to sound preachy to me. Loved this channel when it was more about travel but now I can&#39;t connect with you anymore. Loved it while it last though!",Piscoandmartinis,2020-11-16T20:57:53Z,2

"Lots of good info.  I try so hard to make my family see how chemicals aren&#39;t good for you.  I got excited about your milk but our grandson is allergic to tree nuts.  That came on all of a sudden.  He used to sit and east cashews with Papa every morning.  Then about 4 yrs old, he started breaking out and would get a purple rash around his mouth or hives up the side of his face.  We got him tested.  Can you please tell me about your hair color.  It&#39;s so pretty.  HUGS~Donna",DWDinAtlanta,2020-11-16T07:36:50Z,0

"I&#39;m sorry, but what&#39;s the science between the chemicals of non organic towels going into the bloodstream, because I&#39;m sceptical about that. It&#39;s still good to have natural materials, and I also believe natural fabrics can be good for your skin especially if you have sensitive skin and get irritated skin fast.",Alexandra,2020-11-15T17:07:53Z,0
"@Alexandra To me, it makes sense as much as it does about the food we put in our bodies. We can&#39;t escape all the chemicals and harmful things in this world, so in areas where we can do better, I believe we should. There are so many chemicals in household items, beauty products, clothing, etc that don&#39;t need to be.",Kristen & Siya,2020-11-15T18:32:42Z,2
"@Kristen &amp; Siya I must say I looked it up there&#39;s definitely not been enough research about it, all research is from bias companies that sell organic things or really small research, with almost no testing so not really liable. It&#39;s interesting, so I hope they&#39;ll do larger scale more liable research. Definitely think it&#39;s good to buy organic things from a environmental point of view. I do believe that to some extent it can get in your skin but I don&#39;t believe so much gets in your skin that it becomes bad for your health or dangerous (I&#39;m talking here about the fabrics that are allowed to be sold in the EU, with the health regulations) But that&#39;s just what I believe in.",Alexandra,2020-11-15T17:55:33Z,0

I love it!!! It&#39;s definitely given me something to think about. Especially as I get ready to move to Colorado into my own apartment for the first time ever.,Danielle Rose,2020-11-15T16:52:44Z,3
Yessss! How exciting. It took a lot of research and digging to find these companies but I love them. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.,Kristen & Siya,2020-11-15T16:58:11Z,1
"Listen world Organic is the way we should be living, free of all manufactured ingredients and a world that develops naturally. Great job guys",livinglifefrom55,2020-11-15T16:14:06Z,5
"100% agree! People just don&#39;t know how important it is for our health and the planet. We consume without thinking twice about it but once you start realizing how our purchases effect so many things, it&#39;s difficult to not be conscious of it all.",Kristen & Siya,2020-11-15T17:01:29Z,0
