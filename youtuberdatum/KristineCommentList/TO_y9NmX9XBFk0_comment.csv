When did you start traveling with your baby? I was thinking of traveling with baby due to work at around 1 month if it works out after she’s born but I’m not sure if she’ll be okay or not. It’s going to be about a 6 hour flight... <br /><br />Thank you so much for this checklist! Definitely needed it!,ManiacalMind,2019-03-13T11:27:56Z,0

"&quot;Cute Baby&quot;, There, Happy You Tube? I clicked on and commented on one of this lovely ladies videos. Now, can you stop shoehorning her videos as a secondary additional commercial that&#39;s over 15 minutes long during the 8-11 minute shows I want to watch?<br />I got no (real) problem with commercials, but when You(Tube) make me suffer through multiple commercials over 15 minutes each from the same person (especially when I&#39;m trying to watch a silly you tube video that&#39;s only 8 and a half minutes long) then I get annoyed.<br /><br />Especially when I&#39;m busy cooking and have to drop everything and wash my hands just to hit the skip button. <br /><br />Also, great video, well presented, good editing and very useful information for any parent needing... whatever it is this video is going on about, honestly, I wasn&#39;t paying attention to any of it at all. ty =)<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9NmX9XBFk0&amp;t=5m35s"">5:35</a> ok ok ok ONE thing about this video caught my eye as I was typing this comment seeing as I was still able to see the bottom of the video at the top of my screen...

"&quot;Babies scratch a lot.&quot; Mine never did and according to my mum, I never did. My niece and nephew never did, either. Also, that &#39;snot sucker&#39; is something we don&#39;t use, over here. I have never seen it. Nothing like that. What we use is a lot smaller. More like a small bottle that you squeeze the air out of, before you put it in your baby&#39;s nose and then you let go and it&#39;ll suck the snot out. It&#39;s much easier to clean, I think. And it&#39;s easier to take with you.",Wicked Karma,2019-03-07T11:13:04Z,1

"As baby gets bigger and so do their clothes, you can use larger zip lock bags as travel vacumm bags by just rolling the air out of it, making it more compact. I took two of my children on a winter holiday overseas and was able to pack a full set of clothes (jeans, hoodie, t-shirt, thermal pants, thermal shirt, socks, fleece neck warmer, beanie, underwear) on the plane so that before we hit our destination, I was able to change them into warmer clothes on the plane. You can also use them to carry nappies, making them more compact, especially as they get bigger in size. I used the largest zip lock bags from Ikea (6L for clothes, 4.5L for nappies). I have a similar bag to your nappy bag and was able to fit all that plus more into that bag for two children aged 18 months and 4 years👍🏼",chocoaquaduck,2019-03-06T21:46:09Z,0
