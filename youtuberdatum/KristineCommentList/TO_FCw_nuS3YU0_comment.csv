"@Kristen &amp; Siya Back home to Canada (British Columbia) for a visit. My husband is studying in the UK, so we live here temporarily and travel around Europe while we&#39;re here. I love going home, but I always dread that nasty flight.",Mikeila Li,2019-05-15T10:01:46Z,2

Is airport lounges accessible for economic class travelers?,Chelsea Wang,2019-05-12T10:25:23Z,0
"Yup! We have what&#39;s called a &quot;Priority Pass.&quot; You pay a yearly fee for it but if you travel often, it&#39;s worth it because the lounges have buffets, drinks, showers, rest areas, internet, etc. We got our Priority Pass for free with our American Express Platinum card, which also gives us points for travel whenever we spend money using it.",Kristen & Siya,2019-05-15T03:14:14Z,1

"Love your watch :D Important to specify that on the plane, the food has tons of *REFINED CARBS, because natural carbs are good, I&#39;m sure you know that :) But yeah tons of white bread, pasta, cakes... Not so good, eh? I&#39;m a health-conscious vegan so I don&#39;t really rely on airplane food haha",holisticmaya,2019-05-10T09:35:45Z,0
I ALWAYS bring my own snacks for this reason exactly. Plane food makes me feel so Blahhhhhh and then backs me up for days. Not fun.,Kristen & Siya,2019-05-15T03:15:41Z,0

I totally love the tips!  A few years ago I started to make a habit of bringing a stick of deoderant after I smelled horrible after running across an airport trying to make a connection. I almost passed out when i put my luggage in the overhead bin!  I will try those Kleenex wipes this week!,Roy T,2019-05-10T00:46:43Z,0
"Your tips are very helpful, thanks! We travel quite a lot and usually do 2 very long flights a year (we live in New Zealand, so everything is quite far away 🙂). Even for experienced travellers, it can be tricky to find the right way of staying fresh and not having a jet lag after such long flights! We are going on our next big adventure in June so we&#39;ll definitely use some of your tips then! 👍👍👍",theStyleJungle,2019-05-09T22:19:38Z,0

"Another tip for ladies; don&#39;t wear a bra on the plane but keep one in your carry-on and change about an hour/ hour an a half before you land! A friend told me about it, so I tried it and it was so nice to not have tight clothing on. It is way more comfortable!",Victoria Granicz,2019-05-09T18:36:06Z,22
