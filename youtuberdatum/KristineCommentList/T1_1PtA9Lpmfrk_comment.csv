"As you know, I&#39;ve been editing my old photos. Though I&#39;ve been stuck on 2018 for ages since that&#39;s when I started traveling. It&#39;s hard to be objective for quality when it all tugs at the memory heartstrings :)",ADragonAmongRoses,2020-05-18T03:19:10Z,0

"Another tip: Watch Slow TV!! <br /><br />There are a bunch of good quality slow tv videos on YouTube. You can go on a train ride through the Swiss Mountains, a boat ride through the English Canals, or walk through the Streets of Japan!  <br /><br />Get a feel for the places you want to travel to and feel calmer at the same time.",Lyndsie Plowman,2020-03-26T04:46:45Z,0

"If you&#39;re allowed outdoors, you can go to local parks and hiking locations. If takeout or delivery is possible where you live you can explore your local cuisine. Culture exists everywhere, not just in distant lands.",EpicPseudonym,2020-03-24T16:26:12Z,9
