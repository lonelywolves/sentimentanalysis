"The sugarcane juice usually come with black salt and ginger. The egg taste is from the black salt, try it without, it tastes like a whole different drink. I like it both ways but I like black salt and pink salt over white salt anyways. But it definitely tastes better with ginger, lemon, mint (and garam masala powder if you want a little spice). I hope this helps",Big Oil Production,2019-12-03T23:34:27Z,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EI38bq-RM0&amp;t=06m00s"">06:00</a> I wonder why u guys didnt take the Kaghan route?<br />It is shorter in distance and a lot quicker. <br />Moreover you bet to pass through Naran, the most visited tourist destination in Pakistan. And u could see in Naran ..Legendary Lake Saiful Malook at 10,700ft above sea level... I bet u havent seen a lake any hogher than this<br /><br />Then u pass by serene Lake Lulusar... then you elevate to a height of 13,691 feet at Babusar Pass (or &quot;Top&quot;), its twice as high as the highest pass in Canada.<br /><br />It would have saved you hours <br />It takes almost the same time to get to Besham or Naran<br />But then, from naran to Chilas is 3 hrs.... and besham to chilas is 6 hours 40 min<br />so u probably save 3 hours of driving ... but the best thing is Naran route is way way way more scenic<br />Not to mention , it doesnt have that problem of &quot;Landslides&quot; that you have (and did) encounter on KKH",naveed418,2020-08-10T12:55:46Z,0

Sugarcane juice 😂<br /><br />I hate it because It tastes sooo yuck because they crush ginger &amp; lemons along with skin in the same machine in which they crush the sugarcane. But I don&#39;t know why the ginger taste so strong.  I had it only once and not more than a few sips. I dont have a taste for ginger juice so I could never drink it. But I do love eating sugarcane by itself (crushing the sugarcane pieces with you own teeth to drive out the juice). It tastes great because it has no added flavours of skin-on ginger and lemon.,Travel Log,2019-06-29T18:46:07Z,0

"It breaks my heart to see how wrong people perceive Pakistan. Its not at a terrorist country and we don&#39;t shelter terrorists here as well. I mean who in their right mind would shelter terrorists anyway? Still I don&#39;t blame the people, it&#39;s their media which made Pakistan look really really bad. It feels like a conspiracy against Pakistan to keep tourists away from its natural beauty and culture but you can see these videos yourself of the people who aren&#39;t paid and actually visited and their perspectives changed. We are peace loving people and we also hate terrorism.",Electro Wizard,2019-06-22T04:54:22Z,0

"have never put salt in sugarcane juice ever, or seen anyone do that, maybe its a islamabad-area style. that weird taste in sugarcane juice is the pink/himalayan salt i am sure.  also that was not white curry, it was murgh makhani i believe.<br />Also you totally can put rice on Naan :D saw my grandma do this (naan + adas pulao/lentil pulao) and i still do it to this date. its not a travesty ;)",M SM,2019-06-18T05:15:02Z,0

"sugar cane juice had black salt in it, next time tell the vendor not to add black salt; if you just want to taste sugar cane juice only. ( you can add lemon, ginger and black salt to the juice on request for taste)<br />Benefits of sugar cane juice: Prevents cancer: Sugarcane juice is alkaline in nature because of the high concentration of calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, and manganese, which helps prevent diseases like cancer, that cannot survive in an alkaline environment. Thus it helps in fighting various types of cancer such as prostate and breast cancer",BLUE Neon,2019-06-15T21:35:20Z,0

Hahaha.. that stuff which kind gives it a sulphur smell is black salt. That&#39;s why probably it smells like egg to thise people who are not familiar to it. But once you drink it a few times and you get used to it then it not at all feels like egg and is very delicious.

No these people heard it from someone who have never been to pakistan.,Sher khan,2019-06-13T16:15:32Z,4
Kristen &amp; Siya I knew it but at the same time I can’t blame them because those people get fed BS by the media. At the end of the day western media despite its major flaws are still very powerful at spreading lies and being decieptful. <br />Peace from Rawalpindi,Midlands 88,2019-06-12T14:33:39Z,14
Kristen &amp; Siya lots of love from Pakistan... stay blessed 🇵🇰❤️,Izzi Vizzy,2019-06-11T22:19:05Z,9
@Midlands 88 No they didn&#39;t. Everyone who visited there loves it. The ones who didnt were the ones who were worried. I always felt safe in Pakistan.,Kristen & Siya,2019-06-11T21:16:10Z,47

"U ll see things will b free in Pakistan for u. We don&#39;t take money from our guests.  Whenever u visit Pakistan do cover culture and people as well cz the viewers love to see the common ppl. Visit top universities of big cities n talk to the students there in ur vlogs. It&#39;s gonna b super hit. Cover educated n uneducated ppl, elite n the masses as well as fashionable n common ppl. Show diversity which really exists in the country but the vlogers fail to cover. U r gonna get much support. Welcome in advance :)",awesome blossom,2019-06-15T00:57:58Z,0
