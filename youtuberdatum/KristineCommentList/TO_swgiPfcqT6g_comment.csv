"I did something very Canadian while camping last week.

"I just got home from camping and this reminds me of it. it was so fun. we were camping at Purden Lake BC with my cousins for a week. we went fishing (nearly caught a rainbow trout), played at the park, swam, kayaked, and my brother and I found a little island and named it Stellers island (we was a stellers jay in the trees of the island). it was only about a meter by 2 meters wide of an island but enough to have a &quot;mountain&quot;, a &quot;harbor&quot; and a &quot;desert&quot;. <br />lots of good memories.<br /><br />(edit) in the case of food we were glamping. we had salmon locks on bagels with capers. naan, rice, and chicken with tzatziki dip. bannock and crapes. thank my granny because she was the cook for all of those things.",Closet Demon,2019-08-20T20:19:17Z,1

"Amazing, we will definitely have to check this out on our travels!",Starr & Daniel,2019-08-15T17:40:01Z,1
is it a national park or a provincial park?  I noticed in Quebec they call their provincial parks &quot;national&quot; but that is usually a designation reserved for parks run by Parks Canada as opposed to Sepaq.,Selah Moreno,2019-08-15T17:30:50Z,0
"@Selah Moreno it definitely is confusing! And no you wont be able to use your parks Canada pass for this, but I definitely encourage you to check out all the SEPAQ parks as they are all as beautiful and well maintained as the Canadien Parks",Rachelle Hamilton,2019-08-26T19:09:57Z,2
@Rachelle Hamilton Thank you!  It is a bit confusing sometimes to know which ones you can access for free in Quebec with a Parks Canada annual pass.  The only one near the MTL area seems to be La Mauricie.,Selah Moreno,2019-08-23T15:08:19Z,1
"It&#39;s a provincial Park. WE love to call everything in Quebec National. But if it is run by the Sepaq, it is run by the Quebec Gov and not part of Parks Canada",Rachelle Hamilton,2019-08-22T20:33:33Z,2
