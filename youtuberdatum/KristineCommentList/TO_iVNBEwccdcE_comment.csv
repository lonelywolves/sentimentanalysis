Also a great safe place for travel is Japan! I did go with some friends but I did many alone excursions including walking around Kyoto very late at night. I never once felt unsafe. Plus the food there is amazing and the people are extremely nice! A lot of locals were interested in having a conversation. While Tokyo is really cool I suggest going to the smaller towns,Kate Fox,2019-07-10T18:29:31Z,0
Dominican republic (minus the current issues there) and Barbados gave me a feeling of safety. In D.R. I met the friendliest ppl i have ever met in any country so far. In Barbados you can catch a local public transportation bus and move around just like the locals. I would go back to both countries solo  (once the current D.R. issues are addressed).,Ebony Lady,2019-07-03T15:49:40Z,0

"These are some great suggestions. I live in the New England area and have also done much traveling, but only recently solo. I‚Äôd like to ad that those who want to travel and experience a totally different culture from the US that is easily accessible and muncher cheaper than the above mentioned destinations, look no further than Quebec, Canada. I have been there twice and I feel like there is so much more to explore. First off, Canadians are very friendly by nature, and if you can‚Äôt speak any French, but at least make an effort to say Bon jour or merci, you will be met with the utmost respect ( most speak English in the urban areas). Montreal and Quebec City both have their modern areas, but when you go into the Vieux Carre, or Old city areas, it is like stepping into a a quaint European city with tons of history. Also, for nature lovers, there is skiing in the Winter, whales in the Summertime; for a couple examples....there is just too much to mention all in this brief comment; you have to go and google this amazing area. Did I mention, the US dollar is worth a bit more than the Canadian dollar.... but for how long? Also, I believe you can cross the border with a pass card which is easier to get than the traditional passport. So go on and explore. Your very welcome üòä‚ù§Ô∏è",Mickey 74,2019-05-20T20:21:32Z,0

@La Toya Hill That&#39;s how the Italians treat everyone! They never approach single people at a restaurant - they don&#39;t want one person taking up a table for 4.What does eew mean? the older Italian shoe salesman will treat everyone like that - that is simply being Italian - sorry but I think you have the problem. This is how the Italians treat everyone regardless of colour and it means absolutely nothing. They are simply being southern Europeans and as a white woman I&#39;ve often been treated like this - its just the way they are! In their culture that is not being disrespectful - just normal.,Elizabeth Woodmansee,2020-01-18T08:49:43Z,2

"Agree 100% for Switzerland and Korea! (And portugal and italia) Switzerland is so peaceful at night, I am really really scared to be alone at night I‚Äôve been harassed multiple time like 99% of girls in this worls and it terrifies me, I went there this winter and it was beautiful you will really feel good there, <br />Now, my favorite Korea! I went in Korea for 3 weeks with my bf and it was magical I really found myself there people are adorable, food is amaziiiiing and cheap, airbnb‚Äôs are cheap, clothes and makeup are cheap, and there is sooo much to discover! Because it‚Äôs a small country you can visit a lot of cities by bus and not only staying in Seoul, I‚Äôve been to Jeju island which I love sooooo much, U-do island a little island nearby Jeju, Gyeongju is the city to learn about culture and it‚Äôs beautiful! Busan is the second biggest city in korea and it‚Äôs really great if you love clubbing and people are really friendly! <br />And because I love so much Korea I will go for my first time alone for 3 weeks!!",Chloe,2019-02-07T00:40:20Z,0
