"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=leA1-Bh2vDs&amp;t=10m15s"">10:15</a> « When we were just settlers here » is an incorrect sentence. All lands in Canada were occupied by Indigenous peoples.

"Okay, so...<br />(1) I&#39;m all about Road Trips and when I saw one of my favorite YT travel channels had a new Road Trip video, I literally hit &#39;pause&#39; at the beginning of this video long enough so I could make a fresh pot of coffee to enjoy it with. And, as usual, it was fun!<br />(2) I want to permanently move to &quot;Ghosttown Blues&quot; and live in that big truck! The reading I could get done there! :o <br />(3) The fogged-in lookout point was hilarious, Lol.<br />(4) Great video, you have an awesome channel!
