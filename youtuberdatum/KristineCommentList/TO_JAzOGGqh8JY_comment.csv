"This one time, we were traveling with some awesome peeps in the jungles of Guatemala and came across a cave. 😉 A Mayan family was selling some handmade jewelry pieces made out of coconut shells that matched the symbols from the Mayan calendar. They helped us determine which symbol represented each of us based on our exact birthday and we each bought a necklace. We also bought some Pounamu during our time in New Zealand. Brittany wears hers all the time! It was fun watching you guys share your jewelry and your stories! 💕",WorldWideWakleys,2019-05-25T09:58:20Z,0
"Hello! Your pieces are awesome, glad you treasure them and related to your experiences. I would like to mention that the cocaine necklace it&#39;s not called cocaine, it&#39;s a coca leaf. Cocaine its the drug (made with a whole lot of chemicals, being really not much of the plant on it). The leaf by itself, in its natural state, has been use for ages mostly as an energy tea/drink/gum (like coffee). Also, that red and black seed from the amazon you mention its called Huayruro, used on jewelry as a token of protection and good luck. Hope you guys get to collect so many more cool pieces!",Infructuosa Felicidad,2019-05-13T02:08:45Z,1

"I love collecting jewelry when I travel! I have a pair of amber studs from Poland and a sparkly silver ring from an antique shop in Stockholm. I also had an amber ring from Poland but the amber fell out of it :( <a href=""http://www.thatgirlaway.com/"">www.thatgirlaway.com</a>",Allison B,2019-05-06T22:38:46Z,0

"At first I thought this was going to be you announcing your own jewelry collection (which would be cool) but this was so much better! Loved your memories incorporated with each piece. It&#39;s inspiring me to look more closely at jewelry while traveling. I&#39;m off to Morocco, Egypt, Jordan and India later this year so I will definitely be paying more attention, because I love this!",Courtney K,2019-05-02T12:31:36Z,0
"I love jewellery, and I try when I travel to bring some home to remind me of the good memories. I have a Heathergem necklace bought from the factory in Scotland in 2013 with my family that was a seconds piece. It was the same day we visited Colloden, it is a yellow, green and pink heart with a leather strap. It has a small nick at the back, which makes it so unique, and special. I wear it a lot. It also reminds me of my Scottish grandfather who passed away almost five years ago who I was really close to. When I returned to Scotland this year in February, I bought a heather gems ring close to the border, with a similar &quot;stone&quot; encased in Stirling silver.",Jordananana,2019-05-02T09:40:18Z,0

"Wooo finally! Ok, first of all, hell yes, that “Colonel Angus” ring is friggin awesome! Where in India did you find it? Also, if you guys are interested in coca and its cultural significance in the Andes, check out the book The Hold Life Has by Catherine J. Allen. Ahh and I love coconut jewelry! When I was in Gili Air last September it was right after the earthquake so not many travelers were there and one artisan who carves coconut jewelry asked me if I wanted to learn - I was like “umm I dunno, how much for a lesson?” and he goes “What? Nothing, I’m just bored” 😂 and, suffice it to say, I was absolutely terrible at it 😂",Lauren Aida,2019-05-01T16:49:28Z,5
