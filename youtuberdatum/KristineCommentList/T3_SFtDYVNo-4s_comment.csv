I know it&#39;s bad and I&#39;m sure people who have seen our packing videos have noticed... I use a plastic shopping bag. Which I guess is a good way to recycle them. I put the shoes in the bag in place of a packing cube bag. We&#39;ve talked about getting a real bag haha but for now that&#39;s what we&#39;re rocking with. I&#39;m definitely going to check out the jewelry case. I get rings in each country I visit. Ever since my college study abroad trip. - SE,The City and Beyond,2021-04-01T02:41:30Z,1

"I like to have 1 set of clothes in my carry on just in case my suitcase gets lost or delayed. That way I do have a set of clothes to change into.<br />Haven&#39;t used packing cubes yet, but they&#39;re on my list to buy.",Jen S,2021-02-03T00:13:27Z,2
"Me too, I always keep a change of clothes at the ready. The one thing to watch for with packing cubes, is that you don’t go over the weight limit with the extra space. 😁 The struggle is real.",fishandfloral,2021-02-03T01:03:07Z,0
