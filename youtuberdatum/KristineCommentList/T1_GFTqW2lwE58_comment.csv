I say B cut it in half! Can&#39;t wait until it&#39;s all done. Good luck on that paint .. I would have given up a long time ago. ... Also where the heck are you going to put a washer and freezer?? Excited to see!!,Danielle D,2020-07-01T11:40:47Z,0

"@Kristen You should definitely learn how to drive the airstream, even if you choose not to 99% of the time. You don&#39;t want to have to deal with an emergency where you&#39;re the only one who can drive, and have THAT be your learning experience. Start on a flat drive with no time constraints and take it slowly. It&#39;s nerve wracking at first, but just take it one step at a time, and you&#39;ll be powering up those mountains in no time! <br /><br />The scariest part for me was changing lanes in heavy city traffic and worrying about getting stuck on a back road somewhere I couldn&#39;t turn around. But I survived and so will you. :D",Lyre Paradox,2020-06-30T13:44:55Z,1
This is great advice. I definitely will. Ive done it before but was sweating the entire time I had to pull over. We were also going up and down big hills. Ill do it again though! Feel the fear and do it anyways!!!,Kristen & Siya,2020-06-30T16:18:01Z,0
Aw! I want to see done so bad!!! It&#39;s looking so good. So grateful with the sneak peeks on Instagram!,Llenando el Pasaporte,2020-06-30T03:14:57Z,0
Definitely option B! Never know when you&#39;ll need a spare bed and the gained floor space of option A doesn&#39;t really do much. You could even extend counter top with a drop leaf solution so that you can fold it down should you not need it üôÉ excited to see what you come up with the natural paint! I&#39;ve seen a video from @jonna Hinton where she makes her own pigments out of the soil of her garden or dry materials she grounds to dust. She uses an acrylic base to hold the paint together but I wonder if you can find a sustainable alternative to that too üòò,Linda Tentori,2020-06-29T23:32:25Z,2

I would LOVE to see a video collab where y&#39;all and @KaraAndNate meet up!!! It would be cool to compare tiny home/ van life &amp; life being on the road with and without a child!! üòÅüòÅüòÅ<br />Love y&#39;all so much!!!!

Chop the table and bench in half. Maybe trundle the bench for extra storage... it looks amazing. You are both wonderful.,Chelsea-Leigh Flucus,2020-06-28T18:35:06Z,1
"My suggestion is to shorten the benches so you still can use it as a smaller bed, and using what you have with the table (if possible), make/install a Laguna table, that is smaller and can be moved out of the way or removed. More options with that. I love the idea of a Dutch door!",Marjie Cleveland,2020-06-28T18:31:54Z,11

"OMG the propane switch! I had a similar issue with my first laptop. I spent weeks thinking my speakers were broken. Then one day I brought my laptop in to work (I worked at a hospital coffee kiosk), and a doctor who was one of my regulars was admiring it. I mentioned my audio issue and he said he could look at it. His first instinct was to look at the side of the laptop for a volume control, which had never occurred to me, a lifetime desktop user who had never touched a laptop before. The problem was solved in seconds haha.",EpicPseudonym,2020-06-28T18:03:01Z,0
