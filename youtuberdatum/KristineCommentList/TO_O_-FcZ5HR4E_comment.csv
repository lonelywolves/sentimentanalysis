"Ironic how in the beginning she talks about waste and the environment with the travel size plastic bottles. But then goes on to encourage single use plastic with sandwich bags, plastic wrap covering the bottles to prevent leaks...and tin foil to wrap the makeup brush🤔",Monica B,2019-08-14T03:10:27Z,0

"Love this, so helpful! Luckily, I wear zero makeup 99% of the time, so I save so much space and hassle.",Cassie Miller-Iozzia,2019-02-27T02:07:13Z,2
"Oh I love Lush’s dry shampoo - and I’m a hairstylist! I’ve tried many. It’s better for you, the environment and you can put it in a mini bottle to bring with you. Lasts MUCH longer than aerosol - I used to buy aerosol ones every 3 months. My lush one lasted 2 years. And where it’s powder and I can control it, the staying power of the dry shampoo lasts!",Luba Alanna,2019-02-18T15:41:47Z,1
"Also! I agree, pack the peppermint tea ! I also bring lemongrass. Soothes me",Luba Alanna,2019-02-18T15:42:43Z,0
how do you carry coconut oil on your travels? it tends to leak in mine due to the solid to liquid nature of the product...,Mylene Barry,2019-01-23T01:18:21Z,0
"Love these hacks Kristen! I totally agree with using refillable travel containers to fill up with your skincare or cosmetics. Can i also suggest makeup brush guards instead of tinfoils. You can find a pack of 20 on ebay and they&#39;re quite cheap. Just imagine socks, but for makeup brushes. xx",Jonina,2019-01-17T13:00:15Z,1

"Well, the coconut oil  is not that great. It  can clog your pores, doesnt do anything for teeth (many people use.it), it can dry up your skin and hair,, it is not good for using in a kitchen and so on. Not a good thing. I dont really get why it is so popular 😀 <br /><br />Otherwise, some of the tips are good 😊",lucienne,2019-01-13T18:53:45Z,5
"I&#39;ve been using coconut oil for nearly 25 years now. My hair isn&#39;t dry, it is super glossy and soft. Every time I colour my hair or have used too much heat on it, the oil helps me undo all the damage. And all this without using any conditioner!",A Naari,2019-02-22T10:07:11Z,1
"Coconut oil is comedonic, really not good for your skin. I prefer Arganoil or Jojoba Oil",Anna L,2019-02-17T21:46:41Z,0
"My best friend used it for her hair and she swore by it. After a couple years of using it her hair started to be really dry and she had to stop using it and cut a lot of her hair because nothing helped. It may be working for you but it could be a disaster for someone else.  I used it as a face moisturizer for a while and i got really bad acne (i have never had acne this bad before, just a few pimples). It was really bad. I used it also as a body mositurizer in that time and my skin never looked worse. Dry patches all over it and looking really gross. I have never cooked with coconut oil but i have read a few articles that wete saying that for the health is as bad as   using animal fat maybe even worse. 😀",lucienne,2019-01-13T20:29:55Z,1
I&#39;ve been using it for years and love it. I first heard about using it when I was in the south of India 8 years ago. The women there use it in their hair and are known for having incredibly beautiful hair. I started doing it and that&#39;s how my hair stays silky and hydrated. I also use it on my body and my babys. Not my face though and for many other things. Its worked for me.,Kristen & Siya,2019-01-13T20:00:21Z,4
Great tips! I always forget about the straw trick! Thanks for the reminder. 😉 I&#39;m getting ready to pack for our next trip! Do you have a resource I could read about the coconut oil on your face thing? 😬 I&#39;d love to learn more about this! Or maybe you could just share more of your wisdom? 😊,WorldWideWakleys,2019-01-13T18:23:21Z,0
"Heyyyy pretty hackster 😁 Could Siya sometime also do one of these for the guys? You know, some basic MacGyver shit.. how to trim butt-hair in a tent or what to put on your shirt, so no one notices that you haven&#39;t brushed your teeth etc. 😅 Just a little wish! 🙏 🙏🙏",Jason Evans,2019-01-13T17:40:19Z,7

"I curl my eyelashes with a thin spoon and it works so much better than a regular eyelash curler. Added bonus, I don’t hurt my lids with the curler hehe. Great hacks! Thank you for sharing",elizabethdalloway,2019-01-13T17:33:45Z,1

"I don’t wear a lot of makeup when traveling, so I just make my own bb cream type product. Take a small travel container and squirt some of your moisturizer and foundation inside, then mix it up. Voila. It’s got SPF, moisturizer, and light coverage. You can get fancy with serums and whatnot too. Come to think of it, you can probably get everything you need as free Sephora samples and just mix them together. I usually have like 5 nearly empty foundation bottles on the go, so this is how I use them up.",Stacey aka pinkysworn,2019-01-13T17:15:40Z,0
You can definetly just get a bunch of sephora samples Haha.,Kristen & Siya,2019-01-13T20:02:33Z,0
