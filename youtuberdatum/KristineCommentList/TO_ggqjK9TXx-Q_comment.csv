"Are we talking about just 10 items in your bag, like  not including a handbag, I only have a small handbag that I travel with for things like travel docs, passport, phone/charger, meds, small wallet, little things e.g.pen etc... it&#39;s like playing tetris but I fit heaps in a bag about half the size of an a4 piece of paper, does that stuff count or just what I would take in backpack like yours??",Nikki Morrison,2020-01-16T06:38:41Z,0
This is what I‚Äôd bring <br /><br />(First to beat the system I would wear my hair in a messy bun with 2 hair ties and Bobby pins.

"Shit, if I did that I&#39;d have three spots taken by must have medicine. Two of them being life-saving. I could do it though. I&#39;d probably wear the same pants the whole time--only switching out the top. Wear a light jacket on the plane.",Alykia,2019-06-15T17:44:54Z,1

"I feel like if you do it again, the basic toiletries (toothbrush- and paste, bar of soap) shouldn‚Äòt count.

When I‚Äôm struggling to get my pack weight down I ask myself ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the worst thing that can happen if I don‚Äôt take this item?‚Äù And if I‚Äôm ok with that and have an alternative then I leave it behind. Really helps me on long trips because towards the end of my packing I used to say ‚Äúone more pair of socks won‚Äôt make a difference....‚Äù but really I can wash undies in the sink with soap if I really need to,pj,2019-01-30T23:19:12Z,6

Makeup... mascara, spf 50 cc cream,concealer, lip gloss, bronzer and face brush... that&#39;s my everyday.<br />Face... my skin is way to sensitive to use a bar soap so cleanser and  a moisturizer for night. Traveling to Italy 4 times to see my husband who was in the Navy made me realize what I REALLY needed. One back pack(not over stuffed) and a small carry on with wheels... If it didn&#39;t fit ... I didn&#39;t need it. <br />This was really cool.",melissa bridge,2019-01-30T18:22:25Z,1
"I have never really focused on &#39;cute&#39; or &#39;stylish&#39;, I guess that is the benefit of being a guy! The importance is always focused on comfort/versatility. <br /><br />We packed up and started a life in Cancun with only a backpack a piece and 1 suitcase. Certainly more than 10 items but it felt great downsizing.
