"Such beautiful interactions with locals! Love that you relied largely on local workers and paying them  ‚ù§Ô∏è There is a similar project near Misahualli that relies only on volunteers without the skills that are really needed and in a place where locals could really use the job. Also, I loved seeing that drone footage of pailon del diablo! I&#39;ve been there so many times but have never seen it from those angles üòç",Lauren Aida,2020-04-24T01:09:55Z,0
