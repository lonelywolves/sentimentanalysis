As the trip is over now and you are back to your country I&#39;ll be waiting for more because I feel you all have get along with each other so well and that friendship shows up on the screen. Wishing you so much of luck, love and happiness",Shafaq Farooq,2019-06-26T19:05:45Z,26
very well said! I definitely agree to very word of yours. Pakistan is no doubt a splendid country but mostly under rated by the western media. I wish people of west would have been vigilant enough to witness the truth themself anyways bravo to you siya and all your vlogger companions for experiencing the beauty- pakistan,maham abid,2019-06-26T20:09:25Z,2
