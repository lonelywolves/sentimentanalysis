"I really enjoy a handheld electric rivet gun. Expensive but sooo much easier! The manual one KILLED my hands...as a hand therapist, investing on the health of your hands is so important!! :) Beautiful airstream by the way!!",T M,2020-05-04T23:23:35Z,0
"To explain my first dislike on one of your videos: I&#39;m worried. You wouldn&#39;t be allowed to make such changes on your own where I come from. There are strict guidelines/ laws to follow to ensure your own, your childs&#39; and other road users&#39; safety. Please consider consulting at least a structural engineer, an architect or someone similar.. My best wishes to you.",Lia L.,2020-05-04T15:51:56Z,1
"@Kristen &amp; Siya Well, I live in Germany, the land of guidelines, rules and bureaucracy ;) It&#39;s not just about building a bed/ doing a renovation but also changing the whole static of the trailer. The changes have to be approved also to get/ keep it insured here. I realise that other countries handle things differently - which doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s safe. I really don&#39;t want to trash talk other countries&#39; rules. I&#39;m just worried for you. Thank you for responding (and maybe considering to get it checked).",Lia L.,2020-05-05T04:09:16Z,0
There are strict guidelines for building a bed or doing any type of renovation? I&#39;ve never heard of such a thing. Do you realize how many people do this? Where are you from?,Kristen & Siya,2020-05-04T20:46:09Z,0

"This is so cool, I‚Äôve missed Luna!   Do you have any privacy between Kai‚Äôs bed and your own space?",Kylie Lynne,2020-05-03T23:29:34Z,2
"Yup, we will have a curtain there. We also are dividing the two living spaces (bedrooms, washroom and kitchen, dining and office). There will be a door and we can turn our dining table into another bed if we wanna spend any nights there.",Kristen & Siya,2020-05-04T00:38:28Z,2
