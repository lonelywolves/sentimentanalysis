"Where do you leave your dogs when travelling? Would recommend leaving them for a longer period of time? I would like to travel and take my dog with me but I can&#39;t, she is a 19Kg dog and  I would have to put her in the cargo, I had to do this once and apparently she would not move at all for the whole time she was inside the aeroplane because she was too scared and I don&#39;t want to cause her to be scared or anxious again. She is an anxious dog by nature but she is very loving and very attached to me,  we like to be together and explore new places but she can&#39;t handle too many stimulations, she can&#39;t be in an overcrowded place because she would get anxious and overstimulated, she likes to be in natural places where she can be free, even though she is always checking up on me to make sure I&#39;m not too far from her. <br />I could leave her at my parent&#39;s house, which she knows very well, but they can&#39;t take her out much and she feels very sad when I&#39;m leaving her, even for just a few days, what should I do? should I give-up travelling?",Lucy Crivella,2021-02-22T14:35:25Z,0

Kristen - how tall is Atlas exactly? &lt;3 Can he stand up fully in his crate when it&#39;s under the seat or are they OK with him only being able to lie down then?,Saphyre Studios,2020-10-28T13:49:44Z,0
"People who have taken their slightly oversized dogs as hand luggage (meaning, not complying with all the height requirements of the airline), how strict are they when it comes to the dog being able to stand up fully in the crate? I want to buy a crate that allows my dog to stand up fully when expanded, but then, if it&#39;s to be put fully under the seat my dog will have to lie down during this time and the crate is made of mesh so it folds. He is able to turn around easy enough it seems. He is a dwarf poodle, 32cm/12.5&quot; tall, 5kg/11pounds. The flight will be in Europe so not longer than 4.5 hours.",Saphyre Studios,2020-10-28T13:46:14Z,0
"Thank you for this valuable information. You mentioned service dogs being allowed in the seat with you but this is inaccurate. Your service dog is required to fit under the seat in front of you. This is gonna be interesting because my service dog is a German Shepherd and I&#39;m pretty tall.... And some airlines will discriminate against you and prohibit you from flying in business or first class. This is totally against the law in the US but I&#39;ve had friends forced into economy seating and even kicked off the plane for refusing to be moved from the class they paid for to the lesser class. In most cases because the flight attendant hated or was afraid of dogs. Again, thank you for this valuable information. I had no idea about the Rover app and we&#39;re going to the Dominican Republic so I&#39;m hoping it comes in handy. Also, the information about the health certificates is spot on. Most countries I&#39;ve traveled to require a health certificate issued within 10 days prior to travel before they&#39;ll allow you to take your pet/service dog.",Dr. Michael Commini aka Dr. See,2020-10-23T07:48:29Z,0

after watching vlogs nonstop ifinally kno how to fly w my pup w and wo a carrier. just put a service dog harness on w ur leash if they r too big for a baggie. and get the extra leg room space pay a little extra. or get a regular seat. or even first class space to keep it safe. iwas having panicattacks about my flight taking my dog w me but ohh i feel so relieved to see so many take their big dog and small dog on flight and not have to put them in that bottom part of the plane,violadash,2020-06-03T11:02:31Z,0
"Maybe I misunderstood but I think you said you would put a SERVICE DOG vest to fly your pet dog? Let me explain something....only so many canines are allowed in the cabin. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A FAKE SERVICE DOG go thru the TSA scanner. To suggest someone buy a vest or patch for their pet so they can save a few dollars shows just how many pieces of üí© people there are. I HAVE A SERVICE DOG &amp; ITS SORRY ASS PEOPLE lying about their furbaby being a SERVICE DOG really pisses me off AND I can easily tell the difference. There&#39;s 2 things 99.999% of pet dogs will not do that only a properly trained SD does. TSA agents SHOULD BE EDUCATED to spot the &quot;fakes&quot;. My Berner is the poster child for a service dog in flight. He is NOT a pet. He is assistive medical equipment. He is my lifeline. He performs several lifesaving duties every day and knows 40+ commands. NOT TRICKS. I&#39;m not counting those. Tricks are what people teach their pet dogs. A service dog MUST know many commands and often the command isn&#39;t even spoken. So, If you ever run into me and my SD in an airport.....you can count on meeting me bcuz when I see somebody faking a service animal I have no problem calling them out on it &amp; I dont care who hears me!!! If I have to buy an extra seat bcuz of my SD&#39;s size when we fly on smaller planes, then you can bet I&#39;m watchful of people and their pets.",Tales from the Leash Bernie & Amy,2020-08-27T04:10:25Z,1
