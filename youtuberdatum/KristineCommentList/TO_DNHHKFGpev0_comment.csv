Who here is in a relationship but wants to travel solo?,Kristen & Siya,2019-01-27T15:29:45Z,50
"So unlucky my husband doesn&#39;t want me to travel alone ever since.  I thought he is just being protective,  truth is he doesn&#39;t trust the people around.  He has a lot of limiting beliefs.  And I feel so controlled !",Reycel Mae Pinuela,2020-04-14T14:18:44Z,0
I&#39;m gonna travel to Thailand for 3 weeks this February. At first he was sad and felt like I didn&#39;t like traveling with him and also scared that I would meet somebody else who I find more interesting or something like that. We talked a lot about it and now he understands me and supports the decision. He told me he&#39;s proud to have a brave girlfriend and I&#39;m so happy how everything turned out 🥰,Luise Lacht,2020-01-09T16:35:01Z,0

"I would love to travel with my partner but with my profession in education and being a  single mother  I cannot really afford it. My partner is wealthy but he doesn&#39;t believe in paying for someone else so I usually spend holidays with my child  locally or  go abroad to spend time with my parents. I was always ok with it and  accepting it before being with my current boyfriend but now hearing his  travel stories, seeing the photos  of beautiful places he visits makes me feel very left out.  We are just two  completely different people. In past I used to date a guy who was financially worse than me, but I loved him and I would  often pay for out trips so that we could both experience things together, I would rather be with him in a cheaper hotel than by myself. This are the kind of things people should discuss on first dates  before becoming attached to someone. His choice of leaving me alone because I cannot    afford to go with him, kind of makes me resent him and i don&#39;t think I will be able to carry on any longer with a man I am loosing respect for. If he couldn&#39;t afford to take me with him there wouldn&#39;t be any problem, but he can and chooses not to.",Ella,2021-01-24T18:31:12Z,0
All of the reasons given are no excuse to travel alone. No reason not to compromise and do things you both like. Unless you are willing to compromise you arent ready for a relationship. A relationship is about experiencing things together.,apope06,2020-12-27T17:23:49Z,2
A partner traveling alone for months is like a breakup. Its like you dont have a partner anymore.,apope06,2020-12-27T17:19:28Z,1

"I guess I&#39;m in that weird minority of people whose spouse is SUPER supportive of me solo travelling. My husband is military, so we already spend months apart and don&#39;t have to see each other every day for our relationship to work. He also doesn&#39;t care to travel much when he&#39;s home because of the fact that he spends so much time away already. So, if I tell him I want to go somewhere and he&#39;s not interested or he&#39;s already away, it&#39;s a simple &quot;Have fun honey. If you like it, maybe we can go together in the future.&quot; Kind of conversation. I lucked out and married someone who loves me because of the fact that I&#39;m independent and encourages my independence and vice versa. But I think the big thing is having that open dialogue and communication and trust in your significant other that helps those conversations along.",Tamrha Echols,2019-08-18T08:06:52Z,0

Hi. I would like to get some personal advice. Can I send in an email?,J,2019-04-10T09:45:42Z,0
Thank you for this video. I&#39;m 35 yrs old. I&#39;ve been married 14 yrs and have a 13 yr old and a 15 year old. This year I&#39;m planning my first solo trip to Thailand. I&#39;ll be gone for the whole month of June. My friends and family think I&#39;m crazy.... but I explained to my hubby (who is incredible) that something about it is just calling me and I will always regret it if I don&#39;t do it. He is being supportive and I am so grateful to him. <br />  He has the added responsibility of taking care of kids while I am gone (they can almost take care of self but you know what I mean) plus he is the income provider (I&#39;m a sahm) so he is footing the bill. <br />   Even a few years ago I don&#39;t think he would have ever been ok with me going. It has taken a long time to build the trust and respect needed for something like this. Heck it&#39;s a double standard but I don&#39;t think even I would be ok with him going for a month. (A week or two with the boys no problem but a month in thailand... nope).<br />  I thank my lucky stars for him every day and try my best to show him my appreciation for his support in every way I can. It&#39;s a beautiful gift he is giving me and I won&#39;t take his sacrifice lightly. <br />    I do worry what people will think when they meet me and see my wedding band but no spouse around. I hope I won&#39;t be judged to harshly. I&#39;m gonna miss him and kids like crazy but there is just something in me I can&#39;t explain that is telling me to go. And I&#39;m going. I can do this. I must.,Brandy L,2019-02-27T13:54:00Z,4

"@Olga Cherkasova had the time of my life. Him and kids were fine, I called every morning and video chatted with them all for a few min each night. Best choice I ever made for myself although I did have some people judge me for going alone and &quot;leaving my family&quot;. Screw them, moms are allowed a break from time to time too. And I ended up going for 6 weeks, did Vietnam, Cambodia. Thailand and a week in Australia. Did a stopover in Qatar for just 24 hrs so I could see the desert and eat and shop on way home. <br />Took just a backpack, even stayed at some hostels. Never felt lonely. I did feel old though compared to a lot of travelers there.",Brandy L,2020-08-18T20:05:34Z,0

"Yesss to all of this!!! My boyfriend and I are anthropologists so our schedules are rarely synched and luckily we&#39;ve alway supported the other&#39;s travel adventures. Just this fall I spent 3 months backpacking when he had to be doing fieldwork and while, sure, I missed him, it was also a life-changing experience that wouldn&#39;t have been the same with anyone else. I love traveling together as well but traveling alone is just a different kind of trip and both are such amazing experiences. Also, spending time apart is such a great way to remind yourself how much you love being with your partner! Or if you&#39;re not missing them, it also might be a good indicator that something needs to change.",Lauren Aida,2019-01-27T17:01:28Z,1
