Stop your mail.. easy to do online.<br />Tell your trust worthy neighbor you are away.. they&#39;ll keep an eye out.<br />I leave a flood light on in back,KK 66,2019-03-23T17:51:31Z,1
It may be good to keep your place safe from water damage by turning off water supply valves while on vacation.,Robyn Lawlor,2019-03-19T04:15:50Z,4
"Great ideas!  Thank you for the great video.  We ALWAYS lock the interior door from our garage....we&#39;ve heard of many cases in which people break into homes via the garage overnight even when owners are at home.  People seem to leave their car keys in standards places, so thieves are then able to steal the vehicles without the homeowners realizing until morning.   Rather than asking a neighbour to pick up our mail, we pay to have it held at the post office (can&#39;t always trust your neighbours!) and I haven&#39;t put an address on my luggage for about years - just an email address and my cell phone, so the airline can contact me for where I would like it sent (not always my home address, if I&#39;m on the road).  Another tip to add, if you do leave a car parked in your driveway, make sure you DON&quot;T leave a garage door opener for your garage in it.  It&#39;s easy for someone to break into your car and then have full access to your garage or even your house.  And we love our Arlo home security system - it gives us video view to our home and out our front door anytime and records anytime there is activity at the front door.",willwork4fashion100,2019-03-19T04:06:32Z,0

Great tips guys. Never thought about the garage one. Thanks,Raymond Dunkerley,2019-03-18T16:22:39Z,0
Great tips! #2 is a big one!!! So many people do this and it&#39;s just not a good idea... unless you have a security system of course! 😉,WorldWideWakleys,2019-03-18T16:18:58Z,0
"I do all those things while here, the window shades closed, no car in the driveway, etc. Lol. And I&#39;m pretty sure people think we aren&#39;t here based on some doorbell rings for nothing we&#39;ve got.",myopinions46,2019-03-18T15:48:09Z,0
