"wow I was expecting to see Caribbean Carnivals/Grenada Jouvert, Junkanoo, Caribana or Notting Hill Carnival at least once but that didnt happen.... 😕",Elijah Woolley,2019-07-16T05:46:48Z,0
U may be sharing these festivals because y&#39;all are open-minded and genuinely think these festivals are cool but calling them bizarre is kinda offensive. Please refrain from using such words because there is enough judgement towards other cultures anyways :),Aperaamy Loves,2019-04-16T18:48:24Z,0

This is so cool! I love festivals!❤️,Freckles On The Beach,2019-01-20T19:13:15Z,3
"@Kristen &amp; Siya it&#39;s located along side a river and there are 5 stages. It&#39;s a three-day festival and the entire day there are bands and artists playing music 😊 there are so many different music styles and also some unknown artists. What&#39;s fun is that everyone dances together and it&#39;s like a big family . There are also cool things like a silent disco and such. 😊 However, it&#39;s not dressed up or decorated as other festivals, but it think that has mainly to do with the small size of the area, and the large crowd. But is has such a nice and fun vibe to it😊",Freckles On The Beach,2019-01-20T19:48:43Z,0
What is appelpop like?!,Kristen & Siya,2019-01-20T19:39:03Z,1
"@Silvan Allard I&#39;ve been to Sziget 2 years ago and it was amazing! We also every year had a festival called appelpop in the town I grew up in. A lot of people from all over the Netherlands and Belgium came to it, because it was one of the few free festivals in the Netherlands. 😊",Freckles On The Beach,2019-01-20T19:17:29Z,0
