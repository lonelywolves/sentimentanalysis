"@Kristen &amp; Siya Yay, thanks for the link. We bought a new 2021 Surveyor Legend 19rble if you want to see. It&#39;s the only one we could really agree on together lol but it was a good investment even though we may not get to use it this season. The new ones coming are over $10,000 more. Eek. Plus we currently have a Buick Enclave that tows up to 4500 and this 23&#39; 4&quot; ft camper is 3749 dry so a little too close for comfort for me. Might take it local but we&#39;ll trade in Kev&#39;s car down the road for something that tows a lot more. We just towed a tiny trailer 5 hours home from Indiana but that&#39;s the extent of towing so we have a lot to learn. 😁",Newton's Travels - Her Grand Life,2020-07-22T14:32:43Z,0
