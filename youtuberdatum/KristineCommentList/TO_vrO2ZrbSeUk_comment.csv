LARQ is not that good. Get GRAYL bottles - they are much more effective &amp; purify water way more.,waddup,2020-01-17T11:05:41Z,0

"I hate getting sick while traveling!  I was lucky enough to not get seriously ill while I was on my travels over the years.  However, I do get scared of eating some street food in more unsanitary areas because of food borne illnesses. I&#39;ve had a few times when I ate something bad and got bad stomach aches and needed the bathroom constantly, which sucks when you can&#39;t find a restroom when you are out!",Sleepy Dreamers,2019-09-26T01:10:59Z,0

We need to learn how to not get sick while traveling full time. We&#39;ve been so sick! One thing we&#39;ve figured out is that we keep catching something at the swimming pool. I wish we could get enough sleep. That&#39;s what ran us to the ground. We just don&#39;t have enough time to get a full night&#39;s sleep. Thanks for the tips!,Kensho Quest,2019-09-25T16:57:30Z,3
Hopefully these tips help. They hace also helper me when traveling full time. I think its important specifically for full time travelers to take days off and get good sleep.,Kristen & Siya,2019-09-25T18:03:12Z,1
