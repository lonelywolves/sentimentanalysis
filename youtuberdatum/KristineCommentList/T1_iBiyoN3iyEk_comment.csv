"This looks great. One thing to look out for is weight. Old Airstreams were built to be as light as possible, all this wood is adding weight, and adding weight high up which shifts the centre of gravity of the trailer. For example, our kitchen the framework is all aluminum, specifically so that the weight is being kept down. I‚Äôd recommend driving to a scale to check if you‚Äôre still within limits.",Andreas Duess,2020-05-28T11:43:25Z,1
