"I was just talking to hubby about going there.  We are retired and I hear the healthcare is awesome.  We just have a lot holding us here right now.  We have rental homes, a beach property, a divorced son with 2 kids that rely on us a lot.  Our oldest son lives on the west coast with his family.  We travel out there with our Class A.  I hope you cover a lot of the property, the homes and the culture there.  HUGS~Donna",DWDinAtlanta,2020-12-18T07:59:51Z,0
