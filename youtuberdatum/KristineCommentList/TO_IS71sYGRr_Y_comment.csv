"Although, I myself am visually disabled, I could see the thoughts, activities   and the beautiful scenes of Hunza. Thanks to you both for portraying the soft and positive image of the country and the region. It was really amazing to watch the video of over 18 minutes (which sounded like a  video of lesser than five minutes for me). I enjoyed it a lot. Congratulations and most welcome, time and again, to Hunza valley. There are a lot of touristic sites within Gilgit-Baltistan Region and Pakistan but they need to be explored and exposed positively provided the native people also behave positively with the foreign tourists. Will keep in touch through email and exchange more on the subject matter. I myself am from gulmit (headquarters of Upper Hunza). You may visit my website (if you like to know about my activities  as a field researcher and anthropologist): www.fazalamin.com I&#39;ve also initiated my YouTube channel named &quot;Eagles World&quot; (Fazal Amin Beg) and kicked it off recently.
