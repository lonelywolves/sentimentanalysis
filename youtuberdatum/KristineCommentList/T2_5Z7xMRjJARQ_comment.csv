I really liked this video!!  <b>ESPECIALLY</b> while Siya was talking to himself and making stuff up as he went along while Kai is napping!  I laughed out loud with him and his humor!  Bored parent (while allowing Mom to go do what she wanted) having to entertain himself <b>AND</b> his viewing audience.  Made my night and I&#39;d love to see more of this side of Siya!  LOL  There are going to be some people (Lori M) that take offense to the words spoken.  Please ignore and continue to entertain.  If comedians can ... so can Siya!  Love you guys!!  Tfs!  Looking forward to the next one!!  ♥,MsShellMel,2020-10-27T06:31:36Z,1

So cute! I love watch your video! Hello from Russia.,Dmitriy Flexter,2020-10-27T04:43:26Z,0
"As an Anishinaabe person, I’m really disappointed and offended by Siya’s comments at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z7xMRjJARQ&amp;t=8m20s"">8:20</a> of the video.  He mocks a “Native” accent, which perpetuates colonial and discriminatory stereotypes of Indigenous peoples in Canada.  Not only that, but he surmises about what his “Native name” would be.  Names are sacred and connected to important ceremonies in many Indigenous Nations across Canada.  They are not simple descriptions of your appearance or personality.  Siya makes light, minimizes, and mocks important aspects of Indigenous Nations laws, protocols, and ceremonies.  I hope that you take this video down so as to not perpetuate your colonial and racist views. You two are influencers with public responsibilities, and have put forth to be inclusive caring people.  I hope you that you take this opportunity to learn and take responsibility for what you’ve done.",Lori Mishibinijima,2020-10-27T02:41:03Z,5
"I’m happy this comment was here because it didn’t sit right with me, either.  Partially the use of the word “native”, but Moreso the specific voice used when “imitating” a “native” person, the broken English used, and the mocking of the names. Particularly as non-Indigenous people we need to set an example, and actions don’t always speak louder than words  I am also happy to see Siya acknowledge this comment, and hope that something was learned. Thank you for your labour, Lori!",Kylie Lynne,2020-11-16T04:42:26Z,0
"@Kristen &amp; Siya Thank you for replying.  I did watch the entire video, as I firmly believe this is fairest way to develop an opinion.  Just because you share information on Indigenous fishing practices; it doesn’t insulate you from making oppressive choices in other areas.  I appreciate you taking the time to respond; I also feel like you’re focusing on your intentions and experience. Colonialism, oppression, and racism are actually about the IMPACT of your words and actions, NOT how YOU meant them. Also, proper apologies focus on the experience of the person who was wronged, and maybe even steps to improve future actions. But I appreciate the effort.",Lori Mishibinijima,2020-10-28T05:41:29Z,4
"Hey Lori,<br /><br />Siya here. I never intended to offend anyone and I appreciate the feedback. I was actually making fun of myself in the segment with the names I picked. We have a profound appreciation for native culture and traditions. We attended pow-wows, learned from natives, danced with them and have friends who are of different native tribes. There&#39;s so much of this video that showcases native land, words and culture. At the beginning of this segment I compliment the language and say they have such beautiful meanings behind their words. If you keep watching the video we highlight Ojibwe fishing methods and teach our audience a little bit about their culture.",Kristen & Siya,2020-10-27T13:05:05Z,1
