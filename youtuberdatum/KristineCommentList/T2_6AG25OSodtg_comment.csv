"I love the Chutes. Haven&#39;t watched your videos since your daughter&#39;s birth and now she&#39;s talking! Loved the video, it was like a tourist Ontario advertisement. Keep up the good work. If you&#39;re heading to Pancake bay I hope you&#39;ll continue to Sand River. That&#39;s our favourite place.",Patrice Wilde,2020-10-23T03:14:33Z,0
