I have the same machine. You wash it then put it in spinner. Then put back in washer part and put in water to rinse. I think you should have a lot more water then you did because it will burn out motor if clothes dont move easily in it. After the rinse cycle . put them back in spinner  Then you spin and  all the water. Is spun out of clothes. Then you hang them cause the so called dryer dont really dry the clothes. Only telling you this because i have the same machine. And it will shake and its loud sometimes. But all in all its great to do small loads of laundry.,Bonnie Goodsell,2020-07-07T18:13:19Z,0
Yes you will feel it. Thats not a dryer it spins out the water,Bonnie Goodsell,2020-07-07T18:08:15Z,0
"I had a washer like that in a house I was renting, and I found it pretty difficult to work with. It left my clothes feeling very stiff, and anything heavyweight would get mildewy before it could dry fully. I also felt like it was using way more water than a traditional machine to fully rinse the soap off. I hope it works out better for you though!",Katie Edwards,2020-07-07T18:00:44Z,1
I encourage you to run each load 2x through the drying cycle....really helps get more water out.,S Hess,2020-07-07T17:08:42Z,0
"To Rinse: you do the same thing but without detergent so it essentially rinses, by filling it back up and letting it run without added soap, then drain a second time and then put the close in the dryer.",Davidi 007,2020-07-07T13:23:20Z,2

"You may have figured it out already, but the left side is for washing when you fill it with water and add detergent. Then, you use the same side for rinsing the clothes by adding more water but no detergent.<br />After they&#39;re fully rinsed, put the clothes on the right side in the spin cycle to spin out most of the water.<br />I had one of those in my last apartment and it was GREAT to have! The hardest part for me was disposing of the gray water, but since you&#39;re using a detergent that is environmentally safe, you should be good anywhere!",Jacob Carlson,2020-07-05T21:07:19Z,0

I have a similar mini washer with spinner. I typically use 1/3 of the normal detergent for normal washers. Also if you want to make your clothes a little softer for air drying you can add two caps of distilled white vinegar when you wash. Always works for me. :) so excited for these new renovations and new journey for y‚Äôall‚Äôs family,Celestina Marie,2020-07-05T20:22:24Z,2

That be pretty incredible and also very possible (our friend Louis put one in his bus)! Maybe next time :p Atlas likes to sleep in our bed or right under us in that little space below the bed. We are getting him a custom bed made and also cutting another hole under our bed for him. He likes cozy &quot;den like&quot; spaces.,Kristen & Siya,2020-07-06T14:51:25Z,1

"Hey Kristen and Siya, we used to have a washing mashine with similar functions. After washing the clothes with detergent and water and draining them you will have to add more water and wash it a 2nd or a 3rd time depending upon the amount of detergent you have given. Once the cloths dont have a soapy feeling you can put them in the ‚Äòdryer ‚Äò to rinse out the excess water. Ours was a single tub one so i guess the process is almost the same. Hope it helps. Good luck.",Amrita D,2020-07-05T18:01:06Z,2

"From watching other travelers, it‚Äôs very annoying trying to wash inside the rig, use an extension cord and buckets of water as needed to fill the washer to wash outside. You‚Äôre right though, you put the clothes with soap in for the first cycle, then drain and turn to fill to fill with clean water and run a cycle, then drain and put into the spinner. If you want to use softener you‚Äôd rinse the clothes and then put softener in, drain. Then fill and rinse one more time before draining and putting into the spinner. I heard to leave the drain open when spinning, it helps get the clothing dryer.",rockerbaby2003,2020-07-05T15:44:13Z,2

"Yes, agree with the system described above! I have one in my apartment since we don‚Äôt have a washer/dryer and a have a little baby.
