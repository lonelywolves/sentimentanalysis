Yes bad things do happen in Mexico as well as many other countries. I hear of horrible things happening all over the world including my home home town. All we can do it recommend places based on our own personal experience and our own experience has been positive for all the places we mentioned in this video. Ultimately it&#39;s up to you where you decide to travel based on your research and how you feel.

"I‚Äôve had friends and family in Mexico witness drug cartels step into local buses with machine guns and one friend was kidnaped and pistol whipped while traveling in Mexico. As a Mexican I‚Äôd love to say Mexico is perfect and safe but it‚Äôs not. Even in once safe areas like the Rivera Maya, there have been increased levels of criminal activity related to drug cartels. When I was last there in 2017, there were 2 shootings during the 5 day period I was there. I talked with a few locals and everyone was telling me that they were once proud that the Rivera Maya area was one of the safest places in Mexico, now they are worried that the increasing violence in the area will discourage visitors and impact tourism which accounts for a huge chuck of the locals salary. Mexico is a beautiful place with rich culture and worth experiencing, unfortunately a few  bad guys ruined everything for the majority of kind, honest and good people of Mexico as well as for the tourists. I hope things do get better in Mexico soon, but for now I‚Äôd stay away from there. If you choose to go, my advice would be to be very safe. Stay at a reputable hotel, don‚Äôt use random taxis, and don‚Äôt talk much about where you live.",Kimberly H,2019-01-10T15:59:15Z,45
