"&#39;Way beautiful, and lots of fun I love the true interest you two (or 3 or 4) have where -ever you go. Makes the vids much more personal and lively! Good videography.",Amanda Wilcox,2020-07-28T21:13:11Z,0
"hey Kristen and Siya! i&#39;ve been watching this channel for years and i love the videos that you two put out. I know you guys touched on fur trading, the pow wow that happens yearly on Manitoulin Island, and Indigenous folks in the area in general, which i think is awesome. I don&#39;t mean to pressure you guys into working harder than you already do, just as a suggestion, I think it would be really interesting and just great in general if you guys gave Indigenous land acknowledgements wherever you&#39;re visiting. there are websites that I could link to you which make it really easy to find out which indigenous peoples lived/live where, and I think it could be educational for you guys and the viewers! I appreciated hearing you talk about your curiosity and your intentions to know more about the ways and hardships of the Indigenous people who live in Canada as somebody who lives here too. :)<br /><br />so much love from Toronto!!",bobbie drinks,2020-07-28T21:12:31Z,0

"I LOVE Siya&#39;s comment about how traveling with children is nice because of the sense of wonder that the trip takes on. This is so true! So many people want to travel before they have kids, and although it is more affordable to travel without them, it really takes on different meaning when you are teaching a young one what the world has to offer them as you travel. Too many people think it is difficult to travel with children, but it does not have to be. After traveling with my children if I had the choice to travel with them or without them I would choose to travel with them.",Travis Nilsson,2020-07-28T19:17:27Z,4
"@Amanda Wilcox My wife and I still have some years of travel to get under our belt since our kids are three years and three months, but the limited travel we have done has been the best for out three year old.",Travis Nilsson,2020-07-29T15:56:32Z,0
"@Amanda Bradley In a small way my parents did that with me. We lived in the state of Utah in the US, then moved to Georgia, (the us state...not the country Haha!) and even that change was culturally different enough that it changed my life.",Travis Nilsson,2020-07-29T15:54:20Z,0
So true.  we’ve travelled with our 3 boys since they were 8 months old. They’re now 16-14-13. 5 years ago we decided to leave home (Australia) and move to India with my husband’s job. What an adventure watching your children immerse themselves in another culture and learning new languages ❤️❤️,Amanda Bradley,2020-07-29T15:48:49Z,1
"Travis Nilsson, Great comment and point of view-the lived experience variety! <br />I travelled with my daughter before she was born, and from a toddler up to around 17. Oregon, Washington and California. Never boring!. 👣🙏🙋<br />Stay well &amp; curious.",Amanda Wilcox,2020-07-28T21:05:06Z,1

"Gorgeousness all around!     That&#39;s one of my bucket list spots.     For perfect accuracy, the words &quot;Fresh  water&quot; really need to be added to the title in describing the island  ..... either that, or you need to head to Greenland, which I understand truly is the world&#39;s largest island.      Snotty Vancouver Islander here (43rd largest island in the world, Canada&#39;s 11th largest island, and 2nd most populous in Canada, I learned).   lol.      I may not have learned ANY of those stats had you not left &quot;fresh water&quot; out of the title, though, so thanks for the learning opportunity.",iamsoaringeagle,2020-07-28T14:19:25Z,2
"@Kristen &amp; Siya Well it worked!    lol.   Lovely to see you on the road again.     Luna looks so splendid and well-loved in her new and improved evolution.     Siya ,I hope that you are comfortable after your surgery.      My ex was a silly man and had to make sure things still worked the same day as the surgery.     Not such a good idea (ached for days and days), but at least without the anxiety about whether things would still function.",iamsoaringeagle,2020-07-28T18:34:53Z,1
Thats exactly why we didnt put fresh water in the title ;) we&#39;ve also been to Greenland! Glad you enjoyed the video. It&#39;s been so so nice to be living on the road again,Kristen & Siya,2020-07-28T15:51:21Z,1
