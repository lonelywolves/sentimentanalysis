Selena has been yearning to go to Greenland and Iceland since she was a kid and learned about them in school. It&#39;s definitely a trip we&#39;re going to work on doing in the next couple years.,The City and Beyond,2019-12-09T21:56:29Z,0
Incredible! Greenland is one of the most unique and magical places we&#39;ve ever been. Iceland is paradise for nature buffs. Combining the two will be an experience that will be hard to beat. Not sure if you&#39;ve seen our Greenland series but we have about 5 videos from our trip there and more content on our websitr to help you plan your trip.,Kristen & Siya,2019-12-10T04:32:06Z,0

Looks beautiful 😍. What is the longest flight you’ve flown during pregnancy?hubby and  I plan to travel to Dubai in February for our 11th anniversary. The flight will be 14 hours long outside of 2 layovers. I will be 26 weeks pregnant. My Midwife gave me the thumbs up so as long as everything continues to go well with my pregnancy. What are your personal tips for flying that long and being as comfortable as possible? Beautiful baby girl btw😍,dee johnson,2019-12-08T22:12:50Z,0
