"“Road tripping with his penis chopped off” 😆, euh, I really hope you looked into your surgeon’s credentials, because if that’s what he told you is happening, RUN away, as far as you can 😆😱😆. That’s funny you mention the moss, because at the start of the video, that was the one thing that popped, and didn’t look natural to me. I’m so impressed with the al natural paint you’re using. Milk protein seems weird though. What kind of milk? I would love to do this once we downsize some more. “This is looking beautiful”...... funny, everything else is mentioned by its name, but not that one 😆. Sad that there’s still so many who don’t see what a positive plant this really is.",Annelies Joss,2020-07-30T16:03:14Z,0

"Kristen and Siya, the work you&#39;ve done on Luna is fabulous-a word I rarely use. I really appreciate listening to your processes and about your research, especially the natural paint. 🌈<br />I&#39;m looking forward to vids from your trip: Friday-Wow, you&#39;re already on the road! Cheers from western Oregon. Happy trails.",Amanda Wilcox,2020-07-17T19:47:24Z,0

"Just started watching but I wanted to ask before continuing, about the vasectomy! I heard you can reverse it after... But are you worried that it will affect Siya&#39;s hormonal health? My partner and I are thinking of doing that but we&#39;re so worried about his health!",holisticmaya,2020-07-13T22:10:05Z,0

"Luna looks amazing.      It does seem as though there are an awful lot of both decorative and functional objects that will need to be moved/stored away as you prepare for her to be mobile, so they don&#39;t get tossed around.     Or is there something I&#39;m missing somehow?",iamsoaringeagle,2020-07-12T21:22:53Z,0
"Most stuff will be secured and those that arent go in thr sink or the floor. We&#39;ve done a pack up video before so you can see what happens! Here u go: <a href=""https://youtu.be/KjtYvMJ-Sqo"">https://youtu.be/KjtYvMJ-Sqo</a>",Kristen & Siya,2020-07-12T22:10:48Z,0

Etsy is great for finding artists stuff but I know a lot of artists are moving away from it as the fees are making it unfeasible to use anymore,Alicia Elberts,2020-07-12T16:09:42Z,1
Good to know! I try and see if artists have a direct website first. Some only have etsy though.,Kristen & Siya,2020-07-12T16:25:29Z,1

How is paint natural? You used a name brand paint to paint the walls. It’s full of chemicals!,Stef TheArmyVet,2020-07-12T15:06:37Z,2
Kristen &amp; Siya you two did an awesome job! Thanks for the information and sharing! Never knew there was a natural paint! Luna looks fabulous!😁,Stef TheArmyVet,2020-07-12T18:23:37Z,0
They sell a non toxic VOC paint. Its their bath and spa line which is their green line. Milk paint is def better but at the time I wasnt thinking about these things. We are doing our best moving forward :),Kristen & Siya,2020-07-12T16:24:11Z,1
Kristen &amp; Siya your earlier videos. I saw a brand name paint that you mixed in with natural colors. When you first started painting. Does Benjamin Moore sell a natural paint?<br /><br />I did watch the video and kudos to using natural.,Stef TheArmyVet,2020-07-12T15:40:20Z,0
"And for the walls, that was done 3 years ago with zero VOC paint which is very important.",Kristen & Siya,2020-07-12T15:30:20Z,3
"??? Did you even watch the video? We used a company that makes the clay, limestone, chalk and casein mix and we added in pigment. Then we mixed it with water. Nothing unnatural or toxic.",Kristen & Siya,2020-07-12T15:26:48Z,3
Oh Hello hello good morning. Hey I&#39;ve missed you guys. So glad to see you getting ready for an other adventure. I&#39;ve never put much thought of all natural paints &amp; stains. I can see it to be important specially when it&#39;s such a small space. Baby spot turned out amazing and baby sure is so cute 💗 Nice garden too just beautiful :)) I wish you guys the best trip ahead &amp; perfect weather. Be safe.  and....I got to stay &amp; watch the whole procedure...what a awesome Dr. It was like cutting two white rubber bands. It didn&#39;t take long at all &amp; he didn&#39;t feel any pains ;)) 👍😃👋,Paivi Project,2020-07-12T15:00:55Z,1
@Kristen &amp; Siya Hihii I got to stay with him &amp; hold his hands while he got &quot;needled&quot; and I think the Dr. thought I would...you know run outta there heh hee I was little shaky legs but hell nooh I wanted to see and once they got ready to operate...no one never said I must now leave so heh hee I just stayed and kept holding his hand while having the best viewing of the action heh hee much fun :))),Paivi Project,2020-07-12T15:59:20Z,0

Kudos to your efforts ! Luna has great aesthetics. Baby Kai is super adorable love the way she speaks ♡ <br />Appreciate your organic lifestyle. The use of natural pigments and fresh produce at close proximity to airstream has left me in awe. Keep up the good work. CHEERS ☆,Kreena Balsekar,2020-07-12T14:01:09Z,5
