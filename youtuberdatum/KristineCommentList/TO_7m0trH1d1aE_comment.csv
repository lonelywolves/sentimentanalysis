"I try and make the trip to Gilgit-Baltistan at least once every year. The Besham to Chilas route is undoubtedly the worst drive ever. It&#39;s mostly fine between Besham to Dasu and as you approach Chilas but everything in between is a chaotic mess. I drove to and back on that road back in March/April and by the end of it, I had hemorrhoids. And my car has good suspension. It&#39;s just that the road is full of potholes and debris from landslides.<br /><br /><br />If anyone here is considering making this trip by road, please try and wait for the summer and wait until the road at Babusar Top is open (covered in ice/snow in the winter because of its high altitude). The Babusar route shaves off 6 hours and the road is just as pristine as the KKH after Raikot Bridge to the Chinese Border.<br /><br /><br />If you&#39;re traveling from Islamabad, the Besham route takes about 16-18 hours IF you leave around midnight and avoid the traffic in towns like Abbottabad and Naran.<br /><br /><br />With the Babusar route, you get to to Chilas in under 10 hours. If you have the strength, you can easily leg it all the way to Hunza (Karimabad) in under 13 hours.<br /><br /><br />Honestly you just want to save as much time as possible with this trip. Overnight stay in Besham or Chilas is pointless because there isn&#39;t much to see and do there. You can save a day or two on each end of your trip just by leaving at midnight from Islamabad and having your dinner the next day in Hunza (or Gilgit).",Mansoor Bashir,2019-06-17T05:39:39Z,0

"CPIC , yo bearded Person in the intro , you are a chotia  .     Tourism is boosted by two factors .     Infrastructure development  and by <br />encouraging the interests of the population  of a country to visit different parts of their own country for recreational activities and purposes .  Bringing in Londas  and chokries  from western countries and making cchhecchhooory videos and uploading them on YouTube and social media does not serve the purpose .           Also  , with out active participation and recruitment of the local community and indigenous people , nothing can be achieved .        These londa chokry videos cannot  create any sort of Soft Image of Pakistan  as different regions of the country are controlled and dominated by vario religious groups ,  and influences from middle eastern oil countries .    And above all ,   The best locations for Tourism infrastructure have already been Grabbed and taken over sand controlled by the ARMY of Pakistan 🇵🇰 for their own pleasures , purposes and property grabbing process of the Pakistani Army .
