"OMG this has been added to our bucket list!  We are moving to Nicaragua soon and we will need to do boarder runs, The Costa Rican boarder is only 45 minutes from our place in San Juan Del Sur.",Chris & Tovah's Amazing Adventures,2021-04-24T18:53:14Z,0
"Would you consider going to Rythmia Life Advancement Center in Guanacaste, Costa Rica and making a video for us? It&#39;s a resort with one week stays and I&#39;ve heard they have amazing spiritual thought leader guests there such as Taita Juanito. They have free bookings or discounts for influencers.",zenbeth,2021-04-20T01:21:00Z,1

It&#39;s like the example of putting on your own oxygen mask before others. You can&#39;t help or love or care for anyone else until you do it for yourself first. This place is beautiful 😍,The City and Beyond,2021-04-09T11:45:35Z,2
