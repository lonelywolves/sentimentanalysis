"It&#39;s a beautiful place and congrats!!  BUT ... do ALL your legal stuff on the land, then do it again AND again!  I had family that bought two plots of land there several years ago with plans to build a home on each.  Before that could happen, the man passed away.  His wife had to get a lawyer involved due to CR trying to take back the land.  It was never settled before she passed away as well.  Just DO YOUR HOMEWORK on if you really  will ever OWN that land for real!!  Thanks for this content and I look forward to lots more!!  :)",MsShellMel,2020-11-19T07:07:05Z,0

"I‚Äôm happy for your happiness guys but this is a bit disappointing. It‚Äôs because of gringos and foreigners like your group that buy land over here and increase the real state prices, that us locals can‚Äôt afford anything. People come looking for paradise while us local have to figure out what to do or stay in the parts of Costa Rica you don‚Äôt even care to visit. <br />I wish people would think more about this before running to create your own hippie villages. Just something to reflect on.<br />Anyway I wish your beautiful family all the happiness ‚ò∫Ô∏è",Rowie Knox,2020-11-18T22:35:19Z,13
"@Jeff C. Keane exactly!!! I know it‚Äôs not just them two, but there are half a million of expats (which is the American word for immigrant) in Costa Rica. What disappointed me is not that Kristen and Siya have that plan, that‚Äôs a great dream and I‚Äôm happy for them, is the fact that is a ‚Äúgroup of people‚Äù like she said. Is this kind of groups that buy all the land and increase the prices of the country.",Rowie Knox,2020-11-20T01:04:48Z,1
"I&#39;m not certain they plan to make that effect much larger than it would normally, It doesn&#39;t seem to me they are out to &quot;land speculate. It seems to me, they will improve some things rather than ruin.<br />I, myself , grew up in Massachsetts. New York speculators ran out of inexpensive properties they could plunder, so, just as I was moving to look for a house In my neighborhood, found the entire market literally &quot;bought up&quot; and now looking at triple pricing vs prior to that time. Over years it just kept getting worse, so We moved to Texas. By the time any good paying jobs came here, same thing happened. Couldn&#39;t even afford a mid-line Airstream to put on a piece of land (100k plus!) So, it takes more than one couple, bro!!",Jeff C. Keane,2020-11-20T00:54:28Z,0

"Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I can understand your view. The way I see it is we work online so we arent taking jobs away from anyone and also spending our very hard earned money within the country which is good for the economy. We speak Spanish and are excited to takr part in Costa Rican traditionals and customs. We will also be traveling around the country and sharing places to go see and things to do on our travel blog and other social channels, which supports tourism in the country. We are regenrating the land which used to be for cattle grazing and growing a food forest all around the place we will be building. Theres so much more to share and I look forward to doing so. And especially showing how wonderful the country I fell in love with 11 years ago is with everyone here.",Kristen & Siya,2020-11-19T00:05:51Z,7
"This mission sounds like just going into he Jungle, interrupting animals with their very own viruses etc and making money from fruits there is again a start up business for bigger factories to come............. so not sure how this is helpful",Îëê29 Duygu,2020-11-18T21:17:46Z,1
"They are working directly with indigenous communities who live in the jungle and are surrounded by these trees. These people who have grown up in the jungle aleady know the fruit, how to harvest them responsibly. Nothing is getting interupted. Instead this mission is empowering the jungle communities, giving them an income and stopping these parts of the jungle from being torn down, which yes would destroy homes and kill animals along with polute our planet. This is a solution not a problem.",Kristen & Siya,2020-11-18T21:47:53Z,1
