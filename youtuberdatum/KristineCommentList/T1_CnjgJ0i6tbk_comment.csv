You were so lucky! My sisters and I took the Meraviglia Cruise in December 2019 but there was a storm going to Cozumel and Ocean Cay was after. Cozumel was VERY windy and cloudy and MSC decided not to stop at Ocean Cay because of the weather. We were so sad we couldn&#39;t  experience the island! Sigh... But we&#39;re doing a family cruise this December and looking forward to go to Ocean Cay!!,Lillie,2020-03-12T15:18:31Z,0

i cant help but say ick...so canned...sure jobs...sure token environmental feel good efforts...but all offset by the impact of the ship itself...and the thousands on board...sorry,J F,2020-02-06T17:34:55Z,2
We&#39;re no experts but we could see how this company was taking steps towards being carbon neutral. Very little on board was a &quot;one-time&quot; use product. You can read the links in the description for more info.,Kristen & Siya,2020-02-06T19:58:03Z,0

"11 1 I do both, sometimes I hire a local tour guide so I don’t have to waste my time looking for places to go. Sometimes I do all the planning but I plan months before and I have everything organized from hotels, transportation, activities and flights before I go on vacation. This way I can do more things without stressing out. These are just a few techniques I use. I travel multiple countries a few times a year and I learn a lot each time😊",The Roses Adventures,2020-02-06T19:32:29Z,0
"Are you travelling for the joy of<br />travelling and the experiences.<br />Or only that you can count things<br />off your bucket list.  Slow down.<br />Become a minimalist, go for high<br />quality.  All the best.",11 1,2020-02-06T19:19:01Z,1
