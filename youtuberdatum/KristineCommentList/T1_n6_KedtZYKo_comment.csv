Very cool. Inspiring!,Marjie Cleveland,2020-04-05T22:34:39Z,1
This is sooooo inspiring! I am a minimalist already. (Live out of a backpack in the UK) But I am still working HARD to minimize my stuff. Because... it makes me so happy! 💃,Zoey Michael,2020-04-04T16:31:35Z,1
"@MultiUnknown2 No, that&#39;s it. My &#39;sentimental items&#39; are my tattoos on my body, my memories that I carry in my head and on pictures and my clothes. (Shirt from Malta, Jean&#39;s from Barcelona...) When I can&#39;t  use it I don&#39;t want it. 😉",Zoey Michael,2020-04-08T10:13:23Z,0
Zoey Michael so you don’t have anything stored at parents homes or storage that you forget/don’t count. Just wandering like all the stuff you accumulate growing up from sentimental items and holiday souvenirs ect,MultiUnknown2,2020-04-08T07:57:03Z,0
"@MultiUnknown2 I am a house sitter, so it is easy for me. 😉 But yes, all I own fits in a backpack. After a couple of years downsizing I finally managed to have only items that I really love. 😍",Zoey Michael,2020-04-08T06:28:45Z,0

"I LOVE what he said &quot;My goal is to live in a way that my actions are aligned with my beliefs. Where I can wake up every day feeling good about life&quot; <br /><br /><br />It&#39;s not about the items, it&#39;s about this.",Keaton Walker,2020-04-02T16:45:41Z,11
"LOL, Life goal, live like a Homeless Person? Oh, it&#39;[s April 1st. LOL",WeBeGood,2020-04-02T13:25:20Z,1
"@Rob Greenfield More power too you. We in today&#39;s society tend to think owning more things is good, when in fact all these things end up owning us.  Enjoy your adventure, sounds like fun.",WeBeGood,2020-04-10T18:38:14Z,0
"Hi there,<br />I understand where you are coming from, but I am not experiencing homelessness. This is a choice, so it&#39;s quite different from people who are in really difficult situations and are without a home, not by choice, but by circumstances they can&#39;t control or overcome.",Rob Greenfield,2020-04-03T11:08:49Z,2
I can’t believe it 🙈,petitesideofstyle,2020-04-02T06:44:40Z,2

"he forgot to mention the camera, battery, accessories, camera stand (presumably) that were filming him at the table with his stuff",D,2020-04-02T03:03:31Z,0
I didn&#39;t forget that of course. I don&#39;t own any of these items. I film when I&#39;m with people who have these items and who have a passion in producing videos and want to spread messages of sustainable living.,Rob Greenfield,2020-04-03T11:10:24Z,1
