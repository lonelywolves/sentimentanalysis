I’m new to your channel bro keep up the good work you motivate me,Dex Media,2021-04-22T03:23:36Z,0
I love you guys&#39; vlogs and don&#39;t understand why there isn&#39;t more views. IDK I think you guys should explicitly ask your views to subscribe and hit the bell notification..you rarely (if ever?) do that.. Just some feedback. Enjoying bingewatching the vlogs.,Candace S.,2021-01-05T05:38:06Z,0
