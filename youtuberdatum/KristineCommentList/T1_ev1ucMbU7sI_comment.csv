"You guys inspire me so much, just the way you’re living your life and the experiences you’re having. I so wish I could come to Costa Rica with you guys, the country is incredibly beautiful (I’ve been there and I LOVE it) but I can’t afford it right now, nor am I able to take the time off :c I so hope that you guys have a fantastic time.

WOW!!! I&#39;ve been following you for at least 6-7 years and what a beautiful life you&#39;ve created for yourselves and Kai :) I am so happy for you. I just love this kind of &quot;hippie community&quot; you talked about. Kai is so lucky to be born from you wonderful parents! I think the &quot;adventurous couples and families&quot; direction is perfect for you! I just love it and am very excited for your changes and improvements!

I can’t believe it’s been a year since your pregnancy and having Kai she is talking and getting so big. This year will be amazing for y’all.
