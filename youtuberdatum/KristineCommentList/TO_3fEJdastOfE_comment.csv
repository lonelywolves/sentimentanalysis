"Kristen &amp; Siya just bought a vanagon... no rust, low km... itâ€™s my dream van. (but it doesnâ€™t have a pop Top) but it does have a factory made interior with a double bed",Oscar Karais,2019-05-22T17:11:09Z,0
"In this case, if you were to use a loan, would you need to have the loan ready to go before you begin looking or would you need to have the vehicle picked out first?",Jessa Winter,2021-02-09T03:22:23Z,0

"You two are so fun! And so unique! Travel is hard for us, we live on a small hobby farm, BUT we&#39;re picking up a 1970 sovereign this weekend, so maybe there will be more travel in our future. You&#39;re definitely the inspiration for our planned renovation. And we&#39;re in Upstate NY, just a couple hours from Toronto, so I understand your winter struggles! -Jenn",Sunshine Farm,2019-08-08T17:49:14Z,1
"So helpful!!! I love your personality &amp; the way the info is presented.  By the way, you have great lighting, is it natural lighting or are you using a ring light? I will be traveling a lot so curious how I can film with the best lighting.",KALL ME LEO,2019-07-22T23:22:38Z,0

"I think the key information that she forgot to mention is that the budget is $40,000 CANADIAN and that&#39;s $29,767.40 American. I&#39;m new on this channel and I was caught off guard when I saw the name of my home town Burlington which is in Canada. I originally thought that $40,000 was American so I immediately concerted it to $53,750.00 Canadian.",Sebastian Tobiasz,2019-05-25T03:13:33Z,1

"Hey! Love the lifestyle but how do you sustain in terms of gas, food etc? I would love to take the road and travel! Thanks in advance",Kevintheproguy,2019-05-21T06:47:17Z,1
"Maybe it&#39;s good for a weekends... But if you think about longer trips, toilet, shower and something that can be used as working table is a must.",Panda Lu,2019-05-18T15:07:28Z,0
For sure. We chose to go with an Airstream which we pull with our F150. We renovated it to include a toilet and shower. It&#39;s like a little apartment with everything we need.,Kristen & Siya,2019-05-22T02:44:16Z,0

I just found your channel and I&#39;m OBSESSED!! You have such an amazing channel!! I also have a youtube channel where I post videos about my life in China! I would be soooo happy if you checked it outâ™¡,Hanna Johansson,2019-05-16T08:41:13Z,4

"won&#39;t a diesel vehicle be better, as it&#39;s much better on gas?",razz P,2019-05-16T00:47:54Z,0
That&#39;s a definite plus. But all depends on if it&#39;s good for a conversion.,Kristen & Siya,2019-05-16T14:30:39Z,0

Which ever one has a recliner for feeding.,Kristen & Siya,2019-05-16T14:31:12Z,1
Do you care for emission of CO2? If you think about the future of your baby it&#39;s definitly a con against the F150. What Do you think about that issue?,Joh Ge,2019-05-15T21:16:12Z,1
"It&#39;s all relative. Living in a tiny house/van/rv is a lot less impact on the environment than a big house that takes more materials for building, heating, cooling, maintenance etc. Plus then you&#39;d most likely have a vehicle anyways. Newer F-150s are way more fuel efficient than a 2007 tho.",Kristen & Siya,2019-05-16T14:36:26Z,0
Have yall sold the airstream haven&#39;t seen any videos since your little girl was born ðŸ˜˜,Dexter Williams,2019-05-15T21:05:30Z,0
@Kristen &amp; Siya I had wondered given youve been stationary for a while. Do you plan on getting back on the road in her later on?,Dexter Williams,2019-05-16T14:36:46Z,0

what about a bus? I want to convert a bus into a tiny house when I grow up. I would just have a van but I want a big family and that wouldn&#39;t work with a van. &lt;3,Closet Demon,2019-05-15T18:08:14Z,1
We know quite a few families living in a van or an Airstream like ours but a bus conversation is a great idea too!,Kristen & Siya,2019-05-15T18:21:59Z,1
That&#39;ll be nice travelling around in a camper ðŸ‘Œ,Millennial Travel Confessions,2019-05-15T16:22:13Z,6
