We had a baby in October and that&#39;s when we would leave and go somewhere warm with Luna. We wanted to be in Canada to have our babe and we cant live in Luna in winter so shes being stored right now. We will bring her back.out when the weather is warmer,Kristen & Siya,2019-02-04T20:38:22Z,0

Yummy. I&#39;ve never had tofu yet but it sure looked fantastic. I could totally just eat the whole mango 👌. Your meal looked fantastic. That is one great way to &quot;taste travel&quot; the world and cook great things at home. Your little baby is very beautiful. Siya has never looked better holding the baby like a...professional Dad 💗👋👍,Paivi Project,2019-02-03T17:01:04Z,1
