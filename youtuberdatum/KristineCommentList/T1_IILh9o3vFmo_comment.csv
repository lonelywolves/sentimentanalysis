"Who else is planning a road trip for this summer? Where are you going? We are planning to hit the road next month in Luna the Airstream, and we are SO excited!",Kristen & Siya,2020-06-14T13:24:55Z,5
I am!!! With a friend though. No more road trips with my family because they&#39;re boring. No disrespect but its the truth.,Danielle Rose,2020-06-14T15:28:15Z,1
There&#39;s a reason most witch doctors are evil. It&#39;s a lot easier to kill people with hocus pocus and no knowledge than it is to save them.<br /><br />🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,Question Mark,2020-12-10T13:22:30Z,1
"This shower requires water to be at least 115 degrees, did you have any issues achieving that? Also, Siya--how was the height on the Nebia in there for you? Thank you!",Melanie Gajevska,2020-09-08T19:58:41Z,0

"Love the wallpaper, the shower head, and the apothecary cabinet! Excellent! That cabinet would be too small for all my essential oils and carrier oils!",Marjie Cleveland,2020-06-14T17:26:56Z,4
Hahah ya I have a lot of oils too. The rest will have to go somewhere else.,Kristen & Siya,2020-06-14T19:25:55Z,1
"I feel like this is the first in a series in which Kristen begins her witchy transformation. Soon, faint chanting will be heard in the videos&#39; backgrounds, mysterious warts will appear, all to culminate in Kristen moving into a forest tree where she only speaks in her witch voice and throws pinecones at passersby. I&#39;m here for it. 😂",Lauren Aida,2020-06-14T14:54:03Z,1
Hahahahaha this is amazing and very possibly all true... ;),Kristen & Siya,2020-06-14T16:43:38Z,1
"Kristen &amp; Siya, you’re doing an amazing job on Luna!<br />I love the look of the new shower installation, it’s very sharp. <br />Finally, your potion cabinet...wow!  Such a great use of negative space and definitely adds a lot of storage!  <br />Oh wait....I forgot the wallpaper!  It’s so pretty and fits the decor perfectly!  <br />Thank you for taking us along on your facelift on Luna!<br />Have a great day!",Donna Earley,2020-06-14T14:39:37Z,4
We are so excited about all these new additions! We are also being very mindful of the companies we are purchasing from - focusing on smaller companies and getting only organic and natural materials as much as possible. I&#39;m even making my own paint....stay tuned for that one haha,Kristen & Siya,2020-06-14T14:46:08Z,3

So creative great job guys 👏🏼 Apparently sales of home sauna installations have gone through the roof here in Estonia during lockdown! 😆 🔒⬇️,Tide Knot Travellers,2020-06-14T13:11:04Z,3
Haha yeah &amp; a lot cheaper 😆,Tide Knot Travellers,2020-06-14T21:37:21Z,0
I&#39;ve seen that too. Could you image we put a sauna in Luna? ahah. You can also just sit in her on a really hot day with no AC. That will do the trick.,Kristen & Siya,2020-06-14T13:23:43Z,2
That looks perfect! Who says you can&#39;t have luxury in a van 😉👍,Brendan Explores,2020-06-14T13:08:14Z,9
