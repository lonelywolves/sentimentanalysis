"I&#39;m commenting on this a year too late -- I&#39;ve been packing a backpack in part of wanting to solo travel once restrictions are lifted in the country I want to go backpacking in (Norway). Although my backpack isn&#39;t completely zero waste (I&#39;m still bringing a few things like baby wipes just in case I can&#39;t take a shower for whatever reason), I&#39;m still proud that it&#39;s closer to low/zero waste!",Anna Nelson,2020-11-02T23:55:34Z,0

"I HIGLY recommend period pants! I have tried reusable pads but personally felt them being too loose and it didn&#39;t feel uncomfortable. With moon cup I tried too, as thats brilliant idea but it felt painful for me. I may retry some point, but I absolutely love period pants! I have set from Thinx and they are fantastic. I actually tried some bought from UK (I live in Scotland) but they were nowhere as comfy and snuggly as Thinx, so even the extra custom tax I need to pay and their cost being high I think they totally worth it. I have usually one day of super heavy flow and most times they are alright (the hiphuggers or boyfriend shorts) sometimes I would need to change during a day to another pair. But also I have had best and most relaxing period sleep with Thinx, never happened with pads or anything else. There is no leaks and they do not feel groos or wet at all. Absorbtion is great. They also don&#39;t smell, well period blood overall doesn&#39;t smell anyways. I have had my pairs now for few years and cannot imagine living without them. I have set which last me my whole period, so I also traveled with them in Nepal which was great. Then washed them in bathroom and left to dry. Also I would lastly add that most bleached tampons and pads have chemicals which often make period crumps worse. As your vagina will absorb it (skin is the larges organ afterall). So it helps with many things. But anyways if you like mooncup or reusable pads thats cool too, its totally personal.",Arleta BW,2020-08-15T14:36:24Z,0

"I&#39;ve never seen a travel blender like that - I assume you can only do smoothies in it? I just wanted to share that I just recently learned that the bamboo utensils and straws etc are treated with formaldehyde - and they apparently rot fast - so glad I didn&#39;t buy a bamboo spork now (I so wanted one for the longest time). Thanks so much for sharing all these tips! I think I&#39;ve pretty much made all those swaps you shared. Your enthusiasm is great and I hope everyone starts to realise that it&#39;s not a big deal to just use cloths for all the cleaning and wiping up chores that live brings and washing a couple extra things isn&#39;t a big deal. At the end of the day, it&#39;s just about making healthier choices because every healthier so we make for us all by extension always be healthier for the planet too.

"I am so enthralled to be talking to you right now. As I am sure you know the world is in great peril and I was wondering if you wanted to be part of the solution.  <br />The enzyme comes from a bacteria, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, which was discovered in 2016 by Japanese researchers, who subsequently found that it could completely break down a thin layer of low-quality plastic within six weeks. Structural biologist John McGeehan and his team have now taken that enzyme and genetically engineered it so that it can begin the process in a matter of days. That kind of discovery is cause for excitement: It takes centuries for polyester, scientifically known as polyethylene terephthalate or PET, to degrade naturally.<br />Waxworms- The secret was in the worms‚Äô ability to break down beeswax, which contains some of the same chemical bonds found in polyethylene. Since then, researchers have been working to harness the enzymes found in their digestive system in hopes that it can degrade the millions of tons of plastic in our landfills and oceans. Exactly how remains hazy, though one idea that‚Äôs been floated is to spray the piles of trash in the ocean with the bacteria or the enzyme, and let them do their work.",brianna mcmahon,2019-09-14T20:12:43Z,0

"Great video. I think it&#39;s awesome that you made a video about this. I am very interessted in Zero Wast and already did a some changes that both reduce waste and also saved me a lot of money already. The best one is actuelly to start drinking tap water. I always take a glass bottle filled with tap water to work and even at home I nearly only drink tap water. It&#39;s way less expensive, more convinient and better for the health of both the enviorment and me.<br />Besides that I am also using soap and shampoo bars since quite a while now and I am really happy with them.

"I agree that it is completely overwhelming to use the term zero waste and for me to attempt to be a zero-waste er!!!  I guess I&#39;m going to strive to be a low-waste person. For years I&#39;ve recycled as much as I can, been using reusable bottles, and have bought loads of reusable grocery bags.  All of these I have been doing for years and years. However I have to get a lot better at remembering my reusable bags in the trunk of the car and remembering to bring them into non grocery stores when I shop at those. <br /><br />Last year I switch to Bamboo to brushes! I stopped buying any kind of plastic food storage containers.  I have bought several pretty ceramic bowls that come with plastic tops with vents for the microwave because I also swap them for usable decor, and in the future will probably buy a few glass food storage containers. I also bought wool dryer balls to replace the nuby plastic dryer balls I&#39;ve been using for years since I stopped using dryer sheets.<br /><br />And soon I will be purchasing some reusable straws in stainless steel, silicone, and a few pretty glass ones. These are for when I eat out in a restaurant or grab something at a drive-thru. I don&#39;t use straws at home that often except for the straws that come in my reusable decorative plastic cups I bought years ago. Now I use double wall metal reusable  bottles.  I am also going to purchase cloth napkins to use at home and to have one in the car and one in my purse along with a set of silverware from home for when I am out and about.",Renee Robinson,2019-04-24T05:54:45Z,0

"Once I put my nose to the grindstone to consciously recycle, it was eye-opening.  I fill a full-size trash can of my recycling materials and my weekly trash is 1/3 to 1/2 of a bathroom-size trashcan.  I pack my Lexan camp silverware (which you can have on a plane), chopsticks, a steel straw and a cleaning brush, and I roll it in a dishtowel that I use as a placemat, along with 2 microfiber washcloths to use as napkins along with my bento.  I also have stainless steel water bottles, a Britta bottle and pitcher, a Bobble, and because I&#39;m going to Cuba in 4 weeks I have invested in an Eco Vessel which removes 99.9% of parasites.  I also fix tea in my full-size stainless steel thermos so I&#39;m only using the energy once even though I drink tea all day long.<br /><br />I use a vacuum sealer with my mason jars and they work SO WELL, [scary confession] that I was cleaning out my fridge last week and found a pint jar in the back on the bottom that had been overlooked with cottage cheese in it... if I handed it to you you&#39;d think that I just put it in the jar yesterday...but I bought it 8 months ago and there is literally nothing wrong with it.  No, I didn&#39;t eat it because I know when I bought it, but still, a Food Saver with the mason jar attachments is definitely the way to go.  <br /><br />Cloth pads, menstrual cup, towels instead of paper towels, and I use one color of washcloth as napkins, and then I have white ones to use instead of toilet paper.  I make my own laundry detergent...  In fact, I was planning a blog piece on this exact thing for later this week.  <br /><br />Am I one of those crazy-prepper, homesteading, off the grid people?  No.  I&#39;m on disability and am in a constant cycle of having too much month left at the end of my money.  I save hundreds of dollars by investing in these items once and using them virtually forever. <br /><br />Congratulations on your new baby.  I can&#39;t wait to see how your videos morph over time when you start traveling with her!  I&#39;ve gotten some really great info out of your videos, thank you for sharing your knowledge with the rest of us, it is very appreciated.  {{{hugs from the lower 48}}}",Maggie of House Valera,2019-04-21T22:23:05Z,0

"I love your videos! But this one made me so happy! I just started experimenting with a low waste lifestyle, from your list I am a proud user of the reusable water bottle, the menstrual cup, the bamboo brush and the backpack. I am loving them and they make me so happy as well as the thaught of not creating waste. Also, I thought I mention it, maybe it helps someone: shampoo and conditioner bars are a great alternative, but since January I haven&#39;t used any shampoo on my hair.  My ultimate goal is to only wash my hair with water, but until that happens: I mix 2 egg yolks and  1 tablespoon of coffe grounds (used ones). Sometimes I also put a tablespoon of honey in it, for some shine. But I basically wash my hair with this mixture and my hair is even more pretty as it was with shampooing and it has a lighter feeling to it. And you can get eggs and honey or coffe grounds in a ton of places! Plus, if its just a short trip, you might not even need it. I used to wash my hair every 2 days and tried basically everything to make my hair better but nothing helped. With this mixture I wash my hair every 14 days or so. It does wonders! <br /><br />So all in all, thank you for this video, it was really useful, I&#39;ll try other products as well! üòäüëäüèª",Zs√≥fia Nagy,2019-04-21T21:24:46Z,1

"So so much. I refill our cleaning products such hand soap for kitchen or washing up liquid in local bulk store. Same with shampoo or body wash unless we buy them in bars too. Handsoap in bars for bathroom. Period underwear (Thinx is fantastic), reusable makeup pads, coconut oil for everything I can (hemoroids, lub, makeup remover, frying), soapnuts for washing clothes, essential oil for scent (room or washing etc), make our own plant based milk, cows milk buy in glass bottles and return, whenever possible buy food with no plastic packaging (bulk shops for dry stuff, butcher, fishmonger, cheesmonger and grow my own veg a lot) - we still get stuff packed in palstic, that&#39;s hard to avoid but doing as much as humanly possible. Also bamboo thootbrush, compostible floos, safety razor (the oldschool reusable ones), whatever else we try to buy usually metal tins or glass containers as these can be recycled more then once as opposed to plastic which if it gets lucky can be recycled once only. We also have travle cus we go around with, spork always in my bag, some snacks (usually nuts and apple) and of course reusable water bottle. This took few year thou. Started with cosmetics for balancing my hormones, then cleaning products which helped with skin sensitivities etc, and then it keeps spilling into our life. We also have Ground Source Heat Pump which uses ground to heat our water and house, electric car and solar panels.<br /><br /> Its amazing thats so many people think more about what they can do, every little thing helps and counts. We all make a difference. Thanks for great video.",Arleta BW,2020-08-15T14:49:15Z,0
