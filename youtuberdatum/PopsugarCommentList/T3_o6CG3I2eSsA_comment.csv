"I liked the workout but I found the exercises too fast, very hard to follow and to complete the series, we cannot pause the video while we are on the floor with weights... Even if I know the style of Jake DuPree I still find it very annoying when he counts wrong. The two girls in the video could laugh at it but it is not so funny, he can start counting from 20 instead of 10 avoiding this silly joke. This is my feedback as Popsugar attached fan, other instructors do not do that.",Nicola Tre.,2021-02-16T20:13:48Z,0
