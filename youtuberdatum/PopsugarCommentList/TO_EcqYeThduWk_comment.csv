"so... what is the proper name of that exercise that you say it is like a dance but that you cannot say it in front of the camera? btw, I do this one + 6 more videos every single day almost since the beginning of the quarantine! I vary them, of course, but I have my favo ones! Around 3h of work outs without breaks or very short ones",Tania Delicia,2020-05-02T17:35:29Z,0

"so the workout is fun....but his inability to count to the beat of the music is horrendous, especially when he says it will be in 8 counts from the beginning of the video. As someone who danced, and taught dance her whole life, the ability to count to 8 is a necessity, and the majority of this workout is not done to an 8 count, which is disappointing if trying to follow the beat and keep a consistent tempo.",Ahleah Balawender,2020-04-11T18:37:40Z,0

"so I did the 30 min hip-hop dance work out  <a href=""https://youtu.be/ZWk19OVon2k"">https://youtu.be/ZWk19OVon2k</a> for like 4-5 days to get back to the good work out routine (which truly, take a pandemic for me to push myself to work out everyday again...) and found that it&#39;s a tad easy now and decide to move up a notch. So this became my work out for today. Have to say I sweated a lot and have to pause 2 times in between. But it felt amazing afterwards! This guy energy is super positive and the routine surely did not make me feel like dying. Aiming to do this work out in the next 7 days to see if I can master this work out level by that time.",Giang Than,2020-04-05T16:32:49Z,0

"This video just popped up in my feed. I had no intention of doing a workout at this moment, but after WATCHING the first 5 minutes, I decided I should do it RIGHT NOW!  I&#39;m 58 years old, menopausal, overweight, and out of shape. I usually would steer away from these kinds of workouts because I am SOOOOO a beginner again.  And starting over has been difficult. But his infectious personality made me WANT to do this. The modifications were PERFECT for me... although I still have a hard time with burpees...but I did do some with the modifications, and when I couldn&#39;t...I SHUFFLED it out. <br /><br />It was definitely fun and I&#39;m sweating like a sinner in church!  <br /><br />Pop Sugar, PLEEEEEEEZE post MORE of him!!!!  ❤❤❤❤❤",Francesca Baker-Martin,2020-02-21T21:20:22Z,17

"@BlameItOnVanity I am aware. My original point was that it is not fair to assume someone&#39;s sexual orientation merely by their lexicon. There is no such thing as &quot;looking gay&quot; or &quot;talking gay&quot;.

I don’t normally like dancey workouts but do love boxing ones. This was just the right combination. I didn’t find the dance moves too difficult and I actually had fun. Joseph is the most amazing instructor. What energy! He’s so fun and the girls doing it with him looked like they were enjoying it just as much. This will be a firm favourite from now if I can ever cool down and dry off that is 💦🤛🏼💪🏼🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 please give us more from Jospeh 🥰🤞🏻,Janet Brooks,2019-05-15T14:47:06Z,92

It depends on the person,Danniiee M,2019-07-28T08:54:55Z,0
I think only 300 or less. This looks like a 10 calorie/min workout. They stop too often and have too many moves that dont raise the heartrate too high.,eveningbreeze,2019-05-15T12:55:09Z,3
I would bet between 450 and 600,Lum,2019-05-14T23:54:41Z,0
This looks intense but doable. I might try it with some modifications for those of us who still have weight to lose.🤭,Hustle Harder Mommy,2019-05-14T23:38:20Z,25
