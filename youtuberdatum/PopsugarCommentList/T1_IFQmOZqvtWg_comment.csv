When they say they&#39;re gonna tone the whole body, they weren&#39;t kidding! You will feel the burn all over. What&#39;s good is it also has the warm up and cool down already included.

"I&#39;ve chosen a bunch of workouts to do daily, this is my third... and I hated it! 😭 I hate workouts that use the most awkward, convoluted moves to work muscles. Exercising is hard enough, no need to make it even less appealing. The side ab one in here is actually painful! I did Massy Arias&#39; one yesterday, and worked so much harder with simpler moves. I could focus on pushing without encumbrances. I love that you guys are doing these, and I guess there&#39;s something for everyone, but I just had to air my frustration. Having previews at the beginning, like someone suggested, would be good too. I&#39;ll keep trying new ones! Thanks &amp; stay safe! 🙏🏻❤️",lenadahling,2020-04-19T20:18:11Z,4

"here is my review: I am advanced, I&#39; used to hard cardio and weight lifting. I found this workout reasonably challenging but definitely not the hardest on this channel. The cardio busts were very short but effective, my heart was pumping for a minute or two afterward. The first 15 minutes is definitely leg and quad heavy. There is a short but rather effective arm section is the middle. The butt bridge part was way too short for me, especially without weights or resistance band I didn&#39;t feel anything. However, if you are a beginner or intermediate, you might feel the burn. It can be helped with weights and band but again, the time is so short that I find it pointless to bring ou my equipment for those 2 minutes.<br />The ab section is overwhelmingly oblique focused, and that is alright, I feel it burning in my sides but it wasn&#39;t particularly challenging. There are virtually no water breaks or time wasted talking and demonstrating between the moves, which I appreciate, but it gives a very fast pace to this workout in particular. Overall, it is not too challenging but a fun workout for advanced, a reasonably challenging for intermediate and rather hard for beginners.",Tímea Time,2020-03-30T07:02:22Z,21
