"I know Anna fakes the burn. I love that about her. When I first started on my journey, it made me felt welcome when I was struggling. Now that I’m stronger, I realize Anna is truly humble. I like Astrid as well but seriously, why act so pretentious?! Anna is strong,  don’t act like she doesn’t know this is “popsugar fitness”. She should of got the hint and encourage Anna so that the viewers who are doing beginners will hear the encouragements. Anyways, Astrid is no doubt an awesome trainer!

"I used to love this channel, but then I saw them promoting Goop on Instagram 😬 wtf",AlcideIzMine,2020-02-06T16:05:32Z,1
"AlcideIzMine oh those poor people who can’t use their better judgment and discretion 🙄<br /><br />There’s bigger things to be concerned about than this, in my little opinion 🤷🏼‍♀️",Kelsey C,2020-02-11T19:58:37Z,1
@Kelsey C Nope. But lying just to sell junk to sick people desperate to cure themselves is wrong. It&#39;s also illegal. Hence the lawsuits.<br /><br />Eta: lying about the contents of a product is also extremely dangerous. And claiming product can &quot;cure&quot; depression is also dangerous.,AlcideIzMine,2020-02-11T18:42:48Z,5
"AlcideIzMine well people are going to try what they want, no one is forcing it on them 🤷🏼‍♀️",Kelsey C,2020-02-11T17:50:13Z,0
"@Kelsey CThanks for asking! Pseudoscience that prays on either desperate or naive people with exuberant prices, manipulation tactics and empty promises. Their lawsuits &amp; allegations of unsafe products are disturbing as well (i.e. vitamins targeted at pregnant or ttc women containing unsafe amounts of certain ingredients). Making claims that products can &quot;cure&quot; depression. Lying about what their products contain. Products that can cause harm (i.e. internal use vagina eggs made out of porous jade). <br /><br />I don&#39;t like seeing people desperate to cure their conditions paying large amounts of money for products that at best don&#39;t work, and at worst can physically harm them. <br /><br />Google &quot;Goop lawsuits&quot; or &quot;Goop contreversy.&quot; If you Google about the recent drop in Netflix subscribers over their Goop Labs show you&#39;ll also get articles about the specific lawsuits, settlements &amp; other contreversies.",AlcideIzMine,2020-02-11T10:29:20Z,3
