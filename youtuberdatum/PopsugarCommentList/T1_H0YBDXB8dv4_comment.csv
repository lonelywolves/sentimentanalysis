As an ex dancer I loved this! The moves are taught quick but you go through the cycles at least twice so it gives you a chance to perfect things. I’ve done this twice now and I have everything pretty much down.

I usually love POPSUGAR’s videos but this one was terrible. I’m fast paced fan and I found this one to be fast paced in all the wrong ways. No clear instructions into the transitioning exercises so I started to do my own thing while the video was playing in the background.

I LOVE Pop Sugar videos but this wasn&#39;t my favorite. I&#39;ve danced my entire life but still found this one hard to follow.

WARM UP before doing this exercise. Katia basically jumps straight into it. It is a lot of jumping so you could injure yourself quite easily if you don&#39;t warm up prior to starting this workout.,Catherine de M,2020-01-21T01:27:23Z,227
@Samhita Ankala thats too bad hope you felt better with just a little rest and nothing major..,Shibil Dey,2021-02-17T13:28:27Z,0

"Yeah! And rmb to bend yr knee slightly when jumping and landing, it&#39;s like a prepare for take off",hui ya,2020-12-03T09:01:16Z,0

"Good advice, unfortunately I didn’t see it before, now I can’t sleep because the inside part of my right leg is hurting a lot 😩",Re T,2020-08-11T02:23:31Z,4
"This was hard purely because I’ve never done fast paced dance workouts. At first I was like I’m not getting a workout what so ever bc I was behind but I just went my own speed &amp; did what she did 2 counts behind her. And kept jumping the entire time. THAT GOT MY HEART RATE UP! It was good to get out of my comfort zone &amp; see what my body could do. Even though I was lost most of the time, my body burned 300 calories in 20 mins. It wasn’t a loss👍🏽👍🏽",Christina Vasquez,2020-01-21T01:17:11Z,2

"Ladies, its phenomenally fantastic and I&#39;m goina have a darned good try, but when ya got 85lbs of extra bady weight. There ain&#39;t no such thing as light and not hearing your body coming down.  What goes up has gotten come down and believe me it does.  I actually applauded myself when I run 😖 it ain&#39;t a pretty sight seeing a 63yr old fat lady run or dance 😂 but I&#39;m goina cos I love dancing.
