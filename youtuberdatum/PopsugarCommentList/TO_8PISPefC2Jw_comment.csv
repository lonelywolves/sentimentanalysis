"Such a waste of time. This is not cardio at all. No rythm, no cordination in the moves nor with the music. <br />For people looking for a real cardio class and calories burn, DO NOT DO THIS VIDEO, you will get no real workout done and surely you will feel frustrated at end because you will feel you did nothing and wasted your time.",Sofia SC,2020-04-19T10:20:21Z,1

"Your positive talk and excellent coaching are so great in this video!  The music in the first half is super weird 70s flute music, but other than that awkwardness, I actually got the choreography this time so thank you!  It did help me feel better, if only for my anxiety.  I&#39;ll stick to your other workouts for the cardio and strength training.  Thank you!",Becky Clegg,2019-12-09T16:42:47Z,2

"Maybe it&#39;s just me but I found that one a bit odd. Strange music and moves with a lot of slow parts, and then having to run to get a mat for like 3 mins of abs randomly in the middle. These girls make it look good but it certainly didn&#39;t look good when I did it and nor was it much of a workout sadly.",Alexandra Panico,2019-12-09T12:14:06Z,59
you quit too early. this is a KILLER workout,flyperson1,2020-10-03T22:53:34Z,0

I think this is more for people who dont workout much and want to move a little bit. I wouldnt do this to lose weight or gain muscle,Enn Vee,2020-03-31T20:04:57Z,1
Yeah I felt the pace in the first half was kind of slow and then BAM I got hit with the 5 minutes of crunches LOL,Ko Ko,2020-03-31T01:39:57Z,2
