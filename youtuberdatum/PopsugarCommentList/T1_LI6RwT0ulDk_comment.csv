"&quot;Your way of expressing these concepts always attracts me, and nothing, but nothing compares with it-- the tone, the depth of spirituality, I can&#39;t put it into words. Your Manifesting Manual is something I can read over and over and soak up. I am in process of making the routine a solid part of my life, and it has made a difference! I LOVE your 12 meditations too ==&gt; <a href=""http://long.af/xiuxrn"">long.af/xiuxrn</a> I know I am a different person after 9 months with Super Manifestor, and in process of continued positive change! You deserve accolades every day of the year! Keep on with everything, and as we say in Spanish, &quot;ANIMO!&quot; Lots of love and every blessing to you both.&quot;",charlotte george,2021-02-02T13:05:36Z,41

"Really great exercise, but the ads every 5 minutes are really disturbing, especially for this kind of practice. I know this is the business model when you make &quot;free content&quot;, but it is actually not worth it in this case. I would do this regularly and recommend it to others of the ads weren&#39;t there or if it was limited to one before and one after the video.

"Popsugar needs to do further research into the yoga community&#39;s definition of &#39;restorative.&quot;  Restorative is a defined style using blocks bolsters with longer passive poses, not just a description of a gentle class. Please rename this video.",Kim Latford,2020-04-10T13:17:36Z,1
"Yes, more of a gentle yoga class inspired by restorative yoga. Perhaps they were trying to provide something that people at home could do with no yoga props and no need to gather substitutions. A chance to enjoy the calm.",newclee,2020-04-11T14:31:55Z,0
