Hi Marnie!  It has been one year since I left my gym and have struggled EVERYDAY to get started w/o at home. Today I found you!  I completed your video. ( Not gracefully lol but still it was so so good). I have looked at literally hundreds of w/o online over these 12 months. YOU Marnie got me moving.   Thank you. I have saved this workout and will repeat it over the next few days and I will be finding more of your videos. I cannot express how much better I feel even tho it is only the first. Thank you Marnie! Thank you!,Carrol Last,2020-10-28T19:20:24Z,27

"Hi from Spain Marnie! <br />Finding your workout videos during the confinement and enjoying them has been the only positive thing this 2020 has brought me and I wanted to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Many days working out with you has kept me sane. I really struggle at the moment and just knowing that everyday I can get stronger with you makes it all a little easier.<br /><br />Thank you so much also for your beautiful words of encouragement and support, for being a light in a really dark time. When I hear you say &quot;breathe in&quot; I swear, I breathe better.<br />May the Universe and all that is benevolent keep you safe and blessed. Thank you so much.",Isabel Ortiz-Ca√±avate,2020-12-30T19:19:37Z,1

Chloe Marcellino Thankyou so much.,Esha Naveed,2020-11-02T10:47:16Z,0
Sounds crazy but maybe give yourself I bit of time off from working out so much. It could just be a couple of days but you will give your body time to rest. When you are fatigued your actual exertion is a lot lower than you think. Also maybe switch up your routine. If you are doing lots of cardio maybe incorporate more residence and strength training. It burns just as much fat and calories but helps to build muscle which boost metabolism and weight loss. Also you could have hit a plateau if you are strength training as you are now putting on muscle which weighs more than fat. I hope this helps you,Chloe Marcellino,2020-11-01T11:14:47Z,0
