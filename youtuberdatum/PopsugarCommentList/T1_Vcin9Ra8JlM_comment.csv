"Love this, <br />These videos fit perfectly for my hectic schedule. I like to do a 15 minute video like this early in the day and one at night (whenever I actually can get to the second one).<br />When I can, It makes a full 1/2 hour for the day, which I feel gives me even better benefit that doing a long session once a day. Keep up the good work  !!",Your Next Body,2020-01-26T15:31:02Z,3

"This is a complete body workout. They even do southpaw and orthodox stances. If it is to short for you. Replay it as many times as you want. That is what I do.
