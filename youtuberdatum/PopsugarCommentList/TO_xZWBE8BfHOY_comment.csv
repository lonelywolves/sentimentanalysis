really liked astrid but thought the actual workout was quite slow and abit boring.  Definately quite for beginners,Patricia Stimpson,2020-07-17T14:12:59Z,0
Brilliant stretch. It&#39;s a really nice workout especially after a long day  👌💪<br />Love Astrid  🌈,Andra Maguire,2020-05-22T17:32:59Z,0
"One of my favourite workouts by far! It was so nice to slow it down, but also have really a really intense core workout.",Sue Blanchard,2020-05-15T23:58:25Z,0
"This workout is perfect for beginners or for a very light workout day.  This does not parallel the instructor&#39;s other Popsugar workouts, which are awesome sweat-drenching, heart rate skyrocketing videos.",cy chiyu Cheung,2020-04-30T06:41:57Z,0

Really enjoyed this one - nothing too difficult in terms of moves but still feel that burn throughout depending on how much resistance you give yourself and how slow you do the moves!,Holly Williams,2020-04-07T07:11:24Z,0

why do you continue to allow your guests to have the worst technique?.... In the beginning of the video she was doing a plank and it was seriously such a poor example of a plank.... Then beginners follow and do it wrong.... Did you watch the video ????  Her plank was terrible ! Her back was rounded and her hips were higher than her shoulders... It was brutal.,Stevie,2019-11-11T16:29:17Z,0

Way too slow and boring.,Catlady,2019-11-07T18:42:39Z,0
"This workout is perfect for beginners or for a very light workout day.  This does not parallel the instructor&#39;s other Popsugar workouts, which are awesome sweat-drenching, heart rate skyrocketing videos.  This one is a much slower pace with few reps and only two or three moves that spike the heart rate.  Regardless, I am very pleased to see Popsugar bring back the weight workout videos (please post more and revert back to the videos of a few years ago)! I agree with a previous comment that it&#39;s good to see something other than a dance video.",K SS,2019-11-07T12:30:43Z,13

I wish we didn’t live in a world where people post videos like this with disposable plastic water bottles in. There is absolutely no need to exercise with a disposable water bottle when you could reduce waste by reusing one.<br /><br />It just shows that the people in this video do not care or realise how bad that is.,Natalie L,2019-11-03T22:10:05Z,4
"I don’t even think they drank from them (I just scanned the video to see if it’s something I want to do tomorrow). They may have been props put there?  I agree, though, less plastic is good for many reasons. I love my reusable stainless steel water bottle.",DawnRK,2019-11-07T04:47:36Z,0
