Wow this was the worst workout from pop sugar. So disappointed. 1. Where was the hip??? None at all. A joke. The workout was barley a work out or HIIT at that... none of the moves really got my heart rate up like that so I really had to advanced the moves. By in NO MEANS AM I ADVANCED when it comes to working out. So that‚Äôs really saying something.,Nishaa S,2021-03-30T20:37:34Z,0

"@Michaelle Pierre-Antoine It&#39;s hard to tell really because before working out with pop sugar, I worked out with exercise dvds or many years.  I do think it keeps me in decent shape...just fyi I&#39;m almost 58 and I can get through most of these workouts, although I sometimes go more slowly than the people on screen, or do the modified version.  I think it definitely keeps me in good cardio shape, and the workouts with weights keep me strong. I don&#39;t belong to a gym because I want to save both time and money.

these are getting irritating... time to find a new site....  Sorry but I want a work out not get hip hop moves. And this is not HIIT... Not even close... Not one of the girls even broke a sweat... This is LOW IMPACT... You shouldn&#39;t mislead and call things that they are not....,Stevie,2019-09-10T19:54:40Z,2
@Bethany Davis  I can see and they are NOT sweating.  All I&#39;m saying is HITT would make you sweat so they should not call it that.,Stevie,2019-09-16T06:26:07Z,0
"Maybe you should look closer. Because, I saw that they were sweating. I was sweating. For those of us who are easing into exercising more, this is a perfect workout. Sure, it&#39;s not exactly HIIT, but dance is an AMAZING way to work out. And, hip hop is perfect for plus size people who want to lose weight. HH is great for all body types, which is why they are doing so many videos of it. Find a new site instead of complaining. These videos may not help you, but they are helping other people.",Bethany Davis,2019-09-14T17:17:07Z,0
"A lot of ppl are saying this is not HIIT but for some ppl it is. For people who are trying to lose weight and are pushing themselves, this might be more intense for them than some others. I‚Äôve dropped 41 pounds doing HIIT workouts and This is by far my favorite because it works the core which is my main target. I‚Äôm trying to work on my shape but I‚Äôm not very light on my feet. So I don‚Äôt like the HIIT workouts that have a lot of jumping or are just all over the place if that makes sense. This was also very fun.",Emily Michelakis,2019-09-10T18:09:04Z,201

"To me it&#39;s being ever attached to who you were born to be, and evolving to your best version, never limiting yourself to one thing, but be prismatic and free. To live here in the moment, and make the most of it before it fleets out of reach, living your life for yourself only. I make sure I am always my own top priority, and I believe that&#39;s the opposite of what most called selfish; to me it&#39;s self respect",Rye Videlle,2019-09-08T17:35:24Z,6

Nice workout but this was not HIIT for me at all. More like LIIT.,eveningbreeze,2019-09-08T16:47:59Z,107
"Yes, I found myself speeding up the moves, adding extra jumps and whatnot which in turn let me know that this isn&#39;t the HIIT workout for me.",lejalamorena,2020-10-16T07:09:57Z,0
@eveningbreeze as a newbie this was definitely hiit. i am in a ball of sweat here and i feel so good! everyone is dofferent :),Ann Curley,2020-06-01T18:58:01Z,2
@Dora M√ºller there wasn&#39;t much high intensity in this at all. Especially when compared to most other workouts labeled as such.,eveningbreeze,2019-09-12T12:41:24Z,3

How many calories does this burn?,Lucinda Vasconcelos,2019-09-08T16:09:48Z,2
@Lucinda Vasconcelos that sounds about right. Good strength intervals imo.,eveningbreeze,2019-09-09T18:45:35Z,0
@eveningbreeze Yeah I know and I have one. Just wanted to have an idea. I burned 154kcal and I&#39;m like 104 pounds and 5&#39;2,Lucinda Vasconcelos,2019-09-08T18:36:35Z,1
"It varies by person and effort. You may want to get a hr monitor to determine your personal calorie burn during workouts. I should add, I dont see many moves that are super intense so the calorie burn wouldn&#39;t ve super high.",eveningbreeze,2019-09-08T16:46:11Z,0
