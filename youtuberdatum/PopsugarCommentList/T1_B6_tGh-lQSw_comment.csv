Your plié form is a bit dangerous. Could cause ankle rolling and injury for anyone watching who&#39;s not done them before. Other wise good workout!!,Amy Deacon,2020-07-23T11:56:33Z,0

My first barre class and I loved it! I can&#39;t do or keep up with a lot of the POPSUGAR videos but I actually kept up with you on this one (for the most part)! I feel good about it considering I haven&#39;t been a regular workout person at 71! Thank you! Linda,Linda,2020-05-24T14:17:50Z,14

I have a question. Can PopSugar Fitness be also for men as well?,Michael Ewing,2020-05-23T17:22:45Z,4
Why can&#39;t this workout be for men?,Quinn Cartwright,2020-05-25T07:11:38Z,0
I&#39;d assume so.  There are some instructors who are also men on this fitness page.,Tisha Sievers,2020-05-24T11:45:52Z,0
