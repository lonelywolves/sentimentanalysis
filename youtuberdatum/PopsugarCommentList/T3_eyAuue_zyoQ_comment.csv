"This is a great add-on workout, you can do it by itself and as you build up strength and endurance, you can add a walk after or more strength training. Really a great workout, it worked the major muscles and more core was engaged the whole time!",Elise Craven,2021-05-05T15:02:03Z,0

"😅 No matter how hard you train, if your diet is poor you probably won&#39;t make any significant progress. You can&#39;t out-train a bad diet and I can&#39;t emphasize this enough.

How heavy are these weights??🏋️‍♀️🏋️‍♀️,Thelca Arendsen,2021-04-04T16:13:28Z,3
Yes! We&#39;d recommend a medium set which could be anywhere from 5-10lbs. We recommend listening to your body and using the amount of weights that allows you to maintain proper form.,POPSUGAR Fitness,2021-04-05T16:22:01Z,1
@BrokeButBourgie thanks!,P. G.,2021-04-05T02:35:03Z,0
They look about 8lbs which is probably considered medium weight for her. Beginners usually start with 5 lbs as a medium weights,BrokeButBourgie,2021-04-05T02:26:46Z,0
