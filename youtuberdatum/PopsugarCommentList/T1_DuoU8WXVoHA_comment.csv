"Guys i&#39;m really confused.  The app doesn&#39;t have some of the workouts that are on YouTube (like Jeanette Jenkins&#39; 500 calories in 45 mins, one of my all time favs).  I would love to pay for this thing but not when it has less than what&#39;s available for free.  Can someone help me make sense of this??  Thanks PopSugar!",Sol,2020-04-12T18:25:14Z,0
