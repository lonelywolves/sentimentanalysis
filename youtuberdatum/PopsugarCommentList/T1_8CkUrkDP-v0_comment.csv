"If you are here to learn how to box or kickbox, this workout is not for you. This is definitely not beginner level. She doesn&#39;t really teach you form or how the move works. She goes super fast and doesn&#39;t give you the time or the teaching to learn the moves. I do wish she would have gone over more form instead of talking about random things. If you&#39;re already advanced enough or if you like this style, go for it! But this workout is not for me at all.",Carissa Pennington,2021-02-20T22:41:37Z,0
"Christa your kickboxing exercises are so amazing...I usually wear a fitbit and track my heart rate while exercising. But when I do your videos, I forget to keep track and by the time I am done, I realise I have burnt way more calories  than I imagined because it all looked so fun and easy. Today when I did this video, it was so strange, as I was repeating after you towards the end &quot;I am strong&quot; and other affirmations, I felt so overwhelmed and tears cam eout of my eyes for no reason. I guess we all have those days when we feel vulnerable. Thank you.",Shweta Thampan,2021-02-20T04:44:59Z,0

"I would classify this as an &quot;advanced&quot; kickboxing workout.  As Christa dives right into the workout with a shorter warm-up, this workout can be a little frustrating for beginners who have not been introduced to the four core punches of boxing.  I have done Christa&#39;s other Popsugar Fitness classes, and have managed to master those ones, but this one I find to be more fast-paced with shorter demo times.  So if you haven&#39;t done any of Christa&#39;s classes before, do the longer workouts where she takes more time to demo the moves before attempting this one.",Yvonne Tsui,2020-06-10T22:29:42Z,0

@Ifunanya Anikamadu That&#39;s true. Tbh I end up adding extra intensity to the dance workouts wherever I can. (For instance doing star jumps instead of jumping jacks) It makes for a more HIIT- like workout. I&#39;d recommend trying that on days where you feel like dancing but also want to satisfy that part of your mind that says it wants to get a &quot;Great workout&quot;.,Maya Tanner,2020-03-09T22:08:55Z,1
