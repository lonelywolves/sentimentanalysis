"Hi Charlee, I really like your workouts specifically all the little cues and hints you give throughout each move for us to make sure we execute them correctly. All your exercises are group muscles targeted and well combined in terms of the body area to strenghten. When I workout with you I know I am doing the exercises right in the most effective manner. You are the best!!👏👏👍💖",Michelle B,2021-03-18T20:20:51Z,2
