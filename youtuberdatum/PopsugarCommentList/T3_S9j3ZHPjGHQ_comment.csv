"Lol this is the perfect dance workout for people like me ... who can&#39;t actually dance and have no rhythm 🤣 For me, this devolved into just jumping and flailing not to the beat. But it was so great for getting a short workout in and feeling better. I think this is also a good warmup for people with more intense exercise routines.",Allison C,2021-03-14T03:06:02Z,0
Meagan is so great at breaking down the moves! I&#39;m never frustrated with the choreo and I can just focus on getting through the burn! Love her attitude too! More Meagan and more dance HIIT please!!,Harley Olivia,2021-03-13T16:37:01Z,3
