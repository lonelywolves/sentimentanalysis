Awesome tabata workout!  Feel so energized,E Hosmanek,2020-09-28T15:49:28Z,0
The difference between a good class and a great class for me is how the instructor provides guidance and tips on form and muscle group. You are an amazing instructor!,Dana .W,2021-05-07T16:17:33Z,0

Just finshed and loved! But seriously ads are too many!!!! Hated those interruptions!,Bea Events,2020-12-03T04:49:45Z,1

"Great work out, but pretty annoying comments about doing a full push up. I know you are just trying to motivate folks, but I am a size I in the chest and have carpal tunnel in my wrists. So in answering your question about when I will do a full push up, it’s never and I am okay with that. I do have killer form though!",Stephanie Grover,2020-10-11T13:57:32Z,0

Fantastic. I liked the form prompts. Many pop sugar videos have women that have excessive chatter. It takes away from the work out. Your amount of speech was perfect!,Cia Parker,2020-09-24T20:09:59Z,1
