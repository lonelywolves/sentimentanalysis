I love Christa&#39;s workouts. Kickboxing is by far my favorite way to relieve stress and stay fit. She makes it fun every time. Her workouts are always killer and mentally stimulating. Thanks PS and Christa,Kara Hunter,2020-09-29T23:11:10Z,57

"I don’t know who will see this but PLEASE have more ABOVE the belt Christa/boxing workouts!! I have three degenerative discs in my lower back so I can no longer safely do KICKboxing....I can only do stationary/no-kick boxing. I love Christa’s workouts (thank you Christa!!) but I cannot do half of them because they are kick-based. PopSugar I would gladly love more traditional boxing workouts from either Christa or Deja or anyone. Thank you so much for providing quality, free workouts during the pandemic.

"Thanks so much! <br />In June I decided to do more sport, so I did those Christa -workouts, I reduced suggar (already veggy since 20+years) and ate not more than 1200 kcal /d except when I worked out.

It helped me to count calories, this way I was more aware what was bad for my body and where the so called hidden calories were hiding ;)<br />I wish you the best!
