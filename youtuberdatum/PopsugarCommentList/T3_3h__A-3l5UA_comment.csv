I start most of my days with Charlee. Great workout and great results. <br /><br />The Under the Fence exercise makes me nervous...bending AND twisting at my age makes my back a bit ouchy. Any alternatives?,E Hyatt,2021-04-24T12:31:13Z,0

"That&#39;s the second workout I do with Charlee and I have the same problem: I can&#39;t hear when she starts, finishes or switch sides of a movement. If I don&#39;t look at the screen the whole time I miss it. I don&#39;t if it&#39;s because the way she talks ou of it&#39;s the video edition. Did anyone feel the same?",Patricia Bento Rosa,2021-04-16T11:06:39Z,0

"This was a good workout - though one thing that was tricky is how quick some of the transitions are, to the point some are even jumpcuts to the next move. I felt like I had to keep pausing, or even going back a couple of seconds to get the full movement in. I would rather the video be a minute or two longer to accommodate a smoother transition between moves.",Rachel Jane,2021-03-17T20:31:44Z,0
This was a good workout for strength! I&#39;m sweating a bit and feel like we really did hit the whole body. And I learned really good form techniques for exercises I have been doing for several months. Great trainer. :),Barbara Quaye,2021-03-16T14:44:47Z,1

"That was perfect! My work schedule changed drastically so trying to get to the gym, get ready for the next day, &amp; get enough sleep wasn&#39;t happening. Working out in a small carpeted space doing cardio or dance is challenging. I also did the empowerment workout &amp; loved it too.. I was sore which I did not expect..Love the focus on the abs.
