"Hello there guys, I have this situation that I dont want to call it a problem because it is not that important but, when I go to gym 5 days a week, I firstly ride bike for 45 min with max-moderate resistance, which kills my legs. And then I do 2 or 3 of your workouts and which kills me more and then I swim for 30 mins and yet I dont lose weight. Well, my primary objection is to stay fit and healthy but losing weight would do too. Im 150 pounds (69 kg) and 5&#39;7&#39;&#39; (175 cm) and I approximately take 1800 cals a day. Shouldnt I be losing weight? Am I going too hard on myself? Because I get really like REALLY tired when I get back from gym. What do you suggest guys?",Deniz Özdemir,2019-02-15T20:03:08Z,1
"maybe if you change exercises, the body gets used to a routine and you burn less. With the amount of exercise i see you do, maybe it&#39;s a metabolic issue so i&#39;d recommend to visit a doctor just in case. Exercising that much and decreasing the cals could make you feel too tired and not productive during the day, specially seeing that you have a healthy body mass index. So my recommendation would be to change your routine often, watch the quality of the food you eat (i think the quantity of cals is correct) and if nothing changes, consider visiting a doctor to take a look at your endocrine system. :)",maria,2019-03-12T16:06:23Z,0

I think I left my heart back in the first video I did. Oh my gosh. I&#39;m just beginning after about 20 years of doing nothing. Holy cow. Thank you so much for the beginner videos. I paced myself and I now need to go change my t-shirt and dry my hair. I&#39;ll be back to master the 2 I watched and get toner and stronger. This is hard work for a 61 year old grandma way out of shape. Climbing stairs wears me out. I&#39;ll get there.,Michelle Burke,2019-02-10T19:22:51Z,15
