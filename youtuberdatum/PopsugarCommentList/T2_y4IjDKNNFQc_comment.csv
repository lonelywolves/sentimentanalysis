"This isn’t a 30 minute HIIT workout, it’s 15 minutes at best and the intensity isn’t very high. I think the title is a little misleading.<br />It would be great if Deja could introduce the next exercise before, because there is no transition time. I would also have appreciated some guidance on form.",Emily Cawse,2020-11-25T18:41:29Z,0
