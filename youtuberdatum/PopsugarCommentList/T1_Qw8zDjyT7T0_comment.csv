I love Justin and Taylor! Idk why a lot of people are complaining about the teaching. I know a lot of trainers who would stop doing the exercise to walk around class to see if the exercise is performed correctly. He does that here showing what Taylor does right. And there also are other workouts of the two on popsugar where he doesn&#39;t stop working out while teaching the class. For me I guess there really isn&#39;t a problem... I love how the low impact protects my joints and this workout really pushes me. My fav workout is the 45min with foam rolling though - so amazing!,Strawberry Island,2021-04-06T11:06:00Z,0

"For someone who always does high intensity workouts, I was surprised at how high my heart rate got with this! I don&#39;t know why some people have complained about his teaching style as I much prefer his approach than the other classes on here where some of the instructors talk too much, over explain, show too many slow examples and ultimately waste my time.",Lisa Leath,2021-02-01T08:22:33Z,0

I did not like how he counted down while yelling. I also have watched a lot of pop sugar fitness and the instructors do it all with you. He stopped during every exercise to catch his breath which did not make me feel motivated.,Elizabeth Sipe,2020-10-20T12:37:22Z,2

They have great workout routines get a good sweat and workout every time. I just wish Justin can tone down the yelling and the inspirational talk. I understand he has to motivate people to keep going but some of his inspirational talk is way too long. Becomes distracting and annoying after awhile or if he goes on a long motivational speech. Keep it short and less frequent and just focus on the workout. And Taylor is awesome kills it every time. People usually like when a trainer works out with them together rather than on breaks and talking frequently.,Christine Chang,2020-09-27T18:47:33Z,0

I&#39;ve done this workout four times so far, and each time, I&#39;m drenched in sweat afterward, but I feel accomplished!  Personally, I think the motivation and the trainer&#39;s high energy are great.  It&#39;s really inspirational, especially when he says &quot;you can do anything you put your mind to.&quot;  My late grandmother used to say that to me all the time.

"I agree with several of the previous comments. However, I would like to provide some constructive feedback:<br /><br />- There is nothing wrong with the workout itself. The variety is good and I can replicated it at home.<br />- The intensity of his encouragements is fine. Some people need that extra &quot;oomf!&quot; factor to help with motivation.But what seems to be less appealing, but the combination of poor sound (maybe  he had to compensate) and a tendency to &quot;over-encourage&quot; with clich√© sentences such as &quot;You can do it, you are beautiful&quot;. It seems un-natural and distracting.<br /><br />Compared to the other Popsugar videos, it looks &quot;homemande&quot;. With a cleaner sound, maybe some better video editing,  and more strategic motivating comments, it would be a great video workout.",D.R. Seuss,2020-08-14T14:31:48Z,1
