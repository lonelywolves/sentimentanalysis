I didn&#39;t like this video for two reasons. <br /><br />1) I understand you need  venue but why is the ad cut in the middle of a set twice!  and not during a water break? It&#39;s like stopping in the middle of what you are  That was pretty bad <br /><br />2) that curly hair woman announced she hated abs and then wouldn&#39;t sit down during the abs. She didn&#39;t do that for legs. It Was distracting and felt like she didn&#39;t want to do the exercise.  want to do an exercise with someone who announces that they hate the exercise and then walks around for it.,Michelle,2021-05-03T00:26:13Z,0

"I thought the workout was effective but a little too low impact, had to modify with heavier weights. Personally it really unmotivated me when Katrina admitted she’s not an ab person, walks around and only partially does the routine, should have had Karina lead. I feel empowered when I can keep up with the trainer or when a trainer does an entire rep without breaking away and I’m trying to be as strong.",NeonHologram666,2019-06-11T06:15:37Z,1
"This workout is perfect in length and intensity! I have been so sore from lower body HIIT workouts and these moves stretched me out :) Also, I absolutely love Katrina calling Karena, &quot;statuesque.&quot; I am 5&#39;10 and tend to feel like a towering giant, which leads to not so body-positive thoughts. I am going to make statuesque a positive intention from now on.",Asherlynn252,2019-06-11T02:59:38Z,41
"You have no idea how blessed you are.  I&#39;m 5&#39;2&quot;, and I&#39;ve always wanted to be taller like the rest of my siblings.

I used to love K&amp;K and religiously followed them and bought into their nutrition plan. But now they&#39;ve moved all their workout content to their Studio App. 😪 What happened to TIU Tuesdays on YouTube?! Sad times. Unless you had the studio app the Bikini Series (not called that this year) wasn&#39;t worth it. I was gutted! 😔 Thank You Popsugar for continuing to make great content available to everyone 😍😍😍,loopy lolli,2019-06-10T05:26:20Z,4
