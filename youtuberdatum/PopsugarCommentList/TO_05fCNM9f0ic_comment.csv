This was not too easy as some other comments suggested, I upped the ante to fit my needs which they even suggest, my HR got up to 168 and when I put the form tips to use, I actually learned a lot too!

I&#39;ve been switching between a couple of cardio lessons as this one and a yoga lesson, all from youtube, no equipment needed. I have dropped weight and have never looked more toned. This morning, I repeated the last set two extra times, just because I felt like pushing more, my strength is definitely building. It has become such a routine that I&#39;m actually looking forward to it and exercising begins to come naturally as a morning routine together with some headspace.

Also, do not be fooled, the first couple of circuits may seem easy to do but what really gets you are the last two. Much more challenging than it looks, if you give it your all.

Does anyone know the estimated calories burnt for this workout?,Jessica Stanton,2019-07-25T17:58:56Z,0
That will all depend on the individual and if the person is doing the exercises correctly and to the desired intensity level. I find that most people do the moves but not to the intensity or form of the proper athletes. So that will have a huge bearing on calories burned. My advice would be to push to your limits and do everything properly every time and you will soon gain the benefits. Calorie counting in training is a lost cause.,Von Trap,2019-07-26T12:58:21Z,0

"Good workout, but way too repetitive. Especially since the description says to repeat the circuit 3 times, but it is in fact done 4 times. I much prefer no repeat workouts or longer circuits with maybe repeating just 1 time. Thanks!",Hanz Armz,2019-05-18T16:54:53Z,6

"This is a great workout! Quick tip for beginners though: I would strongly recommend using Popsugar’s other video “15 minute beginner cardio workout” before this one. Yes, you can do this one first and still be okay after a while, but I found this one way more manageable after doing the 15 minute one for a while. I was a beginner when I started using that video and even though it probably took me longer than others, I’ve gotten very far. So, if you don’t mind going a little slower in terms of fitness progress, I would definitely say it’s worth it to do the 15 minute one first. It makes this one feel almost enjoyable! And I didn’t find myself in total agony after one workout 😂",Meira Wooldridge,2019-05-12T21:37:20Z,0
