Exercising always made me feel so good and happy but during quarantine I’ve become so self conscious and now exercising feels like an obligation, but this workout was so much fun to do and made me feel like I used to before. So positive and I loved how he was counting so I knew how many reps are left. Great job and thank you for making me feel good! :)",Hey It's Fotini,2020-05-18T19:05:59Z,71

Maybe it was the fact that he kept saying booty too many times or something else along those lines. I felt cardio was lacking a bit and I was really pushing myself hard. This workout just did not sit well with me. I think that I will stick to other instructors for future exercises in POPSUGAR Fitness.

hey! popsugar fitness.i have been watching and doing some of your cardio workouts for some time now.But after the workout I feel very Nauseated and uncomfortable. Am i doing something wrong with the work out?,Jane Doe,2020-05-18T04:58:05Z,2
"I&#39;m not an expert, but this has happened to me in the past. You usually feel nauseous if you eat or drink too close before a work out or if the intensity of the work out was too high at the time. I say at the time because it varies, you can do the same work out 5 times and have the intensity be too high for 1 or 2 of them, based on whether you&#39;ve fasted, how much sleep etc.<br />If you feel nauseous, slow it down and pace around slowly. I find stopping exercise completely can make the nausea worse. I hope that helps :)",Ann Le,2020-05-19T22:56:27Z,0
