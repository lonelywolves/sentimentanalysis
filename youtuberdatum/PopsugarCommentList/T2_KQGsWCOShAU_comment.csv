This is completely ridiculous - there are like 5 or 6 commercials in a 30 min yoga practice?! Will not be doing this one again. Terrible Popsugar!!,Zo√´ Church,2021-03-29T05:59:49Z,0
Feedback to prompt the poses you transition to more frequently. I had to look up quite a bit to check what we were up to which compromised the poses and the flow. Left pretty unsatisfied.,E C,2021-03-21T08:07:12Z,1

"I loved this class and the combination of poses! I wished you&#39;d finished it with savasana, I found it the best part of the practice (not just because I&#39;m lying down, lol). Anyway, I really found some awareness and peace, thank you so much Ania and PS for having her! ‚ù§Ô∏è",TheSupersizzina,2021-01-28T00:10:05Z,0

"Thank you Anita, what a beautiful series of flow! Felt amazing in my body. <br /><br />@Popsugar if I may suggest that for some poses, the instructor face the camera so that we can more easily follow the movements. <br /><br />It works great for exercise videos to talk through the movements, but for the flow of yoga it often works best if the voice is recorded after making it seamless to follow without needing to always keep an eye on the screen.",Silondile Jali,2020-12-31T06:48:39Z,0

"This was a very relaxing class, lots of good stretches, very little flow. I didn&#39;t find it energizing. I would recommend it more as a calming class than as a workout.",smoothliminal,2020-12-18T15:30:49Z,3

"In my opinion this was not a vinyasa flow class, too slow in the rythm of speaking and much more in the change of movement, there was no flow at all. Anyway, thanks Ania for doing your best, I guess you were very nervous. :):)",REBECA Rodr√≠guez Pascual,2020-12-09T20:37:47Z,0

"The amount of ads in this video was simply ridiculous. I completely understand the need for ads, it&#39;s a free cass plus get that coin! But in the middle of a yoga class? In the middle of a position that needs concentration? Hell no. I truly loved this class, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll come back because of the crazy amount of ads. Please, just add them at the beginning, after the intro and end, but please not in the middle!",Mariajos√© M,2020-12-09T03:28:13Z,2

"This would be so great, but every  seconds there are ads.  Come on, its bad enough with strength, but during a Yoga practice.  I&#39;m so disappointed.  I used to love love love your channel, but there are too many interruptions now.  I am so sad.  I love the concept of this 2 week workout though.",Judy Pignatelli,2020-12-02T12:33:13Z,1

Warning: there were no less than four ad interruptions in the first 10 minutes. It was so disruptive that I didn&#39;t finish.
