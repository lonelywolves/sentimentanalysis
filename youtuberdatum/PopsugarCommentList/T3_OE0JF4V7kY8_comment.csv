"This part, though!!!<br /><br />&quot;Take a moment to understand different ways you can show up for yourself. Is there any way that you&#39;re avoiding things in your life or holding off on things because you&#39;re waiting for an ideal version of yourself to magically appear? If that&#39;s the case, think about one thing you can take from this practice that&#39;s going to help you show up for yourself and appreciate every version of yourself that shows up. No matter what journey you&#39;re on, every version you wake up as is equally deserving of celebration and admiration.&quot;",Linnea Meredith,2021-03-13T23:19:25Z,5

"Yoga and meditation is still a very healthy thing for someone to do despite it not being exclusively for weight loss. And she is moving her body. Any time you take time to move your body you are burning calories and doing something good for yourself. Besides, not everyone has the goal of losing weight. So stop shaming people for doing something good for their body just because this isn&#39;t what <b>you</b> would do.",Sophie Seim,2021-03-13T16:58:18Z,4
