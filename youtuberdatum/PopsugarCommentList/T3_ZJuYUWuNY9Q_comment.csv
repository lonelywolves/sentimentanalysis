"She said low impact, my body definitely felt the impact. I also pulled a muscle. Great workout.",Folakemi Adeyemo,2021-05-03T17:59:14Z,0

"Bravo, finally! A very good video which explains the motion/execution of the exercises step by step and not in a rush. This is a very good example of true low impact exercises which are excellent for beginners/re-starters to slowly start/re-start with exercising without overdoing it and suffer from sore muscles ht e next day! I know what I‘m talking about because I have over 20 years of experience with all sorts of gym exercises and now I gained a lot of weight because of the pandemic. I tried so many times to workout @ home and down loaded so many video from youtube by now which I tried to follow but I almost gave up because most videos are overwhelming a starter/re-starter because exercises are to difficult to execute or simply overwhelming and the next day my entire  body was aching. This is the right „portion“ of challenge a bod y needs to get used (again) to workout on a regular basis without suffering from muscle soreness the next day which leads in most cases to that people give up right a way. Keep it up, I‘d like more to see please! Thank you.",Regine Kreysing,2021-05-01T09:00:16Z,1

"What do you recommend when it’s been awhile since you’ve worked out? I had a baby in December 2019 and I haven’t really got back into working out; because it’s been so long, I’m not sure where to start. Thanks for your videos ❤️",Natalie Norris,2021-04-29T16:21:37Z,0
