@Deja Riley I have been in the fitness field since the mid 80&#39;s- please head over to Ashford Fitness Society on fb-I know safety. . . . .  and fitness- when a person&#39;s heart rate is elevated you do not go diving down- or bring your head below the chest. . . respectfully yours- &amp; don&#39;t ask me about math or geography:),Ellen Diane,2019-10-16T09:56:04Z,0

"I just recently discovered your channel and I have to say I am truly enjoying it! Please keep the videos coming. Like a lot of women, I have struggled with weight loss over the years. I would lose weight only to gain it all back again. It was a yo yo system for me and I was getting very frustrated trying to lose weight. I have recently discovered a new program which I would like to share. It has helped me lose weight and it has boosted my self-esteem a lot. I am currently down 25 pounds and still going strong.  I hope it helps others as well. It can be found here: <a href=""https://mmini.me/dropweightFAST"">https://mmini.me/dropweightFAST</a>. I plan on sticking to my weight loss program this time and videos like this will motivate me to keep the weight off this time!",Tom L,2019-10-13T18:33:35Z,2
