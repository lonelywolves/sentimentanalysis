Enjoyed the workout. I just didn&#39;t like that it ended right as she was going into the next move. I understand that this is only a preview but still.,Tani Boo Boo Kitty Jones,2019-11-25T22:46:12Z,0

Any beginners here we can help each other?,Mwakazi's Fitness,2019-11-24T19:57:24Z,3
Good luck not sure of you will consider me a beginner but I started about two months ago and  I try to go gym at least three times a week for weight training. I do these workouts at home to help with my cardio since I rarely do those at the gym,Marshmallows are awesome,2019-11-24T23:34:37Z,1
"I am beginning AGAIN!  I am 47, but in my twenties I was a five day worker outter.   Not a gym rat, have always hated working out - I had a crush on the trainer 😍  I got lazy and left that area.  Fast forward 20 years and almost 40 lbs later and yeah.  Starting over again.  This looks fun, but there is a lot of hopping/jumping which is not my favorite, but it <b>looks</b> &quot;easy enough&quot;.  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23FamousLastWords"">#FamousLastWords</a><br /><br />GOOD LUCK!",blackmownkey,2019-11-24T22:49:56Z,0
