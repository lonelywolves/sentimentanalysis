GREAT 20 MIN WORKOUT,Nara,2020-07-11T15:47:05Z,1
"Amo los workout con Christa DiPaolo, llevo dos meses apróx con ellos y he bajado 2 kilos, admito que sin tanta constancia como debiera pero los cambios se notan. Mucha mejor resistencia y un claro aumento de la masa muscular. <br /><br />Eso sí, me encantaría ver un preview de la rutina al inicio de cada video, muchas veces me ha pasado que estoy motivada realizando los ejercicios y cambian a rutinas con mayor impacto que por ejemplo en mi caso no puedo realizar y uno pierde al tiro el ritmo.",michi_G0,2020-07-08T21:02:17Z,2
