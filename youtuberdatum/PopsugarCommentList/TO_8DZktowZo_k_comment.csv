"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. (Luke 13:5)<br />Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions. Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.

I loved this (even though I looked like I had a seizure) BUT the one thing I didn&#39;t like was that there were no breaks. Not one. I have asthma so even then seconds can help me.

"Soooo no one else thinks this is cultural appropriation? Like we can’t get cornrows but y’all  get stereotype our dances? Maybe I’m being dramatic but the whole time I was doing the workout I was kinda cringing. Now I guess I wouldn’t have a problem with it if they knew what they were talking about, but they clearly don’t, because when it came to the Brazilian dance she said it wasn’t Latin, even tho it is 👀. Anyways the workout was alright I guess. But I still think it’s culture appropriation.",Andrea Centeno-Herrera,2021-03-19T18:44:03Z,0

"I will never do this workout again. Idk if this workout said it was beginner, intermediate, or what, but as a beginner this was way too fast paced. Everything from the warm up to cool down moved too quickly for me. Also, the switch to different moves was too quick and I couldn&#39;t keep up. I ended up making up my own moves(constantly moving) and doing what I could follow for over half of this workout just to get my exercise time in.

Hey two questions (either for pop sugar to answer or someone else who would know)<br />1. Would this work out be considered high-impact or low-impact dance aerobics? Or is this not consider aerobics at all because its cardio (not clear on the difference)?<br />2. About how many calories does this 30 minute full routine burn? I know this will depend on the weight of the person (I am around 190 lbs) but I wasn&#39;t sure what to count this as.,Rachael K,2021-01-10T23:04:34Z,1
"Hi Rachael!! So aerobics are when you get into the fat burning zone. Cardio is similar in that it burns fat and calories. The workout is more high impact, but you can also use the modifier to make it more low impact! Whatever works for you.  As far as calories, it does depend on body weight of course, but also body type, muscle mass, metabolism, etc. Depending on how hard you work it, I&#39;d say up to 300 cals can be easily burned doing this workout! 🔥💦🙌🏾",NicoleSteenFitness,2021-01-12T00:14:13Z,1

"Great workout! I was in a Latin dance group in college, but have been somewhat out of shape in a while since I&#39;ve found it difficult to workout when not doing it through dance, so this playlist is a great way to get back into it--so thank you!<br />But coming from a Latin dancer, there were some slight cultural/dance inaccuracies in this video (as there are in a lot of Zumba/Latin dance workouts), and there was a comment made about how the Caribbean dance is different from Latin dance, when they&#39;re actually not mutually exclusive since many Latin American countries are in or partially in the Caribbean! I only say this because as Zumba has become more commercial and accepted in the mainstream, the history and roots of Latin music (and dance) have gotten a little bit lost.",Toni Wilson,2021-01-04T19:09:45Z,0

"This looks like it&#39;s do-able. I shall give it a try.<br /><br />Edit:<br />So I was right and was able to pull through without a break in between. I am 42 (woman), 218 lbs and I burned a total of 353 calories and I felt the most burn in my calves. What I appreciated the most is that she changes it up often through-out the workout though towards the end it became slightly redundant....or maybe I was just getting tired, lol.  If you like to dance anyway then you might even find some moves very stress relieving. Hope that can give someone some point of refference. <br />Cheers! 🥂",Chrysi Chrysi,2020-10-19T17:48:19Z,8

Coloque por la mañana en media taza o vaso de agua, el número de granos de arroz correspondiente al número de kilos que quiere bajar.<br />2. No ponga más granos de los que necesita porque esos kilos nunca los recuperarás.<br />3. En la noche, tómese el agua dejando los granos para luego volver a llenar la taza hasta la mitad.<br /><br />Jueves<br /><br />Por la mañana en ayunas, beba de nuevo toda el agua dejando los granos de arroz y vuelva a llenar la taza hasta la mitad con agua.<br /><br />Viernes<br /><br />Por la mañana en ayunas, beba toda el agua junto con los granos de arroz.<br /><br />Importante<br /><br />1. Conserve la taza tapada durante todo el procedimiento.<br />2. Reparta copias de esta dieta conforme a los kilos que desea perder.<br />3. Comience la dieta el miércoles no antes de haber repartido todas las copias.<br />4. Puede repartir la dieta a cualquier persona.<br />5. No haga régimen aunque resulte increíble, FUNCIONA.<br /><br />Nota:<br />Si la haces tal cual se indica, respetas todo y no pones 70 granos de arroz sino 5 o 7, un número lógico, desde ya en un mes según el organismo, bajas esos kilos sin siquiera darte cuenta.

P.S. More Latin!!,Ava Grover,2020-09-28T18:30:40Z,0
I started to do this two months back with proper diet and small exercises.. totally accounting to 1 hour workout. (sometimes i just dance out for like 15 minutes if I don&#39;t feel like doing exercises.. but i always did this latin dance workout.) I started off at 176.37 pounds and now I am at 165.347 pounds. I lost few inches around ny waist and hips mostly. The workout is fun and it does burns so many calories. <br />Its always constant persistence that makes you lose weight. Let me know if you are struggling to lose weight in the comments section below. May be i can share some few tips. 💖❤️.. Thanks Nicole. Thank you PopSugar,Shilpa Ravikumar,2020-09-28T03:40:54Z,1

The dance moves are great but the music playback is woefully soft compared to the instructions. I can barely hear the music if I have the volume ay a comfortable volume. <br />Really takes away from the enjoyment of the workout.,Sithu J,2020-09-20T08:06:28Z,0

Won’t be bothering with this again - waste of time.  Far too difficult and unexplained for a beginner who has no experience in “dancing” - the moves aren’t explained at all and transitions are too fast.  Spent more time trying to work out how to do the moves as opposed to actually doing them.,Courtney Johansson,2020-09-15T08:45:20Z,1

"I&#39;m sorry but I just have to tell a little story here.<br />I had hip hop dance lessons for 5 years but then I had to quit because I had to concentrate on school and the group I danced with gave me really bad vibes. They didn&#39;t bully me but they simply didn&#39;t talk to me. That was mainly because this group was meant for slightly older girls and I only got into it because I had the spirit. Additionally, the other girls all knew each other and I was alone for most of these 5 years.<br />Me quitting the group was 3 years ago and recently I got back into dancing to improve my mental and physical health. Because, not to be sappy or anything, both were going downhill due to things like stressful school stuff and a toxic boyfriend.<br />Anyways, I started rehearsing my old routines and was so full of joy. It was awesome, but I wanted to have a fitness aspect too. <br />Then I simply searched &quot;zumba dance workout&quot; and found this video. It was very hard for me but I pulled through and was so happy to not be alone in my room dancing. Well, I still was but this video didn&#39;t make me feel that.<br />To get to the point, thank you very much for this video and I hope you are well in these crazy times &lt;3",LittleArtKid,2020-09-09T16:51:24Z,1

Moves are great however this is not for beginners. Instructor didn’t take into account  that there may be beginners  not familiar or offer  alternate moves. Moves are fast and the instructor looks like she’s dancing to be seen not teaching. It’s a fun video for Teens. Need to make that statement in the beginning. I couldn’t see older beginners doing this although the music may temp them to try. Be careful.,B Pinckney,2020-08-08T01:13:17Z,0

Omg that was the most workout I&#39;ve done since walking to classes in college 3 years ago! I&#39;m sweating bullets right now but that was so much fun! I probably was doing 40 to 50% of the moves wrong (I have absolutely no rhythm whatsoever) but I got a lot out of it and I probably burned off all my calories from dinner! LOL,"Study Hard, Sleep Easy",2020-07-28T01:53:30Z,1

See this is what I love about this. It’s easier to do a full body dance workout routine than just a normal workout since dancing is more fun. And when you’re having fun you won’t realize how fast your heart rate is getting and how much calories you’re burning off. This was sm fun,Naomi Jones,2020-07-14T15:54:21Z,2

"I&#39;m going to do this for a week from tomorrow morning and I&#39;ll come back and tell you my results. I&#39;ll also take my initial measurements tomorrow morning.<br />Day 1 - My measurements are as follows<br />Height - 157cm<br />Weight -76.2kg<br />Waist - 84cm<br />Arms - 34cm<br />Hips - 110cm<br />I just completed it and I&#39;m sweating like crazy. I enjoyed it and the time went by so fast.<br />Day2 - Just completed day 2 and I&#39;m on fire, enjoyed it. I added 10 minutes arms and 10 minutes abs workouts<br />Day3 - For some reason today was more difficult to finish but I stayed till the end. I am exhausted, adding in 20 minutes glutes this evening<br />Day 4 - Done, added in 20 minutes arms and abs<br />Day 5 - only managed to do 20 minutes, I had surgery in my left ankle over a year ago and it was quite painful today. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.<br />Day 6 - Completed and did another 10 minutes to make up for yesterday. It&#39;s getting easier to complete and I know most of the moves off by heart now<br />Day 7 - completed, I&#39;m so happy. I&#39;ll be taking my final measurements tomorrow morning<br />My new measurements are as follows:<br />Weight: 75.9kg (lost 0.3 kg, my goal was 0.5, could it be that the muscles I was working had a role in this?) I&#39;m happy either way<br />Waist: 81.6 (lost 2.4cm)<br />Arms: 33.5 (lost 0.5cm) this is a very big problem area and I&#39;m so happy<br />Hips: 110cm (no change) I worked my glutes with weights because I&#39;m not trying to lose the bit of ass I have lol<br />Overall I am happy with the results and they are quite realistic. I ate at a caloric deficit of 500 but I think I could&#39;ve done better with the quality of food I was eating. I was also intermittent fasting and waist training.<br />I&#39;ll continue to do this workout (not every day though cos I get bored easily)",Winnie Letsiki,2020-06-07T07:35:42Z,11

"Alright.... so, for those trying to figure out their calories burned, I’m just dropping a formula here for you.<br />You need to know your METS. For fast dancing, the Mets equal 5<br /><br />Formula:<br />(METs * 3.5 * your weight in kilograms)<br />Divide total by 200<br />Times total by the amount of minutes you are working out<br /><br />Pounds to kilograms formula:<br />Your weight divided by 2.2<br /><br />Here’s mine as an example:<br />I weigh 200 pounds, so I’m about 91 kilograms<br /><br />(5*3.5*91)= 1,592.5<br />1,592.5 divided by 200=7.9625<br />7.9625 *(multiplied by) 60=477.75<br />I round down at this point.<br />So I’ve burned about 477 calories for this dance.<br /><br />Good luck!",Theodore Coldren,2020-06-02T00:16:30Z,1

"i lost confidence,while doing this dance. I was like happy and the time went fast 13 mins down to go,but my cousin is a pervert and he always watched and follows me. I can’t wear anything cute or shorts because he will stare at me. It’s really hot today and my window is open and I shut my curtains so the fresh air can come in but then nobody watches me I looked out the window bc I heard something turns out he was outside hearing everything and watching me.🙄 i can’t ever do anything alone for a second or someone is watching me good thing they will leave in a few weeks or month 💀 I hate him here. But other than that I love this workout it motivated me a lot I love it sm!🥺💓",shit caca,2020-05-26T21:22:48Z,2

This is the first video I&#39;ve done on my new journey of weight loss. I&#39;m an overweight teenage girl and I have lots of self confidence issues. I want to lose weight so that I can be happy with my body (also my papa is paying me $10 for every pound I lose but shhh). I really like how encouraging the lead woman was. I never felt insecure about not always being able to keep up because she was always saying positive things. The next time I want to exercise I&#39;ll definitely watch this channel again. Thanks for being a teacher to a girl who&#39;s trying her best!!,Lauren Pubillones,2020-05-21T04:34:12Z,2

"Ok, so I am I think at a good and healthy weight. I’m 14, 160 cm and 47 kg. Some say I’m skinny, but I have a lot of belly fat. I think I’m called ‘skinny fat’. Will these types of videos help me get rid of this fat? I’m only doing this because apparently belly fat is signs of upcoming health risks and many types of chronic illnesses so I want to prevent that as soon as possible. Also, I eat a lot of carbs ( and in my culture we eat so much bread, rice and pasta) and I have no idea what to supplement carbs with in my diet.<br />Thank you for reading that.",It’s Me,2020-04-17T11:54:18Z,2

"This was one of the first workouts from Popsugar. I started working out again a month and a half ago when Italy started shutting down. I love Nicole’s energy and I love that it is a fast paced exercise. From this one I moved to several other dance cardio workouts and now I can pick up the moves way faster. In this month and a half I have lost 4 kg, my arms and shoulders are looking amazing. My waistline is getting thinner, my stomach is toning and reducing. My legs are leaner, I’ve lost at least 3 cm on my thighs. So thank you Popsugar for the amazing content, for the amazing instructors and for motivating me to do better for myself.",noonahatesyou,2020-04-15T18:07:20Z,7

"M Kenney I’m working out an hour 5 to 6 days a week. Aside from this workout I also do many others from Popsugar. I do dance cardio, kick boxing and toning and strength workouts. I also dedicate at least one workout to strength and toning as it helps a lot in the weight lost department. Just pick something you like and try to build a routine with it. I started small doing the 7 minute workout from an App, then started doing 15 minutes after a week and then I discovered Popsugar and started doing half an hour and from then an hour. Time flies when you find a fun workout. Also drink water. Tons of it. At least 2 liters per day.",noonahatesyou,2020-04-22T06:02:07Z,2

"3,500 calories is a pound so I really think its alot about diet if you want to lose weight, but getting fit this is perfect for moving your body and you can add other excercises for toning etc.",Amy Briseno,2020-05-08T16:08:23Z,1
Do you guys know if doing this ( switching it with other 30 minute ones)  workout once a day is enough or should i do more exercises?,Maja Kiepas,2020-04-27T13:27:47Z,1
I lost 2 kg in about two weeks!❤,aga aa,2020-04-21T19:28:32Z,6
"According to my apple watch 186 calories. I did only a couple of modifications. So I would place it around 150 to 200 calories. It’s a good workout, but as the other reply said it’s best to do other workouts too to get some more muscles working.",noonahatesyou,2020-04-15T17:56:12Z,10

"The pony is one of those old school Richard Simmons moves lol. He probably breaks it down in his old videos, but to break it down here, think of stepping 123 switch 123 (left right left and right left right). Practice this and you will see yourself eventually get it. If still too challenging, just do the modification move which is a step touch like Tara is doing in the workout...you got this😉",NicoleSteenFitness,2020-04-10T00:37:11Z,1

Did this for the first time today and I loved it. Easy to follow along with and incorporate ways to advance techniques and minimise. I am currently limited on arm movements due to a recent surgery so I couldn’t reach up on those moves that required so I adapted it to meet my needs. However i completed the whole routine  without hesitating. I built a good sweat afterward. Hoping to incorporate this routine in my week while we are on lockdown in UK.,Munazah A,2020-04-08T15:38:56Z,2

I&#39;m sorry but I was not a fan of this workout. I&#39;ve been watching and doing a lot of the PopSugar Fitness videos recently and I felt as if she did not teach you the steps at all. I understand samba/Latin is quick but I was tripping over my feet because she wouldn&#39;t show us the steps<br /> Plus she&#39;s incorporate new moves so quickly if was difficult to follow,Alexis Roberts,2020-03-13T20:38:49Z,0

"Really loved this workout! However, I didn&#39;t really agree with the &quot;If you don&#39;t love yourself, no one will&quot; comment. That&#39;s not a good message to be putting out there. Loving yourself can be a long, difficult journey, and it&#39;s important to have the love and support of others around you on that journey. You don&#39;t have to love yourself completely in order to be loved by others. It&#39;s a process!

"I&#39;m going to do this workout every day for a week and share my results with you guys, please like and comment for motivation!!<br /><br />Height: 165cm<br />Initial weight: 71kg<br /><br />Day 1: Sweating a lot but it was really fun! Looking forward for the rest of the week<br /><br />Day 2: still as challenging as the first day but loving it! Also, I do the whole 30 mins without stopping for the water break or any other time<br /><br />Day 3: I&#39;ve pretty much learned the movements by now so I can do the choreo more easily and keep up with the trainer better<br /><br />Day 4: around the last 6 minutes it still feels exhausting but I feel so accomplished every time I finish it :)<br /><br />Day 5: the workout felt shorter that usual today, I guess it&#39;s getting easier! 😁 I also feel a lot more energized throughout the day<br /><br />Day 6: it feels really easy to keep up now, but it still gets my heart rate going! Excited for the last day tomorrow 😁<br /><br />Day 7: I&#39;ve done it!! I feel so happy that I could stick to this for a week, it&#39;s been really fun! I will weigh myself tomorrow morning and let you know if I&#39;ve lost any weight 😊<br /><br />Results: I weight 70.4kg! That means in a week I&#39;ve lost 0.6kg, wich I think is a very healthy rate of losing weight. I haven&#39;t changed anything in my diet, I&#39;ve just tried to eat smaller portions and eat very little for dinner.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful for those who are thinking of doing this workout! I will definitely be continuing with other dance routines. Good luck everyone 😁",- ShaniraJi -,2020-01-01T04:18:10Z,1035

I may have gave up half way through but I got up again, finished the work out and when the Instructor said “you did so well” I honestly teared up.<br /><br />Definitely going to keep up with these videos so I can get in shape and happy with my body again! <br /><br />Thanks for the motivation and making this fun!",Beca Lace,2019-11-07T17:42:56Z,57

"WOW!  That was an amazing dance workout!  Easy enough to follow along, complicated enough to keep me on my toes and difficult enough to make me sweat. Also lots of fun.  I feel saucy and energized.  At 5 minutes left, I began wondering if I would have to take a breather, but I endured and made it through.  I will put this video on again and again.  Perfect job Nicole, Deja brought life, Tarra, I found it easy to follow you with your consistent movements and Kristel when I was unfamiliar with the steps made it so I could follow.

Have you done this 2 times in a row? I feel 30 min is too little to actually lose weight has anybody have any encouraging experience with this type of workouts? I diet and stay away from sugars and all but this is my first time trying 30 min routines I used to hit the gym 1 hour a day so I’m a bit concerned,NEZUMI,2019-10-29T11:13:19Z,0
Georgia Rose I started doing that one and the hip hop Tabata <br />Im vegetarian so I eat healthy most of the time <br />And I don’t eat dairy since I’m allergic xD <br />What i did was start counting calories to burn more than I take and it has worked so far.,NEZUMI,2019-11-12T07:28:17Z,0
"@NEZUMI dieting doesnt always work as the body tends to revert back to eating how you did before, its not good for long term. try just making small changes and replacing what u had with something else that is healthier e.g. if you r craving something sweet and fatty try a banana with some peanut butter as itll keep u full and satieted as an afternoon snack. if you like lasagne try making it with gluten free pasta sheets and use lentil Bolognese instead of beef, so many less calories, as well as the cheese sauce use a vegan alternative which doesnt contain all the fats in cows milk. i also feel this isnt enough as a workout but i dont have time to do more than this on some days, i find madfit&#39;s short hiit workouts would be a good add on to this xx",Georgia Rose,2019-11-09T09:36:23Z,1
Edit: I’m sweating like a mofo but I still had energy so I did pop sugar 15 min dancing to have extra punch <br />How many calories did you burn with this 30 min workout?,NEZUMI,2019-10-29T12:11:17Z,0

"I really enjoyed this dance workout, but I really wish fitness trainers would be more mindful of the things they say during workouts and how their words may impact someone in that setting. I was really thrown when Nicole said, &quot;Love yourself. If you don&#39;t, no one else will.&quot; A lot of people do these workouts as a means of self care and may be struggling with depression and a lack of self-confidence. What Nicole said isn&#39;t true, for one thing; many people who struggle to love themselves have (and NEED!) loving, supportive people in their lives. It&#39;s also a damaging thing to tell someone who&#39;s going through these struggles; people need to believe they are worthy of love even when they struggle to love themselves, and saying otherwise in such a casual, matter-of-fact way makes that harder to believe. I don&#39;t think Nicole intended to be hurtful (I really believe she just wants to encourage confidence and positivity, which is good!), but it&#39;s important to think about the way you choose to express something.",Sutton Strother,2019-10-10T20:42:01Z,2
"I noticed that specific comment, too. As you said, I am sure it wasn&#39;t meant in any hurtful manner; seemed like she said it to motivate, but I would say I have a healthy relationship with self esteem and confidence, good friends, family and yet, I noticed it. I hope that no one has taken this to heart and it has set them back, as this is a fantastic workout, with a true feel-good vibe, meant to inspire and be fun.",CreativeQueen,2019-11-15T12:21:08Z,1

my favourite trainer is deja . she is so much fun to watch. I am always amazed by her energy and vivacious spirit. she always brings so much joy to the room whenever she dances or exercises and she is a deep fountain of wisdom that should be on everyones bucket list to pay attention to &lt;3,Daniel Wiseman,2019-05-04T04:17:08Z,1
@Deja Riley you are welcome amazing Deja. I hope you are allowed to release all your work outs on dvd so I  can buy them. it would also be awesome if you and your sisters got to make videos together with full creative control not just singing but sharing whatever God has laid on your heart. I really want to explore your past more cos what you came out of and experienced is truly mind blowing. by sharing your joy and pain you can help others to gain peace knowing they are not alone in their fight and there is another side to the river of their struggle. you are living proof &lt;3,Daniel Wiseman,2019-05-09T12:09:21Z,0

"To be honest, I usually HATE dance workouts but this one was so much fun!! I worked up a decent sweat, and I feel like I got a good workout in. The footwork can be hard to catch up on at first especially because they&#39;re transitioning into other moves, but other than that it was a fun one!",Christy Ward,2019-04-07T18:04:03Z,2

This is great to do in the days between the hip hop tabata video. It&#39;s a lot more dance and cardio based than strength based. It&#39;s a fun addition to a regimen or a nice way to start cardio dance,Paula La Poderosa,2019-04-07T17:11:34Z,2

Overall great workout and the instructor was fun.",Vibe Sista,2019-04-04T16:41:10Z,2
