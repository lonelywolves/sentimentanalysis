"Workout full of ads, seriously? I know you want to earn you can put add when video starts and ends. But in between? Seriously this is insane, you are into workout and bam ads for 30 seconds and now there&#39;s another add after that. How frustrating this is.",Rahema,2020-08-17T09:11:05Z,49

Usually it’s not up to them. YouTube will throw in ads in between at random. Especially with long videos like these,Indicaap0ppin,2020-09-01T21:03:47Z,2

ANNA! I know she said goodbye on IG as to being a popsugar host and it breaks my heart. But I’m so glad we still get new workouts from her! Her energy even in other trainers’ workouts is such a boost and is extremely underrated.
