I&#39;m around the two minute mark and there are two different music tracks playing. Just want you guys to know so maybe you can fix. I thought it was just a fade between songs for a bit but it&#39;s definitely at the point where it&#39;s two separate songs playing simultaneously.,Simone Short,2020-08-06T08:16:33Z,0
