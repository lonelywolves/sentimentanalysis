"Like many moms, I have a diastasis Recti, and found there were several moves in here that are unsafe for me, such as the planks/push ups and that roll out, etc.<br />I love pop sugar, love Anna, but disappointed that a workout geared towards postpartum mothers wouldn‚Äôt be more mindful and careful not to exacerbate this condition. Most moms are unaware they even have it",Meagan Hall,2021-01-18T11:04:39Z,0

"Great workout! Moms please check yourselves for diastis recti before resuming exercise, your ab muscles split during pregnancy and sometimes don&#39;t go back together without proper physical therapy. Some of these exercises might make an abdominal gap wider if not done with proper form. Also beware of high impact moves that can put stress on a weakened pelvic muscles, causing bladder leakage. Being evaluated by a licensed physical therapist who specializes in women&#39;s health can do wonders for your posture, abdominal healing, and pelvic muscle health! <a href=""https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-body/postpartum/diastasis-recti-the-postpartum-body-problem-no-one-talks-about/"">https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-body/postpartum/diastasis-recti-the-postpartum-body-problem-no-one-talks-about/</a>",Heidi Slack,2020-10-13T00:30:23Z,2

"Popsugar Fitness!  You had this great, low impact cardio workout hosted by this cute, curvy trainer. I think she was wearing an oragne camo workout set, but I don&#39;t know for sure.

"I first did this workout when I started working out two months ago. My legs were fucked the next couple of days.

Not a new mam (kids are 15 and 7!) but loved this workout. Good pace and still felt like I‚Äôd worked hard. Don‚Äôt usually like repeat circuits but this was fine I think because they were short circuits. Lovely to see/hear Anna again üòâüí™üèº,Janet Brooks,2019-04-22T09:41:46Z,0
"So happy  that Anna is back and for a workout that doesn&#39;t involve dancing and jumping around. I have been dealing with an autoimmune disorder and some workouts do more harm than good. This workout was manageable for me  and still felt challenging enough. It left me feeling energized and good and not burned out. Thank you Anna! Please, if possible, can you include more Barre and Pilates workouts also? That would be amazing. Thank you.",soulchild,2019-04-22T09:18:14Z,2

its not about what diet to follow. its so simple actually. you just hav to eat lesser calories than how much you burn. you can calculate how much calories you need to eat to lose weight on google.,syuhaidahjohnson,2019-04-22T15:38:57Z,0

"not a mom - did this workout - oh what a workout. I&#39;ve been thinking abt going back to the gym after straying away from an active lifestyle... but with the way things are, at home work outs are currently the best for me because it works with my time. no equipment body workouts are the absolute best because you strengthen your own self (and boy do I need strengthening again) thank you!
