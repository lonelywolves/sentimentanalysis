"I did a short beginners video by this lady, and omg I was so sore for days. She kicks your butt quickly.",It's Me,2020-02-09T23:56:30Z,34
This workout was greattt! <br />Everything was very controlled and made me burn without hurting any joints. <br />Thankyou so much. <br />You have definitely earned a new follower🙋!,Tanushree Sonpitale,2021-04-18T05:43:19Z,0
"This is not the workout to try if you have wrist issues. But overall an effective, quick workout. Thank you!",Tracey Waye,2021-04-13T06:05:01Z,0
"Not too shabby, The only part that kind of miffed me a bit, was where the coordination of the second last move was. It was too confusing for me. I felt a bit of a burn.",starynight ugh,2021-02-11T23:49:19Z,0

too much repetitions,Adam Tarnacki,2021-01-12T13:19:22Z,0
Way too repetitive!,melissahuckins,2021-01-11T23:18:20Z,0
Very repetitive especially on shoulders and wrists. I think this would have been a great workout if she had two more exercises instead of doing 25-50 reps with each exercise.,Kit Prelewitz,2021-01-09T23:09:02Z,0
Phew tough short workout ❤💪,Little Creators Homeschool,2020-12-24T19:59:21Z,1
Wayyyyy too many reps of each exercise. Would prefer all unique exercises instead of a billion repetitions of the same one. 😴,Barbara Vezos,2020-12-12T16:38:06Z,0
"not a smart design, giving the wrists too much stress, kind of annoying and hurt,<br />and holding the same position for the wrist for most of the time(the reps are really long)<br />Not an ideal one.",Liny W.,2020-11-13T18:50:34Z,0

Beginners friendly!! This one is superb,guo suki,2020-06-26T14:56:43Z,0
this workout was waaaaay to repetitive. more variation would be more effective and engaging,Deja Kemp-Salliey,2020-06-15T22:00:46Z,2
"During quarantine I’ve done a lot of workout videos and I’ve never done one that comes close to the number of reps per move as this one. There are too few exercises and too, too many reps. It gets boring and is very defeating to hear ‘only 40 more’ when you’ve already done a bunch.",Tina Proveaux,2020-06-11T16:40:38Z,1
Didn&#39;t love this one...last leg moves are way too complicated and don&#39;t seem to do a thing,Millie Forbidussi,2020-05-13T14:03:58Z,10
Too slow. Too repetitive. And the ab work at the end was a bit ridiculous,Miss Tindle,2020-04-24T18:57:48Z,6

"I thought the exercises were good; however, I too think it was too many repetitions, especially the last exercise where you&#39;re on your wrists for a long time...My wrists were hurting.",LikesandLoves,2020-04-11T06:40:26Z,13

"She is beautiful, but due endless repetitions I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s a compelling workout. Time doesn&#39;t seem to elapse. It reminded me of some of her other workouts previously posted on Popsugar where she had endless repetitions as well. I enjoyed the nice variation on the music too and how different body types are featured. Love Popsugar and am grateful for the variety of workouts they offer.",soulchild,2020-02-10T02:33:20Z,31
I got a little frustrated for the endless repetitions,Raquel Serrano,2020-02-29T16:59:23Z,3
"soulchild agree. I feel like that last exercise really didn’t do much to engage my glutes at all either. Maybe if she had added a few variations into that whole set I feel like it would be more effective. Nothing wrong with a ton of repetitions, I actually love that, but maybe adding two or three variations into each exercise would make it more challenging and fun.",Lewla Blue,2020-02-23T02:21:10Z,1
