"I have to say, this was my least favorite of the POPSUGAR Fitness videos my partner and I have worked out to recently.  It was kind of slow moving, very few actual moves, which were kind of hard to keep up with. The instructor gave very little instruction or notice, and it was often generic and confusing.  It&#39;s off my playlist and back to the other popsugar vids for us.",Gio Stabs,2020-04-15T21:16:06Z,0

"it was ok, but you definitely should slow it down some. i wasted more time trying to learn the moves because you guys went too fast. it was like 4 moves per time that i had to remember and by that point i lost interest. only made it to 15 minutes. the warm up was super lengthy as well.

"I like a lot of your dance videos, but this one like some others, felt a little off. The music got really weird in the middle. It was too slow and sounded like an antique music box. The dancers all seemed a little put off by it too but powered through. I broke a sweat, but was really bored by the halfway point doing the same 2 min routine over and over. Finally, the music volume is too low. If it&#39;s loud enough to hear the music, the instructor is shouting at me. So I turn it down but then can&#39;t hear the music. Please keep making great videos and maybe put a little more planning into the dance videos to make sure ppl can follow and also not get bored. Thanks Popsugar.",toughywoughy,2020-03-03T04:38:32Z,1

I did get a good work out. And i appreciate that but im a little tired of the routine dance stuff. I love to dance but i want to dance while i&#39;m working out. This is more focused on getting the moves right when im more focused on my muscles and form. Dissapointing i used this at 4 am for 30 min before work instead of something else that would have worked my abs and back more.,Jessica Ali,2020-01-10T11:04:52Z,0

"I think this workout was amazing!!!!  I love the instructors energy and humor, and especially love how he teaches you the choreography and then we do it slow, medium, fast, slow, fast, etc.  Whatever the beat of the song, we do the same dance moves to it.  Instead of learning twenty dances to twenty different songs like in Zumba, there&#39;s only one dance to learn but it is used throughout various beats.  So genius!  Once I learned the moves, I could just let the music and dance take me on a mental vacation!  I love thissssssssss!!!!!!!!",Dreamer,2019-07-22T18:39:32Z,207

"I didn&#39;t like this one at all. So much free styling to the point that I started getting frustrated. For the first half, the moves did not not have enough reps for me to get the gist of the move and follow along so I was fumbling around and then they&#39;d freestyle right away (so your heart rate doesn&#39;t get a chance to build up). The music kept changing mid dance set that if you didn&#39;t learn the move quick enough now your tempo is off and you feel like an idiot. The second half was a single choreographed dance which is done over and over again. It was far easier to learn but the music is still changing mid dance and the amount of freestyling had me so confused. It just felt very disorganized and catered heavily towards those with advanced skills. Although I sweat a lot, I felt I could have gotten the same workout just dancing around the house for 30 minutes to my own music.",NeonHologram666,2019-07-22T04:02:15Z,1

森 well it’s not an excuse it’s the truth. They can’t use music unless they’re willing to pay the original artist for using their music. And because they have yet to actually have popular music to dance to it’s clear that they don’t want to pay and they don’t want to be copyrighted for anything. 🤷🏾‍♀️,Lost,2019-07-22T00:47:19Z,3
