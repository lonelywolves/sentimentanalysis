Have you ever thought about fixing the sound?<br />it is still bad in this one. <br />it made this workout quality not that good because we couldn&#39;t hear well.,Liny W.,2021-02-02T16:12:31Z,0
"Folks, yes the sound wasn&#39;t the best, but this was a fabulous FREE workout. The instructors are dealing with many of the same challenges we are during this nutty ass time in life. 🙂<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23moregratitudeplease"">#MoreGratitudePlease</a><br /><br />Many thanks, Katie!",Willie J.,2021-01-26T23:36:21Z,2

"I just got my sliders today and did this Sculpting Workout With Sliders, and it was so very challenging but I LOVED it!!  However, with so much echoing in that room or sound system, I probably understood only half that you were saying.  Is there a way to correct that problem?  Thanks, Katie!",Susan Fusuma,2020-12-08T20:42:46Z,0
