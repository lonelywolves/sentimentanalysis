commenting from quarantine!! :) ive been trying LOADS of different hiit videos from different channels and even a lot of the ones from popsugar too but I ALWAYS come back to this one because it really gets me sweating like no other exercise! would highly recommend this hiit workout to put into your daily exercise. I workout about 5 times a week and always do at least 20 minutes of hiit to help lose body fat before I work on toning specific muscles. hope this helps and let&#39;s come out of quarantine stronger than ever!!,Jenifer Zheng,2020-05-16T22:19:15Z,3

"Wow, if you&#39;re gonna do ads, at least place them during the rest times. Nothing more annoying than having to stop in the middle of a 30-second work interval to press &quot;skip ad.&quot; And they were every couple of minutes, never seen anything that bad before.",Jackie Lariviere,2020-03-16T17:07:12Z,4

"Fantastic workout! One request tho...could you only post commercials at the beginning and end of the workouts? I had four unskippable commercial breaks during the workout and I feel it slowed my momentum. I appreciate that any ad revenue you receive will go towards great programming that I, admittedly, enjoy. I just request that those ads not air during the workout. Thanks for all the wonderful work you do!",Two Cents28,2020-03-12T12:44:17Z,0

"I have been using popsugar videos as my go-to for my morning workouts for about 4-5 years now. I love this video (and the instructor, Betina). My butt and upper legs hurt the day after doing this video (I have done it 2x so far and plan to do it weekly). I think it is one of the best videos for a butt workout. You can adjust the weight as your body gets used to the weight. It&#39;s great!",hfx online,2020-03-10T13:51:18Z,2

"Ads, seriously Anna, I get needing to jump on the bandwagon with all the other YouTube channels, but so disappointing you have moved to having to need ads in the middle if the workouts.... I could handle the odd ones you used to at the beginning of the other workouts, but now to throw them in mid workout, really disappointing.  Might keep hunting for other channels that don’t have the ads. Thanks though",Michelle H,2020-03-09T21:46:19Z,0

The first 2 days I did but then I got comfortable and just watch movies all day. Anyways, this is the first real workout I did in a week and omg, I thought my heart was gonna fall out of my chest 10 minutes into the workout. So, In my head I told myself I would only do 15 minutes of the workout. I did it all and I feel great!!

"So glad to of seen this as I&#39;ve loved Betina&#39;s workout from last year and have done it at least 20 times! This one was great, loads of cardio and I loved the weights which now I know what&#39;s in store might go heavier next time. So good to have a decent cool down.
