That guy&#39;s bs counting really ticked me off.,Miranda Jones,2021-04-07T16:57:26Z,0
"Although all the moves were simplistic, non-impact and fine, the instructor loses all trust and credibility  when he stops doing the workout multiple times on non-intensive moves...then likes to joke with the count and length of each count hold on almost every exercise. It was like a frat boy decided to do a class to be around chicks. Again, it would be one thing if he stopped doing the workout for a second to ‚Äúcoach‚Äù and catch his breath during back to back burpees and squat jumps...but this guy takes a breather during simple squat holds and planks.  He lost total trainer credibility at that point.",Tiffany Walker,2021-04-02T16:24:50Z,0

"Deff made me sweat and a good variety of moves, but I didn&#39;t like the flow of moves or the pace. If your looking for a low impact routine because of your knees, this is not for you. I also had to modify a ton of the moves because if I went at the pace they did I could hurt myself. Also as others have said the fake out counting is annoying.",Francesca Canepa,2021-03-01T15:42:56Z,0
"I&#39;ve watched many videos on this channel and it struck me how sexist this one feels: A Male instructor doing half of the workout when all other female instructors on this channel do the whole workout.

If you tell me at the beginning it&#39;s only ten seconds, then keep it ten seconds! Don&#39;t switch up on me, telling me for 30 more seconds.

"We gave up so many times during the workout. First he stopped so many times which makes you even wonder why he keeps pushing you when he&#39;s not showing an example. Seconds not counting accurately and not telling you for how long to plank is horrible, if I know I have a minute to hold I will. If I hold for 40 sec and there&#39;s no finish line I&#39;ll give up. Plus all of his squat holds and one leg forever holds are definitely not for the average person, nobody can make it entirely without giving up a few times.

"I enjoyed the workout, and it really got me to push myself. To all the people who complain about the extended time, Jake Dupree does the same thing in his workouts and it&#39;s to get you to push yourself further whether you&#39;re doing the modified or advance.
