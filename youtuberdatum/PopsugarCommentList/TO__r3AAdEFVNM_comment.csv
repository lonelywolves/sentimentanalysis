"Everyone don&#39;t let this moment pass you make the most of it by you making the best decision of your life right now by allowing God to come into your life by you praying to God everyday for his help in every decision of your life everyday and in every situation of your life everyday for I guarantee if you do this everyday then your life will get better, you will have more peace, you will be more successful, you will have more happiness, and all your dreams will come true that’s because when you pray to God then God will make all good things possible for you and you must not forget to read the “Holy Bible” everyday and a great place for you to start in the holy Bible is (Psalms 1) and everyday after that read a chapter in Psalms till you finish all the chapters in Psalms then after that start on (Proverbs 1) then everyday after that read a chapter in Proverbs till you finish all the chapters in Proverbs and after that read every chapter of the Holy Bible until you finish it for it will change your life in the most amazing way",THE ONLINE CHRISTIAN MINISTER,2021-05-02T21:46:09Z,0

"first day: it was painful especially the core. i didn&#39;t sweat a lot because i naturally don&#39;t sweat much but my body feels good. it was a little uncomfortable but i think i can do this every other day. i will update on results.<br />day 2: today I felt tight and a little bit more toned. I didn&#39;t think that it would come that fast but today was a little harder because my muscles were really tight and tense. also today I feel like I was getting more of a burn out of it than the first day.<br />day 3: it&#39;s been about two days since I&#39;ve done it, if feels somewhat like the first day. I&#39;m not as sore and I feel like my body is starting to get more toned like it was the second day.<br />day 4: So today I was sweating a lot, it felt a lot more harder to do than the first day. I feel like I got a good workout in. I&#39;ve noticed that my legs have gotten more toned, my butt Is kind of becoming more round and just being bigger overall. This summer I didn&#39;t have much of anything because during corona, I lost a lot of muscle (which made my butt look so much smaller). Now that I&#39;ve done this work out continuously for four days now I feel like it&#39;s going back to the way used to look which is really good.<br />day 5: So it&#39;s been two days again since I&#39;ve done the work out but I feel like the exercise is getting maybe a tad bit easier and more comfortable. I feel like my thighs getting a lot stronger and toned. My butt is getting bigger too, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good thing this is a result you want. my stomach is now becoming abs<br />day 6:",TELA,2020-09-12T18:15:19Z,77

"This whole video was so easy to follow along and had such a great variety of moves. I loved that they actually took water breaks and didn&#39;t cut it out of the video. Other workout videos do that and it&#39;s so annoying to have to pause the video each time just so it doesn&#39;t go on without you. I felt like I was truly in a class.

"I was confused about the kicks cause they were saying how much it was burning and I thought surely I was doing something wrong cause it wasn&#39;t burning much for me and so went back and did it again and I still didn&#39;t think it was bad so I have no idea what I was doing differently; I watched them so carefully. Made sure it was the same leg when doing it each side, kicked quite high and held it too and I still didn&#39;t feel much—I don&#39;t know. 🤷🏻‍♀️<br />The rest of the workout though I definitely felt it—very sweaty right now!

"Mendina yes I did see. My body was sore after the workout especially my abs, so I knew it was a good workout to challenge my body and burn the fat. My average weight before pregnancy  was 59-63. I was 67kg when I gave birth. Gained more weight post pregnancy. I was 74 kg about 3 months ago, no idea how I came down to 68kg, the only change I made was cutting my sugar in coffee from 6 sugars to 2 ( don’t ask me why, I was just so used to very sweet coffee since young age, within a week a decreased my coffee sugar intake to 2 sugar and my tongue got used to it straight away). After I did this workout 2 times in a week, I went down to 67. Had I continued this workout I will probably be 65 kg now but I did not continue as I am waiting for ultrasound as I’ve been having abdominal pain. Trust me this workout is really good and challenging! U will definitely get results. If you are skeptical about it, do this routine twice a week and alternate with another routine twice a week. (Work our 4 times per week). You can start 2 times a week and increase until your body is used to the activity. Also try drinking green tea/ oolong tea 1/2-1 he after every meal 3times a day, will increase metabolism and help your body and digestive system feel clean and flushed from toxins, encouraging your body to accept healthier foods. Hope this helps XX",Janet Malhotra,2020-08-07T11:43:21Z,10

"My suggestion is to make the warm ups faster or to not include them in the &quot;30 minute work out.&quot; For the stretch before and after to be ~4 minutes each for a total of ~8 minutes makes the work out only ~22 minutes... This workout felt really slow. There&#39;s another &quot;10 minute booty shaping workout&quot; that is also on PopSugar Fitness in which I felt the soreness pretty quickly on.

WE CAN DO IT, GUYS! ;D<br />2nd EDIT: Lost a bit more weight (2.6 lbs), totalling to 6.4 lbs so far. It&#39;s a MARATHON, not a sprint!<br />3rd Edit: 16 lbs down!<br />4th Edit: Hit a bit of a plateau for a couple of weeks, but I&#39;m starting to lose a bit of weight again. 17.2 lbs down! 😁<br />5th Edit: 20 lbs down! :D It&#39;s hard work, but I&#39;m going slow and steady. I started 12 - hr night shifts, so it&#39;s been hard to balance work and self-care.<br />6th Edit: 22 lbs down! :) I find that it&#39;s a bit harder to lose weight, not sure if I&#39;m losing fat and gaining muscle. Hit a bit of a plateau, but I&#39;m going to keep going and try eating healthier.<br />7th Edit: 12 lbs down! It&#39;s been a minute since I posted. Lots of ups and downs and stress over the past couple of months, but still determined to get healthy. Gained a bit of weight, but a lot of people have been commenting that I look slimmer (maybe I gained some muscle too). Never give up all.

"I love this channel in general - great workouts, fun to do, easy to follow, LOVE all the color coordinated outfits (they are such a nice touch and provide visual interest haha), and the instructors are great but this one is definitely my favorite. Ive been working out every morning for a while and once I found this one I haven&#39;t stopped doing it. I guess I&#39;ll give up and try something else once it gets too easy but Brittne is so fun and inspiring and I love that she has achieved such an amazing look mostly at home with limited equipment!

I want to shape my body and make it more toned so I’ve been doing these exercises every other day for the past two weeks and I feel so much better already. I haven’t see direct results but I can feel that I’m on my way to a healthier lifestyle just by doing 30 min exercises. It’s better than what I was before when I wasn’t exercising at all bc the first time I did this I couldn’t keep up at all and I’m 18!

"Make sure you’re really using control on the kicks don’t just fling your leg up. Slow down a bit and squeeze your muscles with each movement and make sure you keep your back straight and abs tight. If it’s still too easy once you’re certain your form is good you could add ankle weights, but when you combine the kicks with everything else in this workout I doubt that’d be necessary.",Cassidy Perkins,2020-03-19T18:21:38Z,0

"I’m glad I found these videos, scratch that I’m glad I found this channel. I’m not able to get to the gym like that but I still want to be active and exercise. And in the near future shed some pounds . <br /><br />I did this video and another video from this channel and I’m drenched in sweat and I LOVE IT . From now on the days I can’t make it to the gym I’ll do two different videos from this channel.  I’m not even going to lie, I was on edge about even trying this and didn’t think it was possible for someone my size.

"I love this workout! It’s tough and my obliques are already feeling it just having completed it. I like how Brittany focuses on slower more methodical movements targeting form over reps. It’s a way more efficient workout than most I’ve tried on pop sugar. Some trainers go so fast, it’s impossible to keep up as a beginner. Not that this workout is geared for beginners. I’m a hobby triathlete so I spend all my workout time swimming running and cycling. This is a good workout to incorporate for core, hips and shoulder strength. And thank you for incorporating a good stretch and cool down into circuit 3. So many of these workouts have you going 99 mph and then end with 5 secs on 2 stretches each . I sweated hard and was breathing hard. This is on my fav list to do many more times!!",Sandra K,2019-04-01T01:24:32Z,4

I loved this workout! It was like a cardio Pilates as in you focus so much on the move that your heart rate naturally goes up and the sweat pours! I also liked that there was no set time or number count for a move. It felt fluid that way and I had to dig deep not knowing the end. Granted there was always a pause between exercises and she did a great job saying when each move was finished. If you’re suspect about this workout i recommend you give it a try 😀,Kelly Pantaleoni,2019-03-27T14:27:40Z,3

"There were some great new moves in here and I thought I got a good body workout although did not get super sweaty. But I thought Brittnee could have given a lot more instructions throughout the video for these new moves either just before starting or even during the move, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what the move was. Also a countdown or even intro to what the circuits are composed of is always appreciated, this goes for all workouts!

"This workout is great for beginners, but more advanced people might want to look at alternative popsugar videos.  The pace is slow, and the lack of countdown can be unnerving, but it&#39;s a good way of teaching yourself to push through and not depend on the clock :) I do wish Popsugar would label their videos for different levels. I only have 30 minutes a day to workout and finishing without feeling like I did much is frustrating. This is nothing against the instructor, more constructive criticism as a whole. I love Popsugar and that addition would greatly improve people finding videos that work for them and becoming more faithful followers",Veronica Jean,2019-03-25T11:36:11Z,16

I&#39;m towards the end of blogilates&#39; 100 abs challenge and saw this workout. I&#39;ve been thinking about doing a POPSUGAR Fitness workout when its published. I&#39;m so glad I started off doing this one. Brittne Babe is so encouraging and offered a great no-weight workout.  This was doable but challenging and did not seem like 30 minutes long. I feel so great afterwards. Awesome workout!!,Phylicia F,2019-03-24T23:41:15Z,1

Does this workout reduce butt size? Does this have effect on butt area,Anitha Purushothaman,2019-03-24T16:47:23Z,0
"@Anitha Purushothaman with proper diet, this workout will make your butt area look rounder and perkier. If you do not have well developed muscles there, once you lose weight your butt might get flat and flabby, so doing workouts like this helps. The only natural way to increase breast size is to gain weight, but you would gain weight in other body parts as well.",ugne,2019-03-24T20:22:18Z,2

@ugne is this workout helps to lose fat in butt area with proper dieting??,Anitha Purushothaman,2019-03-24T19:35:52Z,0
"Fat can be stored in the butt area, which will make it look bigger, but you can also train the muscles there, which will make them bigger and the butt will look bigger as well. However, you can lose fat by eating healthy and/or exercising, which will make the butt (as well as  other body parts) to shrink and then &quot;rebuild&quot; it by strengthening the muscles there. I promise that training your butt area and losing fat (if you need to lose fat) will make it look nice, not too big at all. Hopefully this helps :)",ugne,2019-03-24T16:54:24Z,2
