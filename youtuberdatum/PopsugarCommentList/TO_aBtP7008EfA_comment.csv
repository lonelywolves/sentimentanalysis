"This is such a fun uplifting workout, did it a few times now. Just one small thing I keep tripping up on is &quot;walk like an egyptian&quot;. I know it&#39;s the name to an older dance move and means the hieroglyph drawings, but it sounds stereotype-ish and just a bit off. Still, thank you for the workout :)",Tiger Lilly,2021-05-01T17:43:14Z,0
"Such an Inspiration .. I am a Zumba Fitness Instructor in the UK .. Since undergoing major breast cancer surgery 3 years ago.. I got back  to teaching my classes within 6 weeks of my mastectomy.. but with steroids and hormones.. ended up gaining 3 stone in weight  in the last 3 years .. despite 5 high intensity classes per week .. plus clean eating and lots  of walking ... I still have this same energy.. and a passion for dance fitness.. If you have a passion and can be an inspirational teacher... and obviously you love to dance ..,who says you have to conform to size ... If you’ve got it ... you’ve got it ...",Jackie Goodwin,2021-04-30T22:03:00Z,0
I’ve always heard that to truly stick to working out you have to find something you love to do. I love weight lifting but can’t get to the gym everyday and having been a dancer in the past flexibility is important to me. I’ve literally never done something more fun than this workout and it inspired me to find more Plyojam videos and definitely more from Stacey cause she’s so fun and motivating - it made me truly enjoy working out at home!!,Stevie Nichole Monteiro,2021-04-29T20:02:27Z,0

"Who thought this video was a good idea? The music sucks, it’s not loud enough to hear. The moves are basic and easy. I haven’t been working out that long, 2 months maybe. Most videos I do I need breaks and modifications. But with this video my heart rate barely got up. If there was a hard move like a puddle jump or a side lunge there was only like 2 of them before they moved onto another move. Usually I feel accomplished after a workout, after this I feel like I waisted 30 minutes of my time. Also who’s idea was it to not show the moves before or not teach them at all? How the fuck am I supposed to follow along and give it my all when I don’t know what coming how hard would it have been? Really? Also the lady in front was wearing black so I had a hard time distinguishing what her legs were doing. I won’t be watching popsugar anymore because I really dislike your format. It’s unorganized, haphazard and low key kinda idiotic. I don’t know who though this was a good idea but they should be fired. Plus all the dialogue is really fake. Like these people aren’t even trying to be genuine. Y’all made this video bad in every way possible. Congratulations",Purrhead,2021-04-03T16:04:03Z,0

"It’s not that I’m trying to be negative, but this workout was kinda frustrating. She only explained like one move then expected us to do the rest and follow. She is expecting us to understand exactly what she is doing?! It’s annoying. Like- maybe explain each move and do sets. That would be a lot better.

I made the decision after seeing and doing this once that I would do this workout as my premier workout until I could do the whole thing through without stopping.  For me I&#39;ve been told I need to lose weight because I&#39;m slightly overweight for being 17 and 4&#39;9.  I also have chronic ankle issues and arch issues which makes it hard to exercise in general.  I move the wrong way I might re-sprain my ankle and everything I do such as excessive standing causes severe pain in my arches.  But I don&#39;t like regular workouts cause I get bored fast.  This is entertaining and fun.  For the most part my ankle is fine but my arches always hurt when I do too much so I have to stop for a minute.  I figure eventually I will be able to go through the whole thing.  And I have been able to get a little further doing a little more advanced stuff each time.  I do this workout practically daily and I absolutely love it.  Because I can&#39;t wear orthotics/my afo&#39;s while doing this because I need to be able to move my ankles it takes a little longer.  But I enjoy this workout so much.  I have been doing it for almost 2 weeks straight now.  And I feel like it&#39;s been helping a lot.,Ariana Smith,2021-02-03T19:50:32Z,0

"I really wanted to love this workout, but it was just too difficult for me to follow as a beginner with no dance experience. I also find it hard to follow instructors (especially with difficult dance moves) that are facing me.

"I loved this workout and signed up to PlyoJam, but unfortunately the workouts are not like this on the website - I couldn&#39;t even find these songs on any workouts.  They are mostly all the bubblegum pop like Taylor Swift and Bruno Mars type songs - not fun or motivating (like these ones are, these are edgy and fun, more of dance music than pop music).  And they have various instructors but I can&#39;t get into anyone other than Stacey or Jason who are both amazing, (the other female ones are too loud (yelling wooo a lot) or bouncy, kind of irritating although other people like them) so it limits the workouts even further for me.",Riot Girl,2021-01-09T14:46:34Z,0

"Loved it! I do have a suggestion for those of us who don&#39;t pick up dance moves quickly. A small window with someone doing the move from our perspective. Also, fewer moves to learn and more repetition before integrating the move into a composition. I stuck with it tho, laughing at myself half the time, as I&#39;m sure I resembled PeeWee Herman. ;)",sleone,2020-10-10T21:29:53Z,0

"It may be because your muscles just arent used to the movements yet.  Muscle memory will improve and eventually you will most likely be anticipating each move with more precision.  Its like that even with non dance workouts, kinda look like a a wobbly tree at first, then like 2 weeks later its almost like you made the work out routine.

"THIS WAS THE MOST AMAZING DANCE WORKOUT I EVER DID! I loved it! Seeing someone closer to myself made me think &quot;If she can do it, so can I!&quot; The level of difficulty was perfect for someone who is just starting out, but still want to challenge themselves. I felt so relaxed while doing it, and enjoyed just being comfortable in my own skin. I didn&#39;t feel ashamed at all! :D The leading lady gave it her everything (and looked so good while doing it) and that really inspired me do give it my everything. This was amazing! You will sweat while doing this, but it&#39;s still so much fun! :D Thank you so much for this.",Megan Hendry,2020-08-25T09:58:04Z,0

"I have been yo-yo-ing with my weight since the last 6 months and I FINALLY made up my mind to start working out again today. I’m so glad I did. Even the “easy” one made me sweat and I’m so glad that I can progress slowly into an advanced level in this. I’m also really glad that this video accommodated all shapes and sizes. Anytime I workout with really skinny people, I feel so discouraged thinking it’s probably so hard for me because of my size. Thank you so much. I promise to come back here everyday and give myself this 30 mins to de-stress. You’re right. I do deserve this! Thank you Stacy/Stacie.",Jinnie Pangliya,2020-06-03T02:33:03Z,0

"The only thing that really bothers me is the description that it&#39;s going to burn a lot of calories. Exercise, especially when it&#39;s body positive, is not supposed to be about body modification or punishing a body for eating food but celebrating what your body at that current state and moment can do. It&#39;s so hard to find body positive and anti-fat workouts and this one was almost there.",Shannon Germain,2020-06-01T08:36:14Z,0

"My initial thought when I watched this video was, &quot;this looks super fun, but doesn&#39;t look that much intense workout. Will I burn enough calories after the 30 minute routine?&quot; <br />My thoughts after completing this routine, &quot;Wow! That was super fun and enjoyable dance workout! 30 minutes passed in a blink and I didn&#39;t feel like I need to stop. And guess what? I burned almost as many calories I would in a 25 minute intense tabata cardio routine, that would just leave me huffing and puffing, and my body would beg me to stop!&quot; <br />Thank you so much for this routine, even though I had difficulty following and coordinating a few steps.",Sunetra D,2020-04-10T17:54:56Z,0

I would just like to point out that I have been doing online Plyojam workouts for a couple of years.  I actually stopped one of my online dance subscriptions because the trainer was unrealistically thin (based on my shape) and looked immaculate with groomed hair, and designer workout gear.

"@PlyoJam Hi,<br />Yes, weight loss - that&#39;s exactly what I mean. 100%.<br />If, on the description, you had explained &#39;I lost 40lbs....&#39;, I would be inspired. <br />I see people who work out every day and they remain the same weight; that&#39;s not inspiring to me at all. <br />We cannot see inside somones body, so your heart and lungs cannot inspire me - only my own heart and lungs capacity can do that...and I can get those two benefits plus inspiration elsewhere. <br /><br />Yes, this is my opinion. My truth. My fact. <br /><br />Congrats on the changes. That&#39;s amazing news! I know a few people who will be inspired by your video! I&#39;ll send them here. <br /><br />Take care.<br /><br />P.S. Don&#39;t be discouraged.",Aalpha Splatt,2019-08-16T08:30:21Z,1
"Hello there Aalpha Splatt.  What do you deem as &quot;working&quot; in fitness?  Do you only measure it by inches and pounds?  If that&#39;s the case, then I suppose you could say that this workout doesn&#39;t &quot;work.&quot;  However, I measure health and being in shape by many things including the 40 lbs I&#39;ve lost, my excellent blood pressure, my blood work that shows healthy cholesterol levels, my ability to teach a 30 minute class under hot lights with a microphone and talk and jump throughout.  I think it is a matter of opinion and I look forward to the day our society looks beyond JUST a body type to decide what is healthy.  Best of luck and I hope you find the perfect workout and instructor that inspires you greatly!  Warmly, Stacey",PlyoJam,2019-08-16T01:10:24Z,0

"Ummm Christina forgot her part. She wasnt modifying at all. Modifying is showing alternate ways, like with grapevine doing just side by side steps for people (and there are many) who dont get it or struggle because of weight to get their legs to do all that, instead of all the bouncing and jumping she was doing she could have stepped left right left right to &quot;MODIFY&quot; but no she jumped and bounced. Idk i find it so important to make the workout INCLUSIVE for everyone. Alternate less stressful moves. The trainer did more modifying than her. Next time please make sure your modifier knows the modified moves. Be fair so everyone who wants to try it doesnt get discouraged because the moves are too difficult. Otherwise great workout.

"@Juli Saragosa There&#39;s nothing wrong with trying to lose weight if someone wants to do so, as it makes everyday life easier and reduces the risk of complications like arthritis later on in life. Even if you&#39;re like Stacey and are already pretty healthy, the extra mass puts more stress on the joints with each movement, which over a lifetime builds up. Just acknowledging that wanting to lose weight isn&#39;t toxic in the slightest and may act as an inspiration boost to those who need it.<br /><br />If people are comfortable as they are, that&#39;s great. If people want to change their weight, that&#39;s great too, and more power to them to do so. Big or small, everyone is valid and deserves love and acceptance.",Paula,2021-02-04T16:17:57Z,0
"@PlyoJam Yeah, it&#39;s great to see - I was going to share it with some friends of mine in the fat-positive movement, but then you said something like &quot;this is a great way to burn calories and lose weight.&quot; Why?

"I enjoyed this video overall. I loved seeing someone lead the group that looked like me!! I could have done without the comment about you being “unhealthy” and “overweight” before joining Plyo. It’s fine for everyone to have their own body autonomy and opinion of their bodies/health but where I have difficulty is when you share it on a public platform. You have people doing this video in bodies  larger  than you. They hear you making those comments and may think they also need to lose weight or move like this to be “healthy”. Many people don’t have the ability or to move like this—as an aside, I would love to see even more body diversity for workouts. Research shows that weight is not actually an indicator of health.  Correlation is not causation babes. Maybe next time there could  only be a comment about how much you enjoy plyo and how good it makes you feel and leave it at that? Bodies don’t need to change or be different to be worthy or acceptable :) which I think and hope was your message.",giltra1,2021-02-15T16:40:30Z,0

Oh this was so fun! I had knee surgery this year and Im not allowed to jump for a few months. But this was totally perfect for me. Challenging and heart pumping without pain and I was able to actually enjoy the modifications. (Let&#39;s be honest - a lot of modifications for cardio videos are SO boring- basically just squats for half an hour). Also I love Stacey!

"I&#39;m sorry, but this is sad. The instructor is clearly out of shape and barely moving at all, compared to the girls in the background - this is not burning &#39;a ton of calories&#39;. Plus, the last thing an obese person should be doing is jump around and put more stress on her knees. This is bad advice and a bad workout. I know I&#39;m goint to get hate from the &#39;body positivity&#39; crowd, but I don&#39;t care. This isn&#39;t helping anyone.",Lesnooch,2019-07-29T08:48:18Z,3
"Hey there Lesnooch.  Sorry this video made you sad. I&#39;m definitely not out of shape, although I was certainly breathing hard while shooting this workout because it&#39;s hard doing all that cardio while simultaneously talking and cueing under hot lights.  I&#39;ve lost 50 lbs with PlyoJam, I&#39;ve removed myself from a pre-diabetic state, lowered my cholesterol and reduced my high blood pressure. HUGE SUCCESS! And my amazing back up dancers are 13 and 10 years younger than me.  I love that the three of us are showing all levels of fitness, shape, size and age.  I combine this workout with lots of stretching and strength training and my body, joints and knees have become so strong! As far as calorie burn, our students burn a TON of calories in a class.  I would encourage you to try it while wearing a Fitbit or Apple Watch and see how many calories you burn.  GO ALL OUT!  And then report back!  Have fun!",PlyoJam,2019-07-30T18:27:56Z,4

Lesnooch maybe you should come to one of her classes. She’s is amazing. It’s at rock it dance studio. It’s an hour plyojam class. Not 30 minutes but a full hour of hard cardio. You burn up to 600 to 800 calories. Don’t knock it until you try it.,p worthy,2019-07-30T07:15:53Z,3

"Hi there!  Most of my students burn between 500-800 calories in a one hour class!  So I&#39;d say 200-250 calories in 30 minus is very accurate.  Of course it really comes down to weight and heart rate. If you go hard, you can totally scorch 300-400 calories in 30 minutes!

"Hi Plyojam!Wow!Thank you so much for your time. My sister is having a hard time losing weight after miscarriage and she was really inspired when she saw you in the video. She made it through the 20minutes , paused for 10 minutes but finished it with a smile. She told herself, She can do it! I can do it!. It was really fun. Again, Thank You.",Strong Momma,2019-07-31T02:01:39Z,1

"I enjoyed this one. Can I do a body roll? Nope. Can I roll my hips and turn? Nope. Can I roll my hips at all? Not really. I&#39;m super clumsy but I own it and sometimes I just kind of jog in place until I can figure out what we&#39;re doing. Not every PopSugar workout is my thing. I&#39;m more of a MMA-inspired workout person. This is something I discovered ON THE POPSUGAR YOUTUBE CHANNEL. I give every workout a shot and sometimes I&#39;m like oh no way. But I figure for every one of my &quot;oh no ways,&quot; there&#39;s somebody saying OMG this is what I&#39;ve been looking for! Just saying. These videos are free and great even when they&#39;re not my favorite.",Angela Spore-Allen,2019-07-28T23:11:48Z,37

"Great job!!!! Plyojam is so amazing!!! I don’t like to work out. Stacey has been an inspiration to me. I go to every plyojam class she’s teaches. The music, the vibe, and the dances are amazing!!!! I burn a ton of calories and sweat my booty off.",p worthy,2019-07-28T20:25:26Z,10
You are so lucky! There are no Plyojam classes in my area. I would so love to go to one. Maybe one day I&#39;ll get to CA and take one of Stacey&#39;s classes 🌈,Kerry Melanie,2020-04-19T20:20:12Z,0

"I&#39;m pretty sure that Popsugar doesn&#39;t have any problem with people telling them what they want to watch. I&#39;m sure they also have the numbers for all of the videos so they know what most people want from them by now. I&#39;m pretty sure that they want to include a wide range of workouts, but there have been a ton of dance routines lately. Asking for a different type of video doesn&#39;t make people entitled, demanding it and expecting to be listened to without considering other people want does. I saw one comment that suggested that the videos here haven&#39;t been great, the others just asked for a different type. That one person wasn&#39;t demanding anything, just stating a fact. So while your statement is fine, it&#39;s not like there&#39;s any comments here to direct it to. Your statement does make it seem like there&#39;s more negativity in the world than there is though and we don&#39;t need that.",C Baelz,2019-07-30T19:04:51Z,12

Great video! Implementing dancing makes it more fun and motivates me more. I just started working out and trying to be healthier and more fit. This video popped up and I was like let me check it out. So glad I did. I will be doing this video atleast 2x a week along with going to the gym. Thank you.,Rena young,2019-07-28T16:39:30Z,20
