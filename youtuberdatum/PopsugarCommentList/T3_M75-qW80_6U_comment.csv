"I did this workout this morning and the moves got my heart rate SPIKED up!! The muscles in my whole body felt worked and energized. I was breathing hard, but I was refreshed!! The meditation towards the end was a bonus! Love this workout! Will definitely do it again if I am short on time but still want to work💖",Roselline Joy S. Wang,2021-02-01T13:20:45Z,40

"Such amazing workout. I love the meditation words. <br /><br />“Begin to imagine your stress so small, that It can fit in the palm of your hand. Imagine that you are so much bigger  then your stress because you are. Now, picture yourself giving wings to your stress, imagine your stress as a bird, ready to take flight. Allow yourself to fly away, let go of it as it travels off into the distance where it no longer has any power over you. As the stress gets further away and you can barley even see it  or feel its presence any more, I want you to now imagine your passion , your stress, your love, your peace, all replacing that bird that has carried away your stress.  You get to choice passion, strength, love, peace, and all of the other good feelings you deserve. As you go about your day, continue to embrace the good and know that you have the power.”",Green Is The New Lean,2021-02-26T13:51:51Z,4
