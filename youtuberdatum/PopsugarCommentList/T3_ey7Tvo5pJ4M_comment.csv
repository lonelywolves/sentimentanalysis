"I found this workout had some flaws:<br />1. Too repetitive. Repeating a circuit twice is less boring. Three times just makes me bored and my muscles fatigue and cramp. <br />2. Too static. My quads were cramping bc of the lack of mobility with these moves. Plus no stretching between circuits.<br />3. Rough on knees<br /><br />Overall glad I did it (with lots of my own modifications) but won&#39;t be doing this one again. I prefer the dynamic, fun, and very effective moves of Kit Rich and Marnie Alton.",Heidi Slack,2021-02-02T18:47:25Z,0
