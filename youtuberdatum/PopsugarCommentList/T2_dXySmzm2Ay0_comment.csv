This workout has truly helped me to regain my flexibility. As a female nearly 50 yrs old. I found my body becoming less flexible over the last few years which was scary for me because I was always super flexible.  Thank you for this amazing deep stretch video.,Crystal Foos,2021-05-06T16:52:55Z,0

"I fully enjoyed this practice. It threw me for a loop when the practice was inspired by T, I’ve never heard that before and was genuinely interested. But as a Yogi who’s been practicing for 10 years, it’s very easy to get stuck in a practice, a sequence, or just get used to your own movements. Those some of these pastors were a pretty intense on my knees first thing in the morning, I made sure to use modifications. My body feels warm, and I feel fully present in the practice, my intention being to spend time in a space that serves me.",Thai Maat,2021-03-13T14:11:51Z,0
"Thank you for the flow, but at least for me, it was way to fast and I think also your asanas would have needed more time. The way you rush through the asanas has little to do with the yoga I love. I really hope there are no inexperienced yogis trying to to yoga with this. <br />But thank you for the flow !",Tamara Kaiser,2021-03-10T06:35:23Z,0
"I am definitely  warm , I loved this. I was a beat behind you but I like that I kept my pace and listened to my body while also following your flow.",🖤💕💐🌺🌹🦜☘️,2021-03-06T11:29:32Z,0

I wish her transitions would have been better. She was sitting and said to place your hands on your mat then she was in downward dog with no explanation of getting there. I&#39;ve done a lot of yoga and transitions mean everything.,Bethany Goodpaster Bragenzer,2021-02-18T12:37:57Z,0
