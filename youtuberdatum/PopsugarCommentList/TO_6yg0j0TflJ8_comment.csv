"I am a Deja fan, but I didn‚Äôt care fit this workout. I didn‚Äôt mind the click talk, but the choreography was very awkward. It didn‚Äôt flow. Also, when Deja taught the move with the chase, then two twist jumps, when she boogied around to fro t with 4 steps, she used her inside leg. But when we did this move again after the ab section, she used her outside leg.  It really through me off and felt even more awkward.",Barbara Vezos,2021-01-02T18:23:09Z,0

PopSugar does way too many dance workouts now.  The scripted conversation between the girls was so robotic and awkward sounding.  They sounded exactly like they were reading off cue cards.Not really what I like when I workout.  All this said...I have been an avid fan of PopSugar.

"PopSugar has a lot of amazing workouts. This isn&#39;t one of them. It&#39;s way too easy/slow, and and the product placement was so overt and awkward that it was distracting. I felt badly for the women in it that they had to say the lines they were given. For a great cardio dance workout, PopSugar&#39;s Island Vibes, Cardio Latin Dance, or Hip Hop Tabata are all fantastic.",Joanna Cohen Greenstein,2019-11-22T16:07:15Z,0

"Per my Apple Watch ;) I burned 160 &quot;active&quot; calories. I was really excited about doing this video with you checking your watches, because generally I burn about half of the calories that the video says you will burn, I usually do all of the &quot;advanced&quot; moves or at least most of them. Half way through I was pretty close to you,  but at the end you were over 200 and I was still under. My total calories were around 200 but my watch doesn&#39;t consider &quot;total&quot; calories for my daily goal. Does the Galaxy watch measure active and total calories? Thanks for the workout. The routine was well choreographed and I liked the ab exercises.",Reveal Marketing,2019-11-13T00:47:16Z,1

J√∫lia Castro Expressing how you feel isn‚Äôt mean. No one is being disrespectful here. If you were the instructor and people stopped coming to your classes (channel) wouldn‚Äôt you want to know why? People have the right to disagree or dislike something with honesty and respect which is what is happening here. I found this workout one big infomercial and ineffective in my precious cardio time. Popsugar needs to know that several people feel that way so they can know why I won‚Äôt watch this instructors videos anymore.,Cynthia Nelson,2019-11-16T14:45:57Z,0

I search for new workouts and workout channels every week and always seem to come back to POPSUGAR Fitness. Their workouts are effective and fun and I prefer longer videos (30-45 min) instead of the short ones targeting only one muscle area. <br /><br />And the most important reason for me is that this channel isn‚Äôt as superficial as the usual pilates/workout-channels out there. The name of the videos are not ‚Äúget a sexy butt in 6 minutes‚Äù or ‚Äúget long lean legs like *insert celebrity with natural long lean legs here*‚Äù. When they reference to a celebrity it‚Äôs to show that the personal trainer is really good (so good that celebrities with a lot of money pay them to train them) and not to make us believe that we will look like the celebrity if we do the workout. At least that‚Äôs how I see it. I just want to give this channel cred for being about working out and feeling good.,Hanna Jansson,2019-11-12T13:09:19Z,9

I can&#39;t do the dancing workouts I&#39;m too uncoordinated to focus on getting the moves down plus actually getting a good workout with good form ü§£,Ix Chel,2019-11-10T17:30:58Z,25
I usually re-do the dance workouts a few times to try to get them. If they&#39;re fun I put them in my playlist and re-do them now and then.,Alexandra Panico,2019-11-20T09:42:29Z,1

@PlanWithRaven thanks for the advice.. I actually might try that.,Ix Chel,2019-11-10T18:57:32Z,1

How much calories can we burn?,Lisa Li,2019-11-10T17:19:25Z,4
It sounds like they burned about 200. They were checking the watches so I went by that. Pretty light. I don‚Äôt really rely on calorie burn for these and take a run on the treadmill after. I kind of just try these for fun.,S. Albertsen,2019-11-10T21:53:41Z,2
