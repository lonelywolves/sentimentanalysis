Ok so I’m 54yrs old and I want to start going to classes to do this .so I managed to get thru this video ( although maybe not looking as beautiful as you 😬😂) and I actually enjoyed it ( don’t know how my legs will feel tomorrow tho !!) I think I’ll be ok in a class 😃,Maureen Jessica Mary,2021-05-03T23:16:43Z,0

I had a subscription to Openfit with her. Great barre and Pilates workouts but there are limited workouts.  Either you do the same ones every month or you switch up to something harder on your body.   Love her workouts.  She packs a lot into 30 min.,Lucky Me,2021-04-24T10:35:57Z,0

"It was great, but even though I exercise daily, I couldn&#39;t do a lot of positions, but with time and practice I&#39;ll get there. I&#39;m 65, closer to 66, where there is a will, there is a way. Thank you Andrea.",Susan DeAngelis,2021-04-14T15:20:00Z,0

This was awesome! I did ballet all since I was three until I was eighteen and doing these workouts make me feel so good and happy since it incorporates a lot of ballet. I feel like I am in ballet class all over again! They make me feel graceful and elegant and elongated since I am not as tall. It was really challenging but in a good way! I love doing barre so much!,Abbey Marie George,2021-03-05T22:53:48Z,0
This has nothing to do with the actual barre. Why call it barre workout?  Its just a workout. I want the ballet...as in why I purchased a barre,Dee Banks,2021-03-01T04:36:59Z,0

Andrea Leigh Rogers is a TOP QUALITY instructor. She will kick your ass in a good way. Great philosophy and demonstration of prioritizing form. And she&#39;s totally lovable!,Ms. Dinari,2021-02-09T04:09:28Z,3
Great workout (holy legs!!) quick note on equipment tho - you won’t need to grab extra weights because she never ends up using them or telling you when to. And card table chair worked just fine for the barre,Miranda Roberts,2021-02-09T00:03:45Z,0

"I love barre and usually workout to Marnie Alton videos but thought I&#39;d try this for a change. I&#39;m sure the instructor is great but I simply could not get into this workout. I felt the flow was off, she spoke too much and that makeup was unrealistic. I know a lot of folks loved this workout but it&#39;s a pass for me.",Kim Dias,2021-02-05T03:52:36Z,0
