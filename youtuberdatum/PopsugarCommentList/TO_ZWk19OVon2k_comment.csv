Couldn&#39;t find a physical activity that could be fun for me so long because monotonous movements quickly bore me and then I remembered one thing I enjoy - dancing! Hip-hop really revives every nerve and brings smiles to your face. I warmly recommend it to anyone who has fallen into the vicious circle of laziness.

"GOOD NEWS FOR MEN. This channel is obviously of interest to men. HAIR LOSS is also a topic of major interest to MEN so go to <a href=""http://www.bornagainhair.com/"">www.BornAgainHair.com</a> and learn about a NEW science which explains that the main cause of HAIR LOSS is not DHT but a blockage of BLOOD FLOW caused by a tight LOWER scalp layer. This causes DHT to be over-produced and only then it becomes the “ killer ” of hair. Normally DHT is good for proper hair growth and all male characteristics, so screwing around with reducing DHT is a BAD idea because it has serious consequences like ...IMPOTENCE. The OLD methods have failed because they focus only on DHT and not on the MAIN cause. <br /><br />We only go bald on top where this GALEA layer exists and only people with a very tight GALEA layer lose their hair. This method explains how to restore the blood flow properly with a NEW massage technique that is totally different from how it was done before and how to REVIVE dormant follicles with a device invented by NIKOLA TESLA which we were told was not possible…that’s FALSE . This method is common sense and it uses NO DRUGS, NO LOTIONS and NO SURGERY. <br /><br />Do not be distracted by the very amateur looking website. I was very BALD and CURED my HAIR LOSS with this totally NEW method, as have over 27,000 other people. Do not waste any more time with the OLD ideas. Check out this new ALTERNATIVE science at <a href=""http://www.bornagainhair.com/"">www.bornagainhair.com</a><br /><br />Do yourselves a favor and check this out for yourselves and do not be discouraged by anonymous Internet trolls who trash and dismiss something like this with personal insults and not one word  about the merits or substance of the science and logic behind this new idea.",Leon Maliniak,2020-08-05T22:04:13Z,0

i’ve genuinely never been more excited and motivated to do a workout. i tried another one that was a very typical at home follow along workout and i was so upset that i couldn’t follow along i started crying (multiple times) throughout it. i’ve tried countless other “beginner workouts” and i’m not even gonna lie they suck and any endorphins i get from moving around are completely ruined by how uncomfortable i am while doing them. now i might cry because i actually found something that works for me and i’m having fun while doing it. it’s a disaster because i’ve never danced before a day in my life but god damnit i’m gonna learn this one! very very happy right now ☺️,Alex,2020-07-28T08:48:45Z,0

"Here&#39;s a little after math! ♥️<br /><br />It&#39;s been 20 days <br />since I started this workout, additionally... I just added 30 mins, yoga.... With ... Diet... <br />Not some strict food schedule, just... <br />Reduced the amount of food<br />Had more protein and fiber instead<br />With lots of water<br /><br />I have lost 4 kgs... I weigh 51 now...<br /><br />I usually don&#39;t comment, but this work-out program made me stick to it, ( coz it&#39;s fun) and also.. it was effective...!<br /><br />To be honest,<br />My stomach is bit toned, <br />Belly bloating has reduced...<br />Collar bone is visible...<br /><br />I&#39;ll update after a month I guess# <br />So.... GOOD LUCK WITH THE ONE WHO IS TRYING THIS OUT🔥 <br />YOU&#39;LL DEFINITELY SEE THE RESULTS 🔥🔥<br /><br />Both mentally and physically! ♥️<br /><br />Month 1 ... (Update)... <br />Guys I slacked off, was too lazy ..  haha..but guess what<br />I&#39;m 50 kg... although I didn&#39;t workout for like 20 days ... That&#39;s ... I guess!?<br />MAYBE ITS BECAUSE I DIDNT CHANGE THE DIET.....<br />So good luck again<br />I&#39;ll start with other workouts now ♥️",Insignificant T,2020-05-03T18:56:28Z,30

"I love Mike Peel. His moves are so energetic, friendly, and he didnt mind to repeat the moves over and over until I could memorize the moves (as I am a fully beginner and sucks at memorizing moves). Very few workout instructors do the moves over and over, instead they teach too fast with minimum repetition. Thanks!",Cecilia Josephine,2020-04-19T15:21:07Z,8

"when it says &quot;for beginners&quot; and you can&#39;t even do the stretches in the warm up....... Also this is the 3rd one i try from this channel and its just going way too fast, by the time i finally coordinated one move you guys are already doing new moves lmao maybe there should be a term other than beginners for people who have literally never danced before and have 0 coordination xD",mooh booh,2020-04-18T21:06:01Z,0

"My gym teacher assigned this to me over quarantine! <br />2 exercises used:<br />1- crunches<br />2- pushups<br /><br />What I liked: I LOVED the dance. I have no rhythm and practically have two left feet but after rewinding multiple times to really look at what was happening I finally got it and I felt so good! Even though it didn’t look as great as y’all I felt on top of the world<br /><br />What I didnt like: Nothing. I loved this whole video. The energy and explanations,  so good. I guess the one thing was the pushups because: ouch <br /><br />Anyways that’s my assignment 😂",Cheyenne,2020-04-03T22:56:57Z,0

I understand cause i am fat as well but I find the insecurity and the shame to be helpful because no one should ever be contempt with being fat. When it comes to workout videos seeing overweight people losing weight does help but maintaining health while fat is delusional. These workout companies just put these people just to make people feel better and do not really care cause if those fat people become healthy then they would fire them and replace them with another fat person.,Mr.420,2020-08-09T23:08:49Z,0

"I love everything about this routine! I&#39;m not a dancer, but the instructor was so easy and fun to follow. It didn&#39;t feel like a workout at all, I enjoyed every second of it. Great way to burn 250 calories! Thank you Mike!!",cha_hunsᅵ녹차훈,2020-03-03T13:06:39Z,5
"I don’t EVER comment on videos but I’m staying consistent with this video and walking. I am currently 390 &amp; to say I’m not proud is an understatement. My goal for THIS MONTH is to get down to 300 and keep working from there. If you guys have any tips, tricks or advice I would gladly appreciate wish me luck on this weight loss journey!!!",Miracle Bradley,2020-03-03T01:59:31Z,1

"If you usually drink soft drinks, switch to diluted juice or maybe completely to water/flavored water (totally easy if you put a twig of mint in there) :) It makes a big difference already!

I&#39;ve already done my share of workout for the day but I can&#39;t wait to try this tomorrow.  This is my go-to workout video forever (or at least until I reach my goal). It focuses on all of the body areas and I must mention that you can actually carry these dance moves in the club.  I know I sure will take it there.  Lol.

I have asthma so every time I workout I have terrible problems breathing and I&quot;m always out of breath soooo fast. But what I love about this is that everyone has a different body type and I do the modified/ slower version of this because of the beautiful thic girl on the left. I&#39;m watching her the whole time and doing what she does. It makes it so much better and I&quot;m able to actually do it! Thank you for this!,Storm Lee,2019-12-08T17:44:35Z,0

It shows that you lost weight. Here&#39;s my progress so far. Currently at 163.4 lbs aiming to get to at least 140 then make my way down to 120. Wish me luck!

"You have to Understand something. I was a club kid and a raver and love to dance and about 2009 I quit.   Long story. But I had a ball for years before it.  You  know white man’s boogey  to house music was my thing. Still I loved it and miss dancing.  So now that I’m 47 and I listen to hip-hop and trap and all of that I often wish I could dance to this music the way I want to dance to this music I have not had this much fun with my curtain shut my door locked and many many many years and I’m sweating like a sailor on shore leave.   I haven’t sweated like this in a long time, not have I enjoyed working out this much. I feel.... freer.  I’ll be back. Merci mille fois.",Kevin-Douglas Olive,2019-07-30T00:29:11Z,1

"@MzParka People do lose weight at different rates... but a 40-pound weight loss on a 220-lb person in three weeks is physiologically impossible.  You would need to have a calorie deficit of almost -7,000 calories per day to achieve that.<br /><br />Three months... sure.  Three weeks?  No.",shannonlatimer,2020-04-30T16:44:16Z,4
"@shannonlatimer Actually, some people that are heavier tend to lose weight faster before they plateau. So it&#39;s not impossible. My best friend is like that. He could lose weight in the blink of an eye and all he did was exercise and eat healthy. Nothing drastic. Every body is different no matter what doctors say. I used to be like that too but then....had a baby. 😒",MzParka,2020-04-30T13:45:43Z,2

"I am 65 years old; I take Zumba class and one day I asked the trainer if we can have hip hop.... she answer “ we have adult class and they won’t like it” now I saw a video completely , make me feel so good, they do not have the perfect body; they are young but I am sure I can do it. Thank you for this",Maria Rocca,2019-07-13T22:54:14Z,157
"Reggaeton and Dance Hall... Soca...there are so many dance forms that are similar to Hip Hop. Like music, various dance genres have their roots in Africa. I&#39;m glad you look further than your trainer who told you adult classes wouldn&#39;t like hip hop. I teach people of all ages and abilities, including seniors at the Calabasas Senior Center. One class is Zumba Gold and the other is Dance It Out or Dance Express. I do not go easy on them. Maybe I&#39;ll do something 8X instead of 4X. Maybe I&quot;ll avoid too many turns.  I do offer modifications and make sure that anything I&#39;m recommending they do is safe. That said, there&#39;s no reason why I shouldn&#39;t be teaching them Hip Hop, Belly Dance, Burlesque, Bollywood. . . I also vary my music and include songs from many eras, including present-day music.  Everyone loves it!!! It&#39;s Zumba Gold, not Zumba Old or Zumba Moldy. Everyone needs to try new things to keep their bodies and brains challenged - honestly, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23whocares"">#whocares</a> is my main motto. Who cares if you don&#39;t get the moves just perfectly right? Who cares if you go the opposite direction? Who cares if you&#39;re not as flexible as the other person?

I never comment on videos but i have to make an exception for this one. This is my favorite workout on the Popsugar page. I just started working out again a few months ago and Mike’s positivity and personality has me coming back to this workout over and over again! I do this workout at least twice a week and I cry at the end every time he gives his speech. It’s so rare to feel acknowledged for the hard work and he puts it perfectly. <br />I’m really hoping to have way more videos featuring Mike!!! He’s precious and this video is an absolute gift! More please! ❤️❤️❤️,Olly Murphy,2019-05-15T01:39:42Z,3

When the cooldown period came i felt crappy cause i was breathing so hard and sweating sooo much. I just felt horrible about how out of shape i was but Mikes speech at the end was amazing and he&#39;s right i should feel more positive because I got through the whole thing. When the dance was over and he started talking about sit-ups and crunches i was about to turn it off and figured id done enough. But i pushed through and did stick it out. This is a great video! i genuinely had fun with the dance and the workout mikes confidence and calming voice really helped push to the end !!!,First Name,2019-05-02T11:46:07Z,0

"Great workout! I love it, but there is only one small issue. You forget it&#39;s a mirror effect so we can&#39;t do it exactly the same. I got stuck on the movement with the right hand, only when I realised I have to use my left hand so that I can turn the way to see the screen. It&#39;s just this minor thing, I know it seems obvious for most of you but if someone doesn&#39;t dance so much, he or she might get confused. You have to make sure people opposite the screen can make it without any problems. Besides this, very positive and I want more :-)",Mag Nieg,2019-04-29T10:27:54Z,0

I understand there are others I can look at, but my eyes are usually peeled on the instructor and he stops at a crucial time when I need his lead. That part annoys me A LOT. It&#39;s a fun and interesting dance workout but the instructor needs to make sure he doesn&#39;t stop mid movement so that it doesn&#39;t throw anyone off. Love Popsugar and the diversity in this vid but thought I needed to leave some constructive criticism, especially since I love working out at home and want it to be the best workout for others that do too!",Vivian Lee,2019-04-12T20:24:05Z,0
"@Mike Peele Thanks for taking the time to read my thoughts! You are an excellent instructor but I did want to leave my two cents as I am sure there are others who feel this way. It was in no way to disrespect your workout or anything! It was still a fun and interesting dance and I did it as part of my workout. If it wasn&#39;t fun and effective, I wouldn&#39;t have done it, I just wish you didn&#39;t stop but I get that you need to encourage the dancers behind you as well. That was all. Thanks for a great dance workout!",Vivian Lee,2019-04-22T15:02:32Z,1
"Well I&#39;m the instructor and agree with what your saying. However I&#39;ve been doing this a very long, I give 100% to all my students and yes there are time when I stop and let everyone keep going but by that time everyone has and I want to push them not to depend on my the whole class. Its important  for people in class to get out of their head and have fun and keep it moving. Only time I stopped in the video on the dance was twice towards the end of the dance to show you got it and keep going and to encourage the dancers behind me. Thank you.",Mike Peele,2019-04-21T17:04:04Z,1

I had no idea how uncoordinated I was - it was tough to follow for me but I stuck it through! REALLY loved all the different body types you featured here and that no one tried to outshine Mike and his directions (I struggle with that in some other Popsugar fitness videos) or had disruptive commentary.

"Popsugar, thank you so much for doing and releasing a wide variety of workout videos. I&#39;ve always wanted to learn how to dance hip hop, but I never took the initiative to do so because I have zero rhythm. However, when I began to see the different dance workouts y&#39;all have I decided to go ahead and try them, and boy have I had a blast. I&#39;m definitively going to repeat them to practice and fully learn them. Please keep them coming!",Zandra N,2019-04-11T21:37:39Z,4

😆😆😆😆😆❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍👍👍👍👍 This was the best so far. The moves were easy to follow and the intensity was level medium but if you made your moves big you could easy get a high calorie workout. The workout is split into 2 parts. The second part is strength and toning LOVED ❤️ it. If you really want to challenge yourself I suggest doing it twice. I did and I definitely sweated.😅😅,Vibe Sista,2019-04-11T16:42:25Z,8

"I dont usually comment on videos, i usually just do it and then log off, but this one got me all the feels! I watched pretty much the whole video before i actually done it, thinking about how i cannot dance, how uncoridinated i am, how overweight i am, but then i saw the different sizes and Mike had such a calming voice i thought ill just do it, noone can see me. And you know what, i actually enjoyed myself. Right at the end of the cooldown, where Mike gets you to close your eyes, his little speech nearly made me cry. For someone who is suffering with depression and anxiety, and someone who constantly compares herself to others and has no confidence whatsoever his words are what i needed to hear today. So thank you to everyone at popsugar fitness for creating such a wonderful community, im so happy to have stumbled across your channel! &lt;3",Kayleigh Sandell,2019-04-10T16:14:36Z,1721
