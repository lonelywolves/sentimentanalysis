"Thank you so much Christa. These workouts are amazing - as someone who doesn&#39;t struggle too much with motivation but instead with putting too much pressure on myself or being &quot;mean to myself&quot; as you would say, I appreciate your message so much. I also find that because your workouts are so cerebral, they go by very quickly, even as I am drenched in sweat! Keep it up :)",Jen H.,2020-11-08T22:28:39Z,1

for those wondering whether to do this workout!<br />I was not expecting to sweat. It is great for all levels. I personally look for standing workouts due to wrist problems but this one had minimal burpees. But I love how she focused on proper form. Christa is amazing because she is so positive and fun.

"I really love Christa and love her other workouts. This one seemed a little repetitive in terms of muscle groups worked and I found it very hard to follow compared to her other videos. It&#39;s also only a 30-minute workout, not 40, FYI for those looking for a true 40-minute workout. I am glad her others are available and I think they&#39;re amazing and so is she!",e.frances.patterson,2020-06-05T19:23:59Z,0

"I love that I sweat a lot, and the punching and kicking. But I am one who likes rhythms, and most of her routines were not in a four or eight count rhythm, so I felt off beat, because there was no beat. But I sweated a lot. <br />The stretches I thought should always be held for a length of time, not over and over for 1 second. So I held the stretches instead of repeating. <br />And sweating is your body’s way of cooling down. I thought she would know.",Jessica Wall,2020-06-02T16:24:45Z,0

"Love Christa, her workouts make me feel like I am capable of anything and like a ninja! She&#39;s the best, most encouraging, supportive trainer. She&#39;s pure of heart, honest, true and kind.

There is so much variety on the platform, working targeted muscle groups, cardio, full body, equipment/non-equipment and love challenging both the mind and body. ❤️",Magda Sit,2020-05-25T07:25:27Z,4
