That was the most intense Kit Rich workout I&#39;ve experienced here on Popsugar. I am sweating buckets and not feeling guilty that I didn&#39;t go on my Sunday run. I am grateful for many things and your workouts are on my list!,MissLexi920,2019-01-20T19:41:19Z,192

"This was intense.  Just a note that it wasn&#39;t HIIT, which is what I was expecting when the words High Intensity were in the title. There were no 10-20 second breaks that I look forward to with HIIT. It had several unique moves, and was definitely total body.  I liked the reverse lunge flying into warrior three.  I also appreciated the standing pike, as I have diastasis recti, and can&#39;t do crunches on the floor.  I had to modify the one armed down dog into reverse fly, as it was rough on my shoulders.  Overall, it was a good work out.",Tiffany Bascom,2019-11-05T06:14:57Z,1

"Thanks Kit do enjoy your workouts another secret killer. One of my favs from you. Loved it being high intensity and quicker paced than some of your others. Love the popsugar classes too. <br />Loving the full body weight fusion ones for whole body. Prefer those over targeted workouts as I do one every day and a full body means I can confidently go on with day knowing I’ve hit every muscle.... <br />also just a personal preference but not as much a fan of your home live workouts, do prefer your studio environments- I feel a little more like being part of a class since I do home workouts instead of joining a gym... so love the ones you have done in the group studio and the ones on pop sugar... so keep those coming please...<br />Quick paced, high intensity cardio fusion full body workouts definitely my favs from you. <br />I know your busy, but would love more of these.

"No tea, no shade, but...<br />This instructor discourages you throughout the video by not participating and not giving clear enough instructions so that you can easily follow them.  Other instructors, like Anna, make it easier to workout more often with Popsugar, because of her attitude, corooperapion, and team effort.  Workout instructors that participate are much more liked and make you want to come back to this channel.  This workout instructor makes me very extremely mad, because if you aren’t working out with us, what are doing.  Instead of participating she was criticizing people who were actually doing the workout.  I love Popsugar and I watch their videos daily, but this instructor dipped my hips during my pushup.",Elli L,2019-01-31T04:11:41Z,0

Such a great workout!! Love all the videos here on Popsugar but this was one of my favorites. Love how motivational and positive Kit Rich was. &lt;3 So grateful to be going on this wonderful journey of holistic health and wellbeing.<br /><br />Side note: any tips for helping with wrist pain during some of the plank moves??,LovelyLissette,2019-01-24T23:52:38Z,0
"I would suggest when doing plank moves,  pressing into all 10 finger points of your hands. Making sure your wrists are underneath your shoulders and pressing out of your foundation with your hands when your in a plank. So when you&#39;re doing a plank move, your hands are not collapsing in and putting weight into your wrists. This is something I do that helped me stop the wrist pain, I hope that made sense!  x",freya,2019-02-08T12:39:04Z,0

But it is also so intense your heart rate will spike like crazy.  I was dripping sweat.  Full disclosure I have stated on here before that I am going through treatment for breast cancer and I am still doing surgeries and chemotherapy so I am not as fit as I once was, there were things that were so hard like the plank move where you hug yourself and move your arm out, I just do not have the strength yet. But even doing some modifications I loved the intensity of this workout.  ALSO very happy to see Dani back on the videos!!!",alicia biedermann,2019-01-22T00:32:01Z,0

Not such a great workout..it would help if the instructor talked less...difficult moves that require much balance (core moves ) ☹<br />I like the fact that it has <b>standing abs moves</b><br />Why is she not performing the moves herself?<br />.I like the strength workouts much more! And the ones with LoveSweat Fitness.<br />■ Would the butt/glute moves be bad if u suffer from <b>hip</b> and <b>lower back pain</b> ? <br />■ which <b>stretches</b>  should be done for hips butt and glutes after this workout?,Sandy vdh,2019-01-21T00:02:51Z,0

Plz make 1000 calories burn workout no equipment in 45 mintues.plz,vandana sharma,2019-01-20T17:45:48Z,31
DaytripDaisy you’d only burn like 300 cals...that’s not how calories work,Zoe N,2019-02-21T21:40:44Z,0
"If you simply go for a walk for 2 hours or 12 km you easily burn over 1,000 calories, listen to a podcast while you do it. Sorted",DaytripDaisy,2019-02-09T23:30:43Z,0
if that was how things happened then nobody then no one would even give their weight a thought bcause a pound is of in 3 days ; ),Sena Epeh,2019-01-28T01:48:01Z,2
hahah girl that&#39;s not how it works. That&#39;s not how any of this works.,Tímea Time,2019-01-21T20:03:58Z,9
"lol that&#39;s asking for trouble. If you want to burn 1 000 calories, you have to exercise hard for at least two hours, depending on how you burn it. Better to work out hard for 30 - 60 minutes a day a couple of days in a row instead. Letting your body rest and recover is just as important as exercising hard.",Emmaginative,2019-01-21T13:13:37Z,13
