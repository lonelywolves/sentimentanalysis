"Dear POPSUGAR team, you are making it so much easier for us in these challenging times.  The &quot;thank you&quot; phrase will never be enough to express how thankful we are for everything you do, corona or not. Youve been here for us always. Always smiling, always supporting, always lighting up our days. And now more than ever, people will be happy to sweat under your lead. So let&#39;s all sweat all the bad things out. Also, Hi Kit! Happy to see you again! &lt;3",Universal Universalium,2020-03-22T18:55:44Z,226

"I hate disliking hard work, but I had to stop this workout half way through after 8 ad breaks, rolling to the end. Absolutely awful.  It breaks flow, concentration and sweat. Sadly, this is not a happy workout, just a frustrating one, because of the interruptions.  We turn to the mat to escape.  I understand money needs to be made on ads, but this feels greedy.",Sara Starbuck,2021-02-22T10:17:46Z,0

This is my dream workout- Went by so fast! I have to comment because as a professional dancer and yoga instructor I really appreciate the way each move flows seamlessly into the next. The little stretch in between exercises sets her apart from the rest. Mindful + sweaty perfection! THANK YOU. PS- Don&#39;t be intimidated if you&#39;re a beginner- she gives modifications and amazing corrections to help everyone avoid injury.  10/10,Stephanie Stevens,2021-01-07T23:01:32Z,0

"As much as the moves are very good for a workout🤗, it&#39;s very uncomfortable to go all sweaty on the mat now and than. Unfortunatelly this is not the only workout video which involves going on the mat all sweatty.

"This might keep you healthy if your&#39;e already healthy, but if you have digestive issues like IBS, SIBO etc then too much cardio and /or intense ab work is not good, the way to approach healing digestive issues is with relaxation of the vagus nerve through meditation and/or healing the gut with dietary changes and supplements.",Just look at the Flowers,2020-12-24T11:42:58Z,0

"Kit&#39;s are my farvourite workouts because she truly makes the whole body work, and it is variable levels, so you feel it nicely that you&#39;ve done some work, but you&#39;re not so totally smashed and achy that you won&#39;t be able to continue with your day. I love it that after her workouts my whole body is warmed up, stretched and energized, and she always reminds you to be careful and listen to your body. Unlike some instructors who seem to think that killing yourself in the gym is the only way... I actually want to &quot;honour my body&quot;. Bravo Kit!",Alicja Pytlik,2020-10-20T07:53:09Z,0

"This workout was amazing. However, youtube has gotten insane and has started as a few weeks ago putting ads about every 3 minutes, literally. I know popsugar does not put ads in the middle of their videos, especially about 11 in a 33 minute video. I am not sure if POPSUGAR has a say in this, but if so, please tell youtube to lay off the crazy amount of ads. One or two, okay, but literally 11 is insane and is almost unwatchable because it cuts in the middle of moves. Thank you so much for the videos though, they really are amazing.",yanayanaland,2020-08-06T19:17:31Z,0

"Sooo I love thus work out! But just a thought as I’m icing my neck and shoulders... you should have someone who has never done this workout do it but only by listening, my point is if you actually want to get a good sweat in you can’t watch only listen, and if your only listening your most definitely doing the exercise wrong! Hence my neck injury!! Thus workout is impossible to do only by listening the correct way! Injuries are happening! Thus needs to be fixed!!!",JessMarie MakeupArtistry,2020-04-03T15:45:52Z,0

How many calories can I burn with this work out? My weight is 121lbs/55kg and height is 5’4ft/165cm,U C K,2020-03-22T20:48:36Z,2
"mizzkittylicous22, Thanks! Yes, in fact I figured the calorie burn rate should be in this range... higher than for a workout on an elliptical machine, where I burn ~230 calories in 30min... (at least for me it shows this figure)",U C K,2020-03-23T11:14:19Z,1
U C K not sure if this helps but I typically burn around 300 calories for a 30 min work out according to my watch. 40 min I burn about 400 and an hour work out I burn about 600 it can be more or less depending on heart rate and what not,mizzkittylicous22,2020-03-23T11:05:18Z,1
