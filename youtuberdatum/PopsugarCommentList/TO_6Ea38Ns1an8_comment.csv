I am pushing out negativity and pulling in abundance.” All of those affirmations were in these moves.  And end where we walked into our day as a queen and put the crown on our head.... yasssss.

She is my favorite instructor!! I tried doing one of her other island workouts and I could not keep up hahahaha,Tasiaa Nae,2020-04-08T01:45:29Z,3
I wish we could hear the music a bit more. I feel like it would be more fun and I could hear the beat more if the music was clearer.,Calais K,2020-04-07T17:28:27Z,136
This exactly also my problem. I always need the music to be loud and synchronized to the moves. Otherwise I am not enjoying it ;),G M,2020-11-12T08:06:55Z,0
AdoriAsia omg I wish I could do that but if the beats and the moves aren’t synchronized I just go nuts hahahah,Isabela Fogolin,2020-06-19T20:28:29Z,3
I agree! with the music a bit more loud it would be amazing! great class in any case.,lemonnade65,2020-05-10T12:09:23Z,2
one thing I like to do is play my favorite soca/dancehall mix if it&#39;s a Caribbean inspired dance. Try one of your favorite upbeat mixes and don&#39;t worry about the genre! Music is so flexible to your movements.,AdoriAsia,2020-05-04T21:52:16Z,6

"Not a very sweaty workout but very very good on the abs and the legs. I kind of disagree with the teacher that this really is not about work out, it’s a lot of legs and a lot of abs and great in that respect. Really like the style for a take it easy day that includes toning",Camden Smith,2019-07-22T23:42:54Z,2

I&#39;ve just finished this workout and I&#39;m sweating buckets :D I had to pause several times during the video and I felt a bit stiff. But that doesn&#39;t bother me. What&#39;s amazing is that I feel so feminine and so sensual. For the first time since giving birth to our baby. I&#39;m not a dancer, but I love dancing and I haven&#39;t danced since then. I forgot how great it feels. Thank you! Much love ❤️",Renata Sklarova,2019-07-03T16:38:23Z,4

NM said it will work better for me as a person who is a better fit and it was just my first date for your business is not good but it doesn&#39;t work out well and is a big part and I&#39;m a bit worried when I was a kid with it beau and a new basis is very much better at school so they decided they would make it work because they had a great idea about the kids they have had some success as they learn about being more time honored and I have a very important experience they&#39;d needn&#39;t as little help me with their help and understanding of a year and I want a good,Daisy Dunn,2020-02-03T21:56:47Z,0

"@Tu Abuela in an ideal world, I would agree that it shouldn&#39;t matter. Bur for people of color, in every sector of our lives (including fitness/the fitness industry) often times, we feel excluded. I won&#39;t speak for every other black person, because the degree to which we feel &#39;otherized&#39; in each sector ranges (example, I don&#39;t care that much if my fitness instructor isn&#39;t black/a person of color, but I care if the media I consume isn&#39;t fully/properly representative). But because of how I&#39;m impacted in those other sectors, I could understand how for fitness instructor of color could matter to someone else.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know where you are in the world, but I&#39;ll also note that in a society like what we have in the States, it&#39;s all the more important...",DukeCHUBBYDun,2021-04-27T11:39:56Z,0
