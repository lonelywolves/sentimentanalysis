"When I previewed this I thought “this is gonna be a breeze,” but now after doing this. I was wrong. It challenged me. It was intense and fun. I am impressed. Katie Austin is holding her own. She’s earned her way, not hanging onto the skirt tale of her mom’s name. Good for you. Keep it up and congratulations. Thank you for helping all of us to stay fit. Much Love from The Bahamas 🇧🇸",Vixen242,2020-09-20T10:29:02Z,9

"One of the best workouts I’ve done!!!! I love the quick pace and DIFFERENT exercises. However, it was distracting each time she stopped her work out to talk to the camera. And the ads… Seriously???!! 10 ads!!!!... which interrupted the work out. I would LOVE to continue with these workouts, but I don’t know if I can deal with the frustrations.",Kris Hendricks,2021-04-07T14:10:33Z,0

"I am someone who work outs on a daily basis, but this work out tired me up like no other. Loved it, it was intense, it was not boring, Katie´s energy is fun and pushes you to work your a$$ off",Ivanna Martinez,2020-11-30T16:24:24Z,0

"I love the workout, super fun and moderately challenging! I also appreciate that we didn’t repeat any moves 🙌🏻 that can get super boring / tiring with the HIIT format. My only negative feedback would be the surplus of ads! There were SO many and every time they came during a move so I had to stop halfway through to skip the ad. Very frustrating to workout that way, please front load them or do less. :/",Hannah Francis,2020-11-06T18:19:37Z,1

Loved the workout but am I the only one who feels more motivated when instructors do the whole exercise with you? Like I feel like she is cheating it&#39;s not fair you have to be a sweaty mess like I am 🤣,Aurora Schinetti,2020-10-06T17:00:35Z,1

Great workout but the frequency of ads is unacceptable!  Not sure if this Popsugar or Katie’s doing but no one will watch these live guest workouts if this is always the case.,Julie Christides,2020-09-30T11:03:20Z,2

Disqualification for putting the adverts every 5 mins. What an annoying idea. No thanks.,000MYSZ999,2020-09-23T20:34:06Z,25

"Amazing workout, amazing energy, her vibes, non-repeating moves, great format😍. Ads are total pain in the a** but she is so amazing I managed to not get pissed because of the ads 🤭♥️✨👌",Lea Adamič,2020-09-23T08:25:49Z,0
"So, I did love this workout,  and if it would be viewable as it was for the live I would have no complaints.  The ads, you guys! At least front load them or something because at one point in the middle of a move I got a 16 second ad, she was back on for 3 seconds, and then another 16 second ad. There were so many but that one really seemed unnecessary.  I have no knowledge on how ads work on YouTube but my other fave videos only have ads in the beginning. Just some feedback. I&#39;ll continue loving and supporting this channel and the trainers.",Kayla Colburn,2020-09-23T08:02:38Z,8
"How am I supposed to do a workout with 2 ads in between every 2 moves in the middle of the move???? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23neverpopsugaragain"">#NeverPopsugarAgain</a>",Anna,2020-09-23T07:08:39Z,9
