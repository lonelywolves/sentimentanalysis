"Love it @Phyllicia. So calming.<br />From lifting weights in the gym, through steady state cardio, HIIT, Pilates and now Vinyasa Yoga.<br />My cardio is so much better, I can run for the bus without being winded, and am almost able to touch my toes. Yes, my hamstrings, calfs and ankles are still tight, but not as tight. These classes have made such a positive impact on my boys and mind. You have helped with these changes, and for this I genuinely thank you.",Paul Stanley,2021-03-12T10:18:12Z,0

"4 ads is alot and very distracting. I thought the yoga workout was going to be more intense, this was too slow. This video is good for mostly relaxing though, but I which the music was a little louder. Could barely hear it.",Malika Mathis,2020-12-29T15:28:33Z,0

"I thought she had a lovely, calm demeanor. It&#39;s a yoga flow not a high energy cardio workout, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want an instructor being loud and exuberant.",rose/rose,2020-12-22T06:39:46Z,4
