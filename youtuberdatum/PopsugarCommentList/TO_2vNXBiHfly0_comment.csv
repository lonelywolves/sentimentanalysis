"Hi.. I am neither fat or skinny. I never was. But I always slouch and it make me look like I am lazy and have no joy in life. I don&#39;t like to see myself. Even if everybody around me say I am beautiful, I don&#39;t believe them. <br />I almost fell into depression after my first born. My husband told me to go to gym to get back some energy. But I resisted, thinking that if I see Instagram gym babes in real life, I will envy them and hate myself more. So I looked for workout excersize on youtube and found your videos. I did one months on and off excersize and I still feel nothing. Then I did 2 weeks excursion abroad and ate like a pig. Back home I realize I started to look bit round. My husband said that now that I get older my body doesn&#39;t metabolize things the way it was and if I don&#39;t change my way, I will ended up fat.<br />So i continued workout one months straight doing dance exercise (because that is what I like to do when nobody is watching). Slowly, I started to feel better about myself. I looked at myself in the mirror and feel some confidence. <br />I feel happy, fit, and I have goal now:<br />1. To be able to do push up<br />2. Have a bit muscle in my arm<br />3. Slimming my thigh and my baby pouch a little bit.<br />4. Firming my breast now that I have finished breastfeeding. <br />Thank you so much pop sugar<br />Oh and I just bought my first free weight (They are only 1 kgs 😂)",Ari Puji Astuti,2019-06-17T02:33:16Z,3
