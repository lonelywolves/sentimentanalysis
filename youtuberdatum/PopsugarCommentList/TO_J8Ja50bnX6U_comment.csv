Can I do this workout with playspeed in 2x. The normal speed is too slow for me.,Liza R,2019-10-06T19:14:55Z,0
"This was a great short workout where I burned about 200 calories, so I appreciated that. However the transition from the first section to the dance finale is to abrupt and very hard to follow. Since she changes up the way the moves are handled from one to the other it doesn&#39;t feel like a true progression. Aside from that definitely a good workout.",Heather Venard,2019-10-06T18:33:26Z,41
"Heather Venard Heather, thank you so much! I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed the workout &amp; I appreciate your thorough feedback üòÉ‚ú® I hope to keep dancing with you üíÉüèæ",Deja Riley,2019-10-06T19:35:01Z,4

"no! the final one is a NO, it comes too fast, making me frustrated, cant follow well, cause not so ready to do it with unexpected different moves. oops.",Liny W.,2019-10-06T18:10:12Z,113
"Liny...just march in place, or dance to the beat of your own drum...it&#39;s not that serious. You messed up your own vibe getting all upset, when all you had to do was dance like no one was looking...or maybe they were, who cares!",Queen,2020-08-22T19:53:39Z,0
"honestly im not a fan of any popsugar dance workouts and i really wish i was. they&#39;re too fast, and don&#39;t provide any explanation on how to do the moves beforehand, so its always a surprise what comes next",A s h l e y C,2020-04-12T19:48:17Z,3
"Yes!!!! It deffinatelly gave to me some feeling of NOT-satisfacton (with myself) in the end :), when couldn&#39;t follow the rythm !!! But! WE ROCK, GIRLS!! And should just give ourselves a winner dance in the end)",Natalia Denisova,2020-03-31T20:24:53Z,1
"ha, while getting dumb, I try to follow but can just keep stepping side to side and finish not so satisfyingly, otherwise it is good in the previous circuits.",Liny W.,2019-10-08T06:43:49Z,1
"Yeah, I definitely just jump squatted until the final sequence was over.",Kiera G,2019-10-07T23:06:10Z,5
