I have had a HORRIBLE day. I finished watching one of my favorite youtubers and your video popped up to watch next. I’ve never heard of you and I had zero intentions of doing anything like this tonight. This was amazing! I literally cried while doing this. All of the negative energy that I experienced today was so overwhelming. You are literally an angel. Thank you for all that you do. You just gained a subscriber❤️,Breezy Watson,2021-03-08T02:48:51Z,20
