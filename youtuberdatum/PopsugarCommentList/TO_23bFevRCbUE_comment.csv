"Just visited the site and huh? What an odd format. Let me get this straight: you either pay individually for random workouts, OR for a series of workouts ranging from 2 to 10 or so, OR there are monthly subscriptions for certain trainers? I think that’s what I saw, anyway. <br /><br />First of all, it’s extremely confusing. Secondly, why would I pay such premium prices for one workout or a few workouts when I could either <br />1. Pay monthly on a site or an app for many workouts or <br />2. Stay with someone like FitnessBlender that has tons of free workouts or where you can pay $9.99 for multiple 30 day workout series that  are super effective (and that you only pay for once)? <br /><br />I’m not sure where you guys got this convoluted idea from but it doesn’t seem like it’s been well thought out at all. There are so many legitimate workout sites already where I can pay a set amount for a lot of workouts. What exactly is the benefit here?",Oddness/Weirdness,2019-05-06T19:28:04Z,1
"Everyone has different preferences. I like Fitness Blender, but I had to stop for several reasons that I don&#39;t need to go into here. I am super excited about GLOW b/c there are so many different workouts by amazing instructors. I am pretty sure that it will be well worth the money. Whatever you decide, good luck with your fitness journey!",Lisa Marie,2019-11-16T01:24:18Z,0

"Hey, I paid for a subscription and glow stopped working a few days ago. I&#39;ve been trying to get in contact with Glow but no replies. Please get back to me or I&#39;ll be contacting my card company to reverse the charge. Thanks!",Aimee Hall,2019-04-19T10:10:15Z,0
Is there going to be an app for android too?,Amy Moore,2019-04-17T17:10:59Z,0
"I think we&#39;ve all been spoiled by the free workouts! I love them. I don&#39;t mind paying for a good workout subscription, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of downloading individual workouts. I&#39;d be happy to pay for a Popsugar Fitness workout app with a monthly subscription! I hope if we move to a paid format, an app would be available, opposed to downloads. I pay for YouTube premium now, just so I can get the Popsugar Fitness workouts uninterrupted.",JoLissa Kowalik,2019-04-15T23:11:53Z,1
"tbh, a good most of us stick to a few categories; in my case, anything by Jake Dupree, power yoga and bodycombat. Many of the workouts on this channel just don&#39;t do it for me because they&#39;re not intense enough, not fun enough, annoying instructor,  etc etc. <br />Maybe they should have a subscription service for those who eat up anything this channel serves and a one-off payment system for those who&#39;s tastes are more particular and otherwise wouldn&#39;t pay a subscription service. They&#39;ll get more money that way  and I won&#39;t have to pay for a bunch of faddish workouts just to get the good ones",Bvgger 0ff pls,2019-04-29T19:31:40Z,0

"I don&#39;t mind paying for workouts, but I wish it was a subscription. $19.99 or even $9.99 per workout sesh? Seems like a waste of money. I&#39;d be willing to pay $19.99 a month for a range of workouts, or maybe you should do different workouts for different price tiers that way people can subscribe based on what they can afford. Just an idea!",Kristen Rhodes,2019-04-12T06:58:51Z,10

Your workout videos are mostly cardio. Could you make something that doesn&#39;t lean so much towards cardio but still is calorie burning?,Benazir Hiya,2019-04-11T23:42:34Z,2
