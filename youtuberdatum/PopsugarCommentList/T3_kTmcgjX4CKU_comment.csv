"Loved the workout! At almost 60 years of age (3 months away but who&#39;s counting?!) I have to modify quite a bit. I&#39;ve discovered from other videos that are made for my age group, that to modify is wise and necessary but, at the same time have found that most of those videos don&#39;t challenge me enough. So here I am, going back and forth.",Sharene Pritchard,2021-03-24T17:51:29Z,9
