"I already commented a few months ago.  This is an update. I have lost 20Ibs and my cholesterol and blood sugar are down.  I credit everything to kick it by Eliza. When you exercise and see results,  it helps you keep doing all the other things you do to lose weight.  Like eliminating fast foods,  no eating out, and no eating after a certain time at night.  People,  it&#39;s a combination of all these things that make you lose weight.  Again,  I try not to look at Emily because towards the end, she becomes slack. I&#39;m sure she wishes there was a do-over. This is the best video over. With knee braces, my knees do well. I have recommended it to so many people. The ball is in your court people. Thanks kick it crew.❤❤🌹",Nneka T,2021-03-16T14:11:53Z,19

"If anyone wanted the calorie burn: I’m 5’3, 115 Ibs, did high impact, and didn’t skip anything and burned 205 calories(which is pretty good for a workout that was only really around 20 minutes or so if you don’t count the stretches at the beginning and end).

"This is a very good workout, especially if you are under 50 years of age. For us much older women, I recommend doing the workout but not as fast. And if there are any particular drills that hurt your knees, back, arms, neck, etc., then simply modify them. I taught martial arts and cardio boxing for years and had many women above 70 years of age who never thought they&#39;d be able to get through the class, but I helped them modify the drills to suit their abilities. After 3 months, they were able to do the full drills, keeping up with me. It takes time if you are older, but keept it up. This is definitely a good workout for the entire body.",Connie Gallant,2021-01-14T18:13:08Z,0

Just some easy bodyweight moves.&quot;  Ha!! One of the toughest arm workouts ever!!  I had to FORCE myself to work out today, chose this one on a whim, and somehow it was the perfect end-of-the-day workout...brought things up just far enough, then brought things down into a lovely &quot;zen vibe&quot; for the evening.  235 cal/171 active calories...nothing crazy and just what I needed!",m temp,2020-10-27T23:31:03Z,1

Instructors should learn how to &#39;Mirror Teach&#39; when facing camera or participants. Amazes me how many dont perfect this skill.

"6 months ago I decided to treat myself once and for all by taking care of myself and doing excercise. I was super unfit, could barely run for 2 minutes, and jumping would hurt my knees.

"I totally get you! The first time I did this, my leg muscles were so unused to working that hard that I was basically crippled for a few days afterwards (it hurt so bad to stand and walk downstairs lol) But during quarantine, I exercised and ate healthier and after a few months, I tried this video again I barely broke a sweat!

"The workout is awesome ! Just if I may give some constructive feedback. One of the ladies keeps talking the whole time and commenting and it is very distracting and also at times covers up the voice of the instructor. It is too much talking on her part.

Really fun and the kickboxing title is a bit misleading- its just a fun workout!,olkapolkaolka,2020-07-14T08:52:45Z,0
"Seems a bit misleading to call this a &quot;kickboxing workout&quot; given how little kickboxing you actually do in it until you reach those last 10 minutes or so. I get warming up and strengthening the relevant muscles, but after spending the first twelve minutes doing mostly squats and shoulder rolls I was over this video 😒. I&#39;m not saying it is a bad workout, but maybe call it something like &quot;kickboxing inspired&quot; so people searching for workouts full of kickboxing moves specifically don&#39;t burn out their legs before realizing they&#39;re not even getting what they came for.",phrenicForensic,2020-07-14T02:58:11Z,0

"The title of the workout implies high cardio burn being Cardio KickBoxing. But the only time your heart rate may exceed 150 BPM is round 2 and 8. During round 5 my roommate asked me, Weren&#39;t you working out? Because you literally stand and rotate your arms 45 degrees at the elbow for five minutes straight. No cardio, no kickboxing relationship at all. If you already have cardio conditioning skip this workout and try Jeanette :)",Barbara Dey,2020-06-22T16:56:08Z,0

"Okay, I&#39;ve struggled so hard to find workouts on YouTube that would inspire me to exercise every day and push through my laziness, but *I love this*. First time has been quite exhausting, but the cool-down at the end? Totally worth it. I read in the comments that so many people benefitted from this one, so I&#39;ll definitely keep trying to do this every other day!",Anna Nicolussi,2020-05-10T21:25:27Z,0
"Update from Day 2: Today I had soared muscles from the same workout yesterday, so rounds 2 and 3 were about to break my spirit. I had to take some rest in between because of how short of breath I was, but managed to pull it together and keep on exercising. Today I slowed down some of the last combinations because I really wanted to feel the power in my kicks and control more of my abysmally weak abs and I hope it was effective. Cooldown was much needed and appreciated, as always. (Didn&#39;t manage to look at myself in the mirror because of how fat I look, tho).<br /><br />Update from Day 3: Today has been quite tough, even though I managed to get through Rounds 2 and 3 without taking any rest. My goal for today was really trying to control breath during exercises. However, at the end I&#39;ve started to feel out of energy, most probably because I also took 20 minutes of spinning. I know it sounds as if I&#39;m asking too much from my body but I ate way too much at dinner and felt completely busted, so I had to workout a little bit more than usual. Have I already said that I love the cooldown?<br /><br />Update from Day 5: Done!<br /><br />Update from Day 6: Today I had my boyfriend do this workout with me and it was actually super fun to share this with someone. We both were exhausted but we managed to come through it!<br /><br />Update from Day 7: Today I didn&#39;t feel like it and only managed to get through Round 2, and only with a great deal of self-control because all of my body feels so tired right now. It&#39;s not even painful, it&#39;s just completely exhausting. I tried to fight through Round 3 but the first uppercut made me realize that I couldn&#39;t make it, not today. I know I shouldn&#39;t go that easy on myself, since I&#39;m so lazy all the time, but today&#39;s not it.",Anna Nicolussi,2020-05-11T21:18:30Z,0

Also love that Eliza encourages but there&#39;s not too much &#39;c&#39;mon girls&#39; chit chat that some of the other classes have - I&#39;m from the UK so less is more with that stuff. Eliza had the perfect balance ! Also love the cool down - feel really to start my Monday - thank you,Charlotte Byrnes,2020-05-04T06:48:58Z,6
yeah me and my sister have been doing this work out while having video call on whatsapp so we can see each other and we just call out amercian woops and so on when they do that! but it isn&#39;t so much fun if there&#39;s no one to laugh at it with :-) dunno if it&#39;s a younger person thing as i&#39;m 47.,ila ila,2020-05-13T15:59:22Z,0
"I have been doing this and Latin dance work out(30 minutes) 5 days a week, plus intermittent fasting. I lost 10 pounds since March 15th.

"Popsugar is great for branding and visually beautiful, but when it comes to substance it lacks. I found that to ring true in this workout. There was relatively little kickboxing in this workout unfortunately - nor was there much variation in moves. This is not criticism on the instructor at all whose energy was fantastic throughout - but i felt that this couldn’t even make up for the lack of substance. Although I broke out a sweat completing it, I think there are other less well known channels that can show you a better way to spend half an hour.  Although it’s more popular than popsugar, I recommend fitness blender for cardio kickboxing in particular. ‘Fitness Type’ is a great channel for low impact workouts.",London Loves,2020-04-20T11:27:19Z,1

"This is a good workout to tone and improve cardio. However, Make sure you warm up at least 8-12 minutes (recommended by AFAA) before starting the full workout. The time spent for the warm up in this video is NOT enough for the intensity of the exercise. Doing squats and kicks after barely 1 minute could cause so many injures in knees and muscles. When I see these videos I am concerned about people who do not have fitness experience, get the courage to start exercising and then get injured for improper warm ups or stretching .",ivonneopinion,2020-03-04T14:11:51Z,1

"Made me sweat, wasn&#39;t the most intense but is a good workout to throw into my weekly mix! I liked the yoga cool down at the end. The only thing I didn&#39;t like was all of the lunges, for some reason they really mess with my knees and I&#39;m not overweight at all so I don&#39;t know why they do that. I ended up replacing lunges with front and back kicks.",Alexa,2020-01-23T13:26:46Z,1

This is a great workout to not be overwhelmed and feel very achievable.  I would definitely classify it as strength training rather than cardio.  There were only a few actual cardio exercises.  My average heart rate was 110 and I added weights at the arm part and tried to double time the jumps.  I would maybe re-name it since it&#39;s a bit misleading.,Meg,2019-10-24T01:10:35Z,1

The last round - round nine - I did it three times because of the momentum of the moves - - so good.

You should reeeeeeally give a moment to show how to do the move first with proper form.,Cara,2019-05-27T19:07:57Z,1
"It was fun and a nice workout but in some rounds the transitions between moves are so quick I can&#39;t do them with good form. E.g. moving so quickly between lunges and kicks, my kicks lose power and height, and my lunges have bad form, going over the knee or not going deep enough. Maybe it&#39;s just me, but I reckon it&#39;s quite difficult to maintain good form whilst rushing so fast between moves.",Alexandra Panico,2019-05-24T10:56:26Z,5

"can i just say how much i love this workout? I&#39;m genetically quite slim (size 2 in the US) so people assume I&#39;m fit. I&#39;m not, and I hate running because i find it boring. So having something to do every day thats interesting and fun enough to actually keep myself fit, and most importantly look after my mental health, is amazing. I really love Eliza&#39;s style. Love everything you do, Anna, and this has been everything i need right now. &lt;3",Mandy Maclean,2019-04-09T10:57:08Z,1

I&#39;ve been doing workouts similar to this for 2-3 months now and I have gotten many compliments on how I&#39;ve lost weight. however, I recommend checking out &quot;10-minute cardio jump workout to burn major calories&quot; by popsugar aswell. the 10-minute cardio is something you can do quick and burns a ton of calories! I usually do the 10-minute video 3 times and I feel super tired but awesome afterwards! ALSO make sure to take pictures of your progress! it really helps and keeps you motivated! hope this helped :)",Nina Vukojevic,2019-03-27T04:29:11Z,0

"This was a fantastic cardio workout with the added fun of some kick-boxing. I added 2lb soft hand weights I use for other kick-boxing workouts - it was a great extra challenge, but not practical for the micro arm pulses or jumping jacks.

"Know how I stayed motivated until getting up at 5:00 am to work out became a healthy habit?  I got a 3 ring binder and dividers, subscribed to a fitness magazine and would cut out articles.  I had a section for exercises, recipes, work-out log, diet log.  It was my &quot;fitness bible&quot;.  I looked at it every day and it kept me motivated.  90% of this is in your head - after that you get to enjoy all the benefits of living a healthy lifestyle.  Start with long-term and short-term goals and break them down.  If you feel yourself getting burned out, change up your routine.  Best of luck!!",Sara Kemp,2020-07-12T01:50:02Z,0

"It was working for me until the silly &amp; excessive &quot;Kick It Crew&quot; patty-caking. Hard pass from me, though I&#39;m sure lots of people will...like it. 🤷🏾‍♀️",Mel,2019-03-17T16:34:09Z,12
"@Lori Ann Hood Actually, <b>you</b> suck. I work out 7 days a week, advanced, and I&#39;m also a runner. What sucks is you making an assumption about my &quot;commitment&quot; because I don&#39;t care to pattycake like a 5-year-old. FOH",Mel,2019-04-15T17:56:20Z,0

This looks good so far.  I&#39;ll give it a shot even though the squats bug my knees after a while.  I just won&#39;t do the jumping.,anklebitr79,2019-03-17T16:22:31Z,4
Definitely modify as needed!,Eliza Shirazi,2019-03-17T19:16:49Z,1
I modified all the squatting for my knees as well. I made a list of things i could do instead (some leg lifts and versions of bridge pose) and did those during that time.,Alli Law,2019-03-17T18:31:33Z,1
