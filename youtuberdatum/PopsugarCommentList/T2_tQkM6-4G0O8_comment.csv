My favourite abs workout was a 10 min Jake one you guys did ages ago! Hadn&#39;t been on youtube for a while and didn&#39;t realise you brought him back for more workouts. This one was definitely a new favourite and was so tricky paired with my 2kg weights. Definitely a challenge I can&#39;t wait to repeat x,Olivia's Catastrophe,2020-09-25T10:46:06Z,0
