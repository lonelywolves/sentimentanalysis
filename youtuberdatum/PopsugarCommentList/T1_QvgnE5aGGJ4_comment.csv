"I‚Äôve already been established in the dieting and fitness profession for more than a decade and in that period I‚Äôve acquired a exceptional global recognition which I‚Äôm tremendously proud of.

"Hey love, you can&#39;t take the burden of the world on your shoulders. And about the coronavirus- our body is in 24/7 war against pathogens all the time and this virus is dangerous mainly to older people. All we can do is try to remain as healthy as we can by eating good, exercising and sleeping.",Shirly Josco,2020-05-01T08:56:38Z,1

"This was such the perfect workout. I had been struggling with severe anxiety today, lack of motivation and severe low mood; this took me from feeling sluggish to a place of acceptance. Realising that I cannot control what happens to me, nor can I control the emotions or feelings that overcome me; but that I am in total control of my reaction to them, and within that lies my True power and autonomy. Never been more thankful for a workout &lt;3 thank you",Claudia Howick,2020-03-17T16:35:50Z,70

Actually instructing proper form would have been nice instead of weird pleasure noises and chit chat about how marvelous this workout is.
