"Lovely workout.  But just a tip, it’s not really easy for beginners. There’s no modifications for most of the moves and if you are doing her workout for the first time, half of the poses are going to be really tough. Wish she had made it less complex of a workout. I would skip it.",Kiran Pandey,2021-01-11T06:38:48Z,0

@wendigobella • Thank you! I will try that out,Izzy Martin,2020-08-06T17:12:48Z,1
"I&#39;ve been doing Casey&#39;s WOs for a long time now and all I can tell you is that if it hurts like that (not in the good way), it means probably 2 different things that can be related or not<br />1) You&#39;re possibly in the wrong position, I&#39;d suggest you checking if your elbow is underneath your shoulder and if your palm is pressed onto the mat. Now, pressing your palm is really necessary so you can distribute your weight equally among the elbow and the rest of your arm. So be mindful. If you dip past what your body allows, your hand is going up and your elbow is gonna get the full weight of your upper body, hence, a sharp pain. Also engage your core so you are gonna be able to maintain your balance and reduce the chances of your hand getting up.<br />2) You have sensitive joints. If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;d suggest you using some form of protection and also working your arms muscles, so they can help your joints out a little bit. If the pain persists, I&#39;d recommend you stop the exercise and do an easier and less harmful version of it. Better take things slowly than put yourself at risk.<br />Hope everything goes smoothly for you!♥️♥️♥️🌻",wendigobella •,2020-08-06T07:57:25Z,1
