"@Mia Ko23 I bought it and I&#39;m doing it now and yes I&#39;m modifying more on some workouts than others but I can see and feel it working. Also due to work, I&#39;ve had to reverse a rest day and do two 20 min workouts in the same day but I needed the calendar. At this time in my life, I need a 5-6day workout week to get a jumpstart!  Plus it&#39;s starting to be a habit. Buy IT!!",BrokeButBourgie,2019-10-14T12:58:44Z,1
