Nothing that I dread more than a workout that&#39;s kicking my butt and I look and see there&#39;s 10 minutes left. Thankfully this video at the &quot;my ass is getting whooped&quot; phase where I&#39;m drenched in sweat I look up and there&#39;s 2 min left. This was quick and effective!

"I first started working out to your mom&#39;s videos 15 years ago when i was an insecure 19 year old who was really overweight, especially for my height, and had never worked out a day in my life. I fell in love with the way it made me feel and everything else fell into place. I lost 60lbs in a year and a half with her help and working out with you just brought a smile to my face...and made me sweaty. So much fun!",TheresaM86,2021-03-20T20:02:33Z,6

How many calories does that burn?,Dina Simoné,2021-03-14T16:11:16Z,4
115 for me including the warm up - I didn’t go as fast and hard on the bicycle crunch and tricep dip either so you probably burn even more :),Niki Park,2021-03-14T22:30:23Z,2
I burned 100,Emma Neal,2021-03-14T18:49:59Z,2
