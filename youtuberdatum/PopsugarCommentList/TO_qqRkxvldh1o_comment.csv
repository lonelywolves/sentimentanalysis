"Hello friend! Are you like walking or cycling? You might be interested in an app that motivates people to walk more, because you can make a little extra money by walking. It works so that for every 1000 steps you get 1sweatcoin and it is worth about 0,4 euro. For these sweatcoins you can buy different products (currently offers RAW sticks, speaker, OGarden ... product offer is constantly changing), but you can also choose 1000 € per paypal (for 20 000sweatcoin), or buy a discount on some product, sweatcoins in addition, they can be forwarded between accounts, so you can save on one thing in more people. It works on the principle that the company pays the app for advertising and part of the money you just like in the form of sweatcoin, you just have to walk them. It works, check out the reviews, download them in the tens of millions, I can highly recommend. Check it out and see for yourself by logging in via the link below, so we&#39;ll get a bonus and be automatically friends;).<br /><br />❤️https: //@t",Sek[i],2020-02-08T07:18:22Z,0

Damn all my favorite trainers! I don&#39;t have money to spend on this stuff so I guess I won&#39;t see them anymore. I love Jake and Renier but I can&#39;t buy their workouts. So bummed.,Sarah Dominello,2020-01-02T14:41:07Z,5

Moved to Sydney Cummings channel and so much happier- now having to pay for workouts?!,Amelia Buckley,2019-12-31T15:52:52Z,13
Amelia Buckley I too have moved to Sydney Cummings channel a couple of months ago thanks to the comments on here.,Blandune Bowen,2020-02-01T08:22:24Z,4
"have you been on fitness blender&#39;s youtube or website? hundreds of free workouts and you can sort them on the site by difficulty, time, and style (cardio, hiit, bodyweight, weight, yoga, some kickboxing). they&#39;re a little more low key (no music, bland staging) but I love the husband and wife couple, and they are follow-along, so maybe play your own motivating music?<br />also HIITBURN is another couple, they used to have paid programs but recently opened up a youtube channel and have a few short intense HIIT/Strength style workouts.",C F,2020-01-11T15:27:09Z,1
"Amelia Buckley totally agree. I was an avid user here, but from comments on other routines found Sydney Cummings and she is great. <br />I appreciate all popsugar has done for people with the previous years of workouts posted for free, but to move into paid more now for us to continue to access the higher intensity, tougher workouts and trainers like we see here, that is a little disappointing, so I’ll prob stick with Sydney too.",Michelle H,2020-01-04T23:10:42Z,4

@Maya Tanner All workouts are between 10 to just over 40 minutes. Most workouts are around 30 minutes :),POPSUGAR Fitness,2020-01-02T18:15:39Z,2
Thanks! Sounds like a great deal. I&#39;m really excited for Christa DiPaolo&#39;s workouts.,Maya Tanner,2019-12-30T18:24:40Z,0
Maya Tanner they vary between 30-40 mins. All workouts are brand new and there are no repeats. Amazing value,Sarah al-ghani,2019-12-30T17:23:13Z,2
To do this I also wanted access to the eat clean plan but looks like it is only available to iPhone users so that is no good to me<br />We dont all purchase apple products you know?,le be,2019-12-30T08:40:06Z,1

try heather robertson !!!!! she&#39;s amazing!!! she also has a free 12 week program and all the videos are uploaded on her channel,Moonlightvibes,2020-02-22T13:42:37Z,1
"you&#39;ll go crazy on fitness blender dot com (and their youtube). I think hundreds of workouts, all kinds of styles and duration",C F,2020-01-11T15:27:47Z,0
"Yes! Definitely check out Sydney Cummings. Her workouts are amazing and very challenging. She has a wide variety of workouts. She does HIIT, Bootcamp, Tabata, Pilates, Kickboxing,  and more targeted workouts, which normally incorporate cardo mixed in. And just about every other workout she uses hand weights. But her body weight workouts are just as, hard. Also once a week she posts a 20 minute stretch. Highly recommend you check her out. Also, If you want, go ahead and check out FitnessBlender. They too have a large variety of effective, challenging workouts.",Maya Tanner,2019-12-29T23:28:06Z,6
"OrandaChildren my mother thinks i’m skinny and don’t need to workout. she hates whenever i exercise. i do about 3 of their 30 minute videos a day. i guarantee if i asked her to pay for this paid program her answer would be no. and at the moment i don’t have money to pay for this, i’m only 13 haha!",fromypov,2019-12-29T21:10:32Z,2
It&#39;s not much money though. Does your mom hate the lgbt or something?,OrandaChildren,2019-12-29T21:06:43Z,0
Not a huge fan of the paid programs. The main appeal of Pop sugar was the amazing workouts that were available on the channel.,Mehwish Ahmed,2019-12-29T18:25:49Z,9

"Why do people feel the need to post comments like this? Like Popsugar cares? They still have hundreds of free workouts and they still add new ones all the time. If you don&#39;t like the paid program, then don&#39;t buy them. Some people actually like them. They need money to continue making free content for you to bitch about.",Ryne,2019-12-29T18:59:10Z,8
