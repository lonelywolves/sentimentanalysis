"Great workout, very different! Simple movements but really intense! Had to take a rest 15 minutes in with sweat dripping from my forehead. Pff! I&#39;m grateful for another dance video, I follow Popsugar because of the dance videos!",Shapeless Journeys,2021-01-06T03:12:20Z,0
"Honestly, I had to turn this off after 10 minutes b/c I couldn&#39;t follow the dance moves. I think they should put in the description that this is for those with moderate dance experience or something. They went way too fast for someone who is not a dancer. I think it&#39;s great for those who can follow along....but if you&#39;re new at dance workouts...this will be a bummer.",Allisen Landry,2020-12-07T01:14:15Z,0

"This workout is a good combination of cardio and toning. It would have been a GREAT workout if the instructor had taken just a few second to explain the dance moves. As someone who&#39;s never done a dance class ever, it was pretty frustrating not being able to figure out ball change section, even the second time around.",assiram87,2020-03-24T19:01:25Z,0
"This was a great &quot;sweat sesh&quot;, but I could have done with more detailed instruction before jumping into the moves—i.e. addressing which leg we start with, maybe mapping out the moves for us beforehand, etc.  I found myself spending half of the cardio period trying to figure out the movement.  Even so, I got a great workout!  Thanks ladies!",Hannah Socolofsky,2020-03-24T14:38:40Z,23

"This was great! I usually don&#39;t do &quot;dance&quot; workouts, mostly because: a)  they require more concentration, b) they require me to wear glasses (or contacts) which do not like doing when working out. This , however, was nice. My only wish is that you, guys, wear darker clothing. Simply because I don&#39;t like wearing glasses when working out, and dark outfits stand out more (hence, easier for me to follow the movements). Thanks anyway for keeping us fit and toned. ^_^",Dr Radska,2019-05-22T04:16:59Z,0

Great workout - this was one of my favourites - I really liked the instructor&#39;s style and the dance moves weren&#39;t too hard for me to figure out (they usually are!),Kristen Bylenga,2019-04-19T14:03:35Z,5

"I&#39;m glad that people are enjoying the dance workouts. I myself have never enjoyed dance workouts and am finding there has been no new videos for me lately.  I used to do Pop Sugar videos on a regular basis but have had to move to other channels to get the workouts I enjoy.  I really miss having Anna in all of the videos as well.<br /><br /><br />That being said, this is a great channel and always so positive. I hope there will be content in the future that suits me and I will be able to come back!",Kari P,2019-04-19T13:23:29Z,3
Kari P I appreciate your feedback Kari. The Class FitSugar offers a variety of other workouts and Anna is still the host of that series. This new Dance FitSugar series will be in addition to that series and hopefully will provide something fun for everyone 😃✨,Deja Riley,2019-04-20T18:44:58Z,0

"I love a high energy dance workout, and the toning and sculpting was a nice added bonus. Would like to see her back.",Lizard Stauss,2019-04-18T19:34:39Z,8
"calling it a dance workout is kinda far-fetched, the dance teaching is not easy to follow, and the order of the steps is confusing, this workout will be better without the dance part and it is just 2 small parts and not connected together, not mean we don&#39;t like to dance, just because the guidance of dance is not clear and not easy to get. otherwise the other circuits are good and challenging. <br />sorry to be strict, if you want to teach dance, you need to cue clearly to let the students know what&#39;s next and how to do. and not just dance like by your own, or just keep on finishing/showing your own dance, not to mention the dance steps are not very easy or slow.",Liny W.,2019-04-18T19:06:42Z,17

The amount of people complaining about this being a dance video on a FREE channel that has literally 100s of other non dance workouts on it is baffling to me,ilanstermonster,2019-04-17T16:13:42Z,566
"The funny thing is my criticism would actually be the contrary. I&#39;m watching videos before doing them and when I read that it&#39;s a dance workout, and I see a planking section, I don&#39;t get the impression it&#39;s a dance workout at all lol.",Angelofexecution,2019-04-30T14:54:19Z,0

"EmilyA1984 the dance workouts once a week are only for the month of April, which is the Dance FitSugar. Today (Sunday), they released a non dance workout. They just wanted to give their viewers what they wanted since they got a lot of people asking for more dance workouts. Plus Anna was on maternity leave so they probably wanted to save some of the more popular workouts for when she came back. They can do the dance workouts while she&#39;s out recovering since dance isn&#39;t really her forte.",Akamekun,2019-04-21T16:41:11Z,0
"@Akamekun I know that, but I think people are upset because the regular Popsugar Fitness channel is coming out with more dance workouts, in addition to Dance Fitsugar, but more than that; the most recent non-dance workout was behind a paywall, which nobody was warned about in advance.",EmilyA1984,2019-04-19T13:09:15Z,1

"I actually love dance workouts! This one was great. It wasn’t pure dance. There were toning sections as well. There was one section though when the moves didn’t go to the beat of the music, and that threw me off.  I do agree that there should be more variety of workout types for those of us who want it. But overall I enjoyed this workout. Looking forward to the next one!",YOGAsaada,2019-04-17T15:09:36Z,19

Why have the last few workouts been dance related? Some of us have two left feet and don&#39;t like or know how to dance. Another cardio strength workout with weight would be good,Andrea Moreland,2019-04-17T14:20:21Z,12
Andrea Moreland they&#39;ve gotten a huge demand for dance workouts so they are giving people what they want. I personally don&#39;t know how to dance but I still do them because they are a great challenge for me.
