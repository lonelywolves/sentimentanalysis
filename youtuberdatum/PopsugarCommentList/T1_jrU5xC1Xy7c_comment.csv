I don’t understand how 500 rep ? Please can anyone explain this 😓,Abd Ha,2020-06-07T00:41:50Z,0
So you will do 25 of the 10 moves (250) and di another round for a total of 500(250 x2) . Got it .,Erica D.,2020-06-04T14:43:51Z,0
My personal advice : don&#39;t wear shoes or socks while working out even running ... try running on the grass. Feet has nerve endings .. you will feel the difference.,Xalxo Clarice,2020-06-04T03:33:38Z,0

This 500 rep challenge is great! Can&#39;t make any excuses not to do it since it&#39;s in the comfort of your own home! Would&#39;ve have been even better if it was a follow along!,Andre Williams,2020-05-28T09:14:00Z,0
"Just did this, literally a few minutes ago 🥵<br />Did 2 rounds with some modification like the push up and burpee, I divided the reps into 10,10,5 (quick rest in between 😁). And double the others like the Ab bike, mountain bike and pop squat to somehow compensate..",Bobbie,2020-05-28T05:18:33Z,0
"Are you all counting each movement as one rep, or is it complete both sides to equal one rep? Hoping it&#39;s the former, because gurl... there&#39;s no way I can do 25 jump lunges on each leg without my legs collapsing like jello.",Laura A,2020-05-27T22:13:07Z,0
