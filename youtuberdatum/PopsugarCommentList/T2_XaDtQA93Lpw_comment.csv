"the angle and the plant on the left are a bit stressful for me.<br />chould put the camera futher from the wall, <br />give more floor for the view and send more breath between us and the trainer. <br />and for the pot, it makes me worried if she would hit the pot just right next to her movement.<br />because it is not a simple wall, there are too many different pieces in the background, <br />if there is more space in the picture or make it less and simple behind, <br />we would watch it more comfortably.",Liny W.,2020-08-23T09:45:23Z,1
