"I appreciate this workout as it really pulled me out from the routine cardio muscle workout during the week, and gave me some fresh air. I think curiosity and freshness are the power to keep me continuing the fitness.<br />At the same time, i was disappointed with my coordination. So i felt depressed and body didn&#39;t get enough work, as most of the time i was watching and thinking which foot to step first. <br />Suggestion to Popsugar: you&#39;d better work more on the low impact option: so beginners can move as fast as advanced one to keep the cardio, but with less requirement on arm-leg coordination. <br />For sure i will repeat this one several times until i get it completely!",LIU 刘Bo 博,2020-11-06T04:18:52Z,0

I loved learning new dance work out.  I am not a dancer so it was a bit challenging but great work out for my brain and actually great cardio work out too.  He was so fun in leading me into dancing too.  My ab and quads had a challenge definitely!

"I have been a PopSugar fan for 9 years (since the channel began). When Z was the head trainer! I love PopSugar! Recently though, I hate all the dance workouts. What happened to the no nonsense right to the point workouts that are amazing?? While they still give us some, its not nearly what they use to. If you are looking for a channel just like Popsugar  USE TO BE try Chloe Ting&#39;s channel. I just found her and her workouts are awesome. They remind me of the old popsugar channel. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I will still pop back in to see if there are any new good workouts from PopSugar, but I think Chloe Ting may be my new go to channel.
