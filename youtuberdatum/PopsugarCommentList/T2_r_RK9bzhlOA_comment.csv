My back is been bad for a week. Much better today .Should I do the workout?,Paola Cufaro,2020-08-17T17:06:02Z,1
Yes. You should excercise atleast every other day for your muscle to recovered and heal.. If you overwork your muscle you are just ripping it and may cause a bad effect in the near future...,TRUE KING TV,2020-08-19T01:17:44Z,0
