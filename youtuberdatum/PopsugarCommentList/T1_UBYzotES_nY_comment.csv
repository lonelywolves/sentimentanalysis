Hello dear Koya and Popsugar team! <br />I keep doing this for the last 2 months and feel so much better! Thanks a lot for the energy you share! Warmest wishes!,Yanski Noa,2021-04-16T06:39:36Z,0
"So many ads that it made me mad. Koya is awesome, but I&#39;m going back to her other videos because I got interrupted 5 times (like some others said).",Marsha Trainer,2021-04-01T00:24:20Z,0
For those worried about ads. A trick I use is 1) turn off the autoplay 2) fast forward the video until it&#39;s about 1 minute left. Let the video play out until the end and then replay. <br /><br />When I do this I get no ads during my videos. Hopefully it works for you.,Alfie Hardy,2021-03-20T20:44:37Z,0
