"I&#39;m a fan of all things POPSUGAR especially the variety of workouts, it always feels like a mini party while I&#39;m getting my sweat on. There are some workouts I prefer over others but never have I felt compelled to call one out as a &quot;party foul&quot;.  Please let all instructors, male, female (or whatever the gender label) know that it is not ok to call adult women &quot;GIRLS&quot; especially when one has been a leader of the POPSUGAR fitness family for years.  It hasn&#39;t been ok for decades and it certainly isn&#39;t ok now for any feminine-empowered platform like POPSUGAR.  Send a text to your camera-facing instructors to continue to have fun and be mindful those around you aren&#39;t teen-agers and deserve some respect for being grown-a** women.",Karla Kelly,2021-01-22T18:42:41Z,0

"From all the videos I tried so far, this is the best one!! I feel the energy and connection between this trio and damn - I worked out listening to my own playlist in headphones to this all the time but I didnt today, because I just felt such a positive and happy vibe from just watching Aurelio that I actually felt like stopping the music and listening to his words (which I never do during workout videos!) and it was amazing! He is so kind and encouraging, I wish there were more videos with him in the future! + I cant believe how Anna is always smiling all the time throughout all the videos and Renee - she is unbelievable! Also encourages me to try the advanced version of the workout just from watching her form and them moves! Love this",Katie’s ❤️,2021-01-17T19:38:12Z,2

"Is it possible to do a workout where you don&#39;t talk?  I feel like I don&#39;t need a running commentary on the moves.  Just blast the music and we can follow along. THere are a number of videos that are like this, but they appear to be all Asian.  In the west, it seems common to continually talk throughout the workout and tell everyone &quot;last one&quot; or &quot;now we&#39;re going to do jumping jacks&quot;, or &quot;ok, let&#39;s get on our knees, you got this...&quot; etc ... just do the moves, blast the music, and we can follow along.",Scott Schileck,2020-10-18T13:13:26Z,0

I loved how  instructor reminded us to go with the beat. That made it more fun. I wish you would call the two women something besides girls: friends, athletes, strong women. I can&#39;t wait to do another workout bc the next one looks amazing. Thank  you for making these available.",anne berne,2020-10-02T19:41:30Z,0

"although it was a good workout, i really didn’t like how it was organized. i’m a martial artist, and i’ve started checking out online workouts since my dojo is shut down due to the virus, and i wanted to find a fun way to do some cardio. i don’t know about y’all, but i’m a sweaty motherfucker. by the time we moved to the floor plank/push-up exercises, my forearms were so sweaty, i was slipping all over the place and couldn’t maintain my form. i think if that section was moved towards the first half, it would be better. also, that section with the 2 knees followed by a kick was terrible. there’s no good angle to get that click off of after those knees, and i’m an experienced kicker. i’m worried about the people who don’t do combat training hurting their knees/hip joints. all in all, it was a good workout, but i won’t be using this video again.",thebardfromspace,2020-07-29T18:07:07Z,1
agreed on that double knee ups followed by side kick. Impossible to keep balance at that speed. I did martial arts before too so i went at my own speed to set the proper stance before powering out that side kick.

Now 2 and a half months later, after doing this workout around 1-3 times a week coupled with other exercises, I can follow along until the very end (even sometimes with progression) and be super happy about it! It still leaves me super exhausted afterward, but I am just super happy and uplifted with the progress I have made so far. Thx for the video :)!",Ghina Mufida,2020-06-06T18:20:35Z,0

"Not knowing what the Strong by Zumba program was about before this workout, I was a bit confused, wondering where the Zumba moves (I.e., dance moves) were. Fortunately, it was a refresh of past kickboxing classes for me, so if you&#39;ve done that type of workout before, the learning curve is pretty short. I also enjoyed kickboxing and saw great results when I did it regularly. <br />All in all, it is an efficient yet intense workout that does not require a lot of space, and I will do it again!",Kelly Jobe,2020-04-18T17:09:39Z,0

I thought maybe I was being over sensitive but I really can’t stand when men use girls that way!! “You broads okay?” Would have bothered me less 😂,Sara Simpson,2020-05-19T18:51:57Z,0
"I agree with both points. I commented more thoroughly about the first elsewhere, but the &quot;girls&quot; thing grated on me. Women is fine, or better yet, the gender-neutral &quot;friends,&quot; or &quot;folks&quot;, or &quot;people&quot;, or even &quot;yo&quot;.",Lisa Griffin,2020-05-19T14:26:54Z,1

"Really enjoyed this workout! A lot of positivity, helped me stay in the routine. The thing that caught me was the stress on &quot;form over intensity&quot; on the kicks; I wasn&#39;t sure how to do the correct form. Do you have a reference for how to do them well, without falling over? That aside though, I had a great time, and the synced-music style worked really well for me.

Emma Margaret I workout a lot in general so home workouts are mostly for me to maintain my progress. I’ve only done this specific workout once and didn’t see any results from it necessarily. Recently I did the two LIT method workouts from Popsugar and started following a girl named MadFit and I think Heather Ross and from those I definitely saw results. The LIT ones are worth checking out if you have the equipment they use.,Nicole Magloire,2020-04-15T11:59:34Z,0

Only one advise and request, it would be best to do a little more time of warm up at the begining because you go into somewhat fast moves right from the start and you could get hurt. I did pull a tendon on my hip, and think it was the lack of warm up! Thank you 😉",Lyrian K Mata,2020-02-18T10:02:14Z,0

"I love the previous Strong by Zumba workouts on Pop Sugar sooo much and am thrilled to have a new one to try! (I even got a Strong by Zumba DVD for Christmas because I love their workouts to the beat). I also LOVE anything with kickboxing moves, so I was thrilled there were so many of those included. This was super challenging for me at times, but I loved having three levels of difficulty (I hit all three during the workout, depending on the moves and my strengths/weaknesses; gives me room to progress the next time I do this workout). This one&#39;s definitely going in my favorites playlist! Thanks Anna, Aurelio, and Renee! &lt;3",KateKintail,2020-01-12T22:12:17Z,1

I did find it quite difficult to follow at times as there could be more instruction prior to a change and during. Particularly the floor work when viewers aren&#39;t looking at the screen, I had no clue what was happening.

One of your best workouts ever.  Could keep it low impact and still get your heart rate way up there.  Excellent instructor.  Your camera needed to be on Anna more than the advanced woman.  Most people would be following her but you guys mainly kept camera on women doing insanely hard moves.  Ditto about push up comments.  Didnt know if you doing regular push ups or tricp push ups.,Wendy Gerhardy,2020-01-07T19:00:09Z,1

Love the video with these two amazing Strong by Zumba Master Trainers. I have had the pleasure to attend Aurelio&#39;s class a couple of times and Renee&#39;s Master Classes when in the area. Both of these instructors are a huge inspiration and motivation to me as an instructor. I recommend you take this video as a demo and look for classes near you to get the real workout experience. You choose your level of intensity and you can transform your body. Who knows if you discover that you have what it takes to teach a class and get licensed as an instructor?

"Girls supporting the coach and demonstrating Strong by Zumba, what would be reason for us the female species to look more like Male body builders? This is especially valid for the girl to the coach&#39;s right. I am not a shrinking violet, I also do HIIT inter alia,  but  that cannot be the ideal body form  the average woman would aspire to. Nor should this type of exercise be an example to follow for overweight people.",tandrichter,2020-01-06T12:16:48Z,1
"I&#39;m intrigued as to how they look like body builders? They look fit and toned, not overly bulked up. Also, they&#39;re entitled to do whatever exercise they like and have whichever body shape suits them. I&#39;m also interested why this exercise isn&#39;t suitable for overweight people?

"Great workout! Just a few things: the camera doesn&#39;t need to work so hard! A wide screen shot is best - whenever the camera closes in on someone, it can be very jarring when you&#39;re trying to follow along - and those torso shots don&#39;t help either. Keep it simple! And for those exercises when your head is down, it would be great to have more detailed instruction on what you&#39;re supposed to do - like the pushup sequence. Just a few production notes, but loved the workout!",Mary Paloma Chipman,2020-01-05T23:46:56Z,796

"The workout itself was great, but I could have used more instruction/countdowns during moves and transitions when we&#39;re not supposed to be looking at the video (example: the pike/jump-out sequence). Also, if a trainer is there for the advanced moves, it would be helpful to start that move right away instead of just up to the last two counts. I kept losing my place and having to rewind for these reasons.",Zoë Burnett,2020-01-05T19:26:39Z,0
"@Anna Licciardi Thank you for this explanation on the moves, it would have been more helpful coming from Pop Sugar. I don&#39;t have gym access for various reasons, and my criticism was meant to be constructive. There is a person there for the advanced moves that is not instructing, so that comment still stands. Pop Sugar used to create more content for advanced subscribers, but that is becoming less and less common on their site.",Zoë Burnett,2020-01-06T01:35:47Z,0
"Zoë Burnett  i am a strong instructor. strong it is not made for this type of video, it is a training made to do in a class... also the instructor goes in deficient of oxigen and it is difficult to work like that and talk... we don t do count down cause it is the music that drives you not countdowns so it is the music that tells you when change moves... about the livel of difficult that sucks big time cause as an instructor we need to demostrate all the level and usually we starts with the base and build up (i actually do it in reverse so people can choose if work at more difficult level or modify with me)<br />If you like this classe try one in a gym it is another kind of experience.

"You don&#39;t need to stop exercising unless you&#39;re severely underweight and overexercising. Exercising is good for health in 99% of cases, unless you have an injury, a specific health condition or you&#39;re really undereating or over exercising. Are you underweight? If so, you need to look at your diet and increase (good) calories. If not, it&#39;s a medical problem and you need to see a doctor, not stop exercising.",Alexandra Panico,2020-01-06T12:25:08Z,0

I could still work out it was my DIET I had to change. EAT MORE PROTEIN and more MINERALS. Folic acid, etc things you find in cereal and more healthy oils like fish and avocado.  You have to feed your body nutrition and do some exercise to relax your body. Remember you are beautiful. Listen to your body. Dont over eat to gain weight, just eat more protein -- healthy foods that stick to your ribs not chips and crap or deep fried.   Good luck. PS&gt; It is important as well because your body needs protein as well to fight off bacteria in your body to keep you healthy..

"This is both cardio and strength, imo practically the perfect workout for health, toning and weight loss. Cardio is useful for heart health and burning calories but it&#39;s more important to build muscle (toning) as a) it looks better and b) muscle burns more calories at rest. A mix of cardio and strength is ideal, but you also need to ensure you don&#39;t overeat or drink your calories.",Alexandra Panico,2020-01-06T12:28:00Z,0
