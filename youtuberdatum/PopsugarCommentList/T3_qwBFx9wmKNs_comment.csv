"My husband and I have been working out to Jake&#39;s workouts 5 days a week for months during this pandemic. Completely changed the shape of my body. Love handles are gone. Stomach flatter and more defined. I had a bad shoulder and I&#39;m now doing his workouts with 5lb weights which even after physio was unthinkable. My posture is better. I use 15lbs of weight for his booty circuits. My legs are more muscular and my butt is smooth, plumper and more lifted. My husband&#39;s pants no longer fit at the waist and his butt is tighter. Such a good instructor if you commit to the work. I can&#39;t thank him enough.",Nicole Pritchard-Livingston,2020-12-31T23:08:15Z,220

"First off, this more a leg workout than anything.  My legs were so sore the day after - my core felt nothing. I am not a fan of this workout or this instructor&#39;s style; if negative reinforcement is your thing, then you might like it. Jake states at least four times &quot;you&#39;re going to hate me&quot; during the video; that is not motivating or encouraging, nor is his way of trying to be &quot;cute&quot; by doubling up his counts often. I&#39;ve never seen another instructor do this, nor do I care for it. Also, six minutes of this video is stretching, so you are not getting a full 30 minute cardio workout. Not for me.",Dana Jones,2021-02-10T17:33:46Z,0

Jake I came again with other comment. The first time I couldn&#39;t follow the fast movements which made me wonder to switch to slow down the mode. Your voice came slow motion and movements which made me a bit depressed not normal notion. Second class I kept it as normal but I tried so hard to follow all the switching movements from one to other. Today I managed to do with you all the class accept one water break. I I felt I became stronger than before. I Thanks again and again. For all if class you feel it high level no worries you are with the right instructor.,Ahmad Link0799,2021-01-18T22:14:07Z,0

This workout will definitely leave you dripping in sweat. The only thing that bugs me about Jake is that he occasionally tricks me about how much longer I have.
