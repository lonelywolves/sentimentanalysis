This woman is intoxicated with her own thoughts. Narcissist! Like... just stop talking about yourself for five seconds. Back right lady should have run the class. She is at least a normal human being. Stop making it about you!,Luke Soloway,2021-04-20T11:18:27Z,0
"I LOVE this workout.  I’ve been doing HIIT and strength for a long time and was recently told, because of some arthritis conditions, that while I MUST move, I shouldn’t be doing impact. I was bummed, because I love the challenge of HIIT &amp; strength.  I also love multitasking.  This workout fits both.  I actually get my heart rate higher doing this than I do with HIIT.  And the cardio is from working and wearing out the whole body - arms, legs core.  While it’s not exactly like doing strength with weights, my muscles were pretty fatigued by the end of just 30 short minutes.  My sweat cloth is wringing wet. Thank you!",Danette Childs,2021-04-20T10:35:27Z,0

great workout. i was very sweaty. i like the relatively intense cardio in the first half of the workout and then the pilates in the last half. i do wish this workout was a little longer to allow for longer reps. but is a great option if you only have 30 mins. kit is one of my favourite trainers. motivating and just a badass in my option.,Morgan Ebanks,2020-11-11T18:05:33Z,0

"Quando olho pra trás não consigo ver mais nada do que fomos um dia. Só consigo lembrar do cara transtornado em um carnaval.<br />Do cara dependente de elogios, do ciumento.  Só consigo ver o cara, se aproximando de mulheres que jogava pra se alimentar de iludir pra se autoafirmar. Lembro até, do cara no velório, me olhando dos pé a cabeça, se insinuando. Lembro da sua cara de quem não quer nada alimentando a fofoca. Do tapinha nas costas do Zé. Do beijo no rosto da Lilian...<br />Lembro do seu constante ciúmes do Ney de forma declarada e infantil. Do ciúme até do Jones... Mulher sua, é literalmente &quot;sua&quot;. E vc julga a minha vida. Os meus sentimentos. <br />Não sou perfeita, muito menos melhor do que ninguém, mas uma coisa eu sou declaradamente: livre e responsável pela minha vida. Viver com um homen, se relacionar com um homem. Nada tem a ver com vc.<br />Vc foi o maior equívoco que já conheci. Não tenho raiva de vc. Tenho pena. Por isso fico mal quando falo certas verdades. Vc não tem cabeça pra lidar com certas coisas. E certamente eu fui e sou uma delas.",9 9,2020-08-02T05:22:01Z,0

"Really great workout. Although I wanted (and need) to lose weight, at 56 it is a challenge. Seeing people of different body figures is encouraging.

Ie: pizza, shake so it doesn’t shake etc.<br />Your comments about feeling good in your body don’t sound so authentic when mixed with the diet culture comments. Our focus when working out should be about healthy behaviors and taking care of ourselves. Making changing our body the focus sucks the endorphins right out.",Alicia Hill,2020-05-06T19:45:12Z,0

"No kidding, there are some longer and heavier  workouts on this channel, but whenever Kit comes along, it feels like You have been working out for 3 hours instead of 30 minutes ! I love how fierce and physically heavy her workouts are but the vibes, flow and motivation are so good You dont even sense the time ! Additionally, it is super helpful for us working out at home for her to show how the body should be positioned during exercises :)",K. T.,2020-05-04T08:49:12Z,0

Great and so you feel proud of yourself and rightly so  but we also need to train for the future stretching and gaining flexibility will be important us in the later years of our lives I urge you to improve that area a recent survey conducted by the Daily Mail Uk revealed that half of us can&#39;t even touch our toes there are plenty of channels online like mine dedicated to teaching stretching and how to split take your fitness to the next level,The Full Energy Channel,2020-05-05T16:29:14Z,1

I hate the circuits and repeating exercises again and again. whenever she says &quot;we&#39;re gonna do that again&quot; I&#39;m about to quit,Regine S,2020-05-03T16:24:18Z,15
"@The Hastings it&#39;s not about physical fatigue, more about motivation and mental fitness. I&#39;m not good with routines and I need a lot of change in my life and especially when I&#39;m working out",Regine S,2020-05-05T16:41:49Z,1
Regine S I think there is a fine line between challenging the muscles and completely fatiguing them to the point you can’t maintain form or even continue. I think that line is different for everyone but the circuits make the fatigue more likely (especially when the exercises are so similar). I am pretty fit but this one was too much repetition and was discouraging.,The Hastings,2020-05-05T16:38:43Z,0
