Thank you so much. I just regained my self confidence,Nightysky aj,2020-10-31T11:33:53Z,1
"Also, I get why people may not find this to be their cup of tea. But if you&#39;re here working out, and moving your body with someone, the least you can do is thank them. All she&#39;s aspiring to do is motivsre you. No harm in that. Just me personal opinion, but negative comments are uncalled for on such videos. Love and peace to everyone !",Abhishek Todmal,2020-10-24T14:49:36Z,0

horrible a lot of sale little exercise ... hopefully they won&#39;t invite her again,Ceci PB,2020-10-14T02:17:41Z,0
The first popsugar workout I couldn’t get through. The talking was too distracting and there was no flow in the workout. It’s a no from me sorry.,E C,2020-10-12T10:35:31Z,4
4 Youtube adds plus her constantly promoting the book was annoying...also would have liked to see more variety within the exercise. The motivational speech was nice...but must say I prefer the other Popsugar sessions more,Maya Smiles,2020-10-06T11:42:40Z,0

"Too many ads and too much talking :( Not enough cardio for a good workout. Core exercises were fine, but the pace and intensity for this workout overall were just not here.",Jennifer L,2020-09-17T16:43:43Z,7
Am totally disappointed with this workout too much of talking it was just another warm up moves for me no cardio 🙄wasted my 30 min,jignasa patel02,2020-09-17T11:01:55Z,7
"jignasa patel02 so maybe next time exclude the words with a negative connotation: “wasted my time” “totally disappointed” “too much talking” “just another warm up no cardio” practically the whole comment seems rude. And to add the cherry on top you include a rolling eye emoji. You might not have been talking about her but you were being rude in general. This is a workout that  she probably planned out the moves to and took time to try to help people for FREE. Just keep your comments to yourself to be honest, if you have nothing nice to say don’t say anything at all. I had to take this back to pre school because clearly you can’t understand how to be a civil human being and respect others. You could’ve stated your opinion without being rude, others have said the same thing but in a more respectful manner.",Marnique Reddick,2020-11-21T06:16:45Z,0
@Marnique Reddick I don’t hate her she is fabulous here am talking about the workouts and not people who are doing this workout 🙄,jignasa patel02,2020-11-20T11:01:15Z,1
"Good for you, move on stop complaining.  Just don’t do anymore of her workouts, simple as that. I hate people who are always hating on others. If you don’t like something you don’t need to go to the comments to complain. You are saying you wasted time on the workout just like you wasted your time writing this dumb comment. What if this was cardio for others. You don’t know other peoples level, so next time look for a harder workout instead of complaining.",Marnique Reddick,2020-11-17T22:58:37Z,1
"I&#39;m sorry but I could not keep watching after the first 10 minutes, that was just waaay too much talking and quite annoying. But I can understand if some people find that motivating. It was just way too &quot;Whoo be positive! Yeah&quot; much for me. I don&#39;t like to be told if I want to party or not :D Seems to be a matter of personal preference though.",Maravilla Catastrofal,2020-09-17T08:01:28Z,6

I have been doing Rebecca Louise workouts since her xhit days back in 2014 and her motivational speeches during her workouts have never failed me to &#39;feel the burn&#39;!
