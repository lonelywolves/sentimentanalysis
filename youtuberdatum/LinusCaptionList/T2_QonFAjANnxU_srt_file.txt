- You're going places, kid.
Or at least you would be
if your keyboard didn't have
a stupid wire attached to it.
But I'll tell you what,
I bought this whole whack
of the top wireless keyboards
on Amazon in the $30 range
so you can be on your way and save a buck.
We even whipped out the
LagMeter from Goose Enterprises
to see if the age-old advice
of don't use a cheap
wireless keyboard for gaming
is even true anymore.
Spoiler alert, it's not,
so we have got some great gems in here.

First up today is the
KLIM Chroma Wireless.
Chroma means color,
so this board's simulated RGB aesthetic,
something that I've taken
to calling RG-wannaB
should come as no surprise.
It's just several different
single color led lights.
And it's not very evenly
lit nor is it very bright,
but for what it's worth,
it's got 11 steps of
brightness adjustments,
which also affects the maximum brightness
of its breathing effect,
which is a rarity on budget boards.
Weighing in at a mere 500
grams, it's got really,
really bad deck flex and
really mushy switches,
similar in quality to a lot of the boards
from our budget wired roundup
just, well, without the wire.
It automatically goes to sleep
after one minute of activity,
which can actually be kind of annoying
if you're trying to use it in
the dark, but it should help
the 1300 milliamp power
battery last about two days
if you're lucky, which is not very good.
At least it comes with a USB
type C charging cable, so nice.
On the back we've got the on-off switch,
adjustable feet, drainage holes
in case you do a little spilly,
and a spot to store your
dongle, now with magnets.
Ha, how cool is that?
Not enough to redeem it though,
especially with the narrow enter key
and middle of the road 39
millisecond input delay.
So, what else we got?
The Pick Tech F1.
This one doesn't have
a rechargeable battery,
instead requiring a single
AA that it doesn't come with,
but the typing experience on
this mem-chanical doesn't suck
other than the springy
cheap sounding space bar.
And on top of that,
it's got dedicated media keys
and a battery indicator light,
that's courteous of them.
This puppy also comes with a mouse
that features a soft touch rubber finish
across the whole top,
and a separate on-off
toggle for the mouse.
And also for actually we have no idea
of what this second toggle does.
As far as input lag goes,
this board ended up second to last
with a 46 millisecond delay
from pressing the button
to our lag meter detecting a signal.
So I wouldn't recommend this
one, at least for gaming.
Next up is the Arteck HW
192, an Amazon bestseller.
Don't be alarmed by the thin
box and flexible board though,
because this thing actually,
isn't too bad to type on.
In fact, it's pretty tactile.
It's got large keys with
large letters on them
and a steel accent along the bottom
to drive home its executive look.
It's got an on-off switch
on the front, very handy,
as well as secondary media
keys and a couple of bonus keys
beside the indicator LEDs.
Although I have to say the power LED,
which blinks to indicate the battery level
and the charge status LED
should probably just have
been one light instead of two.
There's no adjustable legs,
but it does get some tilt
from the battery bump,
which both say claimed 250 hours of use
or up to 1,000 days of standby.
It's not a very gamery,
and the middle of the road
input delay reinforces that,
but I can actually recommend
this one for office use.
Just don't leave them a three-star review
unless you want their team
to email you like nine times.
Next up is the DREVO Calibur for $60.
I think we ordered this
keyboard for a different video,
but what the heck.
This compact mechanical keyboard
uses Outemu blue switches
that well, definitely feel
better than a membrane,
but do have a bit of
a metallic twang sound
if you're not into that.
It's got eight lighting effects
plus two profiles for
programming your own.
The space bar acts as a
battery meter, which is cool,
and the Caps Lock indicator light
is its own color, very thoughtful.
It does not have a 2.4 gigahertz dongle,
but there are three Bluetooth profiles
if you switch device frequently,
and it goes to sleep after 30 seconds
to keep you from bringing out
the braided micro B
charging cable too often.
Not a bad little board,
too bad some of the keys are mislabeled,
and also our lag tester
doesn't work with Bluetooth,
so this guy remains a bit of an unknown.
But hey, maybe you want
a keyboard and a mouse.
Why not check out the
LexonElec HK 600 combo?
Well, here's a few reasons.
It's mush city, the enter key is narrow.
The angle of the key caps makes
them catch on your fingers.
And while it does come with a
mouse pad, it's like random,
what is this?
PUBG overstock mouse pad or something?
The mouse's scroll wheel is scratchy,
and first and final insult to injury,
it had the most input lag out
of every keyboard we tested.
Oh, and by the way,
you're gonna need a couple of
double A's to run this set,
and it comes with zero
and there's no built-in
charging ports whatsoever,
so make sure you account for that.
While we're at it,
here's a couple more
dishonorable mentions.
Do not buy the soak six combo
because the legend is blurry,
the indicator lights always look off,
and the construction is generally bad.
Then follow up by also avoiding
the Lang two LT 600 combo.
The most is a total write-off,
what are these ergonomics?
The space bar sounds springy,
and the one star rating on Amazon is 26%.
A quarter of people who
buy this rate it one star,
that's about two to three
times higher than usual,
even in the extreme budget category.
For a better deal,
look to none other than the
MK 345 combo from Logitech.
You'll notice immediately that
the plastic is higher quality
than anything we've seen so far.
The keys actually have
a tactile bump to them,
even though they are not
mechanical key switches,
there's an integrated plastic wrist rest,
and when Logitech claims 36 months of life
from the included batteries,
I tend to believe them.
Now, the mouse is a
little on the small side,
but it has an ergonomic shape
and an included compartment
for the unified dongle,
so it's okay I guess,
but the keyboard has one big
quality downside, the legend.
It's just stickers.
Obviously, that's not
gonna last very long.
And that's also a problem
on our next entrant,
also from Logitech, the K 350.
Although I can still recommend it
if you don't mind a bit of a bigger board.
It's got a slight contour
for reducing pronation of the forearm
and a nice leather at wrist rest.
There's an assortment of giant media keys,
a generous helping of drain holes,
and these nifty two tiered legs
that engage with a nice quality snap.
Compared to the rest,
it's great to type on,
even if you have to adapt
to its non-standard navigation cluster.
And considering that this board
is still sold on Logitech's
own website for $60,
it's a steal on Amazon for under 40.
So unless you like LED lights
more than long battery life,
I'm gonna say the brand name products
came out ahead on this roundup
'cause lodgey boards are easily
the best value of the bunch.
As an added bonus,
if you're looking to game on
your cheap wireless keyboard,
both of these Logitechs
beat every other keyboard
in our latency tests at
around 21 milliseconds,
which was within two
milliseconds of our control,
inexpensive wired keyboard.
Dang, it's almost like Logitech
knows what they're doing
when it comes to peripherals
or something, isn't it?
Do you think making a website is hard?
Have you been watching this
channel for the last six years?
'Cause with Squarespace,
it doesn't have to be.
If you use Squarespace,
you'll have a website up and
running in a matter of hours,
maybe even faster than that.
They've got award-winning templates
that'll help make your website stand out
instead of looking like
it's from the nineties.
And if you're interested in
how your website's performing,
they've got built-in
tools to help you find out
what you're doing right,
and what you're doing wrong.
Both our Linus media group
and LTX expo websites
were built quickly using Squarespace.
And if you ever get stuck, like
we have, from time to time,
they have a 24/7 support team
that's ready to help you out
via live chat or email.
So go to squarespace.com/ltt

If you guys enjoyed this video,
maybe check out one of our
previous budget roundups.
They're lots of fun
if you enjoy seeing some good value stuff,
and then some really bad
stuff kinda get pooped on.
