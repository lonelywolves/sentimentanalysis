you listen to me buddy ipads are
computers now
deal with it they've got full mouse and
trackpad support
desktop web browsing and the pro models
have a powerful processor that can
outperform many
real laptops the debate about whether an
ipad
can replace your laptop is over
but that doesn't mean we're done asking
questions for instance
take this new ipad pro why did i just
call it an ipad pro
instead of what it actually is which is
the new 2020 ipad air
why does it have a better cpu but a
lower price can it replace your laptop
i'm sorry old habits die hard
now it can manage pcs from anywhere
leverage your existing cloud storage to
deploy windows
apps bios updates and more you can set
up and deploy in an afternoon

okay i figured it out i called it the
new ipad pro because this new ipad air
looks almost exactly like our 11 inch
ipad pro
from 2018 there's the square edge design
single rear-facing camera
top and bottom speaker grilles and equal
bezels on all sides
it even fits perfectly into the same
keyboard accessories meant for the pro
including the magic keyboard
the keyboard folio and my personal
favorite
this logitech folio touch i mean the
only obvious visual differences
are the slightly wider bezels and
thicker chassis on the air but
otherwise if you hadn't heard the news
you'd be forgiven for thinking this was
a
ipad pro 10.9 inch so what's apple's
game here
is the ipad air supposed to be the ipad
pro
light or maybe this square edge design
represents the future of the entire ipad
line
and the ipad air is just getting it
first sort of like a hand-me-down from
an older sibling the
thicker bezels the tablet parallel of
frayed edges on a once fashionable
sweater
thank you the new ipad air is 200
cheaper than the pro but at what cost
well the top and bottom have what appear
to be four speaker grilles but
apple says the air has stereo speakers
and sure enough
sound only seems to come from two of
them the audio is still pretty decent
for a tablet though
on the back is a single 12 megapixel
camera no ultra wide or lidar sensor
here
and on the front a lonesome 7 megapixel
camera hides in the bezel
with no true depth cameras for face id
instead apple has brought back touch
id integrating it into the power button
it's a little more of a hassle than just
looking at your ipad and swiping up but
what do you think this is
an ipad pro the air's display has a
slightly lower resolution thanks to
those thick bezels
and it also lacks pro motion which is
apple's fancy marketing term for 120
hertz
you're stuck at a pathetic 60 here but
that's not for lack of
power inside is the new a14 bionic
processor the same
six core chip found in the new iphone 12
models
in our geekbench tests the a14 single
core and gpu performance was actually
significantly better
than the a12z found in the current ipad
pros
although it did fall behind a bit in
multicore due to the a14 having two
fewer cores
the ipad air also has less memory four
gigs instead of six gigs in the pros and
the base model only comes with 64 gigs
of storage
anyone who does get one of these to use
as a actual laptop will probably want
the 256 gig version
for an extra 150 bucks and then you've
got to add a keyboard and
maybe an apple pencil if you're creative
and all of a sudden your shopping cart
is at almost twelve hundred dollars
in this economy this thing better be
freaking amazing to use
and well it's you know it's good
i mean it feels like using the ipad pro
and this time around ipad os 14 has some
cool new pencil features like
scribble which lets you write and edit
in any text field a la
windows 10 from 2018 there's also just
some more
basic desktop os stuff like the ability
to set third-party apps as the default
email client or web browser
which is especially nice now that the
ipad versions of firefox and chrome as
well as safari
can load the desktop versions of
websites by default instead of the dinky
little mobile version
but while i've learned to love using the
ipad as a laptop
almost as much as i love lttstore.com
if you're going to use an ipad as your
main machine be aware that ipad os
is still very much a work in progress
while they've promised full
functionality is coming
adobe apps are still not quite at a
desktop class level
there are however great alternatives
like procreate affinity illustrator and
lumafusion
microsoft's native mouse support for
office on ipad is apparently coming but
it hasn't rolled out to our machine yet
so the mouse still acts like a
transparent finger
instead of a proper cursor and while the
ipad airs usb-c
port means it can easily connect to
external monitors and thus compensate
for its tiny tiny screen
ipad os has yet to add the ability to
extend its display
instead of just duplicating it so if
you've been following our ipad pro
coverage up till now you might be
thinking
this is more or less the same story as
last time it can be
is a laptop but only for a specific type
of person
the type of user who loves ipads and
wants to make ipad os work for them
and has some money to blow but while the
overall story might be the same
this is still an important moment to me
because this is the first ipad video
we've made in the last couple years that
isn't about
challenging this thing's existence as a
laptop replacement
ipads officially are laptops now and not
just ipad pros
maybe next year we might actually
recommend that you get one
