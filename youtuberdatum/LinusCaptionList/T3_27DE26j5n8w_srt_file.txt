ladies and gentlemen welcome to the wan
show we've got a fantastic show for you
lined up today
lots of big news including of course
the slightly embarrassing attack
on instagram from signal where
they actually created an ad campaign
that
showed people what facebook knows about
them
right in the ad in other news there's uh
some developments in the epic
epic versus apple court saga
um it's an epic saga about epic versus
apple i'm sorry if that was a little
confusing what else we got luke
uh life or death of the paywall there's
an airbag
that will only deploy if you have your
payments up to date so if you let that
credit card expire
you might just die um also
disney built a really really genuinely
cool looking lightsaber that i'm excited
to show everyone really that's one of
your headline topics
not that sennheiser doesn't make
headphones anymore okay i forgot
because that's that doesn't even that's
not even like technically a
i don't know what's going on with that i
would okay i would give that one my
spots but i don't know what that is
because it's not a topic
all right we're going to talk about that
and more let's roll that intro
[Music]
and the show is brought to you today by
i'm pretty sure uh ridge wallops in
there ridge wallet honey
and squarespace up what the
luke you're gone what you're a gone boy
oh wow and you're back all right and the
sun went behind the clouds since i
adjusted my lighting so i'm gonna go
ahead and fix that
and we can jump real quickity styles
into our first
topic of the day which is of course
i forget i forget what i said as the
first topic actually
oh that was the signal thing ah yes oh
my gosh this is
so actually amazing funny it's almost as
funny as
i have invisible cursor syndrome on my
computer right now so i can see where my
mouse highlights things
but i can't actually see where it is
that sounds super annoying but uh on
tuesday
the encrypted messaging service named
signal uh published a blog post
explaining that they had bought
ads on instagram that would show users
how they were targeted
and some of the examples of this are are
actually
they're pretty spectacular yeah yeah
like they're they're really great i
actually really like this
um i'm gonna
i'm gonna try and click them i'm gonna
do it
the ads are done mad lib style you'll
you'll hopefully see it soon
with facebook's ad targeting
characteristics filling in the blank so
it would like describe you
and the things that you're into uh user
would see an ad describing what facebook
knows about them essentially which
is in a lot of cases i suspect quite
accurate um
after starting what appears to be a test
campaign
in their screenshot signals ad account
was disabled completely
in the least surprising move ever um but
none of them were able to get posted
which there we go kind of blows but i
actually think that would have been
really cool
that's that's an ad that i would
actually probably like to see
you know uh this is great so here's some
examples you got this ad because you're
a
newlywed pilates instructor and you're
cartoon crazy this ad used your location
to see you're in
la jolla i don't know how to pronounce
that you're into parenting blogs and
thinking about lgbtq adoption
so there's a whole bunch of examples of
exactly the kind of stuff that facebook
totally
actually does know about you you got
this ad because you're a gp with a
masters in art history
also divorced this ad used your location
to see you're in london your online
activity shows you've been getting into
boxing and you're probably getting there
on your new motorcycle
it's funny to me because it's not even
i i don't know why it's so shocking to
read something like this like luke
if you saw that in the side banner of
your
of your browser it would grab me for
sure wouldn't it
wouldn't you look at it and go because
there's one difference between being
like oh i don't care i don't have
anything to hide they can have my data
and having it actually all served back
out to you from a third
party and realizing like oh holy crap
no this is what they're doing with it
like that makes me a lot more
uncomfortable
exactly like you got this ad because
you're a kpop loving chemical engineer
and you have a new baby and just moved
and you're really feeling those
pregnancy exercises lately it's like
yeah all of that is exactly the kind of
crap that people
would definitely post on facebook and
give it absolutely no thought whatsoever
well yeah whatever who cares if people
know that like i'm feeling my pregnancy
exercises except
it's not the kind of thing that you
would
actually bring up necessarily in a
conversation with strangers like if you
went to your
if you went to your spouse's work
barbecue
you know what i mean you just if you're
not okay telling the random person
that's sitting across from you on the
train yeah that you're a leo and signal
or it's leo and signal sorry excuse me
the ads were
for signal if you're a leo and single
you know like if you wouldn't wear if
you wouldn't wear a shirt that says it
on it
then some people would to be fair but
we're just giving the example but then
maybe it isn't the kind of thing that
you're
actually comfortable with even if you
feel like you might be comfortable
because you're not confronted with what
the
actual truth is of this information i
mean honestly
i would love to get these ads and find
out what facebook thinks of me i suspect
that facebook google um
probably to a much much lesser extent
amazon know pretty much
all there is to know about me like mine
would be something along the lines if
you got this ad because you're
a tech bro and you have however many
kids
and you're super into reading fanfics
of yourself and luke lafreniere we don't
really get that
but well those are pretty good yep some
of them some of them are you know most
excellent high literature
um and for some reason
i don't care about it but it would still
be really unnerving
to have like i would almost feel like if
i had that information
on my screen and i or like i'm at my
computer right
and my mom you know someone that i'm
close to but don't necessarily tell
everything to you know what i mean
and if my mom was sitting next to me i
would worry
what's the next banner ad gonna have in
it you know what i mean
yeah like it's a it's an amount of depth
of information that it's
it's just because everything in that one
was something yeah you know what yeah
i'm okay with this
um doesn't mean that the next one would
be i mean
here's here's a really interesting one
you got this ad because you're a teacher
but more importantly you're a leo and
single
so i already said that part this ad used
your location to see you're in moscow
you like to support sketch comedy and
this ad thinks you do drag
it's like okay yeah doing drag whatever
to me
if you're in moscow that might not
actually be the coolest thing for
everyone to know
um from like a safety perspective i
don't mean that i
care if people dress and drag that's
totally up to them
but i'm not vladimir putin so my opinion
on that
in moscow um doesn't quite matter as
much as
certain other peoples do in terms of you
know making sure that
you're safe and and and okay right
um so it's just
man like you got this ad because you're
a certified public accountant in an open
relationship like how
i shouldn't say how would they know
stuff like that because
man i know people i know people on
facebook that post a lot of like
really intimate details actually
one about a lot of that kind of stuff uh
and just
kind of don't think at all about
what that might do to the kinds of
ads that they're getting and like how
they're profiled and the thing is like
contextual content on the internet
right it has a way of even
shaping you i mean we've seen that with
the echo chamber effect
in the extremely polarized political
climate
um the more that you get sort of
pigeonholed as as you know one of these
or
one of those and you're going to be fed
more and more of that content
more and more and more of that kind of
content to the leads to extremism and
everything else and i'm not going to say
you know
you shouldn't be in an open relationship
that could be the coolest thing ever and
you could be having
your best life i'm just saying that it's
not necessarily
conducive to really for realsies making
your own decisions
if all of a sudden you have these tech
giants that are going
this is who you are and creating this
positive feedback loop that
might make it hard for you to gain a
different perspective
and the same could go the other way i
really am not taking a position on that
one
it's just kind of it just feels
like a a disproportionate amount of
power to give to someone who thinks it's
chill to literally try to buy a hawaiian
island
you know did you see that like do you
see that like what
what even what even is that how much of
that hawaiian island does he own now and
people are like
just others there's there's no issues
with uh
with with wealth equality at all buying
like a large chunk of a continent is
totally fine
okay here we go here we go mark
zuckerberg bought another 600 acres
on kauai and hawaiians are
peeved off is the headline what hawaiian
island does zuckerberg
own yeah owns purchased clothes to blah
blah blah
according to public records yeah i don't
know how much of it
exactly they own part of the
northeastern part of the garden island
uh net worth is whatever bought 700
acres in 2014
for more than a hundred million like
we're talking
we're talking what fifteen hundred acres
at this point somewhere between a
thousand fifteen hundred acres
i just i can't even i can't even fathom
like that much land that that you you
couldn't
in a day you couldn't walk the entire
thing not even close you know what i
mean
like how big is disneyland how big is
disneyland in acres
all right okay disneyland's a hundred
acres
so we're talking this enormous
this enormous hawaiian paradise that is
over 10 times the size of disneyland
park and
and my favorite my favorite thing about
this
is how how obvious it is
you know what i mean like think about
it luke you're mark zuckerberg right
okay yeah your image right now is that
you're some kind of lizard person
who doesn't really you know fully
understand human emotion you just try to
emulate it and you know try not to get
called in for congressional hearings too
often so you can
hang around and do whatever it is that
you do in your hoodie
to be clear i'm not i'm not mocking the
ceo hoodie i rock the ceo hoodie every
day i'm super down
thank you mark for normalizing it anyway
the point is
okay how obvious it is right everyone
already thinks that you're some kind of
alien overlord so why not
just buy a hawaiian island and create a
doom fortress
okay yeah maybe maybe he's going back
to his uh lizard overlords and he's
saying
uh you know like we don't really need to
invade i could just slowly buy the
planet
it's fine just happen over time i'm
going to start with
one of the most attractive areas it's
fine
yeah navy retired has another good one
here bill gates has almost
half of the grazing land in the u.s yeah
bill gates is buying up farmland
at just like an astonishing rate
uh you know quietly doing philanthropy
or whatever that is
um but actually
you know it's kind of funny how someone
can be a career philanthropy
philanthropist and be richer today than
they were when they retired from the
head of
one of the world's largest companies
like hold on a second yeah
how does this math work how are you
giving away money how are you making
money by giving away money
i don't i don't think it works that way
the last time i gave away money i'm
pretty sure that i didn't get
more back in return that's not giving
away money that's an investment that's
not the same thing
i had no idea this was a thing gates
owns at least 242
000 acres of american farmland something
like that yeah
yeah it's ridiculous um yeah it's a it's
a whole play
into like smart farming or something
something something and it's all being
messaged as
like a an investment in sustainability
but the thing about
sustainability is that um it can't be
sort of at the uh
at the at the will of someone who's in a
position of
kind of unfathomable power right like
you're
i don't know it's because he wants to
ban beef oh please
uh anyway why don't we go ahead and move
on to
our next topic um
what did we say was going to be our uh
our our well we go out of order from oh
let's do your disney lightsaber all
right it's
cool tell us about it tell us about it
uh so it lights up from its core
so like lights the the the toy
lightsabers that you could buy forever
were either always
one large piece like it's always
extended and it and it like
looks pretty good but it's always
extended you can't retract it
or they extend but they only glow from
the base
so they kind of look like junk but at
least they extend so they're often
more fun to play with um this one
lights up from its core as far as i i
looked at some stuff on twitter about
how people think it works and all this
kind of stuff
and as far as my understanding goes it's
essentially a chain of leds
that gets unraveled along with the tube
when it goes up but like the
the realistic level just got massively
cranked up
um really cool that video apparently
doesn't have any special effects
that's just what the lightsaber looks
like which is pretty cool
yeah so this is this is what this is how
they think it works
that's pretty cool pretty wicked
i could be i could be pretty into that
um
at a recent virtual press conference
disney parks chairman josh jamaro
uh briefly revealed what onlookers have
called a real lightsaber after studying
the patent
wow okay that's pretty cool
it's like actually pretty wicked
it's like this chain of leds that goes
out um apparently there is no
current notable like we are going to
sell this
thing uh some people are thinking
they're gonna keep it to themselves for
a little while to help promote the
the star wars experience that that's
happening down there um
and then maybe it'll it'll be for sale
in like a couple or a few years or
something like that so they can keep the
hype around the experience for a while
right and then yeah because star wars is
about
keeping hype not rebuilding it right now
oh boy i'm sorry is there star wars hype
right now luke help me out here
i haven't watched it yet but i've heard
good things about bad batch
okay all right it's all the side content
it's not the the mainline movies are
just
i mean they've become terrible right
like the sequel series is horrible but
um the side content's been pretty
alright
yeah uh no idea how sturdy
it's gonna be i mean that's a major
concern if the idea
is just to like hold it and wave it
around and look like a badass then
that's somewhat cool but if they're
actually
rugged enough that you could even whack
them a little
that would be next level i mean that's
the kind of thing that people will
literally wait five hours in line so
they can
pose in a selfie or like uh maybe not a
selfie but you know
post a story or whatever else like 15
seconds of
them and their esso you know igniting
lightsabers and then
you know um yeah that looks like lots of
fun
uh one of our other topics for the day
is did tesla buy gigabyte
gigabyte now has pre-builts on their
website called the model x
and model s and if these don't look like
cars
i'm going to be extremely disappointed
uh let's go ahead and fire this up not
even remotely
just to spoil your day wow my
my disappointment is immeasurable and my
day is ruined
so it's the 12 core 5900x with a 3080
graphics card
where's my gullwing doors okay hold on a
second
design concept we looked at a car
and we got as far as the name and then
we got bored
and made a computer case got it
thank you um okay
air in the front and out the top and the
back that's
an innovation rgb that's new
expansion okay in all seriousness it
looks fine it's just
why is it called the model x why is it
not though
like that's what like does it matter i
don't know
okay fine model i mean x has been done x
has been done for years in the pcs
have both been done in the pc hardware
space when has s been done
okay maybe that's more of a car thing oh
yeah the cars
you know s whatever s-class
stuff sometimes because there's been gt
gtx gts
okay all right that's true but i think
it's definitely not very common
i think the gt was like the kind of the
performancy part and then x was just
like
x for extreme and then s is just like oh
crap
um okay but less extreme than that you
know super or supreme or whatever you
want to call it now for my part if i was
looking at sort of the design story of
these i would go
um how did this end up being called
model s
because it looks just like an xbox
series x
yeah that's actually a good point flip
the names around guys to do better
yeah come on guys oh hold on actually
hold on there we go so it uses the same
chat pointed out uh xbox
series s yeah yeah yeah yeah xbox series
s
that's that's true that samsung galaxy s
27 ds
define 2070 s is short for super and the
s
is for silent in the define s
this is pretty cool so they've um
they've managed to rip off the name
of a tesla car the form factor of a
microsoft game console and the
cooling of the mac trash can it's not
triangular
so it's only uh like a sandwich style
from two sides
you can see here you got your graphics
card over here and your motherboard over
here but that should actually work
really well having a shared heatsink
apple has shown us works
way better than you would necessarily
think
like you instead of yeah all the crimes
that have happened
in in model names for for hardware
do they deserve do they deserve this
berating attack we've given them because
i don't really think so i think this is
fine
i think blatantly naming your computers
after cars that they have nothing to do
like
okay it's not like it's not like
tesla is some regional car brand or
something
it's not like you know some that part of
the world nobody
has ever heard of tesla and or or the
car has a different name
you know like you've seen that before in
the past right like the um
oh the suzuki swift was also the pontiac
firefly
was also the geo metro they were all the
same car but
it might have varied depending on the
region or depending on the manufacturer
that was using the same
uh the same platform right yeah but
that's not the case here
there could there could conceivably be
people in gigabytes native taiwan that
you know drive home from work in their
model s
and then go up to their apartment and
play games on their model s
and that's just really stupid
and then and then when they're done go
back and get in their car
and play games on their model s
because you can play you can play games
in a tesla
that was the joke so yes i think i think
they deserve
it not because it's offensive or
anything
but because it's just really really
stupid
that's why that's why they put a
different word that if they used x
and s but put like i was to say series
but
microsoft
[Laughter]
independently come up with pretty much
the dumbest names microsoft's ever had
for a console which is
truly which is truly a spectacular
achievement
yeah yeah how do they keep getting worse
at it i just
don't understand it play sony set the
bar
so low our game console won
two three four five and they're okay
there was some there was some messy
stuff in there
you know oh uh retroactively now that's
psx and also there's the ps1 but like
like
like o-n-e it's really small you know
like there was definitely
some dumb stuff in there from sony but
truly nothing even
close to microsoft's nonsense i haven't
followed playstation enough i knew about
like the slim editions and stuff like
that but
i didn't know about the the one and
stuff that's that's sad
to hear that they went that direction oh
yeah that thing was super
cool though i remember my first time
seeing it this is hilarious my first
time seeing it was
actually at um at ikea
and it was just like one of the
cardboard fake ones
and i had only ever seen it online so i
didn't realize like how small it is but
here here i'm
showing my display capture oh right i
forgot about the one with the built-in
display the ps1
combo just found that yeah that's
kind of awesome yeah the man that thing
was that thing was super cool like
there's the ps1 combo
uh right next to a controller which
gives you a really good idea of the
scale of it
we actually have one of them kicking
around the office i think our intention
was to like build it into something like
we wanted to do like an
ultimate playstation and it was just
gonna have like all the playstations
built into one chassis
because you don't even have to have that
many of them you just have to have
a ps3 with the um with the hardware
backwards compatible so one of like
compatibilities one of the launch ps3s
and then a ps4 and a ps5
all cooked into one thing but this was
pre-ps5 so it was just going to be two
boxes
but then there was some reason we wanted
the ps1 and i don't
i don't i don't remember what it was it
was probably it was probably dumb which
is probably why we never did it
what can i say uh what else we got today
that's
uh really really compelling news that we
definitely need to talk to you guys
about airbag
i think we could jump to the airbag you
know what let's talk about the airbag
this is some
dystopian level right here like i don't
even know
i don't even know what my stance is on
this go ahead and hit me
so a motorcycle apparel company named
klim i believe that's how you
say it uh sells an airbag vest
so a vest that you wear while you're on
your motorcycle called the ai-1
for 400. and but these are totally a
thing actually i first learned about
these
for or like like high-tech wearable
like safety equipment um when i was at a
snowboard shop
and they showed me this backpack and i
was like
what the hell is it about this backpack
that could make it be
worth like a thousand dollars or
something like that and they're like oh
it has like an emergency
avalanche deployment inflatable thing
yeah the balloon thing yep so people can
like find you so people can like find
you and it gives you enough air to
breathe and i was like
oh okay i guess so the the sales rep was
really rude like treated me like i was
some kind of complete idiot
for not thinking that avalanche
preparedness was important i was like
no you jerk i just didn't know that
that's what it does
obviously otherwise i wouldn't be like
what does this backpack
cost a thousand dollar anyway uh yeah go
go ahead i'm sorry i totally cut you off
there
no no worries uh so yeah when you buy it
for with 400
uh it does nothing at all that you are
you are not done you need to continue
spending money
uh you you have to activate the vest in
a companion app no no no when you buy it
for 400
you you uh it's you need to buy it for
an oh okay yeah yeah okay so
you buy it for 400 bucks and you know
what
i don't actually know maybe there's some
amount of time included
i don't know that part but it is timed
so you need to lease it at least the
functionality of it because you've
bought the hardware
and it does nothing for 400 after
whatever your trial period is
yeah so you lease it for uh 12 a month
to 120 a year or you pay another 400
doubling the cost to 800 total dollars
uh
to to just buy it outright and have it
work forever okay and the idea is that
this airbag vest
inflates if you fall effectively kind of
trying to keep you safe if you
if you crash and this tech like this
tech works they they have a bunch of
different examples of this
um there was i think we talked about it
on wan show like a
a few years ago there was a helmet which
is
which was essentially i think it was
like built into your jacket or something
and then if you fell on a bicycle it
wasn't designed for a motorcycle if you
fell on a bicycle it would inflate and
wrap around your head
um which would i think some like
students from
somewhere made it um
yeah very interesting i what keeps
getting me is like
my my credit card expired a while back
and there was like a couple different
services that i forgot to update
sure uh and they like i i guess they
emailed me but i don't really check my
personal email that often
right i don't really use my personal
email for very many things to be
completely honest i
basically just checked my work ones um
and it just the the service stopped
working i was like what the heck what's
going on
then i figured out oh i need to update
my credit card if that happens with this
you die well there's a 30-day grace
period okay
okay that's helpful i guess but past the
30-day grace period
you i literally would be wearing a 400
accessory that does not
work and will not deploy and you would
actually
potentially if not die like it may not
be the difference between life and death
but it could be the difference between
levels of injury um and so here's this
is a direct quote from the company
it's like guaranteed death if it doesn't
deploy i guess i was a little bit too
hardcore there but if customers choose
to ignore the indicators and ride with
inbox is that what it's called inactive
that's on them
and we can expect it not to inflate in
the event of a crash
so imagine i mean it's one of those
things where okay
i understand their business model is to
be paid for their product
obviously right like if you don't pay
for the product then
you shouldn't have the product but then
imagine for a second
being the person who like let's let's do
let's talk a hypothetical
right you can freeze time so
you're watching okay you're watching
this happen
someone gets like someone gets the back
of their motorcycle clipped
as they go through an intersection and
the bike is wobbling
right and they're heading into a turn
and they're gonna
they're gonna slam into like a solid
object
basically that's gonna happen okay time
is frozen
and you have the option to
for four hundred dollars save them
and you go i don't know they probably
should have paid the four hundred
dollars ahead of time
that's on them do would you think it's
better
imagine being the kind of sociopath
that's like
because i could okay i could see them
having it inflate anyway
and then sending collections after you
or something
okay so that's what i was gonna say do
you think it would be better if it does
inflate anyways but it costs
eight hundred dollars
oh interesting so you have to
pay a like lapsed subscription fee
if it goes off so it's more like paying
for
going off insurance and less like
actually paying for the
raw functions they still save your life
but they're they're kind of like hey
dude what the heck like
you weren't paying your after active
subscription we we saved you out of the
money grabbing part of our hearts you
owe us a bunch of money
would that be better to you way better
way better
way better because to me it just comes
especially if that was clearly
communicated that that's how that would
work right because
the software has a moment like
this product has an opportunity mom
spaghetti
to save someone or let them potentially
be
horribly injured or get dead this is a
paying customer and that's something
that's just
really um really frustrating to me about
the whole internet of things
by once pay forever kind of model is
just because someone didn't you know buy
it and give you their money
exactly the way that you like them to or
enough
doesn't make them not a paying customer
all of a sudden you can't just
completely ignore them and treat them
like garbage literally let them die
yeah it's super awesome
uh thomas goff county says if you've
paid for the product shouldn't it just
bloody work
okay so that's where you get into the
economics of
you know functionality as a dlc right
because
here's the opposite or here's the
counter argument to that right
let's say in order for them to make
enough margin on this product their
actual target sell price would have to
be let's say 650
okay so somewhere between the buy out
right price of 800
and the least forever price or actually
okay the way that math would work would
probably be the other way the buy out
right price is probably like the bulk
price or whatever because people would
be expected to use this thing
for years and years right so let's say
their break even
break even where they're actually
profitable it's like 900
or something so here's my counter
argument if you only need this thing
let's say you live somewhere like oh i
don't know vancouver british columbia
right like me if you only need this
thing for
like four months out of the year then
it would be kind of great if all the
people who
buy it outright could subsidize you
only needing to pay four hundred dollars
up front which
you know maybe wasn't enough for them to
to make the margin that they needed to
make to be profitable
and then you know slowly pay you know
whatever that would work out to like
about 48 to 60
a year over the next five to 10 years
ultimately that could be more
more sensible and affordable i could
take that 400
i didn't spend up front or given i'm
gonna presumably use it for the first
season
that 350 or so dollars that i didn't
spend up front and i could put it in an
index fund or something
and ultimately if i am excellent at
managing my money
i could actually come out ahead with
this you know leasing
option i i could i could save money and
the people who buy it out right actually
okay i probably got the math wrong it
doesn't matter the people who buy it
outright
or the people who can't afford the
upfront
but can afford the subscription 12
months a year forever because they're
not good at managing their money like
they could
they can subsidize me that's the
argument
and you end up in these same kinds of
conversations when you talk about things
like
the um the heated rear seats in the
model 3 i think is the one where it kind
of broke news
where they build it into every single
car and then you activate it after the
fact
because for tesla it's more economical
from a manufacturing standpoint to just
put it in every car
but it does have an actual cost so the
people who want it
can subsidize that manufacturing cost
and they end up paying a bit extra
but that way the people who don't want
it can save a buck but then from
my point of view if you're claiming that
your company is all about saving the
planet then you just shouldn't consume
materials that you're not planning to
actually
you know activate or do something with
or whatever the case may be
and to be clear because i think i think
some people in the chat are are getting
off base here
they have an option you can just pay 800
bucks more or less up front
absolutely it works forever something
else that might be going on here and
something that might muddy the waters
here as well is like
this is a apparel company
this is a pretty high-tech device yep
they might not have done any of the
software for this so they might have to
pay
like a licensing fee for each user
um that this detection of collision
whatever
stuff is running on so they might like
they might have to pay out of pocket
monthly for each one of these users so
they need a monthly
uh thing for it but then that doesn't
make a ton of sense because you can pay
400 up front but maybe there's a way
that they can buy out
a user blah blah i don't know it depends
on like what kind of fees are going on
in the background
but yeah it's uh
so it's interesting
says after paying the subscription on
the klim for three to four years you
don't need to pay the subscription
anymore so it's
more like a it's more like a financing
option then so i'm guessing you pay just
a little bit extra that way so their
target would then be
eight hundred dollars i
i don't know man i don't know what to
tell you i think there's a better
solution
on the one hand i'm in favor of making
the barrier to entry
for life-saving technology lower so if
klim says
okay by making it cost 400 and then be
60 120 a year we are able to get this
into the hands of people who would
otherwise have to save up for longer in
order to have it
maybe they die while they're saving up
their money right you can make that
argument
there could be lives being saved by them
having a lower barrier to entry
but then the flip side of it being just
like well yeah i don't know it's not on
till you die
um i don't think that's really the right
solution either i think having it
activate and then going after you with a
penalty
is probably the the not morally
reprehensible
way to handle this what about what about
another option where there's there's
only two ways to pay
there's the 400 up front or if you agree
to the 120 a year or 12
a month thing you have to lock in
for four years so that they get their
money yeah but the thing is like what
the the edge case we're talking about
here that we started with was
you know maybe um losing or canceling
your credit card
so just because you're locked in doesn't
mean they can actually get the money
from you and that's
exactly the kind of situation where you
might end up dying now to be clear it's
it'll light up and tell you that it's
that it's activated but
i mean i don't know man i know a lot of
people who
don't pay that close attention we're
talking this high technology
app-controlled vest
and i don't want to generalize but like
bikers
are not necessarily the youngest most
tech savvy people all the time um i mean
i thought motorcycles are one of those
things that millennials are killing
yeah what's the latest probably
millennial apparently millennials are
killing coca-cola
yeah that's yeah yeah i don't know which
is great like heck yeah
let's get rid of it good job hey hey
whoa whoa whoa whoa luke that's a very
controversial take
i i don't want to kill coca-cola i need
you know i i'm i'm super into coca-cola
are you
well not the north american swill that
we
that we can buy but the man the sugar
cane coke
so good so good i'm like i'm lucky i
don't live somewhere where you can
actually buy good coca-cola
yeah i heard like some
there's some weird stuff here on
coca-cola i don't want to necessarily
say things on the lan show because i
don't know how much of it is like
true necessarily or whatnot um
so yeah i don't really want to go into
it but i heard something about
yeah i actually don't want to go into it
at all but you can look up like
weird things with coca-cola and there's
some really odd stuff with them
needing to potentially pay like 500
million dollars in a lawsuit because
of deaths um wow and
death squads look up coca-cola death
squads
find some stuff that sounds like a heck
of a rabbit hole
i don't know if it ended up yeah i don't
know i don't know i don't know i just i
had a google news thing pop up on my
phone this morning
saying that like millennials millennials
canceled it because of that
and i was like what are you talking
about never heard of this before
probably has more to do with um it just
not being trendy like
when's the last time you were like oh
yeah coke is that's a cool drink
well everyone knows that nestle is doing
like tons of
like super evil things and people still
buy nestle products all the time so
i it would definitely be because it's
not trendy oh yeah i mean i don't think
i don't think there's anything
i don't think there's anything the
coca-cola company could do to be more
evil than nestle
it's a pretty that's a pretty high bar
right there
you know you know who's not evil we hope

off we've got some other good topics to
talk about today
epic versus apples epic sega
continues epic epic versus apples
thing really quick i looked it up uh it
was thrown out of court
due to lack of evidence due to lack of
evidence all right yeah
so who knows so who knows if they tried
to organize
any kind of uh hitman
stuff yeah never know moving on
um epic versus apple this monday may 3rd
marked the start of the epic vs apple
trial but didn't start out smoothly
fans of both parties oh no
found the call-in number and interrupted
the proceedings before the court got
things under control
the call-ins were somewhat amusing but
they were disruptive please don't do
that
one of the key arguments that apple is
making concerns microsoft
and xbox and when i say xbox there's a
reason that i didn't get specific
because
xbox for microsoft has become kind of a
muddy term luke what is xbox
it's like everything microsoft does in
regards to gaming
okay so it's not a console anymore it's
not a store
it's not an um oh man
do they call it location on your
computer yeah yeah it's not just an
application on your computer it's like
it's not being able to play games
through the cloud yeah
it's all of these things together it's
it's all of it together uh so anyway
uh one of the arguments that apple's
making is about microsoft and xbox
they're saying that
mac os and windows are both open desktop
operating systems
while ios and xbox are closed
specialized operating systems and they
both feature a 70 30 revenue split on
digital purchases so therefore
because microsoft is doing it it cannot
be evil and
cannot violate antitrust law so it must
be okay for us to do it too
i did okay i made up that last bit
epic's counter argument
xbox consoles are sold at a loss digital
purchases are their only
profit generator for the platform also
incidentally
microsoft recently cut their take on
games on the microsoft store to 12
percent
uh presumably as a response to
competition in the market from the likes
of
well epic games epic argues that the
iphone is
more like a pc than a specialized gaming
console
that is sold for the purposes of
having people subscribe to gaming
services and buy games to run on it
so the apps for business models should
be more like the microsoft store the
epic game store
or even mac os where apps can be
installed from anywhere
all right pretty solid argument i think
we probably saw this one coming
also released court documents have
revealed some interesting things
in 2011 apple discussed reducing the app
store apple tax
phil schiller head of the app store
emailed eddie q and steve jobs saying
once we are making over a billion
dollars a year in profit from the app
store
is that enough to then think about a
model where we ratch it down from
70 30 to 75 25 or even 80 20
if we can maintain a billion dollar a
year run rate
you know what i never knew that phil
schiller was so cool
like come on guys come on guys
a billion dollars a year run rate that
seems pretty good
maybe we could just maybe we could just
like make a cool billion dollars a year
and that'd be like
chill right it's all good we don't need
more than a billion dollars a year from
you know app developers nope not good
enough
yes they do yes they do
uh microsoft inadvertently got shadow
kicked
from the app store they emailed apple
asking how shadow could be in the app
store but xcloud couldn't
and shortly afterwards shadow's ios app
was suddenly suspended
um shadow came back but was suspended a
year later in february 2021
shadow says that apple didn't understand
that they stream a full windows pc
rather than a library of games
luke i find that hold on a second
i find that very difficult to believe
because because
apple's adjudicators and reviewers
for the app store um are
very very well versed
um no no no they're very well versed
in all the different subtleties of the
differences and functionalities between
apps they're very thorough they offer
prompt communication
they do offer fairly uh
if they don't need to do anything and
they can just say
no they do tend to offer pretty prompt
communication
if there's any actionable items or they
maybe need to say yes
or they need to actually do their jobs
in any way
that could take a bit longer but um yeah
just saying no screw off that
that does tend to happen fairly quick uh
in other news tim sweeney thinks epic
game store will be profitable
and make up 35 to 50 percent of the pc
gaming market by 2024.
and there's there's a note on here that
says lol okay but
i would argue if they continue their
hyper-aggressive spend
to give away free games he might be
right
tell me something luke yeah
how many epic game store games do you
have installed right now
none okay ask me something luke
but i don't think you would go ahead and
ask me don't you have to ask me
all right linus yeah how many epic game
store games do you have installed hold
on let me find out i don't really know
the answer uh it's hard to
tell because um in order to check that i
would have to
open the launcher which i don't appear
to have what's up guys
who's in the chat team ebj oh sup y'all
your thing was uh your thing was
yesterday dawg
or uh before that or something i don't
know i can't remember
um yesterday yeah was it yesterday all
right yeah yeah sorry
this week's this week's been a blur man
um so i i wish i wish mr sweeney
luck with that i don't necessarily think
that it's going to play out
exactly like that i think i think there
is an
extremely large amount of people who
played fortnite
and therefore got used to the epic games
launcher i think there are an extremely
large amount of people that still play
fortnite because it's still a very
popular game not at its peak anymore but
it's still
huge uh and i think if they keep giving
away stuff like gta
civ all these like major titles that
people play
if they keep pushing that i think
adoption is going to be really high
in but when
now i understand why you were making the
argument you were making
okay you were like yeah totally they can
they can buy
fifty percent of like yeah that's like
business as long as they actually
give it away yes yes you're right they
could do that
all right well the combination of that's
a little tough good luck
i don't know he also said pc gaming
market yeah
yeah all right
i'll roll that one back a little bit
anyway
uh in other news what else we got here
uh calm oh there's a discount code
right we have a promo yeah that's right

try to be really careful with it

in other news luke
we are now both wearing headphones from
a company
that just sold their headphone division
yeah okay wait what right
they sold their entire consumer audio
division which makes headphones
sound bars and dax to a swiss-based
medical hearing company called sonova
holding a g
which specializes in hearing aids and
cochlear implants
for those of you who aren't familiar
cochlear implants are a type of
implant that replace some of the
functional components of your inner ear
so you can actually
it's a lot more complicated than this
but basically
if you have suffered hearing loss you
can get one of these implants and
assuming all the conditions all the
stars align
you can restore some amount of hearing
my understanding is at least this is how
it used to work that you if you have
residual natural hearing
you actually kind of have to scoop all
that out so you're left with only the
artificial hearing so it's like
it's a whole it's a whole thing i'm not
i'm not promoting or not promoting it
one way or the other i'm just saying
that's what they are and sonova holding
ag
now owns the sennheiser headphone
business
the thing that's really mind-blowing to
me is sennheiser
talks about how or talked about a while
back
how they you know don't make money
on headphones and i'm kind of sitting
here going
okay i get it because we saw their r d
facility you were you were there with me
when we did the german tour right
yeah yeah because we went to cherry as
well um the only way that sennheiser
could
not be making money on headphones based
on the actual
like materials cost of a pair of
headphones and
how much they charge for them and the
kind of volume that sennheiser moves
is if there's just a lot of
um like a lot of cost associated with
bringing to market
products that don't don't move the kind
of volume like sennheiser
has a very broad product mix and guys
like we've been going through a process
launching a product for ltt store which
hasn't launched yet but
um it will where we've
had to do actual custom tooling and like
injection molding uh parts for
the for the final assembly of this
product and
let me tell you when you buy a pair of
headphones on like
amazon or ebay or something for like 22.
it is it is absolutely
mind-boggling that that that can be done
the kind of volume of that product that
you have to move in order to make up for
the upfront costs of setting up the
machines to
to injection mold these plastic parts
and that that kind of thing it's just
it's crazy like you can easily spend
like six figures on just even like a
small
a small device that has you know five or
six
different components actually well in
excess of that easily
so i can see how maybe there would have
been
management issues or bloat that might
have made it hard
for them to make a profit with their
headphone division
but it just seems like the kind of thing
that
could have been fixed
i yeah don't no
especially because like when we went on
that tour the amount of
pedigree that company has is ridiculous
and like the
the story is so
deep and crazy just to sell it off seems
weird yeah apparently they
also sold the rights to continue using
the sennheiser brand
on these products which is really
baffling to me because it seems like
sennheiser is holding on to its
professional audio division
so you could potentially have this
reputation
that sennheiser has for building great
audio products
compromised by a company
yeah i'm i'm just honestly i'm just
kind of blown away like it just seems
like the kind of problem that
was solvable you know and it always
constitutes consumer headphones like at
what level does that
begin and end is is this just their
entire headphones division and their
their pro
audit because like i'm i'm on their
website but there's
there's it doesn't actually seem to
divide very nicely i would imagine
basically anything headphones that
sennheiser makes would be considered
consumer yeah yeah um but you're
including like hd 800 and above
absolutely that would still be consumer
high-end consumer but it's still
it's still consumer and like what it
wouldn't include is something like uh
like a shotgun microphone
like professional audio equipment so i'm
yeah i'm just i'm just blown away it
seems like it should have been fixable
like you said
sennheiser's expertise sennheiser's
brand story should have made them an
unstoppable behemoth in this space but
they just
couldn't get it down i mean it's no
secret that i love the products i mean i
can literally use any headphones in the
world i want
but nothing nothing just
does it for me like these do maybe part
of the problem is these are hd 600s
these are a product from like
the late 80s that's what i was going to
say is i i think they had a really hard
time modernizing sorry
90s 97. um i think it was the
what was it the what what came before
the 600s it doesn't matter the point is
this is a 25 year old product um
and i just i haven't they haven't built
anything
that to me is so much better that i
need to upgrade to it and so maybe
that's maybe that's part of the problem
maybe they just built it too good
yeah and like i've had these since like
basically right out of high school
yeah you've had them the entire time
i've known you and i think all you've
done is replaced the
uh the pads yeah like quite a few times
at this point like to the point now
where i can't i have to buy them from
like third parties because sennheiser
doesn't sell the ear pad replacements
anymore sennheiser you're never gonna
sell your ear pad replacements anymore
luke you're done bud
oh this is really disappointing um
i don't know it's it's just that's i
mean that's it i think they had a hard
time modernizing i know
um at least when when i was back doing
reviews and when i think you guys did
more audio reviews because i don't think
it's
a huge thing for you guys anymore but um
a lot of their modernization efforts
they weren't
they were weird they were still very
traditional
yeah very very traditional like
kind of um not afraid to pursue
trends but um
kind of feeling like there was an
attitude of being too good to do it like
it was kind of beneath them
like no we take this stuff actually
seriously like what do you mean shiny
plastic
beats ew um and to be clear
it's not like i disagreed with them but
at the end of the day
you know i mean we talked about this a
couple weeks ago why do i put up with
amazon's crappy um
policies why do why do we sell our
products on amazon because at the end of
the day
you know you got mouths to feed so
you're either going to lay off what they
lay off like 600 people or something
from their headphone division
so you're either going to lay off a
bunch of people or
you're going to just do what you got to
do
it's not like we're talking about a
morally reprehensible thing you're doing
it's just you know trying to crawl
out of your own butt and address the the
current market
condition right but if they just like
don't want to then i guess
like that's chill right the thing that's
really sad about this
is we are we are losing another company
where like you just talked about like
that's a 25 year old product
and i just mentioned that these
headphones are are ancient to me like
you can see on wancho you can see spots
where like
they've been dinged up and gamer rage
yeah
still fine i've i've sat on these um
other people have sat on these i
remember getting really really pissed
off at one of my friends
who went over to my house and they were
playing games on my computer and when
they left they put my headphones on
their chair
and then when they came back they sat on
them they were these
they're still fine i've walked away from
the computer and they've like hooked on
my chair and they've whipped across the
room they're still
fine they've moved tons of times i've
brought them with me on trips
they're still fine like they've survived
everything and
that's not very common anymore with
products
it's just not like planned obsolescence
is absolutely a thing
and sennheiser didn't do it and now
they're gone and that
should make people sad like genuine that
should make people sad
ah that's that is disappointing
i think that was pretty much it i mean
i'm driving a porsche now
we could talk about that
excuse me sorry sorry a porsche
um i i just
tried to figure out a way that i could
do that text-based meme audibly and it
just doesn't work
have you seen that though which one you
pronounce
porsche porsche not porsche but they
just they it's all
it's typed out yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
i get it i get it
um it's fine
i definitely feel that boomer energy
when i'm behind the wheel
it's the closest thing to like an
emotional experience that i've ever had
driving a car um
i'm just like i feel like i don't know
i'm still trying to figure out like how
to do this video because there's a lot
of stuff that's really cool it's chock
full of
amazing super cool technology i mean
obviously even to me
a stupid you know car pleb it is
noticeably a better driving experience
than anything i've ever touched like
yeah for sure yep it's real it's not
it's not fake
um but i i feel like such an imposter
behind the wheel
i don't i know that i'm not fully
appreciating this thing
and um i
yeah i know that i'm not cool enough to
be driving it
but here i am don't look through
it's it's pretty fun so far it's pretty
fun so far that
uh all right i think that's uh pretty
much it for the show
today thank you very much
ladies and gentle oh uh just to clarify
i did not buy a tai can
i am renting it for a month
so that's my compromise with my wife
that allows me to do car videos but not
actually have to spend
car money in order to do car videos
because a lot of manufacturers
um they're press cars they'll only lend
them out for a few days or a week tops
and that's just not enough time for us
to evaluate something like that
and make a video about it to the level
that we want to do it so we're just
outright refusing to do so and um
fortunately i think the the way this one
worked is it's actually a rental program
from either porsche directly or from one
of their dealerships i don't remember
exactly how it worked
uh unfortunately youtube glitched out
and i only have a handful of super chats
today
from the latter part of the show i'm
like sincerely sorry you guys
um but this is all i've got
uh alex says uh monopolies are bad why
hate epic as competition
we don't hate them as competition i mean
they've done some really dumb stuff that
and they've gotten some well-deserved
hate for it but we just
think that that was a very optimistic uh
outlook
what okay i don't know what that means
uh we need to figure out a way for
people like me can challenge linus on
super mario bros 3 battle mode even
though we're not on the same continent
man
super mario bros 3 battle mode is
already squishy enough in terms of
inputs that
it's a little random who's going to win
playing that game across continents with
that kind of lag
i think would be uh worse i had so
i know i mentioned at the beginning of
this as well but i had so much fun
watching that video oh
everyone that went up to you and
challenged you
at two of the games you should watch it
but everyone that challenged you at two
of the games i'm just like you're gonna
get tooled
and then every time someone picked that
third one i was like finally they
actually like
have paid attention i didn't know what
to do
i don't know if this made it into the
video i don't remember but i was just
chatting with one of the guys and i was
like hey what made you pick mortal
kombat
and he's like honestly i've just never
ever seen you play a fighting game yeah
i've been watching for years
i've never seen you touch a fighting
game so i figured you probably have no
idea what you're doing
and i was like got him
i love the guy that really wanted to
challenge me at beat saber
and was sure that he was going to slay
me at beats
he has clearly never watched any of my
beat saber streams you know what though
i have i have a really fun one coming up
soon
uh i don't think it's going to be a
video i don't know maybe we'll do a
float plane exclusive or something but
you know how i've said that david thinks
that after
one week of training he can beat me at
beat saber what
we now officially have money on the line
so it's ten to one
so i have to put up a hundred dollars to
his ten dollars
um and the challenge date i think is
it penciled in for uh the week
of the 17th so that's the week that he
has to train up and then probably that
weekend i'm going to stream this for
sure
he's going to take me on in beat saber
1v1 me rust
and we'll see if we'll see if he can
catch up in that time
all right luna says about to make you
guys go bankrupt we're doing a hundred
water bottles to brazil
um thank you for that uh cable feed says
bought abc's of gaming i'm a new uncle
and a 40-ounce water bottle nine days
ago do you know when i will get the
shipment
okay so a couple things number one we
had a huge order rush
so that did slow things down a little
bit i think we're pretty much recovered
from that but number two
worldwide shipping is basically a
cluster right now so you'll get it when
you get it
josh jlmg production says linus sadface
mousepad when
i mean it'll be weeks because of the
worldwide shipping situation we've had
we've had containers that are like
supposed to be picked up one month get
picked up like two months later
and then get delayed at the port and
then blah blah blah blah blah so i don't
wanna promise anything but we are gonna
do them
and i think that's pretty much it for
this week sup chp
hope you uh hope you have a better week
next week
we will see you again next week same bad
time
same bad channel okay john carlos morla
janow says hey what do you think about
the mkbhd video
he launched the video right as we went
live how much but you guys were
sitting here with me the whole time i
haven't watched it yet uh but i will
uh mark has made a right to repair video
so oh
nice yeah it's good good that the whole
movement is getting more attention guys
never forget
right to repair shivpe says thoughts on
anti-right to repair
my thoughts on anti-right to repair are
either
they're ignorant or they have some kind
of agenda and we need to figure out what
it is
because there is no there's there's no
you know red-blooded freedom-loving
[Music]
alignment that can possibly be
anti-right to repair
it just isn't compatible it's that
simple we made a video about it a couple
weeks ago
that i pretty much said everything that
i have to say
it's one of those videos where my writer
brought me the script and technically
there's a writing credit but i ended up
almost completely rewriting it during
script review
so that's that's what i had to say about
it i don't really have anything else to
add
all right see y'all later guys bye
oh man
[Music]
now this sennheiser thing is actually
like so sad i don't ever want to use
any other headphones why did you have to
go away
