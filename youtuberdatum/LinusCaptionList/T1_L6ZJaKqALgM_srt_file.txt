- Starting off as a livestreamer
can seem really scary
if you look at the expensive gear
that your favorite
personalities are using.
But I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret.
No come here.
As someone with over 12 years
of experience in this industry
it is not about how high
resolution your camera is
or how crystal clear your audio is.
It's about the content and
engaging your audience.
You can deal with the rest
of that stuff once you start
generating some income.
So today we're gonna show
you guys how for really cheap
or even free,
if you're willing to
get a little bit hackey.
You can create a complete
streaming slash video
recording set up to kick start your hobby,
or even a career in
online content creation.
Once you're streaming,
you're gonna want some sick visuals
to accompany your content,
which brings us perfectly
to today's sponsor,
OWN TV.
They provide overlays, alerts, panels,
and more for streamers.

For today we're gonna
assume that you're looking
to livestream and that you
intend to use a face cam.
If you're planning on filming VOD content,
or if you wanna stream without a camera,
you shouldn't have a problem
adapting these tricks
for your specific setup or
just skipping over the portions
you don't need.
Most people's first thought
when it comes to video
is the ubiquitous Logitech C920S,
but at nearly $70,
it's not the kind of thing
that I would consider
to be an impulse purchase.
Now you can go all the
way down the product stack
where Logitech C270 can be
had for around 25 bucks.
But with image quality
reminiscent of a laptop webcam,
it's kind of like throwing money away,
because you will have to
replace it eventually.
Fortunately, there's probably
a camera that's better
than most web cams sitting
in your pocket right now,
your phone.
Now I wouldn't necessarily
recommend doing this forever
due to wear and tear on both your battery,
and your device from the heat.
And it is a little annoying
to set up every time,
but using your phone is an awesome way
to get really high quality visuals
without spending any extra money.
If your rock an Android phone,
download the IP Webcam
app from the Play Store,
and once booted up,
enter the listed IP for your
device into your web browser,
copy the URL, and paste it
into OBS as a browser source
while adding forward
slash video to the end.
Set it to refresh the source
when the scene becomes active
so you have a quick way to
reset the feed if need be.
And we'd also recommend
setting the resolution
to 720p under Advanced,
along with turning down the stream quality
to make sure you're not pushing
your phone CPU too hard.
That'll at least help
keep heat under control.
On iOS you can achieve
practically the same thing
with an app called DroidCam.
You'll have to download
their software and install it
on your PC, enter the IP there,
and then you can just add it as
a video capture device in OBS.
It should default to 480p,
so run their HD Mode program
as admin and select 720p
if you so desire.
Now comes the question of
how to mount the phone?
If you have a coat hanger kicking around,
you can do some bending and
make a simple desktop stand,
or if you have a shelf or a
desk ledge above your monitor,
some tape or a clamp can
work pretty well as well.
If you're willing to spend
a few dollars phone tripods
can be had on AliExpress
for just a few dollars
and are a little bit more user friendly.
And bam, there you go, video.
Well mostly.
Relying on just your
monitor to light your face
can be a little jarring for your audience,
because dark scenes in
your game will make it hard
to see you and sudden bright
lights can blow you out.
A common fix for this is
a set of cheap soft boxes
like this Neewer kit on Amazon,
but it's got a problem.
It's almost $90,
and it requires a fair
bit of space to rig up.
So once again, we've got a free
or at least nearly free option.
Try using an old lamp
that you have kicking
around the house paired with
ideally a halogen lightbulb.
These are better than fluorescent
for getting consistent
and true to life colors
out of your camera.
But beware,
if you put them right next to you,
the light will probably be too harsh,
so try using wax paper
or some other kind of translucent
material as a diffuser,
or alternately, you can
just bounce them off a wall
to soften the light.
Just be careful when you're setting it up,
because halogen bulbs can get pretty hot
and you don't wanna start a fire.
For that reason,
this is actually one case
where we'd recommend spending
a few bucks.
Clamp lights like these from
our local hardware store,
can make things a lot easier,
because they can clamp
right to your monitor stand
or a nearby shelf and
they're powerful enough
to penetrate a diffusion
layer or bounce off the wall.
All right so video stream
is looking great so far,
but what about audio.
Well if you have a gaming headset,
that has a mic attached to it.
That's a great starting option.
If you don't and you aren't
looking to spend any money,
both of the apps that we mentioned earlier
have audio streaming
options through your phone.
For the IP Camera app,
copy the opus audio stream URL
and paste into OBS as a media source.
And if you're using DroidCam,
it will register as a system audio device.
So just set it up as a
mic in the OBS settings.
Finally, you'll need to
implement a Render Delay filter
on your video feed to get them synced up.
Now that's decent.
But because of the style
of microphone built in
to most phones,
chances are that you're gonna
pick up a lot of keyboard
and background noise.
It's probably fine for when
you're just getting started,
but one of your first
investments should be something
like the Fifine K669,
which we actually featured a while back
in our cheap mic roundup.
For just $34, it's pretty hard to beat,
and look it even comes with
a cute little stand-e-stand.
Put all that together then and bam.
You've spent somewhere
between zero and $50 dollars
on what I think is a fairly
competent streaming set up here.
All that's left is to get your stream key,
fire up your games, get some snacks,
and put some liquids in your
lttstore.com water bottle,
and of course check out
today's video sponsor.

Now if you'll excuse me,
I've gotta get back to my gaming.
Gamer like a gamer!
That's pretty sweet.
I mean you don't want anybody,
you don't want anybody to
see your lighting set up.
You got your light pointed at the wall.
You got your whatever this is.
Hold on a second, what is this?
Here's your lamp.
Oh, oh, I might have durped it.
- [Man] Did you stop the video?
- [Linus] I stopped
the, oh did I click it?
- [Man] I don't know.
- [Linus] I clicked it.
- Okay.
- I think I clicked it.
- See you later.
- See you later.
