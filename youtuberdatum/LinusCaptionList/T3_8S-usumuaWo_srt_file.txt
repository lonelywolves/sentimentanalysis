- [Cameraman] So what you
do today at work honey?
- I did something.
It involved white goo in my mouth.
What do you get when
you combine a 3D printer
with a mini fridge and some
confectionary know-how?
I'll tell you what you get.
The Cocoa Press,
a chocolate 3D printer
that may just be the most delicious thing
that we have ever reviewed.
And also one of the most challenging
because even under ideal conditions
chocolate is not easy to work with
and
extruding it through a tiny nozzle
without clogging or other issues?
Not exactly ideal conditions.
But the good news is we learned a lot
and we had a ton of fun using
it and eating our mistakes.
Hmm.
That's good.
What's also good is our sponsor GlassWire.

Damn, that is good.
Okay, all right.
I'll put this down for now.
3D printing,
it's all ready no walk in the park
and that's with plastics
one wrong parameter,
and
you're left with a failed print
and a bird's nest of goo,
which is probably the biggest
advantage of the Cocoa Press
because with this success or failure
they both taste equally sweet.
But the road to getting our hands
on our first chocolate
printer, hasn't been easy.
The first Cocoa Press that got sent to us
got absolutely demolished in shipping.
And while the replacement machine here
came in much better shape,
it did still get slightly
borked in transport.
So, I got to put that right out front,
our experience isn't the complete picture
but we'll give you a bit
more detail on that later,
first let's talk about the
who, and maybe more importantly
the why.
(laughter)
The creator of the Cocoa
Press, Evan Weinstein
started printing with
edible materials in 2014
by modifying a plastic 3D printer
with a custom syringe extruder
and a bunch of supporting mods
to deal with the difficult
thermal control problems
that chocolate presents.
Early versions of the
printer used air pressure
over a syringe of melted chocolate,
which was then cooled by a
subambient water cooling loop
with a Peltier element.
That is so cool,
and not that different
from the water-cooled chair
video that we did a while ago
V1 wasn't the end however,
and the cocoa press eventually
became this capstone
project at Penn State U.
With some help from the Pennovation center
a startup incubator, that's
attached to the school
and a small team of material
scientists and maker nerds,
he eventually created what
stands before us today.
Version four-ish.
Now Colin's been hands-on
with the Cocoa Press
for about a week now and as you can see,
some of our results are good, but others,
well, we have ones
that look quite literally like (bleep)
But we're still really
bullish on the device.
So, let's take a closer look at it.
It comes with presets
for the different kinds
of chocolate that you might want to use
and you dial them in up here
with this touchscreen panel.
You can load a full-size SD
card into the right up here
with your print files,
and if we open up the
double pane glass door,
we,
wait who this stuff in here?
lttstore.com,
right.
Inside, we find a very
unusual print chamber.
For starters, notice the wall
to wall, to ceiling to floor
stainless steel
and complete lack of exposed fasteners.
This is to facilitate
cleaning for food safety.
Cool, right?
Almost as cool, actually not even close
as the star of the show, the extruder.
Where this differs from the
plastic filament fed machines
that we use frequently is under the cover.
Here, we've got a stepper
motor hooked up to a syringe
with this stainless steel
chamber wrapped in heating pads.
Inside that chamber, you
place these pre-tempered
and shaped chocolate slugs like so
with the inner cylinder
locking into the head
on these two locking lugs.
There are two heater zones,
one for the body and one for the nozzle.
One cool note here
is that there's nothing
proprietary about the refills.
You could put in icing, cheese
whiz, your own chocolate,
whatever you want.
But for the purposes of this video
and limiting our variables,
we'll be sticking to the
included pre tempered chocolate
which really is delicious by the way.
Now that takes care of the
CNC chocolate dispensing
but
as for moving it around,
that's done with a CoreXY motion system.
CoreXY is just a fancy way
of laying out your motors and belts
that gives a few performance improvements
over traditional Cartesian machines.
In traditional Cartesian machines,
one motor is coupled directly
to one axis of movement,
but CoreXY is a fancier way
of laying out your motors and belts
that gives a few performance improvements.
So in CoreXY,
the two motors both work together
to produce motion in just one axis.
So if we were to pull on just one belt,
which you can see it
actually moves diagonally,
but get this.
If we pull on both belts,
let's see if I can get in here.
There you go.
We can just move along the Y-axis.
As for the Z-axis, it's more traditional.
It rides on two rails
with a screw that's hidden behind
this stainless panel at the back
or, well it's supposed to.
Unfortunately, our best
guess is that the parts kit
that was stored inside the
printer during shipping
managed to crack one of the
bearing mounts in transit.
Replacing it would have required an almost
complete disassembly and
reassembly of the printer.
So, instead we pried back the sheet metal
and epoxied the ever-loving
bejesus out of it.
Since then it's held up fine
thanks to the auto bed leveling grid
but we do treat it gingerly
anyway, just to be safe.
Now, since the version
that we showed you in our earlier footage,
Cocoa Press has ditched
the refrigerated airstream
and instead uses a patent pending,
vapor compression refrigeration system
to keep the entire build chamber
at just the right temperature.
And when I say just the right temperature,
I mean exactly.
The difference between
chocolate flowing too quickly,
and it freezing inside
the nozzle causing a jam
is just a few tenths of a degree Celsius.
And the thermal problem that is thus,
if you overheat the chocolate
or heat it up too fast.
you ruin the temper
or the crystal structure
within the chocolate.
And that's really important
because maintaining that
is what gives chocolate
a nice surface finish and a crisp,
snap when it's broken.
Overheating can also cause
the cocoa fats to separate
and create bloom or pockets of fat
on the surface of the chocolate.
They're not harmful
but they're not exactly appetizing.
On the other hand,
if it's too cold, well,
it's not gonna flow, right?
And the same goes for the atmosphere
that it's being printed in.
Too hot, the chocolate won't solidify.
Too cold and it'll freeze
as it's coming out the end of the nozzle.
Now, after our first few test prints,
it was pretty clear
that something wasn't working as intended
and after solving the aforementioned
build platform issues,
we hit an even bigger snag.
The compressor for the
chamber refrigeration system
is not working as intended.
It caused temperature
spikes that turn our prints
into gooey messes,
like this one.
Can still taste good, but it
wasn't exactly the best way
for us to show off the
unit's capabilities.
So they hackily addressed it
with a custom firmware that
your working unit won't need.
And finally, we were off to the races,
or so we thought.
Chocolate printing is,
I can't mince words here,
really hard.
So Colin spent days fudging
the temperature up and down,
a 10th of a degree,
haha, pun intended by the way.
Then waiting half an hour
for those changes to propagate
to the rest of the chocolate
and then testing and retesting
and then we'd get a good print
and then everything would
go out the window again.
And the road was long and delicious,
but
very frustrating.
Both our milk and dark chocolate
proved to be unreliable
due to the handicapped
state of our Cocoa Press.
White chocolate, however, can
be printed at 18 to 20 degrees
and
actually turned out pretty well.
But I'll let the results
speak for themselves.
This is pretty impressive.
- [Cameraman] Yeah.
- There's still some errors.
- Little errors.
So this was done in vase mode.
So one of the problems we had
was the stepper driver for the Z-axis
was skipping or adding some steps
and you could see things got elongated.
So, by just having it
rise slowly in a spiral,
we kind of mitigated that
and you can see where there's feed issues,
where there's a pocket, the
chocolate wasn't homogeneous.
And we ended up with little failures,
but the rest the print went pretty good.
- Pretty good.
Even in milk chocolate,
as long as we didn't go too high.
- Yeah, as long as you stayed low.
- That's a very recognizable LTT logo.
That's freaking cool.
Although I do have to say Colin,
some of these I'm not convinced
that you ever 3D printed at all.
It looks like all you ever
did was turn a phallus
into another phallus.
- You're not wrong.
- It's not very transformative.
- Yeah, and so I have a
couple of samples here we can,
so these are texture samples.
These are actually literally just infill
from a 3D printing slicer.
You just, to have zero top layers
and you can generate infill for shapes.
- Oh, that's interesting.
And then you take one that's
more completely filled.
The taste is so much stronger
on the one with less air pockets,
even though to my monkey brain
my mouth is just full of
chocolate in both cases.
- And that's something you
can't get any other way, right?
You can create these inner structures
that have different feels
and you're adding a new
dimension to the chocolate,
to the food.
- The white chocolate in general, for me
which isn't chocolate, by the way,
white chocolate is a big scam.
White chocolate is not my favorite,
it's way too sweet for me.
But what I found was with
the really big air pockets
it's actually palatable.
- [Colin] It mellows out, yeah.
- I mean, I am more of a dark
chocolate boy these days.
- Those dick butts are dark chocolate
and they came out okay.
It was just a little difficult to extrude.
- Right, cause we can't get
the temperature low enough.
- Besides the frustration
it was really fun.
- It still did manage
some overhangs and stuff,
so this is just a matter of,
it needs to be working properly.
- Yeah, like look at the pillars,
you're printing in chocolate.
It's horrible.
But for what it is--
- [Cameraman] But we
had an issue with the--
- With that in mind,
come on.
It's a chocolate fricking boat.
- And now for the question
you've all been waiting for,
who makes tastier chips, Intel or AMD?
See that David?
They're Intel and AMD chips.
Mhmm.
Team blue, not bad.
Mhmm, team red.
I do like the taste of the core.
- [Cameraman] Hey, Linus.
Eat a dick butt.
It's surprisingly fast,
obviously it's nothing
like a filament printer.
- [Cameraman] Well, I think
the big thing to note is
the nozzles 0.8 millimeters
which is double the size of
what we have on the (murmurs).
So our layer height is
like half a millimeter,
so it prints really fast.
It's like each of the chips
I think is 11 minutes.
- It just makes you
salivate just watching it.
Now, as far as we know,
this is the first Coco Press
to make it out into the wild
and it's pretty clear that the team there
does have some challenges to solve,
particularly around shipping.
But aside from that
one, the build quality,
ease of use and the design
itself are freaking awesome.
I mean, it's a 3D printer in a fridge.
And while at the end of the day
we weren't able to get reliable
prints that were taller
than say, a centimeter.
The bones are all here
and they're really good.
The extruder, which is
by far the hardest part
is excellent and reliable.
And the motion system is beautiful
and works exactly as intended.
Now, at 10,000 US dollars,
it won't be making its way into
the average maker's home lab
anytime soon.
But once the wrinkles are ironed out
I could see cake makers
or other confectioners
making an absolutely killing.
We have custom toppers,
fancy chocolate bars
and that sort of thing.
Once the wrinkles are worked out
and they arrive in one piece.
Speaking of working out wrinkles
work out the wrinkles in your privacy
by adding a VPN that masks your IP
and encrypts traffic to
and from your device.
Private Internet Access
has reliable service
and no bandwidth caps.
And they offer configurable encryption
and an internet kill switch
to keep you in control of your connection.
When combined with private
browsing best practices
a VPN like PIA, can
even make websites think
that you're in a different country.
With PIA, you can connect
up to 10 devices at once
with clients for windows, Mac
iOS, Android, iOS, and Linux.
And they recently launched
a dedicated IP option
that has absolutely zero
connection to your account
or (murmurs)
Not even PIA knows that the
IP address belongs to you
and you just get a smoother experience
with the same privacy and
security that you're used to.
So try PIA risk-free.
They've got servers in over 77 countries
and there's a 30 day money back guarantee,
if for whatever reason,
you're not satisfied.
We're going to have them linked below.
Well, that's it.
That's all we've got
for you on this treat,
haha (murmurs) printer.

of makery kind of stuff,
get subscribed.
We're in the process of building
a tool changing 3D printer
in order to build an entirely
3D printed computer case
and you will not want to miss that.
