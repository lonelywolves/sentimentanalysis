are you tired of solar system sets that
aren't to scale
well me too so i did something about it
that's right we made stickers of the
planets with diameters that are too
scale there's mercury venus
earth mars jupiter
saturn uranus and neptune
if you're not just a planet freak and
you also like little specks of debris
we also included pluto and the moon
which orbits so far away from the earth
you could literally fit
every single planet and pluto in between
the two a fact
wonderfully celebrated by the included
poster
