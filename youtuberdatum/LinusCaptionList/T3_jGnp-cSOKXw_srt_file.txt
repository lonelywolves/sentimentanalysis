- Die.
(upbeat music)
Drop test.
We're gonna do a, can it toe?
Oh God.
Good luck everybody.
Normally reviewing a cable
is a hard pass for me,
but when I get an email that says,
"Hey, you wanna check out an
indestructible tactical cable?"
Well, now you got my attention, don't you?
I didn't think today was gonna
include any of this stuff,
and yet, it did.
Meet the EliteCore Athena ethernet cable,
a truly fascinating product.
There's one thing I did know today though,
that I would be telling our
viewers about our sponsor,
Raid Shadow Legends is a free to play
dark fantasy collection RPG
featuring lots to do and
champions to collect.
Check it out at the link below
and stay tuned for more info
coming later in this video.
(upbeat music)
This is your run of the mill
cat five or cat six network cable,
and this is EliteCore's
super cat tactical cable.
What in the world makes a cable tactical?
Is it for jacking into the main
frame during your covert ops
or using it while taking enemy fire?
I mean, is it even better than this?
There's only one way for us to find out,
my script just says vamp as you unbox.
So let's go ahead and
do this thing, shall we?
Wow, the quality of this
printing is terrible,
lifetime guarantee though unconditional.
You take great pride in your computer
and for good reason,
this is some A plus
marketing rank right here.
Every single inch of it
oozes powerful perfection,
yet we're willing to bet that
if you peeked around the back
it's still connected with
a flimsy ethernet cable.
Oh, for crying out loud,
essentially a string and tin cans.
That's what they,
they said this is essentially
a string and tin can.
Enter the Athena Elite
(man clears throat)
dripping with excellence, they say.
Built to not only handle
modern signal needs
but to last an eternity and
look good along the way.
Look at this lock-in connector.
Like one of the first things
to fail on any ethernet cable
is obviously that little clip
that keeps it into the socket.
One wrong look at this
thing and ping off at pops
you'll never see it again,
don't bother trying to
superglue it back on by the way
that doesn't work.
So EliteCore, this is
an interesting strategy.
So first they've got
this like cover around it
so it can't accidentally pop off,
and then they've got a built-in
button so you can press it.
Then they've got like a strain relief here
and the sleeving on this
thing is freaking ridiculous.
Oh, wow, look at that,
it's like gut memory, like sleeving.
Oh, well that's pretty
cool when you're doing
like an ethernet wall or
like a kind of trickier run.
How's your (indistinct)
(upbeat music)
Okay, not bad.
And it gets even more interesting,
this is called the
converter shell connector
and it accepts this kind of
like Baton looking thing.
So you can see the
whole ethernet connector
is now like recessed in this thing.
So in order to use this,
you're actually gonna have
to have special wall plates
that EliteCore makes that it plugs into
just like an XLR connector,
on like professional audio.
There you go.
You have to push this thing to release it.
So like, theoretically,
it's real hard to get out by accident.
Of course so far, we're just
taking EliteCore's word for it
that these things are
tough, you can run over it,
you can hang weights from
it, blah, blah, blah.
I wanna see for myself.
So for the next few minutes,
we are going to be
beating the absolute crap
out of this cable and
seeing if it still works.
And we get to look at
doing it, lttstore.com.
Oh, I mean, we could do a quick
does it come out on its
own by accident test.
(man groans)
Okay, well that didn't
come out on its own.
We're transferring, ladies and gentlemen.
You know what?
I'm gonna start with
something a little less heavy
(metal clanks)
how about just like this?
(chants in foreign language)
Sorry, I just watched the
"Lord of the Rings 4K".
We actually flattened it a little bit.
(metal clanks)
Of course, what we don't know
is if that would actually
break a regular cable.
(metal clanks)
Still transferring,
somehow I wouldn't really trust it though.
11, 12.
(metal clanks)
Oh, it's dead.
That's what a dead
ethernet cable looks like.
So let's give it another 20.
(metal clanks)
(upbeat music)
Okay, EliteCore, okay.
Can you tell how much
flatter it is on camera?
(man claps)
Next test,
regular ethernet cable
versus accidental scissors.
See you later.
Oh, it's dead.
Now, I'm hoping to actually
be able to break it here.
(classical music)
Gotta choke up,
make sure you get that
full snipping power.
Oh, did I get it?
I did get it.
All right, guess now we can
find out what he's made of.
First thing we've got is
this is 23 AWG cat six
so yes, rated for 10 gig,
but not over full distance
you need cat six eight for that.
Each of the individual
twisted pairs is shielded.
Well, that explains the
kind of like the memory.
- [Colin] Do you think it's just a shield?
- Yeah, it has to be because
there's nothing else in here.
Colin and I were discussing
whether we thought it was gonna
be stranded or solid core,
I can't tell yet, what's your final bet?
I'm gonna strip it back.
- [Colin] It's gotta be stranded to-
- For a patch cable?
- Take industrial use.
It's gonna be dragged and kinked
and in and a truck 100 times.
- I'm gonna say solid,
just to be contrarian.
I win, it's solid core-
- [Colin] No way.
- It's solid core.
Okay, well that would
explain some of the memory
as well then,
and probably what makes it
so that it doesn't break
is like I said, the fact that
it has such thick shielding
and then sheathing on it.
Just because one of our cables is dead,
doesn't mean our test is over.
We pretested this blue cable
and we've devised a
series of torture tests
we're gonna put it through
before going back in and testing it again,
starting with the classic,
can you run over it with a pickup truck?
My lovely assistant Colin, he'll assist.
(classical music)
Okay, you know what?
That's probably enough for that.
As expected, that did nothing at all.
Another classic, we're
gonna do a, can it tow?
Oh God, oh God, oh God.
I mean, it's doing it.
I don't know how high my
confidence level is right now.
Okay, Colin brake, Mathias brake.
Oh God.
Colin, wait a second there.
Hold on, I gotta play my favorite song.
(guitar plays)
Oh, this poor thing.
I don't think it lived.
The sleeving has suffered a little bit,
let's go test it now.
Wait, no, it still works.
You gotta be kidding me.
All right, let's go back and
kill it for real this time.
Soft wheels, that's easy,
but these are hard wheels.
This forklift weighs about 3000 pounds,
good luck everybody.
(vehicle beeps)
(orchestral music)
All right, thanks Mathias.
Oh man, that didn't even do anything,
it flattened it a little.
Die.
Drop test.
(upbeat music)
Test time, you ready?
Try again, try again.
Did we kill it?
Oh my God, we didn't.
We didn't, it works
Thought we got it that time.
Okay, then marketing about
the shame of connecting
your gaming rig with a flimsy cable
you found in a drawer somewhere,
clearly these are made
for a different purpose
than your run of the mill
router to PC connection,
when the result is like mission critical.
Like if you're setting up an audio system
for a touring musician,
or rapidly deploying
emergency infrastructure.
This is the kind of cable
that you spend the extra on
when you need to be able
to trust that it will work
even when it's abused, and
that is what tactical means.
According to what we've
seen in the real world,
this will stand the test of time
whether you're on a traveling show
that moves production to production,
or whether you just run
over cables with your chair
all the time or something like that.
But what is the cost?
I actually don't know
so this is the reveal.
(upbeat music)
Oh really?
$42 per cable.
You know what?
That's bad, but it's not that bad.
Like after working with pro grade cameras
and filming equipment and that
kind of stuff for so long,
it doesn't surprise me
whether it's an XLR cable
or like a weird proprietary
USB adapter for the A7
or this is a classic.
This is the cable that
goes between a red camera
and the monitor that
is proprietary to red.
- [Andy] We beak a lot of those.
- Excuse me.
- [Andy] We beak a lot of those
because the strain relief is not great.
- These are $150 a pop.
- [Andy] I know.
- Which is a lot of money.
Huh, actually I'm kind of
still processing that one,
but it's kind of the
cost of doing business
at a certain point.
And it will pay for itself
every time you have a completed production
that doesn't require a reshoot
or where the editor doesn't
find a popper hiss in the audio.
These wireless microphone
packs, for example
are $4,000 a pair.
I mean, you can get a wireless
lab kit for a 10th of that,
but it's not mission critical grade.
So that's why there's
this whole world out there
of connectors and industrial
cables that are designed
to far outperform what you would find
kicking around your house.
One of the big manufacturers
in the connector space
is Neutrik,
and they actually make
many of the connectors
that EliteCore uses in their products.
They're kind of the defacto standard
when it comes to rigging gear like this.
This is actually a Power
Bar that EliteCore makes
that is $167 for just four outlets.
But it's got this locking
connector and if you open it up,
I mean the cable management man,
it's like you could throw this
thing around back of a truck,
drive it across country
and you would still expect
it to freaking work.
Now that's not to say that the
performance of these cables
is any better, whether
it's the ethernet or power
or whatever else,
it's just basically tin cans and string
at the end of the day.
But when it comes to locking
retention mechanisms,
water tightness and durability,
well, that's where this kind
of stuff comes into play.
Just like you should
play Raid Shadow Legends,
the sponsor of today's video.
If you're looking for a
free game to play any time
with the phone in your pocket,
or the other phone in your pocket,
you can with Raid Shadow Legends.
They've got 500 champions to collect
each with their own skill tree
and millions of artifacts
to find and equip.
The game offers a large variety
of combinations and
strategies to figure out,
and so far we've been digging
the Sharp Shooter champion.
Wanna find the best weekly rewards?
Join a clan and fight the clan boss,
and the fastest way to
level up your champions
is through funding the campaign.
So you grind XP, you get loads of silver,
and a few artifacts at the same time.
And last month Raid released
their biggest ever update
with the centerpiece of
it being the doom tower,
a giant tower with 120 floors,
a bunch of secret challenge rooms
and 12 bosses to take on.
We know, Raid Shadow
Legends, kind of a meme,
sponsoring everyone and their dog,
but seriously, give it a try.
Raid is giving new players Bulwark,
a free void champion,
50 gems, an XP booster,
some energy refills and
even an ancient shard
as soon as they get in game.
So it's all for a limited time only,
so check it out at the link below.
(upbeat music) Well folks,
it's been cool to show you
just how high-end cables can go.
If you're interested in
checking out some more
ultra top end gear, maybe
consider our (beep) serious.
We just did a video on a
$15,000 network switch.
