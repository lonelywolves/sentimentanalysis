- I hate cable management so much.
(sound of a driller)
Oh dear wires, thick or thin,
you've been with me since the beginning.
I watched you grow from
kilobits to megabits
then finally into gigabits,
sweet sweet gigabits,
but the world is changing and
I feel it's time to admit,
I've been seeing someone else.
Logitech the sponsor of this video
wishes to remove my copper bindings
freeing me forever from tangled feet,
knocking over my drinks and..
Wait, who am I kidding?
I have always hated you wires.
I've just been too lazy to dump your ass.
That is until now (mumbles).
No, no, I actually do
still have to do this.
(upbeat music)
The first rule of cable
management is of course,
to clean everything up.
We've got about an hour until WAN Show.
So you're gonna see the
speed version of that.
We're gonna be unplugging
everything, moving stuff around.
So now is a great time to
declutter the workspace
and clean my desk and peripherals.
If I was a lazy boy, I
could just toss my keyboard
into the dishwasher, like we did.
You guys can go check that video out.
I don't think anyone's
gonna warranty your keyboard
after it's been through such an ordeal
but they all did work.
So, right.
Of course, though for me,
since part of the video is
the Logitech sponsorship.
I am actually going to be
replacing, not just my keyboard
but also my mouse pad
and even my headphones.
We're starting of course
with the G915 TKL.
I've been enamored with this one
ever since my unboxing
over on Short Circuit.
It uses Logitech Lightspeed technology.
That means that it performs
as well as a wired device
or better.
It uses their GL Switches
that are available
in two different configurations.
There's a clicky one and
there's a tactile one.
Personally, I prefer the
tactile one, just 'cause
I don't want anything to get
picked up in my microphone,
but both of them share the characteristics
that they're both fast and
accurate at half of the height
of normal key switches,
making the entire keyboard
as Logitech puts it impossibly thin.
There's perky RGB media
buttons, a scroll wheel
and it gets 40 hours of battery life.
And unlike my old keyboard,
look how much more space I'm gonna have.
I'm finally going 10 keyless.
I'm ready to give up my number
pad because quite honestly
I almost never do work at home anymore.
Now my mouse, I have not
actually intended to upgrade.
It's already a G Pro Wireless
but hey, the G Pro Wireless
Superlight is here and..
Actually hold on a second.
Does this feel like
there's anything in here?
- [David] Its superlight!
- Does it actually feel like
an empty box too though?
- [David] Yeah, its a real box.
- No, they told me it's in here.
They told me its in,
it's definitely in here.
Okay, wow.
Have you felt this thing yet?
- [David] Yeah I did
a Short Circuit on it.
- Oh really, It is super light.
It weighs in at just 63 grams,
which is roughly the weight
of two rechargeable AA batteries.
It has much larger Slippy pads compared
to the regular G Pro Wireless.
You get 70 hours on a single charge
and all it costs you is
giving up your RGB which,
I don't know man, G Pro
is already pretty light.
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna give it a try.
I guess I should sort of
explain what PowerPlay is
for the uninitiated.
If you get one of these little
wireless charging module
(mumbles) jigs from Logitech,
you pop that in your mouse.
It comes as a kit
and then you get one of
these PowerPlay mats.
It actually comes with either a cloth
or a hard surface that goes on top of it.
The idea is that your
mouse charges continuously
while you're using it.
And you never have to
remember to charge it
which is pretty flipping sick.
I came up with the brilliant idea
of putting a different
mouse pad over top of it.
Ah, I have revealed my secrets to you.
I've been using that
mouse pad for a long time.
It was time to change it though.
Oh, that actually lines up pretty nicely.
You know what?
I might go for the 30 mil
LTT Northern lights desk pad
for this.
- [David] Where'd you get it from?
- Lttstore.com.
One of my worst offenders though
isn't even the mouse and keyboard.
It's my HD600 headphones.
They come with this super crazy long wire.
Like it actually goes all the way
wrapping around the table
in the back and stuff.
And there's this much left
and I have never bothered to replace it
and I constantly get tangled on it.
And actually it gets stuck in my chair.
Super annoying.
Now I might end up still needing these
for monitoring my stream
because to my knowledge
there's no way to plug a USB
headphone into the GoXLR.
But at least for gaming
it would be nice to not
have to deal with them.
So that's where the Pro X
Wireless Headset comes in.
It uses Logitech, same
lightspeed wireless interface.
It's got 50 millimeter
drivers rated for 20 hours
of use at a time, 15 meters of range
which given that I will
never be going any further
than here for my desk
should be fine, just fine.
And perhaps most importantly for me,
they have completely redesigned the fit
compared to other
Logitech gaming headsets.
And it's like, man, these are
cushy and comfortable now.
And they've got blue voice mic filters
so you can reduce noise, add compression
cool stuff like that.
That's new since Logitech's acquisition
of blue a little while back.
Of course you might've
noticed in all of this
that my desk has not gotten
significantly tidier.
The cold hard truth is that
there are still a lot of things
that just can't go without cables.
You got your monitor, you
got your streaming gear,
you got your audio gear, thunderbolt.
So what about those wires?
Time to manage them in one hour.
All right, let's go.
My biggest worry is not that in my hurry
I will do a bad job, but in my
hurry, I will make horrible,
horrible mistakes 'cause I
am planning to go, you know,
one step above, like I wanna
drill holes on the table
and run like my PowerPlay
cable into the table
and then under the table.
If I put it in the wrong
spot then the ergonomics
of this desk are gonna be bad forever.
When's the last time I even used speakers
but then I rest my feet on my subwoofer.
Really get rid of them?
- [David] Yeah, it sucks.
- This thing has served me so
well for so many years though.
I'm getting sentimental about a subwoofer.
Do you know how much
comfort my feet have gotten
from sitting on this?
I'm just noticing that
there are one, two, three,
power cables down here that
are not plugged into anything.
What is this?
I never ran the display port
cable that my wife needs
for her station
back to the server room
from the back of this.
So I just have like a rando
long display port running here.
Shit, I hate cable management so much.
Why am I even doing this?
Oh, I'm gonna be so dirty.
There's blown cellulose everywhere David.
It's everywhere.
It's the first time I
had to go out into it.
Look how they massacred my boy.
Look at that.
We finally got the plate on the wall.
The way it's supposed to
be, like it's supposed to.
Wait, I knocked over all
my cable management stuff.
I should just call this video Linus
falling apart for 15 minutes.
Should I just start
drilling holes in the desk?
- [David] Yeah, drill away!
- No time like the present, right?
- [David] Yup.
(sound of a driller)
- Fortunately, this is a
crappy particle board table
- [David] Nice.
- That worked out.
Okay.
Sweet.
Now I just got to do
that a bunch more times.
Let's get the monitor back on the desk.
'Cause I can't even like..
I can't even visualize
where everything needs to go
until I got the monitor.
Let's go another hole right there
and we'll run everything through that.
(sound of a driller)
I actually cannot believe
that I am drilling holes in my desk.
How does this track work?
What do you do with all the bricks?
(chuckles)
(mumbles)
So we'll do like that length.
This is a dull saw,
and that's how the dinosaurs died out.
All their backs broke.
The point of these is the
cables can kind of enter
and exit anywhere you want at
these little like (mumbles).
This stuff honestly seems pretty useful.
Just kinda taking some of my cables
and stuffing them up in here.
One of the little life
hacks that I've tried
to use a number of times over the years,
but not with much success
is hot gluing power bricks
to the bottom side of your table.
I've found that,
even if you use like the
industrial strength hot glue
it just doesn't hold.
So having some kind of like
(mumbles) or bracket or something
on the bottom of the table
and then cable tying
the power brick to it.
That's the only way that I've had success.
Ah, this cable tie ripped.
Should've got it from lttstore.com.
Just dropped a power brick on the face.
There we go, okay.
That is strapped nice and tight.
No.
- [David] What did you do?
- Oh, I started drilling
and that's right where my stupid power bar
that I just locked in place is
I think only one way to find out.
- [David] Oh no, don't do that!
(sound of a driller)
- Shit!
Think I hit it.
Oh, I drilled into it a bit.
This is fine, because I have
a slightly larger spade bit.
- [David] Great.
- The problem is that when
you've already drilled a hole
with a different spade bit
using another spade bit
to enlarge it, not a great experience.
Oh wow, I just..
I can't hold it steady.
Okay, you know what?
Am I better off going from
the bottom or from the top?
From the bottom there's
gonna be like an exit wound
but from the top, this thing
could walk all over the place.
Okay, I'm going top
down, I'm going top down.
Here we go.
(sound of a driller)
Okay, maybe I could--
- [David] Oooh, watch your fingers.
(sound of a driller)
- Okay.
(sound of a driller)
What did i just hit?
Okay, well it clears it?
We're calling that good for
the mount for my USB hub
and I get to put all of
my wireless accessory,
dongles in it.
What am I rolling over?
You know what, It doesn't matter.
Now where do I want it the GoXLR.
'Cause I'm about to drill
a big old hole here.
(sound of a driller)
Oh.
Metal.
Shit!
Oh no, oh it's so close.
We're going in at an angle.
(sound of a driller)
Oh, I thought I cracked the display.
Oh
- [David] Stop it!
- I thought I had a grip on it.
- [David] Oh.
- No, wow.
The display was stronger than the plastic
from the drill came off.
Okay, please tell me it's not cracked.
I won't be able to tell them
till I actually have an image.
(David laughing)
This thick boy XLR cable, here we go.
Oh, it's so tight.
Where's my drill, I'm widening it.
We're going wider.
Ouch.
Okay.
Come on.
(laughing)
I think that's funny, do you little one.
This is what madness looks like.
All the cable management, all
the cable management (mumbles)
I mean, it feels crazy to
say it but are we there?
Can you see any of these
cables from the back there?
- [David] From here no.
- Hey, well that is the goal.
Isn't it?
No offense Dyson, but this is
a job for a real man's vacuum
with leopard print.
Now we find out if I
cracked my monitor panel
or at least we should.
I never actually turned
the computer off, did I?
Oh, I did.
Oh, okay, I thought it was
supposed to be working right now.
This is working now.
- [David] Hey.
- Hey.
This thing is really light.
Wow.
Holy crap.
That is crazy.
Okay.
Man, It's almost like unnerving.
Hold on, I haven't tried these yet.
Are these just gonna like
straight up work for me here?
How cool would that be?
Pro X Wireless Gaming Headset.
Just flipping works.
Man, wireless technology has
come a long freaking way.
All right, discord.
It involved drilling
many holes in my desk.
'Cause like some things..
Yeah some things need wire's look.
Some things need wires, even wireless.
It's all a lie because
it has to charge somehow.
Okay good you got my webcam feed now.
All right, sick.
Let's do WAN Show real
quick styles here, shall we?
Okay, but first, big thank
you to you guys for watching.
Big thank you to Logitech
for sponsoring this video.
I think that the before and after
kind of tells the whole story here
that looks so much better.
It needs a little bit vacuuming
but I think you guys get the point.
I'm gonna do that.
We're gonna get WAN Show started
and you guys can check out the links
to where to get all of this
good Logitech wireless goodness
down in the video description.
Oh yeah.
If you didn't get it for Christmas
Now's the time.
I need water, lttstore.com.
