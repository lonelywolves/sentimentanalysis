"Girl!!! I work for ADT, as a bilingual customer service rep. And it has not been easy since COVID. If you hate the hold time. Imagine how it is for us, we are back to back NONSTOP. And get frustrated customers back to back, pissed because of the hold time. and just cussing you out the minute we answer. When all we actually want to do , is help. Trust me, we don&#39;t have the customers on hold on purpose. We have no way off stopping the calls, or having the calls on on hold. We have 500+ calls holding 24/7 now... And I&#39;m in the bilingual team, so for me , we get English and Spanish pissed off customers. Getting cussed TF out in both languages lol... If you only knew, how bad it has been. Stressful, mentally exhausting. And they are a 24 hours call center. And none of us, have a normal schedule. And to be honest, they are horrible with their employees... But getting heated customers on a Sunday, cussing you the TF out,  is not fun. the whole day. i can go on and on. Even hearing the back ground music on the vlog gave me nightmares lol.<br />Anyways, i just wanted to tell you guys how it is for us. So maybe, you guys can understand a little better the situation... If you have ADT, please bare with us. We are trying... trust me.

Lol omg I seen ur man painting and I just heard my dad yelling&quot; long strokes what are doing jasmine give me that &quot;.. he been doing it 30 years but pro tip if you want  it done faster soke the roll and long strokes up and down you will only need one cut round the borders and 1 coat save money and time .. love your video by the way and. Bless your family,Jasmine Carrion,2020-10-31T17:58:31Z,12

@MsPachecoSpeaks Super quick from WHO? The guy she was shortly dating from Canada? 😂 You can be in a relationship for 8 years and not be married or have a child. One day you meet a guy who you can&#39;t incision yourself w.o and wants to build a family with you. When the timing is right things eventually happen.,mOni ka,2020-11-01T02:03:44Z,27
