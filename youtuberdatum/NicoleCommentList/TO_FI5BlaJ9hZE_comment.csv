"Thank you so much for this video I’ve been wanting to hop in a tanning bed but I know how harmful it is for your skin so I’ve avoided it. Ive recently tried ‘Beauty by earth’ self tanner it works pretty well and almost all the ingredients are organic, which I like. I just bought vita liberata and I think I might try it on top of the ‘beauty by earth’ tanner. I also bought the sol de Janeiro, expensive but amazing!! Also mine came with a pump! I know u mentioned yours didn’t but maybe u could call the company to get a pump cap for it?? Or a new one?? I just bought mine from Sephora.",Carrisa Amado,2019-05-03T13:14:28Z,0

I got my Body Lava in brown sugar last week before i went on vacation and I love it. I didn&#39;t experience any transfer or stickiness with it and i applied it with my hands. I think a little bit goes a long way cuz i would literally use half a pump per section and then blend it out and rub it in with my hands. I wasn&#39;t sure i was gonna love the product based on the mixed reviews but i LOOOOOVE it honestly. I wore it everyday of my vacation,Ooh Gabby Giggles,2019-04-17T22:56:25Z,0
