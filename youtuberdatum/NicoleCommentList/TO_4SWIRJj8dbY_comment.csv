"Not to be rude Nicole, but you&#39;re way too flaky!  You are hit and miss.  You say imma do vlogs cuz that&#39;s what ALL your fans ask for,  yet no follow through.  You say imma do those full face colors of the rainbow, which you did a couple but again no follow through. You say imma do top ten Tuesdays, yet again did a couple but no follow through.... I&#39;m confused....you have a fan base who want to obviously watch your videos, and make it very clear what content they would like to see,  you say you hear your fans and state you are going to do these but then disappoint by not following through.  YouTube is your nitch, and a nice gig, and you do have a loyal fan base.  This is not hate, it is just a piece of advice and being honest.  BOTTOM LINE, to keep your success, you need to listen to your fans.  Just like any other celebrity,  you possess the talent but your fans are why you have been able to keep doing this.",Howard,2019-05-14T10:37:48Z,2
