Thank you for this! I was about to purchase this camera but saw in videos how close it was to the vloggers face so I was about to start looking elsewhere. But all the attachments you recommended turned this into my dream camera!,Heyitsrubee,2021-04-17T16:42:02Z,0

"I really want a vlogging camera along with a camera I can use to take photos (random things) like nights out with my husband or when our baby arrives. I’m no pro by any means. I just know my iPhone XR camera SUCKS. I haven’t started my YouTube channel yet, but will in the future which is why I want to get this one. Would you recommend this camera for having it for both?",Dava Andrade,2021-04-05T19:54:32Z,0

I’ve been watching your videos for at least 9 years. 😻 I am using the same camera to vlog and I feel obligated to tell you to turn ON the stabilization! 😅 I have ruined so many vlogs before I realized that when the Product showcase is On the stabilization automatically turns off. 😿 Just keep it in mind, it looks so much better when you’re not using a tripod. <br />Love, <br />Valerie",Valerie Yordanova,2021-02-27T08:42:33Z,5

"When things were at their very worst:<br />2 Suns, Cross in the sky, 2 comets will collide = don`t be afraid – repent, accept Lord`s Hand of Mercy.<br />The first sign - the Earth will spin faster.<br />The second sign concerns the sun, which will loom larger, brighter and begin to spin.<br />Scientists will say it was a global illusion. <br />Beaware – Jesus will never walk in flesh again.<br />After WW3 – rise of the “ man of peace“ from the East = Antichrist – the most powerful, popular, charismatic and influential leader of all time.
