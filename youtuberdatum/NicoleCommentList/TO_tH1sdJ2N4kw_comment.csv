I used to get strep throat a lot growing up. I find that if you buy the aloe plant and take the gooey stuff out and blend it with OJ and drink it 2-3x a day it cuts the recovery time in half. Also there&#39;s a supplement call Protandim that  I hear is great.,Vanessa Lynn,2019-05-22T17:01:23Z,0

"I’m the SAME when it comes to StrepThroat. When I was a kid, I got it all the time &amp; should’ve got my tonsils taken out. However, doctors at that time decided to stop doing that. They eventually went back to taking them out, once I stopped getting strep for a long period of time. NOW that I’m in my 30s, I’ve started getting StrepThroat again. I’ll probably end up getting these tonsils out. Also, just so you know, a lot of people that have issues with their tonsils as an adult, never had their tonsils SHRINK LIKE THEY SHOULD &amp; still have “enlarged” tonsils, that makes them more susceptible to infection.",Jenna June,2019-04-23T05:57:04Z,0

"For the sickness, you need to build up the immune system like you said. Start pumping yourself with elderberry. Take the Viracid (I think I spelled that correctly) (it’s in a white bottle with purple top) it had elderberry and lots of other vitamins that are keys to fighting off sickness. You should take two a day but it’s okay if you just take one. The pill is dark. It kind of resembles a charcoal pill of something. But just take that constantly and it will help a lot. With just that it will make a difference. I work at a doctors office and has help me and my co workers so much from getting sick since all kinds of stuff comes through the doors. I’m not a doctor at any means but just know personally it works",BeautyBy ACB,2019-04-19T13:58:55Z,0

Got my tonsils out &amp; almost died! Lost 4 litters of blood or something like that. 4 something of blood haha. The doctor stitched it up (I gues they aren&#39;t supposed to do that anymore) &amp; they opened up. My bathroom look like a murder scene .<br />Its was so scary. Now I get nervous when people say they&#39;re getting them out. I seriously felt like I had ptsd from it. The surgeon that helped me after they opened was pissed off that the original guy stitched instead of burned it closed.,Saenz Dana,2019-04-18T05:16:53Z,0

I mean it does suck cuz you can’t eat (I lost 10lbs) and rn I’m experiencing a loss of taste on my taste buds (that’s normal and it’ll come back) but other than that getting my tonsils out were not even bad!!

My daughter got her tonsils out at 5 years old cuz she was always sick and I still feel like she’s still getting sick often. That can just be due to her being in school and kids can be gross with touching things and each other. I’m actually taking her to the doctor today cuz she got strep throat for the second time 🤦🏻‍♀️  Glad ur feeling better tho ❤️,Jessica Santana,2019-04-16T17:53:56Z,0

"I have to get my tonsils out in the next couple years and I&#39;m 37. Not looking forward to it. My husband found a doctor in either Florida or California that does a technique that heals faster (I can find out if you want to know). It&#39;s not laser (I&#39;m not a candidate for that). I&#39;ll have to travel from Canada to do it but it&#39;s worth it. No doctor will touch me right now since I have Chronic Lyme disease, co-infections and Mast Cell Activation (which causes me to go anaphylactic at any time - so you can imagine why they won&#39;t operate.). It&#39;s part of my Lyme protocol though to get them removed though since I&#39;ve had so much strep and I have tonsil stones now. FML...",MokaTutu,2019-04-16T16:53:19Z,0

"Getting a tonsillectomy was the best decision I’ve ever made. The docs say wait til you get strep 3x in a row, but get it once, get a referral to an ENT, and have them confirm whether you need tonsils or not. I never get sore throats anymore it’s a GODSEND",Mariel,2019-04-16T16:14:13Z,0

"If you&#39;re fair or you think the color corrector is too orange for you.... Mix a tiny bit of that cc and concealer together to make a lighter peachy orange (to your preference) apply that, wait for it to dry and than go over with the concealer with tapping motion. If your trouble area is not that bad you can even use just the mixture of 7/8 of concealer with a 1/8 of color corrector.",Jovana Kocić,2019-04-16T06:37:54Z,0
"Oof, I don&#39;t recommend getting your tonsils removed if you can absolutely avoid it. The older you get (past childhood) the longer the recovery time is. I was 19 when I got mine removed and it was THREE weeks before I could stop taking pain meds and eat something other than jello and otter pops and it messes with your appetite and you&#39;ll probably gain back double the weight you lose during recovery and it won&#39;t budge for a long time. At one point I actually 100% thought I was going to die because I was starving from not eating for weeks. But if you do, DO NOT I repeat DO NOT EAT ICE CREAM!!

For the root cover up! I spray it and found it used to get on my nails and fingers if i touched my hair regardless so I set it with a light hold hair spray and not only does that tame any fly aways but its holds the root spray and helps it not transfer on my hats or fingers if i touch my hair. Its a great trick so thought id share!,Milea Osornio,2019-04-16T04:28:07Z,0

DO NOT GET YOUR TONSILS OUT! getting them out when you&#39;re older is hell. I got mine out when I was 18 and I couldnt talk for almost 3 weeks it is absolute hell. And you have to relearn how to swallow everything. It is so much worse the older you get,Sam,2019-04-16T02:03:43Z,0

Why don’t you go in depth about your teeth on YouTube? You post pictures on Instagram about your teeth yet you don’t talk about it. I feel that you guys get to a certain status and don’t post any more YouTube videos on your life.

So my daughter was getting sick all the time. We had her tested for immune Deficiency which she does have. If you get sick and dont seem to get better or meds dont work until you get really bad you should check into it. She doesnt have an immune system come to find out and has to get infusions weekly to boost her levels. Just a thought.,Alison Edelman,2019-04-16T01:31:59Z,1
Celery juicing in the morning on an empty stomach has healed my chronic strep and lightened my under eyes. I have been doing it for 6 months and I&#39;m pretty impressed with the results of doing something so simple that helps with my makeup application.

"There’s so many great new products that my girls and I are wanting to get😍!! We were so happy when we found a site that sold gently used or unwanted makeup because we thought we could finally afford to try “non drugstore” makeup, but we just got our pkg today and it was sooo disappointing 😓. Foundation was expired, Palette was demolished, and the other item was a almost empty mini sized🥴🙈.....Does anyone else know of other reputable sites or anything that sell higher end Makeup on a Clearance type budget? With 4 girls wearing different shades of foundation in my house it’s got to be affordable, but we really want to try some higher end foundations and stuff.☺️🥰😘<br />Love Your Videos Nicole!! 😘😘😘",Crystal Fuentes,2019-04-16T01:15:52Z,1
