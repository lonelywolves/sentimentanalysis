How long did your nails last you? Are you still doing your own?,Monique Kotsiopoulos,2020-10-20T02:26:14Z,0
Next time keep your left hand/drill still and move your right hand/nail around the bit when your doing your nondominant hand💜😽. It&#39;ll make things so much easier until you get the hang of it. Once you practice a bit it&#39;ll get easier. I hope you get to see this! Been watching you for yrs and your the reason I fell in love with makeup!!,Andrea Botelho,2020-08-06T05:52:17Z,0
"I love the Aimeil gel brand! I’ve never had any issues with any of their colors. I actually prefer their top and base coat over the Gelish ones. I just wish their bottles were bigger because I go through the top and base coat quickly. <br /><br />Also, don’t feel bad that it takes you so long. I think it takes me 2-3 hours and I’ve been doing my own nails for years. I feel like my prep work and removing old polish takes the most amount of time. I don’t understand how professionals do it all under an hour or two.",Vee A,2020-07-05T20:15:39Z,0

"Hey girl, I have a tip that may help w/ the filing of your nails and using the machine. One thing that helped me while using my non-dominant hand is I did not move that hand at all.

Slow down the speed when you use your non dominant hand, the aimeli gel is so good I have the base and top coat from them and the top coat don&#39;t leaves any sticky residue behind and it stays shiny for weeks.

"After filing your nail, instead of wrapping them in foil; grab a ziplock bag, place a cotton pad at the bottom and pour your acetone into the bag. I pour enough to cover my nails. Then place the bag into a bowl of really warm (almost hot) water. Soak your fingers in the acetone and rub the pad on your nails.

How long does your gel usually last without chipping? Mine are so brittle from continuous gel use and I wonder if putting on the nail strengthener before lessens the duration of the gel not chipping?!,Nihan Akhtar,2020-04-10T04:37:38Z,0

"I started doing my own dip powder nails at home a few months ago; I highly recommend soaking off gel/dip powder with ONYX Soak Off (it’s a blue liquid that you can find at Walmart). It took me hours to remove my dip with acetone. This stuff takes it off in about 10 min. What also helps with a faster removal is heat. You can either put a heating pad over your fingertips after you’ve put foils on or you can put hot water (as hot as is comfortable for you) in a bowl and pour some ONYX in a sandwich bag with a cotton pad, place your fingers in the bag, and then the bag with your fingers still in it, into the bowl of water. Rub your nails on the cotton pad. There’s YT videos of this method. If I can find the video where I saw it, I’ll link it.",damaris1128,2020-04-10T04:13:16Z,5

Hey Nicole. I&#39;ve been doing my own nails at home for the past three years. When using your left to your right slow down the speed and change the direction the bit is routing in.  There should be a forward/backward option on the efile.  Then you wouldn&#39;t have that skid situation happening at the tip of the nails. Got all my info from nailcareereducation. She is awesome. Good luck. 👍,April Barrios,2020-04-09T23:59:46Z,63

"now that you have your fragile natural nails, keep in mind to not use them for ANYTHINGGGGk! Don&#39;t open a can; don&#39;t peel a sticker or tape off; don&#39;t pry open a box; find something else to use instead. Every time you put pressure on the nail it&#39;s going to weaken it a teensy bit more until it breaks. From experience, I used to grow my nails hella long and they would always break or chip at a certain length until I stopped using them for anythingk",Shay,2020-04-09T22:55:54Z,0
