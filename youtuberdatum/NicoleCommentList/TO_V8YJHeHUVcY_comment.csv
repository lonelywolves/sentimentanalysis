I laid in bed in a heap of brokenness and I turned on your videos. You made me forget the pain for a while until I drifted off to sleep. I’ve been with you since day 1, and I’ll stay with you as long as you’re on YouTube. Thank you for being YOU, and making me feel like we’re friends even though we’ve never talked or met.  I love and appreciate you more than you’ll ever know. ♥️",Erin McGoldrick,2019-02-26T10:03:29Z,1

The bare minerals pro powder is my ish!! I was on the hunt for yearsssss for a full coverage powder and bare minerals is my holy grail now. I have it in 3 shades so it&#39;ll always match me no matter what time of year. It&#39;s great if u want a nice coverage but don&#39;t want a full face of liquid foundation. I use it everyday for work and it&#39;s super lightweight. I just set it with a translucent powder so I don&#39;t get too oily.  <br />Missing your vlogs. ☺️,Just Megan,2019-02-25T03:25:00Z,0

I tried to not talk to anybody when I had a lisp because of my teeth. Lol I was so embarrassed I would never have went on camera. You’re brave and i have loved you for years. I can’t thank you enough for being open and real and always yourself with us and sharing private parts of your life with us. It’s why you’re one of my most favorite youtubers ever.
