We‚Äôre literally the same person! My love for my three cats is intense and I also love feeding birds and squirrels. There‚Äôs a park in my town that I go to every weekend and I feed the chickadees sunflower seeds and I feed the squirrels walnuts. They are so tame the birds will land in your hand and the squirrels will run up to you and take the nuts from your hand. I also joke that I‚Äôm Snow White!

As long as you abrase the top coat first the foil technique will work in 10-15 minutes. Soak tiny pieces of cotton pad in 100% acetone then apply to nails and wrap in foil. Check after 10 minutes and use a cuticle pusher to gently scrape away the gel polish. You may need to reapply for another 10 minutes but gel polish should definitely not take any longer cx,Michelle Harrison,2020-05-18T10:39:24Z,0
