I&#39;m so sorry that happened to you with your hair situation girl ! As a hairstylist one of the things they tell you is that bleach(aka lightener) is not suppose to sit on your hair for longer then a half hour because it will fry your hair. I can&#39;t believe the person that did your hair didn&#39;t know that. And your extensions look so good !,gabby bove,2019-12-02T02:09:24Z,0

"She’s literally the only non black YouTuber that has acknowledged that hand tied hair extensions are sew ins , which were invited black hairdressers. Most of these ppl make it seem like hand tied is some new thing, lol. Bedsides, why don’t they just call it sew ins anyways?! Maybe it’s too “ethic” sounding.... Once again something made popular by people of color gets renamed and made famous by someone else. I legit saw video of a white stylist explaining her hand tied method acting like she invented it! Big butts, big lips were considered hideous on black ppl back in the day now ppl pay to get these features. Weaves were looked down upon now they’re the greatest thing.

How is your hair so smooth!?!  if i let mine air dry it gets super frizzy and fly-a-ways ALL OVER! I have to blow dry it for it even to be okay looking- i used the CHI oil but frizzy hair but nothing really works =/ and I feel as if white dry shampoo strings to it and leaves specks so makes it look like I have dandruff!

"LOVE your hair like this! Working on getting mine this long again. Biggest mistake I EVER made was cutting my hair...it came down mid- thigh... I could sit on it and often did sometimes on accident, lol. But I got a wild hair up my ass and wanted a perm, the girl messed it completely up and it looked awful!! Told her I wanted long layers all throughout it...she gave me one chin length layer all the way around...it looked like a bob. Then the next layer, which ended up just below my shoulders. NEVER will I do that again! Not even going to talk about that shitty ass perm she gave me! 😤 Lesson learned, lesson learned. So I&#39;m growing it back out and want one last cut, just an a line cut, no stacking. Had no idea your hair had been chemically damaged though. You concealed it so VERY well!!!
