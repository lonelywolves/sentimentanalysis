Some of the signs they had told us to look for was discoloring of the gums, panting, drooling, coughing and lack of play/lethargy.  Maybe mention this to the vet the next time you take Juice in to get an xray done to rule that out.  My baby had a heart attack and we lost him.",Emma Crowell,2019-06-28T04:16:46Z,0

Stomatitis is probably what your cat has... it’s a common problem with cats... auto immune disorder the body basically attacking itself causing the inflammation and infection along the gum lines... sometimes can be managed with antibiotics and steroids but other times the teeth have to be extracted to reduce body’s reaction to the teeth but I’ve seen several cases where all teeth have been removed and they do fine. Even eating is not a problem with not teeth.. I promise ❤️❤️,Janice Rohlfing,2019-06-27T01:59:55Z,0

"I hate the way youtube has changed everything. I remember back in the day when anyone could post a video and play music swear if they want to and just LIVE. Now theres so many restrictions and rules and its really sucking the life out of what youtube was. Its turning into reality tv where it feels restricted and scripted. And people would watch youtube because it was like getting to know someone through a screen. TV never felt like that, youtube WAS the only thing like that. And now its become controlled and its sad what money does and to see a space so authentic turn into TV...",Anonymous,2019-06-26T23:56:33Z,1

Nicole can you please help me and give me some advice. I am a 22 year old girl going to nursing school and literally have no passion for it . Which breaks my heart. My mom pulled strings to get me in and my family is so proud . But yet I feel so sad and like I’m living a lie . I have no passion for nursing at all . It’s not my dream and I feel like I’m trapped and have no where to go . Please help me,Mercedes 10,2019-06-26T15:59:43Z,0

Hi Nicole I have a question and I thought to ask you bc your such a great makeup artist and I figured you know the answer to this: WHY DOES MY HIGHLIGHTER ALWAYS LOOK LIKE A BRUISE ON MY FACE?,Darcey,2019-06-26T00:17:22Z,1
"@MakeUp Angel23 that&#39;s a good idea, I will try that 👍🏻",Darcey,2019-06-26T00:56:31Z,0
Also try applying with a sponge makes it look more natural:),MakeUp Angel23,2019-06-26T00:47:21Z,1
"Are you packing it on too much? Light hand and light sweeps work for me! Also try Becca opal, if you have a fair skin tone it should good look on you!",Dianira Medrano,2019-06-26T00:24:41Z,1
"@MakeUp Angel23 I thought so too but it kinda doesn&#39;t matter which one I wear, I just used the new cookie shade from benefit ( I have a light skin tone)  and my brother was like, OMG you have a bruise on your face! maybe it was the blush???",Darcey,2019-06-26T00:20:34Z,1
