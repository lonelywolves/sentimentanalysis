Does anyone know where the headband is from?,Lanciaaaa,2020-09-30T10:14:44Z,0
Would you considered doing a video tag for healthcare workers? For months I gave up makeup because of having to wear PPE at work. I&#39;m an ICU Nurse and work 12 hour shifts. I live in Florida and have oily eyelids. My holy grails are Dior&#39;s waterproof mascara and Colourpop&#39;s s Sweet talk palette. I&#39;ve been pretty uninspired until recently when I cleaned out my makeup.  I also started relaxing again.. by watching makeup tutorials. I pretty much accept my face makeup is going to wear off because of wearing masks....but what about eyes? I&#39;d like to see products and  techniques that last. (or atleast fade nicely.) I love Goth and Rockchick looks but don&#39;t want makeup all over my face by the end shift. I think a lot of people would love this topic. I love the looks you come up with. Just trying to find new ways to take back my pre epidemic enjoyment..Thanks Mikki ♡,Mikki Briteside,2020-07-01T08:45:32Z,0

"Hey Nicole, I hope this is ok to leave on your channel.

She loves makeup because its one of the few constricting things she can do in a wheelchair.

I can’t wait to try chameleon cold brew because of you! I bought the one mixed with oat milk and it’s not that great. So I want to try the regular vanilla one you drink 😉,Brittany Bee,2020-03-31T00:12:48Z,20

I have the one mixed with oat milk and it’s so thick. So I want to try the one she does with a lot of cream,Brittany Bee,2020-04-01T15:30:41Z,0
i did too and its strong af gets me really energetic lol,Lizet Presley,2020-04-01T08:02:36Z,0
@Marcela A  It&#39;s gross on its own but not if you mix it with vanilla creamer. It&#39;s very strong and not a lot of people can handle the taste just on it&#39;s own. But I do it how Nicole does. I mix it with almond vanilla creamer and it&#39;s delicious!,tori wilson,2020-03-31T17:56:06Z,2
