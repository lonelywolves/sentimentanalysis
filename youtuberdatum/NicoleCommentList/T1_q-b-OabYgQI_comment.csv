You should try and tie dye a black shirt.  Like bleach tie dye it. Do bleach mixed with a color dye on a black shirt.  That could work right?!

When she said separately did she mean separately from other clothes that aren’t tie dye/same color tie dye or did she mean the hoodie separately from the pants.  <br />.<br />I want to do the shirt and short set and I was going to put the shorts in with the shirt (cause I’m doing one color) but now I’m nervous cause she said separately like it’s an important instruction lol 😅,Moriah Monea,2020-04-07T19:22:49Z,0

"I ordered the individual colors of Tumble Dye I wanted from Amazon - it ranges from $5-$8!!! and free shipping if you have prime. It’s super easy to use, I didn’t even use gloves. Low key it’s idiot proof. They come in spray bottles, that you shake and it’s ready to go. Once you heat dry and then wash you would never know. I just spray the color really close and far away depending how dark I wanted it. Also used a spray bottle of water to make the color disperse.",Rachel Anderson,2020-04-07T18:36:52Z,2

You on the other hand show what every typical girl is really like at home.. and you still look good!! 🤩",Sonia J,2020-04-07T18:32:07Z,188
Ur weird for thinking this... some people actually like to be stylish for themselves not just “for the camera” her style is simpler but that doesn’t mean everyone else is trying to hard they r just wearing what they want. What happened to girls supporting girls? Let’s not compliment someone at the expense of others. A simple “I like your style it’s so comfortable” would have been the normal way to compliment someone this is just backhanded,Alisha Adams,2020-08-29T00:48:52Z,1
