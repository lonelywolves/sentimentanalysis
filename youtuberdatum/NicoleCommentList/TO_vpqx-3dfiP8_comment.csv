"No issues about the silent video, but can you please try to do more natural “less is more” type of looks. I’ve been watching for years and absolutely love you, but some of us favor a more natural look. When I say natural I don’t mean a ton of makeup masked by nude shades as a ton of you tubers deem as a “natural” makeup look. The real trick is finding practicality regarding time and style for the professional woman that doesn’t have 2 hours in the morning or simply cannot wear bold or outlandish makeup. I just wanted to throw that out there because more than teenage girls watch the  channel and there should be a variety that caters to all audience types. Absolutely love your channel tho!!",Jamie Fontanez,2019-12-23T03:24:33Z,0

Just putting this out there I don’t want anyone to think I am being negative because I am not. <br />It looks like you struggled to blend the shadow. I am interested in purchasing but I am still iffy. Can you give me some feedback. Or anyone who has this pallet already can give feedback back as well. It will be greatly appreciated. <br />I love how the look turned out. I can’t believe I have been watching you for a while. The first video I saw I was in high school and I wanted to die my hair red. So I went to YouTube and I put how to die your hair red and I came across your video.,Rosa Isela,2019-12-22T17:35:40Z,8
"I think she was just being precise, but I do see what you mean. I have 3 other colorpop palettes and they are soft shadows and pigmented for the price range. I don’t own this specific palette but I think I would give it a try.",Ashley L,2019-12-22T23:20:37Z,0
Yachy Ivy yes!  I went to Sally’s and bought the stuff she said to get and it came out great.,Rosa Isela,2019-12-22T22:36:46Z,0

Ok why don’t more people do no talking makeup tutorials. I actually could concentrate on what you were doing . I don’t know but when I’m doing my makeup I’m constantly thinking to myself so watching you and not having to concentrate on what you were saying at the same time was relaxing .  Just me?  Still love every video you put out but this was a nice change 🥰❤️,T Kaila,2019-12-22T17:10:44Z,235
