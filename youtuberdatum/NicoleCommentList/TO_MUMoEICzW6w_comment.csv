"That&#39;s some really great advice....putting pics on floor, cut out pics, etc. Also, I  personally love seeing your kitties in your vids!!  I love people who love their pets!  Love !",Black Panther,2019-10-19T09:25:59Z,0
"I absolutely love the new furniture if anything i can’t wait for you to get rid of that popsicle light and the wigs hanging over everything. It’s not up to me, but if I’m in a creative rut or need to be inspired it’s hard to feel like that somewhere that’s overcrowded or not organized/cohesive. A cohesive layout will create cohesive ideas. Just an idea, i wish i could come in and help with everything! I love the gallery walk though",Jade Kaye Martin,2019-10-13T19:30:31Z,0

So I have decided since my husband wants his gaming man area (thinking about it) I want to make myself a babe cave (thanks to nicole for the idea) just a room I can decorate myself and be inspired and do things in there. And just be stress free and relaxed. I think I&#39;m gonna wait till next year. I&#39;m excited so much. Thanks NIcole for being a amazing role model and helping me learn so much about make up and so much more. I watch your videos all the time. They always make me smile.,Mara K,2019-10-07T17:52:35Z,0

"Ugggh. You look and sound so sad. I get where you are coming from, I have a very strong bond with animals as well.  I lost both of my ferrets but the 1st one that passed was so emotional and traumatic for me, he got sick and declined so suddenly. (I wont get into it all) but I literally had to take a week off of work. I was so bonded with him and I feel like I could feel his pain and suffering. I&#39;m an empath and sad things affect me so much, I feel like you are the same. I can see your sadness. All I can tell you is time heals, you&#39;ll never forget but you will feel better in time. I love you and I understand your pain.",Allissa Anne,2019-09-08T22:20:59Z,0
"I purchased $200 of my own hard working and earned money on a bed comforter, sheets, posters like those and pillows for my room last year from Society 6 and thought maybe I didn’t click something but it said I did buy it and it never came. My address was correct, I always double check those things too. I bought $200 worth AGAIN to see if there was a mistake and there went another $200 of my own hard worked and earned money. I don’t spend $200 on anything and decided to treat myself but I kissed some goodbye so I hope none of you ever have to go through this with Society 6 either. Love their things and wish I could buy it but I don’t have money to just throw down the drain unfortunately. Tried calling them and there was no number or anyone I could contact which made things more frustrating. Very happy everyone has been able buy amazing things from them, I’d be obsessed with them too if I actually ever got them — just a warning for everyone.",Brianna Johnson,2019-09-08T22:00:39Z,0

"Nicole:  If your ice cream cone light has an electrical plug/cord; you can get an applicance cord switch (from HomeDepot, etc), and connect it inline.  Then you would have an on/off switch.

"I have a large gallery wall in my living room, I centered it off of our tv. My way of putting our wall together compared to this is a little mad I guess? Lol. I literally just added piece by piece where I felt was right, no planning out. My advice is to find some sort of theme - whether that&#39;s with the vibe you want, frame types etc. Ours is themed off of traveling &amp; like dreaming quotes i.e &quot;Find your dream &amp; live it&quot; we also have a bunch of wall pieces we get while traveling out of the country 🤗.",lyfesadream,2019-09-06T05:45:49Z,0

"I recently was on vacation and the Airbnb came with a cat. I’m not really a cat person..  esp when I’m highly allergic.. but I fell in love with her.
