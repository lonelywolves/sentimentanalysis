Such a great idea to &quot;ground&quot; yourself by putting your feet in the soil. Also try hugging a tree. You can feel the difference instantly. I wish you didn&#39;t feel so self conscience about it in your own yard though. 😘,kokolatte825,2020-11-23T00:53:14Z,2

For years now I’ve see Nicole drink that coffee so I decided to give it a try (she makes it look so good) I bought the coffee added a splash of creamer like she does and drank it. <br />Hours later I started feeling crazy I didn’t know what was happening I felt drunk  and hung over at the same time. I had not clue what was happening.<br />Few days later my sister explain to me I was probably feeling crazy because the coffee is concentrate and way to strong for my weak ass. <br />I read the label and sure enough you’re supposed to water it down 😂,831gris,2020-11-23T00:23:03Z,4
