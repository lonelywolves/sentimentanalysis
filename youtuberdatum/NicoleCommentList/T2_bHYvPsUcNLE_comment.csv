"LoL I reacted the same way when I got microneedling ( I got endymed( it also has radio frequency for faster healing and smoothing of acne scarrs)<br />I looked like I had tiny tiny dots on my face for 3-4 days, but even after just one... my skin looks smoother, I got 2 more at least to get my skin smooth (I don&#39;t look forward to it) I hated the aftermath. But it&#39;s perfect timing to do it, school is online 🙃<br />Also It was suggested to get hydrofacials in between, I got my first couple days ago and I loved it 🥰<br />Please let us know how the botox goes for grinding",Setareh Sh,2020-09-21T01:20:02Z,0

Wear a night guard before you fracture a tooth. I worked in dentistry fur 23 years and have seen people crack their teeth.

I got micro-needling done and it was hella expensive and I was hella swollen. But it was worth it. Skin looked flawless for a few months. Wish I could afford the upkeep 😭,ItsKourtneyyy,2020-09-20T23:35:53Z,48

"OMG, I look like a train wreck after microneedling. I get so bruised and red. It looks like someone bit me with a grate. Works wonders, though!",Aimee J.,2020-09-20T23:34:03Z,0
I have TMJ/TMD too. It sucks and hurts all the time but I’ve been trying to sleep and keep my mouth open and relaxed and that really helps too,Lara Omar,2020-09-20T23:34:02Z,14
Lara Omar Consider trying another pillow! I used to have terrible Tmj pain. I tried everything and finally I changed my pillow to a generic soft plush one from Target and my pain decreased by like 80%,Anita Bee,2020-09-21T06:43:10Z,1
