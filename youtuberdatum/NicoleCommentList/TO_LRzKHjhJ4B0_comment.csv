Girl my tree has traditional lights. I can’t do the just white or just blue or just gold. My house colors are gray/neutral all year long. Christmas makes me think of childhood and happiness. Well my childhood was in the 80s and my Christmas decor reflects that lmao. I think a tree with multi colored lights is way  prettier to look at. Love all your decor and how you set it up! I am obsessed with your tree collection &amp; am slowly working on mine. I love them and gingerbread houses.💜merry Christmas!!,Belle’s Middle Grade,2019-12-05T22:28:06Z,0

Cried when you found your grandmas Christmas card. I lost my Grandma Christmas Eve 1999 when I was 12 . She had a brain aneurysm and was on a breathing machine and we took her off and she passed on her own dec 26th. She stayed with us one last Christmas even though she was brain dead.

I have kids and cats and a flocked tree. I have to put the tree up for the kids (can’t afford a new one and my flocked tree was my dream tree) and my one cat won’t touch it bc she’s scared to get yelled at but my other cat would not leave it alone last year. Every time we turned around he had puked somewhere bc he wouldn’t mess with the tree. It’s been up for a week and a half so far and he’s only thrown up twice and I’ve barely caught him near it so I’m really hoping he learned his lesson bc I’m not sure how to keep his mischievous butt away from it,wilde schroeder,2019-12-03T19:54:24Z,0

"When I worked at Micheals craft stores, I would create the holiday displays and I string my trees vertically versus wrapping the light strands around the tree. I feel it helps distribute the lights. You can stand in one spot when it&#39;s time to undecorate and pull them out.

I think trees are supposed to be fun and i just don&#39;t understand the need to stylize a tree. Each ornament on my tree has a memory behind it and a reason why its on the tree, its not just some colored glass ball that looks cute. Its fun .",Kate Irving,2019-12-03T04:52:50Z,0

If you buy a tree especially when having cats. You can use lemon or orange peels through out the bottom of the tree. Cats hate lemon. Or you can buy them a new playhouse and toys. you can do the no/yes rule with cats. Like no to the tree but yes to the new cat playhouse and toys either close or near by the tree. It’s a great way of keeping them not trying to jump and mess with your tree.,GLoVe,2019-12-03T03:48:44Z,0

Sooo crazy how you found a Christmas card from your Nan randomly! That was her just saying hi and that she misses you I’m sure. After my nana passed away i woke up in the middle of the night to use the restroom on the way back from the bathroom I found a plane ticket in the middle of the floor. It was a ticket from the flight I took to go actually meet my nana when I was older. I couldn’t believe it was in the middle of the floor because I had it put up in my closet. But I’m glad I got to actually get to know her before she passed. I believe she was just saying hi and thanking me for going to see her and get to know her because we really did have a good time. We are a lot alike and very intuitive.,Cynthia Anderson,2019-12-03T01:56:52Z,0
