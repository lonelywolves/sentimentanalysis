"The  L&#39;Oreal Magic Root Cover Spray, transfers everywhere. Great idea for a product, but damn if you wear glasses and slip them up and then back down, gets all your face.

"So I ordered the Zala extensions after I watched this. They. Are. Fabulous! Got the same shade she describes here, Rich Mocha Brown. I have dark cherry hair, but it&#39;s further brightened by a special shampoo &amp; conditioner that I use. So the effect is the dark cherry on top, dark mocha brown underneath. These extensions blend beautifully with my natural, tinted hair. If you&#39;re unsure about what length to order, I recommend that you order at least the 26 &quot; because you can always trim them yourself (watch a YT vid to learn how!).  (Sorry about the neg comment, Nicole. Keep doin&#39; you.)",Phyllis Anthony,2021-01-16T19:17:46Z,1

"There are a few basic types of luxury hair extensions that you need to be aware of before you begin your search. The basic types that we will cover are full volume extensions, root coverage volume extensions, and crown extensions. Essentially, full volume extensions offer the utmost in fullness, volume, and length. Full volume extensions are large enough to cover thinning spots on the sides and top of your head, as well as the crown and back of your head. These extensions are available in short and long lengths. Root coverage volume extensions, on the other hand, provide volume in the crown, while adding thickness throughout the length of your hair. These luxury hair extensions are typically worn by women with longer hairstyles. Finally, we have crown extensions, which provide length and fullness, and are designed to utilize the force of gravity.<br />Visit our website for more details:  <a href=""https://www.kmxtend.com/"">https://www.kmxtend.com/</a>",Mustafa Ali,2020-08-08T01:29:10Z,0

"Girl I&#39;m with you on the Kerastase products... They be expensive but worth it but come on now, can they make bigger bottles right?!! I had massively damaged and dehydrated hair a couple years back and the hairdresser gave me a bunch of their stuff to try, did a deep conditioning treatment and my hair loved it. It was the Nutrive line (the orange and white bottles), I had the shampoo (which comes in various strengths depending on how much nourishment and moisture your hair needs), conditioner and treatment.. and the smell.. so good.. their mythic oil is also a favorite.. great to put in your hair before styling or just to put in as it dries. Tames down the frizz and really helps lock in moisture. Another recommendation is the Gliss Hydra Miracle line, my favorite being the leave in bi-phase conditioning spray.. Its another smells awesome product but also does wonders to tame and make my curly ass hair manageable.. Loved this video girl... Got a bunch of new shit I want to try thanks to it..!!!",Tasha22Bella,2020-07-26T20:50:34Z,0

I have bought Zala 220 grams twice now and ended up hating them after about 3 months because I have fine hair and they end up looking like heavy dead weight under my real hair. They don&#39;t blend well and look almost matted in contrast/texture. An agent there was the one who told me to get the higher grams for thickness so I assumed I was purchasing the best thing for me, now I know they were just trying to make more money.

"Olaplex no.3 is amazing! As a hairstylist and someone who was nearly platinum blonde, I dealt with a lot of damage and dryness. The bottle says apply to dampened hair for 10 or so minutes then shampoo and condition as usual. I used to leave it in over night and sometimes double apply it. It really makes a difference in the porosity of your hair ( how well it absorbs moisture)and the strengthening the hair cuticle (each individual strand)!!",Amanda Maestas,2020-06-28T17:30:00Z,0

"For those who are using olaplex number 3 you put it on your hair BEFORE you shampoo and condition your hair but it’s is used best when your scalp is clean so use a clarifying shampoo and then towel dry your hair out the no. 3 in there, let it set, and then shampoo and condition your hair. Just like all hair products it is used best with its other products in the line. I highly recommend it to those who want very healthy weightless hair!",Ariana Mercado,2020-06-28T17:26:12Z,1
