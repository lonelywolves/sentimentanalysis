Hey Nicole be careful with widget smith. It recently came out that the app can be hacked and they use it to copy your screen. So anything you are doing the hacker can see. This includes getting verification codes or your banking info.,Maribe Mariana,2020-09-27T20:55:47Z,0

"Michelle Dominguez I just found a video on you tube! I couldn’t go into my settings to shortcuts at all. So, the video I watched, I went to the App Store to see if I had shortcuts, and yes I did! But couldn’t access through settings. I had to search in the toolbar in the spot where you can automatically go to your apps. If that makes sense?? Then, I went there, made a shortcut then went back to settings, opened shortcuts through there. And, the slide bar for unlisted shortcuts was on now. So, if that ever happens to you! But, thank you!!!",Bee Melissa,2020-09-24T02:24:24Z,2

Bee Melissa It doesn’t let you open the app at all? I just searched it up and the first thing it suggests is to restart your phone. If you’re almost out of storage that can also be part of the issue.,Michelle Dominguez,2020-09-24T01:49:33Z,0
