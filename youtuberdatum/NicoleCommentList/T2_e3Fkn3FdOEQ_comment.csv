"The&quot;ball&quot; or circle thing on the cap is for us who struggle opening caps. I have Lupus too. Tho mine attacks all internally, hers is more focused on the kidney. One of our struggles is arthritis as the immune system attack our joints so much. There would be days I couldn&#39;t walk or everything felt like swollen and couldn&#39;t move or painful (which is everyday). Lupus is an autoimmune disease. In layman&#39;s term, our immune system is sooooooo active that instead of just fighting illnesses or viruses and bacterias, it also attacks healthy cells and our organs. I just had an operation last month as it attacked my GI. I am in pain every damn day, so having this is so thoughtful. This may be weird looking to others but it will help us a lot. Something that will help us and make us feel beautiful is a plus!<br /><br />The doefoot also helps us not to pump coz I cannot. I have to open the bottle and dump or us the straw thingy to put product on the back of my hand or my face.<br /><br />Rumor or not, we cannot deny that this packaging and style of applicators help us soooo much. So it is acknowledged and appreciated by the people with autoimmune, arthritis, or disabilities. We will say it helps coz it does regardless if Selena did it considering our illness or not. It helps. :)",Snow Sian,2020-09-15T22:27:08Z,25
