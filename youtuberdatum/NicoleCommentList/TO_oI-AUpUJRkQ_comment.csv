"Literally been watching you since you started your channel girl!! Just thought I’d let you know, I’m a hair extension technician and your hair extensions should NOT be that tangled considering you just got a new set put in. You should ask what hair grade they are. They could be making you pay for a higher grade hair but giving you a lower grade.",Lorena Maria,2019-07-20T23:17:08Z,0

"Girl don&#39;t let your vet give your cat all those meds at once! In cats URIs (aka kitty colds) are a virus and some cats will flare, especially when stressed. Antibiotics don&#39;t do anything for that, it&#39;s like a cold in humans, it needs to run its course. There are things you can give to boost their immune system. Feed the most bio appropriate food you can, cats are obligate carnivores. Fresh is best!",Michelle,2019-07-20T20:27:49Z,0

"Everything you said about sunscreen only applies to Caucasian and very pale skin. Because of this inaccurate propaganda, ‘everybody’ are brainwashed to use sunscreen all the time. The negatives are 1. Darker skin tones need more sun than lighter skinned people for optimal health but they are not getting it anymore because of this brainwash 2. Many serious illnesses pop up at a later time that we think are not connected but they might end up being the result of not getting the beneficial qualities of sun light. 3. Because of this propaganda, people are rushing to buy sunscreens even if they cannot afford them which means they are buying cheaper chemical-laden ones which are so much more dangerous than natural sunlight. 4. There are many studies even pointing to kids ending up with autism or other illnesses because their mothers did not get enough sun they should be getting. I think at this time we talk about sunscreen more than enough and we as a society are already brainwashed enough. I feel like there is no need to mention more.",Dhyana,2019-07-20T17:57:45Z,0

"Hope your cats will be ok. My cat gets Lysine gel cause she had the feline herpes virus and it keeps her healthy, no sniffles or sneezing anymore. Every day gets a fingertips worth. If the limp by any chance is due to arthritis which my cat has had since young she gets Cosequin every morning and its been a miracle. She is almost 15 and can run. When I saw her limp years ago her X-rays showed arthritis so after her shot we put her on the Cosequin. 2 months later, never limped again. Crazy cat Mom here too. lol",catmama54,2019-07-20T16:42:25Z,0
