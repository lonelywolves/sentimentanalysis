"Huge pro tip for using dry shampoo, LET THAT SHHHHT SIT FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BEFORE YOU MESSAGE IT AROUND!!! If it’s a day I gotta use some dry shampoo it’s the first thing I do is spray that all in there and clip it up and I’ve left it for like an hour and it worked absolute magic! If it also leaves a white or grey cast, take a blow dryer to it for a minute on a low to medium temp and it gets it out. But seriously leave your dry shampoo to sit for 5 minutes at least and it works better than spray and blend it around.",Cassandra Stockert,2020-10-20T00:19:54Z,29
