Definitely do the video testing the 24 hour foundation and I think the Becca &quot;no makeup makeup&quot; foundation sounds interesting. You should do a video on that type of look when you just want a little bit of makeup,Lindsey Parrish,2019-06-19T20:26:31Z,0

"Hi Nicole! You should try the cover girl outlast active, it literally stays on through sweat but looks like healthy, dewy skin. It&#39;s crazy. I love all the products you mention cause I have the same experience with them cause I have the same skin type as you. I have been watching your videos for years and every product that you&#39;ve recommended or that I already had and you reviewed, I have the same experience with them. That&#39;s why I think you might like the cover girl outlast active foundation :)",Know1,2019-06-06T11:49:24Z,0

"I need some really good drugstore recommendations!!! I have to get foundations for myself and my 3 teens so it gets way expensive even at the drugstore🥴. We would love more than anything to try Laura Mercier, Estee Lauder, Lancôme , etc....but Good Grief whyyyyyy so expensive 😭😭",Crystal Fuentes,2019-04-23T22:53:49Z,3
"Look up Zabrena here on YouTube she has a lot of drugstore foundation reviews! I like the Makeup Revolution one and the Soap and Glory Kick Ass foundation. Also always look for coupons because Maybeline, Covergirl, L’Oréal, etc usually has coupons for money off and it may not be much but it does add up!",Bailey Knight,2019-04-24T01:03:30Z,0
"The wet n wild brand is so inexpensive and all their products are amazing! Foundations, setting powders, and setting sprays. You should give them a try good luck!",JulieeJewels,2019-04-24T00:41:41Z,0
