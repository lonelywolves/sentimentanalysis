@genevablanc When did all this happen?,Ashonayla3,2019-12-01T08:10:05Z,0
Let&#39;s just say Jaclyn put a picture of mean girls and wrote one was Nicole and the other was Carli. It happened when Carli called out Manny about not being nice with others including her. It seemed Jaclyn did not like it so she posted this. Carli replied and was saddened that Jaclyn defended Manny about his actions. Nicole just stayed quiet but it seemed that she was upset what Jaclyn did ever since Nicole does not mention or talk about her in any sort of way.,genevablanc,2019-11-23T17:45:50Z,3
Nicole is way too classy to talk about it. I admire that a lot. But then the &quot;it&#39;s easy to make a hand swatch look good&quot; had me ROLLING because...I&#39;ve seen a lot of shimmery highlight on hands and arms lately if you know what I mean <br />&gt;.&gt;<br />&lt;.&lt;,Christy Alison,2019-11-23T04:26:58Z,0

Yahaira Miranda I agree she could just say she wants to keep it private but instead says she will talk about it so we come back to the videos to hear the story that she never tells lol. I don’t think we are entitled to her personal life but she always lures viewers in then never delivers. It’s weird.,Rebecca Anderson,2019-11-27T17:26:58Z,6
"Diana Lira you are sooo right. I feel if she uploads more and make YouTube a priority she would have much more followers and also if she gave what the ppl want, that would help also. Some of these trolls on my post don’t get it. I’ve been a follower of hers since she basically started and I’ve been an OG follower, but I feel at this point it’s disappointing how she never follows through. Like if she doesn’t want to do a whole video fine, she could of talked about it on a video like this while she’s doing her makeup. There are ways.",Yahaira Miranda,2019-11-23T16:15:09Z,5
"Yeah girl... half the time she doesnt go through with what she says. Like mid year, she said she&#39;d post about their veneers... she didnt. And like 3 videos ago she also said she&#39;d talk about the engagement and she has yet to do so. I&#39;m starting to believe that she doesnt have enough following due to her lack of uploading.",Diana Lira,2019-11-23T16:02:25Z,3

"Girl I&#39;m like you about Christmas! The season comes and goes so fast! Yasss  it takes a while to get the decor right and all the boxes put away lmaooo! So,like you,  I start early too!

People that put their Christmas/Holiday decorations up early are shown to have lower stress levels and more endorphins produce cause they can enjoy them longer .<br />(I could be bullshitting but I swear I read that somewhere) &amp; If I did...
