"I’m all for taking care of yourself and equality but I guess I’m not only old (38yo) but old fashion, Jeremy living the life with her money. I’m not saying she should not share with him but lazy ass does nothing well I guess he cooks for her but sooner or later women get tired of this. I remember I used to say the same about Carly’s and people were mad at me and look at what happened. And I actually like and subscribe to Brett but it’s just the situation when I see the young successful girls paying for their partners.",EGMA,2019-04-17T10:29:38Z,1

"I lost all my top teeth after having my daughter at 20y old. 3 months after having her it began &amp; it was like a wildfire of decay. I saw a dentist once I could afford it &amp; he insinuated I was on drugs🙄 I told him it started after childbirth. He said &quot;oh dont blame the baby&quot;. Like wtf? When did I say my daughter killed my teeth sir? When? Asshole. Needless to say I switched dentists, have awesome insurance now &amp; had a ton of work done to them a few years back. I&#39;ve witnessed other women go thru the same shit tho &amp; its unfortunate bc the public immediately assumes you&#39;re on meth🙄 take a seat",caseyajb03,2019-03-21T23:20:01Z,1

"In regards to the panic attack, if you had freezing which I’m assuming you must have then you’re body goes into “fight or flight” mode and people often get anxious. My dentist tells me that some people don’t notice it and others are very sensitive to it. I’m one of those lucky ones that gets it every damn time. Also can be worse with the more freezing you get.

You shouldn&#39;t ever feel like you have to explain why you are getting veneers. I also had my teeth redone over the summer and it was the best thing I&#39;ve done for myself in a while. I had HORRIBLE anxiety set in mid drilling. I was numb from my cheeks to my throat but could somehow still feel the gritty bits hitting my mouth. I also think that you then realize you&#39;re at the point of no return. Your natural teeth are now gone and the fate of your our smile is in the hands of someone else. I&#39;m pretty sure even those who aren&#39;t anxious start feeling some type of way once that reality sets in. The permanent porcelain teeth will look soooo much different and be soooo smooth. They were interestingly cold when they first placed them on. I was self conscious about speaking or smiling because it was such a change and I was afraid of being judged. I went to a group in the St. Pete area (Klement Family) and they did an amazing job. I cant wait to see the finished product.,Prima Kaliebe Gonzalez,2019-02-23T17:56:54Z,0

"A someone who is diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder I can tell you for a fact you were having a panic attack. Sometimes being nervous about things can bring them on.

Idk if you’ll see this! BUT H2Ocean is what I have used for my Tragus piercing &amp; where I’m from(NY) tattoo &amp; piercing shops give that to you for cleaning the new piercings. It’s great. Sea salt mix &amp; it helped heal my Tragus so  well. I even had a keloid on it for awhile after I ran out and ordered a new bottle off amazon!! Definitely recommend 100%!!!!,K Dise,2019-02-21T20:28:24Z,0

I need implants, because no saliva, no dentures...and it&#39;s totally medically caused, but insurance doesn&#39;t pay for it.

Girl you good! A lisp has nothing to do with your teeth. You don’t even have one lol ppl with lisps (BAD ONES LIKE MINE) have them because they were born with enlarged tongues. The only way to get rid of a lisp is to have your jaw broken and a chunk of the back of your tongue surgically removed.. We also suffer from sleep apnea because when we sleep our muscles relax and the back of our throat actually closes up so we actually stop breathing for a certain amount of time.. you either have a lisp or you don’t you don’t develop one. Plus the lisp comes from the back of your mouth and tongue not the tip or front,LaRae,2019-02-20T20:53:10Z,0

"Hi Nicole, I totally understand your panic attack at the dentist, it’s fine just don’t hold to that memory or it will happen again 😕 I’m terrified of dentists because I have bad teeth as well but I need crowns all over my teeth and I’m going into the OR for that because of how sensitive and damaged my teeth are and to avoid my anxiety and a panic attack, I already have the top 4 front teeth with permanent crowns and they do change your smile,  also it gives you more confidence! Stay strong, we can do this!  ♥️ love the make up!",becksov,2019-02-20T12:14:59Z,0

If you use tea tree oil it will help your keloid! Use it only once a day though so it doesn’t overly dry it out. I had one on my tragus piercing and it helped. I’ve had so many problems with my rook. Tried a neck pillow but I wake up and its on the floor 😂,Ashley Childers,2019-02-20T05:14:07Z,0

"Girl... I&#39;m so excited that you posted  another video for us. But I must State this comment LOL.! What is up w/ hourglass sending out all these PR packages to all you influencers but always has the wrong freaking shade like what the hell.! SMH! Yeah and FYI you probably don&#39;t know, you probably didn&#39;t read in the pr package it tells you only to use a half a pump because a little bit literally goes a long way. If you apply too much a can look cakey and feel very heavy on your face. You can watch Emily Noel 83. She just did a review on The Hourglass Foundation. Highly recommend watching her. She&#39;s so authentic and down to earth. And she&#39;s very very thorough in her reviews.",Pumpkin0330 titi,2019-02-20T04:11:28Z,0

"They look great, but Oh girl! I hope you have better luck with your veneers than I did! I had the same issues you describe. So I searched out the best cosmetic dentist in Philly. Spent SOOOO much $. Adored them for the first 4-5 years. Then it turned into an absolute $hit $how 😳! At 35 I had to get implants on ALL my top teeth. My own teeth were just crumbling underneath the veneers. (As you know, they drill off all the protective enamel on the teeth) I couldn’t tell what was happening until I started having pain. and now I have to get the bottom ones done 😒",Bethany SchmidtEsthetics,2019-02-20T01:18:59Z,6
"Ciara Wetherell I feel for anyone who has gone through it! I know now they make ones that don’t require drilling the teeth to nubs. And I imagine if you have strong teeth to begin with it’s okay.

"As someone w small and not perfectly white teeth it makes me sad that my teeth isn&#39;t represented as much online anymore. It&#39;s ok to not have large chiplet teeth and it disheartens me that beautubers getting vaneers is becoming the norm.<br />I know everyone has personal reasons for getting vaneers, these are just my personal thoughts. ♥",Christine G,2019-02-20T00:51:19Z,36
"Balenciaga Lifestyle If your opinion is that earning money to be able to fix your insecurities is a good solution to achieve the norm of beauty and thereby happiness and confidence, we will clearly never see eye to eye in this matter.",Heidi,2019-02-20T14:26:19Z,2
"Balenciaga Lifestyle I didn’t say that, the starter of the thread said that in another comment. So that is not my statement, I am only talking about body positivity and how so many public role models getting stuff done adds to the general insecurity of their viewers, and adds to the unachievably perfect norm of beauty in society.",Heidi,2019-02-20T14:22:32Z,1
Heidi I don’t understand how it’s unachievable? You simply just have to work hard and find a career that you can make good money and you can do it as well! If people would stop spending all their time and effort watching influencers and comparing themselves and wishing they could do what they do and take that same energy towards being successful there would be a lot less of opinions and more happiness and results!💛✨💛✨,Balenciaga Lifestyle,2019-02-20T14:20:23Z,1
Heidi I AGREE WITH WE SHOULD JUST BE SPREADING POSITIVITY ALL THE WAY AROUND! The reason I replied to you is because you had stated that she is only youtuber that had teeth problems and the rest just get it done for a trend! Which is a false statement! So I decided that I would simply enlighten you and say that many other youtubers/celebrities have had “issues” with there teeth that got them done as well! We have to remember that people pick and choose what they want the world to know! So just because thru a video screen you thought they wonderful teeth in all reality is not the case! It comes off like a trend because dentistry is expensive  and doing youtube you make a lot of money and now they can afford it!💛✨💛✨✨,Balenciaga Lifestyle,2019-02-20T14:15:37Z,1
"Balenciaga Lifestyle I understand your opinion, I just don’t agree that it is healthy with role models on the internet who fix themselves to look like what society has made the norm of beauty. It becomes more and more unachievable, and only leads to more insecurity, because no one is perfect, but the standard of beauty nowadays demands perfection. We should be spreading positivity about loving our natural selves in stead. That is my opinion.",Heidi,2019-02-20T14:02:32Z,1

I have porcelain crowns (not veneers) and implants because I have bad teeth genetically.... Was wondering if you got them made at the DaVinci lab in California? They did all of my front teeth and the three upper teeth that I had to have implants done on. They were CRAZY MONEY but are gorgeous and look totally 100% real.  I&#39;m really happy with them and was curious if they&#39;re Davinci&#39;s from California. Fun fact: DaVinci did all of the smile makeovers for a show called &quot;The Swan&quot; years ago ;-),jemma28,2019-02-20T00:44:38Z,0

The back might be on too tight and so as it heals and swells there is no space for the swelling and it creates a keloid. Switch the earring for one that has a longer bar/stick so you can loosen the back. Same happened to me,keepingupwithkira,2019-02-20T00:41:25Z,0

Michelle Garcia i agree with you. I have to powder my face and I even over powder because I’m that oily and that doesn’t even help to stop the transfer. I bought the Covergirl Trublend foundation because everyone raved how it doesn’t stain and it does. When youtubers demonstrate it they just dab they don’t rub it.

"About your conch piercing!!! I had a conch piercing for several months and I too developed a &quot;keyloid&quot; It&#39;s actually called hypertrophic scarring, it&#39;s just irritation. The conch is a really difficult piercing which is why I took mine out, but I know you&#39;re using the sea salt spray to take care of your ears. What I like to do is actually like mix my own sea salt and tea tree oil solution and <del>soak</del> my ear in it. I like to put it in a paper/plastic cup and like, lean my ear into it and sit back up. I keep a towel under it to make sure I don&#39;t drip everywhere, and I leave it on for like five minutes. It feels weird and gross, but that tea tree oil and the actual soak will help your piercings so much. I had a flare up with my double helix, and doing a warm sea salt soak every day helped it calm right down. You can also just apply tea tree oil to the bump itself (Test it first to make sure you don&#39;t need to dilute it, but it&#39;s always better to dilute it anyway) and that will help it go away too. <br /><br />Also, I&#39;m so excited for your veneers! I need a host of dental work so I can only imagine how excited you must be! 143, hope the piercing tips help!",BeautyWithEvie,2019-02-20T00:32:52Z,0

"Jess79 I have really bad anxiety too and am sensitive to epinephrine. I usually just get this rush of anxiety for maybe a minute or two when they first give it to me. I have trouble getting numb so when a dentist tried to give me 2 syringes 💉to help me I had a huge panic attack and couldn’t even stay. The benefits are that it helps with bleeding and stays more localized. My dentist works with me and we usually do one shot of each and that works out. My dentist told me with lidocaine (the one with epinephrine) it’s easier to pin point it’s exact location and it stays there and the one with out it is like dumping a can of paint over it, that it just goes everywhere and he has to work super fast, because it wears off fast. So idk I think it just depends on the dentist.",S C,2019-02-20T16:52:28Z,2

"@Tereza Valencia Hopefully it will, you can try putting it 3 times a day. It&#39;s going to kind of peel and the bump will get smaller and smaller. It&#39;s like it peels the bump away if that makes sense. Good luck hopefully it goes away for you",Jazmin Cruz,2019-02-20T16:06:29Z,0
"@Tereza Valencia I didn&#39;t dilute it, test it out on your skin and if you feel its burns/hurts then dilute it with some water. I wash my face twice a day so I did it after I washed my face before my regular skin care. I would take a qtip and saturate it with the tea tree oil and dab it on my piercing. And let it dry, just an fyi it stinks so you have to get past the smell but once it dries you don&#39;t smell it anymore.",Jazmin Cruz,2019-02-20T15:52:54Z,1
