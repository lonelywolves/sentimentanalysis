"That’s so exciting about your teeth! My abusive ex knocked several of my top teeth out and it’s awful. Even though I was able to get my daughter and I away safely and he’s not a part of our lives anymore it’s like he still wins because I almost never leave the house anymore and when I do I’m so ashamed and embarrassed when I have to talk and I never smile. We can’t afford to get them fixed. Not for a long time but we’re trying to save. I’m so happy for you, no understands more than me how good it feels to have a beautiful smile!

"If your allergies are that bad, try taking Zyrtec in the morning and Singulair at night. They’re two different types of allergy meds, so they don’t interact negatively with one another or anything.

"Hi Nicole! I hope that you see this comment, but I wanted to introduce you to an amazing healthy living tool that can and will improve your life! You mentioned throughout your vlog that you&#39;re suffering from allergies and I totally get it (I used to be an all-season allergy girl). I started eating my 7-12 servings of fruits &amp; veggies which includes over 30 different varieties. I have not experienced allergies since Oct 2018. I highly recommend Juice Plus for you and Jeremy! Not many people do this, but if after 60 days you feel, &quot;Meh nothing is different&quot; you are able to receive a full refund. I know you probably dont want subbies to try to &quot;sell&quot; things to you, but while you help us find staple beauty products and home suggestions, I&#39;m here to help you and Jeremy live the best and most healthy life possible.<br /><br />If you are interested in learning about the research behind Juice Plus, take a look at <a href=""http://elliajohn.juiceplus.com/"">elliajohn.juiceplus.com</a> <br /><br />😊🍇🍎🥕🥬🍋",Ellia John,2019-03-12T12:40:30Z,0

Hola corazón ❣️.... Just a few tips for your allergies so you don&#39;t have keep taking medicine. A humidifier on your night stand you can put some Vicks vapor rub in it or you eucalyptus essential oil... You can also just do a steam like the ones for your face and sitting a bit close to it breathe in for a few minutes in the morning when allergies are worse.... lastly you can put some Vicks vapor rub on a q-tip and spread it around your nostrils for a few minutes then blow your nose and wash your face. I hope it helps. Just sum suggestions. Thanks for all you videos been with you a long time. ☺️,Martha's YouTube World,2019-03-06T07:05:19Z,0

I got my tragus pierces 5 weeks ago and I LOVE IT! But it does get irritated and swollen pretty easily which is annoying and delays the healing...

"Hey chickitty chick chick.  Everytime I watch you make coffee, I mean to tell you this. But then I don&#39;t... Lol. So I&#39;m gonna tell you now.  Obviously, everybody has different taste but I personally am not a fan of the coffee you use. I actually have an open bottle in my fridge right now. The one that I do love, though, and I think you should try is called Kona.  I get it at Publix and it&#39;s usually right next to the one you get. They&#39;re about the same price. I&#39;m telling you, it tastes sooooooo much better. It&#39;s only coffee I&#39;ve ever tried that I can actually drink black.  I do usually put a splash of creamer in mine though.  Speaking of creamers (lol), I also you use the same break that you do but I either get the sweet cream flavor or the honey cream. But I just tried this almond milk creamer, by Califia Farms, and it&#39;s bomb. Anyways, love your content and I just thought I&#39;d give you some suggestions on coffee incase you ever wanna try something new. K, see ya latah, bye.",Lauren Pereira,2019-03-04T19:09:06Z,0

"Try taking the zyrtec before you go to bed each night. That should help with the allergy symptoms in the morning.

I remember the first time I watched your videos, the “curls, CURLS, curls” one because I so badly wanted to learn how to curl my hair and no one would teach me. After that first video I hitched myself onto this journey of yours and I couldn’t be more proud! You’re an amazing human being, who has been an older sister / role-model to me for years. I also am an only child and as weird as it sounds we have SO MUCH in common.

"Yes, you NEED to take an allergy pill everyday in order for it to be affective. Kinda like birth control. And yes, with time it is possible that the pill is not as affective so you may need a stronger dose. You also have how many cats? That is going to intensify your allergies. <br />My advise to you love... get tested for allergy shots (indoor &amp; outdoor environmental allergens) so you know what triggers your allergies. You may want to consider allergy shots. It’s a HUGE commitment especially the build up phase (you go weekly for months) but guess what, pick one day a week you do something consistently- nails, hair, target run, etc. And add the shot as your routine. But I PROMISE I just made a year and time flew by. Or just continue taking medication forever 🤣 I mean this with love cuz  and not criticism cuz I feel your allergy pain 😘❤️",Melissa Torres,2019-03-04T03:03:35Z,0

Whatever youtube is doing to you is unfair. There is no way you shouldnt be above 3 million subs. Ive been waiting for it for over a year. We all adore you and appreciate you putting out content even though the algorithm is working against you. Love you.,MrTaylourp,2019-03-04T00:22:21Z,52
I’d rather her be a real human being than one who sells out for fame though.,Christina Duran,2019-03-04T06:00:42Z,11
She was above 3 million at 1 point then I guess a bunch of people unsubbed I&#39;m not sure why :( I love my girl and she&#39;ll get back there! And if she doesn&#39;t that&#39;s ok too cuz she has her ride or dies like myself!,Kelly Oliveira,2019-03-04T05:57:41Z,1
