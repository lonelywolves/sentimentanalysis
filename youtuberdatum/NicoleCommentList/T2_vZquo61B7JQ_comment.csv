"I think the wearing your hair down style is always the prettiest on brides, but unfortunately, your hair looks like shit by the time you get to your reception! Any curls are gone within a few hours, so you’ll look good for your pictures, but not really that good for the rest of your wedding",Nola Girl,2021-04-01T12:51:13Z,0

"Just curious, do you ever not use products and just do your hair with nothing but a iron &amp; dryer?    Like, do All those products make that huge of a difference?  Also, at start your hair looked great, before doing anything!   After, it was curled looked amazing......then brushed All curls &amp; waves out?    All that time  &amp;  effort for nothing.....lol!",Joseph Nadeau,2020-12-13T06:12:29Z,0

"I too have extensions.  I have had them for 20 years?  When I got married in 2010, 2nd marriage, which has been an amazing marriage, I did exactly what you have done.

It&#39;s beautiful.",Kristen Leblond,2020-11-11T02:26:07Z,0

love the hair style but i will say when I got married I regretted having my hair in my face I wish i would have pinned the front back because when you get sweaty 🥵 the hair in the front of your face starts to get messed up and looks bad in photos. My advice to Nicole walk around the house or go to the store with this hairstyle and take pictures throughout  the day to see how it sets after you&#39;ve run around and have been sweaty 😀,Esmeralda Vargas,2020-11-09T17:02:56Z,0

"So I never wanted to get married. I was totally fine going through my entire life without being a wife. Then I met my (now) husband. He definitely made me feel like I could see myself marrying him, but again, I wasn’t set on it. Then we finally decided to do it. Let me just say...it is SO special being married. I am his wife and he is my husband...it’s so weird to say! It truly does feel different in such a monumental, intimate way. When you look at Jeremy on Wednesday and know that you are exchanging vows, that he is going to be your husband, it just hits differently. Congratulations on your nuptials ♥️♥️♥️",Alexandra Merenda,2020-11-09T03:40:24Z,0

My younger cousin had extensions placed at mid-bottom back of her head (as you did in the video) for her wedding. Her stylist did an updo consisting mainly of the back of her hair (starting right behind her ears then back). She left similar soft curls around her face. The updo was done in such a way that to everyone it was beautiful yet it kept the soft loose curls she wanted after the ceremony at which point the updo was taken down really quick and it looked gorgeous. Congrats!,Alice Moral Denis,2020-11-08T23:14:58Z,0

"I went with a half up and half down hairdo, and I had side bangs that were out, along side a couple of long pieces it was curled . I grew my hair out for this occasion, my hair reached my bottom, it measured 24 inches. Mind you I’m half Mexican/Dominican sooo she was thick! I cut it and donated it and it felt so good. But enough about me, you will loook beautiful with what ever you go with. ❤️❤️",Jessuly Duran,2020-11-08T23:01:06Z,0
