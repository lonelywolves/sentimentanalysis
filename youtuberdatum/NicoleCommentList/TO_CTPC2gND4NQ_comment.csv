"Seriously the combo of the moving music and the self expression thru paint is so emotional. To me it was like she was painting herself, and the great ups and downs that she, and everyone, face in life and each trial and triumph and experience was a different color and a different mark she was painting on her face, making her who she is. 😫😭 so beautiful",Jenna Reynolds,2019-10-02T08:44:29Z,2
