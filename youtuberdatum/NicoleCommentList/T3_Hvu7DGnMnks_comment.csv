Omg momma say less ♥️♥️ so many of us have been there and we are crying with you and sending you and Jeremy prayers and love. Don’t apologize for privacy. Take time and heal. You’re health will always be important to us too. <br /><br />Also please get a dog. I’m a dog person and I remember back in the day when you had red hair and did that hair curling tutorial (it was the first video I saw of yours like 11 years ago) and I was like she looks like a dog person... I love the cats but I’ve been waiting a decade for you to get a dog tbh 🤣♥️,Bianca Vie,2021-04-16T05:11:03Z,1

"As soon as I heard her say “as a woman....” I knew exactly what she was talking about. She didn’t even have to explain without me already knowing what she was talking about.

A lot of influencers feel they have to tell their followers everything but you don’t. This is something between you and your family. We love you and understand not every event needs to be published to us. You can wait until your ready to say what it is. Or if you don’t want to share at all. It’s your life. We will support and watch even if you skip a few personal moments. 🥰❤️,Leah Gamboa,2021-02-16T16:46:59Z,1

I was able to give birth to a healthy baby girl who is now 6 years old. 2019 I found out I was expecting my second child with all the emotions and fears I had an ectopic pregnancy at 6 weeks of gestation. I went through surgery almost lost my life from the excessive bleeding since the fetus rupture. It took a lot of my mental health to heal and stop blaming my body for it. You will get through this.

So you can use the Kenzie everyday? It says once a week. I bought it recently for my facial hair because I have PCOS do I have a nasal beard unfortunately. It makes me feel SO ugly. I hate it. I ended up getting a Groupon for laser hair removal right around the same time because I need hardcore help. I plan on using the Kenzie after my 6 treatments of laser bc I know I&#39;ll still have hair bc its bad. I&#39;m going to use it on my underarms in the meantime tho so I want to know if I can use it daily.,Kelly Oliveira,2021-02-10T17:40:46Z,0

Hi Nicole 💕 I don’t usually comment but have been watching you for a long time .. you were actually one of the first you tubers I started watching and you took me out of such a dark place years ago. I had to replay this video from the beginning after reading the comments. You and Jeremy remind me SO much of my husband and I (we just got married in December but have been dating since 2012) and we had a rough start to 2021 as well. You never think it can happen to you (like anything else) but when it hits you it hits HARD. It has been 2 months and I am doing better but right after it happened it was extremely difficult. I would really love if you would do a sit down because being able to relate to other people who have been through the same thing has seemed to be the only thing that helped me 💗 sending you much love and prayers. We will get through this! XO,Melissa H,2021-02-10T15:01:53Z,0

"i’ve too been “that woman” and just know that your not alone and that me and mine are sending you all the peace &amp; healing you, your body &amp; Jeremy need. It’s not easy, it’s extremely hard but you will heal. You’ll never forget it but you’ll learn to live along side it. We actually brought a candle specifically that says “An Angel in the book of life wrote down my baby&#39;s birth. And whispered as she closed the book too beautiful for earth.” and everytime we’re having a hard day, we light the candle and cry. You’re allowed to cry. Grief is just unconditional love with nowhere to go. No matter what gestation, your allowed to cry and be hurt and disappointed. At first I blamed my body, like it had let me down, but it was just grief and I needed something or someone to blame. You’re allowed to grieve, cry and be angry. Just find comfort in the fact we’re all hear with you &amp; you’re not alone. You will find peace and happiness, I’m sending you all the best wishes in the world! ❤️❤️",Chloe Mansfield,2021-02-09T20:50:13Z,9

"You&#39;re someone i&#39;ve been following since i was in high school and it broke my heart to hear &quot;as a woman...&quot;, i lost two babies last year and i watched your videos as i forced myself to feel good every day. Just know that you have an enormous support system, there are more people who can relate than you&#39;ll ever know. If you don&#39;t want to share, just don&#39;t. I could hardly ever bring myself to talk about mine. We love you, Nicole. 143 🤍",Memory Coe,2021-02-09T19:06:19Z,0

"Maaan every time I see one of your videos regarding Kenzzi I just so bummed! I bought one because of your videos last year and either they didn’t actually deliver it, or It was stolen, I never got it. I was given such a runaround by Kenzzi that I was certain that I was never actually speaking to a person. One moment they tell me they’re going to open a claim, the next moment they’re asking if it was resolved. So frustrating. I didn’t think it was worth the headache anymore. Anywho! I’m sorry for the starting this off so negative! So glad you’re back! I love love your Car chronicles. You’re the most relatable person here. Hope all is well!",Maria Mercado,2021-02-09T19:01:15Z,0

But take all the time u need. It happen like 23yrs ago and when I hear people talk about it it brings it all back. You don’t have to talk to us about it but I would recommend maybe talking to a psychologist. I wish I had. My husband and I already had a daughter so we was really wanted a boy. My husband is a person that would of loved having a boy. He’s very outdoorsy and into sports. I  really feel like it was our boy. I was 12wks and I found out right before Christmas so we had already got Christmas gifts. Please take as much time as u need. It’s something that u need. I had a beautiful baby girl afterwards. We all love u and we don’t want u coming back until u can start feeling something more than sorrow. I know I have a loving family and husband. Lean on each other cry with each other. I wish nothing but the best for u. When u finally feel like u want to try again it will be scary but u can get through it and it will make the next time even more special! Sending nothing but great vibes for u and Jeremy! #143,Amy Long,2021-02-09T14:33:56Z,0

"I&#39;ve been going back and forth if I wanted to share my story. A part of me feels the internet has conditioned us to be so transparent; leaving no room for privacy.  However, I know I am friends with a lot of women on facebook. Some are mothers and some are not, and maybe there are some who have experienced or are experiencing what I am as well. My hope is for others to find strength within my words, as I have found strength within the words of others. Walking away from this situation has left me with a new found respect towards all women and our ability to create the gift of life. What a blessing! <br /><br />I was 6 weeks pregnant when I found out that my body had miscarried. It may not seem like a long time, however, my outlook on life has changed forever. Although I may not know the answer yet, I know everything truly happens for a reason. I confidently believe God has other plans for me right now and for those who may be going through the same experience.  <br /><br />For those women who have babies, I envy you.  Your ability to do the coolest thing in the world: grow a life from within. Never take that ability for granted. Women, we truly run the world. <br /><br />I&#39;d like to share a poem expressing this vulnerable time. I know there are other women who have felt the same pain and confusion as I have and I can&#39;t stress enough that we are not alone:<br /><br />I met you yesterday. <br />It was sooner than I anticipated. But it didn’t make me love you any less.  <br />I never got to hold you or hear your heart beat, but I felt you inside me.  <br />People ask me, “how did you know”. And as cliché as it sounds, you just do. A Mother’s instinct, if you will. <br /><br />I keep asking myself, was it something I did. But deep down I know, this was an act from God. <br />A gift is a gift regardless of how long I had you. And a life of any sort is truly a blessing.<br /><br />I wish I appreciated you more.  I wish that I embraced the short time we had together. <br /> A guilt that will never subside. <br /><br />Yesterday I met you.  <br />Exactly one week and a day after I confirmed you were there.  <br />I found a satisfaction in watching you exit my body; knowing now you would never have to suffer in this world. <br /><br />The week we spent together, felt like a lifetime. Time truly stopped.<br />The love I felt for you consumed me and I immediately began wanting to protect you. <br />I started to imagine what life would be for you.  <br />Am I capable of raising you?  Am I capable of giving you the perfect world you deserve to be born into?<br />My fear of failing consumed me.  <br />You deserve everlasting happiness and security, and I began to doubt my ability to provide that for you. <br /><br />When the doctors told me the news, you reintroduced me to God. <br />I was reminded how out of my control life truly is, which caused me to find faith. <br />I started to forget the fears and doubts. <br />Slowly, I regained my self worth; embracing the unconditional love I had for you. Realizing, I was chosen to have you. <br /><br />You gave me a purpose in life, something I have always struggled to find.<br />You made me a version of myself that I have never been: a momma. And your momma I will always be. <br /><br />I met you yesterday. <br />A day I will never forget.",May Scapellato,2021-02-09T14:07:44Z,0

"Love you Nicole. And “as a women” yes we know your pain and atleast myself I know your pain. “We’ve” been through it but please don’t let it discourage yall. Just take your time to heal both and try everything don’t give up and not only science, I tried everything and thankfully it helped. If it is or isn’t this I’m still going to put it out there for anyone. I’m Hispanic and well we believe in all of the tea recommendations and sobándote la matriz bc sometimes it falls when carrying heavy stuff or just workouts in general everyone is different. So I took all these teas they sell them seperate or all together. Tea Garañona, Damiana I took it in pills everyday me and my husband, Valeriana and go gobernadora. I also got some pregnancy injections that are REALLY really great after this happens. They are to strengthen your matriz they are called “cuerpo amarillo injections”. You could do them every day or every other day. I took them until 10weeks and it was fine. And also last but not least never lose hope. God always has a plan and some Angeles are meant to take care of us in heaven and some on earth. Just never lose that hope. We love you and hope it helps if this is it. If not I’m sorry and just know I mean nothing but love ❤️😘🙏🏻",Maricela A. P.,2021-02-09T06:09:57Z,0

If its what I think it is, then 1: you dont have to explain it to THE INTERNET, (you&#39;re real followers will love and support you no matter what!) and 2: it is one of the most traumatizing thing you can ever go through so take all the time you need to try to heal but make sure Jeremy is included in your healing.

It’s devastating and so hard, but you’re a badass woman and just know you are not alone. Speaking out about it has helped me so much and if/when you are ready, I truly recommend it. I spoke out about it because I wanted to help at least one person going through the same thing and to end the stigma around it. Also, reading all of these comments on here has helped me even more. You’ve already done so much good without even knowing it! Anyway, here to support whatever you do! Sending so much love ♥️",Ellen Douglas,2021-02-09T03:32:19Z,0

"AnjoliMonae<br />So glad to see you and your well!! ❤️❤️❤️<br /><br />Target Tips - for the GG veggie  crackers, ask for the grocery manager for dry foods, tell him how how you rave over these,<br />Your a huge target quest and That you would like to put in a requests they be sold as individual ( Target DOES listen) add that on a twitter comment and what you get your GG veggie crackers all by themselves! Unfortunately, I’m in the Atlanta market and it’s by store and district that they see demand and supply ( you’ll see the manager pop out his handy dandy zebra Tech device - all tha food stuff happens on there ) <br /><br />Target Tip again...  Pssst Jeremy... the vendor for the cards come in the mornings Aberdeen 9am and noon on different days.. they mix it up on purpose. . Ask for the store director in the mornings just have a chat ... Jeremy style swag chat.. let him know .. they will slip you in on the goods of the cards , when the vendor comes , etc... also if that target had them in a certain department , talk with the employee that’s always back there ... maaaaan listen ... and if it’s by the self check out ... I’m tellin ya, they will spill the business!  Get them retail cards on lock! <br /><br />Yeah.. you can tell them Target sent ya ( pssst.. a team member) then again ... keep that to yourself ..",AnjoliMonae,2021-02-09T02:27:57Z,0

You are entitled to have your privacy but know you are not alone. We will grieve with you because it is a pain I wouldn’t wish on no one. Stay strong my love. 🤍🤍🤍,Maireliz,2021-02-09T01:04:19Z,0

"As much as I LOVE Nicole &amp; would love to see her be vulnerable with us &amp; show her bad days, I completely get why she isn’t. The internet can be cruel &amp; judgmental &amp; instead of lifting someone up, some people like to make things worse. Praying for you Nicole. 🙏",Brianna Ochoa,2021-02-09T00:09:52Z,0
