Labellevie it’s an investment and worth it. If you want it save up for it or do monthly payments. Otherwise just blowdry and curl your hair. You’ll just have more damage without the dyson.,Ashley,2020-09-18T21:34:24Z,0

But you can use it over and over. It’s more cost efficient than going to a salon multiple times. I have the airwrap and it’s expensive but makes my hair look amazing!

"Hey Nicole, I hope this is ok to leave on your channel. A friend of mine who is 20 years old and diagnosed with Merosin-deficient-congenital muscular dystrophy (MD-CMD) has started her YouTube channel. She loves makeup because its one of the few constricting things she can do in a wheelchair. You can look her up on YouTube at Peyton Coffey,        <br /><a href=""https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCFgUNT5tQ3kCDXNXM0aPDsw"">https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCFgUNT5tQ3kCDXNXM0aPDsw</a>. I&#39;m just hoping to bring more attention to her channel....her goal is to share that people with disabilities are beautiful too.

Much love to everybody right now ❤",blue1540,2020-03-22T05:44:53Z,0

Question!! Can you help with how you keep brassy/ redness out of brown dyed hair. I recently died my black hair to brown with some lighter parts in the front. I’m having such a hard time getting rid of the brassy ugly red lights on parts of my hair.  If you have any recommendations please hook a sister up. Thank you!,Lidia Torres,2020-03-21T18:52:31Z,0
