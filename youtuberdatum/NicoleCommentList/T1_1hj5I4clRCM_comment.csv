"I have been a Vital Proteins girl pretty much since they came out with their collagen but tried six months ago, after seeing Probase Sports Nutrition Collagen Peptides everywhere and I am impressed!

"I have tried PROBASE SPORTS NUTRITION COLLAGEN PEPTIDES POWDER for the first time two months ago and I have to say it beats most other collagen peptides powders I have tried. It is 100% Grass-Fed, UL third-party certified, has no taste, smell or sweeteners in it, and is 100% Collagen Peptides. I used to get some minor stomach pains with other brands, not with this one. If you are looking for a clean and extremely soluble collagen peptides powder, then I am highly recommending Probase Sports Nutrition Collagen. I bought mine on their website at PROBASENUTRITION DOT NET, although I believe you can also buy it online at WALMART AND EBAY. It dissolves easily too.",Francisco Martin,2020-11-03T22:48:01Z,0

"Collagen is just protein. Flaxseed oil will help a lot on the scalp! You should get blood work done, you&#39;re extremely deficient in something. Iron is probably one since you just lost a lot of blood to have a baby, which can cause hair loss in clumps if deficient. Vitamin A is usually another one. Are you breast feeding, should be asked?

I cant take any mg of biotin. It caused me to have horrible cheek/chin acne. What was worse is when I was pregnant a few years ago my acne got so bad and I thought it was the hormones.

"Biotin, B6 really doesn&#39;t work by itself, it turns food into energy. It&#39;s a water vitamin. Most people have breakouts when they take an excess of 1 without the others. You have to take it as a b-complex. And it&#39;s the B9 that will help.  Gummies are not potent, which is why she doesn&#39;t have the effect. Plus you have to be deficient in it for a vitamin to work. Since you&#39;re past 35 with decent skin, look into silica (biosil), vitamin A, and/or msm for hair and skin effects that naturally decrease in your body the older you get.",Christina G,2020-03-27T00:29:16Z,4

Maybe but I think it’s hard for all of us right now...😘,Tami Torelli,2020-03-27T18:34:32Z,0
Tami Torelli 🤷🏻‍♀️ time will tell I guess. She disappeared for a long long while and she said she was going to fill us in on what’s been going on with her but she never uploaded the video and that’s was almost two weeks ago. She showed a preview for it but never uploaded it &amp; she seems really down here. She went ghost on social media so all of that has been making me think that she’s been feeling down but hey maybe I’m just looking to hard into things 🤷🏻‍♀️,Reiki ByCass,2020-03-27T03:18:15Z,0

I went to get some blood work done because my hair keeps falling like aloottt it made me cry...  it&#39;s only been 2 weeks since I&#39;ve been taking biotin but 🙏 my hair stops falling 😔.... any suggestions???,Vanessa Fernandez,2020-03-26T23:47:53Z,1
"@Jamie VanPelt  yes, I was talking to my mom about the shower head filter i guess now that you said it I&#39;m going to buy one and continue to take my vitamins and hope my hair stops falling",Vanessa Fernandez,2020-03-27T02:31:18Z,0
"Biotin does not help hair grow. It&#39;s a B6 that turns food into energy. If your hair is falling out in clumps, check your iron levels. Women are prone to low iron due to our mentral cycle. If you&#39;re pale, sometimes has dizziness, tiredness.... it&#39;s your iron. Iron from meat stored better in the body and you may need a supplement. Taking b vitamins just gives you energy, which masks your actual problem. If you are going to take B vitamins, take a B-complex so you don&#39;t break out.",Christina G,2020-03-27T02:18:44Z,2
Black Panther I think she meant that she prays her hair stops falling 😊,Moly B. Denum,2020-03-27T00:52:33Z,1
LifeWithAlex it could be due to an iron deficiency as well! I’m anemic and ever so often my hair drops like crazy and it even falls out in patches! Been using biotin for almost 2 months and 2 weeks in it stopped falling! I just think using supplements/vitamins works differently for everyone so you have to first find out what’s causing your hair fall in order to properly treat it...good luck though I hope it stops falling cause I know how frustrating that can be 😔,Moly B. Denum,2020-03-27T00:51:57Z,1
Have your Vitamin D levels checked. Low vitamin D can cause hair breakage or hair loss. It could also be a hard water issue. I had to get a shower head filter when I moved to a new city.,Jamie VanPelt,2020-03-27T00:03:06Z,2
