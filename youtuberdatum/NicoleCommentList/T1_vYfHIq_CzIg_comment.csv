I’m super skeptical of these Neocell claims..... collagen is a structural protein and would essentially be broken down in your stomach before it ever reached your skin or anywhere in the body to do any good. Do they address this anywhere?,Jackie Shelton,2020-01-14T03:47:29Z,22

"My trick for collagen powder: warm 4 oz of water in the microwave for 1 min. Add the number of scoops recommended to the warm water and stir. Add a few ounces of juice of your preference and stir. I usually do orange, grapefruit, pineapple, so on to my mix and drink it. This has been my go to  everyday for 4 months. You&#39;re still taste some of it, but ira much easier",canali,2020-01-15T23:53:33Z,1
