I felt that had to quit jobs 😭 I’m glad I’m not alone ❤️🙏🏼 I had to quit because of petty coworkers who’d like purposely mess my work and like talk really negatively to my manager and it’d creat friction in the work place just because I didn’t fit it or taking a job I knew I wasn’t qualified enough for like I was 21 running an apt complex of 50+ units in a bad area of town and I felt sooooo guilty because my dad had got me that job in a way but I was going in for a property manager assistant but ended up taking on a whole property. I kinda beat myself up a lot for quitting that I got therapy. 😅 It all lead me to find what I actually wanted to do in a career and pursue it. 😊🤍🙏🏼,Meli J,2020-12-01T06:59:33Z,0

"Work story:  I was bartending a really busy night.  A dude was sitting at the bar with a frisbee in one hand and a whiskey rocks in the other.  I was making a long island, turned around to ring someone up and turned back around to see the dude nodding off so I told him to leave.  He got belligerent and eventually escalated so I had the bouncer take him outside.  I didn&#39;t realize when I had turned around, he had thrown up in the frisbee.  It was still sitting on the bar but I didn&#39;t see the puke in (it was dark) so I picked up the frisbee quickly to move it and it slung vomit all over me and the people that walked up to my station to order.  This was the moment that ended my fifteen-year bartending career, kind of a camel straw situation if you will 😂",Seanna Miriah,2020-12-01T01:44:44Z,18
