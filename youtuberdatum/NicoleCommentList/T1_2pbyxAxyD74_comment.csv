I think the dupe for that color wow is the newer L’Oréal sleek it. It’s heat protection and for straightening. It claims to keep your hair straight for three days and it does. I LUV that stuff! It’s always on sale for like $4. It literally keeps my hair straight for days and I have curly color treated hair. I don’t straighten my hair often but when I do I definitely use that. Also it’s also heat activated. I would use it for curling to but I don’t have to curl my hair.,Shahalie Shai,2020-03-19T05:26:30Z,0

I love her videos but every foundation product I try that she uses just isn’t for me because there all so full coverage &amp; I thought I knew what full coverage was until I tryed her Clinique foundation witch made me breakout also it’s so Cakey but she lives in Florida so I would assume u need a full coverage last all day kind of makeup I mean here in az it’s hot af but if I put 2 much foundation it just gets blotchy if I sweat :/ still my opinion on them might be different for others not all products work for every one 🙃,Liz Celento,2020-03-04T13:53:16Z,0

"I&#39;m really digging this style of video, it&#39;s a nice mesh of both your vlogs and the traditional sit down favorites format so it keeps most people happy regardless of which style they prefer. For me, honestly girl I&#39;d watch you do anything so I&#39;m always here no matter what you decide to post. I&#39;m so thankful that you&#39;ve never changed or fallen too deep into the influencer rabbit hole where you lose your individual flair and come out a cookie cutter beauty guru. Instead you&#39;ve stayed in your lane doing your own thing and not followed the trendy clout crowd and because your videos are so authentic and so you (real and honest) they don&#39;t feel overprocessed and overpolished (they&#39;re perfect obviously but you know what I mean) and in my opinion that&#39;s why you&#39;re still so liked and you&#39;ve stood the test of time in this crazy corner of YouTube land. You&#39;re still the same OG beauty guru that I&#39;ve watched for yearrrrs and I love you for that reason, when I watch you it&#39;s like the good old days of YT which is so rare to feel or to find nowadays, it&#39;s kinda like I&#39;m chillin with an old friend which is so comforting 😘 143",MadHatterMH,2020-03-01T00:20:59Z,0
