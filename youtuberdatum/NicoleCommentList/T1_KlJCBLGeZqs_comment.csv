"Nicole when you mentioned how disappointed you were about the crowded beaches I had to pause and head to the comments.  I live in NJ and we see the same thing in the parks.  My husband unfortunately is an essential worker.  I say unfortunately because he is immune compromised specifically his lungs.  Every day that he leaves for work I worry about weather or not he will pick up this virus that yes most people fully recover from.  But theres a good chance he&#39;s not most people.  My husband was my first love, my first date, my first kiss.  My one and only.  He has two young daughters and a family that loves him.  Anyone that choose to disobey the quarentine is risking my husbands life and anyone else who is immune compromised or older.  Stop being selfish isolate and stay 6 feet away.  This won&#39;t quarentine won&#39;t last forever but loosing a life is forever so do whats right.  Nicole I love seeing you and Jeremy together, your a beautiful couple.

@Mel 21 They are getting demonetized because some people have taken advantage of the crisis and spread misinformation about it. I guess YT deemed it easier to blanket demonetize all videos automatically so noone can profit from using the word rather than go after videos individually once it&#39;s too late.,msromanticreads,2020-03-25T03:01:39Z,11

"Hey Nicole, I hope this is ok to leave on your channel. A friend of mine who is 20 years old and diagnosed with Merosin-deficient-congenital muscular dystrophy (MD-CMD) has started her YouTube channel. She loves makeup because its one of the few constricting things she can do in a wheelchair. You can look her up on YouTube at Peyton Coffey,        <br /><a href=""https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCFgUNT5tQ3kCDXNXM0aPDsw"">https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCFgUNT5tQ3kCDXNXM0aPDsw</a>. Her most recent video is a super sweet unboxing with her mom. I&#39;m just hoping to bring more attention to her channel....her goal is to share that people with disabilities are beautiful too. Due to her disability and compromised immune system she is stuck at home and I would love if some more people could find her channel. Much love to everybody right now ❤",blue1540,2020-03-25T01:04:07Z,0

"Omg I’m almost never in 100 comments. Lol. It sucks being stuck at home. I work in the hospital and it’s madness. I get so worried I’ll bring it home to my family. Specially my mom because she’s all day. I took care of her. My uncle just died from this last week. He lived in Brooklyn, NY. As soon I as I come I home I undress in the back and place my stuff in a paper bag, shower real good and put on fresh clean Pj’s and then wash my stuff. 😩🥺😔. My mom has been a mess. I try to make her laugh everyday to get her mind off of her bff dying from this horrible virus.",Kathy Coleman,2020-03-25T01:02:37Z,0

"@Chloe Julian hi.😊 I started off small .... just with the sharpener (bought 2-it&#39;s really cool) and I got the clear gloss, which I like so far. I also bought that <a href=""http://balm.com/"">balm.com</a> but honestly don&#39;t think I&#39;ll repurchase. It has petroleum. I knew that going in but I just bought the Birthday cake one to try on my cuticles at work. I hear mixed reviews on their skincare, so I&#39;ll stick to what I already use.",pinkphoenix1111,2020-03-25T16:23:16Z,1
