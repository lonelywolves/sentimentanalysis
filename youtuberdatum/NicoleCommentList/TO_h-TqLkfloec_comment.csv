I’m half Scottish with Irish and then half Native American so in the warm months I’m very tan/ dark but once winter hits the Scottish / Irish in me comes out so since I don’t see the sun much. So I tan in the winter to keep my skin the color I’m used to being .  I prefer self tanner because I don’t want skin damage . I can walk to the mail box and come back with intense tan lines,Megan Rose,2021-04-08T20:16:38Z,0
"For me, I notice that when I&#39;m darker in the summer, &quot;flaws&quot; of the skin are less noticeable. Bruises, cellulite, etc...<br /><br />Self tanning is great to me because it&#39;s like make up for the body. I&#39;m super light complected but in the sun I can get pretty dark, and stretch marks and scars can annoyingly look more aggravted from sun exposure. With self tanner, even if I&#39;m naturally tanned from the sun, it covers those issues like concealer or foundation, and it can be used to contour the body and give the illusion of being more slim. Even my fam and girlfriends blessed with way more melanin than me, use self tanner for those reasons (Jackie aina has a video about using it to even out her skin tone, etc...). <br /><br />Melanin abundant skin is so beautiful and it should be embraced on the people born with it naturally not just the ones who completley alter their appearance and call it a look. Unfortunately we live in a world where some influencers will self tan themselves to the heavens, then have hateful, racist tweets show up 👎 the logic is absent and ignorance is present in many. In real life in the sun, and as a kid, Nicole probably got as dark as this naturally but we know that UV rays can be damaging so she fakes it and shes getting that coin at the same time.",Talisha Lara,2019-12-23T10:39:18Z,0

"I know so many people are scared of the sun, but if you hear from people in the southern states where there is way less sun than say Los Angeles, those people are always so deficit in Vitamin D. I’m from L.A., and I don’t take the time to lay out in the sun much, but I ALWAYS feel better when I have a little natural glow from the sun. I feel healthier, I have more energy, I look younger etc. I feel like there’s more danger in hiding from it, truthfully. If you’re Extremely pale, then yes you have to avoid it. But when I’ve avoided the sun years at a time it only succeeded in making me look and feel worse. So I’m an advocate for 15 minuets a day at least walking around in the sun.",Bridgette Mezlini,2019-12-20T01:08:45Z,0

"Ladies just a tip for the very fair skinned or sensitive skinned...wait a minimum of 30 min after showering and especially after shaving before applying your tanner, so that pores can shrink.
