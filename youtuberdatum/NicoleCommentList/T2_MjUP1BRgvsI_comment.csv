You’re hair is growing out beautifully any tips on hair growth I cant get my hair to get past my shoulders 😫,Crystal Guzman,2020-10-16T22:54:57Z,13
Crystal!! Saw this and wanted to comment bc I had the same issue so many years ago. The secret: BABY TRIMS!! I’m talking a light dusting every 4 weeks. Trim a teeny tiny amount and I promise your hair will grow. I also do coconut oil masks 1-2 times a week. Those trims made my hair GROW. now it’s so long! Hope that helped 🙊,Rebecca Nobrega,2020-10-17T18:00:08Z,0
