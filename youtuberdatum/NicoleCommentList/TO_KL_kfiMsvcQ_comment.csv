Believe in Jesus, that He died on the cross for your sins. And God resurrected him 3 days after his death. Seek him and you will find Him. TRUST GOD. 🙏🏻✝️✨",Mary J,2019-09-18T02:56:26Z,1

"It seems like you are over YouTube with how  inconsistent you are. I used to be your biggest fan since day 1 but now you are just so all over the place and it seems so forced and ingenue. I would quit while you’re ahead and just be real that you’ve moved on with you life and YouTube makeup videos are not your main focus. We can all tell. I don’t want to be cruel, I’m just giving feedback as someone who follows multiple gurus and this is just not fair for dedicated subscribers. This is a job and business, we are consumers.
