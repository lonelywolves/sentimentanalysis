❤️the look. I feel sometimes awareness makes the animal more endangered.  I only say this cause the animals that were endangered when I was younger are worse than before. Also the poachers who&amp; when caught Again the USA are the biggest advocates for the animals but Asia &amp; Russia are the biggest users of “ancient “ treatments for male enhancements ( look them up) &amp; fur coats/ect.,bellyisis,2019-10-30T02:46:24Z,0
