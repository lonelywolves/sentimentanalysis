"Ok Nicole I think I know what your hand pains may be from haha. We are the same age and I have the same problem, also had similar issues in my twenties. Do you browse on your phone a lot before bed, when you’re laying down in bed? That’s apparently what my hand pain is from. Holding my phone in the way I do while browsing gives the nerves in my fingers and hands pain. Odd but makes sense. Just something to think about. Hope this helps!",specialK,2020-07-30T16:00:24Z,0

Hair tip for working out! I usually blow dry my sweaty hair lol it sounds gross but your sweat from your hair follicles actually doesn’t smell ( you can also just wait for it to air dry) Once your hair is actually dry then apply dry shampoo. Dry shampoo does nothing if your hair is wet!,Miranda Danielle,2020-07-19T21:04:39Z,2

"Girl!! How do u drink that chameleon concentrate without cutting it more? I do half a glass of the coffee concentrate, 1/4 water and then 1/4 creamer. It says it on the bottle it’s supposed to be cut. I didn’t realize it the first time, and just did cream and coffee and got so sick, I legit had a caffeine overdose. It was so bad. I couldn’t even walk. I usually get the chameleon cold brew iced coffee instead of the concentrate now. U get it already ready for drinking. The one in the glass bottle is concentrate.",Corinne,2020-07-19T19:26:02Z,0
