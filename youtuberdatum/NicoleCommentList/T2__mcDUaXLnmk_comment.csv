I mean I could def prob figure it out on my own I just want to see her do a makeup vid lol..ps I always cut my hoodies n t-shirts so they don&#39;t choke me like that. I can&#39;t stand anything touching my neck in the front. With the hoodies I just make a small slit in between the strings n with t-shirts I make them into v necks. I also think it makes them look more feminine (on me that is haha),Leelee Cee,2021-01-02T17:43:46Z,0

"Dry shampoo must !!!!! Before you’re doing your makeup spray your dry shampoo into your hair, AND LEAVE IT !! Don’t blend it in or brush it out. Let it sit and soak up the oils. Once you’re done with your makeup THEN go in and blend that out. If you find there to be a cast or hard to blend area hit it with a blow dryer for like a minute it’ll take that away! Works SOOO much more effectively than spray and blending it. On every can it says to leave it for 3-5 minutes and we all out here just doing it all wrong!",Cassandra Stockert,2020-12-31T16:46:51Z,0

Oh gosh this is my absolute nightmare. I HATE products in my hair 😫😅 but I love the bun tho 🙌🏼,Nina Pinchy,2020-12-30T20:27:47Z,2
OMG thank you for this! I’ve always wondered how you got this look. I feel like like every time that I’ve tried to get my hair like this I always lose the middle part and ends up looking like a regular high bun 😫. Also is it weird that I’ve always felt a little weird trying to buy any edge control products in the store?! I’m Latina with naturally curly hair that’s frizzy and with baby hairs and for some reason I just think that the African American community would think I wouldn’t have the right to buy such products. Am i thinking way to much into this probably! Lol,Bianca LRod,2020-12-30T20:15:10Z,0

"@linda serrano  when I wrote that I thought she didn’t have her wedding yet but then I realized she got legally married already but her official wedding wasn’t planned til January. But nonetheless, let her be married for a while first and enjoy her marriage and honeymoon time lol.<br />A lot of people are quick to suggest someone is or should be pregnant but not realizing the negative effects of such commentary even if it clearly was not of ill will.<br />I know it’s not her case, but in many cases it can be a sensitive subject for some women who cannot have children. So I think it’s best not to even comment on kids until Nicole says herself that she is, or will be or plans to be pregnant.",Melanie,2020-12-30T18:14:54Z,0
