"Love to see an in depth photo vid! A fav app I’ve never heard anyone talk about is called GlobeConverter (I think). It’ll convert basically ANYTHING across all forms of measurement (how many cm’s in a mile, inches in a yard, mL’s in a cup, etc), plus currency, speeds, all the things. Kinda weird &amp; dorky but it is SO USEFUL.",Mary Buck,2019-07-10T05:04:30Z,0
