"Fall back in love with your hair! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23zalahair"">#ZALAHAIR</a>",Charlotte Mitchell,2021-04-13T06:57:17Z,0
"&quot;I can’t stop touching my ZALA extensions!! They’re so incredibly silky but still blend seamlessly with my actual hair!! Will never buy another brand!<br />Shipping is super quick. I also love the fact that each purchase earns you Zala points, which can then be used towards your next purchase (which be warned will happen because the quality is amazing and you’ll get addicted).&quot;",Addison Simmons,2021-04-03T06:53:40Z,0
&quot;After looking everywhere and making some terrible purchases on the internet I stumbled upon Zala Hair. Was so impressed with the professional website and range of natural looking beautiful colours.<br />After receiving my caramel ponytail I jumped back on the website and immediately purchased a halo as well!! The quality is amazing. Finally a product that is exactly what it says it is! And it was beautifully gift boxed with products to maintain its shine and longevity. Now I can have beautiful hair and lots of it ❤️&quot;,Lydia Price,2021-03-30T11:14:31Z,0
"Purchased the Zala Pony for my girlfriends wedding. I used their colour match service, while I was a little skeptical with the colour they advised I ordered anyway, Man I am glad I did, it matched perfectly. I am so excited to wear it. I want to buy all their extensions now!!",Ruby Brooks,2021-03-20T06:00:13Z,0

"Purchased the ZALA seamless 20inch clip in set in the shade <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23613"">#613</a> Beachy Blonde. These extensions are super thick and so soft! Being a hairdresser I have come across many different extensions but these are definitely superior over other brands as they are so thick from root to tip and give you so much hair, making it easy to blend into your natural hair.
