"Ok y’all. So I purchased this. I’m not 100% convinced, but I am still giving it a chance to redeem itself. I have noticed that the applicator sponge sucks in blending the powder, so I apply it with the sponge then finish it off with a big fluffy brush and the results are much smoother; like an air brush effect. <br /><br />I have combination oily skin. I have big pores. Warning, this makes your pores stand out 😰😣😣 but it is great if you want something light to medium coverage and quick and easy to apply.<br /><br />I encourage this for oily skin only because it’ll make you look super dry. But throughout the day, it looked dewy on me. I still wear a setting spray after.<br /><br />I’m going to try wearing it without a primer and see how it works. I’ll be back to update. Lmk about your experience and what you’ve tried :D I’d love some tips and feedback",Lulu Escovar,2019-07-13T06:22:17Z,0

"As much as I want to support mostly cruelty free companies, I will definitely use discernment on where it is best applicable. I bought this wonderful and incredible cream to powder foundation in Y315 and I LOVE it!!! When you’re going to spend more to$25+ for a good foundation, one must sincerely look at more than if it’s made by a company that is cruelty free to me. I have sensitive skin and must do FIRST what is best for me. This amazing foundation is what is best for me this summer.",G Deanne Campbell,2019-07-02T17:24:51Z,0

Do you set a powder foundation &amp; also do you mix with a liquid concealer? I&#39;m baffled?! 😵😯,Miranda Quijada,2019-06-27T03:16:44Z,3
You can use a concealer first and set with translucent powder and then use your powder foundation over it. Its what&#39;s worked best for me in the past. But with pressed mineral powder I dont even use concealer at all.,Leticia Vanderberg,2019-06-30T02:33:55Z,0

Tried this and I&#39;m never going back..it looks like skin and I don&#39;t get oily or have to touch up..The black side of the sponge is to be used for full coverage and the white side is for light coverage..

"I remember at one point, there use to be so many Youtubers doing videos on powder foundations, and I really loved it. Because, I have acne prone skin and I don’t get plenty of breakouts like I’ve got with tons of liquid foundations. So, right now, my main go-to powder foundations are Bare Minerals SPF 15  Loose Mineral Foundation or Maybelline’s 16 HR SuperStay Full<br />Coverage Powder Foundation, and I leave my liquid foundations for use for special ocassions only. So, I’m super happy that you chose to do this video, because right now it is very hot and wearing less makeup wise is definitely I feel the best way to go. <br /><br />The new MUFE powder foundation looks absolutely awesome on you, just like s second skin. It doesn’t look powdery or like it’s drying out your skin in any way at all, it gives this super comfortable, very natural looking finish to your complexion that just makes you look naturally perfect in every way.",Reservechic,2019-06-26T23:42:53Z,1

"I’ve been trying to minimize/shorten my makeup routine lately and this foundation is amazing! I bought it when I saw you recommend it on your IG stories and OMG I love it! I have combination skin and I wore it to a BBQ recently and we were outside in the heat/humidity and it stayed intact! The longer you have it on the better it looks, just sinks into your skin and looks so natural. I do recommend exfoliating your skin before wearing it if you have dry patches. Buy it! You’ll love it 😆",Life with the Hwangs,2019-06-26T23:33:21Z,0

I did like it but it OXIDIZED a shade maybe 2 on me 🤦🏻‍♀️. Have oily skin so I’m sure that must have something to do with it.. Not much matte coverage it did make me shiny AF and needed to blot but did held on for about 6 hrs. Th white side is for less coverage and the black side for maximum coverage FYI,Sorpy 69,2019-06-26T23:20:08Z,1
