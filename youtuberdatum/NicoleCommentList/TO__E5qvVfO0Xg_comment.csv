Been finding myself rewatching your old vlogs in the evening time while I unwind and THIS is by far my all time favorite vlog. The pure bliss &amp; happiness that you &amp; Jeremy have and your guys’ relationship reminds me so much of mine. We’ve been together 10 years and I STILL find myself laughing harder together than we did 10 years ago. Ugh! My heart! I love watching other peoples’ love. 💚💚💚,Tori G.,2020-10-19T00:09:20Z,0

You cannot fly a drone in ANY National Park. You should absolutely communicate to your followers that this is NOT allowed, as you can get stuck with hefty fines if you are caught flying your drone on (most) government lands. Those of us who frequent the parks do so to escape the hustle and bustle and technology of our society. Hearing a drone fly while on a beautiful, remote hike in the wilderness is quite disturbing.",Kirsty Flora,2019-09-19T14:44:03Z,0

Thank you for visiting the Yosemite national park in beautiful California. I hope you had an amazing experience here and were able to bond with the beautiful land mark that it is. I really wish that you could’ve stayed a little longer and maybe I would be able to meet you and show you trials I take every time I hike. Climbing the waterfall is so much fun and worth it when you reach the top. Thank you and I love you @nicole,Esmeralda Guzman,2019-09-19T00:00:17Z,0
