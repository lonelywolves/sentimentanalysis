"Hey Nicole, Wear graphic tees a lot and I’m a bigger girl so when I wear to ask if they shrink it pretty much useless to me, I also wash my graphic tees in cold water but I find that hanging them up after you throw them in the wash helps a lot with shrinkage. Sometimes they’ll get wrinkled because obviously they’re in the wash but once they’re completely dry I will throw them in my dryer on wrinkle release with a fabric softener and that will take out all the wrinkles perfectly fine without it getting smaller.",Jerrica Lang,2019-12-08T08:17:10Z,0

Old Navy men’s section is also a good spot I’ve found for oversized graphics tees.
