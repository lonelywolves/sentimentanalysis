I would love to see you do a vampire look and I don&#39;t mean the played out Vamp look everyone has done. I mean a completely out of the box Vamp look.

"She already did, well kinda, it was a vlog explaining how she took the hair off (cap), then took a 🚿 and she had paint all over still and said it takes days for the skin to be completely clean and there was glitter all over her 🤣 u know lol. It was so long ago, I think she was at the 3 story house. Sooo probably about 5 years ago? Hopefully we can see a new vid about it.",Angelica Magallanes,2020-10-15T06:36:53Z,5
