"Nicole i just commented to say you NEED to try flutterhabit lashes. i just recently started using them and i’m in love, they’re a fake lash that you apply under your natural eyelashes and last up to 7 days. same concept of eyelash extensions but so much cheaper, and you can do it yourself!!",Colby Kennedy,2020-08-07T22:39:32Z,0

"Hello all,<br /><br />Two years ago , i adopted this little fur ball when its owner was about to abandon him at the SPCA, an animal refuge.<br /><br />When I saw him, I fell in love with him despite the fact that he was a stressed, anxious and frightened dog. His former master did not care about him or his health.<br /><br />Today, Koutchi is no longer the same; he is cheerful, affectionate and who day by day knows the real life of a dog, he quickly became a member of our family.<br /><br />In about three weeks, Koutchi will undergo surgery to remove a cyst that keeps growing, but also a scaling followed by extraction of one or more teeth.<br /><br />Veterinary care is not provided and I also know that because of this pandemic, financially, it is not easy; a donation would be welcome, but if you cannot contribute, this is completely understandable.<br /><br />Share with your friends or those around you, I would be very grateful.<br /><br />Koutchi needs you!<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/aider-koutchi?utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer&amp;utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&amp;rcid=2777882dd64a4d478ce10b19fbbf3aaa"">https://www.gofundme.com/f/aider-koutchi?utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer&amp;utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&amp;rcid=2777882dd64a4d478ce10b19fbbf3aaa</a><br /><br />Thank you and i hope you are safe and healthy",G K,2020-08-03T22:33:15Z,0

I experience the same exact things when I lay down at night!! I will have flashbacks of all the times in my life that I&#39;ve embarrassed myself.
