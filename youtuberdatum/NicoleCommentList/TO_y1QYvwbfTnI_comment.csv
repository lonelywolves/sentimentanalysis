I have no idea because I’ve gotten my ears done with the The gun both times I got mine my first piercings when I was three years old at Claire’s and then I got my second ones done when I was 21 years old with the gun so I don’t particularly know how that works because my ears are both healed and they’re perfectly fine and I haven’t had any problems with them since I got them,Aja Reid,2020-06-08T07:55:51Z,0

I don&#39;t own any of those but I really want some. Oh yeah, my QUAD piercings were done with needles, unlike my previous three sets. Since I still have PLENTY of non-iodized sea salt left, I might eventually get more ear piercings. But I&#39;m SCARED to get my ear cartilage pierced.

The experience at a tattoo parlour was much better and the tragus healed without issue. However, they are very hard to change out the jewellery and I don&#39;t have the nails that you do :) I have a flat back earring in the tragus. I love the look of the tragus piercing and now I really want to get a piercing at the top of my ear.",K Stock,2019-03-22T03:01:09Z,0

Your teeth look great!!! And do NOT pop your keloid it’ll grow back even bigger I suffer from keloids and that’s the worse thing you can do. Def continue with the tea tree oil. As for my piercings for some reason my second lobe piercing hurt less but took a lot longer to heal and my third lobe piercing was a lot more painful but healed twice as fast. I’ve had mine for almost 8 years and once the healing is done I switch earrings like nobody’s business 😝,Mrs D,2019-03-17T22:48:02Z,0

"I have double lobes a tragus and a helix. I want a conch and a daith next. The tragus definitely took forever to heal (about 1.5 yrs) but it was worth it to me, it&#39;s my favorite. But the helix was the most painful cause I feel like it&#39;s more exposed. I caught it more often while it was healing. It&#39;s healed now but when I sleep on it wrong it gets so soar still. I&#39;m an all natural noniodized sea salt water and tea tree oil girl when it comes to healing. The stuff in aerosol cans just irritates my skin.",Stefany Flores,2019-03-16T01:50:07Z,0

Keloid can be a serious issue. If your keloid is too raised please see a doctor.  I got a keloid on my helix 5 years after getting it pierced. I didn’t take my one seriously and kept applying tea tree oil but eventually my dad took me to see the doctor where we found out I need to get injected in my keloid to get rid off it. The injection felt uncomfortable but soon after my keloid was almost gone. It is still raised but not as much. So please don’t make the mistake that I made!!!,geekchic367,2019-03-14T10:25:27Z,1

Its been 25+ years!,Chardel F,2019-03-13T23:56:33Z,0

"I have multiple piercings ( 4 earlobes on each ear, daith, tragus, rook, conch, 5 helix) from my experience tea tree oil helps, but the best thing to do from experience is to not touch,change or move your jewelry at all during the healing process. The best thing I&#39;ve found to clean my new piercings with is salt water soaks.....that&#39;s it. I also use a travel pillow at night so I&#39;m not putting pressure on my healing piercings. I use to get the bump all the time because I was twisting my new piercings or changing them before they were completely healed. Once I quit touching or moving them I didn&#39;t get a bump and the heal faster. I also quit using q-tips and just use paper towels.",bettyyoung78,2019-03-13T16:00:43Z,0
The only thing I have to say about piercings is that when it comes to healing everyone is totally different. My piercings have healed amazingly with H2Ocean but I can see where the sea salt can be drying and delay the healing process. I have also used Provon and it’s incredible too. The next time I get pierced I’m definitely trying the NeilMed because I’ve always been curious about it but I’ve barely heard anyone talk about it.

I had my tragus pierced with a gun (was 14 and stupid) it took ages to heal but now I’ve had it done for 10 years and it’s perfect ! It took a while to heal &amp; got infected a lot but I didn’t clean it and look after it &amp; like I said got it done with a gun. I actually had the little bit above it (so like a double tragus?) done about 4 years ago with a needle &amp; I cleaned it properly and it healed in about 3 weeks and I’ve never had an issue ! I’ve had a lot of piercings done with a gun and some with a needle definitely have noticed they heal wayyy quicker when done with a needle &amp; not as painful after!,Becky Kavanagh,2019-03-13T11:51:45Z,0

Keloids are basically scar tissue building on scar tissue. Your skin never stops healing so it’s a raised bump. I never had one (I literally had 20 piercings at one time) and not until I got a skin mole removed did I keloid.

"I know it’s not recommended, but if you can’t get your piercing to heal you can try using peroxide. You run the risk of it drying out your piercing and causing more problems, I wouldn’t recommend it for every one. But for my self personally I have always had to use peroxide. No solutions or soaps have ever worked for me and the 3 piercings I tried to use solutions/ anti bacterial soap all struggled with infection and it took peroxide to heal them up and then my other 5 piercings I went right to peroxide and never had an infection with any of them.",Cristin Sierra,2019-03-13T03:24:43Z,0

That is not the same as a keloid although both look similar. What most people don’t think about is that surgical steel has nickel which most people are allergic to. So at first the jewelry can seem fine but once the ear starts to heal that’s when there is usually problems. Smart choice to change your jewelry. I have 2 tragus piercings, 1 conch, 1 rook, 1 daith, 7 lobes and a nose piercing. I don’t have a helix piercing yet because those are the hardest to heal and stay infected. I’ve had hypertrophic scaring on 6 of them. All of the ones that had surgical steel got irritated. They all went away though.",Tenaya Johnson,2019-03-13T03:17:37Z,0

I’m a body piercer and I just want to tell you that keloids are actually mostly hereditary and usually require medical attention. The “bumps” you experience are actually hypertrophic scarring. 🙂 think of it as just an irritation bump.,Valeri Oliva,2019-03-13T01:57:46Z,126

"Kayla Young the key to getting rid of them is catching them when they first start developing. I usually suggest to my clients aggressively scrubbing them with saline on a q-tip. It’s a very backwards process but I’ve done this to all my clients and it’s always worked. They key is consistency, everyday 3 times a day until it’s gone, sometimes it will bleed and that’s fine. After the shower it’s easier because your skin is softer. WhT happens is it actually gets worse before it’s better and later by layer it gets smaller and flakes off. How long it takes depends on the severity you start with. But you can’t give up, the minute you decide to give it a break they can start again. If it’s uncomfortable when you’re scrubbing then you’re doing it correctly, sitting there petting it isn’t going to do anything. Check me out @ piercings_by_val. 😊",Valeri Oliva,2019-03-19T13:33:18Z,6

"Tea tree oil might be too harsh for some, so another cheap and great remedy is sea salt water. Boil about half a cup of water and half a teaspoon of sea salt. Wet a napkin with the solution and let it sit on the bump for 15-30 minutes. You can do this 2 times a day. I got two bumps on my my tragus piercing one on the inside that went away in three days with the method mentioned above and the one on the outside which was much bigger went away in about a week.

I like the way this looks but it’s not for me. I did my cartilage years and years ago and it never healed.  It looks like it did but any time I slept on it on messed with it in any way it would get so inflamed and painful.  NO THANKS!!! I still have the hole but don’t wear jewelry in it.  I need to sleep peacefully and not worry about that shit.,Jen Niebla-Love,2019-03-13T01:01:29Z,0

"I went to Claire’s to get my second hole done and a couple of days after I had a pinched nerve on my ear from where they pierced it and it was the WORST PAIN I had ever felt. The pain went to my neck and as soon as I took off the earring, I felt so MUCH BETTER!! Never go to Claire’s!",Julianna Nayeli,2019-03-13T00:54:51Z,0
"I was cleaning my piercings and putting tea tree oil while I was watching your video lol, get the trague piercing girl!! It was the easier for me and the less painful, I’ve been dealing with my daith piercing as the healing process is going so slow, also the one on my helix bc why not cartilage piercings takes FOREVER to heal haha. I tried another kind of solution but it was the same brand and it’s not helping that much so I’ll try the one that you mentioned, I also tried the h2o solution and it did nothing to help just got them worse.",annitadelvalle,2019-03-13T00:54:06Z,0

"I was big mad when I had to take my rook piercing out! Mine refused to heal and kept bleeding. Literally got it done in September and finally had enough and took it out last week. My swelling has gone down so much. Sometimes piercings just aren’t meant to be. As for my tragus, I got it done the same day as my rook. The only thing that bothers me is it hurts to wear my traditional iPhone earbuds.",Ashley Childers,2019-03-13T00:50:16Z,0

"I had my Tragus pierced and it did not heal well. Super swollen so I took it out after 6 months or so. I realized that I have a super small tragus. Maybe not for me. I also got both sides of my daith pierced. Those took over a year to heal. And still crust up. Ew. You definitely have a clean well every day. Helix on both sides healed great. Other 3 on each lobe, no problems. Hardest decision is what earrings to get!",mowgli536,2019-03-13T00:42:43Z,0

"Yeah don’t go to Claire’s, I went and got my second hole there and through the healing process I would have to pull my earrings out from inside my earlobe because they would pull half way through my ear and it’s wasn’t fun, so just don’t go to Claire’s It would be so much better to just go to a piercing shop or tattoo shop.",gray w.,2019-03-13T00:31:56Z,0

Love your jewelry 😻🤩 My piercer told me that keloids and inflammation bumps (aka hypertrophic bumps) are often mistaken, bumps can go away with care but keloids take more invasive measures like surgery.

"I’ve had all of my lobe piercings (3) done by guns in mall kiosks but I definitely don’t recommend it!!!! Those people are not trained! I had to get my third ones done twice because the first time, the girl put in earnings for little kids!!! I was so mad and they got infected. So I had to let them heal up before I get it done again. The second time I had an extra long bar put in so it had room to breathe. And they definitely hurt pretty bad. <br /><br />My friend had her Tragus pierced and her body didn’t like it so it eventually pushed it out of her ear. She now has a little crescent moon indent on it and can’t get it redone. <br /><br />I suggest making sure you know how your body will react to the metal of the earrings you choose.",Lydia Griffith,2019-03-12T23:42:09Z,0

"I could not agree more with the piercing gun!! It works but it takes even longer to heal because there is so much blunt force trauma (you can watch refinery 29&#39;s video with Brian Keith Thompson on his piercing videos!) my mom got her nose pierced with a piercing gun twice! One in a hair salon and the second in someone&#39;s basement! I know, shady! But for some reason, no jewlry worked for her until she got a real gold piece and it healed up so fast. I currently have my nose pierced and its been a few months, it just started forming a keloid on my piercing, so I went back to my piercer, and he said I should use a little bit of tea tree oil twice a day for a few weeks!",Anika,2019-03-12T23:02:27Z,0

"100% Healing in the cartilage actually varies for everyone, it can seriously take longer it&#39;s ridiculous-- mine took, I kid you not, 2-3 years 🙃🙃🙃 <br />If I took them out for less than a day they would already start to close. <br /><br />Cartilage piercings are high dang maintenance but still a gem 😜✨",Alexis Lopez,2019-03-12T22:57:41Z,2
"The tragus was probably least painful one I&#39;ve gotten and it also healed the fastest out of all the piercing I have. I put in a different tragus after 6 weeks and it was fine, didn&#39;t hurt or anything. But like you already said, it really differs with every person and with some people it takes a long time to heal and with some it doesn&#39;t - same goes with the pain. <br /><br /><br />I am really curious about your conch piercing: compared to your helixes, how bad was the pain?",BROETx,2019-03-12T22:57:13Z,2
The only thing I’d say is tea tree oil isn’t for everyone. It can be irritating to new piercings and just make your bump worse. I was recommended to soak mine with the spray for 4 minutes and rinse it after. Yay for ear piercing plans though!,Gabriela Vargas,2019-03-12T22:56:52Z,0
