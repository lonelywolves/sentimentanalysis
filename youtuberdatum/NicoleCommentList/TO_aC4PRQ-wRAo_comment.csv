Hunny NOOOO you are so much smarter Nicole. Plastic straws are out. You need to BUY Metal Straws they come with their own cleaner and no more plastic bottles even Aquafina cause those seriously have floating mirco plastic crap that the naked eye can not see gross right and there is millions in a manufactured bottle. METAL all the way or Cardboard boxed water bottles those are the best Plastic is just NO GOOD it takes years upon years to shrink OUR planet needs less PLastic,JessAnne Blackhawk,2019-06-17T21:38:11Z,1

When you drink from a straw don’t purse your lips when you’re drinking from it. That helps prevents wrinkles. I usually just kinda put my teeth on the straw like in biting the straw and literally inhale the drink lol sounds kinda weird I know but I don’t purse my lips when I drink out of a straw,Ashley Galindo,2019-06-07T20:17:49Z,0
