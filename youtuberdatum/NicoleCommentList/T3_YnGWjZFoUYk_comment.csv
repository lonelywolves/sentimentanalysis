My man asks me to get a treat as well whenever we are having a good dinner and I run to the store!! You guys are so cute!! You guys are my inspiration!! My man and I have been together 8 years and haven’t got married and I look up to you guys for doing your own thing and deciding when you guys wanted to do get married or not!! Thank you for everything you do! I love you so much! I have been watching you for 9 years which is crazy to think that I have pretty much grown up with you as my BFFFAD (best friend forever from a distance) since I was 18! 🥰❤️,chantel mos,2021-04-29T01:58:50Z,0

I know it’s your life and everything but as someone whose life got flipped upside down by covid health and personal wise it’s really disheartening because I didn’t get sick because I was irresponsible but because someone else was and they didn’t want to wear a mask when I saw them for 5 min 💔 in any case I hope you and your fam stay safe and healthy,Keren Dela Cruz,2021-04-03T15:23:37Z,1

"Don’t get me wrong I love Nicole and I’ve been a follower for years but how much longer is she really gonna keep up with YouTube. Her videos are lacking quality content and her vlogs are 30-40 minutes of the same thing over and over. Sitting in her house, cleaning, going to target, getting her nails done, getting tattoos/piercings, getting her hair done and the excessive coffee intake. This is why her following has plateaued. I realize she just went through a traumatic life changing event but it’s been like this for yearrrrrrs. These influencers wonder why they have crippling anxiety well there it is. They’re over caffeinated and don’t leave their house.",Danielle Lou,2021-04-01T01:43:49Z,5

"i literally just subscribed like 2 minutes ago lol. crazy i’ve never heard of her before, but her sony zv1 video pulled me in. 🥰",Jessie L,2021-04-13T05:47:28Z,0
I adore her channel but its simply because shes so inconsistent with uploads. Like someone else said in these responses I constantly check to make sure I&#39;m still even subscribed to her,Magnolia Name,2021-04-09T21:33:20Z,2
"@bran yes, but there is a “certain “ beauty youtuber that doesn’t do anything (maybe two videos in the last year cuz she got fat) that has a lot more subs than Nicole....I feel it’s all who are fakin’ it for the camera,and Nicole is authentic all the way!!!",cindi G,2021-04-05T00:25:22Z,0
"@CitoMarie Loredo Like someone else has sad, she probably won’t gain any new following because of the content she does put out versus other bigger youtubers. She isn’t about the views and crazy click bait. Her following now is one she’s had forever that’s happy with this content.",Danielle Lou,2021-04-03T20:51:35Z,3
