Tik Tok has been around for quite some time yet you hardly ever heard about but now all of sudden everybody and their momma on there and everybody wants to mention they got a Tik Tok which is really no different than vine or snapchat or even instagram so I don&#39;t get why people are so into it but then again I never liked or had a vine and I thought snapchat was stupid but had Tik Tok for a short time before it  became all the rave but I haven&#39;t logged in in ages and have no desire too cause its not that interesting anyway the hair turned out cute,lovelyrosebw,2020-02-19T04:59:25Z,0
