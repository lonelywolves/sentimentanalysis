Used to love dove dry shampoo SO MUCH and used it for the last 2.5-3 years UNTIL I found Aussie tussle and hustle dry shampoo about 3-4 months ago and it’s my new fav. It def lasts me way longer and I get more uses out of a bottle than the dove. &amp; it didn’t make my scalp itchy like the dove does.,Mahayla Monk,2020-09-15T04:25:09Z,0
"OMG! I had to wait all this time until the Aussie After Hours Dry Shampoo finally came back in stock. Yes, it adds volume. BUT IT STINKS! Like a cheap hygiene spray!  WTH  didn’t you TELL us that?!?  I won’t trust your reviews again. How much did they pay you to lie? It’s  DISGUSTING!",Marge Burkell,2020-09-09T22:15:35Z,0
