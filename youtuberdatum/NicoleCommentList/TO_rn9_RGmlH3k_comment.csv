What you went through sounds like an episode of sex and the city when the girls are at a wedding in a corner while the bride is about to through the bouquet. The bouquet goes flying and hits Miranda in the head and she’s like okay I’m out y’all. She can’t be bothered with that mess lol.,Liza Franco,2019-04-29T21:21:47Z,0

"Niicccolllleeeee 💕<br />I get instantly excited when you post.  You were the first EVER youtuber that I started watching and I never ever get tired of your videos , blogs,  etc. And girlllll when I saw that you caught the bouquet I was like woooaahh 😯 . Yay! 🤗🤗🤗😅<br />Best of wishes to you and Jeremy. Also , he should have his own cooking YouTube thingy. I love when you include him in your blogs. <br />You also asked if we wear foundation over our eyes. . Uh I do usually but lately I&#39;ve been into adding elf&#39;s eyeshadow primer instead. <br /><br />I&#39;m most excited to try the <br />1. MILk primer .. I saw your previous video and you raved about it so I really want to try it. Plus I&#39;ve never purchased a high end primer. Yup. Never. I use the h20 hydrating primer which is ok I guess , not sure because I&#39;ve never compared it to anything but I&#39;d love for you to try and tell us what you think. Costs $6 , I&#39;ve never found it at the drugstore, I usually get it at a makeup store by my school <br /><br />2. Nars orgasm blush . I&#39;ve heard other good things about it and I&#39;ve never bought a high end blush. I&#39;ve used Milani and now currently using an elf one that I love. <br /><br />3. Urban Decay all nighter setting spray.... I work a 9-5 job and I think this will definitely keep my makeup in tact. I currently use the NYX dewy spray but not sure if that&#39;s an actual setting spray ? Plus I live in California and it&#39;s hot so yup I think this product is for me <br /><br />Anyways . Love ya . Will be keeping an eye our for your next video 😘",Cristina Barrientos,2019-04-23T04:30:57Z,0

"Hello Nic, I missed your videos! I am very interested in the Milk Hydro grip primer. You had mentioned it in your last video and I have been having such a hard time wearing makeup now. Over the winter time, I have suffered with very dry skin and wearing makeup is my life and I have not been having any luck trying to find a hydrating, moisturizing makeup routine. I feel like I have tried everything and nothing works.<br />When you talked about the Milk primer, I honestly went to Sephora site and added it to my wish list to get along with the Summer Friday one you mentioned too. I would love to try any one of these in hopes that it will help me with doing my makeup now and keeping my face snatched all day and hydrated! XOXOX",queenbina1206,2019-04-22T22:52:03Z,0

My Sephora INSIDE JCpenny is the only close Sephora to me too and they’re starting to revamp it too and I love it 🥰 IM SUPER SUPER excited to possibly try the MILK gripping primer so so many people have been talking to me about it and I have always dreamed of trying that very popular Sisley double tensor primer And obviously I would never have the money to be able to and I heard that this is very much like it so I am super excited to possibly try that particular product because I am in great need dire need of an awesome primer that will just grip onto the make up and stay all day long because I’m a server and waitress at a restaurant and my make up needs to stay on from morning until night and That’s why I was so so super excited about this video because I automatically thought about work and how my make up has not been staying on lately 😞😳 and how I would love ❤️ it to for the spring &amp; summer if my makeup would keep looking good at work and not having my make up melt off my face while I’m greeting a table 😞lol that is so key 🔑 anyways thank you Nicol  for being you and real as always you are awesome have been watching you for at least two years always am so excited 😆 when I see you’ve uploaded 💕 and will continue to forever!,Brittney Frederick,2019-04-22T21:12:58Z,0

I ended up with cat hair ALL over my brushes and I didn&#39;t even realize it until it was too late.  I had SO much fur stuck to my face.

I love this look 😍💖<br /><br />And wow that Milk primer sounds amazing! 😯<br />I recently got engaged so now I’m on the hunt to find some holy grail products to hold up for my future wedding! Also I live in Texas so I get oily really fast and it can be hard to find products to last on my skin. <br />So that would be the product I’d be the most excited to try 😁,ayeemanda11,2019-04-22T20:27:23Z,0
