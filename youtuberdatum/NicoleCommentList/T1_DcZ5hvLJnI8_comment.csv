"Everyone saying it better make their hair “pin strait” but she SAID she wanted the blown out look, not pin strait. So it doesn’t mean you can’t get that look. And yes it’s pricy, but the amount of research they did when creating this is what brings it to that price. If you are cutting out time, making the plates adapt to your hair, making it cordless, and doing your research on what the material is of the plates to support less hair damage, then it makes sense.  If you look at other reviews, they go into more depth as to what the research results were. No shade on Nicole, I think she did a beautiful job, but I know other youtubers have done more in depth reviews if that is what you are looking for. A straightener STRAIGHTENS hair. It doesn’t vacuum your house or pay your bills. If you are looking for something to pay your bills, then you probably shouldn’t be looking at purchasing a straightener to begin with. <br /><br />Thank you Nicole for doing this review. It was super helpful! This helped a lot of us determine if we want to purchase it or not before we spent the big bucks to get it! ❤️",Lauren Scaletti,2020-05-07T22:31:53Z,3

I feel like dyson really dropped the ball on this one. Their blow dryers I can kinda understand the price for their features but this guy doesn’t even straighten as well as many wayyyy cheaper straighteners. I’ll be sticking to my trusty bio ionic one pass that I’ve had since I was 19.,T Luz,2020-05-07T20:16:34Z,19

Some sneaky editing on this. You could tell this was a sponsorship because the editing cut away a split second before each first pass of the hair. (Probably because it was still wavy and needed a second or third pass) Tells me this doesn’t work as good as one would expect for the price.,Katy DJ,2020-05-07T19:43:40Z,74

It would&#39;ve been nice to see it curl rather than straighten. I&#39;ve seen other reviews showing it does not work well to curl. Was hoping to see that it does curl. Decided I&#39;m not going to buy this. My straightener seems to work the same as this but I would maybe purchase if it did curl well. You always look beautiful 😊,arletteross,2020-05-07T19:31:38Z,1
Uhmmm for that price I would think it would leave your hair more sleek and shiny. I couldn’t afford it anyways.,Carol Montoya,2020-05-07T19:27:37Z,1
"I don’t think it makes it the straightest I’ve seen, but I think it makes it a pretty straight, more of a  “naturally” straight kinda vibe. I do think it makes it very shiny tho &amp; I think the technology is cool, especially how the plates flex to move with the hair.  I’ll wait to see if they bring this back out with a longer battery life - 30 minutes isn’t enough time for a lot of people to do their whole head! 143 xx ❤️",Annamariexo,2020-05-07T19:25:40Z,2
$500 for a 30 minute charge and long hair don&#39;t mix. Spend $300 less and get a iron that will straighten your hair and it won&#39;t take you half an afternoon to do it.,Pretty Accountant,2020-05-07T19:20:54Z,4
What a waste of money. Seriously the flat iron doesn’t need to be redesigned . All that money because it’s cordless? Your hair doesn’t even look better than when you straighten it with a ny other iron.,Shark teal Jam sessions,2020-05-07T19:20:09Z,36
"You&#39;re beutiful so anything looks good on you! I think using a comb and smaller sections would make it straighter , but I do like my hair pin straight as my hair is naturally really curly  (puertorican) .  For each their own. I wouldn&#39;t pay past $80 for a hair tool tho 🤣",j&k,2020-05-07T19:20:00Z,2
Yeah I would never waste my money on that. A good flat iron will remove any kinks or frizz within the first application.,sarah fur,2020-05-07T19:16:47Z,39
Its not that &quot;straight&quot; I think my 50 dollar target straightener does better no hate just to pricy,Angie Rodriguez,2020-05-07T19:15:30Z,73
"Idk if her technique was bad or if that straightener is just horrible, the hair doesn’t look sleek,smooth or straight, you can see crimp like creases,also 30 minutes of cordless time is not long enough to straighten my thick hair... definitely not worth the $500",Stephhh Leeezie,2020-05-07T19:13:28Z,183
Watch the Kathleen lights one.,Harley Quinn,2020-05-08T14:50:22Z,1
"Stephhh Leeezie I was thinking the same thing. I feel like it might be the straightener because I’ve seen her do her hair hang times and she has great technique when working her hair. I have a 50$ straightener I bought at Winners years ago and I can get pin straight hair with a pass, maybe two. Wouldn’t pay $500 for one.",Michelle L.,2020-05-08T02:07:34Z,4

I’ve noticed that this iron doesn’t get that hair that straight or smooth.  For that price I need my hair to be stickkkkkk straight and glossy. I have the Dyson blow dryer and I LOVE it. It sucks that this iron is blah,Estrellitawilliams,2020-05-07T19:12:00Z,108
Dyson Products are overpriced for no reason at all. I’ll stick with my Ion Titanium plated straightener. Works like a charm.,Shaunee Kori,2020-05-07T19:11:31Z,41
I love the straight on you but considering that you do have a little bit of a natural wave pattern have you ever considered trying out the curly girl method on your hair? It might be something fun and different to try if you’re bored!,Monique Lee,2020-05-07T19:10:45Z,1
"Monique Lee are you talking about the no-washing-with-shampoo method? Girl, my hair is wavy and super thick and to my butt and all that method did for me is make my hair even greasier than it naturally is 🤪",C B,2020-05-07T19:19:58Z,0
