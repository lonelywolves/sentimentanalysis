"@Totally Random Then what are you doing on this video if you don&#39;t follow influencers? Just trolling around, being negative and mean for no reason. Stop taking an excuse to explain why you&#39;re mean out of nowhere to someone who hasn&#39;t done anything to you.",itshmrk,2020-03-25T10:41:51Z,0
"@Totally Random excuse you... believe me if you have extensions, you can&#39;t wear them down 24/7. extensions STILL get dirty and you can throw them up in a bun because YOU ARE ALLOWED TO DO SO once in a while BECAUSE YOU WANT TO. Plus, didn&#39;t she mention that it was her &quot;staying at home&quot; hairstyle? If she wants her hair out of her face and &quot;hide&quot; her extensions, she is allowed to do so. Please stop adding to the negativity of this world, thank you.",Karina L,2020-03-24T16:06:08Z,2
"itshmrk I don’t follow them because I don’t appreciate how they influence young girls into thinking MORE IS BETTER. So, that’s what’s wrong with me....It ruins young women’s self image to try and compare oneself with these images. So yeah sorry if I run deeper.",Totally Random,2020-03-24T15:16:53Z,1
"@Totally Random Wtf is wrong with you. Why would comment something so negative out of nowhere? If you don&#39;t enjoy the way influencers live, why do you follow them?",itshmrk,2020-03-24T15:05:26Z,8
Plus it’s ironic to pay for and sit  and wait or all that hair to be added only to want to twist it tightly up unseen basically. It would stink to be an influencer because apparently they MUST add hair extensions as part of their job requirement. Thank god to have a job you needn’t conform not to mention ruin your REAL hair.,Totally Random,2020-03-24T10:59:14Z,3

You can wear in a Sleek ponytail  u dont   have to put it up in a bun and if you want your hair down just do a Sleek middle part and tuck it perfectly behind both ears that&#39;s the one I do almost every day with big silver hoop earrings to finish the look,jamba jackson,2020-03-25T14:36:57Z,0
