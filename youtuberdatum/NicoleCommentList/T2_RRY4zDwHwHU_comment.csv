Omg the first time I got that, I didn’t realize it was the concentrate cause I always get the one in the plastic bottle that’s pre made for iced coffee, and I filled my cup just like you, added a splash of cream, and drank it normal. Within 10 min I was so sick, throwing up, pain I never felt before, I ended up in the ER with a caffeine overdose. A legit overdose! That shit is no joke. And I drink a pot or 2 daily of columbian coffee so I’m no coffee stranger. The glass bottle one is supposed to be diluted with water or way more milk than that.

Yes love your long vlogs! Uhmmm curious to know what you clean your cloth masks with. Regular detergent? Because I literally have to wash mine every few days with the amount of makeup I wear each day. 🖤,gennah wiley,2020-08-23T23:57:18Z,0
Nicole! I work at an ENT office and you should definitely get allergy tested and possibly get allergy injections which will help build immunity to what you’re allergic too. And it seems like maybe you’re allergic to your cats and possibly other things. Definitely check it out. Love you ❤️😘,Amber J Coronado,2020-08-23T23:56:03Z,0
