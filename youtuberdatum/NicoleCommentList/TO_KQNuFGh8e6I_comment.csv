"When you were telling the story about your grandma, It reminded me of when my grandmother passed, Even after 12 years for my grandmother&#39;s anniversary date there are times where I feel that she is either next to me or this time I felt her lay in my bed, and my mother felt that someone grabbed her feet while she was sleeping, and also their are times where our door opens and a breeze of cold air comes through the home. What we do is that we pray that our loved ones soul is able to rest in peace and let them know that we can handle whatever it is down here on the earth. I have heard that sometimes our loved ones souls stay on earth because they feel that they still have something that they need to handle.. That is just what i have heard from my grandmother.  hope this helps! love you!",Nathalie Mora,2019-02-03T01:00:01Z,0

As much as I&#39;d like to say that was your grandmother...I dont think it was. I&#39;ve had some experience with some spirts and with the cross swinging like that...it doesnt sound like a friendly kind.

"I am so late to this video. However, I don’t believe in “ghosts” per say but I do believe in lost souls. I believe we have to be very careful with what type of energies we invite into our homes though; music, movies, people, objects, etc. I believe we invite these things into our lives without even meaning to and evil can be deceiving. Sometimes wickedness tries to trick us into thinking these things are coming from things or someone we love but in reality it’s nothing like that at all. These experiences can be an attack and for that I read Psalm 91 out loud while I walk through my home.",Crystal Galindo,2019-01-18T02:05:01Z,0

"GIRL, I don’t want to come off preachy but for real, PRAY OVER YOUR HOUSE! 🙏🏼 If you believe in Jesus, pray over your house in his name. God will remove all evil from your home and life if you allow Him to. Just ask him into your heart. <br />ABC IT GIRL!  I promise it may sound a little weird at first but it was the best choice I’ve ever made. <br />A - Admit that you’re a sinner (we all are) and that you need God in your heart. <br />B. Believe in Him and have faith. Believe that Jesus Christ was sent to die for our sins and payed the ultimate price for us. <br />C. Choose to follow Him (God) and choose to start reading your word the Bible and choose to start going to church. ❤️ <br /><br />Lastly I don’t know too much about crystals so I can’t speak very much on it but I do know that anything that takes away from the power of God can’t be good...  the only positive vibes the only good energy the only uplifting power  that you need is in Him. ❤️ <br /><br /> With that said I love your channel. <br /> I don’t even know if you’ll ever get a chance to read this but you’re my favorite YouTuber, since day one 7 1/2 years ago when I started watching you I love your vlogs, I love your make up videos and I think you’re super awesome!",Vanessa Irizarry,2019-01-15T19:54:23Z,0

"Telling ghosts its YOUR house and to please leave is usually pretty good. But id cleanse with sage, with a window open so the negative energy can leave. Then fill the house with happy, loving energy. My house was haunted too. I never saw a black shadow, but i did see a white mist. Every night for a few weeks. And i was always on edge and horrified.

"I’m a firm believer in spirits, I’ve had my run ins with spirits and not so nice spirits. I used to live in a home that had a spirit who made it known that I wasn’t welcome, it would knock 3 times through out the house it would knock pictures off my wall it made balls roll by themselves it would slam doors and it would watch me while I slept. Demons will always touch the floor. The spirit realm is 3 feet higher than ours that’s why spirits look like they’re “floating” DO NOT contact this spirit if you truly feel it’s not her it’s because it’s not, you’d know if it was because she wouldn’t make you feel scared like you were yes you’d be spooked but it’s different. You did good by telling whatever it was to leave if you feel worried or scared don’t be afraid to walk through your house saying the Lord’s Prayer you let it know that you’re protected by god and they can’t touch you or harm you. Call on god if you’re scared and he will be there.",Bee,2019-01-10T17:51:07Z,0
"Nicole, you&#39;ve given demonic entities permission to be there.... you&#39;ve invited them (unintentionally of course) by using crystals and any other occult activities. Also, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve signed any fame and fortune contracts.. they are dangerous and satanic and that&#39;d be another opening for demonic activity. Demons​ are masters at deception and they want you to believe it&#39;s your Nan but it&#39;s not. Your Nan is slumbering peacefully until the resurrection and judgement. Yahuah&#39;s​ word is full of warnings about these things and He warns us out of LOVE and that&#39;s where I&#39;m coming from too.<br />Our loved ones do not stay and hang around but they do sleep until the resurrection and judgement. It is not your grandma.<br />Please get a Bible and read and ask Yahuah our creator to reveal truth to you. He loves you and doesn&#39;t want you to experience demonic activity but we all need <br />to trust Him and His warnings about the occult and witchcraft etc and we need to stay away from those things. I&#39;m praying for you. 💗💜",Erin M,2019-01-10T17:23:44Z,0

"I strongly suggest you see a psychologist to help you get through your Grandmother&#39;s passing.  Hopefully they could help you be stronger.  The fear that you show heightens the evil sprits doing.  They like it when you show fear they at up even more.  A good way to cleans the house is by burning white sage and praying.  Pray for the Lord Jesus Chris to cleans your home.  Also pray for him to protect you and surround you with his divine white light.  Prayer is power!  You must believe.  The more you  deny him the more the evil spirits will bother you and feed off of you.  May the Lord Jesus be with you, open your eyes and heart and surround you with pure blessings...",belen ortiz,2019-01-10T04:20:01Z,0

So we bought our house a year ago and I was seeing a dark shadow in the hallway without telling my family. So then a few days later my husband said he saw a 7 ft  silhouette shadow come out of the hallway and vanished into our kitchen. I said Oh Hell NO!!!!! I bought some SAGE and smudge my house every night for an entire week and then every other week and now once a month. It&#39;s gone we don&#39;t see or hear anything anymore. So in order to free them spirits I highly suggest to get some Sage and smudge your home.,G Harris,2019-01-10T00:54:52Z,0

"Have you thought about smudging your house? You can even use a white candle if you do not like smudging. Say a prayer into the candle (or your intentions if you are not religious), asking Jesus (or whoever you believe in) to help guide the soul home or to where they are meant to go.

"My dad died in the hospital in the morning (6/15/2010), and that night I went to bed in my old childhood bedroom. The hospital is 2 blocks away up the street. That night I heard footsteps come up the stairs, and I heard the floorboard creak outside my door as if someone was there looking in on me. It completely freaked me out even though it was just my dad! I kept my eyes closed and thought &quot;nope nope nope nope&quot;. The next morning his alarm went off for him to go to work. It&#39;s the kind you have to set every night before bed. I inherited his car, and the next night the keys jostled next to me on the bed. I asked him to stop it because he was freaking me out, and I haven&#39;t had a visit like that since. He visits in my dreams every once in a while now.",Dolores Gonzalez,2019-01-09T00:50:14Z,0

I don’t know if your a believer but if you are get a bible and rebuke the bad energy in the name of Jesus. The black shadow isn’t your Nam.

My husband and I have always felt like a ghost has lived with  us. When we moved into our first home we had a birthday party for our daughter and she had a helium balloon that was tied to the door in the front living room. I was in bed that night and had a strange feeling of movement in the house and looked out the bedroom door and then saw the balloon floating through the house and right towards me. I grabbed it and popped it. Then in our next two homes we would would have lights turn on and off and find things had moved from where we had put them.  After we moved into our current home we started to have more with the lights but the truly strange stuff was that we would hear our grandson’s toy playing in his room when no one was in there. One of his toy card would always be making noise and lighting up. It creeped my husband out so much that he took the car out to the garage. Then my grandson heard of this game called  “Charlie Charlie” where you make  four squares on a piece of paper with yes in two diagonal squares and no in the other two. Then you place a pencil straight in the center and the balance another one on top of it facing the other way. Once you have it set up you say “Charlie Charlie” and ask a question and wait to see if the top pencil moves. We asked if there was a ghost in our home and it moved to yes then we asked if the ghost was a child and it answered yes again. We no longer play that game!,Lynn Picklo,2019-01-08T06:59:46Z,0

"I think it&#39;s your Nan, cause I was told only those who have previously possessed items can touch them. If that cross was only your nans, then it&#39;s her. But it could also be anyone else who has owned that specific cross before her. The spirit knows your house, so it will have to have been someone who has been there before. If she has, then it&#39;s her.<br />I have ghost experiences so often it&#39;s amazing. I used to have a spirit that would stand at the end of my bed when I was upset as a teenager. Haven&#39;t seen him in years.<br />We often see a ginger cat (our ginger boy died just over 4 years ago) walk through our house sometimes or feel him rub against our legs and it&#39;s not any of our current cats cause they&#39;re usually outside when it happens.<br />I live for ghost stories and I love encounters with them.

"Weird that your ghost thing happened in a bathroom because something similar happened to my mom! She was on the plane to China when my grandpa passed, so they didn&#39;t get to say their goodbyes. A few days after she landed, she&#39;s at the house in the bathroom doing bathroom things. The bathroom door is fogged glass so you can see some shapes through it, and the toilet is directly facing it. As she&#39;s doing bathroom things on the toilet, she sees a shadow shuffle past the glass door. My grandpa had a very unique walk and would shuffle everywhere, so my mom instantly recognized that it was his figure just shufflin&#39; on by. It wasn&#39;t a scary moment for her, but weird that it was also in a bathroom!",Rachel Li,2019-01-08T01:19:09Z,0

It’s a demon. Your messing with crystals is inviting entities into your home. Be careful who you invite into your home because there are some demons that will never leave no matter how many cleansing ceremonies you perform they will stay dormant and appear during hard times to taunt you. Demons appear as a familiar face. They will take form as something familiar to gain your confidence.,Jenn Bunny,2019-01-08T00:55:16Z,0

Something similar happened to me when I was at work and I work in a house and I was sitting on the couch and something made me look down the hall and as I did I saw a black shadow go from one room to the babies room I thought I was seeing things but I went down the ball and just felt like a bad vibe being in the room so I started talking to it too (weeks later) and it never happened again but after seeing the shadow I would hear random noises and stuff would move...

The same thing happened to me recently. I was on my couch watching YouTube on my phone and saw a dark shadow cross in front of me and I know i’m not crazy because my dog and my cat saw it too. They both looked up from laying down. I don’t think it was my momma or my grandma but at the same time it didn’t scare me. I just was like “oh heyyy... 👀” The fact that yours frightened you probably means you don’t know them. Which is weird but better because like you said you don’t want your Nan hanging around here. She should be home. 😌 I feel the same way about mine. But☝🏻 she’ll always protect you regardless 😇! <br /><br />143 😘,Sara Stewart,2019-01-07T23:53:52Z,0

Don’t talk to a black shadow.. black shadow are not good only white shadows are angels buy a guardian angel cancel and light it up where you seen the shadow and if the candle turns off while on do not turn it back on throw it away but if stays on and the glass turns black then it grab the bad spirit of the black shadow.,Brenda Liz,2019-01-07T19:50:50Z,1

"I have a ghost story my sister one morning was going to have a nurse go to the house. So my sister was in her room and she thought she heard a knock but she wasn&#39;t sure so maybe a minute later she hears another knock and she goes to open the door and it was the nurse. The nurse then asks my sister if anyone else lives there and my sister told her she lives with her husband and her parents and her 2 brothers. The nurse then said that she had just knocked and a guy told her that the person she was looking for didn&#39;t live there or that she had the wrong house (i can&#39;t remember what my sister said that the nurse told her). So then the nurse walked out (my moms house has like a little hallway to get to the front door) so the nurse walked out and sees the number of the house and sees its the right number, its the right address so she goes back and knocks again that&#39;s when my sister opened the door. My sister said it must of been one of my brothers. Now this is the crazy part out of all the guys that live there my brother was the only one home and he swears he didn&#39;t open the door, he was asleep. So the real question is who the fuck did the nurse talk to??? Its scary to think about but we aren&#39;t that surprised almost my whole family has seen a man in the house and its always by the stairs. I have so many other stories, from my family about seeing things in the house. And another weird thing that so many people fall on the stairs, my mom has fallen multiple times and 1 time she broke her leg! We think there&#39;s some kind of connection between the stairs area and the man seen there. I lived in that house for 4 years and never saw anything, my husband and i were going to stay at my moms for a couple of weeks after i had my baby and my husband saw a shadow by the top of the stairs, it really scared him he wanted to leave the next day. But the encounter the nurse had tops them all. Its crazy to think that you go about your day and you never think that some of the people you see walking around might not be apart of this world anymore... Just something to think about??",SanJuana_s.s.d.v,2019-01-07T13:18:57Z,0

"I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re religious or not, but I&#39;ll pass on the information I know as a Pentecostal Christian anyways, when people pass away they&#39;re basically &quot;sleeping&quot; until judgement. Any entity that&#39;s lurking trying to convince you it&#39;s someone that&#39;s deceased is a demon. Check your house and see if you brought anything in that may be helping manifest them. People don&#39;t realize this but things like astrology, crystals, etc bring in things to your home that you don&#39;t want being there. Look into new age/the occult testimonies (many of them here on youtube), they&#39;re really insightful. God bless you sweety, hopefuly this helps💓",Mondays With Sharon,2019-01-07T12:21:10Z,0

"Things happen to me in the bathroom as well. 4 years ago, I moved in with my boyfriend. It was a normal day and I went in the shower and when I got out I looked in the mirror and there was the freshest smiley face ever. Like it literally looked like someone did it just that second. When you write on a steamy mirror the next day it shows up but not the same, it’s barely visible. This looked like it was JUST done!everyone kept telling me that oh maybe someone wrote on it the day before. But hell no! Fast forward 4 years it happens again. I was working early morning for a week and I was in the shower again like around 5:50am. I get out and I see a circle and what looked like initials. There were two perfect B’s. I still have a picture of the smiley face as well. <br /><br /><br />Also I would hear light switches go on and off and chairs moving around in the middle of the night.",Victoria Gomez,2019-01-07T12:12:45Z,0

"Its demons in your house.   You need to ask Jesus Christ to be the Lord of your life and protect you,  I knew when you were into all that crystal stuff bad things would come from it because crystals channel demonic spirits because they are of the occult not God.  Remember satan deceives as an angel of light (2 Cor <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQNuFGh8e6I&amp;t=11m14s"">11:14</a>) , all that new age stuff seems harmless but its actually really evil and an abomination to God and opens up the door to satan and demons to enter your life.   You can&#39;t fight this without asking Jesus Christ to come into your life and protect you, he destroyed all demons power at the cross and chuck out any crystals, or false god idols, any new age books etc out of your home.  You have something in your house thats opening up the door to satan.  Jesus is greater than any evil spirit.  You need Jesus Christ now Nic, don&#39;t delay or things will get worse.  Romans 10:9 9 If you declare with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is LORD,&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. :)",CamsArtisticJourney,2019-01-07T11:01:24Z,31

"@Alana Sheeran Hope this helps: It orginates with shamans (witch doctors) who would utilize stones as a method of both diagnosis and treatment; the crystal is believed to be a vehicle through which the healing nature spirits (demons) work. The New Age occult belief is that the crystals attract negative energy from the wearer or channel good energy to them. <br />While there&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with crystals by themselves, there is something wrong when it is used for healing or as a charm to keep you from harm. This is a practice that calls upon powers (other than God} to heal or give good luck, or protect. These powers (spirits) are NOT from God. People put their hope in a crystal to heal them, or even the &quot;crystal healer&quot;, who &quot;channel&quot; and rely on the crystals to teach and heal. Unfortunately, they are relying on other spiritual sources for the healing.  They are seeking help from spirits outside of Gods kingdom which is idolatory. (Putting your faith, belief and trust in anything other than God) Ultimately, this is considered an occult practice, which God clearly tells us to stay away from. People are unknowingly seeking satans kingdom for guideance and protection. God doesn&#39;t want us to participate with these practices because it draws us away from Him and we begin to trust in spiritual sources (demons) other than Him.  At its core, crystal healing is a form of mysticism, witchcraft, and occult practices.  By having items in your house that channel &#39;other&#39; spirits for help your giving satan and demons free range into your home to torment  and harass you, because you have shown them that you don&#39;t want Gods help or protection.   The only true power comes from God through Jesus Christ.",CamsArtisticJourney,2019-01-21T10:32:55Z,1
"@Muñeca thank you for taking your time to reply, I own Crystal&#39;s I think they&#39;re beautiful I own a salt lamp it give my home a good feeling and it just seemed odd to me that something created by nature could be evil but now I have more of an understanding that in the wrong hands they can be used for such things",Alana Sheeran,2019-01-21T00:37:48Z,1
"@Alana Sheeran yes crystals are natural just like the sun, moon, trees and plants which God created because God created science and God is the creator of all things. It is insulting to God when people worship these things or use them to channel spirits/demons for power or knowledge instead of just praying to God directly who is the almighty. Now crystals are minerals made up of atoms, molecules, or ions that are capable of receiving, storing, transmitting or amplifying vibrational energy just like a crystal ball 🔮 which is used for necromancy (witchcraft). Crystals can be used for crystal ball readings, scrying, spell casting and invoking demons. Crystals itself are not evil or harmful but the way witches use them for magic to channel energy is. Crystals are also used in technology like LCD (liquid crystal display) for screen monitors (black mirrors) like televisions, computer monitors, smart phones, tablets which is a form of sorcery. Crystals are special because of the way they transmit energy and it is important to educate ourselves so we don&#39;t let these bad energies/spirits into our lives. I hope I answered your question. I am not a scientist but at least I tried my best. God bless",Muñeca,2019-01-21T00:11:59Z,1

"When my Nana passed last December, so many crazy paranormal things happened like almost immediately. Things nobody would’ve known. I knew it had to have been here. I miss those things happening. Now, my dad is terminally ill, and the doctors have given him a few weeks to live and idk. It scares me to think of any paranormal events happening after he has passed on. Idk what makes the two different. They just are.

Go to sleep with a butterknife underneath your pillow and if you have one of those tiny pen-knife things keep it on you at all times. I know it sounds weird but it will keep “bad” spirits away.,Sharon,2019-01-07T07:20:15Z,0
"My grandfather passed away in October really unexpectedly. The only “sign” I really had of him was a white butterfly in the garden the day after his final ceremonies took place until this tuesday on the 1st . @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQNuFGh8e6I&amp;t=3m44s"">3:44</a> in the morning i woke up to a shadow like figure right at my bedroom door. I looked at it and I know he looked at me and then it went towards the window. At no time during this sighting did i feel scared. I even turned my phone’s light on and nothing was there. I went back to sleep. As i think about it now i get chills but i feel like it might have been him because I was not scared as it was happening. Usually im terrified of things like this but ever since he passed away the fear had stopped, now im kind of scared again, but im almost certain it was him.",Sharon,2019-01-07T07:17:07Z,0

"Konstadina Dafni yes, to be honest I’m very spiritually sensitive and ever since then I check back on this channel, but I always get a bad vibe. I hope she works it out some how. It has a dark feeling. I’m one of those people if you take me in to a house or any building I get a good or bad feeling. Don’t even know the reason why, I just feel it. I always live in newer homes or apartments. I can always feel people’s left over energy. If I have to go in to old buildings for anything I always feel kind of sick. I feel like older places have had sooo many things happen in them it’s hard to clear it all out. <br />Ha ha well that got deep, anyway yes.<br />😊",S C,2019-01-09T11:39:51Z,1

"I have a ghost too, I think its the woman that lived in this apartment before me. I kid you not for almost a week someone  sat down on the corner of my bed. I kept making excuses for it..but them one night when I going to bed, I was still wide awake, a hard pointed finger tapped me very hard on the back of my shoulder. I knew it was my visitor. I knew not to act afraid. &quot;I said, What do you want, there is room for both of us..it was your place first anyhow. I see her shadow walk out of the kitchen thru the apartment..my boyfriend had seen a shadow walk by a few  times, I live alone only twice she was angry..she briefly showed her very angry face..I said we gotta be nice living together, that scared me a few days, well it still does months later.. If ever I questioned if there were really ghost among us, I don&#39;t anymore ever since when over 2 years ago I was tapped on the shoulder, there is no denying that or trying to reason this away. she basically is quiet.  Have you thought to cleanse your crystal to make sure no negative energy is trapped there when you last bought any? <a href=""http://yes.th/"">Yes.th</a> e necklace was something..did your Nan stand in your bathroom talking with you before she passed.

I think if it was your Nan you would’ve known it was her...felt that it was her. But maybe someone you guys knew that was trying to tell you that your Nan was okay. That’s what I got from your explanation. I completely believe in spirits...we used to live in a house that all kinds of freaky things would happen. When my nephew was 3 he would say he was tired because the girl in the wall would keep him up because she wanted to play...my dad set up a camera and everything but never caught anything.,sandra gunnarsdottir,2019-01-07T06:14:05Z,0

"Talk through def. makes it feel more like we’re hanging out. The vibe is like you’re in my house and we’re getting ready together 💛 as much as I wanna say I don’t believe, too many things have happened to where I can’t ignore there’s another realm outside our own.

Other times I just ask them to leave. Lol",Claudia Rios,2019-01-07T05:55:42Z,0
To give some reason to my “vent” comment. My cousin passed away last year and since he’s been gone in multiple occasions we’ve felt HIS presence. Things he used to do or have have happened. Literally back to back.

"my mum is very spiritual and thanks to her i have been very in tune with the spiritual world and spirituality in general since i was young. My mum always taught me that no spirit there with evil intentions, or bad energy. She told me spirits are positive and will find themselves gravitating towards places they feel they are welcome. I definitely think it was Nan popping in to say hello :)",Carlee Dodds,2019-01-07T04:55:56Z,0
"Draw close to God and he will draw close to you..the Ghosts you see/feel are not your nan, but rather evil spirits who want to draw you in and separate you from God’s love- believe me! Read the Bible daily and pray and whenever you experience that again, call out to God by using his name Jehovah (Psalms 83:18) as many times as needed and the spirits will flee...",Helen T-Acosta,2019-01-07T04:55:45Z,0

"I don&#39;t know if you will see this, BUT! Haha pay attention to how your cats act around these encounters, cats can sense and see when there is a spirit/ghost or entity around, they will avoid certain rooms the encounters in, they will hiss and strike out, they will be scared, act different and wont be able to settle. Cats are the best at sensing things that we can not.

"A lot of people believe that when we die or when someone dies our spirit leaves us and we either go to heaven or hell or even reincarnation. But if you have your own bible at home and open it up to Ecclesiastes 9:5 “ for the living know they will die, but the dead know nothing at all , nor do they have any reward, because all memory of them is forgotten.”  For example when you are sleeping we are not aware of what is going on around us, it’s the same when we sleep we have no spirit or nor are we conscience .

"most likely your grandma.. She misses you.... sage your home, cleanse your crystals and pray... my father used to be a prankster and after his passing things literally go missing in seconds like the damn scissors are on the counter 2 hrs later i find them under the kitchen table! annoying AF but makes me smile and laugh in the long run.. our light bulbs constantly go out on certain special occasions too, like when his family visits me or when something special happens in my life e.i pregnancy.. also when we bought our second property literally 5 min after getting the news the house was ours our main big clock in the living room stopped as my husband got off the phone with the realtor.. Lastly my father visits me in dreams. it&#39;s crazy cuz the dreams are more like visions because they feel soooo real! I know way too much information but don&#39;t be scared just take a few minutes to dedicate to her.. I lost my father when i was 21.. 12 years ago and it&#39;s still super hard at times......",Ncr Ajmd,2019-01-07T03:44:27Z,5

"AH this shit scared me 🤣🤣<br /><br />I totally believe in spiritual things like this, it’s so freaky. I feel like if it was your Nan that she wouldn’t make you feel uncomfortable in anyway at all or present herself as a dark shadow. Usually our loved ones are light and make us feel comforted. If you are feeling emotionally vulnerable or under tremendous stress I believe negative energies try to come and pull us toward the “darkness”. You totally did the right thing though by telling the presence you were freaked out!! Usually when you say something along those lines that eerie feeling goes away, at least from the experiences I’ve had! You’re stronger than the darkness, positivity wins! <br /><br />ALSO so glad to see your beautiful face in another video. Love these types of videos!

He use to steal our makeup and hide it random places or he would take things that I use constantly and move them I swear!

Once it happened when I was in elementary school and I was sleeping in my sisters room and I woke up bc I felt someone starring at me so when I woke up I saw a dark shadow standing in the doorway with glowing blue eyes! I rolled over and closed my eyes until I felt like it was gone.

"That’s creepy. You should get a Bible. I dont know if you’re religious but the cross necklace makes me think your Nan was. The “Ghost” isn’t your Nan. It’s an evil spirts/fallen angel (demon)of the devil. They, as you probably know, bring seriously bad energy. Sinking you deeper and deeper away from Gods love and comfort. ♥️ <br />“Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you”<br />James 4:7<br /><br />“I waited patiently for the Lord; he turned to me and heard my cry. He lifted me out of the slimy pit, out of the mud and mire; he set my feet on a rock and gave me a firm place to stand. He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God. Many will see and fear the Lord and put their trust in him.”<br />Psalm 40:1-3",Blessed With Londynn,2019-01-07T03:10:42Z,137

"Hannah Haase Heffley Hi, I&#39;m putting this here because my original post is not getting any responses which is odd. That&#39;s not what I&#39;m looking for but it&#39;s an indication that no one is seeing it and/or it&#39;s been blocked or something.<br />Nicole, you&#39;ve given demonic entities permission to be there.... you&#39;ve invited them (unintentionally of course) by using crystals and any other occult activities. Also, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve signed any fame and fortune contracts.. they are dangerous and satanic and that&#39;d be another opening for demonic activity. Demons​ are masters at deception and they want you to believe it&#39;s your Nan but it&#39;s not. Your Nan is slumbering peacefully until the resurrection and judgement. Yahuah&#39;s​ word is full of warnings about these things and He warns us out of LOVE and that&#39;s where I&#39;m coming from too.<br />Our loved ones do not stay and hang around but they do sleep until the resurrection and judgement. It is not your grandma.<br />Please get a Bible and read and ask Yahuah our creator to reveal truth to you. He loves you and doesn&#39;t want you to experience demonic activity but we all need to trust Him and His warnings about the occult and witchcraft etc and we need to stay away from those things. I&#39;m praying for you. 💗💜",Erin M,2019-01-12T02:07:13Z,2

I actually just started training her how to bark on command and ever since I started doing that she’s been more talkative. HOWEVER, she’s never been a guard dog nor did I teach her any of this weirdness! Last night around 3 (my boyfriend was just about to lay down to sleep and I was asleep) he said MY dog got in a “scared” position - which I’ve never seen her do. She growls and barks once very loud at the door!!! It was closed. My boyfriend got up and looked around our place and didn’t see anyone, she calmed after.

Me and my sister-in-law played with a ouija board at her house one day. Everyday after that when she would put my niece down for a nap she would close the door. When she would go check on her the door would be open. Finally one day she said she was talking to whoever she felt like was there and asked they would please stop opening the door. Never happened again after that. So I totally believe someone might have been listening to you!,Danielle Harrington,2019-01-07T02:50:55Z,2

"Hey Nicole, in my own experience with ghosts (which was only one situation) it can occur because you’ve brought a antique object into your house. Something previously owned by someone, someone that has passed. That object can then have some of that person’s energy. I used to be a big antiquer, but I had a bad ‘shadow like’ experience involving a painting that had been owned by someone that passed. Maybe ask yourself if you’ve brought an object like that into your home.",Hayley Ferguson,2019-01-07T01:49:57Z,0
How about her nans necklace? It was a personal belonging that was close to her. She said it was hanging in the bathroom. She seen the shadow in the bathroom. It could be related given if it&#39;s the same bathroom.,I Am PerfectInGodsEyes,2019-01-07T02:22:59Z,0

Marisol Araujo yeah we want him to go because he suffered from depression and anger (like most of us). He’s died before when he was younger... and when he woke he told us he saw a bright light and that god sent him back and it wasn’t his time. This time the years later he didn’t come back.,Stephanie Gamez,2019-01-07T07:39:35Z,0
If his death was traumatic then hes not resting in peace his soul hasn&#39;t left you have to pray and God to help him move on and not stay here or he will only be here as a unhappy soul when u feel or see him start praying it will help him to move on .... my family has gone through this as well we stopped talking bout it so much and just praying and tried being happier because sometimes they will also stay when u wont let them go because you havent accepted the fact that hes gone or u have but u dont let him fully go u have to be strong and just let him go,Marisol Araujo,2019-01-07T07:35:12Z,0
Marisol Araujo yeah my sister has seen him a few times in her house she said like twice... yeah i have told him once. He died traumatic but ever since he died i can’t sleep .’,Stephanie Gamez,2019-01-07T07:21:05Z,0
Stephanie ... when u pray tell him to go to heaven that he no longer lives on earth it&#39;s time to rest and not worry about anything anymore u guys are okay and u except he has to go but that he cant stay or he wont ever be in peace,Marisol Araujo,2019-01-07T07:06:25Z,1

I had someone very close to me pass away in June. My entire family was in our living room and I hear footsteps sort of heavy taking about 3 steps and as whoever it was was about to turn the corner I became very afraid to see who it was... I think I may have had a heart attack. Just I know in my heart it was him coming to say goodbye? Very intense experience.,Cassie Denny,2019-01-07T01:19:04Z,0
"Honestly, I don&#39;t think I will ever stop watching your videos. As long as you keep doing them. It&#39;s been 8 years and counting now so, why stop now? It&#39;s insane to still be watching you and just now realizing how much time I&#39;ve spent watching your vids. I just started my channel. I can&#39;t wait one day to look back and see how far I&#39;ve come as well. ❤",Courtney Lyn,2019-01-07T01:19:04Z,0

"I lost my older brother when I was 8. I am 28 now and I have had manyyyy moments over the years where I knew he was with me. He sends me signs constantly (certain numbers, rainbows, songs that randomly play, etc.) I can tell you that I do not believe the shadow is your Grandma. However, the cross - THAT was her. Pay attention to small signs like that. Be mindful and keep your energy positive. She will come to you in ways like that and if you are lucky like I feel I have been with my brother, it will continue for the years to come.",Tori G.,2019-01-07T01:16:21Z,29

I really don&#39;t even have anything against people who want to post that they&#39;re looking for  subscribers, but just make your <b>own</b> comment,  <b>one</b> comment, saying that you&#39;re looking for people who want to support each other&#39;s channels.&quot; Don&#39;t reply to every single comment in everyone&#39;s comment section, asking them that. You even asked someone who I know has over 200,000 subscribers....are you even paying attention to who you&#39;re asking? Are you even taking the time to read their comments and <b>pretend</b> you&#39;re interested in what they have to say? Or you&#39;re just strictly going thru every comment, hitting reply, and copying/pasting? 🙄",Ellen Marie O,2019-01-07T01:48:44Z,3
