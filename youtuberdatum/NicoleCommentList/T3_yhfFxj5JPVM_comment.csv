I got done at 7 this morning n It&#39;s 10:55 am n I&#39;m about to go to sleep to be at work at 7pm but I figured I&#39;d watch a few videos to settle my mind lol..Anyways my husband is puerto rican n for years had long beautiful curly hair unfortunately he lost it thru chemo n even tho he&#39;s been in remission 5yrs n even back to full time work  he never could grow it back. I was always jealous n hoped my kids had the same hair but they ended up with my straight hair,😭 also I need those skin products a....retinol is really hard on my skin I can&#39;t use it enough to see results. I also can&#39;t use any cleansers with salicylic acid n a lot of the clarifying cleanser have that in it.
