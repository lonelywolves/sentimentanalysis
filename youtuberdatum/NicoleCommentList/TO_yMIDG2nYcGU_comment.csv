Yosemite is my most favorite place I&#39;ve ever been to. I live in the SF bay area so the drive is not too bad and I try and go at least twice a year. The best time to visit is early summer when the snow has melted and the waterfalls are at their peak flow. It is beautiful the entire year though. Yosemite falls will probably be dried up this time of year. I recommend hiking the mist trail to the top of Vernal falls. Its is my favorite and I try and do it each trip. And check out the giant sequoias! Have fun!!!,Kayleigh Fink,2019-09-10T20:50:14Z,0

@EGMA i don&#39;t think its like that. Some women do change their mind once they&#39;re being proposed to but other will flat out say no. And you technically did say that by saying &quot;all women say that&quot;.,BrownSugaa,2020-11-09T17:16:58Z,0
@BrownSugaa yes of course I never say that all women want to be married. I said that’s what they all say meaning women like Nicole been in long term relationships and the minute the man gives them the ring they ALL say yes. Maybe thats what they truly thinking but once the ring is out all those thoughts are out of the window.,EGMA,2020-11-09T16:50:14Z,0

@Karla Hernandez it does matter actually. It doesn’t matter how progressive you think you are at one point you’re going to resent him. Look at how many couples break up and ask them how many women will do that again. We should be partners in life if not hire yourself an assistant or a chef in this case.,EGMA,2020-11-09T08:25:05Z,0
