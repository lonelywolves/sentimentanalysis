"I got the same retro vibes from your look. It&#39;s gorgeous and you look amazing with the simple eye look, the headband  and lashes and dark hair.  Also, like to know how the foundation worked out for you.",Darla Maher,2019-01-28T16:27:25Z,0
Cute look! But I’d recommend getting a sample of the foundation before buying it. I got a deluxe sample at Sephora once and it made my skin feel like it was burning a tingly feeling and I got bumps on my face I took it off right away. I don’t have sensitive skin either so I’m not sure why it happened. But since this foundation has skincare in it just test it before you purchase,VNSA X,2019-01-28T16:25:34Z,0

What hydrating mask do u use or what would u recommend for EXTREMELY DRY skin? Canadian winters are harsh on my face  🥶,Melissa T,2019-01-28T04:40:07Z,0
"@Melissa T you can get it at Sephora. If you have a store near you you could always ask to try it on or grab a sample. It really helps to just plump up and hydrate your skin when it&#39;s dried out and dull. I notice fine lines start to disappear when I used it daily. The caudalie hydrating mask is nice to have if your skin gets dehydrated, it can be used as a night cream too. Both are safe for sensitive skin and have good ingredients.",Jess Williams,2019-01-30T02:11:12Z,1
Jess Williams no never tried thanks 🙏. Never heard of it.  Where would I find it?,Melissa T,2019-01-28T05:48:55Z,0
"Have you tried the Ren hydro boost? Definitely a Canadian winter must have. I think she still uses the origins drink up mask, but that gave me such a bad reaction, I switched to the caudalie one.  Their gentle cleansing milk is also great during the winter too.",Jess Williams,2019-01-28T04:52:56Z,0

"I&#39;ve tried that foundation, as well as the Glow Clinique foundation.  I didn&#39;t like either one of them.  They felt like they never set and the coverage only lasted a few hours.  I have normal/dry skin, so I can only imagine the struggle a girl with oily skin would have.  If you like a wet feeling foundation that never seems to set and wears off after a few hours, this is the foundation for you.",monymony68,2019-01-28T04:20:12Z,15
@AnaKay404 try a turmeric mask there&#39;s some great diy vids here YouTube,tawanna S,2019-01-29T03:37:26Z,1
Kelly Oliveira thank you for your kind suggestion!! I actually don’t wear primer and I was intrigued by what it claims it does. I don’t have a lot of acne but there are little spots here and there that I’d like to get rid of. I currently use clinique moisturizer(the yellow one) and i love it! I also have the redness solution face cleanser because I have really sensitive skin. Do you have a suggestion for something to get rid of those spots? I’m just worried because I can’t really try much because of the sensitive skin issue,AnaKay404,2019-01-28T21:52:30Z,1
"@AnaKay404 I dont own it and never will but I&#39;d like to let you know/sggest you shouldn&#39;t try to look for skincare in a foundation. Its going over moisturizer and primer or at least one of those so its not right on the skin but even if it is, your better off getting a great foundation that&#39;s great not because it has skin care in it. Invest in good skin care. They have great drugstore options for those that cant afford a lot these days!",Kelly Oliveira,2019-01-28T21:44:39Z,2
