"@Sassy Girl Definitely keep wearing the masks (cleaning reusable between uses) but the fibre used to make the masks might be what is irritating your skin so check that - it&#39;s like how wool makes people some people itchy, you know? That way you will know to use the reusable mask instead of the disposable. Also just clean the mask with a spray of isopropyl alcohol before you put on (even if you just washed it) and don&#39;t wear makeup under it.",Beck Cetera,2020-08-25T03:48:41Z,0
