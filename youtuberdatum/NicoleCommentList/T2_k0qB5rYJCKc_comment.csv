When it comes to the face breaking out from wearing the masks, someone pointed this out to me.. you&#39;re not breaking out from the mask itself, you are breaking out from the laundry detergent. Think about it.. what do you use to wash your face with? Not laundry detergent haha... Try washing your masks with an antibacterial FACE WASH! I promise you, it works and will keep the breakouts to a minimum. Hope you see this message! Love you girl! &lt;3",MsChristine07,2020-11-25T00:00:40Z,0

Howcome she never addresses her brand? The rose lip mask etc? What happened,B F,2020-11-19T01:39:56Z,8
"@Jae Sol that makes sense. Because she’s in the public sphere it can seem secretive, but I don’t know what else to call it. She doesn’t let on or update on any of her collaborations or endeavours. She promotes them and then moves on like they never happened. It’s weird yet quite sincere actually because she’s being an OG beauty youtuber and not someone turning themselves into a brand",B F,2020-11-22T11:34:19Z,1

"Hey~ if you do get lip filler? Just first do only a half vile of juvederm or rystalin . That way you can see if it’s for you and also how long it lasts. I don’t get mine done anymore because it looked a little off and didn’t last long but some people it looks great and lasts but this way, with less to start&gt; less of a commitment for first time. I like how your lips look now but I know it can be fun to try out a new look😊💕 Also a great lip plumper that doesn’t hurt but works is Clinicians formula. It’s a little more but lasts and gives a great boost👍🏼",Spredluv_ &_Prosper,2020-11-18T14:58:27Z,1

"I&#39;m curious.  I&#39;ve heard so many people say they use lots of hand sanitizer now.  Obviously when you go out shopping, etc. you&#39;d use it.  But for people who are just at home, COVID-19 doesn&#39;t just grow in the home by itself, so is everyone just sanitizing their hands for random germs that are laying around the house?  Or what&#39;s the deal with that?   I just wash my hands if I use the restroom at home, before I cook, and that&#39;s about it.  I don&#39;t really see the need to sanitize against myself or my family who have also just been in the house.  I am totally going to try that Clinique under eye stuff!  Ordering right now!!",Becky Nelson,2020-11-18T13:47:41Z,0

@Marisol Del Rio actually no they really were happy for us! At first my mom was pretty upset that we didn&#39;t wait to have a bigger wedding but once she realized it&#39;s what we really wanted all along she was happy for us! I hope your family feels the same. Try not to worry too much about what everyone else wants and just focus on you! Best of luck to you ❤,Brittany Hyatt,2020-11-18T22:50:19Z,1
Brittany Hyatt Thank you so much! 💖I’m so happy to hear that your special day turned out so perfectly for you!!🥰 I feel like we are so similar in that I wasn’t the type to dream about a big elaborate wedding either. But family and friends can be pushy sometimes and try to convince me that’s what I should want or I’ll regret it so it’s made me reevaluate what I really want. With COVID now though that just adds an extra level of stress and uncertainty about the future so I feel like eloping might just be the best option. Did your families had a hard time accepting your decision?,Marisol Del Rio,2020-11-18T22:33:32Z,1

I know a lot of women who say things like that because they feel the man that they are with will never propose or doesn’t care about marriage. Sometimes they just say it to lessen the expectation ( not talking about her but other woman),JadoreMii,2021-03-14T19:46:44Z,0
