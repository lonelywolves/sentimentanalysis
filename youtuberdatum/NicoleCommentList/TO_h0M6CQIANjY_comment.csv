"PSA the CT genius powder was tweaked shortly after launching because of the overwhelming crayon smell so it doesn&#39;t smell nearly as bad anymore, its very faint now.

"I’m super disappointed to see you say all the KVD drama has nothing to do with you. I’ve been a fan of you for years, you’ve always put off a genuine and caring personality when it comes to your fans. But I know I can’t be the only one of your fans who has a immune system that is/or has been compromised. Being Anti-vaxx puts those people at risk. Supporting someone who espouse those views over makeup? Really girl? It hurts that you care more about bomb makeup then the views of that company owner who are making every day things like leaving their house lethal for people and kids who can’t be vaccinated or who are already ill with all kinds of stuff that dealing with the consequences of people not getting their kids vaccinated should be the last of their worries. Idk, I hope you look into it and see just how harmful her words and belief are.",12oz Beehouse,2019-05-23T19:33:40Z,0

"You were literally the first beauty YouTuber I watched and I&#39;m super disappointed to hear how you mention Kat Von D and that it has nothing to do with you. It could. It could affect your family members, your subscribers or their family members. That is such a dangerous mentality to have in this day in age. What she is doing can affect not only the health of her child but potentially hundreds of children. No foundation is worth staying quiet over. Not saying this to be a nag, but maybe to show you how just because it doesn&#39;t &quot;affect you&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not worth noticing or taking about.",Ashley Moreira,2019-05-22T02:19:16Z,0
