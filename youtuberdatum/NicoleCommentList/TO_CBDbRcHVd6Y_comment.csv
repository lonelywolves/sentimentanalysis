"nicole i’m just seeing this news about your kitten. i lost my kitten, andrew, march 16th, 2018 to FIP. he was a normal, playful kitten for the first 3-4 months of his life and then he became so tired, lethargic and not himself. countless trips to the vet and a few months later i had to make the hard choice to put him down. it’s so heartbreaking watching your baby go through this, because there’s nothing you can do. just know you gave him the best life you could and loved him endlessly. so sorry about your loss. ❤️",Katie Webster,2019-12-04T02:43:32Z,0

"Fuck im so sorry about Juice. I lost my dear Maximus back in March after almost 12 years. He was a JRT dog and has a piece of my heart with him forever. I remember barely functioning those first weeks and it felt like all the color was taken out of my world. I know that unbearable pain and heartbreak you&#39;ve endured and probably still endure at those hard times. But like you said, you and Jeremy did everything your could and Juice knew how loved he was and how great of a life you guys gave him. I just wanted to share this with you cause I know how fucking hard it is to lose your fur children. Once again I&#39;m very sorry about your sweet kitten.",Taylor Garcia,2019-09-08T08:57:33Z,0

We only had her 3 months (she was 10months old) and then she was gone in the blink of an eye. Came home from our vacation and she got so bad she couldn’t get up to pee anymore. Before we left she was still the same crazy, sweet girl. It’s crazy how attached I was even after just 3 months. She was my baby girl 💔 It was the hardest I’ve experienced with any animal before.

"I am extremely sorry to hear you lost your kitty to FIP. Nicole, I lost my kitten to FIP two Februaries ago, and then my adult kitty to the same disease a few months later, which is extremely rare for an adult to contract. I still cry about the loss of them to this day. I had both of them cremated and I have a little alter. My brother created a beautiful portrait of my kitten that I hung above. Little things we can do to honor their friendship and what good times we spent together. The good news is that they have found a cure for FIP. The bad news is that it will take long for it to be approved by the FDA. Most people don’t understand how tragic FIP is because they’ve only heard of FIV or other more common diseases. Watching your kitty have to battle FIP while knowing a cure is unavailable is something I wish on nobody. Sending all the love.",CC,2019-09-04T14:46:46Z,0

I lost my first cat 4 years ago. After begging for years I got her on my 13th birthday. Then when I turned 26 I lost her. It still hurts to think about. Worst day of my life having to put her down.<br />In a mexican family it was unheard of to keep animals but I begged &amp; begged and she was the love of my life. I miss her so much it hurts to think about.<br />So very sorry for your loss.,Christina Valencia,2019-09-04T13:38:02Z,0

"I am so sorry for little Juice 😫 and so heartbroken. I wish you all the strenght to feel better.<br />I dont know if your vet thoroughly explained what FIP is but just to make sure, it is a disease caused by a virus which means its an infection. Kittens are more at risk to get it because their immune system is more vulnerable. The infection may have been contracted from or given to your other cats as well so please keep an eye on your other kitties 😕 love ya ❤",nenalinda234,2019-09-04T01:53:48Z,0

Time helps! I have a 19 year old cat and I thought I almost lost her about a month ago. Shes still off and on at times. She has cancer and I&#39;m giving her pain medicine when she needs it. I&#39;ve cried many tears with my animals. It&#39;s so heartbreaking! The good thing is you have the other cats to carry on Juices memory! I could only imagine having a child when my heart aches for all my animals that have felt pain.

"So sorry for your loss my dear. <br /><br />When you’re in a better headspace, I think a cool way to honor him would be to create a lipgloss called Juicy and donate the proceeds to a vet or animal shelter in need. Just something special in his name. 💜<br /><br /><br />Total side note and funny fact: the night of Mom’s launch party, il Makiage posted a bunch of pics on their Instagram. One was a huge group picture with everyone. They TOTALLY showed a front facing picture of Laura Lee’s underwear. I wrote them a direct message just a couple minutes after they posted it to let them know and it was deleted soo fast!

"I know no one is ready to lose a pet, family member, or baby. I remember writing a dm to you when I saw the little broken heart sending my love, and a few days later on the 21st of August, 2019 I lost my little brother, he was my family’s first pet, a unique chihuahua, he was the most perfect shade of brown, with beautiful green eyes. He was not friendly to a lot of people, only my family and my boyfriend, it is really hard, and everyday is a struggle. My boyfriend and I had recently moved out in May and since we left I had only seen him once. I miss him everyday, but I know he’s with my grandfather in heaven and my mans dog pulga.  My parents are struggling, they miss his presence. Today they showed me the box with his ashes and I immediately broke down. I’m four months pregnant and I really wanted my baby to meet him. I hope your family is doing great, I love you 💕 hugs and kisses from my family to yours.",SGVKITTEN,2019-09-03T22:37:44Z,0

"I can only imagine what you’re going thru! I lost my kitty Kayla a couple of years ago.. she got into (she drank) my moms bucket of bleach that she used to mop the floors that was in the kitchen. Next thing I knew... She started pooping blood out and hiding in the closets. I definitely knew something was wrong. I took her to the vet ASAP and they told me if she had been exposed to anything poisonous. She was an indoor cat, never had been sick, or had any problems. My whole world shattered when they told me she was suffering and the best option was to put her down. Losing a pet is never easy, especially when they are literally your babies. <br /><br />Just wanted to share my experience. Sending my prayers to you Nicole! And to the whole family❤️",Justina Ambriz,2019-09-03T21:40:59Z,0

"Sending my prayers to you and your little family. <br /><br />I know how it feels to loose an animal that was like your child. I lost a dog last year (a 13 year old corgi named Ginger). She was in the family since a newborn pup. Her (human) father and mother passed away two years before and ever since then, her health went downhill. The night she passed away was so hard for me. I was alone with her. She was trying to fight it; I was petting her, holding her and we cuddled and she still wouldn’t let go. <br /><br />I left the room for one second and she went. I was soooooo pissed at her for leaving without me there to help. But I knew she did that for a reason. She didn’t want me to see her go. <br /><br />We buried her in the back yard. So she can always be home. <br /><br />I still hurt when I think about it; and it’s been a year. <br /><br />I am so sorry for what you are going through. But it will get just a little easier as the time goes by. I love you Nicole.  🖤🖤<br /><br />xoxo 💋",Ruthie Rose,2019-09-03T21:22:12Z,0

"Hey Nicole, I’m so so so sorry for your loss. I know what your feeling and going through. I lost 2 of my cats. One of them on March 6 and my other cat Memorial Day weekend. And it’s heartbreaking for me until this day. My first cat that past away suffered, which we were trying to avoid so much. But the vet we took him to didn’t really seem to concerned about his condition or health. Not eating drinking, hiding from everybody. So when we took him back home he really took a turn for the worst . So my husband took him to the emergency vet cuz I couldn’t handle seeing my cat going through that pain and suffering. So when my husband was on the way to the vet with him., he passed away in the parking lot at the vet. And it was sooooo heartbreaking. Cuz I NEVER wanted my cat to suffer the way he did. AND MY 2nd cat Kiki he had liver failure and he was real jaundice. He went down hill real fast. So we made sure he was not going to suffer the way my other cat did. So we had to make that hard decision to have him put to sleep. My first cat was 17 his name was Mew Mew and my other cat was 12 Kiki. My daughter named him that cuz she thought he was a girl......Lol so we just kept his name the way it was, cuz she was 7 at the time and she didn’t want to change it. But I do have 2 more cats at home Bashas and loolie. And there doing great. I did have my cats cremated so I do have them back home with me. I hope your doing well and I hope your other fur children are doing good as well. Sending love, blessings your way❤️🙏🏻😻",Angela C.,2019-09-03T20:29:44Z,0

Much love to you and your family for your cat.... I had to put my family dog down we’ve had him for a long time he’s about 7-8yrs old and he was sick popping blood and we took him in and he was there for 3days and he got better we brought him home then two days later he seemed off like he had a stroke he was only able to move in one way we took him in and they said they think he has a brain tumor and it would be best to just put him down because he was just gonna get worse so we did it was so hard holding him while he passed away was awful the first two weeks were bad I hated it I was so sad couldn’t even function but slowly I am getting better.... hope the best for you 💜,Nessieloove19,2019-09-03T20:13:53Z,0

"The moment I seen the notification pop up on my phone while watching Friends I came right on here. I’m so sorry about the loss of your fur baby Nicole. It sucks to lose a pet who’s part of the family. I lost my Siberian husky almost two years ago to an illness she had gotten and tried to treat, but we only did what we could. She was our first baby to be a part of our family for thirteen teen years. She was there when our kids were babies and as they grew. My daughter loved her so much and it made my heart hurt more cause she lost her best friend. Still till this day I still wish that there so many things my husband and I wish we could’ve done. Sometimes I wish our pets could live forever. So sorry I rambled I’m with my dad story, but I am glad to see you back on this channel. Cannot wait to see what you have in store with your creative makeup looks.💜",butterfly49712,2019-09-03T20:13:14Z,0
