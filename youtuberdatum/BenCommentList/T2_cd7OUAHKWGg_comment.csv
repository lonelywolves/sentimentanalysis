"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd7OUAHKWGg&amp;t=42m00s"">42:00</a> <br /><br />Why should we care what the Founding Fathers believed, or did not believe, about religion? They went to such great trouble to insulate faith from politics, and took such care to keep their own convictions private, that it would scarcely matter if it could now be proved that, say, George Washington was a secret Baptist. The ancestor of the American Revolution was the English Revolution of the 1640s, whose leaders and spokesmen were certainly Protestant fundamentalists, but that did not bind the Framers and cannot be said to bind us, either. Indeed, the established Protestant church in Britain was one of the models which we can be quite sure the signatories of 1776 were determined to avoid emulating.<br /><br />Moreover, the 18th-century scholars and gentlemen who gave us the U.S. Constitution were in a relative state of innocence respecting knowledge of the cosmos, the earth, and the psyche, of the sort that has revolutionized the modern argument over faith. Charles Darwin was born in Thomas Jefferson&#39;s lifetime (on the very same day as Abraham Lincoln, as it happens), but Jefferson&#39;s guesses about the fossils found in Virginia were to Darwinism what alchemy is to chemistry. And the insights of Einstein and Freud lay over a still more distant horizon. The furthest that most skeptics could go was in the direction of an indeterminate deism, which accepted that the natural order seemed to require a designer but did not necessitate the belief that the said designer actually intervened in human affairs. Invocations such as &quot;nature&#39;s god&quot; were partly intended to hedge this bet, while avoiding giving offense to the pious. Even Thomas Paine, the most explicitly anti-Christian of the lot, wrote The Age of Reason as a defense of god from those who traduced him in man-made screeds like the Bible.<br /><br />Considering these limitations, it is quite astonishing how irreligious the Founders actually were. You might not easily guess, for example, who was the author of the following words:<br /><br />&quot;Oh! Lord! Do you think that a Protestant Popedom is annihilated in America? Do you recollect, or have you ever attended to the ecclesiastical Strifes in Maryland Pensilvania [sic], New York, and every part of New England? What a mercy it is that these People cannot whip and crop, and pillory and roast, as yet in the U.S.! If they could they would. . . . There is a germ of religion in human nature so strong that whenever an order of men can persuade the people by flattery or terror that they have salvation at their disposal, there can be no end to fraud, violence, or usurpation.&quot;<br />That was John Adams, in relatively mild form. He was also to point out, though without too much optimism, the secret weapon that secularists had at their disposal--namely the profusion of different religious factions.<br /><br />&quot;The multitude and diversity of them, You will say, is our Security against them all. God grant it. But if We consider that the Presbyterians and Methodists are far the most numerous and the most likely to unite; let a George Whitefield arise, with a military cast, like Mahomet, or Loyola, and what will become of all the other Sects who can never unite?&quot;<br />George Whitefield was the charismatic preacher who is so superbly mocked in Benjamin Franklin&#39;s Autobiography. Of Franklin it seems almost certainly right to say that he was an atheist (Jerry Weinberger&#39;s excellent recent study Benjamin Franklin Unmasked being the best reference here), but the master tacticians of church-state separation, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, were somewhat more opaque about their beliefs. In passing the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom--the basis of the later First Amendment--they brilliantly exploited the fear that each Christian sect had of persecution by the others. It was easier to get the squabbling factions to agree on no tithes than it would have been to get them to agree on tithes that might also benefit their doctrinal rivals. In his famous &quot;wall of separation&quot; letter, assuring the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut, of their freedom from persecution, Jefferson was responding to the expressed fear of this little community that they would be oppressed by--the Congregationalists of Connecticut.<br /><br />This same divide-and-rule tactic may have won him the election of 1800 that made him president in the first place. In the face of a hysterical Federalist campaign to blacken Jefferson as an infidel, the Voltaire of Monticello appealed directly to those who feared the arrogance of the Presbyterians. Adams himself thought that this had done the trick.<br /><br />&quot;With the Baptists, Quakers, Methodists, and Moravians,&quot; he wrote, &quot;as well as the Dutch and German Lutherans and Calvinists, it had an immense effect, and turned them in such numbers as decided the election. They said, let us have an Atheist or Deist or any thing rather than an establishment of Presbyterianism.&quot;<br /><br />The essential point--that a religiously neutral state is the chief guarantee of religious pluralism--is the one that some of today&#39;s would-be theocrats are determined to miss. Brooke Allen [ in Moral Minority: Our Skeptical Founding Fathers (2006)] misses no chance to rub it in, sometimes rather heavily stressing contemporary &quot;faith-based&quot; analogies. She is especially interesting on the extent to which the Founders felt obliged to keep their doubts on religion to themselves. Madison, for example, did not find himself able, during the War of 1812, to refuse demands for a national day of prayer and fasting. But he confided his own reservations to his private papers, published as &quot;Detached Memoranda&quot; only in 1946. It was in those pages, too, that he expressed the view that to have chaplains opening Congress, or chaplains in the armed forces, was unconstitutional.<br /><br />Of all these pen-portraits of religious reservation, the one most surprising to most readers will probably be that of George Washington. While he was president, he attended the Reverend James Abercrombie&#39;s church, but on &quot;sacramental Sundays&quot; left the congregation immediately before the taking of communion. When reproached for this by the good Reverend, he acknowledged the reproof--and ceased attending church at all on those Sundays which featured &quot;the Lord&#39;s supper.&quot; To do otherwise, as he put it, would be &quot;an ostentatious display of religious zeal arising altogether from his elevated station.&quot;<br /><br />Jefferson was content to take part in public religious observances and to reserve his scorn and contempt for Christianity for his intimate correspondents, but our first president would not give an inch to hypocrisy. In that respect, if in no other, the shady, ingratiating Parson Weems had him right.<br /><br />In his 1784 book, Reason: The Only Oracle of Man, Ethan Allen wrote: &quot;The doctrine of the Incarnation itself, and the Virgin mother, does not merit a serious confutation and therefore is passed in silence, except the mere mention of it.&quot; John Adams was prepared to be a little more engaged with theological subjects, in which he possessed a huge expertise, but he also reposed his real faith in the bedrock of reason. Human understanding, he wrote (seemingly following David Hume), is its own revelation, and:<br /><br />&quot;[h]as made it certain that two and one make three; and that one is not three; nor can three be one. . . . Miracles or Prophecies might frighten us out of our Witts; might scare us to death; might induce Us to lie; to say that We believe that 2 and 2 make 5. But we should not believe it. We should know the contrary.&quot;<br />From David Hume via ridicule of the Trinity to a prefiguration of Winston Smith! The connection between religious skepticism and political liberty may not be as absolute as that last allusion implies, but there is no doubt that some such connection existed very vividly in the minds of those &quot;men of the Enlightenment&quot; who adorned Philadelphia and Boston and New York and Washington as the 18th century evolved into the 19th.<br /><br />In a first-class closing chapter on the intellectual and scientific world that shaped the Framers, Allen discusses the wide influence then exerted by great humanist thinkers like Hume, Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke, Locke, and Voltaire. It became a point of principle as well as of practice to maintain that liberty of conscience and the freedom of the individual were quite incompatible with any compulsion in religion, just as they would be incompatible with any repression of belief. (This is precisely why the French revolution, which seemed to negate the promise of Enlightenment, was to become such a painful cause of disagreement, and worse, between Federalists and Republicans.)<br /><br />In 1821 Thomas Jefferson wrote of his hope &quot;that the human mind will some day get back to the freedom it enjoyed 2000 years ago. This country, which has given the world an example of physical liberty, owes to it that of moral emancipation also.&quot; I think that Allen is not wrong in comparing this to the finest passages in Edward Gibbon. She causes us to catch our breath at the thought that, at the birth of the United States, there were men determined to connect it to a philosophical wisdom that pre-dated the triumph of monotheism. It is the only reason for entertaining the belief that America was ever blessed by &quot;Providence&quot;--as Roger a named his open-minded settlement in Rhode Island, a refuge from the tyranny of Pilgrims and Puritans.<br /><br />In a time when the chief declared enemy of the American experiment is theocratic fanaticism, we should stand together and demand, &quot;Mr Jefferson: Build Up That Wall!&quot;",PresidentialWinner,2020-07-28T07:54:06Z,0

How do conservatives square statements like &quot;no one should be punished or rewarded for what their parents or ancestors did&quot; with a general opposition to post-death inheritance/estate taxes?,TJLSJ,2020-07-27T10:18:00Z,0
"Correction... the biggest slice of government spending is going to help senior&#39;s in the form of SSN.  Then military and Medicare, then Medicaid.  That accounts for about 80% of the budget.  So... it&#39;s simply not true that our government is pissing away half of our GPD on social/education programs aimed at helping poor families and children break the cycle of poverty.  I wish our government was as committed to this noble cause as you suggest, but alas... the budget suggests otherwise.<br /><br />Also... it&#39;s a false narrative that we are taxed more now than ever before... And that pogressive taxes harm growth.  Generally speaking, progressive taxes were much much higher post WWII.  Yet, we had no problem growing industry, becoming the world&#39;s top economy, having a strong stable middle class, and slowly but surely reducing inequalities that were the result of past discriminatory laws and policies.  It wasn&#39;t until the late 70s early 80s (when trickle down economic theory gained steam within the business community and Republican party) that wealth started to become more and more concentrated at the top, while the economics for those at the bottom and middle have become less and less stable.  Very little trickled down.<br /><br />So I respectfully disagree with these narratives you have advocated.<br /><br />That said...  YES!  I fully agree with your general sentiment related to where and how our government spends its money... after all who isn&#39;t in favor of government making better choices when it comes to spending?  I&#39;m just not so pessimist to think that the only option is to give up and starve the beast so to speak.  Why not focus our American spirit of optimism to put in the hard work of passing policies that smartly and creativly try to tackle the equalities most people agree are problematic?  It&#39;s hard, but not an impossible task.  Many other capitalistic democratic countries have achieved better results in this area than we have.  If others can do it, so can we.",TJLSJ,2020-07-28T12:22:16Z,0
"The right tends to suggest the government stay out of it for the simple fact that government spending is at over 50% GDP and wealth inequality is higher then when we had far less government spending. Americans have never been more taxed and what have they gotten back?  Poor public education, minimumwage laws that create unemployment for unskilled, uneducated, inexperienced workers,  a class of welfare-dependents, racist and degrading affirmative action policies, unnecessary prolonged wars in the middle-east, government institutions that serve their personal interests over the public wellbeing, big business has their hand in the govenment pocket and vice versa.<br /><br />It is not that the strategies of taxation you mention don&#39;t seem reasonable , they seem very reasonable. It is just that in reality they prove ineffective and in many cases do more harm than good. When government is spending at over 50% GDP and we are still not seeing any effective result in narrowing the wealth inequality, at what point do you say  it&#39;s not working? They are literally redistributing half the nation&#39;s wealth, and the bottom is not lifting up as far as i can tell, it&#39;s staying right where it is, at the bottom. So, if we&#39;re gonna have inequality anyway, i&#39;d rather keep my money.  <br /><br />Just make people in the below 40k income bracket exempt from taxes and spend a little less on stupid wars and everyone will be fine, people can manage, no one is starving. <br /><br />Cheers pal ;)",Giles Demedts,2020-07-28T11:42:02Z,0
"@Giles Demedts <br /><br />I&#39;m actually not against allowing inheritance... to a degree.  It&#39;s reasonable to want to leave wealth to loved ones.  Of course that is a common goal that drives many people... And of course that human urge will results in passing down privilege across generations.  Just as the opposite is true... Where poverty is passed down.<br /><br />If reasonable people can acknowledge that one&#39;s family legacy affects one&#39;s life today for good or for bad, then we can all agree that the legacy of our governmental and economic system that was highly slanted in favor of wealth creation in certain groups of people over others has helped shaped some of the inequalities we see today.  And if we agree on this reasonable historical view, then I don&#39;t see any reason why folks are so against government programs funded by progress taxes that seek to help lift the poor up.<br /><br />Yes personal responsibility matters a lot too of course.  But we can&#39;t legislate personal responsibility.  However, since our government contributed to past discriminatory policies (which have helped shaped where we are today), then the government should also have a role in actively trying to correct the problems of today.<br /><br />Progressive tax systems and inheritance taxes, where some of the revenue goes towards trying to correct the legacies of the past sin of our government, seems like a reasonable strategy to favor.  It&#39;s not a zero sum game.  Having a healthy lower and middle class contributes the stability of our society and to the stability of macro economy... All of which benefits rich and poor.<br /><br />It&#39;s not about blaming rich people or white people or anyone for what there parents did.  It&#39;s about fixing the issue today.<br /><br />I think this is the primary difference between left and right.  The left tends to favor this idea of using tax revenue from the wealthy to help lift up the bottom... while the right tends to suggest that the government should stay out of it, and everything should be left to personal responsibility.",TJLSJ,2020-07-28T10:15:58Z,0
"When your parents leave you an inheritance you are not being rewarded for what they did, they were rewarded for what they did and then chose to pass what they had earned on to you. They can also choose to write a will and leave nothing to their children/relatives. By your logic parents shouldn&#39;t even feed or clothe their children because then the children are being rewarded for what the parents did  (the labour to acquire money to buy that food or clothing, ..etc.). The statement you mention is simply an underlining of individual accountability. It seems reasonable to me not to hold family members accountable for your personal crimes/misbehaviours, while still having the freedom to (choose with whom you) share the fruits of your labour. Most people choose their children, if they have any, obviously. <br /><br />In a broader sense all children are punished and rewarded for what their parents do though, and it is unfair, some children are born with drug dependencies because the mother was a drug addict. Some fathers leave their girlfriends during pregnancy. some parents choose to divorce. some choose to work hard and provide the best possible life for their children.<br />A great incentive for people to work is hard is that they can provide a better life for their children  and leave them something after they pass. It doesn&#39;t seem wise to remove that incentive , even though there will be unequal outcomes. <br /><br />I&#39;m making this a bit long but there&#39;s quite a lot of material by the late Milton Friedman on youtube, he discusses many issues of economics and politics, among which the inheritance tax, whether you agree with him or not, he&#39;s always a pleasure listening to and provides great insight.

"I feel like Larry should ask himself, &quot;At it&#39;s core what is religion if not a community formed around a belief that includes moral obligations, ethics, and societal rules?&quot; Then he would conclude that most everyone who has a brain is religious, just like how everyone is biased. We all have a system of beliefs that make up our everyday conclusions and assumptions. Therefore, America is religion, so many glorious, complex, philosophical religions. America is so religious that a major sect of religious America is called, &quot;Being American.&quot; The difference is when one religion is so but hurt that their belief system doesn&#39;t have as much control as it used to. Even though they have &quot;rightous intentions&quot; like how their belief is that our collective perspective of God is correct therefore your perspective of not God is incorrect and therefore invalid and destructive. When you really look at an aithiest you will see that they are as religious as a devote Christian the only difference is that from Larry&#39;s point of view it doesn&#39;t count because that&#39;s not religion and that&#39;s not God, and that is literally the definition of bigotry. Not trying to be defamatory or insult Larry directly, just his ideas. Aithiests can also be bigots when they say that other traditional religious perspectives are invalid and evil.  However history tells us that specific groups of what is now traditional religion have caused way more death, destruction, and misery than non-traditional and that&#39;s not to say that it couldn&#39;t be visa versa 2,000 years from now, it&#39;s to say everyone needs to shut up, stop blaming each other and predicting the future biased off of biased perspectives, take responsibility for the hurt each has caused and do better together. <br /><br />I&#39;ll start. This comment is somewhat hypocritical because I have slight personal bias towards traditional religion due to personal experiences.

The push for globalization enabled greater competition and sold as a means to bring economic opportunity to places like Mexico, China, and India. But it also left behind American labor. Yes we can buy cheaper jeans and flat screens, but we&#39;ve hollowed out our ability to produce and made it very hard to enter the middle class without credentials, while the elites are richer than kings. If we dont encourage the elites to invest in america and create opportunities for those left behind, our model of consumer-driven capitalism will decay and move on to the next wealthy country (China).

Biden, through his long political life, has done more to contribute to where we are today, than a guy who‚Äôs only been in office for a few years.

"Nothing changes when we have libertarians posing as conservatives.  Real conservatives are for traditions/culture, law and order, and religion.  Freedom, liberty and small government is just a smaller part of conservatism.  Libertarians are the ones who value freedom, liberty, and small government more.  That is why they get walked over by the leftists.  It is the reason the Republican party has become such a pushover.  Only real conservatives can go against the leftists. Why?

"@Ricky Shiffer I never said they started it.  I said crazy ideologies like intersectionality were allowed to exist because of libertarian thinking.  People who think intersectionality, lgbtq, abortion, etc. are okay, will be allowed to exist by people who prioritize freedom, individuality, and liberty.  They will not oppose such thinking because in their minds those people are free to think and act however they please.  That is why those ideologies have been allowed to gain traction in American society today.  Freedom and liberty is the core belief of libertarians so that means people with immoral and unconventional thinking will be allowed to continue to spread such ideas unchallenged, since to prevent it means taking a more authoritarian stance which goes against libertarianism.  Whereas in a conservative society, those kinds of people will be chastised and prevented from spreading immoral ideas.",Matrix Rebel,2020-07-26T17:48:35Z,0

Conservatives think in terms of what has worked and what is best for society on a moral level.  So no, libertarians will not be able to stand up to leftists because their beliefs and values for freedom and liberty above all others will always be walked over by more authoritarian ideologies.<br /><br />Libertarianism being on the right wing spectrum is also false.

"@Jeff Ruempel <br /><b>&lt;&lt;People don&#39;t flock to other countries and degrade themselves in low paying jobs&gt;&gt;</b><br />This is where you are wrong. <b>A highly educated public teacher in Italy makes about $1,500/month.</b> (Google it). And the cost of living in Italy is higher than most of US cities (excluding NY, LA, SF etc). If he comes here and make $2,200/month in Chicago ($10/hour), he&#39;s already better than he was, because the cost of living is also lower, and that&#39;s just his starting point.<br />Salaries in Europe are shit compared to the US, and the reason is high taxation and most capital owned/controlled by the State. But it doesn&#39;t mean that they&#39;re hungry or persecuted. <b>Do not confuse immigrants with refugees, refugees are a tiny tiny minority, less than 0.5%.</b><br />All talented and educated people come here for the EXTRA bucks. <b>That&#39;s why we also have high migration from advanced countries like France, the UK, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Japan, etc.</b> Silicon Valley also has Arab migrants who are already quite wealthy (that&#39;s why they studied at Harvard). Because the &quot;extra bucks&quot; are a lot more here, at least for the time being. A doctor in England rents an apartment and rides the bus, but a doctor in America owns a home and has two SUVs.

Unfortunately yes, and you&#39;re stuck with them.

It‚Äôs about the family, it‚Äôs about god and it‚Äôs about our reconciliation of both in modern America.",Punk Philosopher,2020-07-26T12:20:10Z,13

"dad bear dad  I don&#39;t like Biden, but in my personal opinion he Is better than Trump. Believe me I hate that we now decide candidates based on who sucks less, but that&#39;s where we are. Also, I believe it Is not only mainstream media but people like Ben, Crowder, Tim Pool, and even those on the left who spread this civil war bullshit that many people buy into, which like you said is very dangerous. I think we can agree on that. Thank you to everyone here all of you are very cool headed people who argued with me without any insults being thrown around.

"Bstar Barry Most people are liberals at heart the problem now is capital L Liberals are becoming ever more illiberal in their attitude, I don‚Äôt agree with all the Left or the Right says but let‚Äôs face it are you more likely to be attacked verbally and physically if you wear a Biden button or a Trump button. Which when you think that Biden has helped to incarcerate more Black Americans than was right and fair and Trump‚Äôs First Step Act freed many of the same seems strange. Civil War is neither likely nor wanted but the Civil discord stoked by the race baiting mainstream media is and will kill many sadly",dad bear,2020-07-26T19:09:31Z,2

"@Ricky Shiffer  Politicians don&#39;t serve their constituents, they pander and lie to them.  They serve the donors. If politicians wanted to get things done, they could, but they&#39;d rather keep people believing they have to vote for them in order to get an issue dealt with, then they balk so they can push the same narrative for the next election.  In the meantime they pass tons of regulatory legislation to please their big donors.  Both parties operate this way.",Subugatai,2020-07-26T19:29:18Z,0

@OrwellianFuture bruh you have to read more. Not to insult but to advice you. The problem you see with healthcare is that it&#39;s very costly that&#39;s why you want free healthcare for all but thing is it is costly cause of corporatism. Whenever you see people criticising any capitalist countries it&#39;s mainly cause of corporatism in that sector which karl marx criticsed and he sweared that only a corrupt free government can remove these corporate and help public as they won&#39;t allow these companies in economy so they can harras and control the country. In America healthcare there is monopoly thus they decide how much things would cost along with medicine. That&#39;s why Shapiro says to bring competition to these sectors who are basically controlled by these corporatism. So whenever you see someone criticising capitalism they&#39;re basically talking about corporatism and you would easily understand things,Shubham Mishra,2020-07-26T22:12:08Z,0
