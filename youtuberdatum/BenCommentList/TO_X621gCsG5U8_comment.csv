"Out Magazine, a long with a few other LGBT publications, lost me a while back. When they twist something like pushing to end sodomy laws into an act of hate because they hate the President behind it, that speaks a great deal to just how off the rails they have gone.

"Who agrees that the punishment of faking a hate crime was the maximum sentence the fake attacker would have received had the identical hate crime actually happened? That seems fair!  Can you imagine if the fake racist attack would have been caught on tape (OK -- and actually done well possibly even with Jussie dropping his precious sub) and went viral? It would be Rodney King all over again... riots and craziness. What Jussie what&#39;s his face did was beyond evil.... It is insulting to real victims of hate crimes, insulting to the entire Civil Rights movement, insulting to Martin Luther King Jr and his legacy, a slam to the gay community for him to play the gay card and identify himself as a strong gay man in America --- as there are many strong and amazing gay men who contribute to our society and how dare he (try to) place himself on a pedestal as the self-proclaimed leader of a group he does not even deserve to be associated with. Thank goodness he lacked the intelligence to pull of this &quot;hate crime&quot;, as there would have been violence and riots. He is  a tool and I hope he receives the highest sentence possible, as it is just gross watching him be interviewed and get all emotional like he is really teaching the world something about black, gay men in America.

Most of these TDS cases do not even need an external trigger such as a MAGA hat to have an episode.  TDS cases can happen anytime and anywhere.  My husband and I were even confronted out of the blue in a grocery store parking lot! (We were arriving, he was leaving)  Again, NO context, just the disturbed mind of a TDS sufferer.  This guy even pushed a shopping cart at my husband.  Just as quickly, this fine TDS sufferer pulled out a cell phone in an attempt to take a picture of my husband catching the cart and making an angry face.  Not so fast, liberal! This good wife pulled her husband away!  Many people in the store saw what had happened, and appeared supportive of us.  Some even shook my husband&#39;s hand!  Hooray for the silent majority!
