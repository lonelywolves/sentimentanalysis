"The racial income inequality gap is a myth,more white people are on welfare than black Americans are on welfare, the claim that there is some racial income inequality gap is a myth that the statistics has clearly proven to be an outright lie cause there is no racial income inequality gap if black Americans are less likely to be on welfare than their white counterparts, which means there is no racial income inequality gap built on another false narrative peddles by the radical left to try and turn the races against each other in society",Steven Keller,2021-05-07T19:12:10Z,0

Uni economics student  here <br /><br />Most rich people have inherited wealth and have created oligarchies that by their very definition have created a market failure with very little opportunity for market growth or development. The moment that few people have this amount of power and sway over a market is the moment that capitalism dies and the moment that market failure takes hold. For someone who claims to be knowledgable  I find it interesting that you seem to ignore the very definition and concept of market failures when talking about economic policies and policy making study and do better please I understand academia may not be a strong point of yours but making that effort would be appreciated.,zeffy ._,2021-03-22T03:36:23Z,0

"When discussing this topic, does anyone think about the real estate practices that took place back in the 40-60‚Äôs (red lining) which made it almost impossible for people who tried to make these good decisions by buying something of value that would appreciate over time, has anything to do with being ‚Äúheld back‚Äù? When a black family would try to buy a home in a white neighborhood but the real estate agent would not sell it to them because they feared it would drive the property value down? When they were told those houses in the white communities were sold when in fact they weren‚Äôt? When they were only showed houses in red lined areas? Over time, the value of the houses in the white communities continued to increase (which black families weren‚Äôt allowed to buy) while the red lined neighborhood homes did not. White families wealth grew, black families wealth stayed stagnant. Wealth gap <br /><br />This practice was eventually outlawed but evolved into and the subprime mortgages issued to families to combat this known issue (that continued covertly in the eyes of the law for years) back around 2008. These families were issued Subprime mortgages which were cheap to begin with but increased over time which led / would lead to them not being able to afford the mortgage. Then boom.. the stock market crashes and those families lost a large percent of what little wealth they were able to gain. White families lost to but they made out far better than the black families due to the accumulated wealth over the years. <br /><br />Anyone want to chime in on this?",GeeThree50,2021-03-12T08:45:40Z,1

"There are many stories of people ‚Äòdefying their circumstances‚Äô and jumping from poverty to middle or upper class. The left doesn‚Äôt think this can‚Äôt be done but rather knows that this is not the case for every individual because it IS more difficult to jump wealth classes than to be raised in upper or middle class and stay in the same class. The answer is NOT to gentrify and make all the ‚Äòpoor areas‚Äô into ‚Äòrich areas‚Äô because we know there isn‚Äôt room in the economy for everyone to be rich and gentrifying pushes the people who were able to survive by raising rents they can no longer afford.

"Israel was meant to be an example to nations around them, and the Torah (Law) established the nation of Israel with a comprehensive social welfare system to take care of the poor.<br /><br />Tithes:¬†Levites weren‚Äôt given an inheritance of land in Israel, they were meant to look after the Israelites spiritual needs not spend their time farming and herding flocks. As such they were among the poor in the land. They were to be provided for through the tithe,10% of all produce and herds going to 8% (1 in 12) of the tribes. So a generous provision for the poorest tribe. However the tithe was not just for Levites, they were also a provision for other poor people, for widows and orphans, and for immigrants especially those living in cities.

The debts of Israelites were cancelled in the Sabbath Year when the land was allowed lie fallow Deut 15:1.<br /><br />Every 50 years this went even further in the Jubilee year: Land, the main source of wealth in an agrarian society was redistributed from the rich who had accumulated it over the previous 50 years and given back to the families and clans who owned it before. Houses in walled cities were not included in this, though the houses in cities belonging to Levites were returned. Outside cities, houses were returned in Jubilee years too Lev <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8m4gweHd5U&amp;t=25m10s"">25:10</a>-55. All of this was meant to reset the economy every 50 years so the wealth that had been accumulated in the form of land and debts owed to the rich (read: banks) could be turned back to the more level playing field created by the Jubilee 50 years before<br />. One of the first Socialist Welfare programs created by Hashem and Moses. Income Inequality is reality. And the Creator gave the solution sadly Israel was rebellious over and over it was to be the model society for ALL nation&#39;s that meant creating a nice plan of a socialist welfare plan for the poor.

"My parents were both dirt poor when they were young. My mom barely had anything to eat while in the Philippines before she immigrated here with her family. Even then, she wasn‚Äôt much better here. <br /><br />My dad dropped out of school when he was young because the public school system <i>sucks</i> but then later went back so he could go to the sucky college her. He became a teacher but taught things in a way that no one liked even though it was the way the some of the best private schools here teach things. After, he opened his own businesses. He‚Äôs got tons and tons of stories on how he used to do this shit. <br /><br />My dad did the first ever hostile takeover in my state and is still the only person to have ever done one to this day. He worked hard and he‚Äôs the most intelligent person I know. <br /><br />Now? Currently, he‚Äôs considered upper class. He went from dirt poor to a successful man with a family and a good life. He‚Äôs got all the stories, friends, history, intelligence, and life experience to back it up too. <br /><br />You don‚Äôt need to be rich to be successful. You don‚Äôt need money from the start to be successful. You just need perseverance, wisdom (whether it be your own or others‚Äô), strength, bravery, and hope. You need to know that not all your deals are gonna be good ones but have the guts to make them anyway. You need to know that you need to take risks in life or you‚Äôre never gonna survive. You need to understand people. <br /><br />But most importantly? You can‚Äôt keep making excuses. If you want to be rich then you have to <i>try_. You can‚Äôt keep sitting around and thinking, ‚ÄúOh, I could never be rich because of systematic racism‚Äù or some dumb shit like that. If systematic racism _is</i> what‚Äôs stopping you then gather the evidence and figure out a way to end it. <br /><br />It doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to figure out that there are racist people in this country that would be disgusted by a successful POC but there‚Äôs more people in this country that would be willing to help you get around that obstacle than there are people who want to be that obstacle. <br /><br />Ps. This most likely doesn‚Äôt matter but for all the people who want to make excuses, my dad‚Äôs 100% Japanese, grew up dirt poor, and had terrible education whether it be in school or college.<br /><br />Hope this helps and have a happy Thanksgiving to all that celebrate it. üòä‚ù§Ô∏è",Chrystal Neveah,2020-11-25T22:47:21Z,1

"In her final go at question time in the UK House of Commons, Prime Minister Thatcher ridiculed an opposition (Labour MP&#39;s) assertion that the income gap between rich and poor in Britain had widened during her tenure as Prime Minister.  Prime Minister Thatcher pointed out that all incomes in Britain had increased at both lower and higher income levels.  She ridiculed the Labor MP as preferring that that the poor be poorer just so long as the rich are less rich.  This is the twisted mentality of the left.  During the 2008 campaign, then candidate Obama was asked during a TV interview why he wanted to raise taxes on the rich, even in the face of evidence that such tax increase could hobble the US economy thus hurting all earners, both higher and lower income earners.  Obama&#39;s one word answer, &quot;fairness.&quot;  Let everyone suffer in the interest of this man&#39;s concept of &quot;fairness.&quot;  Even more absurd is the mantra of the communist regime of Cuba, &quot;¬°Socialismo o muerte!,&quot; &quot;Socialism or death!&quot; The extreme left of all stripes, though they may differ in nuance among their various respective leftist ideologies all agree, ideology trumps well being of the public.  For them, leftist ideology trumps even human life.  The absolute reverse of this twisted paradigm is a principle in Jewish law, &quot;picuach nefesh.&quot; This principle stipulates unambiguously that if it is necessary to break any of the commandments in order to save a human life, not only may the law be broken, if in so doing a human life would be saved, the law must be broken.

Life is not that simple to say, ‚ÄúOh poor people just make bad choices.‚Äù  Empathizing with the opposite party isn‚Äôt saying you have to agree with their beliefs.

"It‚Äôs funny how you claim that culture doesn‚Äôt have to be interconnected to race even though every sociological study shows that it is. Just because you don‚Äôt like the facts doesn‚Äôt mean they are not true Benny. Also single motherhood is not a culture thing, is just something that happens to people because of other factors like poverty itself. Culture is a set of values of groups of persons that share characteristics, and has little to do with their individual objectively observed actions. If you‚Äôre saying that black people have a ‚Äúculture‚Äù that creates single motherhood that is inherently racist even if it was true which it definitely isn‚Äôt because cultural views on issues are always positively tuned to the group that supports them, in other words even if black people‚Äôs culture was creating single parent families it doesn‚Äôt mean that it was their culture‚Äôs fault since no culture in the world holds the view that single parent families are better than two parent ones, and so the system is the one that failed to integrate their culture with the rest of society and caused their specific culture to be the only one that was left out and keeps creating poverty and misery. Again, culture can‚Äôt create poverty and single parent families because culture is by definition a positive look on the values of a group of people, and is also very much dependent on race. Read the facts because they don‚Äôt care about your feelings.",152Deadpool,2020-11-06T20:20:26Z,0

How can we discuss bad decisions honestly and fairly when there are individuals who bad decisions are somewhat insulated?

"That is a perspective that can be skewed.   Some  neighborhoods it is bad. Others that are derelict it is good.

This anomoly was caused by the suburbanization and  the interstate.   Well as cities reached critical mass of sizea new trend of last 20years, where anew generation valued time and lifestyle over home ownership. Those areas now have value that they didn&#39;t before.  Urban renewal projects, mass transportation, farmer markets made those areas more liveable. So demand for those areas is higher than anytime since the invention of the car.   <br />Most immigrants leave those entry nieghborhoods within a generation.  Most workers advance and move to family nieghborhoods.  African Americans have  different conditions but even as they reach economic influence the affluent will leave those neighborhoods.<br /><br />What this is really about is power and control   those old neighborhoods Were areas of local power and in a city that is reinventing itself. That power is fleeting. <br /><br />  But don&#39;t worry about your nieghborhoods  like post 1968 you will see a flight out of cities inpost BLM/covid  so those areas will be free to slowly degrade  <br /><br />Cities change and nieghborhoods change also",jim evert,2020-08-23T04:10:29Z,0

Ben made the point that yes, it is important to recognize that history does play a factor in people&#39;s lives. People who had grandparents that were affected by redlining were more likely to have poor grandparents and so there was some less generational wealth they received. A lot of it does come from personal choice, but history does affect it some bit. Ben argued with the scenario that a black person lived in a poor neighborhood and he most likely made bad decisions. He said that the only way out of his situation was for him to make good decisions, such as looking at role models, but many of these people might not have any good models to look up to.

The whole wage Gap can be easily debunked. I watching the video on YouTube about the gender hourly Gap. Where are the women who are in court saying there&#39;s a gender wage Gap. Say their research shows that women make less money in a year than men do. But when the judge points out women worked Less hours that year. And then ask how much is the hourly wage Gap. And the women can&#39;t answer it even though they could but since it doesn&#39;t follow their narrative they refuse to even though their source for their argument provides that information they refuse to look at it because it doesn&#39;t support their claim. And it is so funny watching these women being called out on their s***.,Jp g,2020-08-20T00:57:31Z,0

"This is the guy who literally said &quot;I ignored my education.&quot; And speaking of education..<br />     Most college graduates in the U.S. and England (ironically) are now as linguistically literate as an elementary school graduate from the 70&#39;s. This is not the fault of younger generations. It is my generation and older who are to blame if a generation could be held accountable (witch of course is just ageism, another form of bigotry). But we obviously cannot blame generations who weren&#39;t even born when in the 80&#39;s the conservatives started purposefully and aggressively destroying our public school system in the U.S. <br />    I&#39;m not from England so I don&#39;t know exactly what happened there, though I suspect it&#39;s the same problem. But here in America I clearly remember what happened, and when it happened, and can see it&#39;s still happening. When someone starts spouting anti-socialist diatribe, there is your answer for why and how this happened. <br />   Public schools, roads, public health facilities, parks, and so much more are what socialism actually is. No country can succeed without having socialist systems in place. All western countries have many socialist systems in place. England in particular is an excellent example of how socialism can even save a country from utter ruin. After WW2 England was devastated and on the verge of economic ruin and collapse. Socialism is what saved England.<br />  The conservatives will point at countries like Venezuela and say: &quot;this is what socialism looks like.&quot; But Venezuela in fact is far far less socialist than the United States. Actually, Venezuela is a perfect example of what happens when social systems like health care, public schools and etc are purposefully broken by the wealthy elite. This is how they have always controlled us (that and the many forms of bigotry they promote). <br />    Consider how for about 1000 years, the ability to read was relegated solely to the church and the common citizen could be imprisoned (or worse) for trying to learn how to read. This put all of the power (knowledge is power) in the hands of the church and is exactly how they controlled the populace (along with borders, force of arms, threat of death, war, or the stealing of assets like homes, farms, and businesses).<br />  The conservative politicians of today know this and that&#39;s why they are so strongly against public education and healthcare in particular. They want us all weakened so we are easier to control. I&#39;m not saying the corporate democrats in the U.S. don&#39;t sometimes have a hand in this, many of them do. But conservatism is far more dangerous because they do these things out in the open on purpose now to normalize these things. To make people willingly accept having our homes stolen once a decade so they can sell them back to us again and again, making massive proift and sending the rest of us into the poor house, literally.",Aylbdr Madison,2020-08-14T19:46:56Z,2

"i would like to say that while those opportunities are technically available to everyone, the ways of seizing them are not equal and more times than not leave people exactly where they were, or worse off. i come from a poor family, but my mother comes from an upper middle class family. my father is an immigrant, and they both have college degrees. that opportunity was available to them both, and yet they have been drowned in debt their entire lives since, and could barely afford to keep me fed clothed and housed, let alone invest in my education beyond sending me to school with the necessary supplies. it is important to be financially literate, but knowledge and principal don‚Äôt dig you out of debt. the wealthy owe it to society, objectively, to help provide. they are apart of the community, and they‚Äôre tax dollars help better the community, allowing other members to rise up out of poverty and live more fruitful lives. <br /><br />as to your point about the wealthy not becoming wealthy at the expense of the poor, i must disagree. while it is true that the average person with money is not harming the poor, there are others who do. the owners of chains and massive corporations pay they workers only enough to stay alive, so long as they don‚Äôt wish to live on their own or have healthcare. as a former employee of places like that, i can attest to being worked to the bone and only then being able to make enough to not worry about whether or not i‚Äôll be buying groceries or paying rent. but that was after weeks of working for most of my waking hours 6 days a week, racking up overtime for months on end. i was payed well above minimum wage in my state, and yet buying decent health coverage was still a distant dream. and as a young, relatively healthy person who would prefer to stay healthy for a while, healthcare is something i see as a need. a necessary part of living in modern society. but if i want it, i must give up paying my phone and find a cheaper place to live. without a phone, i miss calls for work opportunities, and a cheaper place to live will likely be run down and in need of costly upkeep do to the constant onslaught of damp weather. <br />this is what happens to most people. one thing drags you down, and then everything starts falling on top of you. again, i must say that the wealthy owe just a portion of their yearly income to the government in the name of boosting social services to avoid that slippery slope. and yet ben advocates against that because he apparently thinks billionaires work millions of times harder than people like myself do, and that‚Äôs why they deserve to keep they‚Äôre money. <br /><br />also, the existence of wealth implies the existence of poverty. without it, wealth would be merely the norm. if everyone becomes financially wealthy, then there is no longer wealth. an ideal, in my opinion, and yet it is a monstrous ideal that damages the core values of america in the eyes of people like ben shabeeno",Elijah Vaz,2020-08-17T10:06:14Z,0
"@Elijah Vaz I don&#39;t follow the logic you present. Of course my parent didn&#39;t have me enslaved. They took care of me when I was a child, as all parents do. I am now an adult and so don&#39;t expect my parents to provide for my basic needs. I&#39;m not really sure how the Dr. And bus driver factor into the equation. As far as I know they provide services for pay and individuals are free to choose the service providers they use. <br /><br />The point I was making in my original comment is that people are responsible for creating the means of providing for themselves and if they have failed to do that, there is no one for them to blame except themselves.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes from &quot;The Richest Man in Babylon&quot; ( I highly suggest reading it) &quot;If you have not acquired more than a bare existence in the years since we were youths, it is because you either have failed to learn the laws that govern the building of wealth, or else you do not observe them&quot; <br /><br />I can not speak to what people who are struggling focus on. All I can speak on is what I was focused on when I was struggling. I did not come from a wealthy family. My first objective is to ensure that a wealth family comes from me. The second thing was to acknowledge that my thinking up to that point got me in the situation I was in and that same thinking would not get me out of it. I needed to change. In other words, I needed to accept responsibility for my own life. One can simply not own their success without also taking ownership of their mess.<br /><br />I do not agree that those who become wealthy owe a debt to those that do not. The same opportunities they too advantage of to get where they are is available to everyone. So, yes if I can do it anyone can. The thing is most won&#39;t. That is their choice and along with the freedom to choose what they will or will not do to secure a measure of economic empowerment for themselves, comes the consequences and repercussions of that choice. <br /><br />The fact is that the wealthy do not become wealthy at the expense of the poor. Yet, many seem to think that the poor should survive at the expense of the wealthy. The best way anyone can help the poor is to not be one of them. The more people who become economically empowered there are the better it is for everyone.<br /><br />It has been a great experience to engage with you in this much needed conversation.<br /><br />I am not one to continue with fruitless debates.

"@The Money Metaphysician so your parents had you enslaved?? the nurses and doctors are enslaving patients in critical condition?? the public bus driver is enslaving citizens that are trying to get to work?? you miss a key point in understanding that people in dire straits are not concerned about how can they can better contribute to the world and be them ost upstanding citizen, but instead are focused on if theyll be able to eat that day or will they have to walk up and down the median staring at people in cars eating mcdonalds fries and ignoring them. it is not slavery to be provided for by someone else, nor is it within the same universe. the prisoners and people abroad, as well as immigrants in america working for cents on the dollar to harvest your groceries and make your clothes and clean your public spaces are far closer to being enslaved than the millions of americans who are now relying on unemployment and social services to survive are. and speaking of mindset, the mindset that the wealthy got there on their own and are self made is poisonous. the idea of &quot;i did it, and so can you&quot; prevents those people with excess resources from donating to charities, because they ignore the systems that were already in place to allow them to thrive. sure, there are some who donate, but it is mere fractions of their overall income, when just a small percentage, less than ten percent, of their income could provide resources for the government to properly fund and manage social programs. the wealth gap is real, and is perpetuated by the idea that there is no systematic oppression that keeps people down, when the truth is that there is. we see it in a disproportionate nature. you are looking at things in a vacuum when you say it is solely the responsibility of the individual to &quot;lift themselves up by their boot straps,&quot; when in fact, they exist in a system that has historically kept them down, run by people who have historically implemented policies that hold them down, which has historically emboldened people of that same group to take it upon themselves to hold those people down as well. none of that is to say members of the oppressed groups dont need to work hard, it is to illustrate that they must work immensely harder to achieve the same or lesser goals than the members of the oppressing group. we see these across lines of race, gender, sexual orientation, financial well being, etc. the system needs to change, and the refusal to admit that there is something inherently wrong with it is ignorant and counter productive to creating a better society. sure, the 18 year old with a gun made a bad choice, but that bad choice is often their best choice, and the choice that holds the most reward for them. it is not something they necessarily want for themselves, but they dont know anyone who does, and yet that is the only choice that does not end in them dying of hunger on a park bench.",Elijah Vaz,2020-08-16T15:15:54Z,0
"@Elijah Vaz Thanks for your reply. You bring up an interesting point. However, I&#39;m not exactly sure I understand what you mean. Are you saying that not being able to afford a decent home and food absolves an individual from having to apply themselves or that someone else is responsible for providing for those who don&#39;t have adequate housing and food? I am not sure how personal responsibility goes out the window when each person is solely responsible for their own experiences in life? Even if a person doesn&#39;t want to be a millionaire, they are still responsible for providing their own food and shelter. People make poor money decision because they lack financial literacy. To say that someone else is responsible for providing me with the basic necessities of life, is far to close to slavery for me. In my opinion, it is the same as saying &quot;I&#39;m incapable of acting in my own best interest&quot; I think people are far too eager to argue for their limitations and in doing so miss out on opportunities available to them to change their situations. The fact is anyone that feels like they want to close the &quot;wealth gap&quot; can do so whenever they feel like it. Most often the difference between the &quot;haves and have-nots&quot; is proper information and willingness to execute. At the end of the day it still comes down to financial literacy, habits, and personal responsibility. I could also throw mindset into the mix. I appreciate your reply.

I would think conservatives would want to amend corporate laws back to what it used to be.. then we wouldn&#39;t need to have this conversation:<br /><br />    Corporate charters (licenses to exist) were granted for a limited time and could be revoked promptly for violating laws.<br />    Corporations could engage only in activities necessary to fulfill their chartered purpose.<br />    Corporations could not own stock in other corporations nor own any property that was not essential to fulfilling their chartered purpose.<br />    Corporations were often terminated if they exceeded their authority or caused public harm.<br />    Owners and managers were responsible for criminal acts committed on the job.<br />    Corporations could not make any political or charitable contributions nor spend money to influence law-making.,Got Em,2020-08-11T22:18:13Z,0

"Ben&#39;s take is willfully ignorant at best. More likely he is being intentionally disingenuous. To say there are zero systemic factors contributing to income inequality is nonsense that can be debunked in minutes.<br /><br />We have had many cities implementing Jim Crow era laws well into the 2010s, and they continue to this day. Redlining was happening under Bloomberg in New York. Detroit was found to be illegally inflating black residents&#39; property taxes to exorbitant levels to push the residents into default and foreclosure.<br />Redlining has pushed black and brown people into neighborhoods with purposely placed industrial runoff, intermittent power, and lead poisoned drinking water, all while they are taxed at rates disproportionate to property value. This forced many black citizens to start renting when they lost their homes even if they saved and scrimped the same way as their white counterparts in mostly white neighborhoods.<br /><br />Schools are funded by property taxes. When you have an aggregate area with devalued homes and a lot of renters, the public schools receive very little funding. Education suffers, and the for-profit prison industrial complex capitalizes on this by starting arrests early and often.<br /><br />They created the term &quot;School to Prison Pipeline&quot;, viewing black children as future resources to be scooped up and forced into manual labor. Just like the Keystone Pipeline for oil, schools in these neighborhoods are viewed as no more than a vehicle to move &quot;human resources&quot; to create profit for a few.<br /><br />These practices are not historical. They are happening right now. Every day.<br /><br />Comparing Asian Americans to black Americans is a completely false equivalency. This really isn&#39;t a difficult thing to understand.<br /><br />This isn&#39;t about personal choice or bad decisions.<br />If Ben had grown up in a neighborhood with poorly<br />funded schools, no clean water, industrial waste, illegal tax structures, regressive criminal and civil ticketing practices, and law enforcement oversaturation, I am fairly certain he wouldn&#39;t have done as well. You could take two families who started out with the same amount of wealth. The one in the neighborhood with clean water and great schools will almost always have a better outcome.<br /><br />By saying there is NO systemic reason for income<br />inequality implies that Ben thinks black people are<br />biologically or intellectually inferior to white or Asian<br />American people. If the ONLY reason black Americans are having poor material outcomes is because they are &quot;bad decision makers&quot;, there is no other insinuation than some type of inferiority.<br />Ben, this video would have been a lot shorter if you just quickly got to your conclusory implication- that you think black Americans are inferior and they deserve to be a permanent underclass in this society.",Katie Sigmon,2020-08-11T04:24:55Z,3

"I think this is a mischaracterization of left wing opinion of systemic racism. They&#39;re arguing that systemic racism is a <b>factor</b> which makes it harder to pull oneself out of income inequality - not that being Black is equal to having lower income. There are a number of studies that show that Black people are less likely to receive callbacks for job offers as similarly qualified non-Black candidates, that Black people are disproportionately subject to police violence, and more. Even if there are no racist laws (which I would argue that indirectly, there are), you cannot deny the history of slavery, followed by sharecropping, Jim Crow era, and prison industrial complex, which have perpetuated inequalities against Black members of our society. As for Asian immigrants (and immigrants in general), it is important to remember that they had enough income to make an international move in the first place. <br /><br />I personally do not believe that race-based laws or reparations are an effective solution for this, but I do think it is important to acknowledge that systemic racism exists, so we can better understand how to move forward.",Faraaz Nadeem,2020-08-11T02:43:27Z,0

"Countering the claim of Income Inequality is easy.<br />Human beings do not deserve the same income when they are not doing the same labor in the same job, with the same quality of work performed, and where the level of demand for that labor is not the same.<br />Put more simply: a janitor&#39;s work is not equal to the work of a software programmer. The latter&#39;s labor is clearly more valuable as people who are skilled laborers require an education to be capable of performing the job and thus are, by basic laws of scarcity, rarer, and because the demand for them in the modern information economy is high, means a limited supply and high demand for them makes their labor more valuable.<br />By comparison, anyone who can stand on his own two feet and has functioning hands and basic human motor skills can be a janitor, and such jobs are in low demand with the advent of automated cleaning robots. High supply of laborers and low demand makes their labor worth less.<br />Second is almost as easy:<br />Racism is an internal opinion (a personal belief and perspective of a human being), not a function of external systems.<br />A racist can implement policies which disfavor races which he is prejudiced against, but the policy itself is not racist, only unjust.",GreyWolfLeaderTW,2020-08-11T01:37:20Z,8

It&#39;s THEIR choice to make that decision and play.  People make choices everyday bad and good. Some of these affect your life horribly and other are beneficial. I think &quot;from doing some research&quot; the black community has brought a lot of these problems onto themselves. It&#39;s 2021 and we&#39;re still talking about equality for them. The 20 richest black Americans aren&#39;t athletes and have overcome obstacles to get to where they are. They didn&#39;t roll out the excuse machine. They&#39;re black, their parents were black and their grandparents and so on.  Truth is 100 years ago just 2 generations after the civil war and slavery was ended in America 75% of black households had a mother and father. During the civil rights movement I believe it was just over 50%. Today it&#39;s roughly 25%.  All this after readlining was outlawed him crow laws and so on.  The problem was the Liberal (whom Malcom X said never to trust)  started handing out money to poor black females that had babies out of wedlock. This made it easy for the black man to walk away when he didn&#39;t want anything to do with the child he created.

Systematic Racism? Have we already forgotten who was President before Trump? Yes that‚Äôs right a black man can be president but it‚Äôs also racist?,Open Eye,2020-08-11T00:37:50Z,4
"@Open Eye also tagging you, in case you&#39;d like to respond to any of the new points I&#39;ve mentioned",Faraaz Nadeem,2020-08-12T08:43:11Z,0
"@Pierre Soorden The fact that you say people &quot;can go by [a white sounding name]&quot; to have an equal chance at job callbacks is already an admission that systemic racism exists, and the point of the studies based on racially distinguishable names is to show that employers do have underlying or subliminal racial preferences. Going by a White name is an attempt to solve a symptom of the problem, rather than the problem itself. This would imply that when someone inevitably goes to interview in-person after making it past resume screening, race would become a factor even if they had a White sounding name. <br /><br />Indeed, that third study I linked provides a meta-analysis of 24 studies, at least one of which analyzes callbacks of White, Black, and Latino in-person interviewees: <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915472/"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2915472/</a><br /><br />Each interviewee is selected to have similar non-racial characteristics, such as height, (American) accent, no second languages, etc., and trained to answer questions similarly, dress the same way, etc. One of each race is sent to interview at 171 different employers. They find that &quot;white testers received a callback or job offer 31.0 percent of the time, compared with a positive response rate of 25.2 percent for Latinos and 15.2 percent for blacks. These results show a clear racial hierarchy, with whites in the lead, followed by Latinos, and blacks trailing behind.&quot;<br /><br />The study goes a step further to quantify the magnitude of racial preference by adding a set of trained White interviewees recently released from prison. Their criminal record is mentioned on their resume, and re-introduced when asked the mandatory question about criminal record by the employer. In this scenario, they find that &quot;whites with criminal records obtained positive responses in 17.2 percent of 169 job applications, compared with 15.4 percent for Latinos and 13.0 percent for blacks. [...] the white applicant with a criminal record still does just as well, if not better, than his minority counterparts with no criminal background.&quot; Later, they conclude &quot;the fact that known information about a white applicant‚Äôs serious criminal conviction is viewed with no more concern than the assumed characteristics of a young black man points to the strength and intensity of contemporary racial attitudes. Overcoming these negative expectations, even for a candidate with otherwise appealing characteristics, requires the negotiation of a number of significant hurdles not present for white job seekers.&quot;<br /><br />Sadly, this result should not be surprising, as it replicates a previous result showing that on the job market, Black people receive callbacks at lower rates than White people convicted of crimes, and that criminal records affect Black people disproportionately more than White people: <a href=""https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/374403"">https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/374403</a><br /><br />I can continue giving you links to more studies, including ones relating to other topics such as the criminal justice system. But the ones I&#39;ve linked so far (including the meta-study of 24 other papers) already give us tens of thousands of data points indicating that race is indeed a factor in job applications. I think it is understandable to continue to debate the magnitude of race-based discrimination, and whether race-based solutions such as affirmative action or reparations are effective, but I think you would be hard pressed to conclude that systemic racism does not exist <b>at all</b> in our society, given all of these studies.

"@Open Eye Well the very reason for calling it systemic racism is that it is hard to attribute to specific individuals (systemic definition: &quot;relating to a system, especially as opposed to a particular part&quot;). Here&#39;s a link to a study that hints at systemic racism in college admissions:<br /><br /><a href=""https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/SAUStates_ES.pdf"">https://cew.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/SAUStates_ES.pdf</a><br />&quot;In 2014, for example, 341,000 Black and Latino high school seniors scored above average on standardized college-entrance examinations, such as the SAT, but only 19 percent of them attended a selective college. Meanwhile, 31 percent of White students who scored above average on a standardized test attended a selective college.&quot;<br /><br />College admissions are admittedly much more complicated, since there are many factors to consider beyond SAT scores. It may be harder for us to come to an agreement on this subject. <br /><br />So if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;ll also take a moment to link some studies that show how Black people are less likely to receive callbacks for job applications as similarly qualified non-Black candidates. These are high quality studies that control for resume qualifications, economic background, gender, and other factors.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873.pdf"">https://www.nber.org/papers/w9873.pdf</a><br /><a href=""http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/Whitening%20MS%20R2%20Accepted.pdf"">http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/Whitening%20MS%20R2%20Accepted.pdf</a><br /><a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/41/10870.full.pdf"">https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/114/41/10870.full.pdf</a><br /><br />Some quick summary points from these papers:<br />1. White names receive 50% more callbacks for interviews<br />2. African Americans are 2.5x more likely to receive a callback when &quot;whitening&quot; their name on a resume (similar number for Asians as well)<br />3. Hiring discrimination against African Americans has not significantly improved over the last 25 years<br /><br />I completely agree that there are many people who aren&#39;t working hard enough to improve their own lives, but the idea of systemic racism is that racial inequality still exists as a factor after you control for work ethic or economic standing. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s unfair that Black people might have to submit 2.5x more resumes to get the same number of callbacks as a non-Black individual, or that they have to work harder in general to reach the same levels of opportunity?",Faraaz Nadeem,2020-08-12T02:35:26Z,0

"‚Äã@some guy It is indefensible to parrot the &quot;mostly peaceful&quot; line and downplay the significance of the riots.  Those riots are ostensibly a response to one man&#39;s death.  Last time I counted, at least 14 people had been killed as a direct result of the riots‚Äînot by law enforcement, but by rioters.  Justifying this crap is just evil.  The mainstream media have done nothing but chant &quot;mostly peaceful,&quot; apart from that one time when Fredo gave up and asked, &quot;where is written that protests have to be peaceful?&quot; The answer, of course, is in the first amendment to the constitution, but I&#39;m not surprised he didn&#39;t know that.<br /><br />I agree that a lot of the big tech companies are shady and at the very least treading the line of exploitative behavior.

"@some guy Are you kidding?  The media have downplayed the riots, it&#39;s mostly because of freelance journalists and new media that most people laugh at the &quot;mostly peaceful&quot; line.  Perfect safety is a pipe dream, but I preferred it when my friends weren&#39;t worried their businesses would be burned to the ground for the great crime of existing.  The government&#39;s main job is to enforce laws so that people can engage in normal commerce and livelihoods with the reasonable expectation that their stuff will still be there tomorrow and they won&#39;t be murdered on the way home.  We were at a 50 year low in violent crime, and it was very nice.  Then the media decided to make a martyr out of George Floyd, and so rather than simply pursuing justice in that case, they stoked an outrageous public response, and now we&#39;ve seen  gigantic spikes in violent crime in most of the nation&#39;s biggest cities, while most state and local governments have mimicked successive panels of the &quot;this is fine&quot; dog meme.<br /><br />Of course the government isn&#39;t a monolith; but neither is big business.  At least businesses are in direct competition with each other for our business, and we only enter into relationships with them voluntarily.  Governments, while they don&#39;t always see eye to eye at different levels and in different places, are all part of the same hierarchy of power, and are all invested in keeping things that way.  They don&#39;t compete for revenue, they just demand it.  They don&#39;t have to come up with better ideas than other levels of government, because most people can&#39;t or won&#39;t just leave the jurisdiction (less true on the local level).  They don&#39;t require our voluntary entrance into a transaction, they can send men with guns if we resist.  Of course, elections are a major check on this power, but the increase in bureaucratic governance means that most elections aren&#39;t as important as they should be.<br /><br />There is no way to &quot;redirect spending in ways that help everyone equally&quot; without big government.  And, the private sector does all of those things better than the government.  Because if you fail in the private sector, you don&#39;t get more funding next year.

"some guy Obviously, I don‚Äôt think anyone is saying the government is entirely evil.  My point is just that it‚Äôs a mistake to give it more power over private individuals lives, whether those individuals are rich or poor. The best thing it can do for the economy, and thus for every citizen, is to stay out of the way unless actual crimes are being committed.  And the inevitability argument applies exactly the same to the government as it does to business.  That‚Äôs what the justice system is for.  No economic policy will prevent evil choices.  The 20th century‚Äôs 100 million killed by collectivist governments teaches us that.<br /><br />The mostly peaceful protests that have mostly left big cities mostly not looted and in flames?

"@some guy If those checks and balances were working as intended, why does every presidential election matter so much?  Ideally, yes, the constitution is designed to keep things from happening, by giving so many parties the ability to stop someone else&#39;s proposal.  In practice, the legislature has been ceding its role to the other two branches, the judiciary (at least at the higher levels) has been behaving like a toddler with no pants on, running around urinating on everything while his mom can&#39;t figure out whether to catch him or clean up each successive mess.  And the executive is consolidating more and more power, but putting it in the hands of unelected bureaucrats with ideologies and no penalties for being gloriously wrong in their predictions.  So, it&#39;s pretty fair to be wary of the government.  The Roman Republic had checks and balances built in, too.  That didn&#39;t prevent Caesar from bringing his armies across the Rubicon, did it?<br /><br />It&#39;s not at all fair to say that collusion between state and business led to 100 million deaths in the 20th century.  &quot;Some,&quot; as you said, may be true; but only insofar as the collectivist ideology that subjugated the individual, also encouraged moral corruption among the poorest, and the richest, pervading all parts of society.  That would be the thread that ties them all together.  But it&#39;s tough to accuse big business of colluding with the government, when the government seizes big business and turns it into an arm of the state.<br /><br />There&#39;s some truth to the urban-rural divide, but a) it has very little to do with the issue at hand, b) NYC was the best it&#39;s ever been, when run by conservatives with a law-and-order mentality, and c) it doesn&#39;t provide much comfort to the people being robbed, burned out of their homes and businesses, and murdered by rioters.  &quot;Sorry you had to die Mr. Dorn, but we just can&#39;t run things like a small town, it wouldn&#39;t work.&quot;  Riiiiight.",nettles89,2020-08-11T22:32:56Z,0

"@George floyd You said, &quot;it kind of sounds like is you are saying white people as a whole make better education decisions...&quot;<br />That&#39;s only ONE thing, and I&#39;m only basing that on the different rates of HS drop-out.<br />Another thing that I think IS happening is that there are enough Whites going into HIGH income fields, like stock brokers, to REALLY skew the average earnings of the REST of Whites drastically upwards.<br /><br />I was also focusing on men of both groups who BOTH had 4yr degrees, trying to look for reasons WHY a Black man with a 4yr degree might make only 2/3 of what a White man with a 4yr degree makes.",Nyet Zdyec,2020-08-13T03:04:42Z,0

"@Nyet Zdyec yes I agree, somewhat... but what it kind of sounds like is you are saying white people as a whole make better education decisions...  im comparing a 4 year degree to not finishing high-school. I am not focused on what a 17 year old does. Im focused on the fact that a 17 year old quitters value is the same as a 22+ year old person with 4 more years of experience. I know no 17 year old civil engineers.",George floyd,2020-08-12T04:08:22Z,0
"@George floyd Let&#39;s just pretend for a moment...<br />1) You&#39;re a Black male... and I&#39;m a White male<br />2) Both of us work 52 weeks each year, and usually 40 hours per week.<br />3) Both of us have &quot;a four year degree&quot;, which is the way that the census, which is the primary source for the RAW data for most of these things.<br />The problem with this is... you get a BSc in... oh... Civil Engineering... and can reasonably expect to work full-time, and make 69K/yr easy... <br />I, on the other hand, got a BA in History, which doesn&#39;t qualify me for anything but being a teacher... less than 40 hours a week... BUT STILL ENOUGH to qualify as &quot;full-time&quot;, because that&#39;s generally 35+... but only 9 months of the year.<br />In this example, I do NOT deserve to make as much as you...<br />1) I don&#39;t work as many hours per week...<br />2) I don&#39;t work as many weeks...<br />3) Civil Engineers are more VITAL than History teachers (and, BTW, I happen to like History AND teachers... and History is important... but no one is going to die for not knowing when someone did something.  If a CE gets his decimal point wrong, it COULD result in death... even many deaths.)<br /><br />So, that&#39;s just one example.<br />I haven&#39;t studied THIS particular example, Black males with 4yr degrees making less than White males with 4 yr degrees...<br />BUT I HAVE looked at the GENDER &quot;wage gap&quot;.<br />The problems are going to be the same...<br />1) Insufficiently precise data... a 4yr degree in WHAT?  It MATTERS.<br />2) Just because 2 people both work &quot;full time&quot; (hours per week), doesn&#39;t mean that they are working even REMOTELY close to the same number of hours... just that both are working over a certain minimum #, which I think is usually 35.  You can&#39;t compare salaries of a guy working 40 hours with one working 80.<br />3) Just because someone is working &quot;full time&quot; this week/month, doesn&#39;t mean that they were full time 3 months ago, or will be 3 months from now.<br />ACCORDING to one study that I read last night, while trying to check your original statement... Black men don&#39;t work as many hours per year as White men.  That was ALL Black males against ALL White males.  The difference in # of hours worked was considerable.<br /><br />In terms of the GENDER wage gap...<br />How many women in the US do you think work in &quot;tipped&quot; jobs... waitresses,  bartenders, strippers, etc...?<br />I bet it&#39;s at least a million, and probably more like 2 or 3.<br />I&#39;m also willing to bet that they report FAR LESS than their ACTUAL earnings... so that don&#39;t have to pay as much to the IRS.<br />If 2 or 3 million women are reporting that they ONLY earn 200$/week, when they ACTUALLY make 4-500$/week... well... there goes a lot of the wage gap.<br />THEN... there are... what... about 7-9 million Elem/MS/JHS/HS teachers in the US?  Something like 80-90% female?  Work maybe 10 months per year, full time (technically)... but still 2 months less, and with FAR more holidays, than the usual full time job.",Nyet Zdyec,2020-08-12T03:10:16Z,0

"Here in Nashville, cost of living for housing has LITERALLY doubled in the past 10-12 years. My friends house doubled in value. Wages however have remained almost identically the same. If anything, wages have gone up $1-2/hr at best. Even then, that nowhere near makes up for the giant raise in cost of living. We do have a democratic mayor and a terrible one at that so I believe that has something to do with it. Cost of living here rivals my hometown in California, but wages are like half of that. Also, police here start at only $22/hr. It hasn&#39;t gone up in years, so it&#39;s literally like police pay is going down.",anony mous,2020-08-11T00:26:01Z,0
