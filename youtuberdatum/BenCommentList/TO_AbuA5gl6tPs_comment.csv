"John McCain was a great man and a true American hero, but he was literally a horrific Senator and politician. We should forget the Republican Party. It’s time we gave up on the GOP and formed a new third-party. Up to this point I’ve never believed this was a viable option, but now I’m firmly convinced it’s the only way of breaking away from the swamp. I’d suggest something like the CSSP “Conservative Common-Sense Party”. I’m quite serious. If every American that voted for Trump supported such a change it could happen. Who knows? Maybe President Trump will work to form such a movement over the next two years. I pray he does.",Average Joe,2021-01-24T20:24:58Z,1

"Really disappointing to see all these negative comments. Expect this from the left, but didn&#39;t anticipate seeing it here, and definitely not to this degree. Even judging her looks...what the hell. I find her to be beautiful. And fierce. She takes her ignorant co-workers to school day in and day out. I don&#39;t find her to be unlikable, at all. Anyway... probably wasting my time commenting. But at least there will be a positive floating out here amongst the negatives.",ცཞąŋɖყ,2020-10-06T08:31:09Z,1

"Damn! can this young woman get a break from the criticism? I am a liberal, other than on guns, and I stick up for her on the View comments all the time. It is ironic that liberal women attack her, when I see her as the exact kind of woman that is told she is too much, too bossy, too outspoken, too confident, etc. Is that not exactly the thing liberalism and feminism have fought for? It&#39;s pretty sad when women who consider themselves feminists, bash a woman for being exactly the kind of person we claim to want? That is simply stupid. <br /><br /><br />Then, even on here, Ben Shapiro&#39;s channel, a conservative place, you all are bashing her too?? Why? Because Trump is too much of a dick to have respect for POWs and veterans, so by default her heroic father that somehow threatened the Orange Bitch because he was 100 times the man Trump would ever be, Meghan is the target of both sides? Shame on all of you conservatives that turned on John McCain by Trump orders. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves for dishonoring a true man, patriot, and hero. If you bash McCain, you are an asshole. He chose to stay and be loyal even though it meant permanent physical issues, even though he could have gone home on his father&#39;s status. That rises above party lines. The man was a bad-ass. He was the Maverick. <br /><br /><br />And I believe that is why Meghan seems &quot;too much&quot; to both sides. How dare a woman feel confident enough to speak her mind even when she faces opposition. How dare she feel comfortable coming across with ferocity. I think Meghan is exactly what happens when a girl has a dad that is a true man, and an honorable person who walks his talk and gives his loved ones the same rock-hard devotion to values that many speak about, but very few live out. Meghan annoys people because she is too confident. I don&#39;t agree with her politics. But I like her. She says what she thinks, and that is what happens when a man loves his daughter. You all need to STFU about her. It is gross how everyone attacks her.",Amy Kline,2019-10-20T04:41:18Z,0

"I&#39;m sorry but I really have no time for Meghan McCain. I understand why she has such a deep hatred for 45, given his comment on Vietnam, but the key factor for me, and I suspect many conservatives was McCain was responsible, through spite, for ending any chance of Obama care being fully and cleanly repealed. And he also did nothing on the issue of the wall/borders. I have seen McCain&#39;s campaign adverts where he looks into the camera and says &quot;we need to build the wall&quot;.<br />He said one thing to the voters who elected him, but when in DC&#39;s swamp he &#39;acted&#39; very differently. He was a neo con regime change ideologue and look where this has led America. It&#39;s weird a man who served, like his legendary father, and was captured, tortured, seen appalling death around him, yet he seemed to not see a war he did not want to send the most precious generation into.

"‼️‼️‼️Ben, I am adding this comment to all of your latest shows, even the short snippets put on YouTube and other like channels. I L♥️VE everything you stand for and have had my children follow you on many different platforms.<br />Again, THANK YOU.... from the bottom of my heart!♥️<br />‼️‼️Aside from my own children and God Almighty, Ben Shapiro is my FAVORITE PERSON!!! Ben has NEVER, EVER, EVER said one single thing that I do not totally agree with! I LOVE his reply about being a robot, “I’m just good at my job!” I am a WOMAN (and now a single mother) who lives so far South that I could be in Mexico in 4-5 hours. I have a 19 year old son who is in his 2nd year at a WELL KNOWN College studying to be a veterinarian with 100% of his tuition paid for through scholarships! I have an 18 year old daughter in her Senior year of high school who has a 4.3 GPA who is also athletic AND is on the school dance team. She has SO MANY colleges after her right now, INCLUDING HARVARD! She will be going Pre-Med next Fall. She has always wanted to be a pediatric doctor of some kind since she was about 4 years old. She is set on going into Pediatric Neurology. She will be going to college 100% paid for by scholarships. My youngest son is 14 and has been taking the ACT and PSAT since he was 11 years old! That child has always known that his family has his back 100%. He was always a bit awkward while at school and I’ve had to show my teeth MANY TIMES defending him... The saddest part is that it has always been MOSTLY ADULTS who pick on him!!! I am NOT that crazy mother who thinks her kids can do no wrong, believe me! I have not stepped in every time he has gotten into trouble either... I make him and my other two kids take FULL RESPONSIBILITY for anything they do, good or bad. Sadly, TWO teachers and ONE school staff member have LOST their jobs over their insane behaviors towards my son... He’s EXTREMELY intelligent (170+ IQ) and also tends to have better conversations with adults. ANYWAY... I have always taught my kids to be proud of who they are and that whatever they want to achieve in life is possible. They have grown up from day one being encouraged to be themselves and that no dream is out of reach! I am ONE PROUD MAMA as you can tell! I L♥️VE  Ben Shapiro and introduced my two oldest to him when they had the maturity to hear Ben out on all of the subjects he strongly believes in and speaks about. I was SOOO WORRIED about my oldest son going to college and being crazily chased around and yelled at by hundreds of SJWs... I want to THANK BEN SHAPIRO for truly helping my son understand what SJWs are and teaching him that it is perfectly OK to be a MAN and to be interested in “manly” activities! Thankfully, he had watched a couple years of Ben Shapiro online and was happy about who he  was! My daughter also watches Ben and loves what he stands for. Ben Shapiro has shaped my children’s minds and has made them happy to be who they are. THANK YOU BEN SHAPIRO💜‼️‼️‼️",Robyn Smith,2019-10-13T19:49:22Z,0

President Trump is the right man at the right time. At first I honestly thought he might be another democrat trick coming out of New York. But he has been the best thing for America. The two supreme court Judges alone probably saved America. But the fact President Trump is the only man in Washington that knows democrats use the word &quot; racist&quot; as a tool and doesn&#39;t give in is a giant step for republicans. I cannot believe democrats have been able to use it as a weapon for so long. For 60 years no matter how painfully obvious what they have been doing not one leader would stand up to democrats and simply say &quot; thats your opinion &quot; and not fold like coward.,bassbuckmaster,2019-10-07T20:50:58Z,0

"The problem here is that one does not generally support a candidate because they are a good guy. If Joe Biden is a great guy who does not support conservative values then one who believes that conservative values are best should not support him. The fact that Meghan McCain thinks &#39;Joe&#39; is a nice compassionate person is counterproductive to what she believes. So Meghan McCain believes that abortion is murder but &#39;Joe&#39; thinks that putting a Planned Parenthood center in every high school in the country is not a bad idea then how can she justify voting and politically supporting Joe Biden. Other examples could be given but you get my point. I have had friends run for the offices of mayor, governor and other positions but never supported them because they were my friends and they understood that.<br /><br /><br />Conversely President Trump does not seem to be a wonderful warm person. He does however appoint conservative judges, supports conservative causes and political positions. He acts like an attack dog so you might not want to have lunch with him but as far as conservative values go he earns that conservative vote.",novyttude,2019-10-07T19:28:55Z,0

"I still think her dad was a globalist and did not have the best intentions for this nation.  Also, I don&#39;t see how conservatives such as this can remotely consider themselves conservative.  For example, taxation on our labor is theft and quite opposite from conservative values.  The only constitutional taxation is corporate tax (which almost entirely goes towards policing the world)  There is no way that the Leftist nut jobs could have got to where they are now without decades of help from the Republican party.  As far as Trump&#39;s behavior... tell me which is worse, a smiling politician who is 100% politically correct in their speech, but works to undermine the nation, or someone who says whatever they want about a cesspool of pigs and is the first president in our lifetime to actually do what the people want.  Biden could be considered more politically correct I suppose, so by all means let&#39;s not look at his stealing of our money.  Yeah, let&#39;s vote for Biden, because he&#39;s a corrupt piece of trash, BUT he does it with a smile on his face and doesn&#39;t personally offend as many people.  These kinds of Republicans attack Democrats for their politically correct agenda that&#39;s essentially used to curb free speech, but then they turn right around and stand with Democrats on the exact same agenda because their little feelings get hurt from the words of someone who is as sick and tired of all this bullshit as the rest of us.",Rocco Reid,2019-10-07T14:19:17Z,0

"@Abel Cantu:  from Wikipedia... Valley girl is a socioeconomic stereotype depicting a class of women characterized by the colloquial California English dialect Valleyspeak and materialism.<br /><br />Originally referring to upper-middle class girls from the Los Angeles commuter communities of the San Fernando Valley during the 1980s, the term in later years became more broadly applied to any female in the United States who engendered the associated effects [affects] of ditziness, airheadedness, and/or greater interest in conspicuous consumption than intellectual or personal accomplishment.",John Isett,2019-10-10T04:36:58Z,1

"Not a fan of this family nor of lifetime politicians &amp; their families continuing in their footsteps as Kennedy’s did. That said this was a refreshing side of Megan very human side. Unfortunate how surrounded by social elites, Hollywood, rank &amp; file politicians you all are bc outside that world are normal people who understand P. Trump’s mission. And he is on one that you obviously do not understand. You see he understands what’s at stake: life, liberty, freedom. He understands the minds behind those who want to take it away. I really wish you could get over yourselves long enough to see what your generation is losing. I know. I’ve lived abroad as service member under Pres R Reagan when Russian troops walked the Fulda gap &amp; East Germans were held at the barrel of a gun. I’ve seen Dachau &amp; what was to people there. Not just Jews: anyone who voices an opinion other than Hitler’s. Mass slaughter. Even here, Sherman burning southern states. None of that matters to covetous, corrupt, greedy, power hungry people on the opposite side of freedom. Look at what Russia did to Jews there &amp; to their very own Czar, his family then to millions of their own. I know you don’t care for Yeshua or the NT Ben but look around Jews are coming to knowledge of Him. Do you realize these are all prophesies found in NT? I really hope Megan &amp; Co shares their faith in the Lion of Judah from the tribe of King David with you. He was tried &amp; convicted truth bc He (like Pres Trump) committed no crime. We are guilty for not standing against Truth &amp; tyranny: for agreeing &amp; allowing our children to be taken captive by atrocities that are going on today.

"The problem with this interview is the friendship is too much on display.  Not one tough question was asked and there were so many openings.  They talk of McCain being called a racist during his presidential run.  Well, where was the comparison on this to Trump?  No where.  How about, &quot;Do you hold any empathy for Trump that people are twisting reality with their own opinions to call Trump a racist the same as they did with your father?&quot;  Or how about on February 8th, 2019, it was reported that she criticized Ivanka Trump for going to her dad&#39;s wedding.  &quot;How is this an ethical thing to do?&quot;  Or, &quot;How is this reaction Christian?&quot;  She did a lot of judging Trump and saying she will never forgive him, but where even is the Christianity in that?  This makes me totally understand why she doesn&#39;t understand what Mayor Pete was getting at with babies breathing.  How can you criticize him when you don&#39;t even know where this comes from?  It&#39;s easy to criticize his statement when you know not only the Bible, but reality.  So, Mayor Pete is saying a baby in a womb isn&#39;t breathing?  That&#39;s totally unscientific.  Ben and Meghan&#39;s response on this was a real letdown intellectually as it is easily debunked.  Where was the question about the ethics of trashing Trump at her father&#39;s funeral?  She trashed Trump at her father&#39;s funeral and then criticizes Trump for criticizing her father for betraying all Republicans by voting against getting riding of Obamacare?  So, she can trash Trump at her father&#39;s funeral, but then when George the 1st died, he refused to talk about Trump.  How about a toughball question asking about this hypocrisy?   Something he and all the other Republicans had PROMISED us they would do?  Where is the question that he betrayed and lied to his voters?!  This is such a softball interview and a total letdown.  They should have been holding each other throughout the whole interview.  I appreciate her defense of Trump during these calls for impeachment, but that wasn&#39;t even discussed.  Instead, it was basically an explanation of why she is voting for Biden and how great of a guy he is.  Where were the Biden corruption allegation questions???!!!!  Ben, you let us down in this video.  Don&#39;t let your personal affection for someone prevent you from asking tough questions.  You did no favor to Meghan.  Now she is going to be asked these questions eventually by someone less friendly and she will not be prepared to answer.  Through adversity we improve.  She said she was nervous at the beginning.  Toughen her up with some real questions next time.  I have to give you a rare thumbs down for this interview.  Meghan, I&#39;m not impressed with you.  You judge Trump, but as Jesus said, take the log out of your own eye before judging him.  You say you will not forgive Trump, but your own father endorsed Trump until the locker room video came out.  Now you say it&#39;s unethical to vote for Trump because he isn&#39;t ethical.  My problem is this.  No where is this in Christianity.  It is not found in Christian or Hebrew tradition.  It isn&#39;t even in the Bible.  On the contrary, according to this heresy, we could not vote for King David because he had his lover&#39;s husband murdered.  Two sins far worse than anything Trump has been accused of.  According to this heresy, we could not vote for the Biblical hero Sampson! He was a womanizer.  We could not like King Solomon with all his wives.  We could not like King David with all his wives.  I have to wonder why God never turned his back on these heroes as people like her want us to turn our backs on Trump.",Ondacross,2019-10-06T15:27:04Z,2

As a conservative I have new found respect for Meghan McCain. I actually found myself liking her more over the course of this interview. I support and will vote for Trump- because there is no option and he has stayed true to conservative principles- but I often think he is his own worst enemy.  I remember John McCains thumbs down to repeal Obamacare and think he did this out of spite and stuck a finger in Trumps eye. My major area of disagreement with the interview was her support for Joe Biden. I am sure that he is probably a good guy- but from a political standpoint I really question any of his policy. This is a pivotal election and will determine the direction of American for a generation. Long comment. Sorry,Randall Herman DVM,2019-10-06T14:23:41Z,5
