Everyone that I showed it to, falls over laughing. Unfortunately it is very hard to get someone to watch a video on YouTube about this because it is new and think YouTube is hiding it. I know other people might recommend things like this but, please this time people really need to give it a chance. I swear nobody will regret watch except maybe a liberal democrat. I absolutely am not some spammer. All I need is for maybe you and a couple people to see it and you will just have to share it with someone. Please just give it a chance this one time. Most people are in quarantine so why not? It will definitely brighten alot of days in isolation for people and that is all I want to do, I am not trying to make money on it or anything.
