"Perhaps the best commercial is the one who gets the &quot;right&quot; amount of outrage, the ones that are on the right side of the line so that only a small group gets offended and driven to inform others how bad the commercial is. That way the commercial is spread by word of mouth, the rest of the crowd (who thinks the commercial is ok) will only be reminded about the company which is advertised.",Valpskott,2021-05-08T06:36:29Z,0

"I disliked that you gave the Toyota Commercial a good rating when it had nothing to do with the car but then preceeded to give the next commercial a negative rating. I believe that the Toyota commercial had less to do with the car then the following one had to do with insuarance and with that in mind I believe that the insuarance commercial is better as advertisement. Rating the Toyota commercial as good was nothing but a tool for you to shove a political message in where you talk about abortion, I am pro life but it was ham fisted and exceedingly biased. You also never commented on the man splaining from M&amp;M I noticed. Then to rate the auto commercial as bad this is just propaganda I cannot support.",Jayson Benjamin,2021-04-25T13:54:24Z,0

&quot;First thing Cardi B has ever been in that&#39;s watchable&quot;<br />.<br />Trueee lol.<br />.<br />Most commercials are so bad. It&#39;s sad they have to rely on humor or pointlessly profound ideas nowadays. I guess I&#39;m just one of those weird people who would rather just hear exactly what I&#39;m getting. I&#39;d be more likely to succumb to a 20&#39;s commercial explaining the exact specs of a product than any of this. The majority of commercial themes have literally nothing to do with the product itself. It&#39;s kinda ridiculous.

But this woman in the couple is horrible to her man, why does he stay with her? 2. Messy Cheetos fingers ad I totally agree with Mr Shapiro. One point he missed is that Ashton Kutcher is demonstrating a whipped boyfriend or husband, since disagreeing or calling a wife a liar means sleeping on the couch and no sex for who knows how long! Also, she&#39;s allowed to lie, but when she asks do I look fat in this, he&#39;s not allowed to be honest? 3. Will Ferrell is a God and I now want that car I can&#39;t afford! 4. The m&amp;M&#39;s ad was funny, but the guy who kicked the airplane seat shouldn&#39;t be admitting he did it on purpose, and he should be buying the guy a beer! The man&#39;splaining part and the Karen part were extra funny. I loved that Dan Levy was in this ad. He looks like Mr Shapiro! 5. Bruce middle of the country was dumb and an acting gig. 6. Toyota might&#39;ve been my second to least fave. 7. The whipped out his opinion car insurance ad was a horrible GEICO rip off! Btw Mr Shapiro either has a personality flaw where he doesn&#39;t detect small meanings or show emotion the way the majority of us do, or he is stoic and saving his reactions for the end of a commercial, but I was very surprised he didn&#39;t do a face palm at any of these ads.

If so than both them saying the slogan would have been awesome. Instead it was a clear push to some not OK political BS.<br />The M&amp;M commercial with Mansplaining and Karen. It&#39;s not cool. Keep political crap out of commercials. The Alexa commercial was sexist as fuck, and I agree with Mr. Shapiro. How can you. Like. One sexist commercial, but be outraged by a other because a Man should not act this way, but what bothers me the most. A Woman can be in a commercial and want a mans voice for her sensual pleasure through Alexa. That&#39;s OK. Reverse the genders and people would be highly upset. A man in a commercial is said to whip out an opinion and we know the innuendo and people are pissed.<br />My problem with this is 1. Yes they are jokes. Hell I have a British woman on my android for Google assistant. My Girlfriend has a Australian man&#39;s voice for siri.<br />But with the other commercial it not only shows sexual innuendo&#39;s, but it also shows that a man&#39;s opinion isn&#39;t OK.<br />These are commercials that are spread to millions of people. If they are going to spread information and expect unity than they need to express commercials that are unified within the sexes and races.

Oddly enough, it is significantly easier and faster to get a baby from another country than the US, and a lot of Siberians are white/look pretty standard American. It just goes to show how sad the adoption system works in this country. To put it in perspective, on average you can get a baby from Siberia in under a year, but if you want an American baby it can easily take between 3-5 years especially if you are trying to get a child that is the same race as you. Which it‚Äôs not a racist thing, just most parents typically want a kid that looks like them, helps cements the dream of having a traditional family.",Halfbeard Jones,2021-03-02T09:13:52Z,0

"Whoever that is committing sin is of the devil, I John 3:8 (I John 3:8). If you are into lying, cheating, bitterness, keeping malice, pride, manifesting anger, quarrelling, unforgiving, hatred, envy, contention, strife, bitterness, cursing, speaking evil of others, taking or giving bribe, selfishness, deception, kidnapping, smuggling, falsification of documents, swearing, extortion and other sinful character dispositions, you must repent (Colossians 3:5-9; Romans 1:29-32; Proverbs 6:16-19). <br />Such evil and wicked character will hinder the manifestation of God‚Äôs abundant blessings upon your life. If you are into lust, masturbation, fornication, adultery, prostitution (private or public), patronizing prostitutes, abortion, lesbianism, homosexuality, bestiality, watching pornography (I Corinthians 6:9-10), immoral thoughts or any act of immorality, you need to repent (Galatians 5:19-21; Mathew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUJX8JkdWHM&amp;t=5m28s"">5:28</a>; Mark 7:21-23). Jesus loves you and wants to save you. <br />Visit this church, &#39;THE LORD&#39;S CHOSEN CHARISMATIC REVIVAL MOVEMENT&#39;. <br /><a href=""http://www.tlccrm.org/"">www.tlccrm.org</a> OR <a href=""http://www.tlccrm.org/chosentvOR"">www.tlccrm.org/chosentvOR</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/IamaChosen1"">https://www.youtube.com/user/IamaChosen1</a> <br />Are you into idolatry? Are you into cultism, whether open or secret cult? Do you practice witchcraft or Yoga? Do you smoke cigarette or cannabis? Do you sell them or offer them to people? Do you smoke or sniff hard drugs such as cocaine, heroin, captain black, hashish or other banned drugs or snuff? Are you lusting - lusting after men or women, covetous, alcohol drinking (proverbs 31:4-6)? You must repent, stop them and give your life to Jesus Christ. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. <br />Are you into marry and divorce? Then you are a sinner. Are you married to more than one person? Repent!! Marriage is between a man and a woman. Marriage is for better and for worse until death separates (Matthew 19:3-6). ‚ÄòWherefore they are no more two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together let no man put asunder (separate)‚Äô. Cheating on your wife or husband is sin. Proverbs 28: 13 says, ‚Äò‚ÄòHe that covers his sins shall not prosper...You must repent of them, confess and forsake them (1 John 1:9). <br />Are you into worldliness? Don‚Äôt you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? (James 4:4; II John2:15-17). So, you must stop bleaching your body or painting your mouth, eyes, hands and legs or fixing attachments, weave-on, earrings (Genesis 35:2-4), bangles, chains and frying or perming your hair. Tattooing your body is satanic. Are you one of those that put on nude dresses, short skirts, transparent dresses to seduce men or women (a Seducer or a Promoter of lust is a Sinner ‚Äì Mathew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUJX8JkdWHM&amp;t=5m28s"">5:28</a>) <br /><br />Perhaps you wear trousers as a woman? (Read Deuteronomy 22:5), that is an abomination (Revelation 21:8, 27). Therefore, make up your mind, repent and give your life to Jesus Christ. Are you spoilt? Jeremiah 4:30 says, ‚Äò‚ÄòAnd when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee. They will seek thy life‚Äô‚Äô. (2 Kings <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUJX8JkdWHM&amp;t=9m30s"">9:30</a>; Hosea <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUJX8JkdWHM&amp;t=2m13s"">2:13</a>; Exodus 33:1-6) <br />A Christian is not a Sinner and a Sinner is not a Christian (I John 3:9). If you must be a blessed child of God, then you must repent of your sins and give your life to Jesus Christ. If you believe Jesus Christ today, righteousness of God will come into your life and abundant life will be your portion (1 John 11-12). If you neglect this call to repentance and salvation and die, you will not escape fire of Hell (Hebrews 2:3). It is foolishness and sin to say or think that there is no God (Psalm 14:1; 9:17). Luke 13:3, Jesus said, ‚ÄòI tell you, Nay: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish‚Äô. Cut off every besetting sin (Hebrew 12:1-2; Mark 9:43-48). <br /><br />If you have decided now (2 Corinthians 6:2) to give your life to Jesus Christ and to forsake your sinful lifestyle, please say this prayer: <br />Almighty God, I come unto you in the name of Jesus. Father I confess that I am a sinner. All my sins I confess to you. <br />I am very sorry for all my sins (mention those you can remember). Lord I promise you that from today I will never continue in them anymore. I believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again on the third day for my justification. <br />Almighty God, use the blood of Jesus to wash my sins away. Lord Jesus, come into my heart, be my Lord and personal Saviour. I surrender my life to you. Cancel my name from the books of death and write it in the book of life. Give me power to sin no more. In Jesus name I pray.

"Why take life in our own hands when we could let go of everything and trust God? Living for pleasure and gain doesn‚Äôt matter since death and time erases all your hard work. It‚Äôs all meaningless. Of course, if we don‚Äôt believe in God, whether we live an honest life or not would also be meaningless (Be of no consequence). Now if you take into consideration that there‚Äôs over 2 billion people on earth making their claims that God is real, would you gamble with your life the same way you would with money? Truly, it‚Äôs only when you believe in God, does one‚Äôs life become meaningful. Simply because it now means there will be consequences for your actions. As I say this to you now, not to force anything on you, but to encourage you to at least do your own research. Don‚Äôt gamble with your life.  - William<br /><br />John 3:16<br />‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.‚Äù",Will Brown,2021-02-22T13:31:29Z,0

"I agree the ad about the Paralympic swimmer was very good, but you are seriously so hilarious when you tie everything back to politics. You refer to previous Superbowls where ads showed refutations against capitalism and everyone made it political, and meanwhile insist on creating a political aspect for nearly every commercial that you liked and disliked. As for ‚ÄúThe Middle‚Äù ad, the importance of it was not in the casting of Springsteen, it was in the script. If you would listen to what he‚Äôs trying to say, you would understand the purpose of the ad instead of focusing on one negative quality. Yes, the ad won‚Äôt accomplish much from a political standpoint, obviously, it‚Äôs there to promote an idea that we all hopefully believe in.

Tesla sales was the only American car company was up and with no tax credit. My point is that there is a huge demand for Tesla EVs at least. They are buying them for different reasons like low maintenance cost, fast as hell, not contribute to our dependence on the Middle East.

"@Gary Webb Please, provide evidence. I&#39;m open to evidence. I do think it&#39;s kind of ridiculous that such a small percentage of people have that much money, but I don&#39;t think giving their money to the government is the right solution. Personally, I&#39;m a Christian, and I firmly believe that it is extremely difficult for anyone who holds that much wealth to be a Christian. But I also don&#39;t believe it is right for people to recieve things they don&#39;t need without working for it. In a perfect (read: wholely christian) world, the rich would give out their money to anyone who truly needed it. But this is so far from a perfect world, it&#39;s funny. So who is to be trusted to use money in ways that benefit people who actually need it? Certainly not the government. And how do you raise that money without capitalism? Please, give me some opinions.",Fox Lord,2021-03-07T23:48:30Z,0

The only one which concerned the actual game play was KC scoring their first field goal which gave them their only lead of the game, which happened halfway through the first quarter. The other was the Toyota commercial which heralded both adoption and loving and encouraging kids with disabilities, in order to enable more kids to grow up and compete for whatever goals that they desire to work for in their lives. Here&#39;s hoping that 2022&#39;s Super Bowl game will be MUCH better as far as the actual game play is concerned, and that many more companies will follow Toyota&#39;s example of this year, and produce many more commercials next year which will make people smile rather than cringe, and which will uplift the human spirit.",b54 b,2021-02-19T13:57:35Z,0

"The Toyota commercial was a nice story with a good message, but I would call it a shitty commercial because it has nothiing to do with Toyota.<br />Never been a big fan of ads that go &quot;Funny joke funny joke funny joke BUY OUR CAR!&quot; (same with &#39;sad stuff&#39; instead of funny joke, or emotional scene, moral message, etc). <br />At least try to make them somewhat linked to the product (and I mean, more than the vague &#39;Oh btw we support Team USA&#39; thing Toyota did).",newp gaston,2021-02-18T20:34:01Z,1

"Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />1: Alexa commercial - agree 100% with Ben. It would be fun to live in a world where we are not so jaded that we can&#39;t enjoy this commercial, but my first thoughts were &quot;reverse that and see the world burn&quot;.<br /><br />2: State Farm - meh<br /><br />3: Electric Cars - like Ben said, it&#39;s cute but def too long. However, when electric cars can get 600+ miles to the charge I&#39;ll get one. Less moving parts. No oil changes. It just makes sense. But when I can only drive for 3 hours at a clip...nah. I&#39;ll wait. But th commercial is cute, just too long.<br /><br />4: Cheetos - horrible commercial. Not funny. Not a bit.<br /><br />5: Wayne&#39;s World - only thing I would change is that twat CartiB or whatever her name is. That bitch is naaaaaaaasty. Takes what would otherwise be a great experience and ruins it.<br /><br />6: M&amp;M - very good commercial. cute. well written with a nice payoff. And if you haven&#39;t watched Schitt&#39;s Creek with Dan Levy you should. Very well written. A bit sappy at the end of the series but really worth watching. Dan Levy has a boyfriend he marries in the show so you would think &quot;gay message&quot; but it&#39;s not. He specifically was asked about how come the town never reacts to it and he said in the world he creates nobody care. I wanted so much to tell him that THAT IS the world he lives in. Nobody cares! The gay movement people act like they are still in 1950 where they are discriminated against and hated. I&#39;m a straight white 51-year-old southern conservative and so are the vast majority of my friends and family. Nobody cares. Really...I&#39;ve never believed the gay movement people wanted only &quot;tolerance&quot;. Once they got it, they wanted people to &quot;appreciate and respect&quot; that they are gay when really...nobody cares. Okay, off my soapbox.<br /><br />7: Jeep - if anything made me NOT want to buy a jeep it&#39;s this commercial. It&#39;s really hard to stomach. A socialist liberal telling me I need to meet him in the middle is rich. These are the people of cancel culture. The middle to a leftist is left-of-them. No...I am not meeting a socialist &quot;in the middle&quot;. How about you come about 275 steps to the right, Bruce. Preach about the working class to the rest of you millionaire-for-the-last-40-years friends. Doesn&#39;t work for me. And someone should tell Jeep that NOBODY sees Springsteen as a man-of-the-people anymore. &quot;Fear has never been the best of who we are&quot;? Bruce...tell that to the millions and millions of people who are afraid to say something as &#39;horrible&quot; as &quot;there are two sexes and they can&#39;t be changed&quot;. Asshole.<br /><br />8: Robinhood - boring. Nothing against it, it&#39;s just boring.<br /><br />9: Toyota - everything Ben said. I thought &quot;what a great pro-Life message and I&#39;m sure they didn&#39;t intend that&quot;. And he backed me up.<br /><br />10: Cure - agreed with Ben. It was really try-hard. meh.",Van Garnett,2021-02-18T15:36:26Z,0

"This video could be potentially thought provoking... If only the rapid speech and very unclear diction of all in it was intelligible. I could hardly make out a word of what they were saying, so none of these ads etc would have affected me at all, other than to cause a bit of &quot;noise annoyance&quot; I could easily switch off or turn down to an inaudible volume level until it&#39;s all over, like I do every time the ABC in Australia broadcasts or some politically correct You Tube video or ad about feminist or multicultural etc shit comes on. It must be because we&#39;re Australians and, kind of a bit slow and behind the American modern times  and used to the Aussie drawl slow speech that I found it hard to make head nor tail of any of this video, though I can usually understand most Yanks when they speak with that twangy accent. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but I thought ads are supposed to be to induce us to some sort of action eg do this, buy that, think this, vote for him support her etc. But, how are we dumb sheep population supposed to know which way to go from such ads? When we can&#39;t even make out what they&#39;re telling us because they are completely senseless and unintelligible? Maybe these players need to get some elocution training to learn to speak clearly, even in American twang accent, which is OK if clearly articulated, go to Hollywood or something... They are dreadful. Even our most crappy, boring, bird brained, politically correct Aussie feminist ads promoting things like the most unsunscreeny  sunscreen ever (for sunscreen cream), are not this bad, though probably more annoying. Because we can clearly make out what these young females in the ad are saying, even if it is utterly bird brained stupid. Well, they are young girls, after all...

The problem with an issue like abortion is that both sides care more about profiting from it than solving it.  Instead of the GOP raising money on the promise to outlaw abortion and then refusing to do so even when they have majorities what if the GOP spent the next 20 years correcting the adoption laws which force people to go to Siberia to adopt for fear lawyers will show up 3 years later with the American birth mother and demand blackmail?  What if the GOP spent their time and effort celebrating adoption as <b>THE RIGHT CHOICE?</b>  What if the GOP ran ads showing that 30 yr old woman with 2 small children looking at herself in a mirror and knowing that she had a <i>hard choice</i> to make when she was 17 and pregnant and unprepared.  But she made the <i>right choice</i> and that child grew up with a loving family just like her kids will now?  What if it was as easy to give a child up for adoption and to adopt a child as it is to get an abortion?  In the end it might not even be necessary to outlaw abortions since they would be so rare and stigmatized that cases of rape and incest were actually the overwhelming majority of cases.,Robert Anderson,2021-02-17T20:45:24Z,0

"I totally get your thoughts on the ‚ÄúRe-United‚Äù commercial and equally thought it fell flat. Just a couple of counterpoints to your specific points - both parties use ‚Äúunity‚Äù to mean ‚Äúshut up,‚Äù so when you say you hate when people do that, just hoping you mean when it‚Äôs done on both the left and the right (perhaps you do). As for Colin Kaepernick - he was kneeling for the anthem in the context of an NFL game in particular, not the flag. Yes the flag was there, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs his practice to kneel for the flag in general lol. Like I don‚Äôt think he just kneels in public when he sees US flags - so again sign that it‚Äôs not the flag he was kneeling for. But I guess even if it was, would that be disrespectful? (I know this point has already been battered 1000 times in both left and right media so maybe it‚Äôs not worth bringing up again) But just putting it out there that I genuflect like that as a Christian in front of the cross and it‚Äôs a sign of simultaneous awe, gratefulness, and sadness.

"the Will Ferrel one totally misses the point. Electric vehicles that run on power from fossil fuels are NOT the answer. You want to save the world? Build nuclear power plants! get rid of all the coal and most of the natural gas power plants only then does electric vehicles become a viable means of reducing carbon emissions. We don&#39;t have the battery tech to store power from solar panels. In California we have this problem.. IN the summer daytime hours we produce WAY more than we need, however that power production drops off around 5 pm just as PEAK demand picks up. So natural gas power plants kick on, which increases the CO2 output for the day. Wind farms kill birds they have an exemption from the government because the endangered species act! Hydroelectric power, geothermal and ocean wave power are the only true constant green energy sources, so we NEED nuclear power. Then there is Liquid salt reactors which seem to be the best overall, however they have their own issues that must be worked out before they can be used everywhere. So until battery tech is good enough to store power for MONTHS, and we have FUSION power, nuclear energy is the ONLY known way to save the planet!",dwayne fien,2021-02-16T21:54:34Z,0

I hated the Toyota commercial and here‚Äôs why I completely agree with the message but it is an ad something to get you to buy their product and they want us to buy a Toyota simply because they can play a heart worming message not because they have a good product and so in reality if all they wanted to do was promote this cause out of the kindness of their hearts why did they need to make it an ad for Toyota why not make it a anonymous ad but no they chose to make it an ad for themselves which means they are using this to gain from something that should not be used for their own financial gain,Logan Redmon,2021-02-16T11:03:25Z,0

"I believe the ad refers to the American Paralympic swimmer Jessica Long. The ad essentially is about someone taking the risk to do something not entirely popular, let alone something minimally feasible, for the simple reason that the one taking the risk believes that something good will come of it, solely by dint of the fact that that person possess hope and strength, and that that person believes that that hope and strength can, will, and therefore ought be carried over into the expected good outcome warranted by the initial strong hopeful taking of the risk. <br /><br />Apparently, so does Toyota - &quot;Proud Partner of Team USA&quot;. <br /><br />IMHO:<br />The risk in question is adoption from a foreign country - specifically, from Russia, and particularly from Siberia.<br />The good that comes out of it is the adoption of the child into the family - specifically, the adoption of the young Russian girl from Siberia into the adoptive family. <br />The person possessing hope and strength is the prospective adopted mother who, out of the apparent sole desire to gift her love to her prospective adopted daughter, chooses to adopt this girl against all apparent conceivable doubt that anything good will come out of it. <br />The good outcome warranted by the strength and hope in the prospective adoptive mother is effected largely by the gifting of this strength and hope from her to her adopted daughter [without the transfer thereof, obviously], which good outcome is manifestly obviously apparent in the Toyota commercial.<br /><br />The commercial checks out: it&#39;s a true story. A simple Google search of the name of the swimmer in question will verify this. <br /><br />I agree with Mr. Shapiro: this is a very good ad. <br /><br />It got even better for me once I did a quick online search on the name (with qualifiers) that I gleaned from the commercial.",One Eighth of Taciturn Brooding Depression,2021-02-16T03:53:14Z,0

"The jeep one wasn&#39;t that bad tbh, I mean it&#39;s disingenuous but most commercials are so it&#39;s nothing special. It looks cool and says &quot;hey we&#39;re all American, buy Jeep&quot; so I think it&#39;s fine. The fact it&#39;s bias towards a DNC member who has nothing to do with being a cowboy is something most people won&#39;t pick up on, and happens in every commercial and every other event anyway.<br /><br />The M&amp;M one was clever, not a 10/10 by any means, but it was solid<br /><br />The swimming one was fine as well, but also a bit preachy. I think it only appealed to Ben because of his political beliefs.<br /><br />The Alexa one was weird, but not horrible. Agree that if it was a man it&#39;d be different, but it wasn&#39;t, and we all process it as fine but kinda weird so whatever, it advertised their product. The goal is to get people talking about it and have a positive spin on their product while being memorable. Despite being kinda dumb and weird, it was probably effective.<br /><br />The cheetos and car commercial were just kinda cringe, but not the worst.

"Two things that you don&#39;t seem to have picked up: 1. The actor in the commercial is notoriously known for talking down to those he doesn&#39;t agree with politically, and 2. Half of the political spectrum, to which you can generally assume marketing agencies belong, has not given a whit about unity until they can use it as a battering ram.<br /><br />With those things in mind and the general behavior of those who have been crying &quot;unity&quot; in the past weeks, it is easy to take this commercial as a cynical and hypocritical jab. Many of those calling for unity have also been gathering persecution lists of people they don&#39;t agree with. Is that unity?<br /><br />If you&#39;re not aware of any of that, it seems like a nice commercial calling for people to meet in the middle, otherwise, not so much.",Cyber Taco,2021-02-16T16:22:49Z,1

Your response was good and correct and made good point that I agree fully. Would you agree that even idea of communism is bad not everyone want s the same things lake that lake house I would not want to live next to a lake even the choose of some other places such as a nice large condo in the city now if there was a lake next to this condo in a metropolitan city sure I would take and like very much while others hate living in a city while under communism we all would be forced to like the same type of buildings and styles. I like condos but others do not and under communism maybe everyone gets a condo like place to live in whether they like it or not and that is assuming a false utopian society that could never be achieved because of the reasons you outlined and others such as greed, power, sloth/laziness which you mentioned, killing out of jealousy and/or fear etc...

"@Black Hawk True, and those who have used violence to silence the opposition are now, and virtually always have been a dictatorship of some type or some type of complete governmental control. Much like the U.S. when people consistently refer to us as a democracy. I&#39;m sure you know that we are not, we are a Constitutional Republic, and there is a huge difference. An actual democracy would be akin to two wolves and a lamb voting in what to have for dinner. Every country in history as well as currently that has tried socialism has failed massively in the good of it&#39;s citizens. On paper socialism/communism is a virtual utopian society, but greed and laziness are two inherent natures of the human race. In order to achieve socialism, and it work, each would receive the same. The major flaw in that theory is that if I&#39;m not going to get anymore than you, and I&#39;m not going to get any less, why work hard or attempt to put forth any innovative ideas? Sure there is the chance one could become powerful in the government but that is about where it ends. Socialized health care is a great idea, if you never get anything more than a cold. There is no incentive to go to school for 8 years and spend 4 as an intern when you get nothing more thus creating a shortage of doctors and nurses. <br />    My son made the mistake of reading the communist manifesto when he was about 17. He and I had literally hundreds of discussions on the subject. I asked him one day okay you have a society that has lake. Everyone builds the others houses. What happens when my house is built and I decide I&#39;m not going to help build anymore. Who get the house by the water, the doctor or the sewage worker. He says the doctor because he is more important and saves lives. Really? So the sewage worker says okay screw you I&#39;m leaving this society and now you have no sewage worker so what happens?  Pestilence and death because the doctor only saves lives once they are sick, the sewage worker kept them from getting sick to begin with so I say the sewage worker is more important. His attitude changed once he got out into the work force and busting his ass while he watched others do barely what was needed to not get fired and made the same money he did. When there is no real incentive to work hard, there are few that will work hard and thereby killing innovation, moral, and any desire to try to rise higher.",BumInTheSun,2021-02-19T17:00:59Z,0

And if you argue &quot;then why didn&#39;t you vote for a different candidate besides biden or trump who you actually like&quot;, It&#39;s because realistically none of those other candidates had the backing to win, so it is smart to vote out of the two candidates likely of winning.",wishie washie,2021-02-25T21:32:40Z,0

"@Green _ Goddess I might be missing what your saying, but, when you say &quot;open and safe&quot; what are &quot;your&quot; statistical chances of not being safe? I don&#39;t mean your Grandma&#39;s that they got you to avoid the past year, I mean based on your age and health how safe is normal life for you? For me it&#39;s 100% safe. I already had Covid-19 and so did about 20% of my neighbors and even 78 year old dad with lung cancer, we are all fine and ready to keep on living. Covid-19 is high right now, yes, if Grandma wants to stay in let her stay in and care for her. <br /><br />At the start of all this someone said, &quot;We should ask the weak and elderly if they want to stay in and the rest of us should work more to make sure that can be possible by bringing them food and stepping into their jobs so &quot;they&quot; can take a leave from work.&quot; Why are we &quot;all&quot; being told to stay in? That wisdom didn&#39;t hit me till people went from understanding we were slowing the curve to being brainwashed into thinking it was never get ill and turn in your neighbor in out of fear that they are not obeying. Obey what? None of it has been logical. My dad got ill in an N95, everyone always masked around him, he only left his home for medical appointments. Yep, he had four days treatment in the hospital and said fear of Covid-19 was far worse. Yes, others of his health and age are very likely to die but peoples fear of death got used against them to stop living.  <br /><br />A church, meaning gathering of believers, have people with wisdom, ideas, and God&#39;s power and presence. There are people who have for cancer to be healed and they are healed, that&#39;s what we need, that&#39;s what my Dad was blessed to get back to, faith, and be healed. Don&#39;t hear me saying Covid-19 isn&#39;t real or is gone. It&#39;s only gone in the eyes of the news while it&#39;s at a huge PEAK under Biden that we seem to ignore. 1,723 people died on Tuesday. At that rate we would have 6 times a bad flu year in 365 days but it&#39;s actually going to be on the decline because all flus gain herd immunity after about 18 months. However, when people were freaking out the most the death toll was miniscule comparatively but it was all Trumps fault. It was all political and used against us. Even the very real issues caused by covid were more so caused by covid fear and panic from nursing shortages to shortages of supplies. We need to pray against peoples paranoia. My dad and others who went to the hospital said the nurses were made fearful, hopeless, and clouded about reality. Yeah, it&#39;s bad, but it&#39;s nothing like it&#39;s painted. Nothing is like it&#39;s painted. <br /><br />I hated Trump based on media lies and their random clips that made him seem dumb till the lies against him this summer were lies against my own city and the news just stood their lying and letting evil run ramped while Biden and news called it good words and painted the most nasty of lies that they wanted people to believe no matter who it hurt. Trump was the only one who cared. Trump is not perfect but he is not the bad guy. Trump never started a riot, Biden did several times. I would say that and explain it even if I got taken to court over it. What I witnessed was even black cops doing their job in Milwaukee/Tosa but the allowed narratives were to use that to claim it must be Trump and these cops are racist murderers and Biden even stood on stage so lie filled or out of touch that he called a minority run group a white surpppepnimsist group and honestly he should be sued for slandering them. That type of political nonsense actually baited murders, stabbings, hate, division, and more lies all for seeming politics. Evil!",S. Rose,2021-02-17T08:18:32Z,0
"@Green _ Goddess BLM has nothing to do with unity. It is a Democrat and media praised multi-million dollar organization that is used to use people. If they didn&#39;t gain a billion or more I would be shocked and we all know much of it went to Democrats. Ironically, Biden who supported him with words all summer will no longer associate or hear them. I remember back when the BLM teens lit a gas station on fire with people inside under Obama and their website had the spoken goal to break up families. Dems must have gotten them to cool that for a bit.

"1:  I often agree with Ben, and am very pro-life.    But, OBJECTIVELY... if the Toyota commercial had nothing to do with cars... there was nothing remotely car related there.  It was just political propaganda (which I appreciate, and agree with).   But when companies spend their time making social/political points that have nothing to do with the product they&#39;re advertising, and they&#39;re not points we would make, we consider it a garbage ad and we think they&#39;re horrible people for pushing political ideologies.   We should be consistent and EITHER respect all companies who might want to spend their advertising dollars putting out a message they believe in OR consistently reject ideological ads, even when we agree with them.<br /><br />I&#39;m in favor of free speech, and letting companies express their values.  (See all the crazy Thai life insurance commercials that drives everyone to tears because they have more emotional content than most full-length movies in America).<br /><br />2:  The Bruce Spingstein commercial... if the EXACT same script would have been read with someone with a red hat after a republican were elected, he&#39;s be applauding it.

Dear Fiat: Dirt is generally frozen solid in the winter. Cowboy boots are awful in snow. You will fall down.... a lot. This is why no one wears them in the snow. They&#39;re also exceptionally cold. Driving a Jeep without a roof in the winter is a sign of both pandering and cultural disconnect. Spruce Bingsteen is a Leftist. You hate church. Kansas voted for Trump. Running your fingers through the dirt is something only the Left thinks Mid-westerners do. If we actually did run out fingers through the dirt it would be to examine it for moisture content prior to field work/planting. This would be a dumb thing to do in the dead of winter since it would be frozen solid. The Red Star is a symbol of Chinese communism.,Jay Bee,2021-02-13T17:45:45Z,0

"Ben just a quick correction,  Shaggy It Wasnt Me song wasnt popular 3 years ago ... it was released in 2000 lol . Only 21 years ago .<br /><br />Also the JEEP Bruce Springsteen commercial.  As of yesterday I heard that Jeep canceled this commercial cause Bruce recently got arrested for DWI but was wrongfully arrested.  The story goes Bruce was riding his motorcycle and a few fans recognized Bruce and waved him over . The fans then have a drink or as I heard a shot with Bruce and then he leaves riding on his motorcycle.  A cop witnessed all this and pulls Bruce over and arrested him on DWI . If u thought that was messes up it gets worse . The legal limit for alcohol is .08 , well Bruce blew a .02 ...  well under the legal limit yet still got arrested for DWI.  I see this either being dropped or a big lawsuit coming . So Ben u will be happy to know your least favorite commercial Jeep with Bruce has been canceled lol. Fun fact.... I&#39;m from NJ and Bruce did not learn to farm from here.

"The EV commercial is cute and pointless at the same time.<br /><br />Nearly all (97%) of Norway&#39;s electrical production comes from established hydro-electric installation and renewables. The USA uses about 65% fossil fuel to generate the electricity for &quot;green&quot; things like EVs.<br /><br />The critical point in the ad is that Norway is beating the US in EVs measured PER CAPITA.<br /><br />Norway has a population of about 5.5 million (similar to Colorado but with 100,000 sq kms more land area). Of that, about 4.1 million are of legal driving age (+16) and may have drivers licenses. About 230 million Americans have drivers licenses.<br /><br />There are only 465,000 EVs in Norway compared to 1.4 million in the USA.  And there are still about 2.4 million petroleum passenger cars in the country. There are 264 million cars in the US.<br /><br />The World Bank ranks Norway as the richest country in the world per capita from an economy based on petroleum and natural resources. <a href=""https://www.newsinenglish.no/2018/02/05/norway-is-now-the-richest-in-the-world/"">https://www.newsinenglish.no/2018/02/05/norway-is-now-the-richest-in-the-world/</a>   <br />Oil production is through the state owned company Statoil and is not part of OPEC. Profit flows directly to the government.<br /><br />And those mountains in the background of the ad (albeit Sweden) hold huge additional hydro potential as needed.<br /><br />Electrifying Norway is logical, simple and affordable compared to the US and many other places.<br /><br />As shown in the ad, comparing Norway&#39;s energy situation with the USA is best presented by a comedian. Cute ad.<br /><br />Disclaimer to eco-pozers: That ad is not a documentary and is meant for entertainment purposes only. Facts don&#39;t care about your green feelings.

There has always always always been a double standard between men and women in America. A woman can drool over a sexy chiseled man without his shirt on and it&#39;s &quot;OK&quot; but if a man stares and drools over a sexy woman in a skimpy bikini he is labeled a pig and sexist.,J W,2021-02-12T20:22:14Z,0
"As someone who grew up in Springsteen&#39;s current hometown, I can assure you that it was at one time very much a farm town. These days, it&#39;s horse farms, but in seventies and eighties it was regular farms. There&#39;s a reason New Jersey is called the Garden State. :)  Where Springsteen lives was at one time an exotic animal farm, and he&#39;s well known for driving old trucks around. Gorgeously and expensively restored old trucks, but old trucks nevertheless, heh.",Patricia Beninato,2021-02-12T20:18:56Z,0

"Ben,  I don&#39;t agree with you regarding the &quot;opinion&quot; commercial.  You are forgetting the &quot;golden rule&quot; that determines a commercials success or failure.  The rule: Do or say something controversial that piggybacks on a current social debate or narrative and people will talk about it for weeks, with the hope that they will remember the brand!  This works.  It doesn&#39;t necessarily  need to make sense.  It just needs to disrupt the current narrative and keep people talking.  I am not so sure this commercial achieved that goal.  But,  it was very funny and clever if you understand that it is poking  fun of the current cancel culture, censorship, big tech, political correctness, fake news, and the liberal left because of its sarcastic slant using the word &quot;opinion&quot;!  Then it hits with the company logo, etc..

I am 80% pro life, 20% pro choice at this point. I do think it&#39;s the woman&#39;s body, she has a say in what happens with it. That said, abortion is not a form of birth control, and you don&#39;t get to abort a baby a month before it is born. When you find out your pregnant, make a choice. I digress.<br />I would wonder, since Ben is pro life, and there are woman out there that do have the baby, but put the baby up for adoption, many of the children that are adopted (I don&#39;t have exact stats on that) are adopted, by homosexual couples.

I think it was actually about representing disabled people. It could&#39;ve been a pro life commercial if they added a part with an ultrasound result and the doctor discussing then the parents putting the kid up for adoption. But just like you criticized the Robin Hood commercial for being unrelated to investment, the Toyota commercial was actually MORE unrelated, because they didn&#39;t even talk about cars. If Toyota wanted to relate their cars to disabled people, they should&#39;ve showed some kind of special doors, seats and/or pedals in a new car that you can get if you&#39;re disabled.

I‚Äôm surprised Ben had no complaints about the mansplaining ad,Jason Lewis,2021-02-11T14:26:10Z,27
"I think mansplaining is assuming a woman doesn&#39;t know something just because they&#39;re a woman. I have not experienced this yet. The only way to prove that it was happening is if, after a long period of time, you observe someone only explaining things to women when men who are in the same position (i.e. at work) do not have this explanation - or perhaps that it is obvious what a word means, so it&#39;s insulting. But obviously women can abuse this - just like humans overuse words and phrases until they lose their substance. A Series of Unfortunate Events comes to mind, where the children would get irritated when an adult tried to explain the meaning of a word. So some women may have a perception that men do the same thing - whether true or not. Since I have yet to clearly experience this prejudice myself, I don&#39;t know whether it exists as much as these feminists claim.",C K,2021-02-14T08:55:41Z,0

"I think mansplaining is assuming a woman doesn&#39;t know something just because they&#39;re a woman. I have not experienced this yet. The only way to prove that it was happening is if, after a long period of time, you observe someone only explaining things to women when men who are in the same position (i.e. at work) do not have this explanation - or perhaps that it is obvious what a word means, so it&#39;s insulting. But obviously women can abuse this - just like humans overuse words and phrases until they lose their substance. A Series of Unfortunate Events comes to mind, where the children would get irritated when an adult tried to explain the meaning of a word. So some women may have a perception that men do the same thing - whether true or not. Since I have yet to clearly experience this prejudice myself, I don&#39;t know whether it exists as much as these feminists claim.",C K,2021-02-14T08:53:26Z,0

I&#39;m a true independent from the Missouri/Arkansas line, &amp; I watch that Jeep commercial &amp; it reminds me of my own life in many ways...<br />But then I hear Ben going off on a tangent about it, &amp; it sadly reminds me of how both the Red &amp; the Blue both hate my guts just as they choose to hate each others&#39;, only except for every 4 years or so when they might need our vote - but once our vote is counted then both sides go back to hating us scabs all over again - truth is Republicans are just as Identity Politics as Democrats are, everyone&#39;s politics have suddenly &amp; sadly become their entire existence... Every group is perpetually hell-bent on hating some other group &amp; determined to never change that fact any, unless it is to go ever deeper into that downward spiral - no matter what they occasionally profess their intentions to be, because they always end up showing their inner darkness in their words &amp; thoughts, eventually.<br />We are ALL screwed - Red &amp; Blue both bring out the worst in us all.<br />It&#39;s too sad - even just the word &quot;politics&quot; makes my soul saddened anymore üò¢üòüüòûüòî",Jason Robertson,2021-02-11T03:04:32Z,0

"Besides the Alexa Ad portraying the husband as a pathetic, passive, pussified chump, what&#39;s unsettling is exactly what Ben points out...reverse the genders (husband fantasizes Scarlett Johannson as the Alexa &quot;vessel) and there would be an immediate, anti-male, snowflake-triggered backlash of A-Bomb proportions...pointing out how sexist and demeaning the ad was toward women. You know this is true when your own society relegates you to that of an animal, wherein men, as a whole, cannot be trusted to sit next to a child on a freaking plane. The level of maligned suspicion and unwarranted disrespect required to create such a policy is matched only by the level of malevolence displayed in facilitating it&#39;s enactment.",John Carlson,2021-02-11T01:11:57Z,0

"Not to mention, the Amazon one is saying its okay to have idols where you&#39;re worshipping them which is wrong Biblically. Both in the OT and NT. Also the &quot;reuniting of the United States&quot; seems like a hidden message of similar to oh umm what Germany did or rather Nazis. And what is the democratic party doing? Censorship and cancel culture like Nazis did. Also getting the media and lots of people in the entertainment world to back them. Actors who were once conservative and now are left leaning because of what was handed to them politically (biased news media). Proof of this happening you say?? Well a celebrity chose to back a anti-sex trafficking nonprofit for some kindness thing to charities but backed out because of media lies instead of doing their own research last year.",Michael Wagoner,2021-02-10T17:46:39Z,0

- Show woman objectifying man as empowering.  Make it a black woman and the &quot;intersectionality&quot; puts it beyond criticism. - Amazon<br />- Portray white American as slobby and incompetent.  Bring two respectable diverse people on quest to make it legitimate. - GM<br />- Show white people adopting reggae culture to be legitimate.  Diversity empowers white woman to prevail. - Cheetos<br />- Show that black woman will bring legitimacy to classic white male comedy act. - Uber eats<br />- Reinforce stereotypes; ‚Äúmansplaining‚Äù and ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù - M&amp;Ms<br />- Use left wing icon to appeal to the religious Right and implore them to move to the middle. - Jeep<br />- Portray men as objectifying and women as empowered. - Cure auto insurance,Ron G,2021-02-10T17:01:41Z,14

The Toyota commercial was a bad as the others......you said it yourself. If you turned the volume down you would have no idea that was a car commercial until the end when Toyota comes up on the screen. Great message......terrible commercial. You could have put any corporate logo at the end of a lot of those commercials and it would have been no different. At the very least the Alexa commercial revolved around using the product.

Ben...the REAL issue is Biden being in Office illegally and that no one will look at the physical documented evidence of voter fraud....nothing else matters.

"The insurance commercial is bad but the Toyota commercial is great? You JUST got through telling us if you muted the talking in some commercials you wouldn&#39;t know what they were selling. That describes the Toyota commercial exactly. So if a commercial tugs your heart strings without even having anything to do with the product it is selling it is a great commercial? What does adoption have to do with buying a car? If they were selling adopt a foreign kid then great! It was a great commercial. Prolife? A great commercial! Buy a Toyota? WTH?

"Ben being pro choice doesn&#39;t mean you think anyone should be aborted for their condition. It only means that you believe that the person who is going to be responsible for this potential person in the future can decide that for themselves. <br /><br />You are already killing hundreds of potential people by not trying to have sex every second of every day. Some of those people could be olympic swimmers, others could be Hitler.<br /><br />Not to mention abortion radically improves quality of life in third world countries where otherwise children would just starve to death. It also allowed the impoverished in America to escape poverty.  If you have a child before you finish high school, get a stable job and get married you are dooming yourself to the cycle of poverty. It&#39;s easy to make a mistake but not all mistakes have to define your life. <br /><br />Government shouldn&#39;t infringe on people&#39;s rights.",princeofexcess,2021-02-10T11:37:55Z,1

Jake was a 5 second 1 line part that we hilarious because of the set up and his blandness.<br /><br />Even if they were going to just race swap him, then hire a black nerd or someone who is deadpan and isn&#39;t in on the joke... the &quot;straight man&quot; as it were, not eye candy.",ravissary79,2021-02-10T16:20:47Z,7

"My two cents: the first advert for Alexa is designed to undermine marriage; the second advert is incomprehensible; the third advert is a moronic appeal for Americans to copy Scandinavian socialism; the fourth advert is another sly appeal to extra-marital sex and race baiting; the fifth is an appeal to normalizing the transvestite mania with the dubious and talentless Cardi B; the M&amp;M&#39;s is a textbook example of every woke prejudice and stereotyping imaginable; the Jeep advert is an attempt to use patriotism and Christianity in the service of lame duck policies which have bankrupted America morally and financially; the Robin Hood is mystifying; the Toyota advert is actually about buying cars from Japan to stop rising sea levels as well as adoption; the double entendre of opinion is done in as charmless and unfunny way as possible with men caricatured as being either narcissistic or wimps.

"@Jonttuf17 I understand what you&#39;re saying. However, what Ben is saying still holds truth. As you said you can certainly call for unity whilst holding different viewpoints in how to run a country or state. There&#39;s no argument there. However, the issue is that Biden and his fellow Democrats are not calling for unity. They&#39;re calling for conformity. You can&#39;t call for unity while trying to infringe on constitutional rights. They go after conservative views, the second amendment, and religious freedom. Instead of saying we all disagree on policies, but we&#39;re all American. They stand on the idea of; if you disagree with us then you&#39;re the problem and have to be silenced because they&#39;re gradually conflating conservatism with any extremist viewpoint.

Third, if you are more than 2 persons, you can in the rush hour drive in the bus lane and cut in the traffic. Oslo with suburban towns hold about 1,5M people. And when youi can buy a car without VAT, you don&#39;t pay for the roads, and you can drive in the bus lane, boom! You have a carrot for buying electrical.

"i am a farmer and the jeep ad was just weird, i want to know why the horse was loose while saddled up, you dont leave your horse unattended out of a pasture. i mean his costume was pretty accurate, it was just way to clean, and his hands were to soft, so he can&#39;t pass as a farmer to anyone who knows what a farmer looks like, my hands are super rough, and my fingernails always have dirt under them, my hands are also brown a lot of the time from how dirty they are, my knuckles are black when i come in from a day of work. my clothes are also always covered in dirt and animal hair, they are never clean like his, my clothes pretty much all have mud stains on them. it isn&#39;t an easy life, and i&#39;m sick of companies making it look easy, or trying to appeal to us by having some city slicker pretend to be country. the discipline, humility, and work ethic needed are intense, we rely on nature to keep us afloat, Bruce Springsteen will never know how much work the country people, who are mostly conservatives, put in to get him food on the table. i&#39;m sure he eats good food since he has the money, but that came from someone&#39;s hard work. he doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to sit up all night with a sick and cold baby animal to have it die in your arms, he hasn&#39;t gone out to feed his goats to find the baby one had in the middle of the night frozen solid, sorry if that is disturbing to some of you but that&#39;s life, he doesn&#39;t understand what that is like, despite the common misconception we aren&#39;t heartless. we don&#39;t feel nothing when an animal dies, the reason we&#39;re able to raise meat animals is because we go into it knowing what they are. we go into it knowing that they will die. it still hurts, it is still weird to feed an animal, to care for it for weeks, or months, and then it&#39;s gone. and the animals that aren&#39;t meat animals we love fiercely, milk cows, goats, horses, dogs, we love those animals with a fire ignited by god our creator. when we loose a goat, or a horse, or a dog, our family is devastated, we move on but it hurts, my younger brother is the most sensitive when it come to this kind of thing, i mean it happens, we know that but it still hurts. my horses are my best friends, the work i put into them to get them to where they are is my greatest achievement. i love my goats and i hate when i find one of them injured, we have lost animals and yeah it sucks, but we move on, something a lot of democrats can&#39;t do over anything. it is sickening to see rich people who haven&#39;t worked as hard as i work every day in their entire lives trying to take advantage of us, the lady gaga Biden ad did the same thing, it was offensive, and i&#39;m not offended by much, but the way she talked, and acted she was clearly appealing to rural voters and talking like we are stupid. i spend my day&#39;s fighting with animals, and making food for my family, we make most of our own food, but the way people disrespect the people putting food on their tables. i saw one quote that sums it up perfectly, i don&#39;t remember who said it but it was this, &quot;the farmer skips dinner so you don&#39;t have to.&quot; we work hard sunrise till sundown everyday to put food on the table of the ungrateful people who don&#39;t understand. i have been pulled over fences by goats, i have been knocked to the ground my goats and mini cows running into the back of my legs, i have been kicked, bitten, stepped on, bucked off, thrown to the ground, and so much more by 1,200 LBS animals, machines made of muscle and solid bone. i have fallen 6 ft traveling at 30 MPH, i wouldn&#39;t trade this life for anything, but people who know nothing about it don&#39;t get to talk down to me. people in the cities work hard yes, but i do physical labor all day everyday, i work outside in 10 degree temperatures to keep my animals safe and healthy, i brave the wind, rain, and much more weather issues to protect them, we go outside in the middle of the night, risking the threat of mountain lions, wolves, and coyotes to save a baby animal from the frigid temperatures. i know this as really long winded but i just needed to say something from the perspective of a farmer, we are underappreciated and that&#39;s fine, but don&#39;t disrespect us, we are tough as nails and will take you out. people rely on us, don&#39;t disrespect the people who create the food you need to live",Emalee Marrazzo,2021-02-10T06:30:53Z,0

"BEN:  1st, i grew up with WAYNE&#39;S WORLD, PARTY TIME, LOL They were Great back then, and still hold a Beat now!  Hilarious!  2nd, The Adoption Commercial was Phenomenal. My family started taking in 2-3 week&#39;s old Foster Children when I was just 9 year&#39;s old, and we All had to help feed them, clean them, clothe them, watch them, and it was some of the best experiences of my childhood, and young adult life. And because they weren&#39;t Aborted, and they were loved from day one, and adopted into loving home&#39;s, they were successes in life.  Mom and Dad ended up caring for 109 by the time they retired just a few year&#39;s ago.  ALL Life is precious, period.  <br />3rd, those were the ONLY one&#39;s that were Great, the other&#39;s flat out Stunk.  <br />And finally, does anyone else think, that just after one year of Covid-19, EVERY Celebrity (EXCEPT WAYNE &amp; GARTH &amp; Cardi B), LOL looks like they aged, 50 Year&#39;s.  LOL  Seriously, they all look Horrible.  LOL LOL What&#39;s up with that?!  <br />1st time watching them was tonight here; Worst Super Bowl Commercial&#39;s EVER!!

"I actually disagree about the Jeep commercial. I think the concept of &quot;coming closer to the middle&quot; is the most ACTUALLY progressive and sane thing I&#39;ve seen allowed on TV in a lonnnng time. I think a move away from extremism on each side is a good thing, no? In fact, that actually MAYBE could&#39;ve helped a lot of good-hearted but quiet liberals and conservatives speak out against things that are just plain evil. I happen to know a ton of pro-life liberals, for example. Are they currently brave enough to speak out about it? No. And I KNOW that even the wokest of the woke morons don&#39;t ACTUALLY believe that transwomen are women. So, seeing something like this, where the US flag and church are shown in a positive light on such a massive platform, could actually let people know that they&#39;re not alone. That no, you&#39;re not crazy, they are. It even talked about this Blue vs Red nonsense, which I think is great, because you should base your beliefs on good values, not on what your particular party says you should believe.",veggiesaremurder,2021-02-10T05:59:22Z,0

"Just a couple of things to say. First, I think the first ad was trolling sexism. It was meant to highlight it. Second, while I agree the Jeep ad was cringey, there&#39;s a couple of points that I disagree with Ben on. His comment on same-sex marriage and abortion seemed unnecessarily political. They issue I have with those comments is that he fails to mention that in those examples it&#39;s actually the conservative ideology that&#39;s trying to force its opinion on everyone. Nobody&#39;s forcing conservatives to have an abortion but conservatives are trying to take away a woman&#39;s right to abortion. no one is going to make a conservative participate in gay marriage, they certainly aren&#39;t going to force a church to officiate the ceremony, but the Republican party platform says that their goal is to take away that right from gay people. For the record, I watch Ben&#39;s videos often because I think it&#39;s important to see and understand everyone&#39;s perspective. I agree with him on Free speech though I don&#39;t agree with him on pretty much anything politically. Just my two cents.",Dan Verley,2021-02-10T05:31:24Z,0

It has nothing to do with BLM. The left that are controlling the media are using black people to damage American culture and thing is most black people would run a mile from such politics if they knew it existed. <br />Once the leftist media are finished and can get no more damage from black community they will move to hispanic Americans and try to sow seeds of discontent and then use a small number of vocal violent people to damage the culture again most hispanic people would run a mile from such politics. <br />If traditional Americans were clever they would be focusing on hispanic culture right now. Getting a cohort of Spanish speakers to focus on the different communities would be the key. The irony is that Trump did really well in Spanish areas of Texas.,bighand69,2021-02-10T09:40:23Z,1

But the men in my life explain WAYY TOO LITTLE.  My dad was a big talker, but outgoing &amp; a narciccist, NOT good AT ALL at teaching us stuff ( expected u to be born knowing it or have been paying closer attn. to things u had no idea u should be) or explaining things near enough, often enough. Then there&#39;s my husband who u have to drag pertinent details out of. It&#39;s exhausting and I&#39;d love me some man-splaining !! Not to make light of those who&#39;ve truly suffering by it, I do believe it&#39;s out there &amp; my Dad gave patriarchy a plenty bad name, but I&#39;m still not against it, it&#39;s for a reason &amp; any sinner will screw anything up, and any maturing Christian will make any good or Godly/Biblical thing, decent even in this fallen world, and it will be realized to be the blessing of God that it is. AKA don&#39;t throw out the baby with the bathwater, people. ) But again, I have been around a lot of men in my life, more than women ( farming ) and they don&#39;t really man-splain, that I&#39;ve seen.

@Joan Rhineer Imagine if republicans did something like that after Trump won and then bragged about it? I don&#39;t know if they were trying to get ahead of a story or just couldn&#39;t help themselves but we knew it already. We shouldn&#39;t even have a popular vote and the president should have very little power over domestic affairs. That&#39;s what&#39;s really divisive because one person cannot represent over 300 million people. But that&#39;s beside the point. I&#39;m a lot angrier with the media at this point. No one elected them to control how we&#39;re governed.

I didn&#39;t even realize it was Bruce Springstein or that he&#39;s a democrat so I kind of missed the political undertones because we were trying to figure out what they were even selling.
