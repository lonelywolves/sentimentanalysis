"This quiz is so biased in many regards as to how the question are written as you stated, it‚Äôs a leftists propaganda test!!! It‚Äôs nonsensical in the terminology of many of the questions and the fact that Hitler is considered a right authoritarian is completely and without question a ludicrous conclusion!!! To even have Hitler and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher listed even close is total bias and more leftists Marxists propaganda! Hitler should be over the line as left-authoritarian just above Putin, it‚Äôs total stupidity to think anyone actually feels the great Margaret Thatcher is anything like Hitler and who the hell answered for Hitler (a physic), it makes me just laugh üòÇ at how ridiculously unintelligent the left can be!!! This test and the author/authors of these questions are just more proof how nonsensical, unintelligent the left can be and all so how completely delusional these people are and they‚Äôre probably professors we‚Äôre paying to indoctrinate the young!!! <br /><br />P.S. Please forgive any grammatical errors because my MS is giving me many issues as they try to get my medication correct, like double vision! I also can‚Äôt find my reading/writing glasses üëì as usual which probably wouldn‚Äôt help much and I truly need a new prescription pair üëì or two üëìüëì, maybe I can wear one around my neck on a chain so I can find a pair üëì when needed!!!",Kelley Butler,2021-04-17T14:40:48Z,0

This quiz is terrible, it only talks about progressive staple talking points. I would slightly disagree with Hitlers placement, I would say he is more of a left winged moderate. Thatcher is more of a neoliberal/ left wing moderate as well. I side with has more questions and more matrixes to get a general overall view of mathematical political understanding.

Hitler took away the right to free speech and bare arms (just like democrats are doing today), They were intolerant and silenced differing opinions, and pushed their propaganda (just like democrats are doing today). Nazis wanted to put people that were different into concentration/reeducation camps (just like democrats want to do today). <br />Nazi Germany and Stalin&#39;s USSR are virtually identical, the only reason they hated each other is because of the leftist propaganda they were being fed.

"The political compass makes no sense.<br />There is no such thing as right wing authoritarians, nor are there leftist libertarians. <br /><br />How can a leftist who wants big government also want small, weak government?  If the government is weak, then people will not conform to socialist policies of theft.  The further left you go the higher the authoritarianism required to enforce it. There has never been an example in history otherwise and there can&#39;t be. <br /><br />And no right winger wants the large, powerful government required to enforce an ideology that supports individual freedom and small government.  For example, how is Margaret Thatcher so highly authoritarian in the example at the start of the video?  She was the elected PM of a mature liberal democracy who was subject to the stringent laws of that country, including the requirement to seek re-election on a regular basis.  And how is Hitler right of center? Can anyone name one right wing Nazi policy?  There sure are lots of left wing Nazi policies.<br /><br />The actual shape isn&#39;t a four quadrant square, it is a diagonal line that runs from the top left to the bottom right.",Jeff Tighe,2021-03-09T00:35:20Z,1

Every devolved country has a progressive tax system and the time with the highest level of economic prosperity was when the rich were taxed the highest and their wealth still grew.

"People talk about porn/prostitute legality without realizing the full scope of what it is, and why even some who consider themselves somewhat libertarian can agree that it ought to be illegal.<br />The largest and fastest growing criminal enterprise is human - specifically children - trafficking. This trafficking is mostly for that of sex work. Legalizing pornography and prostitution makes a pimp&#39;s job legitimate, at least on the surface level, so that they have reason to resist investigation. traffickers would love nothing more than to appear on the surface as legitimate, and shoot down serious inquiries.<br />The punishment is not often argued to be doled out to prostitutes or actors themselves, as they are typically the victims... even if they&#39;re not, it&#39;s a sad state of affairs and they bring punishment on themselves by participating willingly in the actions they choose.<br />Cracking down on pornography and prostitution is to aid the far too small groups of men and women making tremendous effort in the terribly dangerous and difficult job of catching scumbag traffickers.<br />PS traffickers obviously deserve the death penalty. don&#39;t dissolve the death penalty, make it very clear that some crimes are deserving of capital punishment. it is fact that this is a major crime deterrent on top of being just punishment for amoral actions that result in loss of life to innocent parties.",CAP_ROCKS_101,2021-02-17T01:31:28Z,0

"Ben, you make some good points, but you took a very judgmental stance on various questions. I&#39;ll start off at the most petty of points, abstract art does not mean a blank canvas. You used an extreme example to misleadingly portray abstract art as a whole. While many artworks can be seen as completely ridiculous or lazy, like shitting paint onto a canvas, or showing an empty space and calling it an emotion, it doesn&#39;t mean that abstract art is just people selling white squares.<br /><br />You rattle off answers without putting a check on your disposition. While it&#39;s interesting to see your memory, education and knowledge in play, prompt and detailed responses don&#39;t make you the highly moral person you seem to believe you are. You don&#39;t know everything, but you act like you do.<br /><br />You prefer punishment to rehabilitation for criminals, but imagine if you made a mistake or disagreed with social conventions then became a &quot;criminal&quot; for it. Then imagine you are ostracized without ever knowing any better. There is no enlightenment, only resentment. Shouldn&#39;t we punish and provide a clear lesson? Otherwise, what is the point? Just to make us feel vindicated? Punishment without rehabilitation only serves as emotionally fueled vengeance. It&#39;s better than no action at all, but you wouldn&#39;t tell off your children for doing wrong without teaching them right, would you? So why not the same treatment for criminals? There is an element of double standards within your point, because your children are more important to you than &quot;God&#39;s children&quot;. Basically, it seems like you are saying that we should treat people differently due to their age and level of neural plasticity? It&#39;s just a form of double standards.<br /><br />As for the death penalty discussion, that is too deep a rabbit hole to go down, but seeing that you agree with it displays quite a high level of immaturity.<br /><br />Your listening skills are awful, your emotional intelligence is fairly low and you have poor self-awareness. This is why I generally don&#39;t trust religious people, they need a book to teach them right from wrong, rather than to just &quot;know&quot;. To me, it&#39;s a display of a very one sided life experience when choosing religion for guidance. Wearing a skull cap does not indicate anything truly positive about a person, nor does wearing a cross or going to church. In fact, I&#39;ve noticed a trend with many religious people, they are often super naive and judgmental know-it-alls. Not all, but many. Or maybe that is just humanity general.<br /><br />Regardless, I think it&#39;s time to start listening more because you&#39;ve been lecturing for far too long.",Two Owl Candies,2021-02-15T16:15:12Z,0

It would be foolish to be proud of a country merely because you were born in it and nothing else, but this question is not saying &quot;it&#39;s foolish to be proud of a country because you were born in it&quot;.<br /><br />The reason why many people are proud of the country of their birth is because they have the most <i>first-hand experience</i> on that country, having lived there their entire lives. They can see first-hand what accomplishments that country has achieved, and if they can assess that the country has done good things for its people and for the betterment of humanity, there&#39;s nothing wrong in being proud of those achievements. Such a person is not proud of the country <i>because</i> he was born in it. He&#39;s proud of the country because he has seen what the country has done. It&#39;s perfectly possible to be proud of other countries as well, but it&#39;s harder to relate to them and make a more informed decision on that if one has never lived in those countries, if one doesn&#39;t have first-hand experience.<br /><br />If you are proud of a country, the most logical country is the one you live in, if you consider its achievements to be worthy of celebration. It&#39;s slightly less logical to be proud of a country you have never lived in. So no, it&#39;s not foolish to be proud of your own country. However, the question is phrased in a manner that leads one to instinctively answer that it is foolish.",WarpRulez,2021-02-04T11:44:59Z,0

However, it should be done at the local or state level. Federally funded but dispersed at the county level. And in the form of county clinics and then referral to county hospitals.

Homosexuality appears in over 1500 species aside from humans, so why shouldn&#39;t humans engage in homosexual acts? gender and sex, from a biological standpoint, are not the same thing. gender is a made up construct, and is treated more as a spectrum the further east you move.

"Why is &quot;government&quot; regulation needed to protect the environment? First, the premise that a corporation (whether 1 person or 10,000) is going to be irresponsible with the environment is ASININE!!! This is the problem with conservatives, they want the authoritarianism, just as much as leftist and progressives, its just a different kind. Remember any power you concede to the government they will one day use it against you. All the issues we are currently fighting, started maybe as far back as 100 years ago, many times by conservatives over reaching with regulations. The private sector already has a mechanism to deal with companies that cross these lines. Most businesses are part of a trade associations, why couldn&#39;t the association set standards and a company can take or leave them, but at the the risk of loosing business if someone doesn&#39;t agree with your position on why you&#39;re not following a &quot;standard&quot;. Look to the medical review boards and bar association for examples of how this could work (not that they are perfect). Government should NEVER have any say in how you do anything, until you personally have actually hurt someone, it&#39;s called &quot;due process&quot;.

Short-term Protectionism can allow fledgling industries to expand to a self-reliant level and can boost employment in the short-term. It becomes ineffective and often creates negative externalities when practiced for longer periods. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=4m28s"">4:28</a> - The goal of a corporation is not necessarily to provide a profit to its shareholders. That opens up the question of &quot;which year&#39;s profits?&quot; and paves the way for earnings management and short-termism. <br />The goal of the corporation is to maximize firm value for its shareholders. Firm value in this context is defined as the present value of all future expected profits. Whereas the notion of &quot;maximizing profits&quot; is only a current or selective element of Firm Value. <br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=5m47s"">5:47</a> - I agree that natural monopolies are mostly theoretical, but specific sectors have proven that we can get pretty close to natural monopolies. Alphabet Inc. has managed to position itself strongly in a variety of sector niches and is well-known for preemptive acquisitions of potential competitors, given that it has over 240 subsidiaries. A similar picture can be illustrated with Facebook. The vast number of contracts given to Google and Amazon by government agencies is also another area to look into.

So you think that you can be moral without being religious but it is immoral to have sex outside marriage?

"It is to him immoral because of his religious beliefs, and morality is very subjective on issues like that. And doing one wrong thing doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be a good person. Besides, people can still wait until marriage without being religious. An atheist doesn&#39;t have to live without morals that happen to come from religion.

"We need to be more aware of the damage that porn causes. the &quot;consenting&quot; adult women are almost always from a background of abuse. (So &quot;consent&quot; is conditioned.) The industry fuels sex trafficking and child abuse (it contributes to the world&#39;s MASSIVE sex trafficking problem). And it&#39;s HIGHLY addictive, meaning the &quot;consenting&quot; adults who use porn don&#39;t realise what they&#39;re consenting to because they end up needing worse and worse, more violent and weird stuff which ends up destroying families. It messes up the idea that teenagers have about what sex is and it fuels sexual selfishness in a couple. Porn is not a neutral thing, it&#39;s BAD NEWS all round.

"Now that I saw Mr Shapiro taking this test I think this is a place/commend section where I can share my opinion on this test. I have taken this test multiple times as well as the test by idr labs. And I clearly noticees one thing: This test contains more topics and sadly you can&#39;t be neutral on anything. The first time I have taken this test I already noticed how left based it was. Or should I rather say its Formulation is Left based so if you don&#39;t first think what the statement actually means than (at least from my experience) you tend to view everything just on the ethical/moral point of view. My first result was left liberal. After the second and third time of taking the test I ended up with liberalisms strongly in the middle with a little tendency to left. <br /><br />After the test by idr labs I got right liberalism. This result didn&#39;t chance after the second and third time, it was the opposite. After I learned some more things about economy and becoming more responsible for my self the results just went more to the right. The test by idr labs has fewer statements which focus on details but on the other hand is more balanced in term of the topics.<br /><br />I don&#39;t really know whether the political compass test is considered to be left based by you guys in the USA but I would recomment to also take the idr labs test. I mean I&#39;ve once watched a video by some other Youtuber (I don&#39;t know the name anymore) who said the test is known to maybe being left based. <br /><br />However I wanted to tell this for once at least. And Ben Shapiros commend section is definitely qualified for this commend.",Dark Fire,2020-12-15T22:41:21Z,1
@H.H Holmes I gst what you&#39;re saying. Well yes of course I know that the test needs some provocative statements. Shapiro has told in the video that like about half of the Statements( of course not totally the half) are written in that way. I don&#39;t know whether you ever have taken the test by idr labs but from my point of view that one is more neutral. And yes I think that some provocative statements in such a test are okay but not that much. So this is just my point of view. If you don&#39;t agree with me that&#39;s totally fine. <br />I think that such a test should be more neutral in the case of some who doesn&#39;t knows which side to vote for. As I already wrote my first result was left liberal. So in that case I could rather vote for democrats than republicans because of the test by political compass. But if I would have taken the idr labs test then I could vote for republicans. <br />Of course both test require at least some political knowledge which you are probably refering to indirectly. But as I already wrote. I think that such a test should be more neutral.<br /><br />I hope that you understand what I&#39;m trying to say. <br />It&#39;s good to have a conversation like this without any insults. That&#39;s really something constructive instead of saying that you would have the &#39;wrong opinion&#39;.,Dark Fire,2020-12-22T12:06:43Z,0

&quot;The death penalty should be an option for the most serious crimes&quot; What is a most serious crime and how can you be 100% sure someone has commited it? Some people are in jail for no reason and after some years it becomes clear that they didn&#39;t commit a crime and they can be free again.

"Left is Communism. Right is Capitalism. Germany was never Communistic, and (more or less) morally despised Communism (why they went to war with the Soviet Union).  Just because a government or leading party puts ‚ÄúSocialist‚Äù in their name does not make them socialist. Socialism is about freedom of the people and freedom of the market. Germany was Capitalistic. Not really Socialistic. They were extremely controlling and overruling + outlandishly racist, sexist, etc. Again, not socialistic. A good modern example of this is is the Democratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea (Northern Korea). Democratic? Well, being ruled by a single family (or other specific families) where only that family and those close to the said family are allowed to thrive off of the low-tier people, not being forced to served in the military is Democratic. Practically the same can be applied to Republic. And in what way do the People own North Korea? They don‚Äôt. Extremist parties will put friendly or positively associated titles, names, and groups into their own name to make those they rule over accept them as good. Hitler and extremely authoritarian and Capitalistic. The fact that you purely believe that Hitler, not Germany (during WWII) could be capitalistic is the pure identification of brainwashing of the extremely Staunch American Republicans. Not saying that Democrats are any better, but at east they try to buy into hiding themselves instead of just brainwashing. The fact that we only believe in two parties is the affect of brainwashing, itself. No other party can truly come in terms of hope in competing with the two corporate puppets. America‚Äôs politics are fundamentally flawed because a couple of white dudes sitting around a table wanting to increase their own net worth in the face of freedom decided on it. Electoral College? Gerrymandering? Not Republican, Democratic, etc. You declare that free health care, equality, rights, and everything else that Socialists in America want, but don‚Äôt look to as why they would fail, could fail, etc, but not do you care and go about spewing out false facts, narratives, and the like to fit your own agenda.Research, compare, contrast. Everyone has their freedom of right to speech, but speech of inaccurate sub-focal-s being shot out like propaganda because you can scare them into it isn‚Äôt right. This rant is all-over the place, but pease take these points to heart, mind, and body and understand that coming from one side or the other isn‚Äôt a technical way or aspect of identifying our flaws as a country and working together to elect those who will give actual change (for the better) to us, the people.

I don&#39;t think you could define the results from a million people online as the overall politican position of humanity itself. Firstly because there are only a billion people who use the internet compared to 7.8 billion people around the world. Also, the internet is mostly used by western and other first world developed countries. The 7.7 billion who don&#39;t use the internet are mostly going to be poor and older people around the world and you can be sure they will have different political ideas.

"@J Yes, but they are still human. I dont want to come across as someone who is against abortion because I believe that making it illegal will do more harm than good but i find it strange when people who are &quot;pro-life&quot; are also for capital punishment. If you believe that &quot;murder&quot; is wrong wouldnt you think that killing somebody for a crime is wrong too? <br /><br />As a human being I can understand the want for &quot;revenge&quot; on those who have hurt others. Most sane people probably wish they could take some form of revenge on like hitler but I try my best to empathize with litterally everyone and I can&#39;t see how you can advocate for something like the pro-life movement but believe that killing criminals is fine and dandy especially when a lot of those people are, imo, a product of their own circumstances and did not neccesarily have another choice or know better.<br /><br />So anyways the reason i said &quot;isnt all life equal&quot; is because many people who are against abortion like to argue that a fetus, who has barely formed limbs, has the same value as  a, hopefully, fully grown woman. So if thats the case why wouldnt criminals have the same value as well? Do men have the same value too? Why shouldnt that women get to decide what happens with her own body? Is a woman worth less than a fetus? Im just trying to understand ur side and i am thankful for this discussion.",Lea Cunningham,2020-11-13T03:39:33Z,0

"Ben isn&#39;t more libertarian because so many of his views prioritize humanity as a collective over individual freedom. Equality of opportunity and financial commutability for all are unimportant to him as long as there are a few with incredible means of driving innovation. Those born poor can be disadvantaged to the point where they have very little opportunity to improve their individual circumstances and that&#39;s fine to Ben as long as the rich make innovations that improve their lives a little. It doesn&#39;t matter if the poor remain poor as long as each generation of poor lives a little better than the last thanks to the innovations of the financially secure.<br /><br />What I don&#39;t understand is why a small amount of people born rich are better at innovating than a larger amount of people (who&#39;s poor background is negated by social institutions, allowing them to improve their earning potential) cooperating to create innovation.<br /><br />It&#39;s good that people are rewarded for contributing to society, but bad that some can be rich purely through birth, while some with the potential to contribute a lot to societal innovation are hampered by their poor birth. It&#39;s idealistic to want a true meritocracy with a totally level playing field for people at birth, but no one who works hard should be paid so little that they can only just afford to survive but not thrive.",Christopher Langan,2020-11-10T12:03:15Z,0

If the woman has to carry a child that she didn&#39;t want that sucks. And I understand that it is unfair to say that she must give birth to it, but in that case, I set priority on the unborns right to live.<br />And yeah, pro-lifers can get a little bit pushy with their beliefs, but that&#39;s also true for the pro-choice side.

If you sum up everything, I still think it causes more harm than good.  <br /><br />What is the most important is that the mother&#39;s right to decide what happens to her body (which is her life) outweighs the rights of an embryo that has yet to look like something even resembling a human being.<br /><br />And people, especially on the religious side I must add have no right to tell a mother what she can and can&#39;t do with her body.",Akryloth,2020-11-09T19:46:56Z,0

And if you disagree it&#39;s because  I don&#39;t think your a sentient human being. <br />I was almost mistaking Ben Shapiro for a racional person who tries to see the point of view of other people but then he says that anyone who disagrees with his highly subjective view isn&#39;t sentient. <br />I mean on what basis do you determine what level of openness about sex is appropriate or too far other than your personal experiences (or what you&#39;ve seen other people do or say)? <br /><br />Even if his basis is a religious one, per example perhaps in the book of his religion there is a message written stating clearly the line on openess about sex, how would he expect that every &quot;sentient human being&quot; to have read that testimony? <br /><br />To be clear I don&#39;t necessarily disagree with the idea that we should be less open about sex, but his wording reveals his closed minded nature that doesn&#39;t allow him to explore other view points making his opinions way less valuable/insightful.",Miguel Miranda,2020-11-03T17:40:32Z,14

"@Skull thunder <br />Actually, Christianity and Islam are very different. They view the relationship between God and man, and God and the universe very differently. <br /><br />The Christian view is that God created the universe and gave the universe its laws (the laws of nature). The universe normally functions in accordance with these laws. People can discover these laws and predict natural processes. From time to time (actually, very rarely), the laws of nature are suspended and a miracle happens. In other words, miracles are an exception, not the rule.<br /><br />The Islamic view is that all that happens is a DIRECT result of God‚Äôs will. In Islam, there‚Äôs no room for laws of nature. The idea of laws of nature is heretical because they would diminish God‚Äôs greatness.<br /><br />As far as the relationship between God and man is concerned, Christianity holds that man was created in God‚Äôs image. It means that every single person has inherent value, inherent dignity. According to Islam, people have no inherent dignity.<br /><br />These theological differences have serious societal consequences. <br />-----------------<br />A technical remark: You can‚Äôt say that &quot;if you think every muslim person is a terrorist you&#39;re probably racist&quot; because Islam is a religion, not a race.",traditionalist94,2021-02-21T00:44:08Z,0

"This so-called political compass thing is ridiculous. There is no such thing as right authoritarian. The right side of the spectrum assumes less governmental authority to start with. Libertarian ideology is unsustainable because it tries to marry liberal and conservative ideologies, and it also allows for subjective morality. Subjective morality invariably leads to authoritarianism because without established social rules for self restraint the people devolve into violence thus requiring heavy handed rule. The simple political spectrum is sufficient to describe all political ideologies. The compass idea is an effort to make Libertarianism fit despite its unnatural combination of competing political ideas. Since World War II the left has attempted to apply the NAZI label on conservatives to hide the fact that the Fascists used ideas from the American Democratic party. There is no such thing as Alt-Right. It has a name already. It is called the Democrat Party. White supremacists in the United States typically vote Democrat. The pre Civil War South was dominated by Democrats. The Democrats have fought against civil rights up until the early 1960s when they figured out they could use those laws and government handouts to farm votes. Conservatives never gave up on freedom and equality for all under the law.",Notofsoundmind,2020-10-09T22:53:54Z,0

"@tenebris sub terra I don&#39;t think you fully understand what the political spectrum represents. It simply represents government control. Leftward is more control, and rightward is less control.  Anarchy is a complete lack of any government at all, and this is well established political science. What is also fact is that the Nazis were socialists, and being that the Nazi regime had total control over the citizens of Germany I would argue that Nazism sits to the far left of the political spectrum. You should really study some basic political science. I don&#39;t have to assume or make up anything. I am giving you the facts as they were taught to me in school. As far as the words &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;moral&quot;, you have now established that you are a moral relativist. I feel sorry for you because you have nothing to base any morality on. You can&#39;t borrow from Judeo Christian beliefs if you were to be totally honest, and would have to accept a &quot;Might Makes Right&quot; philosophy, which means that anything is moral if I believe it to be so including committing some of the most heinous crimes. You can&#39;t even claim that rape is wrong based on anything more than your own personal belief. However, what if others believe differently than you. Without an objective moral code that comes from a higher authority than human kind, you can&#39;t expect anyone else, nor force them to, believe or act any which way you want them to. They have an equal right to believe and act as they see fit. Also, if you look at previous civilizations (e.g. Roman, Greek) you will see a correlation where the widespread acceptance of homosexuality and moral relativism contributed greatly to their downfall. No civilization has survived under those circumstances. One other thing is that I will acknowledge that the left has traditionally used anarchists to achieve their political goals. Liberal political groups such as the Jacobins, Bolsheviks, Nazis, and various others have used violent anarchists for political gain.",Notofsoundmind,2020-10-13T14:09:09Z,0

"@tenebris sub terra White supremacists typically vote democrat. Fascism is a form of socialism, which by the way is extreme left wing (Look it up, and not on Wikipedia). Far right is just anarchy (no government at all), and the &quot;Alt-Right&quot; label is a dodge. Since the end of World War II, Democrats have been trying to coverup their connection with European socialists. The NAZI party took a lot of ideas from the Democrat party (public knowledge BTW), and since then the Democrats have been claiming that Nazism is a far right extremist political system.  The NAZI party was officially known as &quot;National Socialist German Workers&#39; Party&quot;.  Socialism is and has always been accepted as a form of government that exerts a great deal of control over the citizenry. It, in effect, takes the &quot;seat of power&quot; away from the citizens.  For all the so-called &quot;alt-right&quot; white supremacists out there, why is all the antisemitism coming from the left. Many conservatives, who are typically Protestant Christian, are very pro-Israel. Yes, conservatives believe in freedom, as in Constitutional freedom. We believe in freedom from excessive government control. However, we believe that in order to achieve that level of freedom the citizenry must exhibit a lot of self control based on an absolute objective moral code. It has been my observation that the left believes in a lot of government control, but wants freedom from any objective morality, which is basically &quot;might makes right&#39;, even though none of you want to admit that fact. I do understand that there will be gays, no doubt, and I would prefer that the government stay out of the marriage business completely. However, I would prefer that everyone (heterosexuals too) keep their sex business to themselves, and out of public view. I would prefer that gays stop trying to push their perversions onto children. I also want society in general to acknowledge that homosexuality is in fact a mental disorder similar to that of body dysmorphic disorder. This does not mean &quot;hate&quot; gays. I also don&#39;t want them to be forced to do anything they don&#39;t want to do, but they have a problem that needs to be addressed as a public health issue. There is nothing natural or healthy about homosexuality. I have known and worked with gays and lesbians, and they weren&#39;t as happy as they want the world to believe. I could see that they were hurting inside. The left as been publicly and openly attacking all objective morality and the institution of the family as traditionally accepted for thousands of years. This has the potential of destablizing and weakening the country as recently evidenced with the behavior of Antifa and BLM (who are both Marxists by the way, and they don&#39;t give a crap about blacks). Widespread acceptance of homosexuality has been at the forefront of this effort. Homosexuality is objectively morally wrong, and overall is destructive to this country. I argue this point not as your political adversary, but as someone who has studied history. I know that if the left get their way, you, along with so many others will be lamenting and waxing nostalgic about the good ol&#39; days when you could actually speak your mind, live freely, buy food whenever you wanted, and not fear that your door will be kicked in at 2 am to just disappear. The day will come when no one will actually have pets because they will all be killed for food. In that day you will find yourself desperately poor while your liberal politicians live in fancy houses behind guarded walls away from us troglodytes. To be clear, I&#39;m not saying all Republican politicians are good. Many of them are what we call RINO&#39;s, or &quot;Republican In Name Only&quot;. They are leftist infiltrators because they couldn&#39;t otherwise get elected in their respective states. My whole political belief system is based on core conservative beliefs and the beliefs of the founding fathers of the United States. If you prefer the extreme left wing Marxists politics being promoted now, then move to China where you can have all the oppression you could ever dream of. Do yourself a favor and do more research beyond what the mainstream media is putting out.

This is why a mall, or a college built in a low cost area drastically improve the area around it after even a few years after construction. <br />Not to mention, your concept of capitalism is misguided and wrong, as it actually revolves around supplying people&#39;s needs, that is the method a capitalist gets rich in the first place.

"@Johannes Vogt sure, there is plenty of writing on this topic, but here are just some key points:<br /><br />What&#39;s evil about pornography?<br /><br />1. It undermines societal values and standards.  Before, sex was reserved for committed relationships for the purpose of having children.  Beyond having children it was incentive for men to be good.  Before men &quot;got some&quot; they had to show the woman they are committed, successful, responsible and so on.  This made for better men.  Better men results in a stable society where men are men, and not adult toddlers.  I believe women help men grow up.  Pornography cheapens sex where these preconditions is no longer necessary.  Anyone can get their &quot;fix&quot;.  So why would men seek to better themselves and strive for higher standards if they can get their fix via pornography and other less reputable means?<br /><br />2. It undermines relationships.  Sex in relationships is meant to be exciting so as to strengthen the bond between the two people.  Pornography sets unrealistic expectations and raises the bar so high that when reality hits, it is disappointing.  This undermines the physical aspect of the relationship and weakens it.  When relationships weaken partners seek out other avenues to compensate for what they find lacking.<br /><br />3. It is unfair to the woman.  When a man cheats on a woman, at least the woman has recourse. She knows who the man cheated on her with.  Pornography takes that away.<br /><br />In short it undermines societal standards and relationships.¬†<br /><br />Now add to that post-modernist culture messaging: career over kids, women need men like a fish needs a bicycle, toxic masculinity and so on.  Is it any wonder we see increased divorce rates, declining birth rates, and people who prefer to be single or give up on relationships altogether?",mzbarsk,2021-04-17T20:08:27Z,0

If that applies to you then your moral system is assbackwards. Abortion should be considered an emergency procedure, not some casual BS that you can pay 200 dollars to get done at a shop somewhere. Abortion is a disgrace and morally wrong but sometimes it should be done. The main problem I have is the fact that people use it as some form of birth control. Birth control should be something you can receive for free if you want to. Some colleges even already give out free condoms.  Abortion should be such a last ditch procedure that it barely is used, yet its used in 1/5 of all pregnancies in america, which is disgraceful because the cause of these abortions is because of recklessness",mastertrey,2021-01-03T23:05:07Z,0

"Hi Ben,  I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on the following...<br />Everybody knows that in order to be able to drive a car one must first learn the road rules, learn to operate the vehicle, and pass a test that proves you have the capacity to drive before being issued with a drivers license.  Some people simply don&#39;t have that capacity.. so we don&#39;t let them drive because that would be dangerous for everybody.<br />... And yet a teenager without a clue, and plenty in their twenties too, can bring another life into this world . . . <br /><br />Hypothetically speaking, if you were tasked with setting out the criteria for a &#39;Certificate of capacity to bear children&#39; , how would that read?<br /><br />Incompetent parents are highly likely to have children that will grow to be the same.<br /><br />Competent educated parents are highly likely to have children that will grow to be the same.<br /><br />In the case of &#39;accidental&#39; pregnancies in whatever form where both parents are not yet certified, both must gain certification before due date to avoid constant supervision until certification is achieved. If they prove to be incompetent, adoption by competent parents would offer the best future for the child.<br />I am not advocating for abortion in any way.<br />I am speaking for education. <br />All the nitty-gritty details of being a parent, the time the costs the responsibilities. If all of this were taught in schools so that teenagers and young adults truly understood what they were taking on by having a child .. well my hope is that in the future it will be common for people to properly prepare themselves first.",bob the builder,2020-09-30T07:55:53Z,0

"There is truth to what Ben said about multinational corporations, but the truth is that many of these multinational corporations are not truly capitalist; they just pretend to be capitalist. They are in fact monopolistic rather than capitalistic and they despise and crush competition. True capitalism depends fundamentally on competition. This also explains why big multinationals love an institution like the European Union, because the EU&#39;s economic system of the single market and &quot;level playing field&quot; are fundamentally anti-competitive and anti-capitalist. EU nations cannot make any of their own trade deals or set any of their own business or financial rules or regulations. It must all be done at the EU level. The EU allows multinationals in many ways to write their own rules and regulate their own businesses, so it&#39;s great for them. However, the EU sucks if you are a small or medium size business or an entrepreneur.

"I read through the comments and saw that some people are insisting that Ben Shapiro is a total Authoritarian. I do not agree. First I must say that we all have different belief systems and do not all believe in the same thing. We need to understand that personal morals and beliefs are different from politics (or at least should be). As an individual, I have a right as to how I want to live my life, and these beliefs will greatly affect my political views. However I must be careful to remember that other members of society also have a right to live their lives by their own self declared beliefs. If society runs simply on individual beliefs, this will lead to anarchy and the eventual breakdown of such a society. Thus there is the need to draw  lines of morality so that law and order can be established such that each individual in the society can thrive. This means that both sides of the ideology divide (left and right) will need to compromise to allow for an agreeable society without infringing on the individual right to speech, opinion and belief. This is why we need true free speech and open debate. P.s I&#39;m saying this as a conservative Christian, pro life, who really wants everyone to be born again and choose Jesus but I know that even God does not infringe on man&#39;s right to choose irrespective of the consequences and neither will I.",Ozioma Onogu,2020-09-26T22:12:29Z,0

However on social commentary I‚Äôd always prefer to listen to the right, points are clearly marked out, disagreements can be had, views can be changed or updated.

Socialism certainly can&#39;t fix the environment either. Has any socialist state ever cared about the environment? No, none of them have. If we actually look at some current real world examples, the only ones who care about it are western countries. Which as you know are all sustained by a capitalist economy. Even the Scandinavian nations which so many leftists like to point out as examples, are all driven by a capitalist foundation. Like Norway for example, being one of the worlds largest exporters of oil. Which gives them the money to invest in research and development of greener sustainable alternatives for the future.",Kristoffer,2020-10-08T07:03:19Z,0
"@Kristoffer Yes. That is true under almost any system that doesn‚Äôt represent the people. Where the government can forcefully send you off to a work camp while you barely make the bare minimum to survive. This is true of the Soviets/Chinese and of Western European colonial Empires. Oppression exists on both sides of the spectrum, and I understand that the ideal society more than likely doesn‚Äôt exist on the far extreme end of leftist economics. The point I‚Äôm trying to make is that unregulated capitalism is almost to just as responsible for the suffering in the world as Communist dictatorships. And with regards to climate change, capitalism does not care about fixing the planet. It‚Äôs main focus is how much profit can be made rather than how sustainable the methods are.

"@Kristoffer (what country do you live in?) Most of what I learned about socialism came after I graduated high school, and very little from my studies in college.

So what you&#39;re trying to say is that when poverty happens under a socialist system it&#39;s evil but under a capitalist system that&#39;s just the free market?

It&#39;s easy to tell you have no real life experience with any of these types of government. Capitalist democracy is the gold standard that every society should strive for. It&#39;s the best, most free and fair type of governance available. If you actually experienced socialism for real, you would be on your knees begging for a return to capitalism.

"He repeatedly says &quot;these questions are totally ass-backwards and obviously written by people on the political Left&quot;. But what&#39;s funny is that he only says this selectively, based on certain wordings. Apparently he doesn&#39;t understand how the test works. The questions are ALL opinionated. That&#39;s the point. Each question is simply a prompt for the user to see whether they agree with it or not. There are prompts that present a conservative point of view, and there are prompts that present a liberal point of view. His job as the test-taker is to respond with what he thinks is true.<br /><br />You&#39;ll notice that he made no mention of bias when he answered questions like &quot;The freer the markets, the freer the people&quot; or &quot;All abortions should illegal&quot;. He happily put his answers down and never brought up the fact that these prompts are obviously sympathetic to a conservative/moralistic background. So he goes on saying (literally dozens of times) how the whole test is rigged and that it&#39;s biased and blah blah blah.<br /><br />Then, hilariously, his final result comes in... And it&#39;s a more or less accurate reflection of his political stance. So this whole test is rigged and unfairly designed, but then it just so happens to yield a correct result?!!? And even though he admits that it came out mostly correct, he never revises his slander about the test itself. He continues to tell all of his shallow followers that the whole thing is flawed and liberally-biased.<br /><br />This is why BS is dishonest, and should not be trusted. He manipulates you into thinking he&#39;s being totally objective but in reality he&#39;s just on a crusade to create divisions and make his &#39;enemies&#39; look bad.

"Ben of course you didn&#39;t end up where you thought you would, because you read the question then twisted the question to make it something that it wasn&#39;t asking. I&#39;m going to use the question about Mothers being homemakers. you argued that they want to label you a sexist if you agree. This is wrong, that question is looking for your view on traditionalist values vs progressive values. In the 1940s America it was normal to imply that a woman&#39;s place was in the home taking care of the family. It has never been a &quot;norm&quot; to say that about men so asking that question is irrelevant.",Jacob Sanborn,2020-09-01T17:00:58Z,5

"There are many people in these comments saying being anti-abortion would be the libertarian stance, and I staunchly disagree. (WARNING: I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t be a libertarian, and be anti-abortion, I am saying that there is a really strong libertarian argument for being pro-choice)<br /><br />Let&#39;s assume for a moment, that both the mother, and the unborn fetus are of the same moral worth. (A lot of people would argue that proposition already, but it is actually not important for my argument) Can we force a person to give up their bodily autonomy to keep someone else alive? I mean, from a libertarian perspective, you can&#39;t force people to donate organs, or blood, even to save someone&#39;s life, even if the potential lasting damage is smaller, as it certainly is with donating blood. Why should a mother then be forced to give up her bodily autonomy to keep a child alive?<br /><br />And before you say it, no, I&#39;m not saying you should allow abortions up to the 9 month mark. After a certain point, if a woman chooses not to be pregnant anymore, you can just medically induce birth. Already like 20% of births are induced in the UK for example, so it is not such a radical idea, and is not of significant risk to the child.<br /><br />You can say, that bodily autonomy can never supersede the right to life of another person, but then you&#39;d have to advocate compulsory non-vital organ donation, and compulsory blood donation, too, if you want to be consistent, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the libertarian perspective, which is what we were arguing about.<br /><br />And I&#39;m saying this as someone who&#39;d never want to abort a child, should I get my girlfriend pregnant by accident.",Botond Hetyey,2020-09-01T15:17:47Z,1

William Briggs has a short essay comparing Nolan&#39;s and Pournelle&#39;s Axes. Pournelle uses one axis to represent attitude to the state- one end of the line is the State as ultimate evil and the other is State worship or idolatry. The other axis is the individual&#39;s view of human reason as a solution to all social ills.

"As a career Artist, I‚Äôm consistently amazed how much folks on both the left and the right get art wrong. Abstract art arose because Artists refused to be propaganda machines for both the left or the right. Beauty is inherent in  the abstracted elements of art; tone, color, texture, space, sound, context, process, etc. These elements, in and of themselves, can be pure poetry. They can reveal the basic universality of the basic building blocks of visual experience. They can also foster prayer and contemplation of the glory of being. Conceptual art is a different, more complex  issue altogether. Music, by the way is an example of an almost purely abstract art...Mr. Violin!! <br /><br />Folks on the Left believe art should only be propaganda in order to be relevant.

The test is absolute garbage.<br /><br />I have a feeling the quiz put me center because none of the questions were really evocative of a political preference. They were predominantly philosophical questions that are irrelevant. For example &quot;From each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot; IS a fundamentally good idea. I almost universally disagree with socialism and communism. I believe that people should be ideally working where they are best suited and that those who have needs should have their needs met. But the driving force for this should predominantly be the free market in almost all scenarios, and government only has an excuse to intervene in rare circumstances. Two key examples would be military protection and enforcement of anti-fraud/theft. I have a feeling Ben would agree with me here, but for some reason he seems to forget that fraud prevention is a socialist governmental function. Without good government, you can not prohibit fraud effectively.<br /><br />One of the means of production is the justice system. If government didn&#39;t exist, it&#39;d consist of private militaries you sent to punish people you didn&#39;t like. That would be your only recourse for fraud/theft/etc. I believe that the means of producing justice should be monopolized and socialized in the form of the government.

If we have the capability not to kill them I‚Äôd rather a serial killer survive than an innocent person be executed. Besides it makes criminals more desperate to evade capture which leads to more deaths - e.g. when death penalty was implemented for rape, the only result was that more rape victims were murdered to cover up the crimes. Criminals are more likely to surrender to the police if they aren‚Äôt worried about the death penalty which means less innocents die from collateral.",Irrelevant12 ???,2020-10-28T10:13:39Z,0

For example, on the mother question I agree with the statement from Ben&#39;s perspective that all parents should place kids first. However since the same question wasn&#39;t asked about fathers it&#39;s obvious the question was meant to determine whether someone thought it was more wrong for mothers to work outside the home something which I strongly disagree with. Another example would be the defying international law question.

I could&#39;ve used amazon, or fedex, health care, or just about anything else as an example as to why free markets, in their current state, are better than any government involvement with the market. I see the problem, you see one clip of Ben talking about capitalism and think that&#39;s all there is to it. He understands and talks about, quite frequently when this issue comes up, about externalities and I believe the examples he usually uses are like public roads, police, etc.",John Johnson,2020-10-06T18:23:48Z,0

"@jtnachos16<br />&quot;Very clearly, this discussion is done. You&#39;ve gotten to the point of constant &#39;no u&#39; arguments and ignoring where I directly point out issues in your logic and your fallacious arguments. You&#39;ve gotten to the point where you are just strawmanning all over the fucking place. Not ONCE in this post I&#39;m responding to, have you actually been able to defeat my logic. You&#39;ve just spouted off your personal views as if they are factual, and ranted about &#39;core libertarian principles&#39;, while demonstrating you don&#39;t understand them. &#39;Core libertarian principles&#39; are individual liberty, minimal unnecessary government influence, voluntary association, freedom of thought, and the concept of personal responsibility to use your freedoms wisely.&quot;<br />Again, vague accusation with no concrete instances of where I do this. You should also note that pointed &#39;no u&#39; arguments where you criticize someone for accusing you of something they do themselves can be valid, you seem to imply that every possible instance of this type of argument can be just brushed off as wrong (because that&#39;s exactly what you are doing here). You accuse me of constantly displaying broken logic, using fallacies to strengthen my argument and strawmanning your argument but you don&#39;t have the courtesy of telling where this happens? That makes you look very bad, you know.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m not going to respond to individual statements when you can&#39;t do the common fucking courtesy of responding to the arguments presented in a logical manner. I&#39;m not going to respond to individual statements, when you&#39;ve shown continual bad faith by cherry-picking statements you can pull out of context to try to &#39;defeat&#39;. There is no point in responding to individual statements when 90% of what you say consists of repeating yourself, flinging accusations, inserting words into my mouth, and fighting arguments I didn&#39;t make.&quot;<br />Here you do the same thing again. You make broad unsubstatiated accusations and brush my entire response aside, I know it&#39;s very convenient for you to do but I&#39;m trying my best here to respond to EVERYTHING you say. You may not like it, but I am going to keep doing it, because as soon as I stop you&#39;ll say I&#39;m misrepresenting what you said. You say there is no point in responding to individual statements, 90% of which are fallacious. The constructive thing to do is to respond accordingly to the (apparently) 10% good arguments AND to point out about the other 90% WHY you think I&#39;m being fallacious.<br /><br />&quot;You&#39;ve done nothing, on the original topic of &#39;was Ben&#39;s statement on porn anti-libertarian&#39; other than repeatedly argue by assertion while the other party explained pretty clearly the problems with your logic, which you either utterly ignored, or countered with more argument by assertion. Instead you&#39;ve decided that I was &#39;attacking libertarian principles and ideology&#39; when I&#39;ve done no such thing. I&#39;ve been attacking YOUR rigid, dogmatic version of the ideology and interpretation of libertarian principles, not the ideology itself.&quot;<br />Again, you cast all of my arguments on the discussion topic aside here on the claim that they are all just assertions. So funny that you call yourself the &#39;other party&#39; who &#39;explained pretty clearly the problems with your logic&#39;. Not only have you conveniently ignored many of my arguments, but you constantly refused to address them. You accuse me of &#39;utterly ignoring&#39; arguments, but I&#39;m fairly confident I have done no such thing. Maybe next time you accuse someone tell them exactly what they have done so they can properly defend themselves against your accusation.<br /><br />&quot;Since you keep arguing about &#39;derailments&#39; when you are the one derailing shit constantly by taking illustrative examples of the flaws in your logic, and then turning them into utter tangents, spouting off about the individual example, rather than keeping your response in context to the core issue&quot;<br />I am not arguing about derailments, I am pointing out that YOU complained about derailments while YOU were derailing in very concrete instances. I keep directly addressing verbatim quotes of your replies, so I don&#39;t have much leeway to drift off topic as you do.<br /><br />&quot;This is the source of our argument. You have insisted, the entire conversation, that your hardline, extremely arbitrary stance on what the core principles have to be interpreted as to qualify as libertarian, is correct, with no logic to back it up, aside from taking things overly literal, and declaring that any position that deviates from yours is not libertarian.&quot;<br />The only thing YOU have been doing (and are doing again in this argument) is saying I&#39;m being arbitrary and saying I&#39;m wrong in asserting everything, without substantiating. You were correct earlier, there is not much room for discussion if only one side is being very specific in their language and the other side is casting very wide nets over it and whooshing it away.<br /><br />&quot;You&#39;ve been arguing that to be a political identity, you have to follow the herd on it&#39;s core principles, in a rigid, non-deviating &#39;letter of the law&#39; manner. That&#39;s not how political identities work. They are more akin to &#39;spirit of the law&#39;.&quot;<br />Yes, all members of a political philosophy ahere to its core principles. When people who ascribe to that philosophy directly contradict one of these core principles they are inconsistent or even hypocritical (if they are aware they&#39;re doing it). These principles have a meaning, they are not just whatever you want to make them. That is the strength of philosophy, it groups prescriptive worldviews in a limited, grounded set of defined axiomatic principles.<br /><br />&quot;You&#39;ve contradicted yourself on the principles numerous times by making the argument that it is okay to arrest on &#39;could cause harm&#39; for some things, while it&#39;s unacceptable on others, and that taking the position, using the same logic for both, that the one you view as unacceptable is acceptable, isn&#39;t libertarian, despite the EXACT SAME REASONING BEING USED FOR BOTH.&quot;<br />No. I presume you&#39;re talking about the DUI example. I have pointed out multiple times that you&#39;re using a false equivalence. By driving under influence you always directly endanger the others on or aside the road, you infringe on their individual liberty. It&#39;s when you are infringing on others individual liberty that your individual liberty ends, as per the principle of individual liberty. However if you&#39;re watching consensual pornography, you are NOT infringing on anyone elses individual liberty, so making that illegal is massive authoritarian government overreach from the libertarian viewpoint. It&#39;s not difficult, friend, you just don&#39;t want to listen. YOU EVEN AGREED THAT ONLY HARDLINE AUTHORITARIANS WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE QUESTION!<br /><br />&quot;What is important for determining political identity, is not the conclusion you reached, it&#39;s the logic and beliefs that lead you there. Hence why I pointed out the far-left vs far-right mirror issue.&quot;<br />Your conclusion IS important if it clashes with a premise you claim to hold, but it isn&#39;t even his final answer that made me criticize him, it&#39;s his reasoning that came with it. So I&#39;m exactly doing what you are saying here.<br /><br />&quot;Ben Shapiro&#39;s comments in response to the pornography question fit squarely in libertarian ideology. Even his eventual conclusion fits squarely in libertarian ideology. He initially disagreed, thought the question through, and engaged his brain rather than going with the knee-jerk response, and worked through his logic behind his decision on the matter. Their are no real conflicts in his reasoning on the matter, with the stated libertarian principles. What there are conflicts with, are your personal beliefs about what qualifies as libertarian or doesn&#39;t. Personal beliefs you have been utterly unable to provide any logical backing for why they are correct.&quot;<br />Except he never made the decision. He clicked agree in order to move on, yes, but he says himself that he is still wavering between agree and disagree, even after &#39;engaging with his brain&#39; and recognizing that agreeing is in line with libertarian ideology (a statement with which you agree here in your argument). So now you&#39;re almost there. You have recognized that disagreeing is obviously authoritarian and agreeing fits squarely in libertarian ideology. Now you merely have to think about it: &quot;Wait a minute! If he&#39;s a libertarian then why is he still not sure whether to agree or disagree? Why is he doubting between an authoritarian and a libertarian position?&quot;. And then, hopefully, you&#39;ll finally come to the conclusion that he isn&#39;t consistent and maybe even hypocritical.",Tronald Dump,2020-08-06T15:45:06Z,1

"@jtnachos16 PART 3<br />&quot;The real problem is, you don&#39;t like/agree with Shapiro, so you set unreasonable expectations so that you can &#39;call him out&#39; when he fails to meet them. Nothing he said during this video was evidence of lacking intelligence. You&#39;ve just set an arbitrary definition of what qualifies someone as libertarian, and then tried for argument by assertion endlessly in the face of confrontation, using no logical arguments to back your position, with what attempts you have made to counter logical arguments merely demonstrating either massive holes in your logic and understanding capability, or that you have no desire to argue in good faith. Doesn&#39;t really matter which at the end of the day.&quot;<br />Okay, nice assessment of your feelings about the discussion. I am doing exactly what I was talking about, I criticize Ben if I think he is inconsistent. I hold him to a high standard because of his influence and public position. I have NOT said that Ben was unintelligent, I have said that his position is hypocritical.<br /><br />&quot;We&#39;ve definitely reached that point where there is no way for this to be constructive anymore. Your &#39;responses&#39; consist of responding to cherry-picked statements you removed from their context so you could misrepresent them, strawmen you have fabricated, general misrepresentation of my arguments, mindless accusations (attacking libertarian ideology, really? Come on now, I think Libertarian ideology is one of the more sane political ideologies at the moment, the problem is that what you espouse to be the restrictions on who isn&#39;t and isn&#39;t libertarian are super rigid and quite inaccurate, with you fundamentally misunderstanding what a political identity consists of), and a massive amount of evidence of bad faith argumentation rather than an actual attempt to learn and understand.&quot;<br />Again, people making vague accusations instead of corroborating them are either malicious or stupid. You have yet to point out a SINGLE instance in which I ripped a part of your argument from its context in a manner where it changes what you were saying. It seems like you just don&#39;t like that I tear down your arguments piece by piece, so you complain about generally taking things out of context. What is it that you want me to do? Not respond to your quoted arguments directly and instead just dismissing entire chunks of your reply as being wrong? I am trying to be constructive here, you are refusing to do the same.",Tronald Dump,2020-08-06T09:56:16Z,2
"@jtnachos16 PART 1<br />&quot;So you completely and utterly fail to see the points being made, and are back to breaking up connected statements to address them individually so that you can &#39;defeat&#39; them, when trying to attack them when connected fails? <br />Yet you keep accusing me of various fallacies while using incredibly fallacious ones yourself.  We&#39;ll get to at least one of those later.&quot;<br />I asked you enough now, stop making general accusations without referencing the concrete places where I do this. It&#39;s impossible to defend myself from this. My accusations of your fallacious arguments are very pointed and you know exactly what I am referencing.<br /><br />&quot;Yes, separation and weaning work. So why doesn&#39;t jail? It does the exact same thing as rehab, in separating the person from the addictive substance. Thing is, rehab only works if the person is willing to change. Just like jail. There is no difference between compulsory rehab and sending someone off to jail. They both consist of involuntary incarceration and restrict those vaunted ideals of &#39;personal liberty&#39; that you There is no way for the government to &#39;treat it as a medical issue&#39; without effectively forcing people to seek treatment by way of incarceration.&quot;<br />With drugs decriminalization you drastically reduce the number of people incarcerated and every bad consequence in their future that comes with that, free up law enforcement resources for more appropriate matters, prioritize health and safety over punishment for users, can institute a safer environment for drug use instead of pushing it underground, lower drug overdose fatalities. I&#39;m serious dude, there&#39;s a fucking MASSIVE list of positive consequences. You&#39;re brushing it away as if the current system and the solution I support are exactly the same, but they have massively different outcomes and one of them is obviously better. And the whole &#39;there is no difference between compulsory rehab and sending someone off to jail&#39; is fucking insane. Sending people to rehab is only done if they&#39;re addicted, sending people to jail happens AS SOON AS THEY GET CAUGHT POSSESSING an illegal substance. Don&#39;t you see the difference between solving the bad cases and punishing everyone? Just imagine being sent to jail for drinking alcohol, do you think that&#39;s good?<br /><br />&quot;&#39;you are attacking libertarianism and my own position on drugs, rather than the argument at hand&#39;? I&#39;m doing neither. I&quot;M POINTING OUT CLEAR PROBLEMS IN YOUR LOGIC, via logical comparison statements, something that is very useful for illustrating the holes and contradictions in your logic. Contradictions you are making CONSTANTLY at this point, in your attempt to argue by assertion/handwave rather than actually dispute my logic directly.&quot;<br />YOU are the one who brought arguments against libertarianism into the discussion. I have only argued for why Ben&#39;s statement is anti-libertarian until YOU started to attack libertariansim itself. As I&#39;ve pointed out, it seems like you&#39;re trying to shift the conversation here. You complained about the conversation deviating off topic? How about you stop making anti-libertarianism arguments and talk about the actual topic? Ah, wait, you already agreed that disagreeing with the question is hardline authoritarian so there&#39;s really not much left to defend here.<br /><br />&quot;By your own statement, it&#39;s libertarian to infringe someone&#39;s liberty by compelling them to rehab, but it&#39;s somehow anti-libertarian to try to restrict access to the thing that causes restriction of liberty via making it contraband? How do you not see the problem here? Both infringe on your interpretation of what qualifies as &#39;personal liberty&#39;. You literally declared addiction as infringing on their ability to practice/enjoy personal liberty and then turned around and advocated compulsory rehab, while decrying incarceration, which functions identically when it comes to violations of personal liberty under the stances you have shown throughout our communication here.&quot;<br />1. I have yet to argue for COMPULSORY rehab,  YOU brought that into the discussion to compare it to prison<br />2. I have already explained the difference between jailing people for possession and treating people for addiction<br />3. I have already pointed out that mass incarceration for drug possession doesn&#39;t solve the problem and medically treating addiction does<br /><br />&quot;Also, &#39;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&#39;. Somehow it&#39;s better to try to fix the problem after it&#39;s caused damage, than trying to prevent the damage from occuring in the first place, by your logic?&quot;<br />In my logic, it&#39;s better to solve the problematic cases instead of making all cases (including the non-problematic ones) illegal. This is backed up by data and real-world examples.<br /><br />&quot;The whole &#39;motte and bailey&#39; bullshit:<br />LEARN WHAT TERMS MEAN BEFORE YOU USE THEM. For the love of god man. For it to be a &#39;motte and bailey&#39; I have to be a proponent of both options mentioned.&quot;<br />Yes. What&#39;s the issue? You&#39;re defending the bailey (the criminalization of all addictive substances) by defending the motte (the criminalization of harmful situations). I don&#39;t see the issue here. Can you list the concrete instances of where I&#39;m wrong and tell me how it&#39;s wrong?<br /><br />&quot;I also have to be backing down on statements to retreat to an earlier position, then claiming victory because you couldn&#39;t assail the original position. I am not doing that in the slightest.&quot;<br />Yes, you do have to back down. You can&#39;t simultaneously complain about the deviation off the topic of discussion and also deviate off topic. I directly quote your arguments and respond to them, YOU are the one who is shifting the discussion.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m using logical comparisons between similar concepts that function in the same role by your stated logic, where you refuse to acknowledge that you supporting one position as not being a violation of &#39;libertarian&#39; ideals, while the other position, one that uses the same logic to be reached, is somehow &#39;anti-libertarian&#39;, to point out the flaws in your logic and blatant hypocrisy in calling Ben not Libertarian for following your standards, of rigid adherence to a particular interpretation of a concept. While you yourself demonstrate you don&#39;t follow those standards.&quot;<br />Exactly, you try to attack ME for not being libertarian (with which I disagree) instead of defending BEN against my assertion that his statement is anti-libertarian. That is exactly what I mean by you shifting the topic of discussion.<br /><br />&quot;You are again defining the libertarian political identity as rigid adherence to specific political positions. That&#39;s not what a political identity is. A political identity, is a series of concepts and ideals that one works to uphold. What is important here, is the reasoning and logic behind the conclusion, not the conclusion itself (hence why you can find far-left ideologies advocating for things that are traditionally far right positions, like as was demonstrated with the woke crowd saying silly things like &#39;black people should be policed by black people&#39; or &#39;black characters in animation should only be played by black voice actors&#39;, effectively advocating for segregation being re-integrated into the country. Or trying to remove racial discrimination protections so they can re-implement affirmative action, as they did in california, last I checked. Here&#39;s a link on that one, actually, I just nailed the first one on google: <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/06/california-abandons-equality-under-the-law/"">https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/06/california-abandons-equality-under-the-law/</a> I have a lot more examples, but they go beyond the needs of this argument).&quot;<br />No I am not. I am saying that if you are not adhering to the <b>core principles</b> of a philosophy you claim to hold, you&#39;re arguing <b>against</b> that philosophy and you are being inconsistent. We&#39;ve basically already agreed on this. You agreed that disagreeing with the question is hardline authoritarianism (which is antithetical to libertarianism), so what are we even discussing anymore?<br /><br />&quot;People just cite specific positions on topics as a simple &#39;this kind of position is typically held&#39; comment to illustrate the types of things advocated for. That doesn&#39;t define the limits of the ideology in the slightest.&quot;<br />The CORE PRINCIPLES however DO define the limits of the ideology, it&#39;s the entire foundation of an ideology. Ideologies still have boundaries, you know. All libertarians adhere to the same core principles, that&#39;s why they are all called libertarian. Same with every other ideology. You can&#39;t just say &#39;individual liberty&#39; is &#39;typically held&#39; by libertarians, you already agreed that it is THE CORE of libertarianism.<br /><br />&quot;Arbitrarily declaring &#39;contradicts libertarian ideals&#39; simply because something doesn&#39;t match up with the popular position on a topic is not a valid statement.&quot;<br />Calling out a violation of the CORE PRINCIPLE of libertarianism is NOT arbitrary. I&#39;ll say it again, we already agreed on this: individual liberty is the core principle of libertarianism and disagreeing with the statement is hardline authoritarian. Both of those points can be found in YOUR replies.<br /><br />&quot;&#39;I start to see a recurring pattern&#39; and here you are going to ad hominem statements true and true. Not to mention misrepresentation and outright putting words in my mouth. Neato.&quot;<br />It&#39;s not an ad-hom to point out exactly how you are shifting the topic. I am referencing multiple callouts that reference concrete instances of you doing exactly that. Nice try deflecting that by dismissing it as an ad-hom.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m not attacking libertarianism or declaring it a bad ideology. I&#39;m stating that YOUR views on the matter are bad and full of logical holes.&quot;<br />EXACTLY. You admit it here yourself. You are attacking MY positions and declaring them inconsistent with libertarianism, instead of defending BEN&#39;s statement as being libertarian. It&#39;s funny that you call my accusation an ad-hom and one sentence later you just admit doing it.",Tronald Dump,2020-08-06T09:53:44Z,1
"Part 2:<br />Next one is a doozy. More words in mouth and misrepresentation ahoy! &quot;conflating the current legal system with a purely libertarian one&#39;? No, I&#39;m not. The bit you quoted, was again, in context to the rest of my statements on drugs. In paricular, it was pointing out that drug dealers are, by libertarian standards, infringing on the rights of others by selling illegal drugs that have no benefit, that they know will cause physical and mental harm to those they sell them to. Which you could easily apply the same argument to the selling/production of pornography if you view it as harmful. <br /><br />The next bit is quite amusing. Calling something a &#39;great evil&#39; implicitly means you believe it to be harmful. Particularly in this context. You are arguing against my statement by agreeing with me, while claiming you don&#39;t agree. Neat. <br /><br />The regulation by agreement nonsense statement, which you again chopped out of the rest of the relevant statements, was referring to you playing dumb about what it entailed. Also, chalk one up for accusing the other party of projection because you can&#39;t actually argue a point. Accusing someone of projection in an argument is the equivalent of shouting &#39;no u&#39;, at this point I&#39;m half-expecting the Hitler card to make an appearance.<br />The rest of your commentary on the regulation by agreement consists of you strawmanning to high holy hell. <br />I mentioned regulation by agreement because it is in fact a fundamental idea in Libertarian ideology. Also because it is one of the only ways to regulate without government intervention. You also seem to somehow have missed the part about &#39;agreed upon penalties&#39;. You know, those things that if you make an agreement to, and then break the rules related, you are legally obligated to pay/suffer the penalties you agreed to? It would be enforced by way of agreement, and breaches would be handled by expulsion from the group and legal means. You know, that HOA association I mentioned in a different section? That sort of thing. <br /><br />&quot;specifically talking about local as opposed to federal on a legal basis&#39; Yes, but what is being defined as &#39;local&#39;? What is he referring to as &#39;legal&#39;? He could very easily be referring to agreed upon community enforcement rules. Again, I mentioned HOA for a reason .<br />Also &#39;unironically if you don&#39;t like it leave argument&#39;? To an extent, it&#39;s more along the lines of to move in/be involved with that group, you have to agree to the terms. <br /><br />&#39;seems really contrived&#39; for an Orthodox Jew to reference religious law? Definitely not. I never stated I strongly believed he was talking about religious law. I mentioned it as a possibility. Also, religious law is &#39;legal law&#39; to those that are part of their religions. It&#39;s a set of laws for which they can be punished by a higher authority to varying degrees. Literally only distinction is that the higher authority in question isn&#39;t the US government. They are a set of rules that people of that religion tend to form their lives around. <br /><br />&quot;hold a political speaker with a lot of influence to a higher intellectual standard&quot;? Bruh. We don&#39;t hold our politicians to intellectual standards, but to political ones. We would be much better off if we held them to intellectual standards (we&#39;d have a fair number of elections to re-run, if we suddenly implemented intelligence requirements), but then that interferes with the whole &#39;representation&#39; aspect of representatives.<br /> Why should commentators be held to different ones than we hold our politicians to?

"I will agree that it is weird to see Thatcher so close to Hitler. I also have my doubts about the scale, which I will get back on later. However, I disagree with Shapiro&#39;s reason to reject the scale. Thatcher was actually quite authoritarian, and should be placed quite high. Hitler (and Stalin for that matter) however, compared to Thatcher, are way more extreme authoritarians. If Thatcher was an 8/10, they&#39;d be a 100/10. However, this problem could be fixed if we would consider the social y-axis as a logarithmic one, meaning that y&#39;=y+1 means y&#39; is 10 times more authoritarian then y. Finally, I do like that Hitler is placed in the center-right. Because extreme-right is always considered to be synonymous with Hitler/ Nazi&#39;s. However, economically, Hitler was not all that far-right. Hitler cared very much about the economic well-being of the small guy (as long as the small guy was non-Jewish, Arian, etc), which is one of the main reasons he was so popular among the broke proletariat in the beginning. So no: atleast economically, Hitler was not at all far right, rather centrist. Disclaimer: Hitler was a filthy Nazi who commited genocide and killed millions of people, me stating the few arguably positive facts about him does not mean I praise him in the slightest. I am trying to defend the economically right over here, not Hitler. Hitler had little to do with right-wing economic points of few.<br /><br />Getting back on to my criticism about the scale, I have a serious problem with the 2-dimensionality of the scale since a lot of SJW types who would fall into left libertarian category are trying to push their ideas in a very authoritarion way. An antifa rioter may believe strongly in the liberties of African-Americans and LGBTQ+, but try to achieve their vision of their human right by authoritaritively forcing it upon to others. A liberal SJW is therefore inherently contradictive. For the libertarian side of the y-axis, a third axis should be added: how do you want to acquire this liberty? By peaceful, diplomatic, natural methods (liberty 2, think Gandhi(left) or most Libertarians (right)?)? Or by forceful, violent methods (SJWs (left), Dick Cheney (Right))?",J W,2020-07-25T18:16:06Z,0

"&#39;A significant advantage of a one party system is that it avoids delays in the governmental system&#39; (Paraphrasing, but covers the meaning of the actual phrase). This is such a dumb question since: yes, the statement is almost objectively true. Having only one party in all pillars of government would incredicly speed up the lawmaking process. However, this does not at all mean I, or anyone else agreeing with this statement, is pro CCP or pro dictatorship. I fundamentally believe a plurality of parties are necessary to keep each other in check, even though it greatly delays the lawmaking process. I&#39;d rather have a government producing good laws glacierly slow, than a dictatorship pumping out many horrific policies every day.

"@Julio Lopez Yeah it&#39;s similar for me. While I don&#39;t like it, I recognize you have to compromise on your morals beliefs somewhat to the benefit of social cohesion. If first trimester abortions are allowed, they should at least be socially discouraged. So basically, if you do make them legal, at least make sure people are shunned if they don&#39;t have very good reasons to do it. That would make sure they stay somewhat rare and limited to somewhat justifiable cases",Dissected Wombat,2020-10-03T23:41:22Z,0
"@Julio Lopez I think I&#39;m a good example of your point. <br />I consider myself to be generally libertarian, and most people would identify me as one. I&#39;m for absolute free speech, gun rights, drug legalization, low taxes, small government, etc, etc. <br />Many if not most libertarians seem to also be for open or at least very weak borders and strongly pro-choice though. I&#39;m neither of those. I consider strong borders and low immigration to be a necessity due to circumstances more than anything. If we had less of a welfare state and less theocratic shitholes and murderous ideologies in the world, I&#39;d be for open borders too. In case of abortion, for me it&#39;s actually the libertarian position to be pro-life. As long as the mother freely chose to take the risk and is at no or low risk of dying or serious health complications she has no right to dodge responsibility and kill the child (so I do exclude rape, contraceptive malfunction, mothers in risk of dying and stuff like that). It has individual rights like anyone else, and to ignore those is to ignore the core pillar of libertarianism to me",Dissected Wombat,2020-10-02T20:10:54Z,0

"Just something to think about- Pornography as a whole is very very harmful to people&#39;s brains. It changes the way people think about sex. It&#39;s such a disgusting and watered-down version of what sex really is, depicting it as something only for personal pleasure and not something special you share with your partner. It&#39;s unrealistic, it teaches young people and adults alike that women should be seen as objects, and it actually hinders some people to enjoy real sex because they are only aroused by porn. Not even to mention that Pornhub and other Mindgeek sites do NOT regulate child pornograpahy and sex trafficking and ultimately monopolize on these horrible crimes.

"1. If economic globalization is inevitable, it should primarily serve humanity <b>rather</b> than the interests of the trans-national corporations.<br />The question is if you agree that in case the interest of transnational corporations conflicts with the interest of humanity then economic globalization should serve humanity first.<br />The question didn&#39;t implicate that only a top-down government can serve humanity first.<br /><br />2.

It is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by manipulating money and contributing nothing to society.<br />You&#39;re right that the word <b>many</b> implies that many rich people don&#39;t contribute to society. But you sound like no rich people just manipulate money without practical contributions to society. High-frequency-trading could be such an example. Or day-trading. I am not saying that stuff like this should be illegal, but the question just asked you if you find it <b>regrettable</b> if many people contribute nothing to society while getting rich.<br /><br />5. The rich are too highly taxed.<br />I won&#39;t deny that rich people pay for lots of stuff. But this is not the real question here. The question is if you think that the world we live in has an unstable wealth distribution that needs to be corrected. Taxes have been a valuable tool to make the wealth distributionless steep.<br /><br />6. Those with the ability to pay should have access to higher standards of medical care.<br />If the reinvestment thing is the only thing that stopped you from clicking &quot;Disagree&quot;, what do you think about still letting the rich pay as much as they would pay for higher standards, for example through a medical tax, but giving everyone the same standard of medical care? This wouldn&#39;t stop investments or competition as private companies compete for the state&#39;s investment instead of the investment by the rich people.<br /><br />7.

"Marriage is step one. Having/adopting children is step 2. This is the logical, biological and spiritual order of things. All religions in spite of their differences agree on that. Let us listen to the Truly Enlightened Teachers and advanced spiritual leaders, not to our own reasoning and false logic. Let &quot;Thy&quot; Will be done, not &quot;my&quot; will be done. What is built on falsehood is false. A false marriage, even if it was legalized, is still false. This means that step 1 is corrupted. Therefore, step 2 i.e. adoption is not even an issue to be discussed or allowed in a false marriage. Please stop &quot;saving&quot; these &quot;poor orphans&quot;, by ruining their mental health and confusing them forever. You are not more generous than God. You don&#39;t love these &quot;poor orphans&quot; more than Him. You are not more generous than Him. You don&#39;t know better than Him. Enough false logic. He is their Father and Mother and will take care of them. Stop trying to take his role and teach Him how to do things and suggest alternatives to His Teachings cuz you know better. That&#39;s like someone asking for medication to be healed. And your reply is: I don&#39;t have medication. But I will offer you candy to remove the pain, and will also cut both of your legs, and damage your brain for life. if an orphan was not offered adoption by a straight couple, &quot;let it be&quot;.&quot;‚ÄòPeople do not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God&quot;. You don&#39;t get to twist their lives with a false marriage, cuz you &quot;think&quot; it&#39;s good. Sorry Ben but your answer was wrong and you don&#39;t know better than God.<br /><br />+ a same-sex couple can <del>never</del> generate children, neither a million years before, nor a million years later. Child-bearing and child-rearing is never biologically part of that design, how can it be psychologically part of that design. heterosexual couples who have infertility resort to adoption. but infertility is not the norm. Child-bearing and Child-rearing is not just a biological fusion of male and female, but a psychological one. Forcing child-rearing on a unit that can <del>never</del> by itself generate kids is child abuse, not &quot;saving orphans&quot;. <br /><br />this is the divine order and design of things. but of course, western people who are know-it-alls, who have false human logic, instead of divine logic, who have self-worship, huge egos, rampant narcissism know better.

"‚Äã@jtnachos16 No I am not reading extra shit into it. Commercialization is the privatization of a service or product in part or in whole.  Privatization means it is being turned over for commercial interests, ie to be run/sold as a profit.  Hence why I mentioned govt outsources its services to private companies. They then provide you the service on behalf of the govt.  My company was given part of NHS and after three people died due to my company not getting aid money out to patients the UK pulled their contract. You again can commercialize a service in part or in whole.<br /><br />&quot;&#39;All of these tests assume you know the subjects&#39;? Then they aren&#39;t very good political compass tests if they require advanced knowledge on specific subjects. &quot;<br /><br />They assume you do not live in a cave and understand things like gun control and do not need to read 12 pages to understand gun control.  Again, I have taken 4 of these type tests and all of them I come up in the same relative section. I did not have to reword the questions. Ben is beefing that the test is skewed to make him a leftist. You do know we all can hold ideas on either side of the left or right?<br /><br />&quot;Most the actual bottled water brands do in fact pull water from less polluted sources than what tap water is pulled from. They also tend to routinely test as less contaminated than tap water, aside from microplastics. There is in fact FDA regulation on bottled water, including specifications on allowed processes and sanitation requirements, as well as officially labeling water drawn from underground sources. &quot;<br /><br />This is once again false and you can chunk aside WaPo if you want but there were plenty of other sources saying the same thing about water supplies.  The vast majority of bottled water comes from tap water in the US.  Tap water comes from a variety of sources to include spring water. SoCal water comes a lot from the Sierra Nevada snow which contributes to springs. FDA does not require certified testing and for them to post their results. They require a food label. This is not the same with the EPA. Municipal water sources are regulated by the EPA. It is through marketing over the last 3 some decades that have gotten people to believe bottled water is better than tap. It apparently got you to believe all these companies follow stringent regulations that are constantly monitored by the FDA. Hence why I mentioned make up and wine. People paying higher prices believe they are getting better products when they are not.<br /><br />&quot;why do you think government should regulate if not inherently harmful&#39;? Because, like anything, it can be abused for the sake of profit and stifling potential competition.&quot;<br /><br />I find this amazingly smack in the face. EVERYTHING being sold can be abused for the sake of profit and stifling competition. Oddly which you deem as hyperbole. So saying something is not inherently harmful when the govt has to come in and make sure they are not screwing up is moot.<br /><br />The question as is would be is commercialization of water harmful.  Yes or no.  Yes, because it then requires the govt to monitor the water supply as well as the quality of the water. It requires more govt, more authority. No, because market forces will control these companies. One is a more of an authoritarian stance while the other is more of a libertarian stance, ie NAP. The Market will self correct. People will stop buying from the bad company and a good company will rise who will do the right thing. So if we HAVE to regulate this type of industry then YES it is harmful to commercialize it because in so doing those companies are going to keep eating up more and more of the water supply.<br /><br />You have two people with lots next to each and each builds a well. Each sees the well as the source of their water and neither has a right to go onto the others land and pull water from the others well. Tiny problem both wells more than like have the same water source. One of them decides to pull 10 times the water from their well because they want to bottle and sell it. The other notices that the amount of water in their well is falling.  But hey good to know that the idea of commercialization of water in of itself is not harmful but oddly the practice of it NEEDS govt oversight.<br /><br />&quot;I also think you completely and utterly misunderstand Shapiro&#39;s position on government regulation. He&#39;s of the opinion that the government doesn&#39;t need to heavily regulate trade and that the market will naturally force competition and beneficial actions (this is somewhat true when dealing with markets with multiple established large competitors, but developing markets and certain fields need additional oversight to prevent a monopoly being formed).&quot;<br /><br />Shapiro claims to be a Libertarian as well and that is the viewpoint I am giving from having to talk to them for the last 35+ years.  Plus what does heavily mean? The hyperbole is in the term regulations because the assumption is the govt is up these companies butts all the time when this is not the case.  Bottle water is not heavily regulated. It is also not a developing market but an established one for 30 plus some years. It is simply ever expanding as corporations demand growth every year. HENCE why the commercialization of water IS harmful.<br /><br />It is again laughable that you ONLY see harm in that the govt is not doing some kind of special job as if the companies themselves do not have agency. It is not that you did not say companies do bad but brushed the blame to the govt simply not doing its job. So you speeding is the fault of a cop? We should just get more cops on the road so they can regulate more, right?<br /><br />&quot;this is somewhat true when dealing with markets with multiple established large competitors,&quot;<br /><br />No, it is not somewhat true.

"@Devin MacGregor So, a whole lot of ranting and raving calling other people &#39;fuckwits&#39; and &#39;rubes&#39; for having different views and not reading a specific thing into the statement in the quiz that wasn&#39;t stated outright. <br />As well as arbitrarily defining privatization as &#39;item is being sold commerically&#39; Even when your own statements directly indicate that the thing in question hasn&#39;t actually been privatized. Neat. <br /><br />Most the actual bottled water brands do in fact pull water from less polluted sources than what tap water is pulled from. They also tend to routinely test as less contaminated than tap water, aside from microplastics. There is in fact FDA regulation on bottled water, including specifications on allowed processes and sanitation requirements, as well as officially labeling water drawn from underground sources. <br /><br />None of your &#39;devil&#39;s advocate&#39; statements are remotely arguing against an actual statement I made, or countering my statements in the slightest.<br />&#39;why do you think government should regulate if not inherently harmful&#39;? Because, like anything, it can be abused for the sake of profit and stifling potential competition. <br /><br />You also do a lot of extreme hyperbolizing to assert people as holding positions they don&#39;t actually have. <br /><br />&#39;All of these tests assume you know the subjects&#39;? Then they aren&#39;t very good political compass tests if they require advanced knowledge on specific subjects. <br />Furthermore, as stated earlier, you are the one placing a specific context on the statement in the quiz, despite the wording of the statement not giving it that context. <br /><br />Also, you linked WaPo, I don&#39;t believe a word out of their mouths, their bias causes massive issues and they have been  known to print blatant falsehoods. <br /><br />There is nothing wrong with commercializing &#39;necessities&#39; so long as the commercial method of obtainment is not the ONLY available method. You should not have to pay for bottled water, that&#39;s not in question. At the same time, in every area with a functioning, semi-competent government, bottled water isn&#39;t replacing available sources like tapwater. It&#39;s being sold as an additional option. <br /><br />My statements are pretty implicit in stating that private companies are doing bad when they screw up water sources, simply by stating outright that they need government regulation to maintain standards and prevent abuse. But it&#39;s also 100% reasonable to point out that companies only get away with shit because the government fails to step in to stop them. <br /><br /><br />I also think you completely and utterly misunderstand Shapiro&#39;s position on government regulation. He&#39;s of the opinion that the government doesn&#39;t need to heavily regulate trade and that the market will naturally force competition and beneficial actions (this is somewhat true when dealing with markets with multiple established large competitors, but developing markets and certain fields need additional oversight to prevent a monopoly being formed). <br />However, I don&#39;t think he would remotely deny the need for government protections of citizen&#39;s rights and essential items management. <br /><br />Again, you are the one reading extra shit into the question and then taking umbrage because others read it as written and responded as such.",jtnachos16,2020-08-08T00:18:42Z,0
"@jtnachos16 Holy fuck wits you guys read far too much into these questions.  I took this and three other tests and ALL of them have me relatively in the same FUCKING spot but you bastards are already yelling conspiracy at the questions.<br /><br />First off fucking bottle water comes from tap water as well not simply a leprechauns anus of pure mountain freshness and it is a fucking assumption it is a premium service when it is not.  It is just being marketed like that for obvious rubes like yourself who buy expensive wine and perfume which has had the same marketing done to it. This is where the poors laugh at you.<br /><br />I used to work in Irrigation. You typically cannot own a lake or a river unless you own the land and made the lake yourself. You dig a well on your land, that is your source. You own it.  &quot;The FDA does not require bottled water companies to use certified laboratories for water quality testing or to report test results. The FDA does require bottled water labels to list ingredients and nutritional information.&quot; Govt water sources are regulated by the EPA.<br /><br />The harm that it does is it gets people like you to think the water is better than the tap water. Psst, generally it is not better unless we are talking Flint MI. This sows misguided trust that privately run is better than govt run. Bottled water is environmentally unfriendly plus contains microplastics which you are ingesting.<br /><br />Water management companies are PRIVATE companies that have been contracted by local and state to manage the water for them to save on costs. It is called outsourcing. I work for an ITO that is global that does both govt and commercial and when you call the govt, it is probably us answering the phones. My point?  Psst in spite of any regulations these companies will and do cut corners.<br /><br />&quot;My whole point, was that the issues with privatized water, are because local government fails to do it&#39;s duty in making sure corporations don&#39;t harm the public with their actions. <br />That&#39;s not a &#39;private good&#39; statement.&quot;<br /><br />Devil&#39;s Advocate: You did not state that either. Privatization IS the commercialization of the product, ie water. Here again you are placing blame on govt for what a private entity does. Why do you assume govt should regulate water if it is not harmful to commercialize it?  According to Ben won&#39;t then another company come along and say hey we will do it right and then the bad company will go out of business as people say hey that company does water wrong so we will not buy it. And Ben wondered why he did not score better as a libertarian. What you are implying is these companies will not do the right thing unless the govt is shining a flashlight up their butts.  That not a very Benism.<br /><br />&quot;At no point have I implied private ownership of water sources by corporations was a good thing.&quot;<br /><br />Devil&#39;s Advocate.  At no point did you imply the other way either other than to place the blame on govt. Doesn&#39;t Nestle own the water it sells?<br /><br />You can take this source anyway you like:<br /><br />&quot;In 2016, Crystal Geyser paid a timber company for access to a spring that had historically provided the water for the city of Weed, Calif., forcing the town to find a new water supply.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Nestl√© has drawn criticism for its bottling operation in California‚Äôs San Bernardino National Forest, which federal officials have concluded is ‚Äúdrying up‚Äù creeks.<br /><br /><br />‚Äú[The creeks] are visibly different where the water is extracted and where it‚Äôs not,‚Äù said Michael O‚ÄôHeaney, executive director of the Story of Stuff Project, a California-based group that makes films about environmental issues.&quot;<br /><br />Oh there is more in the article but see it requires one to know and be educated on the &quot;commercialization&quot; of water and what it has been doing or be like Ben and make vanilla counter questions that are not actually addressing the issues.

"@Devin MacGregor Welp. Here&#39;s where you show you have ZERO ability to make an actual argument against the one the opposing party put forward, rather than placing words in their mouth. <br />&#39;did the question state at all that tap water was available&#39;? It certainly didn&#39;t state it wasn&#39;t. <br />&#39;based on the concept of privatizing water&#39; No. Nowhere in the question is that specifically said. It reads as referring to commercializing water, not privatizing it.<br />You can&#39;t rail me for making the statement that it doesn&#39;t specify context, then turn around and add context that isn&#39;t there yourself. That sinks your supposed argument before you&#39;ve even made it. <br />&#39;did you just ASSUME bottle water is better&#39;?<br /> It generally goes through more purification stages, aims for a consistent quality level, isn&#39;t affected by infrastructure/water issues in the purchaser&#39;s area,  and tends to be taken from closer to origin (IE, the spring, rather than the river) than city tap water is. It&#39;s usually of higher purity than tap or well water. <br />&#39;water management companies&#39;?<br /> You mean utility companies that are directly managed by local government and have to follow directives from local level government and follow specific rules set by said government? <br />&#39;hey, nice to imply private good, government bad&#39;?<br />Here you are just putting words in my mouth so you can attack a position that was never made. My whole point, was that the issues with privatized water, are because local government fails to do it&#39;s duty in making sure corporations don&#39;t harm the public with their actions. <br />That&#39;s not a &#39;private good&#39; statement. That&#39;s pointing out that the governments in these areas have duties they aren&#39;t fulfilling.

"Gram T oh noooo haha not liberty hangout. i forgot they existed imo until you reminded me. liberty hangout really be out here üò≠<br /><br />nah but a lot of pseudointellectuals like shapiro will defend free speech contextually when it matters for them (like in the case of a campus cancelling a speech from a conservative) but then turn around and try and tear down the freedom of speech of others. shapiro for example wrote an article literally making the case for disallowing art he didn&#39;t like, saying quote: &quot;The right to free expression in art should not include a right to film yourself having an abortion; neither should it include a right to use feces, urine or any other bodily fluid in public, nor should it include a right to engage in sex acts before live audiences.&quot; basically saying art shouldn&#39;t include anything icky and gross because... he thinks so.<br /><br />he also argued that flag burning should be illegal.<br /><br />besides, defending your own freedom of speech is easy. the real litmus test for a freedom of speech advocate is to defend the speech of others. speech you don&#39;t like. it&#39;s no coincidence that you&#39;ve never heard commentators like this defending the freedom of speech of a leftist. for example you&#39;ll never hear them raise the issue of disciplinary action against leftist professors who have supporter BDS (boycotts against the isreali government) or anything like it. <br />whereas i hear left wing commentators defending the freedom of speech of conservatives all of the time. but never the other way around simply because grifters like shapiro don&#39;t actually believe in freedom of speech as a principle.<br /><br />the list of other facist strategies goes on and i do kind of define facists by the methods that they use. he certainly fits the bill.",Hampus Lundberg,2020-07-07T18:02:10Z,2

"I think Ben seems to misunderstand where the questions are coming from when he accuses them of having a leftist angle. The idea of the test is to force you to take an ideological position on something. A lot of the topics asked about are very complex, but it&#39;s meant to be a reasonably quick test to take so obviously they don&#39;t have the time to flesh out every aspect of social and economic  attitudes. The questions get deliberately decontextualised at times to bring it back to the basic ideological premise, which is not ideal but it is necessary for this particular test. And the way that you interpret the questions and think about them also reflects how you approach things politically, and the test is designed to invoke those sort of instincts.",Primordial Toast,2020-06-25T11:36:51Z,0

"Regardless of how you feel about abortion, making abortions illegal won&#39;t make them go away. For example, in some African countries, abortion is completely outlawed, while in others it is regulated. In 2012, nearly seven per 1,000 women of reproductive age in Africa were treated for complications from unsafe abortion. Around 1.6 million women in the region are treated for such complications each year. Four countries in Africa have relatively liberal abortion laws: Zambia permits abortion for health and socioeconomic reasons, whereas Cape Verde, South Africa and Tunisia permit abortion without restriction as to reason, with gestational limits. Unsafe abortion has negative consequences beyond its immediate effects on individual women‚Äôs health. Treating complications increases the economic burden on poor families and incurs considerable costs to already struggling public health systems.

Because talking about democracy is all well and good but in order for democracy to exist in the first place there needs to be your team AND the other team. So no matter how much you hate that other team you need it for a fair system of democracy where the choice is left to the people. If you would not have both Democrats and Republicans (as far as the USA goes) then you would be living in a country where one side would rule everything, and that isn&#39;t democracy since you wouldn&#39;t have a choice at all. Be glad you get to vote, it&#39;s not a right everyone in the wold has, but at the same time you need to allow other people to think differently.

What I wondered was how do the questions pin you to an objective concept of political ideology, generally, but also through time. The questions that made you left leaning 80 years ago versus what makes you left leaning today I imagine are very different. The divisive topics we have today look nothing like they did in the past. If the questions are rooted in hot topics of the society that they are in, then are they also relative to the overall politics of that society? What if the baseline is skewed?

"I actually think that Shapiro ended up where he really is in all honesty. <br /><br />Although I do agree he does overestimate how libertarian he is, I don‚Äôt think being in the middle is all that bad. I feel like those certain questions where he was having trouble showed his conservative morals and libertarian morals fighting one another. What does baffle me, however, is everyone trying to claim that he isn‚Äôt libertarian at all. I can almost bet that‚Äôs because they can‚Äôt identify the difference between authoritarianism from conservatism. There are some shared ideas, but same goes for authoritarianism and liberalism, libertarianism and conservatism, etc. There‚Äôs a reason why there‚Äôs 4 boxes and not 2. <br /><br />I don‚Äôt know why you have to be an extremist to share values with certain groups.

Like food, shelter, clean water, good healthcare, ability to get to work,etc.?<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=3m20s"">3:20</a> Why is it bad? How about this how much does it cost you to use a gallon of water? Now If that is the price of water per gallon and the plastic they use is also minimal along with delivery.  Why is it so dang expensive?  I would be fine if it doesn&#39;t have huge mark ups.  Also some people don&#39;t have access to tap water easily.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=3m39s"">3:39</a> Well land is naturally owned by the government if no one has yet staked a claim to it yet. It usually doesn&#39;t cost anything<br />but you will eventually have to pay property tax. Then that property becomes a commodity. <br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=4m00s"">4:00</a> Your explanation IS what they meant by manipulating money.  Also the stock market is another good example of this concept.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=4m25s"">4:25</a>  Well if it is only their shareholders what about the customers?  If it isn&#39;t social responsible to its customers then the company goes under because who would want the product then?<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=4m40s"">4:40</a> Ok lets look at diminishing returns.  A person making 10M/year is taxed lets say 30% and 30% for everything else.  Lets say the 30% is too high.  At what point would you want the tax rate to be? You have already 4M extra per year after taxes and other expenses.  How is 4M that much different than say 4.5M (tax would be 25%) if you are not going to spend it?  If anything taxes should be higher because then you would be making public institutions better (roads, schools, first responders).<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=5m20s"">5:20</a>  How is that a political left thing? You reframing it made it more of a political right.  I would still agree with either statement regardless.  Everyone should have at least some access to basic healthcare without bankrupting them.  If people can pay more for better care go for it.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=5m50s"">5:50</a> Diamonds and Oil were natural monopolies or did you forget about that in economic class?<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=6m00s"">6:00</a> Why? Religious views? What about cases of rape and incest? What about contraceptives failing?<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=6m35s"">6:35</a> And later you will contradict yourself at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=10m10s"">10:10</a><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=6m54s"">6:54</a> So then you disagree with the statement then? You just switched who the blame is (depends on the age of the student). Also your explanation more or less contradicts your selecting.  What kind of schools do most kids go to? That is the question you have to ask.  I say this later but most kids go to public school.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=7m40s"">7:40</a> So you just admitted that you knew what they were trying to get out of you so does that mean you are actually agree with that statement? If not give an actual reason why you strongly disagree.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=7m55s"">7:55</a> I agree also.  Although your comment to the question would parents keeping secrets from their kids wrong? Why?<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=9m05s"">9:05</a> And the way you changed that question makes even more nonsense. And since you disagree with that statement are you saying there are uncivilized or savage cultures and there are no different cultures?  That makes it sound that there are only civilized people and noncivilized people (only fair because you are saying people and culture are the same).  With that depending that regions culture they would be the civilized ones while you maybe noncivilized.  This then makes you sound xenophobic (not afraid aspect but more on the aspect of I hate new things that isn&#39;t familiar to me).<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=9m15s"">9:15</a> So would you still strongly agree with that statement if you got offered the job but then realized you were lied to about the work culture there (valid scenario based on that statement)? Or that the offer is a possible scam? If there is any doubt on those questions you should have just did agree not strongly.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=10m10s"">10:10</a> So you like the eye-of-an-eye policy then? Killing in the name of justice is just as bad as the person doing the crime.  Also ironically it is more expensive to kill someone than it is life in prison.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=10m25s"">10:25</a>  Shows how cultured you are.  I find some forms music distasteful.  If I find it distasteful is it still music? Yes it is.  If you find a &quot;blank&quot; canvass not abstract art. Someone else might.  This also show how self-centered you are.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=10m35s"">10:35</a> Punishment is retribution which is literally means payback.  Well at least you are consistent with killing certain criminals question.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=12m00s"">12:00</a> I would point out various people who would vehemently disagree with your point here but you will probably just ignore them.  One of them being AnticitizenX (Youtuber).<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=12m05s"">12:05</a> I would have said disagree because with agreeing you have to rely with people with a lot of money being able to help the unfortunate.  A thing I noticed is that people that are in the middle class donate a larger percentage of their disposable income than the rich folk.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=12m27s"">12:27</a> Wait what? You want public schools to violate the 1st amendment?  I would be fine with that if it was a private school but a public school?  It is more likely a child would be in a public school than a private school.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=12m30s"">12:30</a> Why? Just because of your religious views? I find that religion should help one&#39;s self get away from self centered thoughts.<br /><br />Hitler is right? He looks more centered (Left/Right).

@Stelios Klothakis To be honest the people that found the biggest success should be awarded with the amount of money that they have.  It is the issue of them hoarding it and manipulating it to get even more and not help their communities.  Which is why I want loopholes to not exist and effectivly have a minimum tax rate if you are above a given threshold (If you make 10M+ the next 1M is a mandatory 20% even if you have deductions for example).  I think Vaush goes too far (on his own views) but he does have a better sense of what the people of the US feels than Ben.<br /><br />As for Sander I voted for him in primaries.  Biden at least has plans to move things more to the left grant it slowly in some fields like healthcare and education.  I think part of his plan also like Sanders redoing the taxes put in place by Trump.  Sadly though with either one they can&#39;t really do anything if money exists in politics.,Stephen Housman,2020-06-18T22:36:08Z,0
"@Stephen Housman Well, at least you recognize the failures of unregulated capitalism.<br />Tbh, in this day and age where a socialist revolution doesn&#39;t have even a remote possibility of happening, <br />I have to say, there really isn&#39;t much of a difference between the positions progressives (social democrats) and socialists hold.<br />We both think Bernie should have been the way forward (the only difference is that we radicals don&#39;t really think even the best reforms could ever be enough to balance out the toll that capitalist exploitation takes on the working class).<br />I personally really wanted to see him win the presidency so that the idea of transitioning to worker owned co-ops could gain some traction, and so labor unionism could be normalized again (measures that would help people regain, to some extent, more of the stolen surplus value that they produce through their labour).<br /><br />Also, forgot to mention it, it was really cool reading your point-by-point analysis of this video. <br />Have a nice day my leftist ally! <br /><br />P.S.

@Stelios Klothakis To be honest I am not a communist.  I am more of a progressive.  I am a Catholic and hate the idea of pushing my faith and morals on to others.  I just want people to think for themselves and do so critically and not be afraid to answer the hard questions.  Once I see people make bad faith arguments they loss my respect.  <br /><br />I have seen several debunk videos of Ben and decided to look at this video to get his political view.  With some of his responses rewording and thinks it was written by leftist (failed to read the instructions at the beginning) makes it seem that he should be more on the authoritarian side of things.  <br /><br />I also noticed during the 2016 election that site collected data (voluntarily) of people&#39;s spectrum numbers and who they voted for.  What was odd is that there were very few people in Ben&#39;s quadrant (&lt;1%) and the ones that were there were blue.  The other 3 were about equal. So something with Ben&#39;s view points doesn&#39;t add up and based on the debunk videos.,Stephen Housman,2020-06-18T21:05:07Z,1

"Lately, I find myself disagreeing with the scale completely TBH.<br />By that I mean... How do you imagine a country which is completely authoritarian - therefore regulates every aspect of your life by law - but is still economically right-wing, so it allows you to have any business you want, without controlling how you run it? And on the other end of the spectrum - how do you imagine a fully communist state, where the entire economy is controlled by the state, but your life isn&#39;t, and you can do whatever the hell you want?<br /><br />I mean, if you can make any business you want, you could make a business which charges $0.01 for an activity which is otherwise illegal, and technically, by these standards, that should make it legal - since you have completely free market. And if it is illegal to create such business, then it stops being a free market, since you have a GO or NGO which controls which businesses are allowed and which are not.<br /><br />And on the other end of the spectrum - if you can&#39;t trade, then what can you do? You have to eat before anything else, and if the state controls the flow of food, then it also controls you. The many failures of communism also prove that as soon as you start controlling food production, people don&#39;t want to work there, so you have to force them to work, and if you force people to work... How is that a free/libertarian society?<br /><br />IMO there is only one axis there and it&#39;s collectivism/authoritarianism on the left end and libertarianism/anarchism on the other, with both of these extremes being impossible to reach in practice, so you can only decide how much regulation are you willing to introduce at the cost of personal freedoms.",Xoruam,2020-06-17T18:41:53Z,0

"So, I will admit the compass is very flawed. But I can see why you&#39;re so close to the line between Authoritarian and Libertarian. Just to give one example, abortion. It doesn&#39;t really matter if it&#39;s right or wrong, making abortion illegal is inherently more Authoritarian than Libertarian. Laws telling people what they can and can&#39;t do is more government control. That&#39;s why people who are against anti-abortion laws are more Libertarian than Authoritarian, no matter what they&#39;re reason is (which is where the flaws of the compass get so visible.)<br /><br />And yes, laws against murder, rape, robbery, anything really is always more Authoritarian than Libertarian. That is why even most liberal people, who agree those laws should exist, are good and do good, are not completely at the bottom in &#39;anarchy&#39; axis.<br /><br />As for Hitler and Thatcher, they are in really different places, even if it seems they are close by the virtue of being in the same quadrant. Hitler is not socialist (no matter what his party name says. He himself said that his party name had nothing to do with Marxist socialism. And it&#39;s not like it&#39;s anything new for people in power to name things to look better (see Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea).<br /><br />Also, you have to remember that this compass is made with the whole world in mind. American political spectrum is really stunted after cold war, with barely any politician actually being on the Left side (Bernie Sanders is there (libertarian quadrant), but just barely. People who say he&#39;s a communist just don&#39;t know what communism looks like. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Donald Trump all are in Authoritarian Right, as hard as it is to believe, though not remotely close to each other, just like Thatcher and Hitler). Again, this compass is extremely flawed with questions being very vague and not taking in the reasoning, but it represents where you approximately are fairly accurately.",Intergalactical Commitee of Procrastination,2020-06-17T14:54:51Z,0

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=5m11s"">5:11</a> big principle in medicine though is the idea of Justice meaning that everyone receives the same quality of care and access to care irregardless of their ability to pay, or personal circumstances (race, gender, age, criminal record, etc.). That should mean that you get the best treatment in terms of equipment, trained staff, and medications possible, but the question of what is best is affected by the cost. Whether in the UK with the NHS or elsewhere in the world, medical facilities also have to weigh up the price of treatment, which ties in two more ideas from the 4 medical ethics of non-maleficence and beneficence. If you have two drugs, for example, and both have proven through testing to achieve the same result with the same dosage, and one is cheaper and easier to produce but takes a little longer to be effective or has a slightly higher risk associated with it, most places would probably end up stocking that drug rather than the more expensive one to produce- because if the slightly higher risk of the cheaper one only affects people who are suffering from a certain condition, then you‚Äôd only have to worry about sourcing the more expensive one for those smaller number of patients. The issue is then at what point does the standard of care differ based on how much you can pay- the difference in how much you‚Äôre paying with healthcare (at least from my perspective) should ideally only affect how comfortable you are (e.g. you get silk bedsheets or a really nice private room if you can pay more), and increase your access to cosmetic or other unnecessary treatments.",M,2020-06-17T14:33:12Z,0

However, whilst I do think he is occasionally successful in structuring arguments, my issue stems from how he packages ultra-conservative rhetoric into a neat compartmentalised world view, which when dissected is hugely contradictory and flawed (there&#39;s plenty of evidence of this on Youtube/online if you want to look into it).

The only reason I would remotely entertain that idea, is because vasectomies are reversible, and because extracting sperm directly for use in in-vitro remains an option as well. <br /><br />This ignores the simple fact that a vasectomy does nothing to stop sexual function, and wouldn&#39;t stop a serial rapist from reoffending. It would just force an operation on a person on the potential that they could do something, which is all kinds of jacked up morally. Especially since abortion remains an option for those the vasectomy would &#39;protect&#39; anyway. <br /><br />The &#39;serial impregnator of one night stands&#39; argument is a lot more nebulous and leads to a ton of issues with proving the person actually intended harm vs being a lazy bastard.",jtnachos16,2020-08-02T17:46:29Z,0

"@Hailey Brown A vasectomy is vastly different from an abortion (which I&#39;m assuming is related to why you asked this question, since I didn&#39;t see any other things it could be relevant to in this discussion, if I&#39;m wrong about what you were referring to, by all means, clarify for me so I can provide a more accurate response), on multiple levels. A vasectomy is a sterilization measure, and only affects one component of a baby, one that does functionally nothing on it&#39;s own. It&#39;s usually done as contraceptive. <br /><br />Abortions, on the other hand, involve destroying a developing human and tend to be repeatable multiple times, depending on the type being done, without really affecting fertility drastically. There is also the fact that except in cases of rape, the woman has at some point made a concious choice to commit actions that lead to a risk of pregnancy. Whether that is not using birth control, or just not caring about that risk until they are pregnant. While birth control can fail, you can also stack the deck by layering methods to make the odds &#39;act of god&#39; level that all methods fail. Simply combining &#39;pull-out&#39; + condom tends to be rather effective, let alone if you also layer an IUD or chemical birth control on from the woman&#39;s end. Generally speaking, if you can&#39;t afford some form of birth control, you don&#39;t have the stable situation to support a child and should at that point be abstaining or not having vaginal sex (for the religious types that are anti birth control, practice the abstinence you preach if you don&#39;t want children). <br />&#39;An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&#39; is very much applicable here.<br /> <br />The difference here, is at what point we should consider a fetus to be a child. I&#39;m not for outright banning abortions, I&#39;m for the idea of reasonable restrictions to prevent people from being stupid and then just going &#39;lol abortion&#39; instead of using contraceptives like a responsible person (and think they should be provided to some degree to sexually active minors with no questions asked. Maybe as a discounted rate or even straight up condom handouts). I&#39;m against the idea of terminating pregnancy for silly reasons like &#39;I refuse to give birth to a boy&#39; or other such nonsense. <br /> <br />Early terminations are &#39;okay&#39;, but keep a record of how many have been done, no later term abortions unless there is a present significant health danger to the mother for continuing the pregnancy. Operate on a 3 strikes policy unless the pregnancy was terminated for a documented health reason. Rape babies would still have to follow the early terminations only policy and still be recorded in medical records, but won&#39;t directly count against the 3 strikes unless there is suspicious patterns or multiple terminations claiming sexual assault. <br />Reasonable restrictions, rather than total freedom to end lives arbitrarily (or alternatively, risking multiple unnecessary procedures that can go bad and cause complications simply because some people are too lazy to take efforts to prevent it from happening). By the same token, not total outlawing.",jtnachos16,2020-08-02T16:53:26Z,0

The biggest thing I disagree about is the rehabilitation in prison systems.

America is the country with the highest prison population and at the same time with the highest incarceration rate per capita, and he talks that what is important is not rehabilitation but &quot;keep criminals out of the streets&quot;.

Cristiano Costa yea I understand where he is coming from and I understand it‚Äôs hard to forgive them or not punish them for life but it‚Äôs been shown over in Portugal like you said and the Northern European countries that smaller sentences and rehabilitation is wayyyy better overall for the return to crime rate and it‚Äôs safer which most people don‚Äôt believe,Cmccarthy1,2020-06-15T21:37:59Z,1
"His moral is largely based on his religious values. I&#39;m admired that he didn&#39;t agree with &quot;eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth&quot;, since he does feel like people should be punished and not rehabilited. Like if there are only good and bad people and not anything in between. A lot of people do mistakes, and it&#39;s easy to judge when we&#39;re outside the situation. In my country, the maximum sentence is 25 years and we&#39;re still the third most peaceful country in the world (portugal).

"@External Dialogue Socialism doesn&#39;t face what problem?  Calculation?  Of course it does.  I quote:  &quot;It was [Mises&#39;] powerful challenge that forced the socialists to recognize the importance of an adequate system of economic accounting in a socialist economy. Even more, it was chiefly due to Professor Mises&#39; challenge that many socialists became aware of the very existence of such a problem.&quot; But the real effect, was to force the socialists to retreat from a pure advocacy of Marxian socialism to a compromise watered down with &quot;competitive&quot; infusions-market socialism.<br /><br />Even if the socialists have been able to create a mighty army of citizens all eager to do the bidding of their masters, what exactly would the socialist planners tell this army to do? How would they know what products to order their eager slaves to produce, at what stage of production, how much of the product at each stage, what techniques or raw materials to use in that production and how much of each, and where specifically to locate all this production? How would they know their costs, or what process of production is or is not efficient?<br /><br />In any economy more complex than the Crusoe or primitive family level, the socialist planning board would simply not know what to do, or how to answer any of these vital questions. Developing the momentous concept of calculation, Mises pointed out that the planning board could not answer these questions because socialism would lack the indispensable tool that private entrepreneurs use to appraise and calculate: the existence of a market in the means of production, a market that brings about money prices based on genuine profit-seeking exchanges by private owners of these means of production. Since the very essence of socialism is collective ownership of the means of production, the planning board would not be able to plan, or to make any sort of rational economic decisions. Its decisions would necessarily be completely arbitrary and chaotic, and therefore the existence of a socialist planned economy is literally impossible&quot; .<br /><br />And socialism does indeed face the incentive problem.

I wish he had been there of course but I wouldn&#39;t say I was at a disadvantage of not having a male role model. Not all men are the same so often the advice given by someone&#39;s father turns out to be complete bullshit. Parents are not some all knowing fountain of how to succeed in life. There is nothing two men could not teach their daughter that a mother could. No-one seems to be able to grasp the concept of gender anyway so I don&#39;t see why it matters what your parents&#39; are. Having a second mother may even have helped you when being bullied as she may have had a different approach than your mother and given you more than just one persons perspective. Ultimately having two parents is obviously better than having one but whether they are two men, two women or a man and a woman is completely irrelevant.",Beta Decay,2020-06-15T14:37:09Z,0

"@Shallex Oh for the love of god. It&#39;s not genital mutilation. Anyone that calls it that is completely uneducated. For it to be &#39;genital mutilation&#39; it has to have no positive effect, it has to have no measurable benefit. The downsides have to notably outway the benefits.<br /> <br />It is a preventative health measure with no measurable downsides. When done on infants by a proper doctor, complications are extremely rare and typically very minor.<br /> It&#39;s also not &#39;done against their will&#39; when it comes to infants. Infants don&#39;t have the cognizance to understand, hence it can be made as a health decision by their parents. Waiting till adulthood actually makes it far more dangerous and is when you run into problems. <br />Showering accessability has nothing to do with it. It&#39;s plain and simple fact that hygiene is far easier to manage with a circumcised penis, as well as numerous studies proving that it reduces the risks of some STDs and reduces the chances of UTIs.<br />Your claims regarding &#39;sensitivity&#39; (which, by the way, nice job backtracking your claim to change it to &#39;less enjoyable sex&#39;) is something that studies are HIGHLY contradictory on, with them frequently being considered highly flawed since they rely on self-reported reactions rather than some sort of objective measure. The presence of nerve endings in the foreskin does not equate to &#39;more pleasure&#39; or &#39;better feeling&#39;. It can actually result in oversensitiveness that makes stimulation less enjoyable, it depends on the person.<br />Much like pain, you cannot measure it objectively, because each person has different tolerances and different relative experiences. Sexual pleasure and enjoyment has a massive non-physical component that drastically alters the results.<br /><br /> Furthermore, the claims that the glans is &#39;more sensitive&#39; are also a personal opinion, not some sort of objective fact.<br />In fact, objective metrics would indicate that the difference is nonexistent biologically, with the perception of a difference coming from it being a newer sensation for the uncircumcised man, not a &#39;better&#39; one. <br /><br />There is no solid consensus on the belief that circumcision removes sensitivity. Their is extremely contradictory studies, with a lot of flack from experts thrown at the methodology used in the most commonly cited studies advocating the claimed loss of sensitivity.<br /><br />And yes, your claim of more sensitivity and circumcision requiring lube because sex is less comfortable do run counter to each other. You apparently cannot logic. <br />If the uncircumcised penis is more sensitive, then why would a circumcised man feel more discomfort from the same acts with a less sensitive penis? Hence, your claims are contradictory.",jtnachos16,2020-06-25T12:35:54Z,0
"@Ky Whitehead Oh my god you are ignorant. <br />The &#39;liber&#39; part of libertarian references &#39;liberty&#39; not &#39;liberal&#39;. <br />Libertarians are proponents of free choice and voluntary association. There is no explicit requirement of &#39;socially liberal&#39;. If being a libertarian required one to be socially liberal, it would be an exclusively left-wing ideology, rather than the primarily centrist position it actually holds, with many variations in ideology present, allowing libertarians to occupy space in both the left and the right.<br />As for Ben&#39;s responses, pay attention to the wording. He&#39;s pro-life because of his religious values. That has EVERYTHING to do with his religion. Even aside from that, being pro-life is not being anti-libertarian. Depending on how you mark when a fetus becomes a person, being pro-life could very easily be argued as believing that the choice to live shouldn&#39;t be made for others, which is very much libertarian. <br />As for &#39;thinks religion should be taught in schools&#39;, the question was whether the schools HIS kids go to should instill religious values. His response was talking about private schools, not public schools, which is an inherently libertarian comment, the belief that parents should be able to choose what schools their children go to. He&#39;s not saying all schools should teach them, he&#39;s saying the schools he chooses for his kids should teach them, and there is absolutely NOTHING wrong or counter to claiming to be libertarian with that.<br />His anti-porn stance also comes back to his religious views, and his ultimate comments regarding access to porn, was that it &#39;isn&#39;t a right&#39;, that he&#39;s morally opposed to pornography, and that it isn&#39;t  the government&#39;s place to restrict porn. <br />None of this contradicts Libertarian ideology.",jtnachos16,2020-06-24T18:30:56Z,0

"Taxtro the reason Christianity grew in the Roman Empire. While being ACTIVELY SUPPRESSED, and around 290 BC getting genocided in the great purge was because the Bible taught to be philanthropic. To be kind to the old, the poor, the sick. The Greco-Roman culture of the time was very opposed to these values, rather, it was for the rich. Also, the Roman Empire is the only country close to the diversity of the US, and the idea from the Bible, that regardless of ethnicity you were equal before god was first seen in Judaism. Christians didn‚Äôt [force people to join a religion actively suppressed by the government, people saw it, saw everything else, and chose Christianity.

"@Cristiano Costa you&#39;re right as far as the way we view liberals and socialism. Most of us look at liberalism as control. American liberals want (their government) to control not only the economy but the way we think and speak. I&#39;m a libertarian at heart because I believe we need as little government interference as possible. We of course have to have a military and rules governing some markets to minimize monopolies, but even that can be dangerous in that it nurtures corporate corruption of our elected leaders, like it is now with both parties having media backing in one for or another spewing lies and no one actually fighting for the people.",notta cracka,2020-06-16T00:09:07Z,0
"‚Äã@notta cracka Stalin is also conservative, in a sense that any liberal idea: free thought and free were not tolerated, the most extreme conservative regime is a totalitarian one (that&#39;s why i agree with you, Hitler like Mao is a conservative leader). The most extreme liberal regime is an anarchy btw.<br /><br />Of course most conservatives don&#39;t believe in that, but things like religion and sex are topics in which conservatives have a very different idea to liberals. Cuba is a conservative regime, gay marriage is not allowed and they are really catholic and conservative. Being conservative doesn&#39;t mean being from the right. I can believe in a free market and in the capitalist theory and still be very liberal.<br /><br />Socialism defends that the whole society (government) has some (or total) say in the matters of the economy. Capitalism defends that the market should be moved by the capital (money) and the free will of each individual and not be interfered by the government. That&#39;s what being in the right or the left means in most countries, the idea of the position of the government in the economy.<br /><br />The ideas regarding liberal and conservative ideas - abortion, religion, sex, drugs, prostitution, crime - have nothing to do with the economic theories (socialism and capitalism) behind the major political parties. In the US, people on the left tend to be liberal and on the right tend to be conservative. But that doesn&#39;t happen like that in every country.",Cristiano Costa,2020-06-15T22:53:33Z,1
"@Cristiano Costa So your definition of Conservatism is obviously different from mine. You&#39;re defining it as capitalism. Socialism is at it&#39;s core a left wing ideology. The only reason any leader attaches the word Conservative to a Socialist ideology is to appease the populace by convincing them that&#39;s it&#39;s not inherently invasive. It&#39;s just a word to make it sound less evil. While capitalism is certainly a better economic model, it&#39;s not strictly a conservative construct. But to put this argument to bed I&#39;ll say this: even if you consider Hitler conservative, that would put him as the only non-liberal psychopath/mass murdering leader in the history of the planet. Every single one from Nero, Caligula, Mao, Stalin, and dozens more were all left wing. That tells me something important.",notta cracka,2020-06-15T22:35:52Z,0
"@notta cracka Socialist is not opposite to a conservative. Liberal is opposite to conservative. Socialist is opposite to capitalism. You can be socialist and conservative (like Cuba) or liberal and capitalist (like Australia).<br /><br />Do you realise that socialism is not viewed by most of the world the same way it is in America. Many rightist parties in the world have the &quot;socialist&quot; in their names. In my country the main parties in both left and right have socialist in their names (Portugal). <br /><br />Socialism is an entire spectrum, and it is not what Bernie Sander defends, if is that what you&#39;re thinking about. Thats why the Nordic countries are often runned by right wing parties and are still socialist governments. Not socialists as USSR or Venezuela. The nazis had some socialist ideas but were obviously a right wing party, they defended mostly corporativism and capitalism. <br /><br />Lastly, if your so dumb and naive that the only way you can argument is by throwing false statements and then insulting, i can only say: It&#39;s hard to win an argument with a smart person, but it&#39;s damn near impossible to win an argument with a stupid person.",Cristiano Costa,2020-06-15T22:15:42Z,2

"I don&#39;t think schools should religious at all. Mainly because it should be the job of the parent to teach their child their religious values, if they don&#39;t have the time, then there are other methods for them to be taught that are often by institutions of your beliefs like churches, camps, bible study, etc. anything else is just an institution making its own inferences on a religion and putting it into your child without you being able to even know if you agree on them. I say this coming from a perspective of a kid who went to a religious private elementary school, home school middle school, and some public school in high school. The private school was a elitist and judgmental environment looking back on it where the teachers had too much free reign and excluded STEM from the program. More importantly- parents shouldn‚Äôt be able press their religion so much on their children. The number one thing that you can teach your kids is to question everything while instilling a general moral base because you simply can‚Äôt protect them from all the casual assumptions and interwoven agendas that their liberal college teachers are going to try to instill them except for knowing how to question things based on what they know, proper sources, and basic logic. Even my high school public teachers did this. And my elementary teachers did as well- even though I wasn‚Äôt young enough to realize it. Being able to pinpoint when a book is making an assumption or stating an opinion vs a fact is such an integral part for learning that just isn‚Äôt taught enough in my opinion. It‚Äôs how you individually find your own stances, instead of who is around you. If you can teach your child that- and then present them your religious beliefs not to your 3 year old toddler ‚Äúdo you want to go to heaven with mommy &amp; daddy? Ok! Accept Jesus into your heart!‚Äù Sure in that moment your kid is Christian- for then. And for a while once I got older I wasn‚Äôt until I was able to look back from what I learned and what I thought and make my own decision. Parents shouldn‚Äôt be able to disown their kid simply for not believing in the same things. The best they can do is to present in such a way in ‚Äúthis is why I beleive in this, and here is our values and the premise.‚Äù And continue taking them to church or whatever and educating them on it in hopes they‚Äôll make the choice themself to also believe.",Tiffany Miner,2020-06-08T06:44:27Z,0

"Personally, I think Ben injected a lot of his own assumptions about the intentions of some of the questions. In cases like the women first duty should be home makers question there is no evidence that the authors were injecting an assumption about what the &quot;right&quot; answer was.<br />This is a compass test, there are no right or wrong answers.<br />Ben also took issue with how close the chart put him on the authoritarian side, but seem to completely miss that his religious beliefs overrode in some cases what a more libertarian person would think.<br />Like questions about homosexuality, abortion, adoption, legality of porn. All of these are things that if you were a strong libertarian you&#39;d probably be for since you&#39;d think government has no place in regulating it.  Now those questions also play into the right vs left algorithm as well, but these are just a few examples where Ben picked less libertarian positions.<br /><br />Honestly, I think the test placed Ben pretty close to where he actually is in his political beliefs and he just didn&#39;t like the results.",Kyle Blagg,2020-06-04T13:36:45Z,2

"Rehabilitation is possible for someone that has gone through the legal systems. Trauma and continued trauma extends the inability for a person to be able to reenter society as a productive member. Punishment is not as effective as coupling it with healing of trauma and support to reenter society. There are no hopeless people, but there are people that need more support than others. If you are never taught something then how would you know the specific steps to do better. People that have fallen, no matter how far, that have been rehabilitated can share their experience to help others succeed.

"@kell&#39;s is sexy I think the &quot;muh roads&quot; argument is a fair one though. The less people are taxed, the more they have to pay for privately. Hence the point of a progressive taxation system is that the cost of living is balanced in disproportionate favour for poorer people. In my opinion, this is a better solution as if someone earns say a million dollars a year, the difference of paying 10% more in tax is noticible, but it doesn&#39;t break their standard of living in the same way a 10% tax increase for someone earning $20k a year will force them to chose if they want to eat 3 healthy meals a day, pay all their bills, or have a night off with their kids.<br /><br />So while it would be nice to decrease taxes for everyone, it has a directly negative impact on society which I&#39;d argue hurts the &quot;richer&quot; class more than a few % of tax. Things like roads, hospitals, public workers, and prisons that can reform petty criminals all benefit everyone. Not just those on lower tax rates, or government welfare. <br /><br />That&#39;s why I support a progressive taxation system, one which doesn&#39;t discourage the entrepreneurs wanting to make it big, but also doesn&#39;t leave behind the less fortunate.",Rasmus Blomberg,2020-07-11T14:08:42Z,1

I‚Äôve seen people in this comment section say that Ben is a hypocritical liar because he answers that people should question government. There is a fine line between questioning authority and disobedience towards it. There is also a difference between moral standards and religion. Just because someone has moral standards doesn‚Äôt make them religious. Now there is a trend because most religious people have moral standards. It has become too ridiculous the way people act now days with politics.

Most people will say that these countries have suffered because of socialism. Brazil elected a socialist leader and suffered so immensely that the leader was imprisoned for treachery. Socialism is not a good thing, but is always seems to work at first. Ben should be looked to for understanding of politics, same with many educated politicians, but every person should be held for the same standards.

We try to choose people who we think will have a better outcome with reason. Bernie Sander‚Äôs socialist movement don‚Äôt understand the actual outcome of socialism and the harm it can bring. Bernie is in it for the money because he profits from it and the people suffer. Gladly he dropped out, but the reasoning is what people need to listen for before the answer. Now, with libertarianism, Ben only said he was ‚Äòbasically‚Äô a libertarian. He sides closer to republican than libertarian, but he is a good mix of the two. I‚Äôm sure he believes that speeding laws should be enforced because it can hurt other people and yourself. The same can go with porn.

If you don‚Äôt want to be able to elect your own officials go to another country. Nobody completely agrees with someone on everything, and we can discuss if something is good or not, but you are saying that since he doesn‚Äôt agree with your opinion he is wrong.

That was all five teams combined.<br /><br />The conclusion of the study was that modest government support of art and cultural institutions is far more beneficial to a local economy than government-funded construction and government ownership of sports stadiums and arenas.",Kent Frederick,2020-05-11T15:06:48Z,0
"&quot;the only social responsibility of a company is to provide profit for its shareholders&quot;.<br /><br />You&#39;re confusing social responsibility with economic responsibility. Social responsibility is more of an ethical framework that benefits the society in which the company operates in.

However the point of prison should be to rehabilitate prisoners so recidivism rates are not so high.  The next question when he says he strongly agrees that it is a waste of time to try to rehabilitate some criminals, he states &quot;the recidivism rate is extremely high&quot; well duh, thats because you think punishment is more important than rehabilitation.

Cheating and sex partners are on fckin record numbers now. Sex has become a casual entertainment with no connection to the other person and everybody is just following their dck and pssy, like animals who cant think rationally. All is about pleasure, yolo, while people avoid responsibilities and building a good character and becoming better people. Hedonism is on all time record now and hedonism is very much damaging.

"@MisterSmith Perverted shit has always happened. Do you think people in the past didn&#39;t have crazy kinks and performed them? (although I&#39;d agree with you if you told me they were more uncommon)<br /><br />The internet has only allowed the people with these fetishes to share their work, but it didn&#39;t create them (though they might motivate others to try it, it still happened regardless). And this is precisely why we need &quot;openness about sex&quot;.<br /><br />Having no source of sex info is bad (as I&#39;d guess it was more common in ancient times), but having the internet as your main source is waaaay worse. Openness allows kids to non-explicitly understand what&#39;s normal/acceptable and what&#39;s not, through their family and teachers, which are a much better source of info than the uncensored internet, or their classmates/friends who can be just as ignorant.",Alberto Villanueva,2020-06-16T22:45:04Z,0

"You don&#39;t have to take SINFUL as evil. It can also mean not conducive to spiritual well-being.  Judaeo-Christian view on spiritual well-being involves fulfilling your biological duties, which is to have a family AND raise children, so not fulfilling that can be considered &quot;SINFUL&quot;.  You have to consider that biological urges are quite primitive and strong, so not  channeling them in their intended manner can have unforeseen consequences. The absurdly high amount of promiscuity and thus STI&#39;s in the gay community, as well as the very high amount of domestic abuse in lesbian relationships, are examples.

The quiz says &quot;it is important that my child&#39;s school instills religious values&quot;. Do you notice the difference? HIS child. As in, he wants to make sure, the school his child attends teaches these religious principles. Just in case you are unaware, there are different types of schools in the United States. There are private schools, which are allowed to teach religious values, and public schools run by the government which aren&#39;t allowed to. If someone wants to make sure their children aren&#39;t exposed to religion, they can simply send them to public school. Ben, however, wants his kid to attend a private school, which teaches them his religious and moral standards. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with that. <br /><br /><br />&quot;Uncivilized culture is the Taliban&quot;. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with this statement either. Literally just use Google. Under the Wikipedia article on Taliban, you can find a section called condemned practices. It lists, Massacre campaigns, Human trafficking, Oppression of Women, Violence against Civilians, etc. Sorry, but if that&#39;s not an uncivilized culture, I don&#39;t know what is.

And with porn, he made clear he loathes it, but understood there is a right for adults to make or watch that kind of adult entertainment and it&#39;s stupid to try to legally ban it even if he doesn&#39;t like it at all. His religious side tells him no, his rational side tells him yes.<br /><br />I&#39;m an atheist, raised by a Catholic family. My sisters are Catholic, my mom is Protestant, my dad died a Protestant (both converted from Catholicism to Protestantism after living 40 years as Catholics, not the point of the story). And parents should raise their kids as they see fit as long as it doesn&#39;t break the law. And teaching and preaching religion is not illegal. At the end of the day, if the kid has critical thinking skills, something parents should encourage in their kids, they will decide by themselves when they have the age to think about it (in my case, when I was 16 I broke with religion.

The Democrats are pulled heavily left with crazy environmentalism and socialist ideas while the right is fighting back as much as possible and trying to stop illegal immigration via Trump.  I should take the test to see if I have changed since then, I think I most likely moved 2 points to the right. (2,0).  IMO, libertarian-ism can be OK but not when it puts society in a moral crisis - drugs, gambling, prostitution, and abortion (infanticide) are all considered immoral according to the Bible but we allow it with libertarian-ism.  It&#39;s OK to &quot;sin&quot; as long as you don&#39;t hurt anyone is the motto which I cannot reconcile as a believer, effectively separating Biblical morality from policy.  A society that allows immorality to flourish for the sake of liberty is not destined to flourish but instead will not survive.",TNT Storms,2020-04-23T21:20:59Z,0

Okay I am going to say something that I am sure will get me attacked by your lackeys. The only problem I have with this video is your answer on religion being tought in schools and how you&#39;re in favor of it. Now I know these questions are poorly worded but what that question is pretty much asking is &quot;do you support the idea of public schools being forced to teach religion in their classes&quot; and you said &quot;strongly agree&quot; you can&#39;t call yourself a libertarian if you support the idea of forcing religion on to people. Now if this were a question about religious classes being optional for being in schools that would be fine but having it be a requirement? Not only can you not call yourself a libertarian for believing in that but you can&#39;t call yourself a constitutionalist either. We are not a Christian nation we are a nation of free religion and forcing religious beliefs on people not seeking it is a violation of the first amendment. Again if schools had optional classes on religion or a Bible to check out in a library that would be fine hell I would dare say it should be that way. But for required religious studies? I am honestly disappointed that you think that I was hoping for better from you.,KELLSONIC,2020-04-23T05:15:31Z,3

"@Garrett <br />Firstly, the death penalty actually costs more due to the extensive court process from the fact that a life is at stake. Second, who are you to decide whether innocent human life should be discarded for your benefit? I bet your opinion would greatly change if you were wrongly sentenced to death. Lastly, life in prison allows for correction if someone is wrongly sentenced to death, because they aren&#39;t dead when further evidence proving their innocence or uncertainty is found.",Stefan V.,2020-06-19T19:39:36Z,1

Let us call this religion Candyism<br /><br />Now, let&#39;s say I enroll my children in a private, Orthodox Candyist school that teaches and instills religious Candyist principles within students, specifically the commandment that says not to eat candy after 10pm. This school is a private school. It costs money. Parents CHOSE to come here by free will and are not forced, because they are the ones footing the bill.<br /><br />Now, if I was taking a Chocolate Bar Eating Time Compass test and one of the questions hypothetically asks <b>I want MY CHILD&#39;S SCHOOL (key word being MY) to instill religious values</b> , I would say yes because I have specifically enrolled my child in a private, Candyist school and I want that school to teach my kids about Candyism. I am not asking the government to intervene and force all schools in the United States to teach Candyism, only MY CHILD&#39;S school, which is EXACTLY what the test asked for and is the reason I chose to out my child in the Candyist school.<br /><br />The reason my child is at the private Candyist school and not at the local public school is because I CHOSE for him to be there. It was my will. I wanted that school to teach him Candyist values and thus I spend thousands of dollars in tuition to send him there, because I am the one who is teaching him those moral/religious values by making him go to that school.

The problem isn&#39;t really the number of immigrants. In fact, (If I understand correctly) we NEED immigrants because we don&#39;t make enough babies to support the socials politics in place in the near future. But the real problem is (according to my own comprehension) HOW do we manage immigration. How do we protect ourselves ?  How do we prepare these immigrants to live in our country, in our system ? How do we chose who can and who cannot immigrate in OUR home ? What they want is for me &quot;to know&quot; that i&#39;m a bad person because I dont want more immigrants.<br /><br /><br />And that is only one exemple of that &quot;Compass&quot; thing kind of questions...

"&quot;People are more divided by class than nationality, disagree, and WW1 proved that thats a bunch of nonsense.&quot;<br />Yeah, right, people didnt cause ceasefires on christmas of 1914 that the generals systematically stopped from happening the years after. The Soviet Union didnt come along because the poor rose up to overthrow the czar in 1917. Germanys downfall wasnt a revolution that was, in big part, socialist, brought on by the Kaiser ordering the High Seas Fleet out to sea for a final showdown with the Royal Navy. All those things didnt happen.<br />&quot;If you dont like bottled water, just get it from the tap.&quot;<br />Does this guy know what a water bill is?<br />Also, im pretty sure hes old enough to remember Lehman Brothers causing an economic crisis by trading with money they didnt actually own.<br />&quot;The rich are paying for pretty much everything in this country via taxation.&quot;<br />You wanna know why? Because someone who makes minimum wage simply doesnt have as much money left over at the end of the month as someone who owns their own company. And im not just talking Google and Microsoft here. If youre earning a lot, you can afford to spend less of the money you earn. Therefore, a higher tax rate doesnt hurt a rich person as much as a poor person.<br />&quot;The money goes back into the medical system, it goes into the developments of new medicine&quot;<br />Yeah, in an ideal world it does. However, in the US, the price of medical care is ridiculous. And before anyone tells me to buy a cheaper sofa if i cant afford the one i want, thats not how medicine works. Disease is not a free market. The medical sector has a fixed demand. As a result, you can put the price for, say, insulin, as high as you want, and people will still need to buy it, or else risk dying of diabetis, which is incurable as it stands, but perfectly treatable. In germany, if my memory serves me correctly, one dose of Insulin costs 77‚Ç¨. In the US, the price is more along the lines of 17000‚Ç¨ for the same amount, and Germany is on the high end for european standards. But of course, if you hold the opinion that the only responsibility a company has is to make money, like Ben Shapiro admits himself in this very video, he thinks it is, then you dont see a problem in people dying of a disease that people can just develop in life and that cant be cured, but is perfectly treatable, because a company decided to gauge prices. Afterall, theyre making money, and thats the only thing a company should be obliged to do, right?<br />I dont think that the question about classroom attendance referred to homeschooling specifically. I think it may also refer to things like the finnish system, wherein, you are obliged to learn the material the curriculum sets out, and every quarter year, theres a test you need to attend to prove you learned it, however, if you decided to learn everything by googling the topic and learning the according Wikipedia article by heart rather than attend school, that would be perfectly acceptable in there system. However, in the context of Ben Shapiro living in the US and being on the end of the spectrum that he is, it makes sense that his first instinct would be homeschooling, specifically.<br />&quot;I understand that these questions are vague so they can label you racist for being conservative&quot;<br />No. A lot of these questions are vague, but that is mainly so the quiz doesnt have several hundred questions.<br />Also, noone is saying that this quiz is conflating natural and moral. And besides, i dont think there is a single person in the world who thinks that natural and moral are the same thing. Rape is natural. So is killing. And yet, i cant think of any culture who considers these to be moral (Though, killing is more vague here because all cultures i know agree that there are circumstances under which killing someone is morally acceptable, which is why some nations still have the death penalty, why things like self defense laws exist, etc.)<br />Publically funded broadcasting is a good thing, if you ask me. For example, germany has a rather well built network of publically funded tv and radio stations, and although theyre not always completely unbiased, theyre a reliable source of good information, and the public discourse, as a result of being dictated by those publically funded channels, is nowhere near the shitshow that US news is.<br />While i agree that one party states are garbage, i still disagree that its not an advantage of one party states to be able to avoid all the discourse that naturally comes along with democracy and are thus much more capable at quick decision making.<br />Punishment and rehabilitation should both be priorities in prisons. Also, prisons should, in my opinion, be the last resort for punishments. For example, why do we need to lock up thieves? Requiring the person in question to wear an electronic shackle, as some nations have shown in practice, notably the scandinavian nations, work too. Locking people up is also very, very expensive. It requires a supply of food, water, clothes, beds, etc. All the usual things that are needed for a person to live a somewhat decent life. And some of those things, as a result, also require electricity, like for cooking or keeping the pumps going. And of course, prisons, just like any building, really, need to be mainained, which is expensive. Now add the pay for all the staff, and youll begin to see why prisons can be a drain on a nations budget. I agree though, some criminals simply cant be rehabilitated.<br />Making peace with the establishment? Yes. Agreeing with the entire establishment? No.<br />Yes, the age old question of religion and morality. For those who think that people cannot be moral without religion, heres a question: Who is more moral? The person who does not kill, steal, etc, because they recognize doing so is bad for society as a whole, or the person who openly states that, were it not for a higher being holding a figurative gun to their head, they would go around breaking every law imaginable? (And yes, i have encountered people who openly state this)",HolyPastrami,2020-04-15T12:04:45Z,1

I could point to 5 or 6 questions that Ben didn&#39;t answer the way that his views suggest and if he were honestly with his answers he would absolutely be pretty solidly in the authoritarian right.  I guarantee that Ben took the test as many times as he needed to make sure he ends up on the libertarian side  as oppose to the authoritarian side.  Every question that he waffled back and forth between two answers he ended up taking the more libertarian position and I think you could argue that on some his answer was more than 1 spot away from what he actually believes.

Obviously spanking should be not done without some beneficial purpose, but I can try and assume the purpose would be to correct bad behavior. Parents, by nature, would want to do the very least they have to provide corrective discipline. Sometimes, spanking is what it takes to correct behavior, when other things have failed. Not to mention that kids, by nature, push and test authority, which harks back to our proclivity to question authority.<br /><br /><br />I have a hard time suspending disbelief that your own children do not undermine your authority as a father in some way. Shoot, I see it all the time in my local roads and highways with the grown adults we have now. A free society that can be so stupidly errant as to invite and encourage more authoritarian measures is a society that would bring my pee to a boil.

I think it&#39;s pretty haughty of you to assume there is such a thing as an objective classification scale on which one such as you would be able to pinpoint Shapiro, or any other human being for that matter. What does &quot;intellectual&quot; even mean in this context? Are we going by dictionary definitions? <br /><b>Intellectual : Noun : a person possessing a highly developed intellect.</b> Okay that&#39;s not exactly helpful, rather circular, so let&#39;s look at the root word.<br /><b>Intellect : Noun : the faculty of reasoning and understanding objectively, especially with regard to abstract or academic matters.</b> Mhhh, getting there I guess. Although some people whom many consider intellectuals would argue there is no such thing as objective understanding, and there&#39;s also a propensity among intellectuals to get so far up their own asses in matters of the abstract or academic as to become utterly useless to society in general, just wasting their vast potential for critical thinking on some insignificant charade of mathematical conundrum not a damn soul but themselves will ever care about.<br />But if we are to take the definition at face value and assume the requirement of an intellectual is that they must be able to understand reality and abstract principles on an objective basis, then I would argue Shapiro, who is well-versed in matters of economics, religion and politics, just to name a few fields of expertise he&#39;s spoken, written and read extensively about, fits the bill better than the average joe, be they left or right, and thus in relation to them, could be considered an intellectual, for whatever such a label is worth these days, which ain&#39;t much, because it&#39;s typically reserved for cynical, politically motivated character attacks and endorsements.<br /><br /><br />TL;DR : Shapiro is a smart cookie regardless of his political leanings on intentions, and to deny him this credit is about as absurd as to claim a woman can become a man by surgically attaching a penis to their crotch and injecting themselves full of hormones.

"This is scale is unbalanced imho. I ended up as being very moderated and being only very slightly on the right for economic ideals and barely on the authoritarian side. I&#39;m definetely way more economic libertatian and a bit more authoritarian than what this test has shown me.<br />It is possible that this test results were calibrated to make people around the middle end up in the colletivist/liberal left just so they get surprised and tell themselves like &#39;Wow! I&#39;m a leftist and I didn&#39;t knew it! Interesting...&quot; and then they will identify as leftists and start to hear their ideas more.<br />The only way a true right-winger will end up far in the right-side or up-side in the graphic is that if they&#39;re truly extremists and even stupid enough to believe to &quot;strongly agree&quot; or &quot;strongly disagree&quot; on questions that defies pure common sense.<br />So yeha, a lot of questions are phrased in a way that make right-wingers appear very moderate (on the left-right scale) if they don&#39;t go into the extreme choices. Definetely a biased test.",Ricardo Lembo,2020-04-08T22:29:29Z,1
"I suppose the axes should be clarified a bit more.<br /><br />The horizontal axis is the Socialist-Capitalist axis.  It concerns views on the market.  State ownership of production is on the left end, and pure laissez-faire capitalism at the other, with varying degrees of socialism and capitalism in between.  People generally know where they place on this axis.<br /><br />The other axis is the Authoritarian-Libertarian axis.  It only concerns state-enforced morality.  The top is totalitarian, 1984-style dictatorship, and the bottom is pure, lawless anarchy, with varying degrees of law enforcement in between.  Where you place here is generally harder to predict.<br /><br />It should be noted that this quiz is designed so that the average taker places around the center and no part of the map is empty.  The horizontal axis is composed almost entirely of capitalism, socialism, as both are of roughly equal popularity at the moment.  The vertical scale, however, isn&#39;t so neatly labelled.  What determines your placement in this is stances on laws for things like pornography, abortion, drug use, guns, sexuality, and other moral issues and methods of law enforcement such as breaking up protests, surveillance, the death penalty, etc.  Basically, the more laws stating &quot;_<i>_</i> is illegal&quot; and the more harshly breaking the law is punished, the higher up on the vertical axis you fall.<br /><br />Americans tend to fall on the line from anarcho-communism to dictatorial capitalism, but there is a lot of variance.  I believe Ben should have placed higher up on the authoritarian scale.  Unfortunately, the Political Compass doesn&#39;t take into account views on how people advocate for their ideas as it is independent of political ideology.  He likely was thinking of this when he thought of himself as a libertarian as all he does to advocate for his ideas is to discuss them, whereas other may do public protests, run non-profit organizations, set up PACs, discourage views they hold as evil from being presented, breaking the law, and even violence.  In terms of how Ben is advocating his views, they&#39;re much weaker than most Americans would think necessary, more akin to just distraction so little gets done, but what he&#39;s advocating for, it&#39;s actually pretty brutal.",PhigNewton1,2020-04-08T21:30:58Z,0

"I wanted to know if Ben Shapiro or the fans think that the coronavirus is a result of capitalism; and, let me elaborate on my extremely triggering premise. I am going to copy and paste an email I sent to Fox News where i am trying to show that the coronavirus has been linked to eating meat; and then, after you guys read my comment, I will elaborate and connect the message I sent to Fox News with capitalism. &quot;Hey! My name is (left this part out on YOUTUBE) and, I am eighteen years old; and, I have some questions about what is going in the world and, I also just want to give you my perspective so that maybe you guys or some other news sources can put this news to the public to hopefully change this world for the better. Because to be quite honest, I am tired of watching the world be confused and, I am tired of being confused as well. <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886704"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27886704</a>. This is the position of the academy of nutrition and dietetics and, I believe it is very important because if you ask yourself, &quot; If a healthy planned vegan and vegetarian diet is healthy and, if animal agriculture is very bad in sustainability and other things, maybe animal agriculture should not be practiced anymore which would alleviate our world&#39;s problems.&quot; There are also tons of other science regarding the environmental destruction that raising animals causes but, I have only provided this link because it is a strong source. <a href=""http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTWAT/Resources/4602122-1213366294492/5106220-1213649450319/1.9.2_Livestocks_Long_Shadow.pdf"">siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTWAT/Resources/4602122-1213366294492/5106220-1213649450319/1.9.2_Livestocks_Long_Shadow.pdf</a> <a href=""http://templatelab.com/livestock-and-climate-change/"">templatelab.com/livestock-and-climate-change/</a><br />My claim is that, if we were eating a heavy plant based diet, the world would be a better place in so many aspects.  This is the problem and, let me explicitly say that this is what I want you to take from what I am saying in this message. We do not need to eat animals to be healthy, and animal agriculture is causing the majority of global warming and environmental destruction, virus epidemics, and health problems. And, if eating animals for the majority of people is needless and, it is so environmentally damaging, then why is it okay to needlessly murder innocent sentient beings. Animals are conscious creatures. And, if it is unnecessary to eat conscious creatures, then why are we doing it? I am tired of being nervous talking about this. I understand that it is confusing for people because of cultural traditions and science reporting in the opposite direction of what I am saying. But, I am providing evidence for some serious concern. We should not be always focused on who is right, leftists or conservatives, vegans or meat eaters, Americans or Chinese people, we should be more focused on fixing problems. Who cares if I am a vegan? Just understand that this problem is more than who is right and who is wrong, because if what I am saying is true, the consequences of blowing this off are extreme. I genuinely want a better world. I hate to watch our world die and people die and be confused as to why our world has so many problems and, I think a big issue is animal agriculture. If I did not provide convincing enough evidence, that is fine. because the evidence I provided is enough to warrant an investigation of the science regarding my claims; but, I also would like to talk to one of you guys about this so that it could be made clear what exactly my position is; and, also so that you guys know that I am not a vegan douchebag. I am not a vegan trying to say &quot; Ha! I asserted my points and, I won the argument!&quot; No, I simply want you guys to understand my perspective so that we genuinely and honestly, with the health of the public and the world in mind, reach a consensus about the right actions to take to understand my position in depth further with more evidence and the position of so many others. Please, research in depth what I am saying, because if it is true, like I said, we could solve a lot of problems. What vegan activists are saying, what scientists, and experts are saying about the degradation of the environment because of animal agriculture has enough evidence to warrant investigation by media sources and politicians to look into this problem in my opinion. For example, the coronavirus pandemic or epidemic could have had a lot less percent chance of occurring if we ate vegan or heavily plant based. Confining animals into close quarters, farmng, meat markets, slaughterhouses, breeding animals, and animal to hhuman contact is all greatly increased by animal agriculture. I do not know if you heard about Earthling Ed&#39;s comment on the matter, but he did not want was media to say that the coronavirus was started by the act of eating meat itself. By saying that the virus was caused by eating meat itself is absolutely wrong. But, the reason why animal agriculture exists is because we eat meat. If we did not eat meat, we would not practice animal agriculture; and, animal agriculture as I have explained causes these factors that make virus epidemics or pandemics start. If you guys have any questions regarding what I am trying to say so that we can both get the best out of the information I am trying to convey, please let me know. Because even though I am human as well, and it is fun to think about who is right and who is wrong in the argument we have to remember that it is thinking about the problem itself, and not all the other insignificant societal pressures about our identified groups being right or being wrong. I also am aware that the way I am writing this message sounds like I am pretending as if I am someone of importance and, I am acting like you will respond; but, I am aware that I am a nobody that has no credentials; however, think about the message and not the messenger necessarily in this case. I want to help the world. Thank you&quot; Now you might be thinking that this is not enough evidence for my claims about animal agriculture being the biggest environmental problem in the world. There are consensus statements by the FAO, reports by the UN; the CDC said antibiotic resistance is the biggest threat to humanity and antibiotic resistance is mainly caused by animal farming. World watch institute did a study saying that the green house gas emissions caused by livestock is 51% percent of all green house gasses. There is tons of studies. Also, it is interesting to point out that livestock animals were not created like it says in the bible; they are a result of breeding by humans and are unnatural animals in that sense. So, the claim that we have dominion in this way over animals seems to be false because we bred them to be this way; they are not a natural animal specifically made by a god ready to be used by humans. Livestock animals were made by humans not god. And, you can know this by studying genetics and realizing that they have ancestors. Phylogenetics is the word that describes this process of tracing back an animal&#39;s ancestral lineage. If anyone wants to talk to me please comment and, I can explain everything. To be quite hones,t I am very lazy to write how this all relates to capitalism. Capitalism is good in so many ways and is the best economic system we have today. But, Capitalism and a lot of other economic systems view animals as simply a means to an end. A food source but a food source with a money symbol built into them. Animals are sentient. They have brains and nervous systems unlike plants. Plants do not have structures to feel pain. And, any botanist will say that plants do not have structures that are meant for pain reception. They do not display behavior in the way animals do. It is simple physiology. And if the biggest group in the world of nutritionists are saying that a vegan diet reduces risk of so many diseases linked to animal products then why are we still consuming them? It is because we have been mislead as humans to believe that their bodies are necessary to consume when they are most likely not. And the coronavirus is just an example of the many pandemics caused and originated at livestock farms or meat markets and, these unnatural centers are all a result of viewing animals as simply a means to an end. How perverted and twisted it is to view us humans as more significant than all the other creatures that live on earth. How sickening is it to be proud of such a world where almost all of its inhabitants are views simply as objects of sustenance or objects of no use value. And look, I could be wrong. But, the goal should be to find out the truth. There is a lot of truth i believe in what I am saying and, it is very difficult to create a proper construction to explain the whole situation in a YouTube comment on my shitty laptop.",Turtle Gaming,2020-04-05T01:18:42Z,1

"@BenZe  It can be believed to be be problematic outside of a moral sense because it detaches one of the consequences of sex. People are increasingly more comfortable with it despite the dangers and abortion will contribute to that false sense of safety. So sexual diseases can be a bigger threat from that angle and there&#39;s a possibility different fetishes will be more accepted because people are more frequently and freely able to have sex just for pleasure. These aren&#39;t exact words from anyone, but many think including Shapiro about it in a similar way. To put it plainly they believe that people need to have the consequence of a baby somewhat tied to sex for the well being of society. That&#39;s why it isn&#39;t only an ethical stance to oppose abortion. So one could have this stance and be a libertarian even if libertarians can&#39;t consider ethics (even though they can.)",Joshua M,2020-06-12T08:05:48Z,0
"@Joshua M how could abortion be problematic outside of a moral sense? Because a fetus cannot feel pain in the first 20 weeks and is not considered a human being, I think that it ties in the libertarian belief pretty well. In other words, giving you as much freedom as possible but not taking away or intruding in the rights of others. Ofc the only question here is if we already consider the fetus as a human. That decision heavily ties is with moral beliefs.",BenZe,2020-06-10T07:43:46Z,0

"@BenZe You cannot justify everything by morals. Perhaps you are exaggerated or just are not meaning what you are saying, but plenty of things like serial killing innocents for pleasure cannot be justified by morals. Maybe you meant every law can be justified by morals if so I still don&#39;t think that&#39;s entirely true, but that&#39;s a reasonable claim. I wouldn&#39;t say laws to restrict monopolies are moral it&#39;s more just self preservation of the nation much like budget and money printing laws that restrict congress. However your point is valid especially if someone uses the word moral pretty loosely. Anyway the example in Germany still makes rape being illegal about morals perhaps even more so because it is about this right that isn&#39;t required for survival yet is respected. It is definitely in part or mainly a moral law. Also part of my point was that a lot of political sides agree with this being entirely illegal meaning even libertarians want laws that have some ties to morals. Even then I&#39;m pretty sure Ben and many other&#39;s see porn as more than just a moral issue. It&#39;s very likely to a lesser degree, but even abortion could be problematic outside of a moral sense.",Joshua M,2020-06-10T01:53:02Z,0

"‚Äã@N. Z. Saltz A reactionary is someone who uncompromisingly defends the institutions of peace, security and order in society. Historically these have been monarchy, aristocracy, nation, church and family. Neoreactionaries seek to defend these values with upgraded weaponry in the form of more robust conceptions of the property norm and meritocratic government. We favor, for instance, government run as a joint-stock corporation rather than as a family business as under the royalist model of classical reaction. To maximize competition between governments we also favor mass geopolitical decentralization. For me, neoreaction (NRX) is the apotheosis of libertarianism: a free market in everything, including government itself. For more on NRX I recommend reading <a href=""http://unqualified-reservations.org/"">unqualified-reservations.org</a>, the archived blog of the philosophy&#39;s foundational thinker, Mencius Moldbug (pen name of Curtis Yarvin, who now writes under his real name at americanmind.org)",N of 1,2020-04-09T02:10:43Z,0

"@C F Not to mention that politics, especially the range of everyday non - institutionalized political activity and thought, are more often than not oriented by one&#39;s feelings on (x) matters rather than scrupulous analysis of specific policies. And even then we should assume such policies have certain leanings on topics pertainig to culture, society, economics, etc. What&#39;s hilarious about most proponents of this &quot;rationalism&quot; (which is better defined as a kind of surrogate for objectivism) as a political motto is that they fail to understand that politicians are wholly aware of such phenomenon (otherwise they probably wouldn&#39;t be effective politicians in the first place). <br /><br />Of course that is beside the fact that, as you have pointed out, it is impossible for someone to generate knowledge exclusively through reason. And why should we? Feelings are foundational to how we interact with others as well as our environment, thus equally necessary to generate knowledge. Furthermore &quot;rationality&quot; itself is defined by historical, cultural, and societal values which inform what we understand as &quot;rational&quot; and &quot;irrational&quot;. I guess that pretty much negates the idea of &quot;rational truth&quot; as an objective and unitary (or even achievable) value but Hey! This is politics we&#39;re talking about, not theism!

"When I took this test in high school, I scored left corner above Ghandi. I don&#39;t remember all of my answers back then, but I am surprised by how much I agree with Shapiro. I still don&#39;t consider myself conservative because most of my values are still Liberal but I am not staunch anything which is good in my opinion. <br /><br />Wanna know something funny? I been banned from liberal oriented subs on Reddit faster than conservative subs and the conservative subs are actually more tolerant of me commenting my (Civil)  objections to certain details of their rhetoric. Makes me have a renowned respect for Conservatives even though I still don&#39;t agree with them. I respect them for their civility in political discussion.<br /><br />Before anyone asks why am I &quot;stupid&quot; for still sharing views of the people that are often immature, just because a good idea comes from dumb people doesn&#39;t mean they should be ignored. Good ideas can objectively be good ideas regardless of who or where they came from. In my personal opinion, I find the MAJORITY of things Liberal, to be good in terms of Unity and the appeal to Progressivism as a result.  Wanna know what I don&#39;t agree with and that got me banned? Two things. My opposition to gun control and my reluctance to adhere to &quot;sensitive talk&quot; about gender issues. I still support gender equality overall and do acknowledge that it is MOSTLY a woman&#39;s right to abort. I don&#39;t support prayer in public school because to me that&#39;s what private schools.are for. I support Universal Healthcare or even Single Payer Healthcare and guess what, I don&#39;t care if an illegal immigrant uses our Healthcare because to me it is a human right to live and to not impede medical staff from fulfilling their oath. I like the idea of at least something being done about Student Debt, not necessarily just canceling it but maybe a 2 year Civil Service program that isn&#39;t the fricken military. This is not even &quot;cheating&quot; the miltary. They still get housing and cars with the G.I. package. That is indisputably a counterweight to just getting your student loans cleared. Anyways, I agree with so much about Liberal ideas but I WILL NOT get behind nonsensical gun control. It makes no fricken sense to impulsively ban any specific type of guns because there is no proof that doing so will reduce mass shootings. Also the N.R.A. missed a perfect opportunity to get behind the  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23metoo"">#metoo</a> movement by offering free concealed carry classes to women, in my opinion.

"@bunderbah Well, 1. They 100% control their corporation, and when you&#39;re a national or multinational corporation that&#39;s a lot of people you control. Some might say &quot;then dont work for that company&quot; but half the time that isn&#39;t an option. 2. They can lobby against worker&#39;s rights and common sense regulations, as well as any policy that would benefit the stock of the company. 3. They can break laws and get away with it. This can be done through forced arbitration, or abusing &quot;Right to Work&quot; laws. Also large companies typically have an excellent legal team, and so any worker that wants to sue them for a breaking of a law either is deterred by their legal team or beaten by them. This effectively circumvents the legal process, just by having more money. 4. Corporations can continue to break federal laws by paying off fines. The most famous example being Nestle stealing from protected water sources by paying the fine. They are able to do this because the money they make from stealing outweighs the fine money. 5. Large corporations flush out smaller businesses because they have more money. They can either pay their workers less, set up insider deals, or the easiest solution: selling product at a loss. They are able to take a hit to their profit for a longer time, while the small business will have to close down. 6. Pharmaceutical companies and medication companies can work together to control what consumers buy. Most Americans can only afford medication with insurance, so the pharmaceutical company will pay the insurance company to only cover their medicine, forcing the consumer to buy that medicine. 7. In totally &quot;free&quot; markets, corporations are very much given free reign. You can see this in the abuse of the Banana Republics as well as sweat shops in the third world.<br /><br />There are a lot more example, but I hope this is enough. You&#39;re right, corporations don&#39;t (usually) have the power a state would, but they do have a great deal of power over the populace, and will only fight for more in the name of profit.",Evelyn Phipps,2020-04-01T02:46:33Z,1

Obviously that wasn&#39;t true either! <br /><br />China is called the &quot;People&#39;s Republic of.

He too claimed to support democratic socialism, but once again......<br /><br />Then there&#39;s Venezuela and Hugo Chavez, who also pushed the democratic socialism line! <br /><br />In reality, there has never been a fully implemented socialist govt that was TRULY democratic. You know how ridiculous and scary it sounds when someone mentions a potential Nazi insurgency? Well that&#39;s exactly the SAME way you SHOULD feel when someone tries to promote socialism, or ANY Marxist ideology!<br /><br /> There&#39;s one guy who never lived or suffered under socialism.

"@Alex Nielson ¬†porn of non-consenting adults or non-adults is illegal my dude. And while I admit it isn&#39;t regulated at all, the INTENT of porn is not for 11 year olds to view anymore than an 11 year old might steal from their parents liquor cabinet (only sexuality is a natural urge, alcoholism is a dependency). People do learn a lot from porn, but if you believe serial killing is the RESULT of pornography, you have an entire history of murders prior to porn&#39;s ubiquitousness to disprove that. Porn is the manifestation of desires that people already have, its hardly the other way around. Many many people are into being choked who dont watch any porn at all. Truly the fastest way to much sure people do kinkier and kinkier shit is to make it against the rules. Thats like, the whole premise of taboo.<br /><br />The whole japan porn thing is the byproduct of hyperconservatism towards sex. You know that whole pixelation thing? That&#39;s because showing genitals used to be ILLEGAL. Low and behold, you sexually repress a society for generations, theyre gonna start mixing weird shit into porn. Because in that frame, even if one is more extreme, missionary man on woman and tentacle choking are both against the rules. And that companionship thing is an extreme, niche case that is neither common nor exclusive to japan. Porn might be used to enable loneliness and separation, but it is usually not the cause itself. Same way with drowning your sorrows in alcohol, its a bad way of dealing with the situation, but it is not the cause, and banning it will not prevent that situation. Look at how effective prohibition was. Did alcohol consumption on average go down? Sure, somewhat. The new most popular drink? It went from beer to whiskey. Banning things makes people go for the stronger stuff.<br /><br />I&#39;m genuinely concerned that you think autoerotic asphyxiation is the name thing as strangling. They are not. They are physically different actions and for different purposes. Strangling someone is a violent action where you intend to do harm. Sexual choking involves pressing on specific parts of the neck that partially restricts bloodflow as this produces a euphoric effect. Sexual choking is to strangling as cracking your neck is to snapping your neck. This whole &quot;stranglers are the result of watching light choking&quot; thing is a myth, I don&#39;t know where you&#39;ve heard that. Anecdotally, the kinkiest people I&#39;ve met (and had firsthand experience with) were not regular porn consumers. Many of them had never consumed porn or did so in very limited qualities because their values frowned upon it. When religion and politics supress sexuality, people do some KINKY shit. Like weird weird shit. A litany of studies back this up",Lief Deltora,2020-04-01T01:18:41Z,0
@Lief Deltora Not quite sure what you&#39;re asking.,Patrick Murphy,2020-04-01T00:29:06Z,0
"@Lief Deltora Okay, STDs make sense, gotcha. Of course what you do in porn can be replicated in prostitution, but porn is near ubiquitous while prostitution is not. Of course using someone as an object is more objectifying, but porn is teaching the population to view (and use) people as objects from very young ages. The average age of exposure is 11, not even a teenager. <br /><br /><br />Also, even if it&#39;s not most porn, a lot of porn is not between consenting adults. Beyond that, even porn that is between consenting adults often depicts and glorifies lack of consent. If it were understood that this was roleplay it wouldn&#39;t be as bad, but porn is often considered sex ed and is imitated by people watching it (like with killing people trying to copy porn&#39;s strangling thing). <br /><br /><br />And yes, of course porn is only a part of Japan&#39;s problem, but I think if it&#39;s enough of a problem that there is a market simply for female companionship (no sex, just hanging out) in their prostitution system, something is wrong.<br /><br /><br />Finally, while books can do similar things, vision triggers different chemicals in the brain. It&#39;s different reading smut and actually watching it happen, it just does different things to your head. Also, books don&#39;t actually involve anyone in real life, so at most they can teach bad things, but aren&#39;t made from bad things.",Alex Nielson,2020-03-31T15:20:44Z,0

I hate to be that guy I&#39;m sorry but I think punishment and rehabilitation goes together. You punish the criminal but teach him other skills to prevent or lower the chances of going back to jail and cost tax payers millions. For instance if your only way is to make money is to sell drugs and you get caught and you get back out your likely to go back at it because that was your only way instead of a real job or trade which will lower that chance of selling dope. So rehabilitation is somewhat important,Tregaming,2020-03-29T17:25:20Z,0

"I think Hillary Clinton is more left-leaning now a days. As for porn being legal.  The industry is about exploitation and demeans the sexual act as mere entertainment.  It can ruin lives.  Some outliers have said porn led them to a life as  serial killer.  Too many bad properties of creating porn do not outweigh the &quot;inherent freedoms&quot; of publishing it. The mere existence of porn makes it available to kids,  which infringes on their rights to be taught the right and wrongs in society. The exploitative properties give options to many who would not do it had there been no advantage to do it. Same goes with prostitutes,  and it is illegal. Morally speaking it is wrong in many eyes, and the problems it causes do not outweigh the infringements of rights it causes (and it in itself infringes on others&#39; rights too).",Scott Nelson,2020-03-29T16:49:26Z,0

Could the US have defeated ISIS without  the Kurds? No, just look at Afghanistan. Do I want the troops to stay? No, however, to anyone with knowledge about geopolitics a Turkish invasion of Kurdistan was to be expected by abruptly pulling troops out. Turkey didn‚Äôt invade for fear of an international crisis with the US. The US should have arranged for peacekeepers to be sent to. I am staunchly anti interventionist, but in removing troops troops from the Middle East there will inevitably be negative repercussions. When possible we should try to limit them so that our soldiers as well as theirs don‚Äôt die in vein. I would also think that you should give your allies some insight with regards to your plan. The Kurds had no idea that the troops were withdrawing until they did. As a result, the Kurds were forced to side with the Syrian government (an enemy of the US) to defend their homeland against Turkey.  Furthermore, abruptly abandoning your ally does not bode well. Other countries or groups will be less likely to work with the US because they don‚Äôt know if the US can be trusted. Sorry for the long read",Alex Jour,2020-04-25T21:38:40Z,0

"THREE MAJOR FLAWS IN BEN&quot;S THOUGHT PROCESS<br />1; The Taliban ~<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB2drJIWI7Y&amp;t=9m15s"">9:15</a><br />The Taliban was trained by the CIA to build a Islamic block to the USSR. In other words, the US was the culture taking hold in the Taliban which you cite as &quot;uncivilized&quot;. However I doubt you would say the US is uncivilized.<br />2;Protectionism<br />Protectionism can protect domestic industry which is at times essential for the US. Late 18th century America saw a flood of British goods. Protectionism would limit that and protect domestic industry.<br />3: Trusts<br />The lack of government intervention or laissez faire is actually the cause of huge monopolies. As seen in the &#39;Gilded Age&#39; many industrial titans ie Rockefeller came to power purely because the market allowed him too. You say the contrary, that naturally monopolies do not exist.<br /><br />Just btw, I place somewhere between center-right and center-authoritarian, without the test (just guessing).",Elliot Norsworthy,2020-03-28T07:19:29Z,0

"Hi! Thanks for the video, I have found it very interesting.<br /><br />I would like to remark the fact that Hitler and Thatcher are properly represented in the map of political ideologies. It&#39;s just they are not close, the distances between the ideologies are greater than you think. As an example, here in england all the major political parties (Conservatives, Labourists and Liberal Democrats), when represented on the map, they barely differ from each other. This is because the map represents ALL THE POSSIBLE political and economical ideologies, which go WAY FURTHER than the options we currently vote for in our western economies.<br /><br />When I explain this to people, I normally use the same example for the vertical positioning (which represents how much you think a government should dictate the actions of the individuals, a question you have answered in the video): do you think the government should punish victimless crimes (a crime in which there are no victims or the only victim is yourself, like smoking marijuana or shooting heroin)? The answer to that question separates the top part from the bottom one. I give this example to make people understand how big the distances are in that map. Pure fascism is probably only the 10% of the superior area (bottom 10% is like pure anarchism, no government control over citizens AT ALL).<br /><br /><br />So yes, Thatcher is closer to Hitler than to pure anarchism, for obvious reasons.<br /><br />Cheers!",Santiago Carracedo,2020-03-28T03:20:09Z,1

"That&#39;s not the point he&#39;s making. To explain with an example:<br />Let&#39;s say there was a question &quot;Should it be legal to use the N word?&quot;.<br />If you answer &quot;strongly agree&quot;, the test would put you far to the right, because leftist wouldn&#39;t say strongly agree to that question. But you could just use common sense and think &quot;Yes, using words should be legal, because throwing people in jail for using a word is silly&quot;.<br />Now let&#39;s say they asked instead &quot;Should people be arrested and jailed for using a word?&quot; suddenly a lot of leftist would disagree with that. <br />But these questions are asking the same thing, pretty much...But on the first question, there would be a large divide Right/Left, while on the second question it would be much closer, with pretty much everyone saying no, they shouldn&#39;t be jailed.<br /><br />So, to come back with Ben&#39;s point: If the test wanted to be &quot;fair&quot; they would go with the 2nd question. But if they wanted to separate RIght/Left on the basis of &quot;You&#39;re racist so you&#39;re right wing&quot;, then they ask the first question, because Right wingers will answer both questions the same way, while Left wingers will say &quot;No, it should be illegal&quot; to the first question, but on the second they will say that &quot;no, they shouldn&#39;t be arrested&quot; (which is literally the opposite of something being illegal)",newp gaston,2020-03-30T10:18:10Z,9

I freakin&#39; love your logic and your sharp tongue, hands down the most brilliant political mind I&#39;ve seen since Otto von Bismarck, with Churchill MAYBE throwing his bowler in the running, but I don&#39;t believe you were ever a true Libertarian. In my humble (and quite possibly wrong) opinion, a libertarian is someone who allows others to make their own decisions. Even if they&#39;re wrong according to our own upbringing.  You live by your own moral code, anti-abortion, anti-porn, pro-religion, pro-government involvement in the &quot;free-market&quot;, it really doesn&#39;t matter. We all have our opinions. What matters is that we all live according to our own code and avoid imposing our &quot;Righteousness&quot; on others. And we expect the same in return. Don&#39;t want to do drugs? Great. Saying that no one can? Not great. I feel that abortion is murder, but fortunately I don&#39;t have to push a screaming, selfish creature out of my most sensitive parts so I, being reasonable, would never enforce that law on anyone else.

Hitler was a authoritarian ruler that was Generally Ambivalent to the freedom of the Market, as long as it powered his war machine.

"So does Ben Shapiro not understand political tests? To preface, I don‚Äôt agree with this specific political test and have my own qualms because of its heavy generalizations omitting certain variables that are important to your political stance. I would recommend 8-values instead as it displays a much more precise representation of your political opinions. I just think Ben Shapiro has nonsensical reasons making an irrational distaste for this test.<br /><br />He complains that these tests are asking these questions which force an elicit response. Let‚Äôs take ‚Äúit is regrettable that many personal fortunes are made by people who simply manipulate money and contribute nothing to their society.‚Äù This is one of the many radical searching questions made to compel a specific group of people to answer a certain way. It‚Äôs trying to identify if you are part of this group. This is how it tests how radical or centering you are. <br /><br />‚ÄúAn eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth‚Äù are you kidding me? How petty is that. Go ahead and correct people when they talk about the origins of a phrase, go ahead, but phrases change and general population use this differently. That is the basic evolution of language. I‚Äôm not shit myself and claim people are incorrectly using ‚Äúrule of thumb‚Äù and automatically assume that people are referring to a stick they beat their wives with.<br /><br />Another thing to note is how he complains about these questions being vague. The whole point of making a very general test to find your specific political point is to have vague questions that you interpret. People that tend to align in one area of the quadrant interpret and answer these questions one way and the same for others.<br /><br />And final thing are the people in the comments that disagree with the placing of historical figures on the compass, specifically Hitler. There were two factions of the Nazi party: the core NSPD party we know of today, and the Strasserists. This bipartisanship was a way to maximize the support for the Nazi party to compromise between a right and left wing cores on culture. A main difference are the Nazis believing Jews were genetically inferior and Strasserists believing they were culturally hoarding money disparaging Germans. The incident of night of the long knives was an removal of the Strasserists by primarily assenting their leaders and other dissenting groups to facilitate Hitlers goals of right wing ethno totalitarianism. They are center-right as they retained some Strasser values. But keep in mind, right or left was less important for Nazi ideology and it was an emphasis on totalitarian state its constituents submitted to. And then to the comments that say ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know they took this test‚Äù, you don‚Äôt need to assign historical figures a test in order to analyze where historical figures lie historically.<br /><br />Getting upset over this website is just weird victim play about website that is just their to assess your political quadrant.

"I also placed right libertarian. (8.13 Right. -3.33 Down) Though considerably more libertarian than you did. I think the difference came in that the test assumes that religious people are more authoritarian. (I doubt it is possible to really get much further down than 3 or 4, considering I have taken this test a number of times, sometimes to just get the most libertarian score possible while ignoring my own beliefs, and found it impossible. I just took it and -3.33 is the furthest down I have ever seen it.) So it follows the idea that if you want your child&#39;s school to instill &quot;religious values&quot;, you are authoritarian. Even though a better way to interpret the question would be to say &quot;being anti-murder is a religious value and loving one&#39;s neighbor is a religious value,&quot; I doubt that the people who wrote the test thought of it that way. When they wrote the question, they were thinking that the people who agreed to the sentiment were supporting crucifixes in the classroom and teachers reading the gospel at the start of every hour.<br />     As for the pornography, I would say that pornography should absolutely be legal, since it is in no way the government&#39;s place to prevent you from making harmless (third-party-wise) but sinful mistakes. A government that is run on the principles of forcing its constituents to follow the bible to the letter, while morally good, is effectually bad. If people want to sin, they should be allowed, legally, to sin. (Unless we are talking about murder or rape.) And the moral principles depend on who is in office. Give that Christianity, in this hypothetical, is true, and Islam is not. Have a Christian foundation to the government. Those that start it up make all of the laws to start everything off. Those laws would morally be great. (Again, effectually not, since the government is overstepping its bounds and controlling the lives of its constituents. But in the eyes of God, the government is leading people to live morally.) Then an Islamic politician gets elected. They make some laws that follow what is considered morally good in Islam. Now, the laws are, in this hypothetical, morally bad (since these specific laws contradict Christianity in some way), and effectually bad, since they are still overstepping of the government&#39;s bounds.<br />     So, I do believe that people have a right to view pornography. But having a right to something doesn&#39;t inherently mean that said thing is morally sound. It is in no way the government&#39;s place to enforce moral living, and what you do in your own free time, (as long as you aren&#39;t hurting any third-party individuals), is not the government&#39;s business.",Camden Tellkamp,2020-03-27T04:03:00Z,0

"Bene Why I‚Äôm right wing because I believe in capitalism and a free market. I think distribution of wealth is a quick way to lower the overall wealth of the entire society, and socialism basically makes everyone equal by making everyone poor. And I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a good thing to let religion influence politics. Laws should be meant to protect people‚Äôs rights and stop people from harming each other. I think it‚Äôs immoral to kill someone, so murder should be illegal. Due to religion, I also happen to believe it‚Äôs immoral to have sexual relations with someone you‚Äôre not married to, but I wouldn‚Äôt support government regulation of that, since consensual sex harms no one. I think morals come from God, and laws are based on morality. However not all immorality should be legislated, because not all immorality involves someone harming another person. <br /><br />I‚Äôm not explaining all this to argue or try to convince you of anything. I‚Äôm just rationalizing my position so that, while you probably disagree with me, maybe you can at least understand why my beliefs make sense to me, and why I‚Äôm not necessarily unintelligent just because of those beliefs.

"And that&#39;s one of the many factors that led to the world being split in two superpower blocks and caused the cold war. Not to mention, millions of people being doomed to live under the yoke of communism for several generations, and against their will.<br /><br />If you compromise your morality allying today with someone of questionable motivations, morals and principles, it&#39;ll inevitably come back to bite your ass in the future. It&#39;s the way it goes, and is exactly what happened in your example.<br /><br />Now I&#39;m not saying it should never be done (if the alternative to allying yourself with your enemy is losing a war like WW2 against a foe like the Axis, it means that is not a real alternative at all), but at least you should not lie about it. <br /><br />Meaning, maybe there was no option in 1941 for the UK (and later the US) than to get allied with the USSR....but the way the USSR and Stalinism was covered in the western media from the moment Germany invaded the Soviet Union is a shame, and is one of the reasons why people wasn&#39;t aware of what was going to happen once the war was over, until it actually happened. Because the media (under the vigilant eye of the governments of the time, of course) was just too busy picturing the soviets as the paragon of heroes and trustful friends, while silencing the true horrors and crimes of the stalinist regime, both inside their own borders, and outside them.<br /><br />Let&#39;s not forget that by the end of 1940 western media were picturing Stalin and the USSR as pretty much the same level as Hitler, based on their agression on Poland and Finland in 1939, their illegal invasion, ocupation and anexation of the Baltic states in 1940, and the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact. At that stage Stalin was almost as much a figure to be hated as Hitler was. 7 months later he turned into some kind of angelic hero all of a sudden. Poland was forgotten, so was Finland, so was Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. The Katyn massacre was not reported in the majority of western media when news reached the west about it, nor any mention was made about the USSR pretty much sitting still while waiting for the rising of Warsaw to be crushed, nor about the subsequent abuses in poland after it&#39;s &quot;liberation&quot;, nor about the mass rapes commited by the &quot;Valiant, heroic and friendly&quot; soviet forces in eastern europe as they were &quot;liberating it&quot;.<br /><br />Because those things were not worth talking about. And they weren&#39;t because the western allies didn&#39;t want those things to be told. So yea, there are some things to be told about Mr. Churchill&#39;s statement and stance about the soviets, and about it&#39;s criminal implications on what happened in the closing stages of WW2 and in the following 50 years.",ramjb,2020-03-27T09:36:56Z,31

"Bene Why see you‚Äôre out here telling people that at they‚Äôre logically inconsistent, when you just said it‚Äôs okay to kill a baby as long as it needs it‚Äôs mother to survive. Newborn babies need their mothers to survive. Hell, humans need mothers or at least some sort of nurturing adult in order to survive at least until they‚Äôre three years old.",big jahn,2020-03-27T02:52:46Z,0
"@big jahn<br />Realistically, most abortions don&#39;t take place that late though. If they take place that late, it&#39;s most of the time because of a certain risk for the mother. In those cases, the mother is the clear priority. <br />In the incredible rare case, that the mother isn&#39;t in danger and she wants a late term abortion, sure im willing to discuss if that&#39;s moral. <br /><br />Abortions are always justified, as long as the fetus needs a mother to survive, period. <br />Arguing against that is silly.<br />That&#39;s why engaging with people that believe all abortions should be illegal is a waste of time.",Bene Why,2020-03-27T02:46:23Z,0
"Bene Why no you don‚Äôt get to dismiss an argument just because it doesn‚Äôt make sense to you. The thing about the argument is that someone like me would argue that the line that separates a fetus from a person MUST be clear and logical. If something that‚Äôs not a person can turn into a person, we should definitely know exactly when it becomes a person in order to decide when it‚Äôs okay to kill it. To me, the point of birth makes no sense because the baby itself really isn‚Äôt a different being before and after traveling through the birth canal. The fact that a baby can be born any time within a several week period proves that its status as a human life really can‚Äôt logically change during birth. If it‚Äôs wrong to kill a newborn, it‚Äôs no less wrong to kill it before birth.",big jahn,2020-03-27T02:34:46Z,0

It measures your standing on four dimensions: Authority vs Liberty, Markets ve Equality, Nation vs World, Progress vs Tradition.<br />While I typically don‚Äôt agree with some values associated with the right, I think it‚Äôs best to branch off of the notion that left is this, right is that, and instead use more axes of measurement to better quantify broad values that are not inherent to one side or another,",Sabagegah,2020-03-26T16:39:24Z,1

"@Bene Why Only 6 percent of wars throughout history has been caused by religion, and for every bad thing that&#39;s been done by &quot;religious people&quot;, there are 6 good things that have been done in it&#39;s place. For instance, the earliest scientists(natural philosophers as they were called at the time) began their quest to understand the universe on the basic premise that the natural world is the creation of a rational gods, operating in rational patterns that could be understood by the human mind. <br /><br />Secondly, the argument that horrible things have been done in the name of religion is an egregious example of tunnel vision. Horrible things have been done in the name of virtually everything. For instance, at the bedrock of Stalin&#39;s communist state was the belief that the state takes the place of God, seeing as God did not exist(atheism). The latter part is literally written in the Soviet Union&#39;s equivalent of the declaration of Independence. Also, do I need to mention how horrible things have been done in the name of science? Contributing firsthand to absolutely horrendous ideologies like racism, ethno-nationalism, sexism etc. Patriotism/nationalism has also birthed multiple evils e.g  Hitler&#39;s imperialism. Politics has also wreaked havoc upon multiple societies in the past. I could go on, but the point remains that ideologues may wreak havoc multiple times in the name of their beliefs, it usually says very little of the ideology&#39;s nature, for men are by their very nature tribalistic, and prone to violence. And when these two collide... well, gun powder keg meets lighter, shit hits the fan.<br /><br />&quot;I&#39;m not religious, I&#39;m a pretty moral person&quot;<br />Completely useless to point this out, showing you weren&#39;t listening to the video.

(Bill, on the other hand, would be dead center. He&#39;ll be wherever he can get the most &#39;girl parts&#39;. He has no other interest.) Reagan would be about where Thatcher is. Gandhi believed in individual freedoms and rights, not in government mandates. So, Gandhi would also be dead center, but because he did not really care about the political or economic system. He just believed in treating each other well.

Ben likely has homeschooling and private schools in mind. These options manage to achieve both these things (oftentimes preparing kids for jobs better than non-religious public schools), so it is certainly possible to have both. üëå",Luke H.,2020-03-28T15:58:54Z,0

"Openness about sex certainly has gone too far, thanks to Alfred Kinsey&#39;s fraudulent reports on human sexuality.<br />I might add that there&#39;s no such thing as a stable, loving, same-sex couple.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Pornography was illegal in the Founder&#39;s time.

Moral Biblical principles were the basis for US common law. <br /><br /><br />And pornography is immensely harming third-parties, anyone who watches it is harmed, most particularly children who are traumatized and psychologically scarred by exposure to it, growing up with a warped view of human sexuality.

"Stalin was, definitely, authoritarian-left. Gandhi was also Libertarian, but whether if he&#39;s a leftist or a right-winger, I&#39;m unsure about that. Friedman was definitely libertarian right. Thatcher was authoritarian right as well, albeit I&#39;m not sure if she was that authoritarian. Hitler is a very interesting case though. He&#39;s definitely authoritarian, but whether if he&#39;s left or right, economically, is tricky. Fascism sort of defies the economic spectrum. They are definitely against communism, hence their invasion of the Soviet Union in WWII. He is definitely not for equality, hence the economic discrimination in the 1930s and, later, the holocaust. Hitler&#39;s welfare program only benefit &quot;Aryan Germans&quot;. So no equality of opportunity which is a leftist ideal. However, much of the economic growth that Nazi Germany had prior to WWII was mostly due government spending on the military which is leftist. So I would put Hitler in the economic center, if not, center-right, which is where the quiz puts him at. Of course, we can never fully know where they will be because they&#39;re dead. As for Ben, the results are what I expected: right-wing, borderline libertarian and authoritarian. The fact that he wants religious values being taught in public schools is, clearly, authoritarian in my opinion. Schools should not actively push for a specific religion, because the U.S is a secular nation.",VanMan 23,2020-03-26T08:08:58Z,1

"Almost everyone who takes this test ends up in the lower right, which suggest it&#39;s not socialist propaganda, but Libertarian propaganda. Although you could make the argument that that is actually accurate, since the economic &quot;Far Left&quot; basically doesn&#39;t exist in the conversation anymore, and people like Bernie Sanders are more moderate left. No one is talking about central planning and nationalizing industries, so no one actually scores over on the left side of the graph. I would suggest this is not a bad thing, just that we figured out those were shit ideas, and now we&#39;re all just arguing about how much capitalism is good.<br /><br /><br />On the social scale, they put politicians far more authoritarian than most people actually score. Almost all major politicians and parties are in the upper right, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s quite accurate. Margaret Thatcher should be a bit lower down, as should Clinton and Obama and Bush and every other politician they put on there. Again, someone like Ben is a bit socially conservative, and he gets middle, mostly because the extreme authoritarian fascist ideas, while existing, are espoused by almost no one anymore, and that&#39;s probably a very good thing.",Virtuoso80,2020-03-26T07:11:12Z,0

The scaling isn&#39;t that ridiculous. From what I can tell the numbers are distances from an arbitrary center. You can debate weather Hitler was on the left or the right and I&#39;m sure Ben thinks he&#39;s on the left. But he&#39;s clearly left of Thatcher and right of Stalin so the scaling isn&#39;t really that bad.<br /><br />The problem with political compass is 1.) the vague and biased question [as Ben points out 50 times] and 2.) arbitrary center for both axes. You can fix the first easily by just updating the test and writing better questions. But the second problem is much trickier. Who says what&#39;s center?,Patrick Gunning,2020-03-26T06:26:55Z,0

"@jack jon He didn&#39;t say &quot;barbaric views&quot;, though. That was Ben&#39;s own characterization of what the interviewer said. He said &quot;they seem to take us back to the dark ages&quot; and gave examples of how you may get 30 years for miscarrying, or if you go to another state to get an abortion, you may get 10 years. Those are indeed quite extreme punishments when we compare them to most Western countries, and I don&#39;t think it was an unfair characterization of the abortion laws. He simply asked Ben to defend such an extreme position. Also, to my understanding, the interviewer asks this kind of questions from everybody, regardless of their political leanings.<br /><br /><br />Ben could have easily handled the situation much better. He went to the interview like it was a debate. Yes, sometimes interviewers ask tough and a bit unfair questions, but if you want to come out of the interview looking good, you need to keep calm. Ben could have easily explained his views and showed why he doesn&#39;t think those abortion laws would take us back to the dark ages. Or he could have pointed out that the framing of the question is unfair in a calm way and explained his views. But instead, he just attacked the interviewer for not being an &quot;objective journalist&quot;.<br /><br /><br />And no, it wasn&#39;t the same as asking whether someone has stopped beating their wife. Ben could have easily answered that question, and answering it wouldn&#39;t have made him look bad.

"I just watched your answers.  It&#39;s funny how you struggled with the porn question for the same reasons I struggle with the abortion question.  Only, the porn question was an easy answer for me.  Abortion is wrong and no woman should get an abortion.  Is abortion murder?  Maybe, it&#39;s a baby more than the moment before it exits its mother.  The question should be when is it a baby.  I don&#39;t know the precise answer to when is a baby a baby.<br /><br />Killing a baby is murder and I expect the government to prosecute anyone that harms a baby.  However, I don&#39;t want the government making laws against women having the maximum possible control over their reproduction.  Seems simple to say abortion until it&#39;s a baby should be legal.  But, it&#39;s not simple because I&#39;m not sure science can agree on the answer to this question.<br /><br />Even if we did have a simple way to define when a baby is a baby.  What happens when a woman wants an abortion 1 week after her &#39;it&#39; becomes a baby.  What if a woman learns 1 week after the magic moment that it becomes a baby, that there is a complication that will risk her life and she wants an abortion.  The &#39;what if&#39;s&#39; are endless.<br /><br />I find the abortion issue to be so difficult.  I know I don&#39;t like where we are know on the issue.  This stupid political spectrum graph doesn&#39;t correctly plot my position by asking 1 stupid abortion question.  One stupid porn question covers that topic completely.",gjdewald,2020-03-26T03:18:09Z,0

Unfortunately Hitler and Stalin weren&#39;t around to take the quiz but one can fill in the blanks rather easily and be fairly correct on their political views. Stalin and Hitler&#39;s results were probably near the correct locations on the quiz. Both authoritarians but Stalin was definitely a socialist authoritarian. Hitler believed in people needing strong rule to keep morals and values in check. Hitler also allowed the citizens of Germany to have more freedoms and economic individual success than Stalin. Hitler may have scored even more to the right if whoever filled in the blanks told the truth regarding his views on gun ownership. Hitler was pro gun and encouraged the citizens of Germany to own guns and that it was also their duty to defend the country if they had to. Hitler loosened gun laws even further during his reign. Mind boggling people still believe the myth passed around for decades Hitler disarmed his people with firm gun control. The only people not allowed to own guns were enemies of the state. Citizens of Germany were well armed. Hitler even carried a pistol often. Hitler also helped Germany become the most industrialized country in the world. He truly was a great leader in many respects. Then war and the holocaust completely erased any of his accomplishments during his reign. Many bright leaders have crazy ideologies.,Todd Zehr,2020-03-26T00:39:32Z,1

"@John Waters Hi, thanks for the reply and i see what you mean but from a religious perspective, no one can decide to take a life away-not even the Estate-, regardless of the severity of the crimes, because every human life is sacred before god, so the death penalty can never be an option in the eyes of the faifhtfull.

And at some points they were going as such &quot;Right wingers tend to score slightly higher in psychopatic traits but that&#39;s not representative of most right wingers&quot;. They can&#39;t be confronted on insinuating the right wing was worse and psychopathic right? Even tho they didn&#39;t use a negative equivalent to categorize the left.<br /><br />Plus that article was absolutely idiotic. &quot;categorization is dangerous because it simplifies&quot; Yes, that&#39;s the point of it.

"Curious about your answer to the question about letting people with serious inheritable disabilities reproduce. Is your answer (strongly in favor of letting them reproduce) put forth on the basis of wanting to avoid restrictions on personal freedom? Or something else?<br /><br />Personally, I&#39;m not sure I see this stance as being consistent with a stance like, say, advocating safe sex or celibacy. We practice safe sex in order to avoid the negative personal consequences of unsafe sex (STD&#39;s, unwanted pregnancy, etc.). In essence, we restrict our freedom in order to reduce harm. Now, if a known possible consequence of sex is to pass on a serious disability to another person, doesn&#39;t reproduction now carry more significant moral weight? Wouldn&#39;t it be more moral to not reproduce as to not harm an innocent party (the child)?<br /><br />Again, if your answer was on the basis of preserving personal freedom, I would side with you. But if, with that freedom, I decided to have a child while knowing of the potential harm, then I believe I would be morally culpable for having that child.<br /><br />Also curious to hear others thoughts on this.",BeastlyCold,2020-03-25T20:59:47Z,0

"@Longbow Thats biggest comintern of the lie of the 20th century. Nazi Germany had state controlled economy similar to modern day China.

They didn&#39;t actually give control of the economy to the private sector in fact it was the complete opposite. It was purposed by Hjalmar Schacht who wasn&#39;t even an ideological Nazi and Hitler was initially hesitant on implementing it. Its similar to what Lenin did with his New Economic Policy or what China did to attract foreign investment in the 80s. Even Wikipedia which a shitty source states this &quot;However, the privatization was &quot;applied within a framework of increasing control of the state over the whole economy through regulation and political interference,&quot;. Whether a company was technical private or state owned was meaninglessness because the government controlled almost everything from pricing, wages, production,etc.... They even had Nazi party members as board members in many of these companies dictating what the state wanted.

EVERYONE owns capital, just more and less of it depending on the value you offer. A barista&#39;s added value is not the same as a heart surgeon&#39;s added value.

That&#39;s simply not the case. Everyone offers economic value to varying degrees, and gets out of the free market system what they&#39;re willing to put in. The people who engage in the most mutually beneficial consensual transactions are the ones who are the wealthiest.<br /><br />You need to explain why you think<br />1. Hierarchy of ALL kinds is bad.<br />2. Anarchy is against all hierarchies, not just governmental ones. Especially since you already painted a hypothetical picture of people banding together to punish evil, which is hierarchical by definition.<br /><br />&quot;most profit goes to those at the top if it didn‚Äôt you wouldn‚Äôt be employed.&quot;<br /><br />- Right, because those at the top accept all the risk and input all the startup capital.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be moral without being religious‚Äù this question is particularly hard for me because I don‚Äôt even believe non-religion exists.,John Waters,2020-03-25T14:08:09Z,1
"‚Äã@John Waters <br />&#39;The point of the word religious is to distinguish behavior.&#39;<br />No, it is to describe a belief. But why not: what specific behavioural pattern does the word &#39;religion&#39; exist to describe? <br />&#39;Every person has a god that they wish to please.&#39;<br />Nope. Prove it.<br /><br />&#39;It‚Äôs like choosing a moral template (other religions) vs creating your own custom morality (atheism).&#39;<br />People &#39;choose&#39; neither their religion nor their lack thereof. They rarely even seriously consider the basis of their morality. Also, atheism itself has literally nothing at all to do with creating a system of morality, nor does atheism imply any specific moralistic system.<br /><br />&#39;I understand that this does screw up a some definitions that we have currently&#39;<br />It doesn&#39;t screw up the definition, <b>you&#39;ve screwed up the definition.</b> Using a word wrong only screws up the definition if you can convince everyone else to use it in the same way.<br /><br />&#39;Atheism does have a rigorous set of beliefs (evolution and humanism) while you don‚Äôt need to understand evolution to be an atheist, you don‚Äôt need to understand creationism to be a Christian.&#39;<br />What? Do you seriously think that? Do you think that there were no atheists before Darwin or Lamarck? Do you think evolution requires any sort of belief other than the notion that reality, as we perceive it, exists? How does this work with christians who understand and study evolution? What?<br />And how can atheism have a &#39;rigorous set of beliefs&#39; that they also don&#39;t need to understand? Are we redefining &#39;rigor&#39; to also mean &#39;no rigor&#39; now?<br /><br />&#39;Atheists, Christians, Islamics, etc.. all have a rigorous set of beliefs that shape their worldview.&#39;<br />What is the &#39;atheist&#39; worldview? Atheism is the lack of a very specific worldview. A-theism.<br /><br />&#39;The only difference is that the atheist makes their own morality. &#39;<br />Unless they believe in zen or communism or any other active belief system. One doesn&#39;t make one&#39;s own morality based on what one doesn&#39;t believe - and atheism doesn&#39;t preclude a belief in the afterlife, or ghosts or reincarnation or the karmic wheel or all sorts of metaphysical shenanigans.<br /><br />&#39;At the same time though, if I were to say Atlantis does exist under your analogy. Does that mean that I have a rigorous understanding of underwater geography?&#39;<br />If you were to say that it does exist, I would ask why you think that. If you then went on to say that you&#39;re an expert in underwater geography and you&#39;re a diver and just yesterday you visited the city of Atlantis I would then reconsider my lack of belief in Atlantis and update my belief with your new evidence. If, in answer to the question, you just said &#39;iunno, and not believing in Atlantis is the same as believing in Atlantis anyway,&#39; I would likely just believe that you&#39;re a twat<br /><br />&#39;Saying that one is an atheist does say something about someone. They just aren‚Äôt part of any large organized religion and (rather) part of their own personal religion.&#39;<br />Funny how you won&#39;t give any specifics about what it &#39;says&#39; about anyone. Every single infant is an atheist. <br />And there are plenty of atheists in organisations dedicated to the strong belief in UFOs.<br /><br />&#39;Just for the record, I‚Äôm probably not what you would consider ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùreligious.‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù&#39;<br />So you don&#39;t have any religious beliefs or don&#39;t take any of your beliefs religiously?<br /><br />&#39;P.S this is a lot more fun than debating creationists.&#39;<br />That&#39;s because they privilege faith over facts, which negates conversation and debate by default - sadly, even creationists tend to put more effort into learning their excuses than the average atheist who, after concluding that there is no solid basis for a belief in god, proceeds to not bother at all inspecting what they <b>do</b> believe and instead just argue with creationistts from the cheap seats.

"I AM JURELL <br />‚Ä¢ The point of the word religious is to distinguish behavior. Every person has a god that they wish to please. I find it rather narrow minded that having some magical sky daddy as your moral backbone isn‚Äôt on the same level as becoming your own moral standard. It‚Äôs like choosing a moral template (other religions) vs creating your own custom morality (atheism). The Supreme Court has declared that secular humanism is a bonafide religion. (I can find the example of you need me to.)<br />‚Ä¢ I understand that this does screw up a some definitions that we have currently. If everyone magically had this conversation with themself they‚Äôd at least find a minor logical inconsistency at best.<br />‚Ä¢ I don‚Äôt believe your analogy works with the current situation.

"Dhshs Dhshssj <br />The other mans argument still stands, but here is my personal analysis on the situation. Atheists have a god, just like everyone else. The god is simply themselves. The individual is their own moral standard and will please themselves just as they would please any god. I see atheism as a religion that varies between each individual.  Not some kind of third party that has somehow transcended human thought.

"The political compass, while a certainly neat and ambitious concept in theory, is in practice deeply flawed. It only measures responses, and oftentimes the person charting it and making the quiz will forget to leave their own biases at the door. It doesn‚Äôt measure modes of reasoning, and doesn‚Äôt control for biases very well.<br /><br />As such, a person who says the Kulaks deserved it while also supporting gay marriage will be placed in the center of the compass, because it averages out the extreme positions. Furthermore it doesn‚Äôt actually seem to take into account reasoning of how one arrives at their position as well as what the position is, it only factors in the latter. As such it puts thatcher and Hitler closer together on the compass, and puts me (a right wing leaning centrist) closer to the Joe Biden of 2008, Obama, and Mitt Romney than I actually am. This is because I think that the algorithm used to calculate it is unsuitable for complex positions that are either multi tiered in their reasoning OR are contradictory (see: supports gay marriage but the kulaks deserved it example).<br /><br />Political positions are complex, and a function of what principles one holds, the reasoning used to arrive at conclusions, and what conclusions one arrives at. As such a simple algorithm like the compass is poor for handling mapping these positions. It‚Äôs a good idea in theory but a horrible clusterfuck in practice.

"ugh dude I agree, religion is a huge part of history, society, and identity, and it should be examined in these contexts in schools, however I would like to clarify that this does not need to include entertainment of the ideas of religion. Much the same as communism is explained because it is an extremely important topic for understanding the world yet is not entertained as a viable economic system, religions should be explored and taught about without any consideration or discussion of the validity of any religion.<br /><br />Maybe this is what you meant and you just use the word ‚Äúentertain‚Äù a bit differently than I do, but I just wanted to clarify my position in case you were indeed arguing that the validity of religions should be discussed, even if skeptically because that‚Äôs what I consider it to mean when someone mentions ‚Äúentertaining an idea‚Äù",Aidan Hennessey,2020-03-27T03:43:33Z,0

"1. Ben did not say that schools should not teach morality.  He said it should not be their primary function.<br /><br />2. Ben did not say that all schools, in general, should teach religious values.  He said that it was important to him that the school he sends his children to does.  Since Ben is a religious person, this is perfectly reasonable.  An atheist would be equally justified in wanting to send their children to a school that did not instill religious values.  It&#39;s possible to have personal preferences for raising your own children that you do not think should be mandated to all children, wouldn&#39;t you agree?<br /><br />3. Finally, you equated morality and religion, not Ben.

"Gopal Gupta You have a child‚Äôs understanding of the political spectrum, you probably think it‚Äôs just a single line left vs right. The Nazis are right wing because their economic laws were centrist for the most part, as Nazi Germany allowed and encouraged private industry, just with heavy regulation and government oversight. In addition, their welfare programs were not extremely extensive, just enough where members of the party would find benefit. Aside from their economic policy, the Nazis were almost all the way on the right in terms of cultural policy. The cultural axis is progressivism vs conservatism. The Nazis were so conservative to the point where they were willing to commit genocide in the seeking of their overall societal goals. The Nazis were not right wing. Finally, since you wanted to bring up the ‚ÄúDemocrats are the real racists / antisemites‚Äù shit, you‚Äôre right, their policies were similar, and that‚Äôs because 1930 democrats were very right on cultural issues while being more left on economic issues, similarly to the Nazis.",Nathan Weisskopf,2020-03-27T16:13:59Z,0

"&quot;I&#39;m kind of shocked they didn&#39;t place me as more libertarian&quot; well, you want to enforce your religious beliefs on your children and others in your society through abortion and pornography restrictions--though you waffled on enforceability, you called pornography one of the &quot;great evils&quot;, meanwhile there&#39;s children being starved, raped, and slaughtered in the world?<br><br>By the way, sex education reduces rates of teen pregnancy, spread of STIs, and increases age of beginning of sexual activity, so by that metric, we&#39;re not nearly open enough about sex in this culture. Knowledge about sex will make us safer. Hiding it, as you seem to be advocating and as much of this country does, makes us stupid, irresponsible, and unsafe. Are there some annoyingly sexual ads and music videos, I guess, but those are natural products of the free market in a sexually repressed society, and the numbers don&#39;t indicate that such things make us behave more sexually irresponsible--again, only ignorance does that.<br><br>But most distressingly to this strong libertarian, you didn&#39;t stop to think about whether your children should be able to decide their religious beliefs for themselves. Whether the state lets us jam our children into brainwashing factories or requires us to jam our children into brainwashing factories, brainwashing factories for children are maybe not particularly liberty-oriented. If someone wants to send their children to a school that teaches Taliban values, are you ok with that? If yes, good job on consistency I guess but I doubt you&#39;re actually in favor of allowing that kind of oppression and abuse, so... if not, then maybe parents should only get the chance to teach their children their religious beliefs at home, and school should be a neutral zone.<br><br>Sometimes you&#39;ve got to decide whether a little state regulation (like, homicide being made illegal and enforced as such) will make us all freer. I&#39;m glad you expressed the belief that the most important thing for children is to develop rational mindsets, I agree with that, but allowing religion-based schooling, at least as we see it in America today, is a rough place to start.<br><br>I see a lot of contradictions between your professed goals and your proposed policies, Ben. If you think (your) religion should have government backing, you&#39;re not much of a libertarian. That&#39;s ok, by the way, you can just say you&#39;re between authoritarian and libertarian. I think your authoritarian leanings are wrong, but you&#39;d be at least more self-aware. But the fact that you think you&#39;re such a strong libertarian, with the beliefs you hold?

Thijs mannens protectionism is also forcing something to be made state side instead of overseas because it is necessary if we went to war we need to have that resource even if they stopped selling to us. For instance steel and oil production need to exist state side even though in a open market steel and oil would be cheaper out of country. So protectionism makes sense there.

"Agree with some of Shapiro&#39;s criticism of the compass, but if you read the creator&#39;s statements they aknowledge and adress those beforehand. It&#39;s difficult to accurately chart political views since there are so many. The wording of some questions are strange, but that&#39;s intentional and assuming the creators are competent accounted for in the assigned values. Its purpose is to meassure differences between people and I&#39;d say it did that fairly well since before taking the test I placed myself slightly left and slightly libertarian of Shapiro and that&#39;s where I ended up. I assume that&#39;s because I&#39;m less strongly opposed to taxation taking me further left on the economic scale and less religious and sexually stringent taking me further libertarian. In that sense the wording of the questions is merely a matter of calibration and it makes sense to calibrate for someone smack in the middle, hence why the wording upsets people not anywhere near it.",R.

Hitler was economically as left-wing as possible. <br /><br />He despised the capitalists in &#39;Mein Kampf&#39; and ordered huge welfare programs! He also hated the stockmarket as it allowed foreign  companies to buy german companies.,Maarten van der Poel,2020-03-25T08:20:32Z,5
"@Sam Hilditch Like @Red. already pointed out, you can&#39;t assume how I feel about Hitler based on my comment, nor can you take away anything about my political believes.

Hitler was very left-wing on the economic scale, he was a classical socialist (with a flavour of war economics).<br /><br /><br />2. Hitler hated the stockmarket because it allowed foreign powers to buy German companies. <br /><br /><br />Concerning the first statement, I would recommend reading the following book and article:<br /><br /><br />Occupied economies : an economic history of Nazi-occupied Europe summary by doctor Hein Klemann.<br /><br /><br />and <a href=""https://www.jstor.org/stable/2597802?casa_token=ozaWiwgeuVQAAAAA:b5sAxFxL9f6_9nGpfJRb2SchB1rZWrJYPRTO5clSFSVkIqeU2_GQlEQi31JCoZ86NCrcdA4hYtxt3fwPYFbGtIzWe40-LBZTrwxCrlnxH1jAt1v3V3_7&amp;seq=5#metadata_info_tab_contents"">https://www.jstor.org/stable/2597802?casa_token=ozaWiwgeuVQAAAAA:b5sAxFxL9f6_9nGpfJRb2SchB1rZWrJYPRTO5clSFSVkIqeU2_GQlEQi31JCoZ86NCrcdA4hYtxt3fwPYFbGtIzWe40-LBZTrwxCrlnxH1jAt1v3V3_7&amp;seq=5#metadata_info_tab_contents</a><br /><br /><br />For the second statement you can simply read the economic passages in Mein Kamps.<br /><br /><br />I posted nothing more and nothing less than statements based on existing literature.

"Why do you always reference the Bible so much? I mean, I have no issue with you, of course, and I agree with you on a lot of issues (those most important to me) and I greatly respect your ability to make such  coherent arguments. However, you reference the Bible a lot, as a basis for certain morals. I get that the USA was built on Christianity originally, but not many people care about that anymore, and you seem to cite the Bible a lot. I don&#39;t have a problem with this - I am a Christian myself, but it doesn&#39;t really make much sense. It also seems to further the misconception that Jews and Christians believe the same thing, have the same Scriptures, etc. (although that might not be such a thing in the US, I don&#39;t know).

"I always said that this graph makes no sense. Reasons:<br />- &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; are too vague. It doesn&#39;t mean anything and the left-right distinction in the US is different from Europe, and it also shifts over time. They are meant to summarize &quot;cultural&quot; aspects.<br />- Anything that is related to the left and economy is always authoritarian: More socialism, more welfare, more taxation, more state debt, more government control of the economy. There is no &quot;Libertarian-left.&quot;<br />- Anything that is not authoritarian, but still on the left, is merely related to the enabling of societal degeneracy, which ultimately necessitates socialist programs to be enabled and financed in the first place. All the &quot;freedoms&quot; they offer are backed by an authoritarian government.<br />- Therefore: The bottom left does not exist. It&#39;s just an euphemism, just as Anarcho-Communists are punks who seek a fully authoritarian communist system while somehow believing they are anti-authoritarian. They merely oppose the <b>current</b> non-communist-enough regime.<br /><br /><br />Better graph would be a triangle with these 3 points on the edge: Globalism, Localism, Libertarianism. Globalism and Localism are inherently authoritarian. Globalism seeks interests beyond the borders including immigration programs. Localism seeks sovereignty and is pro-borders. At their peak both seek government control over people. North Korea is an example of a strongly Localist system. Soviet Union is an example of a strongly Globalist system (it spread the ideology all over the world after all, didn&#39;t it? It was extremely expansionst). Switzerland and young USA is closest to be a Libertarian system. German Nazis are in the middle between Globalism and Localism.<br /><br /><br />The transition between Globalism and Localism can be relatively smooth. Any transition between any of the authoritarian systems towards Libertarianism is significantly more difficult and slower.",Brian Viktor,2020-03-25T08:13:12Z,2
"@2SRL Thimo - &quot;I think your view of leftists has been greatly shaped by social media and conservative news.&quot; - I was a leftist ~4 years ago, so I speak from personal experience. I partly talk about myself in the past, and I dedicated a lot of time to understand Socialism, Communism and Fascism. Don&#39;t assume manipulation on my behalf - I know very well what I am talking about.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Not every&quot; - This argument doesn&#39;t hold water. The point that a generality does not match 100% of all elements doesn&#39;t matter. Exceptions and variance exist, we all know that.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Most Liberals just think that everyone deserves to have a decentish life, no matter what they do unless its harming someone else.&quot; - Why does everyone deserve a decentish life? Who decides who deserves it? Do you deserve a decent life if you are a Nazi who didn&#39;t commit any crime? Do you deserve a decent life if you are a communist who did commit crimes? Do you deserve a decent life if you entered the country illegally and contributed nothing to the social system?<br /><br /><br />&quot;and therefore they follow the public opinion&quot; - At this point they are more contributing to shape public opinion rather than following it - propaganda.<br /><br /><br />&quot;Of course leftists believe their views are superior to right wingers&quot; - Well that proves that hierarchy exists. If one thing is better or preferable to another, then there is something like better or worse. Then there is one hierarchy of things. Then people who inhabit one thing over the other must be better in the &quot;public eye.&quot; Meaning: Saying one is against the concept of hierarchy is not a feasible belief to have. Saying one favors a different type of hierarchy however is!<br /><br /><br />&quot;And I dont think these views I hold are very radical&quot; - They aren&#39;t. It&#39;s quite normal. Communism is btw worse than National Socialism even in the worst version we demonize it.<br /><br /><br />&quot;because social democracy is a threat to their potential profits&quot; - Well, actually Social Democracy is the very system that fuels &quot;economic fascism&quot; the most. The perfect mix of sufficient capitalism and government control, giving politics enough power so that corruption (lobbyism) can bloom the most - so that big corporations are incentivized to funnel money into politics and bureaucracy for their own profit. In a solely totalitarian society the economy would be too crushed to siphon enough wealth from, in a too free market there would be no pockets to be filled for the government. And the population and working people (employees and employers) are the ones being burdened by all of that theater. So the &quot;intellectuals&quot; produced in the government education camps financed by tax payers can continue they work about how having &quot;intellectuals&quot; produced by government education camps paid by tax payers is just the best thing ever.",Brian Viktor,2020-03-25T11:45:06Z,0
"@2SRL Thimo 2. &quot;that is enforced by some means&quot; - And socialists proved it to be more true than ever! It became WORSE and more rigid as socialism unfolded in any society. As long as there are values by which we evaluate people - be it beauty, skill, intelligence, wisdom, strength, dedication, or in the case of leftists &quot;conformity&quot;, etc - there will always be a hierarchy. As long as there is ANY difference in what humans are, there will be hierarchies. Unless we are 100% clones of the same person, there will always be hierarchy. And it&#39;s multi-dimensional, nuanced, complex and subject to change. Denying that is fantasy - and that is exactly what egalitarianism is - a big fantasy hoax perpetuated for the purpose of a power grab on behalf of some &quot;elites.&quot;<br /><br /><br />&quot;because it assigns specific jobs and tasks a value and every person is given a &quot;value to society&quot; which is their bank account and therefore determins how priviledged you are&quot; - This is loaded with bias and ideological key words. It&#39;s simple: You are paid based on the value you provide to society in general. If you are a top-notch engineer able to work on complex tasks which 0.0001% of the population is able to, you&#39;ll get damn wealthy. If you run a company overseeing tens of thousands of people providing value to millions of people, you are guaranteed to become wealthy. If you work 10h/week in some easily replaceable job, you&#39;ll be relatively poor. If you work 40h/week but just put in minimum effort, you&#39;ll get paid moderately.<br /><br /><br />Do you know who pays you? Customers. There is no big hand deciding who gets what - it&#39;s a large, complex network of interactions, ultimately relying on satisfying the needs of customers who <b>voluntarily</b> give you money for your service or product. Your framing is just bad.<br /><br /><br />&quot;And they believe that there shouldnt be a government interfering with your freedoms.&quot; - Except that it is 100% unresolveable with: &quot;They want to abolish the concept of money&quot; - unless you impose a government over people to prohibit them from doing things - or use mob justice to prohibit behaviors that manifest naturally. Regardless of money, people who are most productive still get super wealthy compared to the rest, and more productive people will still have more things. It will end up in a 100% capitalist society (aka AnarchoCapitalism)... unless of course they usher in a totalitarian communist regime to prevent this sacrilege called &quot;inequality&quot; to occur in the first place. In that case they are not anarchists, but simply communists or communist enablers (which they are).<br /><br /><br />&quot;thats also because they dont know what communism is&quot; - Yeah, because people foolishly look at the manifestations of every attempt at communism via socialism instead of the nice version of the book, which at this point is proven wrong multiple times now. We look at reality, not fantasy - so in this case, maybe the people opposing communism indeed know better about communism than self-declared communists.",Brian Viktor,2020-03-25T11:22:16Z,0
"@Brian Viktor Listen - I think your view of leftists has been greatly shaped by social media and conservative news. I am personally lib left (like 4 to the left and 6 to libertarian) and I can just tell you that I don&#39;t want a hierarchy, I don&#39;t believe every right winger is a racist, I don&#39;t believe Trump got elected because 48% of the American electorate are racist and really hate all Mexicans. I don&#39;t think I am intellectually or morally superior to anyone except to people who act in bad faith (and of course a little hypocrisy happens to everyone). <br /><br /><br /><br />Not every Leftist is a pink haired feminazi who wants to imprison people for misgendering, just like not every Right winger is a skinhead neonazi who believes black people are inferiour to white people and should be eradicated from our country. <br /><br />Most Liberals just think that everyone deserves to have a decentish life, no matter what they do unless its harming someone else. <br /><br /><br /><br />The majority of the country is tolerant of blacks or LGBTQ people and Hollywood is just some huge coorporations trying to make as much profit as they can (obviously. Not judging them for it. its what they need to do) and therefore they follow the public opinion and do this thing where they provoke an outrage to get people talking about them. The easiest way are just by being hyper woke, because some people will feel offended and you can always claim you are just acting in the most moral way. You get people talking and thats how they gain publicity. Thats no giant conspiracy, thats capitalist actors using laws of the free market to get their shit out to people so they can make more money.<br /><br /><br />Of course leftists believe their views are superior to right wingers, if we believed our values would be inferior there would be no point holding them as everyone of course holds the views and values they consider to be &quot;the best&quot;. I believe the economic policies I endorse are the ones who lead to a healthy, happy and productive society and so do you and there&#39;s no problem in that. <br /><br /><br /><br />Just to get that out of the way: I am no communist by the way. I accept that communism just doesn&#39;t really bring economic prosperity and will after some time just collapse. I believe in Nordic free market Social Democracy, which is still a capitalist system, but tries to make sure that every person who is willing to contribute to society deserves that society helps them in their lives. So I dont need to be told about North Korea, the USSR, China or Venezuela.<br /><br /><br />And I dont think these views I hold are very radical. I dont think I am part of any great evil conspiracy. I dont think I contribute to a great evil conspiracy either. I am just some dude with his moral values, who has a problem with all the hatred and mischaracterization.<br />There are rational left wingers, right wing or corporate media just wont tell you about them, because social democracy is a threat to their potential profits",2SRL Thimo,2020-03-25T11:01:57Z,0

Yet leftists consider themselves morally and intellectually superior, and consider most people opposing them either bigoted, evil, brainwashed, complicit or otherwise bad. They also believe that they know better than you (the population) how to allocate resources and how to run the economy - that&#39;s why they want the government (under their control) to micro-manage as much as possible - in its extreme manifesting in communism/fascism.<br /><br /><br />And while they pretend to promote a classless society, they weirdly seem to inhabit all sorts of positions of authority and power - mainstream media, Hollywood, education, academia, politics - where the word and art (propaganda) is the tool of the craft.<br /><br /><br />They DO believe in social hierarchy, they just want it to be reshaped in a way where they are the aristocracy and every pleb bows down before their authority, nobody daring to question them any more. Meritocracy is the type of social hierarchy they actually oppose - they do not want productivity to rule, they want ideological conformity to rule - basically like a vicious religion.

"The essential ideological difference between the left and the right is:<br />Do you believe in social hierarchies or is everyone the same?<br /><br />The left essentially believes everyone is worth the same and deserves the same. Classical egalitarianism.<br />The right believes there is supposed to be a hierarchy in society that is enforced by some means<br /><br />Communism is a left wing ideology because the premise is that everyone gets the same amount of money or the same amount of supplies bevause they are equal and deserve equal pay and living quality<br />Capitalism is a right wing system because it assigns specific jobs and tasks a value and every person is given a &quot;value to society&quot; which is their bank account and therefore determins how priviledged you are. If youre worth more to society you deserve that pool, the sportscar and the big house enforcing a social hierarchy.<br /><br />Going from there lets look at Anarchism. Anarchists (Not talking about anarchoCapitalists) believe that every person is worth the same. They want to abolish the concept of money itselt which determins hoe much you deserve in a capitalist society.

"I was 3.38 Right and -2.62 Liberterian. It&#39;s amazing how close most people are towards the center, yet politicians are becoming more and more divided in policy. They should revise this test and lengthen it to reach more subject matter, then have each political candidate fill it out and make all answers and results public. Then at the end of their term, grade them on how close their policy votes were in accomplishing their view points prior to election. The political forum has become too much of a publicity stunt rather than focus on each individuals policy and how well they&#39;re able to enact them during their time in office. <br /><br /><br />It&#39;s difficult for me to even agree with many of the candidates these days considering how extreme each side goes towards one spectrum or another. A publicized testing for each candidate and how closely they align to such testing during term would go a long ways in providing more educated voting. I&#39;ve always said voting registration should come with a questionnaire and prior to each election all candidates should publish their own results of the same questionnaire. These monetized political debates do very little in showing the candidates true colors. Everyone is out playing one side of the other in an extreme fashion that&#39;s unhealthy and only creates divide. <br /><br /><br />I also think that political salaries and anything self serving such as term limits should be voted on by the people rather than by congress. Imagine taking some business realm. Say the Human Resources department of Wells Fargo, and they are the ones allowed to vote on matters that impact only themselves such as pensions and salaries. You&#39;ll never enact change through that of a democracy when the people impacted are the only ones allowed to vote on what amounts to their financial destiny.",Britt Ormsby,2020-03-25T08:05:28Z,0

"One thing I really appreciate about you Mr. Shapiro is your ability to separate different subsections of your philosophies and be able to isolate them. For example the question regarding pornography, you were able to isolate the legality and the moral responsibility and evaluate them independently and ultimate come to two different answers depending on the question as opposed to crossing them into an unrecognizable mutant hybrid of the conflicting internal view points. To me this introspective behavior is the foundation to understanding and accepting the limits of big government.

But teaching them values as it pertains to a particular religion? Absolutely not. That is the responsibility of the churches and religious community, <i>not</i> our public education system. The schools should encourage children to become good citizens and obey the law, but nothing more. Of course they should also achieve enough maturity to question and/or protest the law if they see it as unjust (example: Jim Crow) by graduation, but obey it nonetheless until it is officially repealed.

After all you can&#39;t be libertarian if you believe the majority should subjugate themselves for the few, and believe in a system that needs a state to maintain private property, trade obligations, monetary systems, legal frameworks for the corporate structure that separates capitalist modern industry from petty feudal properties and the police to repress the working class.

"I agree that the questions are too dubious. For example the questions miss from building on a negative such as that the prime function of schooling should be to equip the future generation to find jobs.<br />I think the prime function of education is to teach children how to think, not what to think. And is finding jobs the same as creating jobs? Sort of but not quite. Being productive would be better than finding jobs because it&#39;s broader. Finding jobs implies too much that there are jobs out there already and a bunch of people are trying to second guess what the historical requirements are that would have best got you to what was on offer.<br />But the idea that being taught how to think is lost on most of the education process.

"@dragonlogos1 My problem with you&#39;re intial comment is not that you can believe something is immoral and still believe violent video games don&#39;t cause violence, but your statement about living dark fantasies. I&#39;ve never had a fantasy about robbing a bank or being in a high speed pursuit with police. Video games and real life are simply different. I can enjoy robbing a convenience store in grand theft auto for ingame currency that I can use to buy cars and race my friends. I also enjoy hiding in a hospital and being in a gunfight with the police department in the video game. I don&#39;t have a fantasy about doing that in real life. Video games aren&#39;t immoral unless you purpose them for that reason yourself. If an individual decides they want to shoot pedestrians in a video game while fantasising about doing that to real people then yes that is immoral, but when I shoot pedestrians in a video game for target practice it&#39;s not immoral.",LvBlank,2020-03-26T20:45:33Z,0

Without contradicting yourself. <br /><br />And finally on a personal note I actually disagree with Ben on video games and am an avid player and fan of the hobby which is just a hobby and is about the same as any other form of entertainment when it comes to moral or ethical issues. My point is simply that Ben is not waffling by saying that violent video games don‚Äôt cause violence and at the same time can be immoral.,dragonlogos1,2020-03-26T20:30:54Z,0

"@Moony Reel I like your concept and I can&#39;t remember if it was this site or another one that used to survey the actual politicians to get their direct stances on policy (&quot;the political courage test&quot; I think it was called) At first, many prominent politicans voluntarily took the survey and put their concrete stances on things out in the public. But over the years less and less of the big players participated to protect themselves from liability risks and so it never really took off.<br /><br /><br />If you go back to your idea of implementing an approach to a more direct democracy, I think at some point one one has to arrive at the idea that technology could replace vast and inefficient components of the current bureaucracy (like an app that you vote on for policies and the elected officials simply are administrators that have to implement the general will of the people). <br /><br /><br /><br />Personally, I always liked the idea of a tool that allows you to select how your tax dollars are spent in an <i>a la carte</i> style: You pay the same taxes but the system would let you designate whatever percentage you want towards infrastructure, defense, education or grant spending, etc.  You could put it all behind something like education or national defense if you were so inclined, or could split the percentages as you see fit and the budget would have to directly reflect this public data.",BASED in Maine,2020-03-26T04:24:50Z,0

"@Moony Reel I can&#39;t disagree with anything you said, tho I think some of the criticism of the <i>nature</i> of the bias is fair -- IOW, they didn&#39;t exactly &quot;flip the script&quot; on the phrasing of some of the questions trying to illicit a strong &quot;conservative prejudice&quot; (or did they?). <br /><br /> e.g, they phrased some to try and figure out if you&#39;re racist or sexist from a &quot;traditionally conservative&quot; point of view, while they didn&#39;t necessarily set up similar &quot;liberal minded&quot; traps. <br /><br /> I&#39;m sure we both could think of equally critical examples of &quot;liberal bias&quot; (maybe making a strongly phrased pro-abortion question like, &quot;A woman can kill her fetus anytime she wants, its not a human&quot;...this is probably a sh*t example but hopefully you know what I&#39;m trying to get at.).",BASED in Maine,2020-03-26T00:18:37Z,0
Swimming in the Dark The test seems pretty accurate to me. Ben agreed with where the test put him. He only thinks that he‚Äôs more Libertarian than the test gave him credit for. I think Ben is more authoritarian than he realizes. The test pretty much pin pointed him exactly where he belongs like it did for me and I figure anyone else who would take it correctly.

Talking about them in class is fine, but you don‚Äôt have to teach children basic morals with religion. Especially in a public school where most kids are attending. But I pretty much agreed on all the other points.",Jack Finnegan,2020-03-25T03:17:29Z,0

Can Trump be blamed for a tiny minority? I am curious if Duke still says that today.. Considering how pro Israel Don is. I can&#39;t blame one bad apple on the entire bunch. I will always stand with free speech, too. As a white guy I have never met a white supremacist in my country or yours. I&#39;ve never had anyone try and recruit me. Candace Owens tackles this subject and she knows that the amount of neo-nazis is really insignificant to much more pressing issues that should be addressed because they will help more people. Trump passed the legislation to get non violent offenders out of ridiculous prison sentences, mainly for the black community, that&#39;s a very anti-racist move. The racists must be very angry at that. That was something the Clinton&#39;s caused when Bill was president. Look, I&#39;m not saying become a Republican but Trump isn&#39;t that bad, actually he&#39;s quite good with policies. Trump was a democrat almost all his life when you look back.

The reasons the racists, homophobes, (though you keep saying phones) neonazis vote for Trump is because he&#39;s good for them individually and the country they reside in. He has disavowed them all some more than once. He&#39;s good for America the place all these people live and I guess that trumps their identities. You have got to be fucking with me. Good morning.

"It did not put Ben more Libertarian because he wavered on questions like the pron one.  A libertarian would choose strongly agree because a libertarian would not consider the state to have the rightful power to determine such a thing in any way shape or form.  Yes I know the test can&#39;t see him changing answers but those answers where he did not strongly agree or disagree are mostly the questions that would establish  authoritarian vs libertarian views whereas he strongly agreed or disagreed on the right v left questions.  My problem with this type of test is I disagree with the scales themselves.  Authoritarian v libertarian is a synthetic construct put in place because politicians needed other ways to divide people into categories to pull votes.  There is no such thing as a social conservative.  Social conservatives are liberals that simply disagree with democrats.  They want strong government control of the populace,  just they want it in different ways than democrats or progressives.  They are at the end of the day still highly liberal in mindset and not remotely conservative.  It was interesting watching Ben however have the dialogue with himself trying to sort out how to answer those questions.  the pron one is not there to test if you are religious and therefor conservative.

"The scale doesn&#39;t make sense to you because most of your political views have been shaped within the American political system.<br /><br /><br />Most of the American political establishment is in the authoritarian right of the grid. Democrats simply skew closer to the X/Y intersection and Republicans towards Thatcher (<a href=""https://www.politicalcompass.org/uselection2020)"">https://www.politicalcompass.org/uselection2020)</a>. Remember, despite the hyperbole we see in American politics, we can reliably expect some issues to never be a serious political discussion (ex: state ownership of means of production).<br /><br /><br />Hitler is in the right spot. He was extremely authoritarian socially (even to the point of social engineering and genocide) and slightly further left economically than most modern day Democrats (he was okay with making business comply with social goals), but his belief in government intervention in the economy was nowhere close to Stalin&#39;s (state ownership of most means of production).<br /><br /><br />Curiously, you spirit animals from the major parties this cycle were Steyer and Yang.

"I only really disagree with Ben on the state&#39;s role (at any level) in regulating what is considered &quot;moral&quot; behaviour to an individual or group. Obviously things like murder, assault, theft, defamation, etc, ought to be prevented by government; but behaviour that violates these things are not only immoral but directly relating to our physical, economical, reputational well-being among other dimensions of well-being. That is totally fair game for government to regulate, but it would be a little deceptive to call this behaviour merely &quot;immoral&quot;, and and that the government should step in merely on that basis. I&#39;d agree with Ben that porn is not a &quot;right&quot;, but I don&#39;t think it is any of the government&#39;s business to regulate this sort of thing because one would have to appeal to a purely moral (edging towards religious) argument to put in place such a regulation. Do you want the government to be in the business of morality, or should that be left to parents and how they raise their kids? <br /><br /><br />Perhaps I am being uncharitable in my outlook on Ben&#39;s view, but I suspect Ben&#39;s view is guided by his religious commitments, which is fine, but if religion tells you something that is correct, you should be able to come to that conclusion based solely off reason. I don&#39;t really think you can make a rationalistic argument for banning porn (even at a local level) without presupposing that porn is a sort of misconduct. You can totally believe that yourself and hold yourself to that standard, but when you try to get government involved and enforce that belief, I think you need more justification.",Vikram Bawa,2020-03-25T01:28:13Z,10
"I agree and this is how I justify myself as a right libertarian, because I often don&#39;t agree morally with things the left wants to be unregulated however, if government were to be allowed to regulate such moral matters it would allow the government to chose what is and is not morally acceptable which would quickly become a slippery slope and remove power from the people.

"‚Äã@The Fonz Yes, exactly - this is a POLITICAL compass not morality compass. Therefore the test doesn&#39;t care what you believe in, it only tracks how it translates into political action. And since many people, both on right an left, think that if something is wrong it needs to be regulated the test tracks that. <br /><br />The porn question is excellent example - it doesn&#39;t matter whether you think that porn is the best thing in the world or that porn is evil but it still doesn&#39;t make it justifiable for the government to make it illegal because the potential risks of doing so outweighs any potential benefit. Both of these opinions translate into same political action - that you will be against government making porn illegal. And that&#39;s what the test tests.<br /><br />That&#39;s why Thatcher ends up right up there with Hitler, because although she has much more in common with Ben in terms of being conservative, her response on the porn question would be obviously we should ban it because it&#39;s bad for the society.",Gtpk 35,2020-03-25T12:14:37Z,2

"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth means the punishment should fit the crime.  People misinterpret that as revenge when it is speaking to the judges.

Not trying to be rude here, however I believe there&#39;s other ways other than name-calling to get your point across. <br /><br />Also to anyone who replied to this, I did not mean to spark a debate in any way. I just meant to leave a nice comment for people to read. <br /><br />That being said, I will say that I believe you provide a nice analysis as to why the propositions are expressed as such. Identifying extremist positions on an &quot;extremely agree&quot; or &quot;extremely disagree&quot; perspective gives a decent insight on how the algorithm assesses their social and economic placement on the spectrum. <br /><br />Don&#39;t let anyone make you feel bad about leaving a lengthy comment, it can be a rather difficult explanation to get across to people. I understood your thoughts fairly well. My honors thesis (as briefly explained by my initial comment) is supposed to build a version of a political compass exam to test a college student population. By doing this, I would hope to learn from several similar exams in hopes of building a model that provides the best analysis of the student population. <br /><br />There&#39;s no such thing as the perfect political spectrum test. The test that Ben takes in this video is not perfect. Each exam you find online will have its flaws. Even the exam I develop will have significant flaws, I realize that. That&#39;s not to say that each exam can be re-imagined in a way that best projects your outcome. <br /><br />I want my exam to not only show where on the political compass students stand, but also which issues are more important to them. This requires research for me; understanding why students believe so strongly on some issues will help me shape my exam to best conduct the analysis I hope to achieve. I hope that we have each provided insight into why we are taking this particular subject in such a serious manner.",Jaden Costa,2020-03-29T02:05:31Z,1

Ben Shapiro: I began taking this quiz a few months ago and the wording was so biased I gave up half way through. I&#39;m glad you pulled through!

"Some of the questions are slanted! :<br /><br /><br />Most of them are slanted! Some right-wingers accuse us of a leftward slant. Some left-wingers accuse us of a rightward slant. But it‚Äôs important to realize that this isn‚Äôt a survey, and these aren‚Äôt questions. They‚Äôre propositions ‚Äî an altogether different proposition. To question the logic of individual ones that irritate you is to miss the point. Some propositions are extreme, and some are more moderate. That‚Äôs how we can show you whether you lean towards extremism or moderation on the Compass.<br /><br />The propositions should not be overthought. Some of them are intentionally vague. Their purpose is to trigger reactions in the mind, measuring feelings and prejudices rather than detailed opinions on policy.<br /><br />Incidentally, our test is not another internet personality classification tool. The essence of our site is the model for political analysis. The test is simply a demonstration of it.",Randall,2020-03-25T02:32:16Z,0

"I [refer it to simple left/right. But in reality there are more than an X and Y axis in politics. I think it is useful for strictly economic/social issues. Although I think they should have phrased things more on policies rather than feelings. <br /><br />E.g. rather than asking do you think people or transnational corporations should be favored, they should have been specific. If it was general, they should have emphasized protecting public health rather than the &quot;corporations are bad&quot; narrative.They should have asked whether corporations should be able to pollute the environment with chemicals that are toxic to humans, cause birth defects, etc. or ask about occupational health and safety laws. Ben assumed it was a biased question, but there are plenty of examples of transnational corporations putting their profit ahead of human lives. Fossil fuel companies funded climate change denial pseudoscience, tobacco companies purposely cast doubt on the dangers of smoking, the same occurred when lead was discovered to be toxic. <br /><br /> Rather than asking about international law, what should have been asked is agreement with specific laws, like bans on torture, attacking civilians, being the aggressor, etc.",Meredith White,2020-03-26T23:44:15Z,0

"@Patrick Cox Just please spend 10 minutes reading the wiki articles on these subjects and consult their citations if you have disagreements. You are literally arguing against reality and political science. <br /><br /><br />Extreme is a subjective position, I already said this, if the center is what the system is now then the politics of Bernie, the justice democrats, are far left and Ben Shapiro and Tucker are far right. If they had their way the political landscape would be drastically different. This is what extreme means, by definition. <br /><br /><br />Just spend a few minutes reading these, please <br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism</a><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liberalism"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liberalism</a><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy</a><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_populism"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_populism</a><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics</a><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics</a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_political_spectrum"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_political_spectrum</a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism</a><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism</a><br /><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_socialism</a>",Le Roture,2020-03-29T01:01:07Z,0
"@Le Roture okay, you obviously have no idea what the fuck you&#39;re talking about..Sanders isnt even a Democrat and tucker and ben most certainly are not far right...but you&#39;re obviously a foreigner which means you&#39;re brainwashed and indoctrinated into a left bent state of thinking like the vast majority of this world...maybe dont open your mouth on subjects that you are completely and utterly ignorant about, bye now.",Patrick Cox,2020-03-29T00:40:42Z,0
"Patrick Cox Social Liberalism has been the main political ideology of the liberal republics since the creation of the Third-Way movement so yes, people who are social liberals are in the center politically. Social liberalism combines light market regulations with some form of a social safety net. This is right of social democrats who want strong government regulations and a strong social safety net and left of market liberals who want a lightly regulated market and a lighter social safety net. Most moderate republicans would be market liberals and most moderate democrats would be social liberals making the moderates center left and center right respectively, with some overlap. Just read a political science journal my guy. <br /><br />To the extreme left in America you have social democrats (Bernie Sanders) and the extreme right would be National Populists or Libertarians (Tucker Carlson vs Ben Shapiro). Though I‚Äôd again venture to say libertarianism is an inherently incoherent ideology making all ‚Äúlibertarians‚Äù some form of National Populists, especially since National Populism makes no economic claims. <br /><br />What is moderate and what is extreme is subjective, obviously, I‚Äôd just compare it relative to what is the overton window.<br /><br />Again, liberalism has a broad set of goals making anyone of these positions liberal, in the classical sense.",Le Roture,2020-03-28T22:40:44Z,0
"@Le Roture okay, weve entered into cooky land I see..obama and Hillary in the center? HA, okay...liberalism in the classic sense preferred more freedom over less and the modern day democratic party is full of outlandish, authoritarian ideals..big government is generally bad, you cannot convince me otherwise",Patrick Cox,2020-03-28T21:18:54Z,0
"@Patrick Cox I mean by definition democrats are liberals. John Locke, probably the first person to lay out what liberalism means, allows for a broad range of policies anywhere from social democracy (the furthest left democrats) to market liberalism (the furthest right democrats and the only mainstream version of &quot;libertarianism&quot; with social liberals existing in the center such as Obama or Hillary). In fact if you are referring to liberalism as some sort of Hayeckian or Friedmanian version of the term then right wing democrats are about as aligned with that as many republicans. I mean you&#39;re factually wrong and it just seems like you are engaged in motivated reasoning because you view big government bad and the left as bad therefore left= big government. <br /><br /><br />I believe that conservatives in America are National Populists now, and that there don&#39;t exist any genuine libertarians on the right. National Populists are much more big government than any people on the left, even the social democrats.",Le Roture,2020-03-28T01:04:34Z,0
