"I&#39;ve been saying this for months. China is responsible. Seriously...they can&#39;t beat us in a land or air war. Though we are 1/4 their population we&#39;d beat them bloody even with our wussfied military. <br />The best and easiest way to destroy a civilization is from within. <br />China and it&#39;s cronies are footing the bill for the Wokism and racial division. Many companies and organizations like NBA, MLB, fortune 500 companies, much of government etc. Just look at Bidens track record on handling China. Be less White Coke says. Everything IS racist..<br />Yet things are far better than they were just 30 years ago. How? Why? China. Know it. Operate on that and seek to make the change",Richard H,2021-05-08T23:21:14Z,1

"Ben, where have you been? I have been saying that the Lame Stream Media has become the propaganda wing of the Democrat Party for the 10 years at least. According to the Lame Stream Media and the CDC we have had 20% more deaths this year than normal. Not only is this extremely unlikely when digging deeply into the CDC&#39;s own statistics,  we discover some very interesting facts.  The last &quot;excess&quot; death of respiratory disease was in the last week of April,  2020. Covid-19 is a respiratory disease. The CDC reportedly is paying something like $50,000 per reported Covid-19 death.  This makes the CDC having paid out $30 Billion. Doesn&#39;t that sound like sufficient bait for hucksters? Right now this country has 30% below normal death rate.  So where are all of these Covid-19 deaths coming from?

Are they woke?  No.  Do they know what it is?  Perhaps; but I think they&#39;re too busy perfecting that fried chicken dinner (it&#39;s number 14 on the menu, and best with coleslaw and green beans).<br /><br />I drink Cheerwine and Sundrop sodas because they are unique and most people outside of the Carolinas see them when I bring some to a party, but they do support local high-school football teams in the Carolinas, so there&#39;s that.   Are they woke though?   No.  Do they know what it is?  Maybe, but I kind of doubt it.<br /><br />I use Bic razors and Bic pens because they spend all of their energy making excellent razors and excellent ball-point pens for a reasonable price; and they don&#39;t bother telling me what I need to be to use their product.    Are they woke?  No, they don&#39;t have time for that shit.<br /><br />I have multiple cars of multiple brands, but I&#39;ve always been a Mopar fan; Dodge as a company, have you noticed?  You can&#39;t be &quot;Woke&quot; and make a car called the &quot;DEMON&quot; that comes from the factory with 808 horsepower or a crate engine called the &quot;HELLEPHANT&quot; that comes from the factory with 1007 horsepower.  The new consensus around the campfire is that all new modern cars will be all electric, and that they will all be equipped with bio-degradable wiring harnesses that last about 10 years and then need complete rewiring, and that you won&#39;t own it anyway.  Through all of that, Dodge has basically been saying, &quot;Yeah, about that, we didn&#39;t get that memo...&quot;   Are they woke?  Haha, they laugh at it.<br /><br />My cars ride on Kumho; they&#39;re owned and mostly made in South Korea and South Korea have been our friends through this whole debacle that has been what? the past 3, maybe 4 presidents? yeah, Kumho&#39;s are the best value for money right now.  They ride better than BadYear, they last longer than Michelin, and they&#39;re less expensive than Pirelli&#39;s.   Are they woke?  I doubt it; I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a Korean word for &quot;woke&quot;; so I suspect we&#39;re safe on that one, at least for now.  <br /><br />I shop at Ingle&#39;s markets for groceries because they were the company that gave me my first job as a teenager and taught me a thing or two about &quot;quality&quot;.   Are they woke?  Probably not; they&#39;re still listening to Hank Williams Sr., and any elevator music made after 1991 is &quot;Risque&quot; for them to play as overhead music, in their stores, so, no, I really doubt it.<br /><br />I bank at a small local bank that has a few branches and is big enough to provide real financial backing, but is small enough to actually give two shits about me; they are also the sort of company to advertise in the local high-school football program.<br /><br />I get my Auto Insurance from a big company that DOESN&#39;T ADVERTISE.  Auto-Owners Insurance Company, was once featured on a Clark Howard Investigative News special on ACTUAL responsiveness among claim holders; and was rated as FIRST and BEST; BEHIND State Farm which placed admittedly a close second, and then Farmers, then Allstate, then Liberty Mutual- The companies that advertised the most got nearly the worst rating when it came to claim payouts.  Geico ranked near the bottom, only beating Cotton States Insurance (which has recently been bought up by one of the big boys).  So Geico, yeah, 15 minutes could save you 15%, until you have an accident...    Is Auto-Owner&#39;s &quot;Woke&quot;?  I don&#39;t get that impression walking into their offices; my agent asks me how&#39;s my day been, and so on, and I get the impression they do that with everybody; so take that for whatever it may be worth.<br /><br />Forget a list of companies to avoid, let&#39;s start a list of companies to seek out.

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFp0tZFxWC8&amp;t=2m46s"">2:46</a> Ben defeats his whole argument by reading this quote. The businesses who refused to sign are involved in politics. Of course they are, they admit it themselves, we all know they lobby the government, this is common knowledge. The part that Ben is upset about is when they get involved in politics he disagrees with. His imaginary &quot;liberals wants businesses to influence our politics to push an agenda&quot; is moronic because businesses already influence our politics. Just admit that the only difference is that activists want the businesses to support something you don&#39;t like, and then actually argue why you don&#39;t like it.",Konkey,2021-04-21T18:53:04Z,0
"@Samuel Cvesski I have never once heard Ben Shapiro criticising corporate lobbying groups, the oil industry funding research to dismiss clean energy, libertarian think tanks, all examples of people with a clear agenda influencing the government. The only time he ever voices any kind of concern is when it&#39;s the people attempting to influence the government. What does that tell you about Ben&#39;s opinions?",Konkey,2021-04-21T21:21:01Z,0
"@Samuel Cvesski Ironically your position flies in the face of free market capitalism. We are meant to be able to sway corporations by &quot;voting with our dollar&quot;. Political activists threaten to not support businesses if they don&#39;t agree with their political stance, that is free market capitalism working as intended, that is the absolute ideal. The government wont listen to the citizens but they will listen to corporations, again, free market capitalism working as intended. So the only way for activists to change anything is to sway corporations. Even when activists play the game as it was intended they are demonised.",Konkey,2021-04-21T21:17:10Z,0
"@Samuel Cvesski That&#39;s a completely different position to Ben. He waxed poetic about journalists pushing corporations to be more involved in politics, and then immediately read a quote from a corporate PR division outright stating that they are already involved in politics. Of course Ben doesn&#39;t care about the politics that corporations are already involved in because they push for lower corporate tax, minimal government overreach in businesses, etc, things that do substantially effect all our lives like voting rights. But in those cases corporations and Ben agree, so he&#39;s fine with them being involved in politics. Activists attempting to leverage corporations to ensure their right to vote is secured, of course Ben draws the line there, because Republicans can only win when fewer people can vote.",Konkey,2021-04-21T21:14:09Z,0
"There&#39;s a difference between funding certain political groups and punishing people for thinking a certain way (i.e. the push for corporations to &quot;stand up&quot; against the Georgia voting bill which was democratically ruled). This is only gonna further the divide between the two sides of America, which is what Ben wants to prevent. I actually am entirely for this, since unlike communism when there&#39;s a void In the market in the US it&#39;ll be filled with new businesses. But hey maybe it&#39;ll be a repeat of Parler where the monopolies used their control to shut it down, but at that point I don&#39;t think they can call themselves the good guys.",Samuel Cvesski,2021-04-21T21:01:49Z,0

"Maybe we should think this one through first?<br />First of all what this boils down to is companies reacting and adapting in whatever way they think is in the best interest of their shareholders, which is the sole purpose of any corporation. It&#39;s basically capitalism doing what capitalism does.... and <i>that&#39;s</i> the hill you want to die on!?<br />But I&#39;m not done yet.... did you even catch what the democrats are pushing, or where you too busy frothing at the mouth because you heard the trigger word &quot;democrat&quot;? Yes, reducing voter suppression will help democrats more than republicans, so if you&#39;re into politics for the sole purpose of just winning political games, then by all means be against this and boycott Coke(good luck buddy).<br />However if you actually care about what is good for regular Americans you should absolutely support this, voter suppression is completely out of control in this country, if you don&#39;t believe me go to google right now and start comparing with other countries. <b>No other country is doing this bullshit, and they have zero problems with voter fraud.</b> In other countries you just grab any valid ID, usually your drivers licence or debit card, you go there and you vote, boom that&#39;s it. No registration, no sign ups, no &quot;special unique ID&quot; of course no one have to wait in long lines to vote. In addition in almost every other election day is a national holiday, so that people can&#39;t be prevented from voting because they had to be at work.<br /><b>Voter suppression has nothing to do with election security and everything to do with power and control, just like the goddamned gerrymandering.</b> If you can prove you are an American citizen, you are old enough and sober, there should not be a single authority in the country with the power to stop you from casting that vote.<br /><br />I have one more question though, whether or not <i>you</i> personally care about voter suppression... imagine how many that do when even gigantic international companies like Coke and B&amp;J are so afraid of been conceived to wrongly by the public on this. That should tell you that this is such a popular proposal among the people, that even if you personally don&#39;t agree...  I would advise against picking starting a boycott over something that has this much popular support in the people.",Salty Admiral,2021-04-20T04:44:05Z,0

"@Patricia Beninato My apologies for not knowing the  history of a company whose products I don&#39;t purchase, and that I haven&#39;t paid any attention to for over 25 years. That&#39;s the great thing about being ignorant of a fact, if you choose to, you can learn things. Rather than being two boomer hippies pandering to a clientele of willfully ignorant clowns, it&#39;s board chairman Anuradha Mittal, and CEO Matthew McCarthy. I now know who is responsible for the idiotic tweet, though it in no way diminishes the stupidity of said tweet. A stupid ideology is stupid, regardless of who embraces it. Anyone who agrees with the statement put out by Ben and Jerry&#39;s is stupid. The opening paragraph makes statements intended to be taken as facts, with zero evidence. <br /><br /> But rather than focus on the straw man argument of who the message is coming from, why not instead focus on the actual message? Point out how the accidental (listen to the bodycam audio and the officer says &quot;TAZER!&quot; multiple times) police shooting of a person who resisted arrest (the officer attempting to handcuff him was black) jumped in his car and drove off, is due to white supremacy, and the intentional criminalization of black and brown people, and not the intentional criminal act of a black individual. <br /><br />Was the officer negligent? As Wright had an outstanding warrant for choking a woman and robbing her at gunpoint, and tried to get back in his car, where it would be reasonable to suspect he may have had a gun, the officer&#39;s accidental use of her firearm rather than her tazer being a negligent act will be up to a jury to decide. Was Wright&#39;s death murder? Not according to MN statutes. <br /><br />Then maybe you can point out how to dismantle the system, a system that just so happens to have been run by Democrats since the late 1970&#39;s,  should be &quot;dismantled&quot; and what specific &quot;real system of public safety&quot; should replace it. <br /><br /><br />Or is it more fun to make statements pertaining to inconsequential details that you think are clever, but illustrate the reality that you have no actual argument that&#39;s based in fact or logic?",Papa Woody,2021-04-18T16:45:36Z,0

"&quot;Dante Wright shouldn&#39;t have been shot&quot; -- true.  And also, it was not &quot;White Supremacy&quot; that caused Dante Wright to commit aggravated assault in his failed attempt at armed robbery ($820 iirc) of someone (the host?) of a party he attended.  <br /><br />There is a good 2nd Amendment argument that Dante should not have been &quot;criminalized&quot; for simply having a gun.  But he opted to &quot;criminalize himself&quot; is brandishing it in a failed robbery attempt.  <br /><br />I am really getting tired of this narrative that the police are &quot;evil&quot; unless they just run away and let criminals do whatever it is that criminals want to do.  Generations of failed parenting combined with public education indoctrination have sabotaged perhaps 2 or more generations in their ability to detect a criminal mindset.  <br />They &quot;activate&quot; in support of it in many of these &quot;hate the police&quot; cases . . . because at some level (likely subconscious for now) they know that the exact same mindset of the criminals exists, largely unfettered, in them.  <br /><br />We all have this as part of our nature.  But good upbringing mitigates it to the point where it almost becomes a unconscious act to return the money if a cashier gives one too much change -- or actively look for the owner of the wallet you just found that has $450 in it.",griz063,2021-04-17T16:20:08Z,0

"I&#39;m a child of the 60&#39;s-70&#39;s so I&#39;m used to living in an atmosphere of discontent. We had the civil rights, women&#39;s rights, gay rights movements as well as protests against the war in Viet Nam. All worthy causes to march for and protest against. But the things that kids are protesting today seem a bit senseless and stupid as well is overtly violent. Instead of supporting our freedoms they look to take away our right to an opinion or to speak our own truths because they don&#39;t line up with popular culture. The kind of fear that was pervasive during the McCarthy era has leached into our consciousness and a modern day witch hunt has ensued with people losing their jobs because they refused to stand down from what they believe.

Retraining alone is not going to help these incidents-turned-to-killing situations. <br /><br />Tazers should NOT be placed DIRECTLY opposite the hip holster of a lethal weapon (dominant or weak side withstanding) - that eliminates the LIFE-changing errors/mistakes law enforcers could potentially make and turn an on the job routine into a deadly encounter.<br /><br />Tazer orientation (body placement) is also key, together with design elements. Tazers should be designed properly yet ergonomically as well. <br /><br />Tazers have to be redesigned to resemble closer to and held like a flash light - compact; NOT SHAPED and HELD like a firearm!! Plus it is a faster and safer deployment than a firearm!!<br /><br />Tazer orientation should be CAREFULLY considered to lessen &#39;mistakes&#39;; together with a compact design Tazers should have holsters directly under the body cam - by the abdomen area in an upright position (for ambidextrous reasons) and have auto safeties on if on the holster to prevent accidental self tazing.

"I took a ‚Äúside‚Äù 24 years ago when I was baptized.  The world will continue to destroy itself through gross sin, gross dishonesty, gross hypocrisy, and gross ignorance.  <br /><br />The only two individuals that want to dismantle the arm of our society that enforces the law ARE CRIMINALS AND THE GROSSLY IGNORANT- 1) people that are dishonest, who use violence and force to take from others what they did not earn, and 2) those that simply do not understand the role and scope of a police officer‚Äôs duties.  <br /><br />Our media today is sick, twisted, dishonest, and dangerous.  They are creating the news (fabricating and framing stories).  They are not reporting the known collective facts.  No, today they report only the side that will enrage the African-American, and that will push for contention amid the races, because it‚Äôs never a slow news day when there‚Äôs controversy.  Ratings = money.  It‚Äôs all about the money, and usurping more power for the Democrat/Socialist Party.  This nation is now occupied by a socialist-leading radical government that pretends to be about equality, masquerading as sympathizers of the trials of race from generations past.  They ignore the real data, and strain at nats while swallowing a camel.  The Democrat leaders are truly Godless individuals.  They worship mammon and serve only mammon because it‚Äôs all about themselves, seeking money, power, praise, and the spot light.  When they do occasionally speak of religion (like Pelosi will occasionally do), it is clear that they know very little on the subject, always hypocritically botch popular scriptures, and it is revealed that their hearts are so very far from Him.  <br /><br />Our nation has the cancer of self-worship, and it comes in many forms, perhaps none more popular than cancel culture, and endless cries of victimhood.   The have no understanding of who they are, and the parables are completely ignored or rejected, because they send a message of responsibility to increase through character and action, and for many today, those costs are too high.  <br /><br />People seem to be full of pride, certainly, but have you noticed the growing sin of envy?  The lust for wealth and riches, demanded by claiming inequality (of outcome).  They blame the past for their lack of riches, and instead of doing the things that could increase their earnings, they complain about unfairness and struggle, and demand everything for free, to take what they want from others, claiming that it is ‚Äúowed‚Äù.  <br /><br />And, what would they do with their unearned wealth?  They would only spend on things of no worth and which cannot satisfy.  So, they then would demand more.  <br /><br />Godless people that need to repent!  We all need to repent and turn our hearts and minds 100% back to the Lord!  A serious fall and destruction is coming.",Candymantempting 41,2021-04-16T15:22:31Z,0

"Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s has been Leftist for quite a while, or at least more openly Leftist.  The corporations that are pushing further Left are doing so with motivations other than the public good or even profit.

They are not tossing out money to &quot;Make the world a better place&quot; or &quot;Address injustice.&quot;",Jack Tribble,2021-04-16T14:53:27Z,1

"I still need to know what this system of public safety by disbanding the police looks like. I mean, no matter what you do criminals are still going to exist. They keep talking about social workers. Are they going to send social workers into an in-progress armed robbery? I live in NH and I like to bring up the story of Michael Briggs. He was an officer that was shot and killed about 16 years ago. I believe he was on patrol and he saw Michael Addison and apparently Addison was wanted at that time for committing a robbery. Briggs had no idea that police were looking for him, and merely for the fact that they knew each other, Briggs was calling out to Addison (maybe to check in with him?) and Addison turned around and shot him. There was no struggle, no chase. All Briggs did was call his name and Addison gunned him down. Another case a few years later involved police going to a home for a drug bust, it turned into a standoff, one officer was killed and I think 4 were injured. That was a situation where the officers were blamed, not because they escalated the situation, but because they went too late in the day (so not enough light) and the investigation concluded that they should have waited for more backup. Situations can flip in a second and even people who are seemingly &quot;safe&quot; can turn on you in a heartbeat. There was a traffic stop in one of our more northern towns years back and the officer ended up getting shot and killed. I don&#39;t remember as many of the details on that one because I was younger when it happened. The problem is that no matter the job, there will always be human error, but with police those errors can be fatal and situations are often blink of the eye and involve snap decisions.",ImAMajesticSeaHorse,2021-04-16T10:51:56Z,0

"@Reed Arnold What about my argument is incorrect?<br /><br />Are you saying that I&#39;m wrong that 2 men or 2 women cannot have kids?<br /><br />I didn&#39;t claim to be a rocket scientist when it comes to biology, I only stated what I objectively know to be true. <br /><br />As you didn&#39;t explain your point, I cannot be sure where you think I&#39;m wrong? <br /><br />I say that as someone who is gay myself so your accusation that I&#39;m a bigot is clearly wrong.<br /><br />Where are these 4 contradictions you claim are in my paragraph?<br /><br />What did I say that was hateful or misinformed? You could atleast have the courtesy to explain your points like I did.<br /><br />I&#39;m not a hateful person and my libertarian values dictate that I must be open to a fair and well rounded debate without canceling, deplatforming, dehumanizing or degrading anyone, so your claim there is also incorrect and merely based on speculation. <br /><br />I sincerely look forward to your reply Reed Arnold :)",sensible one,2021-04-26T22:59:52Z,0

"Contrary to MSM claims, many cases filed by Republicans and/or private plaintiffs in courts around the country were not &quot;lost.&quot;  In most cases the courts refused to even hear the evidence, or the cases were dismissed because of &quot;lack of standing.&quot;  No court had all the evidence because new data arose daily.<br />Let&#39;s look at the circumstances (and facts):<br />Sudden and sharp vote dumps for Biden in battleground states were systematically larger than other vote dumps that came into other states, making them especially crucial for swaying election outcomes in the respective states.<br />No sitting president in 132 years has ever gained votes between his first and second race and lost re election.<br />Trump won at least 11 million more votes in 2020 than in 2016, including the highest percentage of the non-white vote of any Republican candidate in 60 years (making significant gains among African-American, Latino, Jewish and even Muslim voters), yet allegedly lost.<br />Despite Biden allegedly receiving 15 million more votes than Obama did in his 2012 re-election, the democrats lost 13 house seats.<br />Biden under-performed Hillary Clinton&#39;s 2016 vote in every major metro area, yet somehow outperformed her in the major swing state cities of Milwaukee, Detroit, Atlanta and Philadelphia.<br />Biden also allegedly won despite having received a record low share of the Democrat primary vote; while Trump set a record for primary votes for an incumbent - 18 million primary votes, doubling the previous record, set by Bill Clinton.<br />Trump is one of only five incumbents to win more than 90% of the primary vote since 1912.<br />No incumbent who has received at least 75% of the primary vote total has ever, until 2020, lost re-election.<br />In Pennsylvania, only 19% of the vote additions favored Trump from November 4th through November 7th. Moreover, the integral of all vote update differences in this time range results in 578,014 votes for Biden‚Äîwith only 3,290 for Trump? ü§®<br /><br />McCandless precinct in Allegheny County, PA, had a ratio of 86 Democrat votes to every 14 Republican votes in 2020, but in 2016, the same county had 47 Democrat votes for every 53 Republican votes.  An obvious severe departure from statistical norms.<br />In Arizona, 22,093 mail-in ballots were &quot;received&quot; the day BEFORE they were mailed. ü§®<br />In AZ 33,400 illegal immigrants were estimated to have voted.<br />In Georgia, after the recount, the original numbers were used to certify the results, even though the recount had differing results.<br />Thousands of citizens filed affidavits under oath (under penalty of perjury) asserting irregularities and illegal activities in voting places.<br />A Georgia polling manager testified that stacks of hundreds of &quot;mail in&quot; ballots that were tallied, were on perfectly flat &quot;pristine&quot; paper that had never been folded. (If a ballot is really mailed, it has to be folded in two places to fit in the envelope). <br />Georgia&#39;s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, without legislative approval, unilaterally abrogated Georgia&#39;s statute governing the signature verification process for absentee ballots.<br />A sworn affidavit from mathematical analysis of the publicly available vote update data showed that: &quot;The repetition of the many different ratios transferring simultaneously across many different precincts located many miles from each other strongly demonstrates a clear, intentional, deliberate manipulation of the votes completed via software.&quot;<br />In Arizona, 2000 voters were &quot;registered&quot; to a vacant lot.<br />In the Antrim Michigan forensic report of the audit of Dominion Voting System tabulator machines software, it was found that someone had attempted to zero out all election results at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFp0tZFxWC8&amp;t=13h53m09s"">13:53:09</a> on Nov. 21st.  This is a clear and unchallenged example of direct tampering with evidence.<br />Arizona election law states that &quot;procedures shall allow party observers to effectively observe the election process.&quot;  But many Republicans were escorted from the building by election officials when they protested the illegal situation of not being allowed to effectively observe the process.<br />Lastly, the same party that told us the 2016 election was stolen by Russia, and warned us of election fraud by use of electronic voting systems, now says the integrity of this election was unsurpassed and that it is impossible to steal an election.<br /><br />&quot;The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.&quot; -Thomas Jefferson.<br /><br />If this election was compromised, and domestic and foreign interference altered the outcome, then the millions of voters and lawmakers all across the country peacefully calling for election integrity are courageous, patriotic AMERICANS simply calling for the truth we all deserve.  ü¶Ö",nostalkingzone,2021-04-21T23:37:47Z,6

"You can&#39;t on one hand say our institutions have been corrupted but then simultaneously say the kid was a criminal and communities are not criminalized with the proof of that being he was a criminal with a warrant. If the judicial system is being weaponized against people then that would mean it is expected... Let me preface the next part by saying essentially everything the left does and advocates for is null and void by default because their intentions for doing something are always separate from what they say they&#39;re doing it for.. With that being said, our judicial system needs HUGE reform. Our policing needs HUGE reform. I have experienced first hand the corruption infested within police departments. It&#39;s bad guys, it really is. Far too often, infinitely times more than could ever be considered an anomaly, a certain personality type that should be kept as far away from having power over others as possible, are ending up with that power in a police uniform. And this whole &quot;90% of cops are great it&#39;s just a few&quot; is complete bullshit. There are entire departments where the culture has just been corrupted beyond belief. Now there are also MANY great police officers who are there for the right reasons and do an honorable job, but the good cops tend to congregate with the good cops and the bad ones with the bad cops, and when the bad cops get to leadership the whole department rots. But one thing that remains universal is the good cops don&#39;t stop the bad cops. Unless you have a department led by someone like Sheriff Grady Judd. If he was the rule rather than the exception things would be a lot different. Unfortunately that&#39;s not the case... I guess if there&#39;s one thing I&#39;m trying to impart it&#39;s don&#39;t blindly take the stance of the Establishment Right or because it&#39;s in contrast with the stance of the left. You almost have to ignore the left on everything like they&#39;re the kids at the table. There is a great need for reform in policing especially hiring practices, but it&#39;s generally not for the specific reasons the left says and it&#39;s not where the left says it is. The loose canon power hungry cop isn&#39;t generally in the cities like the left portrays, people like that don&#39;t want to face the danger associated with the cities, and the cops that do work in the cities have far too much danger and stress to deal with as it is to be going around looking for crime or jamming people up. And conversely the problems in policing in the cities tends to be department policy and the bureaucratic nature of the way they deal with things. For example enforcing unconstitutional orders and acting as the muscle of a political party which in today&#39;s world is the Democrats.. We&#39;ve all seen what&#39;s behind the mask of the schools because of the teachers union and the Police Unions are no different. The larger portion of the population has kids so the teachers unions are in the public&#39;s view regularly, we just don&#39;t see Police Unions as often or the inner workings...

"You have to remember that <b>everything</b> is rooted in &quot;white supremacy&quot; according to the woke left. I once had someone argue that <b>black supremacy</b> was rooted in <b>white supremacy</b> because if white people hadn&#39;t thought of themselves as the supreme race then there would have never been any other races considering themselves superior. As though <b>all</b> white people had actually done this. I guess I didn&#39;t get the memo for the meet up to discuss this but I still have to somehow take the blame for this conclave that never actually took place haha. Most white people are not racist assholes. Most white people don&#39;t think of themselves as better than any other race. The few, in comparison to the vast majority, that do think of themselves in this way are actually outcasts, and are not really accepted by other white people. Trying to explain this to a member of the woke left and have them understand it is like asking the average three year old to spell pterodactyl correctly....it just ain&#39;t gonna happen.",xSam Waynex,2021-04-16T06:10:11Z,0

"we need police reform, to do that, you need to fund the police, and probably increase funding. ALso, I hate AOC, but on ABC, here is what she said regarding defunding. She said i will not make the police smaller, only take away military grade weapon. However, she is constantly changing her stance just to look like the good guy, so she probably, wants to make the police smaller also. But what do you guys think about taking away military grade weapons is that a bad idea yes or no. I see both sides, no because what happened at the capital, the police were underprepared, yes because the money saved can be used to fund for education, and ben said himself that black majority public schools suck because they don&#39;t receive a lot of funding.

"How do you arrive at &quot;shouldn&#39;t have been shot&quot;? The police know you have a warrant for illegal carry of a firearm and failing to appear in court, so there is a chance you are armed, and you fight out of being detained and go into your car where you could reach any number of hidden weapons. At that point you are taking your life into your own hands by putting the police in an undue high stress situation. There was ZERO reason for him to escalate that, the police weren&#39;t doing anything hostile or aggressive at that point, they weren&#39;t escalating the situation, he chose to make it a potentially deadly encounter and through the female cop&#39;s incompetence, he got his wish. It can take less than a second for someone to retrieve a hidden weapon from a vehicle and use it, we are judging officers on fractions of a second here, it&#39;s entirely possible her use of force could have been seen as necessary if it looked like he was reaching for something, but because she meant to deploy a taser and grabbed the wrong weapon it is being treated as excessive use of force. I don&#39;t think that is correct in any sense of it, she was trying to choose a lesser force option but given the circumstances could be seen as within her right to deploy as much force as she did. I guess while we are on the subject, this is what you get with diversity hires, you hire people who really aren&#39;t cut out for that profession, just because you need some of whatever group they&#39;re from, on the force to satisfy some quotas, or they lower standards to let more people in.",hzuiel,2021-04-16T05:00:23Z,1

"This will probably be an unpopular opinion on your video, but I would like to play detached third party. I‚Äôm a white guy born and raised in Canada. I have been on both sides of needing the police, and running on the wrong side of them. The wrong side has always been traffic related. Speeding, not coming to a complete stop at a sign, etc. I was often pulled over just for driving at night when I was young after the cop ran my plate, even though everything was clean. On the other side, I have been the victim of armed robbery twice. I was a delivery driver. Pistol, and sawed off shotgun being the tools of choice if it matters to anyone. My point may have three points... 1). The police should use a reasonable response to the infraction. For example, don‚Äôt draw your gun on someone over a speeding ticket. 2). The police shouldn‚Äôt assume anyone doing something they consider abnormal is a hardcore criminal. I certainly never was. 3). In the case of George Floyd, even if he was as disreputable as could appear, I cannot imagine a circumstance where a cop needs to crush him down with a knee for 8 minuets. It might take one minute of that before the guy is so winded you can cuff him and shove him in the patrol car. 4). One more point than I said, but it bears mention... I don‚Äôt like the Woke movement. The issue should never be race or colour. It should be about reasonable police response to an individual‚Äôs actions or infraction. If we could get there, I think the race war would die a nice, slow, non partisan death.",Mike Stashko,2021-04-16T02:29:43Z,0

"The police force isn&#39;t perfect, but &quot;dismantled&quot; is a huge leap. I&#39;m not a citizen of the US and don&#39;t know your police force, in my country policemen make people more nervous than anything, they are often colluded with criminals. However, the recent incidents that have made it to the media about your police force are more about proper training, the last case of the police woman shooting a black person, she clearly shot by accident. Better training seems necessary, also big cities could benefit from special teams specifically trained to specific types of crimes. For example a police team specialized in robbery, other specialized in domestic violence, etc. This of course means a higher investment in your police forces. Dismantling them is just a recipe for disaster.",Enna Aiz,2021-04-16T01:23:53Z,1

"Fascism/Corporatism: definition of:  A: The merging of government and industry. B: a conspiracy between corporations and government. Objective: usurp the constitution of the United States. Method: Use corporations to legally do what is illegal for government to do. Example: Being corporations are private entities they can refuse products and services to anyone for any or no reason at the behest of the government. To use services one must comply with  government mandates that are illegal for government to enforce. Government in turn will make laws and allow favors for the corporations--- (corporate welfare, special considerations and requests). Government uses corporations via conglomerate monopoly against the people, corporations use government against the people. Government becomes a weapon of the rich against the public.

"The companies involved in this silliness all seem to be massive (crony) corporations who mostly operate on branding and advertising (and sugar addiction) to maximise profit rather than providing a high quality product.<br /><br />As has been commented on plenty here already most people&#39;s health would greatly improve by eliminating these products from their diet. The world would be greatly improved by eliminating the types of companies from the economy. They are branding based frauds crowding out the market from better, cheaper, genuinely ethical brands and products. That is of course mostly because people choose to buy them. Marketing is very effective amongst us twerps. Thankfully these companies are doing their best to help us extracate our lazy arses from their grip.<br /><br />All this seems terrible and we are destined for ruin. May be true but I hope the rebound will be glorious and before we are ruined. (maybe we need to be ruined first followed by a few centuries of depravity.

@corey williams the fallacy in your argument... the corporate tax vs certain corporations. One encompasses all while the latter is target. When you promote legislation  that affects all corporations and potentially cause them to leave there will not be another building up to take its spot in the economy. While the latter does not demote the establishment of new corporations to take its place rather may promote  the new companies to take a less political stance. Isn&#39;t that what we want? For corporations to stay out of politics(ie. Lobbying).,Kim Yip,2021-04-16T14:04:40Z,2

"I do not hire based on an applicant&#39;s politics since it is illegal to do so. My politics and that of my employees is private and personal to be exercised at the ballot box. I speak for my company but I would never presume to speak for the political beliefs of my employees, that is their right, not mine. Nor will I pressure them in any way to conform to an ideology or vote a certain party, that is no different than being threatened, harassed or bribed at the polling place on election day. I can, however, have a personal opinion on how a piece of legislation, an individual or a party policy may threaten their jobs, their right to work or the profitability of the company. You know, like calling out Stacey Abrams for the corrupt, lying, power hungry skank she is. That would be my right and obligation to do since neither she, her party or the media will be honest with the voters.",John Kidd,2021-04-15T23:46:05Z,0

No, police are in fact not racist, and this latest incident had NOTHING to do with race. Absolutely nothing at all, and anyone who says otherwise is in fact a liar. That&#39;s not opinion, that&#39;s fact. How do I know? Because neither of the cops mention race in the interaction. The female cop doesn&#39;t say &quot;I&#39;m gonna shoot this black guy&quot;, or anything even remotely to that effect. What she does say is &quot;oh my god I shot him&quot; then proceeds to freak out, which shows undeniably that it was not premeditated, or even spontaneous, but was in fact an accident. If it wasn&#39;t an accident, and she didn&#39;t care because he was black, she wouldn&#39;t be freaking out about it.

No bread, no wine, no processed sugars (no ice cream, no pizza, no chips).  Lots of tap water and tea. A protein drink in between meals if I ever feel hungry; else an energy bar. Caesar Salads with cheese &amp; chicken, salad with salmon, cottage cheese, STEAK, hamburger without bun (no fries), some low carb veggies, nuts. Sashimi instead of Sushi.

"Another disingenuous argument from a guy who takes Dave Rubin and Prager U seriously. The Georgia voting changes are not only about providing voter ID , there are provisions made to decrease voter turnout in Democrat heavy areas, its a fact. In every other country, citizens have National IDs which are provided easily and cheaply. Everyone has to have one. Why do you think in the US that there is no universal ID? Why are elections not held on a weekend or made a National Holiday? Republicans know that if turnouts are big, they will lose. Democrats have done a horrible job and base their elections on how douchey Republicans can be.  It&#39;s a vicious cycle where everyone loses. Why not make it as easy and secure to vote as it is to bank online. The answer is that Republicans don&#39;t want that, they want low turnouts in Democrat areas, the jerrymandering and lack of ballet boxes and short voting hours confirm it. If you agree with these tactics than you should just admit you don&#39;t believe in Democracy, you just want your side to win.",Joseph Fernandez,2021-04-15T22:49:30Z,0

So democrats are pushing for voting to be allowed with out people needing to legally identify who they are and where they live. In my opinion and many others, it&#39;s racist to claim that blacks and browns are unable to do legal adult things.

"&gt;The ownership of Dr Pepper is a long and complex one. In the US, the company was owned by Dr Pepper Snapple Group, which purchased Dr Pepper in 1995. Internationally it was owned by its competitors. The Coca-Cola Company owns the rights to Dr Pepper in Europe while PepsiCo the rights in Poland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.<br />So sayeth the runes from the magic engine that queried millions of separate databases to arrive upon this knowledge.  I think Coke is Dr Peppers distributor so they probably make $ every time you drink a Dr Pepper they&#39;re not going to do it for free.",John Galt,2021-04-15T23:17:15Z,0
