"it&#39;s taking TOOO long to get to Steven Co-bert<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />....... he used is &quot;Investigative Journalism&quot;  and had some JOKE about how the Tariffs on Mexico would &quot;RUIN Summer&quot;<br /><br /><br />and then showed some chart with &quot;things from Mexico&quot; .... beer was # 1 on the list .... <br /><br /><br /><br />I mention this cuz  MSNBC used that Half @ $ $   chart as LEGITIMATE information and USED it in their &quot;news&quot;<br /><br /><br />now it&#39;s BAD enough that MSNBC used that clip from Steven COLT-bear ... BUT when you think of BEER here in America for say the 4th of July ... do you think of XX (dos Exes) or Corona .... OR you you think about drinking an AMERICAN beer like BUD, Coors, Miller, and my Favorite Sam Adams? <br /><br /><br /><br />now I wrote this with OUT fact checking (just like MSNBC)  so please tell me the NUMBERS for the Summer Sales in the past few years comparing ALL beers sold in America",Dosily Smith,2019-06-10T17:35:13Z,1

less then 13% of ALL beer sales in AMERICA are Imported .... now go and divide that number even farther ... only about 2/3rds are those 13% are from Mexico .... so about 8% of ALL beer sold in America is from MEXICO ....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />so if NO &quot;cerveca&quot; even shows up here in America (or is So expensive that no one wants to purchase it)<br /><br /><br />your &quot;Summer will NOT be Ruined&quot;,Dosily Smith,2019-06-10T17:50:44Z,1

"Do you know Sulu from Star Trek?  As a child he was sent to an internment camp with his family.  So a WHOLE lot of people actually know a living human who was wronged by this decision made in the 1940&#39;s by our government.  But I have a more difficult question to ask so I will give you as much time as you need to answer.  Can anyone name an enslaved American that is alive today? The last person that was the GRANDAUGHTER of a slave died in 2015 at the supposed age of 116 years old.  So by definition is would seem that the closest we can come to a living descendent of a slave would likely be a great, great, grandchild of a slave at the very best. <br /><br />That is the difference between Japanese reparations vs. slavery reparations.  There are still LIVING Americans that suffered from the internment of Japanese Americans.  As far as African slaves none survive, no children survive, no grand children survive, and no great grand children survive.  Unquestionably horrific things happened to African peoples in America 155 years ago under slavery.  And yes crimes continued for a long time after in the form of people that were cruel and sometimes evil.  Jim Crow laws that were both cruel AND evil.  <br /><br />Horrific things happened to the Jews, Armenians, and Bosnian people to name a few in the last 50 to 100 years.  But how can you make reparations to the great great great grandchildren of the oppressed by having the great great great grandchildren who were not likely even descendants of the oppressors pay them?  Perhaps we all need to move forward together and, while not forgetting past injustices, heal by being the people that Martin Luther King Jr envisioned.

"Not saying that I agree with reparations, but Ben is intelligent enough to know it is disingenuous to tacitly imply that the end of slavery in 1865 was the end of systemic discrimination against African Americans. Everyone who watches this show is probably interested enough in history to know about Jim Crow, segregation, etc. Kind of a cheap half-truth out of Ben on that point.",Christian Clark,2019-06-04T21:46:37Z,0
@N H It&#39;s basically lying through omission. It makes it sound as if as soon as slavery ended African Americans had the level of equality they do today. They were almost slave level for another what... 50 years? At least. And then second class/legally discriminated against for another 60 past that. Where I live now they didn&#39;t desegregate schools until 1968. It&#39;s certainly not a steel man of the argument that&#39;s for certain. I lose respect for Ben when he goes for cheap points like that.,Christian Clark,2019-06-05T01:21:19Z,0

She probably just resorted to the most offense thing she could think of in the moment because of her frustration.<br />She then apologized, and said she didn&#39;t mean it, he stayed upset and didn&#39;t accept the apology and told her off. He made sure to record it too for SJW points.<br />Turns out he upset a bunch of trannies in the same way she upset him. He didn&#39;t accept her apology, the trans people shouldn&#39;t accept him.

The point is that she apologized for it, she probably feels terrible about it after the fact. Maybe, maybe not, I&#39;m speculating. Like is said, is she a racist? Maybe. None of us know her well enough to know she is. Spouting the &quot;forbidden word&quot; in a fit of rage doesnt define someone&#39;s core belief system. Racism is more than a word, it&#39;s more than a joke or off the cuff remark, it&#39;s more than a fit of rage.
