"I do agree with Ben, the final say is once all votes are counted and legal proceedings complete. However, I think you&#39;re talking about 2 different projections with Hilary and Biden. Hilary was poll projections, which is basically random phone calls of a sample population. This tends to be accurate but not always like 2016.<br /><br />The media projection for Biden which called him the winner of the Presidency is just basic math. This projection is based on real votes, that were actually processed, with a count of remaining votes, and projections on which counties are remaining and how they&#39;ve voted. You get a much more accurate picture then poll projections.<br /><br />Also, tell me this, in recent history, in the last 50 years, have media projections from real counted votes been wrong? Was there a case where after election night and the vote counts came in, the media called it and we ended up swearing in a different President come January? I can&#39;t recall of any such case.",Hugh,2020-11-11T04:39:06Z,0

It was deliberate and intentional to prevent Trump reclaiming office. <br /><br />In the meantime, algorithms sent us Ben Shapiro. As a foreigner he sounds okay. Talks way too fast. <br /><br />But you have been deadly silent for over a week. <br /><br />He is a patsy. A shill. An opportunist. Who remarkably shares some conservative values...but will bay with the wind of whomever is popular. <br /><br />Not worth listening to anymore. You have no place in credible news media Shapiro because you are yellow. A coward. A weakling. A five year old could roll you in a debate.

I usually watch your videos to gain some perspective but here lately you sound just like the people you criticize. Whining, yelling, and making assumptions makes it hard to take you seriously.  Obama hasn’t been president for four years. Trump hasn’t exactly had a good run either It would be nice( wishful thinking) if you held are current president and both parties accountable.

Our president is jumping to conclusions about the election before an investigation takes place. He actually claimed he won, before the counts were over. <br />Nothing wrong with taking this to court, but what is happening here goes way beyond that.

But, can any of you supporters please call him out (and I don&#39;t mean in a pansy way that you and others do).  While I can support Trump policies, I detest him as a human being, father, business owner, and overall as a person.  If you believe, or anybody else believes, that Trump should be the leader of our country, then shame on you.  There are better Americans.  And while those &quot;better Americans&quot; might be a limited list of choices, you and other conservatives should insist on a better option.

"The liberal agenda is apparent. They have employed the tactic that was used by the Comanches to gain absolute dominion over wild horses. “A Comanche would lasso a wild horse, then tighten the noose, chocking the horse and driving it to the ground. When it seemed as if the horse were nearly dead, the chocking lariat was slacked. The horse finally rose, trembling and in a full lather. Its captors gently stroked its nose, ears, and forehead, then put his mouth over the horse’s nostrils and blew air into its nose. The Indian would then throw a thong around the now gentled horse’s lowered jaw, mount up, and ride away.-end of quote. from Empire of the Summer Moon, by S.C. Gwynne<br /><br />The liberal democrat party and media have done the same to us. They have put the Coronavirus noose around the Wild American spirit, then tightened the noose, chocking the country to the ground. We are nearly dead with fear. Cancelling even Thanksgiving and Christmas. Expect Uncle Joe to loosen the noose, gently stroke his captors and breath into them the godless liberal democratic ideology, put a thong in your lower jaw, mount you and ride away. <br /><br />It did not work on those of us who have the Spirit of God. They will need to do something different with us. If God be for us, who can be against us. AOC suggests Lists. Jake Tapper would scare us with not being employable.

"Makes perfect sense &quot;This is going to the Supreme Court. Where they will rule that the election is invalid due to fraud or mistakes on a countrywide scale.  It will go one of two ways, either they will rule that all the unconstitutional mail-in ballots will be removed and the states ordered to recount without them or they will simply rule the election is invalid due to mass voter fraud and at that point, it will be sent to the congress and senate for a vote. This is where it gets good. The house/  congress votes on who the President will be. It has nothing to do with what party has power. Every state gets one vote and 30 States are held by Republicans.and 19 by Democrats. They have to vote down party lines,  they have no choice due to the 12th Amendment of the Constitution, and the Senate votes for the Vice President where a similar event will take place.  This is The law.  This is why the Democrats are so mad at Nancy  Pelosi. This will all happen in January. The only way President Trump won’t be President is if he concedes the election and that will never happen   So stop watching the fake news and don’t let your heart be troubled and live your life knowing this will all work out. President  Trump will remain President   I have researched all of this and it is  Fact! Another fun fact, they called Gore the President-Elect for 30 days in 2000  until the courts ruled against him and declared Bush the winner. And two people that were part of that decision were none other than new Supreme  Court Justices, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett. Why do you think the Democrats tried so hard to keep them from being confirmed&quot;.  Here is another great comment: &quot;Taken from a friend&#39;s post...<br /><br />Ok....let me clearly explain what’s going on. I have an unfriend button that you are more than welcome<br />to click btw because this is going to make many of you extremely angry (which is fine &amp; will prove this post anyway) <br />I am in shock right now by so many of you celebrating as if Biden has won. It makes me sad that you are so extremely uneducated in American law. But it’s not just Dems...Republicans are flipping out as well. Guys! Learn our LAW.<br />I just got off the phone with my cousin, Brett Farley. (many of you know him) Brett has a Masters in Government and a Ph.D. in Political Theory. He was also in the leadership of 2 presidential campaigns and was recruited by the Trump campaign in 2016 to help lead the primary operation. This isn’t something I am copying and pasting or sharing. This is 💯 factual.<br />🛑1st...the winner of the President is not official until the electoral college meets and casts their votes. Until that happens, it is not final....regardless of what the MEDIA tells you. Every single one of you on FB is getting your info from the media. Think that through! The electoral college can’t decide anything because there are lawsuits and the court proceedings must take place first.<br />🛑2nd...Court proceedings are GUARANTEED to happen in Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, and possibly Nevada and Arizona. But as of now, they are GUARANTEED to happen in those 4 states. The SCOTUS won’t allow any litigation to proceed beyond inauguration because that would be a constitutional crisis. So they’ll make quick decisions. This is not a conspiracy theory or something to fact check. BTW....fact check is being sued as well. This is FACTS.<br />🛑3rd...The Supreme Court is already reviewing the ballots in Pennsylvania so we know AT LEAST Pennsylvania will be handled by the Supreme Court. (thank God for Amy Coney Barrett and p.s...Trump knew this was coming &amp; is why he pushed so hard to get her confirmed before the election, and also why the Dems pushed so hard to NOT have her confirmed)<br />With the facts stated above, there has been no president elected. Also, after Trump gets finished exposing and retaking the election, he will then deal with the media. The media will never be the same when he is finished. This isn’t about Republicans or Democrats. This is about the single worst fraudulent election in the history of our great nation and for that to not terrify every single one of you is beyond me!!! It has corrupted our entire voting system. It has already been proven that there was fraud. Again...this is factual. <br />This isn’t about being a sore loser. The Republicans dealt with Obama for 8 years. We may not have been happy, (just like many weren’t in 2016) but it was FAIR and done correctly through our voting system. If you are serious about how the system works then this is how it works! <br />I am also not sharing this to be “high and mighty” or “always right” or not “compassionate”, which are things I’ve been called in the last few weeks on social media. I am sharing this because I DO have the facts and this IS how our legal system works.<br />Now...I can also guarantee (with almost 99% certainty) that when Trump does succeed we will have a civil war. The Democrats started the Civil War in 1861. Again, that is factual....not an opinion as far as who started it. It is simply my personal OPINION about this country having another civil war when all this goes down. Cities will burn and our country will never be the same. The media and Biden will come out and say “Trump is a horrible man”, “Trump couldn’t stand to lose” etc etc and just as you have already been blindsided and brainwashed, you will again jump to rioting and burning down cities. It is terrifying to think I may have to remove my American Flag, religious figures, and conservative signs from the outside of my home and vehicle just to make sure I am not attacked, robbed, or vandalized. These things WILL happen. It’s a disgrace. However, it won’t happen for long! Trump will send out the National Guard and it will stop. <br />AGAIN....this is not my opinion or false information.<br />Many of you know the strong political and military ties my family has. Many of you know the million-dollar price issued on Steven Farley’s head when he was sent by President Bush to help the Iraq government build their system back the American way. They succeeded in killing him. My point in adding that in is to possibly get many of you to understand that this is all factual information. (you can google “Steven Farley Iraq” and all of his story comes up. This is my immediate family. Again....not something I am just theorizing.<br />Save my post!

The Man bringing US troops home, doesn’t care about our Military The Man who fixed the VA thinks people wounded or killed in battle, are &quot;losers and suckers&quot;.The Man who increased funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, is a Racist The Man who created Opportunity Zones to revitalize distressed inner-city communities, hates minorities.The Man who champions School Choice, hates the poor. The Man who presided over the largest increase in low and middle-income workers’ earnings in decades, only cares about the rich The Man whose policies helped lift millions of minorities out of poverty is, yes, a Racist The Man who created millions of low- and middle-income jobs, (prior to COVID), does not care about working people. That the Man who saw his net worth go down while in Office – the first in history to do so - only took the job to enrich himself and his Family.The Man who doesn&#39;t take a salary as President, only cares about himself The Man who instituted prison reform and criminal justice reform is a Racist. The Man who had a record number of small donations to his Campaign is owned by Wall Street and the Billionaire Elite.The Man who began closing the Wealth Gap is only in it for his own financial gain. The Man who became the first President to appoint an openly gay person to his Cabinet, is homophobic. The Man who held Communist China to account, was wrong to do so.The Man that created more favorable Trade Deals, to help the US Worker, is dumb The Man who attempts to enforce existing laws, is a dictator. The Man that banned travel to-and-from China in Jan, 2020, was a “Racist and Xenophobe” for doing so The Man who followed the Constitution and allowed the States to create their own Coronavirus Policies – and then provided them everything they needed – is to blame for all Coronavirus deaths. The Man who created the strongest US economy in history – and now has the economy back to just 6.9% unemployment - is not capable of leading us out of the COVID Recession The Man who told his supporters to “vote in person”, to avoid possible cheating, is trying to steal the election. The Man that has been investigated more than any other President in history, is a crook The Man who has been the most transparent President in history, has not been straight with the American people The List goes on....This is what “THEY” want you to believe Don’t act like sheep.

A part of this speech is in regards to the first thing he plans to do and that is a nationwide mask mandate....<br />For months now we have been told non-stop that Trump absolutely failed everyone in the country regarding COVID and that he didn&#39;t do enough or take action soon enough.<br />We have also been told literally since Trump got elected what a terrible fascist he is that thinks and acts more like a dictator than the President of the US. <br /><br />So, let&#39;s now think about all these points and try to put them together just to see if we are all on the same page and fully understand this....<br /><br />Trump was the absolute worst thing to happen to America because he was basically just a fascist dictator. Trump also failed regarding covid by not doing enough fast enough and is thus responsible for every person who&#39;s death has been counted as a covid death. Joe Biden on the other hand will save lives and &#39;shut down the virus&quot; and his very first action will be a nationwide mask mandate. So Biden is the President we need and would have handled covid better than Trump ever could have hoped too.<br /><br />Alright, so Trump = bad fascist dictator because he followed what the constitution says a President can and can&#39;t do, and left the power of what to do and how to handle covid to the states.<br />Biden = best hope for America because he &quot;listens to the science&quot; and is going to force the entirety of the country to wear masks anywhere and everywhere at all times, even though that&#39;s in direct violation of his constitutional authority. <br /><br />Now I know 2020 has felt like a year long real life Twilght Zone episode, but even so, Biden sounds a whole hell of a lot more like a fascistic dictator already (and he isn&#39;t even the actual president elect yet) than anything Trump has ever in the last 4 years...",sinare -,2020-11-10T13:35:33Z,0

But, as soon as it was election time (in my country), all the rules were gone like smoke.<br /><br />And to make things &#39;better&#39;, a few months later we had a political scandal with many of the top politicians being exposed for visiting an exclusive &#39;&#39;club&#39;&#39; during the strictest lockdown period. What happened in the club? Oh, the usual. There was booze, possibly drugs, elite hookers, and shady business dealings.

"Shapiro will stand on the beach when the massive meteor&#39;s heading towards earth saying &quot;Yes, we&#39;ll probably all going to be destroyed and it&#39;s the end of the world, BUT it&#39;s not over until the meteor has hit and maybe the sensors are wrong or an alien will shoot it with a big laser so technically, we can&#39;t say it&#39;s the end of the world, so I have to concede nothing. I&#39;ve got the next couple of months to subtly pivot my position so the news narrative changes and everything forgets every crappy thing I&#39;ve been an apologist for and I can crawl back under my rock, except that I&#39;m happy under my rock because all of my like minded people are in my echo chamber with me&quot;.   Sure Biden will probably be crappy, but he can&#39;t do that much damage in 4 years and what he does is the Republican&#39;s fault - if America hadn&#39;t let such a terrible man be President, drop the bar of decency and professionalism so low, we&#39;d not be an ashamed nation.  Right now, the country needs a Republican President and Biden&#39;s not a good choice for president - those are the two reasons why Trump did better than expected...but it&#39;s because he&#39;s Trump that he lost - in any reasonable prediction, even if the ink hasn&#39;t actually been set.",jacklewis100,2020-11-10T09:22:22Z,3

That media is as polarised as the people and provides the echo chamber that suits its audience - sure that&#39;s true, and was probably always so but the most egregious and disingenuous is Fox News, and also commentators like Shapiro who repeat quotes from like minded people as if their gravitas somehow makes a falsehood &#39;more true&#39;.  Quoting another partisan person isn&#39;t evidence.      Actually, I don&#39;t think the picture the anti-trump media has painted of him is particularly harsh - I read all types - for example here and Trumps supporters tend not to even bother defending him.  They have made whataboutism a national sport, and will shift the topic onto their agenda rather than defend the indefensible.

"The leaders of the world does not always and will not represent the wills and opinion of their people. I, for one, am from Singapore and I regretted my country&#39;s leaders had called in early but I do strongly believe strongly the truth will prevail.<br /><br />I had followed news of President Trump since he was elected in 2016 till today. At first, I was skeptical when he was elected in 2016. However, through in-depth understanding from my friends in America and whether it is from the news in mainstream media or free media, I use my own intellect to differentiate what is right and what is wrong. I regretted that my views of him in 2016 was wrong. Truth is, America had a great leader, a leader who walk the talk, a leader who Americans are proud of and a leader who is going to lead not only America but the whole world to new heights of stability and progrssion in the NEXT 4 Years. <br /><br />So I hope and I pray,  from the bottom of my heart, that President Trump will prevail from this trying times with the support, actions, prayers of the people of this great nation and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!!!

"Given the voting software used in this election (such as Dominion), and how easy it would be to program &quot;glitches&quot;--as for example, using available databases of state voter registration rolls, death statistics, etc., to create a warping of the numbers in any of the state elections--it is not only misleading, but downright foolish to claim that there is &quot;no way&quot; that fraud could have occurred on a broad scale! Even for those states that provide &quot;tracking&quot; for your vote, what do we really know? I&#39;m in California, and when I tracked my vote online, it simply said that my vote had been &quot;counted.&quot; It did not provide details of what, exactly, was counted. I&#39;m not necessarily saying that my vote was tampered with (that seems unlikely). What I am saying is that NO ONE in this country actually knows with any degree of certainty that their vote--as they actually voted--was tabulated into the totals that we are regularly seeing on our computer and TV screens. Are we really that gullible as to believe that all the anomalies reported in the states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and Nevada (surprisingly enough, all swing states, and all the problems involving democratic-dominated cities and regions) are simply smoke and mirrors? Are we really willing to simply agree that Biden and Harris won in the face of all these claims of &quot;irregularities&quot;? Are we simply supposed to &quot;make nice&quot; without the truth being brought to light? Are we simply going to ignore the incredible contrast between all the Trump rallies and the Biden picnics (on those days that he managed to emerge from the basement) BEFORE the election? Come on, man! The voter systems and  processes (including the voter software!) we used in the various states in this country are certainly NOT foolproof or beyond hacking--especially if the hacking is happening from insiders to the software development itself. Serious investigations should be conducted regarding Dominion and any other software companies whose software had &quot;glitches.&quot; In addition, the DOJ should investigate how these particular software companies won the contracts they did in order to be employed in this year&#39;s election, and what kinds of nefarious connections there might be between those software company executives and those responsible for making the decisions as to which software was to be used on a state-by-state basis. In addition, the DOJ should investigate anyone in positions of power and responsibility in the national or state political arenas--Democrat or Republican--who has financial, organizational, or personal ties to these software companies.",Robert Brown,2020-11-10T03:04:24Z,0

Do not concede ! In Michigan Trump votes changed to Biden votes . Pennsylvania poll watchers not allowed to watch ballots to be counted . I believe that is enough for a recount of the whole election if you want to be fair about it . Everyone should vote in person with a person counting and a poll watcher from each side observing count . That way there is no fraud and we have a fair election . I believe if that were the case Trump would not only win but it would be a landslide victory . Democrats can claim victory all they want but until we redo the election because of the problems and blatant hiding of counting ballots this election is null and void . Also any Republican who doesn&#39;t support that does not support fair elections only the ones in their favor !,John Doe,2020-11-10T01:58:16Z,0

"For almost 4 years Democrats falsely accused President Trump of being a racist and called anyone who supported him a racist.  They are gender transitioning children, sexualizing children, just made meth, cocaine and heroin legal in Oregon.  California can take your daughter out of high school and give her an assisted abortion and not notify the parents. They support full term abortions, teach people they are oppressed because of a gender, color, or sexual preference.  Then after our country being almost 30 trillion in debt they want free healthcare, child care, college, food stamps, free housing.  Then after being in the greatest coubtry in the world you spit on it by kneeling.  You Democrats are disgusting people and stealing this election is the end.

"We all want justice and equity and that is because we were created in the image and likeness of God and God is righteous and all His ways are right but we have sin and rebelled against God.  We have a conscience and we know right from wrong but choose to do wrong when we lie, steal, fornicate, are proud, selfish, hate etc... We all have broken the law of God and God is just to punish us all but in His love and mercy He sent down His only begotten Son Jesus Christ the Righteous and Savior to die on the cross for our sins and in our place that we be not condemned and then He was resurrected on the third day and is sitting at the right hand of God,  We have to repent of our evil ways and turn to God and put our faith in Jesus for our salvation, because there is no other name given among men that people may be saved.  Our good works cannot save us because we have sinned and we will be judged on our sins not our good works, only Jesus can save us from our sins",Gio Silva,2020-11-10T00:40:16Z,1

Even though you have openly questioned whether Trump had a special ingredient for his political success you still felt that he was a fool.  Well now the desperation in your voice to critizise Biden is just plain  infuriating. I dont know if for sake of being objective, Trump was the butt of your jokes on so many occasions or simply because you are an in the closet never trumper, but either way failed to move the needle in any direction. If for the more sinister theory that you desired Trump to lose so that the media pickings are more juicy, then that makes you no better than the fake news.  But no Ben i do believe in your high moral aptitude. I dont mean that in any condescending way, I just dont know why you couldnt do more to support our current president.

"Does anyone who was a fan of Ben Shapiro circa 2015-2017 now find him somewhat insufferable today in 2020? I just don&#39;t find him nor his platform as appealing since he&#39;s clearly hobnobbing with the actual white house administration and other republican officials e.g. Ted Cruz. Of course the Daily Wire is an openly conservative outlet, but I thought he was objective enough to where this didn&#39;t interfere with his broader reporting and viewpoint on matters in Washington. However, I find his current and open associations with this administration have reduced credence in his message where he can&#39;t in good faith call balls and strikes. Ben was much more receptive to doing the &quot;put the shoe on the other foot test&quot; for assessing actions in Washington, but I haven&#39;t heard him do that in a while. It&#39;s tantamount to CNN where Ben is Jake Tapper who sometimes is fair in his reporting but other hacks on the network (Don Lemon, Cuomo, etc.) are openly partisan which does affect their reporting to a great extent (compare to Klavan, Knowles, etc). Could potentially be a reason that subscriber counts of each individual channel have a huge disparity: Ben’s at 2+ million while the other two are both well below 500K",M J,2020-11-10T00:14:02Z,0

There are numerous affidavits being signed about usps conversations to back date ballots, out of state vehicles showing up with thousands of ballots in the middle of the night.

"When biden calls for unity....he&#39;s saying everyone needs to stop the idiotic pissing contests that fixate on our many differences, which group of people is getting the best deal, and whether or not everyone else is subscribing to our individual sense of morality. <br /><br />Trump actively sought to destroy all confidence in the democratic process by spouting bullshit claims about mail in ballots, something that have been part of every election for decades and go through a rigorous verification process before being counted, in a desperate attempt to stop people who wouldn&#39;t vote for him from voting at all. His campaign has made numerous complaints about voter fraud, devoid of any evidence, which have subsequently been thrown out. He wants votes for him to be counted, and every other vote to be ignored to the extent that his supporters have gathered outside counting stations to demand that counting be stopped in places that he&#39;s winning, while demanding counts be continued in places he&#39;s losing. <br /><br />He&#39;s spent 4 years praising media outlets that spread and support his propaganda, while denouncing any that hold him accountable for his constant spread of disinformation and lies. That&#39;s not even a matter of political ideology, it&#39;s a matter of seeing video recording of his speeches only to have him deny having said it the next day, before circling back to saying again what he previously denied. While the ignorant masses take everything he says at face value because they don&#39;t have an attention span that allows them to recall anything not said in the past 5 minutes or because he&#39;s explained it away as some grand conspiracy of &quot;FAKE NEWS&quot; Obviously the simpler explanation is a grand global conspiracy, not the fact that he&#39;s a compulsive liar who has a decades long history of screwing over everyone for his own personal gain. <br /><br />Blindly supporting the president just because he&#39;s the president doesn&#39;t make you a patriot, it makes you a fool.

"Ben I appreciate so much you and your shows. You said that if Trump had toned it down to 99.7 he may have walked away with the election... I hope the phenomenon that elected Trump is the result of a people clinging to an unchanging set of beliefs in a world of drifting/ untethered beliefs. I believe this is the case. That is why republican candidates who compromise or are weak are disgusting to us. You mentioned Romney and McCain , and I agree. They lacked conviction in their beliefs, which allowed them to tone it down. I agree that Trump frequently shot himself in the foot with his tweets,  but no form of &quot;toning it down&quot; would help with an ideology committed polulace assuming that ideology is eternally unchanging and authoritative . There is no degree of virulence applied to a conviction that will lose the support of a people dedicated to a threatened doctrine they believe is inspired by God. Lack of conviction is the problem, not the solution.",M Farmer,2020-11-09T22:22:35Z,0

"The hypocrisy of the left can&#39;t be understated.  In 2016 Hillary campaigned with the hope messaging that Obama did.  Trump campaigned on a doom and gloom approach and was thoroughly lambasted for it, even though it is a legitimate picture that more and bigger socialist policies are bad for America and that the existing ones cause damage in the areas they intend to fix.  Meanwhile, in 2020 Biden campaigns on doom and gloom of the Coronavirus, and his message is treated as morale and just by the media.  Fearmongering is OK as long as you are on their side of the aisle, like every other tactic that is strangely abhorrent only when the enemy does it.  <br /><br />Another example would be the topic of pre-emptive court-packing, the mere suggestion that the right try to use the left&#39;s own idea against them was earth-shattering.  Or how the border holding areas were set up by Obama&#39;s own executive order which stretched the power of the presidency, and somehow Trump ought to be held accountable for it, it&#39;s racist that it exists under his watch.  If it is such a terrible human rights violation to exist, then why didn&#39;t congress impeach Obama over it when he made it circumventing legislation like an authoritarian to even do so?",John Baker,2020-11-09T22:15:23Z,0

"As they say at my work. Sometimes you bite the bear, sometimes the bear bites you. Trump was a great president, yet there can be no argument that his rhetoric was divisive. <br />He in no way catered to those on the left. With his lack of grace on Twitter and at the podium, it is perfectly feasible and understandable that Dems came out to the polls with greater numbers.  Motivated by a president who drove them crazy for 4 years. <br />Many who voted for trump in 2016 didn’t vote for him in 2016. He lost considerable votes from 45-65yr old white men. My dad has voted red his entire life. He is 75, he voted red in 2016 and voted independent for the first time ever in this election. <br />Trump lost, it’s not the end of the world. Dems run on promises they never keep. We need not worry. I would have liked to see trump in the WH for 4 more years but you don’t always win. Nobody does, not even trump.<br /><br />Edit: maybe there was voter fraud, maybe there was voter suppression like ben says these factors are not going to sway an election where one candidate beats the other in swing states by many tens of thousands of votes.",Howard A,2020-11-09T21:50:09Z,0

"The media projects the winner of the Presidential election when their statistics and data teams are confident in the probability of the outcome, this has been true for decades, it is not new or bias. President Trump stood in the White House and claimed he won, he hadn&#39;t. He claimed there is rampant voter fraud, this has no apparent basis, the litigation will go to court and if it has merit it will be heard, but not one of the judges in these states has seen any merit in these claims. It is incredibly irresponsible to sow distrust of the mechanics of democracy to any segment of the electorate. Part of what makes democracy possible is the faith people have in it. Without evidence of fraud or tampering, it is incredibly un-American to reject an election because the person you voted for lost. In 2016 Clinton supporters protested, as is their right. It is your right to protest as well, but your protest will be against the traditional operations of American democracy. Let the legal process play out, but if the courts are not convinced in the evidence (or lack there of) provided, you will be at odds with 2 processes of democracy. If you love America, if you love democracy, then trust the process and participate in the democracy the next time you get to have your voice heard.",Reginald McRiches,2020-11-09T21:36:21Z,0

In case of this likely outcome i wont be promising to do what crazy democrats promised to do if trump won in 2016 and leave the country and i dont think any of you should either. Merely i think this should put you on notice. Fox news is longer conservative and now there is not a SINGLE mainstream news network on the TV, id love to live in a world where daily wire and other networks have a meteoric rise and keep news fair by giving people a conservative alternative but i just doubt its gonna happen. Id like it if californians didnt turn texas blue, which if it happens all but decides the next election making everyones vote even more meaningless than this ones was. There is no universe where republicans win without texas its bad enough that they automatically get cali and NY losing texas is an instaloss combined with voter fraud. I take the result of this election as a sign. A sign that people would rather live comftorble life than a responsible one. That they want trump gone so that their favorite actors, the media, overzealous family members, social media, and european countries stop talking about/losing their minds over him. That they dont care that biden may have dementia and that kamala may be more evil than hillary. NOTE: none of this means america is finished at best id compare it to chess, mate in 6 or less. 1. Packing the courts, 2. Kamala becoming president, 3. The &quot;accountability project&quot;, and whatever other ones you might name.",Christian Edwards,2020-11-09T21:32:12Z,0

If Trump loses China will reign over our markets like the past 20 years and dictate our policies through economic might and corrupt politicians; the poor will get poorer, blacks will have dug their own grave and remain  in poverty and oppression for the next 100 years, and In God We Trust will and the saying Merry Christmas (too celebrate Jesus B-Day) will be gone while holidays in the name  of other religions will be a statutory right.

"While I respect your intellect and perspective, I strongly disagree. There is no clear demonstrable proof of fraud, and in addition to that, Biden is far enough ahead in most swing-states that EVEN IF there were very minor differences in the outcome based on a recount, it is deeply implausible that this would lead to the election result changing. Biden won the popular vote by 4 million votes, something which you rarely mention - should we not discuss the fact that in both of his elections, Donald Trump lost the popular vote by millions? Is the system not flawed? Should 75 million Americans be misrepresented based on invisible lines across the USA?<br /><br />In treating these accusations of fraud as legitimate, you do a disservice to your viewers. Biden has essentially won the election, and Trump is unwilling to accept reality - as he has demonstrated in his 4 years in office. You are welcome to dislike Biden or the democratic party, or America&#39;s political institutions - but supporting the lies of an anti-democratic neo-fascist is un-American and shameful.

"@J Mireles I&#39;m not going to go in on you because I can tell you&#39;re young, misinformed and ignorant. I don&#39;t think you really understand, Trump is a near once-in-a-generation President, he&#39;s so deeply unpopular with literally everyone except cultists that Biden didn&#39;t need to do pretty much anything, he just needed to be better than Trump. Pence, Rubio or Kasich would have likely all beaten Trump had this been 2016. Perhaps Cruz too, much better at debating than Trump. The last real equivalent in my lifetime was George H.W, not because of his personal characteristics, but the fact that he was hated by everyone because of his awful policies, it&#39;s why at the Republican Primaries, despite being President, his opposition nearly got a quarter of the votes. It&#39;s why he was beaten by Bill Clinton in 1992, who got 43%, the winner of the Presidential elections with the lowest popular vote percentage since 1918. Trump and George HW were literally despised, similar to George W in 2008 (which is why he only appeared at the Republican National Convention by video); even the likes of Romney or McCain would have beaten Biden. Trump lost due to his incompetence, the fact Biden barely campaigned speaks for itself, he didn&#39;t need to; because Trump&#39;s failures spoke for themselves. Also no, there is not, that is a lie; I explained why it wasn&#39;t voter fraud, you can&#39;t just cry and claim &quot;voter fraud,&quot; this is what you lot did in 2016 to us; it&#39;s woefully hypocritical. There is no evidence for voter fraud.<br /><br />&quot;Biden is a racist criminal and President Trump is not,&quot; you know there was a lawsuit against Donald Trump in the 1970s for refusing housing to black people, something he admitted to in 1987? Funny how that doesn&#39;t suit the &quot;Trump isn&#39;t racist,&quot; narrative. Trump has multiple, upon multiple, upon multiple examples of being racist. But unless he literally says &quot;I don&#39;t like black people,&quot; his supporters refuse to accept it, and even if he did say that: people like you would still try and worm his way out of it.<br /><br />Proof for alignment with racists and KKK members please? Oh yeah the Crime Bill that Trump&#39;s own Attorney General said didn&#39;t go far enough, so much for Biden &quot;aligning himself with racists,&quot; again, I don&#39;t like Joe Biden, I voted for him because Donald Trump is much worse. He&#39;s been demonising peaceful protestors and allowed a fascist police state to brew in which people are abducted in unmarked cars, police are firing tear gas and shooting at people with rubber bullets including medics, which is literally a war crime as according to the Geneva Convention, and can&#39;t face the reality that 93% of protests during BLM were peaceful and of the 7% that weren&#39;t the vast majority of agitators were found to be either counter-protestors or police forces. Yeah, what a shock. He wasn&#39;t called a racist before he chose to run as a Republican? You&#39;re out here calling Joe Biden racist, something that wouldn&#39;t have happened if he hadn&#39;t chose to run as a Democrat. The fact is both the President and Fox News have been violently brainwashing people by scaremongering about peaceful protestors, and this is exactly the same as they acted in the 1960s. It&#39;s straight out of the handbook you see: the protestors of today are no different from the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, there were riots then too, there were people calling Martin Luther King Jr a terrorist then too; it&#39;s woefully hilarious to see Conservatives like Donald Trump repeating history 60 years later. <br /><br />In terms of healthcare, in terms of climate change, in terms of the economy, in terms of law and order, in terms of housing, in terms of coronavirus. A Biden Administration is better at everything than a Trump Administration, which has thrived on anti-intellectualism and scaremongering, it&#39;s beautiful the fascist is now gone, and gone for good.",Sally Connell,2020-11-10T05:37:24Z,0

Meaning Biden increased the Democrats&#39; vote share by 2.58%, compared to Trump increasing his vote share by only 1.45%.<br /><br />The gap in vote share between the Democrats and the Republicans widened from 2.1% to 3.23%, widening by 1.13%<br /><br />Joe Biden is the second most popular Democratic Presidential candidate, in vote share, since 1964.<br /><br />The Republicans have won only 3 of the last 8 elections, winning the popular vote only once.<br /><br />&quot;Red wave&quot; though looool",Sally Connell,2020-11-10T02:22:03Z,0
"@J Mireles No, he&#39;s an old man who is deeply flawed but he&#39;s slightly less incompetent than Trump so people voted for him. That&#39;s why the slogan for this election was &quot;Settle for Biden.&quot; Biden didn&#39;t get in based on his merits, he got in based on Trump&#39;s flaws; if anything, exactly the same as the 2016 election was more a vote against Crooked Hillary than a vote for Trump. <br /><br />He has no need to cover his tracks, there&#39;s nothing to cover. You&#39;re just pure overdosing on copium right now g, Trump&#39;s lost, get over it. Even the Republican courts in states are rejecting this nonsense lol, because there&#39;s no basis to it. &quot;Communist partner in crime,&quot; lmaooo Kamala Harris? I truly love Conservatives thinking anything to the left of Ronald Reagan is communism, it&#39;s a pure buzzword because, on average, conservatives are less intelligent than &quot;liberals&quot; and so don&#39;t have an understanding of these terms.<br /><br />No, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said rightly that mail-in ballots received past election day should count. That&#39;s not violating the Constitution, in fact with military and overseas votes that literally happens every election because, newsflash! If it&#39;s postmarked before Election Day, it&#39;s always counted. That&#39;s how the law works. There campaign already had observers in the room! The issue was distance towards the ballots but those rules applied to Democrats, Independents and Republicans, moron. <br /><br />Also your last point on dead people voting is just wrong. Dead people can be registered to vote, that doesn&#39;t mean they voted. This is pure misinformation but what else can you expect from a gish-galluping constantly lying conservative. &quot;tHe MeDiA&quot; nope, I&#39;m not relying on the media, i&#39;m relying on the experts. And just because I don&#39;t belong to a personality cult similar to Joseph Stalin, like conservatives do towards Trump (a man who whenever he loses screams fraud! As proven by the 2016 primaries and the emmys) doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m biased.

A Trump Commission couldn&#39;t find any signs of mail-in fraud months ago. And there&#39;s no evidence to support it; Trump&#39;s just trying to invalidate as many mail-in ballots as possible because he knows they&#39;re predominantly Democrat because: surprise!

It is a boring game that ends with everything being labelled racist. You could say Mr. Kendi is obsessed with bringing race up. Has got anything else to say about anything other than race? He is a very over-priced, one trick pony. <br /><br />@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDnr79izdgQ&amp;t=15m01s"">15:01</a> It is a lot like the end of the Matrix Revolutions (2003) when the Matrix is rebooted and everything is nice and sunny again.

"Sounds like you forgot to mention the reason the media projected Joe Biden the president elect is because he won more votes than Trump in the battle ground states. If you are going to say their is fraud in the election process then you should make the case that perhaps their is fraud in the states that Trump won as well.  I mean why not bring legal action in Texas or Florida as well or Ohio for that fact. If Trump is going to go down this rabbit hole I would recommend that Biden hire a group of lawyers and contest all the states the Trump won. How do we know that Trump votes weren&#39;t suppose to go to Biden, after all the polls did predict a Democratic landslide victory. Maybe the fraud is on the conservative side and not the other way around. A while back Trump had a committee investigate voter fraud as he claimed when running against Hillary and they found nothing. Again, the media did not make Biden the winner the voters did and Biden simply has more legal votes than Trump.

"&quot;It&#39;s almost as if Covid is just a malleable tool that you can use to wield against your political opponents&quot;.  Absolutely correct, Ben.<br /><br />What is amazing to me is how open they are about it.  Even early on, the left complained about the armed individuals protesting MI&#39;s harsh lockdown orders in the state capitol building.  Yet, just weeks later, when massive crowds gathered to protest the death of George Floyd, these same leftist leaders not only were complicit, but also participated themselves.  Keep in mind that the mortality rate was higher than it is now.<br /><br />The only things to conclude from this is that either the virus is totally woke, or these leftist politicians are a bunch of fascist hell-bent on controlling every aspect of society all the way down to everyone&#39;s thoughts.",James Webb,2020-11-09T20:46:22Z,169
"@Jon-erik sumner While I would not consider it a &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;libertarian&quot; ideology, it is still anti-Marxist and anti-liberal in nature. The Italian Fascist party headed by Mussolini could be best be described as authoritarian, nationalistic, traditionalist anti-capitalist, and anti-communist. Fascism is not a catch all word for authoritarian. Authoritarianism has many forms. Absolute monarchies were one of the oldest forms. Modern-day authoritarianism includes Marxist-Leninism on the left and Fascism on the right with many deviations of each depending on the origin and social context. Using the left and right spectrum is probably a one-dimensional and superficial way of analyzing politics, but fascism still is considered right-wing by most academic scholars and historians.",Jarod Rieth,2020-11-10T04:36:04Z,0

If you cover the holes on your face, the chance of this happening is greatly reduced, if everyone else is also wearing a mask, the chances are reduced even more. Some might even go so far as to compare it to building a wall....except building it on your face....and everyone has their own so they can keep their own germs in, and other germs out. <br /><br />Had this simple task been more widely adopted, perhaps so many of Trumps own gatherings, as well as those of his supporters wouldn&#39;t have resulted in hundreds of people getting sick.",Daniel Boak,2020-11-09T23:42:58Z,0

"Ben....I strongly suspect that not only did Biden/Harris know that there was going to be voter manipulation and they might explain why he was so smug even when he was behind and why he didn&#39;t hit the campaign trial much. They knew that this was going to happen. I also suspect that China (CCP) and several large liberal billionaire&#39;s who are deeply socialist and hate Trump had a huge hand in financing the derailing of this election. I&#39;ll go even further and say that I suspect that Covid-19 was &quot;released&quot; for multiple reasons but initially to hurt Trump&#39;s re-election. It was fuel for a media who hated Trump to turn millions against him by blaming him for it. I also suspect that the strain of the virus that China dealt with was not the strain of the virus that eventual America and other nations dealt with. China was able to contain it very effectively but somehow, it became a major social, economical and political problem in the US. I would not be surprised to hear that there were those in the democratic party along with liberal global elitist who conspired with China to set Covid-19 up to look like an accident in order to use it as an excuse to get Trump out of office and to use Covid-19 as the black swan event to usher in radical change to our monetary and financial system. China doesn&#39;t want to see America fall, they need markets for their products but they would love to see America become totally dependent and in dept to them in order for them to become the number one super power in the world. Biden will do whatever they ask and Trump wouldn&#39;t so I suspect that China allowed the world to think that they alone were responsible for the virus when I suspect in reality, there were other powerful people and groups who also had a hand in it also. If these people would throw an election for their own agenda and ignore the will of the people then they would also not value the lives of the American people and probably wouldn&#39;t have any problem subjecting us to Covid-19.",Brad Stoner,2020-11-09T20:45:48Z,0

Cheating the process is morally required, and rules are made to be broken, so long as you don&#39;t get caught. All events are pointless, because everything is subjective and meaningless anyway, thus just do what you need to get something you don&#39;t deserve.<br /><br />This is not just about elections.

The only difference is that at least in an emotionally abusive relationship, the abuser has a tendency to at least apologize. These democrats are downright gaslighting.

"For those who never heard an for those who wanna share it.<br /><br />HERE IS THE MILLMILLION-DOLLA.    QUESTION: Will you go to Heaven when you die? Here’s a quick test: Have you ever lied, stolen, or used God’s name in vain? Jesus said, “Whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” If you have done these things, God sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, adulterer at heart, and the Bible warns that one day God will punish you in a terrible place called Hell. But God is not willing that any should perish. Sinners broke God’s Law and Jesus paid their fine. This means that God can legally dismiss their case: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” Then Jesus rose from the dead, defeating death. Today, repent and trust Jesus, and God will give you eternal life as a free gift. Then read the Bible daily and obey it. God will never fail you.",Excursion Comics,2020-11-09T20:19:07Z,0

All he needed to do was let Chris Wallace allow Biden to show himself the door. But, he couldn’t let Biden implode on his own. Dumb.

"yes and over 74 mil voted for biden.. thats over 4 mill people that wanted trump out.. Trump won by EC last time and even then Hillary had more votes then he did.. what does this mean? it means more Americans lean left. I think the reason there wasnt a blue wave was because of the radicals on the left.. most people are in the middle.. like myself i just want healthcare for all.. everything else on the left is too extreme.. which is why they didnt take the senate and lost seats in the house. regardless, More people didnt like Trump and after they do all this recounting and lawsuits the people on the right are going to have to come to terms with that as well. biden got 4 mil more votes.. thats alot people.. If trump by some slim chance won the EC.. there would be riots because majority of the people in the USA didnt vote for him. it wouldnt be the will of the people. fact",Q,2020-11-09T20:14:32Z,1

"I&#39;ve got no beef with Biden, what I do have is a problem with the media call it for Biden. They know better their words mean nothing and that the states still needs to certify it. You can gaslight all you want, but pretty sure they&#39;ll likely have to cover the legal battles. I don&#39;t know if Trump will end up winning when the dust settles but there are definitely anomalies that should be investigated.

"I think it’s fairly safe to say that there is a large portion of the young democrat supporters that have no interest in truth or justice and who will never except the outcome of the justice system if the verdict is widespread corruption in the vote, supporting Biden’s party.  <br /><br />This group of people have been practicing and testing the local governments as well as the federal response, in the event that their candidate was not elected.  Now that the democrat-loving Trump-hating media has announced Biden as the winner, without any respect for the process (hint- that’s more evidence of fraud and corruption against the USA by way of near universal deceptive and biased news), these rioting groups will rage and attempt to burn down our country.  They are here and have been tranquilized momentarily by the alleged Biden win.  But, if it’s overturned, there will be a need for law enforcement to save the lives of our people in those Democrat-run cities, and the other areas they attempt to march upon.  There are wolves all around us, and 2020 has let them out of the dark to bark in public and to terrorize our communities through fear, threats, violence, and extortion.  <br /><br />The identity politics and corruption of the Democratic Party will face extreme opposition the more they gain power.  Their fate is ultimate oblivion, like all wickedness.  They will destroy themselves after they corrupt the land and people, leading them into more extreme wickedness.  This has all happened before, even in this land prior to our nation’s founding.",Candymantempting 41,2020-11-09T20:13:47Z,0

You can only investigate voter fraud if you can prove it affected the out come of the election but with out investigating it. Best crime to be in,Curt Evartt,2020-11-09T20:06:39Z,0
"<b>For anyone who needs some faith.</b><br />Inevitably Trump is taking the voter fraud cases to a mostly conservative Supreme Court where he appointed 3 of the justices. So either trump is lying entirely there is no voter fraud at all no meddling of any kind or he has evidence to prove there is and will present it to them in which they can probably do one of the three things one is to go against him and say nope sorry (I really doubt trump who was fully prepared for this to happen was unable to find anything), they are going to rule for him and throw away certain mail in bailouts from these certain states we need which is an automatic win, or they push it to Congress to vote on it in which the house will choose trump because they decide what happens here if the Supreme Court says let’s leave it up to them. Every state gets only one vote in the house. Currently there are 26 red states vs 24 Blue states. After this election we are now at 30 red states and 20 blue states.",X,2020-11-09T20:06:37Z,0

"@allaroundcomedy And obviously saying he is responsible for 200000 deaths was a bit sarcastic but given the death rates of MOST industrialied countries most of those deads would till be alive, thats simple statistics.<br />And btw I am still waiting for you to present evidence for what growth indicator has changed massively when Trump took power from Obama.",Schnitzel Blitz,2020-11-11T06:48:45Z,0
"@allaroundcomedy  He has taken back quite a few regulatories that impact the environment on a LOCAL level, in terms of coal and oil extraction and transport and of course leaving any international agreement on climate change would have a negative longterm impact.<br />Now, on your links: you should really look at your websites before you post them lol. What you are seeing and what the US is doing kinda ok is CASE FATALITY RATE. So meaning how many deaths per infected. If you clicked the other tab in your own link you would see that in PER CAPITA deaths, which is a much more important indicator of how a country is doing, it is among the 10 worst affected countries WORLDWIDE. Great success, isnt it? Man, learn to read statistics before you rely on them lol.<br />Same on the deficit: you do see how it starts to rise SHARPLY after a lowpoint in 2016? BEFORE the pandemic? It is the first case of a rapid deficit growth in the midst of an economic boomtime in recent US history. As usual Trump is building his „success“ on money he doesnt have.

"@KyleRoku I know the Democrats are corrupt and unscrupulous and I do think that they are capable of voter fraud......however....fraud on the scale required to turn the election in Biden&#39;s favor would require a large number of conspirators working in cooperation with one another on a large scale and some person or people would have to be in charge of facilitating and organizing the scheme.  In other words, it would require many people.....and one thing that we know about people, in general, is that they talk.....a lot.  A conspiracy of this magnitude would be almost impossible to keep quiet or cover up.  There would be a lot of easily discovered evidence.  But instead of bringing forth evidence, team Trump is just making a lot of vague accusations.  The burden of proof is upon Trump.....it&#39;s not the Democrat&#39;s job to disprove his vague allegations.  Also, keep in mind that this is Trump we are talking about.  He lies and exaggerates constantly.  So much so that anything he says should automatically be assumed to be a lie.  Lies are Trump&#39;s default.  I&#39;m still waiting for his investigators in Hawaii to tell us all what they found about Obama&#39;s birth certificate.  Trump said that we &quot;wouldn&#39;t believe what they are finding&quot;.......OK....great....what did they find?...................................crickets.................because he was lying....Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am willing to entertain any credible evidence that they are able to uncover but logic dictates that Trump is lying......his team of sad pathetic losers are desperately trying to appease the Orange Man and stay in his good graces.....so they are going along with his nonsense.....The probability that Biden legitimately won is extremely <br />high.......That is the simplest explanation.",fosterchild4523,2020-11-09T21:05:45Z,0

"💥💥💥💥Now you understand why he was playing golf today 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💣💣💣💣💣<br /><br />On Election night, Trump and his campaign team assembled in the Eisenhower Building just west of the White House to watch the results come in.<br /><br />Know what is there?<br /><br />A SCIF.<br /><br />Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility. (SCIF)<br /><br />The kind used by Army intelligence cyber security division.<br /><br />One of the first things you&#39;ll notice when you open this article is the red castle.

This is going to the Supreme Court. Where they will rule that the election is invalid due to fraud or mistakes on a country wide scale.  It will go one of two ways, either they will rule that all the unconstitutional <br />mail in ballots will be removed and the states ordered to recount without them  or they will simply rule the election is invalid due to mass voter fraud and at that point it will be sent to the congress and senate for a vote. This is where it gets good. The house/congress votes on who the President will be. It has nothing to do with what party that has power. Every State gets one vote and 30 States are held by Republicans.and 19 by Democrats. They have to vote down party lines, they have no choice due to the 12th Amendment of the Constitution and the Senate votes for the Vice President where a similar even will take place.  This is The law.  This is why the Democrats are so mad at Nancy Pelosi. This will all happen in January. The only way President Trump won’t be President is if he concedes the election and that will never happen. So stop watching the fake news and don’t let your heart be troubled and live your life knowing this will all work out. President Trump will remain President.   I have researched all of this and it is Fact!<br />Another fun fact, they called Gore the President Elect for 30 days in 2000 until the courts ruled against him and declared Bush the winner. And two people that were part of Bush’s legal team were none other that new Supreme Court Justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.

"You, have to give a kudos to Trump. He was a NYC Democrat at one point. He, walked the streets it the movers and shakers on Mt. Olympus. He and Giuliani have been privy to a lot of scuttlebutt. Trump&#39;s had to deal with the real world entities like Unions, Organized Crime, World leaders and diplomats and the Post Office (Apparently). He, knew how &#39;Tammany Hall operated. He, knew that during any given election you could find massive evidence of voter fraud. <br />  If these acts are being orchestrated by the Democratic Party dude there&#39;s gonna be some &#39;Splain&#39;n&#39; to do the American people and,a lot of politicians who lost an election by a hair over the years. I, think that the Justice Department has been working overtime to expose this crap that most Americans dad heard inklings of but, blew it off as &#39;Urban Legend&#39;.<br />   Can, you imagine Joe Biden having to retract his acceptance speech? The media schills will have to talk about this since along with the ballots they destroyed people regular mail as well.<br />   Furthermore, if they start finding undelivered People&#39;s &#39;Stimulus Checks&#39; it would explain why people are complaining that they haven&#39;t gotten their Stimulus money yet. This, would strengthen the argument that &#39;Nancy Pelosi and her ilk do actually spread misery just for political purposes. This would explain a great many things. <br />   Trump is calm and,cool he new the condescending Democrats were living with a &#39;False Sense of Security.<br />   The, Biden campaign was getting a little nervous election night then &#39;Boing!&#39; Jeannie blinked. <br />    If, this turns out the way I think it will this could be the &#39;BIGGEST STING OPERATION IN WORLD HISTORY&#39; <br />   Postal Workers are not like CIA operatives.

"Voter fraud happens all the time, but it has never been used as an excuse to try and delay the inevitable. People who commit voter fraud should be tried in court and if proven guilty their votes should be removed from the outcome of the votes. That being said, in the history of the United States, there has never been voter fraud executed on a level that has ever been close enough to affect the outcome of a national election. This whole legal fiasco is an embarrassing waste of time and money. As previous voter recounts have shown, the variances are in the hundreds, their is zero chance the Trump has won.",True North,2020-11-09T19:42:29Z,0

"I’m a political strategist in Canada and from up here, I’ll tell you what cost you this election:<br /><br />1. No real message of hope. At least half of voters need to feel hopeful. <br />2. Terrible foreign policy in the last 4 years.<br />3. Messaging and talking points about Biden being incapable because he’s old. The second largest group of voters after baby boomers are the people between the ages of 70 and 85. They probably don’t feel incapable and quite frankly, it’s insulting.<br /><br />Post mortem analysis will show that no. 3 is what cost you the election. For a so called pundit, your political miscalculations astound me.<br /><br />Whoever’s idea it was to use the messaging that he’s old, he’s crippled, he has dementia should be immediately fired. How stupid of you guys was it to alienate the second most important group of voters in the United States. Millions of people that look at Biden (an older white man) see’s themselves. I bet you they don’t feel at all like you guys have spent months describing him. Poor talking points have consequences.  <br /><br />Furthermore, what are the two largest groups of people in the US that vote by mail?

"Whether or not the evidence for voter fraud is substantial, you can&#39;t call the election until all of it is investigated plus you have to let all the recounts that are going on to finish. Once all this is finished and it is over, who ever is the winner is the president. Don&#39;t matter what side you are on, you have to agree that all this should get finished and cleared up first. It is important to our election process that we let this all play out. Biden supporters say there is no evidence, then let this play out and you only stand to gain points if it turns out that there is no evidence. Trump supporters need to also let this play out and not give up, he can still win if it turns out that there is substantial evidence of it. All Americans stand to gain from this playing out is what I&#39;m trying to get at. The slogan is &quot;every vote counts, so we are counting every vote&quot;, if you believe this then we should not call states or elections until it is clear that all the legal votes are counted, all the challenges/lawsuits are finished, and all the recounts are done. Then and only then, will we be sure of the winner and can call it a done deal, Biden has not won/lost until then and Trump has not won/lost until then. So hold your head up high and let our processes play out, it is the only way to be sure, as Americans, what is going on and we should all have the right to know the results.",WhiteStoneIndustries,2020-11-09T19:16:06Z,0

The good news is that there are many of us whose political positions lie more to the center. I spoke out against democrats when they held on to hate and fear when Trump was president and I&#39;ll speak the same for Biden.

From the things he has said there&#39;s a strong indication, or at least an indication, that he will turn further left towards the progressives like Alexandria ocasio-cortez. That I would hate. That I would view as a disaster. But it&#39;s possible he won&#39;t go there and it&#39;s possible to go in a direction that I don&#39;t like, but it may not be a disaster. The other serious concern is his mental health and whether or not he can get through 4 years. If he can&#39;t, that means Kamala Harris becomes president. All indications are that that would be a disaster across the board. Racial tensions would surely skyrocket, and there is no positive evidence in her record that I have seen that she is good at anything except having the cool and unrelenting posture of a prosecutor when there are witnesses before the Senate.",TrueNorth2606,2020-11-09T19:12:21Z,0

"The beginning of his administration Trump went hard on illegal immigration and in his usual sloppy use of words some of his statements could be interpreted as racist, I think it&#39;s pretty hard to argue with that. But he was going after illegal immigration. If the Democrats more of the current people classified as illegal to be legal immigrants they could introduce legislation, but they don&#39;t . Trump also banned Muslims from certain countries from entering the United States. I don&#39;t believe this had its root in racism, it had its roots in the fact that these were the most likely places on Earth that terrorism against Americans was to originate. I also remember hearing an allegation that when Donald Trump was in business with his father some of their buildings either tried to keep blacks out or tried to get rid of them. I don&#39;t know whether this was true or not. It was a long time ago. These are the only three things that I have heard that support any charges of racism, but on the first two, I don&#39;t believe their origin was racism, though Trump&#39;s careless speaking might lead one to that conclusion. On the third, I never did see any evidence that that racism went any further than Trump&#39;s father.<br /><br />And yet to the Democrats he was strongly racist against blacks, and incidentally all others that were white. But there&#39;s no evidence of this in his policies that does not have an alternate explanation. Not only that, in the case of illegal immigration, the same charge could apply to the entire Democrat establishment because they have the power to introduce legislation that would change America&#39;s immigration laws. But they haven&#39;t even introduced it, isn&#39;t that racist by their definition? and I emphasize they haven&#39;t even introduced such legislation, they could have introduced it it could have been defeated, it could have been vetoed, but they don&#39;t even try.

"I&#39;ve been an avid follower of you for years, Ben.  I&#39;m politically moderate, and your assertations about the state of our country on both sides of the aisle has always impressed me.  But I absolutely disagree with your stance on this entire issue.  I&#39;ve always considered you to be someone who, regardless of your own leanings, could separate ego from logic.  Not now.  <br /><br />For one thing, Donald Trump is not now and has NEVER been a Republican.  There is no name for what he is, simply because he is motivated by his own selfish pursuits and completely disinterested in what is best for the country.  I don&#39;t care if you loathe Democrats.  I don&#39;t care if you loathe Libertarians, Independants or whatever the hell Kanye West is.  To ever suggest that Donald Trump is an actual Republican and because of that giant &quot;R&quot; next to his name, he magically endorses and supports what conservative America believes in is just utter BS.  He cares about himself.  Nothing more.<br /><br />Trump has proven that he is emotionally the equivalent of a 5 year old.  Is this news?  The endless stream of Tweets, the constant chest beating.  Now he is faced with the harsh reality that - quelle surprise! - he lost the election, and instead of accepting that fate,  he has again chosen to stick with his mantra of &quot;He who has the most toys, wins&quot;.<br /><br />If Trump genuinely believed there was voter fraud, he has a right to pursue that.  And yet when case after case is dismissed, when even his Republican predecessor has stated that the election was fundamentally fair, he continues his petulant behavior and basically refuses to leave the playground.  <br /><br />But it&#39;s all a clever, albeit repetitive strategy on Trump&#39;s part.  Because all he needs to do is suggest foul play, and his blind followers will scream it from the rooftops.  Nevermind that there is no substantial evidence. <br /><br />Ben, you&#39;ve been stating for years that facts don&#39;t care about our feelings.  That applies to you as well.  We don&#39;t get to make up scenarios that fit our narrative, just because we feel disenfranchised.  <br /><br />Donald Trump, politics aside, is a lousy human being.  The idea that so many of his followers would conveniently ignore this because of their fear of the other side of the aisle, is a sad commentary on where we stand as a country. <br /><br />Is it Trump&#39;s fault when ANTIFA riots and destroys?  Not immediately.  But is he responsible for fueling the fire?  100%.<br /><br />I think it&#39;s you who needs to be a mensch this time, Ben.  Separate your obvious disdain for Biden/Harris and consider the very obvious reality:  Trump is not a nice guy.  He&#39;s not even a good guy, and any good that has come from his administration has very little to do with him as a leader.  He&#39;s a sociopath, a master manipulator.  We don&#39;t even need a point of contast here.  Biden could be Santa Claus or the devil himself, and Trump is still what he is.  But Republicans will continue to cover their eyes because he&#39;s anti left, and that&#39;s music to their ears.  So fine.  Forget what he is.  Just be willing to accept reason despite how you feel about either candidate or party.",Just me,2020-11-09T18:59:35Z,1

NASA scientists have written several arguments on climate change as well. We know it exists, but we only have data dating back SO far to allow us to draw conclusions on how much we are impacting the change. I find it a comedic failure that the left managed to lose to such a person if what you say is true. Or is that still Russia’s fault? Something absolutely not rooted in science.

This is not about race, seeing there are millions of people who weren&#39;t white that voted for Trump. This is about ideology. And, much like the Middle East, ideological wars have been fought for years. The difference is one side is willing to go to war for their beliefs. That&#39;s confidence. The other wants to hide behind a regime that wants control at all costs. The question is what leaders in our military will do prior, or after, the rulers in control implement leadership that executes their demands and complies with every order otherwise faces fear for their life. <br /><br />When Ben went over AOC&#39;s comments and Michelle Obama&#39;s comments, I legitimately felt alarmed, scared, and the need to retaliate in defense of others that are attacked for their beliefs and who they are as a person. So there, we&#39;re fighting for the same thing. They explicitly said they are going after a group of people who have beliefs different from there&#39;s and ensure &quot;there are no survivors.&quot; That&#39;s only one woman&#39;s voice, but no one is calling her out. <br /><br />They are stating they will go after anyone and everyone that spoke out in support of the opposition.

Boxes of ballots marked as containing ballots for Clinton only had half the number of ballots as they were labeled.  <br /> There is a LOT of evidence of election fraud this time around. The biggest problem is getting hinest investigators to look into it.

"Half of the cases have already been thrown out.  I&#39;ve caught tons of video where officials are dismissing Trump&#39;s lawyers because they have zero evidence.  If this keeps going on with no visible evidence to prosecute, Trump is going to discredit himself.  If there&#39;s proof, show it.  <br /><br />Cause, if there isn&#39;t, it&#39;s over pal.  I&#39;m sure there is some fraud, of course.  Is it Biden&#39;s fault, and is it enough to flip the election for Trump?  No and no.  So, again, this is all a circus.  I just hope you guys are appropriately embarrassed when this doesn&#39;t work to elect Trump.<br /><br />Because you&#39;re being dishonest.  Whether or not you believe voter fraud should be dealt with, that is not the reason you are doing this.  You are doing this because you want Trump to win, not because of justice for the system.

"@Celeste Bivin I don&#39;t have any issue with the legal challenges but to suggest that counting votes is evidence of fraud doesn&#39;t make any sense. For one, during a once-in-a-century-pandemic, many state governments, including Georgia, which has a Trump-supporting Governor, Secretary of State, and Elections Commissioner, expanded no-excuse mail-in voting. In fact, it was the Republican state legislatures in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania who passed laws forbidding precincts from tabulating mail-in votes until polls closed on election day, which substantially delayed the process and made it appear that Trump had leads in those states because election-day votes were counted first. The reason Biden appeared to make a sudden comeback is that Democrats disproportionately voted by mail, rather than in person, because Trump explicitly told Republicans to vote in-person and mail-in ballots were counted late in those rust belt states. Conversely, in Arizona, the Republican state legislature allowed precincts to start counting mail-in ballots before election day, which is why Biden appeared to have a much bigger lead that Trump began to make up. As such, by your logic, there was fraud in Trump&#39;s favor in Arizona because Biden&#39;s big lead shrunk over time. Given that the courts, at almost every level, have more Trump appointees than Democratic appointees you should trust what the courts have to say about Trump&#39;s challenges.",Jaques Cartier,2020-11-09T21:16:44Z,0

That is fraud. There hasn&#39;t been a time in the past where a presidential nominee has been up by several percentage points with 10% left to count and no way for the opponent to close the gap and you get up in the morning and that person is not still the winner of that state.

"@AngryBaleFace  There were people there who wanted them pulled and people there that wanted them to stay up, in general. Then a &quot;unite the right&quot; group decided to come along. Two different issues and groups of people. Doesn&#39;t really matter though. If you read what Trump said, he clearly and mean CLEARLY denounced the neo-Nazis and white nationalists. But that is NOT the narrative you have been led to believe now is it? Funny that, eh? <br /><br />Want to keep going down that rabbit hole? <br /><br />The number one reason I have seen for people joining the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23walkaway"">#WalkAway</a> movement, or otherwise getting &quot;red-pilled&quot; is because they started to actually dig into what they were being told and found out it was BS.

"@AngryBaleFace Here, you have been kind enough to type your reply, allow me to post the transcript of this Trump/reporter back and forth. <br />Trump: “Excuse me, excuse me. They didn’t put themselves — and you had some very bad people in that group, but <b>you also had people that were very fine people, on both sides.</b> You had people in that group. Excuse me, excuse me. I saw the same pictures as you did. You had people in that group that were there to protest the taking down of, to them, a very, very important statue and the renaming of a park from Robert E. Lee to another name.”<br />Reporter: “George Washington and Robert E. Lee are not the same.”<br />Trump: “George Washington was a slave owner. Was George Washington a slave owner? So will George Washington now lose his status? Are we going to take down — excuse me, are we going to take down statues to George Washington? How about Thomas Jefferson? What do you think of Thomas Jefferson? You like him?”<br /><br />Reporter: “I do love Thomas Jefferson.”<br /><br />Trump: “Okay, good. Are we going to take down the statue? Because he was a major slave owner. Now, are we going to take down his statue?<br />“So you know what, it’s fine. You’re changing history. You’re changing culture. And you had people — <b>and I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists — because they should be condemned totally.</b> But you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists. Okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.<br />“Now, in the other group also, you had some fine people. But you also had troublemakers, and you see them come with the black outfits and with the helmets, and with the baseball bats. You had a lot of bad people in the other group.”",Brutally Honest Canuckistani,2020-11-09T21:31:52Z,0

Now, here is the proof. Find the actual transcript for what he said that day. If you like, I can dig it up for you. Find where he said the &quot;good people&quot; THEN, keep reading.

@Liam Laramie the &quot;middle class&quot; is defined as families making between 66%-200% of the median income...if the median income shifts  up it moves what is now considered the &quot;middle class&quot; upwards with it...that does not mean that the people who were making 66% of the former median are making less...it simply means that they no longer fall in &quot;middle class&quot; by definitive terms...in fact if some increases there salary by 5% but.the median increases by 10% they could still fall out of the categorical &quot;middle class&quot; even though they saw a 5% gain...<br /><br />Why? Because everyone else grew by 10%...yet everyone still grew...,anthony ponafala,2020-11-11T18:29:32Z,0

@anthony ponafala I don&#39;t know where you got your info. I may be right it may be wrong. Regardless it&#39;s too general and isn&#39;t factoring in many additional economic principles that come into play. Simple type in &#39;dying middle class&#39; on google right now and see what you get. Netflix has even put out some documentaries on it. Hell even Tucker Carlson on Fox News a story about the dying rural communities all over the world and went into great detail in why its happening. If you honestly think things are getting better for the middle class/ average person you simply aren&#39;t paying attention to communities all over our country. Maybe you&#39;re privileged enough to live in a well to do area and you just don&#39;t step outside of it much. But the proof is all around you without even factoring in actual facts and statistics.,Liam Laramie,2020-11-11T17:04:55Z,0
"@Liam Laramie lmao the middle class still consists of 51% of the pop...while the upper class has grown from 11% to 19% in the last 50 yrs...<br /><br />The median income has also increase in the last 50 yrs...<br /><br />The only way this is possible is if the middle class moved to the upperclass...<br /><br />The lower class has changed from 24% to 29% yet median income rose...which means the lower wage bracket increased because the families in the lower middle did not grow fast enough to stay in the middle class...yet they still make more than 50 yrs ago...<br /><br />So 8% have grew into the upper class while 4 percent simply grew too slow to be considered in today&#39;s middle class based on median income...they still however have seen increases to wages...<br /><br />In a simple analogy brad went from 10-15 and is now considered low income because everyone else went from 10-20...<br /><br />So your problem is that more people ascended to upper income, the middle class makes more, and the lower class makes more?",anthony ponafala,2020-11-11T04:33:38Z,0

When that happened it now puts the local election precincts on notice to prove that one way or the other, which they cannot do now without an audit. That means the Trump team will still be able to go in and watch what should have happened on Nov. 3rd. The election is not over, it is only delayed, and it is not going to just stand as is.  This is what is going to happen in SCOTUS. Those mystery ballots that appeared overnight will be thrown out. That is the start.

"@Chaos the entire Democratic campaign against Trump was built on lies and total misinformation, from top to bottom, and side to side. For four years you guys, with zero evidence, accused Russia of stealing the 2016 election, and/or or Trump being a “Russian asset”, all based on the totally bogus “Steele Dossier” (which the Obama campaign used to get clearance to essentially wiretap the Trump campaign 4-5 years ago). You guys bellyached about this total farce so aggressively, that it led to a years long (and, expensive) investigation, ultimately resulting in a baseless impeachment (hence its being thrown out about as soon as it came to trial, as it was so rampantly spurious).<br /><br />And, now, after years of claiming that the election then was rigged, you expect Republicans to just accept y’all at your word that nothing about this election is fishy?! While y’all claimed that Russia “hacked” the election, your politicians, and their media mouthpieces, happily spouted out any and all lies that y’all could, never once caring about actual truth, because y’all reject any notion of truth as an “absolute”, instead opting for the incredibly toxic and dangerous philosophical approach of “the end justifies the means”.<br /><br />All that mattered to y’all was your hatred for Trump, facts be damned. It’s been said that there were “Russian troll factories” who deliberately pushed fake news by way of memes and gifs and some doctored videos and pics, all while you guys engaged in the very same thing, deliberately spreading misinformation, all while claiming to take “the moral high ground”, all while claiming to stand for “justice” and “peace”.<br /><br />Get the hell out of here with your “we’re inclusive and want the rich to be taxed fairly..... people to marry who[m] they want... and to do what they want with their bodies....” shtick.<br /><br />As multiple lawsuits over these past several years show (many dating to before Trump), you guys don’t want “equality”, you guys want it to be your turn to be the aggressor that you accuse us of being. Particular lawsuits regarding a certain cake maker in Colorado and a particular group of nuns in NYC and the surrounding area come right to mind.<br /><br />You can’t argue facts and actual issues, and can only resort to emotionalistic, anecdotal platitudes and outright lies.",cocamojoe,2020-11-09T22:29:07Z,2

NO. Good photo op though. Grats ABC. Next segment was some lady in the US took a picture of her daughter and compared it to a picture of Kamala and OMG THEY LOOK SO MUCH ALIKE!!!

"In my county in Michigan the county clerk claims there are approximately 131,000 registered voters on the rolls.  According to the recent census, the population of the county that is age 18 or older, and thus eligible to vote (but not necessarily registered), is roughly 119,000.  So if 100% of the county&#39;s voter-eligible population were registered to vote, we could only have a max of 119,000 registered voters.  In Michigan the statewide average for registered voters as a percentage of eligible voters is roughly 74%.  So even if my county were above average at getting eligible voters registered and hit 80%, there would still only be about 95,000 registered voters...far cry from 131,000.  Therefore it seems logical to conclude that the voter rolls in my county are far from accurate, and therefore ripe for voter fraud via mail-in ballots.  My mostly rural county makes up roughly 1.5% of the population of Michigan, so if you extrapolate that across the state, the potential for mass voter fraud is enormous...especially in the 5 largest counties (Metro Detroit area, Grand Rapids, and Flint) which comprise 49.5% of the states population.  Imagine how inaccurate the voter rolls could be in these 5 mostly Democrat counties that comprise 5 million people...truly scary the fraud that could be perpetrated.",Johnny Ballgame,2020-11-09T18:04:27Z,0

"@Kasper Clausen I don’t assume anything but I can understand why other people do. Also it makes sense that it would take long to find. They have to make a case for each state they suspect, that takes time. They have to also go through all the votes and count them, we are talking millions. Also not every vote has gotten in yet. My mom went to vote on Election Day and they had to mail it because they couldn’t find her name. This was her second time voting. I think the logical thing to do is not to assume anything. Both political sides should also want to know if there is or isn’t voter fraud. Anyways no matter who wins, I can’t wait until this whole election thing is over.

"Please, if you love our country, our freedoms, even our President... PRAY NOW!! Pray now like your children&#39;s lives depend on it because they do!<br /><br /> God chose Trump to do his work and keep this land from becoming a socialist hell. Prophecies told yrs before now upto present hr( look on YouTube for them) have spoke of this plan. They speak of the evils surrounding him. The &quot;witch(Pelosi) casting spells against him to end his presidency and his  life&quot;. They talk about contracts on his life. Snipers even while in the white house. Fake loyalty from within those surrounding him. Plans to even rip his marriage apart in an effort to shame and embarrass Trump. Plans to attack his family and the Republican party in general. He is broken. Tough exterior but his heart hurts... he feels alone. <br /><br />We need to pray for our President and our democracy. Pray for corruption and lawlessness and evil to be exposed and laid open for all to see. Pray the media is exposed and tore down and bankrupt- Replaced with honest God fearing reporters who give the news with integrity.  Pray for our POTUS and his protection. Keep him safe from the bullets. Keep his motorcade, Airforce One, his helicopter, all transportation safe from harm, strong like a Tank. Keep him safe from the snipers and the bombs. Keep the Trump family safe and out of danger. Let them be a stronger unit together than ever before. Pray for an army of angels to fight this battle from now till January 20th. After hes re-elected, continue to pray for his safety as the mobs and evil elite will want &quot;revenge&quot; for being exposed. <br /><br />Not many people know this but after 9/11, then Mayor Giuliani of NY was visited by not 1 but 2 world renowned prophets. Both Prophecies told Rudy Giuliani that he would become the &quot;Gatekeeper&quot; for the under dog. He was going to stand on the side of righteousness even when standing alone and he was going to fight the battle for this person who will rise up and be constantly attacked. He will withstand the first term of attacks with this man, but his greater roll will be &quot;within the highest court of the land where he will fight Satan before the judges God put in the court.&quot; Giuliani will be the &quot;holder of the secrets to open the eyes and hearts of nonbelievers.&quot; Remember he was told this is 2001-2002. Sounds like right where we are right now and Giuliani preparing for court battles starting tomorrow morning in PA. Rudy Giuliani needs your prayers as well right now for strength, protection, and guidance. He also has a target placed on him by the evil. Lord, please keep him safe and out of harms way in Philly especially. <br /><br />Please, don&#39;t get discouraged. Don&#39;t start believing the media or that its over. They want you to give up, to conced and agree to Biden being President.  If we do,, its over.... Keep praying and fighting for our President till he is firmly placed back in the oval office and then some! If Biden gets inaugurated, its over for America. We will &quot;fall and never rise again&quot; according to the Prophecies.  If it would happen as such, it will because the church and the Christians turned against him and/or did nothing. Maybe you don&#39;t believe in Prophecies, ok, but what if??? What do you have to loose by taking a few minutes each day and saying a prayer? We can get through this. This is the reckoning! No, not the end of times, but the end of the corrupt political machine in our government. &quot;One nation under God&quot; will be restored. Our freedoms restored. Our humanity, integrity, grace... We will begin healing!  The alternative...God will bring judgment down on the US with great destruction( fires, floods, earthquakes, even volcano,ect) if we do not follow his plan for Trump and Biden is put in office. FIGHT PATRIOTS AND PRAY TO GOD FOR GOD&#39;S PLAN FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS PROTECTION. <br /><br />You can find all these Prophecies on YouTube from years, weeks, days, and even hrs ago.

Most of the audience detests this character to the point of anger, others laugh at the lunacy of it, while some oddly empathize.  <br /><br /><br />Even in cases when losses are clear to the audience, the heel will dispute it by being vocal against the officials and creating unnecessary disruptions. The ending to this story is to have someone come in shut him up and toss him out. <br /><br /><br />Trump has more to gain by acting like a victim and making an emotional disturbance for the rest of his life than he does to concede the election aid the transition and quietly leave. He gets attention from the media this way, and when he goes on his speaking tour people will pay to boo, heckle, and hiss at the president they cant stand; or to cheer an antihero who was cheated by the Democrats",Max Nabutovsky,2020-11-09T17:58:33Z,1

This is why he hated Trump at the beginning because Trump didn&#39;t want to start new wars for Israel.

"This is going to the Supreme Court where they will rule the election is invalid due to fraud or mistakes on a country wide scale. It will go one of two ways, either they will rule that all the unconstitutional mail in ballots will be removed and the states ordered to recount without them or they will simply rule the election is invalid due to mass voter fraud and at that point it will be sent to the congress and senate for a vote. <br /><br />This is where it gets good. The House/Congress votes on who the President will be. It has nothing to do with what party that has power. Every state gets one vote and 30 states are held by Republicans / 19 by Democrats. <br /><br />They have to vote down party lines, they have no choice due to the 12th Amendment of the Constitution and the Senate votes for the Vice President where a similar event will take place. This is The Law. This is why the Democrats are so mad at Nancy Pelosi. This will happen in January.

"Pennsylvania basically sealed his loss, IMO. He might&#39;ve won the recount in PA, but the fact that the margin is greater than 0.5% makes it very difficult to get a recount directly. So he has to prove more than 46,000 cases of fraud in PA in the courts before the electoral college votes in just over one month. That&#39;s going to be very difficult. He can win some cases to say the process for counting votes was bad. But how can they prove there as widespread mail in fraud, and if they can, how do they correct it no that the votes has already been counted? I have my doubts...<br /><br />If he can do that, he can flip a few votes in Georgia and possible some in Wisconsin / Arizona / Michigan / Nevada. I don&#39;t see how he could lose North Carolina if he has 99% reporting and a 1.4% margin, but it&#39;s possible he could lose North Carolina due to the same bullshit that happened in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Michigan...",mathig nihilcek,2020-11-09T17:46:47Z,0

Second, Trump told his supporters to not trust the postal service, so his supporters did not mail in their votes. Of course it was going to appear that he was winning early in the counting process.
