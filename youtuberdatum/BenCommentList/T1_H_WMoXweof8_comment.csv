Dave Rubin would have been anathema in old conservative circles. Dave Rubin&#39;s husband is David Janet.  What the crap!  And I see &quot;conservatives&quot; inviting the pervert to partake in &quot;fiscally conservative&quot; and &quot;libertarian&quot; discussions.  John Adams said that &quot;our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious People. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.&quot;,ArchimedesBC,2020-12-26T22:12:58Z,1

Lol at &quot;Dave Rubin will interview people from all sides.&quot;  No he won&#39;t.  The guy operates in a tight echo chamber of one Foxnews or MAGA guest after another.  There are countless liberals and progressives who have asked him for an interview or said they would go on his show and he refuses.  He is a hypocrite.

"I really like Dave Rubin and respect him for sharing how his mind has been changed about abortion (moving from permissible at 20 to now at 12 weeks). He states that &quot;if you care about individual rights, what you have to first care about is the woman in the here and now&quot; (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_WMoXweof8&amp;t=59m47s"">59:47</a>). To me that sounds like operating on a system of <b>degrees of personhood</b> which is a very hard road to walk down.  What makes a human a person is not dependent on anything like size, environment (in the womb), development or dependency. It&#39;s inherent from the moment of conception. You don&#39;t get the right to kill someone just because you&#39;re bigger than someone else. This quote from Lincoln is a good representation of how dangerous this relative state of being can be. Just replace the word &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; with small/unborn or big/born, and &quot;enslave&quot; with abort. <br /><br />&quot;You say A. is white, and B. is black. It is color, then; the lighter, having the right to enslave the darker? Take care. By this rule, you are to be slave to the first man you meet, with a fairer skin than your own. You do not mean color exactly?--You mean the whites are intellectually the superiors of the blacks, and, therefore have the right to enslave them? Take care again. By this rule, you are to be slave to the first man you meet, with an intellect superior to your own. But, say you, it is a question of interest; and, if you can make it your interest, you have the right to enslave another. Very well. And if he can make it his interest, he has the right<br />to enslave you.&quot;",Janice Karr,2020-04-28T23:37:38Z,0

"I really believe Joe Biden didn&#39;t want to run but was kind of pushed into it because the rest of the field was off the charts wacko and though he is also a bit wacko, not Elizabeth or Bernie wacko. I don&#39;t think Biden&#39;s heart (or brain) are up for Presidency. The best thing the Democrats could have done is nominate John Hickenlooper or Michael Bennett. They are from Colorado and never got the name recognition because Bernie, Elizabeth and the rest of the clown car took center ring. Hickenlooper was a business owner, mayor of Denver then governor of Colorado. Bennett was superintendent of Denver schools then a senator.

"A fascinating conversation.  It is so rare these days to hear thoughtful, reasoned dialogue.  On the topic of abortion I am impressed that Dave is open to ideas from other perspectives.  I asked my sister (a nurse) the following question:  If a woman goes to her doctor and asks for a foot amputation would the doctor agree to it?  My sister said &quot;No&quot; if the foot is healthy.  So a woman or any person doesn&#39;t have the right to do &quot;anything&quot; with his or her own body.  There are limits.",Andrew Camacho,2020-04-26T19:27:29Z,18

"Your foot analogy is quite interesting, but I&#39;m not sure it is an equivalent argument. Chopping off a healthy foot would leave the woman with a permanent physical disability. Terminating a fetus would not. You could argue about the mental side of things, but physically, the woman would be as healthy as before.

Although I will admit, when I heard George W. lifting the ban on assault weapons I THOUGHT, that&#39;s not good. I used that weapon in the Military in the 1980&#39;s. Do I want a guy to be able to shoot 1100 rounds non stop at innocent people, like the guy at the Vegas concert did, killing 59, injuring hundreds, + all the other mass shootings. NO! But, Rebecca, The reason I get on Ben is in my first comments. And the reason we have no sensible gun control, why we ignore climate change is big donations made to Trump and Republican Senators(google it) And the reason Greedy Ben has the same opinions as those guys is they give him the tax cut for the rich. You know the one. The 1.5 trillion, 83% went to the richest 1% (people who make over 480K) AND only the rich got a permanent tax cut. AND it blew up the debt. WE will pay for a tax cut for people who DON&#39;T NEED A TAX CUT. I didn&#39;t think about all that by myself. My friend Google helped me. He will be your friend too. Ask him about the tax cut for the rich. Ask him about the millions the NRA gives to Trump and several Republican Senators. Don&#39;t be afraid. That&#39;s how you learn by asking questions.

We know that if we drive a car there&#39;s a chance we might get hurt or hurt others.

"Sic Semper Tyrannis Fair enough, but that’s the name they give themselves. The Nazis were “National Socialists” but the west called them what they were; fascists. These scum call themselves communists (bad enough) but they’re clearly fascists and that bar has a better connotation for the less politically aware. I serious see them as the Equivalent if Hitlers Germany in the mid 1930’s. If the west doesn’t unify, organise itself and act in a meaningful way we’ll have a Third World War in the next few years. It beggars belief that the west has enriched this diabolical regime over the past 20 years at its own economic cost.",John C,2020-04-26T21:14:19Z,1

The extreme lack of testing must be intentional. Contrary to what the President has said US testing is low on a world scale. The US testing level is about the same as Russia and Germany combined - who have in total a much lower aggregate population. Not doing testing is like not letting the boat dock - it just makes the numbers look bad for the President - to the great great hurt of the American people.

In a country where corporations run the government - giving the government more powers means giving the corporations more powers.<br />Corporations clearly have shown they have no interest in helping the average Joe. <br />Thus the question you must ask yourselves is NOT:<br />&quot;Should we give more or less powers to the government?&quot;<br />But instead:<br />&quot;Do we give the corporations more power over the government or take some of it away?&quot;<br />My personal opinion is - your rights and way of life won&#39;t improve until you address this and I strongly believe US <b>should</b> abolish the lobbyism and remove it from its political system...,Pavel,2020-04-26T12:18:09Z,4

"@Sic Semper Tyrannis Look, I think you are getting the wrong impression here. I am assuming your position is based on a general distrust of state power and a desire to resist or reject any attempt by the state to extend its powers. I am sympathetic to that. I too think we must all be cautious about the overreach of state power. We have seen governments all over the West extend their powers under the guise of &quot;anti-terrorism&quot; and now we are seeing a further extension of state power in response to the coronavirus. However, authoritarianism is not left or right. It is its own parameter and has historically been supported at various points by both left wing and right wing governments. At present, the increase in state power in the US is happening under the Republican Party, and in the UK it is happening under the Conservative Party. Despite this, I still do not find comparisons to extreme totalitarian societies constructive for the specific example you gave in your original comment. <br /><br />As for the opposition to free speech that seems to be a problem among today&#39;s liberals, yes, that is also an issue and something which should not be underestimated. However, the divisions in today&#39;s society cannot wholly be pinned on the left. The issue is tribalism and a breakdown of genuine discussion in general. This seems to be a bigger problem in the US than it is in the UK.",Spinoza,2020-04-26T19:23:01Z,0
