"The so called common sense gun laws are based upon lies/half lies.  A mass shooting, which co notates dozens, is 4 or more deaths.  The vast majority of deaths caused by firearms is by handguns.  And percentage of deaths by handguns is nearly all suicide, which indicates mental sickness and depression.  Those suicides use a tool w/ instant results, no chance of changing one&#39;s mind.  The Red Flag Law will be misused to confiscate a person&#39;s firearms w/o due process, even if it&#39;s because of a false claim by an ex-spouse.  The manufacturers were granted protection from BS lawsuits by anti-gun people as a way to bankrupt the industry.   No need to ban guns if there are none to be sold.  Background cheeks by the FBI already are in place.  The FBI is not allowed to save the names of who buys what in order to prevent a list of names and thus prevent the government from confiscating guns.  What the anti 2nd Amendment people, are going for is a gun registry, which can be used in the future to confiscate the citizen&#39;s ability to protect themselves from criminals and the govt, via the ATF.  They are also pushing for people to pay hundreds (thousands?) of dollars to register them for only 3 years, then they must go through the entire process again and again.  Only the rich will be able to afford that, thus putting the middle and lower class at a greater disability to protect their rights.  In addition to that, they are going to require people to have a background check EVERY time that they buy ammo. Also, these laws that are being put forth will decrease the number of people trying to get any kind of psychological help for even mild depression because then they will not be allowed to possess a gun, not even for hunting.   FYI, Michael Bloomberg has been financing anti-gunner groups (not just 1) and politicians that are anti-gun all across the country.  Kinda makes me wonder if he is investing in a country where he can become the puppet master of the politicians.",John Doe,2021-02-18T22:53:43Z,0

Democrat Nancy Pelosi knew about the threat to the Capital as the FBI had told her and she did nothing about security so she could blame Trump. This is why she changed her mind about witnesses as the defense had her on their list of witnesses and would no doubt ask why she did nothing to secure the Capital in advance.

Jan 6 was planned. It was choreographed. Nancy Pelosi had already been organising his (Trump) impeachment. He was supposed to generate anger amongst his fans and create havoc at the Capitol building. He failed their plans. His speech took too long and the people who entered the building were only the fringes of Trump&#39;s crowd. The real attackers were backed by the Democrats. The first person arrested was either BLM or Antifa. These Arseholes have to be arrested. The organisers. Pelosi stuffed up by relying on Idiots. Now arrest her,Kelvin Ripia,2021-02-18T09:13:06Z,0

Republicans failure to hold Donald Trump accountable for his involvement in the failed overthrowing of democracy on January 6 only proves that when Donald Trump made a joke a couple years ago about how he could do anything and get away with it it means that he was telling the truth because Republicans will never hold him accountable. Republicans clearly have no line and they will not let Donald Trump get away with. He could literally send an armed mob to attack Congress and they would allow that. Keep in mind that Republicans are also members of Congress and that crowd of Trump supporting Republicans were chanting horrible things about Mike Pence as well.

He says he doesnt believe evil and good are subjective yet politically acts as if they are depending on the political institutions. What amazes me are the vast majority of Ben&#39;s fans and comments on his videos do not agree with him.

Despite what they and the msm would like you to believe, there is a tremendous amount of evidence that fraud occured on many levels. The establishment wants Trump politically castrated and being unable to accomplish it legally or constitutionally are willing to just continue skirmishing for public opinion while waiting for the fraud allegations to fall into the memory hole. Trump will not be able to run again by 2024, they will make sure of it, but whether there is any opposition to the democrat regime depends on whether the Republican party splinters or allows the populist movement to continue to guide it.

However, you&#39;ll remember that the Senate went into recess before the house voted to convict and didn&#39;t return until right before January 20th and would not accept the articles of impeachment from the house.  This occurred while McConnel was still the Senate majority leader.  (Making it very rich when he pretended that was the reason we has unwilling to vote to convict). Once they did return, there was far to little time to vote on rules for the impeachment trial proceedings and have the trial  as well as do other essential business like swearing in the new senators from Georgia before Biden was sworn in.

"Understandable.  <br /><br />I‚Äôve taken the vaccine, just had my 2nd and final dose last Friday (you have to take 2 separate doses).  <br /><br />I had the Moderna one.  I‚Äôm in my early 30s.  I could get it because I work for a hospital.  <br /><br />You‚Äôll basically have mild flu-like symptoms for about 2 days and then you‚Äôre fine.  The reason why you have symptoms is because the point of the vaccine is to expose your body to a non active version of the virus so your body makes antibodies that will then work in the future if you get the live virus to fight it off immediately.  <br /><br />But, your body notices the non active virus and it responds with usual immune responses such as raising body temperature in an effort to kill the foreign thing, coughing (to try and expel the foreign thing), runny nose (to expel foreign thing), etc.  Normal flu symptoms.  While in the meantime your body is also working on a final solution which is to create antibodies that kill viruses.<br /><br />Antibodies take several days to be created by your body.  And that‚Äôs the basic idea, to give your body the ability to fight off the virus immediately before it gets a foothold.  Since you‚Äôll have those antibodies then after your body has created them.<br /><br />However it is understandable to be wary of new treatment.  I definitely would not take it if you‚Äôre pregnant.  Because they cannot do testing on pregnant women.  And so you should wait until after delivering before taking the vaccine, in my opinion.  But yeah, talk to your doctor about your questions.",N Hinata,2021-02-15T23:21:36Z,0

"Two things really aggravate me about the impeachment.  One is the side that&#39;s supposed to be about unity refuses to do a censure even though they would almost certainly get a bipartisan censure because they want to paint Republicans as blind loyalists defending Trump.  Never mind that there is an actual case to be made for Constitutionality of post office impeachment, a case that due process was not served, or the simple fact that the Brandenberg line was not crossed in a lot of people&#39;s judgement.  Pelosi says the Republicans are just voting for political survival and that&#39;s just such garbage.  You know who is actually doing that?  The side that somehow lacked a single person who didn&#39;t believe the impeachment was unconstitutional, didn&#39;t believe the Brandenberg line needed to be followed or was crossed, and didn&#39;t think there were any issues with due process despite the clear examples of manufacture of evidence and doctoring of evidence.  Not one Democrat voted against impeachment because of fear of being cancelled, not solidarity in conviction.  <br /><br />As much as I find the NPC meme fun, unlike the Democrats I don&#39;t believe they are a monolithic collective.  I believe there were individuals among them who would have voted against impeachment if it wasn&#39;t for political survival, much less the certain incursions on their homes and families that would follow like Van Der Veen is dealing with.  That&#39;s unity born of fear and I want no part of it.<br /><br />The 2nd thing that aggravates me is that as I mentioned before is that they clearly doctored evidence.  I would really like it if they would stop cheating for ten seconds so more Republicans can have some faith in the system again.",John Baker,2021-02-15T19:57:02Z,0

Ben said last week they won‚Äôt get a convict one way or the other. The fact they got 57-43 is a great results for them considering last year they got 48 votes on impeachment and one Republican for it. That results surprised me I only thought 53 vote for it max. Some Republicans voted to convict even though they knew they would get censured in their own states immediately after, plus they got McConnell to get up say they impeachment managers proved their case and say Trump is totally responsible and should be criminally prosecuted and that he would have a different verdict if Trump was currently president. Given the circumstances and no chance at a conviction the impeachment managers did the best job they possibly could with that case. Trump didn‚Äôt directly incite and insurrection but he definitely provoked what happened that day, and when it was going on he had no interest in making it stop even when his own Vice President was in danger.",Victor Ferrando,2021-02-15T19:16:06Z,3

"The fact that Israel has been used as a big Concentration Camp for experimental vaccines is not &quot;really good&quot; Ben. Doctors that specialize in vaccine Science like Doctor Tenpenny has explained how everybody who has taken the vaccine is going to be dead within 14 months because of the multiplication mechanism of Spike Proteins. In other words, a great genocide is taking place in Israel as we speak. Look into it. While you&#39;re at it, look up Klaus Schwab and the fact that Bill Gates has pumped billions of Dollars into this entire &quot;Pandemic&quot; falsehood. It is no conspiracy. This is reality. WHO has also admitted that the PCR tests are highly inaccurate, so there is no legitimate evidence that anybody has died from &quot;COVID-19&quot;, which has also never been isolated or proven to exist.

"&quot;Two minutes hate&quot;, man.<br />That&#39;s what the impeachment was about. If you read Orwell&#39;s novel, then everything from the past 4 years is straight out of the playbook. The problem is the proles are oblivious. You know, I did not even watch the impeachment nor check in at all on any news until I saw a headline that he was acquitted. <br /><br />But you really have to check yourself Ben. The &quot;two minutes hate&quot; applies equally to Fox and yourself as much as it does to MSM. Just because you are echoing sympathies from my point of view, doesn&#39;t mean that I am not sick of all the negativity. There should be an appeal to our intellectual, and hopeful, side.<br /><br />And particularly, I&#39;m also fatigued by the blindly unyielding adherence to a single ideology. That&#39;s not what Trump is about. He was willing to jettison mean and stingy &#39;textbook dogma&#39; and step across the center when it made sense to him and us. One example was the &quot;go bigger&quot; on the Stimulus. That is <b>not</b> core Friedman, Rand religion, but it is and should be yesterday&#39;s Republican Party. Otherwise, how would one argue that Trump is for the worker, yet not want him to help us out when we&#39;re desperate. After all, the Elites had no problem with that when it came to the Financial System and Corporate sustenance. This is why we loved Trump, because he showed us that what is good for the goose should also be permitted for the gander!  So, there shouldn&#39;t be a thesis that the arguments always come in only one of two flavors. <br /><br />In closing, I only tuned in briefly this morning because I wanted to see where Trump goes from here, then of course I got turned off. How about some hopeful stories about Trump&#39;s plans for return, and how he will excise the RINOs, the Tea Party Caucus, Mitch, and the &#39;Seven Impeachicans&#39; from a revamped platform? I want to see how my beloved Trump will <b>finally</b> remake the party <b>wholly</b> in his own image, and re-energize and expand our base for an assault on 2022 and 2024.<br /><br />Please listen to my comments, and enhance the character and tone of your content. We are all worn down and worn out from all the &#39;what the other side does wrong&#39; stuff.

"@William Comensky  I didn‚Äôt know that.  That‚Äôs interesting.  People in the US have forgotten what the purpose of our 2nd Amendment is, but it is the same as Finland.  To protect from a tyrannical government, as a last resort.  Basically to give citizens the power to overthrow their government in the worst case scenario.  And that‚Äôs the truth.  It‚Äôs why both left and right should support the 2nd Amendment, because a tyrannical government could come from any party.

"@Rocky Croods, since you&#39;re infected with the left propaganda, I bet you haven&#39;t read any of the comments here the mainstream media disagrees with. If you had, you would&#39;ve noticed I mentioned Trump only after you had wrongly assumed I had referred to him by mentioning free speech. Your only premise is &quot;orange man bad&quot; and hence, your horizons are rather narrow. Moreover, your claim that I repeat the book because it sounds good implies I have either read it out loud or listened to somebody read it to me. It seems the truth just goes in one ear of yours and out the other, bouncing like a ball, infinitely, though. You&#39;ve let the mainstream media systemically brainwash you and now you repeat false statements like a parrot. Your current goverment, not mine (I live in Europe), is a farce and your president and VP are embodiments of everything that has gone wrong. You&#39;re a strange bitter and ignorant specimen, endemic to your country which is on the doorstep of another totalitarian regime.",Laura ≈Ωupƒçiƒá,2021-02-16T11:25:05Z,2

To paraphrase Schwartzeneger, what about The Summer of the Broken Glass? As a European, I cannot believe somebody with a record of Biden &amp; Harris can be a president and VP, respectfully. Look at the mess caused by the vandals in the summer. Gina Carano was right.
