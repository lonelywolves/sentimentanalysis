This alone should deviate you from supporting this man. The fact that Shapiro is now live bashing your President should give you grave concern. This boy is backed by Billionaire oil money tied to Mitt Romney and they despise Trump hence his incessant attacks on him. <br /><br />This boy child comes from a family in entertainment and Hollywood and his sole purpose is to push U.S. to support Israel to the detriment of America and wage war in the middle east for an ethno state.

"Hey Ben - just a quick question. We disagree on a lot of things, but one thing that I can identify on with you is that we&#39;re both Jewish. That said, we&#39;re very different Jews - you&#39;re an orthodox practicing Jew, and I&#39;m a non-practicing Reform Jew. I was raised in a Jewish family, went to Shul probably 10 times a year, went to a Jewish school for middle and high school, had a Jewish wedding, and hang a Mezuzah on my door. But, I&#39;m non-practicing and married an atheist (she was born atheist, considering she is the child of Cambodian refugees... most of them were without religion). I am curious: do you consider me a Jew? Or just someone who was &quot;born Jewish&quot;?<br /><br /><br />P.S. I guess we do agree on one thing, politically: I&#39;m a Zionist too, even though I think the Israeli government isn&#39;t doing a good job.",Sam Blitz,2019-11-08T15:18:25Z,1

What on Earth do you think would&#39;ve happened back then in the days if these people, who did get caught attempting a coup on the POTUS, actually faced punishment for it? You&#39;d think the country would&#39;ve memory holed it and moved on to the next conspiracy (Quid Pro Quo) because half of America turned into the real life version of Idiocracy? No, you know what would happen? THEY ALL WOULD HAVE BEEN EXECUTED FOR TREASON ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN FOR BETRAYING NOT ONLY THE POTUS BUT THE COUNTRY AND ITS VOTERS AS WELL! But as it stands Government has gotten too big. So big in fact they have retarded people like yourself actually cheering them on to remove the POTUS based solely on daily bullshit pushed by them, libtard celebrities and corporate &amp; state run media.

"@Manhole Eunuchsbane I used to be a pharmaceutical representative.  I would agree, as a caveat Medicare is despicable and a forced government healthcare is horrifying. I would argue a person like Socrates or copernicus were rejected by &quot;mainstream&quot; ideology and were actively rejected and opposed even though they had income from patrons. Ideas are equitable, I don&#39;t think MSNBC giving you money or 10,000 people giving you money has an effect on your credibility.  The former though seems to be more of a constraint.",Ehud ben-Gera,2019-11-12T00:59:37Z,0

@Manhole Eunuchsbane So essentially you are giving exceptions to a white far left commentator you will not give to a female conservative commentator because she is black? Perhaps if she talked about how the family unit is not a provable benefit to society and absentee black fathers are a good thing to the black community you would applaud her income level but because she says things that challenge your preconceptions she is a grifter?
