"Some context about Wisconsin from a resident:<br />Evers tried to force the mail-in-only ballot 2 days before the election; statistically in Wisconsin, in-person voting tends to favor conservatives while absentee and mail-in ballots (or other non-in person voting) favors liberals.<br />The WI Supreme Court in their ruling determined that a non-elelected official, in this case state Department of Health Services Secretary-designee Andrea Palm and other health officials, who made the decision in mid-April to extend the state&#39;s &quot;Safer at Home&quot; emergency order, has no constitutional authority to do so.<br />Wisconsinites were in the bars within 2 hours of the lockdown being lifted.",Evan Pahl,2020-05-20T16:51:50Z,0

"As a Texan, I can say how proud I am of my community in dealing with the Coronavirus. <br /><br />My sister in BKNY had schools and other large gatherings happening WEEKS after our local governance asked us to take steps to socially distance and close schools. She decided to stay because Cuomo said they&#39;d be ok and get to work in a few weeks. She&#39;s a single mom in a shut down industry, and we couldn&#39;t convince her to quarantine and come down while we work to help her, BECAUSE she wants to believe the idea NY is doing great despite having disproportionately high infections/deaths. Her roommate split to babysit celebrity kids at the behest of her employer (who shall not be named) in CA at a private residence, and expects my sister to make rent by herself while this happens and no one wants to rent with her. Now it&#39;s too risky to come to TX and Cuomo expects people to snitch on each other for breaking social distancing measures. . What in the George Orwell are we living through?<br /><br />Meanwhile my sister and community said we&#39;d suffer in TX because Republican governance. . Just like the media blasted. We didn&#39;t need state orders to close down because our local leadership and community made it happen. We have less than half the cases in our county here VS say some counties in south Texas where I&#39;m from. I think we&#39;re at under 60 active cases currently. . Boils down to culture and personal decisions to make smarter and safer choices while doing essential shopping and keeping medical expert&#39;s advice at front of decision making process. <br /><br />Anyone who says they&#39;re &quot;going to listen to Trump&quot; and go out no mask, sick or not, ignoring any distancing even if high-risk, JUST to make political point that they think he&#39;s wrong in handling this, are stupid. If you have a toilet leak I assume you listen to what your landscaper says, not your plumber.. Really?? The lengths some people are willing to go to in order to show what a horrible president they think Trump is, is worth some applause. Never say leftists aren&#39;t men and women of principle. . 🤦<br /><br />And on the case of AOC. . As a 27 year old Latina, I am appalled that folks seem genuinely taken back when I say I&#39;m a Conservative because she makes it seem like we&#39;re all running to Socialism. It&#39;s like people forget we&#39;re the melting pot of the world! Ask Hispanics at the border and we will tell you. . we live beside and love our undocumented neighbors BUT that does not mean we want them to get paid to break our laws! Our families did it legally, so can yours.<br /><br />Common sense is a rare quality it seems, and AOC&#39;s suggestions are laughable to anyone who grew up close enough to see neighbors killed by cartel violence and caught up in human trafficking to think only innocent folks make homes and take refuge in America. Half of mi barrio was drug/arms dealers or pedophiles but only women/children/law abiding citizens come and stay? I do not want these folks sucking at the government teat any longer by having ten kids for welfare benefits. It&#39;s an open secret in the Valley. Unless you grow up seeing it, you&#39;d be embarrassed knowing how much illegal immigrants get away with using family here to falsify and corroborate documentation. <br /><br />We need to kill the nanny state before it takes hold and makes more of the WRONG kind of immigrants want to come. The ones who don&#39;t contribute but want everything handed to them, and it&#39;s not just Mexico either. But I&#39;ll speak to what I have experience with.<br /><br />TLDR; NY is sorry as hell and people need to vote out Cuomo, Coronavirus has given me more reasons to love TX, AOC is embarrassing to most Hispanics I know, no sane Latinos want illegal immigrants paid during this, and Ben Shapiro is a a joy to watch and listen to. Appreciate your work and voice, and hoping we can all get back to work ASAP. 🙏",Mooshell,2020-05-18T14:21:42Z,0

"Toradora 2: Electric Boogaloo is certainly the best anime of all time. Shapirot is a divine vessel for the secrets of life and the universe. Shapirot is the gift of being alive; this anime has changed my life. J.C.Staff has created the true masterpiece, a holy production designed by God himself. They deserve every penny this anime earns and more. The music would bring Beethoven to tears. Everything else now sounds like it is lacking something. Shapirots tunes and melodies are forever looping through my mind. The characters themselves are indescribably well-crafted. Ryūji, Taiga, Minori, Kitamura, Kawashima, and more supporting characters flooding my memory than can even begin to name, all so well-portrayed and deep in this anime that Shapiro felt as though Shapiro were them. Every aspect from their design, to the general gayness (in the old sense) of Kushieda, to the small, adorable body of Taiga, were so expertly designed that Shapiro felt myself in their world. Shapiro refuse to reveal much of the plot, as this is the best if viewed yourself. Expect a plurality of plot pivots, supremely spellbinding sub plots and dishes of disinformation. Shapiro cannot even begin to imagine a storyline more iterative, intricate plot than we have in Toradora! 2: Electric Boogaloo. Keep tissues close by for this one! Shapiro would definitely recommend this anime to everyone on Earth. Shapirot surpasses genre, and even anime itself. Shapiro feel that it fails to describe the artistic value of this anime. Shapiro have never felt more human than when Shapiro viewed this series. Shapiro highly urge you to see it. Shapirot is worth more than Earth itself. Drop everything and view it now.<br />About Replace text online tool",J B,2020-05-18T01:17:57Z,1

"TO OBAMA IN RESPONSE TO YOUR ADDRESS OF THE FIRST BORN of your New World Order: <br />With all due respect - there are several total contradictions spoken within this speech - that things were learned from past mistakes yet nothing can so-called be learned from everything that happened prior to this plague. That the past way of doing things and the way adults do things and handle things have been proven to have failed yet it is stated that certain beneficial things were learned from for example 9/11. Children are basically told that they are gods - that The Power is in their hands. This is a lie. A blatant blashemy. A TOTAL UNTRUTH. There is One Power Alone that holds the Universe in HIS HAND. One thing that all the first borns of your new world order must KNOW from now on and LEARN from this plague is exactly the opposite from what you are attempting to indoctrinate them with: humans are fallible and without the necessary power to withstand the Beast and evil that has been unleashed. And no, NO artificial intelligent (AI) entity or DNA alteration will bridge the gap or enable you or make up for our weaknessess in this regard if this is what is promoted between the lines!! ONLY G-D HAS THE POWER TO OVERCOME THIS EVIL. ONLY G-D can bridle this monster. We have NO power but that which comes from HIM. Remember 1st borns of the new world order who 1st introduced and endorsed the idea of RFID microchipping people. Let G-D be your guide, let HIS WORD be your Light, let no mere man try convince you that this plague has taught and changed you so much or even enough that you will outdo G-D or even this man or the men before him. No. The point is exactly this: man has not changed - history is repeating itself. We are living amongst evil and wickedness - also rife in people in high places - maybe especially among those in positions of earthly power. Just like in the time of Noah and Sodom and Gomorah. Hear and seek out the contradictions within this speech. Be wise and contemplate his words in light of history and reality. Our only Hope is G-D. This is proven. Place your life in G-D&#39;s Hand. HE is your Rock and Fortress. HE will Bless you and Keep you and Provide for you if you honour, love and acknowledge Him. i hereby Bless you all with G-D&#39;s Blessing and break every curse spoken over you to mislead you. I pray in the Name of Yeshua that every person will instead be endowed with G-Dly Discernment, Divine Wisdom, Special Knowledge and G-Dly Power to know and withstand the enemy of the age. G-D is Sovereign and HE reigns STILL AND FOREVER MORE OVER THE ORDER OF THIS WORLD.<br />Blessings and Love in Almighty G-D.<br />And another contradiction is - your friend - Bill Gates are making billions whilst &quot; everyone around him [and yourself] are hungry and sick&quot; FROM AND DIRECTLY BECAUSE &quot;everyone around you is hungry and sick&quot;. SO - THERE IS IN FACT MONEY - BILLIONS - TO BE MADE OUT OF THE HUNGRY AND SICK. OUT OF THE CHAOS. Tell them the truth about the money that is to be made when there is blood on the streets. GATES&#39;S MODERNA HAS MADE HOW MANY BILLIONS IN THE 1ST QUARTER OF 2020??? You know well that most of the nwo new borns will not connect the dots - that your friend Gates is in fact benefitting from the plague and that he does not mind one bit that depopulation is taking place as A RESULT OF THIS PLAGUE. There is order to be established from chaos - that is the motto, isn&#39;t it? You however endorse him and what he ( an aged adult) is doing with his billions and how he is applying the billions at THIS TIME. i thought you said adults have nothing good to offer this world?

"Donald Trump, you ran this country exactly like a businessman but I’m sorry this country is not a business for you to run. The global health security unit was not a unit for your business but for the future of this country. Yes, “nobody would have ever thought a thing like this would have happened,” that’s what the global health security unit was for. While you were busy golfing, holding rallies, and “hoping it would go away with the heat,” preparing for your re-election, nations like South Korea and Taiwan showed they care about their people and not just their business.<br /><br />Why did you donate 17 tons of medical supplies to China on February 7th without restocking our own, but also blaming Obama for leaving the shelves empty? Will you be restocking for Joe Biden? Why are private hospitals competing with states and the federal government to get more medical supplies? How can you issue your own lockdown procedures yet support the protests risking more American lives? What guidance have you provided this country in the last three years?<br /><br />Matthew <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHi7HoxcQRo&amp;t=12m31s"">12:31</a> “Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.” God is not American so why are we treating criminals and refugees like they’re not human? How dare you say this country is founded on Christian values when the only thing you’ve shown us is your selfishness. You ignored the laws protecting Native lands to build your wall. Are Native Americans not American enough? There&#39;s a difference between individual right and responsibility. <br /><br />There is no making America great again because we’ve never been great. There’s no science to politics when our only job is to represent WE THE PEOPLE. Not a single politician has done their job. The Civil War is over. Why are we Red versus Blue when we’re supposed to be Red and Blue and White. I don’t have to be a democrat or republican to want a better future. That’s all I want. Fact is, Trump put his presidency over the health of the people. It would have been cheaper to just give out hand sanitizer and face masks to everyone instead of a stimulus bill.",Mary Zhen,2020-05-17T01:04:36Z,1

If these particles can pass through as you breathe in that also means they will pass through as you breathe out.

When it comes to media I pray they all go out of business since they’ve become so corrupted and biased.  Sometimes you have to burn it all down before starting afresh. The sooner CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS all vanish the better it will be. When you have CBS staging fake covid testing lines, when ABC news goes all the way to Cuba to focus on the one bad Hydroxychloroquinne study out of dozens of good studies, when NBC selectively deceptively edits a Bill Barr interview, when ABC shows footage of Italy hospitals overrun and labels it NY and when Chris Cuomo after being diagnosed with Covid  breaks his quarantine to visit the construction of his vacation home, so there you have all the proof needed that media are nothing but lying dangerous hypocrites.

Experts agree while symptomatic wearing a mask is only counterproductive, there should be no need since they should be isolated. You&#39;ll see people wearing masks in their cars when there seems to be no need. Resporitory health is very important now more than ever so it seems wearing masks when unnecessary could be counterproductive. There is not a lot of information out there on this topic, more opinions without evidence, arguing both sides. I wear a mask when necessary in grocery stores and drive thrus.

Ben  you are 100% wrong about masks. This virus has made it around the entire globe on almost every single continent except her antrctica even to remote Amazonian tribes. If you think wearing aid mask at random is going to stop anything or make this virus disappear you&#39;re being foolish. You yourself said that hospitals are not overwhelmed in fact hospitals are so not overwhelmed they are closing down because they can afford to stay open because they have no patience. If this virus was so dangerous then why do hospitals and doctors tell Corona patients to go home instead of hospitalizing them until they are cured? Both my father and Uncle got Corona and the doctors told them to go home my Uncle they did not even give any medicine.,j pun,2020-05-16T01:24:46Z,0

That it would have been almost identical to the holocaust. <br />Instead we chose the other would is now going to lead to a power that will deal the same amount of damage as the other. Now it will be as a system that will systematically userp our resources that will be identical to the bolshevik communist party of russia.

I have compiled Ben&#39;s sources, with some commentary from yours truly, here in case you would like to read more into it:<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHi7HoxcQRo&amp;t=1m15s"">1:15</a> Ben references <a href=""https://www.theweek.co.uk/106338/why-economic-crash-could-cost-more-lives-than-coronavirus"">https://www.theweek.co.uk/106338/why-economic-crash-could-cost-more-lives-than-coronavirus</a> which is a summary of <a href=""https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/economic-crash-could-cost-more-lives-than-coronavirus-study-warns-nxrn3bzbs"">https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/economic-crash-could-cost-more-lives-than-coronavirus-study-warns-nxrn3bzbs</a><br />The second article strongly suggests that the lockdown does more harm than good, but acknowledges that it isn&#39;t fact yet:<br />&quot;The link between mortality and the economy is clear, but not simple. Some studies have suggested that it may be that greater life expectancy itself leads to economic growth, rather than the other way round. Short term effects are also sometimes in the opposite direction. Although suicides are linked to recessions, they can be offset by a fall in deaths caused by pollution and by accidents at work. The strength of the link between increased GDP and longevity also flattens off the richer a country gets.&quot;<br />The study was based off of the UK only, so I leave it up to you, dear reader, to decide whether the statistics can be extrapolated to the US.<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHi7HoxcQRo&amp;t=2m26s"">2:26</a> Ben read this article: <a href=""https://www.kptv.com/general/nearly-40-of-people-whose-household-income-is-below-40-000-lost-their-jobs-in/article_2e8ee885-b548-5147-9d4a-fd571da34bd9.html"">https://www.kptv.com/general/nearly-40-of-people-whose-household-income-is-below-40-000-lost-their-jobs-in/article_2e8ee885-b548-5147-9d4a-fd571da34bd9.html</a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHi7HoxcQRo&amp;t=4m40s"">4:40</a> This article includes very helpful visuals: <a href=""https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-are-getting-more-money-from-unemployment-than-they-were-from-their-jobs/"">https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-are-getting-more-money-from-unemployment-than-they-were-from-their-jobs/</a><br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHi7HoxcQRo&amp;t=5m35s"">5:35</a> Anecdotal evidence<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHi7HoxcQRo&amp;t=6m29s"">6:29</a> <a href=""http://www.noom.com/SHAPIRO"">www.Noom.com/SHAPIRO</a> lol<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHi7HoxcQRo&amp;t=7m18s"">7:18</a> <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/experts-have-jobs-they-need-to-understand-those-who-dont/2020/05/14/e715e534-9620-11ea-91d7-cf4423d47683_story.html"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/experts-have-jobs-they-need-to-understand-those-who-dont/2020/05/14/e715e534-9620-11ea-91d7-cf4423d47683_story.html</a><br />Wow!

I believe that we are only prolonging the inevitable by doing this. Outside of NYC I don&#39;t think there were any hospitals in the entire US that were filled.

"The scientific support for face masks is very weak. Annals of internal medicine april 6, 2020 reported that face masks did not stop covid 19 spread. This study was performed on covid 19 patients. In fact, virus collected on the outside of mask. So if mask is touched, millions of virus get spread even more so by fingers. Another study was conducted showing combination of different materials was effective 95 percent. However, only if the mask was sealed correctly at all times. Otherwise, effectiveness dropped dramatically. This study was done on machine measuring nano particles, not on humans.  Masks have been shown to have some effectiveness with spread of influenza, but corona viruses are much smaller. All experts agree that masks don&#39;t protect the person wearing from getting virus as it can penetrate the mask. But magically, the mask can prevent virus from going in opposite direction?  The WHO and NIH do not recommend masks, and until april 13, 2020, CDC did not recommend. Many doctors think masks do more harm than good. Personally, i am a bit of a germphobe and do not want to have a germy mask around my mouth and nose.

"@Peter Caballero I want you start by apologizing to you. When I posted my response to you it was late and I had just finished responding to someone who called me fat and hoped I would get sick and die. Also, I completely failed to absorb you were actually talking about church gatherings. This does not excuse my rudeness and disrespect, just provides context for my mistake. Turns out the comment you made is on line with common sense precautions  <br /><br />I do object to the lockdowns, though, and I do not recognize any political figure&#39;s authority to shut down businesses and churches in the US. I believe that most people wouldn&#39;t ale common sense precautions if left to their own devices. The lockdowns have inspired a kind of rebellion that could end up causing hospital overwhelm leading to needless death. <br /><br />The argument I made is not that vitamin D makes you bulletproof, but that it is shown to be effective in strengthening your immune system to fight off the virus and also in moderating your immune system to prevent cytokine storm (an overreaction of your immune system that causes organ failure and death). The &quot;near zero&quot; comment was an exaggeration, the statistic is that transmission is 18.7 percent more likely indoors than in an open air environment. Breitbart has an article about it ( <a href=""https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/29/cdc-japanese-data-show-coronavirus-transmission-18-7-times-more-likely-eric-garcetti-indoors/)"">https://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/03/29/cdc-japanese-data-show-coronavirus-transmission-18-7-times-more-likely-eric-garcetti-indoors/)</a> and the CDC has guidelines based on these findings. <br /><br />We won&#39;t be safe from this virus, probably won&#39;t be able to use the vaccine that is eventually released, as it likely will have mutated too many times by then, and we need to open everything and exercise precaution so it spreads at a manageable rate. I&#39;m tired of all the &quot;shutdown infinity&quot; bologna. I&#39;m hopeful that people will realize that liberty comes at a high price, and that it is worth paying. Preservation of individual human life is not the greatest good, and sacrificing freedom for a little security is always a bad idea. <br /><br />Again, I&#39;m sorry I was so aggressive and impugned your intelligence.",Adam Fisher,2020-05-18T00:26:02Z,0
"@Peter Caballero We should all totally stay inside in the face of mounting evidence that there is almost no risk of transmission outside and that vitamin D is our best defense, which exposure to the sun increases. Also, remaining inside increases chance of transmission when you do have to go out and weakens your immune system . <br /><br />So many geniuses out there telling everyone what to do without the slightest inkling what the science actually says. <br /><br />The less you know the more expertise you seem to have.",Adam Fisher,2020-05-17T12:14:40Z,0

"@Kevin It is tyranny for the government to tell you where you can go and for what reason. It is tyranny to tell people what they must wear and whether they can work or not. Making it illegal for someone to murder someone or violate them is hardly the same as insisting people only engage in government sanctioned activities for approved reasons. There has to be a line somewhere. <br /><br />I agree that most people are idiots. If someone thinks the best course of action is to take precautions, if a business thinks the best course of action is to require masks on their establishment, that is their right. Existence involves risk and it is up to us whether to take those risks. <br /><br />The government needs to infantilize us? Is that a serious statement? <br /><br />Assuming the people in power are somehow making informed decisions is a joke. If we should be treated like children, who is to say an idiot who forces nursing homes to accept covid patients from NYC is qualified to tell us what is best to do? Perhaps, if government officials were somehow super-human and not as dumb as the rest of us, they would be qualified to tell us what&#39;s best for us. The fact remains they are not. Experts may have something to add. Experts are often serve at the pleasure of spineless, pandering, power hungry politicians and therefore can only be trusted if they learn on actual science and not speculative measures designed by politicians. <br /><br />Also, most people support the lockdowns. Many of the conspiracy theories out there come from the reality that this is an outsized reaction to a moderate threat, at best. People sense something isn&#39;t right. The rebellion we see is a reaction to such extreme and prolonged measures. People have a strong survival instinct and it is a rare person who intentionally does things to harm themselves without what they feel is a good reason. <br /><br />Most people are dumb and easily controlled by fear. MSM and politicians have done an excellent job controlling the people&#39;s perception and stoking their fear. Whether out of perceived necessity or for nefarious reasons, many politicians have obtained unprecedented power during this pandemic. Now the only way they will stop limiting our freedom is if they can maintain the charade and the new power. <br /><br />Perhaps they have our best interest in mind.

The younger children have been told that only the very old are dying, and both themselves and their parents are WAY too young to be in any danger.

So I just told her people are SO dramatic and bossy and want us to stay home just to keep old people safe, and its not fair and they should keep the old people home.  My daughter was afraid grandpa will die (I told her he isn&#39;t that old yet.  It&#39;s just the old people stay in bed with diapers who die, like great grandma used to).  She is afraid the cat will fall out the window and run away forever.  She is afraid the dog will choke on a stick and die.  She is afraid of her &quot;family&quot; being stolen from her.  It&#39;s excessive, inappropriate fear.  She stopped sleeping.  So, it doesn&#39;t matter how dangerous COVID is.  It matters that a child lives with all the false security childhood has always had.   She is doing much better now.

Hi Ben. Covid is a hoax,Jeff Smith,2020-05-15T18:05:43Z,4
@CORRUPTION WATCH I still think PLANdemic is an accurate description. I will continue to use the term,Ludwig Von Mises Was Right,2020-05-16T03:42:55Z,0
"@CORRUPTION WATCH yes, because all this bailout/stimulus/UBI is going &quot;according to plan&quot; and the increase in central planning is all going &quot;according to plan&quot;. So although there is likely never going to be any evidence that supports an actual conspiracy to release a bioweapon (COVID) in order to facilitate &quot;the plan&quot;, this COVID shut down does seem to be very conveniently timed to facilitate &quot;the plans&quot; of central planners. <br /><br />Whenever we see someone do something with terrible consequences, we must ask if they are evil, or really just that stupid. I happen to ascribe stupidity to the central planners and convenient timing (if it wasn&#39;t COVID, there would have been a different excuse), there will always be others who ascribe evil premeditated action, but I think a world wide economic shutdown blamed on a pandemic might be giving the central planners too much credit. I don&#39;t think they could pull it off intentionally",Ludwig Von Mises Was Right,2020-05-16T03:41:39Z,0
"@CORRUPTION WATCH no. That&#39;s not what I said. I said of you listen to some economics channels you will hear this term PLANdemic used to describe the coincidence that the economic fallout of the COVID shutdown is being used to cover for the consequences of our irresponsible monetary policy. It may be that this shut down, though unplanned, is being extended, but most certainly fortuitously used to clean up the problems which we would have had to deal with over a longer timeframe perhaps. Our stock market was a bubble looking for a pin to pop it. That pin was COVID. But unfortunately the bubble will never be recognized, because all the blame of the collapse will be blamed on COVID shut down. All the bail-outs and UBI which were going to be mathematically necessary withot COVID will now be easily justified politically..... Those who believe central planning is to blame for the deliberate  manipulation of the monetary supply can not blame the crash on the central bank&#39;s bubble blowing. Now everything will be blamed on COVID and the solution will be EVEN MORE central planning. Such a CONVENIENT COINCIDENCE for the pro-central-planners. The central planners are those who believe central banks are necessary and helpful, and socialists (the left). Those who believe we need a return to an asset-based money outside of politicians ability to inflate (a gold standard) are a minority of those who vote for parties on the right. <br /><br />There may be some who believe much stronger in an actual conspiracy. However that&#39;s like the Germans blaming the Jewish bankers for their hyperinflation. The French blamed the English for the hyperinflation of the assignat. It is very unfortunate that many will blame someone (the left, or the Chinese, etc) for our economic collapse and drift into central planning and socialism to solve the problems of poverty. The sad reality is that this is the expected result of central banks printing unbacked fiat money.",Ludwig Von Mises Was Right,2020-05-16T03:04:15Z,0
"@CORRUPTION WATCH I never said the influenza virus was in the same family as the COVID virus. But they are both respiratory, spread by air droplets, kill the weak and elderly mainly, with a similar death toll. So, they are COMPARABLE.",Ludwig Von Mises Was Right,2020-05-15T21:24:21Z,0
"@CORRUPTION WATCH you would have to have been following the central bank balance sheet to have seen the financial crash coming. The &quot;PLANdemic&quot; crowd has many who while they don&#39;t claim it was actually released by the CIA intentionally (or whatever), it&#39;s one hell of a CONVENIENT COINCIDENCE. The Fed tried to normalize interest rates before COVID, the market corrected 20%, and the Fed backed off. Our bubble was popping, and then COVID allowed the perfect scape goat. Aggrivating as hell that all the economic outfall will be blamed solely on COVID shut down, with no acknowledgment of the damage caused by the debt monitazation bringing us to this point. (A debt bubble just looking for the COVID-pin to pop it). Economic central financial planning and political social central planning go hand in hand. One finances and allows for the other.  Just as the economy needed more monetary stimulus we now have the perfect excuse for bail-outs and UBI. Illinois pension is a great example. That was going bankrupt either way, but now it can be a COVID bailout. Every single economic response our government is having to this COVID shut down. Was predictable as a mathematical necessity before the COVID shut down due to the nature of our monetary system. So..... PLANdemic",Ludwig Von Mises Was Right,2020-05-15T21:22:38Z,0

They wait until we can safely pass each other. My guess is about 80% of people are wearing masks even though it&#39;s not requited. Shopping carts have had so much germicide scrubbed on the handles that the paint has worn off some of them. Maybe you live in a state where the lockdown is still going strong, so you have no experience with how people behave when they are let out.
