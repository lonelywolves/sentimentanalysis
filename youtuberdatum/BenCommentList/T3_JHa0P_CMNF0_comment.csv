These are likely a similar type of person who says that people shouldn&#39;t celebrate when Osama Bin Laden or Fidel Castro died because they were human but when a guy who at worse said some mean things dies they celebrate because he may not have approved of their lifestyle,AndroidOfIceAndFire,2021-05-08T23:43:39Z,0

I am a Centrist, but I’m neither left or right, but rather a concept where I form an opinion on who is better based on the current situation, refusing to be biased and own up to my mistakes if somebody notices them, like if I am hypocritical on something.

"May he rest in peace, and may only good things be remembered about him.  <br /><br />Mr. Limbaugh was not a gracious man, however, in certain situations. For example, he reacted viciously when Ted Kennedy died from brain cancer, and when Paul Wellstone&#39;s life came to an untimely end due to an airplane going down. Those are only two examples. He found it almost impossible to be magnanimous or gracious (at least publicly). <br /><br />Two wrongs do not make a right. To pretend that Mr. Limbaugh was a gentleman, though, might not be exactly a fair characterization. He was not a nice man, at least not publicly. He was no Donald Trump, (who, on the contrary, actually is gracious both in  public and in private life). <br /><br /><br />Let President Trump&#39;s grace be showered upon Mr. Limbaugh, and may mercy be shone upon his memory, no matter how he conducted himself, in this physical world. There are much, much worse things in this world than simply being a mean person. We can afford to be gracious towards his memory.  <br /><br />Thanks for the content.<br />Keep up the good work.  בס״ד",Kelikaku Coutin,2021-02-26T20:22:46Z,0

"The left - including leftist-biased media &quot;reporters&quot; and commentators - see it as their job to twist and distort and misrepresent everything in sight (including employing outright fabrications). And, OF COURSE, this is especially true with their treatment of anyone and everyone who dares to open their mouths and criticize and oppose leftist ideology. So that goes especially for someone like Rush Limbaugh. I was never a &quot;dittohead&quot; or a fan of Limbaugh, but at the same time he had a lot of good ideas, and back in the 1980s (when I started listening to his program occasionally) he was one of the very few in the media who articulated them. Leftist practice back then - and even much more so today - was to demonize everyone who disagreed with them. Rush routinely exposed the two-faced, double-standards nature of leftist rhetoric, over three decades ago. It&#39;s merely amusing how Shapiro here does exactly the same thing of exposing the utterly two-faced nature of leftist rhetoric in their demonization of Rush Limbaugh, one of the arch-critics of the left.",Steve Greene,2021-02-25T05:24:35Z,0

"I am an ex democrat, ex evolutionist, ex liberal. Now the liberals are no longer simple liberals (Actually I had to reclaim the Liberal label, because the Founders were Classical Liberals, meaning they had a broad education in multiple subjects, so they were truly open minded and worked very hard on a Governmental system that would work, , but the failure comes from the loss of virtue and honesty and duty in our culture, a long story. The liberals of today should be renamed the lefties, because that&#39;s what they really are). <br /> Anyhow, my re education had to do with moving to one of the most conservative counties in CA, which included being exposed to talk radio, which included Rush, but also, Michael Reagan, Dr Laura, Dr John Coleman, , Mark Levin, Michael Savage, Travis T Hipp, which came over to Carson City from Gilroy and KFAT radio, whom I used to listen to when I lived in Santa Cruz. Was I ever amazed to hear him over here,  explaining the real meaning of the Second Amendment. I was hooked. The Sentimental lefties I had associated with in Santa Cruz never tried to explain the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. These were not important in their consciousness. <br />   Now , as much as I admire Rush, I have to share my sadness that he died because of ignoring certain health principles because of his own arrogance. He accused organic food advocates as being arrogant and &quot;jerks&quot;. His study on organic food only included proving that vegetarians are all more likely to be jerks. And that was that. There was no looking at the higher nutrient levels in organic food. There was no looking at studies on the Round Up levels in conventional foods and the lawsuits that hugely won the victims billions of dollars because they were able to legally prove Round Up had caused cancer in their bodies. There are ongoing studies showing that minute levels of Round Up (ppb) do various levels and types of damage at the cellular level. He didn&#39;t bother studying the victims of dead and denatured foods who have turned their lives around because they changed their diets. (or even vegans who almost killed themselves with B12 deficiency and MS [the symptoms list is the same] )There are many of those on YT and Rumble. He didn&#39;t bother to know that the Paleo diet is NOT a vegan diet. He did not bother studying any of the Weston Price materials where was documented the profound health of cultures all over the world that ate 80% of their calories in saturated animal fats and the rest in meats, organ meats, raw dairy, and saturated fats of palm and coconut oils. He never bothered finding out what the real effects of various foods really were. Instead he stubbornly and proudly proclaimed he would refuse to eat all such health foods. He refused supplements. He didn&#39;t bother to study those. This makes me very sad because he was worth keeping around and he was worth keeping healthy.  My own husband has been a devout junkaholic, but has allowed me to nag him to take his vitamins every day. And I don&#39;t mean the crappy Centrum which mostly consists of talcum powder. i mean the green kind, optimal doses, the very yellow and smelly B complex, in optimal doses. And he has done this for 17 years to humor me. Because I don&#39;t want him to die. I want him around for as long as I can. And it has worked. Now he finally gotten off soda. And that&#39;s a big thing. Now he has dropped 50 lbs off his 350 total he has been since we met. And I have added tyrosine for his thyroid, and the AMPK activators and these seem to have helped immensely. Now he suddenly has decided the nutrients are worth it. He still eats too much refined flour, (pizza) and some such, but not as bad, Next trick is to get off the PUFA oils, that is replacing grain oils, with butter, lard, coconut oil, palm oil, tallow. Yes THOSE are the healthy oils. Too bad Rush didn&#39;t know that. He might not have been so stubborn if he had known rare beef and butter was good for him. But the Round Up in the rest of the foods, those are the killers and look to be one of the main factors of 75% of Americans having gut problems. They may not be gluten intolerant, they may be Round Up intolerant. Moms Across America has articles on this, Food Babe has articles on this. Stephanie Seneff has loads of research on this.",whisperingsage,2021-02-22T18:55:16Z,0

So he tried to display what he was seeing by acting out Fox&#39;s movements.<br />Of course the media knew this, but only showed him doing that and claiming he was making fun of him.

I cannot blame the world for acting like the world. Expecting them to behave like men of God isn’t a reasonable expectation. Rush will be remembered by those who loved him and loved to listen to him. He gave a voice to the voiceless in this country. He was  wonderful and flawed man. Few men would go on radio and admit they had a painkiller problem. Most would do what celebrities do and just take time off and tell people they were “on vacation” but Rush didn’t do that. He spoke plainly and honestly to us and this had a HUGE impact on me growing up in the late 80’s and early 90’s. Rush will always be larger than life to me.

An insurrection that Limbaugh lived long enough to witness and enjoy.<br /><br />At the same time, he lived long enough to see this approach, which was purified and magnified by the most recent Republican Party President, cost the GOP, for which he was aligned, the White House and both Houses of Congress in a single term.<br /><br />Despite these setbacks and his medical condition, Limbaugh never reflected on the effects on his words and actions of 3 decades and, true to form, spent his final days pushing the biggest lie of all, which has divided the country even further.

"I&#39;m glad Rush isn&#39;t suffering anymore and I wouldn&#39;t say for him to rot in hell.  That&#39;s despicable.  But he said, loosely quoting, we &quot;weren&#39;t ready&quot; for a gay president in Pete Buttigieg and he touted Trump&#39;s undoubtedly racist birther theory.  He, at least, spewed bigoted ideas.<br /><br />With that said, before anyone who may find this and finds me to be a &quot;snowflake&quot; or &quot;woke&quot; or of course &quot;liberal,&quot; I hate CNN and MSNBC.  I hate elitist media that only shows half the &quot;truth,&quot; if you can even call it that much.  The left does indeed have a virtual monopoly over the mainstream media, which I can&#39;t stand.<br /><br />Fact is, both people like Rush Limbaugh and Michael Moore have contributed to the division that made Trump&#39;s presidency possible.  I don&#39;t understand the right&#39;s hatred for the Fairness Doctrine.  The Doctrine is only logical and would hold both &quot;sides&quot; accountable for what they convey to the masses.<br /><br />The left and right are both horrible, in my very humble view.

"Three simple facts. First; We have been dehumanized, which is precisely what Hitler did to the jews to justify his attempted extermination of them. Second; We are being abused, research and studies show that abusers never stop until they under go and complete therapy, that abuse always escalates, and that the abuser eventually murders their victims given enough time. IE, they are never going to stop, and this is the nicest they will ever be to us, even if we comply. Third; The left despises the laws of God, so this makes it truly possible they are the son of perdition, just without a head yet, pay attention to which world leaders pope fransis exalts the most. This being said, the left would never have risen had we been watchful, and we ourselves remembered the ways of God. We built homes and businesses of glory and treasures, but let his house crumble around us. If we are to fight the left, we ought to rebuild his house to it&#39;s former glory, and seek once again after the face of God.",MrSpiritchild,2021-02-19T06:20:07Z,1

"Thank you Ben, you are truly an arbiter of truth in this doomed world. I cannot stress enough how evil some people are acting in response to Rush’s death. Just because Rush was arguably a piece of shit doesn’t mean the rest of us have to be. I literally saw one brave soul stand up to these bastards, telling them Rush was a father and a husband, basically a human being. He was immediately met with the most evil replies, one saying that “If his family misses him so much they why don’t they join him?” Awful thing to say about those who’ve done nothing wrong. His transgressions aren’t theirs, and visa-versa, and even if that weren’t the case, why should anyone treat others so awfully?

Honestly it was heartbreaking both for my own memories, and because I knew Shapiro likely doesn&#39;t know that patients with cancer and other serious illnesses often have spikes in ammonia levels that affect cognition and emotions. Rush seemed to be in that state at that moment, and was likely genuinely surprised and honored. Dad had the same look of disbelief at a comment made or simple daily activities that he ordinarily would have been quick to interpret and respond to. At one point in Rush&#39;s career I would never have believed that I would actually shed tears for him. In the end, he did so very much to redeem himself by his gracious willingness to be more open, more tactful, and more humble.

The generosity of Rush was tremendous. He raised millions and and millions of dollars for many causes. He donated millions of his own money as well. It was continuous and joyously. He produced children&#39;s books to be sure true American history was not forgotten and was established in a generation being lied to and not taught our major events. He loved this nation greatly and the people most of all. Ditto Rush! We will never forgot how great you are and have been for us. Our sorrow now is great You have left a great hole in our hearts. There will never be another like you. How blessed we were to have heard you every day for a generation.,SD,2021-02-19T00:14:58Z,0

Great video but I got a question. Ben sayed Media  back in 80s were left leaning like they are know. So did media hate Ronald Regan? Regan was very popular and won both of his elections by landslides. So was media against Regan in 80s like they were Trump?,Austin Roberts,2021-02-19T00:12:09Z,0
"The media hated Ronald Reagan.  They considered him a &quot;bumbling dottering old fool&quot; who had his finger on the nuclear button.  The media claimed that Reagan didn&#39;t do enough for AIDS victims and the homeless.  The media claims that the Cold War was won by Gorbachov.  Look up &quot;Gorbasms&quot; (thank you Rush, RIP). But Renaldus Magnus was able to go around the media, and speak directly to the American People.  The media is ALWAYS against Republican presidents, Nixon, Ford, Bush 41, Bush 43 and Trump.  The media has lied to the American people since at least since 1945, not informing us that Roosevelt was crippled.",Steven Reed,2021-02-19T01:55:32Z,2
"CONCERNING MICHAEL J. FOX... It&#39;s very instructive to compare Rush Limbaugh&#39;s words when Fox&#39;s condition was a new and novel thing to most Americans, including Rush, with Larry David&#39;s lampooning the same condition of Fox on CURB YOUR ENTHUIASM. As Ben Shapiro points out, CNN&#39;s outburst against Limbaugh was savage and unrelenting whereas concerning Larry David (a Liberal among Liberals) nary a peep. Watch how CNN eulogizes the bigoted anti Semite Jimmy Carter. Along with Barak Obama, arguably one of the worst Presidents in recent American history. By taking the side of the &quot;palestinians&quot; against the State of Israel, Carter blackened the White House&#39;s reputation as none had done before. CNN is truly a cesspool of hypocrisy and ALL employees working for that network wear a badge of shame. RUSH LIMBAUGH...ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICANS IN MY LIFETIME. ( And funny too!).

@Donald Carey Yup. That&#39;s why I know the facts like AG Barr was ordered by 45 to have Epstein murdered and make it look like a suicide.

I still have them! One of the things I remember most about Rush was, and it is not to say others did not do this before him, he was the first person I remember in my lifetime it would play video clips of politicians contradicting themselves. President Clinton would say that he had never supported whatever caused it was. Then Rush would pull out a clip from 1986 where President Clinton, then Governor Clinton, was supporting exactly what today he was saying that he never supported. I think he showed that that could be a very effective tactic when trying to fight for truth!

From Romans 1: &quot;Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.&quot; In other places, God portrays himself as crushing such reprobates beneath his feet in gleeful joy.<br /><br />So, I doubt God himself considers such words to be particularly sinful.<br /><br />But obviously you&#39;re coming from a different framework of thought and would likely mock my own--which would give me joy and make me laugh, and validate me greatly.",Texas Jack,2021-02-18T23:52:26Z,0

"@brian6speed Not true at all I am all over the right and I openly looked for that.  The worst thing the right said was &quot;she should have retired under Obama so Trump wouldn&#39;t have gotten to replace her&quot;.  They blamed her for not retiring which maybe is a good or a bad point but that&#39;s all I saw I swear.  I even tried to watch an RGB documentary but sadly it was way too political not at all like Ken Burns who covers things much more neutrally I liked his documentary on the Roosevelts a lot and not just Teddy FDR was a real boss and even Eleanor was a unique good woman.  That&#39;s all I wanted to know was the facts not bs like the RBG docu you should check it out it&#39;s the 3 hour one.  They spend the first 10 minutes not talking about RBG or her parents or family but literally playing clips of people like Rush disagreeing with her like &quot;oh no you can&#39;t dare disagree with a woman who later died&quot;.  Please.<br />@Tabby Reed No your hatred is all internal.  I have 0 hate for Attilla the Hun or Mussolini or even Abraholf Lincler.  Who you hate says everything about you and nothing about the person you hated or are racists right to hate dark skinned people?  &quot;Well you caused more crime that&#39;s why I hate you.&quot;  That&#39;s extremely short sighted and low of you.  Even if the right is &quot;evil&quot; you should be trying to help them not condemn them.  I&#39;m old enough to remember when we were supposed to try and rehabilitate extremist muslims back into society instead of persecute them.  White boiz though?

"the only way to truly pay our respects to the radio host, who reached more than 15 million listeners during his 30-year talk radio career, is to remember exactly who he was and the legacy he left behind— one of divisiveness, cruelty, racism, homophobia, bigotry, and sexism. This was prejudice and callousness that he not only encouraged but reveled in.<br />     it was Limbaugh’s open embrace of full-blown white supremacy that worked to shape the right-wing media as it is known today. <br /><br /><br />The harm Limbaugh caused during his career is vast and difficult to quantify, but it can be seen in nearly every facet of our current political climate. He intentionally harmed marginalized communities. He sowed division with cold-hearted precision. He upheld the tenets of white supremacy, bigotry, and sexism that persists today.

The MCLEF is an organization that supports the children of law enforcement officers or Marines killed in the line of duty.<br /><br />In 2019, Limbaugh had donated $5 million in proceeds to the Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation that paid off the mortgages of six widows of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. <br /><br />In 2018, Limbaugh gave half a million dollars to the Dana Farber Cancer Clinic. <br /><br />In 2007, Limbaugh matched an online donation for a letter he auctioned off, donating $8.4 million to the MCLEF.<br /><br />Between 2005 and 2020, Limbaugh made undisclosed but significant contributions to Move America Forward (care packages for military servicemen and women), Michael Milken and the Prostate Cancer Foundation, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Els for Autism, Fisher Houses, Navy SEALs Museum, Toys for Tots, American Heritage Girls, and Adopt-a-Soldier programs.<br /><br />John Rich in a tweet; When I was on Celebrity Apprentice, Rush Limbaugh made a donation of $100,000 dollars to St Jude Children&#39;s Hospital to support them, and my mission on the TV Show under the condition that he remained anonymous. I never said a word until now. He will be missed.<br /><br />Jack Posobiec said after Rush died;  Not seeing anyone post this, but Rush raised $47 million for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society over the course of his radio show in annual telethons with matching donations<br /><br />Rush Limbaugh donated near 15% of his yearly salary to ONE charity one year...<br /><br /><br />The list can go on and on....<br /><br />I listen to his radio broadcast and his generosity was powerfully evident....I was not a die hard listener, he gave away countless things, recently iPads, iPhones, books, money, and help to individuals....continuously and very frequently...He wasn’t vocal about his generosity either....but he did a lot more then his radio show....like him or not...many people are more then just conservative or liberal....I would expect Rush Limbaugh is a hero to countless people who he impacted by his generosity and caring through this entire life...like it or not he is a role model....a flawed person as we are all, but an extremely generous and caring man that touched the lives of many many people in need.

"@T L I totally agree, there is much these days that are taken out of context, or edited to fit the narrative and worse, people are &quot;cancelling&quot; those that may have said something or posted something 10-20 years ago, few are they same people they were 20 years ago.  It&#39;s the climate and too much entitlement going around these days.  Whatever the reason for this cancel culture, it is beyond out of hand, they are literally playing with people&#39;s lives, livelihoods, relationships, children, it is absolutely insane, it is the ABSOLUTE WORST form of BULLYING I&#39;ve ever witnessed.  <br /><br />I&#39;m old enough and set, that I could care less what whether someone is offended by my mere existence (it seems that is all it takes anymore).  I treat people the way I would like to be treated, believe in kindness and compassion the latter to an extent, sometimes it teeters on the line of compassion an pity.  I believe no one should define, validate or determine yourself worth but you.  Those that try to do so are looking for power over you, pure and simple.<br /><br />I&#39;m all for confronting these cancel culture cowards, because that is what they are!

"@60 Something Although doing that was wrong, I&#39;m glad he apologized. Anyone dying shouldn&#39;t be mocked regardless of their beliefs or lifestyle. Everyone says and does things they regret and that just reaffirms to me Rush was a good man by apologizing and stopping that segment. One of the many things that frustrates me is when people have hate for Rush for things the media has said he said when edited and taken out of context. I hate that when it&#39;s done with anyone to promote dislike for that person or their views. It works against us all because there is mistrust and stops productive dialogue between people with different beliefs and creates barriers. Q",T L,2021-02-22T19:57:13Z,1
"@T L Rush did have a mocking segment on his show for about 2 weeks, where he read off the names of gays that died of aids to music, like &quot;I&#39;ll never love this way again&quot; as an example.  He stated that after he realized how heinous their deaths were, he regretted having done the shows and had stopped them.  People still had issues with him, because he wasn&#39;t in favor of same sex marriages and he claimed that &quot;transgenders&quot; had mental or emotional issues.   Not a popular stance, however, but I believe everyone is entitled to their opinions and beliefs.  The balance is or should be that standing up for your rights and beliefs doesn&#39;t mean you get to deprive others of theirs.",60 Something,2021-02-22T02:24:13Z,0

People make mistakes and learn from them - that’s commendable.   It’s hard to look anywhere in the media and see integrity, class and positivity anymore.  Just like social media, everyone is awful to each other.  Its disheartening to see joy at anyone’s death, no matter who it is and who’s saying it.

"@Isokuovi You just don&#39;t get it. You are still saying that my comment about some members of the left was a strawman. Look at your definition of strawman. It talks about a position in an ARGUMENT that is made to defeat an opponents ARGUMENT. Like I told you at the beginning, what I said can&#39;t be a strawman because I wasn&#39;t arguing with anyone. I wasn&#39;t arguing with OP. They said something negative about the left and so did I. What I said can be called stupid. It can be called dumb. It can be disagreed with. It can be called silly. It can be called untrue. But calling it a strawman made no sense because what I said was not some fallacy or false equivalency thrown back at someone to counter what they said! It was just my own statement! I wasn&#39;t in a damn argument to strawman anybody. I just commented about the looters. It wasn&#39;t &quot;a proposition set up to defeat an opponents ARGUMENT because THERE WAS NO OPPONENT. THERE WAS NO ARGUMENT.<br /><br />If you disagree with what I said, fine! Cool! But you called it a strawman, and I said it is not, and then you proceeded to assume that I&#39;m a know it all or whatever.<br /><br />People throw the term strawman around and sometimes it just doesn&#39;t make sense in the context it is used. I am not going to explain this to you anymore. This is sad. Like really pathetic and sad. We are both wasting our time. Let&#39;s cut our losses and agree we both are losers cause we both wasted time typing novels to each other, ok? Have a nice night. I stand by my original point which I believe if you read through our conversation, you will understand. If you think what I said was dumb, fair enough. I say a lot of dumb stuff, trust me. I just don&#39;t feel that strawman fit. I&#39;m sorry I called you a crybaby. Have a good night.",Meatball,2021-02-20T01:29:16Z,0
"@Meatball Except, I have now explained to you twice, following the definition of the term &quot;straw-man&quot; to a T, how my application of the term was warranted and you still keep rolling back with &quot;oh but it still doesn&#39;t make sense&quot; without even bothering to tell me how I&#39;m wrong.<br /><br />Straw-man:<br /><br />&quot;an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent&#39;s real argument.&quot;<br /><br />You said that &quot;the left pissed on George Floyd&#39;s grave&quot;. You said that my argument was &quot;just incorrect&quot;. You <b>cannot</b> tell me that is not misrepresentation at its finest.<br /><br />You haven&#39;t proved me wrong on anything, just look back through this conversation&#39;s history and have a look for yourself. I proved you wrong twice, and both times you conveniently ignored it. And now your defense is to call me a whiney baby. I&#39;m not crying, I&#39;m not whining. It seems to me that you are more worked up than I am, considering the fact I have told you 3 times to stop responding and your masculinity is so threatened that you feel the need to keep messaging. So I&#39;ll do one better, and I will stop responding because apparently, that&#39;s too tough for you to do. Grow up, honestly.",Isokuovi,2021-02-20T01:10:12Z,0
"@Isokuovi I explained exactly why you didn&#39;t make sense with your straw man comment. And you felt the need to cry and whine that I am self absorbed for just defending myself and telling you you were wrong. I corrected you so therefore I am self absorbed. Which also makes no sense. I have never spoken to such a gigantic whiney crybaby. Sorry for telling you you were wrong, I had no idea I would wound you so badly. Next time you wanna make some witty comment, stfu instead.",Meatball,2021-02-20T00:50:17Z,0
"@Meatball No, you are right. If I had embarrassed myself by trying to correct you, that wouldn&#39;t make you self absorbed. But that isn&#39;t what happened. What happened was that you dismissed everything I had to say there because of your preconceived notion that you are always right about everything, therefore you apparently feel you can ignore my argument without even listening to it - strawman. Literally, all your comebacks so far have been &quot;because you don&#39;t make sense&quot; without even having the inclination to bother to tell me why I apparently &quot;don&#39;t make sense&quot;.<br /><br />Again, stop responding. I don&#39;t wanna hear it from an ignorant, self absorbed asshole like you.",Isokuovi,2021-02-20T00:32:28Z,0
@Isokuovi You embarrassing yourself by trying to correct me and making no sense doesn&#39;t make me self absorbed. But you just say stuff you don&#39;t know the meaning of so I get why you said that. Cause you make no sense.,Meatball,2021-02-20T00:18:20Z,0
