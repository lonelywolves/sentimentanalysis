"I appreciate the diplomacy of Dan Crenshaw but as an older, former USAF pilot I think he&#39;s not experienced the evolution of leftism in this country. <br />Although there have been cycles the pendulum swings in both sides of this debate, I would argue that where conservatives by definition have remained grounded, leftists have moved <b>progressively</b> further and further to the extreme. As a result, the perspective of someone who has not seen two periods of civil unrest like the younger generation is necessarily less experienced.",John Resler,2020-11-05T01:10:15Z,0

After I retired I was in a political science course where the professor began to crow about what HE did during Vietnam. As he puffed up we locked eyes. In that moment he KNEW I was a viet vet and he back off the comment. Afterward we became friends so I let him live 😷,rr01,2020-09-11T05:56:18Z,0

"Just a cool dude to interview. <br /><br /><br />In my opinion Mr. Crenshaw encapsulates what I desire in a man that I&#39;d vote for in a President: not only a good leader, but a good man who has experienced the world (especially the bad!) and still wishes to put his people first.<br />Just looking at his Twitter account, for example, where he posts commonsense explanations for the things he&#39;s supporting or standing against, and we have an evolution of Trump&#39;s candid Twitter nature tempered with class and clear language.<br /><br /><br />The way things are going I&#39;m very likely to vote Trump in 2020 (and with how smart Mr. Crenshaw is I doubt he&#39;ll want to make any waves in relation to people leaning towards Trump), but if he runs in 2024 or afterwards I&#39;ll be leaning towards him.",Derek Baumgartner,2019-03-08T13:55:02Z,0

"The great thing about the USA, unlike other Socialistic countries, is that if you don&#39;t like being here you can leave.  People from other countries leave all the time because they don&#39;t like being there.  If it is so bad being in the USA, leave!  Unlike others who flee their country due to oppression, poverty and a slew of other reasons, Americans complain, yet they know deep down (probably not that deep) they have it better here than anywhere else (period).  Be gay in a Muslim county see where that gets you.  Talk back to your country&#39;s leads in China, North Korea, Cuba or back in the day of the USSR see where you end up.

"PRAYING Jesus Christ, Jesus show yourself mighty to your people, Lord there seems to be no way out, no way to fix things, no ways of solution, but Jesus you are the solution, you are the truth, you are the love and forgiveness, you are the author and finisher of all great things. Jesus if you can raise a nation up and take it down in a day, then Jesus can you not heal our nation and our people.Yes you can,we praise the name of Jesus. Jesus, quickly reveal yourself to us, that is best for each one of us, touch us the only place that you know and can touch, Jesus can you not minister individually to each person, the only way that they can be ministered to,. Jesus are you not greater than any and all calamity and evil, Jesus where a man sees no way out, your spirit testifies that you Jesus, you are the only way out. Jesus you are the author and finisher of all things, great and small. Jesus help us receive your perfect and perfecting love and forgiveness of the cross. Jesus you told me that if we could fully receive and understand the love and forgiveness of the cross, we would be transformed as a new spirit, a useful witness for Christ Jesus. Jesus we pray that you answer this prayer, that we receive THE FULL PORTION,of your perfect love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ.Jesus we praise your perfect love and forgiveness. Jesus we pray for personal and professional revival Lord Jesus not only does it have to happen in our heart, it has to happen in our family and in our workplace,,, Lord bring us to where your people are, there&#39;s no greater ministry then in our own families in our own workplace, Jesus show us the way to your fullness. Jesus you said, to pray for the greatest gift to prophesy to strengthen, encourage and comfort our people, to help raise them up. Jesus we repent of godless chatter, a lack of faith. Jesus we need the faith the size of a mustard seed to plant our faith at the altar,Jesus you will grow our faith. Jesus help us be the great communicators of your love and forgiveness, your faithfulness. Jesus Christ we pray that you come quickly, we need you and praise your mighty name, Jesus our Lord and Savior. Jesus come quickly, Jesus we cry out for repentant heart and spirit, seeking the perfect love and forgiveness, found only in Christ Jesus. Jesus is not the simple gospel, can be as simple as, the perfect and perfecting love and forgiveness of Jesus Christ. Jesus is this not available to all people saved and unsaved. Jesus we pray for this great awakening, correction, direction pointing to Christ Jesus, as Lord and Savior. The name of Jesus is above all names, the name of Jesus identifies the God we serve, the God that can save, forgive us of our sins, and love us into eternity now and forever. Jesus cannot the zeal of the Lord accomplish this great revival, harvest this great harvest and free our people, from captivity of the world and the evil one. Jesus not all is lost, but always gained, we hear that this is the greatest time and harvest, that the world will ever see. Jesus, Jesus, quickly come. Jesus we are standing in victory and not in defeat, because the victory was won on the cross let us praise your great name the name above all names, Christ Jesus our Savior and Lord, amen and amen.

"That was my thought too. He&#39;s new to Congress and still only at a low level so he certainly hasn&#39;t seen everything and he definitely comes across as one of the extremely rare politicians who can&#39;t be bought so all groups who try to buy politicians with these backroom and under the table deals haven&#39;t bothered approaching him which is why he thinks it&#39;s just money from super pacs influencing things. I mean how else does everyone in congress manage to become multimillionaires because their salaries sure as hell don&#39;t account for it and that&#39;s just the wealth they have on the books. Look at Joe Biden, he and his wife&#39;s net worth is apparently only $900,000 according to tax records which is pure bullshit when he gets paid $500,000 a time to speak at a banker&#39;s dinner. The Syria stuff too he&#39;s quite naive about, the main reason why terrorists were able to take so much ground in Syria is because politicians like Obama and McCain were arming them hoping to use them as a tool for regime change against Assad, who is not an enemy of the US and does not want terrorists operating in his country. And then if all had gone to plan with ISIS overthrowing Assad the (corrupt establishment) US government would have an excuse to start another war in Syria getting big payoffs from the military industrial complex eventually setting up their own puppet government in Syria and building a big oil pipeline through it from Iraq helping to propup the petrodollar.",EvidensInsania,2019-03-03T18:27:10Z,0

"Let me put a finer point on Crenshaw&#39;s claim about how Democrats don&#39;t know what Republicans actually believe:<br /><br /><br />Jonathan Haidt did a study (linked below) where he found, in his words, &quot;...we tested how well liberals and conservatives could understand each other. We asked more than two thousand American visitors to fill out the Moral Foundations Qyestionnaire. One-third of the time they were asked to fill it out normally, answering as themselves. One-third of the time they were asked to fill it out as they think a “typical liberal” would respond. One-third of the time they were asked to fill it out as a “typical conservative” would respond... Moderates and conservatives were most accurate in their predictions, whether they were pretending to be liberals or conservatives. Liberals were the least accurate, especially those who described themselves as “very liberal.&quot; The biggest errors in the whole study came when liberals answered the Care and Fairness questions while pretending to be conservatives.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><a href=""https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050092"">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050092</a>",Pensive,2019-03-03T14:21:41Z,26

"@David MN3 Z1 We hear a lot about the American right to bear arms here in Germany and everyone dislikes it here. The only way here to shoot with a real gun, is when you are in the military, or police.<br />Like I said, I like guns and I am also for the right to bear arms. However, one should must prove, that someone is a good citizen and can handle a gun, before he is allowed to buy one. <br />That&#39;s my opinion for that matter.",Revolver Ocelot1988,2019-03-04T11:23:46Z,0

"@David MN3 Z1 I took the name, because of a character in Metal Gear Solid, I like. <br />To answer your question, yes, I like guns. I served in the German Army (Bundeswehr) for two years and used a lot of Heckler&amp;Koch guns and I loved it. Guns are illegal here for private persons. I think, that everyone should be allowed to bear arms to protect his/her home, family and himself/herself. But I also think, that you need to proof, that you are capable of handling arms and to be a good citizen.
