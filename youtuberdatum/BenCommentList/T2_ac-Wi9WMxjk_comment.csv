If BLM DID reimburse the city, then every organization should be able to have their own message painted wherever they feel it would do the most &quot;good&quot; for their cause (i.e. &quot;LIVE FREE OR DIE&quot; painted in front of Deblasio&#39;s house by the Tea Party).  <br />3)  Failure to adhere to #2 should trigger a First Amendment suit against the city (suppression of speech) and a Civil Rights suit (based on race).",Stan Bartsch,2020-07-15T15:40:56Z,0

"I think teachers who have conditions who make it risky for them to be at work should get temporary disability from their physicians so they can get benefits until conditions change. That said, I don&#39;t see any good reason for schools (or...any institution) not to reopen now. The main reason certain people are standing against reopening schools is because when they reopen, teachers who don&#39;t want to or can&#39;t work won&#39;t be able to collect unemployment anymore, so some of them will have to make some tough decisions, like our other essential workers had to.",deepwildviolet,2020-07-14T19:27:39Z,1

I&#39;m not on the left and i don&#39;t think you can blame Cuomo for what he did with care homes. Here in the UK the rabid leftists are making the same attacks on Boris for his policy on care homes. The fact is that care homes are not run by the state and they should have taken their own precautions.,ME 0020,2020-07-14T18:10:48Z,1
"COMMON SENSE IS OPENING UP STATES IN PHASES ACCORDING TO THE EXPERT&#39;S GUIDELINES. TRUMP AND REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS (with Ben&#39;s blessing) DID NOT DO THAT. NOW WE ARE IN BIG TROUBLE. COMMON SENSE IS NOT INJECTING YOURSELF WITH HAND SANITIZER AS TRUMP SUGGESTED. COMMON SENSE IS ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE, BANNING THE ASSAULT WEAPON. SO, either GENIUS Ben either has no common sense, or he supports the Republicans solely so he can get the tax cut for the rich. and if that is the case, THAT WOULD MAKE RICH, GREEDY, SMUG, ARROGANT, NON CARING BEN A FUCKING ASSHOLE. You decide. Is Ben a moron with no common sense or is an asshole. Trump is both.",Kevin Hays,2020-07-14T18:09:18Z,0
