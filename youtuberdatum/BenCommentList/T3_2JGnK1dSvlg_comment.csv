I am tired of this shit. If you wish to eliminate the mass shootings provide a deterrent. Make it uncomfortable for people that perpetrate these heinous acts. What these people understand is not the coddling by the media and their 2 weeks of fame. What I favor is if tried and convicted of mass shootings or drive by shootings or random shootings then they are sentenced to execution by flamethrower. This would make the act uncomfortable. I know it is still not the total answer but it sends as definite message other that taking weapons from people that would never even think of doing this anyway.,Michael Marsden,2021-03-27T14:56:22Z,0

People too stupid to understand that criminals aren&#39;t giving their guns up. They will destroy America, destroy the economy both creating a desperate population,  then reduce police, encourage violence and dehumanize white people calling them Nazis, racist, and terrorists opening up the doors for attack, then take away your ability to defend yourself.

"I think every culture has its blind spot.  In the USA, it is the alignment of gun rights with a conservative view point.  I grew up in a household with guns and when our conservative Prime Minister introduced gun control after a massacre in Tasmania (Australia) in 1996 where 35 people were killed by someone with an arsenal of high powered weapons I was opposed at the time.  But history has shown  that we have had very few of the types of massacres that occur regularly in the USA. Looking from the outside now, it is a no-brainer.  The USA has a large number of these massacres because high powered automatic weapons are seen as a constitutional right.  The obvious point to make is that the Constitution was written at a time when guns were single shot and only allowed for a few shots per minute.  My humble view is that this is a blind spot in the  conservative position in the USA and they should modify their position and promote laws that limit the availability of high-powered automatic weapons, or the killings will continue.",Mark Southern,2021-03-27T00:08:39Z,0

Background checks do not work, mental illness is not that easy to be determined. I come from Europe where in my country obviously, we do not have guns.  The argument that I always hear is that we can get killed with a knife too. But the thing is - in order to stab me you need to get very close to me, I have a way better chance of running away. With a gun, I could be far away and still get shot. Not only, with guns, but it can also often turn into mass shootings. With a knife, other people can run away or overtake the murderer. I live now in the states and do not want to carry a gun everywhere I go, even just for shopping because there&#39;s a possibility someone can start shooting. You can try to convince me, because I&#39;m curious what are the solutions. + Ben, when you&#39;re defending gun laws and say that you feel sorry for the victims, you should at least come up with some solutions.

And I can say this because I left the same hell hole they are trying to leave behind. I have seen the hate. I have seen the blood. The gunshots. The torture.

"Your argument is spun by them. They want federal enforcement of current laws(that is basically reasonable) and probably new regulation(that is an unknown). America has states with basically 100% porous borders. State laws for gun control are generally ineffective for criminality concerns...but definitely restrict the rights of lawful gun ownership.<br /><br />I almost wonder if state level gun control laws even might empower black market traders. The laws make the illicit markets more lucrative.<br /><br />That is why they(dems) want federal restrictions.

"There are no such firearms as &quot;Assault Rifles&quot; and the guns that they seek to ban are being banned for the stupid and delusional. People who know nothing about firearms. The same &quot;safer looking&quot; guns of the same identical caliber, with the same exact ability will still be available. But his makes no sense for three reasons...It isn&#39;t the firearms that are killing , it is the people. Second. Handguns are used in more murders than any other gun, and third and most important...Anyone who knows anything would realize that every second, in every major city and town in the USA criminals are  buying and selling illegal firearms to each other, and they could give a shit which laws you put on the books. So lets limit the type and quantity of firearms that ;law abiding people can own, while criminals stock up?????...Sounds like a smart plan. The Ruger Mini 14 is a Semi automatic rifle that uses .223 ammunition and has readily available 30 round magazines. this looks like a regular hunting rifle so it&#39;s OK... An AR-15 is semi automatic , but for some reason they call it &quot;assault rifle&quot;. Now this fires .223 ammo, has readily available 30 round magazines, but it &#39;Looks&quot; scary and military, so THAT is what they want to ban. Please know that these kneejerk reactions to deaths are highly destructive to good law abiding people. We literally WATCHED the police turn their back on citizens while the riots raged on, and NOW of all times you want restrict the good people in America?

If the gun control people are serious instead of self-righteous, they&#39;ll undertake the hard work of getting a constitutional amendment through Congress, then before the states.

"Where is the Democrat&#39;s call for more gun control after every weekend in Chicago&#39;s war zone? After Democrats call for another gun control bill that this time is sure to make us all safe and secure after the shooting in Boulder they seem to be tolerant of a dozen, or more, gun deaths elsewhere as long as they aren&#39;t related to one another by occurring in the same place or perpetrated by the same shooter. The problem is their selective outrage is taking on a racist flavor. The Boulder shooter was nearly white, white enough to fool the media, and his victims were all white which would normally not draw their ire but they don&#39;t want this crisis to go to waste. While almost all of the victims in Chicago are black and the vast majority of the perps in Chicago are black Democrats remain silent as well as the media. Where&#39;s the outrage, the call for more gun control, the cries of racism evidenced by Congress ignoring the deaths of blacks that occur every weekend in Chicago? It would appear that Democrats are expending all of their outrage on the white victims in Boulder while expending a great deal of energy ignoring what they must consider a non-starter for policy changes. If they can&#39;t do anything about it ignoring it is a policy we wish Biden had taken towards the situation on the border.

How does disarming law abiding citizens help get illegal guns off the streets? I could go down to Detroit right now and get an arsenal of unregistered guns. It‚Äôs that easy! Gun control won‚Äôt stop gun violence. In America it will actually make it worse due to criminals being the only ones who can access guns. Australia and the U.K. are good examples of what happens when you take away peoples rights to bare arms. Crime and murder both increased significantly. Knife attacks are more common than shootings ever were. If a psycho can‚Äôt buy a gun from the store they can just go to the hood and get one. Or they can google how to make a gun or something much worse. The majority of gun violence in America is done by criminals with illegal guns. Maybe start there. Get rid of the criminals guns first. Sad thing is they know they can‚Äôt. There‚Äôs too many out there. So disarming a law abiding citizen just puts them in danger. It‚Äôs common sense. There‚Äôs too many evil people out there that can access guns regardless if the store sells them or not.,U.P.Trail Seeker,2021-03-24T14:06:14Z,0

The way daily wire describes Biden and how his views will change like the wind from year to year based on his personal goals and ambitions. It is really disgusting isn‚Äôt it? However at least it‚Äôs not as bad as Candace Owens who changed overnight. Joe Biden is just an actor prior to becoming a radical leftist desperately trying to get famous and rich from being so Candace Owens was desperate to become an actress or model or a new spokesman or any kind of famous rich person. The left rejected her she had exploded them as much as she could and in the end did not become their darling. Her plans to dox children or to radical leaving for the left. After that blew up in her face she went away for a very short time and reappeared as an instant conservative and every single worldview she had ever held head completely switched  to the polar opposite. Oh there‚Äôs so much shady crap in her background. But she takes a lot of boxes doesn‚Äôt she daily wire? And if I were to criticize perhaps I‚Äôm just a racist right? Horrible hypocrites.

This will be a policy that effectively let&#39;s anyone walk across the border with no worries on being stopped, so long as they aren&#39;t &quot;acting suspiciously&quot; or some such vague wordong.

"If firearms disappeared tomorrow (which is not even possible with over 400 million guns in the country) the people who have a ‚Äúdisparity of force‚Äù would be the ones most at risk. Namely, women, the disabled, the elderly, people outnumbered by attackers, and other groups we could define (e.g. smaller men attacked by larger men). These groups are routinely the most targeted by violent criminals, and criminals have several other advantages against innocent defenders, including:<br /><br />-	Speed and strength <br />      o  Violent criminals tend to be men between the age of 15-40.<br />-	Planning<br />     o	 Criminals can take as much time as they want to choose who they want to attack, the nature of the attack (e.g. robbery or rape, etc.), with what weapon(s), when they want to attack, at what location, and how many buddies they want to bring with them to attack.  <br />-	Element of surprise<br />     o	Criminals frequently choose victims who are unaware of their surroundings (such as someone walking while looking at their phone, listening to music, etc.).<br /><br />With all those advantages on the criminals‚Äô side, innocent defenders need any advantage they can get because they are behind the power curve and have only seconds to react to an attack and make life or death decisions. And this may come as a surprise to many, but frequently even a firearm is not enough of an advantage to avoid serious injury or death. A woman with a concealed carry license could shoot a knife wielding attacker directly in the heart and still be killed because it can take 15-30 seconds of severe bleeding for him to lose consciousness. Guns, especially handguns, are not nearly as powerful as they are depicted in the movies at all. As evidenced in video recordings of self-defense scenarios, bad guys are frequently still able to continue doing what they‚Äôre doing even after being shot 4, 5, 6, 7, or more times by a handgun. This is part of why states with magazine capacity restrictions can be dangerous for defenders.<br /><br />So who benefits from reductions, bans, or extra regulations on gun ownership? Murderers, rapists, burglars, and abusers benefit, because they already have every advantage in the world. If a murderer wants to murder someone, they will find a way. If a criminal wants to rob a store and he doesn‚Äôt have a gun, well he could just take a few buddies with hammers or $2.99 knives from Walmart. If a rapist wants to rape a woman, he could likely do it even by himself with his bare hands. So why do innocent defenders need guns? Because a gun can be the best option they have, and even then it might still not be enough to save them.",MusicMan1eAnda,2021-03-24T06:06:08Z,1

We have strict laws and high penalties against that already.<br />The better solution is let&#39;s get better security at schools and other public places. It&#39;s impossible to get a gun onto a plane. When&#39;s the last time you heard about a shooting on a plane? Can&#39;t we try to do the same at other places? That&#39;s a much better solution than simply taking guns away from citizens who only use them in the right ways-hunting, defending against shooters.

"America is the strongest nation in the world in 2021 and has been the most powerful nation in the world since 1945. How much longer will the US be on top? I know China is rising, but they are still far behind the US in military, alliances, technology, and soft power through music, movies, TV shows,, companies, internet sites etc. Plus China is facing an impending demographic problem. I think the US has at least a couple more decades at the top. And while the US like all nations in our position has made mistakes, the US based world order after WW2 has seen liberal democracies flourish and the quality of life of the average human being rise like never before, and the most peaceful, prosperous 75-80 year period in history. I know it seems like the time after WW2 has had tons of war, famine, violence, disasters etc, and it has, but compared to all of human history, things have never been this good. I don&#39;t have anything against the Chinese people, in fact I am half Chinese in heritage myself, and am proud of the culture, but the Chinese government is authoritarian and anti democratic, which is why I want the US to stay the most powerful and influential nation in the world for as long as possible.

"If they get rid of the filibuster and then pass H.R. 1, thus corrupting the elections from that point on, we&#39;ll be screwed. Our only option left would be violence since voting would mostly be useless, but that wouldn&#39;t work because not enough people would understand and wouldn&#39;t be behind us. We&#39;d be mostly alone. They&#39;d just figure we&#39;re sore losers and aren&#39;t accepting the results of the elections like in 2020. Even people like Ben said he wouldn&#39;t trust the results of the election if H.R. 1 passes. Conservatives reacting with violence would be doing it out of distrust for the election process, and then if mainstream conservatives like Ben and others agree with their sentiments, thus sowing distrust in the results, they&#39;ll be grouped in with the the &quot;seditionists&quot; and be silenced. Maybe even worse. The establishment will be able to justify silencing or arresting such people because they&#39;d easily be labeled as enemies of democracy. If H.R. 1 passes, things will get very ugly very quickly. This is why we need parallel media institutions. The only problem with that is I could envision a future where a democrat controlled federal government would just shut down alternative media companies. There would be a 1 party rule, and they would have likely packed the courts by then, so how could you stop them?

"Boulder is the most restrictive city in Colorado when it comes to guns.. In fact, AR15s (the gun supposedly used in the shooting) are outright banned there (seems like a law banning ARs doesn&#39;t keep people from using them to kill people!).  Colorado already has strict gun control, with universal background checks required and magazine capacity limits set at an arbitrary 15 rounds.  NONE of the proposed gun control measures would or have done anything to stop psyco scumbags from using weapons to hurt other people.  I can&#39;t think of a gun control law that could stop these events short of requiring everyone to carry and train with guns to protect themselves and other citizens.  A Syrian migrant goes off the deep end, goes into a gun free zone and shoots people... again!  ...and somehow we are supposed to believe that its the gun&#39;s fault!  Hell NO!  Had this sh*tbird tried to do this in Weld county, he might have got 5 or 6 shots off before he was faced with return fire.  We carry in Weld County... not so much in Boulder.

"Gun control will not eliminate the evil of sin in this world. It would only prevent the innocent from protecting themselves. Maybe if concealed carry was allowed in Colorado, either store employees or armed citizens might have been able to put this guy down before law enforcement arrived and save many lives. I know, if someone enters my church and starts shooting, at least 4-5 people will be drawing down on the bad guy, saving many lives. It is very suspicious that these shootings occurred just as new gun control legislation was pushed through by the House, but very little chance of passing in the Senate. The fallout from these shootings will put tremendous pressure on the Senate to pass more gun control. They are unwilling to acknowledge the real underlying cause of this kind of violence.

"@TiinyArmy Nice for you to point out the issue. Criminals aren&#39;t allowed to buy guns, not even through private sales. However, private sellers can legally sell guns to criminals because they are not required to do background checks. This is why universal background checks need to be a thing. You are not selling to a criminal when you don&#39;t check whether someone is a criminal, afterall. Putting the responsiblity exclusively on the criminal is idiotic.<br /><br />&quot;you cant just label people as a criminal when they haven&#39;t committed a crime yet,&quot;<br />I have never done such a thing, clown.<br /><br />&quot;making it hard for citizens to buy guns does absolutely nothing,&quot;<br />The ability of law abiding citizens to buy guns would not in any way be meaningfully restricted by this, since they are not criminals.<br /><br />&quot;a person will kill another with or without guns&quot;<br />Not true. Easy access to firearms enables people to do all sorts of things, you do recognize this for self-defense but not for aggression.<br /><br />&quot; the argument just doesn&#39;t add up.&quot;<br />The argument that criminals shouldn&#39;t be able to just buy a gun from a legal private seller sure does add up. It&#39;s obvious.<br />Do you really not think that criminals shouldn&#39;t be able to buy guns from private sellers who are selling their gun legally?<br /><br />&quot;and nothing will stop private sales, not even a law against it,&quot;<br />Nobody here was talking about stopping private sales generally. I was talking about stopping private sales to criminals.<br />And of course laws will stop criminals from buying guns through legal private sales. Because if there was a law about background checks, law abiding private sellers would not sell their guns to criminals. And if they did, they&#39;d be criminals and not law abiding citizens for knowingly selling to a criminal or for knowingly not doing a background check.<br />So, yes, a law like this will by definition reduce the cases of &quot;law abiding private seller selling a gun to a criminal&quot; to zero.<br /><br />&quot;popping pills or snorting cocaine is illegal, do you think the laws against those are working?&quot;<br />But selling pills and cocaine is illegal. Selling a gun to a criminal isn&#39;t illegal as long as you don&#39;t know they are a criminal, which you don&#39;t know because you don&#39;t have to check.<br />Through background checks we can actually make it illegal for people to sell their guns to criminals.",122Jeffrey,2021-03-24T15:13:02Z,0

How do you pay for a liability with a liability - is that not just transferring the liability to someone else? The debt grows because it has to. Only way to remove govt debt is for the government to hoard the IOU asset and offset the liability. The central bank is going to create the fedcoin (on blockchain) so they can drive rates to negative and program a burn rate in the coin at the negative rate.<br /><br />It seems the solution has to be going back to a gold standard so rates can be regulated by consumers who can choose not to participate in the government ponzi scheme known as fiat currency. It&#39;s the most immoral system. Issue gold backed bonds that can be exchanged for the IOU assets. It&#39;s the only hope of making a dent in the fiat debt and actually extinguishes a liability.,Psyentifik1,2021-03-23T19:19:41Z,0

I&#39;m around people, ones who say they are Christian no less, who don&#39;t care about abortion or black violence both of which result in far more murder than mass shootings ever do. Many Leftists do not care about problems that do not fit their agenda picking issues not by their severity, but by their opposition to the right. The right consistently condemns both violence like the capital hill riot and the BLM riots. I have seen the right compromise and have bipartisanship in legislation with the Left until they push an issue to absurdity, seemly only to keep problems alive so they can blame the right.",The Mighty Gerbil,2021-03-23T18:53:58Z,0

"@Scott Mac-Cheese Rae dude, thats not an argument. I am aware of the U.S. murder rate yes, though you clearly are not. As gun ownership has exploded in the last couple decades, gun crime has actually fallen. Now of course we are experiencing a slight temporary rise currently, but is it still much lower than when gun ownership was lower as well. Now I don&#39;t expect you to acknowledge this, it is human nature, but it is a fact.<br /><br />I am also aware of the mass shootings, yes. Around 400 people died in mass shootings in 2019, which the main  portion of which was gang violence. That is absolutely tiny. That is not an argument for violating the rights of hundreds of millions of Americans you absolute doorknob.<br /><br />Now that you are aware of these FACTS, please make a coherent rebuttal to my paragraph I previously wrote.<br /><br />Some topics include:<br />- the constitutionality to keep and bare arms<br />- the moral right to keep and bare arms<br />- the reasoning as to why every authoritarian regime disarms its populace<br />- the purpose of the second amendment<br /><br />Make an argument, with reasons and arguments as to why i should agree, for the violation of self-preservation rights.

"@Brian Z. &quot;I think it might be a couple things. &quot;Mass shooting&quot; has no defined standard.&quot;<br />Obviously, but they are usually not too different.<br /><br />&quot;Also, the amount of people who conceal carry in the US does not seem to be very high.&quot;<br />There is also open carry though. And both are much higher in the US than in European countries, because European countries usually only allow carrying in very special circumstances. So my question still stands, people in the US not only own more guns, they also carry waaaaaaaaay more often than Europeans, so why is the US not already much safer? The carry ratio between the US and European countries is most likely MUCH MUCH higher than the gun possession ratio. So it would probably actually support my question, not your argument.<br /><br />&quot; That&#39;s a very small percentage of people who have the ability to stop a shooting if it were to occur.&quot;<br />That percentage would even be much much lower in European countries with better stats. See above.<br /><br />&quot;The way I look at it is this: what if half or even just a few of the people in the supermarket had guns? Though unlikely in this case, maybe the shooter wouldn&#39;t have attempted to kill people at all if he knew that lots of civilians carried in the area.&quot;<br />While this is obviously a valid question, when you ask this question, you should also take into account people who wouldn&#39;t even have attempted to commit mass murder if they hadn&#39;t had easy access to firearms. I find it really dishonest when people only ask questions about one side but not the other. (Not accusing you of this)<br />Or in other words: You could argue that if more people carried guns, they&#39;d more likely to be able to stop a shooter (who at that point most likely already murdered people), sure. However, how many people become murderes/shooters and attempt/do a (mass) murder/shooting because they have easy access to firearms? How many of those people were enabled by easy access to effective firearms and wouldn&#39;t have committed a crime in the first place otherwise? The other guy would tell you that &quot;they would have just used a different method anyway then&quot;, which does not seem to be backed up by the facts.<br />And of course this doesn&#39;t even address suicide. Gun owners have MUCH MUCH higher suicide rates than non-gun owners because guns can act as an enabler, not just for suicide, but also for murder.<br />So, sure, how many shootings could be stopped earlier (after some people probably already died) if more people carried guns? Probably many. <br />But also how many people commit murder/suicide because easy access to guns enabled them to do something they otherwise wouldn&#39;t have done (certainly not as effectively)? Probably many.",122Jeffrey,2021-03-23T22:05:33Z,0

"@Runner Girl a quick note on the black market and claimed illegal trades. The u.s government never had enough revenue, they cleared out 401k&#39;s, veterans and health insurance. And now black market revenue is added to national revenue. Not that the the u.s and senators haven&#39;t been involved in money laundering and fraud for decades or a century.<br /><br />House resolutions permit insider trading and 100% profits with out any contribution in tax revenue for medical investments, and 15% annual returns on all others before having to contribute. <br /><br />Alcohol doesn&#39;t have the slightest affect on viruses. But they don&#39;t care about that. Same with masks and vaccines. You know they still use smallpox vaccine? When the claim is it was eradicated.
