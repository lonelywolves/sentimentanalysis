"Cenk was once a Republican. Did he say &#39;Hello&#39; to Donald Trump going the other way?<br /><br />Trump was a rich Dem with blue-collar values and outlooks. He never meshed with Clinton-types tho&#39; he once knew the Clintons themselves socially. So much for caring.¬†<br /><br />Trump figured out he could not get the Dem Presidential nomination in 100 years. So he used his TV skills to try for the GOP nomination. No matter the outcome, just running for the GOP nomination would gain him no end of publicity. Then he got the nomination, delighting the media who figured beating Trump would be a slam dunk. Then Trump surprised the media, Hillary, and himself.<br /><br />Tat was one of the greatest upsets ever to happen in a major democracy. It seems more like something that would happen in Haiti or Guatemala. It should be the basis for satires reaching into the 2300s. The USA is no more the proud nation it was in 1945. It is a freak show run by Hollywood, the media, and TV talkshows. How did it go? Geraldo paved the way for Jerry Springer? Did you ever witness such garbage?<br /><br />Why Trump assumed he rated a 2d term is totally puzzling. He should be thankful for the one implausible break he got.¬†<br /><br />So there you have it from Cenk to Trump. What bigger pair of fakes could you want?",Max Roberts,2021-01-03T04:29:26Z,1

"Love him or hate him: Cenk&#39;s political project is to get money out of politics, it&#39;s th√© most worthy cause in politics because it&#39;s linked to every foreign war, the price-gouging of essential drugs, the corrupt pseudo-bipartisan political apparatus crafting legislation to suit the donorclass,... and he&#39;s succesful at it. The politicians who reject superpac money now have a beachhead in congress and will eventually force the bought politicians to come clean. There&#39;s no hypocrisy here. Cenk is a progressive businessman. He&#39;s not th√© furthest guy on the left, but if you watch Shapiro and have not recognized him for what he is, you&#39;re not smart enough to realize that. He fights for M4A, minimum wages, affordable higher education,... (standard living conditions in so many countries where the quality of life is far better than the US) but he has no intention to roll over for planted bad faith employees, in the wake of his election in California. Rightfully so. The unionization of TYT was a political attack. Unionization is very important for major corporations where employees are atomized and powerless. The business models of many small businesses (such as TYT) are less compatible with unionization and disputes are often mediated with a different power dynamic to keep operations sustainable. If you&#39;ve worked for both, you understand this. Ben Shapiro is just a vile vulgar grifter in the tradition of vile vulgar US grifters (think Dave Rubin, think Milo... as some of his contemporaries) , as described by Naomi Oreskes in the book &#39;Merchants of doubt&#39;. In as far as he&#39;ll make history, Shapiro will be recognized as such and nothing more. His interview with conservative host Andrew Neill is a good example of what happens when Shapiro steps out of his comfort zone.  He gets pummeled with ease. He knows this and avoids this. His immoral but profitable political project is to make fuzzy minds vote for endless financial deregulation because they&#39;re angry about pronouns and transgender bathrooms. That&#39;s the scam, but it&#39;s coming to an end. Don&#39;t fall for this nonsense. You&#39;re better than Ben Shapiro. Far better.",Laurent D'Hondt,2020-12-30T13:18:31Z,0

See that‚Äôs how it works, they want it for everyone else as long as they aren‚Äôt required to give up some of their money. It‚Äôs kind of like when you ask African Americans if we should give our reparations because of slavery, then after telling them that‚Äôs just 1% of blacks today are descendants of slavery and then the story changes that slavery hurt all blacks in America so even if you come voluntarily. You should get reparations. Uh no you shouldn‚Äôt. Reparations was a promise made to basically back pay slaves by giving them 40 acres and a mule. That where the idea comes from and if you can‚Äôt directly trace your ancestry back to a slave brought to America then your not qualified. Then the argument becomes oh ‚ÄòJim crow‚Äô existed. Guess what, those laws existed around the world including in Africa where in some countries it‚Äôs the same law applied in reverse. People need to learn that America does not represent what happened everywhere..<br /> No time keeping is not a white thing, it‚Äôs actually African starting with equinox markers for planting food, the 28 day moon cycle.

"The Republican playbook; lie, deceive, divert, distract, divide, change the subject, play victim, blame, scapegoat, obstruct, project their own hang ups, give strawman arguments to get out of answering the real questions, take credit for others work, self congratulate constantly, gaslight, project their own insecurities, deflect reasonable questions, fearmonger, and have an arrogant conversation about religion if they are the moral leaders when in fact the Supreme Court decision of Roe vs. Wade was a Republican appointed court. Nationalism is on the rise due to the radical rhetoric Trump uses. Trump provokes violence by his reckless use of language and his cavalier attitude. He summons the worst in people by pandering to their insecurities and fears. Republicans blame the poor for the bad management and the economic shortfall  that the government has caused. They first find a easy target such as the poor, the weak and the disenfranchized. Now the Republican leadership wants your Social Security money to balance the budget, but all the tax cuts added trillions to the debt were supposed to pay for themselves.  The Republicans  objectify the poor and disenfranchized by dehumanizing them,  so they can justify homelessness and take away safety nets. Republicans do this to the poor for the sake of tax cuts for the wealthy. Tax cuts  for the wealthy are ruining America, but they lie about this too. Wake up, businesses are in business to create profits not hire people.  Also, the Republicans use voter suppression to stay in power. Since when is it patriotic to fly another flag other than the stars and stripes? I&#39;m talking about flying and displaying the Confederate flag. Also, when is it patriotic to say Nazi&#39;s and the KKK are very fine people? This Republican party is the face of hate. Inculcating and indoctrination into hate, is the best way to describe this new Republican party of Trump. We see all of this. Trump is ruining America and dividing us. Listen to him, he is like a petulant child. Now he is turning into a facist autocratic tyrant. After all that Republicans use the media for the propaganda they spew. Any news outlet that calls him out he maligns, calls, fake news, or trys to destroy the individual. All the while maligning the true experts that don&#39;t agree with there ideology. He knew that the Covid virus was real and called it fake news, instead offering good leadership he played the pandemic down to pander to his base for re-election,  because that is all he cares about. This comes from a fed up Veteran. He called soldiers suckers and losers. John McCain was besmirched by Trump for being captured.  Trump is a draft dodging sycophant and Trump when needed will play the victim when necessary. Being a billionaire and a martyr is a devious plan brought to perfection, whipped up by his religious supporters, thereby causing a herd mentality of inclusion into a sick and hateful community.  Trump requires constant adulation and praise. He is bragard that constantly praises himself in speeches. In other words you got conned by Don. Trump is enabled by individuals and  organizations, who are either gullible or complicit in fooling the average citizen with the poison of hate and deception.

Unions are terrible. If you want to regulate employees with rights it has to go across all businesses. Manufacturing unions in Ontario is poison. They push themselves out of jobs. Unlike the earlier days the government enforces labour laws that not only apply to one business. This means all the businesses are feeling the pinch so that the burden is evenly spread across all competitors. That means if the customer wants it the customer has to pay. Of course this only works if foreign involvement is regulated as well which the government can do depending on how it wants to spread the tax dollars and regulate the borders. This is also why it makes sense to give some industries special tax breaks.,Shawn Murphy,2020-10-16T09:41:39Z,0

"Why not make sure that you are truly saved by Jesus Christ and practice this way. Remorsefully confess with your heart your sins to Jesus Christ who is God and tell Him that you right now are repenting of your sins and you want to be born again of the Spirit from above. Tell Jesus that you are remorsefully sorry for breaking His commandments and that you are begging for forgiveness from Him. Allow His blood from the cross to wash away your sins. After this is done with your heart successfully the Holy Spirit will come to live within you and He will rebuild you from the inside out. <br /><br />Look for signs that you are saved. Things like spreading the good news from Jesus, getting other people saved, a craving for the word of God, reading the Bible, etc‚Ä¶ These things are known as a calling and fruit bearing. If you&#39;re not bearing fruit then keep doing it. Sometimes it takes time to get saved. Read Matthew chapter 13 from the King James Bible. God bless!!!",SD,2020-10-10T13:52:20Z,1

I have become a fan recently. Love that you tell the truth. But I would like to say that I&#39;m part of a Union and my union doesn&#39;t force the employer to give anything unsustainable. A union that does that would make them go bankrupt and then there wouldn&#39;t be a business or a union. Most non-union businesses give a ridiculous amount of money to the top executives and pay their work force almost unlivable wages. Thank you for your time.

For this reason I would agree that Cenk was hypocritical and should have welcomed the change with open arms, and negotiated to make it work. Just because he is being stupid, does not mean unions don&#39;t have their place.

They‚Äôve done it!  <br />Because of that, employee‚Äôs won‚Äôt vote for union.  They‚Äôd rather make minimum wage than lose their job entirely.  Super corrupt.  <br />I don‚Äôt know how big TYT is, or how many employees they have,  but it may be that if they go union they would go under.

"He ran for Representative in the district I live in (very recent special election in an area that is northern Los Angeles County) and got slaughtered.  Part of his campaign strategy was he had guys place placards on businesses stating the businesses support him, and business owners either did not notice (less often) or removed them (more often).  My understanding is he denied that this was happening.  I was not familiar with him before this.  What little I saw of him, he sounded like and acted like a bully, and fostered voter hatred between parties/ideology. He was smooth about it for the most part, you couldn&#39;t exactly nail down any one thing he said, but it added up to &quot;they are all bad people, if you vote for me you are good people.&quot;",Mike G,2020-08-24T23:58:20Z,1

unions dont wreck  business and i know because im atm living in europe where every country has unions and i been working here and they spend a lot of money on the  employees for PPE and other things and the company&#39;s still have a lot of money for crazy amount of gifts for xmass so dont tell me i know better. you know the only difference? the CEO&#39;s are not allowed to take what ever profits they want that is the difference. company&#39;s have PLENTY PLENTY PLENTY of money for everyone if they just was not keeping it for themselves and giving their top employees crazy bonuses. so shove that dumb shit up your bunghole. you wont win this argument with me.,kratom seeker,2020-07-29T03:33:15Z,0

Capitalism is just a means of production. China is beating us at our own game because they know that they can keep hold of tyrranical power while utilizing the principles of capitalism. But peple like Shapiro have deified the idea of capitalism as some sacred force directly related to freedom. Society itself is a socialist enterprise where everyone wins because the resources are pooled and redistributed to serve the greater good and the greatest number of people. Both Uygur and Shapiro are victims of their own ideologies that create a religion out of otherwise objective elements.,Marc Cohen,2020-07-27T21:42:07Z,0

"Socialism means more government. More government means more regulations. And all socialist and communist regimes thus far have lead to the government limiting freedom of speech, and people being forcefully being re-educated. The government takes your money redistributes it to others. They also seize control of businesses and destroy competition. Often times capitalist countries turning socialist print mass amounts of money which inflates the economy ruining the economy because when you have more demand than supply the prices for things go up, and your cash becomes useless. The government&#39;s wasteful spending is what ravages a country, and also the lack of free trade among countries.",CynicalBastardChild649,2021-04-20T19:34:10Z,0

Not only is it the biggest scam in human financial history, but that it was sold to the public so well that the idiots clamor for it. &quot;The Great Fail&quot; is going to be apocalyptic. I&#39;m buying survival gear and tools, long-term food storage, and other essentials with our fake money while I can. 74% of ppl polled didn&#39;t know that the faucet does not flow when the grid is down. Store shelves are emptied within 48 hours of a collapse. Gas stations emptied within 24 hours. And 80% of the population would be wiped out in 30 days of a grid down situation. Those depending on the government for sustenance will be the first ones X&#39;d.<br />You know this is coming....hope your making plans. Take care and stop wasting your time with fools, the indoctrination is strong and 110 years in the making. We have no chance of unraveling it.

"@n otto That first statement is a lie and we both know it. I have an old friend from Cuba that can atest to that. I know of three Cuban boxers that can atest to that.<br /><br />Castro was a Leninist and a Marxist. This guy promoted homosexual internments, mass government surveillance, and mass systemic executions. We&#39;re talking some 10,723 people lost to his regime. Almost 1,000 were disappearances, over 2,000 extrajudicial killings, and over 3,100 people killed by firing squad. Also 100 minors dead by beating, withdrawing medical attention, and just about any other method you can think of. Not to mention about 78,000 people died trying to flee the Cuba. If you don&#39;t think he&#39;s worth judging by now, you&#39;re a lost cause.<br /><br />Also Cuba&#39;s life expectancy(at least before the pandemic) is actually ranked just below the US, and that&#39;s impressive given Cuba&#39;s universal health care system and given that the US is the 3rd largest population in the world. And the only reason why Cuba&#39;s healthcare universal healthcare system isn&#39;t a failure is because the UN started funding them in the 70&#39;s.",Dub Line,2021-04-25T20:27:31Z,0

But I am interested in getting the Conservative perspective on issues since there&#39;s always two sides to a story aswell as tackling certain issues and Ben is a brilliant source for that. But I just wanted to say how weird it is that despite being politically aligned with Cenk, I think the guy is so much full of shit to the point that I would rather listen to Ben talk about his views despite not agreeing with him on the vast majority of things. Watching Ben&#39;s videos have made me change my views on certain issues, the main one being that Identity politics is horse shit, it&#39;s a cancer that has spread amongst the Left, believe me I use to believe that all Conservatives were ignorant racists who were In denial of there white privilege despite myself being a victim of racial abuse (I&#39;m white) back in secondary school in England.",Sam Hirst,2020-05-11T00:21:35Z,0

"He ran a campaign that blew my mind.  I had never heard of him.  I listened to him some and he left with me the thought &quot;I don&#39;t think even any of my Democrat friends are going to vote for this guy.&quot;  He got I believe 6% in the special election, and it kind of alarmed me that he even got 6%.  Now it&#39;s a run-off between Christy Smith (more of a career politician Dem, was beaten in the special election but had a good showing) and Mike Garcia (won the special election, seems to me like a new up-and-comer).  The special election was close enough that I don&#39;t think Mike Garcia has it in the bag no question, we&#39;ll see, I&#39;m curious how it will turn out.  I can say this much, I know a few moderates in my area that are now &quot;fuck voting Democrat&quot;, I haven&#39;t met a single moderate who has recently changed their mind and say &quot;fuck voting Republican&quot;.  I do recall some doing that during the Bush era for sure.<br /><br />The special election was caused by Katie Hill (Dem) having to leave in disgrace having been outed as having pot/alcohol/sex parties on the tax payer dime, she lasted months before she was gone.  I think the reality of what happened was a bit less egregious/interesting than the Rep opponents made out of it, but having said that, she did mess up for sure, and I don&#39;t know a damned thing she did that helped the district, she basically was an AOC cheerleader and nothing more during her brief time in power.<br /><br />I think the hard left is scaring away moderates.  I know they have done so with me, my wife, my sister-in-law and with my son-in-law.  And I don&#39;t ask or talk about this stuff, these are people who originated the data to me about it.  I have a couple family who are hard left, they will vote Dem no matter what, but most of us are moderates and now it&#39;s all &quot;Trump despite misgivings about him&quot; with all I have heard from, so far.",Mike G,2020-08-25T00:03:41Z,4

Don&#39;t forget that Chump Uygur was a registered Republican. He called himself a &quot;conservative&quot; but like most on the right even now he was never a conservative at heart. Merely calling oneself a conservative does not make it so. His move to the Democrat party platform was strictly a business move. The problem that Cenk has is that he is a very poor actor. He loves capitalism and he knows it. His condemnation of the unionization within The Young Turks is more than sufficient proof of that.,MrIhadanaccount,2020-03-31T10:10:05Z,0

"Cenk is not a very intelligent individual. He calls everybody else &#39;stupid&#39; and &#39;corrupt&#39;, because he is both, and it&#39;s just pure projection. His debate performance with Christie Smith was laughable. All he did was make subtle jabs at her, and promote his &quot;Bernie Sanders&quot; ideology to a crowd that repeatedly booed him (best part was during one of his little speeches, one girl in the crowd yelled out &quot;WHAT?????&quot;). <br /><br /><br />Needless to say, Cenk&#39;s political future is toast. 5% of the vote, in an election where the guy who placed just underneath him spent a grand total of $500 on their campaign, meanwhile Cenk spent over $1M. The guy who polled at 4% spent $500....and was almost tied w/ Cenk, who has massive media influence, a huge following, and had $1M to spend on campaigning.

"A comment says why should my hard earn tax dollars help out the poor and on welfare.  <br /><br />Well that&#39;s peanuts my friends.  Compare to what most of your tax dollars is spent on helping, THE WEALTHY. <br /><br />The 2016 3.4 trillion tax cut that Republicans are so proud of, and you know why?  It gave 65 billionaires in the US overnight a 44 billion dollar bonus!  Don&#39;t take my word for it, look up the interview with Warren Buffett.  He said he didn&#39;t do a single thing different, and that tax cut gave him and all billionaires more billions.<br /><br />You understand my point now?  Republicans are laughing everytime someone says why should my hard earn tax dollars help the poor and welfare... They laughing cause they successfully focus your anger on trivial amount of money to help the poor, they already poor they don&#39;t need much, understand that, just a boost to get by.<br /><br />While they just rob the working class billions and billions.  Amazon in 2020 paid no taxes.  But they amass like 200 billion in revenue for themselves.  Why aren&#39;t you complaining about that? They made billions off US consumers, paid off a few Republicans and lawyers, now they tax free lol<br /><br />If you are against helping the poor and on welfare, that&#39;s fine with me, then you must be also against helping the rich to get richer off taxpayers. <br /><br />If not, then you&#39;re a hypocrite. Just like most Republicans.

"Number one there&#39;s a HUGE difference between a massive corporation with thousands of employees and billions of dollars in NET profit unionizing compared to a company with a few dozen employees and a few million in GROSS profits. That being said, the context of the situation matters. How much money are their top executives from the companies in question putting in their pockets after all expenses are paid? If the answer is several thousand percent higher than the average employee,  then yes they clearly have the profits to have a unionized workforce to help ensure financial stability for the workers. If the answer is around a few hundred percent than the average worker, then the company is still growing or is otherwise not in a position to sustain a unionized workforce. The context matters and these situations are not black and white as Ben makes it out to be.

If unionization, from My understanding, is the workers coming together in the business to come together to put themselves in a better position to argue with the company for pay increases and etc. In a capitalist system this seems like a no brainer type thing. I get that some unions go OVERBOARD with their demands but if the union and the business stay within the real of reality and argue back and forth to come to an agreement then that sounds like a good thing. Sure the business is spending more money, I understand that, but if that money is just going back into the employees how is that just not seen as investing in their employees?

When challenged, he cuts their hours.  How rich is that?  It epitomizes their lack of understanding of the private sector and small business.  And Bernie wasn&#39;t even budgeting a payroll through the production of a product or provision of a service...it was money that he panhandled for...rattled a tin cup.  Imagine if he had to balance the entire spectrum of running a business.",Phattygoodness,2020-02-26T12:52:15Z,115
"@Pamela Jackson <br /><br />You speak as if Bernie is a great humanitarian that didn&#39;t intend to exploit those with salaried positions within his campaign, when in fact, he only acted because these people went public and were going to walk out on his campaign.  ONLY when faced with this situation did Bernie finally cut the hours to match the $15/hr salary.  So, rather than have them keep working those hours that were apparently critical to the campaign and pay them the money they were due, he elected to cut their hours.  This is what happened in Seattle and other cities where minimum wage or wages were mandated by the government that were not commensurate with that job&#39;s value.  I personally employ menial labor positions and I have 1st hand knowledge that some jobs are simply not worth a &#39;livable wage&#39; or wages that are mandated by some pandering politicians with literally no experience employing anyone.  <br /><br />Bernie now understands that employing people is not as black and white as he and others on the Left suggest.  The employment market needs to be the only metric that sets the baseline.  And a livable wage is something that is earned...its not an entitlement.  <br /><br />Bernie is a phony.  He knows nothing about business, economics, or what it takes to navigate through the landmines of political bureaucracy that these corporation hating hypocrites have legislated over the years.  <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Bernieisacharlatan"">#Bernieisacharlatan</a>",Phattygoodness,2020-03-30T11:21:44Z,3
"@Phattygoodness You can disagree with his policies and with the idea of unions, but keeping employee hours below 50 a week is not against his policies, its requiring them to work the hours that match what they are already being paid according to his policies. They were already being paid over $15 an hour according to a salary based on 40 hrs a week. As with the nature of campaign work, they ended up working more hours, so the pay did not match. He fixed that immediately by telling them to work hours that most people would not complain about (42-43) until the more permanent solution could be reached. That‚Äôs how salaries work. After negotiations, both sides reached an agreement and everything he did was in complete unison with his policies. No irony there. Especially since this is not a typical product producing job where unions are common, Bernie having a union in an area that is before unheard of, shows how committed he is to his policies.<br />In the private sector, would they cut the hours to just above 40 hrs? Or below 40?",Pamela Jackson,2020-03-30T03:21:28Z,0
"@Pamela Jackson <br /><br />Actually, the value of any job should be predicated upon the job&#39;s value, and not what any union or politician demands.  The irony is that Bernie ended up restructuring his campaign staff hours to accommodate  his inability to pay the higher wages...which is exactly what happens in the private sector when employers are forced/mandated to pay wages that  exceed what is commensurate with the job.  More irony is that it&#39;s not even Bernie&#39;s money.  There&#39;s no product.  He gets his campaign money from panhandling and rattling his tin cup, and he still couldn&#39;t adhere to the standards on which he ignorantly campaigns.  Try to imagine if he had all of the expenses and responsibilities to actually produce something...a product or an actual service within the scope of still making enough money to support the business.  It&#39;s a lot different than soliciting money over the phone when the coffers start to dry up.",Phattygoodness,2020-03-29T12:38:26Z,1
"Bernie&#39;s campaign was the first ever to have a union. Not to mention great healthcare. Bernie changed the way campaigns are run.They were paid salary, so he cut their hours to a more reasonable 42 hrs per week instead of 50 which is in line with the original pay acceptance of over $15 on hour. After the negotiations with the union, they were paid more than $15 an hour according to an agreement that everyone accepted.

"Look I‚Äôm not a expert at economics, but for me we shouldn‚Äôt have a wealth tax but instead tax the rich more on the amount they make annually. For instance the last decade or so ceos have had their pay increase 900-1100% and the rest of people‚Äôs wage has gone up like 10-50%. And if you look up the 1% it‚Äôs state to state but someone with 250k$ can be in the top 1% depending on your state. So also we could tax company‚Äôs more since their the ones who retain most of the profits.<br /><br />Like I said I‚Äôm no expert but I‚Äôm not radical about economics, if there‚Äôs a better idea or way to go about wealth equality then I‚Äôm down to hear.",Tackybubbles 447,2020-02-26T04:27:03Z,0

And just what is the origin of this phrase, Kemal Ataturk.<br />Your example of the swastika having multiple meanings imagine if someone were to brandish a swastika at a Trump rally. Oh I&#39;m sure that media corporations such as the Young Turks would call for nuance. Hey that might be Hinduism at play here, or perhaps ancient Germanic references to the Black Sun and Ragnarok. We all know they would pounce eager to assume that therefore Trump is Hitler. In fact they ran a piece on the Duke University swastika, they blamed Trump and the America first movement without any evidence. And now we are supposed to tip toe around their commemoration of Ataturk?  Nope. How biased can you get?",bumpin' ugly,2020-02-27T18:22:29Z,0

"@To Wo People with jobs should not be electing to get foodstamps this I entirely agree with you on. I feel responsible to tend my own life and help others through educating them. Similar problem to give a man a fish he can eat for a day.. Teach a man to fish he can eat for the rest of his life. I do not feel the need to continue to fish for someone else who has a fishing pole in one hand and a phone in another. When it comes to the car market I again agree with you when there is likely going to be a huge problem with loans, and credit cards. This is not just their fault though, it takes two to create a loan and I heavily disagree with their marketing and I disagree with their morality on providing loans. I also disagree with the people signing up just so that they can impress some people at a stop light they will never meet when there are better options. It goes back to educating people to not make these decisions.",Gavin Tackett,2020-02-27T20:22:42Z,0
"@To Wo did not say I was voting but thank you anyway. I also did not generalize all working people, you have my perspective twisted entirely. I understand how you feel about the unhealthy mindset but unfortunately we can&#39;t tell someone what to do with their money that they received based on a agreed upon transaction by both parties. I did not call anybody lazy either, I just think they have the wrong mindset about the way the system works. I also do not think welfare programs are a bad thing for sure. When I gave an example of how you could make it in today&#39;s America I did include someone who may have a brand new phone and vehicle because you truly can not make it on minimum wage if you decide to sign a dotted line stating that you are purchasing something far out of your price range. As for your issue with getting sick and being out of luck, most workplaces that want to keep their employees have sick days in the form of points, that people often use when they don&#39;t want to come in then do not have any left for when they really need them. But let me ask you this, what do you think we should do to help people without taking from somebody else to do so? I vote we encourage a savings mindset over spending so that people can be prepared against the situations that involve losing their job, and to work on getting forward rather than working on how to stay stagnant while getting everything they want. I again ask, how would you like to help people that does not involve involuntarily using someone else&#39;s money?",Gavin Tackett,2020-02-27T20:07:54Z,0
"@To Wo You are right in the fact that we do not deserve Bernie I will agree with you on that note. Maybe not in the same way you mean but I would never vote against my own interest to say in the very least. Bottom line is we are voting for which perspective in life we have and who fits that perspective. For instance, mine is investing in mutual funds and Roth IRAs. These get better interest (or rate of return as it is more well known as) when companies end the accounting year with a higher profit margin. This means that, at a 10% rate of return you can invest just 100 dollars a month from 20 to 65 and have 1.2 million in retirement. As a financial analyst it is weird to hear people think that they can&#39;t make it in America today. Central America&#39;s cost of living is only 29% of the cost of living for the same place in San Diego, Los Angeles, and so on. If you want to make minimum wage the rest of your life and have enough to live on plus go on vacations twice a year, move to central America, work at a Wal-Mart, make 1400 a month full time, take 600 away for rent plus utilities (less with a roommate) then take 300 away for food , 100 away for gas, save 200 for emergencies, (each month) save 200 for vacations (each month) which puts you at 2400 vacation money in a year.<br /><br />I get your perspective though and you have your right to it, but please don&#39;t pretend like it is anyone else&#39;s fault that you are not willing to change your life style. We have the richest poor class in the history of the world and we need to stop marketing brand new phones and cars to people who can not afford them.",Gavin Tackett,2020-02-27T14:27:21Z,0

See if you can wrap your enlightened brain around any of these concepts and intelligently refute these assertions, minus name-calling and baseless insults, do so on that phone that has more power and ability than the rocket that travelled to the moon, that has a GPS system once disallowed by our government from being in aircraft because of its ability to accurately guide missiles onto a target. You now own that power yourself and hold it in your hand.<br />  Even the countries that are socialist today, are only able to be so BECAUSE of that which you think you despise, that is, this once God-fearing nation and it&#39;s fruits.     A little thinking on your part and you&#39;ll understand America built China that has economically challenged our economy, and every other nation that is described as industrial or modern. The World has been lifted by our morals and principals and freedoms and the results that followed.<br />  You, sir or ma&#39;am or it, are that rich kid who, after being given so much, killed for more; you are all those wealthy you despise and think are simply greedy.

He had to do that to get an independent media source for progressives out in the public eye. If he didnt he wouldnt unlike most conservative and general mainstream media outlets that take corporate money and doesnt believe in unionized work environments.<br /><br />Also ben shapiro, nice calling cenk a socialist when hes stated hes more a capitalist guy ... shows how much you know.

Jeff Driscoll you should probably learn the meanings of terms before you use them in arguments. For example sociopaths don‚Äôt take pleasure in the pain of others you haven‚Äôt demonstrated knowledge of a single real symptom of sociopathy. You‚Äôre probably thinking of sadists? You clearly have no idea what kind of behaviors you‚Äôd need to engage in to warrant a 30 day psych eval because enjoying watching liberals bitch and overreact over their candidate losing is far from any of those behaviors. In fact being an actual sadist or sociopath wouldn‚Äôt warrant a psych eval unless you threatened to harm yourself or others or couldn‚Äôt function in daily life. Not sure where Stockholm Syndrome fits in here? As in feelings of trust and affection for someone holding you hostage?

@Smiling Boltbernie is literally an old communist no one likes him except young college kids who want free college and healthcare because they dont want to work and because they are to young remember how bad communism was. And if you believe Bernie&#39;s pitch then you are delusional.  First of Europe is not socialist like bernie says and second because they can only survive because they live off the back of the US. We have an actual strong military and they benefit from it. We lead the world in medical innovation and they copy our medicine. How about u try going to live in Venezuela and see how good bernies socialism works. Venezuela used to be one of the richest companies and now they have a socialist dictator and the citizens are eating dogs.

"@Smiling Bolt I will if a socialist has managed to convince enough uneducated people that the way to prosperity is through raising taxes dramatically on employers, no longer enforcing border security and allowing people to sneak into the country unchecked, eliminating private insurance, ending fracking, downsizing the military dramatically and generally waging war on the principles and economic system that made us the most prosperous and successful country in the history of the human species.  If that happens, you&#39;re damn right I&#39;ll be crying and so will our forefathers and founders of our constitution.  I&#39;m not interested in eating from garbage trucks and bread lines.  A 70%-90% income tax rate on top earners would not create wealth, it would cripple our economy.  You can only take people&#39;s money for so long before the money is gone and then we get to live in the shadows of the former Soviet union, Cuba or Venezuela.  The government gets rich through making promises of equality to the masses while demonizing the wealthy and the people end up depending on it for survival.  It&#39;s all been done before, equality in Venezuela has greatly been improved.  Their citizens are equally hungry, equally poor, equally out of toilet paper lol.
