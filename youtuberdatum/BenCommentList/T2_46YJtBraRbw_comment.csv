So much for the &quot;smarter&quot; conservative having the faintest clue.<br />Twitter cannot censor anyone.  Those attacking the free speech and property rights of tech companies are themselves censorious leftists.<br />No wonder conservatives have resorted to a literal putsch in the American capitol.  There is absolutely zero understanding of politics in this movement.,Peter Smith,2021-01-09T21:49:12Z,0
Republicans will look for any reason to believe they‚Äôre the silent majority and they are constantly and consistently being censored and oppressed when every false claim that ‚Äúbig tech‚Äù has censored ‚Äúthe right‚Äù has been completely debunked.

"Greetings Ben,  <br />While I was watching the hearing vs the media, my You Tube algorithm presented a video that mentioned Silicon Valley&#39;s Slave app. (The video was put up by the BBC). I watched the video, and the &quot;app&quot; mentioned was called &quot;4sale&quot;.  So I looked it up in Google play store, and sure enough, there were 5 versions of the app for different countries, SELLING children as slaves.  If Google monitors apps, then this makes them extremely guilty in the worst way, in my opinion.  I do not know how to link a video (I&#39;m one of the people you correctly describe as being technologically challenged), but there is enough information there to search and find it easily.

It will take a while because they can&#39;t just auto-takedown any app that&#39;s reported, but the more people  that report it, the higher the chance they will see it.

"Here are President Donald Trump‚Äôs Top 13 Pro-Life Accomplishments. Pass it on!<br /><br />President Donald Trump has developed a long list of accomplishments for life since he was elected to office in 2016.<br /><br />From standing up to the United Nations‚Äô pro-abortion agenda to defunding the<br /> abortion giant Planned Parenthood, the Republican president has pleased<br /> pro-lifers with his dedication to protecting unborn babies from<br />abortion.<br /><br />Breitbart recently highlighted some Trump‚Äôs pro-life accomplishments during his first four years. These include:<br /><br />1. Appointing pro-life judges to the Supreme Court and other federal courts.<br /><br />These judges include Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, <br /><br />federal court judges Sarah Pitlyk, Anuraag Hari Singhal, Daniel Mack Traynor and approximately 200 others.<br /><br />It  is significant because abortion activists have relied on leftist<br />activist judges to keep abortion on demand legal and unrestricted for<br />decades. By appointing so many judges, the Trump administration is<br />ushering in change that could see human rights restored to unborn babies<br /> and religious freedoms for pro-life individuals protected.<br /><br />2. Defunding the abortion chains Planned Parenthood and Marie Stopes through the Mexico City Policy.<br /><br />Trump reinstated and later expanded<br /> the policy to cut off more streams of revenue to international<br />non-governmental agencies (NGOs) that promote and/or provide abortions. The rule <br /><br />defunded Planned Parenthood‚Äôs international arm of about $100 million and the British abortion chain <br /><br />Marie Stopes International of about $73 million in U.S. tax dollars.<br /><br />The two pro-abortion groups received millions of American tax dollars under President Barack Obama.<br /><br />SIGN THE PLEDGE: I‚Äôm Voting for President Donald Trump!<br /><br />3. Defunding Planned Parenthood through the Title X program.<br /><br />In  2019, Trump enacted a new Title X rule to ensure that the program does<br />not indirectly fund abortions. Title X provides family planning and<br />other health services for low-income individuals. Planned Parenthood<br />could have complied with the rule by stopping abortions or completely<br />separating its abortion business from its actual health services, but it<br /> refused. Instead, it prioritized abortions over women‚Äôs health. Therefore, it was defunded of about $60 million.<br /><br />The abortion chain challenged the rule in court, but, in May, a federal appeals court upheld the rule.<br /><br />Some pro-abortion Democrat governors defied Trump‚Äôs effort by giving their state taxpayers‚Äô money to <br /><br />Planned Parenthood instead.<br /><br />4. Cutting off taxpayer funding to scientific research that uses aborted baby body parts.<br /><br />The Obama administration gave millions of tax dollars to fund disturbing research studies, including one <br /><br />to create ‚Äúhumanized mice‚Äù with tissue from potentially viable aborted babies. The<br /> Trump administration canceled that contract, and it has been taking<br />other steps to stop funding unethical research, including through the formation of the new advisory board.<br /><br />The bioethics advisory board recently recommended that the government reject funding for 13 of 14 <br /><br />research projects that plan to use aborted baby body parts. Trump appointed a number of leading pro-life researchers and <br /><br />bioethicists to the board earlier this year.<br /><br />5. Issuing new religious freedom rules for Obamacare.<br /><br />As  Breitbart reports: ‚ÄúThe Trump departments of HHS, Treasury, and Labor<br />issued two interim final rules that provided protection from the HHS<br />contraceptive mandate for both religious objectors, such as the Little<br />Sisters of the Poor, and moral objectors, such as pro-life<br />organizations. The new rule also exempted private employers and<br />educational institutions that have sincerely held religious beliefs or<br />moral objections against providing contraceptives or abortifacient<br />drugs.‚Äù<br /><br />The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the rule in July.<br /><br />6. Signing an international declaration urging countries to protect unborn babies and mothers.<br /><br />The Geneva Consensus declaration, signed by Trump administration leaders and 31 other countries this week, <br /><br />sent a clear statement to the United Nations that they will not tolerate its abortion advocacy.<br /><br />It  encourages countries to work to achieve ‚Äúbetter health for women, the<br />preservation of human life and the strengthening of family as the<br />foundational unit of society.‚Äù<br /><br />‚ÄúAbortion  rights advocacy by some governments, world health and other<br />international bodies is detracting attention and resources from women‚Äôs<br />health needs on which there is widespread agreement,‚Äù the declaration<br />states.<br /><br />7.  Defunding the United Nations Population Fund.<br /><br />The Trump administration stopped funding a United Nations agency linked to forced and coerced abortions.<br /> The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) ‚Äúpartners on family planning<br /> activities with the Chinese government agency responsible for these<br />coercive policies,‚Äù the administration said in defense of its decision.<br />China‚Äôs oppressive one child policy, recently changed to a two-child<br />limit, has led to forced and coerced abortions up through nine months of<br /> pregnancy, as well as forced and coerced sterilizations.<br /><br />The  UNFPA has worked hand-in-hand with Planned Parenthood to promote<br />abortion worldwide, and Planned Parenthood was caught sharing offices in<br /> China with UNFPA to promote population control.<br /><br />The decision stopped at least $32.5 million tax dollars from funding the pro-abortion agency in 2017, <br /><br />the Associated Press reported at  the time. The Trump administration redirected the funds to the U.S.<br />Agency for International Development, which provides medical care to<br />families across the world.<br /><br />8.  Sanctioning Chinese communist leaders amid reports of forced abortions<br />and other human rights abuses against Muslim minorities in the Xinjiang<br />province.<br /><br />The Trump administration sanctioned several Chinese government officials in<br /> the wake of an Associated Press report documenting numerous human<br />rights abuses, including forced abortions and sterilizations.<br /><br />Hundreds  of thousands of Uighur women are being subjected to state pregnancy<br />testing, forcibly sterilized and forced to abort their unborn babies,<br />according to the AP. Additionally, at least 1 million Uighur Muslims<br />have been placed in ‚Äúre-education‚Äù camps since in 2017 in China, PBS News reports. According to the AP, <br /><br />one of the main reasons for their detention is having too many children.<br /><br />9. Making it easier for states to defund Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />In 2018, Trump signed an executive order so states have more control over taxpayer funds to<br /> Planned Parenthood and other abortion groups. The U.S. Department of<br />Health and Human Services announced that the administration was<br />rescinding Obama-era Medicaid guideline that limited the way states<br />could take action against Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />After Planned Parenthood was exposed for allegedly selling the body parts of aborted babies, many states <br /><br />wanted to revoke taxpayer funding for the abortion company. However the Obama administration made it <br /><br />difficult for states to do that by  claiming federal control over Medicaid dollars even though states<br />participate with their own taxpayer funds and the federal program. Trump<br /> changed that, and a number of states have since taken action to defund<br />Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />10. Giving Texas a waiver to defund Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />In January, the Trump administration granted Texas a waiver in its long-fought battle to defund <br /><br />Planned Parenthood and use tax dollars to support real women‚Äôs health care.<br /><br />The waiver allowed Texas to defund Planned Parenthood and<br /> other abortion groups from its Healthy Texas Women Program. State<br />lawmakers defunded abortion groups from the program in 2011, but the<br />pro-abortion Obama administration retaliated by revoking federal<br />funding. <br /><br />The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) waiver reversed the <br /><br />Obama-era decision and restored $350 million in federal funding to the<br />program, which provides medical care for low-income women.<br /><br />11. Signing an executive order to protect newborns from infanticide.<br /><br />In September, Trump announced an executive order to do what Democrats in Congress refused more than <br /><br />80 times to do: require medical care for babies who survive abortions.<br /><br />Nancy  Pelosi and House Democrats rejected the Born Alive Abortion Survivors<br />Protection Act more than 80 times. Trump responded with an executive<br />order that requires medical care to be given to infants who are born<br />alive after failed abortion attempts.<br /><br />12. Twelfth, Creating a new office focused on religious freedom and conscience protections.<br /><br />Here‚Äôs  more from Breitbart: ‚ÄúIn January 2018, the Trump HHS established the<br />Conscience and Religious Freedom division of the Office for Civil<br />Rights, which works to protect health care providers who do not wish to<br />participate in abortions from discrimination.‚Äù<br /><br />Last  year, the office became involved in a Vermont nurse‚Äôs case after she<br />said her employer, the University of Vermont Medical Center, tricked her into participating <br /><br />in an abortion against her will. The Trump administration also created a new rule <br /><br />to better enforce conscience protections and punish medical groups that discriminate <br /><br />against pro-life medical workers.<br /><br />In contrast, Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden said one of his first acts as <br /><br />president would be to restore funding to Planned Parenthood.<br /><br />13. Becoming the first president to speak at the March for Life.<br /><br />President  Donald Trump told tens of thousands of pro-life advocates at the March<br />for Life that unborn children have worth and value.<br /><br />‚ÄúEvery child is a precious and sacred gift from God,‚Äù he said during his speech. <br /><br />‚ÄúTogether we must protect, cherish, and defend the dignity and sanctity of every human life.‚Äù",Joe Carr,2020-10-30T13:05:34Z,0

If twitter and FB decide to block posts that mention it, then the attendance will remain so small that even if mainstream media decides to air video of it, the tiny march will create the false impression to conservatives nationwide that interest in conservative protesting does not exist.<br />    That is the true power of social media.  Like a lens it amplifies the communication of one ideology and eradicates the communication of another. It establishes the battlefield equivalent of having satellite communications while the opponent is forced to use smoke signals.<br />    Lacking effective communication, socialism is harder to thwart, and once established whatever movement arises to overthrow it will have to be far more universal and organic, and so far more destructive of life and property than before. The ruling elite better keep the masses sufficiently fed and entertained, or at least under sufficient surveillance to prevent any organic resistance from colonizing. The CCP methods are a convenient framework.  (btw the Hong Kong insurgence is but a minor inconvenience  to CCP. The fact that global support for the HK protesters has not coalesced well illustrates the careful global preparation the CCP has conducted among the elites in other countries)",Overall Great Idea,2020-10-30T12:36:12Z,0

"-- -- -- Only a complete fucking moron who is too stupid to understand the US Constitution and doesn&#39;t care about America&#39;s Middle or Working Classes would support either Biden or Trump for any office higher than Trash Collector .. Never in history have the American People been offered the two least qualified, most incompetent and most criminally corrupt candidates for the office of President -- the Democratic and Conservative choices for 2016 were a complete disaster, and the Democratic and Conservative choices for 2020 are a complete disaster -- The Democrats and Conservatives have failed America once again, just as they have been failing the American People for the last 40 years - because the Democrats and Conservatives do not care about the American People or the laws of our US Constitution that protect the Rights and Freedoms of the American People -- The Democrats and Conservatives only care about the Rich Elite and keeping the Rich Elite in Power .. Blue Collar Americans have been getting the short end of the stick for 40 years, making less and struggling more to pay of their bills, while the Rich Elite have gotten paid higher and higher wages and gained more and more power - chief among them Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Ocasio Cortez .. none of them have ever been poor in their entire lives .. they all come from the families of America&#39;s Rich, Political Elite and they all get special privileges that 90% of Americans have never in their lives received -- Trump and Biden are not candidates for President because they&#39;ve worked to protect the American People - because they haven&#39;t - never in their lives have either one of them ever defended or protected the poor , the Working class or the Middle class -- in fact, they&#39;ve spent their lives doing just the opposite - no, Trump and Biden are candidates because of Billion Dollar Propaganda Machines that lie to the American People and push false narratives of &quot;heroic deeds&quot; that are complete fabrications and inventions of the mind -- Biden has been a criminal his entire life - for 60 years, he&#39;s committed criminal acts against the American People - criminal acts that can be verified by a simple search of his publicly criminal past, since 1960 .. and Trump has been a criminal for his entire life - not a &quot;hero&quot; for the last 4 years, as the Propaganda Machine attempts to spit out, but a Criminal his entire life, since 1965 - a criminal past that is easily confirmed, by a simple search of his public criminal records, stretching across the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and right on through nearly every day of 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 .. Trump&#39;s crimes are so blatant and obvious that a criminal case against Donald Trump would take less than 3 days for a jury to commit him to Federal Prison for the next 244 years, without any chance for parole .. ~ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23endtheconservativeparty"">#EndTheConservativeParty</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23endthedemocraticparty"">#EndTheDemocraticParty</a> Vote <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23independent"">#Independent</a> Vote <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%233rdparty"">#3rdParty</a> Vote <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23constitution"">#Constitution</a>  Vote <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23peopleoverparty"">#PeopleOverParty</a> Vote <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23americaoverparty"">#AmericaOverParty</a> Vote <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bradhartliep"">#BradHartliep</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23president"">#President</a> in November and restore America to the American People .. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23usairforce"">#USAirForce</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23usmc"">#USMC</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23usarmy"">#USArmy</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23usnavy"">#USNavy</a> - I am the only candidate who will protect our US Constitution, restore Justice and defend the Civil and Equal Rights of All Americans against the crimes of America&#39;s Political Elite .. ~ <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23bradhartliep"">#BradHartliep</a> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23president"">#President</a> ..",Brad Hartliep,2020-10-30T05:24:55Z,0

"<b>*BREAKING**</b><br /><br />Here is a story you don&#39;t want to miss. (Please feel free to share.)<br />Joe Biden and his first wife, Neilia, had three children: Hunter, Beau and Naomi.<br />In 1972, Neilia and Naomi, died in a car accident. Joe eventually married a woman named Jill (his current wife).<br />He already knew her because she had been Hunter&#39;s babysitter at the time of the car accident. (Yeah, THAT seems normal- marry the babysitter). They had a daughter named Ashley. Ashley lives &#39;a quiet life&#39; and is frequently in and out of rehab for various substance abuse issues.<br />Now sadly, the sanest, most normal one of the 3 surviving kids, Beau, dies in 2015 from a brain tumor. He had been married to Haillie and they had 2 children, a boy and a girl named Natalie, who was 11 yrs old when her dad died.<br />Enter Hunter Biden, in 2015, to &quot;comfort&quot; his brother&#39;s widow. Mind you, Hunter is married at the time, to Kathleen Biden, since 1993. He starts screwing around with his dead brother&#39;s wife in 2015...his wife Kathleen finds out about it and they separate. Hunter moves in with his dead brother&#39;s wife, Haillie,and her two kids and they have a grand old time. He ultimately gets divorced from Kathleen in 2017. Meanwhile, he starts screwing around with a stripper, while still shacking up with his dead brother&#39;s wife, before his divorce is finalized, and gets the stripper pregnant. Haillie kicks his butt to the curb supposedly for this indiscretion in 2018. He denies the stripper&#39;s baby is his, although a paternity test proves otherwise and eventually he marries a woman named Melissa in 2019 after knowing her for 6 days...<br />Does the tale end there? Why no, no it doesn&#39;t.<br />That just sets the stage...<br />Enter the laptop from hell...loaded with emails, text messages, photos, child pornography, videos, and other sordid digital images of drug use and rampant weirdness....<br />Hunter Biden dropped the laptop off in Delaware, his home state, to get it repaired. It seems he dropped it in some water while in a meth-induced state of mind. He then neglected to pay the $85.00 repair fee and the laptop became the repair shop owner&#39;s property for non-payment. When the owner saw what was on it, he was ao disturbed that he contacted the FBI. No response. The DOJ? No response. Eventually, it landed in Rudy Giuliani&#39;s possession and he turned it over to the Delaware State Police AFTER making 4 copies of the hard drive. Turns out, there&#39;s quite a lot of child pornography on there...much of it involving children on Hunter&#39;s many trips to China. The Chinese Communist Party uses this as a blackmail tactic... They supply the young girls, they film you, unknowingly, and then they can keep you &quot;in line&quot;, while paying you the big $$$ to do their bidding, like lucrative deals with your VP father.<br />Millions of dollars were paid to Hunter Biden for favors with the US Govt while Joe Biden was VP under Obama.<br />For 8 years Hunter made the contacts and split the money with his father, referred to as the &quot;Big Guy&quot; in all emails detailing how their ill gotten gains would be split up amongst all the criminals involved.<br />Joe Biden sold out his country and used his meth head son to do it. ...<br />But, IT GETS WORSE. Today, on the laptop, emails were released between Beau Biden&#39;s widow, Haillie, and Joe Biden in 2017 and more in 2018 when she and Hunter were still living together. They were casually talking about the continual &quot;sexually inappropriate behavior&quot; she had witnessed from Hunter toward her 14 year old daughter, Natalie, HIS NIECE!..<br />She told Joe that she felt she had put her children in a dangerous situation by getting involved with Hunter Biden. Joe knew his son was screwing around with his niece and he advised his daughter-in-law to go to therapy.....No one went to the police and the abuse escalated. THAT is the main reason she broke off her relationship with Hunter. Among the pictures of Hunter having sex with young Asian children, there were hundreds of provocative pictures of a 14 year old girl, mainly topless, and hundreds more of Hunter Biden, in sexual poses with her, HIS NIECE. She was 14 yrs old and HE WAS 48!!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: ANY MAN WHO CAN&#39;T TAKE CARE OF HIS OWN HOUSE, HAS NO BUSINESS BEING IN THE WHITE HOUSE.<br /><br />THE END.....but, is it? Nope. Rudy says there is more to come, primarily involving Joe Biden getting rich off laundering foreign money through our country, using his son as intermediary. Biden is as dirty and crooked as they come. Hillary looks clean compared to him. Now it makes sense why Obama REFUSED to endorse him as the DNC candidate until he was the last man standing!<br /><br />More to come...",Sandy Deason,2020-10-29T21:15:24Z,2

"Democrat-run cities can be safe, but consider this, out of the 10 most dangerous cities in the United States, every single one has a Democrat for a mayor. Now the reason I say Democrat-run cities can be safe, is because seven out of 10 of the safest cities in the United States, have a Republican mayor, and the remaining three I believe have a Democrat. Then again, I&#39;m from South Carolina, where we actually have libertarian Mayors in some cities and towns,  so we&#39;re pretty open to having neither. I live in an unincorporated area anyway, but there&#39;s really not that much of a difference between Democrats and Republicans, local level in the Deep South.

My only contention would be against a predisposed notion that all Dems are bad/communists/etc. That&#39;s virtually the same illogical standpoint that certain extreme leftists have taken against the police (the idea that a few bad seeds represent the entire group).<br /><br />For example, perhaps many of the leaders of the Democratic party are riddled with malignant intent, which I would say hating those individuals would be justified. But many of civilians that idolize or follow them are usually just ignorant or misinformed. Some are actually bad, but not all.¬†<br /><br />I think that the Republican party stands a better chance of illustrating the flaws in the Dems&#39; ideas without hatred fueling our motives.¬†Republicans should aim to restructure the Dems&#39; way of thinking and bring some over to our side, but no one will ever want to join a group of hateful people especially if they&#39;re the target of the hatred.

Even in the case of illegal content the job is for law enforcement to deal with it not tech with zero responsibility or liability.

All that to the side, as a moderate/conservative, my opinion is every conservative, moderate or slightly left that does not agree with Twitter&#39;s censorship should ban twitter or these total left leaning social media websites. That would cut their business in half and lose their censorship power. If everyone would stand together and move to Parler, it would hit twitter pretty hard. Then all of the liberal snowflakes would start to fight with each other because they will have to find something to keep themselves unhappy. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23boycotttwitter"">#boycotttwitter</a>, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23twittersucks"">#twittersucks</a>",Gixxersport,2020-10-29T18:15:18Z,0

"Section 230.  We shouldn&#39;t revoke it, but ENFORCE IT.    If major tech companies want it, they should live up to it.  If they don&#39;t they loose it.  If it&#39;s legal, allow it.  If it&#39;s not, report it to the authorities.  Set up parental filters.  G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17 or none.   And have a block feature.  Then off you go.  If the tech companies violate it, they get a 3 strike rule.  They loose it for 6 months for the 1st violation, and can be sued.  When it&#39;s restored, all lawsuits that were started in that period are still valid.  2nd violation, 1 year gone.  3rd violation, permanently gone.",James Palmer,2020-10-29T17:17:37Z,1

It&#39;s the sane thing to do to combat and mitigate problematic content occurring on these platforms. This idea that twitter conflates right wing content with such other problematic content resulting in a political bias is something that literally Dorsey and the others want to help combat and determine the extent to which it is actually a thing. From what I saw in the hearing, particularly from Dorsey, is that they want to add transparency and accountability to the moderation process and enable third parties to audit. Heck, Dorsey even said let&#39;s give users the option to choose recommendation algorithms, open them up to third parties to publish custom recommendation algorithms, or even provide the choice to disable recommendation features altogether. Ultimately that would place the burden of trust at the hands of other entities than twitter, and would serve as a model for the other platforms to follow in suit.",Ianstudent,2020-10-29T20:17:31Z,1
