alfie and i are sat in the car now
and the film is playing they'll bring
this picture
now bring you some figgy pudding that's
good
hey [ __ ] i'm gonna choke on my food
[Music]
good afternoon everybody it is currently
thursday so this is gonna be a two day
vlog because
all of this morning i had a lot
of my i always call them big business
meetings so i have them
every month which is a meeting with my
business advisor my accountant
my lawyer and maddie who is obviously my
manager
and we go through finances outgoings
incomings basically everything
um and this was our end of year
and so it was a very big important one
and
um that's what i've been doing all
morning and that isn't
the funnest vlog i'm not gonna lie gonna
be a bit of a shorter one
this thursday but i'm really excited for
the evening
because every year i get
what's going on with my tv i can hear it
but there's nothing on it every year
we put something together for all of our
employees and everyone we work with
and it's usually a highlight
for me i love it it really it's one of
those days or evenings
that puts me in
the festive spirit and this year has
been
really tough on everyone but it's been
particularly weird
not getting to work with the group of
people that i work with
and i love having the office space i
love bouncing off of people
i love that vibe of like the team being
together
and it's obviously
not been like that this year because of
covid and everybody working from home
so more than ever i feel like it's
needed
but it has to be done in a safe way
and for a while we were like toying like
we just can't do anything like there's
nothing we can hello
there is nothing we can do that is safe
um that is allowed uh it might just be
something we have to completely strike
off all together which sucks so we just
thought there must be something else
that we can do
where we can all be there it can feel
festive it can be a really nice
thing that's still safe um and then
we thought let's see if we can do
the tully's drive-in cinema we went
there
was it last month maybe two months ago
for one of the halloween viewings and it
was so good you just drive in you stay
in your car
it's so safe um and
i just felt like that was such a good
idea and something that everybody could
do
and feel comfortable in the knowledge
that they can stay in their car
and they're not coming into contact with
anybody but we're all sort of still
there we can all like wave
each other um put our gifts like on the
bonnets of the cars
um and still get to experience something
together
and hopefully get people in the festive
spirits so that is what we're doing
tonight i've also
got um little sacks
with a little snack box so everybody
will get one of those i think we've got
some pjs
we've got some bits and pieces from
skinny dip i believe i know that chelsea
piers have very kindly sent over pajamas
for everybody
um and i just
i think that it's it's the best we can
make of this situation
and i'm i'm actually really really
excited
even though it's very very different
from the christmas parties we usually
have where we're all
sharing and singing into a microphone
which
definitely isn't what we will be doing
this year
um at least we're still able to
kind of be near each other and to
celebrate
uh the graze boxes look amazing they're
done by stylish eats
um which is the company that um
alfie and i have used over the years for
any little grazing bits
i'm excited i'm glad we picked home
alone and actually because
we have just told people to come and
stay in their cars we've also just said
like bring a plus one like bring your
other half like
so our accountant and our lawyer are
coming with their kids as well which
will be
so cute i think this afternoon i'm gonna
pack up the sacks to take over to people
and that's my little update
and i'm excited for you to
to witness the drive-in cinema
experience
it's a little bit later and i
have finished wrapping all of
most of the team's presents um turning
everything off
as we're about to head to tully's farm
or tully's drive-in
i'm also just really excited to properly
sit and watch home alone
because i've had it on in the background
but i've not properly
sat and watched it so i'm excited about
that
taking a throw you might laugh at this
but
i bought these throws last year and i
ordered so many of them
that i knew i could keep some unopened
and open them again this year
in case they didn't bring any new ones
out uh excuse me no no no you've got
your little
outside feet on my brand new throw get
off so i'm going to take this
i don't know whether we'll be sitting
outside oh because there is an option to
sit outside your car
um to get better view or if i'll just
use this and snuggle
up in the car we shall see
you excited i'm actually very excited
it's gonna be good isn't it i feel like
we couldn't have done
a better christmas work party
even if 2020 pandemic
wasn't happening do you know what i mean
yeah it's so fun such a sick christmas
party
whatever yeah it's also social distance
and it's amazing
right let's go let's hit the road
we're here we've got some food
we've got our little you just read me
about the food i forgot how good it is i
did get the cheese bacon burger the
cheeseburger
everyone's here i don't want to film
everyone's number plates but
yes
[Music]
alfie and i are sat in the car now
and the film is playing
how fun is this this is literally
the dream evening we've ordered
some food so they've got these which are
the most insane thing i've ever eaten
these are chips
with cheese and bacon bits and they
taste like those crisps frazzles
and then there's a burger cheeseburger
oh my god oh my god that looks insane
and then i just went for normal cheese
fries which i'm regretting now
oh really do you want some of these i'll
just go for one more
of yours got a cheeky little burger
made up these little
stockings for everybody well pessi and
sac
i feel like i've said hersey and zach a
lot in this one

life
until these this is actually alfie's one
i've got mine behind but this is the one
with our snacks in it
are you ready this i haven't even
finished eating my burger yet and we're
already getting onto the snack
look at this she's done us a movie treat
box
so we've got homemade guacamole and
salsa with nachos
iced lemon iced shortbread oh salted
caramel popcorn and a selection of
sweets and chocolate
oh even the ribbon looks like a movie
oh my god look at this she's just so
talented isn't she
the box is a bit warped we've broken the
box but you know what
how do you open it i think it's the
other side i think it's like this and
then i think that
and then the watch it slides out that's
so nice
oh my
we can put it here in the middle if you
want yeah so we can put it there
chips and dip that's what i was really
after
we've got some water some more popcorn
oh it's falling out a bit
water this is yours i'm showing you
some more chocolate look at this this

sent some pajamas and me and you have
got matching
look how nice it is feel her soft
so me and you've got not just me and you
and nola's got matching
i'm joking on the chocolate
[Laughter]
hello everybody it's friday it's friday
then
so today been a bit of a slow start to
the day i'm not gonna lie
um woke up again quite early with nala
my little precious bean alfie took her
to the vets
all is good with her leg so we're really
really happy about that the bandage is
still on
oh focus she's got a new one she's got a
blue one this time
she's down there um but her leg is
healing really well i believe they took
out stitches
so that's really positive nice positive
start to friday
last night was so good i
absolutely loved it and everybody else
really loved it as well we've had lots
of messages today
of everyone saying like that was the
most festive i felt like all month
um and to be honest it i feel like it
was one of the most festive things we've
been able to do as
well so i really really really loved it
and uh it just felt so safe everyone was
kind of in their
cars or sat outside their car um
and home alone is just such a good film
such a good film we've still got some
snacks left over actually so i've been
picking out of that grazing box all day
the tully's driving cinema
so good i actually think a drive-in
cinema needs to be more of a permanent
thing um
obviously um lots of them have kind of
popped up
as an alternative to being able to go to
the actual cinema this year
but i know that driving cinemas are
already quite big
or quite a thing in america but not
really here
uh but it's definitely the sort of thing
i would just do
as and when any time um i i love it
it's such a cool thing to just be able
to like cozy up in your car and just
feel like you're in your own little
your own little world watching
a film highly recommend if you've not
done that today
much like yesterday is uh sort of tying
a lot of things up this is alfie's last
day of work
which she's very excited about um before
signing off
for christmas um and i think that's the
same for a lot of people
um so it's been very quiet on
all fronts i'm really really excited it
feels like a friday like it really feels
like a friday today sorry i just
started drinking some coke and that was
not good timing so because we weren't
all able to like
really socialize or talk much last night
we are doing a team
zoom um at four o'clock which is why i'm
wearing
something festive the dress code is
dressed to impress
so that's what i aim to do we're gonna
do um
a number of different things we have
another little grazing board that we've
sent out to everybody
i think this one is like a little
charcuterie board so there's cheese
and there's meats and like lots of
little bits and pieces which
uh i'm very excited for so people have
got those and a little bottle of
prosecco
as well to drink um for us to all cheers
uh cheers the year away
just wish each other a merry christmas
so i'm really excited about that it's
actually been a while
since i've done a zoom quiz and i
believe that holly has put together
the most epic of all christmas quizzes
um so i'm excited about that and alfie
and i
are going to give awards to specific
people
that um in like really funny kind of
just comedic categories
so we've got little like trophies to
give people which i'm excited to do
um so yeah i just think it's gonna be a
nice a nice little
wholesome hour and a half of just
wishing each other a merry christmas
and eating food i have not written
a single christmas card yet this year
and i'm in two minds
about whether i should or shouldn't
because is it too late
i don't know i like writing christmas
cards i like the
the task of writing christmas cards and
i myself
um a cards person i love when someone
writes me a card
um words are my love language
words of affirmation oh let me know what
yours is and if you've not ever done the
love language test
you should definitely go and check it
out i think you just have to search like
love language quiz online maybe and it
comes up
um so i am words of affirmation so i
love words words to me
are my thing and
what was yours actually alf do you
remember yours
what your love language
quality time yeah so our fees is quality
time and mine is words of affirmation
to be honest though i feel like i need
to redo it i wonder if it would still be
the same i think i did it about
two or three years ago so i do wonder
but i do know i like words which is why
i also really cherish
cards and other people's time and
thoughts
and efforts into a card um i would
honestly just be happy if all i got for
christmas day was
cards from people i love them
and i'm one of these people that can
never throw any cards away which is
just i mean does everyone have that
drawer in their kitchen that's just full
of random
[ __ ] because ours is full of cards
that's
like our card draw our card draw and
batteries and like torches and
like tape measures and stuff but i
really value a card but i haven't
written any which is bad i don't know
do i start now if i wrote cards now and
send them
would they actually get there before
christmas that is the question
while we wait for the zoom to begin
so i would share with you the fact that
i found
a twix winter spice
oh extra what does that mean it's longer
than normal
i bought four of them actually because i
was like if i like these and then i
can't find them anywhere i'm gonna be
really annoyed
they're so good really good
it's quite like a syntheticy festive
spice flavor but
i'm not complaining i quite like it
that's good try it i found this
in um where do i get this into
in a garage
very happy with that i like that you've
just adopted this chair
over here i sat in it when it used to be
where the tree was
i feel like it's like if i sit on the
sofa i get too comfortable and i don't
end up getting any work done
if i sit in this chair it just makes me
sit properly
um i even said in my vlog the other day
we need to move that into the
conservatory
but it doesn't look like we're going to
your mum your mum will want to sit in
that on christmas day
it's quite a nice one try this festive
twix what are these i saw these in the
room you bought like five of them yeah
try it it's a festive
festive twix
whoa do you like it
or do you not like it i don't know i
wasn't sure if you would like it or not
yeah it's like cinnamony it's festive
spice oh winter spice keep calling it

like it
