you're gonna you're excited due date

literally half of our family
we just you know we thought let's just
add another one into the mix keep it
going
keep it going it seems to be going good
we've got nice people around us
yeah sad another said another oh no
what that's literally this is typical
zoe
battery fashion where are your spares
inside in the kitchen
when i turned this on it was full and i
was like oh that's you can't ever trust
a full battery no but you can use yours
look
no mine's got no battery mine's dead
well then you can't speak
no because i
i haven't got a video to film i wish i
had the energy to go and get my spare
battery
it should be ready now new battery
new battery installed okay where did
where did we get to
i don't think we got very far at all no
we just said we're having a baby it's
during september
and that's it guys so thanks so much for
watching we'll see you in september
we'll see you in september
last week we had our 12 week scan which
is why obviously alfie and i
now feel super comfortable and ready to
share the news with
you all we've known for quite a while
well i was technically pregnant in
vlogmas and i didn't know
yeah that's isn't that live at christmas
you were pregnant yeah
but we didn't know yet so you can go
back and watch that vlogmas just
if you want to know it knowing that
there's a secret and even i don't know
it
we had our 12 week scan and that was
amazing everything went
as good as possible in terms of health
of the baby yeah
it was wild though seeing yeah
we have a little picture because you
know
you can't even tell me i was about to
say
something could we do no extra i so
nearly just said that we also know
the sex of our baby um
and we weren't sure if we were gonna
share it at first but then
it was something that we were so excited
about and we've been sharing with
friends and family
and we just know we're gonna say
we're gonna be vlogging and sharing like
this process and we just knew we would
end up saying it anyway so we the reason
we know
so early by the way is that we decided
to do a harmony
blood test it tests for the three most
common
chromosomal genetic conditions and
tells you a probability chance of your
baby having those and
luckily our baby came back as the lowest
probability that you can get
low risk amazing yeah but it also
it also tells you the sex of the baby we
wanted to know
which we both said we both thought about
it yeah we did your mum
didn't know for you and joe no i don't
think it was really an option
when my mum had me in jail i don't think
you could find out then
and we were just like yeah let's know
mum was like make it a surprise it's the
only surprise you'll ever have
we didn't mind either way it's just so
exciting it's so interesting to know
like
we weren't fussed whether it's a boy or
whether it's a girl
but it's just so exciting to know so and
obviously the health of the baby was
like
that's the reason why we did the harmony
test but when they said like would you
like to find out the sex of the baby
when you do this test we were like
yeah yes please i think it's worth
mentioning that we haven't mentioned in
my video
what we thought the baby was before oh
i was absolutely adamant that this was a
boy
the entire pregnancy so far even in
december when i didn't know i was
pregnant
i was having dreams about baby boys and
that was actually one of my
things that i was like i must be
pregnant i'm dreaming about babies all
the time
i mean we were trying so that also that
could be why i was dreaming about it but
every time i dreamt it was a boy in my
dream
and just all these little things i was
like this must be a boy
i can't remember i think it was a
relating symptoms to
how your mum felt during the first
trimester yes like
she felt far more sick with me with you
than she did with joe and things like
that and you were like comparing like
okay so if my mom felt this and i'm
feeling this
this probably means this i was adamant i
just in my heart just
thought it's a boy like i just know it
is from day one
and what did you think adamant years ago
because you're the older sibling you're
the first child of your mom and dad
poppy's zelda sibling first child of my
mom and dad that's what you can
so i'm like the only yeah the only kind
of
experience i have of children is older
daughter younger
younger boy yeah do you know what i mean
yeah yeah so i was adamant i was like
if it's following the pattern of my
family and your family
and now the person who was right raised
their hand
it's like a little girl i was like
wasn't i so shocked i was like
which i just feel how is it not a boy i
always get it so wrong even when i guess
other people's
babies i get it so wrong that's the most
exciting
picture we are ever gonna see in our
lives and it's only going to get
crisper the bigger she gets
the focus she's getting crispy
do you know what i mean like this oh
yeah it's going to be even more also you
can do i don't know whether we're going
to whatever you can do with those like
no i think they're called 4d yeah but i
think it's
what's the fourth dimension i don't know
but i think they're called forwarding
scans
so yes we're having a little girl we are
over the moon
as alfie said either way we just wanted
a healthy baby we had no preference
whatsoever
and touchwood everything so far so fast
as good as we could bloody hope for yes
and we're just really excited to get to
sit down and share this with you because
we're so aware that
for so many of you watching our channels
over the years like
i mean we've both been making videos now
for like 12 years or something crazy
before we even met each other before we
literally we didn't even know each other
when people could have people could be
watching this channel before
we got together yeah and so many of you
have been there from like
day one of our relationship to like this
point which for alfie and i just feels
like such a
huge like moment in our relationship and
we've shared so much with you guys over
the years that we were so
so excited to be able to sit down and
share this with you because this is just
the best thing the most exciting thing
that we think wanted to share
there's a lot of people that have been
hoping for this moment to one day happen
like if i think back about comments and
tweets i feel like instagram
dms or people being like where are you
gonna have children i'm like
it's here this is the moment this is the
moment very lucky we're
so lucky very grateful and lucky and
every single day we wake up and we're
like is this real like is this actually
happening like
especially because there's not it's no
punch you want to see
do you want to see the bump guys
you're gonna have to zoom in to move the
camera a little bit further back
whoa
but we've spoken to um what's the person
saying who does the scans the
sonographer
who says because every size and how
zoey's mom's bump
came about kind of thing i'm quite small
as well so he was like oh yeah you won't
show your ages and i was like
okay yeah all right then i don't mind as
long as she's
happy as long as she's still growing in
there which but it was funny because
alfie and i were like yeah when we
get to announce like we could take a you
can have a bomb you can turn around and
be like
and just have a bump and i have nothing
i don't even look like i'm bloated i did
have a couple of nights of looking
really bloated didn't i but now i think
it was just bloated it was definitely
blown because
i don't think she grew and then just
shrunk it
obviously we have been in a national
lockdown
here in england and actually it was the
uk right this time it was everywhere i
feel like most of the world's been
locked down in
some way or another um so it meant that
us telling family and friends was so
different to what we ever imagined
wasn't it yeah
it literally couldn't even be in person
like we're just like facetiming your mom
while she's on a dog walk and we're like
we got some news i'm having a baby um
but everyone is so excited
and it's it was moments like that i feel
like that made it
feel so much more real like every time
we told
somebody it was like and every time
someone mentions it back
so we've told by the time we're like
we're filming this we've told everyone
we
want to tell you but that's by the time
it goes up
not by the time we're filming it like
right now right now as we're filming
it's not only like
10 people know yeah and every time one
of those people mentions it to me i'm
like
how do you know i'm like what do you
mean wait wait wait i'm like what have i
done what i'll eat
every time i put up an instagram story
i'm like wait did i put up a wrong
picture did i put a picture of something
else up
honestly i have discovered the last
three months that i
just i hate having secrets yeah
i felt like such a traitor like i just
feel like i'm such an open
person that not being able to share like
the most exciting thing i've
ever gone through is so alien to me
but that's why we haven't posted much
because if we if we were posting we'd
have to be lying about what we're
actually
i really hated and therefore we just
haven't really posted much online
yeah which um i guess will now make
sense but also i've not felt like
my my most upbeat my most peak
but you felt a lot better than what what
we thought you were gonna feel yeah and
i'm gonna
do like videos all about like the first
trimester and like my pregnancy journey
like separate to this um so if you do
have any questions then
send them to me on instagram or you're
gonna get here it's more questions than
you've ever had in your life
but i am planning to like make some like
you know baby rated content because
we're about to be a mum we've always
filmed you know what we're getting up to
and my content and your content is very
much like lifestyle focused
and now this is going to be a pretty big
part of our life so
it's it's going to be something that
features a bit more in our content
so i hope you're okay with that i hope
you're excited you're excited i'm sure
there's so many people that have grown
up and they're in the exact same
position
yeah i said it a million times we i feel
like today all we said is we're really
excited but
we're just so happy so excited so happy
so excited
and uh we can't wait
to share this new journey
wild journey with you i'm so burpee
i hope you guys are loving this very
spring
setting i feel like i can't really see
the camera it's my favorite time because
it feels like a new leaf
feels fresh it feels like new beginnings
because all the like
baby bunnies are there and like all the
bulbs come out so i just thought it
would be nice to film this outside new
beginnings
it's not as cold sun's out
birds are singing babies growing babies
growing
we're obviously um still kind of
deciding
what we want to share um in terms of
like
i guess content how much detail we're
going to show what we don't show
yeah so we're not sure about that yet
but it's something that we'll
learn learn do over the time over the
time this is as i said very new to us
so we'll see how we go um alfie also
filmed a video
where we um announced that we're having
a baby
and also you're gonna be making more
videos that are a bit more like focused
on
like the partner's perspective and like
the men's
perspective which you didn't find a lot
of
comments no whenever i'm searching
there's not really
there's not really much about the person
who is with the person who is pregnant
i'm not gonna make like specific whole
videos necessarily on anything like that
but just throughout vlogs i'm kinta
you'll just get alfie's perspective on
it yeah just show my perspective of
what the other person the relationship
or the jobs they take up all the things
that all the meals they have to now cook
absolutely everything and just be ready
at all times
i've never woken up consistently so
early in my life
to just make nice breakfast fruit salad
fruit salads and take nala out
and yes
how have you done that what is it i
don't know
it doesn't feel real like i think until
i press live on this video
it just won't feel right i don't know
how people are gonna react
i mean i hope they're excited of course
of course the sun setting it looks so
nice now
anyway i'm gonna leave that there
in september there will be a new
addition to the family
life is about to get very busy today
very exciting i'm so excited literally
you're about to be a mum
yeah i know you keep saying that to me
you're about to be a dad
yeah no that's cool isn't it yeah daddy
oh no no i don't like that
i feel sick why just do
because you're pregnant yeah why do you
mean why because you're pregnant why do
you think
well no i didn't know if it was the
excitement of just like saying it that
you're just like that's probably what's
making me feel more sick it's just that
time of day isn't it
should i put you back in bed let's take
put me in the bath look at that tiny
little bunny
where about the wood over there in the
middle it's just eating some grass
oh can you see it are you sure that's a
bunny or not a rat no it's a bunny i'm
in a bloody wrap i don't know it looks
like it's got a long tail
oh no that's a twig oh it's nice to get
some fresh air though
isn't it oh my god what's
should we arrived it together yeah if
you're not going to break the new chair
as well
um you should sketch down
after alfie and i did our 12-week scan
we both said to each other we would
order one
baby clothing one thing exactly it had
to be on the day of the 12-week scan
it was so hard to pick something that
was like
the one also i feel like it was just the
pressure of it being the first thing we
bought
this is the first baby item and we're
gonna keep this forever we've ever
bought
are you ready we didn't buy the toy we
were gonna buy one outfit one toy
but we can still do it yeah i can't open
that
so we ordered this from a website called
um claudenco i feel like this is the
weirdest angle i'm literally like should
we go and sit over there
there we go there we go oh my gosh
oh my god
it's tiny it
is tiny
that's newborn size
that is that is so cute but like imagine
now
jordan curry imagine now holding up and
then just being like
like a tiny little baby like that's how
big she's gonna be
look i hold her do you know what i mean
does every couple do this when they
order their first baby item
yeah that's so small yeah that is small
although i feel like if we're talking
that coming out of you then it is big
yeah let's be real i've got to come out
oh that is the cutest thing i'm so glad
that it's
milking it it's lovely quality as well
isn't it
that is very cute where are we going to
put it oh my god i don't know
are you happy with our first item i'm so
happy i just
kind of want to get a matching adult one
i kind of now just want to buy loads of
outfits
no we can't go from like choosing one
to then having 20. oh my god it's so
tiny it feels
so good to just be able to
say i'm having a baby
um because now i can resume
as i was before yeah i didn't upload
i haven't uploaded i don't actually
normally upload vlogs until like the
middle of february anyway
because doing vlogmas usually means that
i don't film through january
and then i kind of lose my confidence
with vlogging and it takes me a bit
longer to kind of get
back and i just i find the start of the
year such a
weird time to like get
going like i just feel like i lose my
motivation
that plus being pregnant was
just i just didn't want to film or do
anything
and i've been writing a book which has
not been the easiest because i just feel
so unmotivated and so uncreative
but any time that i have had the energy
i've i've put it into writing the book
oh my god i'm so gassy that is why i
haven't really filmed so
i hope you understand i hope this is
made up for it um but i do feel like i
can film going forward now
it just felt so weird to like be
harboring this
secret if i just come on and make a vlog
i feel like
a people are gonna know that i just i'm
just a bit more lackluster than usual
and also
i think i've just got it in my head that
like everyone would just be so convinced
like oh she's pregnant i can just tell
now that you know i can just pick up the
camera as and when i'm feeling good um
i am as i'm filming this about
to reach week 13
or no i'm about to go into week 14 but
hit
week 13 um which is the second trimester
so fingers crossed i start getting my
energy back
and the nausea isn't as like
there because it has been very up and
down like some days i'm like oh i feel
like i'm getting my energy back and then
it'll reach like four o'clock and i'm
like i feel so i'm gonna do a whole
video
on the first trimester if that's
something that you want
i know i found myself watching a lot of
those videos
and i found them so helpful um and so
reassuring because that first trimester
is such like a lonely time
um and you just want to be able to reach
out to everyone who you know who've
already experienced it and be like what
do i do
yeah i'm excited to do that i'm gonna go
and have a bath now i'm gonna take this
makeup off
i'm gonna run a bath how are you feeling
about it
i feel like she doesn't know but she
knows something's up with me
don't you you know something's up with
me because i've been in bed a lot
i just wanted to say um thank you for
being so patient
um with the vlogs um and the fact that
there wasn't one
but i was making a human and i didn't
feel great
so that's where i've been i feel like
that's all i'm gonna film for today i
will probably pick the camera up
tomorrow or the next day
i'm planning on uploading this next week
don't mind my bedside table
i've basically lived
on sprite for three months

absolute lifesaver
