we underestimated how cold it would be
on Highline we found this sad
we are currently shooting some photos
with Brandon well for
[Music]
good morning it is Thursday and today it
is a very sunny day in New York so we've
started our day off very early what's
the time 723 we're all up all out
because we wanted to catch the sunrise
and it looks epic we've made it oh my
camera just will not focus we've made it
to the High Line
he's mr. stone nothing
it wasn't yay it's heavy now go to the
gym la
I think we underestimated how cold it
would be on the High Line
it is like freezing and how he doesn't
come from how do you ensure never heard
of this I mean I'm just gonna in life so
the thing we didn't really consider was
once we got to the house how would we be
like which bit of the High Line do we go
to to see the Sun Rise or to see the Sun
so we've just walked for a really long
time and now we've sort of got to the
end is this the end of it
no it goes round oh I didn't realize how
long the highlight was like it's really
long I guess this is the bit open to
7:00 a.m. because it has an opening time
yeah where's Artie she's thinking oh we
found the Sun finally
three the gap sure gonna be oh wow he
needs all the coffee then clearly I've
come for a hot chocolate
we've come out to near Central Park and
like oh wow that light flare and we've
just stopped in somewhere called pick a
bagel and funnily enough I really
struggled to pick a bagel because I
didn't know who I wanted it was very
overwhelming so I literally have gone
with the most basic mozzarella and
tomato smells good
Alfie's is blooming massive well we got
chicken I do not they give me the big
that's like reduce our leader to the
mouth after that right
I'm going to attempt it but yes I cannot
you're still just waiting for that and
then we're going to head into Central
Park because we were going to head into
West Village weren't we
but then last minute I was like guys
today's really sunny we should
definitely do Central Park from the Sun
and then tomorrow it looks like it's
going to rain
so we're better off switching it round
and doing West Village tomorrow and then
making the most of the Sun and being in
Central Park which is what we're going
to do after we finish this bagel so I'm
excited to see all the Christmassy
Central Park nur is that good
q well birdies we're now in Central Park
finally we've made it and it's a
beautiful day
hi squirrel I wish we brought some nuts
in famous scene from one of the films
when they brought across there ran a
crosswalk where she jumps over and runs
across it to escape somebody is that
home alone and that is serendipity yeah
that's the one which is a great film if
you I feel like I said this last time we
were here I'm having major déjà RV we've
also got that thing where because my
mouth and face is so cold I'm speaking
back not Phil oh my god okay I thought
that dog was a very big squirrel then
that we freaked me out yeah I feel like
I can't feel like my face move which
feels very peculiar just climbing up
some rocks in Central Park you know hey
this is Sookie
I don't I
[Music]
I think this is my favorite ice cream
love
[Music]
[Music]
one of my favorite little spots in
Central Park
this water bit with this in the
background what I mean is this lake in
this building it just looks very nice
look at the reflection on the water but
a better picture you'd like guys a bit
of reflection here look you look cool
standing there this lighting is lovely
perfect for sunset of the rock finally
heading up to thank you finally heading
up to the top of the rock yeah lovely
chandelier I'm kinda scared of this left
I'm not gonna lie no this little we
literally it's gonna be like 22 seconds
we'll be in there
I'm scared of it being quick how many
because what you do if you jump then
obviously it goes up and you don't go up
to in the air just I can't no audio for
25
[Music]
[Music]
okay that wasn't so bad
Lucky's back because it's really hard to
see
so if they looked on the rock but it's
so busy that I'm kind of just looking at
this this is my view
I'm just watching everyone else take
pictures thankfully Alfie's doing a
time-lapse which I'll steal from him

like just realized no it's not so it's
very busy at this time but it looks nice
