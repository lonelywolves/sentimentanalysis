in doing so with her barking
she just sprayed the bed
and oh my god
[Music]
but look in there i think i look this
granny needs to get to bed
[Music]
good morning it's the weekend
and i'm happy about it starting my
morning off i've still got tears in my
eyes
somehow i got on to
watching tom and joanna
tom's wedding speech god
i've seen it so many times but it's
always on my home page
on youtube and i was like oh i just
haven't seen this in a while i just
watched that
every time that's how my morning's going
my battery died i don't know where i was
i think i was basically just saying that
i've been crying like videos all morning
i am now i've just finished editing the
video
guys i've been up since 4 am again
nala just her tummy is just
broken and i am broken as well
so i'm feeling pretty tired um but i'm
taking it chill today i think i'm gonna
run myself a bath
which is what i'm doing now and i'm just
gonna soak for a bit
maybe do a little face mask
put some under eye masks on because
i need it the last of the christmas
presents for some of the girls in the
office or in the team
arrived this morning thank goodness
um so i am gonna wrap those and then
i think i might see if we can drive them
and drop them at their houses
might not be today might be another day
but that's my morning so far editing
trying to get a bit more sleep looking
after nala
and watching videos that i know will
make me cry
does anyone ever do that when you click
on a video you like this one or
this one will get me oh god i also
just need to tidy me and alfie just keep
saying like we need to make the house
like christmas ready
and we've done little bits here and
there but
it's not enough i want to like properly
tidy
like get everything sorted feel like our
house is just all in order
and that everything's wrapped and ready
and i want to do the table
i do think though this might be a video
where i'm not wearing any makeup all day
i just don't know if i can be bothered
i'm gonna have a chilled tidying sorting
saturday
and not wear any makeup right i'm gonna
go and check on my bath
decide what i want to put in it what's
in here
oh okay i'm gonna do this
i don't know what this one is but smells
great
pop that there ready
face mask i'm gonna go for is this one
this is the tula skincare
starbrite nourishing and brightening
cosmic hydrogel
masks and
oh i feel like i bought some pixie ie
masks where have i put those
found them and i'm going to do some of
these pixie
beautify brightening eye patches
i'm excited about this my own little
panther sesh
i changed my mind after my bath
and doing my masks i felt fresh
and i was like actually i kind of want
to put some makeup on
because it will make me feel better so i
did and i've put on
a nice little loungewear set this one is
from
karen millen it feels very soft
alfie has gone to shoot some content
uh i think somewhere and what i think i
might do in this vlog
is a little q and a with alf which i
hope in turn will produce something
actually worth you watching
rather than just me being like guys i'm
so tired today i'm just waiting for him
to come back
what's this on tv some kind of cute
little film i've got my shadow she's
being
very clingy today i think it's just
because she's not feeling good
you're not feeling good today hello
you looking at my camera can you see
yourself
look who's that can you see
who's that do you see
is that you
does anyone else have a dog that watches
tv like an actual human
she's now watching the tv
what's happening what is that
she's just being so cute today i can't
handle you we had new bedding on the bed
yesterday
the lovely um christmas trees that i
showed you
and i was on facetime to poppy and
nala barked at a couple of dogs on the
tv this is why it's just reminded me
and in doing so
obviously pugs have a very exposed
back end bless them um
in doing so with her barking
just sprayed the bed in
for any of you that ever watch my videos
and you think oh my god she's just got
the perfect life
sometimes my dog shits all over my brand
new christmas bedding
but bless her look how she's laying
can you see that
she's basically my own little hot water
bottle at all times
she definitely doesn't seem herself
today probably
because she's tired anyway i'm gonna
wrap some presents
while i wait for alfie to get back and
i need to now like chug
loads of water because i made my bath
too hot then you know when you get out
the bath and you're like
oh my god i'm the most thirsty i think
i've ever been that is how i feel right
now
so i'm gonna make myself a nice cold
drink
get out the wrapping paper get out some
of the presents that we've got to wrap
and wrap
so
[Music]
so
[Music]
updates and like you know stats and
things
in my vlogs because i feel like a lot of
you probably come here to avoid the c
word and by c word i do not mean
christmas i mean coronavirus
but there's just been an announcement
stating
that there is a new tier tier four which
is london and southeast and
boris has just said that instead of
three households
for the five days we're only allowed
three households for
only christmas day oh the family are
ringing
oh my gosh oh my god
did you get that did you get it i saw it
but i didn't i didn't get it
it's like the craziest store
out of nowhere can you hear the thunder
the hailstones what the hell
whoa
in the corner they've been building up
whoa
hello i don't even know if they're gonna
be able to hear how
loud how loud this is up there
look at the hailstones
i've honestly we've not had anything
like this in so
long there was like a crazy lightning
oh did it just do it again
it looked in my camera like it's just
raining but it's not exactly
oh my holy
nana's like what the hell i don't i
don't think she's experienced much
hailstones
was that that was just there
whoa oh my god that lightning is crazy
i was literally making narla's dinner
and that came
out of nowhere there's us thinking
narla's barking at the
thunder and lightning in hailstones
she's probably just like can i have my
dinner please
if any of you are watching this and
you're in a tier 4
i'm so sorry like that look just must
suck
um you're rather than tier four i know
so what could you do now i don't know i
think tier four
no one can see anyone i think you just
have to stay in your house in tier four
other than people that are fully solo
can still have a sport bubble
i think i think you can still have a
sport bottle or something and your
brother's got diana obviously
yeah whoa
scary times but for those of you that's
really affected i'm just sending you all
my love
and i mean there's nothing i can really
say to make it better but just know that
i'm thinking of you
and yeah i don't know i have no word
just know you're not alone there are so
many people that are yeah
feeling upset angry annoyed disappointed
let down however you're feeling
you're not the only one as like that one
day of the year that we all really look
forward to so i do think
for so many people right now who this is
really really affected
it's going to feel so
sad anyway i'm going to
carry on keeping on i'm going to try and
bring you some vlogmas
in the midst of this crazy
i want to say month but it's been a
crazy year i'm not gonna lie
i know i know these videos are not gonna
feel the same and everything's so
different this year but
i really hope that those of you that
like watching these videos are able to
take
some form of positivity away
from them um because that is why that is
why i'm uploading them that's why i
decided to do vlogmas this year
when i started this i knew vlogmas would
be a bit different but i didn't really
anticipate it would be
so different um especially in this last
kind of week where
usually everything kind of gets ramped
up a bit and we'll get a bit more
excited and see family and
friends and like that's just not going
to happen so
i feel like that storm was very symbolic
on a more positive night
this is strictly final tonight and i am
really excited to watch it i have no
idea who's gonna win i think it starts
in like 25 minutes actually and as i
said me and alpha gonna answer some
questions
do a little q and a care to join me for
a little oh that's very sticky what's
that honey from yesterday
oh look at us in grey what's my
hairstyle
vision in grey i look very pink
why do i look so pink let me see you in
real life
you're very pink i'm actually no you
look cute no but look in there how pink
i look
yeah you do look a bit pink i think it's
because you've got
full face of makeup again
zoe loves filming next to me with a full
face of makeup i mean i have for the
last eight years i don't know what
you're talking about maybe my skin's
just got worse
no it hasn't you look lovely what's that
i don't care what's up baby you
shouldn't really be on that blanket
you're not do they you've already ruined
you claimed it have you
no no you stay there no no no no no no
she jumped down
times like that i'm like she 100
knows everything we're saying that makes
me sad yeah
you could say as i said earlier alfie
and i are going to sit and do a little
christmas q a feel like i need to have a
little hot chocolate like a cup of tea
or something yeah
first question is rate the chocolate
boxes
we couldn't be more different on this
best to work worst
to best we couldn't have more opposing
views
yeah shall i go first or do you want to
go first no you go fast
okay so for me so let's go
least favorite to most favorite although
let's be honest i love them all
there's no there's none that i don't
like oh yeah i'll definitely eat all of
them
celebrations oh my gosh
then miniature heroes oh my gosh then
quality street then roses
and here's my reasoning celebration you
like to be wrong
no celebrations you can eat everything
in that all year round
there's nothing new in that that's how
good they are there's nothing different
there's nothing
they're so good they can sell them all
year round the same with heroes
i'm going on nostalgia and like
christmas
feels for me quality street and roses
just
are so much more christmassy because
those are the two that i always had
growing up
so but i do think i prefer
i prefer cadbury's chocolate over the
quality street chocolate which is why
roses for me is my top your go
roses bottom
okay quality straight second bottom
then these two are very close it depends
on my mood
but i'm going to say celebrations then
heroes
i feel like more people will agree with
you and the reason why is because
those chocolates are evidently so good
that they can sell them
anytime any year round i feel like
people in their 30s will agree with that
i know and everyone else will agree with
you
i know what you mean as in like um roses
and quality streets definitely are more
festive like we've literally got a box
there
uh tin they're definitely more festive
but actual eating
they're not as good taste-wise they're
just not as good
okay well will agree to this but no no
no no this is where we have to agree
it's amazing that we're the opposite
because it means that we don't eat
like if ours were exactly the same then
we'd all want the same ones yes
when we have tins here at christmas zoe
goes real hard on those two i got really
hard on the other two so it actually
genuinely works perfectly when you have
kids will you let them decorate the tree
um yeah
me and my brother used to decorate the
tree with my mom you're gonna be like my
mom was
and the problem is when you have little
kids they can only really decorate the
bottom half
so as a parent you can pick them up
things around my mum definitely moved
the decorations around when me and joe
helped decorate
my mum was the kind of mum where it's
like oh yeah come and help me out with
the baking
and then i'd like crack the egg in and
stir it and she'd be like that's perfect
and then take it in this dirt
that's going to be something that's
going to be very like a little okay
i think the cutest thing and i had this
growing up i don't know if you did
we so um nissa zoe knight poppy and i
used to buy
like a tiny tree like this kind of size
from the floor like that big
christmas tree and we'd have it in our
room we used to decorate those ourselves
so we had like a tiny tree ourselves
yeah in our bedroom we had a tiny tree
or sometimes sometimes just in the
kitchen like a tiny little dream we
would decorate that one
that's such a good idea because then you
don't then you don't have to be precious
about what that looks like yeah
yeah that's cute what do you typically
put in stockings
so when did we start doing this because
this was only two or three years ago
now i want to say about four years ago
we started doing stockings
and we we've always done stockings we've
started doing it in this way
have we i don't feel like i had a
stocking my mom and dad used to buy you
insurance talking and me
yeah you spoiled about stocking i can't
even remember that
yeah then one year we decided we would
all buy each other a stocking present
do you remember so like i would buy one
present for each person and we would put
them in the stockings
and we would open one of those stocking
presents on christmas eve it became like
a tradition
we would all sit round so everyone would
have six presents in their stocking
five presents sorry and they're stocking
and we would sit with our pajamas on
on christmas eve all like cozy with the
fire on and we would pick
one present that we were allowed to open
and then after the years this year and
it's making me sad
we decided to make it like a secret
santa stocking
which i prefer because then you just
focus on
one person so we draw names out of a hat
and every year we get a secret person
and we fill their stocking and what's
the lim price limit is it 30 or 50.
i can't remember we put a price too sure
actually i feel like i should know but
yeah so we then buy for that person but
nobody knows who
and then on christmas eve and we're all
wrapping the same so we all wrap it in
brown paper
the person that i've got this year i'll
wrap their presents
in brown paper and then everyone goes
out the room and i put it in a stocking
and everybody like
we basically we do it so we don't know
who's got who and then
somehow over the years we just now just
open all of the stocking presents on
christmas eve
just get too excited yeah so usually
what's in them
is just like any nice little thoughtful
gifts
for that person that we had but it's
just i think it just adds
another element of like fun it's not
necessary and then you're trying to work
out as well so like when i open mine
i'm like opening one present i'm like
trying to work out like that could have
been a poppy kind of present and then
open everyone i'm like oh i don't know
and then i'm like
i reckon poppy you got me this year i
reckon you bought me these
yeah because obviously the wrapping
paper is the same for everyone so the
most festive room in your house
probably these two rooms yeah i'd say
these two but also i do feel like once
the dining room is done that feels
really christmassy when the food's on
the table
yeah yeah and there's a tree in there
and the fireplace is done that always
feels very christmassy
christmas eve plans we don't know
anymore
we need to rethink those are we loud
outside in like mom and dad's gazebo
well i suppose the tier two
rules up to christmas day haven't
changed so we can still go in their
garden so we could get mom and dad to
decorate their gazebo in their garden
like
christmas christmas and then we could
eat christmas eve lunch in there
potentially we'll see what they say with
masks on and like
who's better at wrapping gifts oh
i'm gonna say you i think it's pretty
close i'm better at
fluffing gifts yeah you're i'm better at
like alfie's better
she will like give me an obscure shape
yeah that's me but then zoe can like
make it look great why have we never had
teams i should do
yeah i should do all the actual just
normal wrapping yeah and then you add
all like the little
extras on top because that's the bit i
like i don't enjoy
the actual wrapping of the presents yeah
i don't yeah
see that this is why we work so well
together when you like my ribbon of
course
have it grown on you have people
commented have you seen that i haven't
gone to check actually on that vlog
i wanna go and check the comments
favorite food on christmas
oh it's so hard because for me it's just
i'm gonna say trees the cheeseboard yeah
cheeseboard
the cheeseboard mine is just the
christmas dinner but
i couldn't pick one thing on the
christmas dinner because i like it all
together
like do you prefer giving or receiving
gifts giving
100 every time every i love
giving gifts especially when you've
really thought of something that you
think someone's gonna really love
when there's something under the tree
like we get a couple of presents
for each person but there'll always be
one that's like a bit more special yeah
i always want them to open that one last
do you ever notice because we saw you
trying to hide things i try and hide all
the good ones until the end and you know
that scene in gavin and stacy when it's
christmas and
um stacy is like okay well i'm going to
hand them round and i'm going to go
first if that's okay with everyone i'm
like why is that meal
my mum and dad come over and put and
probably in short and we put everyone's
out under the tree
and then zoe will be like
not that one yet no no not that one yet
that's literally sorry but alfie doesn't
care so he'll just be like yeah open
that one that's fine i'm like that's the
thing
i own it the main one classy or cozy
clothes on christmas day
only cozy i like only guys i say this
because
alfie and his family are always like
you don't dress up for christmas day
what are you talking about
we're just like matching pajamas all day
but i
only did that when i met alfie because
my whole life my mom has gotten
us so dressed up for christmas day like
joining a little waistcoat me and like a
little dress
but i do love that it's more cozy now i
think i will put a bit of makeup on this
year though
yeah yeah because i hate you straight
away first thing
yeah and that is the one thing with us
all being so like
just eating all day and like sleeping
and chilling
there isn't ever really any like nice
nice pictures but
for us they would never like go on the
wall in the house or anything do you
think when we have families
we'll still all be really chilled or do
you think we'll all dress up to go and
see each other
because actually do you think yeah like
all the kids would just be like in their
pjs all day yeah they'll be like
it's not just like boxers is it it's
like yeah sure
is that chris like we still all buy like
we will buy matching christmas pyjamas
so it's special
that i am gonna end this q a here but um
we're gonna watch the strictly final now
and i should say yes on now
and um i hope you enjoyed that little q
a
let me know some of the answers to the
questions or if you've got any more
questions because
i'm just going to throw it out there
we've got a lot of vlogs we've just
asked so if you've got any more
questions oh hello
we are in the car
it is nearly half 10
way past my bedtime but we were on
um face time with poppy sean and steven
alexia and everyone was feeling a little
bit glum because of the new
um the new christmas rules so we were
like
should we just we'll go for a little
beach walk so i don't know if poppy and
shaun are coming but we're going to meet
steven alexia
maybe grab a little hot drink from
somewhere and have a little stroll on
the beach to end this saturday
call us crazy a hot is it called a hot
toddy do you remember we used to get
that in scotland
doesn't it have whiskey in it yeah oh
get out get some fresh air hopefully
we'll sleep well
we'll just listen to a bit of harry
styles
cruising down to the beach probably
won't be too long
because you know this this granny needs
to get to bed
but i'm excited
we've stumbled upon a retro
santa in this little gallery
nice and festive what do you think bae
actually you like him she's like i just
want to go inside
yeah finished our little walk it's now
quarter past midnight that is wild we
actually stopped off
at a mcdonald's and i got a little
hot chocolate i actually think
a mcdonald's hot chocolate is really
really good
it's probably up there with one of my
favorite hot chocolates to buy from
anywhere
i don't know why i love it so much it
tastes like
a bowl of weetos like the cereal
milk warmed up and it's just so
good um but i think i'm gonna end this
vlog here because my battery's flashing
and we're on our way home
and i'm most likely gonna just be rolled
into bed
so i hope you enjoyed today and i'll see
you again tomorrow
say good night see you tomorrow bye
