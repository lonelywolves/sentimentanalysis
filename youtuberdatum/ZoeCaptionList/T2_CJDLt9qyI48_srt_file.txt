not an anal bead a bubble tea how you
feeling tired
yeah me too don't think it's so good
there's no muppets christmas carol does
anyone else's dog do this
my current nighttime skincare routine
[Music]
good morning what uh
24 hours what
the what the bead shop
yeah what for
what no oh my god
oh my god it's just
do you know what when i when i thought
i'm gonna do vlogmas 2020. i thought it
would be a bit different
i thought it would be a little less
festive
can't do what we normally do can't see
people we normally see
in the way that we normally see them
however i did not think
uh i would be spending days
um rushing my dog out the door
because she has explosive diarrhea
there's someone on our driveway i think
your mum's
here yes your dad
oh god nala's gonna get excited and [ __ ]
everywhere
hello
[Laughter]
anyway they must be dropping something
off
i did not think that that vlogmas would
take such a turn but you know what
that's life that's what all the people
say and this is just my life isn't it
if i'm gonna be vlogging when i can then
this is just what it's been yesterday
was a day of
literally feeding nala taking narla out
wiping nala down
giving her medication just on repeat
over
and over again i'm trying to sleep what
close your eyes oh my god what what mom
did mom and dad just watch put your
hands out your eyes closed
oh my god shut up is it is it turkey
twizzlers
giant fish fingers oh why do i think it
was turkey seriously
we were going to have a fish fingertips
i just said to them
oh my god they are huge
i just put these in the freezer say
thank you
that said it smells christmassy on my
driveway i said no it smells like [ __ ]
oh that was nice would you mind putting
them in the freezer out
what was i saying i knew vlogmas would
be a bit different this year but i
didn't realize
um that it would just be looking after a
poorly dog
so i'm sorry if this is not the vision
of vlogmas
you had but hopefully she starts feeling
a little bit better soon
went to the vets this morning and she
had her
second bandage removed so
she's now got a much looser bandage i
think more just like dressing and her
little foot is at the end now
she still needs to wear the boot outside
and obviously her stomach is
still not great in fact she shut in the
little car seat that i bought her
on the way home so that was that was
good
we'll see we'll see how today goes i
can't promise you it'll be the longest
vlog i can't promise you i'll end it
i'm gonna give it my best shot i'm still
in good spirits
i know that she'll feel better um she's
on chicken and rice
she's fine she's fine in herself um it's
just her stomach
is not fine at all so so yeah we need to
go back to the vets at some point
next week to get that bandage changed
um but her leg is healing really well
which is great
news and we're almost
halfway to christmas and that makes me
very excited
in the comments i want you to tell me
one
positive thing about your day today
something that made you smile something
that
turns the day around let's watch the
holiday
such a classic how are you feeling
she's got purple this time purple
with a little blue heart and there's her
foot
i forgot what that looked like
how are you feeling tired yeah me too
it's such a nice afternoon it's
literally perfect for going out
and having a little walk which is what i
said i wanted to do the other day but i
don't think i'm gonna be able to do that
so
also i half did my makeup before going
to the vets
so i put my brows on did some skincare
like the most basic um not skincare
um like foundation and then i just left
the rest so i look a bit odd i might put
some mascara and some lipstick on
um but i've come up because i
ordered these frames and i'm going to
put
my poppy dais prints into
the frames so i can put them up if you
haven't seen
poppy is selling some
hand oh i'm scared i'm gonna i'm i'm
scared i'm gonna rip them i'm gonna put
them in the frames but
she's selling two designs and they're
hand printed in brighton
and they are gorgeous
i love them this one's my favorite one
um but this one is
equally very cool they look great
together
right i'm going to put them in frames
and i can show you properly when i'm
done
[Music]
there we go so there's this one that
says come together
which every time i look at it i sing the
is it the beatles song
come together that one and then this one
that says
voila and this one's in like a dark navy
and a pink and then there's like this
really lovely cream they're also
signed oh three of 130
lovely thank you poppy
so if you are looking for a lovely nice
quality print or somebody you know might
like one for christmas then i will leave
a link below so you can go on over and
check them out
i think any orders after today or
tomorrow
as you're watching this won't get
shipped until the 7th of january so
make sure if you are interested you do
it now
because i don't want you to miss out
they're really lovely now i just have to
work out where i want to put them
do i put them on this wall above the bed
i chickened out
i was like i'm never going to be able to
get that straight i'm going to
absolutely ruin it
i don't have the time or patience or
brain power today
so i've popped them on the fireplace but
don't they look so
good so because of the time of year
we have a lot of packages and things
arriving
and they're all sort of being left
unopened because
they're either things that alfie's
ordered and said don't open it or things
i've ordered and sent alfie don't open
it however
i placed an order on amazon for a new
puzzle board
which i think i mentioned the other day
and i can only assume
that it's this ginormous box so
i'm just gonna take it into here and see
i mean i don't know what size puzzle
board i've ordered
i don't know why it would be in this but
we shall see
oh my god
it was my puzzle board
it's quite big but i think it's for a
thousand pieces
and this puzzle is a thousand pieces so
it makes sense i wanted something that i
could do a puzzle on and move it around
and zip it up and like
slide it under the sofa when i'm not
actually doing it
it's quite a nice one lovely little
christmas present for someone
if they're into puzzles
honestly this just makes me look like
such a puzzle noob
i could take my puzzles
to people's houses when we're allowed
can you imagine i haven't seen you for
like months and you haven't been around
my house for so long and you brought
your [ __ ] puzzle oh this is fancy
i feel like i'm back in um sixth form
doing a level art
that's what these folders remind me of
this is
lovely
wow okay so i assume
you do it on this and then you can just
place these on top
and then it sort of sticks on
lovely jubbly i better get cracking on
my christmas puzzle later then
i'm going to do a little tidy up of the
living room because it's really
bothering me that it just doesn't feel
fresh because i've been sat in here with
nala for like two days
and it just needs a bit of a spruce up
so that's what i'm gonna do now i flip
in love
a tidying and cleaning time-lapse so i
hope that this gives you the pep in your
step that you need to tidy that thing
that you've been putting off
so
[Music]
so nala is currently having one of her
chicken and rice meals
and i've just noticed that she's doing
this
does anyone else's dog do this
she's fishing out all the chicken and
spitting out all the rice
i see what you're doing she didn't do
this earlier
which may be a sign that she's not
feeling
as peaky because clearly she thinks she
can be fussy
that is a waste nola that's supposed to
make your tummy better
look she's spitting the rice out
anyway i'm gonna leave her to spit rice
everywhere
because that's gonna take her a while
and
look how much nicer the living room
looks
tada
oh just so much nicer
oh the holiday's finished
um still need to sort of tackle a bit of
down there
we need to put this chair somewhere this
chair was
where the christmas tree was but i think
we need to move it into the conservatory
but
it smells so fresh and look
when we popped into the shop earlier to
get nala some more chicken and rice
i picked up the radio times
i'm so excited for this i love
just sitting down and flicking through
and seeing what's on let's go to
christmas eve

i wish i could just use the search bar
to
find specific things even though i know
i can just pull it up on like amazon or
i think i've actually already downloaded
it but
it's just different when you watch it on
the tv i say this all the time
there's no muppets christmas carol i
mean there's
a lot of great things on though
oh cool i'm so excited for that
can't wait cannot wait does anybody else
like to sit and go through this
get the highlighters out cross cross
through what you want to watch
she's still bloody going
why we left that after nala's accident
in the car i
came down and did a huge washload
ah there we go right
blanket car seat
okay tumble dryer is on
hello you're not out down here
not with your leg our stair pile
is getting annoying so i'm gonna wow
look at the sun
it's such a nice evening so i'm gonna
clear this
and i feel like the motivation of it
being filmed is gonna make me finish
it rather than just do a little bit and
then leave the rest so i'm gonna
try and do this now
i just realized i've still got my hat on
i've literally had it on
all day is there just any better feeling
than when you feel like everything is in
its place and it just feels tidy
look
got bfg on the tv i love this film
nala's chilling by the fire
i am totally zen right now
i just have to try not to fall asleep
running myself a little bath now that
alfie's back he's on nala watch
and i thought it would be quite nice to
end today's video
by doing my current nighttime skincare
routine
i'm not gonna lie it doesn't change an
awful lot i have been enjoying
quite a few different products but
they're all quite similar in
what they do um and where in my routine
i use them
so i thought i would share with you
what i'm currently doing in an evening
or
i guess it very slightly if i've been
wearing makeup and i do have a little
bit on
also just realized i was gonna come up
here and put on more makeup today and
that just never happened
oh well but i do still have a little bit
on so
i like to do a good old double cleanse
and i'm gonna do a double cleanse before
i get in the bath
and then i think once i get out the bath
i will continue
with my skincare routine and then share
with you what it is that i'm using
the product that i've been using
recently to remove my makeup is this
it's the
glow recipe there we go
it's the glow recipe papaya sorbet
enzyme
cleansing balm and as you can see
i'm so nearly out
in fact i reckon once i've taken this
off
it's gonna be gone okay that'll do
got that much so i do i reckon i've
still got one more guys
and then i'll just pop that
over my dry face massage it on
i don't have mascara on today but it
does
remove mascara really well the mascara i
use actually
one of the reasons that i love it so
much is that when it gets
wet it comes off in like clumps if i've
ever
accidentally left it on at night oops
and i jump in the shower the next day
and i've forgotten
i've got it on and i'm like getting my
face completely wet and like rubbing my
eyes
i don't have like the streams of black
down my face
um it just sort of clumps up and then
you can just wipe it off it's really
like
no other mascara i've ever used in that
sense um
but i do love it but this cleanser gets
it off really well
okay now that i've
completely covered my facing cleanser
i'm gonna grab my flannel get it wet
and then wipe it off
one thing i do have to make sure with
this cleanser is that i take it off my
eyes properly
if i ever leave any around my eyes it
makes my eyes a bit watery
there we go right
step one done
step two i use my foreo
and i get it a bit wet and then i've
been using my oscar renaissance
cleansing gel
and i just do a couple of pumps on the
end of the foreo
my second cleanse i vary a lot so i'll
either use the oscar renaissance
i'll use the kate somerville
delicate soothing cleanser quite a lot
i also love the glossier
milky jelly cleanser
clay i feel like cleansers is one thing
that i do change up so
i will change up my makeup removing
cleanser and i'll change up my like skin
cleansing cleanser
quite often
depending on what i feel like my skin
needs whether i feel like it needs a
little bit more hydration
or whether my makeup is heavier than
other days i'll use something like a lot
more
hardcore okay so once i've got that a
bit wet
definitely just flip some somewhere i'm
just going to turn it on
and go for it
done then i'll give it a rinse
and splash my face and get this off
[Music]
that's step one and two done
i've picked quite possibly the worst day
to do this
because i am so tired
i look like maybe the lighting's not
doing me many favors
no i am just that tired so now i fully
cleansed my face
i feel that i can get in the bath and if
my face sweats a bit
i might like splash it and wash it again
when i get out but i will get back to
you
once i've had my bath out the bath
and i'm now gonna do the rest of my
skincare so
i think i'm gonna use
this toner this is the allies of skin
molecular molecular
savior probiotics repair mist i'm just
gonna pop that on a
cotton pad give it a little swipe over
there we go now i'm gonna use
my trusty
mandelic pigmentation corrector night
serum
this is also allies of skin two pumps of
that
it on i love this stuff
so good i don't know if you can see that
but it always leaves like
quite a glow to the skin i'm gonna pop
an eye cream on
this is the oh this is the only
henriksen banana bright eye cream
just put a little bit under here my
skin's a little bit drier than normal at
the moment so
trying to remember
to keep it moisturized under the old
eyes
okay
now i'm going to use this this is psa's
midnight courage oil it has
rose hip and bakuchi
bakuti or retinol just a couple of drops
of that
and that is all i'm gonna do in terms of
skincare
tonight might also put my charlotte
tilbury lip oil on because my lips are
also
very dry at the moment um but
besides that i'm done i am
fresh and ready for bed um i think i'm
gonna go down
and finish watching strictly and
i think then i'm gonna get an early
night because i've been up since
4 50 and i haven't shut my eyes at all
today
when i was in the bath i was like oh my
god i could just sleep in here
um so i really hope you've enjoyed today
a bit of a slow
casual day but
i still feel like i got a lot done still
had a great day
and i hope you enjoyed watching
good night
