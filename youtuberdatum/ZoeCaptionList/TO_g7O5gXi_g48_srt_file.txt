I'm nervous yeah here they are I'm
obsessed oh my god oh my god
[Music]
morning everybody we're getting ready to
leave we've packed up our bags I've
decided to like do half make up so I did
my brows put a little lip oil on did my
face but no mascara what did you say
definitely got my laptop definitely got
everything coat too hot for that right
now
it was just saying I look so different
without mascara on I just didn't think
there would be any point putting mascara
on and then getting on an aeroplane
because that is just asking for like
black ice
yeah I just you know we have that
feeling of like have I forgotten
something I mean we're going to New York
yeah exactly if I forgot I'm saying
never mind
yeah I don't have them you've got them
[Music]
we're here with an excessive amount of
luggage we decided instead of trying to
jam all our like massive coats and like
big shoes into our normal luggage we
would take a suitcase fill up half and
then bring half Christmas presents
packing it so that's what we're doing
although technically we do have space or
allowance for two checked in bags so
we're not doing too bad with an extra
one to eat yeah so I mean so should we
just wait here for them just waiting for
Zack and lofty
oh that let's just clean up now it's a
day isn't it if you quiet
yeah
never there isn't what you expected to
be like when you're younger you live
only when a holiday during the summer
holidays because that's how anyone like
a dog it's busy busy and we were gonna
fly I bet you this kid I bet this is
half of my trouble with travel used to
travel and it was always a very big deal
like it was like a holiday to Portugal
and it was like every two years and it
was a big deal like I think that's
probably what plays into the anxiety
around travel but specifically flying
we're in the same house yesterday the
tracks because it's so comfy but if the
dad caught the famous with my thumb in
the mirror wearing it it doesn't look
awful it's just looks like you got a big
loose nappy on it's just maybe he's
meant to be high weights to it or more
highways to it when you're back I think
it's just pure comfort doesn't matter
here they are yes speed up oh my god
tell me about this let me see that
basket it's like you fought of weeks
food shop for the plane I need to know
one isn't loose
we were kid
it allows me the IPTV account before we
take off
because this plane is definitely not
that Wi-Fi that's not life feeding
baby chill
surprisingly Joe
and a magical life yeah we're here we're
not making our way in a taxi to the
hotel
we have arrived our hotel we're staying
in Brooklyn we're staying in Brooklyn
which I'm really excited about because
we came here a little bit last time we
were here just for one day like walking
around yeah I know you got the tiles and
look at come on focus
but we didn't actually get to explore
much of it so I'm excited to be here for
the first part of our trip lovely bed I
cannot tell you how excited I am to get
into that and look at this view so you
can come out on a balcony a little bit
of grass yeah
look at that
so that's Manhattan over there
[Music]
pretty sure that is the Empire State
Building
is that the Rockefeller I'm not sure I'm
not very good I'm not so clued up home
it's currently like 3 a.m. so I think
it's actually quite a good thing that I
had a bit of sleep on the flight because
otherwise I would be so would like hang
in right now but I think I've got a
little bit of energy left in me
to explore the hotel or maybe go down
for a drink I really like some food
preferably some pizza I think but I've
also got father's find that this would
make such a cute picture
yeah so without exploring it's like
minus one it's very cold and we've
stumbled across one of these which you
always see in Christmas films
I'm obsessed oh my god it smells amazing
they smell more Christmasy yes perfect
they must likewise they smell so much
better than our Christmas trees I'm not
gonna lie
we found the play I am so good
thoroughly enjoying looking at all the
festive houses oh my god is in every
window my lover what were given this one
out of ten yeah I was gonna say a seven
yeah I feel like we're gonna see some
impressive ones this week so we need to
keep it realistic for house number one
7.5 from Lottie what's this
I thought it was a tiny swing I thought
it was like a little tiny swing no it's
just one of these oh we've lost them
oh I wonder how long it would take
before they get worried intercept with
us and give a knocking locks and
not notice I've got behind here on that
is Michael turnaround is if he needs me
I can lean on
Hey actually well mutters I've eaten the
pizzas on oh is this what's this
no I don't think so oh yeah this might
be oh my god everywhere is just so fast
eV

absolutely crazy getting to of it oh my
god oh my god what's your verdict
Phillip are a little pasta sauce or for
the artichoke pizza what you saying

known for makes sense
