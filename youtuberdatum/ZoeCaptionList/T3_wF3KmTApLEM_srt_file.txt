hello everybody long time no
chat i said in the last video uploaded
which was there we're having a baby
video
sorry i'm so out of breath i just ran up
the stairs i was like yeah i'm starting
to get a bit better and
now i can just vlog and i don't have
this big secret anymore
but i still just if i'm honest i still
just felt like
over the last couple of days touchwood
i have felt my energy creeping back
i've not felt as sick and i mean i've
done my makeup
this is probably the fourth time in the
last three months that i've actually put
makeup on and my hair is like freshly
washed
i'm feeling fresh and um i really wanted
to
vlog and have a little bit more of a
kind of catch up i suppose
because obviously the last video there
was like a purpose for that video but i
didn't i don't feel like i got to like
sit down and have a little catch up with
you all and
it wasn't like your typical vlog
so that's what this is gonna be it's
sunday at the moment
alfie has gone on a walk with his mum
it's actually a really lovely sunny day
it feels
really spring-like and i actually just
walked in the conservatory i was looking
for my camera and i was like oh my god
it's
hot in here like it's warm i actually
don't know what the temperature is
oh it's 12 degrees so yeah
lovely day i actually might have to go
out and sit in the garden
and really make the most of it uh the
other day actually when i took nala out
in the morning
i just sat outside on the step
and i just shut my eyes and i just was
like soaking in the sun i was like i
need some vitamin d on this skin
just took 10 minutes out put my phone
down
shut my eyes soaked in the sun it was
lovely oh you have to excuse
the like mess this
room has sort of turned into a bit of a
dumping ground
um this is a little charity pile i have
these are books i need to put away
those are things i need to put away
basically done that thing where i've
just created
lots of piles of things that i need to
sort out and put away over the last
three months
and because i haven't really had any
energy
i've not done any of it so it's just
still there
first things first i'm gonna do my hair
i don't know whether to
leave it straight or to curl it i think
curling it might be quite nice because
i don't know i always just feel like it
looks
like i've made a little bit more effort
i don't know whether i'm going to curl
it as precisely as i normally do though
i might just do a very like take
quite big sections and just
see how much i can do right let's
let's sort that out i tell you what
april 12th can't come
quick enough if i'm honest my eyebrows
are
wild i have been so well restrained
i had so many moments over the last
three months where i
almost took my tweezers to
my eyebrows and i've not used tweezers
on my eyebrows
in years because i get them threaded
and i love having them threaded i love
the
how long it lasts i love how precise and
sharp they look and like threading day
is a day i really look forward to
so i was like i don't really want to
have to tweeze them
um i've hated how they've looked but
thankfully not many people have really
seen me over the last three months so
i thought i'll wait and then the
satisfaction of having them threaded
will be like times 100 when we can
eventually go
just going to use my ghd glide
i blow dried my hair yesterday and then
i just left it
but i like to do this so it's sleek
and smooth before i curl it when i've
done that
so how is everybody how
have you found lockdown
i have definitely found lockdown
number three which was the january to
now lockdown still in it
the hardest and i wouldn't even say that
that's because
i was in my first trimester through that
i actually think it's probably a good
thing that we were in lockdown through
my first trimester because i did not
feel great
i find this time of year so hard anyway
and i always really struggle with sad
which is like seasonal affective
disorder once
christmas has gone i just feel a bit
bleak
and what is there now to look forward to
and
i don't know i just feel that way every
year and i know i've mentioned it before
and quite a lot of you
have said you feel the same it's just
the time of year that isn't my favorite
ever um and so that mixed with
a lockdown i found to be quite
a uh intense
combination having that um
slight freedom through the summer like
when we could start meeting people
outside and then eventually
oh you have to excuse i do so many
little turtle burps now
i just can't help it you know getting to
meet people outside and then having
people
inside and everything was kind of easing
back and it was like okay let's
see how we go are we going back to kind
of normal life
and um and then to have that like
all taken away again i was really
enjoying
people's company and that's honestly
that the one thing
that i have really really
missed so much is just having
a couple of friends around in the
evening for a takeaway having mark just
come and stay around like there's
nothing really that
wild that i feel like i really want to
do at the moment
but just to have people inside making a
nice
dinner and like having friends around
going for a walk and then being
them being able to come inside and like
have a cup of tea
things like that i just i've really
really
missed that human interaction and
um especially because i haven't really
been
going outside much because i haven't
felt great i've not had much energy at
all so i've not really wanted to go on
very many walks so i've not really seen
anyone
at all for like three months
um so thank god uh for alfie
i thank god i actually have like him
around to speak to
but what have you been doing to kind of
pass the time i suppose
i feel like lockdown one was like
you know it was the lockdown of
productivity
and everybody was really kind of diving
in headfirst with the whole like
i'm gonna make the most of this and
baking banana breads
and finding new hobbies and crafts and
doing lots of really exciting things and
i just feel like
locked down two was a bit like oh
okay that you know it is what it is this
could be the last one let's just get
through this month
and lock down three it was like nah
i've got nothing left in me there is no
motivation here
that that's my thoughts anyway i also
want to say
i'm doing this without mirror i'm
literally just
looking in the viewfinder of the camera
um i also just want to say thank you
so much for all the love
and support and amazing comments
um on my last video and on alfie's
videos and on
instagram i
was so overwhelmed by the response
like the video i uploaded on instagram
has like
32.6 million views or something
like i was not expecting that at all
it just i don't know it makes my heart
really happy that so many of you are so
excited
so yeah i just wanted to say thank you
i guess also another thing that i just
wanted to quickly
touch on before my uh
content carries on is oh hello nala
um i
am super excited obviously to be sharing
different aspects of my pregnancy
journey and having a baby and my entire
life is now gonna change
um and i'm doing this for the first time
and
i'm excited but i'm also i'm thrilled
that i have this space that i can
share um my experiences
and i can ask you guys for advice and
it's a really new and exciting thing for
me and something that i'm obviously
going to be
touching on just quite naturally
in probably most videos because
obviously i filmed my life and this is
now going to be a really
large part of my life i'm obviously
still going to film other things but
i can imagine it's going to be very rare
for me to
you know post an entire 30 to 50 minute
vlog with no mention of it at all
and i know that a lot of you are super
excited
about that and also just understand that
you know
my content is lifestyle focused and this
is
my life and it would be very hard for me
to exclude that from it and i don't want
to because
i'm excited but i'm also aware of
anyone who you know is a follower or a
subscriber or is
on my instagram who might be going
through
their own struggles with trying to
conceive
or they're on their own um fertility
journeys or they're struggling with
infertility
um especially as there are so many of
you here
i i'm just very aware of that and i just
i feel very sensitive towards that and
i just wanted to be able to say if that
is you and
you need to not watch me or
you need to mute my instagram or i just
i think i just want to say like
please go ahead please don't feel
bad if you can't stay around
or there's things that you know won't
help you
um i think it's really important for
anyone that is struggling
and um i know this from us doing
articles on zoella about some of these
subjects
that things like this can be very
triggering and it's
healthy to set boundaries and it's
important that you put yourself first
and
that nothing is you know
making that harder for you and i just
wanted to extend that to
any of you that might be watching this
or you know someone or
i don't know i just i didn't want to
kind of carry on
without addressing that because i know
there are
oh god i'm gonna bloody burn myself i
know there are
thousands of women who
are all on their own journeys
experiencing
things at different times and i i would
just hate
for somebody to click on my
videos and think like this isn't helping
me
i don't really know what to do here i
just i want you to know i'm thinking of
you
and i totally understand if my content
is
not for you right now so yeah i just
wanted to say that i'm
really curling my hair
badly i think as much as i'm excited to
get my brows then i'm also very excited
to have sam do my hair
i'm going to get my extensions put back
in which
i'm excited about i've had a long time
to think about whether i want them in or
in again or not and
i want them back in for summer i know
one thing that i was gonna
um ask you all
not that i'm really thinking about
travel just yet because it does scare me
slightly
but once covid
allows for people to be traveling again
safely
where is the first place
you would want to go i actually don't
know
where i would want to go i think i would
want to go to greece you know
it's been a while since we've been to
mykonos
and it's one of my favorite places
i love greece but also
i've really craved wandering the streets
of new york
in this lockdown like i keep looking
back at old videos and
old photos of new york and i'm just like
i really
i miss that and that is something i
never thought i would say before
visiting new york i thought i was going
to find it
very overwhelming but i actually really
love it i am
going to do a video on
how is this a straight bit of hair yeah
how i felt in my first trimester by the
way this probably isn't going to be the
one because i feel like it
is it needs like a whole video for
itself
um and this is going to be more of a
just a vlog
catch up but uh
if you do have any questions that you
want me to specifically answer on
the first trimester then
leave them in the comments below and
then i will probably film that as my
next video
one thing to note however look how much
darker my hair is i feel like the blonde
is um
am i done oh my god every bit of hair i
don't know
one thing to note
is i am still writing my book and my
deadline is about
three weeks away and i have a lot still
to do
because i have found writing
almost impossible um and it's it's
been one of the hardest
projects because my brain
apart from obviously not feeling great
which
has meant that i've struggled much more
um my brain just is not
engaging with anything that requires too
much brain power and so
even when i get like three hours of
energy and i'm like oh i'm feeling okay
like let's grab my laptop and and
you know sit down and write for a bit
i'll open up my word document
and i'm just watching the cursor
blinking and i'm like
my brain is is empty so that has been
a real challenge thank god we have more
editing stages in the process before the
book gets to you by the end of the year
because
at the moment even stringing a sentence
together
i'm finding difficult it's so bizarre
and i can i'll talk about this way more
in like my first trimester video
but i remember lily pebbles saying
in her video that
she felt like her personality had been
zapped
and that she was just so just like
lackluster and there was just nothing
going on
like inside her head and that is exactly
how i felt i felt like the lights were
on
and there was no one home for like three
months and it's only really oh i can see
is that alfie if that's alfie he's
walking
very fast now and i only really feel
like
it's the last like
week or so where i'm like oh
oh i feel like my brain is engaging
slightly more but that has meant that
i found writing the book harder which
means i've got more now to write in the
next three weeks
so although i'm starting to feel a
little better i am going to be putting
all of that energy into finishing
the magpie society two for joy because
that is i mean that has to be
my top priority um because that has to
get done
so that is going to be an interesting
three weeks
and um i'm really really looking forward
to that being finished just checking
that my hair is actually curled
i think it is lovely another thing that
i am
super excited to share with you today is
a brand that i'm working with
and i have been already using and loving
this brand for about
four or five months and they are very
excitingly
doing a giveaway on this video so if
after i've chatted about them
you're like yes want to try them out
which i can almost guarantee you will
um then you also have a chance to
win something from the brand and some of
the products which is
very exciting so stick around for that a
lot of you might already know
when it comes to skincare i am
a huge fan of
allies of skin these are just a handful
of some of the products i use from
allies of skin
two being my favorite that i actually
talk a lot about
is the mandelic pigmentation corrector
night serum
and the promise keeper blemish facial
both of these are staples in my skincare
routine
and i was super excited when they
said to me we are launching
a sister brand to allies of skin
something that is a little more
affordable for people who
possibly don't have the budget for
allies of skin skin care
and also products that are free from
sulfates silicones
mineral oil and any kind of artificial
fragrances as well which i know
for a lot of you are things that you are
looking for particularly in your
skincare
i don't know whether it's looking like
my nose is kind of like glowing
maybe i should move like i'll move to
here there we go
so i'm actually so thrilled that allies
of skin decided to create this sister
brand the sister brand is called
psa this is one of the products which
stands for purposeful
skincare by allies i know that a lot of
you when i'm talking about allies of
skin are like i love that product thank
you for promoting that product or for
sharing that with me i've been using it
and loving it
but i also know that it's not an
accessible price point and psa
is an accessible price point so i just
feel like for a lot of you that watch my
videos
or you see the skincare that i'm
recommending
um i just know that this will be so
up your street because immediately
like i i just i love everything in their
range
and i'm just really excited to share it
with you they currently have nine
products in the range some of which
are much newer so i've not used these
for as long but
i'm still just excited i really love a
first the packaging i do have all the
products in front of me
but it's hard to show them all at the
same time the packaging
is beautiful i love the ombre
i also love and it's the same with
allies that
they share all the key ingredients
on the products and on the boxes i
actually kept some of the boxes so that
i could show you
um so much like allies i don't know if
you can see that there's so
much useful information on the box which
is why i kept them because
i like referring back to these obviously
i don't need to keep them now i've shown
you them but
they have the key ingredients they have
its purpose
how to use and um basically
everything you need to know one other
thing i really like about the products
is that each product
tells you which step in the skincare
routine to use the item
and i know that for a lot of people
myself
included i love knowing
where a new product comes into my
routine
especially if you are someone who likes
to do a double cleanse a serum an eye
cream a moisturizer a treatment
and there are many different kind of
layers to your skincare routine
um psa makes that so easy
to do because they tell you exactly
where in your skincare routine
to use each product they've not asked me
to talk through each product they've
just asked me to share some of my
favorites but
i do feel like if i was watching this
video i would want to know like what's
available because
something i love might not be something
you would use for your skin
so i am going to very quickly run
through each product
and give a tiny brief description of
what it does and then
i guess it's up to you to decide if
that's something that you want to
purchase or something that you think
would work really well for your skin
so step one is obviously a cleanser this
is reset
it's a nourishing cleanser you can use
it both day and night
i use this as my second cleanse you can
also use this to remove your makeup
but um i i just think it's too nice i
use it as my double as my second cleanse
main ingredients in this are acai and
pomegranate extract
and also manuka honey so it's a really
nice
gentle cleanser and i love it we have
three products here that you can use as
the second step to your skincare routine
so if you wanted to do a face mask after
you've cleansed
um then you could use this this is light
up
it's a vitamin c and e flash
brightening mask so this is really nice
when you just feel a little bit like
your skin is looking
a bit lackluster and a bit dull i
love this i genuinely put this on and
feel like my skin looks so much better
after i've used it asorbic acid
11 vitamin e grape seed oil and
hyaluronic acid
so it reduces dullness um promotes
radiance and replenishes
moisture so that is lovely if you love a
good
face mask this is one of their newer
products so i've not used this that much
but this
is called follow the light and this is
a radiance peel so after cleansing apply
on face and neck
and hang out for 20 minutes this has
10.5
glycolic and lactic acid bha
ethylated l-absorbic acid pomegranate
enzymes things i can't pronounce
and vitamin e complex there's a lot
packed into this
i have only used this a handful of times
but i already
love this if you're not doing a face
mask or a peel and you want to move
straight on maybe it's like i don't know
you're getting ready in the morning
then you could use this this is heroin
this is their toner
i love this this is great this is
actually my second bottle of this
now uh some of the key ingredients in
this are mandelic and lactic acid i
don't know why but i just
feel like my skin reacts really well to
mandelic
acid so anything with mandelican i'm
instantly drawn towards that's what is
in
one of my favorite allies of skin
products and that's also in this toner
pomegranate extract
licorice root kombucha but yeah i really
really love that toner it's
lovely next up you've got your step
three products so these are serums or
treatments
these are new so i've not used these
much yet but there is already one that i
love and has made its way
into my everyday routine without fail
and that is the liquid clarity
this is a blemish recovery booster
and one of the things that i
found through my first trimester is that
my skin
went awol i just had so many hormonal
breakouts
and although i'm not having as many
spots like fresh spots now
um my skin is prone to leave
quite a lot of um pigmentation
just redness after a spot has been there
and it takes a really long time for that
to go away so although i don't have any
active spots on my face
my face isn't clear and i still look
just as spotty because i have the marks
left over
so if any of you are watching this and
you have skin
similar to mine that um just
really holds on to that onto that
pigmentation
i think you'll really like this two
percent bha one percent mercutio
two percent zinc pca willow bark extract
black
cumin oil balances and soothes the skin
brightens complex reduces the appearance
of imperfections
yes yes yes this is
working wonders already on my skin this
one is called
liquid panacea i think is how you
pronounce it again this is like a
treatment so this would go
in after your toner can be used on its
own or mixed with any essence of serums
creams
or oils for a firming antioxidant boost
same with this one you can add this to
other things as well if you want to or
you can use it on its own
this one promotes the appearance of
firmer skin soothes skin and provides
antioxidants these
are both serums one is for the daytime
and one is for the night time so the
daytime serum is called the most
and this is a hyaluronic super nutrient
so
let me see if i've got the box for that
one yes i have hyaluronic acid complex
panthenol
sodium pca kombucha and acai berry
hydrates and plumps the skin suits dry
skin and replenishes moisture so if you
are somebody that struggles
with dehydrated or dry skin that is a
great
serum for you the nighttime one
um is multi acids and probiotics this is
called
goals and in this you've got 12
glycolic lactic um pyruvic
i don't think i'm saying that right vha
and pha probiotics niacinamide
niacinamide is also one of my favorite
ingredients
my skin needs a bit of niacinamide um
and reacts very well to niacinamide so
this is a really really lovely nighttime
serum that i find when i put it on i do
actually have noticeable difference the
next day refines pores reduces breakouts
and blackheads
and lightens dark spots and blemish
marks and then
uh they have an oil as well so this is
number four in the um steps
so you use this at night this is a night
oil and this is called midnight courage
this has
rose hip and bakuchi boccuccio
i don't i hope i'm saying that right
retinol so this is
a little stronger i actually have been
advised not to use this
through pregnancy so although i was
using it and enjoying it beforehand
i'm now not able to use this but this
is lovely i loved this
i'm not a huge lover of oils in general
i probably should use oils because i'm
definitely at that age now where my skin
is probably crying out for an oil let's
be honest but
i tend to like something that i don't
feel is sitting on my skin as much but i
never felt like this with this oil it
was absorbed
really well and i
yeah i loved it i'm a bit sad i can't
use it anymore but
there we go reduces all signs of
premature aging
firms the skin and reduces imperfections
if you are after
a retinol um or
something that is not too harsh i didn't
find
this left my skin red or dry
it was like the perfect amount for me
and
i'm excited to for when i can use that
again so a couple of my favorites
um i'm gonna say these i would say
are ones that i reach for the most um
and incorporate into my skincare routine
so that's the heroine
toner the liquid clarity
and the goals nighttime serum and
the light up face mask so if that has
piqued your interest or you are looking
for some new products to add to your
skincare routine or you've been really
wanted to try allies of skin
but it wasn't within your price range
and you feel that this actually might be
something that is
i would highly highly recommend it it's
available on asos
which is great um and i also think it is
available
through liberty london and look
fantastic as well
can purchase the products directly
worldwide
and i actually have a code which means
you can get 20
off if you sign up to the website so if
you use
discount code zoe 20
um on the psa website then you will
receive
20 off but you do have to create an
account just to bear that in mind
oh also worth bearing in mind that the
20 off
works for your first three orders so
if you go on there and you want to
purchase something and then you're like
oh i think i might purchase something
else
it works for your first three orders

a bit more difficult than usual so i've
been like loving

very like spring vibes and i like the
cut
of them um these are from zara

little spring outfit i feel like i just
sprained my wrist but i'm not really
sure how i think it was when i was
getting up
i've done something to my wrist it
really hurts
i have been obsessed with these these
are for children they're the innocent
smoothies but
um i'm trying to eat a lot more like
fruit and veg
um and one of these is
one of your five a day probably for a
child not an adult but still
i just
i'm obsessed with them healthier than a
chocolate bar
right so i've
baked a ciabatta just to crisp it up a
bit
slice that there we go
for a snack always something that's
healthier than chocolate bar
well do you know anything well i could
suggest a little innocent smoothie

leftovers because you can just leave it
cold

a little bit of pizza sauce
ow what are you doing stuff like this
reminds me of um
in your school did you ever have yeah i
know exactly
at break time or lunch time the little
um like baguette pizzas
i don't know what your dinners are like
i feel like you were a lunchbox kid i
was
there's no way you were schooled in a
kid no sometimes i went for a school
dinner if i felt like it
but i was mostly a lunchbox kid because
i'm a fussy eater
i don't know what school dinners are
like these days but oh
it was unhealthy when i was at school
at break time me and my friends
no joke would have um they did these
like
burger bap round pizzas did you have
those
it was like half a burger bap and you
would get it on a little square piece of
napkin
no but they made a pizza on them on a
burger no i think i just had square
pizzas
and my friend would always get a
cheeseburger other cheap the burgers
were like
so like cheap and like cheeseburgers
were so
good yeah they were so good like every
break time we ate pizza and burgers
that was break time that was like the
20-minute break that wasn't even lunch
wait are you talking college or school
you're talking to school secondary
school
yeah not primary school secondary school
yeah like
every day that's what we ate and i would
order two sometimes i actually dream
that i'm in the queue waiting to order
one also i made friends with the dinner
ladies
so then whenever there was like seconds
or extras they would just absolutely
sort me out
so i'd like very frequently
get like three extra desserts 10 minutes
before the end of lunch
oh yeah but then in your last lesson did
you not just feel like so
full no i just loved it i don't know how
i didn't put on
a lot of weight because i did that so
often
[Music]
right some mozzarella slices
[Music]
are you just back vlogging now yeah
you're doing hashtag mum this
vlogging every day until you're a mum no
soon to be mums
bit of this bit braided not that it
makes any difference to let you know
next delivery arrived with the little
vests i did it
yeah i'll go and get it once these are
in the oven so how can i
ordered
some more baby clothes have you looked
at them yet no
oh man they're both the same
um we just got some basics from next
just some plain white
these newborn size weren't they i think
so
because some of the ones we're ordering
are like zero to three months and
they're a lot bigger than what you think
oh my gosh
they're tiny they're so small
oh my gosh
i basically had to message my mom and be
like
mom how do you dress a newborn baby like
what do they wear
because they need a lot of layers and
then maddie told me
today actually she said look you're
advised for your baby oh my god
for your baby to be wearing one more
layer than you are
so if you're wearing a t-shirt and a
jumper and a coat your baby needs like
one more than that
so i bought lots of little vests to go
under
things loads of these
they came in a pack of tents
and someone else told me i don't
remember who it was um
that you wash a lot of these
and they get quite stained because if
they have a poo
explosion this is the first thing it um
goes on because it's the best
so i mean we're stocked up on those now
for newborns guys anyway we don't need
any more of those
oh and then just because it's in front
of me also loads of things
[Music]
might be worth being aware if anyone
watching this is
about to drive a baby or has just got
pregnant
we're finding that so many things that
we look at online
are sold out like everything to do with
newborns and newborn sizes
yeah it's not quite hard to find newborn
so like the actual size newborn is very
hard to find
this was m s these are organic cotton
tiny little hats just got two of those
in a little pack
just a little three packs i love these
[Music]
camo
dinosaurs because i i just don't think
only boys need to wear like dinosaurs
like that is so cute i love the colors
i love the fact they've got dinosaurs on
it i think this is slightly bigger size
and then this little brown one with the
cute pattern on it
from next as well and then this was
m s this is not three
this was a size that a lot of people
told me
get more of this size don't get too much
newborn
get more naught to three so this was
from
m f a zip one two which was also
a lot of people told me a zip would be a
life saver
and then we got this
because
look at it that is
this that's my favorite so we got this
because
we live in the countryside this is a
little countryside walks
my this is three to six months nala has
a raincoat
that is a duck if i can find it yeah i
think it's in that
and we just thought how cute would it be
for her to be matching with nala
yeah yeah here we go look at this
this is so sad it's so fun
i mean that's normal you can all take
the piss now but you're gonna want to
see that when it happens
let's be real um
i kind of want one for me i'm not gonna
lie
it's so cute imagine if we all had one
that's not cool that's probably good i
have to get some like
little actually she won't be walking i
was gonna take some wellies
she ain't gonna be walking um so that's
yeah that's just a little bit of
shopping that's in our kitchen
yeah i really want to buy like a really
cool carrier yeah
okay pizza's done do you think they look
nice
yeah that's very really good also
because the bread will taste so good
yeah it's nice and crispy
delish bon appetit hello good morning
it's now monday
so today i have got
a flu jab um which i was advised to get
by the doctors because i'm pregnant
that's a cute little
track tractor oh my god that's so
cute and i couldn't even tell you the
last time i had a
injection or a vaccine i was probably
i don't know like 16 in school i think
because was the last one i had i feel
like you have so many as a kid
i'm heading for a flu jab which
i'm really nervous about i basically
just have medical
anxiety i don't like sitting in waiting
rooms i don't like dentists
i don't like doctor surgeries i don't
like hospitals
so i have a lot of anxiety around that
stuff i always have
and so it's not that i'm even really
that scared about the injection
because i do remember the last time i
had an injection i didn't even feel it i
was like oh are you done
but i think it's just the whole
the whole thing um before i was pregnant
you might be surprised to know i had
reached the grand old age of 30 and
never had a blood test i'd never needed
one
like i was never in a situation where i
was like you need to do a blood test
which is obviously extremely lucky
it did mean that the anxiety around a
blood test
was very high um so that was fun i've
actually done two now
haven't i i'm on a property i think you
went into the deep end
they threw me in at the deep end with
the old blood tests i'll tell you that
you had i filled vials and vials and
so yeah it's not that i have a fear of
needles it's not that i'm scared it's
gonna hurt i don't know what it is
with a blood test it was the idea of the
blood test it was like that made me
squeamish
veins and things actually does make me
squeamish but an injection
that's not the same like i don't know
why i'm scared
come on sonny put yourself together
you're 31 next week
i'll get back to you when i come out and
i'm sure i'll be absolutely fine but i
am just really nervous
but also i feel like a lot of people
watching this are going to be like girl
by the end of your pregnancy you are
just a pincushion
and you're going to be you know
you're gonna be a much better with that
old fear of
medical scenarios and i i'm sure you're
right
but this is still very new for me okay
i'm here
we're a bit are we early now i should
probably go in shouldn't i uh it's
better you'd rather wait in the car or
wait here
it might just be like oh let's just roll
in are you coming in
you probably aren't loud then yeah i
want to come in
i'm going to film it for your
can you imagine oh do you not think i'm
allowed in i don't know
it's not necessary i suppose you coming
in with me is not
like oh shall i not go in there i don't
know i don't i don't mind if you wait
here
oh i don't mind whatever you prefer
whatever i'm allowed to do
i just feel like there's less people in
there the better probably yeah very true
i'll wait here
okay oh now i need a wii
i hope there's people watching this that
are like i know exactly how you feel
right now
like i know that feeling like my stomach
is like
flipped like doing somersaults i bet
people are like how does she think she's
gonna push a baby out if she can't even
have an injection
trust me i'm gonna find that hard too
do you know what that is literally
laughable
what do you mean i honestly think that
took 30 seconds from me walking in the
room and walking out
that's exactly what remember when i said
to you that you're just for a small
scratch and i was like
oh it's just the build up yeah it
honestly oh i take this off oh it is
already hurting though i'm not gonna lie
what stinging from where it was yeah
honestly what the hell why do i get
myself
so worked up over those things yeah it's
just that post
uh anxiety giggle like when you've done
something and you're like oh
why did i why did i make that out to be
so much worse than it actually was
flu jab done yeah now me now if you're
gonna grab some lunch
back home my arm is definitely like i
can only lift it to there
oh feeling it
but i'm actually feeling okay in myself
today so that's good
it's a really loud noise outside
and i'm not sure where it's coming from
no idea bizarre

some malware i've got some tang fast
sticks and i also got the marwan mix

beautiful day
