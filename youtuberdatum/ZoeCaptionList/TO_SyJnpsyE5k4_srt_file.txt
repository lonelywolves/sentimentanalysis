[Music]
doing a little stroll New York although
it is raining so you know not as cute as
yesterday
oh wow so much biomass we're taking a
little trip out to go and see the Macy's
store because I don't know I've ever
been there and I think it's gonna be
quite Christmasy but secret mission
[Laughter]
[Music]
there's so many dogs we're going
straight still oh my god Raleigh was
I feel like New York's too busy for
everyone to have an umbrella yeah yeah I
just duck a little bit I mean yeah I'll
feast on the secret mission to get
something free for Christmas so the
three of us are doing a little Macy's
oh my god I even travel all the beeping
we're here and apparently is the world's
largest store which I did not know
[Music]
[Music]
Wow it's very magical inside okay where
should we head yes why so our Macy's
journey brought us to the bedding
section because the bedding we currently
have where we're staying is the softest
bedding I've ever ever ever slept in and
it said that they would have it Macy's
and I don't think they do
is from our brand food I enjoy I pulled
all their bedding off this morning and
looked at the label which is going to
hold what it was but I'm just gonna have
to look for it back time because we
can't find it here so should we try to
look for the Christmassy section do you
think it'll be downstairs yeah we could
ask someone Macy's is bloody huge I mean
I know it said it's the largest store in
the world but it feels like it and I
feel like we could climb into these beds
and being the greatest store in the
world which is a great film there's so
many beds you shouldna curler
[Music]
surely it's home surely it's round this
spare oh holiday lane nine okay let's go
up also they have kind of sketchy
elevators look they're proper old school
little wooden things
yeah okay they love me what she found
you
Wow
[Music]
you can go and see father Christmas give
it a cuddle
I'm not gonna lie I kind of want one of
those right Christmas section oh whoa oh
whoa
this is very festive so tacky beaten
[Music]
look at this I mean they really go all
out try me
we're now in the airport we've just come
through security we're starting the
lounge which is so chill
I could actually fall asleep we found
this little corner where there's just
like no one around Alfie and lucky have
gone to get some drinks and food and me
and Zak having a game Oh
 and this is like the perfect
little table have you shuffled
because I feel like you shuffle better

where he showed you how to play it so if
any of you haven't seen that and you're
