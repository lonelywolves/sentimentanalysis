good morning it is currently
the weekend possibly the first weekend
where it really feels like autumn is
well and truly here it is cold i
actually haven't checked the temperature
yeah today but i took nala out this
morning and i was like
whoa six degrees
six degrees celsius so yeah
autumn is finally here i'm ready for it
i'm excited for it
my mum is currently here she came
yesterday and as you can see
i had my hair done we had sam and adam
come and do
our hair they actually did my mum's hair
as well for the f well actually they
trimmed it last time but
um yeah mum came and sam and adam did
her hair
so she's loving that i decided to keep
my extensions out this time
um just to go for something i don't know
a bit different
i obviously took my extensions out in
lockdown i say i i mean alfie and it was
very painful um but i actually quite
liked my hair um at the length it was
then the only thing was that
obviously because of wearing extensions
you usually don't
cut the hair like blunt because you want
it to blend into the extensions as much
as possible
so my ends haven't been trimmed in a
really long time so
even though my extensions are out and i
love the length the hair wasn't like
in the best quality so i was like give
me back the extensions
and then literally like a week or so ago
i was like
ah let's like actually cut
my hair in this length um i went a bit
blonder
so i've gone more blonde through the
front um
just lifted it a little bit i've put a
couple more extensions back in just
around the front just to
keep it um fuller here
um basically i have really thick hair
from like here back
um and that was another reason why i
loved the extension so much was that
once i'd styled my hair or the hair
it stayed in that style so i was able
and i don't wash my hair
that regularly i like to try and leave
it as long as possible sometimes i can
go like five to seven days
and so my hair holding the style i'd put
it in
was a massive massive bonus because it
meant that every morning i could just
wake up
brush my hair and i'm done for the day
um
apart from hair wash day if you have
long extensions you know that hair wash
day is like
it's it's it's something that you have
to put into the calendar basically
so i loved them for that i love that
they held the style
and i could wake up and my hair would
still look
exactly how i styled it the day before
or the day before that
and without the extensions in when i had
this hair
i had to wash it every three days and
restyle it
or restyle it the next day and i just
felt like i was putting so much heat
into my hair so
we did put i actually don't know how
many i've got one
two one two
three three on each side so it's not
that many
um and it just means that they hold the
style a bit more
and thicken out the front and i had a
i've had quite a lot of people asking me
this on instagram because i said
yesterday like i've had the extensions
out but i've had a few more put back in
at the front and they were like what do
you mean
extensions aren't always used for length
a lot of people use tape ins
for thickness um poppy actually has a
couple of
tape ins um just at the front because
naturally her hair is quite thin here as
well
um so yeah they're really useful if you
have
thinner hair or you want a little bit
more body or volume just to add a few
where you feel like you need it
um you don't always have to go for a big
head of tape extensions that are really
long so yeah
i'm really happy with it i love it i've
already done my skincare routine this
morning so
my skin is feeling fresh and
we haven't had breakfast yet but i think
mum wants to do a workout so
i might join her in that i might not you
could do it
10 minutes that's what it takes what
does it involve
oh my gosh and then
okay i'll try i'll do it okay i'm going
to try and do this workout with mum then
let's see how this goes
i actually need a wii first though
otherwise i went myself doing a star
jump
right before we begin this um
morning workout i'd just like to remind
everybody that my mum is very fit
and i am not i'm not
i'm not the one with the fitness you
excuse me how many marathons have you
run you felt
quite a while ago but still i've run
zero mums are on three

[Music]
i can't actually squat look at my butt
as you twist
look at my mom

[Music]
oh
so elbow underneath the shoulder
[Music]

makeup on hair done ready for the day so
i wanted to show you something
super cool and very exciting as you know
i
work with function beauty on a long term
basis they are the only shampoo and
conditioner that i use
religiously i love them i love
everything about the brand
and i know that a lot of you who have
used my code over the year and however
oh god it's been so long
two years a year and a half um also love
it and
always recommend it to your friends and
family me and
team zoella have worked with function of
beauty on a collaboration
it's the first collaboration they've
ever done so i feel very honored i'm
gonna show you what you get in your box
with this collaboration i have already
stuck stickers on my bottles you will
get your
shampoo and conditioner as always
um with your name on it
and then as you can see these have some
stickers now
function of beauty send sticker packs
with
their shampoo conditioner anyway so you
can customize the bottles with their
really cute stickers but we were able to
work together on
my own stickers these are the stickers
how cute i had to get a little pumpkin
spice latte on there because i knew it
would be coming out this time of year
and it's pumpkin spice season and i'm
very happy about it
but yeah these are the little um custom
sticker pack which you will get which as
you can see i've already customized my
bottles
and very excitingly
we made some scrunchies i love these
so there's this really gorgeous um like
satiny pink and then a champagne
pink i also wrote a little note which i
think you'll also get in the box
for any of you that don't know they are
a completely customizable haircare brand
you can go on their website take a very
quick
quiz where you can fill out what hair
goals you want
to achieve and the type of hair you have
and the product that then arrives on
your doorstep
is specifically for your hair type they
have 18 hair goals which is
amazing and these are the ones that i've
selected anti-frizz oil control
replenish hair
shine and thermal protection and i
pretty much stick to that every time
i renew my shampoo conditioner just
because
i feel like this is my perfect
combination and i'm too scared to stray
you can go fragrance free or you can
pick your fragrances which is another
reason why i just think they're fabulous
um my go-to favorite scent is the nude
peach
i love it you can also choose the
strength so if you want something that's
like
got a subtle fragrance you can decide to
do that
i always whack it up i love the
strongest smelling fragrance i like to
be able to be walking down the street
and a gust of wind
picks up my hair and i can still smell
my shampoo and conditioner i like that
the formulations
have no parabens no sulfates no gmos no
toxins they are 100
vegan and 100 cruelty free as well

i can't even explain how tired i am

vlog here
because i'm going to go up to bed
the rain is hammering down i'm going to
listen to my really weird podcast on the
way home
that was very peculiar when we went to
the shop earlier mark's podcast started
playing i was like what is this
nice to see you to see you nice nice
you didn't eat your squid do you want to
take your hair oh take your squids
squid sounded like you stood on

what's in here squid
let's take squid one more time squid
in here there's one in there squid
possible too
squidly what was that thing squid meter
squidward
i was going to say what was he saying oh
yeah let's i know what i was going to do
with you today
put some dates in the diary for like
october autumn fun
yeah i mean we need to carve pumpkins
i've got a bath and body works order on
the way nice we've got to do our um
mask video we're going to find the
craziest marks no you're not yeah we've
we're ordering
masks of amazon and we're going to put
them on but not show each other and then
turn around
of course you are yeah of course you are
crazy and you say i buy weird [ __ ] you
literally say [ __ ] my boyfriend
you're doing the mask reveal together
it's actually a mask
what's that yeah season for all the
autumn thanks for watching brothers
you're welcome happy birthday love you
21 again [ __ ] it's the big one no
no one can know
no i'm gonna be no 29 this year
obviously doesn't count so
next year's big one oh [ __ ] honestly
no one can count their birthdays this
year it's not right yeah that's true
actually 2020
no one's aged birthdays don't count yeah
bye also i just thought i would say
um because we wore the hoodies put the
hoodies on but never actually said when
they were coming out
so i've just checked with alfie and they
are coming out on the 10th
of october do you know why that day
10 10 20. at 10 a.m
mm-hmm afternoon at 10 past 10
no just 10. oh okay why because then
we're not gonna do every job like this
but people that live in america those
are the mumps and the dates the other
way
so that we were planning we're planning
early october and i was like
well let's just do 10 10s and even if
you switch it around because the
americans do it the other way yeah it's
still the same
so over here when we're talking about
dates we put
the day first the day then the month and
the year but in america they do the
month and the day then the year right
yeah
yeah so that makes no difference 10 10
20. oh yeah that's smart
i am gonna end this video here you got
plaster on oh from where you cut your
finger i got it yesterday didn't i i'm
gonna end this vlog here
i hope you've enjoyed it and um i'll see
you very soon i think
things are about to get a bit more
autumny around here is do you mean the
weather
no no you're going to rebound the house
i'm going to revamp the house
i'm going to do my autumn porch next
week
so are you still renting a van for that
yeah zoe's renting a van
to do up the autumn porch well to go and
pick up the pumpkins and the hay bales
and the corn
oh it makes total sense now i get it
because last time me and holly were
hoovering out the car for hours
i'm not doing this again i buy look
it's my one thing i like to do the pork
no it's not but i do really like to do
the porch i really like it and
considering this year is just such a
weird year and there's going to be so
many things we can't do
that's one thing i can still do so i'm
going to really make the most of it
mark's still not gone
it's during the driveway yeah gonna get
a bit more automate and i'll be sure to
vlog it
so that should be happening next week
however the weather looks really bad
and that makes me really sad because if
it carries on like this
it's not going to be as fun to go and
pick pick the pumpkins or
do the porch because we'll just get
absolutely soaked but either way
yeah the porch will be fine but either
way i'm really excited for it so
i hope you've enjoyed the video today um
and i'll see you again
pretty soon with a whole lot of autumn
bye
