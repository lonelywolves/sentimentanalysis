it's so beautiful excuse the crocs if
you can see them
you don't like them oh
even the ring is nice yeah oh there she
is
she sleeps with her eyes open
[Music]
[Music]
oh
i'm doing a sad face but you can't see
good morning everybody last night was
fun
wasn't it no i still feel like it's the
evening from yesterday
let's just say naland was ill a lot of
last night
from one end i know i have to
i have to wrap this around my ear twice
nala
was not feeling great so alfie and i
were tag teaming through the night
taking it in turns although you did do
two in a row because i was like
i'm so i've been waking up at 5 30 every
morning and last night me and alfie were
like oh my god we're going to bed at 12.
i was like i reckon i'm going to sleep
past 5 30. i'm gonna do it you said and
i was like
i really hope so i think tonight is the
night i think it is
and then lo and behold nala wakes up
like
every hour and a half through the night
we're back at the vets
she's got to get her boot taken off this
morning and hopefully they'll give her
something for her tummy
um because yeah she's just a little
unsettled
um but it is what it is
we're doggy parents that's just what you
have to do and just
just think about how hard it's going to
be to be parents oh i know
and that's like nothing like how long
does this go on for when you're a parent
i suppose it's different for different
children i don't know
well like six months maybe more
literally no idea is this her coming
back because that would be awkward
we're sat in the vet car park and
they've just taken her in
i can't tell when your dog needs the
toilet and i'm not talking like oh i
need to go out i'm talking like
needs the toilet and you have to get
downstairs put on a harness
put on a lead put on a little plastic
boot it's like it's literally a race
against time throw a coat on
throw your crocs on get outside in the
pitch black
it was quite funny it was quite uh so
yeah that's what we're doing this
morning
i've already edited my video though so
that's one plus of being up early
because i've actually got quite a lot to
do today yeah you've already been awake
for four hours yeah i've already been
i'm actually feeling okay alfie just
said to me are you not like do you not
just feel
on a scale of one to ten really tired
and actually right now i'm feeling okay
i'm feeling like no i'm awake i'm ready
for the day but i do think
at like one o'clock i'll start
getting quite tired um and i don't drink
coffee so
you can coffee up i'm gonna have to go
for a coffee now
i feel like so it's the only way to
describe it
is that i was having a really nice sleep
and then to wake me up this morning
someone just hit me on the head with a
frying pan
and i'm just like oh my god okay that's
what i feel like right now oh god
also the reason we've got our masks on
is obviously because um
when the vet brings nala back out you
have to wear masks and you have to stay
in the car park this is the new protocol
we're gonna go for a coffee after this
hopefully the boot comes off we're gonna
see what her leg looks like without
like i wonder what it looks like no i
hope the scar is only small my ears
i was thinking that yesterday i looked
in the mirror and i was like this
this face mask i wear the same brand of
face masks i got them from these vending
machines
and i've got white and black i've got
multiple of each but they pull my ears a
bit forward do you see it
yeah everyone my ears hurt when i wear
the mask
i was thinking like if i wear it like
this for
i don't know it's nearly been it's
coming in three months or whatever it'll
be a year
so i'm like if my ears have been every
time i go out pulled forward for a year
do you think when i take it off
eventually they'll just stay full
they're going to be
like legit i mean look at mine mine
can't stay like
this like if we have to wear face masks
for another two years yeah true
your ears would have probably
appreciated you know what i would
probably invest in having some made
perfectly to fit my face
i mean it's only been eight months yeah
well i didn't think i'd be wearing it
this long i'm not gonna lie
maybe we should see if we could get some
light those fits perfectly
maybe we could just make make some of
these bits ourselves we can just extend
it
yeah some of them you can adjust with
elastic
but obviously this one was just way too
big for my face
so i have to like double cross it over
wakey wakey oh you're about to swallow
yours
vets is done nala's in the back
hi bb she has a new bandage on now for
some reason i thought the vet said they
were gonna remove the bandage which they
did but then i didn't realize they were
gonna put a new one on but that does
make more sense because
her legs not gonna be healed yet so i
think it was more a case of removing
one bandage and take that dressing off
and put a new bandage and dressing on so
that's what she's had done we've been
sent away with
a crap ton of medication so we'll have
to make sure we're staying on top of
that
and some syringes as you do
so we're going to have to get home and
sort out what she's got to take
and then give her a tiny bit of
breakfast we've got to feed her little
and often
so today is meant to be quite a busy day
for me but
i don't know how much i'm actually gonna
get done when i need to be
chopping narla up with a ton of
medication and feeding her four times a
day and we still have to use the plastic
boot for outside so
it's all good though we love you you and
your squitty bum
alfie's now grabbing some coffees
i've actually gone for a chai latte so
that's not coffee but that's a tea
um and i'm excited about it chai latte
with almond milk
and he's just text me a picture of the
food and they had
a cinnamon bun with white chocolate
ganache
and that sounded delicious so i've also
gone for one of those
hello what a day this is turning out to
be
i just feel like there's not enough
hours in the day and today is one of
those days where there is
not enough hours in the day i've just
had a really exciting package
so i thought i would also side note oh
my god
well that doesn't dry i was gonna say
side note alfie bought this like
roller thing um that like covers your
address
but uh i put that on there literally
just now and it hasn't dried
and it's gone all over my cream jumper
so i don't know that i would recommend
that
i have had a function of beauty delivery
as you guys know i work with
function of beauty and oh
very nearly just cut myself be very
careful with scissors guys
always use with adult supervision the
last time i spoke to you about function
of beauty i
had done a collaboration with them it
was the
zoella x function of beauty
collaboration and we had
the limited edition stickers and the
scrunchies that i basically just live in
and so many of you um ordered it oh my
goodness this is
such a mess right i'm gonna put this on
the ground i should not have used that
roller
on that label it's all over my hand
you'll have to excuse that
so many of you ordered it and loved it
and it was amazing to see you all
tagging me on your stories when you were
receiving your function of beauty boxes
so yeah just thank you for the support
on that and i'm so pleased
you love it as much as i do if you're
hearing me talk about functional beauty
for the first time i am aware that a lot
of you may have heard me talking about
this already so i will keep it brief
but they are a um hair care brand
um they actually do other things too
which i will mention in a minute but
they are fully customizable
haircare brand so you can choose things
like your hair goals
the things that you want to achieve the
type of hair you have you literally fill
out a survey online
i just feel that my hair is in such good
condition i feel that it's really
healthy considering i
put bleach on my hair i
yeah i love it today as i said something
super exciting
they have a new limited edition
fragrance and
i am gonna smell this with you now for
the first time
this fragrance is for the holiday season
it's called isn't she bubbly
and it's a sparkling champagne and
citrus
fragrance i've somehow managed to get
this on my finger
i can already smell it it smells
incredible
oh that is so fresh and so zingy but
also so festive
so this has notes of sparkling champagne
and
sweet orange peel and grapefruit oil
it smells incredible it smells it really
reminds me of something
but i have no idea what that reminds me
of
i love that i can't wait to use that
that's gonna smell incredible
as i said that fragrance is for a
limited time only
but it's available in the shampoo the
conditioner the mask the leave-in
treatment the serum
the body lotion and the shower gel and
as i said i was gonna mention these
because uh they also allow you to fully
customize
a shower gel and a body lotion so when i
remember
to use body lotion this is actually the
one that lives on my bedside table i use
it on my hands my arms
my legs as you know i'm not the best at
moisturizing but something with a pump
just makes life so much easier
and you can select the type of skin you
have and how much moisture you want so
love that as i always mentioned function
of beauty
have no sulfates no parabens no toxins
no gmos
and they are 100 cruelty free and vegan
and i've literally been using this for
almost
two years i wouldn't change it i love it
my hair loves it
if you would like to check it out or you
want to check out the limited edition
fragrance then check my link below you
can go on over and you can get 20
off oh my gosh i've just realized
they also have these new festive
stickers
these are so cute and as always
got my name on the bottle alfie also
uses function of beauty so
the fact that this has my name on now is
actually very handy so that he does not
use mine anymore
i'm not just gonna sit and moisturize
because after i said that i was very
aware of the fact that my skin felt so
dry and i was like when was the last
time i moisturized let's be honest
i'm actually really glad i put some
makeup on because
i was feeling i'd reached that point the
point that i said earlier where i was
like i think i'm gonna struggle
uh past one o'clock well it's two
o'clock now and i
could shut my eyes and fall asleep but
actually putting a bit of makeup on
getting freshened up having a shower has
made me feel so much better also just
realized the radiator i'm sat in front
of i came in here because this is like
the only room with
half decent natural light in it
everywhere in the house today is so dark
it's one of those days i really wanted
to go out for a walk as well and now i'm
just a bit like
don't know about that and nala can't go
on a walk because
of her leg at one point i was going on
so many walks and walks were like my
my thing that was my like wind down i
put a podcast
on put the lead and harness on nala and
out we would go
and especially through the second
lockdown and just before that actually
i was trying to get out and do a walk
every day and i
really really loved it i absolutely love
getting outside discovering new places
to go
finding new areas around where we live
and obviously now loved going outside as
well
and then with nyla's leg we cut we
weren't
to let her um we didn't want the
lump to get swollen so we were told not
to really take her anywhere or let her
do anything that would mean it could
swell up before the surgery and now
obviously she needs to recover so
no doggy walks at least but that is no
excuse i should still go outside
even without the dog but it's just not a
very nice day
tonight i am gonna do a little instagram
live with amy
on um my instagram and we're gonna do a
little
magpie q a which i'm really excited
about i feel like amy and i haven't
spoken
in so long when we were writing the book
together we would speak back and forth
so much obviously um and now obviously
the book is out and
in the world um although we have been a
little prep
for book two which will be starting
officially in january we've kind of
started we'd already started
with the plot um two years ago
uh but fleshing out i really hate that
word but it's the only word i can really
think of
um and we'll begin
writing the book in january so
this little bit of time like after
publication
and christmas and new year is kind of
like
talking about the book and getting to
read all your reviews
and having it out in the world but it
means that amy and i don't really need
to speak to each other as much which is
quite weird so i'm excited to see her
i'm excited to catch up and we just
thought it'd be really nice to jump on
instagram
and allow some of you to ask us some
questions and for us to answer them
and i mean what else is anyone doing on
a thursday evening these days
anyway so i actually do want to try and
do a few more lives
i think at the moment i'm where i'm
trying to juggle doing this
and being on insta stories even i'm
finding it quite hard i'm really bad at
doing both
and i've said this for years when i put
100 into one everything else sort of
falls away a bit but
um i do love an instagram live i love
watching them too
especially when you're doing something
like putting your makeup on or
getting ready for the day or just like
winding down it's just something nice
i've literally just bought um basically
one of my favorite podcasts
series which i've talked about a few
times is
called joan and jericho i think it's
called dear joan and jerica
definitely not one for the faint-hearted
it's quite
dark humor i feel like if you know julia
davis as a comedian you know her humor
is quite dark anyway so i think
immediately you'll know if it's for you
or not and i know people who don't find
it funny at all
but um it's just great
mark and i love watching um
all of her tv series we're obsessed
basically and
a new series of the podcast came out
recently i think there's four episodes
now and i've obviously listened to all
of them
but the most recent one was actually
filmed
so they were dressed in their characters
and they were being interviewed on a
stage
obviously it's like socially distanced
and there wasn't a live audience but you
were able to purchase
a viewing of it so i did that today and
i'm really excited to sit down later and
watch it
i started watching a couple of minutes
of it downstairs just to check that it
worked
um and i thought no i'm gonna save this
i'm gonna wait until the day is done
and then i'm gonna sit down and i'm
gonna really thoroughly enjoy it
but it looks great i've sent mark the
link as well and he's all over it
if you want something really funny a
little bit dark a little bit crude
um then definitely check out dear joan
and jericho on
uh podcast um wherever you listen to
your podcasts
because it is great nice little
distraction that will
no doubt make you smile or laugh um but
yeah
love that so that's that's my little
half to in the day update i said the
other day
that i wanted to pop the wreath up on
the door and i still haven't done it and
it's now the 10th of december and that's
just not acceptable
so i'm going to do the wreath now i'm
going to show you it first because i
love it right let me put you down here
also can we take a minute
i'm not wearing loungewear today i
actually
got dressed but these um trousers are
too small for me
and they just just keep popping open so
apologies for that in this wreath
i saw
on instagram i
you know what instagram is like with me
and targeting me with ads that i just
end up buying everything i don't know
whether this was an ad
or if i saw somebody else mention it or
it came up
somewhere i genuinely don't remember i
feel like this was an ad and i bought
this
um through the ad but this wreath
is by a lovely lady called sean
ryan design and sean is a small business
and she makes these wreaths and i just
thought
i'd really love to support a small
business this year with my wreath
purchasing
and so this is the wreath
it has ornaments on it like actual glass
um is it macrame baubles on it so once
this has had its time
i do feel like it will survive quite
well but once it's had its time
i can take the decorations off and i can
pop these on the tree
um it's got literally oh god as i'm
holding it i'm pulling bits off
it's got like everything in it it's
so beautiful and she's handmade this
and so i will leave a link down below um
there's the the hanger there and i'm
just gonna go and pop this
i'm gonna sneeze um but yeah i'm gonna
go and pop this on the door
but how beautiful is that i'll show you
more outside because i'll be able to get
up close with the detail but
i love it how sad does my porch look
without all the pumpkins and hay bales
one of these years i am gonna put
together a festive porch
i just don't know what i would do
because i feel like going out and
purchasing
loads of christmas trees just seems
quite extravagant
not that buying like 35 pumpkins
isn't but pumpkins just feel smaller
than actual trees
um so i don't know i love the idea of
putting a little bench out here
like make it like a little seating area
or something but
work in progress maybe maybe this time
next year maybe i'll do a smaller autumn
porch and a
bigger christmas one for now we have a
lot of
alfie's boxes for something which don't
don't look so cute
and a very plain looking door which is
about to get
a little christmas blower excuse the
crocs if you can see them
lovely look at that
it's literally got everything
christmassy you could ever think of
right i just had a delivery of
my neon ribbons so these are the pink
these are the yellow
and the green and they didn't have any
orange in stock but i do still have some
of the orange ribbon that i use a little
bit of yesterday
so i am gonna get wrapping some of these
because i'm really excited for them to
look
more spectacular what color should we do
for your mum and dad and what color
should we do for poppy and sean
whoa they're cool aren't they they are
vibrant not what i thought zombies would
be buying
what do you mean they're like it's not
very rustic i suppose
they're like neon biscuits you know like
that shop yeah
you don't like them
i think they're probably the least
festive thing i've ever seen
it looks like me it looks like knowledge
bandage
just trust me i trust you you know
you're far better decorating than me
so which color should we do for poppy
and sean and which one for your mouth
and dad
[Music]
done that for a bit i have yet to try
this cinnamon roll with white chocolate
ganache
so i'm just going to sit and eat this oh
it's got little red currants on the top
i'm going to take them off
hi okay i had an appointment yesterday
with i've been
thinking about this uh
decoration this ribbon i don't know if i
like it
alf you don't like it i don't know
now you've said it i'm like i don't
think it goes with the tree
i don't think it goes i've tried to say
it's not the most festive
but i was just trying to do something a
bit different a bit fun
yeah but i think that it looks like
birthday presents
that's what i'm saying oh no is it that
is it that important when all
it's gonna be is ripped open and then
it's a nice ribbon to keep
are you saying i should take the ribbon
off
i'm not saying anything because there is
not a right answer i could possibly say
right now
i really like the ribbon i like the
ribbon with the paper
but looking at it under the tree i'm
like
i i just don't know
what do you think guys should i stick
with this theme i'm going with
or should i just take the ribbon off and
just admit that it doesn't really look
very festive
and that it looks more like birthday
presents i had a vision
and i think i think the vision is there
i just don't know if that vision matches
the christmas tree and the rest of
the christmas in this house vision i
also really liked the idea
that i could easily be like okay that's
an amanda and nick present that's a
poppy and sean present because of the
color the ribbon i liked that
but i don't know now you've said it
i can't get it out of my head when i
look at it i'm like i just don't think
i just don't think that looks good it's
just a bit cyberdog
that shot used to be inviting me in the
lanes do you remember
that's the theme i was going for cyber
dog xmas
i don't know maybe when there's loads
under there it won't look so bad
maybe when there's everyone else's
presence you won't really
see it you won't really see the
neon when everyone else is present there
i feel like i'm getting a tan sitting
over here right i really like
the ribbons though they're really cool
damn it i don't know i think okay well
we've got time
yeah let's just let's just live with it
and see how we feel about it
i'm doing my live with amy in
half an hour i'm not gonna lie
i could properly just go to bed
right now i'm so tired but
i'm excited to do it it'll be really fun
so i just need to set up
this ring light so that i've got better
lighting
and get answering some questions
okay actually oh even the ring is nice
yeah this was
three boys this was 35 pounds
bargain alfie basically laughed at me
when i bought this
to be fair i thought it was going to be
a big one i didn't laugh at the ring
light a lot because you thought it was
going to be like this
and it's actually like this bloody hell
and you can go down
let's pull up your camera boy oy
okay and then look you can change it to
like that
or blue blue light
warm light white light and then you can
go up and down
okay that's sick that is bloody that's
35 pound well spent
happy with that i'm about to go live
all good elf yeah all good over there

don't know why
really yeah it's just my own instagram

put comments in for
come over here i'm live
did anyone hear alfie there i'm gonna
tune in and just write comments from
over here
hi everyone happy thursday hope you're
all having a great day
hi alex we'll just wait for a few people
to join
i just thought it would be nice for me
and amy to come on and chat about magpie
because we've not done that here
on instagram together and also i haven't
spoken to amy in so long
oh thanks al hi everyone
hi hi hi oh your baby just said hi
hi nora right
oh there she is that worked it said amy
text you and i was like i
if i click that what happens to this
live how are you doing
i'm doing really well thank you look at
you with magpie behind you wait
i like to represent
first question is from am and she said
how did you come
up with the concept for this book
so this was an interesting one because
we we kind of knew what kind of book but
like we kind of just like we wanted to
write a mystery didn't we
first of all very early on like
literally like
two years into our friendship yeah
definitely
and it was sort of like once uh like
once we knew that we wanted to
kind of write that young adult mystery
then it was like a matter of like
picking out what really interested us i
guess wasn't it
like we were we both loved the kind of
atmosphere and things of a
pretty little eye we talked about that
quite a lot haven't played yeah and
a new like broad church and a lot of
lots of other shows like that
um and then it was like we wanted to
really like root it in british
superstitions and traditions and things
that like
you know may stand out from some of the
american uh young adult stuff that's out
there
and i think that we're trying to think
about like different
weird british things yeah i think like
saluting a backfire you go by and then
and then the poem and then that also
kind of came together for us
yeah 100 it was kind of like an
amalgamation
of all the things we loved to watch we
loved to read
we loved to like listen to all rolled
into one pretty much
one of the one of the other most asked
questions was who wrote who
oh yeah which we actually said in our
first
video that we made about it but for a
lot of people they actually don't know
that i wrote ivy and amy wrote audrey
but
we're still writing each other's
characters and we're still
very much um you know
as into each character as the other
because obviously there's scenes where
i'm writing ivy but audrey features
really heavily or has a lot of dialogue
so
i have to make sure when i'm writing
audrey it's like
in the same vein that when amy is
writing audrey's chapters it makes total
sense which
we managed to do i think really well
considering like we couldn't
meet in person i think that comes from
like because it's been so long
in like gestation like since we thought
about it for so long and like these
characters have been building for a lot
longer than we actually
sat down and started the actual writing
like all of that we've done so much work
kind of behind the scenes on developing
those characters together
like and then when we sat down to
actually write them separately
it was it flowed a lot more naturally
yeah already done
it's so true i feel like we knew them
before we wrote them
yeah definitely which i think helped
enormously
when we were faced with lockdown
and having to and also amy and i we were
at like
a very pivotal point of the writing
process where
we were going to meet and that's another
of the questions actually is how did you
guys find
writing in a pandemic um and i think
that part of it we handled really well
considering that was when we
would have most benefited from being
together which is going through the
edits
going through all the proofs like really
going over
everything with a fine tooth comb and
actually we changed like a fair amount
in those last few
like months oh definitely it is
surprising how much
how much you edit a book like you think
it's you know one draft and then you're
finished but actually
once you get uh like we have a great
editor at penguin
uh emma who would read and give us
comments and then after that we have to
kind of sit down and
really make sure the book flows as a
whole but also means that like
anything you know we sort of like some
of the key reveals that happened towards
the end of the book we really worked
hard to make sure it all made sense and
also it was all setting up for the
second book and that requires a lot of
like layering and careful
yeah generation so and we have to do
that basically all
through whatsapps facetimes
how do you go about planning yeah to
write a book
and i think for a lot of people
especially this year where they felt
like they wanted to put their creativity
into something
or they've had more time or they've
wanted a new kind of distraction and
thought i've always wanted to write a
book so how do you even go about like
planning that out and i think for us and
a genre like this
is kind of vital because if you want to
start planting seeds and you want to
start
you know layering in like the easter
eggs and making sure everything makes
total sense
with your like bigger vision it did mean
that amy and i literally spent
like two years getting everything
in a place where when it actually came
down to writing
it felt like the easiest part of the
process because we've already
done so much work when you
um especially if you already know that
you that you want to write a novel
in college like that's really uh like
early on if you have that goal and you
have that dream i think
the only thing i would say is that um
that it just takes persistence
because even the even though the first
novel that i wrote
um while i was at university got
published
that wasn't the first one i'd ever
written like i have
two non-whole novels that i like
discarded didn't even try
to get published but because i think one
of the like the
biggest things i'd have to say is that
just finishing a novel like getting a
start a middle and an end
down on the page is such a big
accomplishment like it's
huge it's so much work to do that and
if you are already that far trust me
you're way ahead of so many people
out there and the second thing i would
say is that try and find
a group whether that's maybe that's not
in person at the moment but um one of
the things that really helped me even
even though i went to university now 15
16 years ago and
the internet was like not as big as it
is now but finding
like a writing community online actually
really helped me like
because part of writing which people
don't necessarily think about but
is other people reading it like
eventually you have to let it go and you
have to share what you've written and
that's
learning how to do that which is really
tough i find that
really hard it is really hard like you
think the writing is hard
but actually it's like letting other
people read it it's really hard
getting that feedback and like because
you're making yourself so vulnerable and
you're you know it's like a really
personal thing that you're suddenly
sharing with the world but you kind of
have
if you want to be a novelist whether
that's published or whether you want to
publish
yourself or whatever you want to do if
you want to be a writer that people read
then you have to get used to sharing
your stuff so find that kind of
community of
hopefully like nice people who will you
know
give you critique but in a nice way and
like and encourage you
like that was the biggest help for me
because it's it's an isolating
profession like you're often like on
your own that has been amazing
it's me i'm on the sofa again oh my
goodness
i am just i'm
done for the day i have something on the
tv about christmas markets
and it's making me wish that i was in
bruges more than ever
buying something sweet and edible
and delicious from a market stall
and that's not what's happening but
look at this dog
this is the most asleep she's been all
day the little leg
oh i just have a feeling that this could
be another night of taking her out every
couple of hours to the toilet so
i think i'm gonna end this here and uh
i feel like today's been one of those
very
kind of adult admini life days
she sleeps with her eyes open that
scares me
i don't like that
