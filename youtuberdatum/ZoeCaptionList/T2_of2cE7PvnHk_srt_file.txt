presents are getting wrapped
who's happy the gourmet
oh i thought it was a trade
[Music]
good morning everybody nala had a fairly
good night's sleep with her little
bandage
um i think she's still just trying to
work out like
what she can do with her leg and how she
can move and how she can lie down and
which positions she can put herself in
but and i did think i'm not gonna lie
well tonight's gonna be a nightmare
because she's not gonna be able to get
comfy because she just kept doing this
thing where she was just sitting up but
like
falling asleep because she didn't want
to lie down she was actually fine
she slept you slept well didn't you
um when we take her outside we have to
put
this little plastic bag tied around her
bandage
and it's the saddest thing i've ever
seen her just dragging this
around the garden because we can't get
the bandage wet i don't know if you
saw it properly in the video yesterday
but look at her little bandage with the
heart on it
you're such a good girl i'm making
myself a little breakfast alfie's
already made his i think he had toast
i fancied some tomatoes on toast
so that is what i am doing i think i
might also do some
egg egg toast tomatoes
perfect i am gonna do
my balsamic and smoked paprika
breakfast um lots of you asked me i did
this thing on my instagram recently
where i said
let me know if there's anything you want
to know where it's from and so many of
you asked me where my balsamic glaze was
from
i think this is just from sainsbury's or
um
waitrose i don't know but it's the brand
is merchant
gourmet it's a glaze rather than a
vinegar which is what makes it like
thick and like squeezy highly recommend
if you're after a new balsamic glaze
[Music]
there we go breakfast done let's have a
look at the eggs
i'm not sure how well i did in the on
the egg front
oh that's a good one
alfie's watching is this futurama
come on adventure time no
oh i don't know you do know this one
i don't know it rick and morty that's
the one i meant instead of adventure
time
rick and morty okay breakfast
right ready for the day breakfast has
been had
nala's chillin by the fire and i thought
it would be a good time alfie's doing a
little bit of christmas shopping
my camera's decided to focus on you
instead of me alfie's doing a little bit
of christmas shopping
still we've still got a few things to
buy
um but i'm not actually feeling too
stressed about it i think we'll get it
all done in the end we always do so it's
fine
but yeah i'm gonna start on some
wrapping
because usually if you've been following
my vlogmases for a couple of years alfie
and i rush
rap on christmas eve or the 23rd and
this year i don't want to leave it so
late
and i also just think it would be nice
to have the presents under the tree
just to hide the like tree stand so
i'm just gonna start i've got sugar rush
on again because i missed like the first
bit of it yesterday
so i'm re-watching that i'm gonna wrap
some presents this is gonna have to be
the most like carefully edited bit of
footage because obviously i don't want
you to see what i'm wrapping in case
anybody
i'm rapping for watches this video this
is the paper we've decided to go for
this year
um it's a paper chase special we
normally buy our paper from paperchase
and it's just this white paper
and it just has oh not in focus it just
has this really lovely
little um
[Applause]
black trees and reindeer
and then a little pop of neon green so
that inspired me to wrap the presents
with this it's quite like
a neutral wrapping paper there's not too
much going on
and then i thought neon ribbon would be
quite nice so i ordered this
on paperchase and i've just ordered on
amazon
some like um is it called rafita
taffeta something like that in neon pink
neon yellow
and neon green so i thought it would be
quite nice to do that
maybe even have a color for
each like household so i could use
orange on like
external people's presents and then
maybe the green on poppy and sean
or the pink on amanda and nick's
presence just so that it's easy to pull
them out from under the tree we know
whose is who's without looking at the
tags i'm gonna get started
[Music]
do
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
presents are getting wrapped
i have just been sat there for
hour hour and a half wrapping presents
feeling good i'm gonna wait for the rest
of the ribbon to arrive
before i fully like decorate them so on
a lot of them i've just written on the
paper who it's for
so but i'll proper doll them up when i
can
i'm doing something super exciting for
this afternoon
myself and mark are going to
the beach it's not the nicest day i'm
hoping it might clear up a little bit
for a nice sunset which will be
happening in around an hour's time

the week
so far yeah yeah this is great but
nala's little surgery went well
and i've had some really nice face times
of people this week
which i've really enjoyed like i feel
like i've done a lot of like catching up
with people do you ever get that
thing where if you feel like you've not
caught up with someone in a long time
it's like it
you feel bad like i feel like
something's missing like i feel like i
really must catch up with that person
and then i had like loads of days this
week where i was like right i spoke to
my mum for ages spoke to alfie's mum for
ages spoke to poppy for ages and like
i just feel like i've done a lot of like
speaking to people properly yeah which
has been quite nice yeah
yeah i feel like especially during these
times like a lot of people do forget
like
there is a lot more going on than what
they post online i think we spoke about
oh yeah
so you could literally look at your
friend and be like oh my god they're
fine don't need to check on them
but you do drink your water and check on
your friends don't drink your water
check on your friends
don't just look at their stories and
assume
oh look at that lovely day they're
having look at that lovely thing they've
just posted they look fine
yeah it's not always the case everyone
is fighting a battle that we don't know
about
that yeah
some people like oh why did you post
them i'm like they also help me
yeah but also they help everybody else
who sees your stories
so yeah a good quote is nice this hot
chocolate is delish
tastes a little bit like food they
always taste like feet
have you never had cheese lips before
had cheese lit
these are the same they do always taste
like feet

instead of me
hello anyway i love you
see you soon garden center definitely
when do you want to go
i mean i'm not up to much so
every day until the 24th
let's do it back shoved my hair up
got a bath running i was just emptying
my little
picnic basket and got these out that
mark had bought
this one's him and this one's me he said
um and i'm gonna put them on this tree
because
i've also got little characters like
this
where's the other one i feel like here
he is see
and i just feel like they go perfectly
on here i might move this mushroom
because he's only a small one
put that on there
and then pop them both here i feel like
it's only right that they go on together
[Laughter]
he said that whenever i look at my tree
now
it will remind him of me and him
how cute there you go mark
i've popped them on
as i was hunting for a picnic basket i
noticed that i had been
sent one um from kate spade
and i obviously took everything out in
order to take the picnic basket
and i very quickly got to see what was
in there but i haven't properly properly
looked but i just wanted to say thank
you kate spade
because this is looking very cool look
at these
champagne coupe set of two glasses
they're like tortoise shell
they are amazing so i've got two of
those
a bottle
look at that save that for christmas day
um i also got in the
thing dolly alderton's new book ghosts
kate somerville brighton and even
vitamin b3 vitamin c vitamin active
concentrates
a little bit of skincare we've got this
straw london
sit on i think that's a little soap um
these oh which i might put in my bath
ortigia
i don't know if i'm ever pronouncing
that right my memory ran out
um these bath salts do you recognize
this branding or
i feel like this one like a pillow
wasn't that we've got no
this was the products in the bathroom in
dubai in that hotel we stayed in
how could i ever ever
remember that this is very cool i've
never seen anything like this this
is do you strike the match on this
because this bit feels harder
oh so it's matches in here
and then i think you can strike should i
just see
that's cool that's so cool that's really
cool what a cool present for someone
like your mum would love something like
this
because it's like you can keep it out it
looks cool
i don't know what brand this is cafe
paris and then
we have this kate spade bag
how cool is that little kitty on it
and it's velvet that is lovely and it
has a strap
little chain strap as well little kate
spade bag that would be a lovely little
makeup bag
and then i think there's something in
here as well
some earrings oh thank you so much kate
spade
and the basket came in useful for the
picnic today
so that is perfect okay
bath is run
and i'm gonna read my book finding love
at the christmas market
so i think i'm gonna end this here um as
i'm gonna get in the bath and then i'm
gonna probably put my pjs on
and start on this edit or just chill
watch your christmas film lay out on the
sofa make some dinner
but i really hope you enjoyed the video
today it was so nice getting to see mark
and even though it wasn't like fully
normal or what we would have been doing
um i really really enjoyed that we still
got to see each other
and actually sitting out on the beach
was really nice got a bit of fresh air
got out the house had a little picnic it
was perfect
and it was so nice catching up with him
and
yeah i really hope you also enjoyed that
and i will see you again
tomorrow good night
