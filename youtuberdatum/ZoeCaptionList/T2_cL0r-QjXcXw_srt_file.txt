cookie
good morning it's currently
vlogmas day too i'm outside
it's 7am i'm just
taking arla out to the toilet but it's
such a nice morning
look the moon is still there can you see
it
moon is there nola's having a wee
and then look at the sunrise
just looks magic look at that beautiful
sunrise narla
you can't really appreciate that can you
so nice yes no don't start that
it's so cold in fact that in order to
come outside i put a hat on
and my duvet sleeping bag
coat i've still got my little adult
onesie on
good girl oh it's so nice
i should just come out here with my
duvet coat
my hat and a little hot chocolate
and watch the sunrise
the christmas tree all good
it's a bit slippy isn't it should we get
you breakfast
huh come on in
come on and i have alfie's crocs on
which are not the warmest i'm not gonna
lie
good girl can i get in wait wait wait
you're walking on two legs sit down
good job god i need like
eye patches i'm gonna make a start on
yesterday's edit hello
um i've got fire on and i'm also gonna
catch up on
yesterday's uh i'm a celebrity get me
out of here because i fell asleep and i
didn't see it
so i have no idea who's gone uh who got
to do the trial
nothing so that's my morning
sorted okay i'm ready for the day
edit is done video is scheduled
for four o'clock usual vlogmas time i
don't know why i do 4 o'clock i think
because it just feels like
i can have the whole evening afterwards
and it was always a really good time
obviously when we could you know go out
and do things and make plans
um four o'clock was always like that
like in between time
where you could do something in the
morning or the afternoon get back
and then if you had evening plans i know
video is done first one
in the bag uh don't know what you think
of it yet because
you haven't watched it yet but i
forget every year how long it takes me
to edit and get myself ready and
before you know it the entire morning
has gone
i haven't really done anything this
morning apart from editing and getting
ready
um i did uh
have breakfast with alfie he cooked or
we both cooked actually um
had a little bagel had some scrambled
eggs and bacon
and some oven roasted tomatoes which
i'm just obsessed with bit of balsamic
tomatoes in the oven
love it they're really sweet i think
because i really like a very sweet
breakfast
um i really really like it so i was
happy with that
and i think alfie is in a meeting
currently but i do think that we are
going gonna head into town
um it's the second today and we
are now out of lockdown and we are in
tier two um as i was saying yesterday i
don't know why i didn't say yesterday
tomorrow we go into tier 2 i think
because i felt like the second was so
far away
it means we can see six people outside
now instead of one-on-one
so i think we're going to go into town
and meet steven alexia in town
have a little mooch around just get out
and get a bit of fresh air
maybe grab a coffee or a drink i kind of
fancy a bubble tea
i'm excited just to get out just to walk
around and do something outside
so that's the plan we are now in town we
just popped in to zara home
although i've already bought quite a lot
of stuff from there online
look who we found stephen and alexia are
allowed to actually
be together to interact as a four
outside
2.0 is kind of over right yeah but it's
nice to be outside
i know nice to see friends a little bit
normal today
yeah it is yeah it's so true
it gives you a right pep in your step
ben's cookie
at least one chocolate already it is
christmas yeah just one
ben's cookie is always a good idea oh
what's this bangers and burgers is it
smooth
this looks new everything's got his head
in there
this looks real good the lights are up
in the lanes
it looks so festive we've actually ended
up
doing a little bit of christmas shopping
we weren't expecting to do that
do you feel good about it far more
successful than what i thought
yeah i thought we should get enough of
coffee but we've ended up with quite a
few presents
yeah um so we've got a few presents
oops someone's reversing to a table
look how nice this looks i wish these
lights were up all year round
you had a nice shopping experience
i could never get you in shop i may have
shown that song
this is a beta
here we go okay so we go
first yeah so we're going to choose one
shape yeah
yeah here we go okay
steve's got his last one
if you are ever in brighton and you love
a bubble tea
you have to come here to tt that's the
sign
he's not ready psychology
um if you are confused by that clip in
tt
basically um that is the owner that's
the owner right
yeah and he's so so lovely and on
wednesdays
um if you win at rock paper scissors
he'll give you a discount if he wins
no discount bit of fun um but yeah
definitely go there
yeah he's very good he's like a mind
reader he just knows i feel like today
has been a day where there's not been a
lot to film and here we are again
this lighting looks a bit odd here we
are again
pitch black outside in fact like my nose
it looks
so cold and it feels like it's the end
of the day it's not
it's like half six
ten ten past seven nearly my bedtime
guys
as i said yesterday i did do a
christmas like home haul um a couple of
weeks ago now and
since obviously we hadn't started
decorating the house i
just left them in the boxes and i
thought i would share it with you
as i went through the boxes and then as
i sort of dispersed it around the house
as we decorate over the coming weeks
um or this week at least and i thought
you'd
really like to see what i got
i personally am a
huge fan of a christmas home haul
i just love christmas decor a lot
and i haven't really been able to
christmas decor shop out and about this
year as i usually would so
i've pretty much done it all online and
if i'm honest there isn't
anything i need i have a lot of
christmas decor
as you can imagine but last year
i had a really big sort out and actually
got rid of a fair few
some of the more older bits that i just
wasn't getting out each year
most things i sort of keep pretty
similar like i've done this
for a couple of years in a row so
there's some things i'm just like no
i'm happy with how that is i like how
that looks
i don't want to change that up at least
this year anyway
um but there was definitely lots of
tablescape stuff um and i love
setting the table for christmas day it's
like one of my favorite things ever so i
definitely know i ordered a few things
for the table here i'm gonna take off my
hat
and i'm gonna sit down here in this
little
nook um and i'm gonna show you what i
got but first
what was i gonna do i was gonna light
here we go here's the lighter i was
gonna light this candle so this is a
magic
candle and i got this from marx and
spencer watch this
first thing i just want to show you
there is no
switch anywhere because
i looked and i checked but
the minute you light it
lights come on i don't know how this
works it's total magic
it's like this one as well let's get
cozy up in here
okay first off we're going
zara homes oh my god alfie's literally
got roller skates
as you do it's like a special delivery
first thing that i spotted on the zara
home website which has some
lovely things on it oh my phone's saying
someone's ding-a-ling in me were these
charger plates which are so cute they
have like
um embossed or debossed stars on the
bottom
and they've got um gold paint in them
but i just thought they were really
lovely so they're glass
so you will have to be careful with them
um
but for christmas day
with the plate on top
i just thought they were lovely so and
they kept going out of stock so i kept
having to go back on
and try and get more so i don't actually
know how many i got in total but i got
three here together they're very heavy
um not a necessity but
i like a charger plate because if
anything like
spills over from your plate instead of
it going on a tablecloth
just easy to wipe it looks great um
i have some that i use all the time that
are just
um plain gold and i just thought these
were a nice
nice alternative so i'm very happy with
those
look at alfie right now
go on then what about me
got my new skates on didn't worry
it's just cruising around the house oh
cute i think this is a decoration
but it lights up
how cute is that i think i was just
gonna sit them on the um
mantelpiece actually i think did i get a
couple of those
yeah very glittery
this stuff is really good to go on fire
i bought three of those
i always buy uh my decorations in threes
i don't know about you
i'm not too sure why okay now this was a
slightly extravagant purchase
but i just feel like everyone
who likes a good table setting
needs one of these a proper
fancy
candelabra why does this feel so loose
okay i can tighten it
to put in the middle of the table i
actually wanted two of these
but they only had uh one in stock so
we went with one we could put this in
the middle of the table
and we can put the candles
in the middle how much does this scream
beauty and the beast by the way whenever
i see a candlestick like this i
literally just think of lumiere
ah okay so i bought some new
cutlery and the cutlery that we have
is silver and uh gold and so many of you
ask me where i got that cutlery from
and i bought it from anthropology about
god it must have literally been three
and a half years ago
and i i do remember paying quite a lot
for it and i really liked the fact that
it was gold and silver because i just
thought that's going to go with
everything and it's something a little
bit different
um and i wasn't too sure how well it
would last
because we do put it in the dishwasher
you're probably not supposed to i
thought you know what i'm gonna buy some
more
because i don't often see cutlery that i
really like
um and i saw these and i thought before
the anthropology ones just get
completely ruined i'm gonna buy these
so these were from zara home and the end
is gold
and then the bottom is like a brushed
silver
and it's like a thin i just i just
thought these looked really cool
um so
i feel like alfie will like these as
well do you like these
i'm surprised you did that with the
blinds open
do you like these i bought us some new
cutlery so it's like
nice to hold gold and silver
whoa cool aren't they big aren't they
yeah that's a big old knife i like them
i've got it in a set with like spoons
oh they're nice shaped spoons i like how
round the spoon is
so yeah it's nice little cheese
did you say teaspoon.com that is the
teaspoon but it's such a nice size
the handle is the same size nearly um
oh a couple of tablecloths so i got this
one which i thought was really nice and
festive
something a little bit different um i
don't know if i like it or not
i really like that on the website they
made it look really cool with all the
like gold
stuff um i really like that one yeah and
i suppose it doesn't
it's not just festive like you could use
this all year round
um and then this one which i think will
be the christmas day one
is like a cream with gold stars um
although i didn't actually check the
size so we'll see if this fits on our
table
if not we might have to kind of fashion
some sort of runner or something
okay more charger plates
car they love to wrap stuff in there
another charger plate so we have four of
those
one two three four of those oh
these are so cute
little house ornaments but again i think
oh it lights up
i think i'm just gonna put these on the
mantelpiece
because i just think they're so cute
a little round one how cute are they
whoa this one's big
another little one
oh i bought a little gingerbread
car fragrance oh that smells divine
love that plain
gold pillar candle
some gold dinner
i always call these dinner candles like
the ones that go in the candlesticks
another pillar candle
this feels like a charging place
oh yeah i liked these too these ones are
just plastic
um and i did think i think originally i
liked the one with the stars but they
didn't have many in stock so i thought i
would do
alternate so i'd have like one of stars
one with this
one with stars and mix and match
another one another one
oh um
oh no i think i just broke it
oh that's so funny i pointed these out
to alexia and zara home earlier
not remembering i'd also ordered myself
some
look at this candle it is a christmas
tree
wax candle i think i bought another of
those
this is another one i'm going to leave
it in the box because i don't want to
get glitter everywhere or break it
these are napkin
rings how many of these did i order i
think it's three in a set
so i got six overall one oh no maybe
i've got
one two three four okay well that's
stupid zoe
you ordered four and you have six people
coming
oops um maybe i'll have to do every
other
again um but they're like a plastic
gold leaf and i thought they would be
cool
since we're going for a gold and white
oh hang on was she smarter than she
thought
yes ordered another two
great another four even okay so that's
eight
eight in total fabulous
what does this remind you of oh the
watson and beauty and the beast oh my
god emma watson
no that is in that yeah that's the first
thing this reminds me of emma watson
the beast okay first things first
i got
merry christmas to all
we have got a lot of guests coming
around at the moment so that is
to all four of our guests
for two days for two days no five days
so yeah i've got a doormat
it's actually quite a good size i think
they said that this was quite a large
doormat
i bought some cushion covers uh as i
said yesterday
i already have a lot of the h m
like um cushion inner
cushion cushions um so
i know that these will fit them i bought
some more green i think i might just
pop these on some of the ones we already
have
out that are a bit more autumny or in
the conservatory actually i think that's
probably what i was going to do
so it's like this lovely like velvety
quilted one
and i got two of those i also
got
this one which is a little
festive berry sprig and i got two of
those
i also just got
like a kind of red striped linen
which i thought was also very nice and i
got two of those
as well so i will
change out some of the cushions we have
in the conservatory with those
i can't remember what this is let's have
a look
sport a little oh i think is it green oh
yeah i liked this
it's like a little green glass bars
maybe to put some little little um
christmasy sprigs or some dried flowers
in that
so this is snowflake
paper sort of paper lantern snowflake
bunting
which i thought was nice oh it stinks
yeah someone doesn't smell the best does
it
smell that i don't i can smell it from
here yes
pretty strong yeah um someone queefed in
that box
i think someone shot it
so i got two of those as well i don't
remember what where i had in mind
for the snowflake bunting but
um it would have been for somewhere
specific that i will remember
um and that is everything oh
i also saw these
on instagram heather evelyn
and she had these candles and i just
thought that they were
so cool i will leave a link below
for you to go and check them out
so they're just candles and then
the writing on them says they're like
wrapped up
now bring us some figgy pudding is that
gonna focus there you go
how cute are they to be honest i have a
lot of candlesticks around this house so
we'll find somewhere for them so i got
those ones
and then she also has
these ones that are a
slightly pink hue
and they say it's christmas time
mistletoe and wine a good old bit of
cliff richard
it's christmas time mistletoe and wine
how
cute are they i reckon i'm gonna save
those for actual christmas day
i really love candles but i get so sad
when they're
like burned down especially like the
pillar candles or the dinner
candles because they i just feel like
they burn so
quickly usually leaving a right old mess
on your tablecloth so if anyone has any
tips to
make sure your candles don't drip
everywhere i
would be very interested to hear your
tips that's my little
um home christmasy bits
