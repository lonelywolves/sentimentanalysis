10 sleeps till christmas stroke it
[Music]
no
[Music]
what have you got me there
[Music]
[Music]
good morning everybody and what a
beautiful morning it is
it's such a nice day today i definitely
think it's absolutely chucked it down at
night
but the sun is kind of out
everywhere's looking fresh and green and
um i had a full night's sleep
so did alfie excuse me nola this way
she doesn't want to come outside now
i've got the opposite problem so as i
said in yesterday's video
today is an exciting day because
myself and mark are going to
go to haskins we're driving there
separately i'm going to meet there
um and we're going to have a little look
around the garden center
at all the christmasy stuff and just
get in the festive spirit and i really
do think that this is gonna
be a favorite day of mine because i have
wanted to do this with mark
for so long she's not coming outside
god's sake just it's just nice to feel
fresh
curl my hair as well let's see how long
uh this lasts because i feel like the
air is humid af
come on when i say humid i mean like
um watery what's the word i'm thinking
of misty
excuse me come on
why are you just sitting here
let's go
no no no no you can't go back in come on
hurry up
[Applause]
all right well when alfie gets back if
there's a poo in the conservatory
alf i tried i've tried three times she
won't go
i just know she will go
when i leave i just know it's always the
way
look
these are air drying nicely
they're already pretty hard
they look so good it's my little star
that i copied outfield
i'm excited to paint those okay
i am ready okay i need to pick a song
for the road this feels really sad that
we're not driving there together
this would be when we would have our
christmas tunes on
and we would sing along
but no um what should i listen to
do i want to listen to a podcast do i
want to listen to just christmas music
i think maybe i do i'm gonna listen to
the team zoella's
12 days of christmas playlist
[Music]
also got some crunchy rocks for the
journey
this is what i feared i didn't seal the
bag and we've got a camera bearing in
our fridge and they taste
a tiny bit like the small camera
oh well
[Music]
i'm here i'm at haskins or hay skins as
mark likes to say
i'm here where abouts are you my love
um right so while i wait for mark then
i don't really know what to do ten
sleeps till christmas
is at the 15th 10 more sleeps to
christmas
how did i not know that still got so
much to do
i've still got so many people to buy for
i've still got presents to wrap
i've still got rooms to decorate it's
that pre-christmas stress
all worth it though on christmas eve
when you feel like everything's done
and you can just relax and it's like the
most relaxed you've ever been
you just feel like everything's in its
place everything's in order you can just
chill and look forward to the next day
i'd love to know what day
around the festive period is your
favorite is it christmas eve is it
christmas day or is it boxing day
i actually think i like christmas eve
more do i
i love all three but i think i like
christmas eve
because of the anticipation of christmas
day it's like you're excited all day
and i do feel like on christmas day i
remember as a child
i feel like these vlogs are getting so
nostalgic i'm bringing in all the old
school like
stories but as a child i i kind of
i knew that the day was ticking away
as like sad as that sounds so i would
enjoy christmas eve more as a child i
think because
the excitement was just too much to
handle and then on christmas day i just
felt sad with every hour that passed
especially when it started getting dark
i would be like the day's nearly over
like that's so
sad um boxing day
i love more as an adult than i did as a
child i just feel like boxing day was
really flat as a child because it was
like
now i have to wait another whole year
for father christmas to come back but as
an adult
i love eating all the leftover food i
love just like
lounging around in pajamas watching tv
watching all the films
i just feel like that's rip flipped
more as an adult as i've gotten older i
just i love boxing day more
but i don't know let me know your
favorite
what do you prefer christmas eve
christmas day or boxing day or
rate those three in order of which one
you love the most
i think they're in the order i love them
the most
christmasy christmas eve then christmas
day then boxing day
where is ferris the king
of being late
do we want to go into hobbycraft
maybe i wonder what christmas crafts
they've got in there
i actually have nothing in mind to buy
from the garden center but
i've not been to a christmasy garden
center
this year so it's mostly just for me
to experience the festiveness the
festivities
the festive vibes of a garden center
because
it just doesn't feel like christmas
until you've done that so i'm happy that
we were able to squeeze this in before
the new tier system gets announced i'm
still sad that it doesn't feel the same
i wonder if they have any more elves
this year they didn't have any last year
if we can make it through december then
we can make it to
[Music]
together
with his tail between his legs
your outfit thank you very much i
thought i'm leaving the house i'm going
to make some effort
oh that was a nightmare well we're in
now we can have a good old time give me
that pizza
we're in haskins
this feels festive i like these
i don't need any decorations do you i
think i'm done
oh maybe
you get a little collection yeah do you
want this um
piles decoration i don't like the feel
of them
have you ever had piles i thought i did
oh yeah
did you look oh no you can tell i think
oh
um because i don't really do well with
spicy foods
oh hello about girl and when i had the
new mcdonald's
jerk chicken it was so spicy
i thought oh my god can you imagine if i
got started but did you not
oh it was just a very intense pain
oh my god i sounded so much like him
then you are mike
watch out michael buble michael forblay
is
a foreplay i love those christmas tree
lights which ones
look they're like they've got pink in
do you know how rare pink lights are
that's what i mean
yeah but they make me feel the most
festive for some reason
i don't know what it is it's because it
reminds me of like
pubs in the 90s pubs and like
um churches and like christmas plays at
school
and they all had those like old pink
lights in those foil decorations will be
the deck
definitely i love the foil decorations
bring back foil that's what i say bring
back foil bring back like
just ratty tinsel fairy lights

beetlejuice and they draw a door

feign
fame yeah fame it's like um it's
obviously what they've done for their
book tour but you can
pay to watch them uh do the interview

and uh are just about to tuck into
a dominoes um could you pass me the
i just want to show everybody these

i don't know how dominoes do this oh my
i can't
yeah they are like there's like liquid
orange chocolate in the middle they're
so good
even if i ate these in three hours time
they're still soft in the middle yeah
it's so good what did you go for on
yours
i wanted to tune a sweet corn but at the
moment they're not doing tuna
unfortunately
yeah looking for oh you went veggie
yes you know i've never had that before
yes i don't
get peppers yeah great onions and
everything yes i do
i always go for red onion green and red
peppers and pineapple when i'm going for
a little cheeky
a healthy one yeah getting healthy what
have you got chicken and sweet corn
on a thin and crispy base or italian
base always go
i've gone on a classic base
now you've got to go thin and you want
to go for an extra
garlic and herb dip this is possibly the
best bit of everything
oh and some little chicken things we're
doing celebrating today guys
we are what are we celebrating every day
today
i uh finally after years of
suffering with i feel like they need to
go to your videos
to see like yeah i was gonna say i had a
lot of issues for the last like
six years with my chest and my throat
and i went to go and see like a very
very
very niche specialist today
and i think we got the breakthrough i
had a camera down my nose all the way
down
into my mouth i can't believe you did
that and it i think it's all good
just realized when i was halfway through
eating that pizza that i also had pizza
for lunch
[Music]
so i've just eaten pizza for my two main
meals today
i literally had it for lunch with mark
like five hours ago everything to not
notice you've done that either
i'm not gonna
i could eat pizza for every meal is that
it's the one thing i think i could just
eat
i could if i could change the toppings
i would eat it over and over oh my god
no we're missing a funny bit i'm gonna
rewind it i
just thought i would come on here and
end today's vlog here we're gonna finish
off watching this

makeup and head to bed thank you so much
