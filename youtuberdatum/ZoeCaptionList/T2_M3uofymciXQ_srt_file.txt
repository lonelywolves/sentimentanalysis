i'm gonna go and grab some decorations
and then see what we can do up here
this is the weirdest christmas present
he's ever bought me
this is so cool she's back
good morning everybody it is
monday monday has come around
i'm not gonna lie it feels like i've
already been filming every day for like
a month
i'm so not used to this routine of like
getting up
getting ready editing the day before
making the thumbnail uploading
scheduling sorting out
and still filming so i'm
still trying to work that out so excuse
me whilst i
try and navigate but as i said you know
this isn't going to be a regular vlogmas
because look at me i'm here sat on my
sofa again
guess who's on my lap never far away
little nala
oh why can't i upload that oh import
um and it's already
ten to three alfie's making lunch he's
doing
beans on cheesy beans on toast which
i was really like fancying got the fire
on
i had a nice little catch up with my mum
this morning on
face time which was nice had a shower
washed my hair it was hair wash day so
that took a lot longer
again i didn't bother to curl it because
i just thought i feel like i didn't
blend my
bronzer very well um again i just felt
like
this weather's so unpredictable and it
was so foggy this morning that i just
knew if i spent
like half an hour curling my hair the
second i stepped outside i just knew it
would
just go straight so i've just left it
left it straight went over it with some
straighteners
and just as it is i'm actually so
surprised how quickly
my hair has grown i had it cut
to like hear about
how long ago was that when did sam last
to come and do our hair
two months ago maybe was it november or
was it october i feel like it might have
been october because it was before the
second lockdown and we did obviously
have plans to get our hair done
i want to say this weekend obviously
that's not happening
so the hair is just gonna keep growing
it's gonna keep on keeping on and we'll
see how long it gets
but yeah i'm in two minds about
when january comes around whether i put
my extensions back in or not because i
was
looking back through old was it photos
or videos of this time last year
and i really liked the extensions i
liked the long hair
um and now that my actual hair is a lot
longer i feel like it would just blend
so much more like seamlessly it does
just add a little bit of time to
hair wash day oh my god this looks so
unhealthy
and i can't wait to eat it
this is just what you want on a gloomy
day later on
this evening we are heading to
what's it called it's called
light up trails it's just a trail that
you can walk through outside
full of christmas lights so i'm really
really excited to go along tonight it is
very rainy
so you might have to take some umbrellas
but that's the plan for this evening
in the meantime and actually it's not
too far away i think we're going to be
leaving here in about
an hour and 40 minutes
but in that time i thought i would do
the
kitchen shelving and just to kind of
festive it up a little bit it's still
looking quite autumnal
so i'm gonna do that for you now and
then i think this is gonna be
my first double day vlog because
today has just been admin editing
and the whole day has just run away with
me i don't want to rush or feel like i
have to film things just for the sake of
it
so i'm gonna be putting today's vlog and
tomorrow's footage together
i'm gonna make a start on this shelf and
see how we get on see how christmassy i
can make it i'm gonna have to get some
decorations out
from random places i think and pop them
up
see what it looks like i have no vision
in mind i love doing things like this i
call this pottering
i find it really good for my mental
health if any of you are looking for
something to do
or you feel like you're too in your
thoughts um
i know a lot of people love cleaning for
that and like having something to tidy
and it is that tidy mind tidy tiny house
tidy mind
mindset which i mentioned um in my last
video
pottering or you know thinking okay
these bookshelves have looked like this
for a while let's
change them up a little bit or i'm gonna
rearrange this mantle piece
or i'm going to rearrange this section
of my living room or this section of my
bedroom or change up my desk area
doing little things like that i just
find really therapeutic
and a really nice distraction you're not
kind of
endlessly scrolling through social media
it's something to do but you also feel
really like satisfied and fulfilled when
you're done
it's just a nice feeling isn't it
feeling like you've spruced up a space
and you feel really happy with it
and you're able to like showcase things
that maybe
you had somewhere else that didn't go
or that more people weren't seeing or
you had a really pretty vars that was in
the wrong place and
you moved it somewhere that was a bit
more prominent i don't know whatever it
is
but i really really enjoy doing it so
when it comes to christmas time and
being able to get the decorations out
and decorate certain elements i really
really enjoy it and i know we joked on
day one being like i'm gonna do a rumor
day that's actually kind of what's
happened
because time just disappears and
before you know it it's dark and
it's just not the same decorating when
it's pitch black even though
most of the time it is cute fairy lights
but did the
christmas tree in here yesterday and now
i'm gonna try and do this i have put
some lights up here
they're not the best they're battery
operated and they're not that strong
but because it's suspended in the air i
can't really use
um wired lights because the wire would
just hang down
so we've gone for battery operated i was
saying that
the battery pack just balances here
which also isn't that cute
um but yeah i'm gonna go and grab some
decorations and then see what we can do
up here
i've done most of it the only thing is
that there's a bit of a gap
like here and i don't know what to put
in there i really i think i want to put
a print
in there but i don't have anything
that's like
festive like a little photo frame or
something
i feel like it's missing like a picture
or a photo element but i don't know
i don't know what one to put in there i
don't know if i've got any christmasy
photos anywhere i really need to print
more of my photos that's one thing i
really need to do
maybe i'll make that new year's
resolution but
yeah it's missing something here
and i don't know what so i'm just doing
that thing where i stare at it and think
that it will magically just appear there
i'm gonna go on a little hunt around the
house and see if i can find something to
put there
do you like what i've done with the
place well that looks really cool
yeah yeah i've made it like the whole
thing really
cute in it okay i think i'm done so i'm
gonna give you a little
reveal so
here we have
some little trees um i've kept some
books on here just because it is a
kitchen shelf
and i figured it would give some height
i popped two of the candles that i
featured i think they're by heather
evelyn
um that i featured in my haul and
actually these were in the hall as well
these little light up ornaments i've
just
trimmed the string off them and i'm just
going to use them as decorations rather
than ornaments
so those were h m i honestly could not
tell you where these
candle sticks or candle holders are from
i bought these back in our old house i
think
a couple more of the little trees this
frosted garland is from velvet home in
hove they have really nice garlands and
i got that last year
and then obviously the big habitat
um clock that you all love that i don't
think is currently in stock but
definitely worth checking
um a couple more trees i got this tree
from anthropology
when i said i felt like there was
something missing i added that tree in
and i do feel like it made a difference
i don't remember where this tree was
from basically each year
i try and collect as many of these
little trees as possible because they're
so easy to decorate with
this is also an h m one got an m s
woodland candle and then the green vars
from h
m and some dried
flowers and then i've just kept my
welcome neon which sam and adam bought
me
when it was my birthday or we moved into
this house
can't remember but that's that is my
finished shelf
um and i love it
just getting ready to head out
to
the light trails i actually think it
might be called the light up trails
look i look like this
oh i feel like it's gonna be chilly
today
i'm gonna take my big duvet coat and
also
me and alfie always joke that this is
the weirdest christmas present he's ever
bought me
he bought me these massive boxes of
hand warmers and
toe warmers seemed quite random at the
time
but who's laughing now because i'm
taking these um we're meeting
poppy and sean and steve and alexia
there so that will be nice and i'm going
to bring
extra in case any of them need any
probably should take a pair of gloves as
well just to be on the safe side and an
extra thick
pair of socks
we are here popping shawna here hello
hello it looks really cool
i'm not sure where we're going do we
just go in
i think so it's a little muddier than we
anticipated drinks or anything
did you want a drink guys little i don't
know
a little mulled wine i do oh hi
hey guys merry christmas breakfast
half he's got white trainers on yeah i
don't know why i did that
little mould wine
guys i think this is where something
jumps out
a little angrier naked
this looks so cool
is that a graveyard they're all the
lights oh
it's not halloween it does feel i think
it's the colors it feels quite
halloweeny it's a bit like
questionable yeah it's quite a spooky
song i feel like we need to do a little
light show in our garden alfie
bloody hour okay just me and you yeah
yeah the neighbors would love it i wore
the perfect shoes
i'm so happy with my charge no these are
literally two years old these shoes
me and poppy have got boots sean you got
nice trainers on
these are waterproof these so trendy i
wouldn't even know
where the [ __ ] are we
i'm so confused it doesn't say
like 10 minutes just like this
what lives in there i don't know if it
makes me want to get inside it
not that obviously some freezing but on
the way back
yeah we are here at whiston estate
and we're doing the light up trail i
keep calling a trial i think i've
watched too much i miss
we're here to do a trial guys and each
different
light installation is by a different
person or a different artist
so i think this is going to be quite
cool this is lovely
gorgeous golger
hello alexia hello these stars are so
cute
they're so cute aren't they i bet
they're so satisfying just to
like wind around oh yeah
also you could do loads of different
shapes yeah
oh yes
this is so cool
this is my favorite one my favorite one
yeah already
i think it's because it's like through a
for if it was like an enchanted forest
this is our favorite one
oh
i'm sorry i'm sorry
this morning i mean today has just been
a weird day this morning
we took nala to the vet because she was
having surgery on her leg
she had a growth removed um which is
going to be sent off just
to see if it's anything we should be
concerned about
um which is just gonna be the longest
wait
ever so i'm not gonna lie i've just been
a bit stressed about that
she's so terrified of the vets um she's
been in and out of there
her whole life she's used to being in
the vest but she's had
one or two illnesses where she's been
there for quite a prolonged amount of
time
and since she's since that has happened
she's been really fearful of the vets
and i just
my heart hurts dropping her off because
she
the minute we get to the car park she's
shaking we've not even got out of the
car she just knows where we are
instantly
and then once because at the vets at the
moment there's a covered policy so you
don't go inside you call them at
reception and you tell them you're
outside
and the vet comes out to take the dog in
so you don't actually go in
so once the vet came outside and we were
talking through her
surgery and everything nala
jumped like pulled on the lead jumped
back
in the car and jumped across from the
driver's seat into the passenger seat
and just like
cowered um over like as
far away from me and the vet as possible
and i just
i really i just it breaks my heart
because
i can't explain to her like i'll be
picking you up later
it's gonna be okay like please don't
hate me for bringing you here and
leaving you here
and even today the fact that she's been
in the vet since like 8 30.
and i've been at home on my own alfie's
in the office in town today
it's just so weird not having her around
i really hate it
um so i'm excited that we get to pick
her up in fact i'm going to pick her up
uh
in about an hour i think so yeah i'm
gonna get her back
give her lots of love um and just
smother her in
attention which is just her favorite
thing in the world so
that's been going on i've also just had
like a really awful headache
all day it's just been lingering which
is why i haven't picked my camera up
until now
because i have taken some tablets and
i'm starting to feel a little bit normal
i've put a little bit of makeup on
i'm like okay yeah no i feel i feel a
little better now
so i thought i would just grab my camera
and update you i've got
sugar rush on the new christmas series
which i'm
very very excited to watch i'm now
missing it i'm gonna have to rewind all
of this um i said
did i say it in last year's vlogmas it's
one of my favorite programs
in fact i watch it all year round i love
sugar rush
it's such a great cooking baking show
if you guys love the bake off or any
sort of like baking
show or baking competition you will love
sugar rush is
amazing um so that's on netflix so i've
got that on
i've just done lots of like admin stuff
this morning
been on the phone to poppy um
and also just trying to do a little bit
of last minute christmas shopping
for the girls in the team um
so that's all been done at least i feel
like i've
still been able to be productive even
though i've just felt rubbish
that's where that's where we're at um
i need to open my calendars though i
haven't opened my advent calendars
in a couple of days so i'm gonna go and
grab those now
i'm gonna do seven
from yesterday
little elf i'll pop him to the side
right um
okay and door number eight for today
can you draw santa's sleigh
i could give it a good go what have we
got in here
what the hell is that no idea
i'll eat it anyway and then uh
this is the advent calendar from alfie's
mum and dad
and we did already show this on alfie's
vlog and i know that lots of you went
and purchased it which is incredible
but this is by um an organization
called advent of change and
each day is a different donation that
the money
that you have put towards buying the
calendar
is helping a different cause so a couple
of the ones you've already opened just
as an example
today you have given a delicious meal to
a person who would otherwise have gone
hungry and that's with
um the charity food cycle um
let's see yesterday or the sixth today
you have kept an elderly veteran safe
and warm by helping to heat their home
and that's the army's national charity
um today you have helped give medicine
to a very poorly pet to make them feel
better
that is the pdsa i'm gonna open
yesterday's which is number seven
and that one is today you have helped a
child try their very first vegetable by
teaching their parents all about how
important it is to eat lots of different
healthy food and that's henry healthy
start
brighter future and then today
today you have helped a child who is
deaf become more independent by taking
part in a fun
learning session and that's the national
deaf children society
so it's just a really nice alternative
to a calendar and
i also showed the crackers that i have
bought let me go and get them just in
case you haven't seen alfie's vlog
same um non-profit organization
have made these and they actually sent
me some
um but i went and purchased them myself
because i wanted to feel like i was
actually like
helping rather than just sharing it with
everybody but um so i bought these ones
me and amanda were talking about how
with crackers like
they're not great for the environment
they're one of those traditions that
you can't you don't really want to get
rid of because it's such like a
christmas day thing um well especially
for us anyway
but you never want what's in it like
i don't know they're just one of those
things that you
get but there's not really any like
meaning behind it it's not it's not like
you really want what's in it um and so
when i noticed that they'd sent me these
i thought these were such a great idea
so they're plastic free
um and over 80 of proceeds are
donated to charity this non-profit
project supports 24 different charities
with jokes supplied by a network of
celebrity supporters
so inside there is a paper crown
there is a joke supplied by the
celebrity which i'm excited to see what
jokes are in there
and then a charity donation so and it
says repurpose the recyclable ribbons to
proudly display this on your tree
um so yeah this was such a lovely idea
so
every time you pull a cracker it it
shows you the charity that you have
helped
by buying the crackers which i just
think especially
after the year we've had um a nice
just a much nicer thing for crackers you
know
this countdown to pick nala up is just
excruciatingly long
i just want her now it's time to get
narla
i've got a little blanket for her i'm
just so excited to see her
i can wait it's flipping freezing today
let's get the heated seats on oh
i think it's like three degrees
so we are cold do you know what i'm
gonna put a christmas radio station on
no there's no
christmas radio station this year
we've already had a rubbish enough yeah
oh never mind
i'll just put christmas music on my
spotify
santa baby she's back
hello you okay
look at her little bandage
oh the vet said they made it
to match her harness as much as possible
which is just the cutest thing ever
i think she's still sort of getting used
to it it's quite big isn't it baby
it doesn't feel like your leg i think
you need to come up here
she's attempting to sort of walk on it
but
i think you're a little bit spaced out
still aren't you come up here look
she's doing that thing where she sort of
hates me
because i was the one that took her and
i was the one that picked her up so i
think she feels
a bit betrayed by me which makes me sad
unless she's still just a little bit out
of it from
from the anaesthetic but come on let's
have a little lie down
come on that's it that's it
that's it sit down that's it
good girl you upset me
i'm sorry it was not my idea
i very quickly worked out she couldn't
get comfy down there
and any time i left the room she tried
to follow me
dragging her little leg behind her and i
just i don't know how much she should be
walking on it i think they said it was
safe for her to walk on it or to drag it
um but i realized if i didn't just sit
down and let her sit on me
she would she just wouldn't lie down and
she want i think she's worried i'm gonna
leave her
um so i sat down on the sofa put
everything i need around me
and now she's finally lying down
with her leg stretched out this way so
it looks like this is where i'm going to
stay for the rest of the evening
thankfully i've got my remote got my
phone got my camera
and alfie's just gonna have to sort
dinner out because
i don't think i'm going anywhere now so
we're just gonna sit here now
and watch sugar rush and chill i'm gonna
see if she'll have a little snooze
once she's comfy i think
