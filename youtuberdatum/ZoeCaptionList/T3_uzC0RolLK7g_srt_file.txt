morning everyone i'm vlogging today i
don't know why i love starting my vlogs
in this bedroom
i think it's the lighting it's very nice
you can sit at the window
as you can see i've done my hair and my
makeup and i've actually
i've made an effort today oh this
radiator is very hot
should i give you a little bump update
bump is getting
getting there
do you see
well as you're watching this i'll be
i'll be over halfway now which is
just crazy
the first bit just seems to go so slowly
and then
before you know it you're halfway and
you're like how
how's that happened and i can only
imagine and in fact i do remember maddie
saying this to me
that the last bit just goes
apart from the very last bit which she
said just felt like it really dragged
that this bit just goes really quickly
and
i agree it's going very very quickly
also where i still haven't done my first
trimester video i will do that
but amy and i have handed in
the first manuscript for the magpie
society two for joy which
obviously i am ecstatic about because
that was
one project that basically consumed me
for the start of the year that
and creating a baby and uh
now that we've done the first draft i
just feel
a little bit more like free creatively
i will definitely at some point this
week sit down
film that video and it will be coming
out shortly after this one so
don't worry it's coming and i'm sorry
it's taking me so long
it's a good job i actually made notes on
it on my phone because
the further away i get from it the less
i really remember of it it's so strange
when you're in it it just feels like
this huge
thing that you're constantly thinking
about and like now that i'm in my second
trimester
i'm already kind of forgetting what the
first trimester was like
so thankfully i have a lot of very
detailed notes on my phone which i made
like
on a week by week basis so
i can sit down and do that what else can
i update you on whilst i'm sat here by
my window that i like to sit by
alfie and i still haven't really bought
much especially not in the way of like
bigger items
we've definitely got a lot of really
cute like clothes and like blankets
none of those things are really kind of
like i mean clothing is
kind of practical but um you know in
terms of like
the bigger items uh we were really kind
of
waiting until we could
go into an actual shop growing up i
don't know about you
but whenever i was in like a department
store and you'd like walk through the
baby section and you'd see people like
testing the prams and like
lifting things like oh how heavy is this
car seat what does it do
i would always be so excited for the day
that i could do that
and obviously because of lockdown and
the shops the non-essential shops
have been shut until last week week
before
so once those had opened up alfie and i
were like
okay well now we can like go to the
shops and actually
push some push chairs around and kind of
get a bit more of like a physical
feel for things so we are going to plan
a day where we can
go and push some push chairs around
which i'm really excited about in terms
of like bigger more practical items
we have nothing but we have some cute
clothes
she's gonna she's gonna look cute but
yeah
all is well um let me know how you are
in the comments as always and how your
week's been how have you found
the world opening up a little bit if
you're here in the uk anyway oh that's a
massive fee
as i said from the 12th of april the
shops were open
and you can eat outside in restaurants
with two households or six people
and i feel like
yeah everything is starting to feel a
little bit more like
okay it's opening up but i know that a
lot of people have quite mixed
quite mixed feelings on it this time
last year when everything started
opening up i actually found
that really hard adjusting from it
being just me and alfie um and
having quite a structure in our day and
okay this is how life is now
to all of a sudden like oh wait yeah i
guess we can go and meet these guys for
brunch somewhere like i found that
really weird but this time around i
don't think i'm putting
as much pressure on myself and i'd love
to know how you guys are finding it
like are you finding it harder than you
thought
are you not wanting to go anywhere um
have you found yourself feeling more
anxious now
the first time i went into a supermarket
because alfie and i had been doing
online food shops
i actually had to leave because i felt
like panicked
so yeah there's no right or wrong don't
push yourself
don't feel like because your friends are
inviting you to something that you have
to go
i feel like a lot of people will
probably feel that pressure of like
we can now so i should but you should
still only do
things that you feel comfortable and
happy doing so if you needed that
reminder
then you're welcome still trying to
drink
my huge
two liters a day one thing that i
thought was really funny was in the last
vlog
so many of you said that my voice was
different
i was like really i
haven't noticed that and no one around
me has noticed that so i don't
know i feel like it was because
when i vlog i speak a lot
and i think my voice gets tired very
quickly
and i'm not used to it because of being
in lockdown and only really speaking to
alfie but also going three months where
speaking made me feel sick so
i think i just i think my voice box is
just a little bit out of action or
something but
i don't know do i sound different is
that a pregnancy thing i don't know
i've made a hair appointment i'm very
excited about it i'm gonna get the old
stenies although i have to say i do
quite like this link this has grown a
lot
i don't know if any of you remember but
i cut my hair to like here
in 2018 i think
i had something new in my shower today
which
i'm excited to share with you as you
guys know i have worked with function of
beauty
for two years now which is
mind-blowing um it's the only shampoo
and conditioner i
ever use whenever you see my hair or
whenever i get questions on like what do
you wash with
your hair with what do you use on your
hair how does your color look so good
how do you maintain it like that
it's always function of beauty
for any of you that might be new or
don't know about function of beauty
function of beauty is a fully
customizable hair care brand so you can
choose
your hair goals and by taking the quiz
on their website you can
get a completely tailored customizable
shampoo and conditioner for your hair
and what you want to get
from the shampoo and conditioner lots of
you always ask me what mine
is so my profile is wavy medium and
normal
and my goals are anti-frizz oil control
replenish hair
shine and thermal protection you can
choose the
colors of your formulations the
fragrances of your formulations you can
get your names put on the bottles
also over those two years it's worth
pointing out i've had both extensions
knot extensions really bleached hair
barely bleached hair and function of
beauty has
always worked so well so
it can completely change and adapt as
life changes and adapt or your hair
changes and adapts
if you get more color in it for example
you can add and change your goals to
reflect that or i mean it's totally up
to you so the reason i was so excited to
wash my hair this morning was because
they have
just sent me their new fragrance it's a
limited edition fragrance for spring
and it is the mango fragrance
oh my god it smells amazing i always
opt for the strongest fragrance level
um but you can adjust that as well which
i think is really cool because some
people
don't want too much fragrance in their
hair whereas
i'm just like you give me all the
fragrance i i love it i love being able
to like
swish my hair and smell it the actual
fragrance is called takes two to mango
my normal go-to fragrance for function
of beauty is the peach one so
i'm definitely more of a like
fruity scent person when it comes to
hair and body
um so when they said that this was going
to be one of their new fragrances i
think it's one of their like
highest rated fragrances this one
and i can see why because it smells
incredible this would be
such a nice like holiday smell
obviously if we could go away on holiday
i loved it i absolutely loved it the
bottles are still a little bit wet
because i
i just grabbed them out of my shower to
show you but they also come with these
really
adorable stickers which i have not stuck
on my bottles yet because
i was i basically just pulled them
straight out of the box and ran
straight into the shower and as always
no sulfates no parabens and the
formulations are cruelty free
and 100 vegan as well so if you
haven't tried functional beauty before
or you're just hearing about them for
the first time
or you just want to try the new spring
fragrance
then i will leave my discount code down
below in the description box
you get 20 off your order um i
highly highly recommend it as always
there's a reason i've been using these
haircare products for two years
i love them i recommend them to
everybody um so yeah go and check it out
also worth pointing out they do other
hair care products as well they also do
body care products
and a shower gel um but
i use this hair serum after i've done my
hair
smooth what the hell is that
um just to smooth any flyaways
and give my hair
a gorgeous glossy finish
so i'm basically done for the day now
since being pregnant
i don't make as much effort i say since
being pregnant
probably has something to do with the
fact that we were in a lockdown too
i just haven't been making as much
effort
with my hair and makeup and i actually
had a little bit of a makeup clear out
um over the weekend and
it made me rediscover so many
kind of products that i'd bought or been
sent
that i was like i haven't tried that yet
um so it has kind of reignited
like i've used like a nars palette
on my eyes this morning instead of the
usual um
brown matte brown shade that i had been
wearing
um for like five months i am actually
heading to poppy's garden for like an
hour
just to see her i realized i hadn't been
in poppy's garden
since last like the end of summer last
year i think
um so i said to her like oh what are you
doing this afternoon
i might pop over and just see you just
say hi
pop in so my plan for this vlog is to
film some clips today
and kind of update you all on like baby
bits and what i've been up to
and then i actually filmed lots of
footage
when i first saw mark that was a couple
of weeks ago
but i hadn't gotten around to editing it
so i was like oh
like everyone's gonna want to see that
so i'm gonna put that
at the end of this vlog so that you guys
can also watch that as well because
that was such a lovely day i'm back from
pop and sean's garden
it was so nice we got a oaxaca delivery
which was delicious and we played card
games
and sat in the garden and it was so
lovely it's actually much less windier
at poppy insurance than it is at ours
so it felt really warm and like like we
were on holiday
little outfit of the day i am wearing
this cardigan which i actually got
years ago i feel like it's from is it
topshop yeah it's a topshop one
and then this dress which i got
last summer from um
urban outfitters and i love it
i feel like the bump looks big today it
might be because i've just eaten
so i'm either gonna go and sit in the
garden for a bit or
should probably um go through some of my
emails and just
double check there's nothing like super
urgent work wise to do
amy and i are starting on our second
drafts
now so probably do need to be getting on
those
but for now i'm gonna finish my innocent
smoothie
and flick through my emails one thing
that is
very new since
like 10 days ago is that i can now
feel baby kicking
moving squirming rolling
elbowing whatever it is she's doing in
there
and head butting and
i started feeling it and i was like whoa
like right now she's doing something
what is she doing kicking downwards
she's kicking down into my bladder as
well which is a
feeling i've never felt before i wish i
could know what it feels like
i know i wish i could put it inside you
just for like 10 like just for 10
minutes for you to feel what it feels
like from the inside
you usually feel really confident i love
it
like already you said yesterday i'm
gonna miss when i don't feel this yeah
i love it i love it i mean i feel like
some people are gonna be watching this
like just you wait
wait till it's your rib or like wait
till it's like
there's been a few that have been so
hard
that it's made me like like almost took
my breath away and i was like whoa
because it's like it's just such a
bizarre feeling
don't know when it was that i first it
was after a cake pop do you remember
i had a cake pop and i said to you i
feel like i can feel
for a couple of days i kept saying to
alfie like i think i can feel movement
but i'm not sure
because i know it was that it was about
week 18.
i know that a lot of people do feel
movement like quite early and lots of
people had said that to me
but i didn't want to get confused with
like gas bubbles
and like feel silly so for a while i
kept saying to you didn't i like
i don't know if it is or isn't but it
kind of feels like it could be but it's
probably just
especially at first it's more like
little flutters rather than
i can't really see you yeah
it was at first i said to alfie it felt
like um
like a little like pins and needles but
like from the inside very quickly
and then i was like okay no i definitely
felt something after i'd had a cake pop
and then i swear literally the next
day i said put your hand on my tummy
yeah it was
the next day and alfie felt alfie felt
it that was
that was so annoying because we so
nearly got it on camera
but we didn't she's currently kicking
which is the first time i've ever felt
it just now
i can feel
it's every time i eat a cake pop
she loves the cake pops
and then we i sat on the floor and it
was like whoa i felt that and then it
was
it was literally like the first one was
like a little swipe across the stomach
and then the second one was just
straight like punch it
like it was like yo i'm in here and now
we're just like and now she doesn't stop
but also we can see it like i wonder if
we'll be able to get one on camera
i've tried so many times today
yeah but you can see my whole like
vagina yeah that's not the best because
she was kicking solo down yesterday
so exciting i love it which
i just want to throw out and say that
you didn't think you would like
like for those of you that are i thought
i would find it very claustrophobic
early early pregnant zoe thought that
she would find it yeah like
oh my god there's something you mean i
can't stop it and i like do you know
what i mean yeah
we struggled that a lot of times and now
you're like i don't want it to stop
i know and even now i'm like i'll think
like oh she hasn't done it in a while
today she's been the most active
ever i feel like she's hardly stopped
usually she would only kick if i had
something quite
either cold water or something really
sugary
and then i knew she would like kick
about but today i was just driving in
the car
and she was going crazy and i was like
i'm
like normally i i wouldn't be feeling
her it's normally when i'm lying down
or like when i wake up in the morning or
if i
stop then i can feel it
um but today it's just been constant
even when i'm walking around i can i can
feel when she like
goes for it even in one of our first
ultrasounds
he was like an active little monkey
well he didn't know it was a she then
did he so he was like oh
um it's an active little monkey or
you've got an active little monkey or
something because in every scan
she was like upside down then she would
flip then she would roll around
she never stayed still on a scan and i
did think at the time
what will that feel like when she does
that but it is so
like i could just sit and like feel it
all day i love feeling it it blows my
mind that she's
literally still so
young and you can feel that like she's
still so small kind of thing and we
could
see it from outside you can see i in
fact i pulled my dress up earlier and i
can see it
i'm telling you she is ready for all the
activities she's going to be energetic
and strong
she's going to be bouldering this is
probably going to come out very slowly i
reckon within the first couple of weeks
she'll be on the mini ramp
oh skating anyway also nala was lying
like this
across my tummy which she likes to do
this morning and she was kicking where
nala was i think
probably if nala actually gave a
she would have been like what was that
but i could like stick my hands
underneath nyla now and nudge her and
she's
not really first so i don't think she
was at all phased but she was kicking
underneath nala this morning
just wait until it's like an actual foot
poking through your stomach i know i
can't wait oh someone's drinking
something someone's bringing me
so alfie and i have whoa
um just put some warmer clothes on and
we're gonna head to the beach sure i
don't have a coat
oh well i don't have time so we've come
to the beach
for sunset with these two
hello hello we've got kevin mcallister
this is what he does when it's not
december he resides in brighton
i get cold really easily same thing
i feel like our suggs just are always
cold
i don't get to my toes my fingers oh
mine
and alfie who didn't bring a coat as
well
i feel like i got it in the car and i
just left it food has arrived we sat at
rock water
wow look at that pizza the boys have
gone for chicken and chorizo
look at that pizza look at that look at
here
your eyes look so blue yeah they do
actually
i think it's the light to mind yeah
the mine looks really blue i think
that's what it is
it's this light and yours
it's like we're back
i didn't film too much because there was
a lot of people around it was freezing
cold
and i just wanted to keep my hands in
my jacket pocket to be honest um but it
was so
so nice just being like out
and watching the sunset having drinks i
had my sprite i was hanging out
joe and diane had a great time yeah it
was really really nice
and back now and i need to
defrost because it got cold quick the
minute that sun went down
and the wind picked up oh my god
it was freezing so i'm running myself a
quick bath
gonna get in lather myself in oil
and jump into bed as i said earlier i
have the
footage from when mark came over so i'm
gonna insert that now
enjoy hope you love it and um
i'll see you again soon good morning
hello everybody i'm seeing mark for the
first time in
since october no that's a lie since
december
when we went to the garden center that
was the last time
i saw him that was during vlogmas when
he uh
drove into a hedge instead of reverse
backwards
stay safe
so that was the last time i've seen them
so i do actually think
well it's nearly april now so that's
three whole months i feel like
that's the longest we've ever since
being friends
haven't seen each other unless last
unless last year this time when we first
went into lockdown was also around the
same amount of time but still
it feels like a lifetime and i'm really
really excited to see him he's popping
over this afternoon into the garden
and thankfully it is the most wonderful
day so we can just sit out there
catch up chat we have no plans apart
from just
catching up and seeing each other before
he arrives though
i have told myself that i will write
a chapter so that's what i'm about to go
and do now
i'm actually gonna put the umbrella up
outside i think and sit at the table
outside
and see how much i can get done before
he arrives
sat outside and i have just finished
um another chapter so i'm really happy
about that and i've still got
50 minutes until mark arrives so i'm
going to
start on another one this by the way
is my attempt at
trying to drink more water i'm really
bad at drinking water i always have been
i think i'm just
a walking talking dehydrated person at
all times i think
my body is just used to it being
pregnant i have to make sure i'm
drinking
as much water as i should be drinking
which is between
1.5 and 2 liters a day this is a 2-liter
bottle
i got this on amazon it's my new
favorite thing ever
has a really big straw a handle like a
handle here
a handle here a handle here but

this white like waxy stuff on them
okay and that's called the baby cheese
okay
which of these can you not do now that
you're pregnant
okay a shave your bikini line
b have sex
c pick stuff up or d
be emotionally stable i can't show you
your purse you can't shave your butt
can still do all of these things but you
get to use pregnancy as an excuse
to not do any of them oh
that's a treat so don't worry i can
still shave my bikini line
three speaking of sex what's the best
position
when pregnant is it a doggy
mission he's confident with that one oh
my god
missionary doggy that thing where you
both lay on your side that never
actually works
or the depth of my not caring is
infinite dj
doggy three whatever sexual position is
comfortable for you is a-okay
even if said position is get off you're
making life do what you want girlfriend
what is the afterbirth oh i know that oh
is it the umbilical cord yep the
placenta
the excess fluid that's still in your
body for a couple of weeks after you
have the baby or
d the part where someone brings you some
wine see
the excess fluid that's the afterburner
yeah
technically the after birth is b the
placenta
oh once you have a baby yeah you've then
got to give birth to the placenta
so that could happen any day after your
it happens straight after oh straight
after yeah
any day any day now that i drop out
did you learn anything well yeah i know
baby cheese is called veenay
veenay vernix fur next a little bit
later
it's about 3 45
and mark has just offered to
nip to mcdonald's and get us
a little cheeky snack
slash early dinner but this is my time
of day
where i just have this tiny niggling
little bit of nausea left
it's about half three to five i still
just don't feel great
um so mark was like
i'm gonna go and get some mcdonald's and
i was like oh god i love you
um and the one thing actually that
has curbed my nausea
through the first trimester and now
just at this time of day is a sprite
this is actually a no sugar sprite
but it's just i think it's just like the
sweet fizzy-ness of it
i don't actually know so while he's gone
to mcdonald's i'm gonna lie down
and i'm gonna sip my sprite which is
also what i had to do yesterday
so funny that's just the one little
thing it just at this time of day
i don't even have to check what time it
is it's like i know
from how i feel i'd be like oh somewhere
between half three and four because i'm
feeling
nauseous um hopefully
that doesn't last much longer every day
it's
less and less um
sicky but
i'm just gonna lie down
and think of the chips
which also has been one of my
um not cravings but
usually if you ask me what's the best
part of a mcdonald's
i would say to you the burger or you
know
the chicken nuggets oh burpee because
i'm drinking sprite
the chips are never my go-to since being
pregnant
all i want to eat is chips chips and dip
sweet chili dip and curry sauce dip and
just the mcdonald's chips
just oh can't wait
cannot wait never no
songs around the campfire it was all
yellow
look at the stars
look allies i was hoping you'd see them
in the camera but i don't think
you can and every little thing you do
they're all yellow yellow yellow
when to go a what a wendigo what's that
it's like humans are if they eat each
other they turn into a windigo
whoa if you google it complain this game
call until dawn
basically it's a myth in certain areas
if you eat a person whilst they're still
alive
but kill them you turn into a wendigo
oh do you hear that nails yes
campfire stories tell your worst ghost
story
this is lovely what a beautiful day it's
been
i know we've had so much fun i've loved
seeing you i love seeing you more
no here he is what have you gone for a
bowl of cereal
just spent so long in there trying to
find something good to eat
we have nothing oh no be careful you're
going to cook yourself
so what have you gone for a bowl of
cereal
to be fair that's the best kind of
dinner i think
i hear people i know it's only because
i'm so used to hearing like crazy
amounts of people
and then when i come here i'm like i
shouldn't be hearing that
mark's off so nice to see you my love i
mean i like the last time i said goodbye
