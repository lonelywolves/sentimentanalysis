i thought it was going to be like
massive perfectly round little
tubby robin cute hello

very cute we are heading to a pick your
own
going to round stone pick your own which
we go to every year
you don't always come do you i'm not the
biggest fan
of all the activities in the world it's
not the most
thrilling for me usually i go with mark
where we go pumpkin picking but we're
going a bit earlier
this year um just because
oh you bloody scared it by doing that oh
poppy and sean are going and they asked
us if we wanted to go
and we just thought it'd be nice to get
outside get some fresh air
and it'll be a nice thing to do socially
distanced like i feel like being out in
fields picking fruit is quite
wholesome fun
you're outside and also
i just feel very autumnal today you may
notice
i am wearing an oversized jacket
so is alfie you've also got the
oversized we accidentally matched didn't
we and
only match i prefer yours
do you actually looks way better than
mine yeah mine is zara
this year i literally bought it the
other day and it said it was gonna be
windy and a bit cloudy also quite warm
so i've literally got like the smallest
top on underneath
and then i've just thrown this on top
pair of jeans i'll do a little outfit of
the day when we get there but i am kind
of digging my outfit because autumn
fashion for me
is my favorite that is your one isn't it
it's my favorite your feed
autumn fashion pop off on easter
i love layering i love the transitional
like oh let's throw a jacket over that
oh this is a nice kind of summery
springy outfit but let's throw some
boots with that and let's put a jacket
on top
and you do do good boots and then a
little beanie in case it rains
i just i love autumn fashion what's your
favorite time of year for dressing
my favorite to wear is summer because i
like just throwing for me
literally shorts and a tea is so easy
yeah
um and then i only have to focus on the
top because obviously shorts are like
shorts but favor to actually wear
probably winter oh i'm a big fan of like
hoodie
like now if i could wear a hoodie
underneath this with this phone on top
and having the hood come out
that's my favorite but it's just too hot
at the moment yeah still too i like
layering
i like layering so we are going to head
to roundstone and i'll see you when we
get there
[Music]

that was on
instagram why don't you find it and do
it i should do that
mine was so there's like this flow chart
that
um i actually saw somebody doing
instagram and i sent it straight to mark
because obviously mark is like a huge 1d
fan
and it makes you like choose like
favorite songs out of songs between two
songs between two songs between two
between two between two but you can
choose them i think
so you know maybe you don't maybe it
starts with ones they've picked and then
you funnel them through

extended the wrong way
sand um one minute is the point of the
game
to say it quickly yes or to keep
repeating the words
it could be to do with sand right
beginning with d is that right
um i'm taking the piss dig you know i
said that yeah because it took
so long and you're going oh sand um
dig oh why does it begin with d the the
last letter of the word sound

what the hell's to do with dig that
begins with g okay let's not do

just got home and you know how today's
theme has been
windy af i've got two sunflowers growing
in my garden this year
they are now on the ground
oh i literally i took a picture of this
one yesterday
but this big one what do i do it hasn't
even come out yet
it was literally just about to come out
should i just attach it to this
oh that's so sad what will we do nala
that's so sad look look at my sunflower
oh [ __ ] no
oh no i'm gonna attach it well it's just
sort of split
so i'm just gonna see if i can attach it
to this
do you think
this one i might just cut and put enough
i might just cut this one
oh i don't know how you would get that
just stay up really can't i attach it to
this bamboo
oh no that that'll pull the bamboo down
will it
how deep in is the bamboo pretty deep
that's the one because now it's attached
to the bamboo
he's pretty in there he's that bamboo's
been up these two together
this sunflower still blooms are we very
surprised
this one's okay well he's blooming now
he's blooming gorgeous there we go
see that no i think that whole thing
would have to come down though no i
think you can just snap these
we could always i guess we can't really
we'd have to get a piece of string to
tie to there
we could type it if you want me to now
we could
watch this are you going to make a
paper chain yeah
this looks lovely look at that
do you need one more
that's not going anywhere
now try and fall over
oh my god the only thing that might
happen is that it goes even taller and
then the top bits got nice
support yeah we've got no support when
it gets up there
look at it that is a long sunflower too
we didn't actually intentionally um
i was gonna say so these grow these
um i think it was a couple of seeds from
the sunflowers that i planted along here
last year
i don't know if you remember i planted
six
um me and each of alfie's family members
had one each and my mum had one
uh and i think some of the sunflower
seeds from those
just got chucked in here and two
sunflowers came from them
