two glittery arse cheeks on the bottom
of this bath
kind of like a little owl look at this
dog
i just can't see anything is that sexy
single ladies
oh sorry absolutely
good morning it's day three and i've
spent this morning
editing and that's it
have my breakfast and today we are
blessed
with
torrential rain so because of that
i was like right instead of just jumping
in the shower
and getting ready as quickly as possible
i don't need to do that today
so i'm gonna have a mid-morning
bath and i'm gonna thoroughly enjoy it
and
i'm going to have a proper pamper
i've got a couple of little spots um
some are going down
i woke up with a blackhead on my lip
now let me tell you that was painful i'm
gonna run a bath
i'm gonna shave my legs use a really
nice
body scrub and i'm gonna like
fully make the most of it instead of
just like rushing in the shower and i'm
gonna do a face mask
as well so the face mask i'm gonna do
is a one one skin face mask
these are pricey
um i basically treated myself a couple
of weeks ago and ordered
some anti-blemish biocellulose
facial masks in a pack of i want to say
five
but i like these because there's a top
half and a bottom half
we all know i have a p
head so sheet masks and my face
don't tend to get on so well not really
a match made in heaven but when you can
have a bottom part of a mask and a top
part of a mask
much better i'm gonna put some vlogmases
on in the background
me and mark were talking about this
yesterday because he was telling me his
list of vlogmases that he is gonna watch
when he wakes up every morning
and usually when i'm doing vlogmas i
find it really hard to keep up with
other people's vlogmases
if i'm watching anyone's in particular
so usually when i get like my christmas
bug
in like spring summer
by that i don't mean ill i mean like
when i get like an
itching to be excited about christmas um
i will watch people's vlogmases from
december then
kind of like back to back i'll just like
binge watch the whole thing because
they're all already there
but while i'm in my bath and i'm having
my little pamper
i'm gonna pop some vlogmases on well
let's start by running the bath shall we
and then i think i'll start deciding on
what scrub i want to use
and i'll keep you updated on my pamper
concoction do you know what's funny
i had a bath in here what night was it
it was
the first so two nights ago not last
night but the night before
and i'd used a bath bomb that was kind
of glittery and i forgot to like rinse
the glitter out
and you can see my ass cheeks
like two glittery ass cheeks on
the bottom of this bath i can't say it
looks too flattering i'm not gonna lie
so
so
so i was about to get in the bath and
then i thought no actually have i got a
top under this yeah
let's take one top off so i was about to
get like fully naked and get in the bath
and then i was like no do you know what
i'm gonna try and put this on
whilst i'm filming and then attempt to
take this off
afterwards oh there's a lot of juice in
there
right so this is the top bit
wow this is wet oh my goodness
it's dripping everywhere do this over a
sink
these things always confuse me right
now i think i place this on here
oh my goodness it's very cold i look
like a little owl
and then i think there's also another
layer take that off
okay there's the top done smell of this
really reminds me of something and i
swear i said this in my other video with
mark it was a different
one one um mask
they just all remind me of like
fragrances i wore as a teenager
this one smells different but it still
smells like a fragrance i wore as a
teenager
there we go okay
okay that's spilling everywhere how long
do i leave this on for
20 minutes okay
see you after the bath out the bath
feeling fresh
um it's not a hair wash day so
we've gone for a little slick back pony
might even put it into a little bun
not sure yet i feel like it's gonna be
all in the makeup because
i i mean i feel like that face mask
actually
has made me feel a little bit more fresh
in
the face um but just quickly before i
carry on getting ready for the day i've
just put my deodorant on and got dressed
and
i thought this would be a great segue
into
talking to you about native's new
plastic
free deodorant so as you know i have
worked with native
across this year and absolutely loving
their deodorant not only their deodorant
actually
this isn't part of um the sponsorship
that i'm doing with them
but i also use this
like every day and it's their shower gel
but i will get to this scent in a second
because it's also
it's also the fragrance of the deodorant
that i'm currently using so as i said
native have a new plastic free so zero
plastic
deodorant and it looks like this this is
actually in the
this is in the scent candy cane this is
one of their festive scents which smells
incredible
native is also a proud partner of one
percent for the planet and they commit
one percent of
sales of the plastic free deodorant
to environmental nonprofits which is
also very cool
like all their deodorants they are vegan
cruelty free and they are free of any
parabens
any sulfates and also free of aluminium
so one of the reasons that i love
working with native but also love using
native and getting to recommend it to
you
is that it works for me so well
i love it i love all the fragrances they
have i love
all those things i just listed the fact
that it just
feels like i'm doing something great for
my armpits
it's not sticky it dries really quickly
um although it is worth noting that it
does take a couple of weeks for you to
get used to it
so if you have been umming and aring
about whether to try a more natural
deodorant or to give native a go and
you've seen me mention this in a couple
of videos but you haven't taken the
plunge yet
i do have a discount code which i will
leave in the description box below
simply click the link and using code zoe
3 will get you 30 off your
plastic free pack if you need any help
deciding on any fragrances
a couple of my favorites are the
blood orange and clove that's the one
that i also have in
the shower gel this one smells like
christmas
i love it a firm classic favorite that i
use most of the time
is the cotton and cedar wood i love this
one candy cane
smells divine and a couple of other
festive scents are
sugar cookie and vanilla and chai which
they've sent to me in these little
testers so that i could smell them
as i said i will leave the link below
along with the code
and if you fancy it head on over
give it a try let me know what you think
time to sort my face out
i'm gonna pop a little bit of vitamin c
serum on
i do apologize for the lighting my
everyday
go-to makeup that i've been doing
recently
is nothing that new from anything i
have been kind of sharing in the last
couple of months or half a year
still loving my bare minerals still
loving my collection
um concealer and as i said i need to
sort my makeup out i need to see what
i've got
i need to have a big clear out and i
need to
get experimenting a little bit i
actually did wear much heavier eye
makeup yesterday
if you noticed um but
generally i stick to i stick to
the same old i'm so boring oh we need to
put some
moisturizer on
embryolisse blackram concentrate
just a tiny bit it's quite a i wouldn't
say it's a heavy moisturizer but
it does a good job let that sink in for
a second
you know what i might go for like a
golden eye
and a berry lip today
what do we think
got this too faced melted
matte liquified matte longwear lipstick
in the shade drop dead red
and or do i go for an actual red
a gold and a red lip it's a bit more
festive isn't it
nasty girl let's do that i'm gonna go
for a red
this is very cool red i might do this
one this is hot stuff
i also have this one which is candy cane
i basically really love these melted
mattes
uh those and the tarte
liquid lip formulas are my favorite
collection
i would say my skin is is actually
really clear
everywhere else except where
i have spots
i don't know whether that's kind of a
contradiction but
i know what i mean i used to get quite
bad marking and scarring
but i would say anywhere i don't have a
blemish
or a pimple or like a mark from a pimple
my skin is like now i've covered up
like certain areas the rest of my skin
is very clear
just need to get those little
marks gone
that do then i go in with a bit of bare
minerals faux tan
oh my goodness the rain
i'm just gonna
lightly dust
not that you can really see anything
right now because we have the worst
lighting in the world a little bit of
this this is the
natasha denona bloom highlighting blush
it's a really pretty like peachy pink
and it has a little bit of a glow about
it
we don't want too much because we're
going for a red lid right
a little bit of nars wanted
one palette and this is the highlighter
that i
have completely obliterated in this
and it's called unlimited
a bit of that for a healthy glow i don't
know where none has gone
there we go right
now i'm going to do me brows using the
same
thing i always use at the moment which
is the dipbrow pomade in medium brown
i'm gonna have to clean up really close
right now to do this
one that looks terrifying
there we go i feel like it's getting
darker by the second
um now i'm using a little bit of the
hourglass arch fiber gel in warm
brunette which i don't think is my color
but it's the one i'm currently using
just to give the hairs a bit of
definition
don't know about you but i'm still very
proud of myself for
growing out my over plucked sperm brows
from my early 20s
oh dear me i'm gonna use
this palette which is the anastasia soft
glam palette
and looks like this one of them arrived
smashed which i was
a little bit sad about i should probably
just put a bit of vodka in there and
press it down but
i'm not too sure i'll be any good at
doing it okay
i'm going to use a little bit of fairy
which is a nice champagne
gold i don't really wear this color on
my eyelids much i normally go for quite
a warm
tone now a little bit of a
brown in the crease i really feel like
watching a christmasy film today
i think it's the rain when me and alfie
woke up this morning it was still
so dark outside that it completely threw
us off we were like what the hell is the
time
okay there we go i'm gonna put a little
bit of
the same colors underneath mascara
is the one i've been using for a couple
of months now it's the hourglass
unlocked instant extensions mascara
i love this
now all that is left is
my melted matte lip color
and i'm gonna go for the hot stuff
that'd do and then i am going to do my
hair in a little bun
so i'm just going to twist it round
and
secure it with another
hair bubble there we go let me spin you
around so you can actually see in
in real light
that's better look at that mascara
though
that mascara is a 1010. i thought i'd
put a lot of bronzer on but
i definitely didn't i am gonna head
downstairs
and i'm gonna get cozy and i'm gonna sit
by the fire
and i need to do a little bit of work
and then
who knows what the day will bring i'm
now sat in front of my laptop and i
found nala she was down here by the fire
so she had the right idea she's
obviously now on my lap
and i've popped a christmas film on
i'm gonna let you guess from the music
have you guessed yet have you made your
guess because i'm about to show you what
it is
i've popped home alone two on
yes i love this film
but also it makes me
really miss being in new york i just
love new york
i honestly i never thought i would say
that
i just loved it and being there at
christmas time
was just magical and i wish
more than ever right now with this rain
hammering down outside that i was
wandering the streets of new york with
all the treats in my hand
anyway i'm gonna get my new york
christmas fix from this film oh
look at that i just i know that's not
new york but
that's house goals that's what we're
going for with our house
one day one day we'll have lights around
every window
and then i will feel like i've completed
life look at this dog
even a little cuddle weren't you
she is so needy i'm gonna guess i feel
like i said this in a vlog recently but
i think pets are gonna be so needy now
because oh my bun's coming out because
we're just at home with them
all day long and they're just getting
far too
comfortable
and she's stuck to me like a magnet
oh do you expect me to get any work on
my laptop done when you're sat on my lap
like this
i do love it though i do love it thanks
for your cuddles
you've been my 2020 cuddle buddy that's
for sure
hello i finished what i needed to do and
then i remembered
that i didn't do this yesterday and i
haven't done it today
and i fancied myself a bit of chocolate
and i thought
what chocolate have i got
let's open day two
can you do a christmas dance
little elf all right man speak soon all
right man speak soon
i'm gonna make a guess who that is three
two one
dave i'm sorry i wasn't it's where my
life
was your mom no i was just catching up
with tracy
why are you going to bed i'm not i'm
just cold it's cold
isn't it heating up yes
number three have you done your calendar
today
no i haven't yet actually i just need to
quickly go make another call
have you written to santa hi there is
that sexy single ladies
oh sorry absolutely
oh i didn't check what it was
a father christmas
thank you father christmas i was going
to chat to you about something because
i've been thinking this for a few months
and i could be going crazy
you know just overthinking which is
exactly what my mind does
anyway i am the sort of person that is
and this could be because i
have a more susceptible mind
to anxiety overthinking
um worrying about everything i'm
basically constantly living in the past
and the future and i'm very rarely ever
just living in the present
my mind will always be taking over
something
and i don't know if it's because i have
a mind like that
that i feel very very in tune
with my body with how i feel
with any tiny little physical change
i feel like my
eyesight so i have only had glasses
when did i get these did i get these
this year i feel like i got these this
year because it was just
before lock down i got my first
prescription
age 29 months away from turning 30
i was told i actually needed glasses for
oh was it for close or far away or both
i should probably check that it's not a
very strong prescription at all
um in fact i think it was 0.5 and
i know if i'm spending a lot of time on
my laptop if i'm looking at a lot of
screens
if i'm on my phone a lot if i'm really
concentrating or reading a lot of
something
um my vision starts to go quite blurry
like more blurry than like what my
glasses can correct
and i've worked out it's always
when i start my period is that linked
do you get blurrier vision can hormones
affect your vision is
i guess the question i'm asking do you
know what i'm gonna google it
probably shouldn't but i just feel like
on the first day of my period
tmi happy vlogmas
i just can't see anything maybe i need a
stronger prescription
or last time
can you stop i'm checking if my period
affects my eyesight
ah i was checking that as well during
the first week of menstruation
the typical elevated eastern level can
claw
can cause blurred vision trouble
focusing and watery eyes i knew i wasn't
crazy
okay well that makes total sense both of
these changes can lead to blurry vision
and difficulty wearing contact lenses
you know you're eating something really
good
i was just finishing off that pastry i
bought this morning
and i just went back into the kitchen to
go and get the rest of it and i've
already finished it
i swear it was here no i just i just ate
the rest of it now but i thought i'd
absolutely left a bit in the kitchen
and then i went back and i it's i ate it

very productive today however
not very productive on the vlog front

hard to vlog i'm do you know what i'm
