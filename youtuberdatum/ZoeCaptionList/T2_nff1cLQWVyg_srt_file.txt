hello good evening you joined me
at the start of this vlog oh that's not
good lighting
there we go you join me at the start of
this vlog on
monday evening and um everybody else is
outside we've got poppy shawn steve and
alexia around
and we are doing a film club now this is
something we decided to do a couple of
weeks ago
just because we want new ways to hang
out that don't involve
going out and doing activities around
other people
and we often go around to each other's
houses and watch films anyway
but we thought we would make it a little
bit nicer and really like make a proper
thing of it
so every other week we go to somebody
else's house
and that person chooses the film so
we've pulled names out of a hat
and um we are going to alternate
and the first movie night person
is alfie days just so happens to be
alfie's birthday on thursday so we
thought we would tie this movie night in
as like a birthday thing um with all of
us together so
alfie gets to pick the film tonight we
have a no phones policy
so none of us can use our mobiles or
flick on our mobiles
we are purely going to watch and
properly digest the film because i don't
know about you
but a lot of the times i put a film on
i'm still scrolling on my phone
not really paying that much attention to
the film so that was our like rule
number one
no phones we've also got pizzas and
as in we're gonna make pizzas from
scratch and
yeah it's gonna be a really nice evening
if anybody else needs
any fun ideas to do with friends
obviously as long as it's within the six
people limit
which has now been applied um well i was
already applied but it's now illegal so
yeah we're all gonna sit in the garden
um we were originally going to just
watch the film in the living
room but because it was kind of for
alfie's birthday i wanted to make it a
little bit more special so i ordered a
projector
and i ordered a screen that meant that
we could watch the film outside and
actually we've been blessed with like
the most perfect weather this week
so we just thought it'd be great and
i've got little like
popcorn boxes i'll take you downstairs
in a minute so you can go and see it but
i just thought it'd be nice to film this
the screen is a little bit bigger than i
thought it was gonna be
um so i mean i can see it
from here it's flipping massive um i've
also
got scraped back hair no makeup on
no bra on it's just one of those days we
actually had a shoot day at the house
um with some of the girls from the team
so we have been
non-stop all day um
doing some like autumn recipe stuff
which you can look forward to on the
zoella website
so it's been a really full-on day and
now i'm really excited to
like get outside sit and watch a film
and like
really enjoy the evening i also haven't
really eaten much today which is very
bad
um so i'm really looking forward for us
to make pizzas we have actually made
pizzas we've got an uni oven alfie
bought me an uni oven for my
for my 29th birthday 28th 29th
um and it was one that you put wood
pellets in but they've recently upgraded
it so you can plug it into like
actual like a gas canister and it gets
really hot and they
kindly sent me one so we used that
when were you allowed to have people in
your garden
all those weeks back when they lifted
the rule of being able to have people in
your garden
we did a pizza evening then um so that
was the last time we did it but i'm
really excited to make some pizzas
sit and watch a film i have no idea what
film alfie's actually picked
because up to this point i i'm not
actually too sure if he's picked one yet
um but let me take you out and show you
what it looks like i think i went a bit
overboard on the size of the screen
oh my god hello
i was like i thought i heard alexia but
i can't see her
i'm sorry
i thought i could hear bae put i've
hidden the toys from syd
so bailey's probably like where's where
have all the toys gone all the toys
all the dog's little toys do you want to
see them oh the little movie snacks
oh cute
i bought oh my god
that is the cutest thing ever i've given
that to sid oh yeah she'll
she'll get right in there that is so
cute
right let's head out have you seen the
screen
it's quite a bit bigger than i thought
so from up here
you're right steve
i saw you moaning about your side
um yeah would someone mind standing
right up next to the screen for
for size context i've already loved this
joke but i'm also six foot nine
oh yeah here steve is very tall
oh hello bobby
she's chilling so we're gonna make
pizzas down here we've moved the sofa
down here and now we're setting the
projector up
i say we i mean they yeah we're gonna
get some blankets and throws
and we're gonna sit out here as the sun
sets
and watch your film on the little little
screen guys i don't know if we're gonna
be able to see it i'm gonna have to get
my glasses out
alfie thinks i'm planning something
you love planning surprises and i
appreciate
it but i'm not the biggest alfie i have
not
planned anything for today okay
i told him that i needed to go and sort
my hair out and he just said
he said the only reason i think that you
are doing something is
you said you need to go and do your hair
and you haven't done it i was like i
have
i tried to make this bun look as less of
a poo
on top of my head as possible but no i
thought because it just looked lovely
before and lovely after
oh really and this big one here coming
out oh look at that
i know it's my hair's not great right
now guys i need
i i need sam and adam to come and
move my extensions back up and i haven't
washed it
so this is just what this is just what
i'm gonna
have to deal with he's really sketching
out he really thinks i've planned
something
i know avi very well although he likes
to throw surprises for me
he does not want them in return ever
and i have learnt that so i wouldn't do
it to him what have you got bae
you got your crispies they say your
crispies
oh my god where's yours
no that's bae's toy
good girl bae that was nice we're making
pizzas

bit of
grated mozzarella some sliced tomatoes

to go
to be fair he puts a lot of cheddar on
his
that's okay isn't it lovely look at that
lovely lovely what are you going for
toppings this is inspired by toby's
pizza
yeah yeah i've put some around too but
they just like
i don't want to do them
most of what you say is not english no i
dropped it
i dropped a list right
okay we've got pizza oven on little
sofa area it's actually pitch black i
cannot see a thing
and the screen is ready to play i think
alfie's picked the platform on netflix
this is the little sofa area got the
projector at the back
these little lights are i think i got
them
from lara do but you can
like take this bit off and it's just
battery-powered
you can put them on the floor or you can
get this little stand and put them on
which i thought was
pretty cool um so we've got those and
i'm about to light some candles
you actually can't see anything okay
i've lit some candles it's looking a
little brighter out here
here we go this is really cool
i'm also very hungry so i'm about ready
to put my pizza in that oven right now
can't see anything it's pitch black we
weren't actually anticipating watching
the film this late
um but alfie could not find
the cable he needed and one of the
things i said to him yesterday was
so i've got your projector for your
birthday we can use it
tomorrow but please open it and check
that you have the cables we need and if
you don't then go out and get them in
the day
so that we can watch the film at night
did he check the box no
so we opened the box expecting it to all
be there and to all work
and of course we needed a really really
specific cable
to get his laptop to plug into the
projector so that took like three hours
but it's done now it's ready to go
just waiting to do the old pizzas
we've got some popcorn in little popcorn
boxes
some crisps all the pizzas are out and
ready
look at this it looks like they're all

[Laughter]
[Music]
i started good morning
i've just done my hair wearing the wrong
bra with this dress
but never mind i've just come upstairs
to do my makeup and like chat to you
as i was doing it and i don't know about
you but this doesn't look
this doesn't look right i've got three
wasps chilling in the window
um and then
loads of dead ones
all over the floor and all up there
i'm gonna make a guess
that there's a wasp's nest
somewhere in this window oh
okay that's not cute do i stay in here
or not
okay i decided i'm scared there's a wasp
going to come out my makeup bag
i have decided i don't want to risk
doing my makeup around a
swarm of wasps so i've shut the door i'm
going to deal with that problem another
time
oh i'm so like i don't know how they're
all getting in either they're all
getting in through a hole or there's a
nest in the roof and they're coming in
through the window we don't know
but that's a thing at least it's not
hornets this year
who remembers when we had a hornet nest
in our chimney that wasn't fun i'd never
seen hornets before that
hornets are huge what are we doing
makeup wise well
to be honest i probably really won't
stray too far from what i always do
after doing the autumn shoot yesterday
i really i really want to get all my
autumn decorations out
and start like properly
i guess just cozying the house up
but i feel like the hot weather this
week has sort of put me back a week so
maybe i'll have to do it at some point
next week
i'm using the lasting perfection
i go in with two colors i could do a
lighter one under my eyes this one's
ivory and then i've done cashew
uh like in random places oh my stomach
did you just hear that
it's very bright isn't it then i'm gonna
use my bare minerals i feel like i need
to get my brows done again
they've gone quick bit of photon bare
minerals
i definitely used to be so much more
experimental
with makeup and
as i've gotten older i just find i just
go back to using the same things
probably just out of pure like laziness
and knowing what works
and having less time i don't know
yeah these brows these brows have
already grown using the anastasia dip
brow pomade as always
as well not gonna lie i could really do
with um
cleaning my brushes that do
that do me nice blusher the actual
colors that i put on
are king pin and
unlimited so king pin is the
it's like a really pretty like light
pink you can't really see it because
i've decided to sit right in the light
to do my makeup
and then unlimited is the highlighter
that i usually
throw on which is disappearing
right bit of wash of color on the
eyelids
using a bit of the victoria beckham
beauty in tweed
this is essentially what i've been doing
most days most days i've bothered with
makeup anyway
oh my nose is looking well hairy love
that for me
that'll do then i get a little shader
brush and i just put a little bit under
my eye
eyeline line line eye
bottom lash line that's the word i never
used to put liner under my eyes but i do
feel like it makes a difference
where's my mascara so the mascara i'm
using is the hourglass unlocked still
but i have been trying out different
mascaras september is one of those
months for me where so many people i
know have a birthday
um i feel like everybody has
like a month where they're like why is
everyone born in this month
for me it's may and like early june i
just feel like so many people i know are
born in may and june
um and september
so many birthdays which also means i
know a lot of geminis
and a lot of virgos
there we go you can't actually see
anything because the camera is just
completely bright brighten my face
and i'm going to put a little bit of
lippy on even though the majority of the
time
when you're out and about got a mask
covering it
but i'm not planning on going anywhere
today i know of
tarte lip paint in exposed
which is really pretty nude peachy pink
okay that's me done that's literally
what i do most mornings
i definitely do need to wash my brushes
and have a tiny change up
i need to keep brushing the old studies
out sometimes when i freshly do them
they
sort of separate a bit you have to keep
brushing them out let's start the day
i've moved to the spare bedroom because
i just think this lighting is a bit
nicer
um still got the what are those called
streamers
from mark's little party that we threw
in
a little pride party i just think they
look really colorful
i like it it's about to quickly club
the king of all biscuits orange club
in my top three biscuit tier
an orange club for me orange chocolate
is probably
just the best so combine that with a
biscuit
let me know your top three
biscuits your top tier biscuits
my other two my other top two
are the milk chocolate rounds from
m s and then what did i we did this um
on the hot in the office for the zoella
instagram
and i can't remember what my third
biscuit was i've remembered it
sugary shortbread sugary buttery
shortbread at christmas time
you just can't beat it just had a very
exciting delivery
let me take all my bits out of it
i just really choked still
a bit of biscuit in my mouth it's a cult
beauty haul
i feel like i haven't done a haul in so
long i'm really excited about it
they've also given me a code hello

you

information down here just in case but
yeah
i'll show you what i got the first thing
i got
are these which are the bu monthly
patches
i've actually talked about these before
on i think i want to say on my stories
and i had the most amount of swipe ups
i've ever had on anything
when i talked about these so you guys
obviously really like the sound of them
i've
just finished my other packet i actually
got sent them
from cult beauty about a year ago and i
found them in my
medicine cupboard and i was like oh like
what are these i've
completely forgotten so they are packed
with organic essential oils
calling comfort where you need it most
at school at work
traveling and while you sleep so they're
like
giant stickers stickers plasters
like big patches natural ingredients
released over 12 hours discreet and
comfortable
so if you get cramps or cramping or just
general uncomfortableness during your
time of the month you can put these on
and throughout the day they just ease
the tension and i i think i put one on i
was having a really
crampy day about like eight months ago i
can't even remember when i
maybe a year ago um and i put one on and
i was like
these are insane
they're so thin too i'm going to just
show you one because
just you just need these in your life
there you go
big old strips like that
it's just a really lovely like cooling
sensation
and they really do help with mine so
okay oh they smell so strong can you
smell that
can you smell that but anyway that's the
first thing i picked up next thing i got
is the olaplex number three
um sam my friend who does my hair is
always telling me
to use this um it's a little like
treatment
used one time per week for damaged hair
two to three times per week oh apply a
generous amount
from scalp to ends until hair is
thoroughly saturated leave on for a
minute of 10 minutes
so olaplex excuse me what you doing
oh you can't have that
she's licking the chocolate off of my
club wrapper
cheeky monkey you cheeky monkey it's
gone now
um yes so it's a hair mask essentially
um what else have i got in here i've
sort of forgotten what i ordered oh
okay so this is a little little nars
lipstick no i wish you could see nala
she is like
she's so intrigued what do you see a lip
pencil in
dragon girl and i had one of these and
i've lost it i have no idea where it is
but it's one of my favorite red
lip colors no that's
really naughty i had another club bar
which i'm going to eat when i finished
filming this and she was trying to tune
that my goodness
um yeah it's one of my favorite red
shades it's really lovely it's kind of
like a
orangey red and it's matte so
yeah got another one of those oh okay so
this is a brand that
i hadn't heard of before but it looked
very interesting it's called plein air
um and this is a rose jelly gentle
makeup remover
i really like the packaging i think it's
really cool um rose jelly gentle makeup
remover this conditioning formula
has a unique jelly-like texture that
works to rapidly dissolve makeup and
impurities
while soothing and cooling skin cruelty
free
and vegan and made in the uk so i just
thought that would
it's also a really good size so i wanted
to try that just for like travel
so yeah picked up that excited to give
that a try
i grabbed this so this is ah
so i got this because a lot of the um
face spfs i have are 30
and i know that you should really be
wearing an spf
every day of 50 just to keep that skin
looking young and fresh you know
so this one is by darling and it's very
high protection
spf 50 glowy face cream
spf 50 plus lightweight emulsion
suitable for all skin types
even the most sensitive this is why i
got it
i get very sensitive skin around my eyes
in fact i
had a shoot recently and i put i had to
wear quite a lot of eye makeup and
each look like more and more and more
went on and then for like five days
after that i had like really like
leaky eyes um and a few of the spf's i
have do
react with my eyes and get really
streamy
so i liked the fact that this was for
sensitive skin
um and that it was small and compact and
i'd heard really good things about this
so yeah i'm excited to
slip this into my skincare routine
especially this week because
it's really hot and sunny again so
well needed this can you see me why is
this so bright
is that better it just felt like it was
really bright there we go this is better
biosynthesis bioscience
the squalene and glycolic renewal facial
exfoliates refines and boosts radiance
plant derived squaley squalene squalene
squalene a peel exfoliator a mask
in one i think i saw this on there and i
just thought this looked
and sounded very interesting
oh it's got a cell by date i mean to
hurry up and use that anything that says
glycolic renewal facial i'm like yes
please
smells good cult beauty have like some
of the best brands
and the best face masks anytime i'm like
i need a new face mask i'll be sure to
get it from there
solei to jour again a lot of the time i
shop on colt beauty
i like to read reviews and i like to see
what's best selling
and i like to see what lots of other
people i follow have been talking about
um this i don't remember why i bought
but
i like the look of it this is a aloe
antioxidant calming mist
look how cool that packaging is i love
that i've never used anything from this
brand before
but
oh that's lovely that's really nice
that'll be a good one to keep in the
fridge
give it a little spritz i picked up
these uh
by drunk elephant i feel like these are
fairly new
um they are the silly body lotion
moisturize nourish the marula butter
five ceramide blend
ph 4.2 restores dull dry and irritable
skin to a healthier and more balanced
state with a blend of nourishing plant
oils and butters
squealing what all this squalene
what is squalene in fact it actually
says on this
what squealing is let me tell you mega
moisturizing molecule
that instantly hydrates while locking in
essential moisture
well i like the sound of it and it seems
to be in everything oh look at me i need
my glasses this is what my mom does
this writing's quite small and my eyes
are really struggling to adjust
there's basically a lot of cool things
in it
for a body moisturizer and i liked the
sound of it
oh i've got dirty hands from somewhere
so
i thought i'd give it a go i actually
haven't put any moisturizer on yet today
that's naughty oh it smells like
marzipan and
almonds oh that's lovely oh my god i
thought there was somebody standing
there then
i got the body lotion and i got a cream
body cleanser non-fragrant plant oils
and skin restorative amino acids
replenish and soothe leaving behind a
light layer of protective
lipids apply to wet skin
gently massage gently and rinse so this
is like a shower gel
um but it says that it leaves your skin
feeling like moisturized and lovely
which i also like the sound of because
as much as i
do like to moisturize my body especially
during winter i haven't done it
as much as i should through summer i'm
not gonna lie um
but through winter i try and moisturize
my body as much as i
can um but something like this i like
the sound of because
it sounds a bit like you might not need
to
you probably should but sounds like
it does a good job of moisturizing your
body which i like molten brown
flora luminaire bath and shower gel
i love molten brown shower gels they are
one of my
favorites to use anytime i go to a hotel
and they have molten brown
as the like um little travel sized
i get so happy they the fragrances are
amazing
but also they lather really nicely and
they linger like the smell lingers on
your skin which
i really really like i don't know if
i've ever smelt this one before
flora luminaire
oh i wish you could smell this
so i got a new one of those i've
literally just finished
my other molten brown in the shower this
morning so that's perfect
oh i'm excited about this one so a lot
of you might know
that the brand allies of skin is one of
my favorites
i have just found that any product i've
ever used from them
really really makes a noticeable
difference to my skin and
the price tag is slightly higher
on the scale but i mean
there's a 15 discount so use that use it
wisely
um i just i love anything they bring out
i've never used one of their products
that i've been like that did nothing
so yes steeper price tag but
i really believe their products work or
they work for me anyway so
i'm happy about that this is the
mole there's so many words
in skincare that i just cannot pronounce
molecular molecule molecular
savior probiotics repair mist
so this is step two in the skincare
routine it's saying mist so like a toner
um you can use it morning and night anti
anti-evaporation
alcohol-free mist that tones repairs and
intensely hydrates skin with probiotics
neocinnamide niacinamide um
cloydy colloidal silver mango extract
and six antioxidants
each spritz drenches skin with a
supercharged blend of antioxidants and
probiotics delivering
long-lasting boosts of reparative
hydration perfect
for refreshing skin on the go or during
and after every flight
oh i'm really excited to give this a go
i'll let you know
um for a while i took toners out of my
skincare routine
i when i was trying to clear my skin up
i literally used
two cleansers and a moisturizer and that
is all i used
um and slowly i've been bringing things
back in and actually introducing a toner
into my skincare routine
has made a noticeable difference i think
in the smoothness and the texture of my
skin so
exploring different toners is quite fun
this
i picked up by a brand called verst
again
i was slightly drawn in by the packaging
but this is called the shortcut
overnight facial
peel lactic and glycolic acid vegan
cruelty free fragrance free dye free no
parabens no silicones no sulfates no
formaldehyde no petroleum no mineral oil
use me if you want to wake up to
smoother brighter
looking skin hell yeah every single day
yes please
while you sleep i work 99 made for
dullness and aging skin
well i have aging skin because i'm 30.
so my skin now is most probably on a
downward spiral but
you know we do what we can looks like
this
very cute i'm excited to give it a try
um
i love something you just put on at
night and see what it looks like in the
morning
so i'm excited to try that oh another
little cheeky nars
so i have been on the market for an
orangey lipstick for a while and
i noticed that nars had this one and it
is called start your engines
although it says sheer which i didn't
realize i wanted quite a
vibrant it looks pretty vibrant
oh i like oh damn it
it's pretty sheer i mean it might be
nice i'm not gonna put it on cause i've
just done my makeup but i didn't realize
that was sheer lipstick
gosh darn it i probably will still wear
it because it's a very pretty color
um maybe maybe i can build it up a bit
more but if anybody knows
of a very vibrant matte
orange let me know and i mean like
orange orange
frank body in your dreams sleep
scrub and soak there's magnesium melts
away tension epsom salts exfoliates and
seeds skin
lavender mother nature's calming heroes
we have a
packet i just really liked the sound of
this i've been trying to do a lot more
things before bed i was going through a
phase where i was
really struggling to sleep at night but
then also i would wake up in the morning
and feel a bit like
anxious so i'd wake up at like six and
be like wide awake and feeling a bit
like
so i just wanted to get a few like
sleepy things that might help me to
sleep better and deeper
because i was also sleeping really
lightly too last thing i picked up
was this this is one of my favorite
this is the laura mercier body and bath
ombre vanilla honey bath so you have
this little
spoolie and you can twist it around like
honey and then you hold it under your
tap
and it just runs and it just it just
nicest smelling thing ever i like to get
laura mercier for people for as gifts
just because something like this is such
like a
lovely present for me it's the smell
that smell i've been buying this for
years and it really reminds me of our
old house because i used to have one of
these
um on the side of the bath and i would
pour some of this into pretty much every
single bath i had and like the
whole of like the upstairs would smell a
bit um so anytime i use this it really
reminds me of our old house
um but i love it and i had run out so
i thought i should best get some more
especially now that we're coming into
autumn because it's like that really
like
warming vanilla smell um and it just
smells incredible
so that's my little haul um it was quite
nice to sit down and like
chat you through some new bits that i've
bought if you are looking
to purchase any new bath body
skincare makeup bits go and check out

outside today
um i've been inside working literally
since i sat down and showed you all the
bits i bought from cult beauty um
just in a couple of meetings we had one
meeting
with the film and template team which
was really cool we actually do these
meetings every month
to go through
new packs new ideas new things we want
to bring out
um things like the marketing the
promotion
updates on sales um and actually
film now has over two million downloads
which is insane and so exciting
it's great i mean when did we launch
film it was last
july i think june last june or july so
for it to already have two million
downloads is fantastic and i'm so glad
so many of you
love using it i think for me working on
film and template is so enjoyable
because it's almost like
creating something that i use every day
and like being able to tweak something
or add something or say hey guys have we
thought about adding this
um and making it like the best app that
we possibly can
um so yeah thank you so much for two
million downloads
if some of those downloads are from you
guys and
yeah obviously template as well almost
at
half a million downloads which is crazy
and we actually have a new pack
launching this friday
and it has lots of like
computer inspired templates
and um phone templates
which i'm excited for that's really
exciting so we all had a little catch up
about that
and then we had a big team oh
then we had a big team meeting um about
digital detox day
and how we want to um go forward with
any findings or
learnings or um just how we can keep
this momentum going
and and we're all just really thrilled
and we all kind of got together
on a zoom and just basically were like
hold on everyone
like it went really well and so many
people found it so helpful
and yeah that was really nice and then i
just had a little catch up with maddie
and danielle
and now i'm filling you guys in
i'm gonna edit this and get it up um
i've also been watching
old school tawi episodes
because it's just my guilty pleasure i
actually watched their
um reunion special that um went
up and that's what inspired me to start
watching them from the beginning so
any little spare chance i've had today
