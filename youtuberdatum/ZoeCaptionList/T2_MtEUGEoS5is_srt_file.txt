is this gonna stay
okay there we go good morning good
evening
good afternoon i did that in a weird
order good morning good afternoon
good evening so today i uploaded
my oh let's put my phone on silent
so today i uploaded my video
with my therapist on ig tv as i said i
was going to in my last video
and as promised i am uploading it here
too because i feel like for so many of
you that follow me
um because i talk so openly about
anxiety and have done
over the course of being here on youtube
and just having an online presence
i know that a lot of you will
want to come back to that video or save
that video or re-watch that video
and alexis and i just had the notion
that
if this video just helped one person
then that's amazing
so i've already had some incredible
feedback my glasses are really dirty i'm
very sorry about that
i've already had some incredible
feedback from those of you that have
watched the igtv and have sent me
messages
on instagram so thank you so much for
that and i've been
screenshotting them to pass on to alexis
as well because i know she'll love to
see them too
a couple of things i just wanted to say
before you watch this video
especially if you've randomly stumbled
upon this
and have no idea what digital detox day
is um
this is a video that i made um in a
series
of um videos for a campaign called
digital detox day
let's pop these back on there we go i
can see now
so that is like the context behind why
um
we made the video but also it's
something that i have wanted to do for a
very long time i've always wanted to
sit down with alexis and we've talked
about it over the years just being able
to chat and have a conversation
and for us to talk about lots of
different things that
i have found useful working with her
that's just a little bit of context
we've stumbled on this video in like
2022 or something
hi my name is zoe i've had anxiety since
i was 14. i've talked very openly about
anxiety here on
my platforms and this is the first time
i am sharing a video with my therapist
and it's a very special video and i hope
you enjoy it a couple of things
to note this was filmed uh during
lockdown slash social distancing
measures
uh so we zoom called so the quality is
not the best so i apologize for that
it's a long video it's probably better
off that you just kind of put it on in
the background and listen to it like
podcast style
um but you know neither of us are tech
wizards so i think
considering we did a great job so as i
said it's quite a long video
grab a snack grab a cup of tea um
turn off your netflix and watch this
instead it's a long one
but there wasn't really anything i
wanted to edit out
there's so much in it that i
thought would be useful to the person
watching it
you anyone who stumbles upon this video
that i just i didn't really want to cut
it down so
i'm aware it's a bit longer i feel like
here on this channel you're used to my
long content anyway
um so grab a snack i don't know run
yourself a bath
uh pop this on and let me know what you
think
let me know which bits in particular you
found
helpful um and yeah uh
just remember i guess largely that
you are not alone if you are watching
this video and you just feel
like you are the only person in the
world that feels the way you feel
there are so many others out there who
understand and
mental health is such a
awful thing to deal with on your own and
i hope that this video gives you the
courage if you've not yet talked about
it or explored
speaking to somebody about your anxiety
that you are able to do that
i am going to leave a list of helpful
links
um to those of you that might be
watching this that want
to find help so those will be in the
description box if you or anyone you
know is really struggling with anxiety
and you're really really worried please
reach out to
um any of the resources below i think
also it's just important to note that
although we touch on advice and tools
and things that you can take away from
this video
no two people's experience of anxiety is
the same so what works for you
might not work for someone else and what
really works for me might not work for
you
or vice versa it's you know it's totally
down to the individual
um with what
feels like it makes a difference so i
think that's everything that i wanted to
say at the start of this video
um just to give it a bit more context
here on youtube and
i really hope you enjoy it and again
just thank you so much for your lovely
messages i'm so pleased
that you are enjoying the digital detox
um content that's the word i'm looking
for it's been a long day
um okay i'll see you soon bye everybody
welcome back
on today's digital detox day video i am
talking all things anxiety and i was
really excited to do this video because
i thought there is no one i would rather
do this video with
than my therapist someone i've spoken to
for how many years now
four and a half five five it must be
five
it might even be six i don't really know
yeah um
in a while it's been a long time
um so this is alexis and she has been
a therapist for many many years
and she speaks to a range of different
people
with different how would you best
describe
different mental health issues problems
and
yes yes their lives aren't working in
the way they'd like them to
yes and actually one of the things
that was so clear when we were looking
into how social media makes people feel
was how anxious people feel
in general um but also when it comes to
social media
and comparing yourself and also the
effects
of a lot of the other videos that we've
already filmed so you've got things like
cyberbullying you've got things like
body dysmorphia
and body confidence and there's so many
different elements and areas within
social media that can impact somebody's
mental health but i think
one overarching feeling that a lot of
people had was this kind of anxious
like very unsettled feeling and so i
thought
it would be great to be able to sit down
with alexis
and talk a little bit more about that
hopefully some of you will
resonate with this or it will help you
in some way or at least
help you to know that you are not alone
in feeling like that and that there are
some things that might be able to help
[Music]
you
so the first question then
can you tell us a little bit more about
what anxiety
is yes anxiety is a very broad field so
anxiety is a very
broad field we all feel anxious people
will often say to me
i want to get rid of my anxiety yet
anxiety is an important
human mind process we have to be able to
feel anxious
because our anxiety is there to help us
keep safe which is what we want
the problems arise when anxiety gets out
of
hand and our imagination
which we're fortunate to have but our
imagination
constructs thoughts that actually
unsettle us so we can be anxious about
all sorts of things in all sorts of ways
um but with social media in particular
we become anxious because of things that
we are watching or listening to
and that's a very sort of specific area
of anxiety
so i guess this is this kicks on from
that
but why does social media
often make people feel worse especially
for somebody who might already have
a very vivid imagination like we know my
imagination is oh yes is quite
colourful yes so somebody whose mind
is more susceptible to those things
why would something like social media
make that worse for that person
because they tune into it literally so
they're tuning into it so
if you think of anxiety somebody's it's
the imagination
creating thoughts and we always anxiety
is projected into a future so we
worry even if it's something that we
think we might have said or we might
have upset somebody
but even if we're looking into the past
about something we're worried about
we're still projecting it into what will
that mean for me in my future
and uh that's so it's the imagination
of not knowing what comes next so we
want to keep
safe and one of the things that
makes us feel safe is if we feel in
control
and one of the things that makes us feel
in control is knowing
what's going to be happening or knowing
what's going on around us
now with social media because it's so
vast and you can tap into so many
different areas of what's going on
around us or what's going to happen next
rather than sort helping and soothing
our anxiety which basically is worry
it fuels it because we tend to go
looking as the mind does it always goes
looking for the things it doesn't want
to be really
looking at so and the one that i've
always used with you
and it's a very common one is you know
if you don't
try not to think of the color blue and
then because we have to think of blue to
be able to negate that color
we actually go looking for all the
things are fueling our anxieties
in trying to soothe them because all
we're doing is just inflaming it all the
time
yeah yeah that's one aspect
and then the other aspect is that we
tend to go looking for
we very we narrow our perception with
social media so
we go looking for the ideas and the
beliefs
and the values and the concerns
that feed into what we are anxious about
rather than seeing the bigger broader
picture which is definitely there on
social media
but we're not following those people
we're not
reading those news we're not listening
to that broadca
uh podcast we're actually just homing in
on all the stuff that's going to make us
feel worse
so interesting and actually a fun fact
with the color blue
i've been now doing this with alexis for
five years and whenever she says that i
think of green
yeah i've reprogrammed my mind yes
yes and that is basically how
it sounds so simple yet it isn't easy
but
working with anxiety that's actually how
we have to train the mind we have to
train the mind to go where we want it to
go
rather than trying to keep it away from
all the stuff that we don't like
yeah because ultimately keeping it away
from
only exacerbates how you feel about
certain things
yes because we're tr all the time we're
thinking about what we
don't want rather than thinking about
what we do want
and i can imagine for a lot of people
especially during lockdown
where social media was being used a lot
more
and the news was much more intense and
it was
everywhere you were looking you know i
would open my phone and i had
hundreds of news articles and then i
would go on instagram which
usually would be sort of my escape like
somewhere i can follow the people that i
like watching and everyone was talking
about it
and you know we're on our phones more
and we're facetiming our friends and our
families
and that interaction we're having with
our devices
and with social media kind of got
doubled
in those months or tripled or quite
approached i mean it was huge
and people were tuning in to the five
o'clock bulletin they're listening to
the news
everybody's watching the figures go up
and all that's doing
is creating this sense of i don't i'm
not in control
i'm not safe i don't know what's going
to happen next
it's it's and it brought into sharp
focus what anxiety actually is
which is this aspect of i want to know
what's happening
i want to feel i'm in control and of
course within our society
in particular because we're very
fortunate because of where we live in
the world
we don't really have that unsettled
mass anxiety happen very often
you know we we tend to live in quite a
secure environment
we have good health care we we do tend
to have a lot
of control over our day-to-day lives
without even being consciously aware of
it
so when something like this happens like
uh covered
um it really escalates that feeling of
well i'm not safe
yeah it's so true it's so easy then to
go down what
i call rabbit holes of the mind but
there are things where
we can get knocked more off balance by
reading
about conspiracy theories or um
area that we live in the statistics in
our particular area
and that just as you can imagine and it
is imagination
fuels are all the more can social media
ever be good for people with anxiety oh
yes yes yes
this we go back to this thing where i
said at the beginning you know um
people will often say to me about
getting rid of anxiety and no no
no no don't ever get rid of anxiety
because if you think of somebody who
doesn't live with anxiety
they're not safe because they don't know
when they need to be
concerned about something um so the
difference is between
worry which is just endless random round
and round and round and round and i know
we've talked about this before
and worry where you can actually do
something about it because if you do
something about what you're worried
about you can take action on it and then
the worry isn't there anymore
so it's about
if you can't actually take action on the
worry
then you need to drop it so where social
media can be very
helpful with that because often people
will say to me
how can i drop a worry i'm worried how
can i drop it
and i say well can you take action on it
no and i don't mean action on it by
googling anything either that's not
taking action that's it
worrying that you didn't lock the door
and being able
if you could if you were two minutes
down the road can you go back and check
yes you can okay yeah yeah
but don't lie there worrying or go off
on your wherever you're going your
journey or whatever you're doing by
worrying about it
but what you can do is distract yourself
distracting
distracting ourselves it's a very good
way of dropping
worries so if you can't take action on a
worry
and you're finding it difficult to drop
it that's where
tuning into something on social media
can be so helpful because before you
know it you're thinking about
find something lighthearted you know i
think joe wicks i don't really know much
about joe wiggs and i but i do know he
was very very popular doing lockdown
and i think he was great for being able
to take people's worries and anxieties
and
channel them somewhere where they were
so distracted and physically active
which always helps
physical activity being out in nature
and really made a difference for people
because they realized that their worries
were just worries and actually when they
did some physical exercise and they were
whatever they were doing with joe wicks
it worked for them
yeah exactly so that's where social
media comes into its own your
i mean what you do on social media you
know you encourage people
i know the book club and things like
that you're taking people
in this other direction you're taking
them
not trying to get away from and worried
about but oh i could focus on this
instead
so i think that's where social media has
a real strength and it does connect
people
yeah being connected with people is so
important for us as human beings
definitely i suppose like most things
at a good level it's it when it works at
a good level
it's good and it's only if you
consume too much that it can become an
issue
yes i meant to say that when we were
talking about anxiety this thing about
anxiety is necessary so
i always mark things on scales of naught
to 10 again your furniture memory is
with this we'll be doing this for a long
while so you know how are you feeling
naught to ten
how do you feel um on a scale of naught
to 10
about your angle about being anxious
it's when people are i'm up at an eight
i'm up at nine i'm up at 10. that's when
anxiety is a real issue that's when it's
a real problem that's when it needs to
be lowered
but when anxiety is nicely in the
background a one-two
that's fine that's where it's meant to
be it's meant to just be there in the
background so if i need to be a little
bit aware of something
crossing the road or you know
my laptop just cutting out or
that wouldn't make me anxious but you
know it's that sort of thing but it just
needs to be ticking away in the
background very softly
so it's when it's needed it steps
forward
but for people who are really anxious
and who are fueling their anxiety
they're keeping themselves up at that
eight nine ten
and that's when it's not good for you as
you know
as i know it's taken me a good few years
but i'd say i'm definitely
on the lower scale now i know yes
um you always used a really good um
metaphor is it for those levels of
anxiety it was something about a lion in
a
bush and i can't remember what it was it
was
yes it's well there's two there's one
that you know it's like if you think of
early man
and thinking think about how the mind
and brain developed
you know if we're trotting across the
savannah and we
see a rustle the bushes rustling we need
to be aware that could be a line in
there
and that's where anxiety one two works
when we're trotting across
the open plains and uh we're constantly
looking
or we won't even step out onto those
open planes
in case they're not scared now that's
where anxiety's in eight nine
ten and now it's really
counterproductive of course the other
one that i use with people is
um if i'm sitting in my office and we're
chatting away
if there's a suddenly a loud roar
outside or a loud bang
it's quite normal and perfectly okay
from an anxiety point of view to step up
and see
look out the window and see what's going
on because we do need to know
yeah and once we've discounted that fear
we're okay
what are the best personal coping
strategies for people
experiencing anxiety
it's hard because as i know everybody's
anxieties are so different not one
person
will have the exact feelings
that another person will have and they
will all stem from such
different things and issues
and different parts of people's lives
some might be very deep-rooted
some might be quite surface level so i
understand that's quite a hard question
to answer
it's a it's a very broad question yeah
um
yeah um but uh i forgot what the
question was now
any any personal coping strategies so i
suppose any tips you've ever given me
i can think of a really good one i think
this is regard to social media and
people coming in the room
it's like that one so i have two that i
always sort of carry in my back pocket
and
the first one is the distraction which
you touched on already
and that having giving yourself those 10
minute chunks
specifically yes yeah specifically if
you
feel a panic attack coming or
you can feel your anxiety really like
spiraling a bit
to be able to split your time up
in order to distract yourself and um
allow your mind to remember that time is
moving forward because i think for a lot
of people when they're feeling very
anxious
they feel a bit stuck in time yes yes
and that's always helped me
is those like do 10 minutes of reading
10 minutes of watching a bit of gavin
and stacy
10 minutes of playing a game on an app
10 minutes of flicking through instagram
but as long as you're changing that up
if you're feeling those
intense um feelings it really really
helps me
yes yes because what so
would a broad one for um general
anxiety well it's not general anxiety
but how anxiety is and then we can move
it into more specific for social media
if that's what you'd like yeah so for
anxiety
as a process what happens with the mind
is it
freezes itself in the anxiety we all
know about the fight or flight
i'm going to fight i'm going to run but
actually people don't talk about it but
they're
they're two more there's faint and
there's freeze um
now we'll leave faint because that
that's quite a pacific
area but freezing is what we generally
do we
freeze ourselves in that anxiety we
can't move we can't move our minds our
minds
frozen in it so there are methods that
can be used
which over the years i've developed um
because
as you say each each client each person
has their own specific way of experience
anxiety the process is the same so you
get the same anxiety feelings of
getting warm and fast heart
and breathing yes oh yeah yeah yeah
that's mine breathing oh yes
and uh how people experience it is very
specific to this so the process is the
same for everyone
how anxiety works in the mind it builds
it freezes but then what actu so that's
the process
but then everybody is an individual so
it's actually finding out what their
individual
ways of doing anxiety is but
on a broader scale even with the process
itself there's a lot of things that can
be done to help
a lot of things and one of those is i
call them the tools and like i say
they're things i've
just sort of worked on over the years
but um
there's a time delay which is
i'm going to give myself 10 minutes i'm
not ignoring the fact that i feel uneasy
and unsettled but i'm going to wait 10
minutes and then see how i feel then
and very often the mind is like a
butterfly it moves on really quickly
and by the time you come back after 10
minutes the mind's already moved on it's
not thinking about it anymore very
fickle
very fickle the mind is very fickle it's
abstract you see that's why social media
feeds into the mind
so easily it's so easy to sit down and
click on a link
and click on another link and click on
another link because that's what the
mind does
all the time anyway day-to-day life it
just is constantly moving on to the next
thing
chunking time down is a really effective
one for
a a process of moving through
something so i think with you we talked
about when you were flying when you were
going on a flight and it's like right
well the flight is going to be four
hours
so i'm chunking it down into hour bites
and in that
first hour i'll read my book oh i've
done that now second hour oh i'll do
this
and the mind's very good at thinking oh
i'm halfway there now this is nearly
done
and because it's subconscious it can do
that another thing that's
really really helpful and each of these
methods
people find they usually find one or two
of them that work best for them
another one that's really good is
getting movement beyond
so it's um so again if we use the
flights an example
it's um what will the hotel be like when
i get there
what will um what will i be eating this
evening
what will and we move the mind out of
that
frozen mode into something in the future
um uh sometimes people are scared about
going to the dentist and i always say
look
excuse me before you go to the dentist
get your home set up so when you come
back
you've got you know uh a nice afternoon
planned
you've got a book to read whatever it is
you like to do but
plan something plan to go out this
evening plan to have a friend around
this evening
so actually you know that there is
something beyond
this thing that you're going to be doing
just
yes so that's sort of on a general
day-to-day basis
um but specifically with social media
i think probably it's this thing
of closing down the avenues that are
fueling it
and finding other avenues that are
taking you in different ways so
over talking about covert again i was
sort of inundated with people being in
touch finding it very difficult day to
day
and i nothing if you need to know
something you will know it it's okay to
stop watching the news quite so much
yeah you will find out things it's
really important to try to make sure
that you don't engage in too much
conversation about it
so you know if somebody starts a thread
don't engage with it engagement always
opens something up
and fuels it so even if you're taking an
opposing view you've
still absorbed yourself into it um
there's been a lot of talk about nature
and it is very good physical activity
and nature is very good
it's that again is movement if we go
back to that thing of always keep the
mind moving into a different direction
going outside uh
it helps we're moving we're seeing
things we're hearing different things
um and connecting with others but not
necessarily in that oh isn't it dreadful
have you read the news have you heard
the figures
new zealand is doing much better than we
are well it's a much smaller country
it's about keeping things in perspective
you know and
we are very very quick to judge
which is another thing with social media
which i'm sure we'll move into about
judging and comparing
we're very very quick to judge and we
usually judge
judge negatively so it's very important
to stop that process of
finding fault they should have done more
they haven't done this
i mean it doesn't mean we become
complacent
but we take action from a point of
factual
information not from paranoia and
anxiety
and i think specifically online those
things can
spiral and mold into
something so much bigger or something
that it didn't even start off as
and it's so easy with social media to
get involved in those conversations or
to
say something that you wouldn't
necessarily say to somebody
if you sat opposite them at your kitchen
table oh it's so true
and it it it becomes almost it's a it's
a crowd and it can become a mob
um you
have been on receiving end of some of
this that can go on on social media
where people become inflamed and make
comments
and have an opinion and they're
uninformed
they don't know the situation and yeah
it's everybody climbing on a bandwagon
or everybody
you think having their opinion their
point of view
which doesn't really always relate to
the subject that is being
discussed i think one other thing that i
always find very helpful and that i know
others do too is to remember that you
only see a very tiny fraction of
how somebody really is the
the friendships the bonds they have with
people a lot of what people share on
social media is not
the full picture it would be very hard
to give
the full picture of someone's entire
life
online and it will always be a best bits
reel yes because people don't want the
stuff
they wouldn't like nobody wants to know
yeah
it would be it would be tmi if everybody
shared every aspect of their life
yes and i think sometimes being able to
bring that back into perspective if
somebody was finding it particularly
hard with friends in school i know
so many young teens and people
in there like kind of like middle teens
that have grown up with the internet
whereas
i had a very different experience of the
internet when i was a teenager
we had it but we didn't use it like that
we didn't there was no social media
um if i had fallouts with my friends it
was in the classroom and we would send
each other notes or
meet up meet up at break time and talk
about it
and i think for a lot of young people
who are growing up with
those with the access to be able to say
whatever they want um to somebody else
in their classroom
via social media it must be
so just it must feel
like such a personal awful
experience you have to go through that
so within
a situation where a note is passed in
class it's
you kind of know who it's coming from
and you are
in a group so it isn't
it it's um you're with your peer group
what happens on social media though is
when somebody
metaphorically passes that note they're
completely anonymous
you don't know where that's coming from
and you're not in a peer group there's
only you and your screen
yes so your home is invaded
so your personal space is invaded
there's no way you can go to be safe
[Music]
ironically a lot of people feel safe in
their bedroom but that's also the place
where they will most view their social
media
um and uh you
the the comments that are being made
seem so personal rather than realizing
that that person is just like that to
everybody
in a classroom you know yeah that
person's like that yeah they're really
mean to everyone
um but when it's on screen it's so
personal
because it's like that person's only
being mean to me
and of course when you're in an
environment where you know who it is
who's
projecting that towards you you have
some protection
but when it's so anonymous you don't
really know who that person is you don't
know how old they are you don't know
what they look like you don't know what
their background is you don't know what
their believing values are
it's really demoralizing
it is and i think a lot of people
struggle with that
side of the internet um whether you've
got a following
or you don't and you just have you know
your school friends
and you know your peers and family that
follow you i think
that level of anonymity
that comes with social media is often
it's like a wall has come down and you
don't really know where to go
to feel safe i suppose especially if
you're reading this in your home
when you're at home with your family the
people who do know you and do love you
um i i it can be very
confusing and you can feel a bit
like backed into a corner i suppose so
what can be done about that
no ways that can be help helpful
are taking back our own
personal power we are in charge of
ourselves
so very often people and this is anxiety
very often what people will say
that hurt me that um upset me
that made me feel but actually because
anxiety always feels like it's coming
from outside us
it's really important to say i didn't
like that
but i can choose how i react about it
um it's so important because you don't
have to always like what's happened
but you do have control about how we
feel
and because anxiety is all about feeling
out of control being able to realize
that and make connections with that is
so
important and i think we've used a lot
in the past we've used that thing of
don't invite people into your home
i do this a lot so
when we are you know reading all these
comments or where we're
when we feel so isolated and
whatever it is that we're feeling it's
really important to realize
that we don't know who these people are
and what we're doing is we're actually
letting them come into our private space
it's like we've just invited all these
people we don't know to come through the
front door and
make popcorn and watch our tv show with
us and
and they don't they're not even nice to
us so why would we do that
and it's about closing that down and
it's about being very again centered
within ourselves and taking our own
personal power
to ourselves and realizing as you just
so rightly said a few moments ago
we know the people who care about us we
know the people who love us
they really know us they're the ones who
are important
definitely so for anybody
who and this is just in general now not
necessarily just
uh in terms of social media if somebody
is watching this now
and they're really struggling with their
anxiety
what advice would you give them in terms
of
seeking a therapist or you know
trying to kind of deal with their
feelings a little more
yes i think i think there's a few things
like that
one of them is to realize that you're
not alone
you you're definitely not alone and
everybody
even all these people oh and that's
social media with a comparing and
judging
but everybody feels a
level of anxiety is quite normal
and you you
you're doing anxiety remember that was
one we always use
as well it's not it's happening to you
you're doing it so you can
take control of this and you can learn
and train your mind how to do it
differently
so that's the first step if you are able
to
realize that and do some work on
yourself with some of these things we've
talked about
then that's very good and for some
people that will really work
taking charge of it themselves if
there's
a problem though that's happened perhaps
in the past
or um it's gotten a bit out of control
how you're feeling day to day
then it is really good then to seek
professional help
now those steps of seeking professional
help can seem quite daunting
where do i go who do i speak to how am i
going to speak to someone
sometimes doctors are very good you can
approach a doctor and they
will refer you on um you can sometimes
it's really good if you speak to someone
who has already
spoken to somebody and found they've got
good results from the therapist they've
worked with
so a personal recommendation to someone
is very good
however the social media is brilliant
because there's so much information on
there so
um researching online and finding a
therapist
is for most people
the way to do it and it's really good to
read about that person and read about
um it's not so
testimonials and qualifications all that
help
but it's important to feel that you feel
a rapport with that person
and that you feel that person will
understand you
and sometimes people will and it's good
to narrow it down to three
and then perhaps have a phone
conversation or if you don't like
talking on the phone
send them an email you know a good
therapist will be perfectly happy to
answer your concerns in an email if you
find it difficult to talk on the phone
and then make a selection from there
when you go for a first session
keep it open-ended and what i mean by
that is don't say i'm definitely going
to be working with this person
go along and listen and hear what they
have to say again this is about you
personally taking back control if you
feel you don't get on with that person
that's
fine find someone else sometimes people
work with a therapist
and they will persevere with the
therapist who isn't actually helping
them very much
it's quite okay to say this isn't
working for me and go and find somebody
else
never give up there is help out there go
and find somebody who you can work with
and who you do have a rapport with
who will really be able to understand
you and help you
yeah and i think that don't give up is
so important because
i know and i've i've had many messages
from people
over the years who have said i plucked
up
so much courage to go and speak to this
therapist
and it was awful and i hated talking
about the things they were asking about
and now i'm too scared to find somebody
else or i'm
i don't want to therapy is not for me
they've had one session and they said
no it didn't work and i think it's so
important
as alexis said to never give up and
continue to find that person that works
for you
as much as they are working
you are working with them they are
working with you and it has to work both
ways otherwise you're not going to get
the best results you can get
and there are so many therapists out
there
that there will be somebody that will
work with you and it's worth it and i
think it's also worth pointing out that
sometimes you might only need a few
sessions but
a lot of the time it's gonna take a lot
more work
than maybe some people originally think
like i've been speaking to you for
four and a half five years and i think
obviously i've come such a long way from
first speaking to you
but had i known have known in 2014
that my life would be so different
now as a 30 year old as it than it was
as a 24 year old oh wow six years then
i think so i thought six yeah i did
things at the beginning
i probably would never have guessed it
would take that long
but i also don't think i would have
anticipated such a difference
and i think it's knowing that like you
put in that work
and you really dedicate the time you
will
see the results and it's life-changing
it is life-changing and particularly if
you are young
um and you make that you do something
about it you train your mind from a
young age
and that just keeps going in that new
direction
um and yes we have worked for a lot of
years together
yet for you yours have become very
compounded
for a lot of people it wouldn't
necessarily be
so intense and so difficult however
it's very true what you said there about
having to work hard at it
you must take on board what the
therapist won't do it for you
the therapist is there to guide you and
help you and
share their skill and knowledge but the
person who wants to do something about
their anxiety again i go back to this
personal power
they have to take on board
responsibility for themselves
and they have to practice all the time
because everybody has to learn how to
manage their anxieties it's all about
management
and yeah i like how you always call it
mind management
it is managing your mind it's training
your mind and managing your mind
sometimes i explain it to people um
therapy
that there are probably a lot of very
quick
um or much kind of more simple ways
of very quickly dispersing
anxiety or those anxious feelings like
ripping the top of a weed off you're
just ripping it at ground level but the
roots are still there and it will regrow
and whenever i've explained it like that
to somebody they found that really
useful
because i also encounter a lot of people
who are like
oh yeah sometimes my anxiety is quite
bad but at the moment it's fine
at the moment i don't i like i don't
have an issue and i'm like it's still
in there though probably it's still like
the roots are still there
oh you are so yes that's so true and
this is why
when we talk about the the virus and
covert actually that's not in itself
what's causing anxiety
i always say that's the vehicle it rode
in on
because if you have an underlying
anxiety
you will attach to whatever is happening
so people who say oh i'm okay at the
moment is because yes nothing's
challenging
you at the moment nothing is the seas
are calm there's there's no storm
there's nothing and the way that people
have reacted
to the virus has highlighted for them
areas that they haven't resolved the
roots of something
and there are a lot of quick fix
remedies out there
and all two or three sessions and you'll
be fine
it's not that it it's a
deeper thing than that you need to make
sure that it is probably
properly gone into and solved at that
base yeah definitely so we've sort of
covered anxiety in terms
of cyberbullying anonymity but what
about people who
struggle with social media in a sense of
comparison and uh you know when you're
scrolling through your instagram and
you're like oh that person's
that person's in the maldives and i'm at
home and it's raining and that's making
me feel
not good about myself or my life or
catastrophizing as we know is what i
like to do where one thing feels really
bad and then it's just like my whole
life is really bad um
what would you say about that in terms
of social media and comparison
a couple of things there one uh stacking
which i'll come back to in a second
and comparing and judging what we do as
human beings
is we compare and judge is part of one
of the mind's functions we have to be
able to compare and judge
to know what's going on in the world
around us so
we compare ourselves and that's how we
learn
is we see somebody doing something we
think oh i could do that
and we judge because we need to know
it's it's like two dogs meeting up it's
like when nala meets another dog she's
judging them you know is this going to
be an okay dog or is it not going to be
an okay dog
at least we don't sniff each other's
bottoms we don't do that
that's all yeah that's very true um that
would be a bit weird
so um so we compare and judge where we
go off track though and this again is
where social media
feeds into this is that sometimes we
compare and judge and we make ourselves
less than
we don't feel our own life is okay and
then we start looking at other people's
lives and we feel they have a much
better life than us
we feel we're wrong this often happens
with people
you know if your self-esteem is low
again this sense of myself
isn't enough i'm not good enough i can't
do this
and we forget that if we suddenly
transposed ourselves into that person's
life
we would find out all sorts of things
about that person's life that we
we don't like so people will sometimes
say i'd like to have a lot of money
okay fine yet if you have a lot of money
that in itself will create problems
you know it everything comes with an
anxiety-inducing possibility
there is nothing that is anxiety-free
and if you are an anxious person you
will be anxious living in a big mansion
and worrying about security
as you would be about somebody breaking
into your home
um and stealing your laptop if you just
you know live in a regular home
it you know if if you have a helicopter
and a fleet of cars you'll be worried
about them all being fueled and serviced
and everything just as you would about
your own car and eating an mot
it's all comparative to what our
individual circumstances are
and the thing with social media is too
often we keep transposing ourselves into
other people's lives and imagining that
somehow
they have no worries no concerns no
problems
well of course they do of course they do
everybody does and we lose sight of that
sometimes with social media
um and then the other thing there that
you said so correctly is this thing
about
you start to think um that person looks
much nicer than i do
um i there's this thing of where we pile
one thing on top of another
so i don't look very good i don't have
friends
i don't have a very nice job i'm not
happy in my work and suddenly
you've looked at this one person in a
picture
and you've made all about your life and
how everything is
wrong with your life and now you're
sitting there with this whole lap full
of problems and
issues and worries and that feels so
heavy
and so it's so unnecessary because
we you know it's we've decided that
that's the way our life is which
it isn't at all and it's this thing i'm
okay i'm stacking now
or okay i'm catastrophizing now or okay
i'm worrying now
i need to stop and that's where the
daily practice comes in and
people can just from watching uh this
today
people can start using those tools
straight away
they can start recognizing when they're
making a bigger deal than they need to
they can realize when they're stacking
things one on top of another
yeah yeah and i need to distract myself
right now
is this a worry that is a real worry
that i can do something about and if it
isn't
i need to drop it because i'm just
wasting my life i'm wasting my time
thinking about things that may or may
not ever happen
we wear ourselves out what you also said
about
and i always find this very helpful and
i know one of the
other tools that you taught me was to
externalize
oh yes yes when you become very anxious
or you're having very anxious feelings
you do become a little bit self-absorbed
because
you're thinking so much inside yourself
you're thinking about like i don't feel
right this is worrying me
me me i i and that's just the way that
it works but the minute you think about
what's this person doing i wonder what
they're worrying about today i wonder
where they're going i wonder
if they had a good night's sleep i
wonder what they ate for breakfast
you stop thinking so much about what's
going on in your mind and with your body
if you're physically feeling those
anxious
you know the sweats and the hot and
feeling funny
you think less about that and more about
someone else and then you actually don't
feel it as much because you're not
fueling it the mind's been moved on and
that
that's one of the tools and that's a bit
more of a
slightly complicated one in that it
isn't always easy for people
to take this one on board straight away
but it's the focusing out when focusing
in
and the focusing in when focusing out
so you've described that perfectly there
that's when you're really focusing on
yourself
and then it's like looking at the people
around you
making up stories about them wondering
what they've been doing
and that's the focusing out when you're
focusing in
and then the other way around is also
really helpful especially with social
media
and that's the um focusing inward
when you're focusing too much outward
when you're looking too much about what
other people are doing
too much about other people's lives too
involved in what
other happenings in the world
and it's like no no no no right now i'm
going to just focus on myself i'm going
to bring it
right back to myself what would i like
for my lunch
uh what am i going to wear today um
what what would i like to listen to on
the
uh music or radio or watch
um it's about i'm going to make this
about me now
i'm going to leave all those people to
get on with their lives because i'm not
involved in their lives
and i'm going to just focus really on
myself how i'm feeling what i would like
to do
so yes that's those focusing on focusing
in
you know it's a bit more complicated but
it's really helpful
yeah i've definitely found over the
years
doing that one and practicing that one
as much as possible has really helped me
especially in flight situations because
i remember you saying to me once
even though you have your anxieties
about the flight
there will be somebody next to you who
will
maybe have those similar feelings but it
will be about something completely
different
that wouldn't have phased you and when i
thought about that i thought this entire
plane of people
everybody could have something they're
worrying about
and that really helped me yeah and yeah
some of them won't even be thinking
about the flight
they'll be worried about um whether they
uh lock the back door yeah
you know worry is worry
you know it's if people have a habit of
worrying oh and the other thing the mind
always says is ah but what if this time
it really is a worry
no it's not you're just doing the same
thing that you've always done which is
worry and
you know the mind will trick us it will
go yes but what if this time it really
is a real worry this time
it's like no this is just like all the
thousands of other worries you've had
is just a worry it's just a worry habit
so
