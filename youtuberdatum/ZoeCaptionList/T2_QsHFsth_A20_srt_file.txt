outside in the sun oh yeah we should
hello everybody
just thought i would start this vlog
because i haven't started it yet but i
have been
filming a few little clips i'm here
at joe and diane yo yo yo yo welcome
hey um we don't often come here and just
have like
chilled weekends of like no
work no event no
anything else that we need to be here
for and because alfie and i are paying
you to come this time
i know i'll send you an invoice
afterwards
and alfie and i obviously haven't left
brighton in like
over four months and uh places you could
have gone after lockdowns lifting
a hallway um but no it's so nice the
weather's amazing
and right this is probably your only
holiday of the year
well yeah it probably will be don't say
that that's so sad
isn't it you've got a month left of
technically summer and then it's done
no actually when we were in the park
earlier we noticed there's some autumn
leaves
floating down already conquer trees are
turning
orange um so yeah
i love the autumn color palette in fact
i did say oh this would be a lovely park
in autumn
um so yeah that's what we're doing we're
here for the weekend just to have a nice
time
hang out spend some time out of brighton
oh tonight all right i reckon
outdoor cinema oh my feet do i have to
i've done it and it's actually pretty
nice hold my ankle
why is this a game smell alfies
they smell of nothing no you're nothing
you're smarter i reckon yours will smell
your smells of salt oh god yours smells
of like
actual washing powder really yeah
it's whoa that's very good flexibility
do that again let's see no i don't think
i can
like i can put it behind my head i could
not do that i have very tight hip joints
i can't do that because he can do it too
yeah joe can chew his own toenails
i'm pretty sure i can see behind my head
we're going now to combat gardening
[Laughter]
what's that called that roundabout
wellington arch
it's not i don't think it's even a
roundabout it's just wellington arch is
like
such a big we thought that we would
instead of jumping around in different
taxis all day
um obviously we have our masks and we
have our hand sanitizer and as much as
possible we are all being very very safe
we thought it would be better for us to
drive around
um in our own vehicle but driving
in central london just isn't my favorite
so alfie is designated uber driver today
you don't mind it but there is that one
roundabout the one roundabout that
actually put me off
driving around london which has got like
how many lanes like
a lot five lanes and like six exits
it's the wellington arch roundabout i
feel like if people
live or use london use london come to
london a lot you'll know the exact
roundabout i mean
we started off this morning we went for
breakfast to a lovely park and it was
lovely lovely lovely lovely and then we
drove over to fulham and we went to
flavourtown bakery which is the
amazing bakery that has done literally
all of our birthday cakes we
first one was joe's strictly cake for
his birthday
yeah yeah and then you and then me
and then diane yeah you've had a few
i've had a few yeah
we've all had a few we've had the
antoine and the rest of uh
exactly shout out um we just love them
they're great and we wanted to come
and support them after covid so we
headed down
we've never been into the actual shop so
we wanted to go in
[Music]
so cake we've got carrot chocolate
truffle
bourbon which is wow chocolate sponge
with chocolate custard in the middle and
chocolate icing
medium chocolate last slice of rainbow
red velvet oreo
rainbow sprinkle cake which has got like
um it's vanilla and it's got vanilla
cheese
okay inside with different colors in it
and then we've got red velvet cracker
sandwiches
black chocolate cookies milk chocolate
cookies fanfetti chocolate cookies and
those
of reese's peanut butter chips in them
and raspberry
brownies yeah i was eyeing that one up
that looks insane
that's um that's brownie caramel
nougat and chocolate that's salted
caramel that's gluten free and these are
something
that um chloe our kitchen manager
learned how to make when she worked in
australia
and it's like a billionaire slice the
base is like a blunt
okay let's make some decisions
and now we've come back had a little
recharge
joe's had a poo i've got rid of anyone
the one who makes it sells it the one
who buys it
never uses it the one that uses it never
knows that he's using it
what is it say it one more time
the one who makes it sells it the one
who buys it
never uses it the one that uses it never
knows that he or she
is using it what is it no
do you got any of you guys know the one
that makes it
the one that makes it the one who makes
it sells it the one who buys it
never uses it the one that uses it never
knows
that they're using it what the hell
it's actually really easy one who buys
it right the only makes it sells it
yeah it makes it sells it yeah when he
buys it never uses it
the one that uses it doesn't know that
what's the first one again one who makes
it sells it
can we get some clues is it a person or
an object
i feel like we'll get it if we give us a
minute object someone will get it yeah
the one who makes this object sells it
the one who buys it doesn't use it robot
the one that does use it no the one that
does use it
doesn't know they're using it i think
it's that last bit that's the key
what is something we don't know we're
using is it is it just that it's like
second nature
no oh toilet no
i i i mostly know when i'm using the
toilet
i don't know about you at one point the
person who makes it would have actually
ended up using
using it at one point would or would it
it's made out of wood paper
newspaper because you know you're using
toilet paper or not newspaper
no because you know that you're using it
what don't you know if you're using
food how how would you not know
what would have to happen to you to not
know that you're using something
it's something to do with sleep dreaming
yeah it's going to be some kind of like
putting you to sleep device kind of like
like medication is it not no
you have to just say i can't handle
riddles i have to google them
yeah when he makes it sells it so
there's someone who makes these objects
i bet i bet there's so many comments now
of everyone being like how do you not
know what this is
it makes these objects um as a career is
to make these objects
is it a very it's someone who's buying
it
not for themselves no they're buying
this object optimally makes them
to use for someone else
what no i have no idea oh i'm just
trying to trick you
no i have no idea and at some point
they're gonna need one
at some point your family they're gonna
need one of these
potentially if you decide to go on that
route
come on i'm giving you all the clues oh
okay like a mobility scooter
no but you're you know you're you're
kind of on the right line a car
no that's oh
the one who makes it sells it the one
who buys it never uses it they're never
going to use it
because it's for someone else i will i
will no but they don't know they're
using it
coffin yes
yeah the one who buys it never uses it
you want to use it never know they're
using it
oh that was so simple
that was so simple and you smashed it i
can't believe that well done that was
great

loved it it's so funny um the teams
on friday were me and mark versus joe
[Music]
what are you doing let me see oh god
um but this time we're gonna do me and
diane versus
joe and alfie because i think we'll be
able to tell when they're lying
i always say one of my actually yeah i
always say one of my
special skills is to be able to tell
when someone is lying
which is why i always think that i can
be
[Laughter]
which is why i always think that i would
be a good detective
um but we're gonna have a little try now
so
we'll see i think we'll win but you know
your mum go on then in portugal it is
considered rude
to write a letter in red ink or
a shed
um
[Music]
for sure red ink
rude to write in a shed oh yeah no i
mean red ink
yeah yeah i meant ready reading the
truth is ready yeah
in portugal it's considered rude to
write a letter in red ink
or a shed red
ink yes
what made you say shed yeah
[Laughter]
that was quick it was quick it was quick
it was quick okay
yeah we need to go quick four four
one two three four ring of truth there
you go out there
cool okay we need a pencil don't we okay

[Music]
oh we've had that one we've had that
before
so emma stone convinced her parents
to let her take up acting by showing
them
a musical a script of a musical she
wrote
yeah a recording of her drama lessons
a powerpoint presentation
oh powerpoint draken that'd be quite
funny
i feel like these guys wouldn't write
powerpoint because
that's too weird like i think it was
i think the first one well she wrote and
we just
got in the truth what what who do you
miss stunning never been interviewed
i've never seen it
presentation i feel like that one
what do you think i think i don't think
it's that was the second one
a recording of her drama lessons
like that's quite often you wouldn't
need to convince your
parents to make you an actress if you've
already if they're
they're already paying you to go drama
lessons it's like why would i have drama
less why would we pay for drama lessons
if you don't which i mean so i don't
think it's that one so it's your
powerpoint presentation
or the first one i um
feel like the first one is quite funny
whatever that one was again what was it
a script of a musical she wrote yeah
that could be quite good
they might look like oh she's you know
actually put some effort in fair dudes
and you both read my face when i say
that
but no it's a powerpoint presentation
you sure yeah looking at him
powerpoint presentation sure yeah
yeah emma stone convinced her parents
to let her take over acting by showing
them
a powerpoint
do you know what and i spoke about me
making powerpoint presentations in the
past joe so i thought maybe that would
throw you off alfie you'll go

through it i'm just worried that you
might be this is a picture of the white
house
yeah the white house and the playboy
mansion were the first two buildings
to have an airport
why is there a picture of just the white
house and not the playboy mansions but
random
just as the white house well we're not
sure the playboy mansion as well
tonight also an airport everyone's got
like

before that is such a lie the best
ever to

yeah but yeah um but like an airport in
a house like

really hard

twisters
in american sign language are called
finger fumblers no tell me now what they
think about the picture
the version of tongue twisters in sign
language are called finger fumblers
right if you sign language read laurier
you'll be called a finger fumbler right
um the picture the picture someone's
getting
fumbled it's of um someone pointing at
their thumb
he's actually telling the truth i reckon
because he's trying to pull us off
by laughing and saying like i'm sorry
you know like the yellow sorry yellow
yeah
i love once i take this it's true it's
true

you think
the equivalent of tongue twisters the
american side 100 true
i call it abundance yes yeah it's true
okay yeah let me tell you
that it is true
i could see it once you held it up you
didn't see this but before they wish me
