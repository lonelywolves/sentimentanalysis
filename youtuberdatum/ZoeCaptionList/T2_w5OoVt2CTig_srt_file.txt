good morning it's been a hot one for
those of you that don't live in the uk
we have had all mother of heat waves but
for the uk
we're not equipped for this weather we
don't have air con
in houses look i've already got a
solar sweaty upper lip alert um we don't
have air con in houses which is
probably uh the noise you can hear in
the background that's the fan that we
have on that's
basically circulating warm air so
for a lot of people here it's unbearable
because there's nothing you can do to
combat the heat apart from
sit in your car with the aircon on so
yeah it's been
it's been a tough week in terms of
trying to stay motivated and having the
energy when
um it's been very hot
all the same i do love this warm weather
and because we've not had a holiday
anywhere that's you know known for its
lovely weather
it's nice to have it and to sit out in
it
much nicer when there's a bit of a
breeze though i'm definitely one for a
breeze
and there's been none of that but we are
due some thunderstorms which will
probably
break through and ease off the humidity
because
it is warm i think you can tell from my
face
that looks like highlighter probably
mostly sweat
we finished filming for the campaign
that we've been working on
with lush and i am whole
uh which is i don't know if any of you
have seen the footage
i think it was the start of last year
where i went down to the lush
offices in pool there's my little feet
looking kind of dirty and i've
showered this morning
and was creating a bath bomb so that's
all coming together that was meant to
happen earlier on the year
as we all know a lot of things got
pushed back so
this was one of them but we're finally
wrapping up on a lot of those things so
it'll be really exciting to get to share
some more information
around that with you soon oh i wish i'd
taken my vlog camera out last night
after filming we went to the beach and
i invited like lots of girls from the
office down and we all sat on the beach
was just it was really nice
just chilling uh everybody else had the
same idea
the beach was
full of people still socially distanced
um but there was a lot of people out
because it was the perfect evening
the sea i can only describe it as like
milky and i hope you know what i mean
when i say that like
i think it was the reflection of the
sunset on the water and it was so
still um it was so nice we went paddle
boarding which is my new favorite thing
to do
i'm not a water sports gal as you know
i also don't like swimming in the sea i
don't know if i've ever talked about
this but
i'm happy to swim in an in an ocean
where i can
see what's in the sea
if i can see the bottom if i can see
around me
crystal clear water basically but
in the sea in the uk where it's like
murky once you get in up to your knees
and you can't see anything and it's cold
and
you don't really know what's around you
even though i know we don't have scary
things in our water
but i just i don't know the ocean creeps
me out
there's too many things in there that we
don't know we don't
it's too fast we don't know enough about
what's in there
and i've watched one too many ocean
[Music]
horror films so i don't like going in
the sea but
two things that have made going in the
sea
enjoyable for me wearing trainers wear
your old
beaten up trainers into the sea
especially here because we have
pebbles and rocks we don't have sand in
brighton so
it's very uncomfortable but also half
the time you're like have i just stood
on something sharp or was that stone
and you don't really know so wearing
trainers that you don't mind getting wet
or dirty
has made a huge difference to me i
actually enjoyed going in
second thing paddleboarding you don't
always fall in with paddleboarding and i
have not fallen in yet i did try and
stand up
once wobbled and sat back down so
when you see people paddleboarding and
it looks so graceful across the sea
i'm like how how do you do that for
those of you
who might be watching this who paddle
board standing up and you make it look
so graceful and easy how are you doing
that because
either i have the worst balance in the
world or it's much harder than you make
it look so we did a bit of paddle
boarding and the sun was
setting and it was beautiful and it was
just really nice to be out doing
something
semi-normal with people it was nice
and i wish i'd filmed it but i'll pop a
little picture up on my on my instagram
of
me and maddie paddleboarding it was so
much fun and then today
myself and alfie are planning to get out
and do something
i don't know what yet but it's a really
lovely day and we're about to hit
thunderstorms and although it is hot
and a lot of people are complaining i
want to make the most of it still
i'm in two minds i hate it and i love it
it's complicated
so we're gonna go out make the most of
it
uh have a nice morning and then i've got
some work stuff that i need to do when i
get back
but yeah i just thought it would be a
nice day to vlog because it's probably
going to be the last sunny day for a
long time so
also wearing this dress which i feel
like
might be a bit um i feel like it might
be a bit much just to
you know go to a beach or potter around
but
this is a dress that i saw my friend tan
wearing and i
instantly fell in love with it it's by
realization par
and the minute i saw her wearing it i
put my email in for when it comes back
in stock let me know because i want it
and i love it a little bit see-through i
don't know if you can see
i don't think you can but you can see my
pants through it alfie just told me so
there's that but i really like it and i
might wear it with
converse just to i don't know casual it
out a bit because
i i feel like this maybe doesn't work as
a casual dress but i feel like tarn made
it look like a casual dress so
i don't know i'll leave you wearing this
or i'll change but it's so thin and
light that it's
nice to wear anyway so just popped you
in here while i do my pre
sort myself out before i'm about to walk
out into
tropical weather um so i'm gonna do a
little bit
probably a little bit more powder using
the colourpop one
just a little brush i'm gonna put you
over here because that back lighting is
terrible um
as i was saying i'm using the colourpop
powder
um and i mostly just have to
i have to do around the nose the top lip
the chin the chin is my
nemesis basically my t-zone
my t-zone is the first place that gets
oily it is also the first place
that i sweat and under my eyes as well
when i did my makeup this morning i also
used my iconic prep set glow spray
um which actually when i first put it on
made me look
very illuminating um
but thankfully as it dried it's
much better also still loving and using
my native deodorants
as i mentioned when i'm having to like
bend over because i'm too tall for this
tutorial this area
um as i mentioned last time i worked
with them i
was always an aerosol gal and um
so many of you kept saying to me switch
up your aerosol for something
like a stick or a roll-on and
i finally caved and i have been using
native ever since
i love it they are not sticky um very
fast drying and they last really well
but also
the fragrance is really long-lasting too
which i love and they're also really
nice fragrances this one is my current
fave this is
cotton and cedarwood but they have so
many they are all vegan they're all
cruelty free they're free of sulfates
parabens
and aluminium as well your armpits
well thank you i'm just going to do a
little top
up i literally just have them all
stacked in my
bathroom i think i've got like every
cent so if you were to buy three of
their classic deodorants they would
usually cost you 36
but if you would like to get your hands
on three new cents or give them a try
or see what the brand has to offer then
you can use my code zone
two which i will leave in the
description box
and you can get three for 24 which means
you are getting 33
off also worth remembering that native
um
shipped to the uk the usa australia
canada brazil
france and germany but again
i'll leave all the information in the
description box so let me know if you
try them out
highly recommend love them use them
every day and
they've seen me through this heat wave
which trust me
is a good sign of a deodorant even
though i just powdered
i'm already sweating again
it's just gonna be one of those days
alfie and i are in the car
and we have decided to go to the beach
basically on our lunch break
so we're gonna stop off and get some
picnic bits
and then just go and find a nice little
patch
on the beach and sit and eat lunch it's
our last chance we can
yeah i know so the bad weather hits
exactly
but also i did put half of my bikini the
lower half of my bikini in my bag
just in case and alfie also brought his
shorts
just in case we want to get in i just
feel like we might be sat there
eating a bit of french stick get too hot
and have to get in sorry it's cause it's
trying
yeah i just feel like it might get too
hot so you never know
we'll see how we go bad well how bad is
it because it is bad
for i've gone in the sea three days in a
row
and i've won the same swim shots every
time and i haven't washed them
they're pretty smelly pretty salty yeah
i don't know
and i'm about to do it for the fourth
time i don't know if that's great do you
not own any other swim shorts
i do they're just not my favorite you
just like those ones yeah
i think you'll be all right have you let
them dry since yesterday
oh no i still left them in the bag every
time that's what i mean they're pretty
gross
oh i think i'm gonna get that on your
patreon
i don't know possibly find out
also you might notice i changed my dress
i just felt like it was too formal
for lunch on the beach in our lunch
break
i want to save it for for another day so
i've just whacked on my
trusty cheap monday t-shirt dress that
i've had for years and years
that i love and wear all the time i need
to get some more t-shirt dresses because
i do wear this so much and i love like
the length and the style and the fit and
they're so
cozy and they're great for like this
time of year
with sandals or sliders but also i wear
them
in autumn with my leather jacket and my
boots so if you know anywhere
that does because i feel like do you
cheat monday a cheap monday still around
i want to say are they i thought or
maybe they closed their stores but
something happened
um yeah i just love a good t-shirt dress
i like that this one has quite a high
neck too i don't know let me know if
you've got any t-shirt dress
recommendations we are at the beach
we stopped off and grabbed some lunch
bits
i was dying for a french stick so we've
got french stick and some brie
and alfie got some much healthier
options
no not really
we've got bananas actually yeah very
healthy very healthy
i've been honest at the moment i'm gonna
put brie
in my french stick with what else
with forgetting the other ingredient
the vital ingredient
salt and vinegar crisps
and if you haven't tried it you need to
try it
[Music]
you might be thinking zoe how come
you're okay to
take your shoes off and have your feet
in the sand and why is alfie still got
shoes on
my biggest pet peeve of the beach
is sound on my feet what will you do if
we go in the sea then
yeah then i just have to really like dry
them off with my towel
like yes it's quite an ordeal
i would rather get sand in my mouth than
on my feet
that's weird isn't it
it's not handled alfie's contemplating
whether to put his feet in order
it's nice it's refreshing
look at that sunset
beautiful alfie and i are now at
brighton beach
to meet steve and some of alfie's other
friends who have been doing a massive
cycle for charity
and i think they come in like now i
don't know
they're meant to be coming in now but
we're coming to meet them
[Applause]
yay
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
good morning it's actually
the day you're watching this because as
i was editing my vlog i was like i
totally forgot to film yesterday and
that was my plan
because it just feels very unnatural for
me to edit one day as a vlog because
i've been doing so many
stitched together days as my vlogs that
i just wanted to add a little bit more
in just with what we're up to today
it's a very rainy
but quite cozy sunday and i hope you
guys are all having a lovely weekend as
well
i'm gonna have a makeup free i actually
spent a little bit more time on my
skincare routine this morning i
thoroughly enjoyed it i whacked the
waitress soundtrack on
singing along doing the double cleanse
popping on some eye
masks doing a lovely serum
and a very super hydrating moisturizer
so
that's essentially all we've done today
so far it is a very
lazy sunday but as i said
also very cozy we've got harry potter on
we've got the candles on
i feel happy that our grass and our
plants are having a good old drink
whoa it is really raining now
no no we're all closed and actually look
it's not coming in
i'm not gonna lie there's a part of me
that wants to go out and stand in it
but i think i just heard some thunder so
i'm gonna assume
this is one of many days this week where
we're going to have
rain like this and thunder but it's
actually not that cold
it's look at it out
yeah but it's quite nice like stand here
the grass is going to be so happy oh my
gosh yeah
also i was planning on us filming here
oh
i think the audio might not be the best
it would just be cozy
you absolutely dare oh my god i love it
i probably should shut the door though
because it is
kind of coming in now
oh my god oh no
absolutely so from like literally two
seconds
[Music]
alfie's just made some lunch and i was
just about to tidy this away
and i thought it was worth mentioning to
you because i don't think i vlogged it
or put it anywhere
um but me and poppy and our friend
alexia
made little clay pots these ones are
actually poppies i hope she doesn't mind
me showing them
um and she did this one too a little
baby
did i what did you remove the glass from
the pantry
yeah i put the spider outside oh it's
gonna say did you know there was the
biggest spider in there did you see it
yeah it was huge like it was really like
fast and really funny yeah
i know i was breaking let it free in the
house no
and then this is the one i did i
actually did a little hole through the
nipple so that i could put one of my
earrings through it
like a tiny little um
[Music]
hoop and then i did this little booby
pinch pot
um but as i was just about to like tidy
them awake they've been sat on this
table for ages
i just thought i would show you it
basically
again another instagram ad i just get so
sucked into these ads
but i actually bought myself one and i
bought poppy one for her birthday
and it's by a brand called sculpt
and it comes in this box which already
is cute um
and i mean i don't know what state this
is going to be in because
we've already used it but it comes with
a little um
jute bag with the tools in
so you get a variety of different tools
and
you get a little guide that shows you
how to make a pinch pot or a plant pot
so i tried both i did the pinch pot
which was this one
and then this one is a plant pot which
you have to have like a proper
bottom for that one was a bit harder um
but it was so much fun i just thought
for any of you that are stuck at home
i don't know you want something to do
you've got someone coming over and
obviously
you can't go out and do your usual stuff
might be worth looking into this then it
also comes with two big bags of the clay
i really think i only think these two
things
i used up like two-thirds of one bag
so you can you get a lot out of it and
two paint brushes some white paint
and some sealant and
some um sandpaper
which is actually the next bit we have
to do does that make you feel funny
it makes oh man so yeah
that's how far we've got alexia actually
makes
very cool boob pots which i will leave a
link to because
they are great she sells those on etsy i
don't know we were just having a girls
night weren't we
i wasn't invited yeah alfie wasn't
invited none of the boys were invited
and the three of us
sat and made pottery and me and poppy
both use these so
if you're after a new fun thing to do
check it out um i don't know what me and
poppy are going to do with them
now though i guess the next stage next
time they come round
we can sand them down and then paint
them
and seal them i don't know how i'll
paint this one everyone took the mickey
out of my pot because the boobs looked
so massive and like
juicy no i'm sure i understand
wow serious hey siri everyone took the
mickey out of my cast
because so massive and juicy why did
your siri get
i don't know um triggered by my your
boobs because it's so big and juicy
um but yeah just thought it was worth
sharing that while i
or i don't want to damage poppies there
we go
just thought i'd move them out the way a
bit and just like that
the sun is out
isn't it it was raining earlier
now it's really sunny which is good
because
we're about to go on a doggy walk amanda
and nick are popping over our way
with buzz and we are going to head out
take nala on a walk because it was so
hot last week she didn't go on many
walks
um because it was just too hot at any
time of the day
um to take her out so we took her on one
yesterday on the beach
and we'll take her on one now although i
don't know if i'll really need a hoodie
because
it's actually quite warm alpaca licked
her face right there
okay walk is done i am now going to
import all the footage i have of today
and try and get this video
up for you this evening so i hope you've
had a lovely sunday whatever you've done
