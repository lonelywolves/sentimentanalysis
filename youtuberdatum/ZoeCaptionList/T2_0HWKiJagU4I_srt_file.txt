good morning good morning sorry i'm
eating a domino cookie
i can almost feel myself
doing this thing where i like
retract a bit and i'm like i don't know
what to share or what to talk about or i
feel like i've already shared so much of
my life
that there's nothing left i always go
through phases of this
i'm so uninteresting there is nothing
for me to give
i think i feel more like that now
because
digital detox day has happened and
that's been such a huge
focus for so long that it's been and
gone and done and now i'm like
who am i what am i what what am i
working on now
truth is i have a lot to be working on
um but
yeah i don't know i think sometimes it's
like
i don't know that come down of working
on something really exciting and it
happening and then
kind of readjusting how your work and
life balances without that thing
this might not make any sense or it
might make total sense to you
um but yeah i can feel myself like not
wanting to post on stories and being
like i don't know what to share
i don't know what to give you blow dried
my hair this morning
but i don't actually have time to curl
it so i've just left it straight and in
a ponytail
i'm gonna be going on a walk with sid
hmm
poppy and sean are on their way over and
we are gonna go for a little morning
walk
nice way to start the day with the dogs
it's actually such a lovely day today
it's kind of
chilly but really sunny which is like my
favorite although next week i think
we're having
another summer burst so we'll get one
more bit of summer before
um autumn comes in full swing
i'm just feeling especially after our
day that me and mark had the other day
where we were
um really cozy and watching all to me
christmas films
i'm like really craving that like
that colder crispier like mornings and
um lighting the candles i actually
placed a bath and body work
body walks body works order yesterday
um so hopefully that will arrive in the
next couple of weeks it sucks me in
every year and i
end up with so many candles and i never
have enough time to burn them but
i'm too into
the new fragrances like i must smell
them so i've got
a fun couple of days um chilled but fun
that's it that's my that's my morning
update should we go for a walk
should we go for a walk
would you like that we're gonna see
sydney we see sydney
and poppy and
shawnee shawnee
poppy sydney
i apologize if you have a dog that could
hear that vlog
and was also doing this
i think it's just the tone of voice
because if i say
walk walk let's go for a walk
should we go for a walk there you go
let's get your harness on
and your lead on it's beautiful
um but we've just noticed this little
field where um poppy and sean train
sydney for recall has some sheep in it
that aren't supposed to be in here
they've come through what are those
gates called um
well yeah they're supposed to keep them
in the fields they're basically hard to
get through with them i know
i call them kissing gates but i don't
think that's
i mean i don't think that's the
technical term for it but they've
somehow pushed themselves through
they're obviously trying to get back
through otherwise they'd just be
chilling in this field
but they're still they're still standing
by the gate so alfie's going to see if
he can try and
rescue them back into the field farmer
alfie i hope i have to pick one up and
like put it over the fence
i'm not sure that it will let you do you
know what though i think nala might
scare it
i'll leave you i'll leave our coffees
there alfie
alfie that's that's not what you were
supposed to do
we need a sheep dog
did it go through
no
oh i know that's some sheep update
basically sean and alfie managed to get
them in
but that was hard because that type of
gate is not easy to get sheep through
but they've been reunited i did help get
two through
yeah you did yeah i helped hold the gate
but that was harder than i thought it
was going to be
yeah look at poppy with the dogs
what's not got no i don't have anything
come here sit down sit down canal is
just
watching her that's it sydney
where's lala oh no you don't need to go
for the vagina
they look so different
you don't know what this is i've no idea
what that is what's clay's
literally no idea clays
yeah like new plates shut up i was
not expecting this today candles
what have you ordered autumn stuff i
feel like the only thing that can get
you this excited is like autumn
halloween or christmas
so it has to be something to do with
those things
bath products
gravel for the drive
[Laughter]
new travel for the new gravel for the
driveway oh my gosh
purple as well this is the um
uncorrected bound proof that we can send
it
yo that's crazy so this isn't what the
actual
cover will look like but this is the
proof cover isn't that cool
that is so i love the size of it look
how many i've got
you can read it now if you wanted
 i'm actually going to start reading
this today
look at that on the side zoe and amy
that's cool that's such a sick picture
yo it's a meaty book isn't it
uncorrected
bound proof
cool bit more exciting than gravel
yeah just a bit and just so you can get
a closer look
look at that so these won't be available
um for anybody to get
these are just um the ones that we send
out to authors and
like friends and stuff so that they can
read um
give it a read before it's properly
printed
i've i need to text amy i wonder if
she's had hers was this
today this arrived yeah literally a
minute ago
oh my god amy's haven't arrived yet
because she's out so she said show me so
i'm gonna facetime her quickly
although if she's out she might not be
able to answer
[Music]
hello hello i just thought i was like oh
god she's out she might not be able to
face time
yeah i'm sorry i'm trying to find
someone where there's like not blaring
music so i'm just at a lunch spot but
anyway
are you ready yeah i'm ready so here's
the box
oh my gosh
look so cool i love her like reverse
image
it's so cool isn't it oh my god
do they look look is it like foiled or
anything
it's got um do you see the little birds
in the light
oh they're like in the lamina yeah and
then look at this
oh my god it's like a real book oh my
god
that's so cool i know oh my god it's
like a physical thing
how big is it is it like feel chunky
it's like it doesn't look quite
yeah it's like a good amount of chunky
yeah not too daunting no not too bad
no i love it amazing
and the chapters look so much smaller
in yeah i'm like oh my god like two
pages of chapter 10.
great quick chapters yes well that'll be
good a speedy read
yeah exactly yeah it's so cool we're
gonna start reading it soon now now
i know so does that mean they've sent
them out to everybody on our list as
well
i think so i think so and they'll be
getting that today
i guess so but yeah
it's real it's a physical thing yay
actually you know what i'm thinking it's
only like
seven weeks or something until it
actually comes out i know it's gonna
it's next month
yeah it's next month that's crazy
oh my gosh but yeah it just feels so
real i saw the clay's box on the side we
just had a delivery and i was like
i was like oh what was the delivery that
i saw a clay's box and i was like
oh my god like i just had forgotten that
this was gonna come soon
i know i think it looks really cool
though i think it looks like suitably
different
yeah enjoy your lunch just thought i'd
bring you and show you
see you soon bye bye shall i read you a
bit of
one of my chapters this room is cursed i
say pushing my way around the tall
white blonde slightly fragile looking
new girl in the doorway
be kind my mum's words ring in my ears
lola's awful accident at the start of
the summer is already making this year
difficult enough
but it's hard to be kind when i'm about
to meet the girl i'm giving up my
privacy for
and it's especially hard to be kind when
everything about her screams that we
won't get along
in one hand she's got an oversized
smartphone with a pink fluffy case and
over her shoulder is a flashy designer
bag
it must be freezing outside but she has
flip-flops on
i don't like to pass judgment on someone
before talking to them but she's making
it too easy
because it's so weird to think that like
whilst you were writing that
then what was i doing
what do you think i'm
but everybody has their own style of
writing in their own way to express
themselves like
there's no right or wrong way that just
sounds like a proper book doesn't it
well i
it's cool that you did alternate
chapters as well yeah
that's sick yeah like did she write
chapter one then you wrote up two then
she wrote chapter three then
then you wrote chapter four or were you
writing chapters without with her bit
missing
sometimes if i was like busy doing
something else that week and i couldn't
do a chapter
she would skip ahead and do because we
would have yeah we planned out
written that bit yeah no we planned out
chapter by chapter and bullet points
yeah yeah so we knew what would happen
in each chapter so then i would get my
characterizations on like yeah massive
boards and stuff so i would get my
chapters
and i would but we kept we would then
just have to be like oh actually amy i
made them
do this so that doesn't make sense with
your chapter so then we would just edit
it
yeah there was loads of things we
changed even up to the last minute
we were changing stuff well you have to
because you might just i know but now
i'm
now i panic because i'm like i don't
know if i want to read this like this in
case i spot something that i'm like
oh we should have changed that or like
is it always going to be something
yeah it's true i'm such like a
perfectionist that i could be working on
this for like 10 years and i still
wouldn't like
feel like it was at a point but it's
like one of those things if you were
designing
i don't know a t-shirt to sell
for a clothing brand and you were like
oh i don't want to do the purple or the
red
whichever one you chose no one will ever
see the other one
yeah do you know what i mean should i
start reading it today if you have time
i don't think it would take you long i
do
i don't think it will take you not with
this wedding yeah
it's so exciting you join us
a little later having a little clay
session
alfie bought this little gadget um
online
and it's like a tiny potter's wheel
and we're having a little go honestly
we've probably been sat here for an hour
already
it's so therapeutic
i mean neither of us have any clue what
we're doing but it's so much fun
i think that's why it's fun yeah taking
it very seriously and also
like it's quite experimental like you're
not trying to create a specific thing
so this was alfie's first attempt
oops which didn't go so well
this was mine my little pot that i made
then alfie's other pot was like a tiny
heart pinch pot
and then this was my egg cup but now
it's looking like a bowl alfie you've
totally changed the shape
but you control the speed here
and you know what it's
actually really fun what i might do on
this to counteract
our lack of ability
it's good like this at the end
or maybe not might do it when it's a
little bit more dry oh the heart
no just wobble it a bit on purpose like
that
what do you think yeah lovely i don't
know what you'd put in it
but maybe let go and then let it
yeah because you don't want it that
tight because you wouldn't be able to
put anything in it
lovely now we've just got to try and get
it off
it looks a bit like a beak
i quite like that lovely
i think if we smooth out the bottom like
this
and then that's actually quite sick that
ah that's cute you probably could use
that as an egg cup
i mean what egg's gonna go what quails
egg no but like the bottom of it might
sit in that bit
i mean that's cool yeah it looks like a
little bit of coral
it is the most glorious evening
just been sat outside finishing up olive
which is
our zoella book club book for august
um and obviously now that we are into
september the review of that has just
gone up and
the september book for any of you that
join along
is queenie so that's what i'm moving on
to next
i have done something to my back i sound
like a 90 year old
but i've done something to it and it
feels so tight on one side like that
when i pull it round
i need to be doing all the stretches
so i'm super excited to chat to you in
this um
section of the video about a
company that i have partnered with and
they are called
a good company alfie and i are both
working with them which is
really exciting and it's been
so great getting to know them as a
company
and try out their products so a good
company are a climate positive
carbon negative company hello
she's joining in alfie and i have had
lots of their products in our house over
the last couple of months
and they just do such
great like everyday items that you
wouldn't even realize you could change
up to actually make
a bigger impact yeah so they do your
everyday items from things like
notebooks pens toilet paper floss
clay paint bamboo toilet paper at the
moment also things just like
i suppose it's just everyday objects
like notepads
but the notepads they have made from
rock yeah it's basically switching out
alternatives whenever you can in your
life
if you're able to to equivalent products
that are positive like not neutral
positive for the environment and it's
not
saying get rid of every bit of plastic
in your life because that's incredibly
difficult and that'll be amazing
to do one day about making small changes
where you can isn't it
and i didn't even realize the amount
that i could make
without seeing this like even so this is
a really good example
pens for me the amount
of pens we have lying around in drawers
that are just all plastic something
so simple that we all purchase and
repurchase
this one is designed to be a throwaway
product yeah the cheap pens that you buy
are designed to just be thrown away
after you use them they're not reusable
so this pen is made out of meadow
like grass isn't that cool
it took them six months to design yeah
and it's made out of meadow grass
and recycled bpa free plastic
yeah so it's like and also you can
refill it as well and you can refill
that
just right away but also it's a nice pen
i'm gonna leave their website below it's
a good.com
and also go on over and check out their
instagram um see what you think of the
products
if there's anything that you would order
or replace
um with anything that you're running out
of that you currently buy if you see the
owner anderson is
on the instagram go show him some love
he is the nicest
guy so lovely and we've been on so many
like
zoom calls and everything with him i
also think that they should go over to
the website and like
the loveliest read up on the story
behind the company read up on anders and
what he's all about
and also because they're such a
transparent company they literally give
all the information behind every product
it's so
eye-opening and educational at the same
time i've really enjoyed
yeah if that's if that's a bit of you go
and check it out because
it's great also the clay that alfie and
i just used for our pots
that was from a good company they have
lots of really lovely creative bits on
there just as a little example this is
one of their phone cases and this is
made out of linseed plant waste which is
grown
by local farmers in sweden so
100 compostable but also they have a
really cool system where
if you decide you want to change up your
phone case you can send this back
before you get a new one so that this
one can be recycled and made into
another phone case for someone else
just little things like that that i just
think are so cool they also
plant a tree every time a phone case is
sold
we've technically planted a tree here
then
and two trees i like that as alfie said
earlier this notebook is made out of
stone so the paper is not tree
i have to be careful here because i've
got a lot of um
like book notes in here you know what
that means it's 100 waterproof
you can literally pour water yeah also
i've never written on anything like this
in my life but it is the softest most
satisfying writing experience
to write on stone paper um it does also
mean as alfie said you could pour an
entire
thing of water on here and it just rolls
off which is
so cool are you actually going to do it
no you don't have to
go on then i just don't want to get it
on you
right can you see this
just tip it off
this rolls off you could probably see
all of my like
private to-do list there as well as i
said
go on over and check out the website
such an amazing company i love what
they're doing
and i feel like so many of you will too
i just wanted to show everybody what our
dog does when we go to
when we go to feed her she's already
doing it i put this on my story this
morning i was like does anyone else's
dog but like
she spins so much sometimes
that i'm like you're going to actually
look at her she just sends it
but i don't know why she does more in
the morning
but it's not like if she spins we then
ever give we've never taught her to spin
wait there we
one of our friends taught her to spin
for a treat what
four years ago five years ago
i think it's excitement yeah like if you
have a dog that does that please let me
know
why you think they do it because we've
never taught her spin for food i think
they just can't control it
like she's just so excited she doesn't
know what to do with herself genuinely
sometimes
in the mornings she does it more maybe i
should film her tomorrow morning
she spins so fast over and over and over
that i literally have to hold her
in case she like gets dizzy and like
falls or something well like her brain
like
spills out because i'm just like you
can't do that
that's not normal i am currently
cooking dinner still doing our gusto
and with tonight we're having red pepper
risotto
it says with herb rolled goat's cheese
but i'm not a fan of goat's cheese so
that's
staying out of the dish
i have to say one thing that
i have learnt how to cook in lockdown
that i never cooked before
is risotto i always thought it was one
of those
meals that was really difficult to cook
so i just
never attempted it a meal i love to eat
though it's delicious
and we've cooked so many in lockdown i
feel like it's been like
our lock down dinner of choice basically
um but yeah it's been it's been nice
learning how to cook from scratch a bit
more
one thing i've also learned is
my tummy
does not like too much
garlic i just
too much garlic and then it completely
ruins the meal for me
i like a little bit but i will never
understand those people that can
have like tons and tons of garlic in
every meal they eat
[Applause]
risotto is done it doesn't look as fancy
as the gusto card because we haven't put
the rolled goat's cheese on top
but oh this just looks so good
and tomatoes and red peppers are my
favorite combo
i also threw caution to the wind and
threw some cheddar
in as well so there we go here you are
oh thank you enjoy yo that's a big
portion yeah
i've come upstairs i'm gonna have a bath
i don't know what i've done to my
shoulder but earlier on when i said it
was really like
sore i must have pulled it or something
because
even eating my dinner like bringing my
fork up to my mouth i was like
ow so i thought i have a bath
soak it in some warm water and see if
that helps
i'm going to use the irl bath bump
so even though digital detox day has
been and gone
the irl bath bomb in lush it's still
available
so if you missed out or you thought it
was only going to be
for the week of digital detox day it's
actually just until
they are all fully gone so if you've not
yet gone out and grabbed one
it's so cool seeing so many of you
sharing your bath bombs
on stories and tagging me in them what
is going on with my hair
um so thanks for doing that i love it
oh my god did anybody else ever find
those
like hair scrunchies that had like the
hair
that would just like stick out like this
that's what it looks like i'm wearing
also i've got food on my teeth
oh well i'm gonna put this bath bomb in
i'm gonna get in the bath
i'm gonna chill
hello happy friday uh myself and mark
have met up a lot
met up our last trip to home sense
wasn't as successful
but we've heard great things about the
brighton home sense
therefore we've come to this one
and we've just had a whole car journey
of like
deep really deep really deep meaningful
chats
um so we are we are feeling good now
maybe we should talk about it on camera
one day
yeah maybe one day one day i feel like
we didn't we didn't laugh once which is
really weird
so we're gonna have to be really
but no sometimes like you said we don't
want always people to think that we are
just passing our tits off 24 7. yeah
sometimes we're not we need to
we need a d m deep and meaningful deep
and meaningful
it's nice it's very hot in here isn't it
all of a sudden
oh i just looked at myself and was like

that's that's what we just
had a big old chat big old
debrief yeah like a week deeper get it
off our shoulders
live the internet so many things
just so many things that we want to
change we just miss the old days
we really do um but
we know that you have a lovely
supportive
community of people that are just the
best
so we're very grateful for that so
grateful that's what we kept coming back
to
very grateful times are changing but
we're all growing up together
and we love you oh no
you can't be quite in both your vlogs
i'm actually gonna get
bubble tea dum dums salads everything

me and mark are out on a walk and
yesterday
a couple of sheep had somehow got into
this field from the field they were
supposed to be in

their dog and he said how quick are you
on your feet
i mean me and mark were like well
another sheep has has got in and now
it's just one so he's on his
own in this field and he's at the gate
trying to get back
through so i think me and mark might try
and
see if he'll if we can get him back in
but mark's terrified i don't actually
think you're joking now
no i'm not joking did you think i was
joking
yeah but we're not a farmer we don't
know what to do
you just have to try and guide him
through that's what sheepdogs do
look how sad he is all his friends are
in the other field
okay no i don't want him to be sad but
i'd already rammed up the arse
he they don't come near you nah they run
away from you there's a difference
between sheep and a ram
no he's walking towards him it's all
right come on
little shawnee he's all right oh
it's bleating come on the only thing is
i don't want nala to scare it
so why is the man why was the man money
