i feel like a whole new woman no
no were you actually gonna look yeah no
you work
merry christmas
good morning it is currently
4 30 in the morning got up with nala
who is obviously now like fast asleep
so i just thought you know what
i'm not gonna attempt to try and get
back to sleep i'm gonna come downstairs
i'm gonna watch the rest of strictly
because i never finished watching it
last night because i fell asleep on the
sofa
um so basically my
time zones my sleep pattern is
totally out of whack because i feel so
wide awake right now
um and i i know i'm gonna be paying for
it later but
i'm just gonna edit my vlog i'm down so
early
that the christmas tree hasn't even come
on yet
and i've got that timer set to like half
five six
do you know what though there's
something i quite enjoy
about getting up this early and being
like the only one awake and feeling like
the rest of the world is still
asleep does anybody else know what i
mean
i feel like most of you were like no
i sleep in till a normal time i don't
like getting out of bed
i don't know what it is if i wake up
past four i really
really struggled to get back to sleep
and i know that nala's gonna need to go
outside at some point so i was like i'm
just gonna get up
i just feel more i mean i don't look it
i need to put some eye
some little um eye patches but i just
feel
like i can get more done or that like i
don't know i quite like that i feel like
the only one awake and there's no
disruptions and there's no
you know the door's not going or my
phone's not ringing or
it's a very quiet time of day and i
think my mind likes that
i don't know i feel like the very small
proportion of you watching this that are
morning people will totally understand
what i mean and i feel like the vast
majority of you watching this will be
like no
on sundays i sleep in for as long as i
can
she looks so cute wrapped up how are you
feeling today my little girl
nola's been asleep in our bed
hello
you need to i reckon put her on here
move my um
cables
so
feeling so much more fresh i've had a
shower
i've done my makeup properly
i've sorted my hair out i've put some
perfume on
and i feel like a whole new woman
having a really slow kind of lazy
morning
it's really rainy outside it's kind of
the perfect concoction
for a cozy sunday um and what are we
gonna do on this
rainy cold blustery sunday
we are gonna go and sit in a mandarin
nick's garden
they've got like a marquee in their
garden so that they can have people in
the garden
and we're gonna see if we can order the
roast that we
ordered last week so that amanda nick
poppy shawn
and me and alf can all sit outside in
our duffel coats and hats
and eat a roast it's quite a 20 20
sunday isn't it i feel like it's gonna
feel semi-normal
i think it'll be an experience so i'm
excited for that
um we're also going to i think me
actually i think alfie's just going to
go to his mum straight away because
obviously not all are still not feeling
great
um but i'm going to go to an open house
with poppy and sean and alexia and steve
as well
and brighton is like known for its open
houses it's one of the things that i had
never
heard of before or knew existed before i
moved to brighton why is this camera so
high up there we go
but i absolutely love them so they
happen
in the summer and then occasionally in
the winter as well for like december and
christmas
um crafts but it's where people open
their houses and showcase
lots of um local artists work whether
that's paintings pottery
prints um decorations
cards like you name it
it's there actually one year in vlogmas
i don't remember which vlogmas it was
we drove around to lots of different
open houses and
it's such a nice way of supporting local
creatives but also
um buying any christmas gifts that you
need to buy so there is one
that we are going to nip into today
which i'm really really excited to
go and see because they always go all
out
and they've done it this year where you
have to book like a time slot so there's
not too many people in there so they're
being very covered safe
that's that's the plan for the afternoon
um as you saw
i was up at 4 30 but i did manage to
edit my vlog which i'm really happy
about
and um that's all ready to go
and now i'm ready for the day so i hope
you're all having a nice sunday as well
whatever it is you're doing oh your
lighting looks very different from what
mine did
really oh i always roll on like this
don't change my settings
can i change it i roll like that
i don't think anything changed yeah it
did did it
yeah but you preferred my lighting so
how does that make sense i can't
remember what was going to say oh we
were going to open calendars but also
you weren't in my vlog yesterday
why you were in town and then it was
just a very me just doing lots of house
stuff
vlog i was in the garden with narly just
nonstop
i think i might put a gazebo in the
garden and live in a gazebo for a couple
of days with her
it'd just be easier i might camp in the
garden you know what though guys
saying that this morning she's been a
lot better
yeah way better even since just having
her breakfast
it's been a long time since she's been
out
she's going out like two hours now
instead yeah instead of like every half
an hour
which is lovely lovely time it's like
i feel i feel like i've got so much
better sleep doesn't it like
where are you actually no that's how
tired alfie is
he's just given up filming with me no
i'm still here
i'm just i thought we did a podcast oh
it's just audio
poppy really likes our rapping by the
way
that's great because it's for her
i haven't actually checked the comments
yet on that video to see what people
preferred
your audience all gonna love it i don't
know i think they'll be very honest with
me
today feels really festive to me
yeah why i think because we're gonna get
a roast
yeah and i feel like because i've had
the first i've had like a good night's
sleep for the first night in like
five days so i feel like
i feel just like i'm ready for ready for
the slow down
like i've got quite a few of these to
open sing a christmas song
go jingle bells
go then that's not singing no i was
suggesting it for you to sing
no yeah this isn't for you baby that's
obviously
favorite thing in the world like
something like charades
nah something like do an impression of
this
nah anything that's like on the spot
like that that's your worst
biggest fan and your dad doesn't like it
and neither does poppy i think it's just
embarrassment
um how many of these did i forget to
open
day 11. can you tell a christmas joke
i can't think of one right now
um 10. did she come back in here
where is she
suspicious well
another little elf and today
13. where does santa live
oh i had this um conversation with alfie
in his vlog actually
um when you were growing up
what did you call santo father christmas
or whatever you called him because me
and joe
were always told that it was father
christmas
and that santa claus was the american
santa
so we would always say father christmas
um but i'm just interested to know what
you called what you called him
today's christmas film of choice on in
the background
always is
all i want for christmas i think it's a
90s film
maybe even late 80s i need to check
it's got thora birch young thora birch
like hocus
pocus era thora birch
i can't actually really remember what
happens in it but i have
background watched it a few times i need
to properly sit down and like
take it in but i think it's about
his parents that are getting a divorce
which is kind of sad
but it's cute i waited for you before i
did this one
you've already opened two right you've
left me 10 and 12.
yeah yeah because we were doing
alternate john lewis foundation
that's cool today you have helped
somebody who is struggling to find a job
to get back into work with special
training
we've supported a couple of charities
like this haven't we for sure yeah we
paid for like
training courses and also all the travel
to be able to get to the training course
and back
and forth for interview outfits yeah
that's gonna say all the clothes yeah
cause that's one thing
um i don't know how much you speak about
the charity stuff we do i don't know
that i have because i always
find it such a like contentious subject
because i feel like i don't ever want
people to think we're talking about it
so it's like
look at us look what we do but then at
the same time i also don't want people
to think we do nothing
i think it's more that i feel happy
knowing we both do a lot
yeah um and i don't ever feel like i
need to like justify it but at the same
time i like when other people talk about
it because it inspires me to support
similar charity all that charity as well
and it raises awareness for the charity
yeah and i spoke about it in a video of
mine
and everyone was like if anyone thinks
of it in the other way
they're thinking of it wrong like you
talk about it you do your thing
you be proud of what you're doing if
people want to take it wrong that's up
to them
and i was like yeah that is very true so
alfie and i um
give a percentage of our entire revenue
so everything that we earn
um each and each month we select a
handful
usually two or three different charities
um to support with that money um so
that's
something that we we've been doing that
for three years
three years now yeah we've helped like
the most varied selection of charities
we try and take we try and get a really
good
diverse diverse selection of different
charities that we
um aim to try and help always things you
never know about like for example with
this like with the john lewis help
people get back to work
one thing that people often when they
have gone to training courses
um and we've funded a bunch of training
courses
for people to acquire new skills to be
able to get jobs
or help them get jobs and
i never thought about the charity
reached back out to us and said is it
possible to
help with funding everybody to have new
clothes
to be able to wear for their interviews
clothes for their job interviews
i've never thought about that of course
so then we funded all the new clothes
for them to wear
another one that particularly stands out
to me i mean we've genuinely helped so
many different things
can i say too yeah one is
can i say three let me have one okay
i'll say two one you might say the one
i'm thinking
i know which one you're saying okay i'll
leave that one here uh
why do you know because i just know
that's the one i was originally gonna
say
uh one was we helped fund
a cafe to open
for lgbtqa
plus members and people that are trans
to be able to come out to their families
in a safe space so we funded for six
months a cafe to be open
but they were open purely for a safe
space
for people within brighton hove to be
able to as well
i think they had a lot of people that
were over 50 that had a particularly
different
different and then obviously when it's
open they have to have the relevant
staff with development training on site
to be able to help out many
conversations just in case the family
didn't take it the best i always think
about things like that and how covered
has affected things like
things like that yeah massively so
then another thing we did is we funded
all the zoo calls so that was the same
kind of thing but the zoom cause the
other one
that is just so special is that somebody
there was
a young boy came to a pop-up shop i did
in brighton for future self
with his career with his karen he's in a
wheelchair so lovely
they are the most amazing people ever
hello if you're watching he
was having a birthday party and wanted
it was like the coolest birthday party
it was like a fun fair outside
and wanted certain things at the party
for example like
uh teacups and everything all the
different rides and things at his party
which
also had a lot of other disabled
children attending the
rides to be adapted so that they could
do them
and use them like i might use them
but with their disability so maybe
wheelchair friendly
or just more support so we
funded 50 of the party um
so that all the rides were like adapted
so that's so cute
all the children there were able to have
a nice benefit from the rides which is
so cool
um one of the ones that i i
i love i have all of them are very very
close we probably helped like
50 charities and they're all very tan
like it's very tangible and i think
that's
that's something that we found
so nice is that we can say what is it
that you need so we're not just saying
what money do you need oh yeah it's not
we're saying what is it that would be a
huge benefit to you right now
um whether that's washing machines and
tumble dryers for the homeless shelter
yeah we bought all of those
yeah um we bought a computer once for
a um a hospice that is controlled by
your eyes for people that were
disabled and wouldn't be able to didn't
have a weren't able body to use a
computer so we
bought a computer that was registered
eye movement which is cool anyways
so there's this one animal shelter near
local to us and was it at the start of
the year there was a
there was a really bad storm like it was
the end of last year end of last year
started this year
really really bad storm that basically
just completely destroyed
all the outside barns and stables and
like for the donkeys for the donkeys and
the horses
so we funded for them to have new
stables
and also for the guinea pigs expensive
payment but it was like oh and the
parrot
wrote oh yeah we bought for the no
they're not just parrots they were
weren't they um they had arthritis
we bought special ropes so that they
could still grip the
better onto the ropes but all the
parrots there with arthritis
but they're like the donkey they sent us
pictures of before and after of like the
donkey
my battery died but we're good they send
us pictures before and after of like the
donkey showed
all like blown down and fallen apart and
broken
and then afterwards and like pictures of
the horse and the donkeys and
is it horses or horse horses horses it
is very cool i'm trying to think what i
think
we didn't mean to get onto a charity
charity chat
as i said i don't i don't really speak
about it just because i don't know how
i don't know i don't know how people
feel about it but like you said you know
i i'm very inspired when i hear about
other people speaking about different
charities
and where to help but on the other hand
i'm also where not everybody is able to
help certain charities but you can help
by doing things just like
sharing spreading the word spreading the
word yeah literally just
share them on your instagram stories
might help out with somebody that
therefore can fund them like it doesn't
have to all be financial help
yeah it could be volunteering somewhere
i'd love to know if you want to hear
me talking about it more um and i guess
i've never asked you so i've just
assumed no one would want
i don't know i just get so nervous that
people will take it the wrong way but
let me know if that's something that you
want us to talk about more um
all of the things that we just spoke
about mentioned
a big chunk of those the money that has
literally come in to be able to fund
them it's from you watching this video
like if you've got zoe's new book
eight percent of all of the revenue
that's always known from that book
is paying for these if you've ever
bought a zoella product
anytime over the last three years that
has gone
to fund these things that this isn't
like look at zoe and i being so nice
giving a chunk of our money away don't
get me wrong
we could be earning that money instead
but the money is only there
because of this yeah like the ad revenue
from this video there will be a piece of
it
that goes and funds these like it's
literally the people watching the video
yeah so true so it's not like
not to say is it like you could have the
money in your bank yes you could be
earning that money and have more money
but it is kind of like they've made the
money do you know what i mean yeah so
you kind of so it's like
you guys are kind of already helping
it's everybody yeah
you're choosing to put the money there
but and we always say that to our
employees too because it's their hard
work as well
like they are also helping these
charities
for sure um so it's like a big team
effort so well done guys
you can feel good today open day 12.
this is the excellent pioneers of sand
dams today you have given a farmer in
kenya seeds to plant trees so that they
can grow more food for their family
that's nice love it so those are we're
up to date on this now i wonder what 24

just caught the end of elf such a good
film
i think it's up there with top five i
feel like i say this about every
christmas film
i'm now craving those bloody cookies
that i cook the other day
baked cooked i feel like my brain's not
actually functioning properly right now
yeah i could really eat one of the
gingerbread and white chocolate cookies
i might have to
i've got a food shop coming tomorrow
what time is that arriving i ordered
some
like chocolates and like snacky
christmasy bits
quite a while ago because every shop
online is
there are no slots for anything
so slightly worrying
i'm gonna have to venture out like a
couple of days before christmas and do
like the big food shop
and i feel like everyone else is gonna
be doing the same thing
so i just have these visions of me and
the whole of like brighton and hove
queuing before christmas to get their
food
we'll see how we get on but there's no
online delivery slots anymore
and i placed an order for like snacky
party food and
like tubs of chocolate
but i didn't want to get like my actual
christmas day food
because it's still too early to do that
so the only slot i could get was
tomorrow
so i just thought right i'll get all the
frozen stuff and all the like
sweet sweet treats
can someone tell me to clean my house
what are you saying what happened there
i don't know don't pick up we're in the
same room
can everyone wave
to get everyone to make me clean the
house
why don't we all go for a late night
walk no
just jumped off that call i think
everyone just needed a little bit of
sunday night
pep in their step i think i'm gonna end
this here because
uh i'm quite tired i feel like we've
come to the end of a great day
um i felt very festive today i've loved
it
um the roast was delicious i love
playing a game in the garden
and it's made me even more excited for
christmas time and getting to spend
quality time even if it's just for five
days or however long we can don't know
what tier we're gonna be in next week
but yeah absolutely loved it perfect
day and i hope you liked it too
and i hope you guys had a perfect
weekend as well with whatever it was you
were doing
