this day is cursed we're in the
christmas tree field
oh my god oh my god oh my god i'm going
so fast oh it's quite small
oh my god we've never done the light so
quickly ever it's looking really good
good morning everybody it is the 4th of
december today
and alfie and i are in the car
and we are on our way to wilderness
woods
to pick up a christmas tree
we're also meeting um poppy and sean and
amanda and nick
at wilderness woods which i'm really
really excited about because i feel like
for the past few years
either amanda and nick haven't been able
to come poppy and sean have been able to
come or
let's just call him out let's say what's
happened
okay
it's all of us this day is cursed the
christmas tree
wilderness woods day is always a cursed
day one couple out of the six of us will
always
argue between the couple between the
couple so then they won't go
or who was it last year me and you and
the year before it was popping sean
no so last year i mean you argued on the
way we both didn't go
and then we went another day by
ourselves yeah we went another day by
ourselves but the group
wilderness woods christmas tree day is
just something goes wrong every time
that means the six of us
aren't there together was it last year
or maybe it was the year before because
we went and got the tree separated by
ourselves because we had argued
we then you decorated the tree by
yourself
did i was it last year was it a couple
of years ago
the christmas tree just it's just a
curse day yeah as we said
something normally goes wrong this year
so alfie's mum just called and she was
like
i think this is gonna be the year when
the six of us are all here together
and alfie went yeah um it's not me and
zoe this year we're all good
we're on our way we haven't happened for
me and sean though we haven't heard from
poppy shawn this morning
imagine legit we're saying this and we
get there
our guys not feeling too well or
something like that and we're like
we know it that they might no can i just
say we're all very very
firm happy relationships
they're never massive massive arguments
but
just i think what it is it's just become
a thing it's because we all want the day
to be
so enjoyable
then we're like no we'll do another day
no you've annoyed me now we're doing it
do you know what i mean yeah so we want
the day to be perfect and not turn up
with even one percent of an argument
and that's this year also please let us
know that it's not just us
please there must be other couples out
there watching this that are like
we always argue about the christmas tree
or on christmas tree day too
you know what it is someone wants a
smaller tree some plate
but also alfie and i argue
putting the tree up too like the years
in vlogmases
that like we've argued or i've sped it
up in a time lapse but you can see that
alfie's like that's not what you're
supposed to do
or i'm going you've not done it right or
something there's just
something about christmas trees i love
them but
they're it's just they're stressful
yeah we are on our way now as i said
we haven't argued and wilderness woods
is just the most it's probably one of
those places
in december that makes me feel the most
festive and like the most christmassy
i don't know what it is and i just i
love it
and i want a hot chocolate and i think
they're doing pizza
like pizza ovens so i'm definitely up
for a piece of pizza
um i think i want to buy some foliage
and as always
our tree will be going on amanda and
nick's roof rack along with poppy and
sean's
um so we will they don't actually get a
treat today my parents no they don't
actually buy a tree today
they always go with their friends yeah
um but yeah i'm really excited
it's one of the days i really look
forward to and i know that you also
really like
this day no arguments high five
i mean we're not there yet so you never
know i could turn this camera around 24
minutes in the car
oh no i could turn this off and
something could happen
guys just didn't really feel like going
today we decided we're not gonna go
you'll know why no i'm excited
hey
here we are oh and everyone else who's
got an 11 o'clock slot
i'm scared of having spiders in my
wellies so
the only thing i didn't bring i just
tipped my welly upside down and found a
tiny piece of shriveled up cheese
wrapped in cling film which
i have no idea why that's in my
welly should we take
tape measure do you want to take measure
or not
hello you didn't argue we didn't argue
did you not remember i think we've
broken the girls guys
yeah that's true
sean's in focus hi guys
i'm taking over this look welcome to
vlogmas you're welcome
that water smells a bit oh
pungent um got a little hot chalk

it's gone lovely have you got your
wellies on
do you know how lucky we are with this
weather that it's not absolutely
chucking it down
it was yesterday oh my god i have to say
though it is
freezing i think this is the coldest day
yet i'm glad i've got a hot chocolate
but i'm a bit sad i forgot my gloves
i think this is the way in unless it's
further down no because the sign
wouldn't be there
oh yeah yeah
we're in the christmas tree field
which one would you pick that's actually
quite a nice one that one yeah that's
lovely
these are these little ones this one
yeah this one would be really cute
yeah that is cute i do like a little one
what
merry christmas

we should pick one now for seven years
this one's gonna be a good one i can
feel it
this one this one yeah he's cute
and that one yes
yeah wait seven years
i'm so glad i curled my hair this
morning me too
i feel gorgeous i feel gorgeous
we found the zip wire who's going first
do you want to go on it from the top or
do you want to go from down here and
obviously
the top okay
ready
i've got no vagina left
jump off jump off jump off
oh he's already oh
okay nick are you ready
hold on tight hugely looking forward to
it
are we ready
it's crunch time which tree
are we gonna go for
right are you ready let the savage will
be good
let the savagery begin that's where we
have to get out
every single tree individually basically
isn't there yeah
and unfortunately you're too small to
have to help yeah what size you go in
eight foot seven to eight i reckon
that's the one
no
yeah it's quite a good one though this
one yeah
bring that out no the bottom doesn't
look great
oh oh i mean it is very nice no that's a
nice one keep it as a reserve i think
that's really nice i like this one
me and poppy had just sent sean and
alfie
no he's too skinny he's not bushy enough
no not that one i think that one's all
right yeah
that's really good there was no way that
it was that quick this year
yeah get him yeah keep him to the side i
won't carry on yeah
just to be sure
i think it's nice okay great go perfect
it's all gonna drop yeah it's lovely
but that's good as well that's fine are
you having a vow
that was just difficult i gave him my
camera like can you film this and she
literally didn't even turn my camera
around oh
you wanted me to hold your camera whose
camera have i got of course
look at me i'm double filming yeah
yeah i think it's a good one just make
sure that one's good don't worry about
it yeah
the other camera you can turn it off oh
it's quite small
stop it it's about eight foot
nice and tall you're six foot remember
i don't even know today's vlogmas yeah
hello what's wrong with him today
oh is that an argument brewing
no no you have to say now god
look at that that is a lovely treat
about this one oh okay
well maybe it is then let me just look
from far away
doesn't it it's hard it does look small
no it doesn't it's quite
small it's small for you that's what we
usually go for yeah normally it's pushy
like until like here yeah
okay we're leaving this one
and we're going with this one or uh
yeah i think so
i mean here they don't actually look
that different this one is bigger
yeah it is okay
look at them all the boys are just
standing with a tree
you're right sean
there we go thank you so much thank you
what have you done are you stuck
button's about to get ripped off oh my
god
it's caught in here oh my god it's
so caught in there there we go i love
these woods
they're so like orangey
coming over back over
go around that one nick just around this
one yeah so give it back
fine guys i broke my camera what's going
on with my lipstick
i dropped my camera it's broken
um and i just bought it it's a new one
so how many vlogs did i get out of that
then
as you saw amanda and nick have the tree
on their car
and they are now gonna drive to our
house
and drop it off for us because they've
got a roof rack on their car so
that's what's about to happen i can't
feel my fingers or my toes
do you want to put some of this on yeah
great and i'll see you back at home
with hopefully a fixed camera
as you can see i have now resorted
to uh loungewear shock horror
i took off my jeans and i put on
something a little comfier
i did have to go and have a bath and i
took off the remainder of my lipstick
um because i was just so cold so now
that i've defrosted
we've put up the tree we're just gonna
let it drop
a bit um because it's been tightly
bounded um and i think alfie's got to
make a few work calls but then
once it's dropped we can start on the
lights
and then we can start decorating um you
may have seen in that time lapse
actually that we did have to trim a
little bit off the top
we kind of knew we would have to do that
um
but i actually don't think it looks too
bad i don't think you can really notice
i don't actually know if we've ever had
to do that in this house before
usually we get the height pretty spot on
but
we were struggling with finding a tree
that was as bushy as it was tall
i feel like the bushy ones were quite
short and then the
tall ones that we felt like would fit in
here were quite like
narrow so finding like a big bushy tall
one
it was hard but do you know what
finding the perfect christmas tree is
hard
me and poppy were saying like
i wonder if anyone ever just turns up
and just grabs the nearest one and it's
like this one will do
even if it's got like a massive gap in
it or it's just got like a funny little
bit hanging off of it i suppose some
people really like quirky trees in which
case that does make sense but
i'm such a perfectionist when it comes
to a christmas tree i've always been
that way
um growing up in my family house we had
one that we planted in our garden every
year
and it was not the most beautiful
looking tree
in terms of like shape and size i think
it wasn't this type of tree it was the
one that
like drops needles a bit more and but
smells more christmassy
so we had a tree and i'm
fairly sure they had it in the garden at
a different house and we took it to
different houses and planted it in the
garden
um and then as we got a bit older we
just left it in the garden because we
were like is it really the nicest tree
not sure and then we started buying
trees instead but also
you miss out on the joy of going to pick
a tree
even though i would quite like to grow
my own christmas tree
i think it would be cool they were
saying that from start to finish
it takes about seven years to grow one
so if we could find a little spot in our
garden
and plant like a tiny little like
nursery version like a nursery tree is
that what they're called
like a little like basically a baby one
um and just let it grow and grow and
grow and see what it turns out like in
seven years i think that would be really
cool
i'm happy with that got arthur christmas
on the tv
this is actually a christmas film that i
always say
if you have small children or kids
this is such a great film for them i
wish i'd watched this as a child because
i think in the modern day as it is now
if i watched this if i started having my
doubts and i watched this
i would just be like that's how they do
it that is how it works
but alas my parents
wrapped my presents from father
christmas in
the wool leftover wallpaper that was on
our walls and me and joe were like
hmm that's weird
and i think that was quite a giveaway
it's such a great film great for adults
too it's actually up there in like
top five christmas films for me i really
really enjoy it so
i'm just gonna watch this for a bit uh
and
wait for this tree to drop and then once
alfie's out of his meeting
we can decorate it's these ones yeah i
think so
these ones i think so i'm not gonna do
the whole thing and then you say
oh we should do it on two sets uh
i mean potentially do you want me to go
who knows do you want to go like this
i saw a lot of people online this year
going up and down
that looked weird do you not do you
think yeah i didn't like that
because between the layers you get you
get like the
chord yeah true where you normally get
the ball balls we hide it around back
here
yeah very true like that to that
yeah yeah that would look weird maybe it
only really looks great in
uh artificial trees a bushy tree
because i think we start around he's
saying we but he means him
not out of joyce every year
every year i try and do the lights and
every year you have to fix it
so i'm saying but that's because you
asked me to that's not me being like
well i'm just really bad at like ratio
i'm really bad at knowing how much is
left via what's um
left of that tree fantastic job there
alfie
yeah don't start moving them around yet
i know what you're doing i'm not i'm not
going to touch them
because once once we've done all of that
we always move it around anyway
yeah yes alfie i'll just cheer you on
doing an incredible job there it's a
lovely tree actually we did all right
didn't we in the end
yeah we did really good with this one
yeah
you want me to hold this no okay just
like that's just
gonna add another layer off
stress yeah
just doing the finishing touches
doing the doing the old squinteroo
i reckon pull one out to the edge
um further to the right see where it's
under the windowsill a bit
yeah yeah yes yes yes great yep and i
think we need something
where my hand is in here this bit
this is looking great i mean that looks
really good yes
this is a little bit dropping for me
oh my god we've never done the light so
quickly ever
that's why i feel that may be something
to do with the fact i didn't help
you as though he hasn't helped it's
actually gone really well
for the last couple of years i have
always decorated the christmas tree
in the living room in a woodland theme
and i've collected all of these
decorations over the years
um don't ask me why i went woodland
theme i honestly think it was just one
of those themes on the john lewis
website one year
and it's just kind of stuck and it's
quite a nice theme to
stick to color scheme
is green purple and gold i think
if i remember rightly
okay oh look at these they're so pretty
these are my favorite they're like
little pegs
just clip on little like mushrooms and
you can just attach them to like
anywhere on the tree so i've popped one
in there
got one in there i wish i'd bought more
of these actually
i'll pop one where do you think for the
third one like somewhere down here
like in here that's cute my favorite
decks the little mushrooms
same it's just so unique isn't it like
clipping it on and when you just like
catch them inside
these ones oh i can't open with one hand
oh these ones are
a fave little conkers
here's one in action um
what else have we got let's take off the
layers
oh these ones i think these are john
lewis as well
i basically just get all of my baubles
from john lewis
do you love these look they've got moss
inside
isn't that cool it's really cool
or have i missed a trick there do i go
on this one
yeah oh sorry green ones are so pretty
lawfully it's looking really good
i like a bloody mess around your
shoulders yeah maybe on that bit than
here
ready yeah comfy yeah
don't bend it down too much i have to
bend it towards me a little yeah
oh i actually don't think i can it's
very sturdy
imagine if you pulled the tree down
did i just get that on first go is it
straight
have a look stand far away no way
smashed it that is on
oh i went high five love it
dinner's been eaten we've got the i'm a
celeb final on
just about to end the vlog but i just
thought i would let you take one more
look at the tree
and appreciate it in its finished
glory how lovely does that look
i'm so happy with it i think me and
alfie are going to go up
go to bed nala
this is it this is the show you know
there's no shotgun
