i just feel like the vets would
appreciate the poo under the tree oh my
god you know what we should do
[Music]
this is the finished gazebo my level of
happiness has peaked
[Music]
another day another christmas t-shirt i
thought i would
sit down this morning
and let's open the blind a bit more on
my face
maybe that's a bit much there we go
thought i'd sit down this morning
and do my makeup with you because even
though i have done this a few
times and my how i do my makeup really
doesn't change that much
i've noticed quite a lot of you in the
comments asking me
to talk you through how i'm doing my
makeup at the moment
and it is literally the same thing every
day
and i love it
hang on i think i'm getting a post
a post a delivery no let me see
what do we have here all my makeup is a
little bit
grubby actually i need to give it all a
good clean
i think i might um tackle the task of
like
completely sorting out my makeup in that
gap between christmas and new year where
everyone's off
and everyone's chilling right first
thing i do
is my collection uh lasting perfection
concealer the shade i have is
ivory oh just realized
don't have a mirror i'll have to use
this one
and i literally whack it under my eyes
cover those dark circles and any little
blemishes
that i have around my nose oh my god my
stomach's rumbling
i just realized i haven't had a proper
breakfast yet
like that i go overboard on the
concealer
next i'm using my bare minerals original
and the shade i'm currently using is
medium beige
which i think is a little dark for me
but i quite like oh alfie's ringing me i
quite like that it gives me a bit more
like color in my face i think i look a
bit healthier just dry it out
where are you now i am just going
past you know the little tiny rounder
but on it's not really about
returning it goes up next i use
the bare minerals um photon it's
actually called warmth now
it was called photon i think oh put a
bit much on there
and it's a loose powder which i think is
a little scary and i'm not gonna lie
oh my god is kind of messy sometimes
but i always go back to this because it
just gives
a really natural
sun-kissed bronzed look
i think because it has slight undertones
of like red
there we go then i'm using this blush
this is the natasha
denona bloom highlighting blush
it's very pretty got a little bare
minerals brush here
tap tap
it gives a really nice glow do you see
that
i do love a highlighting blush a
two-in-one is always good
and then i'm still using uh this nars
palette which is the wanted
one cheek palette and the color
unlimited which i think is just
a nars highlight which
i need to buy because i've just used the
whole thing up
and i just take that on my cheeks
for a bit of added highlight down the
nose
on the forehead when i do this makeup
look
i just try and do it as quick as i can
so i can't say
there's a lot of precision happening but
it does the job the anastasia dipbrow
pomade in medium brown
and a little angled brush i think this
is either the mac one
or a sigma one tiny little angled brush
um and i just get a little bit on there
and i just i start here because that's
where my gaps are
and then i just lightly
cover over the hairs
and bring some definition back
same on the other side
okay my brows actually do need
to be sorted out to be honest and then
i've been using this this is the
hourglass
arch brow volumizing fiber gel
i think this one is in a color yeah warm
brunette i don't think i am warm
brunette but
it it's blending
and i just do that
define the old brow hairs a bit
okay and then for eyeshadow um
i've literally been using uh the
soft glam anastasia beverly hills
palette
and i've just been going for a matte
brown the rustic
and then a really light gold
shimmer which is called glistening and
i've just been doing those two colors
and then with this little shader brush i
just take a little bit of the matte
brown
and i take it under my eye when i first
started wearing eyeshadow
i had this little barium dazzle dust in
like a bright
green which was like one of the first
eye shadows i'd ever bought
and i used to go to school
um i must have been about 13
14. i used to just line the green
just a line under my eye none on top
just under i don't know why i thought
that looked good but
i'd love to know who else's first
eyeshadow was a barium dazzle dust
they're such good quality um
oh i've left me mascara in the
bathroom give me a sec
okay and then the hero product
probably one of my favorite makeup items
in the last six months
i actually don't know how long i've been
using it for since summer i think
the hourglass unlocked instant
extensions mascara
i'm just gonna give you a little before
okay now you wait for the after
there's both my eyes
one with one without there you go look
at those
lashes right i'm gonna do i'm gonna do a
red lip
i have been loving this
which is what i've worn in quite a few
vlogs it's the too faced melted matte
in hot stuff but
i might wear this today it's the nars
dragon girl
lip crayon
there we go and that
is my everyday current makeup
the lighting here is a little bit blue i
wonder if i just
i've made a bloody mess right
now i just need two do i want to
straighten my hair i kind of like it in
the bun
but it was straight yesterday and then
obviously it rained
when we were out so now it's
a little curly i'm gonna do a bun
i've decided so when i do a bun i get my
hair like that
i pull half through and then i twist
my hair into the second
i didn't do that very well because i was
trying to show you
damn it okay i'm gonna do it again it's
a very hard thing to try and show you
but
in one round
take it through round
i mean i'm just gonna keep going until i
get it
do you know what that's gonna do and
then i'm gonna pin some bits down
pull some bits out pull this a bit
you don't want it to look too tight you
want it to look
messy i should have just left it how it
bloody was
right that'd do that will
do pinned some bits down look at my
bloody messy bedroom i need to sort that
out
we're all good it's messy but that's
that's the vibe we're going for
right let's head downstairs so i
actually
wrapped alfie's presents this morning
which i'm very very happy about because
i was trying to find a morning where he
was still asleep in bed
and i could come downstairs and wrap
them without him coming in
so i managed to do that so i'm happy
about that i'm currently sorting out a
little
gift bag for the vets because we have a
vet appointment
i don't think she quite understands the
word she'll know when we uh pull into
the driveway though
we have a vet appointment today and
fingers crossed it's our last
appointment before christmas day
and fingers crossed nala's going to have
her bandage taken off so
we bought them i mean we bought loads
of hotel chocolate
um chocolates we were going to get like
a really big box but
i mean sharing right now is not really
it's not really the thing
so we bought lots of little mini ones so
that each person that works at the vets
can take one um oh my god tiramisu
right let's pop them all in the bag
and we'll write them a little card tis
the season what card do we want to write
hey so this is from you i am i don't
know if you've
followed for long but i usually write a
card
at any given occasion christmas
birthdays
from nala as a joke um obviously
and nala is not that nice
in her cards she's a bit sassy she's a
bit rude
uh she's a bit sweary um
so maybe we won't have that narla write
a card
i wonder if i've got one with dogs on it
oh merry christmas from the dog
that's perfect merry christmas from the
dog i mean it's not that's not the dog
we have
but i forgot i bought this card for
alfie one year
um it has a little gold foil santa on it
and it says
if a jolly fat man puts you in a sack
tonight don't worry
i told santa i wanted you for christmas
guys i never did write any christmas
cards
oh well oh that's a pretty good one
it says i've done a poo under the tree
merry christmas lol i think i might do
that one it's got a pug on it
let's see is it merry christmas from the
dog or is it i've done a poo under the
tree merry christmas lol
i just feel like the vets would
appreciate the poo under the tree i mean
it's very apt for nala
really through this vlogmas
let's do the poo under the tree i think
i'm gonna sign this off
from all three doggies actually so poppy
and shaun's dog
sydney buzz and
narla because they all go to the same
vet
got harry potter on
there we go let me send it to the family
chat just to make sure they approve
okay wonderful do you know what i might
write alfie's christmas card which one
do i want to write for alfie
i'm gonna write this i'm gonna do this
one
so one thing that we'd been planning
for months was to do a secret santa with
poppy shawn steven alexia and we drew
the names
and uh we all said they would come here
we'd sit in the garden
we'd sit around the table and we would
do our secret santa listen to some
christmas music and that would be like
our little friend
friend miss um the weather though
hasn't been on our side at all we were
gonna do it
yesterday night and it it had absolutely
chucked it down so all of the furniture
outside was soaked
we do have a marquee or i don't really
know what you call it like a gazebo
that we bought um
when we were allowed to be outside
with up to six people so in the garden
because we just thought it would be
useful to have
i think at the time we actually got it
to protect us from the sun because it
was so
hot um and
we thought oh well we'll get the gazebo
out because
we can all sit under that and then we
won't get wet but the problem was
was that the rain yesterday was that
rain that just like
blows sideways and
uh the gazebo was only like a roof it
didn't have sides like amanda and nick's
one that we were in the other day
um so alfie ordered sides for our gazebo
a while ago actually and we just thought
they're not going to arrive in time
they didn't arrive yesterday but they
did arrive today
so this morning alfie and i have been
out here putting the sides on the gazebo
putting the gazebo up over the
table and chairs i brought all the
chairs in
lit the fire to try and dry the chairs
um in an attempt to try and rescue any
sort of
friendmas that we are allowed to have
um as i said we're tier two so we can
have six people in the garden
and we just felt like this was a nice
little compromise nice and safe
the gazebo is i mean alfie ordered it so
it's larger than it needs to be
so that's good in this sense a
total eyesore i think you'll agree
not the best view out of the
conservatory anymore
um but it means that
in the winter months if we remain
in tier two um we can be outside and be
safe
so we're gonna just leave it up for this
for the foreseeable i think
um and we're gonna we're gonna see
whether or not we can do
our secret santa christmas night in it
tonight but it does also mean that we
now have
something else to decorate christmasy
um so i think i'm gonna get the
tablecloth out like some candles and
decorate that make it look nice
get some christmas tunes on we've got
speakers in the garden so we can put
some christmas music on
outside in the garden and yeah have
have ourselves a very merry secret santa
christmas
um it would be really nice to be able to
do that um both steve and alexia
now can't see their family on christmas
day as their family that was gonna visit
them
are in tier four which means that they
are alone on christmas day
um so to them i just feel like
us being able to do this is um
kind of like their little like christmas
celebration so
fingers crossed we can make it work i
think we're gonna do a raclette
um alexia has a raclette machine
and you can order some like special
raclette cheese
i don't actually know i know it's that
thing that you can get at like a
christmas market where the cheese like
runs off
but i don't actually know what you put
with it she said something about potato
and then steve said something about
meats so
i'm thinking it's along those lines but
whatever it is or however it looks it
sounds
delicious one thing we will have to do
whilst it's still
light is to try and put some festoon
lights in there because i have just
realized
once it gets dark
oh we won't see so we'll see how we get
on
forgot my camera didn't i but we're at
the vets
you're all right all good
yes just waiting for them to come and
get her
so fingers crossed her leg will be okay
and you'll have your bandage taken off
wouldn't that be good so in the last
clip
you would have seen me saying on my
phone i think nyla might get her bandage
off
she didn't she's got a new one but we
have to go back on christmas eve and
they're gonna
check on it then they said it's healing
really well it's just in such an awkward
place
because it's like her leg joint um but
going as quick as you can aren't you oh
she's just running off
hi then i am now in the gazebo and
i am going to attempt to festive this up
i'm going to put lights in it we're
going to have to put heaters in it
because it is
a little chilly and i'm going to set the
table
[Music]
do
[Music]
it's just started raining and we've just
i'll be sorting out the heaters we
thought it would be good to get them on
now
got these really it's like the plug
doesn't appear
on any of them that's weird
oh there you go um so these lights
i've actually used a lot this year um i
bought them because i knew you'd be
spending a lot of time outside and i got
them from laradoo
you can take this off and you can put
them on the ground
or you can hang them up here i don't
know whether i've already shown these in
a vlog i feel like i have
and then you've got like three different
settings of like light strength but i've
obviously put it on the
brightest i don't know whether the
batteries are running out but they're
not that bright
um and then the table
i think it will look amazing when all
the lights are lit all the candles sorry
and we've
strung all the lights oh my god we
should string some down the middle
oh my god it's gonna look amazing i
might put some bunting
along this as well i wish we had tinsel
same we could have tinsel
tinsel fired it we could have done this
for christmas day
i mean we can still use it yeah um we're
hoping to use this through
the winter months basically as if we
stay in tier two that is
um otherwise it would just be me and you
in here and then there's no point
it'll be cool yeah where are you gonna
attach that one
i'm gonna put it on a tripod maybe up
the other end
i haven't turned it on at the plug yet
oh do you want to go turn it on
i'm scared too i just find extension
cables really terrifying
i've said this before in a vlog but i
was once electrocuted i'm gonna close
this as well now
okay to keep the heat in we should
probably leave it open when everyone's
here though
yeah i once got electrocuted so now
sockets
kind of terrify me um it's a stupid
story
i plugged my straighteners into
the wall without the plastic bit on the
back of the club
there i'm so excited
this just looks amazing and now that
it's raining it feels so cozy
oh my god you know what we should do
what no i'm being silly
what put a christmas tree in there oh
boy
i could carry that one out there's just
so many glass ball balls on it
yeah i know is there one there's one
downstairs
the skinny one no no there's a ring one
there's literally a ring tree downstairs
getting slightly carried away but i knew
i had another christmas tree
and i call this one the pop-up christmas
tree because it's on rings
so it's really easy to throw up whoa
i think we should turn some off actually
for a bit
at least we know they work geez oh this
one's perfect yeah it's just the pop-up
tree
ideally
[Applause]
that does look great i think i made a
good call on the tree
[Music]
okay little update we have christmas
lights
it looks so good okay
i think this is like my favorite thing
i've done a month
like my level of happiness has peaked
right now look at this
oh alfie's ringing the door hang on as i
was saying before alfie got back from b
and q
which is a whole other story basically
the door slammed
and uh crushed and broke the wire
that we had that had lit up the lights
down the middle and the tree in the
corner and the end
um heater so that screwed us up slightly
so alfie ran to being queue and grabbed
another one in time i'm so surprised he
managed to do that this is the finished
gazebo
i'm not gonna lie we didn't even think
this was gonna be happening this morning
so considering we've just thrown this
together
i'm really proud of myself i've done
napkins with a little tiny candy cane
and a like dried orange given everyone
place names as i said i've sat
everyone opposite each couple i
literally just want to live in here
i think i prefer this table to the table
inside
we'll obviously open this up for
ventilation but that's why we've got all
the heaters
um this candle i lit about an hour and a
half ago
and it smells so festive in here i think
this is the white company winter candle
oh oh my god oh my god love it
very happy you can come through
merry christmas
[Music]
i can't wait for you to sing
wait my god
oh my god this is so
cool isn't it sick
wow this looks so good
[Laughter]
[Music]
i love your hat it's like a wuzzle gummy
christmas hat
what else merry merry christmas
[Applause]
oh my god guys do you love it
oh sorry did i wake you up you can lie
back down
no that's not someone breaking in
through our window
that's alfie days playing are we playing
don't worry about me what are you
playing
call of duty just died it was so nice
earlier on honestly i just
i think that was one of the highlights
for me of december
look at my bronzer i've got like patchy
bits left
um and i think everyone else had a
really good time as well and the
raclette
was so good i want to get one of those
machines
i think we need one oh my god so good
and then when everyone was done
and had gone home
we were talking about our plans to do
our festive christmas food shop which we
were going to do tomorrow morning at 6
a.m
and we were like right guys see you
there six a.m
that's gonna be five a.m well we thought
it was open at five but it turns out it
was open at six so poppy calls us and is
like
guys it opens at six not five and we
were like oh okay
and then when we looked at the time the
opening times
it said it was open tonight until
midnight
so we were like okay well why don't we
all just go now
so at half nine we all went
to um the shop and
did our christmas food shop and i'm
really happy about it because it's done
now
and it wasn't that busy um they did have
a few things that weren't in stock as an
fyi
if you're about to go out and do some
last minute christmas
day food shopping the best time to go is
probably at 6am because i think they're
fully stocked in the morning
but we still i would say managed to get
like 95 percent of what we really needed
so we got all the goods yeah we got all
the goods so i just feel so relaxed
knowing that's done
that gives us more time tomorrow to sort
out
our massively messy house
i don't know how it gets so messy it's
because there's boxes everywhere of like
half used decorations which is me
um and like boxes
from presents where we've obviously done
most of our christmas shopping online
this year
so i think me and alfie are just gonna
have one massive
tidy up and sort tidy up and sort out
yeah that's right tidy up and sort out
are you excited for that
he's concentrating and i will see you
