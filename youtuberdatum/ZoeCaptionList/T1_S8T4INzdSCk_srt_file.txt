hello it's currently tuesday
how are you all let me know in the
comments how's it going a bit more of a
rainy week this week
um which i'm not gonna lie
i found very cozy this morning
don't get me wrong i love the sun i love
being outside and like
being in the warm um but
not being able to like go anywhere and
make the most of the sun
does make me feel very like i'm missing
out
so the fact that it's raining today just
makes me feel
more homey i don't know i can't
put my finger on it usually i hate the
rain but today i woke up it was dark i
turned on all the lamps and the lights
and the fairy lights
lit some candles got cozy
yeah i quite like it i mean we're
predicted to have rings
for a while so i don't know if i'll
still like it
in like a week but whatever as you can
see
i am currently up in my office which i
haven't
used that much since we've been in
lockdown
um i've just been using my laptop
anywhere in the house i've had no
separate workstations which actually
maybe i should have done
i probably should have done this weeks
ago
but i don't know i just i didn't yeah i
came up here
 oh oh
i am dying i was literally just gonna
say anyway i came up here and i sorted
everything out and i organized it
um tidied it up when i did that so
okay i'm writing magpie oh my god i'm
literally like crying with laughter
ah i'm writing the last chapter
is a big moment when we first came up
with this
yeah oh my god it's all going on
yeah oh he's outside
yeah when i first
when me and amy first came up with this
idea
and we first started drawing up the plot
and the characters i bought this
[Applause]
this like magpie i mean i don't know
what i thought i was going to do with it
i guess it was just my inspiration
um and this has been like on the floor
so today
i picked it up and i put it in a
plant pot on my desk
clearly forgot about it just turned
around
and this was just in the plant pot
looking at me and for a split second
i thought it was an actual bird i don't
know where to put this
because although it is plastic and cheap
and
every now and then it does
look real i think it's the glassy eyes
and the like haggard feathers
basically this was just my um
constant reminder of make sure you write
the book
it's not i don't know i literally just
put it there and then i forgot
it's not that i'm scared of birds but if
i had one sat in my plant pot on my desk
anyway i don't know where to put this
because anywhere i put it it's gonna
make me jump and i'm gonna think it's
real
it also has a little battery pack in it
i've not put batteries in it
i assume it makes it an awful magpie
noise
um which we hear all day every day
anyway so i don't
i'm not planning on putting batteries in
 i don't know i'm gonna hide it and
put it behind it
so basically alfie's like bringing his
streaming setup up here because i have a
spare desk
which is what he's doing today over here
i'm gonna hide this
so yeah i'm just finishing up
my chapters what you got you sound like
you're
um yeah
you got two one for you
that is ridiculous you look like a cctv
man
got the stream set up you know
why the with that bird there
what the is he doing here doesn't
it look a bit real
yeah at a glance i'm gonna sit and write
my final chapter like this
you're right maggie you enjoying this
book
you've lost the plot are you sure you
want to share an office with me
i'm not sharing an office this is just
streaming oh yeah that's true there's no
way i'm sharing an office with you
although we do in town people are gonna
be like what do you mean
are you streaming
are you streaming no
just working then
do you have an iphone charger yes my
iphone is currently
oh there's some in that coverage
um as much as i love this is here just i
can't
um see
if you wouldn't mind taking it off for
now thank you
is it weird that i kind of don't want to
finish it so it's just done
once it's done it's done
right also
i'm using my keyboard
which th the lights keep doing this
which is fancy um i don't know if i like
it i'm not gonna lie
uh only because i'm so used to the
keyboard where all the keys are on the
keyboard on the laptop
this feels a lot more spaced out so i
keep
like missing like the wrong and i don't
look at a keyboard when i type i look at
the page
um and i keep missing things out
by the way the reason alfie has his top
off is because he's hot
he doesn't he doesn't just spend every
day
oh
[Applause]
don't worry about me oh my gosh you're
the one that said bring my set over here
god get serious when streaming am i
messing about this
this is so techy
don't you just love that sound of the
rain yeah
it's so nice the time of rain when
you're in the tent is the best
how do you rotate the screen like that
well if i told you that i have to kill
you speaking of murders
i need to finish this book
i think i finished so i'm gonna facetime
amy
and tell her
[Music]
i think i finished
oh yeah gosh that's so exciting are you
happy yeah
really happy it's quite uh it's not like
a beefy one
because it's still quite fast-paced yeah
yeah um but yeah
i'm gonna send them i'm gonna send them
over to you now so you can read them
okay awesome um and then i was gonna i
was gonna say we just need to choose
some of those names oh yes yeah yeah
yeah
yay i'm vlogging as well oh you are okay
but like i should put something on
instagram or something like that i know
that we're all done yeah yeah
okay cool well we can we can arrange
that later on
[Music]
okay bye
just bloody went for it and just started
absolutely slamming everybody
and he got a bit out of hand what's zoe
doing i think she's just working
she's currently watching my stream and
vlogging at the same time
you just literally got my stream up you
just look so
funny in the corner with all of your
devices and screens yeah i've got a lot
of screens
i said he looks like he's working in
like a cctv
like holy there's 955 people here
watching
good morning oh good morning
happy wednesday i'm back in my office
this is basically the only place i've
vlogged so far for this vlog
started off the morning with a work call
for a couple of hours and then i made
myself
a toasty
riveting um and then i just made alfie
toasty and now i've come up here
to get editing i've seen a lot of you
saying where are your vlogs
where have they gone guys
i'm very bad at multitasking
i can film the vlogs
but then i'm not really on stories and i
can write my book but then i'm not
really editing
so it's quite hard trying to juggle
everything all at once and i've just
never really been very good at that
um but finished the book yesterday as
you saw
and i've also got some website bits to
do as well
i actually did a little it wasn't really
a sort out it wasn't really a tidy
either because i just put everything in
a pile
um but i had a lot of stuff in here that
i needed to sort out yesterday
and it did make me feel quite inspired
to
get up here and properly
um i guess just properly do a massive
sort out because it does feel quite nice
to have a dedicated
desk space as opposed to like the coffee
table or the dining room table or just
like
in bed um yeah it makes me feel
a bit more productive which i'm enjoying
so if you're working from home or you're
doing
uni work or college work or school work
from home
um i would really recommend setting
yourself up a little
work space whether that's just
on your dining room table but that's
your dedicated space
um or just somewhere in your house where
you can have a little bit
of room for your laptop and a chair
and that's just where you go to work i
honestly do think that that would make
a little bit of a difference well it has
for me anyway
um one thing i did do was i hoovered all
of the floor yesterday
but i didn't get around to like wiping
down the surfaces and stuff so
probably edit my video a little bit and
then give it a bit more of a clean
1001 it's almost gone carpet fresh
i literally just spray this hello you'll
focus
you just spray this on all the carpets
and all the rugs and then you just leave
it
um so it's good for pet odors tobacco
and cooking
love that i also put my
fabric conditioner with water in a spray
bottle
and i like to spray this on things like
chairs or like upholstery
um cushions things that need like a
little refresh
refresh refresh so like this chair
i can't sit on it now because it's going
to be a bit damp but
it smells great so there you go
my little my little fresh smelling
cleaning
tips i'm gonna edit now
right got my mate my little
workmate back back in my office
[Laughter]
why has it taken us till week five to do
this
you would you would think it would be
the opposite you would think we would
start like this
and get sick of each other and you would
be like nah right away yeah
but i think as long as we're not in here
both
all day every day which we're not
driving yeah but we're not
i've only just come up and it's three
o'clock i've been working
i'm not in this room hello me
i can just see a little glisten of your
eye
is that comfy on your neck what's it
called that pugs do with their necks
it's like a resting thing isn't it
they're a kind of dog some dogs have a
thing where they
just want to always rest their chin
and you're one of them good morning
everybody it's
monday and this is day three
in the same vlog didn't film over the
weekend
very chilled we watched a lot of tv
stuff played a lot of animal crossing
and just thoroughly enjoyed the weekend
alfie made a hammock which was fun um
we should go that out actually it's like
still quite nice out today
yeah i'm just doing a little bit of
sorting cleaning
tidying i've done all my work meetings
this morning
so this afternoon is just gonna be
dedicated to like
getting some things in order and i just
thought you might want to see that
so that is what i'm about to get up to
[Music]
[Applause]
hello you join me
in the basement if you're wondering what
i have just used
for the white wash i always put some of
these in
oh bloody hell packed full of these i
love these they have all the different
flavors this is the lenore unstoppables
um in the fragrance spring which is very
apt this down lighting though
so i always do a couple of those
um i have a little drawer of them i've
also got
these two scents dreams and fresh to be
honest
fresh is probably my favorite one then
the old fairy non-bio
pop some vanish golden just a scoop
because it's a white wash
so i just like to make sure that it
comes out beautiful and crisp and white
and then my favorite fabric conditioner
in the world has been for years
lenore spring awakening
you just can't beat it it smells
so good just in case you were wondering
that's what i put in my wash loads
and this is the basement that's a mess
and just has all our cleaning stuff in
[Music]
[Applause]
basically
right i've decided to put on some
leggings because those jeans were the
most
uncomfortable thing to tidy and clean in
and i'm going to take nala out for a
walk which is why she's currently my
little shadow where
are you um got me walking sasha running
shoes on
it's actually really mild out today it's
quite like humid and sticky
so i'm gonna just stick to my t-shirt
and my leggings
i don't think i'll get cold at all you
ready
see you why don't you come get a bit of
fresh air i think it is good for you
put your work down
this won't take long it's always
so late it's 10 to 4. i know i know i
said this to maddie and danielle
i was like today as well i know
the day today has gone so fast
yeah it was two come on
it's good for you to get some fresh air
get the doggy poo
bags
yes we're going for a walk also i'm so
annoyed i've just hoovered in here
and because i just put these trainers on
there is mud like all over the floor
that's really annoying you're running
around in circles
ello we've just got back from our walk
which was lovely wasn't it
we had a nice walk
[Music]
um and now i am repotting one of our
house plants that doesn't look very
happy
and just needs to be put
properly into this pot because it's in
its own pot inside it but i haven't
actually properly put it in the pot
so that's what i'm gonna do
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
i didn't end up filming too much
yesterday because it just turned into a
complete
cleaning and organizing day and then
before i knew it it was late in the
evening
and i was facetiming poppy and alexia
and playing animal crossing
so that was my yesterday um and today
has been a bit of the same
i've been clearing out some draws and
just disinfecting things and like
tidying and cleaning and just doing some
work
meetings and things but this afternoon
i've decided i
really want to make some brownies
i'd never heard of these before
maddie made them for the office bake off
on
on her week when her contestant was
eliminated
and i'm not gonna lie since she made
those brownies
i think about them all the time they
were incredible
so a brownie i'm not sure why
it's actually called a brownie i
feel like
it's a slightly inappropriate name but
it's essentially a layer of cookie dough
a layer of oreos and then brownie
mixture on the top
i think and that's how you make them
that's what they consist
of and i feel like baking them this
afternoon so i thought
you might want to see it in this vlog
and i'll probably also do it for an igtv
because i like doing short little baking
videos
for instagram so that's that's what i'm
gonna be doing
i have been weighing out all the
ingredients alfie's gonna help me film
it
and i found that in order to be the most
productive
for filming recipes to pre-weigh out the
ingredients and just have it all in
bowls
yes it makes a ton more washing up at
the end of it
but it does make filming it and actually
doing it a much easier process so i've
been weighing everything out into bowls
this is for the brownie mixture and this
is for the cookie dough mixture the
recipe that i'm using is a jane's
patisserie recipe
she has some of the most incredible
naughty recipes you know i'm
all about the sugar the carbs the
chocolate
the more naughty the better for me
so i love her website i've been using it
for years and years i recommended tons
of her recipes to you guys
the biscoff cake that i always make is
her recipe as well
and i just trust her recipes so
we're gonna we're gonna use jane's
recipe for brownies they look
insane and i'll leave the link in the
description of this video
go and just go and check out her website
if you're at home right now and you're
baking a lot more than usual or you're
like
i really want to bake and i've got the
ingredients but i don't have the
inspiration
go on her uh blog or website and also
check out her instagram as well because
she has a lot of stuff on there
um i've preheated the oven
to 180 hello
i've preheated the oven to 180 degrees
um celsius fan oven and
i will chat you through what you're
gonna need for this
in a mo uh
what is it with you and stealing
ingredients it's always the chocolate
chips as well
as i said before you're going to want to
preheat your oven to 180 degrees
celsius you're going to want to line
grease and line
your baking tin um you can go square i
know a lot of people like brownies in a
square tin this one's not quite square
this is more of a rectangular but um
i'm gonna assume this will do the first
thing you do is the cookie
layer so i've got my bowl my hand mixer
lots of people are asking me why i'm
using this instead of my kitchenaid
the answer is this is much easier to
clean
if it's a very quick bake if i'm doing
something like icing or something that
needs to be whipped for a really long
time then i'll use
the kitchenaid but for these quick igtv
bakes i
just use this it's much easier looking
at the recipe as i'm saying this so
you're going to need 225 grams of plain
flour
you're going to need 125 grams of light
brown sugar which i ran out of
so i just used caster sugar for the rest
uh 115 grams of unsalted butter at room
temperature
one medium egg 150 grams of
milk chocolate chips half a teaspoon of
vanilla bean extract
one tablespoon of corn flour
half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda
and half a teaspoon of salt um and then
i'm gonna set my camera down on the side
whilst i film the igtv so you can see me
doing the method
and then i will come back to you for the
next bit
i just smudged all my makeup no if
you've got a little something something
on your face
i don't know you're going to do that oh
is it a very dry skin
normal oh that's just my
beard all right dry skin oh we're going
to beat together
the butter and the sugar until it's nice
and
fluffy
let's turn that on shall i oh that's
still off
yeah oh
so i would say that's pretty light and
fluffy next you want to crack in your
egg
and your half a teaspoon of vanilla
extract
[Applause]
next you want to add all your dry
ingredients so you want to add your
flour
your corn flour
your bicarb like
never gets old i know and the salt but
in fact
there's actually a little bit more
bicarb in there there we go
[Applause]
i'm flicking that everywhere
okay that looks pretty good to me
right next you want to add in the
chocolate chips and i'm only going to
mix this with a spoon
or maybe my hands actually um and then
you want to press it
into your baking tray
right i'm just going to press this in
delish this is probably why they say
use a 9x9 baking tray because
it doesn't quite
spread i don't know whether it will
spread
[Applause]
once it's being baked
[Applause]
but i do feel a bit like
this tin is slightly too big so if you
do have a 9x9
i would recommend using that now once
you've
squashed your cookie dough into your
tray you're going to want to put this in
the freezer for 20 minutes
once that's in the freezer um you are
going to want to get your oreos ready
because
that's what's going to go next but it's
also a good time
to get the ingredients ready for the
brownie mix on top
so for the brownie mix you're going to
want 100 grams of dark chocolate
two medium eggs another 150 grams of
chocolate chips
um 25 grams of cocoa powder
50 grams of plain flour 100
grams of unsalted butter at room
temperature
and i've forgotten how much sugar this
was
140 grams of caster sugar just realized
that whilst the cookie dough is in the
freezer
you can be making this bit um so the
first thing you want to do
is whack your butter in a pan and get
your chocolate
melt them together
okay just going gonna leave that to melt
for a second
next thing you want to do is put your
sugar and your eggs into a bowl
and give them a good old mix until it
forms like a kind of whipped texture
did you see that little bit of sugar
chopped off just
flew like
i also got some shell in there
didn't want shell with your
brownies did you
[Applause]
okay whisk that fyi
you are gonna want an electric whisk for
that because
if you were doing that by hand you'd be
there for a very long time but you would
have very big
guns right it's now time to fold
the chocolate in which i'm very excited
to do
now you just want to fold the chocolate
and the butter in
now you folded that in you're going to
want to fold in the flour
and the cocoa powder as well so i'm just
going to add that
yeah watch my technique round over
i don't know that you wouldn't just let
me just try i'm gonna be one of those
moms that's like um
no honey that's not how you do it no
you're gonna do one of the ones that was
like that is perfect okay now let me
just finish it
like what if it was perfect if it was
perfect why did you have to
do another have another go on it yeah i
think i'm gonna find it really hard when
we have kids just to let them like
mess things up only when it comes to
baking
i'm such a perfectionist i can't help it
it's science if you get baking wrong it
just doesn't work
do you know what i mean it's true yeah
you've got to be so accurate with your
ingredients
i feel a little bit like i'm making
fudge
chocolate fudge brownie hmm do you know
i think that'd be so fun on the big
marble slab yeah okay i reckon you
folded enough now thank you
laborious isn't it i love that word
mix through the chocolate chips
carefully and then pour over the brownie
right okay i'm gonna get the brownie
i'm gonna get the cookie out this
bit is where you put your oreos
over the top of your cookie layer
[Applause]
now i'm going to fold the chocolate
chips into here and pour it on
that looks banging doesn't it
next step is popping this in the oven
for 25 to 30 minutes there we go
it's been about 27 minutes
and i'm gonna get it out i stuck a knife
in it thing is because there's so many
chocolate chips in
my knife came out of chocolate chips on
and also i just think a bit like cookies
you can undercook a brownie and it still
tastes quite good
so i'm gonna pull it out now
look how good that looks oh
smell it
holy it smells
so oh my god one piece of that will keep
you up for a week as well
what do you mean because it's got so
much bad food in it it's just pure sugar
the amount of energy that will give you
it's got a lot of sugar
a lot of chocolate oh my gosh
oh now we just have to wait for it to
cool for 10 minutes that's a long time
baking does take long sometimes doesn't
it when you really want to eat it it's
just like
time is just takes forever just a big
tease
but the reward at the end if you can
make it well it's worth it
it's just hay fever anyone else
struggling with hay fever right now
although i've taken a puritan should i
still be sneezing
i suppose it does have you have nasal
spray
no but it has stopped my nose from
running which is good
i was my nose was like a tap earlier
anyway brownies
um look they're out
they are incredible
like i'm scared i'm gonna drop them
but these are honestly look at that
got the cookie layer the oreo layer
the brownie layer um me and alfie
have just taste tested them and i can
confirm
i mean i haven't finished it yet look at
that
halfway finished tears
they are so good he's even made himself
a cup of tea
and now i'm going to end this video but
i hope you've enjoyed it
and i hope you make the brownies if you
do tag me
let me know let me see and as i said
i'll leave the
recipe in the description box for you to
go and follow
and i'll see you again very soon hi
