oh god guys i've realized alfie's better
at this than me
why am i emotional why am i getting
emotional look at it
alberta said i look like indiana jones
looks amazing
[Music]
good morning happy monday to you can't
believe it's another week
i can't believe it's the 14th already
like that just blows my mind i feel like
the start of december was just
like really creeping really slowly uh my
battery's running out
um and now i'm just like where's the
time gone
i just did something and then afterwards
i thought am i
the stupidest person not even afterwards
halfway through and then i just
had a panic i had an email this morning
at 7
52 from sainsbury's you know in
yesterday's vlog i was like oh i've got
an order from sainsbury's tomorrow i
should check
i've completely forgotten so my order is
due to arrive in
five between five minutes and 30 minutes
and my email says
from sainsburys
and i did check so many times service at
sainsbury's dot co dot uk which seems
legit
and they've got my order number
and my name and my address and things
like that
and then they also know when my
delivery is due so it's probably legit
but halfway through
i just thought i've given my name
i've given my address and i'm calling
because they're saying there's a problem
with the card and my order is due in 10
minutes and obviously i'm like
oh my god i need to make sure that
that's paid because i don't want that
order to not arrive
she was really lovely i trusted her
voice she was like
and what's the the last three digits on
the back of the card
and then i just thought oh my god what
if this is one of those calls where they
just take all your details
and i don't know about you but there's
been so many more of those this year
than normal alfie is like mr security
he's missed a paranoia he does
everything by the book
like he is so good
almost like on another scale
i always just thought i was so like
savvy and like
wise to it and then as she asked me to
read out the last three digits on the
back of the card i was like
what if this isn't legit and she's got
my name
my address she already knows most of my
card details and i'm about to confirm
the last three digits on the back of the
card and so i
froze and
i just kept thinking what would alfie do
what would alfie do alfie would 100 have
just hung up and then gone on the actual
sainsbury's website
and got the number and i knew that at
the time that's probably what i should
have done i just went from the number
from this email
then there was too many things that she
didn't know
so i'm gonna message my bank and just
say
if you see any weird activity today can
you let me know
be careful out there it looks like a
legit email
like they knew what time my sainsbury
shop was being delivered so unless
sainsbury's have been hacked
i don't i think this is fine but it was
just one of those moments where
my my stomach sank and then she was like
uh are you
uh do you have that and i was like um
yes sorry no i'm just i'm struggling to
find that card in my purse and i was
like lying trying to like delay
the time while i just thought more about
it but it really made me laugh
oh god okay they've sent me an e-receipt
it was legit thank god oh my god and
just like that i literally turned my
camera off
and he's here
[Applause]
thank you
[Music]
because i know you all love a little
supermarket
haul around christmas time i thought i'd
just show you
bought some turkey foil
got these for the stockings i always
like to put some chocolate pennies in so
we've got one each
these just look like something people
would like i actually don't like
hazelnuts but
i'm aware that i'm probably in the
minority and i think a lot of people
would like something
a little different as a treat
some walnut halves for the cheese board
oh look i forgot i put this in got a
little chocolate chip panettone for
breakfast morning
some lemons some pigs in blankets
flavour tortillas um so the reason i've
got lots of like
party food bits is because on christmas
eve
we tend to go to amanda nix
for a turkey pie um
in the afternoon for lunch and then in
the evening when everyone comes here and
we start putting on our christmas
pajamas
we do like the beigest canapes
as like dinner snacks and sainsbury's
had some good ones that i could put in
the freezer so i've got mini pizzas
arancini bites sweet chili cauliflower
bites
mac and cheese bites mozzarella sticks
and some vegetable spring rolls oh
some mini sausage rolls um they're also
just good i think
around this time because if you have
people over obviously if we're allowed
if it ever gets that point um or for
like boxing day
like it's just good to just throw in so
um
halloumi fries british turkey and
stuffing
pasties um bbq
jackfruit bowel buns
i don't know why i bought this cheddar
with caramelized onion
i just must have got excited because
poppy and sean are doing the cheese for
the cheese board so i don't know why i
bought that
hot and spicy chicken bites and some
12 mini quiche selections we've got
cheese and onion and cheese and
bacon quiches all our party food cooks
at the same temperature
well perfect um
then i saw these and thought these look
nice christmas
conserve mixed fruit jam with spices
just thought that sounded nice and then
this one
is a bux fizz marmalade
twiglets because i mean everyone needs
twiglets
apple crumble cookies made with golden
syrup they just sounded
delicious and then
i got some more celebrations
some more miniature heroes and some more
roses because
um i ordered loads for a christmas shoot
that we did for zoella
and they're pretty much all eaten
apart from i have loads of quality
street left so i only need to get these
and i'm not going to open them until
closer to christmas maybe even christmas
eve because
i just think when it gets to actual
christmas
and you've got a full range of selection
in these boxes it's just i don't know
there's nothing like
it it would suck if it was christmas day
and all that was left were the ones that
no one wanted
so i decided to stock up
just a little bit of recycling that we
have to do there if we're still asleep
it's now 10 to 9. so i think i'm gonna
head up and i'm gonna
get ready for the day put all of this
food away
put it all in the freezer and then
yeah get ready i've sorted myself out
i've got dressed i've put on a festive
red lip
i've put way too much bronzer and
blusher on to hide
the tired this afternoon i
really want to make some tree
decorations
with some of the clay that i have left
from my sculpt box
so god when was it back in the summer
um i ordered
myself a little sculpt subscription box
that i saw
you guessed it on an amazon ad not
amazon instagram
um and i also bought one for poppy for
her birthday
in fact if you are after a christmas
gift idea
where are you oh you're there i just
don't trust her if you can't see her
she's probably pouring somewhere
i ordered this for poppy for her
birthday
and i bought myself one just because it
looks so great so that was back
at the start of the year um may have
ordered somebody else one for christmas
but i'm not gonna say who
in case they're watching but um they
are a little pottery not subscription do
i call it a subscription box it's not
it's like a one-off box
um and you get
two bags of air dry clay
which i think maybe that one is not
great because i'd already opened that
one but this one i haven't opened yet so
that one feels fine
um you get a little bag of tools
actually i'm gonna put you down because
so the box looks like this
there's your clay your guide
um you get white paint and sealant
and some brushes
and a little bag of
tools which i just think is great
hello hello hello
uh i really really want to have a go at
making
some just little pottery
um christmas decorations kind of like
the ones that
i saw yesterday at the open house but
also i've seen so
many on etsy and there was a really
lovely one about staying home in 2020
that i'm going to try and recreate
because they all sold out
so i needed a little summing subbing to
roll
the we've got any like
newspaper or anything where do you want
to sit
uh i don't really mind do you want to
pull the table out a bit
maybe and then you can come around here
you don't think i've got stuck in my
head now yes no
maybe i don't know
[Music]
rolling pin
we're making christmas decorations we're
making christmas decorations
for the tree or just in general
so i've got all my christmas cookie
cutters
lovely what we're gonna do
and this so we can make the hole for the
string to go through
need to feel like i'm in art back in
school you need to roll out
do you know what you should do go on
etsy i was just
and type in like clay um christmas
ornaments
this clay's lasted really well
considering i've had this since may
probably before makes remember i bought
this
oh there's some unbelievable ones these
are quite cool i like these really
delicate little circles
that's cool a cup a cookie and then a
cookie cut within the cookie that's
really cool
yeah i like that oh look and then
they've got the middles there's little
ones
all right oh that's such a good idea did
you get two
from it i don't get a circle then so i
don't know if i've got a circle in my um
it could be anything it could be like a
star with that i feel like this is going
to be the texture
that i just can't my hands can't touch
it's not that how dry is it
it's actually fine you know like there's
just some textures
like nails on a chalkboard this feels
like lockdown round one remember when we
just got so crafty and we just did
everything together
yeah do you think that's
thin enough thin enough you don't want
it too thin
really no
there we go what do we put it on
maybe just here oh it's furry
a little bit hey yeah
that's just like binding it's like
keeping it all together isn't it
have you ever listened to um she and him
christmas songs
no what's that she and him is um zoe de
chanel
like her band no way i didn't even know
she had a band
yeah should i put it on you can hear
some of it
while we we can time-lapse this bad boy
for a bit
see back in the good old days of youtube
we would have been able to put
christmas music on and get away with it
oh yeah no no now your video will get
taken down in about
four seconds my little christmas tree
that's cool i don't know what i'm gonna
do on it yet you know i kind of wish we
could um
like dip them and then put them in a
kiln yeah i know that would be so good
it's so good
this is what i suggest people do this
i recommend it your head's a bit chopped
off
that's all good guys i've realized
alfie's better at this than me
i'm not better than you you're
like look how pretty this one is this is
my favorite one alfie's done
oh you can't see look how cute
you're so good at it i'm impressed
then i tried to do a heart one which i
hate
spotty one but apart from that i've sort
of left mine quite plain
because i want to paint them but
yeah i think you've done a great job
what one are you looking for uh it's
just a new cutter
oh a nude little cutter some of them are
quite massive aren't they
yeah some of them are pretty what is
that it's a pug
do you remember i made pug you know no
do you remember i made
pug biscuits for nala's birthday but
they were like heat for us to eat
that's the cutter i brought that yeah as
you do
these are all my me christmasy alfie
were saying that this is
such a lovely thing to sit and do
with some christmas music as well yeah
we've been listening to she and him
christmas album which i will leave in
um the drop down if you want to go and
listen to it's a very chilled
um christmasy album really really love
it
the rain outside yeah the rain is added
to it it's like
perfect this is one of my favorite
things we've done this month
i just feel so festive and like i don't
know i feel like i'm tearing up
i don't know why i'm really emotional
why am i getting emotional
i just really like it i'm having a
really good time
but i have my yeah
i don't know it's been a strange year
isn't it fake
blimey so fair zoe
hi your mum honestly the older i've got
the more emotional i've got over nothing
i think it was just because i just had
like such a burst of happiness it like
just felt very overwhelming
make some clay decorations it'll make
you so happy you cry
i remember growing up my mum was always
the mum that cried at everything like
every school play me and joe did
like everyone used to joke like oh your
mum's on the front row
like we're gonna see her crying like it
was like she was the crying parent you
know
and i and we used to get not embarrassed
but we just used to be like
oh mom like why do you cry at everything
and i remember her saying to me once
that she was on a coach
and she can't remember this yeah and i
mean in the olden days
not like old and old and i feel like mum
will be like it wasn't that long ago but
back in the day coaches would have like
proper
old square tvs right at the front of the
coach i bet they still do
there was none of that like screen in
the in the chair
malarkey it was like old school
i remember her saying to me once that
she was in the back she couldn't hear
it because she couldn't have headphones
or anything if you're at the front you
were lucky if you were at the back you
just watched the picture
she didn't she couldn't even hear it and
she was crying to the film on the back
and she'd never seen the player and
she'd never seen the film
didn't know what was happening but she
was crying at it and i was like
i can i can never imagine getting
emotional like that
but as i've got older so many things
make me cry like what nearly made me cry
the other day and i was like why am i
crying
do you remember in the living room just
anything
could literally be like an instagram
video a tick tock
but also i'm one of these people that if
someone else cries
yeah i cry but it has to be a happiness
cry if they're sad
i go into like oh my god are you okay
but if it's like an overwhelming
happiness like
cry of something i don't know maybe
they've been surprised or
um they're really happy and they cry
i will instantly just cry
like how did my eyes know that do you
know what i think it's because you're
so empathetic
you literally take on whatever emotion
someone else is feeling
yeah but i do feel like that emotion is
particularly like
strong like you know when you watch like
britain's got talent
like they they get through and the
golden buzzer goes and the song is like
you
raised me up i'm always just like
oh my god and it's getting more and more
poppy's the same i think it does though
as you get older
i think it does but i wonder why
i want like i understand crying with
sadness but
like when you cry with laughter for
example yeah
why are your eyes leaking when you're
laughing like why do your eyes do that
when you hit an extreme emotion
i don't know i don't actually know the
science behind it but yeah
why do you cry i don't know
and like crying is so associated with
being really sad
but i feel like
the emotion of happiness and crying then
is is completely contradictory to what
we know as crying
yeah i don't know what was the last
thing that made you cry
happy cry happy happy cry yeah let's
have some really lovely
let's see if we can leave comments that
make everyone else cry at just the
comments
i probably will that'll be you read in
your own comments read in the comments i
will be crying
the last thing that made you happy cry
what was the last thing that made you
happy cry
i don't know alfie's not really a crying
no
i am a little bit actually there was a
video the other day you quite sad thing
no no no there was a video the other day
and poppy linked me yet
oh i linked her it or something and she
was like oh my gosh this is so emotional
and i was like
literally my eyes were watering which is
a lot for me because i don't really get
20 20 that alexia put in the chat no
that made me cry holy [ __ ] that was so
emotional i'm no longer available i saw
that earlier legit the cutest video made
me cry
what was it someone it was on someone's
stories
was it the professor who his class had
turned all of this
maybe it could have been it could have
been that that's floating around
instagram
so a professor was doing a lecture and
he was like why have you all got your
screens off
um is this a new thing that that
everyone's yeah
have i done something like he was really
like confused and then someone goes sir
we wanted to do something for you and
then they all turn their screens on and
they've got signs saying like thank you
oh my god it literally makes me want to
cry thinking about it i can't
and he was literally he was like crying
he went he got
he left the room to go and get a tissue
and then he was like wanting to take
screenshots of it like pictures of it i
can't even think about it without my
eyes tearing up
i think particularly for me and i don't
know why
when men cry that just hits me on
another level
not like boys like people like my dad's
age like adult men
yeah just hits me on another level a
little heart anywhere
i can probably go find one in the
cupboard do you want a heart
let me see if i've got one who does i've
got literally everything i've got bats
i've got pumpkins i've got polar bears
but i don't have a heart
what should we do for dinner tonight i
feel like i need to
get cooking a dinner i feel like
tonight's going to be the first normal
night we've had
oh don't you're gonna jinx it i'll touch
wood
being slightly more herself today well
let's just put it this way she's not
pooed since 5
30 so in the morning it's gone
the opposite way she's gone from every
half an hour
to never to not at all unless
do you know what i was gonna say to you
i feel like this day has gone
so slowly and we've had like it's just
been so much more chilled and it
literally is probably because we're not
going outside every half an hour
okay right i think we're done i've just
washed my hands i'm done
what's your favorite one yours
my favorite one is that one i think we
should have done more like that
you can do another quick one no should i
just do that to the star
do you want to do it do you want to
invest it this
well should i just copy you you do
whatever you want
do you get rid of those bits yeah i know
you leave them one
yeah look at it
you don't have enough you don't care
enough to get rid of the little scraggly
bits whereas i'm like
meticulously picking them all off so
that it's neat you're just like
yeah eh
yes i just said i'm gonna copy you
you'd be copying me at crafts no well
that's a good one
that's a really good one oh you like
that one didn't you
yeah i went too deep and too straight
down gentle
like look how deep your hearts are it's
not about it's not about my least
favorite one
no i i think it will come out really
good but they're quite deep maybe a dot
on the end
just see what you feel i think that's
all for me oh no it needs something here
well then just fingers on it wait just
think of something don't do this
lovely do you like it yeah i just copied
our fees
that's never gonna focus there that's
nice
cute we were gonna want to paint these
in a couple of days when they've air
dried
that was fun wasn't it i feel like that
was very therapeutic
i enjoyed listening to the music got a
bit emotional because i enjoyed myself
so much
awesome we've got some decorations out
there yeah
i think they'll be so fun to paint
right i am making nala's dinner
i just thought i'd check in just been
reading some of the comments
on my vlogs and i just love them
thank you so much to everybody who takes
the time out to leave a comment i really
do appreciate it it's very nice of you
um and i think it's just that i'm in a
very emotional mood today because there
were so many that i was like oh my god
i'm gonna cry
but yeah you're all very lovely you're
all very sweet i'm very lucky to have
your support
and i'm happy that you're enjoying the
vlogs
the one thing that i think has actually
helped nada's tummy is adding some plain
boiled
potato to her chicken and rice
a lot of my friends and family have been
messaging me saying
i want to watch a christmas film what
christmas film shall i watch
so i thought while i'm cooking nala's
dinner
i would list all the christmas films
that i think you should watch this year
and if you haven't watched them yet make
a little list tick them off as you go
but these are the ones
that without fail i will make sure i
watch
every december or sometimes from july
onwards
elf without fail one of the best
christmas films ever
after christmas i love it great one to
watch with kids or
young family members home alone one and
home alone two
i still can't decide which one of those
i like the most
i think i like home alone two more
because it's set in new york and i'm
really missing being in new york and i'm
craving
more than ever being there at christmas
time so i think i love that one a lot
muppets christmas carol not the top of
most people's list this one is very
nostalgic for me and
i absolutely love it it's i don't know i
don't know what it is i think
growing up me and joe used to save this
film for christmas eve we used to go out
and get a mcdonald's breakfast
every christmas eve and then sit and
watch this film together so i think for
me
that is like a really nostalgic film so
christmas eve i always have to watch
that
and what else i feel like at the moment
i'm kind of going through all the
obvious choices
miracle on 34th street love that i like
the 90s version
um the holiday
love actually love a christmassy rom-com
gotta throw those in there i really like
the family
stone it's not one that i see a lot of
people talking about but
it's got a great cast in it
and i just it's quite feel good and
[ __ ] you scared me i quite enjoy
surviving christmas which is the ben
affleck christmas film
it's not the best film but there's
something about it and i
love re-watching it and it's just quite
corny and quite cheesy quite predictable
but again i just feel like it's got a
great cast
and it's just fun to watch
so that's ten i'm trying to think if
i've missed any really obvious ones
the grinch another classic i absolutely
love the grinch it is a great
christmas film um
i'm gonna google in case i've forgotten
any oh
okay another one that i love to watch
every year is jingle all the way with
arnold schwarzenegger it is such
a good film again
really corny really cheesy 90s film
very nostalgic still um but i really
really love that one
joe actually told me to watch love the
coopers the other day which i've not
i don't think i've ever seen that one
before so i think i'm gonna get on that
unpopular opinion i'm not really a great
fan of
the polar express i first watched the
polar express when i didn't feel very
well and i think my anxiety was really
high
and when i was watching it i just felt
like i was having a really bad dream
and i didn't really fully understand it
um
and now every time i watch it i just
i don't get sucked into it ever it
always becomes a background film even
when i put it
put it on and i sit down to properly
watch it
my attention just is never captured by
the polar express however so many people
love that film
so maybe it's just me nativity
i actually really like this one i'm not
a huge fan of nativity two or three
but the original nativity does remind me
a lot of being
in school plays and it's very wholesome
and yeah i quite like it holiday
this one came out on netflix this year
with emma
roberts and it's not specifically um
centered around christmas it's centered
around every single holiday throughout
the year
but i flipping love that film and i'm
gonna watch it again a few other
classics that i think you need to add to
your list are the snowman
and father christmas the raymond briggs
animations
um very quick i think they're literally
like 10 minutes each episode or
something but they are always played on
christmas eve and it just doesn't feel
like christmas until i've watched those
so
i really like a bad mom's christmas i
think that's great
uh there's another one as well isn't
there about the dads
santa claus i also really enjoy that as
well
so i think those are those are my main
recommendations so i don't know if any
of you are wondering like
what you should watch those are the ones
that i would definitely have to tick off
every
december without fail if there is
anything
i have missed off i feel like i don't
watch enough christmas comedies
so if there's anything that you think i
should watch that's like
festive but also quite funny let me know
yeah i feel like
i'm definitely more of a
nostalgia christmas film watcher i watch
things for that nostalgic feeling and
just like remembering
when i first watched something oh and
also
i can't forget the greatest store in the
world
um which was a bbc
christmas special like one off in like
1999 i want to say 1999
19 to the year 2000 something like that
and
it featured s club 7 and a department
store in london
and a family that ended up living in the
department store over christmas time and
every time i mentioned a quote from it
like randomly in any vlogs there are a
handful of you that are like
i've seen that i know that film the
greatest story in the world
i managed to find it on dvd about 15
years ago
um and i'm a little bit worried that i'm
gonna get it really scratched up and
ruin it because it is genuinely
just one of the best things ever i've
tried to make alfie sit down and watch
it with me
and he's always like what is this [ __ ]
i might try again this year i feel like
maybe he'll be after something new to
watch but
i just remember watching that as like a
10 11 year old
and me and my friend alex were just
obsessed with it we loved it
i feel like this potato is nearly done
now
it's raining we're taking nala out it's
raining but my mum bought me this barber
hat
what this is the opposite of what she's
been like for the last five days
she doesn't want to go what are you
doing this is the vlogmas content you
all wanted right
this is the opposite we've now got the
opposite problem the fact that
something's brewing in there for 14
hours it doesn't sound good to me
um alfie just said i look like indiana
jones
uh but you know just thought i'd keep
you updated on this
wild journey because i know it's been
the highlight of your vlogmas so
will nala ever do a solid poo that is
the question
on everyone's mind i don't know if i've
shown you our
christmas lights outside but
they are beautiful let me step back
so i also look at the bloody state of me
right now
i'm wearing my mango coat
my barber like dog walking hat that mum
bought me
like a j like joggers and then ysl
sliders our house looks magical from
here
so we've got all these all of these
trees all lit
up got round the side all lit up
and then all of
the little bushes out here oh my lens is
getting wet
all the bushes out here and then you can
see the tree
looks amazing doesn't it back inside
and we've got jingle all the way on
alfie's doing some christmas shopping
and narla my little best friend
it's just sat not too far um and i think
i'm gonna end this here i'm gonna go and
take my makeup off
head to bed but i've got a very exciting
day tomorrow
myself and mark are gonna head to our
favorite garden center
and we're gonna have a mooch around get
festive
fingers crossed we can eat something
outside um we'll see how we get on
but i believe that london is heading
into tier three
on wednesday so tomorrow was the only
day
we could do it and possibly the only
